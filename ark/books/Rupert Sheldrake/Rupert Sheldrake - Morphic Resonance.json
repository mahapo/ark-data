thatnature is habitual. All animals and plants draw upon and contribute to acollective memory of their species. Crystals and molecules also follow thehabits of their kind. Cosmic evolution involves an interplay of habit andcreativity. This hypothesis is radically different from the conventional assumption thatnature is governed by eternal laws. But I believe that the idea of the habits ofnature will have to be considered sooner or later, whether we like it or not,because modern cosmology has undermined the traditional assumptions on whichscience was based. Until the 1960s, most physicists took it for granted that the universe waseternal, governed by changeless laws and made up of a constant amount of matterand energy. This idea of the Laws of Nature has been fundamental in modernscience ever since the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century, and isrooted in the Pythagorean and Platonic philosophies of ancient Greece. Thepatriarch of modern science, Sir Francis Bacon, asserted in 1620 that the Lawsof Nature were “eternal and immutable”1[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos713975] and science’s founding fathers,including Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, and Newton, saw them as immaterialmathematical ideas in the mind of God. The Laws of Nature were eternal becausethey participated in God’s eternal nature, and like God transcended time andspace. They were enforced by God’s omnipotence. When the entire universe was believed to be eternal, made up of a constantamount of matter and energy, eternal laws presented no problems. In thenineteenth and early twentieth centuries, most physicists believed that allfundamental aspects of physics were fixed forever— the total amount of matter,energy, and electric charge was always the same, according to the laws ofconservation of mass, energy, and electric charge. Only the second law of thermodynamics sounded a different note. The total amountof entropy would increase until the entire universe froze up forever—a stateepitomized in 1852 by William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin, as “a state ofuniversal rest and death.”2 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos714224] Butalthough heat death would ensue when entropy reached a maximum, the frozenuniverse would still endure forever and so would the Laws of Nature. Everything changed with the great revolution in cosmology in the 1960s, when thebig bang theory became the new orthodoxy. Ever since, most cosmologists havebelieved that the universe began about 15 billion years ago. When everythingfirst appeared from nowhere—there was no space and time before the cosmos—it wasless than the size of the head of a pin and immensely dense and hot. The cosmoshas been expanding and cooling ever since. All atoms, molecules, stars,galaxies, crystals, planets, and forms of life have come into being in time.They have evolutionary histories. The universe now looks like a vast developingorganism, not like an eternal machine slowly running out of steam. The big bang theory was first proposed in 1927, as the theory of the “primevalatom,” by Father Georges Lemaître, a Roman Catholic priest and cosmologist. Hesuggested that the universe began with an initial “creation-like event,” whichhe described as “the Cosmic Egg exploding at the moment of the creation.”3[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos714495] His theory, which predicted theexpansion of the universe, encountered much skepticism, but evidence for aninitial “creation-like event” eventually became too persuasive to be ignored.One of this theory’s opponents, the astronomer Fred Hoyle, disparagingly calledit the big bang theory, and Hoyle’s name has stuck. Although cosmology is now evolutionary, old habits of thought die hard. Mostscientists take eternal Laws of Nature for granted—not because they have thoughtabout them in the context of the Big Bang, but because they haven’t. If the Laws of Nature are Pythagorean mathematical truths, or Platonic Ideas, orideas in the mind of God, they transcend time and space. They would necessarilybe present when the universe was born: the Laws do not come into being or passaway; they transcend space and time. Clearly, this is a philosophical or theological doctrine rather than ascientific hypothesis. It could not possibly be tested experimentally beforethere was a universe to test it in. To avoid the doctrine of transcendent laws, we could suppose that the Laws ofNature came into being at the very moment of the big bang. This theory avoids anexplicit Platonic philosophy or theology, but it creates new problems. AsTerence McKenna observed, “Modern science is based on the principle: ‘Give usone free miracle and we’ll explain the rest.’ The one free miracle is theappearance of all the mass and energy in the universe and all the laws thatgovern it in a single instant from nothing.”4[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos714677] The sudden appearance of all the Laws of Nature is as untestable as Platonicmetaphysics or theology. Why should we assume that all the Laws of Nature werealready present at the instant of the Big Bang, like a cosmic Napoleonic code?Perhaps some of them, such as those that govern protein crystals, or brains,came into being when protein crystals or brains first arose. The preexistence ofthese laws cannot possibly be tested before the emergence of the phenomena theygovern. Besides all these problems, as soon as we think about the Laws of Nature, wecannot help seeing that this concept is anthropocentric. Only human beings havelaws, and not even all humans. Only civilized societies have laws; traditionalsocieties have customs. Applying the concept of law to the universe involves themetaphor of God as a kind of universal emperor whose writ runs everywhere andalways. This assumption was readily accepted by the founding fathers of modernscience, who believed in a mathematically minded, omnipotent God. But the Lawsof Nature now float in a metaphysical void. Evolutionary cosmology makes eternal Laws of Nature yet more problematical.Perhaps the laws of nature are not all fixed forever, but evolve along withnature. New laws may arise as phenomena become more complex. And as soon as weadmit this possibility, we realize that the metaphorical source of the Laws ofNature, namely human laws, are not in fact eternal but evolve along withsociety. The laws of the United States, or Kenya, or Bhutan are not the sametoday as they were one hundred years ago, or even twenty years ago. They arecontinually changed and updated. But there is no parallel in nature for monarchsor parliaments or congresses. The legal metaphor is incoherent.5[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos715035] I suggest a new possibility. The regularities of nature are not imposed onnature from a transcendent realm, but evolve within the universe. What happensdepends on what has happened before. Memory is inherent in nature. It istransmitted by a process called morphic resonance, and works through fieldscalled morphic fields. In this book, I discuss the hypothesis of formative causation primarily in thecontext of biology and chemistry. In my book The Presence of the Past6[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos715391] I extend this discussion topsychological and cultural evolution. This new edition The first edition of this book was published in 1981. It proved controversial,as described below. In the second edition (1985) I summarized thesecontroversies, along with the results of some early experimental tests of thehypothesis. Much has happened since. In this new edition, I have revised andupdated the book throughout. I summarize the results of research so far inappendix A, where I discuss ten new tests. Appendix B consists of a dialoguewith the physicist David Bohm in which we explored connections between formativecausation and quantum physics. The remarkable developments in biology over the last quarter of a century havemade the limitations of the conventional mechanistic approach more obvious, andhave increased the plausibility of the hypothesis of formative causation. How mechanistic biology has revealed its own limitations In the 1980s, the mechanistic theory of life seemed set for ultimate triumph.The neo-Darwinian theory of evolution had eliminated God from nature, and lifeitself was about to be explained in terms of physics and chemistry, with no needfor any mysterious fields or factors. Many scientists believed that molecularbiology was on the verge of revealing the secrets of life through anunderstanding of the genetic code and the control of protein synthesis.Meanwhile, brain-scanning techniques were about to unveil the mechanisticworkings of the mind. The Decade of the Brain, inaugurated in 1990 by PresidentGeorge Bush Sr., led to further acceleration in the growth of the neurosciences,and stimulated yet more optimism about the power of brain-scanning to probe ourinnermost being.7 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos715516] Meanwhile, an enthusiasm for artificial intelligence led to the expectation thata new generation of computers would soon be able to rival, or even exceed, themental abilities of human beings. If intelligence, and even consciousnessitself, could be programmed into machines, then the final mysteries would besolved. Life and mind would be fully explicable in terms of molecular and neuralmachinery. Reductionism would be vindicated. All those who thought that mindsinvolved something beyond the reach of mechanistic science would be refutedforever. But this has not happened. It is hard to recall the atmosphere of exhilaration in the 1980s as newtechniques enabled genes to be cloned and the sequence of “letters” in the“genetic code” to be discovered. This seemed like biology’s crowning moment: theinstructions of life itself were finally laid bare, opening up the possibilityfor biologists to modify plants and animals genetically, and to grow richer thanthey could ever have imagined. There was a continuous stream of new discoveries;almost every week newspaper headlines reported some new “breakthrough”:“Scientists find genes to combat cancer,” “Gene therapy offers hope to victimsof arthritis,” “Scientists find secret of ageing,” and so on. The new genetics seemed so promising that soon the entire spectrum of biologicalresearchers was busy applying its techniques to each specialty. Their remarkableprogress led to a vast, ambitious vision: to spell out the full complement ofgenes in the human genome. As Walter Gilbert of Harvard University put it, “Thesearch for this ‘Holy Grail’ of who we are has now reached its culminatingphase. The ultimate goal is the acquisition of all the details of our genome.”The Human Genome Project was formally launched in 1990 with a projected budgetof $3 billion. The Human Genome Project was a deliberate attempt to bring “Big Science” tobiology, which had previously been more like a cottage industry. Physicists wereused to huge budgets, partly as a result of the Cold War: there was enormousexpenditure on missiles and hydrogen bombs, Star Wars, multibillion-dollarparticle accelerators, the space program, and the Hubble Space Telescope. Foryears, ambitious biologists suffered from physics envy. They dreamed of the dayswhen biology would also have high-profile, high-prestige, multibillion-dollarprojects. The Human Genome Project was the answer. At the same time, a tide of market speculation in the 1990s led to a boom inbiotechnology, reaching a peak in 2000. In addition to the official Human GenomeProject, there was a private genome project carried out by Celera Genomics,headed by Craig Venter. The company’s plan was to patent hundreds of human genesand own the commercial rights to them. Its market value, like that of many otherbiotechnology companies, rocketed to dizzying heights in the early months of2000. Ironically, the rivalry between the publicly funded Human Genome Project andCelera Genomics led to a bursting of the biotechnology bubble before thesequencing of the genome had even been completed. In March 2000 the leaders ofthe public genome project publicized the fact that all their information wouldbe freely available to everyone. This led to a statement by President Clinton on14 March 2000: “Our genome, the book in which all human life is written, belongsto every member of the human race . . . We must ensure that the profits of thehuman genome research are measured not in dollars, but in the betterment ofhuman life.”8 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos715764] The pressreported that the president planned to restrict genomic patents, and the stockmarkets reacted dramatically. In Venter’s words, there was a “sickening slump.”Within two days, Celera’s valuation lost $6 billion, and the market inbiotechnology shares collapsed by a staggering $500 billion.9[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos715951] In response to this crisis, a day after his speech President Clinton issued acorrection saying that his statement had not been intended to have any effect onthe patentability of genes or the biotechnology industry. But the damage wasdone. The stock market valuations never recovered. And although many human geneswere subsequently patented, very few proved profitable to the companies thatowned them.10 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos716081] On 26 June 2000, President Clinton and the British prime minister, Tony Blair,together with Craig Venter and Francis Collins, the head of the official genomeproject, announced the publication of the first draft of the human genome. At apress conference in the White House, President Clinton said, “We are here todayto celebrate the completion of the first survey of the entire human genome.Without a doubt this is the most important, most wondrous map ever produced bymankind.” This astonishing achievement has indeed transformed our view of ourselves, butnot in the way that was anticipated. The first surprise was that there were sofew genes. Rather than the predicted 100,000 or more, the final tally of about25,000 was very puzzling, and all the more so when compared with the genomes ofother animals much simpler than ourselves. There are about 17,000 genes in afruit fly and about 26,000 in a sea urchin. Many species of plants have far moregenes than we do—rice has about 38,000, for example. In 2001, the director of the chimpanzee genome project, Svante Paabo,anticipated that when the sequencing of the ape’s genome was completed, it wouldbe possible to identify “the profoundly interesting genetic prerequisites thatmake us different from other animals.” When the complete chimpanzee sequence waspublished four years later, his interpretation was more muted: “We cannot see inthis why we are so different from chimpanzees.”11[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos716208] In the wake of the Human Genome Project, the mood has changed dramatically. Theold assumption that life would be understood if molecular biologists knew the“program” of an organism is giving way to a realization that there is a huge gapbetween gene sequences and the way living organisms grow and behave. The presentbook sketches out a means of bridging that gap. Meanwhile, the optimism of stock market investors has suffered a further seriesof blows. After the biotech bubble burst in 2000, many companies that were partof the biotechnology boom of the 1990s either went out of business or were takenover by pharmaceutical or chemical corporations. Several years later theeconomic outcomes were still disappointing. An article in the Wall StreetJournal in 2004 was entitled “Biotech’s Dismal Bottom Line: More than $40Billion in Losses.”12 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos716471] It wenton to say, “Biotechnology . . . may yet turn into an engine for economic growthand cure deadly diseases. But it’s hard to argue that it’s a good investment.Not only has the biotech industry yielded negative financial returns fordecades, it generally digs its hole deeper every year.” Despite its disappointing business record, this vast investment in molecularbiology and biotechnology has had wide-ranging effects on the practice ofbiology, if only by creating so many jobs. The enormous demand for graduates inmolecular biology and for people with doctorates in this subject has transformedthe teaching of biology. The molecular approach now predominates in universitiesand secondary schools. Meanwhile, leading scientific journals such as Nature arereplete with glossy full-page advertisements for gene-sequencing machines,protein-analysis systems, and equipment for cloning cells. Precisely because there has been such a strong emphasis on the molecularapproach, its limitations are becoming increasingly apparent. The sequencing ofthe genomes of ever more species of animals and plants, together with thedetermination of the structures of thousands of proteins, is causing molecularbiologists to drown in their own data. There is practically no limit to how manymore genomes they could sequence or proteins they could analyze. Molecularbiologists now rely on computer specialists in the rapidly growing field ofbioinformatics to store and try to make sense of this unprecedented quantity ofinformation, sometimes called the “data avalanche.”13[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos716634] But in spite of all thisinformation, the way in which developing organisms take up their forms andinherit their instincts remains mysterious. The evolution of development In the 1980s, there was great excitement when a family of genes called homeoboxgenes was discovered in fruit flies. Homeobox genes determine where limbs andother body segments will form in a developing embryo or larva; they seem tocontrol the pattern in which different parts of the body develop. Mutations inthese genes can lead to the growth of extra, nonfunctional body parts.14[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos716864] At first sight, they appearedto provide the basis for a molecular explanation of morphogenesis, the cominginto being of specific forms: here were the key switches. At the molecularlevel, homeobox genes act as templates for proteins that “switch on” cascades ofother genes. However, research on other species soon revealed that these molecular controlsystems are very similar in widely different animals. Homeobox genes are almostidentical in flies, reptiles, mice, and humans. Although they play a role in thedetermination of the body plan, they cannot themselves explain the shape of theorganisms. Since the genes are so similar in fruit flies and in us, they cannotexplain the differences between flies and humans. It was shocking to find that the diversity of body plans across many differentanimal groups was not reflected in diversity at the level of the genes. As twoleading developmental molecular biologists have commented, “Where we most expectto find variation, we find conservation, a lack of change.”15[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos717155] This study of genes involved in the regulation of development is part of agrowing field called evolutionary developmental biology, or “evo-devo” forshort. Once again, the triumphs of molecular biology have shown thatmorphogenesis itself continues to elude a molecular explanation, but seems todepend on fields. That is why the idea of morphogenetic fields, discussed inthis book, is more relevant than ever. Epigenetics Throughout the twentieth century, one of the strongest taboos in biology wasagainst the inheritance of acquired characteristics, sometimes called Lamarckianinheritance, after the pioneering evolutionary biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck(1744–1829). Lamarck proposed that adaptations by plants and animals could bepassed on to their offspring. In this respect, Charles Darwin was a convincedLamarckian. He believed that habits acquired by individual animals could beinherited, and played an important part in evolution: “We need not . . . doubtthat under nature new races and new species would become adapted to widelydifferent climates, by variation, aided by habit, and regulated by naturalselection.”16 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos717378] In this sense,the inheritance of habits by morphic resonance is in good accordance withDarwinism, as opposed to neo-Darwinism. Darwin provided many examples of theinheritance of acquired characters in his book The Variation of Animals andPlants Under Domestication, and also proposed a theory to explain it, the theoryof pangenesis. Modern neo-Darwinism was established in the 1940s, and firmly rejected theLamarckian aspect of Darwin’s theory. Neo-Darwinians asserted that genes werepassed on without modification from parents to offspring, apart from rare randommutations. Any kind of Lamarckian modification of the genes was impossible. Bycontrast, in the Soviet Union under Stalin, the inheritance of acquiredcharacteristics became official doctrine under Trofim Lysenko. The debatedegenerated into polemics and denunciations, and in the West the taboo againstthe inheritance of acquired characteristics was reinforced. In his rejection of Lamarckism, Richard Dawkins, the leading modern exponent ofneo-Darwinism, is clear about his feelings: “To be painfully honest, I can thinkof few things that would more devastate my world view than a demonstrated needto return to the theory of evolution that is traditionally attributed toLamarck.”17 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos717636] Evidence in favor of the inheritance of acquired characteristics continued toaccumulate throughout the twentieth century, but was generally ignored. However,soon after the turn of the millennium, the taboo began to lose its power with agrowing recognition of a new form of inheritance, called epigenetic inheritance.The prefix epi means “over and above.” Epigenetic inheritance does not involvechanges in the genes themselves, but rather changes in gene expression.Characteristics acquired by parents can indeed be passed on to their offspring.For example, water fleas of the genus Daphnia develop large protective spineswhen predators are around; their offspring also have these spines, even when notexposed to predators.18 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos717857] Several molecular mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance have been identified.Changes in the configuration of the chromatin—the DNA-protein complex that makesup the structure of chromosomes—can be passed on from cell to daughter cell.Some such changes can also be passed on through eggs and sperm, and thus becomehereditary. Another kind of epigenetic change, sometimes called genomicimprinting, involves the methylation of DNA molecules. There is a heritablechemical change in the DNA itself, but the underlying genes remain the same. Epigenetic inheritance also occurs in humans. Even the effects of famines anddiseases can echo down the generations. The Human Epigenome Project was launchedin 2003, and is helping to coordinate research in this rapidly growing field ofinquiry.19 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos718093] Morphic resonance provides another means by which the inheritance of acquiredcharacteristics can occur. Its effects can be distinguished experimentally fromother forms of epigenetic inheritance, as discussed in chapter 7 and appendix A. Morphogenetic and morphic fields In this book I discuss morphogenetic fields, the organizing fields of molecules,crystals, cells, tissues, and indeed all biological systems. I also discuss theorganizing fields of animal behavior and of social groups. Whereas morphogeneticfields influence form, behavioral fields influence behavior. The organizingfields of social groups, such as flocks of birds, schools of fish, and coloniesof termites, are called social fields. All these kinds of fields are morphicfields. All morphic fields have an inherent memory given by morphic resonance.Morphogenetic fields, the organizing fields of morphogenesis, are one kind ofthe larger category of morphic fields, rather like a species within a genus. InThe Presence of the Past,20 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos718302] Iexplore the wider nature of morphic fields in their behavioral, social, andcultural contexts, and their implications for the understanding of animal andhuman memory. I also suggest that our own memories depend on morphic resonancerather than on material memory traces stored in our brains. The relationship of morphic fields to modern physics One of the paradoxes of twentieth-century science was that quantum theoryushered in a revolutionary change of perspective in physics revealing the limitsof a reductionistic approach, while biology moved in the opposite direction,away from holistic approaches to an extreme reductionism. As the German quantumphysicist Hans-Peter Dürr expressed it: > The original emphasis on the whole in consideration of living things, their> shapes and Gestalts, has been replaced by a fragmenting, functionalist> description, in which, for an explanation of the sequences of events, the> focus is on the substances, matter, and its building blocks, the molecules and> their interactions. The surprising thing about this development from holism> and even vitalism to molecular biology is that it is occurring some decades> after—and not before— a profound change in just the opposite direction took> place at the foundations of natural science, in microphysics, during the first> third of the century that has recently ended. There, fundamental limitations> of the fragmenting, reductionist way of looking at things had become apparent.> Divisible substance revealed in a strange way holistic aspects.21> [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos718503] Many biologists are still trying to reduce the phenomena of life and mind to themechanistic physics of the nineteenth century, but physics has moved on. Andquantum physics provides a far more promising context for morphic fields thananything in classical physics. Morphic fields must in some way interact directlyor indirectly with electromagnetic and quantum fields, imposing patterns ontheir otherwise indeterminate activities. But exactly how this interactionoccurs remains unclear. One possible starting point is the idea of the implicateorder, proposed by the quantum physicist David Bohm. > In the enfolded or implicate order, space and time are no longer the dominant> factors determining the relationships of dependence or independence of> different elements. Rather, an entirely different sort of basic connection of> elements is possible, from which our ordinary notions of space and time, along> with those of separately existent material particles, are abstracted as forms> derived from the deeper order. These ordinary notions in fact appear in what> is called the “explicate” or “unfolded” order, which is a special and> distinguished form contained within the general totality of all the implicate> orders.22 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos719011] The implicate order involves a kind of memory that is expressed through quantumfields, and is compatible in general terms with the ideas put forward in thisbook. A discussion between David Bohm and myself about morphic resonance and theimplicate order is reprinted in appendix B of this book. Hans-Peter Dürr hasalso discussed how “processes of quantum physics might in principle contain afruitful potential for an explanation of Sheldrake’s morphic fields.”23[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos719230] Another way in which morphic resonance and morphic fields might be related tomodern physics is through extra dimensions of space-time. Although ourcommonsense thinking is confined to three dimensions of space and one of time,as in Newtonian physics, physics has moved on by adding further dimensions. Inthe theory of General Relativity, first put forward in 1915, Einstein treatedspace-time as four-dimensional. In the 1920s, in the Kaluza-Klein theory,space-time was extended to five dimensions in an attempt to find a unifiedtheory for gravitational and electromagnetic fields. Modern hopes of unifyingthe known fields of physics, including the strong and weak nuclear forces, aremainly centered on superstring theory, with ten dimensions, or M-theory (shortfor master theory) with eleven.24[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos719571] The value of superstring and M-theory is disputed, but their very existenceshows that extra dimensions are no longer the preserve of esoteric speculations;they are mainstream in modern physics.25[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos719760] But what do these extradimensions do, and what difference do they make? Some physicists propose thatthey include “information fields” that could help to explain the phenomena oflife and mind.26 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos720024] Another possible point of connection between morphic fields and modern physicsis through the quantum vacuum field. According to standard quantum theory, allelectrical and magnetic forces are mediated by virtual photons that appear fromthe quantum vacuum field and then disappear into it again. Thus all moleculeswithin living organisms, all cell membranes, all nerve impulses, and indeed allelectromagnetic and chemical processes depend on virtual photons appearing anddisappearing within the all-pervading vacuum field of nature. Could morphicfields interact with regular physical and chemical processes through the vacuumfield? Some theoreticians speculate that they can and do.27[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos720336] Theories of these kinds may help to relate morphic fields and morphic resonanceto the physics of the future. But at present no one knows how the phenomena ofmorphogenesis are related to physics, whether conventional or unconventional. Experimental tests The experimental tests for morphic resonance proposed in the first edition ofthis book were primarily in the realms of chemistry and biology. However, thegreatest interest they stimulated was in the realm of human psychology.According to the hypothesis of morphic resonance, human beings draw upon acollective memory: something learned by people in one place should subsequentlybecome easier for others to learn all over the world. In 1982, the British magazine New Scientist ran a competition for ideas abouttesting this hypothesis. All the winning ideas were for psychologicalexperiments. At the same time, an American think tank, the Tarrytown Group ofNew York, offered a $10,000 prize for the best test of this hypothesis. Againthe winning entries were in the realm of psychology, and provided evidence thatsupported the morphic resonance hypothesis. These results were summarized in mybook The Presence of the Past. In appendix A, I summarize the results of more-recent morphic resonanceresearch, and propose a range of new tests for morphic resonance in physics,chemistry, biology, psychology, and computer sciences. A new way of doing science Since the 1990s, much of my own experimental research has been concerned withthe role that morphic fields play in social behavior in animals and people. Mystudies on unexplained aspects of animal and human behavior are summarized in mybooks Seven Experiments That Could Change the World (1994), Dogs That Know WhenTheir Owners Are Coming Home (1999), and The Sense of Being Stared At (2003).These investigations were concerned primarily with the spatial aspects ofmorphic fields, rather than with morphic resonance, which gives these fieldstheir temporal or historical aspect. This research is radical in two senses: it proposes not only a new kind ofscientific thinking, but also a new way of doing science. This is the main themeof Seven Experiments That Could Change the World. Many of the experiments totest for morphic fields are simple and inexpensive. They show that science needno longer be the monopoly of a scientific priesthood. Research at the frontiersof science is open to participation by students and by nonprofessionals. Already thousands of nonprofessionals have contributed to this research throughsupplying case histories; through taking part in tests with their animals, suchas dogs, cats, horses, and parrots; and through carrying out experiments withtheir families and friends, or with fellow students in schools, colleges, anduniversities. There have been dozens of student projects on topics related tomorphic fields, including several that have won prizes in science fairs. Much ofthis research is summarized in Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Homeand The Sense of Being Stared At. Meanwhile, any reader who would like to take part in my current experiments cando so through the Online Experiments Portal on my website, www.sheldrake.org[http://www.sheldrake.org]. Some of these experiments are Internet based; otherstake place through mobile telephones. These tests work well as homeworkassignments in schools and colleges. They are fun to do, they illustrate theprinciples of statistics and controlled experimentation, and they make avaluable contribution to research in progress. In the past, some of the most innovative scientific research was carried out byamateurs. Charles Darwin, for example, never held an institutional post. Heworked independently at his home in Kent studying barnacles, keeping pigeons,and doing experiments in the garden with his children. He was just one of manyindependent researchers who, not reliant on grants or constrained by theconservative pressures of anonymous peer review, did highly original work. Todaythat kind of freedom is almost nonexistent. From the latter part of thenineteenth century onward, science has become increasingly professionalized.After the Second World War there was a vast expansion of institutional research.There are now only a handful of independent scientists, the best known beingJames Lovelock, the leading proponent of the Gaia hypothesis. Nevertheless, the conditions for widespread participation in science have becomemore favorable than ever. There are hundreds of thousands of people all over theworld who have had scientific training. Computing power, once the monopoly oflarge organizations, is widely available. The Internet gives access toinformation undreamed of in past decades, and provides an unprecedented means ofcommunication. There are more people with leisure time than ever before. Everyyear thousands of students do scientific research projects as part of theirtraining, and some would welcome the chance to be real pioneers. And manyinformal networks and associations already provide models for self-organizingcommunities of researchers, working both within and outside scientificinstitutions. As in its most creative periods, science can once again be nourished from thegrass roots up. Research can grow from a personal interest in the nature ofnature, an interest that originally impels many people into scientific careersbut is often smothered by the demands of institutional life. Fortunately, aninterest in nature burns as strongly, if not more strongly, in many people whoare not professional scientists. I believe that not only in relation to controversial frontier areas of research,but also in more conventional areas, science needs democratizing. It has alwaysbeen elitist and undemocratic, whether in monarchies, communist states, orliberal democracies. But it is currently becoming more hierarchical, not lessso, and this trend needs remedying. Today, the kinds of research that can happen are determined by science fundingcommittees, not the human imagination. What is more, the power in thosecommittees is increasingly concentrated in the hands of politically adept olderscientists, government officials, and representatives of big business. Younggraduates on short-term contracts constitute a growing scientific underclass. Inthe United States, the proportion of biomedical grants awarded to investigatorsunder thirty-five plummeted from 23 percent in 1980 to 4 percent in 2003. Thisis bad news. As science becomes more and more about climbing corporate careerladders and less and less about soaring journeys of the mind, so the publicdistrust of scientists and their work seems to grow. In 2000, a government-sponsored survey in Britain on public attitudes to sciencerevealed that most people believed that “science is driven by business—at theend of the day it’s all about money.” Over three-quarters of those surveyedagreed, “It is important to have some scientists who are not linked tobusiness.” More than two-thirds thought, “Scientists should listen more to whatordinary people think.” Worried about this public alienation, in 2003 theBritish government said it wanted to engage the wider public in “a dialoguebetween science, policy makers, and the public.” In official circles, thefashion shifted from a “deficit” model of the public understanding ofscience—which sees simple factual education as the key—to an “engagement” modelof science and society. Public participation would involve more than setting up committees ofnonscientists to advise the existing funding bodies. In 2003 in New Scientist28[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos720597] and in 2004 in Nature,29[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos720804] I proposed a more radicalpossibility, namely to set aside a small proportion of the public sciencebudget, say 1 percent, for research proposed by laypeople. What questions would be of public interest? Why not ask? Organizations such ascharities, schools, local authorities, trade unions, environmental groups, andgardening associations could be invited to make suggestions. Within eachorganization, the very possibility of proposing research would probably triggerfar-ranging discussions, and would lead to a sense of involvement in manysections of the population. To avoid the 1 percent fund being taken over by the science establishment, itwould need to be administered by a board largely composed of nonscientists, asin many research charities. Funding would be restricted to areas not alreadycovered by the other 99 percent of the public science budget. This system couldbe treated as an experiment, and tried out for, say, five years. If it had nouseful effects, it could be discontinued. If it led to productive research,greater public trust in science, and increased interest among students, thepercentage allocated to this fund could be increased. I believe this new venturewould make science more attractive to young people, stimulate interest inscientific thinking and hypothesis-testing, and help break down the depressingalienation many people feel from science. Controversies When A New Science of Life was first published in Britain, in 1981, there was awidespread discussion about the idea of morphogenetic fields and morphicresonance. After three months, a now notorious editorial appeared on the frontpage of Nature. Under the title “A book for burning?” the editor condemned myproposals in an extraordinary attack. > Even bad books should not be burned; works such as Mein Kampf have become> historical documents for those concerned with the pathology of politics. But> what is to be made of Dr. Rupert Sheldrake’s book A New Science of Life? This> infuriating tract has been widely hailed by newspapers and popular science> magazines as the “answer” to materialistic science, and it is now well on the> way to becoming a point of reference for the motley crew of creationists,> anti-reductionists, neo-Lamarckians and the rest. The author, by training a> biochemist and by demonstration a knowledgeable man, is, however, misguided.> His book is the best candidate for burning there has been for many years.30> [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos721040] The editor did not advance any reasoned arguments against the hypothesis Iproposed. Instead, he put his hope in the future advances of molecular biology. > Sheldrake’s argument takes off from his catalogue of the ways in which the> molecular biologists, no doubt the shock-troops of the reductionists, have so> far been unable to calculate the phenotype of the single organism from a> knowledge of its genotype. But so what? Have not the past 20 years shown> clearly enough that molecular explanations of most biological phenomena are,> contrary to some earlier expectations, possible and powerful? The editor, the late Sir John Maddox, also dismissed my proposals forexperiments as “impractical in the sense that no self-respecting grant-makingagency will take the proposal seriously.” This editorial was followed by correspondence in Nature, continuing for months,in which many scientists objected to the intemperate tone of this attack andsupported the need for radical thinking about the unsolved problems ofscience.31 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos721251] One of the letterswas from the quantum physicist Brian Josephson, a Nobel laureate. > The rapid advances in molecular biology to which you refer do not mean very> much. If one is on a journey, rapid progress on the way implies neither that> one is close to one’s destination, nor that the destination will be reached at> all by continuing to follow the same road. By referring to “self-respecting> grant-making agencies” you show a concern not for scientific validity but for> respectability. The fundamental weakness is a failure to admit even the> possibility that genuine physical facts may exist which lie outside the scope> of current scientific descriptions.

These> developments have not yet penetrated to the leading journals. One can only> hope that the editors will soon cease to obstruct this avenue of progress.32> [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos721482] In 1994, BBC television interviewed John Maddox about his outburst. He wasunrepentant, saying, “Sheldrake is putting forward magic instead of science, andthat can be condemned in exactly the language that the Pope used to condemnGalileo, and for the same reason. It is heresy.”33[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos721686] Perhaps he was unaware that twoyears earlier, on 15 July 1992, Pope John Paul II formally declared that thechurch had erred in condemning Galileo. In the German-speaking countries, there were many articles and discussions ofthis hypothesis by scientists, philosophers, psychologists, and others. Some oftheir varied reactions were brought together in a book published in German in1997 entitled Rupert Sheldrake in der Diskussion.34[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos721850] In the 1980s and 1990s many people within the scientific community, like theeditor of Nature, were confident that more research on gene sequences andmolecular mechanisms would reveal almost all we need to know about life,explaining the mysteries of biological form, instinctive behavior, learning, andeven consciousness itself. Several leading scientists believed that science wasnearing its ultimate culmination; all the important discoveries had already beenmade. This mood was summed up in 1996 in John Horgan’s bestselling book The Endof Science: Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the Twilight of the ScientificAge. As Horgan expressed it: > If one believes in science, one must accept the possibility—even the> probability—that the great era of scientific discovery is over. By science I> mean not applied science, but science at its purest and grandest, the> primordial human quest to understand the universe and our place in it. Further> research may yield no more great revelations or revolutions, but only> incremental, diminishing returns.35> [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos722085] Fortunately, science has not come to an end despite the sequencing of the humangenome, the avalanche of data in molecular biology, the boom in brain scanning,the speculations of superstring theorists, and the discovery that more than 90percent of the universe is made up of dark matter and dark energy, whose natureis literally obscure. The unsolved problems of biology summarized in chapter 1 were unsolved in 1981,and they are still unsolved today. The questions discussed in this book remaincompletely open. The debate continues; and by reading this book, you can be partof it. "},{"pageContent":"image [images/00003.jpg] INTRODUCTION At present, the orthodox approach to biology is given by the mechanistic theoryof life: living organisms are regarded as physico-chemical machines, and all thephenomena of life are considered to be explicable in principle in terms ofphysics and chemistry.1 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos722483] Thismechanistic paradigm2 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos722719] is by nomeans new; it has been predominant for well over a century. The main reason mostbiologists continue to adhere to it is that it works: it provides a framework ofthought within which questions about the physico-chemical mechanisms of lifeprocesses can be asked and answered. The fact that this approach has resulted in spectacular successes such as the“cracking of the genetic code” is a strong argument in its favor. Nevertheless,critics have put forward what seem to be good reasons for doubting that all thephenomena of life, including human behavior, can ever be explained entirelymechanistically.3 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos722962] But even ifthe mechanistic approach were admitted to be severely limited not only inpractice but in principle, it could not simply be abandoned; at present it isalmost the only approach available to experimental biology, and will undoubtedlycontinue to be followed until there is some positive alternative. Any new theory capable of extending or going beyond the mechanistic theory willhave to do more than assert that life involves qualities or factors at presentunrecognized by the physical sciences: it will have to say what sorts of thingsthese qualities or factors are, how they work, and what relationship they haveto known physical and chemical processes. The simplest way in which the mechanistic theory could be modified would be tosuppose that the phenomena of life depend on a new type of causal factor,unknown to the physical sciences, which interacts with physico-chemicalprocesses within living organisms. Several versions of this vitalist theory wereproposed in the early twentieth century,4[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos723768] but none succeeded in makingpredictions that could be tested, or suggested new kinds of experiments. If, toquote Sir Karl Popper, “the criterion of the scientific status of a theory isits falsifiability, or refutability, or testability,”5[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos724292] vitalism failed to qualify. However, the organismic or holistic philosophy of nature provides a context fora more radical revision of the mechanistic theory. This philosophy denies thateverything in the universe can be explained from the bottom up, as it were, interms of the properties of subatomic particles, or atoms, or even molecules.Rather, it recognizes the existence of hierarchically organized systems that, ateach level of complexity, possess properties that cannot be fully understood interms of the properties exhibited by their parts in isolation from each other;at each level the whole is more than the sum of its parts. These wholes can bethought of as organisms, using this term in a deliberately wide sense to includenot only animals and plants, organs, tissues, and cells, but also crystals,molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles. In effect this philosophy proposes achange from the paradigm of the machine to the paradigm of the organism in thebiological and in the physical sciences. In Alfred North Whitehead’s well-knownphrase: “Biology is the study of the larger organisms, whereas physics is thestudy of the smaller organisms.”6[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos724509] Various versions of this organismic philosophy have been advocated by manywriters, including biologists, since the 1920s.7[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos724731] But if organicism is to havemore than a superficial influence on the natural sciences, it must be able togive rise to testable predictions.8[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos725605] The most important organismic concept put forward so far is that ofmorphogenetic fields.9 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos726356] Thesefields are supposed to help account for, or describe, the coming-into-being ofthe characteristic forms of embryos and other developing systems. The trouble isthat this concept has been used ambiguously. The term itself seems to imply theexistence of a new type of physical field that plays a role in the developmentof form. But some organismic theoreticians deny that they are suggesting theexistence of any new type of field, entity, or factor at present unrecognized byphysics;10 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos726588] rather, they areproviding a new way of talking about complex physico-chemical systems.11[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos726983] This approach seems unlikely tolead very far. The concept of morphogenetic fields can be of practicalscientific value only if it leads to testable predictions that differ from thoseof the conventional mechanistic theory. And such predictions cannot be madeunless morphogenetic fields are considered to have measurable effects. The hypothesis put forward in this book is based on the idea that morphogeneticfields do indeed have measurable physical effects. It proposes that specificmorphogenetic fields are responsible for the characteristic form andorganization of systems at all levels of complexity, not only in the realm ofbiology, but also in the realms of chemistry and physics. These fields order thesystems with which they are associated by affecting events that, from anenergetic point of view, appear to be indeterminate or probabilistic; theyimpose patterned restrictions on the energetically possible outcomes of physicalprocesses. If morphogenetic fields are responsible for the organization and form ofmaterial systems, they must themselves have characteristic structures. So wheredo these field structures come from? They are derived from the morphogeneticfields associated with previous similar systems: the morphogenetic fields of allpast systems become present to any subsequent similar system; the structures ofpast systems affect subsequent similar systems by a cumulative influence thatacts across both space and time. According to this hypothesis, systems are organized in the way they are becausesimilar systems were organized that way in the past. For example, the moleculesof a complex organic chemical crystallize in a characteristic pattern becausethe same substance crystallized that way before; a plant takes up the formcharacteristic of its species because past members of the species took up thatform; and an animal acts instinctively in a particular manner because similaranimals behaved like that previously. The hypothesis is concerned with the repetition of forms and patterns oforganization; the question of the origin of these forms and patterns liesoutside its scope. This question can be answered in several different ways, butall of them seem to be equally compatible with the suggested means ofrepetition.12 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos727292] A number of testable predictions, which differ strikingly from those of theconventional mechanistic theory, can be deduced from this hypothesis. A singleexample will suffice: If an animal, say a rat, learns to carry out a new patternof behavior, there will be a tendency for any subsequent similar rat (of thesame breed, reared under similar conditions, etc.) to learn more quickly tocarry out the same pattern of behavior. The larger the number of rats that learnto perform the task, the easier it should be for any subsequent similar rat tolearn it. Thus, for instance, if thousands of rats were trained to perform a newtask in a laboratory in London, similar rats should learn to carry out the sametask more quickly in laboratories everywhere else. If the speed of learning ofrats in another laboratory, say in New York, were to be measured before andafter the rats in London were trained, the rats tested on the second occasionshould learn more quickly than those tested on the first. The effect should takeplace in the absence of any known type of physical connection or communicationbetween the two laboratories. Such a prediction may seem so improbable as to be absurd. Yet, remarkablyenough, there is already evidence from laboratory studies of rats that thepredicted effect actually occurs.13[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos727479] This hypothesis, called the hypothesis of formative causation, leads to aninterpretation of many physical and biological phenomena that is radicallydifferent from that of existing theories, and enables a number of well-knownproblems to be seen in a new light. In this book, it is sketched out in apreliminary form, some of its implications are discussed, and various ways inwhich it could be tested are suggested. "},{"pageContent":"1 image [images/00003.jpg] THE UNSOLVED PROBLEMS OF BIOLOGY 1.1 The background of success In the world of science, the predominant theory of life is mechanistic. Livingorganisms are machines. They have no souls or mysterious vital principles; theycan be fully explained in terms of physics and chemistry. This is not a newidea: it dates back to the philosopher René Descartes (1596–1650). In 1867, T.H. Huxley summed it up as follows: > Zoological physiology is the doctrine of the functions or actions of animals.> It regards animal bodies as machines impelled by various forces and performing> a certain amount of work that can be expressed in terms of the ordinary forces> of nature. The final object of physiology is to deduce the facts of morphology> on the one hand, and those of ecology on the other, from the laws of the> molecular forces of matter.1 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos727797] The subsequent developments of physiology, biochemistry, biophysics, genetics,and molecular biology are all foreshadowed in these ideas. In many respectsthese sciences have been brilliantly successful, none more so than molecularbiology. The discovery of the structure of DNA, the “cracking of the geneticcode,” the elucidation of the mechanism of protein synthesis, and the sequencingof the human genome seem impressive confirmations of the validity of thisapproach. The most articulate advocates of the mechanistic theory are molecularbiologists. Their accounts usually begin with a brief dismissal of the vitalistand organismic theories. These are defined as survivals of “primitive” beliefsthat are bound to retreat further and further as mechanistic biology advances.They then proceed along the following lines:2[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos727988] > The chemical nature of the genetic material, DNA, is now known and so is the> genetic code by which it codes for the sequence of amino acids in proteins.> The mechanism of protein synthesis is understood in considerable detail. The> structure of many proteins has now been worked out. All enzymes are proteins,> and enzymes catalyze the complex chains and cycles of biochemical reactions> that constitute the metabolism of an organism. Metabolism is controlled by> biochemical feedback; several mechanisms are known by which the rates of> enzymic activity can be regulated. Proteins and nucleic acids aggregate> spontaneously to form structures such as viruses and ribosomes. Given the> range of properties of proteins, plus the properties of other physicochemical> systems such as lipid membranes, plus complex systems of physicochemical> interaction, the properties of living cells can, in principle, be fully> explained. > The key to the problems of differentiation and development, about which very> little is known, is the understanding of the control of protein synthesis. The> way in which the synthesis of certain metabolic enzymes and other proteins is> controlled is understood in detail in the bacterium Escherichia coli. The> control of protein synthesis takes place by more complicated mechanisms in> higher organisms, but we now know more about them than ever before. In due> course, differentiation and development should be explicable in terms of> series of chemically operated “switches,” which “switch on” or “switch off ”> genes or groups of genes. Major systems of switches are already known, such as> the homeobox genes.3 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos728623] > The way in which the parts of living organisms are adapted to the functions of> the whole, and the apparent purposiveness of the structure and behavior of> living organisms, depends on random genetic mutations followed by natural> selection: those genes that increase the ability of an organism to survive and> reproduce will be selected for; harmful mutations will be eliminated. Thus the> neo-Darwinian theory of evolution can account for purposiveness; it is totally> unnecessary to suppose that any mysterious “vital factors” are involved. > More and more is known about the functioning of the central nervous system,> and the advances of biochemistry, biophysics, electrophysiology and brain> scanning are already helping us to explain what we speak of as the mind in> terms of physical and chemical mechanisms in the brain.

In the light of past successes, optimism that all the problems of biology canultimately be solved mechanistically is understandable. But a realistic opinionabout the prospects for mechanistic explanation must depend on more than an actof faith; it can be formed only after a consideration of the outstandingproblems of biology, and how they might be solved. 1.2 The problems of morphogenesis Biological morphogenesis can be defined as the “coming-into-being ofcharacteristic and specific form in living organisms.”5[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos729059] The first problem is preciselythat form comes into being: new structures appear, such as eyes and flowers,which cannot be explained in terms of structures already present in the egg.There are no miniature eyes in an eagle’s eggs, or miniature flowers in foxgloveseeds. The second problem is that many developing systems can regulate; in other words,if a part of a developing system is removed (or if an additional part is added),the system continues to develop in such a way that a more or less normalstructure is produced. The classical demonstration of this phenomenon was inHans Driesch’s experiments on sea-urchin embryos. When one of the cells of avery young embryo at the two-celled stage was killed, the remaining cell gaverise not to half a sea urchin but to a small but complete sea urchin. Similarly,small but complete organisms developed after the destruction of any one, two, orthree cells of embryos at the four-celled stage. Conversely, the fusion of twoyoung sea-urchin embryos resulted in the development of one giant sea urchin.6[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos729289] Regulation occurs in all developing organisms, in animals and plants. Inanimals, as development proceeds, this capacity is often lost as the fate ofdifferent regions of the embryo becomes determined, as in limbs and livers. Buteven when determination occurs at an early stage, as in insect embryos,regulation still occurs after damage to the egg (see figure 1). Results of this type show that developing plants and animals proceed toward amorphological goal. They have some property that specifies this goal and enablesthem to reach it, even if parts of the system are removed and the normal courseof development is disturbed. The third problem is regeneration. Organisms replace or restore damagedstructures. Many plants have almost unlimited regenerative abilities. If thetrunk, branches, and twigs of a willow tree are cut up into hundreds of pieces,all can grow into new trees. Some animals also regenerate from parts. Aflatworm, for example, can be cut up into several pieces that all grow into newworms. image [images/00005.jpg]Figure 1. An example of regulation. On the left is a normal embryo of thedragonfly Platycnemis pennipes. On the right is a small but complete embryoformed from the posterior half of an egg ligated around the middle soon afterlaying. (After Weiss, 1939) Some vertebrates show striking powers of regeneration. If the lens is surgicallyremoved from a newt’s eye, a new lens regenerates from the edge of the iris(figure 2); in normal embryonic development, the lens is formed in a verydifferent way, from the skin. The German biologist Gustav Wolff studied thistype of regeneration in the 1890s. He deliberately chose a kind of mutilationthat would not have occurred accidentally in nature; there would therefore havebeen no natural selection for this regenerative process.7[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos729504] image [images/00006.jpg]Figure 2. Regeneration of a lens from the margin of the iris in a newt’s eyeafter the surgical removal of the original lens. (Cf. Needham, 1942) The fourth problem is posed by the simple fact of reproduction: a detached partof the parent becomes a new organism; a part becomes a whole. image [images/00004.jpg]The only way in which these phenomena can be understood is in terms of causesthat are somehow more than the sum of the parts, and which determine the goalsof the processes of development. Vitalists ascribe these properties to vital factors, organicists to systemsproperties or morphogenetic fields, and mechanists to genetic programs. The concept of genetic programs is based on an analogy with computer programs.The metaphor implies that the fertilized egg contains a preformed program thatsomehow coordinates the organism’s development. But the genetic program mustinvolve something more than the chemical structure of DNA, because identicalcopies of DNA are passed on to all cells; if all cells were programmedidentically, they could not develop differently. So what exactly is it? Inresponse to this question, the idea can only disintegrate into vague suggestionsabout physico-chemical interactions structured in time and space; the problem ismerely restated.8 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos729696] There is a further problem with the program metaphor. A computer program is putinto a computer by an intelligent conscious being, the computer programmer. Itis intelligently designed in order to achieve a computational goal. Insofar asthe genetic program is analogous to computer software, it implies the existenceof a purposive mind that plays the role of the programmer. Mechanists reject the idea that developing organisms are under the control of avital factor that guides them to their morphological goals. But insofar asmechanistic explanations depend on teleological concepts such as geneticprograms or genetic instructions, goal-directedness can be explained onlybecause it has already been smuggled in. Indeed the properties attributed togenetic programs are remarkably similar to those with which vitalists endowedtheir hypothetical vital factors; ironically, the genetic program seems to bevery like a vital factor in a mechanistic guise.9[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos730207] In Richard Dawkins’s concept of the “selfish gene,” the genes themselves havecome to life. They are like little people: they are as ruthless and competitiveas “successful Chicago gangsters”; they have powers to “mold matter,” to “createform,” to “choose,” and even “aspire to immortality.”10[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos730447] Dawkins’s rhetoric isvitalistic. His selfish genes are miniaturized vital factors. Nevertheless, the fact that biological morphogenesis cannot be explained in arigorously mechanistic manner at present does not prove that it never will be.The prospects for arriving at such an explanation in the future are consideredin the next chapter. 1.3 Behavior If the problems of morphogenesis are dauntingly difficult, those of behavior areeven more so. First, instinct. Consider, for example, how spiders are able tospin webs without learning from other spiders.11[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos730653] Or consider the behavior ofEuropean cuckoos. The young are hatched and reared by birds of other species,and never see their parents. Toward the end of the summer, the adult cuckoosmigrate to their other home in southern Africa. About a month later, the youngcuckoos congregate together and they also migrate to southern Africa, where theyjoin their elders.12 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos730886] Theyinstinctively migrate and know when to migrate; they instinctively recognizeother young cuckoos and congregate together; and they instinctively know inwhich direction they should fly and how to find their ancestral habitats insouthern Africa, after flying unaccompanied over the Straits of Gibraltar andthe Sahara Desert. Second, there is the problem posed by the goal-directedness of animal behavior.Even if an animal is prevented from reaching its goal in one way, it may getthere by another. For example, a dog after amputation of a leg learns how towalk on three legs rather than four. Another dog after brain damage graduallyrecovers most of its previous abilities. A third dog has obstacles put in itspath. But all three dogs can go from one place to another place they want to getto in spite of disturbances to their limbs, central nervous systems, andenvironments. Third, there is the problem of intelligent behavior; new patterns of behaviorappear that cannot be explained entirely in terms of preceding causes. Animalscan be creative. An enormous gulf of ignorance lies between these phenomena and the sciences ofmolecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, and neurophysiology. How can the migratory behavior of young cuckoos ultimately be explained in termsof DNA, protein synthesis, and molecular cell biology? Obviously a satisfactoryexplanation would require more than a demonstration that appropriate genescontaining appropriate base-sequences in DNA were necessary for this behavior,or that the behavior of cuckoos depends on electrical impulses in nerves; itwould require some understanding of the connections between specific sequencesof bases in DNA, the birds’ nervous system, and the migratory behavior. Atpresent, these connections can be provided only by the same elusive entitiesthat “explain” all the phenomena of morphogenesis: genetic programs, vitalfactors, system properties, or morphogenetic fields. In any case, an understanding of behavior presupposes an understanding ofmorphogenesis. Even if all the behavior of a relatively simple animal, say anematode worm, could be understood in detail in terms of the “wiring” andphysiology of its nervous system, there would still be the problem of how thenervous system was wired so precisely in the first place. 1.4 Evolution Long before Mendelian genetics was thought of, plant and animal breedersdeveloped many varieties of cultivated plants and domesticated animals, likeDamascene roses and Pharaoh hounds. Selective breeding was the basis of theirsuccess. Charles Darwin argued persuasively that a comparable development ofraces and varieties occurred in the wild under the influence of natural ratherthan artificial selection. Darwin also believed that habits acquired by plants and animals could beinherited.13 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos731086] The neo-Darwiniantheory of evolution agrees about the importance of natural selection but rejectsthe inheritance of habits, and tries instead to explain all evolutionaryinnovation in terms of random genetic mutations, which is why it isneo-Darwinian rather than Darwinian. Everyone agrees that mutation and natural selection can lead to the formation ofvarieties or subspecies. But there is no general agreement among evolutionarybiologists that gradual microevolution within a species can account for theorigin of species themselves, or genera, families, and higher taxonomicdivisions. One school of thought holds that all large-scale evolution, ormacroevolution, can indeed be explained in terms of long-continued processes ofmicroevolution;14 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos731324] the otherschool denies this, and postulates that major jumps occur suddenly in the courseof evolution.15 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos731752] But whileopinions differ as to the relative importance of many small mutations or a fewlarge ones, there is general agreement that mutations are random, and thatevolution can be explained by a combination of random mutation and naturalselection. This theory is inevitably speculative. The evidence for evolution is open to avariety of interpretations. Opponents of neo-Darwinism can argue thatevolutionary innovations are not entirely explicable in terms of chance events,but are due to the activity of a creative principle unrecognized by mechanisticscience. Moreover, the selection pressures arising from the behavior andproperties of living organisms may themselves depend on inner organizing factorsthat are essentially non-mechanistic. Thus the problem of evolution cannot be solved conclusively. Organismic theoriesnecessarily involve an extrapolation of organismic ideas, just as theneo-Darwinian theory involves an extrapolation of mechanistic ideas. 1.5 The origin of life This problem of the origin of life is just as insoluble as that of evolution,for the same reasons. What happened in the distant past can never be known forcertain; there will probably always be a plethora of speculations. Scenarios forlife’s origin include its spontaneous appearance in a primeval broth on Earth;the infection of the Earth by microorganisms deliberately sent on a space shipby intelligent beings on a planet in another solar system;16[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos732171] and the evolution of life oncomets containing organic materials derived from interstellar dust.17[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos732400] Even if the conditions under which life originated were known, this informationwould shed no light on the nature of life. Assuming it could be demonstrated,for example, that the first living organisms arose from nonliving chemicalaggregates or “hypercycles” of chemical processes18[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos732594] in a primeval broth, this wouldnot prove that they were entirely mechanistic. Organicists would argue that neworganismic properties emerged in the first living system precisely when it cameto life. The same arguments would apply even if living organisms were to besynthesized artificially from chemicals in a test tube. 1.6 Minds The mechanistic theory postulates that all the phenomena of life, includinghuman behavior, can in principle be explained in terms of physics. It is a formof materialism or physicalism, the theory that only material or physical thingsexist; they are the only reality. Materialism is opposed to the more commonsenseview that minds affect bodies, and are capable of interacting with them.19[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos732825] Materialism runs into logical problems from the outset: attempting to explainmental activity in terms of physical science is circular, because science itselfdepends on mental activity.20 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos733166]This problem became apparent within modern physics in connection with the roleof the observer in processes of physical measurement; the principles of physics“cannot even be formulated without referring (though in some versions onlyimplicitly) to the impressions—and thus to the minds—of the observers” (BernardD’Espagnat).21 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos733447] Since physicspresupposes the minds of observers, these minds cannot be explained in terms ofphysics.22 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos733686] Among materialist philosophers of mind, the most extreme stance is calledeliminative materialism. This philosophy claims that beliefs and feelings haveno coherent definition and play no part in the scientific understanding of thebrain. The neuroscience of the future will have no need for outmoded conceptslike beliefs and feelings; they will join previously discarded concepts likephlogiston and vital forces. Minds will be explained completely in terms of theobjectively measurable activity of the nervous system.23[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos734304] Another materialist approach to the problem of consciousness is to admit that itexists while denying it does anything. This view is called epiphenomenalism, theclaim that “mental events are caused by physical events in the brain althoughmental events themselves do not cause anything.”24[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos734568] As the philosopher Alex Hyslophas put it, “The case for epiphenomenalism is the case for materialism, togetherwith the case against materialism. The case for materialism is the argument fromscience, from a triumphant, or at least steadily triumphing science. The caseagainst materialism is that there are features of our conscious experience thatare not accounted for by science.”25[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos734850] In psychology, the science of the mind, there are different schools of thoughtabout the relationship between mind and body. The most extreme materialistsolution is to deny the reality of the mind and to assume that only the body isreal. This was the approach of the Behaviorist school, which dominated academicpsychology for much of the twentieth century. Behaviorists confined theirattention to objectively observable behavior and ignored the existence ofconsciousness.26 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos735100] Butbehaviorism was not a testable scientific hypothesis; it was a methodology.27[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos735467] It is now out of fashion withinacademic psychology, and has largely been replaced by cognitive psychology. Like behaviorism, cognitive psychology rejects introspection, but it admits theexistence of internal mental states, such as belief, desires, and motivations.Its dominant metaphor is the computer. Mental activity is thought of as“information processing.” But the limitations of the computer metaphor arebecoming increasingly apparent, not least through a new recognition of the roleof the emotions28 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos735877] and anacknowledgment that minds are embodied and actively related to theenvironment.29 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos736112] In the 1990s, the philosopher David Chalmers made a distinction between what hecalled the “easy problems” of consciousness, like finding neural correlates ofsensation—for example, which parts of the brain become active during the visualperception of moving objects—and the “hard problem.” The hard problem is, “Whydoes awareness of sensory information exist at all?” There is a radicaldistinction between the biology of the brain and mental experience, whichincludes the experience of qualities, such as red. (Philosophers of mind callthese subjective experiences “qualia.”) Chalmers argues that to takeconsciousness seriously, it is necessary to go beyond a strict materialistframework.30 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos736375] Unlike the materialist psychologies that predominate within academicinstitutions, other schools of psychology accept subjective experience as theirstarting point, but also recognize that not all mental activity is conscious:many aspects of behavior and subjective experience depend on the subconscious orunconscious mind. The unconscious mind may also have properties that defymechanistic explanation. For example, in Carl Jung’s development of thisconcept, the unconscious is not confined to individual minds, but provides acommon substratum shared by all human minds, the collective unconscious. > In addition to our immediate consciousness, which is of a thoroughly personal> nature and which we believe to be the only empirical psyche (even if we tack> on the personal unconscious as an appendix) there exists a second psychic> system of a collective, universal, and impersonal nature which is identical in> all individuals. This collective unconscious does not develop individually but> is inherited. It consists of pre-existent forms, the archetypes, which can> only become conscious secondarily and which give definite form to certain> psychic contents.31 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos736615] Jung tried to explain the inheritance of the collective unconscious physicallyby suggesting that the archetypal forms were “present in the germplasm.”32[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos736849] But it is doubtful thatanything with the properties of the archetypal forms could be inheritedchemically in the structure of DNA, or in any other physical or chemicalstructure in sperm or egg cells. Indeed the idea of the collective unconsciousmakes little sense in terms of current mechanistic biology, whatever its meritsas a psychological theory might be. However, there is no a priori reason why psychological theories should beconfined within the framework of the mechanistic theory. Mental phenomena neednot necessarily depend on the known laws of physics, but may depend onprinciples as yet unrecognized by science. 1.7 Parapsychology In all traditional societies, stories are told of men and women with seeminglymiraculous powers, and such powers are acknowledged by all religions. In manyparts of the world, various psychic abilities are cultivated within systems suchas shamanism, sorcery, tantric yoga, and spiritualism. And even within modernWestern society, there are persistent reports of unexplained phenomena, such astelepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, memories of past lives, hauntings,poltergeists, psychokinesis, and so on. Surveys show that the most common kindof telepathy occurs in connection with technology, namely telephone telepathy,whereby people think of someone for no apparent reason who calls soonafterward.33 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos736981] Although dogmatic skeptics dismiss all this evidence out of hand,34[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos737219] the possibility that at leastsome of these events actually occur is an open question. It can be answered onlyafter an examination of the evidence. The scientific study of allegedly psychic phenomena has now been going on formore than a century. Investigators in this field of psychic research havediscovered some cases of fraud, and found that some apparently paranormal eventscan in fact be explained by normal causes. But there remains a large body ofevidence that seems to defy explanation in terms of any known physicalprinciples.35 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos737433] Numerousexperiments designed to test for so-called extrasensory perception have yieldedpositive results with odds against chance coincidence of thousands, millions, oreven billions to one.36 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos737975] Insofar as these phenomena cannot be explained in terms of the known laws ofphysics and chemistry, from the mechanistic point of view they ought not tooccur.37 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos738560] But if they do, thenthere are two possible approaches. The first is to suppose that they depend onnonphysical causal factors or connecting principles.38[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos738827] The second is to start from theassumption that they depend on laws of physics as yet unknown, or on extensionsof quantum theory,39 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos739107] forexample by postulating that mental states play a role in determining theoutcomes of probabilistic processes of physical change.40[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos739301] 1.8 Conclusions This brief consideration of the outstanding problems of biology does not offermuch hope that they can all be solved by an exclusively mechanistic approach. Inthe case of morphogenesis and animal behavior, the question is open. Theproblems of evolution and the origin of life are insoluble per se and cannothelp to decide between the mechanistic and other possible theories of life. Themechanistic theory runs into serious philosophical difficulties in connectionwith the problem of the limits of physical explanation; in relation topsychology, it leads to seemingly insoluble problems; and it is in conflict withthe apparent evidence for parapsychological phenomena. The prospects for improved versions of mechanistic, vitalist, and organismictheories are discussed in the following chapter. Morphogenesis is the startingpoint. "},{"pageContent":"2 image [images/00003.jpg] THREE THEORIES OF MORPHOGENESIS 2.1 Descriptive and experimental research The description of development can be carried out in many ways: the externalform of the developing animal or plant can be drawn, photographed, or filmed,providing a series of pictures of its changing morphology; its internalstructure, including its microscopic anatomy, can be described at successivestages (see figure 3); changes in physical quantities such as weight, volume,and rate of oxygen consumption can be measured; and changes in the chemicalcomposition of the system as a whole and of regions within it can be analyzed. The progressive improvement of techniques permits such descriptions to be madein ever greater detail; for example, with the electron microscope the processesof cellular differentiation can be studied at a far higher resolution than withthe light microscope, enabling many new structures to be seen; the sensitiveanalytical methods of modern molecular biology enable changes in concentrationsof specific molecules, including proteins and nucleic acids, to be measured invery small samples of tissue; by means of radioactive isotopes or fluorescentantibodies, chemical structures can be “labeled” and “traced” as a systemdevelops; and techniques for inducing genetic changes in some of the cells ofembryos enable their genetically “marked” descendants to be identified and theirfate to be “mapped.” image [images/00007.jpg]Figure 3. Stages in the development of the embryo of the shepherd’s purse plant,Capsella bursa-pastoris. (After Maheshwari, 1950) The majority of research in cell and developmental biology is concerned withproviding factual descriptions by means of such techniques; these descriptionsare then classified and compared in order to establish how different sorts ofchanges are correlated within a given system, and in what ways different systemsresemble each other. These purely descriptive results cannot in themselves leadto an understanding of the causes of development, although they may suggesthypotheses.1 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos740103] The latter canthen be investigated by means of experimental perturbations of development: forexample, the environment can be changed; physical or chemical stimuli can beapplied to specific places on or in a system; parts of the system can be removedand their development studied in isolation; the reaction of the system to theremoval of parts can be observed; and the effects of combining different partscan be studied by grafts and transplantations. The major problems thrown up by this type of research have been summarized insection 1.2: biological development involves an increase in complexity of formand organization that cannot be explained in terms of the unfolding of apreformed but invisible structure; many developing systems can regulate, i.e.,produce a more or less normal structure if part of the system is destroyed orremoved at a sufficiently early stage; many systems can regenerate or replacemissing parts; and in vegetative and sexual reproduction, new organisms areformed from detached parts of parent organisms. One further importantgeneralization is that in developing systems the destiny of cells and tissues isdetermined by their position within the system. Mechanistic, vitalist, and organismic theories all start from this establishedbody of facts, about which there is general agreement, but they differ radicallyin their interpretations. 2.2 Mechanism The modern mechanistic theory of morphogenesis ascribes a role of primeimportance to DNA, for four main reasons. First, many cases of hereditarydifferences between animals or plants of a given species have been found todepend on genes, which can be “mapped” and located at particular places onparticular chromosomes. Second, the chemical basis of genes is known to be DNAand their specificity is known to depend on the sequence of purine andpyrimidine bases in the DNA. Third, it is known how DNA is able to act as thechemical basis of heredity: on the one hand, it serves as a template for its ownreplication, owing to the specificity of the pairing of the bases in its twocomplementary strands; on the other hand, it serves as the template for thesequence of amino acids in proteins. It does not play the latter role directly;one of its strands is first “transcribed” to give a single-stranded molecule of“messenger” RNA from which, in the process of protein synthesis, the sequence ofbases is “read off ” three at a time. Different triplets of bases specifydifferent amino acids, and thus the genetic code is “translated” into a sequenceof amino acids, which are linked together to give characteristic polypeptidechains, which then fold up to give proteins. Finally, the characteristics of acell depend on its proteins: its metabolism and its capacities for chemicalsynthesis on enzymes, some of its structures on structural proteins, and thesurface properties that enable it to be “recognized” by other cells on specialproteins on its surface. Within the mechanistic framework of thought, the central problem of developmentand morphogenesis is seen as the control of protein synthesis. In bacteria,specific chemicals called inducers can cause specific regions of the DNA to betranscribed into messenger RNA, on which template specific proteins are thenmade. The classic example is the induction of the enzyme β-galactosidase bylactose in Escherichia coli. The “switching on” of the gene takes place througha complicated system involving a repressor protein that blocks transcription bycombining with a specific region of the DNA; its tendency to do so is greatlyreduced in the presence of the chemical inducer. By a comparable process,specific chemical repressors can “switch off ” genes. In animals and plants a range of developmental genes have now been identifiedthat are concerned with the regulation of the overall body plan and the number,identity, and pattern of body parts. These genes are usually called the “genetictoolkit.” The most surprising discovery of developmental biology in the 1990swas that these tool-kit genes are remarkably similar, indeed almost identical,in widely different organisms. For example, the “homeobox” family of genes thataffect the patterning of the body axis in fruit flies, mice, and humans are verysimilar, and yet the body forms of these organisms are obviously very different.As the molecular biologist Sean B. Carroll and his colleagues have put it, “Theconservation of the genetic toolkit provokes many developmental and evolutionaryquestions. How do such different structures as the insect compound eye and thevertebrate lens-type eye develop when their formation is controlled by suchsimilar, even functionally interchangeable genes?”2[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos740499] This convergence of developmental and evolutionary biology has created a newfield called evolutionary developmental biology (“evodevo” for short). Most tool-kit genes code for proteins that affect the activity of other genesinvolved in the developmental process, and are part of “signaling pathways.”Some of them code for receptor proteins on cell surfaces that bind to specificmolecules that act as signals. In the early days of molecular biology, there seemed to be a simple,straightforward picture: one gene was transcribed into one messenger RNAmolecule, which coded for one protein. But the picture has grown morecomplicated. Messenger RNA can be made up of pieces transcribed from differentregions of the DNA, and subsequently joined together in a specific way.Moreover, the synthesis of proteins is also controlled at the “translationallevel”; protein synthesis can be “switched” on and off by a variety of factorseven in the presence of appropriate messenger RNA. The different proteins made by different types of cells thus depend on the wayin which protein synthesis is controlled. The only way in which this can beunderstood mechanistically is in terms of physical and chemical influences onthe cells; patterns of differentiation must therefore depend on physical andchemical patterns within the tissue. These are concentration gradients ofspecific chemicals called morpho-gens; these include diffusion-reaction systemswith chemical feedback, electrical gradients, electrical or chemicaloscillations, mechanical contacts between cells, or various other factors orcombinations of different factors. The cells must then respond to thesedifferences in characteristic ways. One way of thinking about this problem is toregard these physical or chemical factors as providing “positional information”that the cells then “interpret” in accordance with their genetic program by“switching on” the synthesis of particular proteins.3[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos740789] These various aspects of the central problem of the control of protein synthesisare at present under active investigation. Most biologists hope that thesolution of this problem will provide, or at least lead toward, an explanationof morphogenesis in purely mechanistic terms. In order to assess whether such a mechanistic explanation is likely, or evenpossible, a number of difficulties need to be considered one by one. (1) The explanatory role of DNA and the synthesis of specific proteins areseverely restricted in their scope by the fact that both the DNA and theproteins of different species may be very similar. For example, in a detailedcomparison of human and chimpanzee proteins, many are identical and othersdiffer only slightly: “Amino acid sequencing, immunological and electrophoreticmethods yield concordant estimates of genetic resemblance. These approaches allindicate that the average human polypeptide is more than 99 percent identical toits chimpanzee counterpart.”4 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos741045]Comparisons of the so-called non-repeated DNA sequences (i.e., those partsbelieved to be of genetic significance) show that the overall difference betweenthe DNA sequences of humans and chimpanzees is only 1.1 percent. Now that bothgenomes have been sequenced, even more detailed comparisons are possible, but asSvante Paabo, the director of the chimpanzee genome project, commented, “Wecannot see in this why we are so different from chimpanzees.”5[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos741305] Comparisons between closely related species in the genus Drosophila haverevealed larger differences among these species of fruit fly than between humansand chimpanzees. Different species of mice are also more dissimilar than humansand chimpanzees, leading to the conclusion that “the contrasts betweenorganismal and molecular evolution indicate that the two processes are to alarge extent independent of each other.”6[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos741567] If genes and proteins do notexplain the differences between chimpanzees and us, then what does? However, leaving aside all these problems, assume for the purpose of argumentthat the hereditary differences between chimpanzees and humans will indeed beexplained in terms of small changes in protein structure, or small numbers ofdifferent proteins, or genetic changes that affect the control of proteinsynthesis (perhaps depending to some extent on differences of arrangement of DNAwithin the chromosomes), or combinations of these factors. (2)Within the same organism, different patterns of development take place whilethe DNA remains the same. Consider, for example, your arms and legs: bothcontain identical cell types (muscle cells, connective tissue cells, etc.) withidentical proteins and identical DNA. So the differences between the arms andthe legs cannot be ascribed to DNA per se; they must be ascribed topattern-determining factors that act differently in developing arms and legs.They also give rise to mirror-image patterns in right and left arms and legs.The precision of arrangement of the tissues—for example, the joining of tendonsto the right parts of the bones—shows that these patterns are established indetail and with precision. The mechanistic theory of life means that thesefactors must be regarded as physical or chemical, but their nature is unknown. (3) Even if physical or chemical factors affecting the growth of an arm, theformation of an eye, or the development of an apple are identified, this raisesthe question of how these factors are themselves patterned in the first place.This problem can be illustrated by considering two cases in which chemicalmorphogens have actually been isolated and chemically identified. First, in the cellular slime molds, free-living amoeboid cells aggregatetogether under certain conditions to form a “slug” that, after moving around forsome time, grows up into the air and differentiates into a stalk bearing aspore-mass (figure 4). The aggregation of these cells depends on a relativelysimple chemical, cyclic AMP (adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate). But in thecomposite organism, although the distribution of cyclic AMP is related to thepattern of differentiation, “it is not clear whether the cyclic AMP pattern is acause or consequence of prestalk–prespore differentiation.” Moreover, even if itdoes play a causal role in differentiation, it cannot itself account for thepattern in which it is distributed, nor for the fact that this pattern variesfrom species to species: some other factors must be responsible for itspatterned distribution. There is a wide variety of opinion on the possiblenature of these factors.7 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos741693] image [images/00008.jpg]Figure 4. The migration and culmination stages of two species of slime mold. Onthe left are the newly developed composite organisms, formed by the aggregationof numerous free-living amoeboid cells. These migrate as “slugs” and then growupward, differentiating into stalks bearing spore bodies. (After Bonner, 1958) Second, in higher plants the hormone auxin (indole-3-yl-acetic acid) is known toplay a role in the control of vascular differentiation, as in the formation ofwood (xylem) cells. But then what controls the production and distribution ofauxin? The answer seems to be: vascular differentiation itself. Auxin isprobably released by differentiating xylem cells as a by-product of proteinbreakdown occurring as the cells commit suicide. Thus the system is circular:auxin helps to maintain patterns of differentiation, but it does not explain howthey are established to start with.8[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos741977] However, assume for the purpose of argument that it might be possible toidentify preexisting physical factors that set up the pattern of distribution ofauxin, or cyclic AMP, or other chemical morphogens. Assume also that the ways inwhich these controlling factors are themselves controlled can be identified, ina series going right back to the fertilized egg or spore from which the organismgrew. Now there is the problem of regulation: If part of the system is removed, thiscomplicated series of physico-chemical patterns must be disrupted. But somehowthe remaining parts of the embryo manage to change their usual course ofdevelopment and produce a more or less normal adult. This problem is generally agreed to be extremely difficult; it is far from beingunderstood even in outline. Supporters of the mechanistic theory hope that itcan be solved through much painstaking effort and mathematical modeling. Let usassume once more that a mechanistic solution can be achieved. (4) The next problem is how this “positional information” brings about itseffects. The simplest possibility is that the “positional information” isspecified by a concentration gradient of a specific morphogen, and cells exposedto more than a certain concentration synthesize one set of proteins while cellsexposed to concentrations below this threshold synthesize another set ofproteins. Again, assume that mechanisms by which “positional information” can be“interpreted” can be identified and described in detail.9[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos742226] Now, at the end of a chain ofhighly optimistic assumptions, we reach the situation in which different cellsarranged in a suitable pattern make different proteins. image [images/00004.jpg]So far, there has been a set of one-to-one relationships: a gene is “switchedon” by a specific stimulus; the DNA is transcribed into RNA; and the RNA istranslated into a particular sequence of amino acids, a polypeptide chain. Butnow this simple causal sequence comes to an end. How do the polypeptide chainsfold up into the characteristic three-dimensional structures of proteins? How dothe proteins give the cells their characteristic structures? How do cellsaggregate together to give tissues of characteristic structures? And so on.These are the problems of morphogenesis proper: the synthesis of specificpolypeptide chains provides the basis for the metabolic machinery and thestructural materials on which morphogenesis depends. The polypeptide chains andthe proteins into which they fold up are undoubtedly necessary formorphogenesis; but what actually determines the patterns and structures intowhich the proteins, cells, and tissues combine? Mechanists assume that all thiscan be explained in terms of self-assembly. Morphogenesis takes placespontaneously, given the right proteins in the right places at the right timesand in the right sequence. This is rather like saying that a house can builditself spontaneously as long as the right building materials are delivered tothe building site at the right times. At this crucial stage, biology effectivelyabdicates, and the problem of morphogenesis is left to spontaneous physical andchemical processes. In the building-site analogy, the activity of the buildersand a plan to which they are working are needed in addition to the startingmaterials. By contrast, morphogenesis must depend on spontaneous physicalprocesses driven by spontaneous energy flows, and the systems must beself-organizing. But how? Protein folding is a good example. Polypeptide chains fold up spontaneously,given the right conditions, into proteins of characteristic three-dimensionalstructure. Some proteins can be made to unfold and then, by changing theconditions, fold up again in test tubes. Hence protein folding does not dependon any mysterious property of living cells. Protein subunits can aggregate together under test-tube conditions to formstructures normally produced inside living cells: for example, subunits of theprotein tubulin join together into long, rodlike structures calledmicrotubules.10 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos742570]Yet-more-complex structures, such as ribosomes, are formed by the spontaneousaggregation of various protein and RNA components. Lipid molecules can cometogether in test tubes to form membranelike structures. Insofar as these structures undergo spontaneous self-assembly, they resemblecrystals; many of them can indeed be regarded as crystalline orquasi-crystalline. So in principle they pose no more, or no less, of a problemthan normal crystallization; the same sorts of physical process can be assumedto be at work. Nevertheless, by no means all morphogenetic processes can be regarded as typesof crystallization. They must involve a number of other physical factors; forexample, the forces of surface tension must influence the shapes taken up bymembranes. And then some of the patterns may arise from statistically randomfluctuations; simple examples of the appearance of “order through fluctuations”have been studied from the point of view of irreversible or nonequilibriumthermodynamics in inorganic systems.11[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos742778] Some patterning processes canbe modeled mathematically in complex systems theory.12[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos743019] But the mechanistic theory does not merely suggest that physical processes playa part in morphogenesis; it asserts that morphogenesis is entirely explicable interms of physics. What does this mean? If everything observable is defined asbeing physically explicable in principle just because it happens, then it mustbe so by definition. But this does not necessarily mean it can be explained interms of the known laws of physics. In relation to biological morphogenesis, a complete explanation would beachieved if a biologist supplied with the entire genome sequence of an organism,and a detailed description of the physical and chemical state of the fertilizedegg and of the environment in which it developed, could predict in terms of thefundamental laws of physics (e.g., quantum field theory, the equations ofelectromagnetism, the second law of thermodynamics, etc.) first, thethree-dimensional structure of all the proteins the organism would make; second,the enzymic and other properties of these proteins; third, the organism’s entiremetabolism; fourth, the nature and consequences of all the types of positionalinformation that would arise during its development; fifth, the structure of itscells, tissues, and organs and the form of the organism as a whole; and finally,in the case of an animal, its instinctive behavior. If all these predictions could be made successfully, and if, in addition, thecourse of processes of regulation and regeneration could also be predicted apriori, this would indeed be a conclusive demonstration that living organismsare fully explicable in terms of the known laws of physics. As T. H. Huxley putit in 1867, “The final object of physiology is to deduce the facts of morphologyon the one hand, and those of ecology on the other, from the laws of themolecular forces of matter”13 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos743272](section 1.1). But, of course, this could not be done in the nineteenth century,nor can it be done today, despite all the discoveries of molecular biology andthe hundreds of billions of dollars that have been spent on it. So there is noway of demonstrating that such an explanation is possible. It might not be. Thus when the mechanistic theory states that all the phenomena of morphogenesisare capable in principle of being explained in terms of the known laws ofphysics, it might well be wrong: so little is understood at present that thereseem to be no good grounds for a firm belief in the adequacy of the known lawsto explain all the phenomena. But at any rate this is a testable theory; itwould be refuted by the discovery of a new law of physics. If on the other handthe mechanistic theory states that living organisms obey both known and unknownlaws of nature, then it would be irrefutable; it would simply be a generalstatement of faith in the possibility of explanation. It would not be opposed toorganicism and vitalism; it would include them. In practice, the mechanistic theory of life is not treated as a rigorouslydefined, refutable scientific theory; rather, it serves to provide ajustification for the conservative method of working within the establishedframework of thought provided by existing physics and chemistry. Although it isusually understood to mean that living organisms are in principle fullyexplicable in terms of the known laws of physics, if a new law of physics wereto be discovered, the mechanistic theory could easily be modified to include it.Whether this modified theory of life were to be called mechanistic or not wouldbe a matter of definition. When so little is understood about the phenomena of morphogenesis and behavior,the possibility cannot be ruled out that at least some of them depend on acausal factor or factors as yet unrecognized by physics. In the mechanisticapproach, this question is simply put aside. Nevertheless, it remains entirelyopen. 2.3 Vitalism Vitalism asserts that the phenomena of life cannot be fully understood in termsof physical laws derived only from the study of inanimate systems, but that anadditional causal factor is at work in living organisms. A typical statement ofa nineteenth-century vitalist position was made by the chemist Justus von Liebigin 1844. He argued that although chemists could already produce all sorts oforganic substances, and would in future produce many more, chemistry would neverbe in a position to create an eye or a leaf. Besides the recognized causes ofheat, chemical affinity, and the formative force of cohesion andcrystallization, “in living bodies there is added yet a fourth cause thatdominates the force of cohesion and combines the elements in new forms so thatthey gain new qualities—forms and qualities that do not appear except in theorganism.”14 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos743464] Ideas of this type, although widely held, were too vague to provide an effectivealternative to the mechanistic theory. It was only at the beginning of thetwentieth century that neovitalist theories were worked out in some detail. Inrelation to morphogenesis, the most important was that of the embryologist HansDriesch. Driesch did not deny that many features of living organisms could be understoodin physico-chemical terms. He was well aware of the findings of physiology andbiochemistry, and of the potential for future discovery: There are many specificchemical compounds present in the organism, belonging to the different classesof the chemical system, and partly known in their constitution, partly unknown.But those that are not yet known will probably be known some day in the nearfuture, and certainly there is no theoretical impossibility about discoveringthe constitution of albumen (protein) and how to “make” it.15[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos743669] He knew that enzymes (“ferments”) catalyze biochemical reactions and could do soin test tubes: “There is no objection to our regarding almost all metabolicprocesses inside the organism as due to the intervention of ferments orcatalytic materials, and the only difference between inorganic and organicferments is the very complicated character of the latter and the very highdegree of their specification.”16[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos743904] He knew that Mendelian genesare material entities located in the chromosomes, and that they are probablychemical compounds of specific structure.17[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos744045] He thought that many aspects ofmetabolic regulation and physiological adaptation could be understood alongphysico-chemical lines18 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos744193] andthat there were in general “many processes in the organism . . . which go onteleologically or purposefully on a fixed machine-like basis.”19[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos744331] His opinions on these subjectshave been confirmed by the subsequent advances of physiology, biochemistry, andmolecular biology. Obviously, Driesch was unable to anticipate the details ofthese discoveries, but he regarded them as possible and in no way incompatiblewith vitalism. In relation to morphogenesis, he considered that “it must be granted that amachine, as we understand the word, might very well be the motive force oforganogenesis in general, if only normal, that is to say, if only undisturbeddevelopment existed, and if taking away parts of our system led to fragmentaldevelopment.”20 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos744464] But, in fact,in many embryonic systems the removal of part of the embryo is followed by aprocess of regulation, whereby the remaining tissues reorganize themselves andgo on to produce an adult organism of more or less normal form. The mechanistic theory has to attempt to account for development in terms ofcomplex physical or chemical interactions among the parts of the embryo. Drieschargued that the fact of regulation made any such machinelike systeminconceivable, because the system was able to remain a whole and produce atypical final result, whereas no complex three-dimensional machinelike systemcould remain a whole after the arbitrary removal of parts. This argument is open to the objection that it is, or will be at some time inthe future, invalidated by advances in technology. But at least it does not seemto have been refuted so far. For example, although some computerized systems canrespond appropriately to certain types of functional disturbance, they do so onthe basis of a fixed structure. They cannot regenerate their own physicalstructure; for example, if parts of the computer are destroyed at random, theycannot be regenerated by the machine itself, nor can the system go onfunctioning normally after the arbitrary removal of parts. The other item ofmodern technology that might seem relevant is the hologram, from which piecescan be removed but which can still give rise to a complete three-dimensionalimage. But, significantly, the hologram is not a machine: it is an interferencepattern in a field. Driesch believed that the facts of regulation, regeneration, and reproductionshowed that there was something about living organisms that remained a whole,even though parts of the organism could be removed; it acted on the physicalsystem but was not itself part of it. He called this nonphysical causal factorentelechy. He postulated that entelechy organizes and controls physico-chemicalprocesses during morphogenesis. The genes were responsible for providing thematerial means of morphogenesis—the chemical substances to be ordered—but theordering itself was brought about by entelechy. Clearly morphogenesis could be affected by genetic changes that changed themeans of morphogenesis, but this would not prove that it could be explainedsimply in terms of genes and the chemicals to which they gave rise. Similarly, the nervous system provided the means for the actions of an animal,but entelechy organized the activity of the brain, using it as an instrument, asa pianist plays on a piano. Again, behavior can be affected by damage to thebrain, just as the music played by the pianist is affected by damage to thepiano; but this proves only that the brain is a necessary means for behavior, asthe piano is a necessary means for the pianist. Entelechy is a Greek word whose derivation (en-telos) indicates something thatbears its end or goal in itself; it “contains” the goal toward which a systemunder its control is directed. Thus if a normal pathway of development isdisturbed, the system can reach the same goal in a different way. Drieschconsidered that development and behavior were under the control of a hierarchyof entelechies, which were all ultimately derived from, and subordinated to, theoverall entelechy of the organism.21[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos744597] As in any hierarchical system,such as an army, mistakes are possible and entelechies might behave “stupidly,”as they do in cases of super-regeneration, when a superfluous organ isproduced.22 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos744730] But suchstupidities do not disprove the existence of entelechy any more than militaryerrors disprove that soldiers are intelligent beings. Driesch described entelechy as an “intensive manifoldness,” a non-spatial causalfactor that nevertheless acted into space. He emphasized that it was a natural(as opposed to a metaphysical or mystical) factor that acted on physico-chemicalprocesses. It was not a form of energy, and its action did not contradict thesecond law of thermodynamics or the law of conservation of energy. Then how didit work? Driesch was writing during the era of classical physics, when it was generallythought that all physical processes were fully deterministic, in principlecompletely predictable in terms of energy, momentum, etc. But he considered thatphysical processes could not be fully determinate, because otherwise thenonenergetic entelechy could not act upon them. He therefore concluded that, atleast in living organisms, microphysical processes were not fully determined byphysical causality, although, on average, physico-chemical changes obeyedstatistical laws. He suggested that entelechy acted by affecting the detailedtiming of microphysical processes, by suspending them and releasing them fromsuspension whenever required for its purposes: > This faculty of a temporary suspension of inorganic becoming is to be regarded> as the most essential ontological characteristic of entelechy . . . Entelechy,> according to our view, is quite unable to remove any kind of “obstacle” to> happening . . . for such a removal would require energy, and entelechy is> non-energetic. We only admit that entelechy may set free into actuality what> it has itself prevented from actuality, what it has suspended hitherto.23> [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos744863] Although this bold proposal of a physical indeterminism within living organismswas completely unacceptable from the point of view of deterministic classicalphysics, it seems much less outrageous in the light of quantum theory. Sometwenty years after Driesch’s speculations about indeterminism within livingorganisms, Heisenberg deduced the uncertainty principle, and it soon becameclear that positions and timings of microphysical events could be predicted onlyin terms of probabilities. By 1928, the physicist Sir Arthur Eddington was ableto speculate that the mind influences the body by affecting the configuration ofquantum events within the brain through a causal influence on the probability oftheir occurrence. “Unless it belies its name, probability can be modified inways which ordinary physical entities would not admit of.”24[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos744996] Comparable ideas were proposedby the neurophysiologist Sir John Eccles, who summarized his suggestion asfollows: > The neurophysiological hypothesis is that the “will” modifies the temporal> activity of the neuronal network by exerting spatio-temporal “fields of> influence” that become effective through this unique detector function of the> active cerebral cortex. It will be noted that the “will” or “mind influence”> has itself some spatio-temporal patterned character in order to allow it this> operative effectiveness.25 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos745200] A number of similar proposals have been put forward by physicists and byparapsychologists26 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos745422] (section1.7). A vitalist theory of morphogenesis can be summarized as follows: The genomespecifies all the possible proteins that the organism can make. But theorganization of the cells, tissues, and organs, and the coordination of thedevelopment of the organism as a whole, is determined by entelechy. The latteris inherited nonmaterially from past members of the same species; it is not atype of matter or energy, although it acts upon the physico-chemical systems ofthe organism under its control. This action is possible because entelechy actsby influencing probabilistic processes. This theory is by no means vacuous, and could probably be tested experimentally,but it seems fundamentally unsatisfactory simply because it is vitalistic.Entelechy is essentially nonphysical by definition; even though it could, exhypothesi, act on material systems by providing a set of variables that from thepoint of view of quantum theory are hidden, this would still be an action ofunlike on unlike. The physical world and the nonphysical entelechy could neverbe explained or understood in terms of each other. This dualism, inherent in all vitalist theories, seems particularly arbitrary inthe light of the discovery of the self-assembly of structures as complex asribosomes and viruses, indicating a difference of degree, and not of kind, fromcrystallization. Although the self-organization of living organisms as a wholeis more complex than that of ribosomes or viruses, there is sufficientsimilarity to suggest that here again is a difference of degree. This, at anyrate, is what both mechanists and organicists prefer to think. Possibly a vitalist theory would have to be accepted if no other satisfactoryexplanation of the phenomena of life were conceivable. In the early part of thetwentieth century, when vitalism seemed to be the only alternative to themechanistic theory, it gained considerable support in spite of its essentialdualism. But the organismic theory incorporates many aspects of vitalism withina larger perspective, and effectively supersedes it. 2.4 Organicism Organismic theories of morphogenesis have developed under a variety ofinfluences: some from philosophical systems, especially those of Alfred NorthWhitehead and Jan Christian Smuts; some from modern physics, in particular fromthe field concept; others from Gestalt psychology, itself strongly influenced bythe concept of physical fields; and some from the vitalism of Driesch.27[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos746225] These theories deal with thesame problems that Driesch claimed were insoluble in mechanisticterms—regulation, regeneration, and reproduction—but whereas Driesch proposedthe nonphysical entelechy to account for the properties of wholeness anddirectiveness exhibited by developing organisms, organicists proposedmorphogenetic (or embryonic, or developmental) fields. This idea was put forward independently by Alexander Gurwitsch in Russia in1922,28 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos746567] Hans Spemann in Germanyin 1924, and Paul Weiss in Austria in 1926.29[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos746834] All were leading developmentalbiologists, and Spemann received the Nobel Prize in 1935 for his work onembryology. However, apart from stating that morphogenetic fields played animportant role in the control of morphogenesis, none of them specified how thesefields worked. The field terminology was soon taken up by other developmentalbiologists, but it remained ill-defined, although it served to suggest analogiesbetween properties of living organisms and inorganic electromagnetic systems.For example, if an iron magnet is cut into two parts, two whole magnets areproduced, each with its own magnetic field. If two magnets are brought togetherin the right orientation, they form a single magnet with a unified magneticfield. Similarly, the morphogenetic field was supposed to account for the“wholeness” of detached parts of organisms that were capable of growing into neworganisms, and for the ability of parts of organisms to form a unified wholewhen brought together. The British biologist Conrad Hal Waddington suggested an extension of the ideaof the morphogenetic field to take into account the temporal aspect ofdevelopment. He called this new concept the chreode (from the Greek chre, it isnecessary, and hodos, route or path) and illustrated it by means of a simplethree-dimensional “epigenetic landscape” (figure 5).30[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos747052] In this model, the path followed by the ball as it rolls downward corresponds tothe developmental history of a particular part of an egg. As embryologyproceeds, a branching series of alternative paths are represented by thevalleys. These correspond to the pathways of development of the different typesof organ, tissue, and cell. In the organism these are quite distinct; forexample, the kidney and liver have definite structures and do not grade intoeach other through a series of intermediate forms. Development is canalizedtoward definite end points. Genetic changes or environmental perturbations maypush the course of development (represented by the pathway followed by the ball)away from the valley bottom up the neighboring hillside, but unless it is pushedabove the threshold into another valley, the process of development will findits way back. It will not return to the point from which it started, but to somelater position on the canalized pathway of change. This represents regulation. image [images/00009.jpg]Figure 5. Part of an “epigenetic landscape,” illustrating the concept of thechreode as a canalized pathway of change. (From Waddington, 1957. Reproduced bycourtesy of George Allen & Unwin, Ltd.) The concept of the chreode is very similar to that of the morphogenetic field,but it makes explicit the dimension of time that is only implicit within thelatter. Both these concepts were taken further by the mathematician René Thom as part ofa comprehensive attempt to create a mathematical theory embracing morphogenesis,behavior, and language.31 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos747270] Hismain concern was to find an appropriate mathematical formalism for theseproblems, which had so far resisted mathematical treatment. The final objectivewas to produce mathematical models that corresponded as closely as possible todevelopmental processes. These models would be topological, qualitative ratherthan quantitative, and would not depend on any particular scheme of causalexplanation. > One essential feature of our use of local models is that it implies nothing> about the “ultimate nature of reality”; even if this is ever revealed by> analysis complicated beyond description, only a part of its manifestation, the> so-called observables, are finally relevant to the macroscopic description of> the system. The phase space of our dynamical model is defined using only these> observables and without reference to any more or less chaotic underlying> structures.32 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos747483] Thom’s mathematical models were dynamic in the modern mathematical sense of theword.33 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos747623] Dynamic systems movetoward attractors, and Thom explicitly connected his models with Waddington’sidea of chreodes, with ends or goals toward which systems develop.34[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos747857] The problem with this approach is that it is essentially descriptive; it doeslittle to explain morphogenesis. This is indeed the case with all existingorganismic theories of morphogenesis. Compare, for example, Thom’s attractorsand Waddington’s chreodes with Driesch’s entelechy. They all include the ideathat development is guided or canalized in space and time by something thatcannot itself be regarded as confined to a particular place and time; all seethis as somehow including within itself the end or goal of the developmentalprocess, and thereby provide a way of thinking about regulation andregeneration. The main difference is that Driesch tried to say how this processmight actually work, whereas Waddington and Thom did not. The concept of thechreode was therefore less open to attack because it remained so vague.35[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos748058] In fact, Waddington regardedthe concepts of chreodes and morphogenetic fields as “essentially a descriptiveconvenience.”36 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos749039] Like a numberof other organicists, he denied that he was suggesting the operation of anythingother than known physical causes.37[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos749298] However, not all organicists make this denial; some leave the question open.This explicitly noncommittal attitude is illustrated by the following discussionof the morphogenetic field by the developmental biologist Brian Goodwin. > One aspect of the field is that electrical forces can affect it. Other> developing and regenerating organisms have also been found to have interesting> and significant electrical field patterns, but I would not wish to suggest> that the morphogenetic field is essentially electrical. Chemical substances> also affect polarity and other spatial aspects of developing organisms; and> again I would not wish to draw the conclusion that the morphogenetic field is> essentially chemical or biochemical in nature. My belief is that its> investigation should proceed on the assumption that it could be any, or all,> or none of these things; but that, despite agnosticism regarding its material> nature, it plays a primary role in the developmental process.38> [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos749813] The openness of this concept makes it the most promising starting point for adetailed organismic theory of morphogenesis. But clearly, if morphogeneticfields are considered to be fully explicable in terms of known physicalprinciples, they represent nothing but an ambiguous terminology superimposedupon a sophisticated version of the mechanistic theory. Only if they are assumedto play a causal role, at present unrecognized by physics, can a testable theorybe developed. This possibility is discussed in the following chapters. Exploring the nature of morphogenetic fields takes on a new urgency in the lightof modern evolutionary developmental biology. With the rise of molecular biologyfrom the 1960s to the 1990s, the concept of morphogenetic fields was eclipsed infavor of genes. But as the limitations of the molecular approach becameincreasingly apparent, fields reemerged as a central concept for theunderstanding of development. The formation of entire structures such as wingsand antennae in fruit flies can be “switched on” or “switched off” by mutationsin “toolbox” genes. The morphogenetic field behaves as a whole and the geneticswitches are now referred to as “field selector genes.”39[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos750182] Development is “modular.”40[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos750472] In an evolutionary context, morphogenetic fields take on an even more importantexplanatory role. As the developmental biologist Scott Gilbert and hiscolleagues have argued: > Homologous developmental pathways . . . are seen in numerous embryonic> processes, and they are seen occurring in discrete regions, the morphogenetic> fields. These fields (which exemplify the modular nature of developing> embryos) are proposed to mediate between genotype and phenotype. Just as the> cell (and not its genome) functions as the unit of organic structure and> function, so the morphogenetic field (and not the genes or the cells) is seen> as a major unit of ontogeny [development] whose changes bring about changes in> evolution.41 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos750735] So what are these fields and how do they work? These questions cannot beanswered without looking at the bigger question of the causation of form. "},{"pageContent":"3 image [images/00003.jpg] THE CAUSES OF FORM 3.1 The problem of form It is not immediately obvious that form presents any problem at all. The worldaround us is full of forms; we recognize them in every act of perception. But weeasily forget that there is a vast gulf between this aspect of our experience,which we simply take for granted, and the quantitative factors with whichphysics concerns itself: mass, momentum, energy, temperature, pressure, electriccharge, etc.1 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos751166] The relationships between the quantitative factors of physics can be expressedmathematically, and physical changes can be described by means of equations. Theconstruction of these equations is possible because fundamental physicalquantities are conserved according to the Principles of Conservation of Mass andEnergy, Momentum, Electric Charge, etc.: the total amount of mass and energy,momentum, electric charge, etc. before a given physical change equals the totalamount afterward. But form does not enter into these equations: it is not avector or scalar quantity, nor is it conserved. If a bunch of flowers is throwninto a furnace and reduced to ashes, the total amount of matter and energyremains the same, but the form of the flowers simply disappears. Physical quantities can be measured with instruments to a high degree ofaccuracy. But forms cannot be measured on a quantitative scale, nor do they needto be, even by scientists. In this context, the word form is taken to includenot only the shape of the outer surface or boundary of a system, but also itsinternal structure. A botanist does not measure the difference between twospecies on the dial of an instrument; nor does an entomologist recognizebutterflies by means of a machine; nor an anatomist bones; nor a histologistcells. All these forms are recognized directly. Then specimens of plants arepreserved in herbaria, butterflies and bones in cabinets, and cells onmicroscope slides. As forms they are simply themselves; they cannot be reducedto anything else. The description and classification of forms is the primary concern of manybranches of science; even in a physical science such as chemistry, a majorobjective is the elucidation of the forms of molecules, representeddiagrammatically in two-dimensional “structural formulae” or inthree-dimensional models of the “ball and stick” type. The forms of all but the simplest systems can be represented only visually,whether by photographs, drawings, diagrams, or models. They cannot berepresented mathematically. Even the most advanced topological methods are notyet sufficiently developed to be capable of providing a mathematical formulafor, say, a giraffe or an oak tree.2[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos751459] If the mere description of any but the simplest static forms presents amathematical problem of appalling complexity, the description of change ofform—of morphogenesis—is even more difficult. This is the subject of René Thom’s“catastrophe theory,” which classifies and describes in general terms thepossible types of change of form, or “catastrophe.” He applies this theory tothe problems of morphogenesis by constructing mathematical models in which theend or goal of a morphogenetic process, the final form, is represented by anattractor within a morphogenetic field. He postulates that every object, orphysical form, can be represented by such an attractor and that allmorphogenesis “can be described by the disappearance of the attractorsrepresenting the initial forms, and their replacement by capture by theattractors representing the final forms.”3[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos751719] In order to develop topological models that correspond to particularmorphogenetic processes, formulae are found by a combination of trial and errorand inspired guesswork. If a mathematical expression gives too many solutions,restrictions have to be introduced into it; and if a function is too restricted,a more generalized function is used instead. By methods such as these, Thomhoped that it would eventually be possible to develop topological expressions,which correspond in detail to actual morphogenetic processes. But even so, thesemodels would probably not enable quantitative predictions to be made. Their mainvalue might lie in drawing attention to formal analogies between different typesof morphogenesis.4 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos751851] At first sight, the mathematical formalism of Information Theory may seempreferable to this topological approach. But in fact Information Theory isseverely limited in its scope. It was originally developed by telephoneengineers in connection with the transmission of messages from a source, througha channel, to a receiver; it was primarily concerned with the question of howthe characteristics of a channel influence the amount of information that can betransmitted in a given time. One of the basic results is that in a closedsystem, no more information can be transmitted to the receiver than wascontained in the source, although the form of the information can be changed,for example from the dots and dashes of Morse code to words. The informationcontent of an event is defined not by what has happened, but only with respectto what might have happened instead. For this purpose binary symbols are usuallyused, and then the information content of a pattern is determined by finding outhow many yes or no decisions are needed to specify which particular class of apattern out of a known number of classes has occurred. In biology this theory has some relevance to the quantitative study of thetransmission of impulses by nerve fibers; to a lesser extent it has a bearing onthe transmission of a sequence of bases in the DNA of parents to the DNA oftheir offspring, although even in such a simple case as this it can be seriouslymisleading, because in living organisms things happen that do not occur intelephone wires: genes mutate, parts of chromosomes undergo inversions,translocations, etc. But Information Theory is not relevant to biologicalmorphogenesis: it applies only to the transmission of information within closedsystems, and it cannot allow for an increase in the content of informationduring this process.5 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos752100]Developing organisms are not closed systems, and as they develop the complexityof form and organization increases. Although biologists often speak of “geneticinformation” and “positional information” as if these terms have somewell-defined meaning, this is an illusion: they borrow only the jargon ofInformation Theory and leave its rigor behind. However, even if impressively detailed mathematical models of morphogeneticprocesses could be made by whatever method, and even if they gave rise topredictions that agreed with experimental evidence, there would still be thequestion of what these models correspond to. Indeed the same question is raisedby the correspondence between mathematical models and empirical observations inany branch of science. One answer is provided by mathematical mysticism of the Pythagorean type: theuniverse is dependent upon a fundamental mathematical order that somehow givesrise to all empirical phenomena; this transcendent order is revealed and becomescomprehensible only through the methods of mathematics. Although this attitudeis rarely advocated explicitly, it has a strong influence within modern science,and can often be found, more or less thinly disguised, among mathematicians andphysicists.6 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos752422] Alternatively, the correspondence can be explained by the tendency of the mindto seek and find order in experience: the ordered structures of mathematics,creations of the human mind, are superimposed onto experience, and those that donot fit are discarded; thus by a process resembling natural selection, thosemathematical formulae that fit best are retained. In this view, scientificactivity is concerned only with the development and empirical testing ofmathematical models of more or less isolated and definable aspects of the world;it cannot lead to any fundamental understanding of reality. However, in relation to the problem of form, there is a different approach thatrequires neither an acceptance of Pythagorean mysticism nor the abandoning ofthe possibility of explanation. If the forms of things are to be understood,they need not be explained in terms of numbers, but in terms of more fundamentalforms. Plato considered that the forms in the world of sense-experience werelike imperfect reflections of transcendent, archetypal Forms or Ideas. But thisdoctrine, strongly influenced by the mysticism of the Pythagoreans, failed toexplain how the eternal Forms were related to the changing world of phenomena.Aristotle believed this problem could be overcome by regarding the forms ofthings as immanent, rather than transcendent: specific forms were inherent inthe souls of living beings and actually caused them to take up theircharacteristic forms. In Driesch’s system, which was explicitly based on that of Aristotle, thespecific forms of living organisms were caused by a nonenergetic agency,entelechy. The morphogenetic fields and chreodes of organismic biologists play asimilar role in guiding morphogenetic processes toward specific final forms. Buttheir nature has so far remained obscure. This obscurity may be due, in part, to the Platonic tendency of much organismicthought,7 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos752747] most clearly apparentin Whitehead’s system of philosophy. Whitehead postulated that all actual eventsinvolved what he called Eternal Objects; the latter collectively made up therealm of possibility, and included all possible forms; indeed, they stronglyresembled Platonic Forms.8 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos753187] Butclearly, a metaphysical notion of morphogenetic fields as aspects of PlatonicForms or Eternal Objects would be of little value to experimental science. Onlyif they are regarded as physical entities that have physical effects can theyhelp to provide a scientific understanding of morphogenesis. The organismic philosophy embraces both biology and physics; hence, ifmorphogenetic fields are assumed to play a causal role in biologicalmorphogenesis, they should also play a causal role in the morphogenesis ofsimpler systems such as crystals and molecules. Such fields are not recognizedin the existing theories of physics. Therefore it is important to consider towhat extent these existing theories are capable of explaining the morphogenesisof purely chemical systems. If they are able to provide an adequate explanation,then the idea of morphogenetic fields is unnecessary; but if they are not, theway lies open for a new hypothesis of the causation of form throughmorphogenetic fields in both biological and nonbiological systems. 3.2 Form and energy In Newtonian physics, all causation was seen in terms of energy, the principleof movement and change. All moving things have energy— the kinetic energy ofmoving bodies, thermal vibration and electromagnetic radiation—and this energycan cause other things to move. Static things may also have energy—potentialenergy—due to their tendency to move; they are static only because they arerestrained by forces that oppose this tendency. Gravitational attraction was thought to depend on a force that acted at adistance causing bodies to move, or giving them a tendency to move, a potentialenergy. However, no reason could be given for the existence of this attractiveforce itself. Gravitational as well as electromagnetic effects are now explained in terms offields. Whereas Newtonian forces were supposed to arise in some unexplained wayfrom material bodies and to spread out from them into space, in modern physicsthe fields are primary: they underlie both material bodies and the space betweenthem. This picture is complicated by the fact that there are several different typesof field. First, the gravitational field, which in Einstein’s General Theory ofRelativity is equated with space-time, and is curved in the presence of matter.Second, the electromagnetic field, within which electrical charges arelocalized, and through which electromagnetic radiations propagate as vibrationaldisturbances. According to quantum theory, these disturbances are particle-likephotons associated with discrete quanta of energy. Third, in the quantum fieldtheory of matter, subatomic particles are quanta of excitation of matter fields.Each kind of particle has its own field: a proton is a quantum of theproton-antiproton field, an electron a quantum of the electron-positron field,and so on. In these theories, physical phenomena are explained by a combination of fieldsand of energy, not in terms of energy alone. Thus although energy can beregarded as the cause of change, the ordering of change depends on the spatialstructure of the fields. These structures have physical effects, but they arenot in themselves a type of energy; they act as “geometrical” or spatial causes.The radical difference between this idea and the notion of exclusively energeticcausation is illustrated in the contrast between Newton’s and Einstein’stheories of gravitation: according to Newton, the Moon moves around the Earthbecause it is pulled toward it by an attractive force; according to Einstein, itdoes so because the very space in which it moves is curved. The modern understanding of the structure of chemical systems depends on theconcepts of quantum mechanics and of electromagnetism; gravitational effects arevery small by comparison and can be ignored. The possible ways in which theatoms can combine together are given by the Schrödinger equation of quantummechanics, which enables the orbitals of electrons to be calculated in terms ofprobabilities; in the quantum field theory of matter these orbitals can beregarded as structures within the electron-positron field. But since electronsand atomic nuclei are electrically charged, they are also associated withspatial patterns within the electromagnetic field, and hence with potentialenergies. Not all the possible spatial arrangements of a given number of atomshave the same potential energy, and only the arrangement with the lowestpotential energy will be stable, for reasons indicated in figure 6. If a systemis in a state that has a higher energy than possible alternative states, anysmall displacement (for example, due to thermal agitation) will cause it to moveinto another state (A). If it is in a state with a lower energy than possiblealternatives, after small displacements it will return to this state, which isconsequently stable (B). A system may also exist temporarily in a state that isnot the most stable so long as it is not displaced above the level of a“barrier” (C); when this happens, it will move into a stabler, lower-energystate. These energetic considerations determine which is the most stable state of achemical structure, but they do not account for its spatial characteristics,which in figure 6 are represented by the slopes down which the ball rolls, andthat act as barriers confining it. These depend on spatial patterns given by thefields of matter and electromagnetism. According to the second law of thermodynamics, spontaneous processes within aclosed system tend toward a state of equilibrium; as they do so, initialdifferences in temperature, pressure, etc., between different parts of thesystem tend to disappear. In technical language, the entropy of a closedmacroscopic system either stays the same or increases. The significance of this law is often exaggerated in popular accounts; inparticular, the term entropy is treated as if it was synonymous with disorder.Then the increasing complexity of organization that occurs in the evolution anddevelopment of living organisms appears to contradict the principle ofincreasing entropy. This confusion arises from a misunderstanding of thelimitations of classical thermodynamics. First, it applies only to closedsystems, whereas living organisms are open systems, exchanging matter and energywith their environment. Second, it deals only with the interrelations betweenheat and other forms of energy: it is relevant to the energetic factors thataffect chemical and biological structures, but does not account for theexistence of these structures in the first place. And third, the technicaldefinition of entropy bears little relation to any nontechnical conception ofdisorder; in particular, it is not concerned with the type of order inherent inthe specific structures of chemical and biological systems. According to thethird law of thermodynamics, at absolute zero the entropies of all purecrystalline solids are zero. They are perfectly “ordered” from a thermodynamicpoint of view because there is no disorder due to thermal agitation. But all areequally ordered: there is no difference in entropy between a simple salt crystaland a crystal of a complex macromolecule such as hemoglobin. It follows that thegreater structural complexity of the latter is not measurable in terms ofentropy. image [images/00010.jpg]Figure 6. A diagrammatic representation of unstable (A), stable (B), andpartially stable (C) states. The contrast between “order” in the sense of chemical or biological structureand thermodynamic “order” owing to inequalities of temperature, etc., in a largesystem containing countless atoms and molecules is illustrated by the process ofcrystallization. If a solution of a salt is placed in a dish inside a coldenclosure, the salt crystallizes as the solution cools. Initially, itsconstituent ions are redistributed at random within the solution, but ascrystallization takes place, they become ordered with great regularity withinthe crystals, and the crystals themselves develop into macroscopicallysymmetrical structures. From a morphological point of view, there has been aconsiderable increase in order; but from a thermodynamic point of view, therehas been a decrease in “order,” an increase in entropy, owing to theequalization of temperature between the solution and its surroundings, and tothe release of heat during the process of crystallization. Similarly, when an animal embryo grows and develops, there is an increase inentropy of the thermodynamic system consisting of the embryo and the environmentfrom which it takes its food and to which it releases heat and excretoryproducts. The second law of thermodynamics serves to emphasize this dependenceof living organisms on external sources of energy, but it does nothing toexplain their specific forms. In the most general terms, form and energy bear an inverse relationship to eachother: energy is the principle of change, but a form or structure can exist onlyas long as it has a certain stability and resistance to change. This oppositionis clearly apparent in the relationship between the states of matter andtemperature. Under sufficiently cool conditions, substances exist in crystallineforms in which the arrangements of the molecules show a high degree ofregularity and order. As the temperature is raised, at a certain point thethermal energy causes the crystalline form to disintegrate; the solid melts. Inthe liquid state, the molecules arrange themselves in transient patterns thatcontinually shift and change. The forces between the molecules create a surfacetension that imparts simple forms to the liquid as a whole, as in sphericaldrops. With a further rise in temperature, the liquid vaporizes; in the gaseousstate, the molecules are isolated and behave more or less independently of eachother. At higher temperatures still, the molecules themselves disintegrate intoatoms, and at yet higher temperatures, even the atoms break up to give a mixedgas of electrons and atomic nuclei— a plasma. When this sequence is reversed, more-complex and -organized structures appear asthe temperature is reduced, the most stable ones first and the least stable oneslast. As a plasma cools, electrons congregate around atomic nuclei in theirappropriate orbitals. At lower temperatures, atoms come together into molecules.Then as the gas condenses into droplets, supramolecular forces come into play.Finally, when the liquid crystallizes, a high degree of supra-molecular order isestablished. These forms appear spontaneously. They cannot be explained in terms of externalenergy, except negatively in the sense that they can come into being and persistonly below a certain temperature. They can be explained in terms of internalenergy only to the extent that out of all the possible structural arrangements,only the one with the lowest potential energy will be stable; this is thereforethe structure that will spontaneously tend to be taken up. 3.3 The structures of crystals Quantum mechanics can describe in detail the electronic orbitals and the energystates of the simplest of all chemical systems, the hydrogen atom. With morecomplicated atoms and simple molecules, its methods are no longer so precise;the complexity of the calculations becomes formidable. For complex molecules andcrystals, detailed calculations are impossible. The structures of the moleculesand the atomic arrangements within crystals can be found out empirically bychemical and crystallographic methods; these structures may indeed be more orless predictable by chemists and crystallographers on the basis of empiricallaws. But this is a very different matter from providing a fundamentalexplanation of chemical structures by means of the Schrödinger wave equation. It is important to realize this severe limitation of quantum mechanics.Certainly it helps to provide a qualitative or semi-quantitative understandingof chemical bonds and of certain aspects of crystals, such as the differencebetween insulators and electrical conductors. But it does not enable the formsand properties of even simple molecules and crystals to be predicted from firstprinciples. The situation is even worse with regard to the liquid state, ofwhich there is still no satisfactory quantitative account. And it is illusory toimagine that quantum mechanics in any detailed or rigorous way explains theforms and properties of the very complex molecules and macromolecular aggregatesstudied by biochemists and molecular biologists, not to mention the vastlygreater complexity of form and properties of even the simplest living cell. So widespread is the assumption that chemistry provides a firm foundation forthe mechanistic understanding of life that it is perhaps necessary to emphasizeon what very slender foundations of physical theory chemistry itself rests. Inthe words of Linus Pauling: > We may believe the theoretical physicist who tells us that all the properties> of substances should be calculable by known methods— the solution of the> Schrödinger equation. In fact, however, we have seen that during the 30 years> since the Schrödinger equation was discovered only a few accurate> non-empirical quantum-mechanical calculations of the properties of substances> in which the chemist is interested have been made. The chemist must still rely> upon experiment for most of his information about the properties of> substances.9 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos753410] In the fifty years since this passage was published, there have been importantimprovements in approximate methods of calculation available to quantumchemists, as well as huge advances in computing power. It is now possible tocompute some of the chemical properties of simple molecules like carbon monoxide(CO), and with more approximate methods several quantitative properties ofmolecules like methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3).10[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos753645] But it is still true thatchemists must rely on empirical observations, rather than calculation, for mostof their information on the properties and structures of molecules. Nevertheless, it may be argued that the detailed calculations could be carriedout in principle. But even assuming, for the purpose of argument, that thesecalculations could indeed be performed, it cannot be known in advance that theywill be correct, that is to say agree with empirical observations. So at presentthere is no evidence for the conventional assumption that complex chemicalmolecules and biological structures can be fully explained in terms of existingphysical theory. The reasons for the difficulty, if not impossibility, of predicting the form ofa complex chemical structure on the basis of the properties of its constituentatoms can be understood more clearly by means of a simple illustration. Considerelementary building blocks that can be added to each other one at a time eitherendways or sideways (see figure 7). With two building blocks there are 22 = 4possible combinations; with three, 23 = 8; with four, 24 = 16; with five 25 =32; with ten, 210 = 1,024 with twenty, 220 = 1,048,576; with 30, 230 =1,073,741,824; and so on. The number of possibilities soon becomes enormous. In a chemical system, the different possible arrangements of atoms havedifferent potential energies owing to the electrical and other interactionsbetween them; the system will spontaneously tend to take up the structure withthe minimum potential energy. In a simple system with only a few possiblestructures, one may have a distinctly lower energy than the others; in figure 8Athis is represented by the minimum at the bottom of the “potential well”; other,less stable possibilities are represented by local minima on the side of the“well.” In systems of increasing complexity, the number of possible structuresincreases (figure 8B, C, D); as it does so, the chance of there being a uniqueminimum-energy structure diminishes. In the situation represented by figure 8D, several different structures areequally stable from an energetic point of view. If the system was found to takeup any of these possible structures at random, or if it oscillated between them,then there would be no problem. But if it invariably took up only one of thesestructures, this would indicate that some factor other than energy somehowdetermined that this particular structure was realized rather than the otherpossibilities. No such factor is at present recognized by physics. image [images/00011.jpg]Figure 7. Possible combination of different numbers of building blocks capableof being joined together either endways or sideways. image [images/00012.jpg]Figure 8. A diagrammatic representation of the possible structures of systems ofincreasing complexity. In A there is a unique minimum-energy structure, but in Dseveral different possible structures are equally stable. Although chemists, crystallographers, and molecular biologists cannot carry outthe detailed calculations necessary to predict the minimum-energy structure orstructures of a system a priori, they are able to use various approximatemethods in combination with empirical data on the structures of similarsubstances. In general, these calculations do not permit unique structures to bepredicted (except for the simplest of systems), but only a range of possiblestructures with more or less equal minimum energies. Thus, these approximateresults support the idea that energetic considerations are insufficient toaccount for the unique structure of a complex chemical system. But thisconclusion can always be avoided by reasserting that the unique stable structuremust have a lower energy than any other possible structure. This assertion couldnever be falsified because in practice only approximate methods of calculationcan be used; the unique structure actually realized could therefore always beattributed to subtle energetic effects that eluded calculation. The followingdiscussion of Pauling’s illustrates the situation with regard to the structureof inorganic crystals. > Simple ionic substances such as the alkali halogenides have little choice of> structure; and a very few relatively stable ionic arrangements corresponding> to the formula M+ X– exist, and the various factors that influence the> stability of the crystal are pitted against one another, with no one factor> necessarily finding clear expression in the decision between the sodium> chloride and the caesium chloride arrangements.

They are> not rigorous in their derivation nor universal in their application, but they> have been found useful as a criterion for the probable correctness of reported> structures for complex crystals and an aid to X-ray investigation of crystals> by making possible the suggestion of reasonable structures for experimental> test.11 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos753935] As John Maddox, the late editor of Nature, expressed it in 1988: “One of thecontinuing scandals in the physical sciences is that it remains impossible topredict the structure of even the simplest crystalline solids from theirchemical composition.”12 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos754171] There have been enormous advances in computing power since 1988, but it is stillthe case that most predictions of crystal structure rely on knowing thestructures of similar substances. With the use of various approximations, bettera priori predictions are now possible, but they still run into the inevitableproblem of multiple minimum-energy structures. A review published in 2004summarized the situation as follows: “The main problem seems to be not so much amatter of generating stable crystal structures but rather of selecting one ormore possible structures from very many almost equienergetic candidates. Forexample, even for a simple molecule such as benzene, with only one known crystalstructure at normal pressure, calculations yield at least 30 possible crystalstructures.”13 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos754384] A series of Crystal Structure Prediction Workshops, organized by the CambridgeCrystallographic Data Centre in 1999, 2001, 2004, and 2007, were designed toevaluate present methods of calculation. Competing teams were given themolecular formulae of several simple organic chemicals and asked to predicttheir crystal structures “blind.” The actual structures of the crystals wereknown to the organizers, but were unpublished. In 2004, the results “were notmarked by spectacular success.” But “many groups found the experimentalstructure somewhere in their list of possible low-energy structures. Thus,present methods are capable, if not of predicting the experimental structure(s)a priori, then at least of providing a set of structures as possiblepolymorphs.”14 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos754708] In the 2007 contest there was a major advance: one team correctly predicted thestructure of all four test molecules. They used a two-stage process to selectthe three most probable minimum-energy structures, one of which was the rightone. But the molecules involved were very small, with between eight andthirty-three atoms.15 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos754835] 3.4 The structures of proteins The range of possible structures becomes enormous with large molecules,especially proteins. Even a small protein like insulin contains nearly eighthundred atoms, and the largest have hundreds of thousands of atoms. Thepolypeptide chains twist, turn, and fold into complicated three-dimensionalforms (figure 9). Under conditions in which a given type of protein molecule isstable, it folds up into a unique structure. In numerous experimental studies, proteins have been made to unfold to varyingdegrees by changing their chemical environment; they then fold up again intotheir normal structure when they are replaced in appropriate conditions. Inspite of starting from different initial states and following different“pathways” of folding, they reach the same structural end point.16[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos755057] image [images/00013.jpg]Figure 9. Above: The structure of the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase, isolatedfrom horse muscle; α-helices are represented by cylinders and β-strands byarrows. Below: The structure of an α-helical region in more detail. (After Bankset al., 1979) This stable end point is likely to be a minimum-energy structure. But this doesnot prove that it is the only possible structure with a minimum energy; theremay be many other possible structures with the same minimum energy. Indeed,calculations to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins, startingfrom the linear sequence of amino acids coded for by DNA, give far too manysolutions. In the literature on protein folding, this is known as the“multiple-minimum problem.”17 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos755344] In an ongoing series of workshops on predicting protein structures, held underthe aegis of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, teamsfrom all over the world try to predict the three-dimensional structure ofproteins working blind, as in the Crystal Structure Workshops. These evaluationsare called the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein StructurePrediction (CASP). By far the most successful predictions are based on adetailed knowledge of similar proteins, known as comparative modeling. The CASPcompetitions used to include an ab initio category, implying that thepredictions started from first principles, but for CASP6 in 2004, the name ofthe category was changed: “This name implies that there is no reliance on knownstructures in building models. In practice, most of the methods used for suchtargets do make extensive use of available structural information, both indevising scoring functions to distinguish between correct and incorrectpredictions, and in choosing fragments to incorporate in the model. For thisreason, the category was renamed as new folds.”18[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos755538] Nevertheless, even using knowledge about similar proteins, the multiple-minimumproblem will not go away. This was the situation in 2004: “As in crystalstructure prediction . . . the problem of selecting the most stable tertiarystructure from many almost equienergentic forms is a severe one.”19[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos755954] There are persuasive reasons for thinking that the protein itself does not“test” all these minima until it finds the right one. > If the chain explored all possible configurations at random by rotations about> the various single bonds of the structure, it would take too long to reach the> native configuration.

This discussion leads to the general conclusion that the existing theories ofphysics may well be incapable of explaining the unique structures of complexmolecules and crystals; they permit a range of possible minimum-energystructures to be suggested, but there is no evidence that they can account forthe fact that one rather than another of these possible structures is realized.It is therefore conceivable that some factor other than energy “selects” betweenthese possibilities and thus determines the specific structure taken up by thesystem.21 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos756565] The hypothesis thatwill now be developed is based on the idea that this “selection” is broughtabout by a new type of causation, at present unrecognized by physics, throughthe agency of morphogenetic fields. 3.5 Formative causation The hypothesis of formative causation proposes that morphogenetic fields play acausal role in the development and maintenance of the forms of systems at alllevels of complexity. This suggested causation of form by morphogenetic fieldsis called formative causation in order to distinguish it from the energetic typeof causation with which physics already deals so thoroughly.22[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos756796] Although morphogenetic fieldscan only bring about their effects in conjunction with energetic processes, theyare not in themselves energetic. The idea of nonenergetic formative causation is easier to grasp with the help ofan architectural analogy. In order to construct a house, bricks and otherbuilding materials are necessary; so are the builders who put the materials intoplace; and so is the architectural plan that determines the form of the house.The same builders doing the same amount of work using the same quantity ofbuilding materials would produce a house of different form with a differentplan. Thus the plan can be regarded as a cause of the specific form of thehouse, although of course it is not the only cause: it could never be realizedwithout the building materials and the activity of the builders. Similarly, aspecific morphogenetic field is a cause of the specific form taken up by asystem, although it cannot act without suitable “building blocks” and withoutthe energy necessary to move them into place. This analogy is not intended to suggest that the causative role of morphogeneticfields depends on conscious design, but only to emphasize that not all causationneed be energetic. The plan of a house is not in itself a type of energy.Instead, it is a kind of information. Even when it is drawn on paper, or finallyrealized in the form of the house, it does not weigh anything or have any energyof its own. If the paper is burned or the house is demolished, there is nomeasurable change in the total amount of mass and energy; the plan simplyvanishes. Likewise, according to the hypothesis of formative causation,morphogenetic fields are not in themselves energetic; but nevertheless they playa causal role in determining the forms of the systems with which they areassociated. If a system were associated with a different morphogenetic field, itwould develop differently.23 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos757277]This hypothesis is empirically testable in cases where the morphogenetic fieldsacting on systems can be altered (sections 5.6, 7.4, 7.6, 7.9, 11.2, and 11.4). Morphogenetic fields can be regarded as analogous to the known fields of physicsin that they are capable of ordering physical changes, even though theythemselves cannot be observed directly. Gravitational and electromagnetic fieldsare spatial structures that are invisible, intangible, inaudible, tasteless, andodorless; they are detectable only through their respective gravitational andelectromagnetic effects. In order to account for the fact that physical systemsinfluence each other at a distance without any apparent material connectionbetween them, these hypothetical fields are endowed with the property oftraversing empty space, or even actually constituting it. In one sense they arenonmaterial; but in another sense they are aspects of matter because they areknown through their effects on material systems. In effect, the scientificdefinition of matter has simply been widened to take them into account.Similarly, morphogenetic fields are spatial structures detectable only throughtheir morphogenetic effects on material systems; they too can be regarded asaspects of matter if the definition of matter is widened still further toinclude them. Although in the preceding sections only the morphogenesis of biological andcomplex chemical systems has been discussed, the hypothesis of formativecausation applies to biological and physical systems at all levels ofcomplexity. Since each kind of system has its own characteristic form, each musthave a specific kind of morphogenetic field: thus there must be one kind ofmorphogenetic field for protons; another for nitrogen atoms; another for watermolecules; another for sodium chloride crystals; another for the muscle cells ofearthworms; another for the kidneys of sheep; another for elephants; another forbeech trees; and so on. According to the organismic theory, systems or “organisms” are hierarchicallyorganized at all levels of complexity.24[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos757702] In the present discussion,these systems will be referred to as morphic units. The adjective morphic (fromthe Greek root morphe = form) emphasizes the aspect of structure, and the wordunit the unity or wholeness of the system. In this sense, chemical andbiological systems are composed of hierarchies of morphic units: a crystal, forexample, contains molecules, which contain atoms, which contain subatomicparticles. Crystals, molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles are morphicunits, as are animals and plants, organs, tissues, cells, and organelles. Simpleexamples of this hierarchical type of organization can be visualizeddiagrammatically either as a “tree” or as a series of “Chinese boxes” (figure10). image [images/00014.jpg]Figure 10. Alternative ways of representing a simple hierarchical system. A higher-level morphic unit must somehow coordinate the arrangement of theparts, or modules, of which it is composed. It does so through the influence ofits morphogenetic field on the morphogenetic fields of lower-level morphicunits. Thus morphogenetic fields, like morphic units themselves, are essentiallyhierarchical in their organization. The way in which morphogenetic fields might act upon the systems under theirinfluence is discussed in the following chapter; and the question of where theycome from and what gives them their specific structure is discussed in chapter5. "},{"pageContent":"4 image [images/00003.jpg] MORPHOGENETIC FIELDS 4.1 Morphogenetic germs Morphogenesis does not take place in a vacuum. It can only begin from an alreadyorganized system that serves as a morphogenetic germ. During morphogenesis a newhigher-level morphic unit comes into being around this germ, under the influenceof a specific morphogenetic field. So how does this field become associated withthe morphogenetic germ to start with? The answer may be that just as the association of material systems withgravitational fields depends on their mass, and with electromagnetic fields ontheir electrical charge, so the association of systems with morphogenetic fieldsdepends on their form. Hence a morphogenetic germ becomes surrounded by aparticular morphogenetic field because of its characteristic form. The morphogenetic germ is a part of the system-to-be. Therefore part of thesystem’s morphogenetic field corresponds to it. However, the rest of the fieldis not yet “occupied” or “filled out”; it contains the virtual form of the finalsystem, which is actualized only when all its material parts have taken up theirappropriate places. The morphogenetic field is then in coincidence with theactual form of the system. These processes are represented diagrammatically in figure 11A. The stippledareas indicate the virtual form and the solid lines the actual form of thesystem. The morphogenetic field can be thought of as a structure surrounding orembedding the morphogenetic germ and containing the virtual final form; thisfield then orders events within its range of influence in such a way that thevirtual form is actualized. In the absence of the morphic units that constitute the parts of the finalsystem, this field is undetectable; it reveals itself only through its orderingeffects on these parts when they come within its influence. A rough analogy isprovided by the “lines of force” in the magnetic field around a magnet; thesespatial structures are revealed when particles capable of being magnetized, suchas iron filings, are introduced into the vicinity. Nevertheless, the magneticfield exists even when the iron filings are absent; likewise, the morphogeneticfield around a morphogenetic germ exists as a spatial structure even though ithas not yet been actualized in the final form of the system. However,morphogenetic fields differ radically from electromagnetic fields in that thelatter depend on the actual state of the system—on the distribution and movementof charged particles—whereas morphogenetic fields correspond to the potentialstate of a developing system and are already present before it takes up itsfinal form.1 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos758474] In figure 11A, there are several intermediate stages between the morphogeneticgerm and the final form. The final form could also be reached by a differentmorphogenetic pathway (figure 11B), but if a particular pathway is usuallyfollowed, this can be regarded as a canalized pathway of change, or chreode (cf.figure 5). If the developing system is damaged by the removal of a part of it, it may stillbe able to reach the final form (figure 11C). This represents regulation. Afterthe final form is actualized, the continued association between themorphogenetic field and the system whose form corresponds to it will tend tostabilize the latter. Any deviations of the system away from this form will tendto be corrected as the system is attracted back toward it. And if part of thesystem is removed, the final form will tend to be actualized again (figure 11D).This represents regeneration. image [images/00015.jpg]Figure 11. Diagrammatic representation of the development of a system from amorphogenetic germ (triangle) by the normal chreode, A. An alternativemorphogenetic pathway is represented by B, regulation by C, and regeneration byD. The virtual form within the morphogenetic field is indicated by the stippledarea. The type of morphogenesis shown in figure 11 is essentially aggregative:previously separate morphic units come together into a higher-level morphicunit. Another type of morphogenesis is possible when the morphic unit thatserves as the morphogenetic germ is already part of a different higher-levelmorphic unit. The influence of the new morphogenetic field leads to atransformation in which the form of the original higher-level morphic unit isreplaced by the form of the new one. Most types of chemical morphogenesis areaggregative, whereas biological morphogenesis usually involves a combination oftransformative and aggregative processes. Examples are considered in thefollowing sections. 4.2 Chemical morphogenesis Aggregative morphogeneses occur progressively in inorganic systems as thetemperature is reduced: as a plasma cools, subatomic particles aggregate intoatoms; at lower temperatures, atoms aggregate into molecules; then moleculescondense into liquids; and finally liquids crystallize. In the plasma state, hydrogen atoms split up into electrons and naked atomicnuclei. The nuclei can be regarded as the morphogenetic germs of atoms; they areassociated with the atomic morphogenetic fields, which contain the virtualorbitals of electrons. In one sense these orbitals do not exist, but in anothersense they have a reality that is revealed in the cooling plasma as they areactualized by the capture of electrons. Electrons that have been captured within atomic orbitals may be displaced fromthem again through the influence of external energy, or by entering a virtualorbital of lower potential energy. In the latter case, they lose a discretequantum of energy that is radiated as a photon. In atoms with many electrons,each orbital can contain only two electrons (with opposing spins); thus in acooling plasma, the virtual orbitals with the lowest potential energies fill upwith electrons first, then the orbitals with the next lowest energies, and so onuntil the complete atomic form has been actualized around the morphogenetic germof the nucleus. Atoms are in turn the morphogenetic germs of molecules, and small molecules thegerms of larger molecules. Chemical reactions involve either the aggregation ofatoms and molecules into larger molecules— for example in the formation ofpolymers—or the fragmentation of molecules into smaller ones, or into atoms andions, which may then aggregate with others, for example in combustion: under theinfluence of external energy, molecules fragment into atoms and ions that thencombine with those of oxygen to form small, simple molecules like H2O and CO2.These chemical changes involve the actualization of virtual forms associatedwith the atoms or molecules that act as morphogenetic germs. The idea that molecules have virtual forms before they are actualized isillustrated by the familiar fact that entirely new compounds can first be“designed” on the basis of empirically determined principles of chemicalcombination and then actually synthesized by organic chemists. These laboratorysyntheses are carried out step by step; in each step a particular molecular formserves as the morphogenetic germ for the next virtual form to be synthesized,ending up with the form of the entirely new molecule. If it seems rather artificial to think of chemical reactions as morphogeneticprocesses, it should be remembered that much of the effect of catalysts, bothinorganic and organic, depends on their morphology. For example, enzymes, thespecific catalysts of the numerous reactions of biochemistry, provide surfaces,grooves, notches, or basins into which the reacting molecules fit with aspecificity that is often compared to that of a lock and key. The catalyticeffect of enzymes depends to a large extent on the way in which they holdreactant molecules in the appropriate relative positions for reaction to occur.In free solution, the chance collisions of the molecules occur in all possibleorientations, most of which are inappropriate. The details of chemical morphogeneses are vague, partly because of their greatrapidity, partly because the intermediate forms may be highly unstable, and alsobecause the ultimate changes consist of probabilistic quantum jumps of electronsbetween the orbitals that constitute the chemical bonds. The virtual form of themolecule-to-be is outlined in the morphogenetic field associated with the atomicor molecular morphogenetic germ. When the other atom or molecule approaches inan appropriate orientation, the form of the product molecule is actualized bymeans of quantum jumps of electrons into orbitals that previously existed onlyas virtual forms; at the same time, energy is released, usually as thermalmotion. The role of the morphogenetic field in this process is, as it were,energetically passive but morphologically active; it creates virtual structuresthat are then actualized as lower-level morphic units “slot” or “snap” intothem, releasing energy as they do so. Any given type of atom or molecule can take part in many different types ofchemical reaction, and it is therefore the potential germ of many differentmorphogenetic fields. These fields could be thought of as possibilities“hovering” around it. However, the atom or molecule may not take on its role asthe germ of a particular morphogenetic field until an appropriate reagent atomor molecule approaches it, perhaps owing to specific electromagnetic or othereffects upon it. The morphogenesis of crystals differs from that of atoms and molecules in that aparticular pattern of atomic or molecular arrangement is repeated indefinitely.The morphogenetic germ is provided by this pattern itself. It is well known thatthe addition of “seeds” or “nuclei” of the appropriate type of crystal greatlyaccelerates the crystallization of supercooled liquids or supersaturatedsolutions. In the absence of these seeds or nuclei, morphogenetic germs of thecrystal come into being only when the atoms or molecules take up theirappropriate relative positions by chance, owing to thermal agitation. Once thegerm is present, the virtual forms of repetitions of the lattice structure givenby the morphogenetic field extend outward from the surfaces of the growingcrystal. Appropriate free atoms or molecules that approach these surfaces arecaptured and “slot” into position; again thermal energy is released as they doso. The seeding or nucleation of supercooled liquids or supersaturated solutions canalso be carried out, although less effectively, with small fragments ofunrelated substances; for example, chemists often scratch the sides of testtubes to seed solutions with fragments of glass. These fragments providesurfaces that facilitate the appropriate relative positioning of the atoms ormolecules that constitute the true morphogenetic germ of the crystal. In theirmorphogenetic effect, these seeds resemble the catalysts of chemical reactions. All the types of chemical morphogenesis considered so far are essentiallyaggregative. Transformations are less common in nonliving systems. But crystals,for example, sometimes undergo transformation into other crystalline forms, aswhen carbon crystals in the form of graphite are transformed under hightemperature and pressure into the diamond form. Molecules can also undergotransformations, as in the folding of proteins and the reversible changes ofshape that occur when certain enzymes bind to the molecules whose reaction theycatalyze.2 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos759162] The fact that proteins fold up far more rapidly than would be expected if theyfound their final form by a random search indicates that their folding followsparticular pathways, or a limited number of pathways (section 3.4). These“canalized pathways of change” can be regarded as chreodes. For the foldingprocess to begin, according to the ideas developed in section 4.1, above, amorphogenetic germ must be present, and this germ must already have thecharacteristic three-dimensional structure that it has in the final form of theprotein. The existence of such morphogenetic starting points has in fact alreadybeen suggested in the literature on protein folding. > The extreme rapidity of the refolding makes it essential that the process> takes place along a limited number of pathways . . . It becomes necessary to> postulate the existence of a limited number of allowable initiating events in> the folding process. Such events, generally referred to as nucleations, are> most likely to occur in parts of the polypeptide chain that can participate in> conformational equilibria between random and cooperatively stabilized> arrangements . . . Furthermore it is important to stress that the amino acid> sequences of polypeptide chains designed to be the fabric of protein molecules> only make functional sense when they are in the three-dimensional arrangement> that characterizes them in the native protein molecule. It seems reasonable to> suggest that portions of a protein chain that can serve as nucleation sites> for folding will be those that can “flicker” in and out of the conformation> that they occupy in the final protein, and that they will form a relatively> rigid structure stabilized by a set of cooperative interactions.3> [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos759513] Such “nucleation sites” would act as morphogenetic germs through theirassociation with the morphogenetic field of the protein, which would thencanalize the pathway of folding toward the characteristic final form. 4.3 Morphogenetic fields as “probability structures” The orbitals of electrons around an atomic nucleus can be regarded as structureswithin the morphogenetic field of the atom. These orbitals can be described bysolutions of the Schrödinger equation. However, according to quantum mechanics,the precise orbits of electrons cannot be specified, but only the probabilitiesof finding electrons at particular points; the orbitals are regarded asprobability distributions in space. Within the context of the hypothesis offormative causation, this result suggests that just as these structures in themorphogenetic fields of atoms must be thought of as spatial probabilitydistributions, so morphogenetic fields in general are not precisely defined, butare given by probability distributions.4[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos759753] It will be assumed that this isin fact the case, and the structures of morphogenetic fields will henceforth bereferred to as probability structures.5[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos760020] An explanation for theprobabilistic nature of these fields will be suggested in section 5.4. The action of the morphogenetic field of a morphic unit on the morphogeneticfields of its parts, which are morphic units at lower levels (section 3.5), canbe thought of in terms of the influence of this higher-level probabilitystructure on lower-level probability structures; the higher-level field modifiesthe probability structures of the lower-level fields. Consequently, duringmorphogenesis, the higher-level field modifies the probability of probabilisticevents in the lower-level morphic units under its influence.6[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos760484] In the case of free atoms, electronic events take place with the probabilitiesgiven by the unmodified probability structures of the atomic morphogeneticfields. But when the atoms come under the influence of the higher-levelmorphogenetic field of a molecule, these probabilities are modified in such away that the probability of events leading toward the actualization of the finalform is enhanced, while the probability of other events is diminished. Thus themorphogenetic fields of molecules restrict the possible number of atomicconfigurations that would be expected on the basis of calculations starting fromthe probability structures of free atoms. And this is what is found: in the caseof protein folding, for example, the rapidity of the process indicates that thesystem does not explore the countless configurations in which the atoms couldconceivably be arranged (section 3.4). Similarly, the morphogenetic fields of crystals restrict the large number ofpossible arrangements that would be permitted by the probability structures oftheir constituent molecules; hence one particular pattern of moleculararrangement is taken up as the substance crystallizes, rather than any of theother conceivable structures. Thus the morphogenetic fields of crystals and molecules are probabilitystructures in the same sense as the electronic orbitals in the morphogeneticfields of atoms are probability structures. This conclusion agrees with theconventional assumption that there is no difference in kind between thedescription of simple atomic systems by quantum mechanics and a potentialquantum mechanical description of more-complex forms. But unlike the hypothesisof formative causation, the conventional theory seeks to explain complex systemsfrom the bottom up, as it were, in terms of the quantum mechanical properties ofatoms. The difference between these two approaches can be seen more clearly in ahistorical context. Quantum theory itself was primarily elaborated in connectionwith the properties of simple systems such as hydrogen atoms. As time went on,new fundamental principles were introduced in order to account for empiricalobservations such as those on the fine structure of the spectra of light emittedby atoms. The original quantum numbers characterizing the discrete electronicorbitals were supplemented by another set referring to angular momentum, andthen yet more referring to “spin.” The latter is considered to be an irreducibleproperty of particles, just as electric charge is, and has its own conservationlaw. In nuclear particle physics, yet more irreducible factors, such as“strangeness” and “charm,” together with further conservation laws, have beenintroduced more or less ad hoc in order to account for observations notexplicable in terms of the already accepted quantum factors. Moreover, thediscovery of large numbers of new subatomic particles has led to the postulationof an ever-increasing number of new kinds of matter field. When so many new physical principles and physical fields have been introduced inorder to account for the properties of atoms and subatomic particles, theconventional assumption that no new physical principles or fields come into playat levels of organization above that of the atom seems remarkably arbitrary. Itis in fact little more than a relic of nineteenth-century atomism; now thatatoms are no longer regarded as ultimate and indivisible, its originaltheoretical justification has vanished. From the point of view of the hypothesisof formative causation, although the existing body of quantum theory, developedin connection with the properties of atoms and subatomic particles, sheds muchlight on the nature of morphogenetic fields, it cannot be extrapolated todescribe the morphogenetic fields of more-complex systems. There is no reasonwhy the morphogenetic fields of atoms should be considered to have a privilegedposition in the order of nature; they are simply the fields of morphic units atone particular level of complexity. 4.4 Probabilistic processes in biological morphogenesis There are many examples of physical processes whose spatial outcomes areprobabilistic. In general, changes involving the breaking of a symmetry orhomogeneity are indeterminate; examples occur in the phase transitions betweenthe gaseous and liquid states and between the liquid and solid states. If, forinstance, a spherical balloon filled with vapor is cooled below saturation pointin the absence of external gradients of temperature and gravity, the liquid willstart by condensing on the walls, but the final distribution of the liquid willbe unpredictable, and almost never spherically symmetrical.7[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos761110] Thermodynamically, the relativeamounts of liquid and vapor can be foreseen, but their spatial distributioncannot. In the crystallization of a substance under uniform conditions, thespatial distribution and the numbers and sizes of the crystals cannot bepredicted; in other words, if the same process is to be repeated under identicalconditions, each time the spatial outcome differs in detail. The forms of crystals themselves, although they exhibit a definite symmetry, maybe indeterminate; snowflakes, which come in myriad shapes, provide a familiarexample.8 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos761407] In the “dissipative structures” of macroscopic physical and chemical systems farfrom thermodynamic equilibrium, random fluctuations can give rise to spatialpatterns, for example convection cells in a heated liquid or colored bands insolutions in which the Zhabotinski reaction is proceeding. The mathematicaldescriptions of such cases of “order through fluctuations” by the methods ofnonequilibrium thermodynamics show striking analogies to phase transitions.9[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos761610] These examples of spatial indeterminism are drawn from quite simple physical andchemical processes. In living cells, the physico-chemical systems are far morecomplex than any encountered in the inorganic realm, and include manypotentially indeterminate phase transitions and nonequilibrium thermodynamicalprocesses. In the protoplasm there are crystalline, liquid, and lipid phases indynamic interrelation; then there are numerous types of macromolecules that cometogether into crystalline or quasi-crystalline aggregates; lipid membranes,which as “liquid crystals” hover on the borderline between the liquid and solidstates, as do the colloidal sols and gels; electrical potentials acrossmembranes that fluctuate unpredictably; and “compartments,” containing differentconcentrations of inorganic ions and other substances, separated by membranesacross which these substances move probabilistically.10[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos762005] With such complexity, thenumber of energetically possible patterns of change must be enormous, and thereis thus a vast scope for the operation of morphogenetic fields through theimposition of patterns on these probabilistic processes. This is not to say that all form in living organisms is determined by formativecausation. Some patterns may come about through random processes.11[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos762264] Others may be fully explicablein terms of minimum-energy configurations: for instance, the spherical shape offree-floating egg cells (e.g., those of sea urchins) may be fully explicable interms of the surface tension of the cell membrane. Sir D’Arcy Thompson, in hisclassic essay On Growth and Form (1917), suggested that many aspects ofbiological morphogenesis could be explained in terms of physical forces: forexample, the plane of cell division in terms of surface tension, which wouldtend to give a minimum surface area. But there are so many exceptions that thesesimple interpretations have met with very little success.12[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos762597] Other explanations are needed,like morphogenetic fields. It should be reemphasized that these fields do notact alone, but together with the energetic and chemical causes studied bybiophysicists and biochemists. One example of the way morphogenetic fields could operate within cells isprovided by the positioning of microtubules, tiny rodlike structures formed bythe spontaneous aggregation of protein subunits. Microtubules play an importantrole as microscopic “scaffolds” within both animal and plant cells: they guideand orientate processes such as cell division (the spindle fibers in mitosis andmeiosis are made up of microtubules), and the patterned deposition of cell wallmaterial in differentiating plant cells; they also serve as intracellular“skeletons,” maintaining particular cellular shapes, as in radiolarians.13[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos762813] Now if the spatial distributionof microtubules is responsible for the patterning of many different sorts ofprocess and structure within cells, then what controls the spatial distributionof the microtubules? If other patterns of organization are responsible,14[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos763165] the problem is simply pushedback one stage: what controls these patterns of organization themselves? But theproblem cannot be pushed back indefinitely, because development involves anincrease in spatial diversity and organization that cannot be accounted for interms of preceding patterns or structures; sooner or later something else has toaccount for the emergence of the pattern in which the microtubules aggregate. On the present hypothesis, this pattern is due to the action of specificmorphogenetic fields. These fields greatly increase the probability ofaggregation of microtubules in appropriate dispositions either directly orindirectly, through the establishment of a preceding pattern of organization.Obviously, the patterning activity of the fields depends on the presence of asupersaturated solution of microtubule subunits within the cell, and onappropriate physical and chemical conditions for their aggregation: these arenecessary conditions for the formation of microtubules, but they are not inthemselves sufficient to account for the pattern in which the microtubulesappear. The objection might be raised that the suggested action of formative causationin patterning probabilistic processes within cells is impossible because itwould lead to a local violation of the second law of thermodynamics. But thisobjection is not valid. The second law of thermodynamics refers only toassemblies of very large numbers of particles and not to processes on amicroscopic scale. Moreover, it applies only to closed systems: a region of acell is not a closed system, nor of course are living organisms in general. In living organisms, as in the chemical realm, morphogenetic fields arehierarchically organized: those of organelles—for example, the cell nucleus, themitochondria, and chloroplasts—act by ordering physicochemical processes withinthem; these fields are subject to the higher-level fields of cells; the fieldsof cells to those of tissues; those of tissues to those of organs; and of organsto the morphogenetic field of the organism as a whole. At each level the fieldswork by ordering processes that would otherwise be indeterminate. For example,at the cellular level the morphogenetic field orders the crystallization ofmicrotubules and other processes that are necessary for the coordination of celldivision. But the planes in which the cells divide may be indeterminate in theabsence of a higher-level field: for instance, in plant wound calluses the cellsproliferate more or less randomly to produce a chaotic mass.15[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos763904] Within an organized tissue, on the other hand, one of the functions of thetissue’s morphogenetic field may be to impose a pattern on the planes of celldivision, and thus control the way in which the tissue as a whole grows. Thenthe development of tissues may itself be inherently indeterminate in manyrespects, as revealed when they are artificially isolated and grown in tissueculture;16 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos764248] under normalconditions this indeterminacy is restricted by the higher-level field of theorgan. Indeed at each level in biological systems, as in chemical systems, themorphic units in isolation behave more indeterminately than they do when theyare part of a higher-level morphic unit. The higher-level morphogenetic fieldrestricts and patterns their intrinsic indeterminism. 4.5 Morphogenetic germs in biological systems At the cellular level, the germs for morphogenetic transformations must belower-level morphic units within the cells: they could be organelles,macromolecular aggregates, cytoplasmic or membranous structures, or the cellnuclei. In many cases nuclei might well play this role. But since so manydifferent types of differentiated cell can be produced in the same organism, ifthe nuclei are to act as morphogenetic germs, they must be capable of taking ondifferent patterns of organization in the different cell types: thedifferentiation of a cell must be preceded by a differentiation of its nucleus,owing to changes in its membrane, or in the arrangement of its chromosomes, orin the associations between proteins and nucleic acids within the chromosomes,or in the nucleoli, or in other components. Such changes could be brought aboutdirectly or indirectly through the action of the higher-level morphogeneticfield of the differentiating tissue. There is indeed considerable evidence thatmany types of cellular differentiation are preceded by nuclear changes. Thesuggestion advanced here diverges from the usual interpretation of these changesin regarding their significance as not simply chemical, owing to the productionof special types of messenger RNA, but, in addition, as morphogenetic: themodified nuclei might serve as germs with which the specific morphogeneticfields of differentiated cells become associated.17[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos764475] There is at least one process of cellular morphogenesis in which the nucleuscannot be the morphogenetic germ: in nuclear division. It loses its identity asa separate structure when the nuclear membrane breaks down and disappears.18[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos765079] The doubled, highly coiledchromosomes become aligned in the equatorial region of the mitotic spindle and acomplete set then moves to each spindle pole. Then new nuclear membranes developaround each set of chromosomes to form the daughter nuclei. The morphogeneticgerms for these processes must be extra-nuclear structures or organelles, andthere must be two of them. In animals the centrioles, barrel-shaped organelleswhose walls are made up of microtubules, may appear to be likely candidates forthis role, because they are located near the spindle poles of dividing cells,but higher plants have no centrioles. In both cases “microtubule organizingcenters” may well be responsible for the development of the spindle poles; thecentrioles may be merely “passengers” assured of equal partitioning intodaughter cells by association with these centers.19[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos765450] The centrioles serve asorganizing centers, or morphogenetic germs, for the development of cilia andflagella, and this may be their primary role. The development of tissues and organs usually involves both transformative andaggregative changes. In morphogenesis, the morphogenetic germs must be groups ofcells that are present at the beginning of the morphogenetic process; theycannot be those specialized cells that appear only after the process has begun.Thus the morphogenetic germs are likely to be relatively unspecialized cellsthat undergo little change. In higher plants such cells are present, forexample, in the apical zones of the meristems or growing points.20[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos765660] In shoots, the floweringstimulus transforms the meristems in such a way that they give rise to flowersrather than leaves; the apical zones, suitably modified by the floweringstimulus, are the morphogenetic germs for the formation of flowers. In animalembryos, embryologists have identified many “organizing centers” that play a keyrole in the development of tissues and organs; one example is the apicalectodermal ridge at the tip of developing limb buds.21[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos765857] These “organizing centers” maywell be the germs with which the major morphogenetic fields become associated. Although the presence of morphogenetic germs can be suggested, if not actuallyidentified, in both the chemical and biological realms, much remains obscure,especially the reason for the particular form of each morphogenetic field andfor the way in which it becomes associated with its germ. The consideration ofthese problems in the following chapter leads to a more complete hypothesis offormative causation that, although surprising and unfamiliar, is perhaps lessdifficult to understand. "},{"pageContent":"5 image [images/00003.jpg] THE INFLUENCE OF PAST FORMS 5.1 The constancy and repetition of forms Time after time when atoms come into existence, electrons fill the same orbitalsaround the nuclei; atoms repeatedly combine to give the same molecular forms;again and again molecules crystallize into the same patterns; seeds of a givenspecies give rise year after year to plants of the same appearance; generationafter generation, spiders spin the same types of web. Forms come into beingrepeatedly, and each time each form is more or less the same as the previousversions. On this fact depends our ability to recognize, identify, and namethings. This constancy and repetition would present no problem if changeless physicallaws or principles uniquely determined all forms. This assumption is implicit inthe conventional theory of the causation of form. These fundamental physicalprinciples are taken to be temporally prior to the actual forms of things:theoretically, the way in which a newly synthesized chemical will crystallizeshould be calculable before its crystals appear for the first time; likewise,the effects of a given mutation in the DNA of an animal or plant on the form ofthe organism should be predictable in advance. But such calculations have neverbeen made; this comfortable assumption is untested, and is in practiceuntestable. By contrast, according to the hypothesis of formative causation, the known lawsof physics do not uniquely determine the forms of complex chemical andbiological systems. These laws permit a range of possibilities between whichformative causes select. The repeated association of the same type ofmorphogenetic field with a given type of physicochemical system explains theconstancy and repetition of forms. But then what determines the particular formof the morphogenetic field? One possible answer is that morphogenetic fields are eternal. They are simplygiven, and are not explicable in terms of anything else. Thus even before thisplanet appeared, there already existed in a latent state the morphogeneticfields of all the chemicals, crystals, animals, and plants that have everoccurred on the Earth, or that will ever come into being in the future. This answer is essentially Platonic, or even Aristotelian insofar as Aristotlebelieved in the eternal fixity of specific forms. It differs from theconventional physical theory in that these forms would not be predictable interms of energetic causation; but it agrees with it in taking for granted thatbehind all empirical phenomena lie preexisting principles of order. The other possible answer is radically different. Chemical and biological formsare repeated not because they are determined by changeless laws or eternalforms, but because of a causal influence from previous similar forms. Thisinfluence would require an action across space and time unlike any known type ofphysical action. On this view, the unique form taken up by a system would not be physicallydetermined in advance of its first appearance. Nevertheless it would berepeated, because the form of the first system would itself determine the formtaken up by subsequent, similar systems. Imagine, for instance, that out ofseveral different possible forms, P, Q, R, S . . . all of which are equallyprobable from an energetic point of view, a system happens to take up form R onthe first occasion. Then on subsequent occasions similar systems will also takeup form R because of a trans-spatial and trans-temporal influence from the firstsuch system. In this case, what determines the form on the first occasion? No scientificanswer can be given: the question concerns unique and energeticallyindeterminate events that, ex hypothesi, once they have happened areunrepeatable because they themselves influence all subsequent similar events.Science can deal only with regularities, with things that are repeatable. Theinitial choice of a particular form could be ascribed to chance, or tocreativity inherent in matter, or to a transcendent creative agency. But thereis no way in which these different possibilities could be distinguished fromeach other by experiment. A decision between them could be made only onmetaphysical grounds. This question is discussed in the final chapter of thisbook, but for present purposes it does not matter which of these possibilitiesis preferred. The hypothesis of formative causation is concerned only with therepetition of forms, and not with the reasons for their appearance in the firstplace. This new way of thinking is unfamiliar, and it leads into uncharted territory.But only by exploring it does there seem to be any hope of arriving at a newscientific understanding of form and organization in general, and of livingorganisms in particular. The alternative to going on would be to return to thestarting point; the choice would once again be narrowed to that between anunquestioning faith in future mechanistic explanations and a metaphysical orPlatonic organicism. In the following discussion, it is proposed that this hypothetical trans-spatialand trans-temporal influence passes through morphogenetic fields and is anessential feature of formative causation. 5.2 The general possibility of trans-temporal causal connections Although the hypothesis of formative causation proposes a new kind oftrans-temporal, or diachronic, causal connection that has not so far beenrecognized by science, the possibility of “action at a distance” in time hasalready been considered in general terms by several philosophers. There seems tobe no a priori reason for excluding it. The philosopher John Mackie, forexample, wrote as follows: > While we are happiest about contiguous cause-effect relations, and find> “action at a distance” over either a spatial or temporal gap puzzling, we do> not rule it out. Our ordinary concept of causation does not absolutely require> contiguity; it is not part of our idea of causation in a way that would make> “C caused E over a spatial, or temporal, or both spatial and temporal, gap,> without intermediate links” a contradiction in terms.1> [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos766259] Moreover, from the point of view of the philosophy of science, there is nothingto prevent the consideration of new kinds of causal connection. As thephilosopher of science Mary Hesse observed: > Scientific theory in general does not presuppose any particular mode of causal> connection between events, but only that it is possible to find laws and> hypotheses, expressed in terms of some model, which satisfy the criteria of> intelligibility, confirmation, and falsifiability. The mode of causal> connection in each case is shown by the model, and changes with fundamental> changes of model.2 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos766480] However, although the new kind of causal connection proposed in the hypothesisof formative causation seems to be possible in principle, the plausibility ofthis hypothesis can be assessed only after predictions deduced from it have beentested empirically. 5.3 Morphic resonance The idea of a process whereby the forms of previous systems influence themorphogenesis of subsequent similar systems is difficult to express in terms ofexisting concepts. The only way to proceed is by means of analogy. The physical analogy that seems most appropriate is that of resonance. Energeticresonance occurs when an alternating force acting on a system coincides with itsnatural frequency of vibration. Examples include the “sympathetic” vibration ofstretched strings in response to appropriate sound waves; the tuning of radiosets to the frequency of radio waves given out by transmitters; the absorptionof light waves of particular frequencies by atoms and molecules, resulting intheir characteristic absorption spectra; and the response of electrons andatomic nuclei in the presence of magnetic fields to electromagnetic radiation inElectronic Spin Resonance and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. Common to all thesetypes of resonance is the principle of selectivity: out of a mixture ofvibrations, however complicated, the systems respond only to particularfrequencies. A resonant effect of form upon form across space and time would resembleenergetic resonance in its selectivity, but it could not be accounted for interms of any of the known types of resonance, nor would it involve atransmission of energy. In order to distinguish it from energetic resonance,this process will be called morphic resonance. Morphic resonance is analogous to energetic resonance in a further respect: ittakes place between vibrating systems. Atoms, molecules, crystals, organelles,cells, tissues, organs, and organisms are all made up of parts in ceaselessoscillation, and all have their own characteristic patterns of vibration andinternal rhythm; the morphic units are dynamic, not static.3[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos766669] But whereas energetic resonancedepends only on the specificity of response to particular frequencies, to“one-dimensional” stimuli,4 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos767067]morphic resonance depends on three-dimensional patterns of vibration. By morphicresonance the form of a system, including its characteristic internal structureand vibrational frequencies, becomes present to a subsequent system with asimilar form; the spatio-temporal pattern of the former superimposes itself onthe latter. Morphic resonance takes place through morphogenetic fields and indeed gives riseto their characteristic structures. Not only does a specific morphogenetic fieldinfluence the form of a system (as discussed in the previous chapter), but alsothe form of this system influences the morphogenetic field and through itbecomes present to subsequent similar systems. 5.4 The influence of the past Morphic resonance is nonenergetic, and morphogenetic fields themselves areneither a type of mass nor energy. Therefore there seems to be no a priorireason why it should obey the laws that have been found to apply to the movementof bodies, particles, and waves. In particular, it need not be attenuated byeither spatial or temporal separation between similar systems; it could be justas effective over 10,000 miles as over an inch, and over a century as over anhour. The assumption that morphic resonance is not attenuated by time and space willbe adopted as a provisional working hypothesis, on the ground of simplicity. Itwill also be assumed on the ground of simplicity that morphic resonance takesplace only from the past, that only morphic units that have already actuallyexisted are able to exert a morphic influence in the present. The notion thatfuture systems, which do not yet exist, might be able to exert a causalinfluence “backward” in time may perhaps be logically conceivable;5[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos767822] but only if there werepersuasive empirical evidence for a physical influence from future morphic unitswould it become necessary to take this possibility seriously.6[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos768187] However, assuming that morphic resonance occurs only from past morphic units andthat it is not attenuated by the lapse of time or by distance, how might it takeplace? The process can be visualized with the help of several differentmetaphors. The morphic influence of a past system might become present to asubsequent similar system by passing “beyond” space-time and then “reentering”wherever and whenever a similar pattern of vibration appeared. Or it might beconnected through other “dimensions.” Or it might go through a space-time“tunnel” to emerge unchanged in the presence of a subsequent similar system. Orthe morphic influence of past systems might simply be present everywhere.However, these different ways of thinking about morphic resonance would probablynot be distinguishable from each other experimentally. All would have the sameconsequence: the forms of past systems would automatically become present tosubsequent similar systems. Morphic resonance would lead to the reinforcement ofsimilarity. An immediate implication of this hypothesis is that a given system could beinfluenced by all past systems with a similar form and pattern of vibration. Exhypothesi, the influence of these past systems is not attenuated by temporal orspatial separation. Nevertheless, the ability of past systems to influencesubsequent systems could be weakened or exhausted by action; they could haveonly a limited potential influence that is expended in morphic resonance. Thispossibility is discussed in section 5.5 below. But first consider thepossibility that their potential action is not reduced in this way, with theconsequence that the forms of all past systems influence all subsequent similarsystems (figure 12). This postulate has several important consequences: (1) The first system with a given form influences the second such system, andthen both the first and the second influence the third, and so on cumulatively.In this process the direct influence of a given system on any subsequent systemis progressively diluted as time goes on; although its absolute effect does notdiminish, its relative effect declines as the total number of similar pastsystems increase (figure 12). image [images/00016.jpg]Figure 12. Diagram illustrating the cumulative influence of past systems onsubsequent similar systems by morphic resonance. (2) The forms of even the simplest chemical morphic units are variable:subatomic particles are in ceaseless vibratory motion, and atoms and moleculesare subject to deformation by mechanical collision and by electrical andmagnetic fields. Biological morphic units are still more variable; even if cellsand organisms have the same genetic constitution and develop under the sameconditions, they are not identical in every respect. By morphic resonance, theforms of all similar past systems become present to a subsequent system ofsimilar form. Even assuming that differences in absolute size are adjusted for(see section 6.3, below), many of these forms will differ from each other indetail. Hence they will not coincide with each other exactly when they aresuperimposed by morphic resonance. The result will be a process of automaticaveraging whereby those features that most past systems have in common will bereinforced. However, this “average” form will not be sharply defined within themorphogenetic field, but surrounded by a “blur” owing to the effect of lesscommon variants. This process can be visualized more easily by analogy with“composite photographs,” made by superimposing the photographic images ofdifferent individuals. As a result of this superimposition, the common featuresare reinforced; but because of the differences among the individual images, the“average” photographs are not sharply defined (see figures 13 and 14). (3) The automatic averaging of past forms will result in a spatial probabilitydistribution within the morphogenetic field, or, in other words, a probabilitystructure (section 4.3). The probability structure of a morphogenetic fielddetermines the probable state of a given system under its influence inaccordance with the actual states of all similar systems in the past; the mostprobable form the system will take up is that which has occurred most frequentlyalready. (4) In the early stages of a form’s history, the morphogenetic field will berelatively ill-defined and significantly influenced by individual variants. Butas time goes on, the cumulative influence of countless previous systems willconfer an ever-increasing stability on the field; the more probable the averagetype becomes, the more likely that it will be repeated in the future. To put itin a different way: At first the basin of attraction of the morphogenetic fieldwill be relatively shallow, but it will become progressively deeper as thenumber of systems contributing to morphic resonance increases. Or to use yetanother metaphor, through repetition the form will get into a rut, and the moreoften it is repeated, the deeper will this rut become. image [images/00017.jpg]Figure 13.

(From Pearson, 1924. Reproduced by courtesy ofCambridge University Press) Below: Composite photographs of thirty female andforty-five male members of the staff of the John Innes Institute, Norwich, U.K.(Reproduced by courtesy of the John Innes Institute) (5) The amount of influence a given system has on subsequent similar systemsseems likely to depend on the length of time it survives: one that continues toexist for a year may have more effect than one that disintegrates after asecond. Thus the automatic averaging may be “weighted” in favor of long-lastingprevious forms. (6) At the beginning of a morphogenetic process, the morphogenetic germ comesinto morphic resonance with similar past systems that are part of higher-levelmorphic units: it thus becomes associated with the morphogenetic field of thehigher-level morphic unit (section 4.1). Let the morphogenetic germ berepresented by morphic unit F and the final form toward which the system isattracted by D-E-F-G-H. Let the intermediate stages in the morphogenesis be asshown in figure 15. Now not only will the morphogenetic germ and theintermediate stages enter into morphic resonance with the final form of previoussimilar systems, but the intermediate stages will also enter into morphicresonance with similar intermediate stages E-F, D-E-F, etc., in previous similarmorphogeneses. Thus these stages will be stabilized by morphic resonance,resulting in a chreode. image [images/00019.jpg]Figure 15. Diagram representing stages in the aggregative morphogenesis of themorphic unit D-E-F-G-H from the morphogenetic germ F. The more frequently this particular pathway of morphogenesis is followed, themore will this chreode be reinforced. In terms of the “epigenetic landscape”model (figure 5), the valley of the chreode will be deepened the more oftendevelopment passes along it. 5.5 Implications of an attenuated morphic resonance The discussion in the preceding section was based on the assumption that themorphic influence of a given system is not exhausted in its action on subsequentsimilar systems, although its relative effect is diluted as the number ofsimilar systems increases. The alternative possibility that this influence issomehow exhausted will now be considered. If such exhaustion takes place, onlyif the rate of exhaustion were very fast would it be detectable. Consider firstthe extreme case, in which the influence of a system is expended by morphicresonance with only one subsequent system. If the number of similar systemsincreases with time, then most of them will not be influenced by morphicresonance from previous similar systems (see figure 16A). They will consequentlybe free to take up different forms by “chance” or “creativity”; the forms ofthese systems may therefore be very variable. Next consider the case in which each system can influence two subsequentsystems. In the situation represented in figure 16B, most but not all of thesubsequent forms would be stabilized by morphic resonance. If each systeminfluenced three subsequent systems, all would be stabilized; an instability ofform would appear only if the number of subsequent similar systems increasedmore rapidly still, as in a population explosion. And if each system influencedmany subsequent systems, this low but finite rate of exhaustion of morphicinfluence would be practically undetectable. image [images/00020.jpg]Figure 16. Diagram illustrating situations in which the influence of previoussystems is exhausted by morphic resonance with only one subsequent system (A)and two subsequent systems (B). For the sake of simplicity, it will be assumed that the morphic influence ofsystems on subsequent similar systems is not exhausted, but this assumption isprovisional. The question could eventually be investigated empirically, at leastto the extent of distinguishing between a rapid rate of exhaustion of morphicinfluence on the one hand and a slow or zero rate on the other. 5.6 An experimental test with crystals According to the conventional theory, the unique forms of chemical andbiological systems should be predictable in terms of the principles of quantummechanics, electromagnetism, energetic causation, etc., before they come intobeing for the first time. By contrast, according to the hypothesis of formativecausation, unique forms will not be predictable in advance, but only a range ofpossible forms. Thus, in principle, the failure of the conventional theory togive rise to unique predictions would provide evidence against it and in favorof the hypothesis of formative causation. But in practice this failure couldnever be conclusive: only approximate calculations are feasible, and thereforedefenders of this theory will always be able to argue that unique predictionsmight be possible if more-refined calculations were carried out in the future. Fortunately, the hypothesis of formative causation differs from the conventionaltheory in a second important respect. According to the latter, the laws thatgive rise to a form on the first occasion, or on the hundredth, or thebillionth, should operate in exactly the same way, since they are assumed to bechangeless. The same expectation follows from theories that seek to account forempirically observable forms in terms of eternal archetypal forms ortranscendent mathematical truths. But according to the hypothesis of formative causation, the form of a systemdepends on the cumulative morphic influence of previous similar systems. Thusthis influence will be stronger on the billionth occasion than on the thousandthor the tenth. If this cumulative aspect of formative causation could bedemonstrated empirically, the hypothesis could be distinguished both from theconventional theory and from theories of the Platonic and Pythagorean types. In the case of morphic units that have existed for a very long time— billions ofyears in the case of the hydrogen atom—the morphogenetic field will be so wellestablished as to be effectively changeless. Even the fields of morphic unitsthat originated a few decades ago may be subject to the influence of so manypast systems that any increments in this influence will be too small to bedetectable. But with brand-new forms, it may well be possible to detect acumulative morphic influence experimentally. Consider a newly synthesized organic chemical that has never existed before.According to the hypothesis of formative causation, its crystalline form willnot be predictable in advance, and no morphogenetic field for this form will yetexist. But after it has been crystallized for the first time, the form of itscrystals will influence subsequent crystallizations by morphic resonance, andthe more often it is crystallized, the stronger should this influence become.Thus on the first occasion, the substance may not crystallize at all readily,but on subsequent occasions crystallization should occur more and more easily asincreasing numbers of past crystals contribute to its morphogenetic field bymorphic resonance. In fact, chemists who have synthesized entirely new chemicals often have greatdifficulty in getting these substances to crystallize. But as time goes on,these substances tend to crystallize with greater and greater ease. Sometimesmany years pass before crystals first appear. For example, turanose, a kind ofsugar, was considered to be a liquid for decades, but after it firstcrystallized in the 1920s, it formed crystals all over the world.7[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos768803] Even more striking are cases inwhich one kind of crystal appears and is then replaced by another. For example,xylitol, a sugar alcohol used as a sweetener in chewing gum, was first preparedin 1891 and was considered to be a liquid until 1942, when a form with a meltingpoint of 61°C crystallized out. Several years later another form appeared, witha melting point of 94°C, and thereafter the first form could not be made again.8[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos769065] Crystals of the same compound that exist in different forms are calledpolymorphs. In many cases they can coexist, like calcite and aragonite, whichare both crystalline forms of calcium carbonate, or like graphite and diamond,both crystalline forms of carbon. But sometimes, as in the case of xylitol, theappearance of a new polymorph can displace an old one. This principle isillustrated in the following account, taken from a textbook on crystallography,of the spontaneous and unexpected appearance of a new type of crystal: > About ten years ago a company was operating a factory that grew large single> crystals of ethylene diamine tartrate from solution in water. From this plant> it shipped the crystals many miles to another which cut and polished them for> industrial use. A year after the factory opened, the crystals in the growing> tanks began to grow badly; crystals of something else adhered to> them—something which grew even more rapidly. The affliction soon spread to the> other factory: the cut and polished crystals acquired the malady on their> surfaces . . . The wanted material was anhydrous ethylene diamine tartrate, and the unwantedmaterial turned out to be the monohydrate of that substance. During three yearsof research and development, and another year of manufacture, no seed of themonohydrate had formed. After that, they seemed to be everywhere.9[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos769191] These authors suggest that on other planets, types of crystal that are common onEarth may not yet have appeared, and add: “Perhaps in our own world many otherpossible solid species are still unknown, not because their ingredients arelacking, but simply because suitable seeds have not yet put in an appearance.”10[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos769415] The replacement of one polymorph by another is a recurrent problem in thepharmaceutical industry. For example, the antibiotic ampicillin was firstcrystallized as a monohydrate, with one molecule of water of crystallization perampicillin molecule. In the 1960s it started to crystallize as a trihydrate,with a different crystal form, and despite persistent efforts, the monohydratecould not be made again.11 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos769547] Ritonavir, an AIDS drug made by Abbott Laboratories, was introduced in 1996. Thedrug had been on the market for eighteen months when suddenly, duringmanufacturing, chemical engineers found a previously unknown polymorph. No oneknew what had caused the change, and the Abbott team could not find a way tostop the new polymorph forming. Within a few days of its discovery, it wasdominating the production lines. Although the two polymorphs had the samechemical formula, their structural dissimilarity made a difference to patients.The second form was only half as soluble as the first, so patients taking thenormal prescribed doses would not absorb enough of the drug. Abbott had to pullritonavir from the market. The company went on a crash program to try to get its original polymorph back.It eventually succeeded in producing the first form again but could not make thepolymorph reliably, and kept getting mixtures of the two forms. The companyfinally decided to reformulate the drug in the second polymorphic form as aliquid gel capsule containing the drug in a dissolved form. The company spenthundreds of millions of dollars trying to recover the first polymorph, and lostan estimated $250 million in sales the year the drug was withdrawn.12[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos769810] The inability of chemists to control some kinds of crystallization is a seriouschallenge. As the crystallographer Joel Bernstein remarked, “The loss of controlis indeed disturbing, and might even call into question the criterion ofreproducibility as a condition for acceptance of a phenomenon as being worthy ofscientific enquiry.”13 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos770058] Completereproducibility would be expected on the assumption that all the laws of natureare eternal, the same at all times and in all places. But disappearingpolymorphs make it clear that chemistry is not timeless. It is historical andevolutionary, like biology. What happens now depends on what has happenedbefore. The most obvious explanation for the disappearance of polymorphs is that the newforms were more stable thermodynamically, and hence appeared in preference tothe older forms. In competition with each other, the new forms won. Before thenew forms existed, there was no competition; after they had come into being,they turned up in laboratories all over the world, and the older formsdisappeared. As an American chemist, Charles P. Saylor, commented, it was “asthough the seeds of crystallization, as dust, had been carried upon the windsfrom end to end of the earth.”14[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos770274] There is no doubt that small fragments of previous crystals can act as “seeds”or “nuclei” and facilitate the process of crystallization from a supersaturatedsolution. That is why chemists have always assumed that the spread of newcrystallization processes depends on the transfer of seeds from laboratory tolaboratory, like a kind of infection. One favorite story in the folklore ofchemistry is that these seeds are carried around the world from lab to lab bymigrant scientists, especially chemists with beards, which “can harbor nucleifor almost any crystallization process,” in the words of a professor of chemicalengineering at Cambridge University.15[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos770547] Alternatively, the crystalseeds are supposed to have been blown around in the atmosphere as microscopicparticles of dust and then settled in crystallizing dishes, where they catalyzedthe crystallization of the new substance. Thus the formation of new kinds of crystals provides one way of testing thehypothesis of morphic resonance. According to the conventional assumption,crystals should not form more readily in a laboratory in Australia after theyhave been made in a laboratory in Britain if visitors from the Britishlaboratory are rigorously excluded, and if dust particles are filtered out ofthe atmosphere. If in fact they do form more rapidly, then this result wouldfavor morphic resonance. The effects of morphic resonance could be investigated by comparing thecrystallization of several newly synthesized chemicals, say four. The rate atwhich the crystals form is determined under standardized conditions. Then one ofthese four compounds is selected at random, made in large quantities, andcrystallized repeatedly. Now, in a different laboratory hundreds of miles away,all four compounds are crystallized again under the same standard conditions asbefore. The hypothesis of formative causation would predict that the randomlyselected compound should now crystallize more rapidly than it did before, butthere should be little or no change in the rate of crystallization of the otherthree. Further experiments with crystals are discussed in appendix A, and in sectionsA.2 and A.3. Examples of possible experiments with biological systems arediscussed in sections 7.4, 7.6, 7.9, 11.2, and 11.4.

The crystals thenretain their form indefinitely as long as the temperature remains below theirmelting point. By contrast, in living organisms morphogenetic processes continueindefinitely in the endlessly repeated cycles of growth and reproduction. The simplest living organisms consist of single cells, the growth of which isfollowed by division, and division by growth. Thus the morphogenetic germs forthe chreodes of division must appear within the final forms of the fully growncells, and the newly divided cells serve as the starting points for the chreodesof cellular growth and development. In multicellular organisms, these cycles continue in only some of the cells, forexample in germ cell lines, stem cells, and meristematic cells. Other cells, andindeed whole tissues and organs, develop into a variety of specializedstructures that undergo little further morphogenetic change: they stop growing,although they may retain the ability to regenerate after damage; and sooner orlater they die. In fact, they may be mortal precisely because they cease togrow.1 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos770910] The development of multicellular organisms takes place through a series ofstages controlled by a succession of morphogenetic fields. At first theembryonic tissues develop under the control of primary embryonic fields. Then,sooner (in “mosaic” development) or later (in “regulative” development),different regions come under the influence of secondary fields, in animals thoseof limbs, eyes, ears, etc.; in plants of leaves, petals, stamens, etc. Generallyspeaking, the morphogenesis brought about by the primary fields is notspectacular, but it is of fundamental importance because it establishes thecharacteristic differences between cells in different regions that enable themto act as the morphogenetic germs of the organ fields. Then in the tissuesdeveloping under their influence, germs of subsidiary fields appear, fields thatcontrol the morphogenesis of structures within the organ as a whole: in a leaf,the lamina, stipules, petiole, etc.; in an eye, the cornea, iris, lens, etc. Andthen still lower-level morphogenetic fields come into play: for example, thosefor vascular differentiation within the lamina of a leaf, and for thedifferentiation of stomata and hair cells on its surface. These fields can be, and have been, investigated experimentally by studying theability of developing organisms to regulate after damage to different regions ofthe embryonic tissue, and after grafting tissue taken from one region intoanother. Both in animal embryos and in the meristematic zones of plants, as thedifferentiation of the tissues proceeds, the different regions behave withincreasing autonomy; the system as a whole loses the ability to regulate, butlocal regulations occur within the developing organs as more numerous secondaryfields supplant the primary embryonic fields.2[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos771840] 6.2 The polarity of morphogenetic fields Most biological morphic units are polarized in at least one direction. Theirmorphogenetic fields, containing polarized virtual forms, will automaticallytake up appropriate orientations if their morphogenetic germs are alsointrinsically polarized; but if they are not, a polarity must first be imposedon them. For example, the spherical egg cells of the alga Fucus have no inherentpolarity, and their development can begin only after they have been polarized byany one of a variety of directional stimuli including light, chemical gradients,and electric currents; in the absence of any such stimuli, a polarity is takenup at random, presumably owing to chance fluctuations. Nearly all multicellular organisms are polarized in a shoot–root or head–taildirection, many also in a second direction (ventral–dorsal), and some in three(head–tail, ventral–dorsal, and left–right). The latter are consequentlyasymmetrical and potentially capable of existing in forms that are mirror-imagesof each other; for example, most people have their heart on the left side, but afew have it on the right. In the condition known as situs inversus totalis, theposition of all the chest and abdominal organs is reversed. Structures that are bilaterally symmetrical necessarily occur in both right- andleft-handed forms, for example right and left hands. These mirror-image formshave the same morphology, and they presumably develop under the influence of thesame morphogenetic field. The field simply takes on the handedness of themorphogenetic germ with which it becomes associated. Thus both right- andleft-handed previous systems influence both right- and left-handed subsequentsystems by morphic resonance. This interpretation is supported by some well-known facts of biochemistry. Themolecules of amino acids and sugars are asymmetric and are capable of existingin both left- and right-handed forms. Yet in living organisms, all the aminoacids in proteins are left-handed, while most of the sugars are right-handed.The perpetuation of these chemical asymmetries is made possible by theasymmetric structures of the enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of themolecules. In nature, most of the amino acids and sugars occur rarely, if atall, outside living organisms. Therefore these particular asymmetric formsshould contribute overwhelmingly by morphic resonance to the morphogeneticfields of the molecules. But when they are synthesized artificially, equalproportions of right-and left-handed forms are obtained, indicating that themorphogenetic fields have no intrinsic handedness. 6.3 The size of morphogenetic fields The dimensions of particular atomic and molecular morphic units are more or lessconstant; so are those of crystal lattices, although they are repeatedindefinitely to give crystals of different sizes. Biological morphic units aremore variable: not only are there differences between cells, organs, andorganisms of given types, but also individual morphic units themselves changesize as they grow. If morphic resonance is to take place from past systems withsimilar forms but different sizes, and if a particular morphogenetic field is toremain associated with a growing system, then forms must be capable of being“scaled up” or “scaled down” within the morphogenetic field. Thus theiressential features must depend not on the absolute but on the relative positionsof their component parts, and on their relative rates of vibration. A simpleanalogy is provided by the music produced by playing a tape recording atdifferent speeds: it remains recognizable in spite of absolute alterations inall the pitches and rhythms because the relations of the notes and rhythms toeach other remain the same. Although morphogenetic fields may be adjustable in absolute size, the rangewithin which the size of a system can vary is limited by severe physicalconstraints. In three-dimensional systems, changes in surface area and volumevary respectively as the square and cubic powers of the linear dimensions. Thissimple fact means that biological systems cannot be magnified or diminishedindefinitely without becoming unstable.3[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos772157] 6.4 The increasing specificity of morphic resonance during morphogenesis Energetic resonance is not an “all-or-none” process: a system resonates inresponse to a range of frequencies that are more or less close to its naturalfrequency, although the maximum response occurs only when the frequencycoincides with its own. Analogously, morphic resonance may be more or lessfinely “tuned,” occurring with greatest specificity when the forms of past andpresent systems are most closely similar. When a morphogenetic germ comes into morphic resonance with the forms ofcountless previous higher-level systems, these forms do not coincide exactly butgive rise to a probability structure. As the first stages of morphogenesis takeplace, structures are actualized at particular places within the regions givenby the probability structure. The system now has a more developed and betterdefined form, and will consequently resemble the forms of some previous similarsystems more closely than others; the morphic resonance from these forms will bemore specific and hence more effective. And as development proceeds, theselectivity of morphic resonance will increase still further. A very general illustration of this principle is given by the development of anorganism from a fertilized egg. The early stages of embryology often resemblethose of numerous other species, or even families and orders. As developmentproceeds, the particular features of the order, family, genus, and finallyspecies tend to appear sequentially, and the relatively minor differences thatdistinguish the individual organism from other individuals of the same speciesgenerally appear last. This increasingly specific morphic resonance will tend to canalize developmenttoward particular variants of the final form that were expressed in previousorganisms. The detailed pathway of development will be affected by both geneticand environmental factors: an organism of a particular genetic constitution willtend to develop in such a way that it enters into specific morphic resonancewith previous individuals with the same genetic constitution; and environmentaleffects on development will tend to bring the organism under the specificmorphic influence of previous organisms that developed in the same environment. Previous similar morphic units that were part of the same organism will have aneven more specific effect. For example, in the development of leaves on a tree,the forms of previous leaves on the same tree are likely to make a particularlysignificant contribution to the morphogenetic field, tending to stabilize theleaf form characteristic of this particular tree. 6.5 The maintenance and stability of forms At the end of a process of morphogenesis, the actual form of a system comes intocoincidence with the virtual form given by the morphogenetic field. Thecontinued association of the system with its field is revealed most clearly inthe phenomenon of regeneration. The restoration of the form of the system aftersmall deviations from the final form is less obvious, but no less important: itsmorphogenetic field continuously stabilizes the morphic unit. In biologicalsystems, and to some extent in chemical systems, this maintenance of formenables the morphic units to persist even though their constituent parts changeas they are “turned over” and replaced. The morphogenetic field itself persists,owing to the continuing influence of the forms of similar past systems. An extraordinarily interesting feature of the morphic resonance acting on asystem with a persisting form is that this resonance will include a contributionfrom the past states of the system itself. Insofar as a system resembles itselfin the past more closely than it resembles any other past system, thisself-resonance will be highly specific. It may in fact be of the mostfundamental importance in maintaining the very identity of the system. Matter can no longer be thought of as made up of solid particles like tinybilliard balls that endure throughout time. Material systems are dynamicstructures that are constantly re-creating themselves. On the presenthypothesis, the persistence of material forms depends on a continuously repeatedactualization of the system under the influence of its morphogenetic field; atthe same time, the morphogenetic field is continuously re-created by morphicresonance from similar past forms. The forms that are most similar and that willconsequently have the greatest effect will be those of the system itself in theimmediate past. This conclusion would appear to have profound physicalimplications: the preferential resonance of a system with itself in theimmediate past could conceivably help to account for its persistence not only intime, but also at a particular place.4[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos772504] 6.6 A note on physical “dualism” All actual morphic units can be regarded as forms of energy. On the one hand,their structures and patterns of activity depend on the morphogenetic fieldswith which they are associated and under the influence of which they have comeinto being. On the other hand, their very existence and their ability tointeract with other material systems is due to the energy bound within them. Butalthough these aspects of form and energy can be separated conceptually, inreality they are always associated with each other. No morphic unit can haveenergy without form, and no material form can exist without energy. This physical “duality” of form and energy that is made explicit by thehypothesis of formative causation has much in common with the so-calledwave-particle duality of quantum theory. According to the hypothesis offormative causation, there is only a difference of degree between themorphogenesis of atoms and that of molecules, crystals, cells, tissues, organs,and organisms. If dualism is defined in such a way that the orbitals ofelectrons in atoms involve a duality of waves and particles, or of form andenergy, then so do the more-complex forms of higher-level morphic units; but ifthe former are not considered to be dualistic, then neither are the latter.5[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos773616] In spite of their similarity, there is of course a difference in kind betweenthe hypothesis of formative causation and the conventional theory. The latterprovides no fundamental understanding of the causation of forms, unlessequations or “mathematical structures” describing them are assumed to play acausal role; if so, a very mysterious dualism between mathematics and reality isimplied. The hypothesis of formative causation overcomes this problem byregarding the forms of previous systems as the causes of subsequent similarforms. From the conventional point of view, this cure may seem worse than thedisease insofar as it requires an action across time and space unlike any knowntype of physical action. However, this is not a metaphysical proposition but aphysical one, and is capable of being tested experimentally. If this hypothesis is supported by experimental evidence, then not only might itallow the various matter fields of quantum field theory to be interpreted interms of morphogenetic fields, but it could also lead toward a new understandingof other physical fields. In the morphogenetic field of an atom, a naked atomic nucleus surrounded byvirtual orbitals serves as a morphogenetic “attractor” for electrons. Perhapsthe so-called electrical attraction between the nucleus and the electrons couldbe regarded as an aspect of this atomic morphogenetic field. When the final formof the atom has been actualized by the capture of electrons, it no longer actsas a morphogenetic “attractor,” and in electrical terminology it is neutral. Soit is not inconceivable that electromagnetic fields could be derived from themorphogenetic fields of atoms. In a comparable manner, it might eventually be possible to interpret the strongand weak nuclear forces in terms of the morphogenetic fields of atomic nucleiand nuclear particles. Morphogenetic fields are part of the larger category ofmorphic fields, which also includes behavioral and social fields (chapter 9).Much of this summary of the hypothesis of formative causation applies to morphicfields in general, and not just to morphogenetic fields. 6.7 A summary of the hypothesis of formative causation (1) In addition to the types of energetic causation known to physics, and inaddition to the causation due to the structures of known physical fields, afurther type of causation is responsible for the forms of all material morphicunits (subatomic particles, atoms, molecules, crystals, quasi-crystallineaggregates, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, organisms). Form, in the senseused here, includes not only the shape of the outer surface of the morphic unitbut also its internal structure. This causation, called formative causation,imposes spatial order on changes brought about by energetic causation. It is notitself energetic, nor is it reducible to the causation brought about by knownphysical fields (sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.5). (2) Formative causation depends on morphic fields, structures with morphogeneticeffects on material systems. Each kind of morphic unit has its owncharacteristic morphic field. In the morphogenesis of a particular morphic unit,one or more of its characteristic parts—referred to as the morphogeneticgerm—becomes surrounded by, or embedded within, the morphogenetic field of theentire morphic unit. This field contains the morphic unit’s virtual form, whichis actualized as appropriate component parts come within its range of influenceand fit into their appropriate relative positions. The fitting into position ofthe parts of a morphic unit is accompanied by a release of energy, usually asheat, and is thermodynamically spontaneous; from an energetic point of view, thestructures of morphic units appear as minima or “wells” of potential energy(sections 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5). (3) Most inorganic morphogenesis is rapid, but biological morphogenesis isrelatively slow and passes through a succession of intermediate stages. A giventype of morphogenesis usually follows a particular developmental pathway; such acanalized pathway of change is called a chreode. Nevertheless, morphogenesis mayalso proceed toward the final form from different morphogenetic germs and bydifferent pathways, as in the phenomena of regulation and regeneration. In thecycles of cell growth and cell division and in the development of thedifferentiated structures of multicellular organisms, a succession ofmorphogenetic processes take place under the influence of a succession ofmorphogenetic fields (sections 2.4, 4.1, 5.4, 6.1). (4) The characteristic form of a given morphic unit is determined by the formsof previous similar systems that act upon it across time and space by a processcalled morphic resonance. This influence takes place through the morphic fieldand depends on the systems’ three-dimensional structures and patterns ofvibration. Morphic resonance is analogous to energetic resonance in itsspecificity, but it is not explicable in terms of any known type of resonance,nor does it involve a transmission of energy (sections 5.1, 5.3). (5) All similar past systems act upon a subsequent similar system by morphicresonance. This action is provisionally assumed not to be attenuated by space ortime, and to continue indefinitely; however, the relative effect of a givensystem declines as the number of similar systems contributing to morphicresonance increases (sections 5.4, 5.5). (6) The hypothesis of formative causation accounts for the repetition of formsbut does not explain how the first example of any given form originally cameinto being. This unique event can be ascribed to chance, or to creativityinherent in nature, or to a transcendent creative agency. A decision betweenthese alternatives can be made only on metaphysical grounds and lies outside thescope of the hypothesis (section 5.1). (7) Morphic resonance from the intermediate stages of previous similar processesof morphogenesis tends to canalize subsequent similar morphogenetic processesinto the same chreodes (section 5.4). (8) Morphic resonance from past systems with a characteristic polarity can occureffectively only after the morphogenetic germ of a subsequent system has beensuitably polarized. Systems that are asymmetrical in all three dimensions andexist in right- or left-handed forms influence subsequent similar systems bymorphic resonance irrespective of handedness (section 6.2). (9) Morphic fields are adjustable in absolute size and can be “scaled up” or“scaled down” within limits. Thus previous systems influence subsequent systemsof similar form by morphic resonance even though their absolute sizes may differ(section 6.3). (10) Even after adjustment for size, the many previous systems influencing asubsequent system by morphic resonance are not identical, but only similar inform. Therefore, their forms are not precisely superimposed within the morphicfield. The most frequent type of previous form makes the greatest contributionby morphic resonance, the least frequent the least: morphic fields are notprecisely defined but are probability structures that depend on the statisticaldistribution of previous similar forms. The probability distributions ofelectronic orbitals described by solutions of the Schrödinger equation areexamples of such probability structures, and are similar in kind to theprobability structures of the morphic fields of morphic units at higher levels(sections 4.3, 5.4). (11) The morphic fields of morphic units influence morphogenesis by acting uponthe morphic fields of their constituent parts. Thus the fields of tissuesinfluence those of cells; those of cells, organelles; those of crystals,molecules; those of molecules, atoms; and so on. These actions depend on theinfluence of higher-level probability structures on lower-level probabilitystructures and are thus inherently probabilistic (sections 4.3, 4.4). (12) Once the final form of a morphic unit is actualized, the continued actionof morphic resonance from similar past forms stabilizes and maintains it. If theform persists, the morphic resonance acting upon it will include a contributionfrom its own past states. Insofar as the system resembles its own past statesmore closely than those of other systems, this self-resonance will be highlyspecific, and may be of considerable importance in maintaining the system’sidentity (sections 6.4, 6.5). (13) The hypothesis of formative causation is capable of being testedexperimentally (section 5.6). "},{"pageContent":"7 image [images/00003.jpg] THE INHERITANCE OF FORM 7.1 Genetics and heredity Hereditary differences between otherwise similar organisms depend on geneticdifferences; genetic differences depend on differences in the structure of DNA,or in its arrangement within the chromosomes; and these differences lead tochanges in the structure of proteins, or to changes in the control of proteinsynthesis. In the twentieth century, these fundamental discoveries, supported by a largebody of detailed evidence, provided a satisfyingly straightforward understandingof the inheritance of proteins and of characteristics that depend more or lessdirectly on particular proteins, for example sickle-cell anemia and hereditarydefects of metabolism. By contrast, hereditary differences of form generallybear no immediate and obvious relationship to changes in the structure orsynthesis of particular proteins. Nevertheless, such changes can affectmorphogenesis in various ways through effects on metabolic enzymes,hormone-synthesizing enzymes, structural proteins, proteins in cell membranes,and so on. Many examples of these effects are already known. But granted thatvarious chemical changes lead to alterations or distortions of the normalpattern of morphogenesis, what determines the normal pattern of morphogenesisitself? According to the mechanistic theory, cells, tissues, organs, and organisms takeup their appropriate forms as a result of the synthesis of the right chemicalsin the right places at the right times. Morphogenesis is supposed to proceedspontaneously as a result of complex physicochemical interactions, but in a waythat is not yet fully understood because of its complexity. The mechanistictheory leaves open the question of how self-assembly actually works (section2.2). The hypothesis of formative causation suggests a new way of answering thisquestion. Insofar as it offers an interpretation of biological morphogenesisthat stresses the analogy with physical processes such as crystallization, aswell as ascribing an important role to energetically indeterminate fluctuations,it fulfills rather than denies the expectations of the mechanistic theory. Butwhereas the mechanistic theory attributes practically all the phenomena ofheredity to the genetic inheritance embodied in the DNA, the hypothesis offormative causation enables organisms in addition to inherit the morphic fieldsof past organisms of the same species. This type of inheritance takes place bymorphic resonance and not through the genes. So heredity includes both thegenetic inheritance of proteins and morphic resonance from similar past forms. Consider the following analogy. The music that comes out of the loudspeaker of aradio set depends both on the material structures of the set and the energy thatpowers it and on the transmission to which the set is tuned. The music can ofcourse be affected by changes in the wiring, transistors, condensers, etc., andit ceases when the battery is removed. Someone who knew nothing about thetransmission of invisible, intangible, and inaudible vibrations through theelectromagnetic field might conclude that it could be explained entirely interms of the components of the radio, the way in which they were arranged, andthe energy on which their functioning depended. If he ever considered thepossibility that anything entered from outside, he would dismiss it when hediscovered that the set weighed the same switched on and switched off. He wouldtherefore have to suppose that the rhythmic and harmonic patterns of the musicarose within the set as a result of immensely complicated interactions among itsparts. After careful study and analysis of the set, he might even be able tomake a replica of it that produced exactly the same sounds as the original, andwould probably regard this result as a striking proof of his theory. But inspite of his achievement, he would remain completely unaware that in reality themusic originated in a broadcasting studio hundreds of miles away. In terms of the hypothesis of formative causation, the “transmission” comes fromprevious similar systems and its “reception” depends on the detailed structureand organization of the receiving system. As in a radio set, two types of changein the organization of the receiver have significant effects. First, changes in the tuning of the system lead to the reception of quitedifferent morphic transmissions: just as a radio set can be tuned to differentradio stations, so a developing system can be tuned to different morphogeneticfields. Second, changes within a radio set tuned to a particular station can lead tomodifications and distortions of the music coming out of the loudspeaker.Likewise, genetic changes within a system developing under the influence of amorphogenetic field can lead to modifications and distortions of the organism’sform. Thus in developing organisms, both environmental and genetic factors can affectmorphogenesis in two different ways: either by changing the tuning ofmorphogenetic germs or by influencing the habitual pathways of morphogenesis insuch a way that variants of the normal forms are produced. 7.2 Altered morphogenetic germs The morphogenetic germs for the development of organs and tissues consist ofcells or groups of cells with characteristic structures and patterns ofoscillation, including electrical oscillations in their membranes (sections 4.5,6.1). Modern scanning techniques like electron spin resonance (ESR) and magneticresonance imaging (MRI) depend on resonance effects with molecules and withatomic nuclei within the body. In all levels of organization, from atoms,molecules, organelles, membranes, and organs like hearts and brains, there arerhythmic, vibratory patterns of activity, including electromagnetic activity. If as a result of unusual environmental conditions or genetic alterations thestructure and oscillatory pattern of a germ is changed sufficiently, it will nolonger become associated with its usual morphogenetic field. Either it will failto act as a germ at all, in which case an entire structure will fail to appearwithin the organism; or it will become associated with a different morphogeneticfield, in which case a structure not normally found in this part of the organismwill develop instead of the usual one. Mutations that lead to changes of this kind are called homeotic mutations. Manyexamples of the loss of an entire structure or of the replacement of onestructure by another have been described.1[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos775003] Sometimes the same homeoticchanges can also be brought about by changes in the environment of thedeveloping organism, as discussed below. Effects of these types have been studied in great detail in the fruit flyDrosophila. Several homeotic mutations lead to transformations of entire regionsof the fly; for example, changes to the antennapedia gene change antennae intolegs, and mutations within the bithorax gene complex cause the metathoracicsegment, which normally bears two halteres, to develop as if it were amesothoracic segment (see figure 17). The resulting flies bear two pairs ofwings on adjacent segments.2 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos775316] Homeotic mutations also occur in plants. In the pea, for example, the leavesnormally bear leaflets toward their base and tendrils at their tip. In someleaves, there are tendrils opposite leaflets, indicating that similar primordiaare capable of giving rise to both types of structure (figure 18); presumablycells within these primordia are influenced by factors within the embryonicleaf, causing them to take up the structure and oscillatory patterncharacteristic of the morphogenetic germ either of a tendril or of a leaflet. Inone type of homeotic mutant, the formation of tendrils is suppressed and all theprimordia give rise to leaflets; in another mutant (due to a gene on a differentchromosome) the formation of leaflets is suppressed and all the primordia giverise to tendrils3 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos775593] (figure 18). image [images/00021.jpg]Figure 17. A normal specimen of the fruit fly Drosophila (A) and a mutant fly(B) in which the third thoracic segment has been transformed in such a way thatit resembles the second thoracic segment. The fly consequently has two pairs ofwings instead of one. Homeotic genes code for transcription factors, which are proteins that bind tospecific parts of DNA affecting the activity of other genes. The pattern of geneactivity they control affects a whole pathway of morphogenesis. In terms of thehypothesis of formative causation, these patterns of gene activity work byinfluencing morphogenetic germs, affecting their tuning to particularmorphogenetic fields. There are many conceivable ways in which they might dothis, for example by coding for proteins that modify the properties of cellmembranes, affecting the structures or patterns of activity in the cells of themorphogenetic germ in such a way that they no longer resonate with the usualmorphogenetic field but tune in to a different one. This is analogous tochanging the tuning circuit of a television set: a “mutation” in a transistor orcondenser in this circuit could cause the TV set to be tuned to a differentchannel, or to lose the ability to tune in to any channel at all. Significantly,in evolutionary developmental biology, these homeotic genes are often referredto as “field-specific selector genes.”4[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos775835] image [images/00022.jpg]Figure 18. A: Normal pea leaves, bearing both leaflets and tendrils. B: Leaf ofa mutant plant in which only leaflets are formed. C: Leaf of a mutant plant inwhich only tendrils are formed. 7.3 Altered pathways of morphogenesis Whereas the factors affecting morphogenetic germs have qualitative effects onmorphogenesis resulting in the absence of a structure or the substitution of onestructure for another, many environmental and genetic factors bring aboutquantitative modifications of the final forms of structures through theireffects on the processes of morphogenesis. For example, in plants of a givencultivated variety grown under a range of environmental conditions, the overallshape of the shoot and root systems, the morphology of the leaves, and even theanatomy of various organs differ in detail; but nevertheless the characteristicvarietal form remains recognizable. Or when different varieties of the samespecies are grown in the same environment, the plants differ from each other inmany details, although they are all recognizably variants of a characteristicspecific form. Genetic and environmental factors influence development through variousquantitative effects on structural components, enzymic activity, hormones, etc.(section 7.1). Some of these influences are relatively unspecific and affectseveral different pathways of morphogenesis. Others may perturb the normalcourse of development but have little effect on the final form, owing toregulation. While certain striking genetic effects may be traceable to particular genes,most depend on the combined influence of numerous genes, the individual effectsof which are small and difficult to identify and analyze. According to the hypothesis of formative causation, organisms of the samevariety or breed resemble each other not only because they are geneticallysimilar and therefore subject to similar genetic influences duringmorphogenesis, but also because their characteristic chreodes are reinforced andstabilized by morphic resonance from past organisms of the same kind. The morphogenetic fields of a species are not fixed, but change as the speciesevolves. The greatest statistical contribution to the probability structures ofthe morphogenetic fields is from the most common morphological types, which arealso those that develop under the most usual environmental conditions. In thesimplest cases, the automatic averaging effect of morphic resonance willstabilize the morphogenetic fields around a single most probable form, or “wildtype.” If the species inhabits two or more geographically or ecologicallydistinct environments in which characteristic growth habits have evolved, themorphogenetic fields of the species will not contain a single most probableform, but a “multi-modal” distribution of forms, depending on the number ofmorphologically distinct varieties or races and the relative sizes of their pastpopulations. 7.4 Dominance At first sight, the idea that varietal forms are stabilized by morphic resonancefrom past organisms of the same variety may appear to add little to theconventional explanation in terms of genetic similarity alone. However, itsimportance becomes apparent in considering hybrid organisms that are subject tomorphic resonance from two distinct parental types. To return to the radio analogy: Under normal circumstances a set is tuned toonly one station at a time, just as an organism is normally “tuned” to similarpast organisms of the same variety. But if the radio is tuned in to twodifferent stations simultaneously, the sounds it produces depend on the relativestrength of their signals: if one is very strong and the other very weak, thelatter has little noticeable effect; but if both are of similar strength, theset produces a mixture of sounds from both sources. Likewise, in a hybridproduced by crossing two varieties, the presence of genes and gene productscharacteristic of both will tend to bring the developing organism into morphicresonance with past organisms of both parental types. The overall probabilitystructures within the morphogenetic fields of the hybrid will depend on therelative strength of the morphic resonance from the two parental types. If bothparents come from varieties represented by comparable numbers of pastindividuals, both will tend to influence morphogenesis to similar extents,giving a combination or “resultant” of the two parental forms (figure 19A). Butif fewer individuals have represented one variety than the other, their smallercontribution to the overall probability structure will mean that the form of theother parental variety will tend to predominate (figure 19B). And if one of theparents comes from a mutant line of recent origin, morphic resonance from thesmall number of past individuals of this type will make an insignificantcontribution to the probability structure of the hybrids (figure 19C). These expectations are in harmony with the facts. First, hybrids betweenwell-established varieties or species usually combine features of both, or areof intermediate form. Second, in hybrids between a relatively recent variety anda long-established variety, the characters of the latter are usually more orless dominant. And third, recent mutations affecting morphological charactersare nearly always recessive. Significantly, mechanistic theories of dominance are both vague and speculative,except in the case of characteristics that depend more or less directly onparticular proteins. If a mutant gene leads to a loss of function, for exampleby giving rise to a defective enzyme, it will be recessive, because in hybridsthe presence of a normal gene enables the normal enzyme to be produced, andhence the normal biochemical reactions occur. However, in some cases thedefective gene product might be positively harmful, for example by interferingwith the permeability of membranes, in which case the mutation would tend to beboth dominant and lethal. image [images/00023.jpg]Figure 19. Diagrammatic representation of the probability structures of themorphogenetic fields of parents and hybrids. These explanations for dominance in terms of molecular biology are satisfactoryas far as they go; but in the absence of any mechanistic understanding ofmorphogenesis, the attempt to account for dominance in the inheritance of formby extrapolation from the molecular level inevitably begs the question. The conventional genetic theories of dominance are more sophisticated than thepurely biochemical theory; they emphasize that dominance is not fixed, butrather evolves.5 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos776126] In order toaccount for the relative uniformity of wild populations, in which most nonlethalmutations are recessive, they assume that the dominance of the “wild type” hasbeen favored by natural selection. One theory postulates the selection of genesthat modify the dominance of other genes,6[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos776344] and another theory theselection of increasingly effective versions of the genes that control thedominant characters in question.7[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos776558] But apart from the fact thatthere is little evidence in favor of either, and some against both, thesetheories suffer from the defect that they presuppose rather than explaindominance: they provide only hypothetical mechanisms by which it could bemaintained or increased.8 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos776809] According to the hypothesis of formative causation, dominance would evolve for afundamentally different reason. Types favored by natural selection would berepresented by larger numbers of individuals than types of lower survival value;as time went on, the former would become increasingly dominant through thecumulative effect of morphic resonance. This hypothesis could in principle be distinguished experimentally from allconventional theories of dominance. According to the latter, under a given setof environmental conditions, dominance depends only on the genetic constitutionof a hybrid, whereas according to the former, it depends both on the geneticconstitution and on morphic resonance from the parental types. Therefore, if therelative strength of the resonance from the parental types changed, thedominance of one over the other would change even if the genetic constitution ofthe hybrid remained the same. Consider the following experiment. Hybrid seeds are obtained from a crossbetween plants of a well-defined variety (P1) and a mutant line (P2). Some ofthese hybrid seeds are placed in cold storage, while others are grown undercontrolled conditions. The characteristics of the hybrid plants are carefullyobserved, and the plants themselves are preserved. In these plants the P1morphology is completely dominant (figure 19C). Then very large numbers ofplants of the mutant type (P2) are grown in the field. Subsequently, some of thehybrids are again grown under the same conditions as they were before, from thesame batch of seeds. Because P2 now makes a greater contribution by morphicresonance, P1 may be only partially dominant (figure 19B). After growing manymore P2 plants, the form of the hybrids may be intermediate between the twoparental types (figure 19A). Then still more plants of the P2 type are grown inlarge numbers; subsequently the hybrids are again grown under the sameconditions as the previous hybrids from the same batch of seeds. Now the P2 typewill make a greater contribution by morphic resonance than P1, and the P2morphology will be dominant. This result would strongly support the morphic resonance hypothesis ofdominance, and would be completely incomprehensible from the point of view oforthodox genetic theory. The only problem with this experiment is that it mightbe difficult to perform in practice, since if P1 is a well-established varietythat has existed for a very long time—in the case of a wild variety, perhaps formany thousands or even millions of years—it would not be practicable to growcomparable numbers of the P2 type. The experiment would be feasible only if P1were a recent variety of which only a relatively small number of individuals hadbeen grown in the past. 7.5 Family resemblances Within a given variety, organisms differ from each other in all sorts of minorways. In an interbreeding population, each individual is more or less uniquegenetically, and thus tends to follow its own characteristic path of developmentunder the various quantitative influences of its genes. Moreover, sincemorphogenesis depends on the effect of probability structures on probabilisticevents, the whole process is somewhat indeterminate. And then local environmentsvary. As a result of all these factors, each individual has a characteristicform and makes its own unique contribution to subsequent morphogenetic fields. The most specific morphic resonance acting on a particular organism, apart fromself-resonance from its own past, is likely to be that from previous closelyrelated individuals with a similar genetic constitution, accounting for familyresemblances. This specific morphic resonance will be superimposed on the lessspecific resonance from numerous past individuals of the same variety, and thisin turn will be superimposed on a general background of morphic resonance fromall past members of the species. In the valley model of a chreode (figure 5), the most specific morphic resonancewould determine the detailed course of morphogenesis, corresponding to the bedof a stream, and the less specific morphic resonance from previous individualsof the same variety the bed of a small valley. The variant chreodes of differentvarieties within the same species would correspond to small divergent orparallel valleys within a larger valley representing the chreode of the speciesas a whole. 7.6 Environmental influences and morphic resonance The forms of organisms are influenced to varying degrees by the environmentalconditions under which they develop. According to the hypothesis of formativecausation, they are also influenced by the environmental conditions under whichprevious similar organisms developed, because the forms of these organismscontribute to their morphogenetic fields by morphic resonance. In terms of theradio analogy, the music coming out of the loudspeaker is affected not only bychanges within the receiver, but also by changes within the broadcasting studio:if an orchestra starts playing a different piece of music, the radio setproduces different sounds even though its tuning and internal structures remainthe same. Consider, for example, a new variety of a cultivated species. If very largenumbers of plants of this variety are grown in one environment and very few inothers, the former will make a much larger contribution to the probabilitystructures of the varietal morphogenetic fields; their form will be the mostprobable form of the variety and will therefore tend to influence themorphogenesis of all subsequent plants of the same variety, even when they aregrown in different environments. In order to test this prediction, it would be best to use a new variety of aself-pollinated crop; the plants would be very similar to each othergenetically, and there would be no danger of their outcrossing with othervarieties. To start with, a few plants would be grown in two very differentenvironments, X and Y, and their morphological characters carefully recorded.Some of the original batch of seeds would be placed in cold storage. Then verylarge numbers of plants would be grown in environment Y (either in one season orover several generations). Subsequently, using some of the original seeds thathad been kept in cold storage, a few plants would once again be grown inenvironment X. Their morphogenesis should now be influenced by morphic resonancefrom the large numbers of genetically similar plants grown in environment Y.Consequently, they should show more resemblance to the Y-type morphology thandid the original X-type plants. Of course, for a valid comparison of plantsgrown on different occasions, it would be necessary to ensure that theconditions were practically identical; this would be impossible in the field,but could be achieved relatively easily with an artificially controlledenvironment in a phytotron. If this result were actually obtained, it would provide positive evidence forthe hypothesis of formative causation, and would be inexplicable in terms of theconventional theories. 7.7 The inheritance of acquired characteristics The influence of previous organisms on subsequent similar organisms by morphicresonance would give rise to effects that could not conceivably occur ifheredity depended on only the transfer of genes and other material structuresfrom parents to their progeny. This possibility enables the question of the“inheritance of acquired characteristics” to be seen in a new light. In the fierce controversy at the end of the nineteenth and in the earlier partof the twentieth century, both the Lamarckians on the one hand and the followersof Weismann and of Mendel on the other assumed that heredity depended on onlythe germ plasm in general or the genes in particular. Therefore, ifcharacteristics acquired by organisms in response to the environment were to beinherited, the germ plasm or the genes would have to undergo specificmodifications. The anti-Lamarckians emphasized that such modifications seemedextremely unlikely, if not impossible. Even the Lamarckians themselves wereunable to suggest any plausible mechanisms by which these changes could bebrought about. On the other hand, the Lamarckian theory seemed to provide a plausibleexplanation for hereditary adaptations in animals and plants. For example,camels have callosities on their knees. It is easy to understand how these areacquired in response to abrasion of the skin as the camels kneel down. But babycamels are born with them. Facts of this type would make good sense if acquiredcharacteristics somehow became hereditary. However, the neo-Darwinians deny this possibility, and offer an alternativeinterpretation in terms of random mutations: If organisms with the acquiredcharacteristics in question are favored by natural selection, random mutationsthat happen to produce the same characteristics without the need to acquire themwill also be favored by natural selection, and thus the characteristics willbecome hereditary. This hypothetical simulation of the inheritance of acquiredcharacteristics is sometimes called the Baldwin effect, after one of theevolutionary theorists who first suggested it.9[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos777008] In the early part of the twentieth century, dozens of scientists claimed to havedemonstrated an inheritance of acquired characteristics in various species ofanimals and plants.10 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos777207] Theanti-Lamarckians replied with counterexamples, citing the well-known experimentof Weismann in which he chopped the tails off mice for twenty-two successivegenerations and found that their progeny still developed tails. Another argumentdrew attention to the fact that after many generations of circumcision, Jewishmen are still born with foreskins. After the suicide of one of the leading Lamarckians, Paul Kammerer, in 1926,Mendelism became established in the West as the almost unchallenged orthodoxy.11[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos777573] Meanwhile, in the Soviet Unionbelievers in the inheritance of acquired characteristics, led by Trofim Lysenko,gained control of the biological establishment in the 1930s and remaineddominant until 1964. During this period, many of their Mendelian opponents werecruelly persecuted.12 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos777773] Thispolarization resulted in bitterness and dogmatism on both sides. 7.8 Epigenetic inheritance There is now good evidence that acquired characteristics can indeed beinherited. Despite the taboo against Lamarckian inheritance in the West, moreand more examples of the inheritance of acquired characteristics continued toaccumulate. For example, in the 1960s the British botanist Alan Durrantdiscovered that when flax plants were grown with different kinds of fertilizer,not only did the plants grow differently, but these differences were inheritedby their offspring, even when they were all grown under the same conditions.Some lines were larger than normal, others were smaller, and there were alsoinherited differences in the hairiness of the seeds. These differences persistedover many generations.13 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos777999] Such cases, although well documented, were generally ignored. However, the taboobegan to lift at the turn of the millennium with the widespread recognition ofepigenetics. In a groundbreaking study with mice, Randy Jirtle and RobertWaterford, at Duke University, found that mice of the agouti strain, which arefat, yellow, and disease-prone, could be transformed by changing the diets ofmothers, starting just before conception. After the mothers had been given afood supplement derived from soybeans, many of their offspring were slender,brown, and long-lived. Yet there had been no change in their DNA sequence;instead, the expression of the agouti gene had been modified epigenetically. Itis now known that such changes can be passed on to subsequent generations.14[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos778236] Epigenetic changes are notalways erased when sperm and egg cells are formed, as biologists assumed fordecades. Likewise through epigenetic inheritance, the effects of toxins can echo forgenerations. In a study at Washington State University, Michael Skinner and hiscolleagues found that when pregnant rats were exposed to a commonly usedagricultural fungicide, the development of their sons’ testes was impaired, andthey had a low sperm count later in life. Their sons also had lower spermcounts, and this effect was passed on from fathers to sons for fourgenerations.15 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos778550] Epigenetic effects also occur in invertebrates, like Daphnia, the water flea.When predators are around, the water fleas develop large defensive spines. Whenthey reproduce, their offspring also have these spines even if they are notexposed to predators.16 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos778967] There are now many examples of epigenetic inheritance in humans. For example,women who were pregnant when a famine hit the Netherlands at the end of theSecond World War gave birth to malnourished, underweight babies. When thesebabies grew up, they too had babies with unusually low birth weights. A study inSweden of men born between 1890 and 1920 showed that their nutrition inchildhood affected the incidence of diabetes and heart disease in theirgrandchildren. And many common diseases that are inherited within families mayalso be passed on epigenetically.17[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos779203] The Human Epigenome Project waslaunched in 2003, and is helping to coordinate research in this rapidly growingfield of inquiry.18 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos779410] The prefix epi means “over and above.” Epigenetic inheritance does not involvechanges in the genes themselves, but rather changes in gene expression. Forexample, changes in the configuration of the chromatin—the DNA-protein complexthat makes up the structure of chromosomes—can be passed on from cell todaughter cell. When these changes are transmitted through eggs or sperm, theyare inherited. In other words, gene activity can be modified heritably withoutmutation. Another kind of epigenetic change, sometimes called genomicimprinting, involves the methylation of DNA molecules. There is a heritablechemical change in the DNA itself, but the underlying genes remain the same. Athird kind of epigenetic inheritance depends on alterations in the cytoplasm,inherited through egg cells and hence only from mothers. In the light ofepigenetics, evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics that waspreviously rejected or ignored has been rehabilitated.19[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos779619] The hypothesis of formative causation allows for an inheritance of acquiredcharacteristics through morphic resonance, without the need for genetic changesor even for epigenetic inheritance. It complements rather than contradicts boththese kinds of inheritance, and can be distinguished from them by experiment, asdiscussed below. In general, when pathways of morphogenesis are altered by either environmentalor genetic factors, similar processes of morphogenesis in subsequent similarorganisms will tend to be canalized and stabilized by morphic resonance. Thestrength of this influence will depend on the specificity of the resonance andon the number of previous similar organisms whose morphogenesis has beenaltered; this number will tend to be large if the alterations are favored bynatural or artificial selection, and small if they are not. Mutilations of fully formed structures do not alter their pathways ofmorphogenesis unless they regenerate. Hence mutilations of non-regeneratingstructures would not be expected to influence the development of subsequentorganisms by morphic resonance. This conclusion is in agreement with thefindings that the amputation of the tails of mice and the circumcision of Jewshave no significant hereditary effects. 7.9 Experiments with phenocopies C. H. Waddington first introduced the term “epigenetic” into biology in the1940s. In his laboratory at Edinburgh University in the 1950s he initiated whatis still one of the most interesting and important lines of investigation intothe inheritance of acquired characteristics, using phenocopies of fruit flies.Phenocopies are organisms whose characteristics resemble those produced as aresult of genetic mutations, but which arise in response to a change in theenvironment instead. For example, the four-winged fruit fly shown in figure 17Bhas a mutation in the “bithorax” gene complex. Exposing the eggs of normaltwo-winged fruit flies to fumes of ether three hours after they are laid canproduce similar four-winged flies, also known as bithorax flies. This effectoccurred not because ether induced specific mutations in the DNA, but because itdisturbed the normal pathway of development, much as exposing human embryos tothalidomide resulted in abnormal limbs. Waddington found that by exposing fruit fly eggs to ether generation aftergeneration, the proportion of bithorax flies increased: the phenocopies becamemore frequent. After twenty-nine generations, some of the offspring of theseflies showed the bithorax character without any exposure to ether at all.Waddington called this phenomenon “genetic assimilation.” A characteristic thatwas acquired in response to a changed environment had become hereditary.20[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos779843] In Waddington’s words: “Allthese experiments demonstrate that if selection takes place for the occurrenceof a character acquired in a particular abnormal environment, the resultingselected strains are liable to exhibit that character even when transferred backto the normal environment.”21 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos780089] As well as this orthodox-sounding interpretation in terms of natural selection,Waddington considered the possibility that some physical or chemical influencefrom the altered structures in the abnormal flies could have induced heritablemodifications in their genes,22 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos780221]but he rejected it because the then prevalent doctrines of molecular biologyprovided no plausible mechanism by which such modifications could occur.23[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos780430] His final interpretationemphasized both the role of selection for the genetic potential to respond tothe environmental stress by developing abnormally and the “canalization ofdevelopment” involved in the modified morphogenesis. “To use somewhatpicturesque language, one might say that the selection did not merely lower athreshold, but determined in what direction the developing system would proceedonce it got over the threshold.”24[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos780682] Waddington himself coined theword chreode to express the notion of directed, canalized development (figure5). He thought of the determination of the direction taken by a chreode in termsof its “tuning.” But he did not explain how this canalization and “tuning” cameabout, apart from making the vague suggestion that they somehow depended on theselection of genes.25 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos780914] The hypothesis of formative causation complements Waddington’s interpretation:The chreodes and the final forms toward which they are directed depend onmorphic resonance from previous similar organisms; the inheritance of acquiredcharacteristics of the kind studied by Waddington depends both on geneticselection and on a direct influence by morphic resonance from the organismswhose development was modified in response to abnormal environments. Epigeneticinheritance may also play a part. Mae-wan Ho and her colleagues at the Open University in Britain repeatedWaddington’s experiments in the 1980s,26[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos781056] but unlike Waddington they usedan inbred strain of fruit flies with very little genetic variability, so therewas very limited scope for genetic selection effects. They did not selectbithorax flies as the parents of the next generation either; the great majorityof the parents were normal-looking. Nevertheless, in the absence of geneticselection effects, they found that treating eggs with ether generation aftergeneration led to an increase in the proportion of bithorax flies. After tengenerations, some of the flies that grew from untreated eggs were bithorax, andso were their descendants, again without ether treatment. The more often thatflies developed abnormally, the more probable the bithorax phenocopies became. Experiments at Stanford University in the 1990s also showed that that theproportion of bithorax phenocopies increased progressively in successivegenerations treated with ether.27[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos781424] The most remarkable finding inHo’s laboratory was that when the experimental flies had been treated with etherfor six generations, new batches of flies whose parents had never been exposedto ether reacted more strongly to the same ether treatment: in the firstgeneration, 10 percent of the progeny were bithorax and in the second 20percent, compared with 2 percent and 6 percent in the first and secondgeneration of the original experimental line. In other words, phenocopies becamemore probable after similar flies had already developed the bithorax phenocopy,even in flies whose ancestors had never been exposed to ether. This result wouldbe expected on the basis of morphic resonance, but not on any other hypothesis. In setting up new experiments to test for morphic resonance with fruit flies,two lines could be compared. In one of them, E, the flies would be descendedfrom stressed parents and the eggs would be treated with ether in everygeneration; in the other, F, the eggs treated with ether would come fromunstressed parents, all of whose ancestors were also unstressed (see figure 20).If morphic resonance is at work, the frequency of phenocopies should increase inboth lines, but this effect would be stronger in line E because of thecombination of morphic resonance with epigenetic inheritance. In the 1930s, Richard Goldschmidt, one of the most brilliant geneticists of hisgeneration, found that in fruit flies, “it is possible to produce practicallyevery known type of mutant as phenocopy by the action of different degrees ofheat shock during the sensitive periods of the pupa.”28[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos781745] Waddington followed upGoldschmidt’s observations by studying the effects of heat shocks on fruit flypupae, looking at the development of veins in the wings. He found that exposingtwenty-two-hour-old pupae to a temperature of 40°C caused some of them todevelop into “crossveinless” phenocopies. In successive generations theproportion increased. After fifteen generations, more than 90 percent of theflies had crossveinless wings. Starting at generation fourteen, some of theuntreated pupae developed crossveinless wings too.29[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos781977] image [images/00024.jpg]Figure 20. Diagrammatic representation of an experiment with an inbred strain offruit flies comparing the effect of ether treatment of the eggs (dotted lines)in successive generations of flies descended from ether-treated parents (above)with control lines (below). If the proportion of phenocopies were to increase insuccessive generations of the control line, this would indicate a morphicresonance effect. An increase in the test line, with flies descended fromether-treated parents, could be due to a combination of morphic resonance andepigenetic inheritance. Phenocopies occur in many other animals, including butterflies. Wing patterns inbutterflies are particularly susceptible to heat or cold shocks. For example,when the pupae of the central European Vanessa urticae were exposed to lowtemperatures, some produced adults with wing patterns indistinguishable fromVanessa polaris, found in Lapland.30[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos782210] Also, a wide range of plants,including algae and liverworts, form phenocopies in response to physical orchemical changes in their environment.31[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos782438] Phenocopies are of great interest in their own right, and provide manyopportunities for research on the role of morphic resonance in morphogenesis. "},{"pageContent":"8 image [images/00003.jpg] THE EVOLUTION OF BIOLOGICAL FORMS 8.1 The neo-Darwinian theory of evolution Very little is actually known or ever can be known about the details ofevolution in the past. Nor is evolution readily observable in the present. Evenon a timescale measured in millions of years, the origin of new species is rare,and of genera, families, and orders rarer still. The evolutionary changes thathave actually been observed involve mainly the development of new varieties orraces within established species. The best-known examples are of the emergenceof dark-colored races of several European moths in areas where industrialpollution led to the blackening of the surfaces on which they settled. Darkmutants were said to be favored by natural selection because they were bettercamouflaged and hence less subject to predation by birds. But even the textbookexample of the peppered moth turns out to be questionable; the often citedevidence includes deceptive photographs and flawed experiments.1[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos782829] With such scanty direct evidence, and with so little possibility of experimentaltests, any interpretation of the mechanism of evolution is bound to bespeculative: unconstrained by detailed facts, it will largely consist of anelaboration of its initial assumptions about the nature of inheritance and thesources of heritable variation. The orthodox interpretation is provided by the neo-Darwinian theory, whichdiffers from the original Darwinian theory in two major respects: first, itdenies the inheritance of habits, which Darwin accepted; it asserts thatheredity is essentially genetic. Second, it assumes that the ultimate source ofheritable variability is random mutations of the genetic material. Most neo-Darwinian theorists assume that divergent evolution under the influenceof natural selection over long periods of time will lead to not only thedevelopment of new varieties and subspecies, but also new species, genera, andfamilies.2 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos783201] This view has beendisputed on the grounds that the differences between these higher taxonomicdivisions are too great to have arisen by gradual transformations; apart fromanything else, the organisms often differ in the number and structure of theirchromosomes. Several authors have suggested that these large-scale evolutionarychanges occur suddenly as a result of macro-mutations. Monstrous animals andplants in which structures have been transformed, reduplicated, or suppressedprovide contemporary examples of such sudden changes. Occasionally in the courseof evolution, “hopeful monsters” could have survived and reproduced.3[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos783790] One argument in favor of thisview is that whereas gradual changes under selection pressure should result informs with a definite adaptive value (except perhaps in small populationssubject to “genetic drift”), macro-mutations could produce all sorts ofapparently gratuitous large-scale variations that would be weeded out by naturalselection only if they were positively harmful, thus helping to account for theprodigious diversity of living organisms.4[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos784144] Although these neo-Darwinian theorists emphasize the importance of sudden largechanges, they do not disagree with the orthodox assumptions that evolution as awhole depends on only random mutations and genetic inheritance, in combinationwith natural selection. More-radical critics object to the implicit or explicitmechanistic assumption that evolution as a whole is entirely purposeless.5[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos784409] The metaphysical denial of any creative agency or purpose in the evolutionaryprocess follows from the philosophy of materialism, with which the neo-Darwiniantheory is so closely associated.6[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos784993] But unless scientific andmetaphysical issues are to become hopelessly confounded, within the context ofscience the neo-Darwinian theory must be treated not as a metaphysical dogma butas a scientific hypothesis. As such it can hardly be regarded as proven: at bestit offers a plausible interpretation of the processes of evolution on the basisof its assumptions about genetic inheritance and the randomness of mutations. The hypothesis of formative causation enables heredity to be seen in a newlight, and therefore leads to a different interpretation of evolution. 8.2 Mutations Changes are imposed upon organisms both from within, by genetic mutations, andfrom without, by alterations in the environment. Mutations are accidental changes in the structure of genes or of chromosomes,individually unpredictable not only in practice but also in principle, becausethey depend on probabilistic events. Many mutations have effects that are sodeleterious as to be lethal. Of those that are less harmful, some exertquantitative influences on pathways of morphogenesis, and give rise to variantsof normal forms (section 7.3); others affect morphogenetic germs in such a waythat whole pathways of morphogenesis are blocked or replaced by other pathways(section 7.2). In those rare cases where mutations lead to changes that are favored by naturalselection, not only will the proportion of mutant genes in the population tendto increase, in accordance with the neo-Darwinian theory, but also therepetition of the new pathways of morphogenesis in increasing numbers oforganisms will reinforce the new chreodes: not only the “gene pools,” but alsothe morphogenetic fields of a species will change and evolve as a result ofnatural selection. 8.3 The divergence of chreodes If a mutation or environmental change perturbs a normal pathway of morphogenesisat a relatively early stage, the system may be able to regulate and go on toproduce a normal final form in spite of this disturbance. If this process isrepeated generation after generation, the chreodic diversion will be stabilizedby morphic resonance; consequently a whole race or variety of a species willcome to follow an abnormal pathway of morphogenesis while still ending up withthe usual adult form. In fact many such cases have been described; they are called “temporarydeviations in development.” For example, in the turbellarian worm Prorhynchnusstagnitilis, the egg cells cleave either in a spiral or in a radial manner, andthe developing embryos grow either inside the yolk or on its surface. Owing tothese differences in early embryology, some of the organs are formed indifferent sequences; nevertheless, the adult animals are identical. And in asingle species of the annelid worm Nereis, two very different kinds of larva areproduced, but both develop into the same adult form.7[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos785206] In some such cases, thetemporary deviations may be adaptive, for example to conditions of larval life,but in most they occur for no apparent reason. Of much greater evolutionary significance are those divergences of chreodes thatare not fully corrected by regulation and that therefore give rise to differentfinal forms. Such changes in the pathway of development could arise as a resultof either mutations (section 7.3) or unusual environmental conditions (section7.6). In the case of mutation in an unchanged environment, if the deviant finalform has a selective advantage, the mutant genes will increase in frequencywithin the population, and also the new chreode will be increasingly reinforcedby morphic resonance. In more-complicated cases, where a variant form arises inresponse to unusual environmental conditions and has a selective advantage, thenew chreode will be reinforced as before, and at the same time selection willalso operate in favor of those organisms with the genetic capacity to respond inthis way (cf. Waddington’s experiments on fruit flies, section 7.8). Thus, theacquired characteristics will become hereditary through a combination of morphicresonance and genetic selection. Under natural conditions, the operation of different selection pressures ongeographically or ecologically isolated populations of a species will result ina divergence both of their “gene pools” and of their chreodes. Countless speciesof animals and plants have in fact diverged into genetically and morphologicallydistinct races and varieties; familiar examples are provided by domesticatedanimals and cultivated plants.8 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos785405]Think, for instance, of the amazingly diverse breeds of dog, ranging from theAfghan hound to the Pekinese, or the varieties of cabbage, Brassica oleracea,like kale, Savoy cabbage, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and cauliflower. In some cases, the morphological divergence affects only one particularstructure or a small group of structures while others remain relativelyunaffected. For example, in the small fish Belone acus, the jaws in the earlystages of development resemble those of related species, but subsequently theydevelop into an enormously elongated snout.9[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos785695] Many structural exaggerations have evolved under the influence of sexualselection, for example the antlers of deer. And flowers provide thousands ofexamples of the divergent development of different component parts: compare, forinstance, the modifications of the petals in different species of orchid. In other cases, the form of many different structures has changed in acorrelated manner. Indeed, if the forms vary in a particularly uniform andharmonious way, they can be compared diagrammatically using the systematicdistortion of superimposed coordinates (figure 21), as Sir D’Arcy Thompsonshowed in the chapter titled “The Theory of Transformations, or the Comparisonof Related Forms” from his essay On Growth and Form. These kinds of evolutionary change take place within the context of alreadyexisting morphogenetic fields. They produce variations on given themes, but theycannot account for these themes themselves. In Thompson’s words: image [images/00025.jpg]Figure 21. Comparisons of the forms of different species of fish. (FromThompson, 1942.

According to the hypothesis of formativecausation, these effects are caused by homeotic mutations or environmentalfactors that alter morphogenetic germs (section 7.2). Examples of mutant pealeaves in which leaflets are substituted for tendrils are shown in figure 18,and a bithorax mutant of Drosophila in figure 17. Changes of these types probably occurred frequently in the course of evolution.For example, in certain species of Acacia, the leaves have been suppressed andtheir role taken over by flattened leaf stalks. This process can actually beseen in seedlings, where the first-formed leaves are typically pinnate (seefigure 22). In members of the cactus family, spines have replaced leaves. Among the insects,in almost every order there are species in which the wings have been suppressedeither in both sexes, as in certain parasitic flies, or in only one sex, as inthe female beetle known as the glowworm. In the case of ants, female larvaedevelop into either winged queens or wingless workers depending on the chemicalconstitution of their diet. In some species, juvenile forms become sexually mature and reproduce withoutever producing the characteristic structures of the adult, which are, as itwere, short-circuited. The classic example is the axolotl, a tadpole of thetiger salamander, which reaches full size and becomes sexually mature withoutlosing its larval characteristics. If axolotls are supplied with thyroidhormone, they metamorphose into the air-breathing adult form and move out of thewater onto land. image [images/00026.jpg]Figure 22. A seedling of an Acacia species. (After Goebel, 1898) The most extreme examples of the suppression of chreodes are found amongparasites, some of which have lost nearly all the structures characteristic ofrelated free-living forms. 8.5 The repetition of chreodes In all multicellular organisms, some structures are repeated several or manytimes: the tentacles of Hydra, the arms of the starfish, the legs of centipedes,the feathers of birds, the leaves of trees, and so on. Then many organs are madeup of repeated structural units: the tubules of kidneys, the segments of fruits,etc. And, of course, tissues contain millions or billions of a few basic typesof cell. If, as a result of mutations or environmental changes, extra morphogenetic germsare formed within developing organisms, then certain structures can be repeatedmore than usual. A familiar horticultural example is that of “double” flowers,containing additional petals. Human babies are sometimes born with extra fingersor toes. And many instances of abnormally reduplicated structures can be foundin the standard texts on teratology, ranging from double-headed calves tomonstrous multiple pears (figure 23). As these additional structures develop, regulation occurs in such a way thatthey are integrated more or less completely with the rest of the organism: forexample, extra petals in double flowers have normal vascular connections, andextra fingers and toes have a proper blood supply and innervation. Reduplication of structural units must have played an essential role in theevolution of new types of animals and plants, as shown by the structuralrepetitions within existing organisms. Moreover, many of the structures ofanimals and plants now different from each other may well have evolved fromoriginally similar units. For example, insects are believed to have evolved fromcreatures resembling primitive centipedes, with a series of more or lessidentical segments, each bearing a pair of leglike appendages. The appendages onthe segments at the front end may have given rise to the mouthparts andantennae, while the segments fused together to form the head. At the tail endsome of the appendages may have been modified to produce structures concernedwith mating and manipulation of the eggs. In the abdominal segments theappendages were suppressed, but in the three thoracic segments they wereretained, and evolved into the modern insect legs.11[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos786604] image [images/00027.jpg]Figure 23. A monstrous pear. (After Masters, 1869) Such a divergence of originally similar chreodes would only have been possibleif the segmental morphogenetic germs became differentiated from one another intheir structure; otherwise they would all have continued to become associated bymorphic resonance with the same morphogenetic fields. Even in modern insects, ifthis diversification of the segmental primordial fails to occur during the earlystages of embryology, then the normal differences between segments are lost.This is what happens in the fruit fly Drosophila as a result of homeoticmutations in the bithorax gene complex: some transform the structures of thethird thoracic segment into those of the second, so the fly bears two pairs ofwings instead of one (figure 17); some transform abdominal segments intothoracic-type segments, bearing legs; and others have the reverse effect,transforming thoracic segments into segments of the abdominal type.12[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos786815] 8.6 The influence of other species Practical breeders of animals and plants noticed long ago that cultivatedvarieties from time to time produced offspring resembling the ancestral wildtype. Moreover, when two distinct cultivated varieties were crossed, thecharacters of the offspring sometimes resembled neither of the parental types,but rather those of the wild ancestors. This phenomenon was referred to as“reversion” or “atavism.” Darwin was particularly interested in this phenomenonbecause it agreed with his ideas about evolution and the inheritance ofancestral habits.13 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos787187] In an evolutionary context, some morphological abnormalities can be thought ofas reversions to patterns of development of more or less remote ancestralspecies. For instance, the formation of two pairs of wings in bithorax mutantsof Drosophila (figure 17) can be interpreted as a throwback to the four-wingedancestors of flies.14 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos787497] Many moreexamples of putative atavisms can be found in the teratological literature.15[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos787754] Of course such interpretationscan only be speculative, but they are not necessarily far-fetched. Mutations orabnormal environmental factors could give rise to internal conditions inembryonic tissues that resemble those in ancestral types, with similarmorphogenetic consequences. In most plants and animals, only a small proportion, less than 5 percent, of thechromosomal DNA contains genes coding for the organisms’ proteins. The functionof the great majority of the DNA is unknown. Some of this DNA may play a part inthe control of protein synthesis; some may have a structural role in thechromosomes; and some may consist of “redundant” ancestral genes that are nolonger expressed. It has been suggested that if a mutation—for example due to arearrangement of chromosome structure—led to the expression of such “latent”genes, proteins characteristic of remote ancestors might suddenly be producedagain, in some cases resulting in the reappearance of long-lost structures.16[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos788183] In terms of the hypothesis of formative causation, if any such changes caused amorphogenetic germ to take up a structure and vibrational pattern similar tothat of an ancestral species, it would come under the influence of amorphogenetic field of this species, even though all members of the species havebeen extinct for millions of years. Moreover, this effect need not be confinedto ancestral types. If as a result of mutation (or for any other reason) a germstructure in a developing organism became sufficiently similar to amorphogenetic germ in any other species, contemporary or extinct, it would “tunein” to a chreode characteristic of the other species. And if the cells werecapable of synthesizing appropriate proteins, the system would then developunder its influence. In the course of evolution, closely similar structures sometimes seem to haveappeared independently in more or less distantly related lines. For example,among the Mediterranean land snails, species belonging to well-differentiatedgenera, identifiable by their genitalia, have shells of nearly identical shapeand structure; genera of fossil ammonites show the repeated parallel developmentof keeled and grooved shells; and similar or identical wing patterns occur inquite different families of butterfly.17[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos788439] If a mutation resulted in an organism “tuning in” to another species’ chreodesand consequently developing structures characteristic of that other species, itwould soon be eliminated by natural selection if these structures reduced itschances of survival. On the other hand, if it were favored by natural selection,the proportion of such organisms in the population would tend to increase. Theselection pressures that favored its increase might well resemble those thatfavored the original evolution of this particular character in the otherspecies. And sometimes the structural resemblance might even be favored for itsown sake, precisely because it enabled the organism to mimic members of anotherspecies. Thus evolutionary parallelisms may depend on both one species pickingup the morphogenetic fields of another and parallel selection pressures. 8.7 The origin of new forms According to the hypothesis of formative causation, morphic resonance andgenetic inheritance together account for the repetition of characteristicpatterns of morphogenesis in successive generations of plants and animals.Characteristics acquired in response to the environment can become hereditarythrough a combination of morphic resonance, epigenetics, and genetic selection. The morphology of organisms can be changed through the suppression or repetitionof chreodes; and some striking instances of parallel evolution can be attributedto the transfer of chreodes from one species to another. However, neither the repetition, modification, addition, subtraction, norpermutation of existing morphogenetic fields can explain the origin of thesefields themselves. During the course of evolution, entirely new morphic unitstogether with their morphogenetic fields must have come into being: those of thebasic types of cells, tissues, and organs; of fundamentally different kinds oflower and higher plants and animals, such as mosses, ferns, conifers, spiders,birds, and mammals; and of structures such as feathers and eyes. As discussed in chapter 12, the origin of new forms can be ascribed to thecreative activity of an agency pervading and transcending nature; or to acreative impetus immanent in nature; or to blind and purposeless chance. Fromthe point of view of natural science, the question of evolutionary creativitycan only be left open. "},{"pageContent":"9 image [images/00003.jpg] MOVEMENTS AND BEHAVIORAL FIELDS 9.1 Introduction The discussion in the preceding chapters concerned the role of formativecausation in morphogenesis. The subject of this and the following two chaptersis the role of formative causation in the control of movement and behavior. Some of the movements of plants and animals are spontaneous; that is to say theytake place in the absence of any particular stimulus from the environment. Othermovements take place in response to environmental stimuli. Of course, organismsrespond passively to gross physical forces—a tree may be blown over by the wind,or an animal may be carried away by a strong current of water—but many responsesare active, and cannot be explained as gross physical or chemical effects of thestimuli on the organism as a whole: they reveal the organism’s sensitivity tothe environment. This sensitivity generally depends on specialized receptors orsense organs. The physical and chemical basis of the excitation of these specialized receptorsby stimuli from the environment has been worked out in considerable detail; sohas the physiology of nerve impulses; and so has the functioning of the musclesand other motor structures. But very little is known about the control andcoordination of behavior. In this chapter I suggest that just as formative causation organizesmorphogenesis through the probability structures of fields that impose patternand order on energetically indeterminate processes, so it organizes movements,and hence behavior. The similarities between morphogenesis and behavior are notimmediately obvious, but are easiest to understand in the case of plants andunicellular animals such as Amoeba, whose movements are essentiallymorphogenetic. These are considered first. 9.2 The movements of plants Plants generally move by growing.1[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos788791] This fact becomes easier toappreciate when they are seen on speeded-up films: shoots stretch out and curvetoward the light; taproots thrust downward into the soil; and the tips oftendrils and climbing stems sweep out wide spirals in the air until they makecontact with a solid support and coil around it.2[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos789018] The growth and development of plants takes place under the control of theirmorphogenetic fields, which give them their characteristic forms. But theorientation of this growth is determined to a large extent by the directionalstimuli of gravity and light. Environmental factors also influence the type ofdevelopment: for example in dim light, plants become etiolated; their shootsgrow relatively rapidly in a spindly manner until they get into brighter light. Gravity is “sensed” through its effects on starch grains, which roll downwardand accumulate in the lowest parts of the cells.3[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos789225] The direction from which lightis coming is detected by the differential absorption of radiant energy on theilluminated and shaded sides of organs by a yellow carotenoid pigment.4[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos789459] The sense of “touch” by whichclimbing shoots and tendrils locate solid supports may involve the release of asimple chemical, ethylene, from the surface cells when they are mechanicallystimulated.5 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos789725] The changeoverfrom etiolated to normal growth depends on the absorption of light by a blueprotein pigment called phytochrome.6[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos789938] The responses to these stimuli involve complicated physical and chemical changeswithin the cells and tissues, and in some cases depend on the differentialdistribution of hormones such as auxin. However, the reactions cannot beexplained in terms of these physical and chemical changes alone, but can beunderstood only within the context of the plants’ overall morphogenetic fields.For example, owing to their inherent polarity, plants produce shoots at one endand roots at the other. The directional stimulus of gravity orients thispolarized development so that the shoots grow upward and the roots downward. Theaction of the gravitational field on starch grains within the cells andconsequent changes in hormonal distribution are indeed causes of these orientedgrowth movements, but cannot in themselves account for the preexisting polarity;nor for the fact that the main shoots and roots respond in exactly oppositesenses; nor for the fact that some plants grow into trees, while others areannual or perennial herbs, climbers, or creepers; nor for the particularpatterns of branching in the shoot and root systems of different species, suchas the patterns in which they spread—the upright form of a Lombardy poplar isvery different from the shape of an English oak. All these characteristicsdepend on the morphogenetic fields. Although most of the movements of plants occur only in young growing organs,some structures retain the ability to move even when they are mature, forexample flowers that open and close again daily, and leaves that fold up atnight. These movements are influenced by the intensity of the light and otherenvironmental factors; they are also under the control of a “physiologicalclock” and continue to take place at approximately daily intervals, even if theplants are placed in an unchanging environment.7[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos790207] The leaves or petals open upbecause specialized cells in the “hinge” region at their bases become turgid;they close when these cells lose water owing to changes in the permeability oftheir membranes to inorganic ions.8[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos790416] The regaining of turgor is anactive, energy-requiring process, comparable to growth. In addition to making “sleep” movements, the leaves of some species move duringthe course of the day in response to the changing position of the sun. Forexample, in the pigeon pea, Cajanus cajan, the leaflets exposed to the sun areoriented approximately parallel to the sun’s rays, exposing the minimum surfacearea to the intense tropical radiation. But leaves in the shade orientthemselves at right angles to the incident radiation, thus intercepting themaximum amount of light. These responses depend on the direction and intensityof light falling on the specialized leaf joints, the pulvini. Throughout the daythe leaves and leaflets are continuously adjusting their positions as the sunmoves across the sky. At night they take up their vertical “sleep” positions:the pulvini are sensitive to gravity as well as light. In the sensitive plant, Mimosa pudica, the leaflets close up and the leavespoint downward at night, as they do in many other leguminous plants. But thesemovements also occur rapidly during the daytime in response to mechanicalstimulation (figure 24). The stimulus causes a wave of electricaldepolarization, similar to a nerve impulse, to pass down the leaf; if thestimulus is strong enough, the impulse spreads to other leaves, which also foldup.9 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos790750] Similarly, in the Venusflytrap, Dionaea muscipula, mechanical stimulation of the sensitive hairs on thesurface of the leaf causes an electrical impulse to travel to the turgid “hinge”cells, which rapidly lose water; the leaf closes like a trap around haplessinsects, which are then digested.10[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos791124] image [images/00028.jpg]Figure 24. Leaves of the sensitive plant, Mimosa pudica. Left, unstimulated;right, stimulated. These movements of leaves and leaflets in response to light, gravity, andmechanical stimulation are made possible by the fact that specialized cells areable to lose water and then “grow” again; they consequently retain a simplifiedmorphogenetic potential, while that of most other tissues is lost when theymature and cease to grow. The reversible movements of these specializedstructures are limiting cases of morphogenesis in which the changes of form havebecome stereotyped and repetitive. But their quasi-mechanistic simplicity isevolutionarily secondary, not primary; it has evolved from a background in whichsensitivity to environmental stimuli is associated with the growth andmorphogenesis of the plant as a whole. 9.3 Amoeboid movement Amoebae move by the bulk flow of their cytoplasm into growing projections, thepseudopodia. They normally creep along the surface of solid objects by thecontinued extension of their front ends. But if the pseudopodia are touched, orif they encounter heat or strong solutions of various chemicals, they stopgrowing; others develop instead, and so the cells change course. If the newpseudopodia again encounter any potentially harmful stimuli, they too stop, andthe amoebae move off in yet another direction. This system of “trial and error”continues until they find a pathway without obstacles or unfavorable stimuli.11[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos791490] In free-floating amoebae not exposed to any particular directional stimulus,there is no consistent orientation of growth; pseudopodia keep developing invarious directions until one of them comes into contact with a surface alongwhich it can creep (figure 25). The extension of pseudopodia presumably occurs under the influence of a specificpolarized morphogenetic field. The orientation in which new pseudopodia start toform may depend to a large extent on chance fluctuations within the cell; thevirtual pseudopodia projected outward from the cell body are then actualizedthrough the organization of contractile filaments and other structures withinthe cytoplasm. This process continues until the development of the pseudopodiais inhibited by stimuli from the environment or by competition from pseudopodiagrowing in other directions. The fact that amoeboid movements depend on continuous morphogenetic processes isaptly indicated in the specific name Amoeba proteus by the allusion to themythical sea deity who kept changing from one shape to another. Amoebae feed by engulfing food particles, such as bacteria, by the process ofphagocytosis: pseudopodia grow around the particle that is in contact with thesurface of the cell; the membranes of the pseudopodia fuse together, and theparticle is enclosed within the cell surrounded by a part of the cell membrane.Other vesicles containing digestive enzymes fuse with this phagocytotic vesicleand the food is digested. This type of morphogenesis is distinct from that ofcellular locomotion and presumably takes place under the influence of adifferent morphogenetic field, the orientation of which depends on the contactof the potential food particle with the membrane. This particle in contact withthe membrane can be regarded as the morphogenetic germ; the final form is theparticle engulfed within the cell. The chreode of phagocytosis leading to thisfinal form is given by morphic resonance from all similar acts of phagocytosisby similar amoebae in the past. image [images/00029.jpg]Figure 25. Method by which a floating amoeba passes to a solid surface. AfterJennings, 1906) 9.4 The repetitive morphogenesis of specialized structures The movements of most animals depend on the change of form of certainspecialized structures, rather than of the body as a whole. The beating of whiplike outgrowths, flagella or cilia, propels many unicellularorganisms, while the form of the rest of the cell remains more or less fixed(figure 26). These motile organelles contain long tubular elements very similarto cytoplasmic microtubles. Cilia move because the microtubule filaments withinthem slide relative to one another with the consumption of chemical energy, justas filaments of actin and myosin slide relative to one another in musclecontractions. The change of shape of the microtubule proteins generates a shearforce, resulting in the bending of the flagella or cilia.12[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos792222] image [images/00030.jpg]Figure 26. A: A flagellate, Euglena gracilis. (After Raven et al., 1976) B: Aciliate, Tetrahymena pyriformis. (After Mackinnon and Hawes, 1961) In ciliates, the movements of the many individual cilia are coordinated in sucha way that waves of beating pass over the surface of the cell. In some species,this coordination seems to depend on the mechanical influence of the cilia ontheir neighbors; and in others, on an excitatory system within the cell probablyassociated with fine fibrils connecting together the bases of the cilia.13[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos792445] If a swimming ciliate, for example Paramecium, meets with an unfavorablestimulus, the direction of ciliary beating reverses: the organism backs away andthen swims forward again in a new direction.14[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos792724] This avoidance reaction isprobably triggered by the entry of calcium or other ions into the cell as aresult of an alteration in membrane permeability brought about by thestimulus.15 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos792947] The change of form of the beating flagella and cilia, as well as the control ofthis beating, takes place in such a stereotyped, repetitive way that it seemsalmost machinelike. This quasi-mechanistic specialization of structure andfunction is taken still further in the multicellular animals. Entire cells andgroups of cells are specialized to undergo a repeated, simplified morphogenesisin their cycles of contraction and relaxation; others have a specializedsensitivity to light, chemicals, pressure, vibration, or other stimuli; and thenerves, with their enormously elongated axons, are specialized to conductelectrical impulses from place to place, linking the sense organs and themuscles to the nerve net or central nervous system. 9.5 Nervous systems Just as the beating of the cilia on the surface of a cell is coordinated throughfibrils connecting the bases of the cilia, so the contraction of individualmuscle cells is coordinated through the nerves. When a single nerve activatesseveral neighboring muscle cells, they can be caused to contract simultaneously.And when the activity of this nerve is part of a higher-level system of control,the contraction of different groups of cells can be coordinated in a rhythmicalmanner, as it is in a muscle that maintains its tension over a period of time.Then yet higher-level systems control repetitive cycles of contraction indifferent muscles, for example in the legs of an animal as it runs. Hierarchiesof coordination (cf. figure 10) are expressed through the nervous system. But although nerves transmit definite “all-or-none” impulses from one place toanother, formative causation would not be able to control animals’ movementsthrough the nervous system unless the activity of the nerves was at the sametime inherently probabilistic. In fact it is. The firing of nerve impulses depends on changes in the permeability of themembranes of nerve cells to inorganic ions, in particular sodium and potassium.These changes can be brought about either by electrical stimulation or byspecific chemical transmitters (e.g., acetylcholine) released from nerve endingsat synaptic junctions (figure 27). The excitation of nerves by electricalstimuli around the threshold level has long been known to take placeprobabilistically.16 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos793180] The mainreason for this is that the electrical potential across the membrane fluctuatesin a random manner.17 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos793476] Moreover,the changes in postsynaptic membrane potentials caused by chemical transmittersalso show random fluctuations,18[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos793745] which seem to be due to theprobabilistic opening and closing of ionic “channels” across the membrane.19[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos793990] There is an inherent probabilism not only in the responses of postsynapticmembranes to chemical transmitters but also in the release of the transmittersfrom the presynaptic nerve endings. Transmitter molecules are stored in numerousmicroscopic vesicles (figure 27), and are released into the synaptic cleft whenthese vesicles fuse with the membrane. This process occurs spontaneously atrandom intervals, giving rise to discharges of so-called miniature end-platepotentials. The rate of secretion is greatly increased when an impulse arrivesat the nerve ending, but here again the fusion of the vesicles with the membranetakes place probabilistically.20[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos794249] image [images/00031.jpg]Figure 27. Part of a nerve cell, with numerous synapses on its surface. Theinset shows an individual synapse in more detail. Pre SM = presynaptic membrane;Post SM = postsynaptic membrane. (Based on Krstic, 1979) Within the brain, a typical nerve cell has thousands of fine, threadlikeprojections that end in synaptic junctions on other nerve cells, and,conversely, projections from hundreds or thousands of other nerve cells end insynapses on its own surface (figure 27). Some of these nerve endings releaseexcitatory transmitters that tend to promote the firing of an impulse; othersare inhibitory and reduce the tendency of the nerve to fire. The triggering ofimpulses depends on a balance of excitatory and inhibitory influences fromhundreds of synapses. At any given time, in many of the nerve cells in the brainthis balance is poised so critically that firing either occurs or does not occuras a result of probabilistic fluctuations within the cell membranes or synapses.Thus the deterministic propagation of nerve impulses from place to place withinthe body is combined with a high degree of indeterminism within the centralnervous system, which, on the present hypothesis, is ordered and patterned byformative causation. 9.6 Morphogenetic fields, motor fields, and behavioral fields Although the fields controlling the changes of form of the specialized motorstructures of animals are in fact morphogenetic fields, they bring aboutmovements rather than net changes of form. For this reason it seems preferableto call them motor fields. (The word motor is used here as the adjective of thenoun motion.) Motor fields, like morphogenetic fields, depend on morphicresonance from previous similar systems and are concerned with the actualizationof virtual forms. Canalized pathways toward a final form or state can bereferred to as chreodes in the context of motor fields, just as they can in thecontext of morphogenetic fields. Motor fields, like morphogenetic fields, are hierarchically organized, and arein general related to development, survival, or reproduction. Whereas in plantsthese processes are almost entirely morphogenetic, in animals they also dependon movement. Indeed, in most animals even the maintenance of the normalfunctions of the body involves continual movement of internal organs such as thegut, the heart, and the breathing system. Unlike plants, animals need to feed on other organisms in order to develop andmaintain their forms. Hence an important high-level motor field in all animalsis that of feeding. At this point the motor field becomes a behavioral field,responsible for organizing inherited or learned patterns of behavior. Behavioralfields are organized in a nested hierarchy or holarchy (figure 10), withhigher-level fields coordinating the activity of lower-level fields, right downto the motor fields that organize the activity of groups of muscle cells. The behavioral field of feeding organizes subsidiary behavioral fieldsresponsible for finding, securing, and eating the plants or animals that serveas food. Some animals are sedentary and cause food to move toward them in watercurrents; some simply move around until they find plants they can eat; somestalk and hunt other animals; some make traps to catch their prey; some areparasitic; others are scavengers. All these methods of feeding depend onhierarchies of specific chreodes. Another fundamental type of motor field is concerned with the avoidance ofunfavorable conditions. Amoeba and Paramecium show the simplest type ofreaction: backing or turning away from the unfavorable stimulus and setting offin some other direction. Sedentary animals such as Stentor and Hydra react tomildly unfavorable stimuli by contracting their bodies, but in response tomore-severe stimuli they move away and settle down somewhere else. In additionto general avoidance reactions, more-complex animals also exhibit special typesof behavior, shaped by behavioral fields, that help them to escape frompredators; for example, they may run away swiftly, or stand their ground andsomehow frighten the predator, or “freeze” in such a way that they are lesseasily seen. The overall fields of development and survival have as their final form thefully grown animal under optimal conditions. Whenever this state is reached,there is no need for the animal to do anything in particular; but deviationsfrom this state bring the animal under the influence of the various behavioralfields directed toward its restoration. In fact, such deviations are frequent:the animal’s continuous metabolism depletes its reserves of food; changes in theenvironment expose it to unfavorable conditions; and predators approach itunpredictably. These and other changes are detected by the sensory structuresand result in characteristic modifications of the nervous system, eitherdirectly or through the release of hormones such as adrenaline. Thesemodifications of the activity of the nervous system provide the germ structuresfor particular behavioral fields, which enter into morphic resonance withprevious similar patterns of activity in the same animal or in other, similaranimals. Both individual and collective memory depends on morphic resonance.21[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos794445] The attractor for the overall field of reproduction is the establishment ofviable progeny. In unicellular organisms, and in simple multicellular animalssuch as Hydra, this is achieved by a morphogenetic process: the organisms divideinto two, or “bud off ” new individuals. Likewise, primitive methods of sexualreproduction are essentially morphogenetic: many lower animals (e.g., seaurchins) as well as lower plants (e.g., the seaweed Fucus) simply releasemillions of ova and sperm cells into the water around them. In more-complex animals, the sperm are released in the vicinity of the ova as aresult of specialized mating behavior. Thus the overall field of reproductioncomes to cover the behavioral fields of searching for a mate, of courtship, andof copulation. Organisms may come under the influence of the first motor fieldin the sequence as a result of internal physiological changes mediated byhormones, as well as olfactory, visual, or other stimuli from potential mates.The end point of the first field constitutes the germ for the second, and so on:searching for a mate is followed by courtship, which, if successful, leads tothe copulation chreode. In the simplest cases, the final form of the wholesequence is for the male ejaculation and for the female the laying of eggs. Inmany aquatic organisms they are simply released into the water, but in landanimals the deposition of eggs often involves complex and highly specificpatterns of behavior; for example, ichneumon flies inject their eggs intocaterpillars of definite species, inside which the larvae develop parasitically,and potter wasps make small “pots” in which they place paralyzed prey beforelaying their eggs upon the prey and sealing the “pots.” In some viviparous species the young are simply released and abandoned at birth.But when the young are cared for after they are born or hatched, a new range ofbehavioral fields comes into play, still under the overall field of reproductionof the parents, but at the same time serving the field of development andsurvival of the young. Consequently, the behavior of the animals takes on asocial dimension. In the simplest cases the societies are temporary anddisintegrate when the offspring become independent; in others they persist, witha consequent increase in the complexity of behavior. Special behavioral fieldscontrol the various types of communication between individuals and thedifferentiated tasks that different individuals perform. But the overall fieldthat organizes the society is a field at a higher level: a social field. A social field is the field of a social group. It organizes the form of thesociety and the interrelations between the individual animals within it. It is afield in a nested hierarchy of fields (figure 10) at a higher and more inclusivelevel than the individual animals that make up the society. In the extraordinarily complex societies of the termites, ants, and social beesand wasps, individuals of similar or identical genetic constitutions performquite different tasks, and even the same individual may play different roles atdifferent times—for example, a young worker bee may first clean the hive, thenafter a few days act as a brood nurse, then help build the honeycombs, thenreceive and store pollen, then guard the hive, and finally go out foraging.22[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos794640] Each of these roles must becovered by a social field, which in turn controls the behavioral and motorfields of the individual insects. Within those animals, the overall fields ofbehavior control the lower-level chreodes involved in the particular specializedtasks. Changes in the insect’s nervous system bring it under the influence ofone or other of these higher-level fields by causing it to enter into morphicresonance with previous workers that filled that particular role. Such changesdepend to some extent on alterations in the physiology of the insect as it growsolder, but they are also strongly influenced by the society as a whole: theroles of individuals change in response to disturbances of the hive or society;the whole system regulates. The behavioral fields of feeding, avoidance, reproduction, etc., generallycontrol a series of lower-level fields that act in sequence, the final form ofone providing the germ structure for the next. Motor fields still lower in thehierarchy often act in cycles to give repetitive movements, such as those of thelegs in walking, the wings in flying, and the jaws in chewing. At the lowestlevel are those fields concerned with the detailed control of the contraction ofthe cells within the muscles. Behavioral fields embrace the sense organs, the nervous system, and the muscles,but also extend beyond the surface of the animal linking it to objects outsidethe animal, in the external world. Consider, for example, the field of feeding.The overall process—the capture and ingestion of food—is in fact a special typeof aggregative morphogenesis (section 4.1). The hungry animal is the germstructure that enters into morphic resonance with previous fields of feeding. Inthe case of a predator, these fields are concerned with the capture andingestion of prey. The field of capture projects into the space around theanimal, and includes within it the virtual form of the prey (figure 11). Thisvirtual form is actualized when an entity corresponding to this virtual form isnear the predator: the prey is recognized and the capture chreode initiated.23[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos794868] Theoretically, the behavioralfield could affect probabilistic events in any or all of the systems itembraces, including the muscles, the perceptual system, and the prey itself. Butin most cases its influence is concerned primarily with the modification ofprobabilistic events in the central nervous system, directing the movements ofthe animal toward the achievement of the final form, in this case the capture ofthe prey. 9.7 Behavioral fields and the senses Through morphic resonance, an animal comes under the influence of specificbehavioral fields as a result of its characteristic structure and internalpatterns of rhythmic activity. These patterns are modified by changes arisingwithin the body of the animal, and by influences from the environment. If different stimuli brought about the same changes within the animal, then thesame motor and behavioral fields would come into play. This is what seems tohappen in unicellular organisms that give the same avoidance reaction to a widevariety of physical and chemical stimuli: probably all of them have similareffects on the physical and chemical state of the cell, for example by modifyingthe permeability of the cell membrane to calcium or other ions. In simple multicellular animals with relatively little sensory specialization,the range of reactions to stimuli is not much greater than in unicellularorganisms. Hydra, for instance, shows the same avoidance reactions to manydifferent physical and chemical stimuli, and it responds to objects such as foodparticles only as a result of mechanical contact. However, as in certainunicellular organisms, its response to solid objects is modified by chemicalstimuli. This can be demonstrated by a simple experiment: If small pieces offilter paper are supplied to the tentacles of a hungry Hydra, they evoke noreaction; but if they are first soaked in meat juice, the tentacles carry themtoward the mouth, where they are swallowed.24[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos795091] By contrast, animals possessing image-forming eyes can sense objects while theyare still some distance away; consequently, the behavioral fields project farfarther outward into the environment; the range and scope of the animals’behavior is greatly increased. The detection of these fields by potential preyanimals may underlie the sense of being stared at.25[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos795314] The sense of hearing enables distant objects to be detected and permits anextension of the spatial range of the motor fields even into regions that cannotbe seen. In some animals, most notably bats, this sense has replaced sight asthe basis of the extended behavioral fields. And in a few aquatic species, suchas the Mormyrid and Gymnotid electric fish, specialized receptors detect changesin the electric field set up around themselves by pulses from their electricorgans; this sense enables them to locate prey and other objects in the muddytropical rivers in which they live. As animals move, the sensory stimuli arising both within their bodies and fromthe environment change as a consequence of their own movements. This continuousfeedback plays an essential part in the coordination of movements by their motorfields. Behavioral and motor fields, like morphogenetic fields, are probabilitystructures that become associated by morphic resonance with physical systems onthe basis of their three-dimensional patterns of oscillation. It is therefore offundamental significance that all sensory inputs are translated intospatio-temporal patterns of activity within the nervous system. In the sense oftouch, the stimuli act on particular parts of the body, which through specificnervous pathways are “mapped” within the brain; in vision, images falling on theretina bring about spatially patterned changes in the optic nerves and visualcortex. Although olfactory, gustatory, and auditory stimuli are not directlyspatial, the nerves they excite through the relevant sense organs have specificlocations, and the impulses traveling along these nerves into the centralnervous system set up characteristic patterns of excitation.26[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos795498] Thus particular stimuli and combinations of stimuli have characteristicspatio-temporal effects that have been revealed in ever-increasing detail byelectroencephalographs (EEGs) and brain scans, for example by functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These dynamic patterns of activity bring thenervous system into morphic resonance with similar past nervous systems insimilar states, and consequently under the influence of particular behavioraland motor fields. 9.8 Regulation and regeneration Behavioral fields, like morphogenetic fields, attract the systems under theirinfluence toward characteristic final forms. They usually do so by initiating aseries of movements in a definite sequence. The intermediate stages arestabilized by morphic resonance; in other words, they are chreodes. But chreodessimply represent the most probable pathways toward final forms. If the normalpathway is blocked, or if the system is deflected from it for any reason, thesame final form may be reached in a different way: the system regulates (section4.1). Many, but not all, morphogenetic systems are capable of regulation; and soare social, behavioral, and motor systems. Regulation occurs under the influence of behavioral and motor fields at alllevels in the hierarchy: for example, if a few muscles or nerves in a dog’s legare damaged, the pattern of contraction in the other muscles adjusts so that thelimb functions normally. If the leg is amputated, the movements of the remaininglegs change in such a way that the dog can still walk, although with a limp. Ifparts of its cerebral cortex are damaged, after some time it recovers more orless completely. If it is blinded, its ability to move around gradually improvesas it comes to rely more on its remaining senses. And if its normal route towardits home, its food, or its puppies is blocked, it changes its habitual sequenceof movements until it finds a new way to reach its goal. The behavioral equivalent of regeneration occurs when the final form of achreode has been actualized but is then disrupted: think, for instance, of a catthat has caught a mouse, the end point of the capture chreode. If the mouseescapes from its clutches, then the cat’s movements are directed towardrecapturing it. Out of all the examples of “behavioral regeneration,” the homology withmorphogenetic regeneration is shown most clearly in “morphogenetic behavior,”concerned with the making of nests and other structures. In some cases animalsmend these structures after they have been damaged. For example, potter waspscan fill in holes made by the experimenter in the walls of their pots, sometimesusing actions never normally performed when the pots are being constructed.27[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos795716] And termites repair damage totheir galleries and nests through the cooperative and coordinated activities ofmany individual insects.28 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos795927] Activities such as these have sometimes been interpreted as evidence ofintelligence, on the ground that animals behaving in a rigidly fixed,instinctive manner would not be able to respond so flexibly to unusualsituations.29 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos796198] But by the sametoken, regulating sea urchin embryos and regenerating flatworms could also besaid to exhibit intelligence. However, this extension of psychologicalterminology is more confusing than helpful. From the point of view of thehypothesis of formative causation, the similarities can be recognized butinterpreted the other way around. Seen against the background of morphogeneticregulation and regeneration, the ability of animals to reach behavioral goals inunusual ways raises no fundamentally new principles. And when, in higheranimals, certain types of behavior no longer follow standard chreodes— whenbehavioral regulation becomes, as it were, the rule rather than theexception—this flexibility can be seen as an extension of the possibilitiesinherent in morphogenetic and motor fields by their very nature. 9.9 Morphic fields Morphogenetic fields organize morphogenesis. Motor fields organize movements;behavioral fields organize behavior; and social fields organize societies. Thesefields are hierarchically ordered in the sense that social fields include andorganize the behavioral fields of animals within the society; the animals’behavioral fields organize their motor fields; and the motor fields depend fortheir activity on the animals’ nervous systems and bodies organized bymorphogenetic fields. These are all different kinds of morphic field. “Morphic field” is a genericterm that includes all kinds of fields that have an inherent memory given bymorphic resonance from previous similar systems.30[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos796409] Morphogenetic, motor,behavioral, and social fields are all morphic fields, and they are allessentially habitual. "},{"pageContent":"10 image [images/00003.jpg] INSTINCT AND LEARNING 10.1 The influence of past actions Behavioral fields, like morphogenetic fields, are given by morphic resonancefrom previous similar systems. The detailed structure of an animal and thepatterns of oscillatory activity within its nervous system will generallyresemble itself more closely than any other animal. Thus the most specificmorphic resonance acting upon it will be that from its own past (section 6.5).The next most specific resonance will come from genetically similar animals thatlived in the same environment, and the least specific from animals of otherraces living in different environments. In the valley model of the chreode(figure 5), the latter will stabilize the general outline of the valley, whilethe more specific resonance will determine the detailed topology of the valleybottom. The “contours” of the chreodic valley depend on the degree of similarity betweenthe behavior of similar animals of the same race or species. If their patternsof movement show little variation, morphic resonance will give rise to deep andnarrow chreodes, represented by steep-walled valleys (figure 28A). These willhave a strongly canalizing effect on the behavior of subsequent individuals,which will therefore tend to behave in very similar ways. Stereotyped patternsof movement brought about by such chreodes at lower levels appear as reflexes,and at higher levels as instincts. image [images/00032.jpg]Figure 28. Diagrammatic representation of a deeply canalized chreode (A), and achreode that is weakly canalized in the initial stages (B). On the other hand, if similar animals reach the final forms of their behavioralfields by different patterns of movement, the chreodes will not be so welldefined (figure 28B); there will therefore be more scope for individualdifferences in behavior. But once a particular animal has reached the behavioralgoal in its own way, its subsequent behavior will tend to be canalized in thesame way by morphic resonance from its own past states; and the more often theseactions are repeated, the stronger will this canalization become. Suchcharacteristic individual chreodes reveal themselves as habits. Thus, from the point of view of the hypothesis of formative causation, there isa difference only of degree between instincts and habits: both depend on morphicresonance, the former from countless previous individuals of the same speciesand the latter mainly from past states of the same individual. Reflexes and instincts depend on the very specifically patterned morphogenesisof the nervous system in the first place, itself dependent on morphic resonance. During learning, physical or chemical changes may occur in the nervous systemthat facilitate the repetition of a pattern of movement. Perhaps in simplenervous systems carrying out stereotyped functions, the potential for suchchanges may already be “built in” to the “wiring” in such a way that learningoccurs quasi-mechanistically. For example, in the snail Aplysia, the structureof the nervous system is almost identical in different individuals, down to thefine details of the arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory synapses onparticular cells. Very simple types of learning occur in connection with thereflex withdrawal of the gill into the mantle cavity, namely habituation toharmless stimuli, and sensitization to harmful ones. As the snails learn, theactivities of particular excitatory and inhibitory synapses acting on individualnerve cells alter in definite ways.1[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos796753] These kinds of changes in nervecells are called long-term potentiation.2[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos796988] Of course, the mere descriptionof these processes does not in itself reveal the reasons for the alterations;these are at present a matter for conjecture. But how is this detailedspecialization of structure and function in the nerves and synapses establishedin the first place? The problem is shifted back to the realm of morphogenesis. The nervous systems of higher animals are much more variable from individual toindividual than in invertebrates such as Aplysia, and far more complicated. Verylittle is known about the way in which learned patterns of behavior areretained,3 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos797384] but enough has beenfound out to make it clear that there can be no simple explanation in terms ofspecifically localized physical or chemical “traces” within the nervous tissue. Numerous investigations have shown that in mammals learned habits often persistafter extensive damage to the cerebral cortex or to subcortical regions of thebrain. Moreover, when loss of memory does occur, it is closely related not tothe location of the lesions, but rather to the total amount of tissue destroyed.Karl Lashley summed up the results of hundreds of experiments as follows: “It isnot possible to demonstrate the isolated localization of a memory trace anywherewithin the nervous system. Limited regions may be essential for learning orretention of a particular activity, but within such regions the parts arefunctionally equivalent.”4 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos797642] A similar phenomenon has been demonstrated in an invertebrate, the octopus:observations on the survival of learned habits after destruction of variousparts of the vertical lobe of the brain have led to the seemingly paradoxicalconclusion that “memory is both everywhere and nowhere in particular.”5[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos797891] These findings are extremely puzzling from a mechanistic point of view. In anattempt to account for them, the neuroscientist Karl Pribram has suggested thatmemory “traces” are somehow distributed within the brain in a manner analogousto the storage of information in the form of interference patterns in ahologram.6 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos798129] But this remains nomore than a vague speculation. The hypothesis of formative causation provides an alternative interpretation, inthe light of which the persistence of learned habits in spite of damage to thebrain is far less puzzling: the habits depend on behavioral fields that are notstored within the brain at all, but rather are given directly from its paststates by morphic resonance. Some of the implications of the hypothesis of formative causation in relation toinstinct and learning are considered in the following sections, and experimentaltests are discussed in chapter 11. 10.2 Instinct In all animals, some patterns of motor activity are inborn rather than learned.The most fundamental are those of the internal organs, such as the heart andgut, but many of the patterns of movement of limbs, wings, and other motorstructures are also innate. This is most clearly apparent when animals are ableto move around competently almost as soon as they are born or hatched. It is not always easy to make the distinction between inborn and learnedbehavior. In general, characteristic behavior that develops in young animalsreared in isolation can usually be regarded as innate. However, behavior thatappears only when they are in contact with other members of their species mayalso be innate, but require stimuli from the other animals for its expression. Studies of the instinctive behavior of a wide range of animals have led toseveral general conclusions, which constitute the classical concepts ofethology.7 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos798343] These can besummarized as follows: (1) Instincts are organized in a hierarchy of “systems” or “centers”superimposed upon one another. Each level is activated primarily by a system atthe level above it. The highest center of each of the major instincts may beinfluenced by a number of factors including hormones, sensory stimuli from theviscera of the animal, and stimuli from the environment. (2) The behavior that occurs under the influence of the major instincts oftenconsists of chains of more or less stereotyped patterns of behavior called fixedaction patterns. When such a fixed action pattern constitutes the end point of amajor or minor chain of instinctive behavior, it is called a consummatory act.The behavior in the earlier part of an instinctive chain of behavior, e.g.searching for food, may be more flexible, and is usually called appetitivebehavior. (3) Each system requires a specific stimulus in order to be activated orreleased. This stimulus or releaser may come from within the animal’s body orfrom the environment. In the latter case, it is often referred to as a signstimulus. A given releaser or sign stimulus is presumed to act on a specificneurosensory mechanism called the innate releasing mechanism, which releases thereaction. These concepts harmonize remarkably well with the ideas of behavioral and motorfields developed in the previous chapter. The fixed action patterns can beunderstood in terms of chreodes, and the innate releasing mechanisms as the germstructures of the appropriate motor fields. 10.3 Sign stimuli The instinctive responses of animals to sign stimuli show that they somehowabstract certain specific and repeatable features from their environments. Asthe ethologist Niko Tinbergen put it: > An animal responds “blindly” to only part of the total environmental situation> and neglects other parts, although its sense organs are perfectly able to> receive them . . . These effective stimuli can easily be found by testing the> response to various situations differing in one or other of the possible> stimuli. Moreover, even when a sense organ is involved in releasing a> reaction, only part of the stimuli that it can receive is actually effective.> As a rule, an instinctive reaction responds to only very few stimuli, and the> greater part of the environment has little or no influence, even though the> animal may have the sensory equipment for receiving numerous details.8> [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos798600] The following examples illustrate these principles:9[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos798810] The aggressive reaction of male stickleback fish during the breeding season toother male sticklebacks is released mainly by the sign stimulus of the redbelly: models with very crude shapes but with red bellies are attacked much morethan models with the correct shape but no red coloration. Similar results havebeen obtained in experiments with the red-breasted robin: a territory-holdingmale threatens very approximate models with red breasts, or even a mere bundleof red feathers, but responds much less to accurate models without red breasts. Young ducks and geese react instinctively to the approach of birds of prey, in amanner that depends on the shape of the bird in flight. Studies with cardboardmodels have shown that the most important feature is a short neck—characteristicof hawks and other predatory birds—while the size and shape of the wings andtail are relatively unimportant. In certain moths, the sex odor or pheromonenormally produced by females causes males to attempt to copulate with any objectbearing it. In locusts of the species Ephippiger ephippiger, males attract females willingto mate by their song. Females are attracted to singing males from aconsiderable distance, but ignore silent males even when quite near. Males thatare silenced by gluing their wings together are incapable of attracting females.Hens come to the rescue of chicks in response to their distress call, but not ifthey simply see them in distress, for example behind a soundproof glass barrier. According to the hypothesis of formative causation, recognition of these signstimuli depends on morphic resonance from previous similar animals exposed tosimilar stimuli. Owing to the process of automatic averaging, this resonancewill emphasize only the common features of the spatio-temporal patterns ofactivity brought about by these stimuli in the nervous system. The result willbe that only certain specific stimuli are abstracted from the environment,whereas others are ignored. Consider, for example, the stimuli acting on henswhose chicks are in distress. Imagine a collection of photographs taken ofchicks in distress on many different occasions. Those taken at night will shownothing; those in the daytime will show chicks of different sizes and shapesseen from the front, the rear, the side, or from above; moreover, they may benear to other objects of all shapes and sizes, or even concealed behind them.Now if all these photographs are superimposed to produce a composite image, nofeatures whatever will be reinforced; the result will simply be a blur. Bycontrast, imagine a series of tape recordings made at the same time thephotographs were taken. All bear the record of distress calls, and if thesesounds are superimposed, they reinforce each other to give an automaticallyaveraged distress call. This superimposition of photographs and tape recordingsis analogous to the effects of morphic resonance from the nervous systems ofprevious hens on a subsequent hen exposed to stimuli from a chick in distress:the visual stimuli result in no specific resonance and evoke no instinctivereaction, however pathetic the chick may look to a human observer, whereas theauditory stimuli do. This example serves to illustrate what seems to be a general principle: shapesare very often ineffective as sign stimuli. The probable reason is that they arehighly variable because they depend on the angle from which things are seen. Bycontrast, colors are much less critically dependent on viewpoint, and sounds andodors hardly at all. Significantly, colors, sounds, and odors play importantroles as releasers of instinctive reactions; and in those cases where shapes areeffective, there is a certain constancy of viewpoint. For example, young birdson the ground see predators flying above them in silhouette, and do indeedrespond to such shapes. And when shapes or patterns serve as sexual signstimuli, they do so in courtship displays or “presentations” in which animalstake up definite stances or postures in relation to their potential mates. Thesame is true of displays of submission and aggression. 10.4 Learning Learning can be said to occur when there is any relatively permanent adaptivechange in behavior as a result of past experience. Four general categories canbe distinguished:10 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos798936] (1) The most universal type, found even in unicellular organisms,11[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos799147] is habituation, which can bedefined as the waning of a response as a result of repeated stimulation that isnot followed by any kind of reinforcement. A common example is the fading ofalarm or avoidance responses to new stimuli that turn out to be harmless:animals get used to them. This phenomenon implies the existence of some sort of memory, which enables thestimuli to be recognized when they recur. On the hypothesis of formativecausation, this recognition is due primarily to the morphic resonance of theorganism with its own past states, including those brought about by new sensorystimuli. This resonance serves to maintain, and indeed define, the identity ofthe organism with itself in the past (section 6.5). Repeated stimuli from theenvironment to which responses are not reinforced will effectively become partof the organism’s own “background.” Conversely, any new features of theenvironment will stand out because they are not so recognized: usually theanimal will respond with avoidance or alarm precisely because the stimuli areunfamiliar. In the case of certain stereotyped responses, such as the withdrawal reflex ofthe gill in the snail Aplysia, habituation may occur in a quasimechanisticmanner on the basis of preexisting structural and biochemical specializations inthe nervous system (section 10.1). But if so, this specialization is secondary,and seems likely to have evolved from a situation in which habituation dependedmore directly on morphic resonance. (2) In all animals, innate patterns of motor activity appear as the individualsgrow up. While some are carried out perfectly the first time they are performed,others improve with time. A young bird’s first attempts to fly, for example, anda young mammal’s first attempts to walk may be only partially successful, butthey get better after repeated attempts. Not all such improvement is due topractice: in some cases it is simply a matter of maturation and occurs just asmuch with the passage of time in animals that have been immobilized.12[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos799376] Nevertheless, many types ofmotor skill do improve in a way that cannot be attributed to maturation. From the point of view of the hypothesis of formative causation, this type oflearning can be interpreted in terms of behavioral regulation. Morphic resonancefrom countless past members of the species gives an automatically averagedchreode, which governs an animal’s first attempts to carry out a particularinnate pattern of movement. This standard chreode may give only approximatelysatisfactory results, for example because of deviations from the norm in theanimal’s sense organs, nervous system, or motor structures. As the movements areperformed, regulation will spontaneously bring about fine adjustments to theoverall chreode, and to the lower-level chreodes under its control. Theseadjusted chreodes will be stabilized by morphic resonance with the animal’s ownpast states as the pattern of behavior is repeated. (3) Animals may come to respond to a stimulus with a reaction that is normallyevoked by a different stimulus. This type of learning occurs when the newstimulus is applied at the same time as, or immediately before, the originalone. The classical examples are the conditioned reflexes established by I. P.Pavlov in dogs. The dogs salivated when they were presented with food. Onrepeated occasions a bell was rung as the food was presented, and after sometime they began to salivate at the sound of the bell even in the absence offood. An extreme example of this type of learning occurs in the “imprinting” of youngbirds, especially ducklings and goslings. Soon after hatching, they respondinstinctively to any large moving object by following it. Normally this is theirmother; but they will also follow foster mothers, human beings, or eveninanimate objects dragged in front of them. After a relatively short time, theycome to recognize the general features of the moving object, and later thespecific features. Then only the particular bird, person, or object with whichthey have become imprinted elicits their following. Analogously, animals often learn to recognize the individual features of theirmates or their young by sight, sound, smell, or touch. This recognition takestime to develop: for example, a pair of coots with newly hatched chicks willfeed and even adopt strange chicks similar in appearance to their own; but whentheir young are about two weeks old, they recognize them individually, andhenceforth tolerate no strangers, however similar.13[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos799566] A comparable process is probably responsible for the recognition of particularplaces, such as nest sites, by means of landmarks and other features associatedwith them. Indeed, this type of learning seems likely to play an important partin the development of visual recognition in general. Since the stimuli from anobject differ according to the angle from which it is viewed, the animal mustlearn that they are all connected with the same thing. Likewise, theassociations between different kinds of sensory stimulus from the sameobject—visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile—usually have to belearned. When the new stimulus and the original stimulus occur simultaneously, it mightat first sight seem likely that the different patterns of physical and chemicalchange they bring about in the brain gradually become linked with each other asa result of frequent repetition. But two difficulties stand in the way of thisapparently simple interpretation. First, the new stimulus might not besimultaneous with the usual one, but precede it. In this case, it seemsnecessary to suppose that the influence of the stimulus persists for a while, sothat it is still present when the usual stimulus occurs. This kind of memory canbe thought of by analogy with an echo that gradually dies away. The existence ofshort-term memory is well established;14[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos799782] it could be explicable in termsof reverberating circuits of nervous activity within the brain.15[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos800006] Associative learning seems to involve definite discontinuities: it occurs insteps, or stages. This may be because the linkage between the new and theoriginal stimulus involves the establishment of a new motor field: the fieldresponsible for the original response must somehow be enlarged to incorporatethe new stimulus. In effect, a synthesis occurs in which a new motor unit comesinto being. And a new unit cannot emerge gradually, but only by a sudden jump(or by several successive jumps). (4) As well as learning to respond to a particular stimulus after they havereceived it, animals may also learn to behave in such a way that they reach agoal as a result of their activities. In the language of the Behaviorist school,this is called “operant conditioning.” The response “emitted” by the animalprecedes the reinforcing stimulus. Rats in “Skinner boxes” provide the classicexamples. These boxes contain a lever that, when pressed, releases a pellet offood. After repeated trials, rats learn to associate the pressing of the leverwith the reward. Similarly, they can learn to press a lever in order to avoidthe painful stimulus of an electric shock. The association of a particular pattern of movement with a reward or with theavoidance of punishment usually seems to happen as a result of trial and error.But intelligence of an altogether higher order has been demonstrated inprimates, especially chimpanzees. In the early twentieth century, WolfgangKöhler found that these apes were capable of solving problems in an “insightful”way.16 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos800364] For example, chimpanzeeswere placed in a high chamber with unclimbable walls. From the ceiling hung abunch of ripe bananas, too high to reach. After a number of attempts to get thefruit by standing on their hind legs and by jumping, they gave up trying theseways. After a while, one of the apes glanced first at one of a number of woodenboxes that had been placed in the chamber at the beginning of the experiment andthen at the bananas. He dragged the box underneath them and stood on it. Thisdid not bring him high enough, so he fetched another box and put it on top ofthe first, but it was still not high enough; he then added a third, climbed up,and grabbed the fruit. Many more examples of insightful behavior have been demonstrated by subsequentinvestigators: in one experiment, for instance, chimpanzees learned to usesticks to rake in food placed outside the cages beyond their reach. They didthis sooner if they had been allowed to play with the sticks for several daysbeforehand; during this period they came to use the sticks as functionalextensions of their arms. Thus the use of the sticks to rake in the foodrepresented “the integration of motor components acquired during earlierexperience into new and appropriate behavior patterns.”17[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos800566] In both trial and error and insight learning, existing chreodes are integratedwithin new higher-level motor fields. These syntheses can come about only bysudden “jumps.” If the new patterns of behavior are successful, they will tendto be repeated. Hence the new motor fields will be stabilized by morphicresonance as the learned behavior becomes habitual. 10.5 Innate tendencies to learn The originality of learning may be absolute: a new motor field may come intobeing not only for the first time in the history of an individual, but for thefirst time ever. On the other hand, an animal may learn something that othermembers of its species have already learned in the past. In this case, theemergence of the appropriate motor field will be facilitated by morphicresonance from previous similar animals. If a motor field becomes increasinglywell established through repetition in many individuals, learning will becomeprogressively easier: there will be a strong innate disposition toward acquiringthis particular pattern of behavior. Thus learned behavior that is repeated very frequently will tend to becomesemi-instinctive. By a converse process, instinctive behavior may come to besemi-learned. The songs of birds illustrate the intergradations betweeninstinctive and learned behavior particularly clearly.18[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos800851] In some species, such as thewood pigeon and the cuckoo, the pattern of the song varies little from bird tobird and is almost completely innate. But in others, for example the chaffinch,the song has a general structure characteristic of the species, but in its finedetail it differs from individual to individual; these differences can berecognized by other birds and play an important part in the birds’ family andsocial life. Birds raised in isolation produce simplified and rather featurelessversions of the chaffinch song, showing that its general structure is innate.However, under normal conditions they develop and improve their singing byimitating other chaffinches. This process is taken much further in mockingbirds,for example, which borrow elements from the songs of other species. And somekinds of birds, notably parrots and mynahs, when kept in captivity often imitatetheir human foster parents. In species whose songs are almost entirely innate, the lack of individualvariation is both an effect and a cause of the well-defined and highlystabilized motor chreodes (figure 28A): the more the same pattern of movement isrepeated, the greater will be its tendency to be repeated in the future. But inspecies with individual differences in song, morphic resonance will give lesswell-defined chreodes (figure 28B): the general structure of the chreode will begiven by the process of automatic averaging, but the details will depend on theindividual and its own experience and habits, remembered through morphicresonance with itself in the past. "},{"pageContent":"11 image [images/00003.jpg] THE INHERITANCE AND EVOLUTION OF BEHAVIOR 11.1 The inheritance of behavior On the hypothesis of formative causation, the inheritance of behavior depends ongenetic inheritance, and on epigenetic inheritance, and on the morphogeneticfields that control the development of the nervous system and the animal as awhole, and on the behavioral and motor fields given by morphic resonance fromprevious similar animals. By contrast, according to the conventional theory,innate behavior is supposed to be “programmed” in the DNA. Relatively few experimental investigations have been carried out on theinheritance of behavior, largely because it is difficult to quantify.Nevertheless, various attempts have been made: for instance, in experiments withrats and mice, behavior has been measured in terms of their running speed ontreadmills; the frequency and duration of sexual activity; defecation scores,defined as the number of fecal boluses deposited in a given area in unit time;maze-learning abilities; and susceptibility to audiogenic seizures, caused byvery loud noises. A heritable component of these responses has been demonstratedby breeding from animals with high or low scores: the progeny tend to havescores resembling those of their parents.1[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos801225] The trouble with investigations of this type is that they reveal very littleabout the inheritance of patterns of behavior; moreover, the results aredifficult to interpret because they are open to influence by so many differentfactors. For example, a lower treadmill speed or a reduced frequency of matingcould be due simply to a general reduction in vigor as a consequence of aheritable metabolic deficiency. In some cases, the reasons for genetic alterations of behavior have beeninvestigated in considerable detail. In the small nematode worm Caenorhabditis,certain mutants that wriggle abnormally show structural changes in their nervoussystems.2 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos801428] In Drosophila,various “behavioral mutations” that abolish the normal response to light havebeen found to affect the photoreceptors or the peripheral visual neurons.3[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos801663] In mice, a number of behavioralmutations are known to affect the morphogenesis of the nervous system, leadingto defects of whole regions of the brain. In human beings, various congenitalabnormalities of the nervous system are associated with abnormal behavior, forexample in Down’s syndrome. And then behavior can also be affected by hereditaryphysiological and biochemical defects; for instance, in humans the condition ofphenylketonuria, associated with mental retardation, is due to a deficiency ofthe enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. The fact that innate behavior is affected by genetically determined alterationsin the structure and function of the sense organs, nervous system, etc., doesnot, of course, prove that its inheritance is explicable in terms of geneticfactors alone; it shows only that a normal body is necessary for normalbehavior. Think again of the radio analogy: Changes within the set affect itsperformance, but this does not prove that the music that comes out of theloudspeakers originates inside the set itself. In the realm of behavior, biochemical, physiological, and anatomical changes mayprevent the appearance of germ structures, and hence whole motor fields may failto act; or they may have various quantitative effects on the movementscontrolled by these fields. And, in fact, investigations on the inheritance offixed action patterns show that “it is not difficult to find variations thataffect the performance in a minor fashion, but the unit still appears in aclearly recognizable form if it appears at all.”4[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos801901] The inheritance of behavioral and motor fields is probably dependent on thefactors already discussed in connection with the inheritance of morphogeneticfields (chapter 7). Generally speaking, in hybrids between two races or species,the dominance of the behavioral fields of one over those of the other is likelyto depend on the relative strength of the morphic resonance from the parentaltypes (figure 19). If one belongs to a well-established race or species and theother to a relatively new one with a small past population, the behavioralfields of the former would be dominant. But if the parental races of specieswere equally well established, the hybrids would come under the influence ofboth to a similar extent. This is in fact what seems to happen. In some cases, the results are bizarrebecause the patterns of behavior of the parental types are incompatible witheach other. One example is provided by the hybrids produced by crossing twokinds of lovebird. Both parental species make their nests out of strips thatthey tear from leaves in a similar manner, but whereas one (Fischer’s lovebird)then carries these strips to the nest in its bill, the other (the peach-facedlovebird) carries them tucked in among its feathers. Hybrids tear the stripsfrom the leaves normally, but then behave in a most confused manner, sometimestucking the strips in among their feathers, sometimes carrying them in theirbills; but even when they carry them in their bills, they erect the feathers ofthe lower back and rump and attempt to tuck them in.5[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos802254] 11.2 Morphic resonance and behavior: an experimental test In mechanistic biology, a sharp distinction is drawn between innate and learnedbehavior: the former is assumed to be “genetically programmed” or “coded” in theDNA, while the latter is supposed to result from physical and chemical changesin the nervous system. There is no conceivable way in which such changes couldspecifically modify the DNA, as the Lamarckian theory would require; it istherefore considered impossible for learned behavior acquired by an animal to beinherited by its offspring (excluding, of course, “cultural inheritance,”whereby the offspring learn patterns of behavior from their parents or otheradults). By contrast, according to the hypothesis of formative causation, there is nodifference in kind between innate and learned behavior: both depend on motorfields given by morphic resonance (section 10.1). This hypothesis thereforeadmits a possible transmission of learned behavior from one animal to another,and leads to testable predictions that differ not only from those of theorthodox theory of inheritance, but also from those of the Lamarckian theory. Consider the following experiment. Animals of an inbred strain are placed underconditions in which they learn to respond to a given stimulus in acharacteristic way. They are then made to repeat this pattern of behavior manytimes. Ex hypothesi, the new behavioral field will be reinforced by morphicresonance, which will not only cause the behavior of the trained animals tobecome increasingly habitual, but will also affect, although less specifically,any similar animal exposed to a similar stimulus: the larger the number ofanimals in the past that have learned the task, the easier it should be forsubsequent similar animals to learn it. Therefore, in an experiment of this typeit should be possible to observe a progressive increase in the rate of learningnot only in animals descended from trained ancestors, but also in geneticallysimilar animals descended from untrained ancestors. This prediction differs fromthat of the Lamarckian theory, according to which only the descendants oftrained animals should learn quicker. And on the conventional theory, thereshould be no increase in the rate of learning of the descendants of untrained ortrained animals. To summarize: An increased rate of learning in successive generations of bothtrained and untrained lines would support the hypothesis of formative causation;an increase only in trained lines, the Lamarckian theory; and an increase inneither, the orthodox theory. Tests of this type have, in fact, already been performed. The results supportthe hypothesis of formative causation. William McDougall started the originalexperiment at Harvard in 1920, in the hope of providing a thorough test of thepossibility of Lamarckian inheritance. The experimental animals were white rats,of the Wistar strain, that had been carefully inbred under laboratory conditionsfor many generations. Their task was to learn to escape from a speciallyconstructed tank of water by swimming to one of two gangways that led out of thewater. The “wrong” gangway was brightly illuminated, while the “right” gangwaywas not. If the rat left by the illuminated gangway, it received an electricshock. The two gangways were illuminated alternately, one on one occasion, theother on the next. The number of errors made by a rat before it learned to leavethe tank by the non-illuminated gangway gave a measure of its rate of learning. > Some of the rats required as many as 330 immersions, involving approximately> half that number of shocks, before they learnt to avoid the bright gangway.> The process of learning was in all cases one that suddenly reached a critical> point. For a long time the animal would show clear evidence of aversion for> the bright gangway, frequently hesitating before it, turning back from it, or> taking it with a desperate rush; but, not having grasped the simple relation> of constant correlation between bright light and shock, he would continue to> take the bright route as often or nearly as often as the other. Then, at last,> would come a point in his training at which he would, if he found himself> facing the bright light, definitely and decisively turn about, seek the other> passage, and quietly climb out by the dim gangway. After attaining this point,> no animal made the error of again taking the bright gangway, or only in very> rare instances.6 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos802486] In each generation, the rats from which the next generation were to be bred wereselected at random before their rate of learning was measured, although matingtook place only after they were tested. This procedure was adopted to avoid anypossibility of conscious or unconscious selection in favor of quicker-learningrats. This experiment was continued for thirty-two generations and took fifteen yearsto complete. In accordance with the Lamarckian theory, there was a markedtendency for rats in successive generations to learn more quickly. This isindicated by the average number of errors made by rats in the first eightgenerations, which was over fifty-six, compared with forty-one, twenty-nine, andtwenty in the second, third, and fourth groups of eight generations,respectively.7 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos802751] The differencewas apparent not only in the quantitative results, but also in the actualbehavior of the rats, which became more cautious and tentative in the latergenerations.8 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos803008] McDougall anticipated the criticism that in spite of his random selection ofparents in each generation, some sort of selection in favor of quicker-learningrats could nevertheless have crept in. In order to test this possibility, hestarted a new experiment, with a different batch of rats, in which parents wereindeed selected on the basis of their learning score. In one series, only quicklearners were bred from in each generation, and in the other series only slowlearners. As expected, the progeny of the quick learners tended to learnrelatively quickly, while the progeny of the slow learners learned relativelyslowly. However, even in the latter series, the performance of the latergenerations improved very markedly, in spite of repeated selection in favor ofslow learning (see figure 29). These experiments were done carefully, and critics were unable to dismiss theresults on the ground of flaws in technique. But they did draw attention to aweakness in the experimental design: McDougall had failed to test systematicallythe change in the rate of learning of rats whose parents had not been trained. One of these critics, Francis Crew, of Edinburgh University, repeatedMcDougall’s experiment with rats derived from the same inbred strain, using atank of similar design. He included a parallel line of “untrained” rats, some ofwhich were tested in each generation for their rate of learning, while others,which were not tested, served as the parents of the next. Over the eighteengenerations of this experiment, Crew found no systematic change in the rate oflearning either in the trained or in the untrained line.9[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos803265] At first, this seemed to castserious doubt on McDougall’s findings. However, Crew’s results were not directlycomparable in three important respects. First, the rats found it much easier tolearn the task in his experiment than in the earlier generations of McDougall’s.So pronounced was this effect that a considerable number of rats in both trainedand untrained lines “learned” the task immediately without receiving a singleshock! The average scores of Crew’s rats right from the beginning were similarto those of McDougall’s after more than thirty generations of training. NeitherCrew nor McDougall was able to provide a satisfactory explanation of thisdiscrepancy. But, as McDougall pointed out, since the purpose of theinvestigation was to bring to light any effect of training on subsequentgenerations, an experiment in which some rats received no training at all andmany others received very little would not be qualified to demonstrate thiseffect.10 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos803529] Second, Crew’sresults showed large and apparently random fluctuations from generation togeneration, far larger than the fluctuations in McDougall’s results, which couldwell have obscured any tendency to improve in the scores of later generations.Third, Crew adopted a policy of very intensive inbreeding, crossing onlybrothers with their sisters in each generation. He had not expected this to haveadverse effects, since the rats came from an inbred stock to start with: “Yetthe history of my stock reads like an experiment in inbreeding. There is a broadbase of family lines and a narrow apex of two remaining lines. The reproductiverate falls and line after line becomes extinct.”11[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos803787] image [images/00033.jpg]Figure 29. The average number of errors in successive generations of ratsselected in each generation for slowness of learning. (Data from McDougall,1938) Even in the surviving lines, a considerable number of animals were born withsuch extreme abnormalities that they had to be discarded. The harmful effects ofthis severe inbreeding could well have masked any tendency for the rate oflearning to improve. Altogether, these defects in Crew’s experiment mean thatthe results can only be regarded as inconclusive; and in fact he himself was ofthe opinion that the question remained open.12[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos804041] Fortunately, this was not the end of the story. Wilfred Agar and his colleaguesat Melbourne University carried out the experiment again, using methods that didnot suffer from the disadvantages of Crew’s. Over a period of twenty years, theymeasured the rates of learning of trained and untrained lines for fiftysuccessive generations. In agreement with McDougall, they found that there was amarked tendency for rats of the trained line to learn more quickly in subsequentgenerations. But exactly the same tendency was also found in the untrainedline.13 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos804259] It might be wondered why McDougall did not also observe a similar effect in hisown untrained lines. The answer is that he did. Although he tested control ratsfrom the original untrained stock only occasionally, he noticed “the disturbingfact that the groups of controls derived from this stock in the years 1926,1927, 1930 and 1932 show a diminution in the average number of errors from 1927to 1932.” He thought this result was probably fortuitous, but added: “It is justpossible that the falling off in the average number of errors from 1927 to 1932represents a real change of constitution of the whole stock, an improvement ofit (with respect to this particular faculty) whose nature I am unable tosuggest.”14 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos804584] With the publication of the final report by Agar’s group in 1954, the prolongedcontroversy over “McDougall’s Lamarckian Experiment” came to an end. The similarimprovement in both trained and untrained lines ruled out a Lamarckianinterpretation. McDougall’s conclusion was refuted, and that seemed to be theend of the matter. On the other hand, his results were confirmed. These results seemed completely inexplicable; they made no sense in terms of anycurrent ideas, and they were never followed up. But they make good sense in thelight of the hypothesis of formative causation. Of course they cannot inthemselves prove the hypothesis; it is always possible to suggest otherexplanations, for example that the successive generations of rats becameincreasingly intelligent for an unknown reason unconnected with theirtraining.15 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos804847] In future experiments, the most unambiguous way of testing for the effects ofmorphic resonance would be to cause large numbers of rats (or any other animals)to learn a new task in one location, and then see if there was an increase inthe rate at which similar rats learned to carry out the same task at anotherlocation hundreds of miles away. The initial rate of learning at both locationsshould be more or less the same. Then, according to the hypothesis of formativecausation, the rate of learning should increase progressively at the locationwhere large numbers are trained; and a similar increase should also bedetectable in the rats at the second location, even though very few rats hadbeen trained there. Obviously, precautions would need to be taken to avoid anypossible conscious or unconscious bias on the part of the experimenters. One waywould be for experimenters at the second location to test the rate of learningof rats in several different tasks, at regular intervals, say monthly. Then atthe first location, the particular task in which thousands of rats would betrained would be chosen at random from this set. Moreover, the time at which thetraining began would also be selected at random; it might, for example, be fourmonths after the regular tests began at the second location. The experimentersat the second location would not be told either which task had been selected orwhen the training had begun at the first location. If, under these conditions, amarked increase in the rate of learning in the selected task were detected atthe second location after the training had begun at the first, then this resultwould provide strong evidence in favor of the hypothesis of formative causation. An effect of this type might well have occurred when Crew and Agar’s grouprepeated McDougall’s work. In both cases, their rats started off learning thetask considerably quicker than McDougall’s when he first began his experiment.16[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos806572] If this experiment gave positive results, it would not be fully reproducible byits very nature: in attempts to repeat it, the rats would be influenced bymorphic resonance from the rats in the original experiment. To demonstrate thesame effect again and again, it would be necessary to change either the task orthe species used in each experiment. 11.3 The evolution of behavior Whereas the fossil record provides direct evidence about the structure of pastanimals, it reveals practically nothing about their behavior. Consequently, mostideas about the evolution of behavior cannot be based on evidence from the past,but only on comparisons between living species today. Thus, for example,theories can be constructed about the evolution of social behavior in bees bycomparing existing social species with solitary and colonial species, which arepresumed to be more primitive. But however reasonable such theories may seem,they can never be more than speculative.17[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos807644] Moreover, theories ofbehavioral evolution depend on assumptions about the way in which behavior isinherited, since so little is actually known. The neo-Darwinian theory assumes that innate behavior is “programmed” or “coded”in the DNA, and that new types of behavior are caused by chance mutations. Thennatural selection favors favorable mutants; hence instincts evolve. Chancemutations are also assumed to give animals capacities for particular types oflearning. Then animals whose survival and reproduction benefit from thesecapacities are favored by natural selection. Hence capacities for learningevolve. Even a tendency for learned behavior to become innate can be attributedto chance mutations, by the hypothetical Baldwin effect: animals may respond tonew situations by learning to behave in appropriate ways; chance mutations thatcause this behavior to appear without the need for learning will be favored bynatural selection; hence behavior that was at first learned may become innate,not because of an inheritance of acquired characteristics, but becauseappropriate mutations happen by chance and are selected for. There seems to be practically no limit to what can be accounted for by theinvocation of favorable chance mutations that change the “genetic programming”of behavior. These neo-Darwinian theories can be developed in a mathematicalform by calculations based on the formulae of theoretical population genetics.18[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos807839] But insofar as thesespeculations are untestable, they have no independent value; they merelyelaborate the mechanistic assumptions from which they start. The hypothesis of formative causation leads to very different interpretations ofthe evolution of behavior. To the extent that genetic changes influencebehavior, natural selection would still be expected to lead to alterations inthe gene pools of populations. But the specific patterns of behavior themselvesdepend on the inheritance of behavioral fields by morphic resonance. The more agiven pattern of behavior is repeated, the stronger will this resonance become.Thus the repetition of instinctive behavior will tend to fix the instincts moreand more. On the other hand, if patterns of behavior vary from individual toindividual, morphic resonance will not produce well-defined chreodes; hence thebehavior will be less stereotyped. The greater the variety of behavior, thegreater will be the scope for variation in future generations. This kind ofevolution permitting the emergence of intelligence has taken place to someextent among the birds, more so in the mammals, and most of all in humans. In some cases, behavior that is semi-learned may have evolved from a backgroundin which it was fully instinctive. One way in which this could have happened isthrough the hybridization of races with different chreodes, giving rise tocomposite motor fields with more scope for individual variation. Conversely, semi-instinctive behavior could have evolved from behavior that wasoriginally learned, as a result of frequent repetition. Consider, for example,the behavior of different breeds of dog. Sheepdogs have been trained andselected over many generations for the ability to round up sheep, retrievers toretrieve, pointers to point, fox hounds to chase foxes, and so on. Dogs oftenshow an innate tendency toward the behavior characteristic of their breed evenbefore they are trained.19 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos808113]Perhaps these tendencies are not quite strong enough to be called instincts, butthey are strong enough to show that there is only a difference of degree betweeninstinct and a hereditary predisposition to learn particular types of behavior.Of course, breeds of dogs have evolved under conditions of artificial ratherthan natural selection, but the same principles apply in both cases. While it is relatively easy to imagine how some types of instinctive behaviorcould have developed by the repetition of learned behavior generation aftergeneration, this cannot feasibly account for the evolution of all types ofinstinct, especially in animals with a very limited capacity for learning.Possibly some new instincts emerged from new permutations and combinations ofpreexisting instincts; one way in which this could occur would be throughhybridization between races or species with different patterns of behavior.Another way in which new combinations might come about is through theincorporation of “displacement activities,” the seemingly irrelevant actionsperformed by animals “torn” between conflicting instincts. Certain elements ofcourtship rituals may well have originated in this way.20[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos808339] It is also conceivable thatmutations or exposure to unusual environments could enable an animal to tune into other species’ motor chreodes (section 8.6). But in addition to the recombination of existing chreodes, there must be someway in which entirely new motor fields come into being in animals whose behavioris almost entirely instinctive. New patterns of behavior could emerge only ifthe usual repetition of ancestral behavior was blocked, either by a change inthe environment or by a mutation that altered the normal physiology ormorphogenesis of the animal. In most such cases the animal might act in anuncoordinated and ineffective manner, but occasionally a new motor field mightcome into being. And whenever a new field appears for the first time, there mustbe a jump that cannot be fully accounted for in terms of preceding energetic orformative causes (sections 5.1, 8.7). If the pattern of behavior due to a new behavioral field impairs the ability ofanimals to survive and reproduce, it will not be repeated very often; animalsthat persist in this behavior will be eliminated by natural selection. But ifthe new pattern of behavior helps animals to survive and reproduce, it will tendto be repeated and reinforced by morphic resonance. 11.4 Human behavior Higher animals often behave more flexibly than do lower animals. However, thisflexibility is confined to the early stages of a behavioral sequence, andespecially to the initial appetitive phase; the later stages, and in particularthe final stage, the consummatory act, are performed in a stereotyped manner asfixed action patterns (section 10.1). In terms of the landscape model, a major motor field can be represented by abroad valley, which then narrows down and becomes increasingly steep-walled,finally ending up in a deep canyon (figure 28B). The broad valley corresponds tothe appetitive phase, in which many alternative pathways can be followed; thesepathways then converge as they are funneled toward the final highly canalizedchreode of the consummatory act. In human behavior the ranges of ways in which behavioral goals are reached arefar wider than in any other species, but the same principles seem to apply:under the influence of the higher-level behavioral fields, patterns of actionare funneled toward stereotyped consummatory acts that are generally innate. Forexample, people obtain their food by all sorts of different methods, eitherdirectly by hunting, gathering, fishing, herding, or farming, or earn itindirectly by performing various tasks or jobs. Then the food is prepared andcooked in many different ways, and placed in the mouth by a variety of means,for instance by hand, or with chopsticks, or on a spoon. But there is littledifference in the way the food is chewed, and the consummatory act of the wholemotor field of feeding, swallowing, is similar in all people. Likewise, in thebehavior governed by the motor field of reproduction, methods of courtship andsystems of marriage differ widely, but the consummatory act of copulation towardwhich they lead is more or less stereotyped. In the male, the final fixed actionpattern, that of ejaculation, proceeds automatically, and is in fact innate. Thus the very varied patterns of human behavior are usually directed toward alimited number of goals given by the motor fields inherited from past members ofthe species by morphic resonance; in general, these goals are related to thedevelopment, maintenance, or reproduction of the individual or social group.Even play and exploratory activity not immediately directed toward such goalsoften help achieve them later on, as they do in other species, for neither playnor “generalized exploratory appetitive behavior” in the absence of immediatereward is confined to humans: rats, for example, explore their environment andinvestigate objects even when they are satiated.21[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos808557] However, not all human activity is subordinated to the motor fields thatcanalize it toward biological or social goals; some is explicitly directedtoward transcendent ends. This kind of behavior is shown in its purest form inthe lives of saints. Although the range of variation in human behavior is very wide when the speciesas a whole is considered, in any given society the activities of individualstend to fall into a limited number of standard patterns. People usually repeatcharacteristically structured activities that have already been performed overand over again by many generations of their predecessors. These include thespeaking of a particular language; the skills associated with hunting, farming,weaving, tool-making, cooking, and so on; songs and dances; and the types ofbehavior specific to particular social roles. All of these can be thought of asmorphic fields. Richard Dawkins coined the word meme to refer to “a unit of culturaltransmission, or a unit of imitation.”22[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos808924] He deliberately chose a wordthat sounded rather like gene to stress the analogy between genes and memes asreplicators. But one of the problems with this term is that it is atomistic: itimplies that memes are independent units, at the same level as each other. Bycontrast, thinking of cultural inheritance in terms of morphic fields has nosuch implication: morphic fields are organized in nested hierarchies (figure10).23 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos809129] All the patterns of activity characteristic of a given culture can be regardedas morphic fields. The more often they are repeated, the more stronglystabilized they will be. But because of the bewildering variety ofculture-specific morphic fields, each of which could potentially canalize themovements of any human being, morphic resonance cannot by itself lead anindividual into one set of chreodes rather than another. So none of thesepatterns of behavior expresses itself spontaneously: all have to be learned. Anindividual is initiated into particular patterns of behavior by other members ofthe society. Then as the process of learning begins, usually by imitation, theperformance of a characteristic pattern of behavior brings the individual intomorphic resonance with all those who have carried out this pattern in the past.Consequently, learning is facilitated as the individual “tunes in” to specificmorphic fields.24 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos809570] Processes of initiation are indeed traditionally understood in terms rathersimilar to these. Individuals are thought to enter into states or modes ofexistence that precede them and have a transpersonal reality. The facilitationof learning by morphic resonance would be difficult to demonstrate empiricallyin the case of long-established patterns of behavior, but a change in the rateof learning should be more readily detectable with motor patterns of recentorigin. Thus, for example, it should have become progressively easier to learnto ride a bicycle, drive a car, ski, or play a video game, owing to thecumulative morphic resonance from the large number of people who have alreadyacquired these skills. However, even if reliable quantitative data showed thatthe rates of learning had in fact increased, the interpretation would becomplicated by the probable influence of other factors like improved machinedesign, better teaching methods, and a higher motivation to learn. But withspecially designed experiments in which precautions are taken to hold theseother factors constant, it might well be possible to obtain persuasive evidencefor the predicted effects. Recent experimental research on morphic resonance inhuman learning is summarized in appendix A. The hypothesis of formative causation applies to all aspects of human behaviorin which particular patterns of movement are repeated. But it cannot account forthe origin of these patterns in the first place. Here, as elsewhere, the problemof creativity lies outside the scope of natural science, and an answer can begiven only on metaphysical grounds (sections 5.1, 8.7, and 11.3). "},{"pageContent":"12 image [images/00003.jpg] FOUR POSSIBLE CONCLUSIONS 12.1 The hypothesis of formative causation The hypothesis of formative causation is a testable hypothesis about objectivelyobservable regularities of nature. It cannot explain the origination of newforms and new patterns of behavior, nor can it explain subjective experience.Such explanations can be given only by theories of reality more far-reachingthan those of natural science, in other words by metaphysical theories. At present, scientific and metaphysical questions are frequently confused witheach other because of the close connection between the mechanistic theory oflife and the metaphysical theory of materialism. The latter would still bedefensible if the mechanistic theory were to be superseded within biology by thehypothesis of formative causation, or indeed by any other hypothesis. But itwould lose its privileged position; it would have to enter into free competitionwith other metaphysical theories. In order to illustrate the important distinction between the realms of scienceand of metaphysics, in the following sections four different metaphysicaltheories are briefly outlined. All four are compatible with the hypothesis offormative causation. From the point of view of natural science, the choice amongthem is open. 12.2 Modified materialism Materialism starts from the assumption that only matter is real; henceeverything that exists is either matter or entirely dependent upon matter forits existence. However, the concept of matter has no fixed meaning: in the lightof modern physics, it has already been extended to include physical fields, andmaterial particles have come to be regarded as forms of energy. The philosophyof materialism has been modified accordingly, and is sometimes calledphysicalism to reflect this change. Morphic fields are associated with material systems; they too can be regarded asaspects of matter (section 3.5). Thus materialism or physicalism could befurther modified to incorporate the idea of formative causation.1[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos809987] In the following discussion,this new form of the materialist philosophy will be referred to as “modifiedmaterialism.” Materialism denies a priori the existence of any nonmaterial causal agency; thephysical world is causally closed. Hence there can be no such thing as anonmaterial self that acts upon the body, as there seems to be from a subjectivepoint of view. Rather, conscious experience is either in some sense the samething as material states of the brain or it simply runs parallel to these stateswithout affecting them.2 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos810500] Butwhereas in conventional materialism brain states are determined by a combinationof energetic causation and chance events, in modified materialism they are, inaddition, determined by formative causation. Indeed, conscious experience wouldprobably best be thought of as an aspect or epiphenomenon of the morphic fieldsacting on the brain. The subjective experience of free will cannot, ex hypothesi, correspond to thecausal influence of a nonmaterial self upon the body. However, it is conceivablethat some of the random events within the brain might be subjectivelyexperienced as free choices; but this apparent freedom is nothing but an aspector epiphenomenon of the chance activation of one morphic field rather thananother. If all conscious experience is simply an accompaniment of, or runs parallel to,the morphic fields acting upon the brain, then conscious memory, like the memoryof habits (section 10.1), must depend on morphic resonance from past states ofthe brain. Neither conscious nor unconscious memories would be stored within thebrain. In the context of conventional materialism, the evidence for parapsychologicalphenomena can only be denied, ignored, or explained away. But modifiedmaterialism permits a more positive attitude. In particular, it is possible toformulate an explanation of telepathy in terms of morphic fields,3[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos810843] and of psychokinesis in termsof the modification of probabilistic events within objects under the influenceof behavioral fields.4 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos811521] The origin of new forms, new patterns of behavior, and new ideas cannot beexplained in terms of preexisting energetic and formative causes (sections 5.1,8.7, 11.3, and 11.4). Moreover, materialism denies the existence of anynonmaterial creative agency that could have given rise to them. Hence they haveno cause. Their origin must therefore be attributed to chance, and evolution canbe seen only in terms of the interplay of chance and physical necessity. In summary, according to modified materialism, conscious experience is either anaspect of or runs parallel to the morphic fields acting on the brain. All humancreativity, like evolutionary creativity, must ultimately be ascribed to chance.Human beings adopt their beliefs (including the belief in materialism) and carryout their actions as a result of chance events and physical necessities withintheir brains. Human life has no purpose beyond the satisfaction of biologicaland social needs; nor has the evolution of life, nor the universe as a whole,any purpose or direction. 12.3 The conscious self Contrary to the philosophy of materialism, the conscious self can be admitted tohave a reality that is not merely derivative from matter. One can accept, ratherthan deny, that one’s own conscious self has the capacity to make free choices.Then, by analogy, other people can also be assumed to be conscious beings with asimilar capacity. This “common sense” view leads to the conclusion that the conscious self and thebody interact. But then how does this interaction take place? In the context of the mechanistic theory of life, the conscious self can only bea kind of “ghost in the machine.”5[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos812173] To materialists this notionseems inherently absurd. And even the defenders of the interactionist positionhave been unable to specify how the interaction takes place, beyond thesuggestion that it might somehow depend on a modification of quantum eventswithin the brain.6 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos812359] The hypothesis of formative causation enables this long-standing problem to beseen in a new light. The conscious self can be thought of as interacting notwith a machine, but with morphic fields. These morphic fields are associatedwith the body and depend on its physical and chemical states. But the self isneither the same as the morphic fields nor does its experience simply parallelthe changes brought about within the brain by energetic and formative causation.It “enters into” the morphic fields, but it remains over and above them. Through these fields, the conscious self is closely connected with the externalenvironment and with the states of the body in perception and in consciouslycontrolled activity. Subjective experience that is not directly concerned withthe present environment or with immediate action—for example, in dreams,reveries, and discursive thinking—need not necessarily bear any particularlyclose relationship to the energetic and formative causes acting on the brain. At first sight, this conclusion might appear to contradict the evidence showingthat states of consciousness are often associated with characteristicphysiological activities. Dreams, for instance, tend to be accompanied by rapideye movements and by electrical rhythms of particular frequencies within thebrain.7 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos813109] But such evidence doesnot prove that the specific details of the dreams run parallel to thesephysiological changes: the latter could simply be a nonspecific consequence ofthe entry of consciousness into the dream state. This point is easier to grasp with the help of an analogy. Consider theinteraction between a car and its driver. Under certain conditions, when the caris actually being driven, its movements are closely connected with the actionsof the driver, and depend on his perceptions of the road ahead, road signs,dials indicating the internal state of the car, and so on. But under otherconditions, this connection is less close: for example, when the car isstationary with its engine turning over, the driver might be looking at a map.Although there would be a general relationship between the state of the car andwhat he was doing—he could not read when driving—there would be no specificconnections between the vibrations of the engine and the features of the map hewas studying. Likewise the rhythmical electrical activity in the brain need bearno specific relationship to the images experienced in dreams. Granted that the self has properties of its own, how does it act upon the bodyand the external world through morphic fields? There are two ways in which itcould do so: first, by selecting between different possible morphic fields,causing one course of action to be adopted rather than another; and second, byserving as a creative agency through which new morphic fields come into being,for example in “insight” learning (section 10.4). In both cases it would actlike a formative cause, but one that is, within limits, free and undeterminedfrom the point of view of physical causation. It could indeed be thought of as aformative cause of formative causes. On this interpretation, consciously controlled actions depend on three kinds ofcausation: conscious causation, formative causation, and energetic causation. Bycontrast, traditional interactionist theories, of the “ghost in the machine”type, admit only two, conscious and energetic causation, with no formativecausation in between. Modified materialism admits a different two, formative andenergetic, and denies the existence of conscious causation. And conventionalmaterialism admits only one: energetic causation.8[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos813336] In the lower animals, the strong canalization of instinctive patterns ofbehavior probably leaves little or no room for conscious causation; but amongthe higher animals, the relatively weak innate canalization of appetitivebehavior may well provide a limited scope. In humans, the enormous range ofpossible actions gives rise to many ambiguous situations in which consciouschoices can be made, both at lower levels, between possible methods of reachinggoals already given by higher-level morphic fields, and at higher levels,between competing morphic fields. On this view, consciousness is directed primarily toward the choice betweenpossible actions, and its evolution has been intimately connected with theincreasing scope of conscious causation. At an early stage in human evolution, this scope must have increased enormouslywith the development of language, both directly through the capacity to producean indefinite number of patterns of sounds in the speaking of phrases andsentences and indirectly through all those actions made possible by thisdetailed and flexible means of communication. In the associated development ofconceptual thought, the conscious self must at some stage, in a qualitativeleap, have become aware of itself as the agent of conscious causation. Although conscious creativity reaches its highest development in the humanspecies, it probably also plays an important part in the development of newpatterns of behavior in the higher animals, and may even be of some significancein the lower animals. But conscious causation takes place only within alreadyestablished frameworks of formative causation given by morphic resonance frompast animals; it cannot account for the behavioral fields in the context ofwhich it is expressed, nor can it be regarded as a cause of the characteristicform of the species. Still less can it help to explain the origin of new formsin the plant kingdom. So the problem of evolutionary creativity remainsunsolved. The reality of the conscious self as a source of creativity can be admitted, butthe existence of any creative agency transcending individual organisms can bedenied. All other forms of creativity can be ascribed to chance. To go furtherinvolves admitting sources of creativity that transcend individual organisms, asdiscussed below. 12.4 The creative universe Although a creative agency capable of giving rise to new forms and new patternsof behavior in the course of evolution would necessarily transcend individualorganisms, it need not transcend all nature. It could, for instance, be immanentwithin life as a whole; in this case it would correspond to what Henri Bergsoncalled the élan vital,9 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos814331] orvital impetus. Or it could be immanent within the planet as a whole, or thesolar system, or the entire universe. There could indeed be a hierarchy ofimmanent creativities at all these levels. Such creative agencies could give rise to new morphic fields by a kind ofcausation very similar to the conscious causation considered above. In fact, ifsuch creative agencies are admitted at all, then it is difficult to avoid theconclusion that they must in some sense be conscious selves. If such a hierarchy of conscious selves exists, then those at higher levelsmight well express their creativity through those at lower levels. And if such ahigher-level creative agency acted through human consciousness, the thoughts andactions to which it gave rise might actually be experienced as coming from anexternal source. This experience of inspiration is in fact well known. Moreover, if such “higher selves” are immanent within nature, then it isconceivable that under certain conditions human beings might become directlyaware that they were embraced or included within them. And in fact theexperience of an inner unity with life, or the Earth, or the universe, has oftenbeen described, to the extent that it is expressible. But although an immanent hierarchy of conscious selves might account forevolutionary creativity within the universe, it could not possibly have givenrise to the universe in the first place. Nor could this immanent creativity haveany goal if there were nothing beyond the universe toward which it could move.So the whole of nature would be evolving continuously, but blindly and withoutdirection. This metaphysical position admits the causal efficacy of the conscious self, andthe existence of creative agencies transcending individual organisms, butimmanent within nature. However, it denies the existence of any ultimatecreative agency transcending the universe as a whole. 12.5 Transcendent reality The universe as a whole could have a cause and a purpose only if it were itselfcreated by a conscious agent that transcended it. If this transcendent conscious being were the source of the universe and ofeverything within it, all created things would in some sense participate in itsnature. The more or less limited “wholeness” of organisms at all levels ofcomplexity could then be seen as a reflection of the transcendent unity on whichthey depended, and from which they were ultimately derived. Thus this fourth metaphysical position affirms the causal efficacy of theconscious self, and the existence of a hierarchy of creative agencies immanentwithin nature, and the reality of a transcendent source of the universe. "},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX A image [images/00003.jpg] NEW TESTS FOR MORPHIC RESONANCE There are two approaches to testing the hypothesis of formative causation:first, through morphic fields, which connect together parts of a morphic unit inspace; second, through morphic resonance and its cumulative influence in time.Research on the spatial aspect of morphic fields has been concerned mainly withsocial and perceptual fields. I have summarized the findings in my books SevenExperiments That Could Change the World, Dogs That Know When Their Owners AreComing Home, and The Sense of Being Stared At.1[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos814671] The full texts of my scientificpapers on these subjects, published in peer-reviewed journals, are available onmy website, www.sheldrake.org [http://www.sheldrake.org.] In this appendix, I suggest a range of new tests for morphic resonance itself.When new morphic fields first come into being, they are weak. They are notstabilized by morphic resonance from similar past systems. The more frequently amorphic process occurs, the greater the morphic resonance, the stronger themorphic field, and the more compelling the force of habit. As morphic resonanceincreases, morphic processes become faster, and morphic fields more stable.These predictions of the hypothesis of formative causation are testable in awide range of systems, ranging from low-temperature physics to human learning. A.1 Bose-Einstein condensates When morphic units have occurred for billions of years and been repeatedinnumerable times, no changes in the rate of their formation will be detectable.Nor will their stability change. Their habits are fixed. For example, theformation of hydrogen atoms, methane molecules, and sodium chloride crystalswill not show any measurable changes. In order to detect morphic resonance, itis necessary to study new self-organizing systems. In the realm of physics, what processes observable here on Earth are unlikelyever to have occurred anywhere else in the universe? Phenomena at very lowtemperatures. The background temperature of the universe, as revealed by the cosmic backgroundmicrowave radiation, is 2.7°K, or in other words 2.7 degrees C above absolutezero. But in laboratories, it is now possible to cool systems to less than 1°Cabove absolute zero, far colder than the rest of the universe, as far as weknow. At these ultra-low temperatures, physical systems behave very strangely. The best-known low temperature phenomenon is the formation of Bose-Einsteincondensates, a new state of matter, over and above the familiar solid, liquid,gas, and plasma states. Satyendranath Bose and Albert Einstein first predictedthe existence of these condensates in 1927. The first to be investigated washelium-4 in 1938. When cooled to 2.17°K, it became a superfluid, flowing withoutfriction. The first “pure” Bose-Einstein condensate was made in 1995, withrubidium-87. Such condensates have many strange properties and are effectivelysuperatoms, groups of atoms that behave as one. Presumably Bose-Einstein condensates made in modern physics laboratories areentirely new to nature, and have never occurred before in the history of theuniverse (unless they have been made in physics laboratories by aliens on otherplanets). Since they behave as unified wholes, they may be a point at whichquantum fields and morphic fields converge. If Bose-Einstein condensates are indeed organized by morphic fields, then themore often a given kind of condensate is made in a laboratory, the easier itshould be to make it under similar conditions all over the world, and the morestable it should be. To test for morphic resonance, a new kind of condensate is prepared, and thenmade again repeatedly under standard conditions. The rate at which it forms ismonitored. If morphic resonance is at work, the condensate will form morereadily the more often this process is repeated, and the stability of thecondensate will increase. A.2 Melting points As discussed in chapter 5, morphic resonance should lead to an increased rate ofcrystallization the more often a compound is crystallized. Through resonancefrom previous similar crystals, the field of any particular type of crystalshould be strengthened. An increase in morphic field strength should also cause crystals to be morestable; it should be harder to destroy them. Crystals break up when they areheated to their melting point. Morphic resonance should cause the melting pointsof new kinds of crystals to increase. This is a shocking prediction. Melting points are called “physical constants”because they are supposed not to change. Although they are affected by a numberof variables, such as atmospheric pressure and the presence of impurities, it isgenerally taken for granted that pure samples of a given substance at standardatmospheric pressure have the same melting point at all times and in all places.Everyone knows that the melting point of ice is, always has been, and alwayswill be 0°C. Weighty handbooks of physical constants list the melting points ofmany thousands of substances. Few aspects of science seem more certain. Havingstudied chemistry, I too used to take the constancy of melting points forgranted. After the first edition of this book was published, I gave a seminar on morphicresonance in the Chemistry Department of the University of Vermont in which Idiscussed the increasing rates of crystallization of new compounds. A chemistpointed out to me that if morphic fields of crystals grew stronger by morphicresonance, then melting points should also rise. He was right. I began toinvestigate whether this really happened. I started by asking several synthetic chemists if they had ever noticed atendency for the melting points of new substances to increase. Yes, they had;this seemed to be a common observation. But they had a ready explanation: astime goes on, chemists’ skills improve. Impurities reduce melting points, andtherefore melting points rise as chemists make purer samples. I asked, “How wecan be sure that the later samples were in fact purer?” The usual answer was:“They must be purer because they have higher melting points.” The argument wasreasonable, but circular. I then looked up the melting points of a wide range of organic chemicals inearly-, mid-and late-twentieth-century handbooks and chemical journals. My aimwas to compare the melting points of compounds that have crystallized in naturefor millions of years with those of compounds that first crystallized inlaboratories. If there is a general tendency for chemists’ samples to be purer,then both kinds of crystals should show similar increases in their meltingpoints. But if melting points are influenced by morphic resonance, only themelting points of recently crystallized substances would be expected to rise.Compounds that crystallize under natural conditions should not show thistendency, for two reasons. First, there are likely to be limits beyond which melting points can increase nomore. Other factors become limiting. This is true of all processes. For example,after Roger Bannister first ran a four-minute mile in 1954, speeds havecontinued to increase; the current record is 3 minutes 43 seconds. But it isvery unlikely that records would keep being broken until the mile is run in 3minutes, or 1 minute, or 1 second. Other factors become limiting—the muscularsystem, the ability of the heart to pump enough blood, and even friction—a pointwould come at which the athletes’ jockstraps burst into flames. In general,morphic resonance would be expected to lead to changes that reach limits. Andthis would be as true of melting points as of everything else. Second, there will be so much morphic resonance from past crystals that nofurther change will be observable. Against a background of resonance fromquadrillions of past crystals, the resonance from a few thousand more makes nodetectable difference. Obviously the melting points in handbooks are based on reports in the chemicalliterature that predate the handbooks themselves, and melting points in oneedition of a handbook are often copied into the next edition, or copied fromother handbooks. Hence the dating of changes in melting points is not precise,and the value quoted in a given handbook could refer to a determination carriedout years or even decades earlier.2[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos815199] Nevertheless, the handbooks areupdated from time to time, and new melting points substituted for old ones. The most up-to-date melting points are to be found in chemical catalogs. Iconcentrated on the Aldrich Chemical Company’s Catalogue Handbook of FineChemicals. In many cases, the Aldrich melting points were higher than in thestandard reference books in libraries. But how reliable were the Aldrich values?In 1991, I purchased samples of forty different chemicals from Aldrich andarranged for their melting points to be measured in the Materials Department ofImperial College of Science and Technology, University of London.3[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos815699] The values were in closeagreement with the company’s claims, usually with differences of less than oneor two degrees C. Thus the melting points in the Aldrich catalog seemed to be areliable guide to contemporary values. Many increases in melting points over the course of the twentieth century weregreater than five degrees. For example, saccharin, the oldest artificialsweetener, was first synthesized in 1878. In 1902, its melting point was 220°C.By 1996 it was 229°C—a nine-degree increase. Phenolphthalein, used in chemistrylaboratories as an indicator of acidity, was first made in 1880. In 1907 itsmelting point was 252°C; in 1989 it was 262°C—a ten-degree increase. The crownethers are a family of crown-shaped molecules used as chelating agents, firstsynthesized in 1976. The most widely used member of the family, 18-crown-6,started with a melting point of 39°C. By 1989, it was 45°C—a six-degreeincrease. Other compounds with rising melting points were chemicals naturally occurring inliving organisms, but too dilute to crystallize in nature. Although thechemicals themselves have existed for many millions, even billions, of years,they probably crystallized for the first time when they were isolated andconcentrated in laboratories from the nineteenth century onward. For exampleadrenaline, first isolated in 1895, had a melting point of 201°C in 1901. By1989 it was 215°C—a fourteen-degree increase. Cortisone, isolated in the 1930sfrom the adrenal cortex, had a melting point of 205°C in 1936; in 1989 it was225°C—a twenty-degree rise. In the course of this research I found one glaring anomaly: vitamin B2, alsoknown as riboflavin, crystallizes in nature, for example, in the eyes of lemurs,and also in some fungal cells.4 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos816195]Riboflavin crystals should therefore show little or no change in melting point.Yet there was an increase from 275°C in 1940 to 290°C in contemporary samples.However, the 1940 figure, taken from the fifth edition of the Merck Index, wasonly one of a range of melting points, from 271°C to 293°C, reported between the1930s and 1950s.5 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos816468] Thisconfusing variability may have a simple explanation: riboflavin is now known tohave three different crystal forms with different melting points.6[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos816693] In my survey of a wide range of chemicals, I found some with constant meltingpoints and others whose melting points increased. Very few went down. In theearly 1990s, I corresponded with the editor of one of the leading handbooks toask whether he had ever studied the pattern of change from edition to edition.He had not. He was surprised by the widespread tendency for melting points to goup, having assumed that any changes would be a result of random errors, equallylikely to go up or down. But this was not the case. Figure A.1 compares the historical melting points of compounds that have beencrystallizing in nature for millions of years with chemical derivatives of thesecompounds that did not exist until the nineteenth or twentieth century. Salicinis found in the bark of willows, poplars, and in other plants and has been usedmedicinally since the time of the ancient Greeks. It was first isolated in 1827.Its chemical derivative acetylsalicylic acid, also known as aspirin, was firstsynthesized in 1853. Aspirin was introduced into medical practice in 1899 andsubsequently became one of the world’s most popular drugs, with an annualconsumption of around 50,000 tons.7[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos816880] The melting point of salicinwas constant throughout the twentieth century, while the melting point ofaspirin increased by eight degrees C. image [images/00034.jpg]Figure A.1. Changes in melting points over time in natural compounds (left) andrelated synthetic compounds (right). Penicillic acid is excreted naturally by several species of fungi in the genusPenicillium, and was first isolated and identified in 1913, years before thediscovery of the antibiotic properties of penicillin in 1929. A range of relatedcompounds were isolated and synthesized in the 1940s.8[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos817103] One of them wasD-penicillamine, a breakdown product of penicillin antibiotics, which is usedtherapeutically as an antirheumatic drug. The melting point of penicillic acidhas remained more or less constant, whereas that of D-penicillamine hasincreased by twenty degrees C. Cocaine occurs in the leaves of coca plants at a concentration of up to 1percent.9 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos817365] Presumably, overmillions of years it has often crystallized as leaves dried up. By contrast,cocaine hydrochloride, the cocaine of commerce, is new; it is produced bytreating coca-leaf extracts with hydrochloric acid. The melting point of cocainehas remained constant, whereas that of cocaine hydrochloride has increased bythirteen degrees C. In 1997, a Dutch Skeptical organization, Stichting Skepsis, wrote to mechallenging my observations about changes in melting points. I sent them mydata. They checked the literature and came up with very similar values. Theyconceded that some melting points had indeed increased, but then fell back onthe argument that these increases must have been due to improvements in purityrather than to morphic resonance. They had no evidence to support theirassumption. In an article they wrote in the Skeptical Inquirer, they simplyasserted, “There is no other explanation.”10[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos817567] Much more research could be done on the history of melting points. I havesurveyed only a small part of the huge chemical literature. But unfortunatelythese records do not usually include any information on purity, and thereforethis historical evidence can never be conclusive. The only way forward is to dospecial tests. Here is an example. Take six new chemicals recently made in a university orchemical company. Crystallize all six and measure their melting points. Storethe samples in a refrigerator. Now, in another laboratory, make one of thesechemicals, selected at random, in large quantities, and crystallize itrepeatedly. This should lead to an increase in the melting point of thisparticular compound, but not of the other five. In the first laboratory, nowmeasure the melting points of all six samples again. Does the melting point ofthe test sample increase? Do the melting points of the other five samples staythe same? A.3 Crystal transformations Many chemical substances take more than one crystalline form. The best-knownexamples are the alternative forms of chemical elements, called allotropes.Graphite and diamond are both crystalline forms of carbon, with the atoms bondedtogether as a hexagonal lattice in graphite and as a tetrahedral lattice indiamond. Graphite can be transformed into diamond at high temperature andpressure, which is how artificial diamonds are made. Tin has a gray allotropewith a cubic crystal structure and no metallic properties. When heated above13.2°C, it changes into white tin, which is metallic and has a tetragonallattice structure. Other elements with allotropic crystal forms are sulfur,phosphorus, and plutonium. The crystals of many salts and molecules also exist in alternative forms, whichare called polymorphs rather than allotropes. For example, calcium carbonateoccurs in rocks as calcite or aragonite. Aragonite is more soluble, and occursas small crystals within basalts, and also in the shells of mollusks. Calcite isfound in sedimentary rocks, such as limestone, in Iceland spar crystals, and inthe shells of bivalves such as oysters. Aragonite changes to calcite when heatedto 470°C. Potassium nitrate also exists in two alternative forms similar to calcite andaragonite. The aragonite type changes to the calcite type at 127.5°C. Thetransition has been studied in detail in single crystals slowly heated up andthen cooled down while being observed continuously by means of light reflectedby the crystals: the polymorphs have different reflection patterns. Thearagonite-type crystals took several minutes just above the transitiontemperature to transform into calcite. When the calcite crystals were cooleddown again, the original aragonite structure was restored within a few minutesin surprising detail, with the atoms lined up in the same way they had been inthe original crystal, leading the investigators to conclude there was a “memoryeffect.”11 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos818110] Transformations between polymorphs also occur in many crystals of organicchemicals. For example, a sulfur-containing compound calledN-methyl-1-thia-5-azoniacyclooctane-1-oxide perchlorate (NMTAOP) has twopolymorphs, alpha and beta, with a transition temperature of 17°C. In studieswith single crystals, when the alpha form was warmed to a few degrees above17°C, it changed to the beta form in a few minutes, as measured by the opticalproperties of the crystals. The reverse transformation occurred when the betaform was cooled to 14°C, but took several days to go to completion. Thistransformation cycle could be repeated over and over again.12[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos818439] Just as the crystallization of a compound from solution should occur morereadily the more often this process is repeated (as discussed in section 5.6),so should the transformation of one polymorph to another occur more readily themore often this polymorph has formed. Hence, crystal transformations couldprovide a way of testing for morphic resonance. The transformations need to be monitored continuously, either through opticalproperties, as in the examples of potassium nitrate and NMTAOP, or by othermeans: some crystals change color as they transform, while in other cases theirelectrical or magnetic properties change.13[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos818711] The transformations can bebrought about by heating or cooling, or by applying high pressure, or by bothcombined. Do the transformations occur more rapidly under standard conditionsthe more often a new polymorph is made? As in the case of melting points, it is important to choose synthetic compoundsfor this study. Changes would not be expected in the rate of transformation ofnaturally occurring polymorphs like calcite and aragonite, because they haveexisted naturally for millions of years; transformations under high pressure andtemperature have often occurred within the Earth’s crust through geologicalprocesses. Fortunately, there are plenty of synthetic organic compounds thathave never existed in nature, as far as we know, and whose polymorphs are ofrecent origin. A.4 Adaptations in cell cultures Plant and animal cells can be grown outside the organisms they come from, andsome can be propagated in cell cultures within laboratory glassware for years.Through morphic resonance, if some cells from the culture adapt to a newchallenge, similar cells should be able to adapt to the same challenge morerapidly even when they are separated. There is already evidence that such an effect takes place. Miroslav Hill, a cellbiologist, made a very surprising discovery in the 1980s when he was director ofresearch at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Villejuif,France. Cells seemed to be influencing other similar cells at a distance. Hill and his colleagues were working with cell cultures derived from hamsters.They were trying to find mutant cells resistant to thioguanine, a toxin. Thestandard procedure was to expose cells to the poison and see if any survived asa result of rare random mutations enabling them to resist it. None did. At this stage the normal procedure would have been to expose the cells tomutation-causing chemicals in order to increase the number of random mutationsand then try again. The conventional assumption is that mutations take place atrandom; they have nothing to do with adaptation to the environment. Instead,Hill’s group decided to follow a trick of the trade of laboratory technicians,not mentioned in official laboratory manuals. Instead of testing large numbersof cells at a single time to find rare mutants resistant to attack, thetechnicians tested successive generations of cells. At regular intervals theyroutinely subcultured the cells, taking rapidly growing cells and putting someof them in a fresh culture medium. This process is called a passage. At the timeof each passage, they also put some of the cells on top of dying cells in flaskscontaining the toxin. Sooner or later, resistant cells began to appear. Hill and his colleagues decided to look for thioguanine resistance using a“serial assay” method, which differed from the technicians’ procedure in thatfresh flasks of toxic medium were used at each passage. The hamster cells weregrown in a normal culture medium, and while still growing were divided into twosamples. One was put into a fresh culture medium so that it could go on growing;the other was put into a new flask of the toxic medium. Thus at each passage,some cells were assayed for thioguanine resistance, while the others went ongrowing normally (figure A.2). To start with, all the cells they placed in the thioguanine assay medium werekilled. But after several passages, some cells were able to survive in the toxicmedium. They had mutated. At the next passage, even more of the cells survivedthe toxin. The mutation rate was increasing. The descendants of these cells werealso able to grow in the toxic assay medium; they inherited this resistance.14[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos818923] Hill and his colleagues did another experiment to see if the same process couldbe repeated with a different poison, ethionine, not previously used in toxicitystudies with hamster cells. For the first thirty passages, over a fifteen-weekperiod, all the cells exposed to ethionine died. > The subsequent passages were characterized by a sudden appearance of mutants.> These were more frequent from passage to passage . . . Thus> ethionine-resistant mutants occurred in cultures growing without selection,> and arose, in those growing cultures, in response to an ethionine attack on> cells in parallel, physically separated cultures.15> [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos819209] image [images/00035.jpg]Figure A.2. Miroslav Hill’s serial assay technique. At each passage, some cellswere transferred to the toxic medium and some to the normal medium. The ethionine-resistant cells gave rise to descendants that inherited theirresistance. Hill’s team then investigated whether the same techniques would enable hamstercells to adapt to high temperatures. The cells were grown, as usual, at 37°C,and at each passage, a sample was withdrawn and assayed for growth at 40.6°C. > Cells in the first sample died within three days, in the second they survived> a profound crisis and gave rise to eleven colonies, and in the third they> became established after a barely noticeable crisis. These cells then grew> continuously as a cell line at 40.6°C. In a second phase of the experiment, this cell line was kept growing at 40.6°Cand samples were withdrawn at each passage and assayed at 41.3°C. No cellssurvived at this elevated temperature for thirty-one passages. Then tolerantcells began to occur in small numbers, then more frequently, and finally inlarge numbers. This new strain could thereafter be grown indefinitely at 41.3°C.In further experiments, Hill’s team succeeded in establishing a strain thatcould grow at an even higher temperature, 42.0°C, but were not able to gohigher. Hill’s conclusion was that “cells are more likely to survive an attack if theirclose relatives have already experienced such an attack.” He argued that thisshowed that “there is an additional flow of information, not mediated by DNA,which may be referred to as adaptive information.” How was this adaptive information transmitted to close relatives? Hill suggestedit happened because some of the cells under attack and some of the cells in thenormal culture were sisters, separated at the most recent passage. Because theywere descendants of the same mother cell, they were “entangled” in the sense ofquantum physics. According to quantum theory, systems that were part of the same system in thepast remain linked, even when miles apart, such that a change in one isimmediately accompanied by a change in the other, a phenomenon that AlbertEinstein described as “spooky action at a distance.” There is good experimentalevidence that entanglement (also known as quantum non-locality, or quantumnon-separability) really happens. Hill suggested that sister cells are not justanalogous to but actually are entangled quantum systems. Hill proposed that some of the cells struggling for survival adapted in such away that they could resist the toxin, and their entangled sister cells underwenta similar adaptation even though they were not exposed to the toxin. Some of thedescendants of these unexposed sister cells were carried over at the nextpassage to the assay conditions, and when they came under attack they werealready resistant. Thus, passage by passage, the proportion of resistant cellsincreased in cells growing under normal conditions (figure A.3a). The hypothesis of morphic resonance provides an alternative interpretation. Somecells under attack may undergo adaptive changes, as Hill suggests. Then cellscurrently under attack tune in to the adaptation via morphic resonance from pastcells under attack. Hill’s proposal involves a transmission of adaptiveinformation across space, from sister cells under attack to sister cells in thenormal culture. Morphic resonance involves a transmission of adaptiveinformation across time, from past cells under attack to present cells underattack (figure A.3b). image [images/00036.jpg]Figure A.3. Above: The “entanglement” interpretation of the Hill effect. Adaptedcells in the toxic medium affect their sisters in the normal medium throughentanglement (dotted lines). Below: The morphic resonance interpretation of theHill effect. Adapted cells in the toxic medium influence subsequent cells in thetoxic medium by morphic resonance (curved dotted lines). These interpretations make different predictions that can be tested byexperiment. Mouse cells could be used instead of hamster cells to avoid anymorphic resonance from Hill’s previous experiments. Two cell lines, A and B, are derived from a common ancestral culture. Line A issimply transferred to a new normal medium in passage after passage, with nosamples subjected to attack. B is subcultured following the Hill serial assayprocedure, with some of the cells put under attack at each passage (figure A.4).Say that resistant cells in line B arise at passage five. The entanglementhypothesis predicts that adaptation should increase in the normal cells in lineB but not in line A. Starting at passage five, line A is now subcultured at eachpassage following the Hill procedure, and subcultures are subject to the sameattack as those in line B (figure A.4). The entanglement hypothesis suggeststhat there will be about five passages before the cells under attack begin todevelop resistance, as before. But the morphic resonance hypothesis suggeststhat resistance should begin to appear within one or two passages, because ofmorphic resonance from cells in line B. image [images/00037.jpg]Figure A.4. An experiment to distinguish between entanglement and morphicresonance effects in the adaptation of cells to a toxic medium. Below: Atsuccessive passages, cells in line B are placed in a toxic medium. After, say,five passages, adapted cells begin to appear and the proportion of adapted cellsincreases in subsequent passages. Above: The serial assay procedure begins afterfive passages in line A. If only entanglement was at work, adapted cells wouldnot appear in the toxic medium for about five passages; if morphic resonance wasat work, they would appear almost immediately. A.5 Heat tolerance in plants Animals and plants often adapt to changes in their environment. For example,humans who move to high altitudes acclimatize through a variety of physiologicalresponses, including making more red blood cells. Sheep moved to cold, dampclimates grow thicker wool. Plants moved to new climates adjust their physiologyand growth habits. Gardeners are familiar with these changes, and know that plants grown ingreenhouses may need “hardening off ” if they are to survive outdoors. Theplants are moved to a cold frame and gradually exposed to outdoor conditionsduring the daytime, then at night, before they are planted out in the open air.Hardening off may take two or three weeks. A range of biochemical changes occurswithin the plants and they often grow thicker coatings of wax on their leaves.Under natural conditions, plants undergo cold hardening at the beginning ofwinter as temperatures drop, helping them to resist damage by frost that killsunhardened plants. When plants are introduced into new environments by gardeners or farmers, theplants may continue to adapt over several generations. Charles Darwin wasconvinced that the new habits that plants acquired as they acclimatized wereinherited, for example when spring-sown varieties of cereals were planted in theautumn and changed into winter varieties. > In the reciprocal conversion of summer and winter wheat, barley, and vetches> into each other, habit produces a marked effect in the course of a very few> generations. The same thing apparently occurs with the varieties of maize,> which, when carried from the Southern States of America into Germany, soon> become accustomed to their new homes.16> [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos819352] Trofim Lysenko and his colleagues in the Soviet Union continued to study theinterconversion of winter and spring wheat varieties, and they applied theseprinciples to Soviet agriculture on a large scale, with some success. But thesubject became intensely politicized, and neo-Darwinians in the West denouncedthe findings of the Soviet researchers as bogus.17[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos819604] The inheritance of adaptivehabits is prohibited by neo-Darwinism; only genes can be inherited. Darwin was not a neo-Darwinian. In his book The Variation of Animals and PlantsUnder Domestication, he brought together impressive evidence for the inheritanceof acquired characteristics. He thought heritable habits played an importantpart in evolution, along with spontaneous variation and natural selection: “Weneed not . . . doubt that under nature new races and new species would becomeadapted to widely different climates, by variation, aided by habit, andregulated by natural selection.”18[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos819833] Morphic resonance provides a means whereby habits can be inherited and is inaccord with Darwin’s own ideas. But however much it agrees with Darwin, it isstill only a hypothesis. Does it really play a part in the adaptation of plantsto new conditions? I propose a simple test in which plants of an inbred strain, say a standardvariety of pea, are grown from seed in a controlled environment under nearlethal high temperatures. The proportion that survives is recorded. The sameprocedure is repeated again and again. An increasing proportion of plants shouldsurvive because of morphic resonance from those that adapted successfully inprevious trials. This experiment could be done with two parallel lines. In C, plants are grownfrom the original stock of seeds, so there is no possibility that any adaptivechanges are passed on through the genes (figure A.5 above). Any increase inadaptation over time would be a result of morphic resonance. In line D, seeds are taken from plants that have survived the high temperatureand are used for growing the next generation (figure A.5 below). In this line,any increase in adaptation from generation to generation would be due to acombination of morphic resonance and epigenetic inheritance. image [images/00038.jpg]Figure A.5. An experiment on heat tolerance in plants. Above: Seeds of an inbredvariety are grown under high temperature conditions in successive trials. Ifmorphic resonance is at work, they should show greater adaptation in successivetrials. Below: Seeds taken from heat-adapted plants are used in the next trial.Increased heat adaptation in successive generations could be due to acombination of epigenetic inheritance and morphic resonance. The recognition of epigenetic inheritance took place only after the turn of themillennium, and it provides a legitimately mechanistic basis for the inheritanceof acquired characteristics. Now that a mechanistic explanation is available,the taboo against the inheritance of acquired characteristics has been lifted(section 7.7). Evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics that waspreviously anomalous and rejected or ignored has been rehabilitated.19[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos820086] If heat adaptation has heritable epigenetic effects, the progeny of adaptedplants will tolerate high temperatures better than plants grown from theoriginal batch of seeds (figure A.5). Epigenetic inheritance will not only passon patterns of gene activation and inactivation but also, at the same time, makethe progeny of adapted plants more similar to previous adapted plants, and hencemore strongly affected by morphic resonance from them. Any improvements in theadaptation of plants in line D would be a result of both direct epigeneticinheritance and increased morphic resonance. The conventional expectation would be that line C would show no change. Thehypothesis of formative causation predicts that both lines C and D will show aprogressive heat tolerance in successive trials, but line D will show thiseffect more strongly. A.6 The transmission of aversion Conditioned aversion is a rapid and long-lasting form of learning. Animals avoideating something that has made them ill. If you eat a new kind of food and aresick soon afterward, you will probably avoid that food thereafter. Conditionedaversion occurs in invertebrates, too. Its evolutionary advantages areobvious—it helps animals avoid harmful foods, and hence survive better. Conditioned aversion is associated with the brain stem, the part of the brainthat helps control the gut, the secretion of gastric juices, and vomiting.Learning at this level operates unconsciously. If a cancer patient receiveschemotherapy that makes her feel sick, and eats something just before thesickness starts, she will probably find its smell nauseating for the rest of herlife, even though she knows that the cancer treatment and not the food was thecause of her illness. Conditioned aversion overrides conscious understanding. Could conditioned aversion be transmitted by morphic resonance? If animals of aparticular species have become averse to eating a harmful kind of food, willanimals of the same species tend to avoid that food as a result of morphicresonance from similar animals that have already become averse to it? Somepreliminary experiments suggest this might happen. In 1988, I wrote an article about morphic resonance in the Guardian, a Britishnewspaper. Soon afterward the same newspaper published a response by StevenRose, a neuroscientist, who challenged me to test “this seemingly absurdhypothesis” in his laboratory at the Open University. Rose was well known inBritain for his strong political views—he was a Marxist—and his robust polemicalstyle. I accepted his challenge, and raised the funding for the tests to be carried outby a student, Amanda Harrison, in Rose’s laboratory. She worked under Rose’ssupervision and was not informed of the hypothesis being tested. At that time, Rose was studying changes in the brains of day-old chicks as aresult of conditioned aversion. Chicks instinctively peck at small brightobjects in their environment, and Rose’s standard procedure was to expose chicksto a test stimulus, for example a small yellow light–emitting diode (LED). Soonafter the chicks pecked it, they were made mildly sick with an injection oflithium chloride. As a result, they developed an aversion to pecking the samekind of bead again. Control chicks were exposed to a control stimulus, say achrome bead. After pecking at the chrome bead, the control chicks were injectedwith a harmless saline solution, and developed no aversion to it. This form oflearning was different from conditioned taste aversion in that it involved avisual stimulus, but like taste aversion it provided a rapid form of learningthat needed only one trial. Rose and I designed an experiment with a new stimulus, a yellow LED notpreviously used in experiments of this kind, to avoid any carryover of morphicresonance from previous aversion experiments with green LEDs. Indeed, we foundthat the chicks pecked a yellow LED much more readily than a green LED: therewas an average delay of 4.1 seconds before they pecked the yellow LED and 19.0seconds with green.20 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos820310] For thecontrol stimulus, we used a chrome bead. Every day for thirty-seven days the same tests were performed with fresh batchesof day-old chicks. Half the batch of chicks, selected at random, was tested withthe yellow LED, the other half with the chrome bead. Then the chicks exposed tothe yellow LED were made mildly sick. Three hours later they were tested again,and exposed to both the yellow LED and the chrome bead. Most avoided pecking theyellow LED, but had no aversion to the chrome bead. The control chicks that hadpecked at the chrome bead were injected with saline solution, and they too weretested three hours later with both the chrome bead and the yellow LED. I predicted that if morphic resonance was taking place, successive batches ofday-old chicks should show an increasing aversion to the yellow LED when firstexposed to it. No such aversion to the chrome bead would be expected with thecontrol chicks. Rose predicted that there would be no increase in aversion withthe control or the test chicks. What did the data show? First of all, there was an effect that neither of us hadpredicted, though in retrospect we should have done so. The student carrying outthe tests had never worked with chicks before, and took about a week before shelearned how to handle the chicks and carry out the tests properly. The data fromthe first few days showed a big learning effect—not by the chicks but by thestudent. From then on, after she had learned the techniques, there was aconsistent pattern. Relative to the controls, the test chicks exposed for thefirst time to the yellow LED became progressively averse to pecking it (figureA.6). This effect was statistically significant. image [images/00039.jpg]Figure A.6. An experiment on conditioned aversion with day-old chicks. “Test”chicks were exposed to a yellow light–emitting diode (LED) and control chicks toa chrome bead. There was an increased delay in pecking at the LED relative tothe control stimulus in successive three-day periods. The measure of delay, or “latency,” was the proportion of chicks that did not peck at the stimulus withinten seconds. (Data from Sheldrake, 1992a) In my view, the data were consistent with the operation of morphic resonance. InRose’s view, they were not.21 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos820524] image [images/00004.jpg]Perhaps the best opportunity for further research on the transmission ofaversion is with rats. Conditioned aversion is an important practical problemfor the rat-control industry. If rats are fed bait laced with a quick-actingtoxin, the poison kills a few rats to start with, but the other rats soon avoidit. They rapidly become “bait shy.” For this reason, the most effective ratpoisons are slow-acting, like warfarin, which does not cause illness soon afterbeing eaten. Warfarin, first licensed for use as a rodenticide in 1952, is ananticoagulant and works slowly because it kills rats through internal bleeding.Some bleed to death after being bitten by other rats. After warfarin had been in use for about ten years, resistant strains of ratsbegan to appear in Britain, then in other parts of Europe, the United States,and Asia. In the 1970s, poison manufacturers rose to the challenge by producinga second generation of rodenticides, “superwarfarins” such as brodifacoum.Resistance to these new toxic agents is now increasing all over the world.22[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos820935] When anticoagulant poisons fail to eradicate all the rats in an infestation,pest-control operatives usually revert to using a fast-acting, old-style ratpoison like zinc phosphide. Because rats so rapidly become bait shy, a techniquecalled prebaiting is used. The rats are fed on an attractive food that does notcontain poison and when they are used to it, zinc phosphide is added. The ratsare no longer cautious and eat enough to kill them. Without prebaiting, individual rats may eat only a small amount of poisonedbait. They fall ill but then recover and are bait shy because of conditionedtaste aversion. Rats are social animals, and bait-shy individuals communicatetheir aversion to other members of the group by “social learning.” One componentof social learning is imitation, especially the imitation of parents by theiryoung. Another component is the smelling of the breath of other members of thecolony, enabling other rats to know what they have been eating. Morphicresonance may also play an important role in social learning. But as baitshyness spread through a colony, it would be impossible to tease apart therelative contributions of morphic resonance and other kinds of informationtransmission. To test for morphic resonance, it would be necessary to comparethe behavior of separate colonies miles apart. Here is a simple experimental design. Two new kinds of food, designated G and H,are given unusual flavors that rats are unlikely to have encountered before. Tencolonies are selected for this experiment, located miles away from each other.Five of these colonies are selected at random and both G and H are madeavailable to them. The rates at which the rats eat them are recorded. Now one ofthe foods is selected at random—say G—and poisoned with low doses of zincphosphide. The rats become bait shy and avoid G. Now rats in the other five colonies are given unpoisoned G and H to eat. Ifmorphic resonance is at work, the rats should show a tendency to avoid G but notH. Similar experiments could be done under more-controlled conditions with captivecolonies of rats or mice, but to minimize unnecessary suffering, it would bebetter to do these experiments in situations where the animals are going to bepoisoned anyway. A.7 The evolution of animal behavior In The Presence of the Past, I described the spread of a new pattern of behaviorsuggestive of morphic resonance: the stealing of cream by blue tits. In Britain,fresh supplies of milk were (and still are) delivered to the doorsteps of housesevery morning except Sunday. In the 1920s, blue tits and several related speciesof birds began to steal cream by removing the caps and drinking from the tops ofthe bottles. The first record of this habit was in 1921 from Southampton, and its spreadthroughout Britain was monitored by amateur bird-watchers between 1930 and 1947.The main cream-stealing species were blue tits, great tits, and coal tits. Oncecream-stealing had been discovered in a particular place, it spread locally byimitation. Tits do not usually move more than a few kilometers from their nesting place,and appearances of this habit over gaps of more than twenty-five kilometersprobably represented new discoveries by individual birds. A detailed analysis ofthe records by scientists at Cambridge University showed that cream-stealing wasprobably discovered independently at least eighty-nine times in the BritishIsles. The spread of the habit accelerated as time went on.23[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos821299] This habit also appeared in continental Europe, particularly Sweden, Denmark,and Holland. The Dutch records are particularly interesting. Milk deliveriesstopped during the Second World War and began again in 1947. Tits live only afew years, and probably none that had learned this habit before the war wouldhave survived until this date. Nevertheless, attacks on milk bottles began againrapidly. “It seemed certain that the habit was started in many different placesby many individuals.”24 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos821550] Incidentally, cream-stealing now seems to be dying out. In the late 1980s, titsregularly attacked milk bottles delivered to our family house in London. In theearly 1990s, we switched from full-cream to semi-skimmed milk, like many otherpeople, and the attacks soon stopped. I have not seen a milk bottle attacked bytits for more than ten years, although there are still plenty of tits in theneighborhood. The birds seem to have given up now that there is so little creamto steal. Several other examples of the rapid evolution of new patterns of behaviorsuggest morphic resonance could have played a part. According to an eminent Texas naturalist, Roy Bedichek, when barbed wire wasfirst introduced, in the late nineteenth century, skeptics predicted that itwould never be suitable for horse pastures. Horses dashed right into it and “cuttheir own throats, tore great slugs of flesh from their breasts, while woundsnot fatal or mere scratches became infested with screw worms.” In 1947 he wrote,“I can remember the time when there was hardly a horse to be found in Texasfarming or ranching sections that was not scarred from encounters with barbedwire.”25 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos821826] Yet by the middle ofthe twentieth century, this was now no longer a serious problem: “In half acentury the horse has learned to avoid barbed wire. Colts rarely dash into it.The whole species has been taught a new fear.” Bedichek also commented on the changed reactions of horses to cars. > When automobiles first appeared, horse-drawn traffic was disorganized. The> more considerate autoist would drive out of the road and cut off the motor> immediately a team of horses hove in sight. Not only that, the motorist would> get out of his car and help the driver lead the rearing, snorting horses by> it. Many the vehicle wrecked and many the neck broken in making the> introduction of horse to automobile and establishing his tolerance for it.> Loud were the demands for laws to keep automobiles in their place . . . We no> longer have breakneck runaways every time a team of horses meets an> automobile.26 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos822070] Another example of behavioral evolution in farm animals concerns cattle grids(known as cattle guards in the United States), which are pits with a series ofparallel steel tubes or rails over the top. They make it physically impossiblefor cattle to walk across them, and serve as both a gate and a fence; they keeplivestock from passing, but allow vehicles and people to cross freely. Cattleguards were invented in the United States in the nineteenth century to stopanimals wandering onto railway lines. They began to be used on American roadsaround 1905,27 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos822212] and are nowwidely used in many other countries. When cattle grids were first introduced, animals may have had to learn the hardway that they could not pass. But this is no longer the case. Farm animals seemto avoid these grids instinctively and do not even try to cross them. Several decades ago, ranchers throughout the American West found that they couldsave money on cattle grids by using fake grids instead, consisting of stripespainted across the road. The painted grids worked because the animals did noteven try to cross them. In response to my inquiries, several ranchers in the western United States toldme that there is no need for herds to be exposed to real cattle grids first.Animals that have never seen a real cattle grid avoid the fake ones. When youngcattle approach a painted grid, they “put on brakes with all four feet,” as onerancher expressed it. I corresponded with researchers in the Departments ofAnimal Science at Colorado State University and at Texas Agricultural andMechanical University (A&M) who confirmed this observation. Professor Ted Friend, of Texas A&M, systematically tested the responses ofseveral hundred head of cattle to painted grids, and found that naive animalsavoided them just as much as those previously exposed to real grids. Sheep andhorses also showed an innate aversion to crossing painted grids. Nevertheless,the spell of a fake grid could be broken. When cows were driven toward one underpressure, or when food was placed on the other side, sometimes one of themexamined the stripes closely and then walked across. When one member of a herddid this, the others soon followed. Thereafter, the phony grid ceased to act asa barrier.28 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos822438] Perhaps painted cattle grids work simply because they create the illusion of adrop. In this case, they should have worked all along, and ranchers need nothave used real grids in the first place. It would be interesting to find out ifwild species never before exposed to cattle grids show a comparable aversion tocrossing them. It would also be good to find out whether cattle respond equallywell to a variety of striped patterns, or just stripes that look like cattlegrids. Interestingly, a new response to cattle grids is currently evolving. In 1985,sheep near Blaenau Ffestiniog, in Wales, started escaping from their pastures byrolling over grids. So did sheep in Sweden, around Malmohus. An editorial in theGuardian in 1985 commented: > To the best of our knowledge the sheep in the Yorkshire Dales, which are> mostly Swaledales or Dalesbred, have yet to master the technique of crossing> cattle grids by curling up and rolling over them. Yet the sheep of Blaenau> Ffestiniog, which are a different breed, have learned how to do it (to the> annoyance of the town, which may have to put up a fence) and so have the> lowland sheep of southern Sweden. Among the questions that immediately arise> are how long will it take the Swaledales to learn and whether, when they do,> they will be demonstrating the theory of formative causation.29> [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos822655] Twelve years later, sheep started crossing cattle grids in Hampshire. To startwith, they used a “commando” technique, with one of them lying on the cattlegrid while others scrambled across her. But then they started crossing byrolling across the bars of the grid, like the Welsh sheep.30[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos822818] Similar behavior was observedin the Valais region of Switzerland.31[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos822980] In 2004, nineteen years after the editors of the Guardian had anticipated thepossibility, sheep on the Yorkshire moors began escaping from the moors byrolling over cattle grids and grazing on the nearby gardens of villagers.32[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos823143] Animals, both wild and domesticated, continue to evolve in response to man-madechanges in their environment, and the emergence of new patterns of behaviorprovides opportunities for documenting how these patterns spread. The monitoringof cream-stealing in Britain by amateur bird-watchers in the 1930s and 1940sprovides a good precedent for research with widespread participation. Suchstudies will never be able to provide such clear-cut data as laboratoryexperiments, but they could shed light on the possible role of morphic resonancein evolution, with very different implications from the neo-Darwinian theory. A.8 Collective human memory According to the hypothesis of morphic resonance, that which has been learned bymany people in the past should be easier for people to learn today. Everyonedraws upon and in turn contributes to a collective human memory. In 1982, the British magazine New Scientist held a competition for ideas fortests of morphic resonance. The winning entry was by a psychologist, RichardGentle, for an experiment involving Turkish nursery rhymes. He suggested thatEnglish-speaking people be asked to memorize two short rhymes in Turkish, atraditional nursery rhyme known to millions of Turks over the years and theother a new rhyme made by rearranging the words in the genuine nursery rhyme.The participants would not be told which was which. After equal periods spentmemorizing each of the rhymes, they would be tested to find out which theyremembered better. If morphic resonance were at work, the traditional rhymewould be easier to memorize than the new one. This is an example of an “old field” test, whereby learning of something with along-established morphic field is compared with learning something new. Manyold-field tests of morphic resonance have been conducted. Most have givenpositive results. I took up Gentle’s suggestion but used Japanese rather than Turkish nurseryrhymes. A leading Japanese poet, Shuntaro Tanikawa, kindly supplied me with agenuine nursery rhyme known to generations of Japanese children and two othersspecially composed to resemble it in its structure, one meaningful and the othermeaningless. In tests conducted in Britain and America, people did indeedremember the genuine rhyme significantly better than the others.33[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos823317] But this experiment raised adifficulty that applies to all old-field experiments. How can one be sure thatthe new rhymes, with which the old one was compared, were of similar intrinsicstructure? Perhaps real nursery rhymes became popular precisely because theyhave features that made them easier to memorize in the first place. Although apoet is more likely to be able to produce comparable new rhymes than an amateur,it is hard to know whether the new rhymes would be intrinsically comparable tothe old ones in the absence of any morphic resonance effects. Most old-field tests have involved foreign scripts. Gary Schwartz, a professorof psychology at Yale University, carried out one of the first. His idea wasthat ordinary words should be associated with morphic fields that facilitatetheir recognition. For example, the English word cat is recognized as a whole—asa Gestalt—and involves a morphic field sustained by resonance from millions ofreaders in the past. By contrast, a meaningless anagram of the same letters,like “tca,” has no such resonance. Schwartz reasoned that people who areunfamiliar with a foreign script might find it easier to recognize real words inthis language than false words. Schwartz selected forty-eight three-letter words from the Hebrew Old Testament,twenty-four common and twenty-four rare, and then produced a meaningless anagramof each word, giving ninety-six words in all. Over ninety participants who wereignorant of Hebrew were shown these words one by one, projected on a screen in arandom order. They were asked to guess the meaning of each word by writing downthe first English word that came to mind. Then they estimated on a 0–4 scale theconfidence they felt in their guess. They were not told the purpose of theexperiment, nor that some of the words were scrambled. This test dependedentirely on the visual pattern of the written words; it did not involve hearingthe words or attempting to pronounce them. A few participants did in fact guess the meanings of some of the Hebrew wordscorrectly, but Schwartz excluded them from his analysis on the grounds that theymight have had some knowledge of Hebrew. He then examined the replies of theparticipants who always guessed the wrong meanings. Remarkably, on average, theywere more confident about their guesses when viewing real words than scrambledwords, even though they did not know that some of the words were real and othersfalse. The effect was roughly twice as strong with the common words as with therare words. The results were very significant statistically.34[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos823528] Only after Schwartz had tested his participants did he inform them that half thewords were real and the other half were scrambled. He then showed them the wordsagain, one by one, asking them to guess which was which. The results were nobetter than chance. The participants were unable to do consciously what they hadalready done unconsciously. Schwartz interpreted the greater confidenceparticipants felt about their guesses of the meanings of the real words in termsof an “unconscious pattern recognition effect.” Alan Pickering, a psychologist at Hatfield Polytechnic in England, used Persianwords rather than Hebrew words, written in Persian script. His test, likeSchwartz’s, involved real and scrambled words. Participants were shown a wordand asked to look at it for ten seconds. They were then asked to draw it.Independent judges evaluated the reproductions of real and false words. Neitherthe experimenter nor the judges knew which words were real and which werescrambled. The real words were reproduced significantly more accurately than thefalse words. Subsequent experiments carried out as student projects by Nigel Davidson withPersian words and by Geraldine Chapman with Arabic words gave similar positiveresults. Arden Mahlberg, an American psychologist, performed an analogous test with Morsecode. He constructed a new version by assigning dots and dashes to differentletters of the alphabet. The participants did not know Morse code. He comparedtheir ability to learn the new code and genuine Morse code, presenting thematerial in a written form. (The letters S and O were excluded because manypeople who do not know Morse code are nevertheless familiar with the code forS.O.S.) On average, participants learned real Morse code significantly moreaccurately than the new code.35 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos823852] Suitbert Ertel, a professor of psychology at Göttingen University, Germany,investigated the possible effects of morphic resonance on the recognition ofJapanese hiragana script, a phonetic component of the Japanese writing system.Participants were shown nine different hiragana characters in a random order,projected on a screen for eight seconds. They then turned to an answer sheetwith twenty hiragana characters, among which the nine characters they had justseen were randomly mixed. They were asked to mark the characters they thoughtthey had just seen. The same test was repeated with the characters in differentrandom orders. Each participant did six trials, and the recognition of thehiragana characters generally improved trial by trial.36[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos824137] Ertel predicted that if morphic resonance were playing a part, hiraganacharacters should be recognized more readily when they were the right way upthan when they were upside down, because millions of Japanese were used torecognizing these characters in their normal position. Sure enough, this is whathe found. In a further experiment, he used artificial hiragana characters invented by agraphic designer. Before running the learning tests, he and his students showedparticipants genuine and artificial hiragana characters and asked them to pickthe genuine ones. They could not tell the difference. The Göttingen team thencarried out its standard memory tests, and found that the real characters wereremembered better than the false ones, in accordance with the predictions of thehypothesis of morphic resonance. Ertel and his team then carried out a further test, which they regarded ascrucial. They compared the effect of putting the real characters upside downwith that of putting fake characters upside down. Ertel argued that with fakeHiragana characters, rotation should have no effect because morphic resonanceplays no part in the recognition of these characters either way up. The results were confusing and Ertel’s interpretation was hard to follow. In thefirst two trials, there was indeed almost no difference in the recognition ofthe upside-down and right-way-up fake hiragana characters (figure A.7). But inthe subsequent trials, the false hiraganas were remembered better the right wayup. Ertel argued that the faster rate of learning in the later trials with thefake hiraganas the right way up was because of “intrinsic factors” that hadnothing to do with morphic resonance. Surprisingly, he provided no statisticalanalysis to show whether this effect was significant. However, Ertel’s fake hiragana characters were designed to look like realhiragana characters when they were the right way up. Insofar as they resembledreal hiragana characters, it may be that they did so precisely because they hada “right-way-up” feel to them, because of a generic resemblance to realcharacters. This “intrinsic factor” may not be an alternative to morphicresonance, but rather may depend on their generic resemblance to right-way-uphiragana characters, which was built in from the start. image [images/00040.jpg]Figure A.7. The results of Suitbert Ertel’s experiment on the recognition ofhiragana characters. The vertical axis shows the number of words recognized insix successive trials. The four sets of data points refer to real and falsecharacters, right way up and upside down. (Reproduced by courtesy of SuitbertErtel) In retrospect, Ertel thought that he and his students had made a mistake intheir initial tests when they were trying to find out whether the fake hiraganacharacters were indeed similar to real ones: “It gradually dawned on us that wehad not instructed the participants of the preliminary tests optimally. Weshould have asked them to look at the 40 symbols on the piece of paper and markthose that seemed simpler, more pleasant, and less strange to them. These werethe intrinsic features that another test had already revealed to be relevant.Instead we had informed the participants that there were 20 genuine and 20artificial Japanese symbols and asked them to mark the 20 genuine.” Thecomplexity of Ertel’s interpretations illustrates how difficult it is to obtainclear-cut results in old-field experiments. Robert Schorn, Gottfried Tappeiner, and Janette Walde recently carried out anold-field test at the University of Innsbruck. They used stimuli consisting ofpolitical, religious, and economic symbols such as flags, emblems, andtrademarks that were once well known but have now fallen into oblivion, or onesthat are familiar to many people in foreign countries, such as the ChineseCoca-Cola symbol, Indian trademarks, and Far Eastern religious symbols. For eachof the symbols, a designer created a corresponding control symbol with a similargeneral pattern and similar complexity. In order to find out whether the new symbols were indeed comparable, theexperimenters conducted seven pretests with more than two hundred participants,who were asked to indicate which of the symbols in each pair they found lesscredible or real. In their main experiment, they employed false symbols thatwere as credible as the originals, if not more credible. Participants were shownpairs of symbols, one real and one false, in a randomly determined order, andthey were asked to judge which of each pair had more “spirit.” They selected thereal symbols significantly more often than the fake ones.37[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos824472] In a second test, the Innsbruck team compared real Russian words written inCyrillic script with meaningless anagrams of these words. Again the real andfalse stimuli were presented in pairs, and the participants were asked to judgewhich had more “spirit.” The real words were selected significantly more thanthe anagrams. Some of these tests took place through the Internet, illustrating the potentialfor widespread public participation in automated morphic resonance tests.Kimberly Robbins and Chris Roe, at the University of Northampton, England,carried out the most recent old-field experiment using genuine and false Chinesecharacters. The experimental design was similar to Ertel’s. Participants werefirst shown a PowerPoint presentation consisting of five real and five falseChinese characters in a random sequence, seeing each character for threeseconds. They were not told that some characters were real and others false.They were then given a sheet with twenty characters on it and asked to circlethe ten they had just seen. The other ten characters were “decoys,” and againfive were real and five false. The participants recognized the real characterssignificantly better than the false ones. With the decoys, participants hadsignificantly more false memories of real than false characters, consistent witha morphic resonance effect.38 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos824780] Nevertheless, all old-field tests face the difficulty of controlling for“intrinsic factors” that might make old symbols, words, or rhymes more memorableor more attractive than newly invented ones. But are intrinsic factors andmorphic resonance genuine alternatives? Intrinsic factors may themselves dependon morphic resonance. A.9 Improving human performance The simplest new-field tests start with two new patterns. The first step is tofind out how easily they can be learned or recognized. The second step is tobuild up morphic resonance from one and not the other. If morphic resonance isplaying a part, the one that has been “boosted” should subsequently be easier tolearn or recognize; there should be no such change with the control. The first new-field test was carried out with hidden images, following asuggestion by Nicholas Humphrey. Such pictures seem to make no sense at first,or contain only vague hints of patterns (see figure A.8a). Seeing the underlyingimage (figure A.8b) involves a sudden Gestalt shift; the picture takes on adefinite meaning. After this has happened, it is difficult not to recognize thehidden image and hard to believe that others cannot see it. If morphic resonanceis at work, a hidden image should become easier to recognize if many people havealready seen it. In the summer of 1983, a British television company, Thames Television, made itpossible for me to conduct an experiment of this kind. The two puzzle pictureswere specially produced by an artist and designed to be difficult, so that onlya small minority of people could spot the hidden images. Before the televisionbroadcast in Britain, I sent both these pictures to collaborators in Europe,Africa, and the Americas. Each experimenter showed both pictures for one minuteeach to a group of participants before the transmission, and afterward toanother group of comparable participants. The number of people who recognizedthe hidden image was recorded. The experimenters did not know which of the pictures was going to be shown ontelevision, and nor did I. On the TV show itself, one was picked at random andshown to about two million viewers. After several seconds the answer wasrevealed, and this then “melted” back into the puzzle picture so that thepreviously hidden image was now readily apparent. The same picture was shownonce more at the end of the program. The percentage of participants recognizing the control picture before and afterthe TV broadcast did not change, while the percentage recognizing the imageshown on TV in Britain increased. This effect was statistically significant,with a probability of less than one in a hundred that the result arose bychance.39 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos825231] The experiment was repeated, using different images, on BBC television inNovember 1984 on a popular science program called Tomorrow’s World. Again therewere two puzzle pictures with hidden images. Experimenters all over the worldtested groups of participants to find out what proportion could recognize thehidden images within thirty seconds. Such tests were carried out in a five-dayperiod before the TV transmission in Britain, and with comparable participantsin a five-day period afterward. On the TV show, one of the two images wasselected at random and shown to eight million viewers, to whom the answer wasrevealed. This picture did in fact become significantly easier to recognize elsewherewhile there was no change with the control. But this positive effect wasconfined to participants in continental Europe; there was no effect in NorthAmerica. The disparity was surprising. Morphic resonance should not bedistance-dependent. One possible explanation was that in Europe, where the timedifference from Britain is only one hour, people were more “in phase” with theBritish TV audience than people in America, with a five- to eight-hour timedifference. image [images/00041.jpg]Figure A.8a. A hidden image, as used in a television test for morphic resonance.The image is revealed in figure A.8b. A new hidden-image experiment was carried out in February 1985, with a TVtransmission in Germany by Norddeutscher Rundfunk. Again there were twopictures, of which only one was shown on television. This experiment wascoordinated by Susan Fassberg, in Freiburg im Breisgau. She arranged forthousands of participants to be tested in various parts of the world,predominantly in Britain. As in the previous experiments, there was nosignificant change in the proportion of people recognizing the control picture,but the proportion recognizing the test picture declined in Britain andelsewhere after being seen by about half a million people in North Germany! Thedecline was significant, at the 2 percent level of probability. From the pointof view of morphic resonance, there should have been an increase. From aSkeptical point of view, there should have been no change. Nobody predicted adecrease. image [images/00042.jpg]Figure A.8b. The image hidden in figure A.8a. This result showed that other factors were coming into play, but what were they?No one knew. This puzzling finding discouraged anyone from doing more tests ontelevision, which were complicated to arrange. In 1987, the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS), near San Francisco, announcedan award for the best student research on morphic resonance. An independentpanel of judges assessed the entries, and the results were announced in 1991.40[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos825463] The winner of the undergraduate award was Monica England, a psychology studentat the University of Nottingham, England. Her test was stimulated by anecdotalevidence that some people find it easier to do newspaper crosswords the dayafter they have been published than when they first appear, an effect that couldbe due to morphic resonance from thousands of people who have already done thepuzzle. The experiment involved two puzzles from a London newspaper, the EveningStandard, which was not distributed in Nottingham. The newspaper kindlycooperated by supplying two unpublished puzzles a week before they appeared: the“easy crossword” and the “quick crossword.” The easy crossword had simplecryptic clues and the quick crossword had single-word clues that requiredsynonyms as answers. Monica England tested about fifty students the day before the crossword puzzleswere published in London, and a further fifty the day after. Both groups ofparticipants were also given two control puzzles, which had been published inthe Evening Standard two weeks earlier. The participants were given ten minuteswith each crossword to solve as many clues as possible. On average, participants solved significantly more clues with the easy puzzleafter it had been published than before. There was no change with the controlcrossword. By contrast, with the quick crossword there was no significantdifference in the test crossword relative to the control. I repeated this experiment in 1990, again using easy and quick crosswords fromthe Evening Standard, and testing people with the help of experimenters wholived far from London, where the participants would not have seen this Londonnewspaper. Again, the scores with both crosswords were compared with controls.There was a slight improvement in scores with the easy crossword after it waspublished, but this change was not statistically significant. By contrast, therewas a statistically significant increase with the quick crossword. Thus theresults were inconsistent, giving a positive effect with one crossword but notthe other, as in Monica England’s experiment. In her test the easy crosswordshowed a positive effect, and in mine the quick crossword. While reflecting on these results, I realized that I taken it for granted thatall the crossword puzzles were new, and I had assumed that they would beunaffected by morphic resonance from crosswords in the past. I then inquired howthe crosswords were put together, and found that the compilers frequentlyrecycled clues from previous crosswords. Hence these simple crosswords did notprovide a good test for morphic resonance, since many of the clues were in factnot new. Zoltan Dienes, then in the psychology department at the University of Oxford,won the IONS award for graduate students. His participants were required todecide quickly whether a string of letters they saw on a computer screen was ameaningful English word or a nonword. This experiment involved a phenomenonknown to psychologists as “repetition priming,” which occurs when a word (orother stimulus) is recognized more quickly after repeated exposure to it. Dienesreasoned that later participants might find it easier to recognize stimuli ifothers had done so earlier. The participants saw strings of letters flashed on a computer screen and had toindicate whether a string was a real word or a nonword by pressing computer keysas fast as possible. Dienes used two sets of words and non-words. One “shared”word set was presented to all ninety participants, while the second “unique” setwas shown only to every tenth participant. The experiment thus involved eighty“boosters” who viewed only the shared stimuli and ten “resonators” who saw theshared stimuli together with the unique ones. If morphic resonance were at work,the speed at which the shared stimuli were correctly judged should increaserelative to the speed at which unique stimuli were correctly judged. In order tomaximize the resonance between participants, all experimental trials wereconducted in a controlled environment with distinctive visual, olfactory, andauditory cues. The outcome was positive and statistically significant. The more often a nonwordhad been seen before, the faster subsequent resonators responded to it. However,when Dienes tried to repeat this experiment at the University of Sussex, therewas no significant effect.41 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos825645] Professor Suitbert Ertel carried out two new-field experiments in addition tothe old-field tests discussed above. The first took place through a magazinecalled Übermorgen. The experiment was based on anagrams, such as “Seterleirei”for “Reiseleiter,” and the task for the magazine’s readers was to find thenormal words. Readers were asked to repeat each anagram and its correspondingword as often as possible. When they had memorized them, they sent a postcard tothe experimenters on which they gave their telephone numbers. Their names wereentered for a raffle, and thirty of them received free copies of one of mybooks. They had to face a possible checkup by telephone to see whether they knewthe words, and a random sample of fifty people was actually called, withsatisfying results. About a thousand readers participated. These readers did not know the experiment also included sixty students atDresden University, where the magazine was not distributed. These students weretested with the same ten anagrams and with ten additional anagrams that had notbeen boosted by readers of Übermorgen. Could the students solve the boostedanagrams better than the controls? On average they could, but the effect was notstatistically significant.42 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos825908] Ertel’s second experiment took place through another magazine, PM. This wasdesigned to be fun for readers, and used artificial German words in standardphrases or proverbs. The meaning of the artificial words had to be guessed fromtheir context, like “Die blampe Leier,” “Das ist doch ein blamper Hut,” in which“blampe” was invented to replace “alt.” Ten new words had to be learned in thisway, in a total of one hundred phrases. The count of new meanings (e.g., themeaning alt = blampe occurred eight times) resulted in a ten-digit telephonenumber that the readers called. If the number was correct, they received aconfirmation from an answering machine. Sending a postcard with the correctnumber enabled the participants to take part in a raffle for fifty copies of mybook. Altogether 1,017 readers of PM magazine participated. Again, the influence of this boosting was tested in Dresden, where participantshad to push a button saying “artificial” or “real” as quickly as possible aftera word had appeared on a computer screen. The boosted artificial words weremixed with twenty other artificial words that had not been boosted. The studentsin Dresden were tested before and after the PM boosting. There was no differencein their success with the boosted and the control words. One problem with this test was that the conditions in which the participants sawthe words were very different from the context in which the PM readers learnedthem. One group of people were doing puzzles in a magazine at home or in otherinformal settings. The others were being tested for their reaction speed oncomputers in a laboratory. These dissimilarities could have weakened anyresonance effect. In summary, small-scale new-field tests have not given consistent, repeatableresults. But perhaps they are not sensitive enough; the resonance may be tooweak to be detectable with only a few hundred or a few thousand boosters. Morphic resonance can be investigated on a much larger scale by studying changesin human performance over time. Does the performance of new skills show atendency to improve as time goes on? Do video games get easier to play? Do newsports such as skateboarding and windsurfing become easier to learn? Anecdotalevidence suggests that they do, but such changes are not documentedquantitatively, and the situation is complicated by other factors, likeimprovements in equipment, fashion, better teaching methods, and so on. One of the few areas in which detailed data are available over many years is forthe scores of IQ (Intelligence Quotient) tests. Around 1980, I realized that ifmorphic resonance occurs, average performance in IQ tests should be rising, notbecause people are becoming more intelligent, but because IQ tests should begetting easier to do as a result of morphic resonance from the millions who havedone them before. I searched for data that would enable this prediction to betested, but could not find any published figures. I was therefore intrigued in1982 by the finding that average IQ test scores in Japan had been increasing by3 percent a decade since the Second World War.43[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos826233] Soon afterward, it turned out(to the relief of many Americans) that IQs had been rising at a similar rate inthe United States. The psychologist James Flynn first detected this effect in America in his studyof intelligence tests by U.S. military authorities. He found that recruits whowere merely average when compared with their contemporaries were above averagewhen compared with recruits in a previous generation who had taken exactly thesame test (figure A.9). No one had noticed this trend because testers routinelycompared an individual’s score with others of the same age, tested at the sametime; at any given time, the average IQ score is set to one hundred bydefinition.44 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos826461] Comparable increases are now known to have occurred in twenty other countries,including Australia, Britain, France, Germany, and Holland.45[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos826830] Many attempts have been made toexplain this “Flynn effect,” but none has succeeded.46[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos827071] For example, very little ofthis effect can be ascribed to practice at taking such tests. If anything, suchtests have become less common in recent years. Improvements in education cannotexplain it either. Nor, as some have suggested, can increasing exposure totelevision. IQ scores began rising decades before the advent of television inthe 1950s, and as Flynn has commented wryly, television was usually considered“a dumbing down influence until this effect came along.”47[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos827479] The more research there hasbeen, the more mysterious the Flynn effect has become. Flynn himself describesit as “baffling.”48 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos827770] But morphicresonance could provide a natural explanation. image [images/00043.jpg]Figure A.9. Changes in average IQ test scores in the United States from 1918 to1989, relative to 1989 values. (Data from Horgan, 1995) If the Flynn effect is indeed explicable in terms of morphic resonance, it showsthat such resonance effects are relatively small. If millions of people takingIQ tests lead to increased scores of only a few percentage points, then inexperiments involving a few hundred people, or at most a few thousand, themorphic resonance effects may be too small to detect against the “random noise”due to wide variations in performance from participant to participant. Morphic resonance might also have a bearing on “grade inflation,” the phenomenonof increasing academic grades over time. An evaluation of the grading practicesin American colleges and universities shows that since the 1960s, grades in theUnited States have risen at a rate of 0.15 per decade in a 4.0 scale. InBritain, the proportion of students achieving A grades in school examinationsand first-class university degrees has also been increasing steadily. Thisphenomenon has caused an intense debate: some people lament that standards arebecoming more lax, while others assert that students are producing better work.But morphic resonance would again provide a simple explanation. Standardexaminations are becoming easier to do because so many people have already donethem. When my elder son, Merlin Sheldrake, was about to take the British GCSE (GeneralCertificate of Secondary Education) examinations at age sixteen, he and a groupof his school friends came up with an ingenious plan for increasing their scoreswith no extra effort. In each exam, they would do the last questions first, andthen return to the beginning and follow the normal sequence. Hence they would beabout ten minutes behind everyone else in Britain sitting the same exam at thesame time, and should therefore receive a boost by morphic resonance. Theyactually put this idea into practice, reasoning that if morphic resonanceexisted, they might score better, and if it did not, they had nothing to lose. This idea raises the possibility of an experiment within the framework oflarge-scale examinations. The order of questions carried out by a random sampleof students could be changed. Are scores significantly higher on questions thatother students have answered earlier? New-field tests for morphic resonance could also be done on a large scale usingnewly released puzzles, such as Sudokus and computer games. Such tests wouldrequire the cooperation of the game or puzzle companies. As in the hidden-imageand crossword experiments, there would need to be a control puzzle or game thatwas not released during the period of the test. Groups of participants wouldneed to be tested in places where they do not have access to the newly releasedpuzzles or games, and such tests would be done before and after the puzzles orgames were released elsewhere. A.10 Resonant computers The hypothesis of formative causation applies to self-organizing systems such ascrystals, cells, and animal societies. Morphic fields work by imposing patternson otherwise indeterminate events. Hence morphic resonance does not apply tomachines. Machines are not self-organizing systems, but are made of componentsput together in factories according to human designs. Their functioning isstrictly determinate—they are designed to be predictable, and to do the samethings over and over again. Even when computers incorporate “randomness” intheir programming, the random numbers are generally provided by pseudorandomalgorithms, rather than by sources of genuine random “noise.” Francisco Varela, a neuroscientist, tried to test for morphic resonance in acomputer in the 1980s. He programmed it to carry out the same sequence ofoperations with 100 million repetitions, and measured how long these repetitionstook. There was no speeding up. Varela published this result in the SkepticalInquirer, claiming that it falsified the hypothesis of formative causation.49[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos827897] He argued that the changesimposed on silicon chips by the workings of the computer were equivalent torepeated crystallizations, and hence they should happen faster if the hypothesisof morphic resonance was correct. I replied that there was a difference in kind between the spontaneous formationof a crystal and the changes imposed on a silicon chip in a computer. But mostimportant, the experiment was technically misconceived. Computers work by arapid series of operations pulsed by the computer’s internal clock. In Varela’scomputer, the clock paced the instructions in the program with a unit time ofone microsecond. Even if the silicon chips had responded faster to the pulsedinstructions as a result of morphic resonance, the sequence of operations wasfixed by the clock and could not have speeded up.50[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos828158] Many readers of the SkepticalInquirer independently pointed out this fatal flaw in the test.51[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos828401] One morning in the spring of 1990, I was suddenly deluged with telephone callsfrom science journalists and computing science departments at universities. Thecause of the excitement was an article in a British magazine, Computer Shopper,describing some remarkable results about which I knew nothing. The report statedthat an Italian computer scientist, Dr. Lora Pfilo, had recently been carryingout an experiment with genetic algorithms, trying to find the best solution toan engineering problem by letting prospective solutions play against each otherover successive “generations.” The simulation was running on the BolognaUniversity connection machine, a massive parallel computer with 256,000processors. The article stated that Dr. Pfilo noticed that the first time theprogram ran it took forty minutes to complete, yet the second time she ran it,it took twenty-three. She found the sudden decrease in processing time a little worrying— perhaps ithad not run correctly owing to a power surge. So she ran the program again, andalthough the results matched up with results from the second run, the processortime had decreased to thirteen minutes. She ran the program repeatedly, andeventually the time decreased to one minute and twelve seconds. The resultamazed her. What was this extra causal factor that led to the decrease inprogramming time? In January she contacted a colleague visiting MilanUniversity—Professor Kvitlen Duren, a professor of mathematics from the InstitutSvit Chotiri in Kiev. The article continued with an interview with Professor Duren, who was in Londonto address the Royal Society. He too claimed to have noticed a decrease inprocessing time in one of his computers, but not in another that was running thesame genetic algorithm program. He found that the computer that ran more quicklyhad some additional circuitry, including a hardware random number device basedon a reversed Zener diode that generated quantum randomness. The other computerworked on a standard pseudorandom number algorithm. Professor Duren was reportedas saying: > We had great difficulty accepting this at first but what must have been> happening was that, in some sense, information from previous runs was being> “stored” out there. At this point, my good friend Lora Pfilo contacted me and> in the course of a general conversation we discovered we had both observed the> same effect. What I had been calling causal acceleration, she called morphic> resonance . . . What happens on the connection machine is that there is a> quantum indeterminacy in the scheduling of the multiple processes. The> indeterminacy is sufficient to produce the effects that Lora saw. I rang up Computer Shopper magazine and asked to be put in touch with the authorof the article. Soon afterward, he rang me back and said, “Before we go anyfurther, please look at the date on this issue of Computer Shopper.” I did. Itwas April 1. The author, Adrian Owen, and his colleague John Kozak invited me to meet them ina local pub soon afterward. Professor Duren, pictured in the article, was noneother than John Kozak with a false beard. Lora Pfilo was an anagram of Aprilfool. They told me that they were both intrigued by morphic resonance and hadbeen thinking about ways in which it might apply to computers. They had alsotried to think of an April fool article that would be sufficiently plausible tostimulate widespread interest, without being recognized immediately as a spoof.They succeeded beyond their wildest expectations. In 1993, Steven Rooke, of Tucson, Arizona, an experienced computer programmer,explored the possibility of carrying out in reality what the report in ComputerShopper had described. He used a computer graphics system, a reversed Zenerdiode as a source of quantum noise, and a genetic algorithm program thatconverged on a target image. The question was whether, in a randomized series ofruns, the rate of convergence on this target would increase. Rooke had toovercome a variety of technical problems, and the results of the morphicresonance tests were inconclusive. But his programs generated extraordinarilybeautiful graphic images, which he then produced commercially. Looking back on his experience, in October 2007, he doubted whether the quantumevent generator and the computer programs were tightly coupled enough toconstitute a morphic field. > Even if a genetic program convergence process can resonate with processes> occurring fleetingly in time previously, it seems likely that there will need> to be a much tighter coupling between the thing generating the source of> randomness (the quantum event generator) and the novel thing being produced.> Designing such experiments is fraught with difficulties, including keeping> track of previous solutions, so as to know whether a new solution is really> new; all preparatory work should be done solely with pseudo-random numbers.52> [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos828650] In morphic fields, all the different parts of the system are linked together andthe fields work by affecting random processes. The problem Rooke highlighted isthat the random numbers were fed into the computer, but the random numbergenerator was not linked to the system in any other way. To make it more closelycoupled, the random number generator would have to be affected by the processesit was itself affecting. One way to make a more closely coupled system,suggested by the mathematician Ralph Abraham, would be to use opticalfeedback—the simplest model being to point a video camera at a screen thatdisplays the output from the camera at low definition, leaving scope for randomnoise. But there may be a surprising new possibility. We are used to the idea that allcomputers are digital; but in the early days of computing, in the 1950s, analogcomputers were serious contenders for the path of the future. They enabledcomplex, self-organizing patterns of activity to develop through sometimeschaotic, oscillating circuits in electronic devices. William Ross Ashby, aBritish pioneer of cybernetics, published in 1952 an influential book calledDesign for a Brain, which showed how analog cybernetic circuits could modelbrain activity, including leaps from one state or level to another. Then digitalcomputers took over, and analog systems were forgotten. In a recent revival, the analog approach has led to astonishing results in thecreation of “living machines” in the form of insectlike analog robots. Thesemachines achieve feats of self-organization, and even of learning and memory,whose complexity belies the fact that these machines contain less than tentransistors and have no computers within them at all. Mark Tilden, the inventorof these machines, built electronic systems that rely on inputs from sensors asthe robots move. The activity of the wavelike, rhythmic circuits is partlychaotic and unpredictable, and is influenced by what has gone before. As Tildenput it, “When conditions are repeated exactly the same way twice, a digitalcomputer will respond in exactly the same way. These analog devices may or maynot do the same thing twice! You can influence them, but you don’t actually haveany power over them.”53 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos828831]Tilden’s work has inspired a new kind of “reaction-based” machine building,called BEAM robotics (Biology Electronics Aesthetics Mechanics, or BiotechnologyEthology Analogy Morphology). Can morphic fields be established in electronic machines? No one knows. But forresearch on this question, a good starting point might be self-organizing,wave-based analog robots that include truly random elements. If morphic fields were to come into being within such probabilistic analogsystems, they would automatically have an inherent memory, without the need forspecial memory-storage devices like hard drives and memory chips. They wouldalso enter into morphic resonance with similar computers around the world,without the need for communication through wires, cables, or radio signals. Theywould share a collective memory. An entirely new technology would be born. "},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX B image [images/00003.jpg] MORPHIC FIELDS AND THE IMPLICATE ORDER A Dialogue with David Bohm David Bohm was an eminent quantum physicist. As a young man, he worked closelywith Albert Einstein at Princeton University. With Yakir Aharonov he discoveredthe Aharonov-Bohm effect. He was later professor of theoretical physics atBirkbeck College, University of London, and was the author of several books,including Causality and Chance in Modern Physics1[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos829214]and Wholeness and the ImplicateOrder.2 [Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos829417]He died in 1992. Thisdialogue was first published in ReVision Journal, and the editorial notes are byRenée Weber, the journal’s editor.3[Morphic_Resonance_split_021.html#filepos829631]Bohm: Suppose we look at the development of the embryo, at those problems whereyou feel the present mechanistic approach doesn’t work. What would the theory ofmorphogenetic fields do that others don’t? Sheldrake: The developing organism would be within the morphogenetic field, andthe field would guide and control the form of the organism’s development. Thefield has properties not just in space but in time. Waddington demonstrated thiswith his concept of the chreode [see figure 5], represented by models of valleyswith balls rolling down them toward an end point. This model looks mechanisticwhen you first see it. But when you think about it for just a minute you see that this end point, whichthe ball is rolling down the valley toward, is in the future, and it is, as itwere, attracting the ball to it. Part of the strength of this model depends onthe fact that if you displace the marble up the sides of the valley, it willroll down again and reach the same end point; this represents the ability ofliving organisms to reach the same goal, even if you disrupt them—cut off a bitof embryo and it can grow back again; you’ll still reach the same end point. Bohm: In physics the Lagrangian law is rather similar; the Lagrangian falls intoa certain minimum level, as in the case of the chreode. It’s not an exactanalogy, but you could say that in some sense the classical atomic orbit arisesby following some sort of chreode. That’s one way classical physics could belooked at. And you could perhaps even introduce some notion of physicalstability on the basis of a chreode. But from the point of view of the implicateorder, I think you would have to say that this formative field is a whole set ofpotentialities, and that in each moment there’s a selection of which potentialis going to be realized, depending to some extent on the past history, and tosome extent on creativity. Sheldrake: But this set of potentialities is a limited set, because things dotend toward a particular end point. I mean cat embryos grow into cats, not dogs.So there may be variation about the exact course they can follow, but there isan overall goal or end point. Bohm: But there would be all sorts of contingencies that determine the actualcat. Sheldrake: Exactly. Contingencies of all kinds, environmental influences,possibly genuinely chance fluctuations. But nevertheless the end point of thechreode would define the general area in which it’s going to end up. Anyway, the point about Waddington’s concept of the chreode, which is takenquite seriously by lots of biologists, is that it already contains this idea ofend point, in the future, in time; and the structure, the very walls of thechreode, are not in any normal sense of the word material, physical things.Unfortunately Waddington didn’t define what they were. In my opinion, theyrepresent this process of formative causation through the morphogenetic field.Waddington in fact uses the term “morphogenetic field.” Now the problem withWaddington’s concept is that, when he was attacked by mechanists, who maintainedthat this was a mystical or ill-defined idea, he backed down and said, well,this is just a way of talking about normal chemical and physical interactions.René Thom, who took up the concepts of chreodes and morphogenetic fields anddeveloped them in topological models (where he called the end points“morphogenetic attractors”), tried to push Waddington into saying more exactlywhat the chreode was. Waddington, whenever pushed by anyone, even René Thom,backed down. So he left it in a very ambiguous state. Now Brian Goodwin and people like him see chreodes and morphogenetic fields asaspects of eternal Platonic forms; he has a rather Platonic metaphysics. He seesthese formative fields as eternally given archetypes, which are changeless andin some sense necessary. It is almost neo-Pythagorean; harmony, balance, form,and order can be generated from some fundamental mathematical principle, in somesort of necessary way, that acts as a causal factor in nature in an unexplainedbut changeless manner. The difference between that and what I’m saying is that I think thesemorphogenetic fields are built up causally from what’s happened before. So youhave this introjection, as it were, of explicit forms, to use your language, andthen projection again. Bohm: Yes. What you are talking about—the relation of past forms to presentones—is really related to the whole question of time—“How is time to beunderstood?” Now, in terms of the totality beyond time, the totality in whichall is implicate, what unfolds or comes into being in any present moment issimply a projection of the whole. That is, some aspect of the whole is unfoldedinto that moment and that moment is just that aspect. Likewise, the next momentis simply another aspect of the whole. And the interesting point is that eachmoment resembles its predecessors but also differs from them. I explain thisusing the technical terms “injection” and “projection.” Each moment is aprojection of the whole, as we said. But that moment is then injected orintrojected back into the whole. The next moment would then involve, in part, are-projection of that injection, and so on indefinitely. [Editor’s note: As asimplistic analogy, take the ocean and its waves: each wave arises or is“projected” from the whole of the ocean; that wave then dips back into theocean, or is “injected” back into the whole, and then the next wave arises. Eachwave is affected by past waves simply because they all rise and fall, or areprojected and injected, by the whole ocean. So there is a type of “causality”involved, but it is not that wave A linearly causes wave B, but that wave Ainfluences wave B by virtue of being absorbed back into the totality of theocean, which then gives rise to wave B. In Bohm’s terms, wave B is in part a“re-projection” of the “ injection” of wave A, and so on. Each wave wouldtherefore be similar to previous waves, but also different in certainaspects—exact size, shape, etc. Bohm is suggesting that there is a type of“causality,” but one that is mediated via the totality of the implicate ocean,and not merely via the separated, isolated, explicate waves. This means,finally, that such “causation” would be non-local, because what happens at anypart of the ocean would affect all other parts.] Each moment will thereforecontain a projection of the re-injection of the previous moments, which is akind of memory; so that would result in a general replication of past forms,which seems similar to what you’re talking about. [Editor’s note: This isaccording to Bohm’s reformulations of present-day quantum mechanics. In thefollowing discussion, Bohm will point out that present-day quantum mechanics, asit is usually interpreted, completely fails to account for the replication ofpast forms, or the notion of temporal process, a failure that in part led Bohmto propose “injection” and “projection” via the implicate order.] Sheldrake: So this re-injection into the whole from the past would mean there isa causal relationship between what happens in one moment and what subsequentlyhappens? Bohm: Yes, that is the causal relation. When abstracted from the implicateorder, there seems to be at least a tendency, not necessarily an exact causalrelationship, for a certain content in the past to be followed by a relatedcontent in the future. Sheldrake: Yes. So if something happens in one place at one time, what happensthere is then re-injected into the whole. Bohm: But it has been somewhat changed; it is not re-injected exactly, becauseit was previously projected. Sheldrake: Yes, it is somewhat changed, but it is fed back into the whole. Thatcan have an influence that, since it is mediated by the whole, can be feltsomewhere else. It doesn’t have to be local. Bohm: Right, it could be anywhere. Sheldrake: Well, that does sound very similar to the concept of morphicresonance, where things that happen in the past, even if they’re separated fromeach other in space and time, can influence similar things in the present, over,through, or across—however one cares to put it—space and time. There’s thisnon-local connection. This seems to me to be very important because it wouldmean that these fields have causal (but non-local) connections with things thathave happened before. They wouldn’t be somehow inexplicable manifestations of aneternal, timeless set of archetypes. Morphogenetic fields, which giverepetitions of habitual forms and patterns, would be derived from previousfields (what you call “cosmic memory”). The more often a particular form orfield happened, the more likely it would be to happen again, which is what I amtrying to express with this idea of morphic resonance and automatic averaging ofprevious forms. It’s this aspect of the theory that makes it empiricallytestable, because this aspect leads to predictions, such as: if rats learnsomething in one place, say a new trick, then rats everywhere else should beable to learn the same trick faster. That makes it different from Goodwin’stheory of eternal archetypes, which wouldn’t lead to that prediction, becausethey would always be the same. And this is where what I’m saying grows out ofthe tradition of thought that has been around in biology for sixty years, theidea of morphogenetic fields. These fields have always been very ill-defined,and have been interpreted either as Waddington did, to be just a way of speakingabout conventional mechanistic forces, or by a Goodwin-type metaphysicalapproach. Bohm: Yes. Now if we were to use the analogy of the radio wave receiver whichyou discussed in your book: if you take a receiver, it has the ability toamplify very small radio wave signals. As you say, we can regard the radio waveas a morphogenetic field. And the energy in the receiver (which comes from thewall socket) is being given shape or form by the information in the radio waveitself, so you get a musical sound coming out of the speaker. Now in that caseyou could say the radio wave possesses a very tiny energy compared to the energyin the radio coming from the wall socket. Thus, roughly speaking, there are twolevels of energy: one is a kind of energy that is unformed but which is subjectto being formed by very tiny impulses. The other is a field that is very muchmore subtle and which has very little energy in the usual sense of the word, buthas a quality of form that can be taken up by the energy of the radio receiver.The point is that one might look at the implicate order that way; the subtlerlevels of the implicate order are affecting the energy in the less subtlelevels. The implicate energies are very fine; they would not ordinarily even becounted as energies, and these implicate energies are giving rise to theproduction of electrons and protons and the various particles of physics. Andthese particles have been replicating so long that they are pretty welldetermined, or fixed in “cosmic memory.” Sheldrake: Yes, I think one could look at it that way. But whether thesemorphogenetic fields have a subtle energy or not, I don’t really know what tothink about that. When I wrote my book, I tried to draw a very sharp distinctionbetween formative causation and the ordinary kind of causation (energeticcausation), the kind that people are familiar with (e.g., pushing things,electricity), for two reasons: first, I wanted to make it clear that thisformative causation is a different kind of thing from what we usually think ofas causation. (It may not be so different when one takes into account causationthrough fields, as in physics.) But the second reason was that it is animportant part of my theory that these morphic fields can propagate across spaceand time, that past events could influence other events everywhere else. Now ifthese fields are conceived of as energetic, in any normal sense of the word,most people assume that they could only propagate locally according to some sortof inverse square law, because most known energies—light, gravity, magnetism,etc.—fade out over distance. Bohm: But that doesn’t necessarily follow, you see. One of the earlyinterpretations of the quantum theory I developed was in terms of a particlemoving in a field. Sheldrake: The quantum potential. Bohm: Yes. Now the quantum potential had many of the properties you ascribe tomorphogenetic fields and chreodes; that is, it guided the particle in some way,and there are often deep valleys and plateaus, and particles may start toaccumulate in plateaus and produce interference fringes. Now the interestingthing is that the quantum potential energy had the same effect regardless of itsintensity, so that even far away it may produce a tremendous effect; this effectdoes not follow an inverse square law. Only the form of the potential has aneffect, and not its amplitude or its magnitude. So we compared this to a shipbeing guided by radar; the radar is carrying form or information from allaround. It doesn’t, within its limits, depend on how strong the radio wave is.So we could say that in that sense the quantum potential is acting as aformative field on the movement of the electrons. The formative field could notbe put in three-dimensional [or local] space, it would have to be in a three-ndimensional space, so that there would be non-local connections, or subtleconnections of distant particles (which we see in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosenexperiment). So there would be a wholeness about the system such that theformative field could not be attributed to that particle alone; it can beattributed only to the whole, and something happening to faraway particles canaffect the formative field of other particles. There could thus be a [non-local]transformation of the formative field of a certain group to another group. So Ithink that if you attempt to understand what quantum mechanics means by such amodel, you get quite a strong analogy to a formative field. Sheldrake: Yes, it may even be a homology; it may be a different way of talkingabout the same thing. Bohm: The major difference is that quantum mechanics doesn’t treat time, andtherefore it hasn’t any way to account for the cumulative effect of past forms.To do so would require an extension of the way physics treats time, you see. Sheldrake: But don’t you get time in physics when you have a collapse of thewave function? Bohm: Yes, but that’s outside the framework of quantum physics today. Thatcollapse is not treated by any law at all, which means that the past is, as itwere, wiped out altogether. [Editor’s note: This is the point where, as earliermentioned, Bohm discusses some of the inadequacies of present-day quantummechanics—in particular, its incapacity to explain process, or the influence ofthe past on the present. He then suggests his re-formulations—injection,projection, the implicate order, etc.—that might remedy these inadequacies. Andthese re-formulations, apparently, are rather similar to Sheldrake’s theories.]You see, the present quantum mechanics does not have any concept of movement orprocess or continuity in time; it really deals with one moment only, oneobservation, and the probability that one observation will be followed byanother one. But there is obviously process in the physical world. Now I want tosay that that process can be understood from the implicate order as thisactivity of re-projection and re-injection. So, the theory of the implicateorder, carried this far, goes quite beyond present quantum mechanics. Itactually deals with process, which quantum mechanics does not, except byreference to an observing apparatus that in turn has to be referred to somethingelse. Sheldrake: Would you say that process at that level is a re-projection? Bohm: Yes. Sheldrake: And a re-injection at the same time? Bohm: Re-injection is exactly what the Schrödinger equation is describing. Andre-projection is the next step, which quantum mechanics doesn’t handle (exceptby the arbitrary assumption that the wave function “collapses” in a way that hasno place in the physical laws, such as Schrödinger’s equation). Now, there’s one other thing that modern quantum mechanics doesn’t handle. Oddlyenough, physics at present has no contact with the notion of actuality. You see,classical physics has at least some notion of actuality in saying that actualityconsists of a whole collection of particles that are moving and interacting in acertain way. Now, in quantum physics, there is no concept of actualitywhatsoever, because quantum physics maintains that its equations don’t describeanything actual, they merely describe the probability of what an observer couldsee if he had an instrument of a certain kind, and this instrument is thereforesupposed to be necessary for the actuality of the phenomenon. But theinstrument, in turn, is supposed to be made of similar particles, obeying thesame laws, which would, in turn, require another instrument to give themactuality. That would go on an infinite regress. Wigner has proposed to end the regress bysaying it is the consciousness of the actual observer that gives actuality toeverything. Sheldrake: But that doesn’t seem very satisfactory to me. Bohm: Nor to me, but apparently Wigner feels happy with this, as do some others.The point is, unless you extend quantum mechanics, there is no room in it foractuality, no room for any of the things you are talking about. So quantummechanics as it stands now, I want to say, is a very truncated, limited,abstracted set of formulae that gives certain limited results having to do withonly one moment of an experiment. But out of this truncated view, physicists aretrying to explain everything, you see; the whole thing simply has no meaning atall. Think about it: modern physics can’t even talk about the actual world! Sheldrake: But how do you think we can get to a concept of actuality? Bohm: Well, I think through the implicate order. We have a projection of thewhole to constitute a moment; a moment is a movement. And we can say that thatprojection is the actualization. In other words, the thing that physics doesn’tdiscuss is how various successive moments are related, and that’s what I say theimplicate order is attempting to do. If we extended quantum mechanics throughthe implicate order, we would bring in just that question of how past momentshave an effect on the present (i.e., via injection and re-projection). Atpresent, physics says the next moment is entirely independent, but with someprobability of being such and such. There’s no room in it for the sort of thingyou’re talking about, of having a certain accumulated effect of the past; butthe implicate order extension of quantum mechanics would have that possibility.And further, suppose somehow I were to combine the implicate order extension ofquantum mechanics [which would account for the accumulated effects of the past]with this quantum potential [which would account for these effects beingnon-local in nature], then I think I would get things very like what you aretalking about. Sheldrake: Yes, that would be very exciting! Of all the ways I’ve come across, Ithink that’s the most promising way of being able to mesh together these sort ofideas. I haven’t come across any other way that seems to show such possibleconnections. Bohm: If we can bring in time, and say that each moment has a certain field ofpotentials (represented by the Schrödinger equation) and also an actuality,which is more restricted (represented by the particle itself); and then say thatthe next moment has its potential and its actuality, and we must have someconnection between the actuality of the previous moments and the potentials ofthe next—that would be introjection, not of the wave function of the past, butof the actuality of the past into that field from which the present is going tobe projected. That would do exactly the sort of thing you’re talking about.Because then you could build up a series of actualities introjected that wouldnarrow down the field potential more and more, and these would form the basis ofsubsequent projections. That would account for the influence of the past on thepresent. Sheldrake: Yes, yes. Now how do you think this ties in with the alleged matterwaves in de Broglie’s equation? Bohm: That’s exactly where we started. These matter waves are the formativecause, and that was what de Broglie originally suggested. However, he wanted toregard the matter wave as just simply a real three-dimensional wave in time, andthat doesn’t work well. The formative field is a far better interpretation. Thequantum potential is the formative field that we derive from the generalized deBroglie waves. And we say that the particle is the actuality, affected by theformative field. The set of particles, the whole structure of all the particlesforming a system, is the actuality of that formative field. But that model by itself still ignores time, so the next step is to bring intime, to say that there’s a succession of moments of time in which there is arecurrent actuality. And we would say that what recurs is affected by theformative field. But then that formative field is affected by what haspreviously happened, actually. Now, that would help to remove most of theproblems in physics, if we can manage it. And it would tie up closely with thesort of thing that you’re talking about. See, at present we say that the wave function as potential spreads out very fastand then it suddenly collapses into some definite actual state for reasonstotally outside the theory. So we say it requires a piece of measuring apparatusto do so. Then another collapse, and the only continuity of this system would beachieved by an infinite set of measuring apparatuses that would keep it inobservation all the time, and these observation apparatuses in turn would haveto be observed to allow them to exist actually, and so on. And the whole thingvanishes in a fog of confusion. Because people take the present mathematics assacred, they say these equations in their general form are never to be altered,and then they say here we are with all these strange problems. But you seealmost no one wants to introduce anything fundamentally different into thisgeneral framework. Sheldrake: So the de Broglie interpretation is the way you’re thinking ofdeveloping. You’d have this recurrent actualization of something that iscontinually associated with the formative field. Bohm: And the present formative field is affected by past actualizations. In thepresent quantum mechanics there is no way to have the formative field affectedby anything at all, including the past, because there’s only one moment that youcan talk about. You can’t find anything that would affect the formative field,and that’s the problem. Sheldrake: Yes, I see. Now this is a closely related topic: what I’m talkingabout with morphogenetic fields has to do with physical forms and habitualpatterns of behavior. The connection of these ideas to the thought processitself is not obvious, although they’re certainly related. If you start framingthe whole topic in physical terms, as I do with morphogenetic fields, then youhave to speak in terms of morphic resonance, the influence of past forms onpresent ones through the morphogenetic field by a kind of resonance. If,however, you start using psychological language, and you start talking in termsof thought, then you’ve got a handier way of thinking of the influence of thepast, because with mental fields you have memory. And one can extend this memoryif one thinks of the whole universe as essentially thoughtlike, as manyphilosophical systems have done. You could say that if the whole universe isthought-like, then you automatically have a sort of cosmic memory developing.There are systems of thought that take exactly this view. One of them is aMahayana Buddhist system—the idea of the Alayavijnana, store consciousness, israther similar to the idea of cosmic memory. And the Theosophists I think tookover some of that in the idea of the Akashic record. The entire universe is, inone school of Hindu thought, Vishnu’s dream. Vishnu dreams the universe intobeing—it has the same kind of reality as a dream, and because Vishnu is along-lasting god, who goes on dreaming for a long time, it retains a certainconsistency. There’s memory within that dream; what he dreamed about in the pasttended to repeat itself, having its own laws and dynamics. All of those systemsof thought have memory built into them. So you could phrase the whole thing inpsychological language. But that doesn’t really help to make much contact withmodern physics and our modern scientific way of looking at the world. So, in asense, notions like the implicate order seem to be a better way of approachingthe problem, because implicate order is neutral in connotation. It is somethingthat can underlie both physical reality and thought. So it transcends the usualmaterialist-idealist dichotomy, which says either all of reality is thoughtlikeor all of reality is matterlike. The implicate order idea has the big advantageof transcending that distinction. Bohm: In fact its very essence is that transcendence. Sheldrake: If we take a broader view of creativity, we have the idea of theoverall evolutionary process; now that’s clearly a creative process. How do youthink that kind of evolutionary creativity is related to this model? Bohm: You could speculate that a great deal of life is the constant replicationof forms that are given with small variations, and that’s similar to ourexperience of thought: a constant replication of pattern within variation. Butthen we wonder, “How does it ever come about that we get variations—that we getbeyond that pattern?” Sheldrake: Yes, creative “jumps.” Bohm: “Jumps”—yes; you see we call it “jumps” when it’s projected into the fixedcategories of thought. If you were to say that there’s a proto-intelligence orimplicit intelligence in matter as it evolves, that it’s actually not movingcausally in a sequence but is constantly created and replicated, then there isroom for such a creative act to occur, and to project and introject a creativecontent. Sheldrake: The thing that’s involved in this creativity seems to be somethingthat links things together, a wholeness that embraces parts and sets uprelationships between them. They’re linked together within a new whole thatdidn’t exist before. In this creative realization, two previously separatethings have been linked together within a whole. Bohm: Yes. They’re now seen as mere aspects of the whole rather than independentexistences. You have realized a new whole, and from that realization you maycreate an external reality as well. Sheldrake: So the creative process, which gives rise to new thought, throughwhich new wholes are realized, is similar in that sense to the creative realitythat gives rise to new wholes in the evolutionary process. The creative processcould be seen as a successive development of more-complex and higher-levelwholes, through previously separate things being connected together. Bohm: And being realized now as not only independent parts but also aspects of agreater whole that has new qualities. Sheldrake: Right, and that realization of a greater whole is what actuallycreates the greater whole— Bohm: Yes, and it could even propose it, as in imagination, or a flash ofinsight, you realize the whole in the mind and you further realize it outside bywork. So you might suppose, say, that somehow nature realizes that it’s beingpresented with various things that now have to be brought together. Naturerealizes this greater whole at a deeper level, which is analogous toimagination, and then it unfolds it into the external environment. In a way, aflash of creative insight occurs in the biological system. Sheldrake: Exactly. Now do you think that these relations between things thatmake them part of the greater whole could, way back in time, have given rise tothe fundamental forces of physics? For example, could the gravitational forcesthat link together all matter have arisen through an original creative insightthat all matter was one? Bohm: One could say that in bringing together various things that previously hadbeen disparate, suddenly there was a realization of their oneness and thiscreated a new whole that is the universe, as we know it, anyway. We can say thatnature has an intent, you see, that is much deeper than what appears on thesurface. Sheldrake: Now, as to whether natural laws are eternally given or whether theyare gradually built up—how do you see that? Bohm: I think, in view of the implicate order, that the notion of formativefields gradually becoming necessary is what is called for. Even modern physicsis pointing to that idea by saying there was a time (i.e., prior to the bigbang) before any of these units (molecules, quarks, atoms), on which we arebasing the necessity, even existed. So, if you said there were certain fixed andeverlasting laws of the molecules and atoms, then what would you say if youtraced it back to the time before the atoms and molecules existed? Physics cansay nothing about that, right? It can say only that there was a formation ofthese particles at a certain stage. So there would have to be an actualdevelopment in which the necessity in a certain field grew more and more fixed.You can even see that happening as you cool down a substance that liquefies; atfirst you get little clumps of liquid that are transient, and then they getbigger and more determinate. Now physicists explain all this by saying that thelaws of the molecules are eternal; molecules are merely consequences of thoselaws, or derived from those laws. But if you follow that back and ask, “Wherewere molecules?”: well, they were originally protons and electrons, which wereoriginally quarks, which were originally sub-quarks. And it goes right back to astage where none of the units we know even existed, so the whole scheme sort offades out. It’s then open to you to say that, in general, fields of necessityare not eternal; they are constantly forming and developing. Sheldrake: I think that the current conventional and scientific picture hasn’treally faced up to this at all. You see, science started with a sort ofneo-Platonic, neo-Pythagorean notion—the idea of timeless laws— which has beentaken for granted in science for a very long time. I think that when theevolutionary theory in biology came in, it triggered the beginning of change. Wethen had an evolutionary view of reality regarding animals and plants, but itwas still considered that there was a timeless background of the physical world,the molecular and atomic world. Now we’ve gone to the cosmology of the big bang,which is widely accepted. So now we’ve got the idea of the entire universe asbeing a radically evolutionary universe. And this, I think, provokes a crisis,and should provoke a crisis. The idea of timeless laws that have always beenthere, somehow pervading space and time, ceases to have much meaning when youhave an actual historical big bang, because you then have this problem: wherewere the laws before the big bang? Bohm: There is also the belief, commonly accepted, that at the core of blackholes the laws as we know them would also vanish. As you say, scientists haven’tfaced up to it because they are still thinking in the old way, in terms oftimeless laws. But some physicists realize that. One cosmologist was giving atalk and he said, “Well, you know, I used to think everything was a law ofnature, and it’s all fixed, but as far as a black hole is concerned, anythingcan happen. You see, if it suddenly flashed a Coca-Cola sign, this would stillbe a possibility.” [Laughter.] So, the notion of timeless laws doesn’t seem tohold, because time itself is part of the necessity that developed. The blackhole doesn’t involve time and space as we know it; they all vanish. It’s notjust matter that vanishes, but any regular order that we know of vanishes, andtherefore you could say anything goes, or nothing goes. Sheldrake: The interesting thing about the big bang theory is that the minuteyou have to address the question of the origins of the laws of nature, you’reforced to recognize the philosophical assumptions underlying any sort ofscience. People who think of themselves as hard-nosed mechanists or pragmatistsregard metaphysics as a waste of time, a useless speculative activity, whereassupposedly they are practical scientists getting on with the job. But you canforce them to realize that their view of the laws of nature as being timeless,which is implicit in everything they say or think or do, is in fact ametaphysical view. And it’s one possible metaphysical view, it’s not the onlypossible one. I talk with biological friends, and they say, “Oh, what you’redoing is metaphysics.” So I say, “Wait a minute, let’s look at what you’redoing.” And then you confront them with the question of where were the laws ofnature before the big bang. And most of them say, “Well, they must have alwaysbeen there.” And you say, “Where? There’s no matter in any sense that we know ofbefore the big bang. Where were these laws of nature, sort of free-floating?”And they say, “Well, they must have been there somehow.” And then you say,“Don’t you think this is a rather metaphysical concept, in any literal sense ofmetaphysics, because it’s quite beyond existing physics?” They have to admit itsooner or later. As soon as you get into that sort of area, the certainty thatso many scientists think their view of the world is founded on simplydisappears. It becomes clear that current science presupposes uncritically onepossible kind of metaphysics. When one faces this, one can at least begin tothink about it rather than accepting one way of thinking about it asself-evident, taken for granted. And if one begins to think about it, one mightbe able to deepen one’s understanding of it.

Thisled one participant to observe that “the reductionist/antireductionist argumentsamong biologists may have as little relevance and impact on the direction ofbiology as similar arguments conducted in the abstract by philosophers.” F.

Although thisword is less obviously teleological, it is often used in much the same sense asthe genetic program. In a detailed analysis in Phenotype-Genotype Dichotomy,Lenartowicz has shown that if the genotype is simply identified with DNA, itsapparent explanatory value disappears. 9 [Morphic_Resonance_split_007.html#filepos107147] For a fuller discussion, seeSheldrake, “Three Approaches to Biology.

An essay I wrote around 1928 on “The Vitalist-Mechanist Controversy andthe Process of Abstraction” was never published.

Illustrations ofnumerous two-and three-dimensional patterns on vibrating surfaces can be foundin H. Jenny, Cymatics (Basel, Switzerland: Basileus Press, 1967), and A.Lauterwasser, Water Sound Images (Newmarket, N.H.: Macromedia Publishing, 2006).However, this effect is not comparable to the type of morphogenesis broughtabout through morphic resonance. 5 [Morphic_Resonance_split_011.html#filepos287486] For discussions of thepossibility of causal influences from future events, see M.

Formative Causation and Morphogenesis1 [Morphic_Resonance_split_012.html#filepos314874] It seems probable that animportant cause of aging, at least at the cellular level, is the buildup ofharmful waste products that cells are unable to eliminate. If cells grow fastenough, they can keep “one step ahead” of this buildup simply because thesesubstances are diluted by growth. Furthermore, in asymmetric cell divisions,which are common in higher animals and plants, these substances may be passed onunequally to the daughter cells: one may be rejuvenated at the expense of theincreased mortality of the other. Thus, rejuvenation depends on growth and celldivision: morphogenetic end points—the differentiated cells, tissues, and organsof multicellular organisms—are necessarily mortal, as noted in Sheldrake, “TheAgeing, Growth and Death of Cells.” 2 [Morphic_Resonance_split_012.html#filepos316926] For animal examples, see P.Weiss, Principles of Development (New York: Holt, 1939); for plants, see C. W.Wardlaw, Organization and Evolution in Plants (London: Longmans, 1965). 3 [Morphic_Resonance_split_012.html#filepos322119] The classic discussion ofthis elementary but important point is in the chapter titled “On Magnitude” inD’Arcy W. Thompson, On Growth and Form (Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge UniversityPress, 1942). 4 [Morphic_Resonance_split_012.html#filepos327966] If the system “identifies”itself with a particular location and if its persistence at that locationdepends on morphic resonance with itself in the immediate past, its resistanceto being moved from that location—its inertial mass—should be related to thefrequency with which this self-resonance occurs, for resonance depends oncharacteristic cycles of vibration; it cannot occur in an instant because acycle of vibration takes time. The higher the frequency of vibration, the morerecent will be the past states with which self-resonance occurs; thus, thegreater will be the tendency of the system to be “tied” to its position in theimmediate past. Conversely, the lower the frequency of vibration, the lessstrong will be the tendency of a system to “identify” itself with itself at aparticular location: it will be able to move farther relative to other objectsbefore it “notices” that it has done so. 5 [Morphic_Resonance_split_012.html#filepos329658] Karl Popper, among others,has argued that talking of a dualism of particle and wave has led to muchconfusion, and has suggested that the term dualism should be abandoned: “Ipropose that we speak instead (as did Einstein) of the particle and itsassociated propensity fields (the plural indicates that the fields depend notonly on the particle but also on other conditions), thus avoiding the suggestionof a symmetrical relation. Without establishing some such terminology as this(‘association’ in place of ‘dualism’), the term dualism is bound to survive,with all the misconceptions connected with it; for it does point to somethingimportant: the association that exists between particles and fields ofpropensities.” K. R. Popper, “Quantum Mechanics without ‘the Observer,’” inQuantum Theory and Reality, ed. M. Bunge (Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1967), 41.This proposal would appear to harmonize well with the hypothesis of formativecausation if propensity fields are taken to include morphogenetic fields.

Rhine and W.McDougall, “Third Report on a Lamarckian Experiment,” British Journal ofPsychology 24 (1933): 223. 15 [Morphic_Resonance_split_017.html#filepos514749] A number of possibleexplanations were suggested at the time these experiments were being carriedout; they are discussed in McDougall’s papers, to which the interested readershould refer. None of these explanations turned out to be plausible on closerexamination. Agar and colleagues noticed that fluctuations in the rates oflearning were associated with changes, extending over several generations, inthe health and vigor of the rats; see W. E. Agar, et al., “Fourth (final) Reporton a Test of McDougall’s Lamarckian Experiment on the Training of Rats,” Journalof Experimental Biology 31 (1954): 307–21. McDougall had already noted a similareffect. A statistical analysis showed that there was indeed a low butsignificant (at the 1 percent level of probability) correlation between vigor(measured in terms of fertility) and learning rates in the “trained” line, butnot in the “untrained” line. However, if only the first forty generations wereconsidered, the coefficients of correlation were somewhat higher: 0.40 in thetrained line and 0.42 in the untrained. While this correlation may help toaccount for the fluctuations in the results, it cannot plausibly explain theoverall trend. According to standard statistical theory, the proportion of thevariation that is “explained” by a correlated variable is given by the square ofthe correlation coefficient, in this case (0.4)2 = 0.16. In other words,variations in vigor account for only 16 percent of the changes in the rate oflearning. 16 [Morphic_Resonance_split_017.html#filepos516964] McDougall estimated that theaverage number of errors in his first generation was more than 165. In Crew’sexperiment, this figure was 24, and in Agar’s, 72; see the discussions in F. A.E. Crew, “A Repetition of McDougall’s Lamarckian Experiment,” Journal ofGenetics 33 (1936): 61–101; and W. E. Agar, et al., “Fourth (final) Report on aTest of McDougall’s Lamarckian Experiment on the Training of Rats,” Journal ofExperimental Biology 31 (1954): 307–21. If Agar’s group had used rats ofidentical parentage and followed the same procedures as Crew, their initialscore might have been expected to be even lower than his. However, owing to thedifferent parentage of their rats and to differences in their testing procedure,the results are not fully comparable. Nevertheless, the greater facility oflearning in these later experiments is suggestive. 17 [Morphic_Resonance_split_017.html#filepos518272] J. L.

Chapter 12. Four Possible Conclusions1 [Morphic_Resonance_split_018.html#filepos536059] Some versions of thephilosophy of dialectical materialism would probably provide a good startingpoint for the development of a modified materialism in this sense. They alreadyinclude many aspects of the organismic approach and are based on the idea thatreality is inherently evolutionary; see L. A. Graham, Science and Philosophy inthe Soviet Union (New York, Knopf, 1972), 332. 2 [Morphic_Resonance_split_018.html#filepos536738] For a historical account andcritical discussion of the various materialist theories, see K. R. Popper, inThe Self and Its Brain, K. R. Popper and J. C. Eccles, eds. (Berlin: SpringerInternational, 1977). 3 [Morphic_Resonance_split_018.html#filepos538418] The hypothesis that bothtelepathy and memory might be explicable in terms of a new type oftrans-temporal and trans-spatial resonance between similar complex systems hasin fact already been put forward by Marshall in “ESP and Memory: A PhysicalTheory”; indeed, his suggestion anticipates in several important respects theidea of morphic resonance. For a discussion of the role of morphic fields inanimal and human telepathy, see my books Dogs That Know When Their Owners AreComing Home and The Sense of Being Stared At. 4 [Morphic_Resonance_split_018.html#filepos538588] Although telepathy andpsychokinesis might conceivably be explicable in terms of formative causation,it is difficult to see how this hypothesis could help to account for certainother phenomena, such as clairvoyance, that seem to pose insurmountable problemsfor any physical theory. For a review of various theories, physical andnonphysical, that have been proposed to account for the phenomena ofparapsychology, see K. R.

Jouvet, “The States ofSleep,” Scientific American 216 (2) (1967): 62–72. 8 [Morphic_Resonance_split_018.html#filepos545546] Two different types ofdualistic or vitalist theory can be recognized in the light of thisclassification. The first, exemplified in the writings of Driesch, postulatedthe existence of a new type of causation responsible for repetitive and regularbiological processes, corresponding to formative causation in the present sense;see H. Driesch, Science and Philosophy of the Organism, 2nd ed., first published1908 (London: A. & C. Black, 1929), and H. Driesch, Mind and Body (London:Methuen, 1927). The second, developed most brilliantly by Bergson, emphasizedconscious causation on the one hand, in H. Bergson, Matter and Memory (London:Allen and Unwin, 1911), and evolutionary creativity on the other, in H. Bergson,Creative Evolution (London: Macmillan, 1911), neither of which could beexplained in terms of physical causes. 9 [Morphic_Resonance_split_018.html#filepos548952] H.
