As a child I kept many kindsof animals, ranging from caterpillars and tadpoles to pigeons, rabbits,tortoises and a dog. My father, a herbalist, pharmacist and microscopist, taughtme about plants from my earliest years. He showed me a world of wonders throughhis microscope, including tiny creatures in drops of pond water, scales onbutterflies’ wings, shells of diatoms, cross-sections of plant stems and asample of radium that glowed in the dark. I collected plants and read books onnatural history, like Fabre’s Book of Insects, which told the life stories ofscarab beetles, praying mantises and glow-worms. By the time I was twelve yearsold I wanted to become a biologist.I studied sciences at school and then at Cambridge University, where I majoredin biochemistry. I liked what I was doing, but found the focus very narrow, andwanted to see a bigger picture. I had a life-changing opportunity to widen myperspective when I was awarded a Frank Knox fellowship in the graduate school atHarvard, where I studied the history and philosophy of science.I returned to Cambridge to do research on the development of plants. In thecourse of my PhD project, I made an original discovery: dying cells play a majorpart ieaten the regulation of plant growth, releasing the plant hormone auxin asthey break down in the process of ‘programmed cell death’. Inside growingplants, new wood cells dissolve themselves as they die, leaving their cellulosewalls as microscopic tubes through which water is conducted in stems, roots andveins of leaves. I discovered that auxin is produced as cells die,1[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1116597] that dyingcells stimulate more growth; more growth leads to more death, and hence to moregrowth.After receiving my PhD, I was elected to a research fellowship of Clare College,Cambridge, where I was director of studies in cell biology and biochemistry,teaching students in tutorials and lab classes. I was then appointed a researchfellow of the Royal Society and continued my research at Cambridge on planthormones, studying the way in which auxin is transported from the shoots towardsthe root tips. With my colleague Philip Rubery, I worked out the molecular basisof polar auxin transport,2[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1117042] providing afoundation on which much subsequent research on plant polarity has been built.Funded by the Royal Society, I spent a year at the University of Malaya,studying rain forest ferns, and at the Rubber Research Institute of Malaya Idiscovered how the flow of latex in rubber trees is regulated genetically, and Ished new light on the development of latex vessels.3[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1117473]When I returned to Cambridge, I developed a new hypothesis of ageing in plantsand animals, including humans. All cells age. When they stop growing, theyeventually die. My hypothesis is about rejuvenation, and proposes that harmfulwaste products build up in all cells, causing them to age, but they can producerejuvenated daughter cells by asymmetric cell divisions in which one cellreceives most of these waste products and is doomed, while the other is wipedclean. The most rejuvenated of all cells are eggs. In both plants and animals,two successive cell divisions (meiosis) produce an egg cell and three sistercells, which quickly die. My hypothesis was published in Nature in 1974 in apaper called ‘The ageing, growth and death of cells’.4[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1117902] ‘Programmedcell death’, or ‘apoptosis’, has since become a major field of research,important for our understanding of diseases such as cancer and HIV, as well astissue regeneration through stem cells. Many stem cells divide asymmetrically,producing a new, rejuvenated stem cell and a cell that differentiates, ages anddies. My hypothesis is that the rejuvenation of stem cells through cell divisiondepends on their sisters paying the price of mortality.Wanting to broaden my horizons and do practical research that could benefit someof the world’s poorest people, I left Cambridge to join the International CropsResearch Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, near Hyderabadellar Hyde, India,as Principal Plant Physiologist, working on chickpeas and pigeonpeas.5[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1118322] We bred newhigh-yielding varieties of these crops, and developed multiple cropping systems6[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1118742] that are nowwidely used by farmers in Asia and Africa, greatly increasing yields.A new phase in my scientific career began in 1981 with the publication of mybook A New Science of Life, in which I suggested a hypothesis of form-shapingfields, called morphogenetic fields, that control the development of animalembryos and the growth of plants. I proposed that these fields have an inherentmemory, given by a process called morphic resonance. This hypothesis wassupported by the available evidence and gave rise to a range of experimentaltests, summarised in the new edition of A New Science of Life (2009).After my return to England from India, I continued to investigate plantdevelopment, and also started research with homing pigeons, which had intriguedme since I kept pigeons as a child. How do pigeons find their way home fromhundreds of miles away, across unfamiliar terrain and even across the sea? Ithought they might be linked to their home by a field that acted like aninvisible elastic band, pulling them homewards. Even if they have a magneticsense as well, they cannot find their home just by knowing compass directions.If you were parachuted into unknown territory with a compass, you would knowwhere north was, but not where your home was.I came to realise that pigeon navigation was just one of many unexplained powersof animals. Another was the ability of some dogs to know when their owners arecoming home, seemingly telepathically. It was not difficult or expensive to doresearch on these subjects, and the results were fascinating. In 1994 Ipublished a book called Seven Experiments that Could Change the World in which Iproposed low-cost tests that could change our ideas about the nature of reality,with results that were summarised in a new edition (2002), and in my books DogsThat Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home (1999; new edition 2011) and TheSense of Being Stared Atoneng Star (2003).For the last twenty years I have been a Fellow of the Institute of NoeticSciences, near San Francisco, and a visiting professor at several universities,including the Graduate Institute in Connecticut. I have published more thaneighty papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals, including several in Nature.I belong to a range of scientific societies, including the Society forExperimental Biology and the Society for Scientific Exploration, and I am afellow of the Zoological Society and the Cambridge Philosophical Society. I giveseminars and lectures on my research at a wide variety of universities, researchinstitutes and scientific conferences in Britain, continental Europe, North andSouth America, India and Australasia.I have spent all my adult life as a scientist, and I strongly believe in theimportance of the scientific approach. Yet I have become increasingly convincedthat the sciences have lost much of their vigour, vitality and curiosity.Dogmatic ideology, fear-based conformity and institutional inertia areinhibiting scientific creativity.With scientific colleagues, I have been struck over and over again by thecontrast between public and private discussions. In public, scientists are veryaware of the powerful taboos that restrict the range of permissible topics; inprivate they are often more adventurous.I have written this book because I believe that the sciences will be moreexciting and engaging when they move beyond the dogmas that restrict freeenquiry and imprison imaginations.Many people have contributed to these explorations through discussions, debates,arguments and advice, and I cannot begin to mention everyone to whom I amindebted. This book is dedicated to all those who have helped and encouraged me.I am grateful for the financial support that has enabled me to write this book:from Trinity College, Cambridge, where I was the Perrott-Warrick SeniorResearcher from 2005 to 2010; from Addison Fischer and the Planet HeritageFoundation; and from the Watson Family Foundation and the Institute of NoeticSciences.

They touch all our lives through technologies and throughmodern medicine. Our intellectual world has been transformed by an immenseexpansion of knowledge, down into the most microscopic particles of matter andout into the vastness of space, with hundreds of billions of galaxies in anever-expanding universe.Yet in the second decade of the twenty-first century, when science andtechnology seem to be at the peak of their power, when their influence hasspread all over the world and when their triumph seems indisputable, unexpectedproblems are disrupting the sciences from within. Most scientists take it forgranted that these problems will eventually be solved by more research alongestablished lines, but some, including myself, think they are symptoms of adeeper malaise.In this book, I argue that science is being held back by centuries-oldassumptions that have hardened into dogmas. The sciences would be better offwithout them: freer, more interesting, and more fun. The biggest scientific delusion of all is that science already knows theanswers. The details still need working out but, in principle, the fundamentalquestions are settled.Contemporary science is based on the claim that all reality is material orphysical. There is no reality but material reality. Consciousness is aby-product of the physical activity of the brain. Matter is unconscious.Evolution is purposeless. God exists only as an idea in human minds, and hencein human heads.These beliefs are powerful, not because most scientists think about themcritically but because they don’t. The facts of science are real enough; so arethe techniques that scientists use, and the technologies based on them. But thebelief system that governs conventional scientific thinking is an act of faith,grounded in a nineteenth-century ideology.This book is pro-science. I want the sciences to be less dogmatic and morescientific. I believe that the sciences will be regenerated when they areliberated from the dogmas that constrict them.The scientific creed Here are the ten core beliefs that most scientists take for granted. > 1. Everything is essentially mechanical. Dogs, for example, are> complex mechanisms, rather than living organisms with goals of their own. Even> people are machines, ‘lumbering robots’, in Richard Dawkins’s vivid phrase,> with brains that are like genetically programmed computers.> 2. All matter is unconscious. It has no inner life or subjectivity or> point of view. Even human consciousness is an illusion produced by the> material activities of brains.> 3. The total amount of matter and energy is always the same (with the> exception of the Big Bang, when all the matter and energy of the universe> suddenly appeared).> 4. The laws of nature are fixed. They are the same today as they were> at the beginning, and they will stay the same for ever.> 5. Nature is purposeless, and evolution has no goal or direction.> 6. All biological inheritance is material, carried in the genetic> material, DNA, and in other material structures.> 7. Minds are inside heads and are nothing but the activities of> brains. When you look at a tree, the image of the tree you are seeing is not> ‘out there’, where it seems to be, but inside your brain.> 8. Memories are stored as material traces in brains and are wiped out> at death.> 9. Unexplained phenomena like telepathy are illusory.> 10. Mechanistic medicine is the only kind that really works.> Together, these beliefs make up the philosophy or ideology of materialism, whosecentral assumption is that everything is essentially material or physical, evenminds. This belief-system became dominant within science in the late nineteenthcentury, and is now taken for granted. Many scientists are unaware thatmaterialism is an assumption: they simply think of it as science, or thescientific view of reality, or the scientific worldview. They are not actuallytaught about it, or given a chance to discuss it. They absorb it by a kind ofintellectual osmosis.In everyday usage, materialism refers to a way of life >In the spirit of radical scepticism, I turn each of these ten doctrines into aquestion. Entirely new vistas open up when a widely accepted assumption is takenas the beginning of an enquiry, rather than as an unquestionable truth. Forexample, the assumption that nature is machine-like or mechanical becomes aquestion: ‘Is nature mechanical?’ The assumption that matter is unconsciousbecomes ‘Is matter unconscious?’ And so on.In the Prologue I look at the interactions of science, religion and power, andthen in Chapters 1 to 10, I examine each of the ten dogmas. At the end of eachchapter, I discuss what difference this topic makes and how it affects the waywe live our lives. I also pose several further questions, so that any readerswho want to discuss these subjects with friends or colleagues will have someuseful starting points. Each chapter is followed by a summary.The credibility crunch for the ‘scientific worldview’ For more than two hundred years, materialists have promised that science willeventually explain everything in terms of physics and chemistry. Science willprove that living organisms are complex machines, minds are nothing but brainactivity and nature is purposeless. Believers are sustained by the faith thatscientific discoveries will justify their beliefs. The philosopher of scienceKarl Popper called this stance ‘promissory materialism’ because it depends onissuing promissory notes for discoveries not yet made.1[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1119341] Despite allthe achievements of science and technology, materialism is now facing acredibility crunch that was unimaginable in the twentieth century.In 1963, when I was studying biochemistry at Cambridge University, I was invitedto a series of private meetings with Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner inBrenner’s rooms in King’s College, along with a few of my classmates. Crick andBrenner had recently helped to ‘crack’ the genetic code. Both were ardentmaterialists and Crick was also a militant atheist. They explained there weretwo major unsolved problems in biology: development and consciousness. They hadnot been solved because the people who worked on them were not molecularbiologists – or very bright. Crick and Brenner were going to find the answerswithin ten years, or maybe twenty. Brenner would take developmental biology, andCrick consciousness. They invited us to join them.Both tried their best. Brenner was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2002 for his workon the development of a tiny worcovf a tinm, Caenorhabdytis elegans. Crickcorrected the manuscript of his final paper on the brain the day before he diedin 2004. At his funeral, his son Michael said that what made him tick was notthe desire to be famous, wealthy or popular, but ‘to knock the final nail intothe coffin of vitalism’. (Vitalism is the theory that living organisms are trulyalive, and not explicable in terms of physics and chemistry alone.)Crick and Brenner failed. The problems of development and consciousness remainunsolved. Many details have been discovered, dozens of genomes have beensequenced, and brain scans are ever more precise. But there is still no proofthat life and minds can be explained by physics and chemistry alone (seeChapters 1, 4 and 8).The fundamental proposition of materialism is that matter is the only reality.Therefore consciousness is nothing but brain activity. It is either like ashadow, an ‘epiphenomenon’, that does nothing, or it is just another way oftalking about brain activity. However, among contemporary researchers inneuroscience and consciousness studies there is no consensus about the nature ofminds. Leading journals such as Behavioural and Brain Sciences and the Journalof Consciousness Studies publish many articles that reveal deep problems withthe materialist doctrine. The philosopher David Chalmers has called the veryexistence of subjective experience the ‘hard problem’. It is hard because itdefies explanation in terms of mechanisms. Even if we understand how eyes andbrains respond to red light, the experience of redness is not accounted for.In biology and psychology the credibility rating of materialism is falling. Canphysics ride to the rescue? Some materialists prefer to call themselvesphysicalists, to emphasise that their hopes depend on modern physics, notnineteenth-century theories of matter. But physicalism’s own credibility ratinghas been reduced by physics itself, for four reasons.First, some physicists insist that quantum mechanics cannot be formulatedwithout taking into account the minds of observers. They argue that minds cannotbe reduced to physics because physics presupposes the minds of physicists.2[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1119772]Second, the most ambitious unified theories of physical reality, string andM-theories, with ten and eleven dimensions respectively, take science intocompletely new territory. Strangely, as Stephen Hawking tells us in his book TheGrand Design (2010), ‘No one seems to know what the “M” stands for, but it maybe “master”, “miracle” or “mystery”.’ According to what Hawking calls‘model-dependent realism’, different theories may have to be applied indifferent situations. ‘Each theory may have its own version of reality, butaccording to model-dependent realism, that is acceptable so long as the theoriesagree in their predictions whenever they overlap, that is, whenever they canboth be applied.’3[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1120201]String theories and M-theories are currently untestable so ‘model-dependentrealism’ can only be judged by reference to other models, rather than byexperiment. It also applies to countless other universes, none of which has everbeen observed. As Hawking points out, > M-theory has solutions that allow for different universes with different> apparent laws, depending on how the internal space is curled. M-theory has> solutions that allow for many different internal spaces, perhaps as many as> 10500, which means it allows for 10500 different universes, each with its own> laws . . . The original hope of physics to produce a single theory explaining> the apparent laws of our universe as the unique possible consequence of a few> simple assumptions may have to be abandoned.4> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1120765] Some physicists are deeply sceptical about this entire approach, as thetheoretical physicist Lee Smolin shows in his book The Trouble With Physics: TheRise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science and What Comes Next (2008).5[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1121313] Stringtheories, M-theories and ‘model-dependent realism’ are a shaky foundation formaterialism or physicalism or any other belief system, as discussed in Chapter1.Third, since the beginning of the twenty-first century, it has become apparentthat the known kinds of matter and energy make up only about four per cent ofthe universe. The rest consists of ‘dark matter’ and ‘dark energyand rk ener.The nature of 96 per cent of physical reality is literally obscure (see Chapter2).Fourth, the Cosmological Anthropic Principle asserts that if the laws andconstants of nature had been slightly different at the moment of the Big Bang,biological life could never have emerged, and hence we would not be here tothink about it (see Chapter 3). So did a divine mind fine-tune the laws andconstants in the beginning? To avoid a creator God emerging in a new guise, mostleading cosmologists prefer to believe that our universe is one of a vast, andperhaps infinite, number of parallel universes, all with different laws andconstants, as M-theory also suggests. We just happen to exist in the one thathas the right conditions for us.6[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1121730]This multiverse theory is the ultimate violation of Occam’s Razor, thephilosophical principle that ‘entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity’,or in other words, that we should make as few assumptions as possible. It alsohas the major disadvantage of being untestable.7[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1122291] And it doesnot even succeed in getting rid of God. An infinite God could be the God of aninfinite number of universes.8[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1122707]Materialism provided a seemingly simple, straightforward worldview in the latenineteenth century, but twenty-first-century science has left it behind. Itspromises have not been fulfilled, and its promissory notes have been devalued byhyperinflation.I am convinced that the sciences are being held back by assumptions that havehardened into dogmas, maintained by powerful taboos. These beliefs protect thecitadel of established science, but act as barriers against open-mindedthinking."},{"pageContent":"Prologue Science, Religion and Power Since the late nineteenth century, science has dominated and transformed theearth. It has touched everyone’s lives through technology and modern medicine.Its intellectual prestige is almost unchallenged. Its influence is greater thanthat of any other system of thought in all of human history. Although most ofits power comes from its practical applications, it also has a strongintellectual appeal. It offers new ways of understanding the world, includingthe mathematical order at the heart of atoms and molecules, the molecularbiology of genes, and the vast sweep of cosmic evolution.The scientific priesthoodnd.div>Francis Bacon (1561–1626), a politician and lawyer who became Lord Chancellor ofEngland, foresaw the power of organised science more than anyone else. To clearthe way, he needed to show that there was nothing sinister about acquiring powerover nature. When he was writing, there was a widespread fear of witchcraft andblack magic, which he tried to counteract by claiming that knowledge of naturewas God-given, not inspired by the devil. Science was a return to the innocenceof the first man, Adam, in the Garden of Eden before the Fall.Bacon argued that the first book of the Bible, Genesis, justified scientificknowledge. He equated man’s knowledge of nature with Adam’s naming of theanimals. God ‘brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them, and whatAdam called every living creature, that was the name thereof’. (Genesis 2:19–20) This was literally man’s knowledge, because Eve was not created until twoverses later. Bacon argued that man’s technological mastery of nature was therecovery of a God-given power, rather than something new. He confidently assumedthat people would use their new knowledge wisely and well: ‘Only let the humanrace recover that right over nature which belongs to it by divine bequest; theexercise thereof will be governed by sound reason and true religion.’1[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1123568]The key to this new power over nature was organised institutional research. InNew Atlantis (1624), Bacon described a techno cratic Utopia in which ascientific priesthood made decisions for the good of the state as a whole. TheFellows of this scientific ‘Order or Society’ wore long robes and were treatedwith a respect that their power and dignity required. The head of the ordertravelled in a rich chariot, under a radiant golden image of the sun. As he rodein procession, ‘he held up his bare hand, as he went, as blessing the people’.The general purpose of this foundation was ‘the knowledge of causes and secretmotions of things; and the enlarging of human empire, to the effecting of allthings possible’. The Society was equipped with machinery and facilities fortesting explosives and armaments, experimental furnaces, gardens for plantbreeding, and dispensaries.2[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1123985]This visionary scientific institution foreshadowed many features ofinstitutional research, and was a direct inspiration for the founding of theRoyal Society in London in 1660, and for many other national academies ofscience. But although the members of these academies were often held in highesteem, none achieved the grandeur and political power of Bacon’s imaginaryprototypes. Their glory was continued even after their deaths in a gallery, likea Hall of Fame, where their images were preserved. ‘For upon every invention ofvalue we erect a statue to the inventor, and give him a liberal and honourablereward.’3 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1124666]In England in Bacon’s time (and still today) the Church of England was linked tothe state as the Established Church. Bacon envisaged that the scientificpriesthood would also be linked to the state through state patronage, forming akind of established church of science. And here again he was prophetic. Innations both capitalist and Communist, the official academies of science remainthe centres of power of the scientific establishment. There is no separation ofscience and state. Scientists play the role of an established priesthood,influencing government policies on the arts of warfare, industry, agriculture,medicine, education and research.Bacon coined the ideal slogan for soliciting financial support from governmentsand investors: ‘Knowledge is power.’4[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1125084] But thesuccess of scientists in eliciting funding from governments varied from countryto country. The systematic state funding of science began much earlier in Franceand Germany than in Britain and the United States where, until the latter halfof the nineteenth century, most research was privately funded or carried out bywealthy amateurs like Charles Darwin.5[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1125633]In France, Louis Pasteur (1822–95) was an influential proponent of science as atruth-finding religion, with laboratories like temples through which mankindwould be elevated to its highest potential: > Take interest, I beseech you, in those sacred institutions which we designate> under the expressive name of laboratories. Demand that they be multiplied and> adorned; they are the temples of wealth and of the future. There it is that> humanity grows, becomes stronger and better.6> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1126051] By the beginning of the twentieth century, science was almost entirelyinstitutionalised and professionalised, and after the Second World War expandedenormously under government patronage, as well as through corporate investment.7[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1126601] The highestlevel of funding is in the United States, where in 2008 the total expenditure onresearch and development was $398 billion, of which $104 billion came from thegovernment.8 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1126894]But governments and corporations do not usually pay scientists to do researchbecause they want innocent knowledge, like that of Adam before the Fall. Naminganimals, as in classifying endangered species of beetles in tropicalrainforests, is a low priority. Most funding is a response to Bacon’s persuasiveslogan ‘knowledge is power’.By the 1950s, when institutional science had reached an unprecedented level ofpower and prestige, the historian of science George Sarton approvingly describedthe situation in a way that sounds like the Roman Catholic Church before theReformation: > Truth can be determined only by the judgement of experts . . .

But his confidence that man’s power over nature would be guided by ‘soundreason and true religion’ was misplaced.The fantasy of omniscience The fantasy of omniscience is a recurrent theme in the history of science, asscientists aspire to a total godlike knowledge. At the beginning of thenineteenth century, the French physicist Pierre-Simon Laplace imagined ascientific mind capable of knowing and predicting everything: > Consider an intelligence which, at any instant, could have a knowledge of all> the forces controlling nature together with the momentary conditions of all> the entities of which nature consists. If this intelligence were powerful> enough to submit all these data to analysis it would be able to embrace in a> single formula the movements of the largest bodies in the universe and those> of the lightest atoms; for it nothing would be uncertain; the past and future> would be equally present for its eyes.10> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1128007] These ideas were not confined to physicists. Thomas Henry Huxley, who did somuch to propagate Darwin’s theory of evolution, extended mechanical determinismto cover the entire evolutionary process: > If the fundamental proposition of evolution is true, that the entire world,> living and not living, is the result of the mutual interaction, according to> definite laws, of the forces possessed by the molecules of which the primitive> nebulosity of the universe was composed, it is no less certain the existing> world lay, potentially, in the cosmic vapour, and that a sufficient intellect> could, from a knowledge of the properties of the molecules of that vapour,> have predicted, say, the state of the fauna of Great Britain in 1869.11> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1128552] When the belief in determinism was applied to the activity of the human brain,it resulted in a denial of free will, on the grounds that everything about themolecular and physical activities of the brain was in principle predictable. Yetthis conviction rested not on scientific evidence, but simply on the assumptionthat everything was fully determined by mathematical laws.Even today, many scientists assume that free will is an illusion. Not only isthe activity of the brain determined by machine-like processes, but there is nonon-mechanical self capable of making choices. For example, in 2010, the Britishbrain scientist Patrick Haggard asserted, ‘As a neuroscientist, you’ve got to bea determinist. There are physical laws, which the electrical and chemical eventsin the brain obey. Under identical circumstances, you couldn’t have doneotherwise. There’s no “I” which can say, “I want to do otherwise.” ’12[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1128831] However,Haggard does not let his scientific beliefs interfere with his personal life: ‘Ikeep my scientific and personal lives pretty separate. I still seem to decidewhat films I go to see, I don’t feel it’s predestined, though it must bedetermined somewhere in my brain.’Indeterminism and chance In 1927, with the recognition of the uncertainty principle in quantum physics,it became clear that indeterminism was an essential feature of the physicalworld, and physical predictions could be made only in terms of probabilities.The fundamental reason is that quantum phenomena are wavelike, and a wave is byits very nature spread out in \"juread ouspace and time: it cannot be localisedat a single point at a particular instant; or, more technically, its positionand momentum cannot both be known precisely.13[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1129245] Quantum theorydeals in statistical probabilities, not certainties. The fact that onepossibility is realised in a quantum event rather than another is a matter ofchance.Does quantum indeterminism affect the question of free will? Not ifindeterminism is purely random. Choices made at random are no freer than if theyare fully determined.14[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1129796]In neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory randomness plays a central role through thechance mutations of genes, which are quantum events. With different chanceevents, evolution would happen differently. T. H. Huxley was wrong in believingthat the course of evolution was predictable. ‘Replay the tape of life,’ saidthe evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould, ‘and a different set of survivorswould grace our planet today.’15[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1130210]In the twentieth century it became clear that not just quantum processes butalmost all natural phenomena are probabilistic, including the turbulent flow ofliquids, the breaking of waves on the seashore, and the weather: they show aspontaneity and indeterminism that eludes exact prediction. Weather forecastersstill get it wrong in spite of having powerful computers and a continuous streamof data from satellites. This is not because they are bad scientists but becauseweather is intrinsically unpredictable in detail. It is chaotic, not in theeveryday sense that there is no order at all, but in the sense that it is notprecisely predictable. To some extent, the weather can be modelledmathematically in terms of chaotic dynamics, sometimes called ‘chaos theory’,but these models do not make exact predictions.16[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1130622] Certainty isas unachievable in the everyday world as it is in quantum physics. Even theorbits of the planets around the sun, long considered the centrepiece ofmechanistic science, turn out to be chaotic over long time scales.17[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1131034]The belief in determinism, strongly held by many nineteenth- andearly-twentieth-century scientists, turned out to be a delusion. The freeing ofscientists from this dogma led to a new appreciation of the indeterminism ofnature in general, and of evolution in particular. The sciences have not come toan end by abandoning the belief in determinism. Likewise, they will survive theloss of the dogmas that still bind them; they will be regenerated by newpossibilities.Further fantasies of omniscience By the end of the nineteenth century, the fantasy of scientific omniscience wentfar beyond a belief in determinism. In dicpsOldsF1888, the Canadian-Americanastronomer Simon Newcomb wrote, ‘We are probably nearing the limit of all we canknow about astronomy.’ In 1894, Albert Michelson, later to win the Nobel Prizefor Physics, declared, ‘The more important fundamental laws and facts ofphysical science have all been discovered, and these are now so firmlyestablished that the possibility of their ever being supplanted in consequenceof new discoveries is exceedingly remote . . . Our future discoveries must belooked for in the sixth place of decimals.’18[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1131571] And in 1900William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, the physicist and inventor of intercontinentaltelegraphy, expressed this supreme confidence in an often-quoted (althoughperhaps apocryphal) claim: ‘There is nothing new to be discovered in physicsnow. All that remains is more and more precise measurement.’These convictions were shattered in the twentieth century through quantumphysics, relativity theory, nuclear fission and fusion (as in atom and hydrogenbombs), the discovery of galaxies beyond our own, and the Big Bang theory – theidea that the universe began very small and very hot some 14 billion years agoand has been growing, cooling and evolving ever since.Nevertheless, by the end of the twentieth century, the fantasy of omnisciencewas back again, this time fuelled by the triumphs of twentieth-century physicsand by the discoveries of neurobiology and molecular biology. In 1997, JohnHorgan, a senior science writer at Scientific American, published a book calledThe End of Science: Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the Twilight of theScientific Age. After interviewing many leading scientists, he advanced aprovocative thesis: > If one believes in science, one must accept the possibility – even the> probability – that the great era of scientific discovery is over. By science I> mean not applied science, but science at its purest and greatest, the> primordial human quest to understand the universe and our place in it. Further> research may yield no more great revelations or revolutions, but only> incremental, diminishing returns.19> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1131995] Horgan is surely right that once something has been discovered – like thestructure of DNA – it cannot go on being discovered. But he took it for grantedthat the tenets of conventional science are true. He assumed that the mostfundamental answers are already known. They are not, and every one of them canbe replaced byolo replac more interesting and fruitful questions, as I show inthis book.Science and Christianity The founders of mechanistic science in the seventeenth century, includingJohannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, René Descartes, Francis Bacon, Robert Boyleand Isaac Newton, were all practising Christians. Kepler, Galileo and Descarteswere Roman Catholics; Bacon, Boyle and Newton Protestants. Boyle, a wealthyaristocrat, was exceptionally devout, and spent large amounts of his own moneyto promote missionary activity in India. Newton devoted much time and energy tobiblical scholarship, with a particular interest in the dating of prophecies. Hecalculated that the Day of Judgment would occur between the years 2060 and 2344,and set out the details in his book Observations on the Prophecies of Daniel andthe Apocalypse of St John.20[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1132540]Seventeenth-century science created a vision of the universe as a machineintelligently designed and started off by God. Everything was governed byeternal mathematical laws, which were ideas in the mind of God. This mechanisticphilosophy was revolutionary precisely because it rejected the animistic view ofnature taken for granted in medieval Europe, as discussed in Chapter 1. Untilthe seventeenth century, university scholars and Christian theologians taughtthat the universe was alive, pervaded by the Spirit of God, the divine breath oflife. All plants, animals and people had souls. The stars, the planets and theearth were living beings, guided by angelic intelligences.Mechanistic science rejected these doctrines and expelled all souls from nature.The material world became literally inanimate, a soulless machine. Matter waspurposeless and unconscious; the planets and stars were dead. In the entirephysical universe, the only non-mechanical entities were human minds, which wereimmaterial, and part of a spiritual realm that included angels and God. No onecould explain how minds related to the machinery of human bodies, but RenéDescartes speculated that they interacted in the pineal gland, the smallpine-cone-shaped organ nestled between the right and left hemispheres near thecentre of the brain.21[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1132955]After some initial conflicts, most notably the trial of Galileo by the RomanInquisition in 1633, science and Christianity were increasingly confined toseparate realms by mutual consent. The practice of science was fairly free fromreligious interference, and religion fairly free from conflict with science, atleast until the rise of militant atheism at the end of the eighteenth century.Science’s domain was the material universe, including human bodies, animals,plants, stars and planets. Religion’s realm was spiritual: God, angelent: God,s, spirits and human souls. This more or less peaceful coexistence served theinterests of both science and religion. Even in the late twentieth centuryStephen Jay Gould still defended this arrangement as a ‘sound position ofgeneral consensus’. He called it the doctrine of Non-overlapping Magisteria. Themagisterium of science covers ‘the empirical realm: what the Universe is made of(fact) and why does it work in this way (theory). The magisterium of religionextends over questions of ultimate meaning and moral value.’22[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1133367]However, from around the time of the French Revolution (1789–99), militantmaterialists rejected this principle of dual magisteria, dismissing it asintellectually dishonest, or seeing it as a refuge for the feeble-minded. Theyrecognised only one reality: the material world. The spiritual realm did notexist. Gods, angels and spirits were figments of the human imagination, andhuman minds were nothing but aspects or by-products of brain activity. Therewere no supernatural agencies that interfered with the mechanical course ofnature. There was only one magisterium: the magisterium of science.Atheist beliefs The materialist philosophy achieved its dominance within institutional sciencein the second half of the nineteenth century, and was closely linked to the riseof atheism in Europe. Twenty-first-century atheists, like their predecessors,take the doctrines of materialism to be established scientific facts, not justassumptions.When it was combined with the idea that the entire universe was like a machinerunning out of steam, according to the second law of thermodynamics, materialismled to the cheerless worldview expressed by the philosopher Bertrand Russell: > That man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were> achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and> beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collisions of atoms; that no fire,> no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an individual> life beyond the grave; that all the labours of the ages, all the devotion, all> the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to> extinction in the vast death of the solar system; and that the whole temple of> Man’s achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe> in ruins – all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so nearly> certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand. Only within> the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm foundation of unyielding> despair, can the soul’s habitation henceforth be built.23> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1133779] How many scientists believe in these ‘truths’? Some accept them withoutquestion. But many scientists have philosop noave phihies or religious faithsthat make this ‘scientific worldview’ seem limited, at best a half-truth. Inaddition, within science itself, evolutionary cosmology, quantum physics andconsciousness studies make the standard dogmas of science look old-fashioned.It is obvious that science and technology have transformed the world. Science isbrilliantly successful when applied to making machines, increasing agriculturalyields and developing cures for diseases. Its prestige is immense. Since itsbeginnings in seventeenth-century Europe, mechanistic science has spreadworldwide through European empires and European ideologies, like Marxism,socialism and free-market capitalism. It has touched the lives of billions ofpeople through economic and technological development. The evangelists ofscience and technology have succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of themissionaries of Christianity. Never before has any system of ideas dominated allhumanity. Yet despite these overwhelming successes, science still carries theideological baggage inherited from its European past.Science and technology are welcomed almost everywhere because of the obviousmaterial benefits they bring, and the mater ialist philosophy is part of thepackage deal. However, religious beliefs and the pursuit of a scientific careercan interact in surprising ways. As an Indian scientist wrote in the scientificjournal Nature in 2009, > [In India] science is neither the ultimate form of knowledge nor a victim of> scepticism . . . My observations as a research scientist of more than 30> years’ standing suggest that most scientists in India conspicuously evoke the> mysterious powers of gods and goddesses to help them achieve success in> professional matters such as publishing papers or gaining recognition.24> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1134332] All over the world, scientists know that the doctrines of materialism are therules of the game during working hours. Few professional scientists challengethem openly, at least before they retire or get a Nobel Prize. And in deferenceto the prestige of science, most educated people are prepared to go along withthe orthodox creed in public, whatever their private opinions.However, some scientists and intellectuals are deeply committed atheists, andthe materialist philosophy is central to their belief system. A minority becomemissionaries, filled with evangelical zeal. They see themselves as old-stylecrusaders fighting for science and reason against the forces of superstition,religion and credulity. Several books putting forward this stark opposition werebestsellers in the 2000s, including Sam Harris’s The End of Faith: Religion,Terror, and the Future of Reason (2004), Daniel Dennett’s Breaking the Spell(2006), Christopher Hitchens’s God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything(2007) and Richard Dawkins’s The God Delusion (2006), which by 2010 had sold twomillion copies in English, and was translated into thirty-four otherlanguages.25 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1134746]Until he retired in 2008, Dawkins was Professor of the Public Understanding ofScience at the University of Oxford.But few atheists believe in materialism alone. Most are also secular humanists,for whom a faith in God has been replaced by a faith in humanity. Humansapproach a godlike omniscience through science. God does not affect the courseof human history. Instead, humans have taken charge themselves, bringing aboutprogress through reason, science, technology, education and social reform.Mechanistic science in itself gives no reason to suppose that there is any pointin life, or purpose in humanity, or that progress is inevitable. Instead itasserts that the universe is ultimately purposeless, and so is human life. Aconsistent atheism stripped of the humanist faith paints a bleak picture withlittle ground for hope, as Bertrand Russell made so clear. But secular humanismarose within a Judaeo-Christian culture and inherited from Christianity a beliefin the unique importance of human life, together with a faith in futuresalvation. Secular humanism is in many ways a Christian heresy, in which man hasreplaced God.26[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1135482]Secular humanism makes atheism palatable because it surrounds it with areassuring faith in progress rather than provable facts. Instead of redemptionby God, humans themselves will bring about human salvation through science,reason and social reform.27[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1136156]Whether or not they share this faith in human progress, all materialists assumethat science will eventually prove that their beliefs are true. But this too isa matter of faith.Dogmas, beliefs and free enquiry It is not anti-scientific to question established beliefs, but central toscisizntral tence itself. At the creative heart of science is a spirit ofopen-minded enquiry. Ideally, science is a process, not a position or a beliefsystem. Innovative science happens when scientists feel free to ask newquestions and build new theories.In his influential book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), thehistorian of science Thomas Kuhn argued that in periods of ‘normal’ science,most scientists share a model of reality and a way of asking questions that hecalled a paradigm. The ruling paradigm defines what kinds of questionsscientists can ask and how they can be answered. Normal science takes placewithin this framework and scientists usually explain away anything that does notfit. Anomalous facts accumulate until a crisis point is reached. Revolutionarychanges happen when researchers adopt more inclusive frameworks of thought andpractice, and are able to incorporate facts that were previously dismissed asanomalies. In due course the new paradigm becomes the basis of a new phase ofnormal science.28[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1136576]Kuhn helped focus attention on the social aspect of science and reminded us thatscience is a collective activity. Scientists are subject to all the usualconstraints of human social life, including peer-group pressure and the need toconform to the norms of the group. Kuhn’s arguments were largely based on thehistory of science, but sociologists of science have taken his insights furtherby studying science as it is actually practised, looking at the ways thatscientists build up networks of support, use resources and results to increasetheir power and influence, and compete for funding, prestige and recognition.Bruno Latour’s Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers ThroughSociety (1987) is one of the most influential studies in this tradition. Latourobserved that scientists routinely make a distinction between knowledge andbeliefs. Scientists within their professional group know about the phenomenacovered by their field of science, while those outside the network have onlydistorted beliefs. When scientists think about people outside their groups, theyoften wonder how they can still be so irrational: > [T]he picture of non-scientists drawn by scientists becomes bleak: a few minds> discover what reality is, while the vast majority of people have irrational> ideas or at least are prisoners of many social, cultural and psychological> factors that make them stick obstinately to obsolete prejudices. The only> redeeming aspect of this picture is that if it were only possible to eliminate> all these factors that hold people prisoners of werrisonertheir prejudices,> they would all, immediately and at no cost, become as sound-minded as the> scientists, grasping the phenomena without further ado. In every one of us> there is a scientist who is asleep, and who will not wake up until social and> cultural conditions are pushed aside.29> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1136987] For believers in the ‘scientific worldview’, all that is needed is to increasethe public understanding of science through education and the media.Since the nineteenth century, a belief in materialism has indeed been propagatedwith remarkable success: millions of people have been converted to this‘scientific’ view, even though they know very little about science itself. Theyare, as it were, devotees of the Church of Science, or of scientism, of whichscientists are the priests. This is how a prominent atheist layman, RickyGervais, expressed these attitudes in the Wall Street Journal in 2010, the sameyear that he was on the Time magazine list of the 100 most influential people inthe world. Gervais is an entertainer, not a scientist or an original thinker,but he borrows the authority of science to support his atheism: > Science seeks the truth. And it does not discriminate. For better or worse it> finds things out. Science is humble. It knows what it knows and it knows what> it doesn’t know. It bases its conclusions and beliefs on hard evidence –> evidence that is constantly updated and upgraded. It doesn’t get offended when> new facts come along. It embraces the body of knowledge. It doesn’t hold onto> medieval practices because they are tradition.30> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1137663] Gervais’s idealised view of science is hopelessly naïve in the context of thehistory and sociology of science. It portrays scientists as open-minded seekersof truth, not ordinary people competing for funds and prestige, constrained bypeer-group pressures and hemmed in by prejudices and taboos. Yet naïve as it is,I take this ideal of free enquiry seriously. This book is an experiment in whichI apply these ideals to science itself. By turning assumptions into questions Iwant to find out what science really knows and doesn’t know. I look at the tencore doctrines of materialism in the light of hard evidence and recentdiscoveries. I assume that true scientists will not be offended when new factscome along, and that they will not hold onto the materialist worldview justbecause it’s traditional.I am doing this because the spirit of enquiry has continually liberatedscientific thinking from unnecessary limitations, whether imposed from within orwithout. I am convinced that the sciences, for all thesiz for alir successes,are being stifled by outmoded beliefs.1 Is Nature Mechanical? Many people who have not studied science are baffled by scientists’ insistencethat animal and plants are machines, and that humans are robots too, controlledby computer-like brains with genetically programmed software. It seems morenatural to assume that we are living organisms, and so are animals and plants.Organisms are self-organising; they form and maintain themselves, and have theirown ends or goals. Machines, by contrast, are designed by an external mind;their parts are put together by external machine-makers and they have nopurposes or ends of their own.The starting point for modern science was the rejection of the older, organicview of the universe. The machine metaphor became central to scientificthinking, with very far-reaching consequences. In one way it was immenselyliberating. New ways of thinking became possible that encouraged the inventionof machines and the evolution of technology. In this chapter, I trace thehistory of this idea, and show what happens when we question it.Before the seventeenth century, almost everyone took for granted that theuniverse was like an organism, and so was the earth. In classical, medieval andRenaissance Europe, nature was alive. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), forexample, made this idea explicit: ‘We can say that the earth has a vegetativesoul, and that its flesh is the land, its bones are the structure of the rocks .. . its breathing and its pulse are the ebb and flow of the sea.’1[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1138307] WilliamGilbert (1540–1603), a pioneer of the science of magnetism, was explicit in hisorganic philosophy of nature: ‘We consider that the whole universe is animated,and that all the globes, all the stars, and also the noble earth have beengoverned since the beginning by their own appointed souls and have the motivesof self-conservation.’ 2[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1138867]Even Nicholas Copernicus, whose revolutionary theory of the movement of theheavens, published in 1543, placed the sun at the centre rather than the earthwas no mechanist. His reasons for making this change were mystical as well asscientific. He thought a central position dignified the sun: > Not unfittingly do some call it the light of the world, others the soul, still> others the governor. Tremigmpliistus calls it the visible God: Sophocles’> Electra, the All-seer. And in fact does the sun, seated on his royal throne,> guide his family of planets as they circle around him.3> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1139284] Copernicus’s revolution in cosmology was a powerful stimulus for the subsequentdevelopment of physics. But the shift to the mechanical theory of nature thatbegan after 1600 was much more radical.For centuries, there had already been mechanical models of some aspects ofnature. For example, in Wells Cathedral, in the west of England, there is astill-functioning astronomical clock installed more than six hundred years ago.The clock’s face shows the sun and moon revolving around the earth, against abackground of stars. The movement of the sun indicates the time of day, and theinner circle of the clock depicts the moon, rotating once a month. To thedelight of visitors, every quarter of an hour, models of jousting knights rushround chasing each other, while a model of a man bangs bells with his heels.Astronomical clocks were first made in China and in the Arab world, and poweredby water. Their construction began in Europe around 1300, but with a new kind ofmechanism, operated by weights and escapements. All these early clocks took forgranted that the earth was at the centre of the universe. They were usefulmodels for telling the time and for predicting the phases of the moon; but noone thought that the universe was really like a clockwork mechanism.A change from the metaphor of the organism to the metaphor of themachine-produced science as we know it: mechanical models of the universe weretaken to represent the way the world actually worked. The movements of stars andplanets were governed by impersonal mechanical principles, not by souls orspirits with their own lives and purposes.In 1605, Johannes Kepler summarised his programme as follows: ‘My aim is to showthat the celestial machine is to be likened not to a divine organism but ratherto clockwork . . . Moreover I show how this physical conception is to bepresented through calculation and geometry.’4[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1139832] GalileoGalilei (1564–1642) agreed that ‘inexorable, immutable’ mathematical laws ruledeverything.The clock analogy was particularly persuasive because clocks work in aself-contained way. They are not pushing or pulling other objects. Likewise theuniverse performs its work by the regularity of its motions, and is the ultimatetime-telling system. Mechanical clocks had a further metaphorical advantage:they were a good example of knowledge through construction, or knowing by doing.Someone who could construct a machine could reconstruct it. Mechanical knowledgewas power.The prestige of mechanistic science did not come primarily from itsphilosophical underpinnings but from its practical successes, especially inphysics. Mathematical modelling typically involves extreme abstraction andsimplification, which is easiest to realise with man-made machines or objects.Mathematical mechanics is impressively useful in dealing with relatively simpleproblems, such as the trajectories of cannon balls or rockets.One paradigmatic example is billiard-ball physics, which gives a clear accountof impacts and collisions of idealised billiard balls in a frictionlessenvironment. Not only is the mathematics simplified, but billiard ballsthemselves are a very simplified system. The balls are made as round as possibleand the table as flat as possible, and there are uniform rubber cushions at thesides of the table, unlike any natural environment. Think of a rock falling downa mountainside for comparison. Moreover, in the real world, billiard ballscollide and bounce off each other in games, but the rules of the game and theskills and motives of the players are outside the scope of physics. Themathematical analysis of the balls’ behaviour is an extreme abstraction.From living organisms to biological machines The vision of mechanical nature developed amid devastating religious wars inseventeenth-century Europe. Mathematical physics was attractive partly becauseit seemed to provide a way of transcending sectarian conflicts to reveal eternaltruths. In their own eyes the pioneers of mechanistic science were finding a newway of understanding the relationship of nature to God, with humans adopting aGod-like mathematical omniscience, rising above the limitations of human mindsand bodies. As Galileo put it: > When God produces the world, he produces a thoroughly mathematical structure> that obeys the laws of number, geometrical figure and quantitative function.> Nature is an embodied mathematical system.5> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1140249] But there was a major problem. Most of our experience is not mathematical. Wetaste food, feel angry, enjoy the beauty of flowers, laugh at jokes. In order toassert the primacy of mathematics, Galileo and his successors had to distinguishbetween what they called ‘primary qualities’, which could be describedmathematically, such as motion, size and weight, and ‘secondary qualities’, likecolour and smell, which were subjective.6[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1140809] They took thereal world to be objective, quantitative and mathematical. Personal experiencein the lived world was subjectiv Cwasy te, the realm of opinion and illusion,outside the realm of science.René Descartes (1596–1650) was the principal proponent of the mechanical ormechanistic philosophy of nature. It first came to him in a vision on 10November 1619 when he was ‘filled with enthusiasm and discovered the foundationsof a marvellous science’.7[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1141357] He saw theentire universe as a mathematical system, and later envisaged vast vortices ofswirling subtle matter, the aether, carrying around the planets in their orbits.Descartes took the mechanical metaphor much further than Kepler or Galileo byextending it into the realm of life. He was fascinated by the sophisticatedmachinery of his age, such as clocks, looms and pumps. As a youth he designedmechanical models to simulate animal activity, such as a pheasant pursued by aspaniel. Just as Kepler projected the image of man-made machinery onto thecosmos, Descartes projected it onto animals. They, too, were like clockwork.8[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1141915] Activitieslike the beating of a dog’s heart, its digestion and breathing were programmedmechanisms. The same principles applied to human bodies.Descartes cut up living dogs in order to study their hearts, and reported hisobservations as if his readers might want to replicate them: ‘If you slice offthe pointed end of the heart of a live dog, and insert a finger into one of thecavities, you will feel unmistakably that every time the heart gets shorter itpresses the finger, and every time it gets longer it stops pressing it.’9[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1142595]He backed up his arguments with a thought experiment: first he imagined man-madeautomata that imitated the movements of animals, and then argued that if theywere made well enough they would be indistinguishable from real animals: > If any such machines had the organs and outward shapes of a monkey or of some> other animal that lacks reason, we should have no way of knowing that they did> not possess entirely the same nature as those animals.10> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1143274] With arguments like these, Descartes laid the foundations of mechanistic biologyand medicine that are still orthodox today. However, the machine theory of lifewas less readily accepted in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries than themachine theory of the universe. Especially in England Cly ay. Ho, the idea ofanimal-machines was considered eccentric.11[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1143686] Descartes’doctrine seemed to justify cruelty to animals, including vivisection, and it wassaid that the test of his followers was whether they would kick their dogs.12[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1144098]As the philosopher Daniel Dennett summarised it, ‘Descartes . . . held thatanimals were in fact just elaborate machines . . . It was only ournon-mechanical, non-physical minds that make human beings (and only humanbeings) intelligent and conscious. This was actually a subtle view, most ofwhich would readily be defended by zoologists today, but it was toorevolutionary for Descartes’ contemporaries.’13[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1144510]We are so used to the machine theory of life that it is hard to appreciate whata radical break Descartes made. The prevailing theories of his time took forgranted that living organisms were organisms, animate beings with their ownsouls. Souls gave organisms their purposes and powers of self-organisation. Fromthe Middle Ages right up into the seventeenth century, the prevailing theory oflife taught in the universities of Europe followed the Greek philosopherAristotle and his leading Christian interpreter, Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225–74),according to whom the matter in plant or animal bodies was shaped by theorganisms’ souls. For Aquinas, the soul was the form of the body.14[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1145055] The soul actedlike an invisible mould that shaped the plant or the animal as it grew andattracted it towards its mature form.15[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1145479]The souls of animals and plants were natural, not supernatural. According toclassical Greek and medieval philosophy, and also in William Gilbert’s theory ofmagnetism, even magnets had souls.16[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1145891] The soulwithin and around them gave them their powers of attraction and repulsion. Whena magnet was heated and lost its magnetic properties, it was as if the soul hadleft it, just as the soul left an animal body when it died. We now talk in termsof magnetic fields. In most respects fields have replaced the souls of classicaland medieval philosophy.17[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1146304]Before the mechanistic revolution, there were three levels of explanation:bodies, souls and spirits. Bodies and souls were part of nature. Spirits werenon-material but interacted with embodied beings through their souls. The humanspirit, or ‘rational soul’, according to Christian theology, was potentiallyopen to the Spirit of God.18[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1146855]After the mechanistic revolution, there were only two levels of explanation:bodies and spirits. Three layers were reduced to two by removing souls fromnature, leaving only the human ‘rational soul’ or spirit. The abolition of soulsalso separated humanity from all other animals, which became inanimate machines.The ‘rational soul’ of man was like an immaterial ghost in the machinery of thehuman body.How could the rational soul possibly interact with the brain? Descartesspeculated that their interaction occurred in the pineal gland.19[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1147402] He thought ofthe soul as like a little man inside the pineal gland controlling the plumbingof the brain. He compared the nerves to water pipes, the cavities in the brainto storage tanks, the muscles to mechanical springs, and breathing to themovements of a clock. The organs of the body were like the automata inseventeenth-century water gardens, and the immaterial man within was like thefountain keeper: > External objects, which by their mere presence stimulate [the body’s] sense> organs . . . are like visitors who enter the grottoes of these fountains and> unwittingly cause the movements which take place before their eyes. For they> cannot enter without stepping on certain tiles which are so arranged that if,> for example, they approach a Diana who is bathing they will cause her to hide> in the reeds. And finally, when a rational soul is present in this machine it> will have its principal seat in the brain, and reside there like the fountain> keeper who must be stationed at the tanks to which the fountain’s pipes return> if he wants to produce, or prevent, or change their movements in some way.20> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1147813] The final step in the mechanistic revolution was to reduce two levels ofexplanation to one. Instead of a duality of matter and mind, there is onlymatter. This is the doctrine of materialism, which came to dominate scientificthinking in the second half of the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, despitetheir nominal materialism, most scientists remained dualists, and continued touse dualistic metaphors.The little man, or homunculus, inside the brain remained a common way ofthinking about the relation of body and mind, but the metaphor moved with thetimes and adapted to new technologies. In the mid-twentieth century thehomunculus was usually a telephone operator in the telephone exchange of thebrain, and he saw projected images of the external world as if he were in acinema, as in a book published in 1949 called The Secret of Life: The HumanMachine and How It Works.21[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1148494] In an exhibitin 2010 at the Natural History Museum in London called ‘How You Control YourActions’, you looked through a Perspex window in the forehead of a model man.Inside was a cockpit with banks of dials and controls, and two empty seats,presumably for you, the pilot, and your co-pilot in the other hemisphere. Theghosts in the machine were implicit rather than explicit, but obviously this wasno explanation at all because the little men inside brains would themselves haveto have little men inside their brains, and so on in an infinite regress.If thinking of little men and women inside brains seems too naïve, then thebrain itself is personified. Many popular articles and books on the nature ofthe mind say ‘the brain perceives’, or ‘the brain decides’, while at the sametime arguing that the brain is just a machine, like a computer.22[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1148904] For example,the atheist philosopher Anthony Grayling thinks that ‘brains secrete religiousand superstitious belief’ because they are ‘hardwired’ to do so: > As a ‘belief engine’, the brain is always seeking to find meaning in the> information that pours into it. Once it has constructed a belief, it> rationalises it with explanations, almost always after the event. The brain> thus becomes invested in the beliefs, and reinforces them by looking for> supporting evidence while blinding itself to anything contrary.23> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1150233] This sounds more like a description of a mind than a brain. Apart from beggingthe question of the relation of the mind to the brain, Grayling also begs thequestion of how his own brain escaped from this ‘hardwired’ tendency to blinditself to anything contrary to its beliefs. In practice, the mechanistic theoryis only plausible because it smuggles non-mechanistic minds into human brains.Is a scientist operating mechanistically when he propounds a theory ofmaterialism? Not in his own eyes. There is always a hidden reservation in hisarguments: he is an exception to mechanistic determinism. He believes he isputting forward views that are true, not just doing what his brain makes himdo.24 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1150919]It seems impossible to be a consistent materialist. Materialism depends on alingering dualism, more or less thinly disguised. In the realm of biology thisdualism takes the form of personifying molecules, as I discuss below.The God of mechanical nature Although the machine theory of nature is now used to support materialism, forthe founding fathers of modern science it supported the Christian religion,rather than subverted it.Machines only make sense if they have designers. Robert Boyle, for example, sawthe mechanical order of nature as evidence for God’s design.25[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1151338] And IsaacNewton conceived of God in his own image as ‘very well skilled in mechanics andgeometry’.26 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1151883]The better the world-machine functioned, the less necessary was God’s ongoingactivity. By the end of the eighteenth century, the celestial machinery wasthought to work perfectly without any need for divine intervention. For manyscientifically minded intellectuals, Christianity gave way to deism. A SupremeBeing designed the world-machine, created it, set it in motion and left it torun automatically. This kind of God did not intervene in the world and there wasno point in praying to him. In fact there was no point in any religiouspractice. Several Enlightenment philosophers, like Voltaire, combined deism witha rejection of the Christian religion.Some defenders of Christianity agreed with the deists in accepting theassumptions of mechanistic science. The most famous proponent of mechanistictheology was William Paley, an Anglican priest. In his book Natural Theology,published in 1802, he argued that if someone were to find an object like awatch, he would be bound to conclude on examining it and observing its intricatedesign and precision that ‘there must have existed, at some time and at someplace or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed it for the purpose whichwe find it actually to answer, who comprehended its construction and designedits use’.27 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1152295] Soit was with ‘the works of nature’ such as the eye. God was the designer.In Britain in the nineteenth century, Anglican clergymen, most of whomemphasised the same points as Paley, wrote many popular books on naturalhistory. For example, the Reverend Francis Morris wrote a popular, lavishlyillustrated History of British Butterflies (1853), which served both as a fieldguide and a reminder of the beauty of nature. Morris believed that God hadimplanted in every human mind ‘an instinctive general love of nature’ throughwhich young and old alike could enjoy the ‘beautiful sights in which the benignCreator displays such infinite wisdom of Almighty skill’.28[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1152706]This was the kind of natural theology that Darwin rejec C Da-2\" ted in histheory of evolution by natural selection. By doing so, he undermined the machinetheory of life itself, as I discuss below. But the controversy he stirred up isstill with us, and its latest incarnation is Intelligent Design. Proponents ofIntelligent Design point out the difficulty, if not impossibility, of explainingcomplex structures like the vertebrate eye or the bacterial flagellum in termsof a series of random genetic mutations and natural selection. They suggest thatcomplex structures and organs show a creative integration of many differentcomponents because they were intelligently designed. They leave open thequestion of the designer,29[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1153262] but theobvious answer is God.The problem with the design argument is that the metaphor of a designerpresupposes an external mind. Humans design machines, buildings and works ofart. In a similar way the God of mechanistic theology, or the IntelligentDesigner, is supposed to have designed the details of living organisms.Yet we are not forced to choose between chance and an external intelligence.There is another possibility. Living organisms may have an internal creativity,as we do ourselves. When we have a new idea or find a new way of doingsomething, we do not design the idea first, and then put it into our own minds.New ideas just happen, and no one knows how or why. Humans have an inherentcreativity; and all living organisms may also have an inherent creativity thatis expressed in larger or smaller ways. Machines require external designers;organisms do not.Ironically, the belief in the divine design of plants and animals is not atraditional part of Christianity. It stems from seventeenth-century science. Itcontradicts the biblical picture of the creation of life in the first chapter ofthe Book of Genesis. Animals and plants were not portrayed as machines, but asself-reproducing organisms that arose from the earth and the seas, as in Genesis1:11: ‘And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed,and the fruit trees yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself.’ InGenesis 1: 24: ‘God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature afterhis kind, cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind.’ Intheological language, these were acts of ‘mediate’ creation: God did not designor create these plants and animals directly. As an authoritative Roman CatholicBiblical Commentary expressed it, God created them indirectly ‘through theagency of the mother earth’.30[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1153675]When nature came to life again Followers of the Enlightenment put their faith in mechanistic science, reasonand human progress. ‘Enlightened’ ideas or values still have a major influenceon our educational, social a CnalEnlightennd political systems today. But fromaround 1780 to 1830 in the Romantic movement there was a widespread reactionagainst the Enlightenment faith, expressed mainly in the arts and literature.Romantics emphasised emotions and aesthetics, as opposed to reason. They sawnature as alive, rather than mechanical. The most explicit application of theseideas to science was by the German philosopher Friedrich von Schelling, whosebook Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature (1797) portrayed nature as a dynamicinterplay of opposed forces and polarities through which matter is ‘brought tolife’.31 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1154340]A central feature of Romanticism was the rejection of mechanical metaphors andtheir replacement with imagery of nature as alive, organic, and in a process ofgestation or development.32[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1154755] The firstevolutionary theories arose in this context.Some scientists, poets and philosophers linked their philosophy of living natureto a God who imbued Nature with life and left her to develop spontaneously, morelike the God of Genesis than the designer God of mechanistic theology. Othersproclaimed themselves atheists, like the English poet Percy Shelley (1792–1822),but they had no doubt about a living power in nature, which Shelley called theSoul of the universe, or the all-sufficing Power, or the Spirit of Nature. Hewas also a pioneering campaigner for vegetarianism because he valued animals assentient beings.33[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1155334]These different worldviews can be summarised as follows: [images/00002.jpg] The Romantic movement created an enduring split in Western culture. Amongeducated people, in the world of work, business and politics, nature ismechanistic, an inanimate source of natural resources, exploitable for economicdevelopment. Modern economies are built on these foundations. On the other hand,children are often brought up in an animistic atmosphere of fairy tales, talkinganimals and magical transformations. The living world is celebrated in poems andsongs and in works of art. Nature is most strongly identified with thecountryside, as opposed to cities, and especially by unspoilt wilderness. Manyurban people dream of moving to the country, or having a weekend home in ruralsurroundings. On Friday evenings, ci C evd to citities of the Western world areclogged with traffic as millions of people try to get back to nature in a car.Our private relationship with nature presupposes that nature is alive. For amechanistic scientist, or technocrat, or economist, or developer, nature isneuter and inanimate. It needs developing as part of human progress. But oftenthe very same people have different attitudes in private. In Western Europe andNorth America, many people get rich by exploiting nature so that they can buy aplace in the countryside to ‘get away from it all’.This division between public rationalism and private romanticism has been partof the Western way of life for generations, but is becoming increasinglyunsustainable. Our economic activities are not separate from nature, but affectthe entire planet. Our private and public lives are increasingly intertwined.This new consciousness is expressed through a revived public awareness of Gaia,Mother Earth. But goddesses were not far below the surface of scientific thoughteven in its most materialist forms.The goddesses of evolution One of the pioneers of evolutionary theory was Charles Darwin’s grandfather,Erasmus Darwin, who wanted to increase the importance of nature and reduce therole of God.34 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1155744]The spontaneous evolution of plants and animals struck at the root of naturaltheology and the doctrine of God as designer. If new forms of life were broughtforth by Nature herself, there was no need for God to design them. ErasmusDarwin suggested that God endued life or nature with an inherent creativecapacity in the first place that was thereafter expressed without the need fordivine guidance or intervention. In his book Zoönomia (1794), he askedrhetorically: > Would it be too bold to imagine that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from> one living filament, which the great First Cause endued with animality, with> the power of acquiring new parts, attended with new propensities, directed by> irritations, sensations, volitions and associations, and thus possessing the> faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of> delivering down these improvements by generation to its posterity, world> without end!35> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1156419] For Erasmus Darwin, living beings were self-improving, and the results of theefforts of parents were inherited by their offspring. Likewise, Jean-BaptisteLamarck in his Zoological Philosophy (1809) suggested that animals developed newhabits in response to their environment, and their adaptations were passed on totheir Cd onion descendants. The giraffe, inhabiting arid regions of Africa, > is obliged to browse on the leaves of trees and make constant efforts to reach> them. From this habit long maintained in all its race, it has resulted that> the animal’s fore-legs have become longer than its hind legs, and its neck is> lengthened to such a degree that the giraffe attains a height of six metres.36> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1156960] In addition, a power inherent in life produced increasingly complex organisms,moving them up a ladder of progress. Lamarck attributed the origin of the powerof life to ‘the Supreme Author’, who created ‘an order of things which gaveexistence successively to all that we see’.37[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1157506] Like ErasmusDarwin, he was a romantic deist. So was Robert Chambers, who popularised theidea of progressive evolution in his best-selling Vestiges of the NaturalHistory of Creation, published anonymously in 1844. He argued that everything innature is progressing to a higher state as a result of a God-given ‘law ofcreation’.38 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1157917]His work was controversial both from a religious and scientific point of viewbut, like Lamarck’s theory, it was attractive to atheists because it removed theneed for a divine designer.But Chambers, Lamarck and Erasmus Darwin not only undermined mechanistictheology, they also, perhaps unwittingly, undermined the mechanistic theory oflife. No inanimate machinery contained within it a power of life, capacity forself-improvement or creativity. Their theories of progressive evolutiondemystified the creativity of God by mystifying evolution.Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace’s theory of evolution by naturalselection (1858) attempted to demystify evolution. Natural selection was blindand impersonal, and required no divine agency. It weeded out organisms that werenot fit to survive, and favoured those that were better adapted. The subtitle ofDarwin’s On the Origin of Species was The Preservation of Favoured Races in theStruggle for Life. The source of creativity was within animals and plantsthemselves: they varied spontaneously and adapted to new circumstances.Darwin gave no explanation for this creative power. In effect, he rejected thedesigning God of mechanistic theology, and attributed all creativity to Nature,just as his grandfather had done. For Darwin, Nature herself gave rise to theTree of Life. Through her C Threativiprodigious fertility, her spontaneousvariability and her powers of selection, she could do everything that Paleythought God did. But Nature was not an inanimate, mechanical system like theclockwork of celestial physics. She was Nature with a capital N. Darwin evenapologised for his language: ‘For brevity’s sake I sometimes speak of naturalselection as an intelligent power . . . I have, also, often personified the wordNature; for I have found it difficult to avoid this ambiguity.’39[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1158462]Darwin advised his readers to ignore the implications of his turns of phrase.If, instead, we pay attention to their implications, Nature is the Mother fromwhose womb all life comes forth, and to whom all life returns. She isprodigiously fertile, but she is also cruel and terrible, the devourer of herown offspring. She is creative, but she is also destructive, like the Indiangoddess Kali. For Darwin, natural selection was ‘a power incessantly ready foraction’,40 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_011.html#filepos1159135] andnatural selection worked by killing. The phrase ‘Nature red in tooth and claw’was the poet Tennyson’s rather than Darwin’s, but sounds very like Kali, or thedestructive Greek goddess Nemesis, or the vengeful Furies.Charles Darwin, like his grandfather Erasmus and Lamarck, believed in theinheritance of habits. His books give many examples of offspring inheriting theadaptations of their parents.41[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1159683] Theneo-Darwinian theory of evolution, which developed from the 1940s onwards,differed from Charles Darwin’s theory in that it rejected the inheritance ofacquired characteristics. Instead, organisms inherited genes from their parents,passing them on unaltered to their offspring, unless there were mutations, thatis to say, random changes in the genes. The molecular biologist Jacques Monodsummarised this theory in the title of his book, Chance and Necessity (1972).These seemingly abstract principles are the hidden goddesses of neo-Darwinism.Chance is the goddess Fortuna, or Lady Luck. The turnings of her wheel conferboth prosperity and misfortune. Fortuna is blind, and was often portrayed inclassical statues with a veil or blindfold. In Monod’s words, ‘pure chance,absolutely free but blind, [is] at the very root of the stupendous edifice ofevolution’.42 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1160111]Shelley called Necessity the ‘All-sufficing Power’ and the ‘Mother of theworld’. She is also Fate or Destiny, who appears in classical European mythologyas the Three Fates, who spin, allot and cut the thread of life, dispensing tomortals their destiny at birth. In neo-Darwinism, the thread of life is literal:helical DNA molecules in thread-like chromosomes dispense to mortals theirdestiny at birth.Mat Cniol DNA merialism is like an unconscious cult of the Great Mother. Theword ‘matter’ itself comes from the same root as ‘mother’; in Latin theequivalent words are materia and mater.43[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1160522] The Motherarchetype takes many forms, as in Mother Nature, or Ecology, or even theEconomy, which feeds and sustains us, working like a lactating breast on thebasis of supply and demand. (The Greek root ‘eco’ in both of these words meansfamily or household.) Archetypes are more powerful when they are unconsciousbecause they cannot be examined or discussed.Life breaks out of mechanical metaphors The theory of evolution destroyed the argument from mechanical design. A creatorGod could not have designed the machinery of animals and plants in the beginningif they evolved progressively through spontaneous variation and naturalselection.Living organisms, unlike machines, are themselves creative. Plants and animalsvary spontaneously, respond to genetic changes and adapt to new challenges fromthe environment. Some vary more than others, and occasionally something reallynew appears. Creativity is inherent in living organisms, or works through them.No machine starts from small beginnings, grows, forms new structures withinitself and then reproduces itself. Yet plants and animals do this all the time.They can also regenerate after damage. To see them as machines propelled only byordinary physics and chemistry is an act of faith; to insist that they aremachines despite all appearances is dogmatic.Within science itself, the machine theory of life was challenged continuallythroughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by an alternative school ofbiology called vitalism. Vitalists thought that organisms were more thanmachines: they were truly vital or alive. Over and above the laws of physics andchemistry, organising principles shaped the forms of living organisms, gave themtheir purposive behaviour, and underlay the instincts and intelligence ofanimals. In 1844, the chemist Justus von Liebig made a typical statement of thevitalist position when he argued that although chemists could analyse andsynthesise organic chemicals that occurred in living organisms, they would neverbe able to create an eye or a leaf. Besides the recognised physical forces,there was a further kind of cause that ‘combines the elements in new forms sothat they gain new qualities – forms and qualities which do not appear except inthe organism’.44[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1161203]In many ways, vitalism was a survival of the older worldview that livingorganisms were organised by souls. Vitalism was also in harmony with a romanticvision of living nature. Some vitalists, like the German embryologist HansDriesch (1867–1941), deliberately used the language of souls to emphasise thiscontinuity of thought. Driesch believed that a non-material organising principlegave plants and animals their forms and their goals. He called this organisingprinciple entelechy, adopting a word that Aristotle had used for the aspect ofthe soul that has its end within itself (en = in, telos = purpose). Embryos,Driesch argued, behave in a purposive way; if their development is disrupted,they can still reach the form towards which they are developing. He showed byexperiment that when sea-urchin embryos were cut in two, each half could giverise to a small but complete sea urchin, not half a sea urchin. Their entelechyattracted the developing embryos – and even separated parts of embryos – towardsthe form of the adult.Vitalism was and still is the ultimate heresy within mechanistic biology. Theorthodox view was clearly expressed by the biologist T. H. Huxley in 1867: > Zoological physiology is the doctrine of the functions or actions of animals.> It regards animal bodies as machines impelled by various forces, and> performing a certain amount of work which can be expressed in terms of the> ordinary forces of nature. The final object of physiology is to deduce the> facts of morphology on the one hand, and those of ecology on the other, from> the laws of the molecular forces of matter.45> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1161759] In these words, Huxley foreshadowed the spectacular development of molecularbiology since the 1960s, the most powerful effort ever made to reduce thephenomena of life to physical and chemical mechanisms. Francis Crick, who sharedin a Nobel Prize for the discovery of the structure of DNA, made this agendavery explicit in his book Of Molecules and Men (1966). He denounced vitalism andaffirmed his belief that ‘the ultimate aim of the modern movement in biology isin fact to explain all biology in terms of physics and chemistry’.The mechanistic approach is essentially reductionist: it tries to explain wholesin terms of their parts. That is why molecular biology has such a high statuswithin the life sciences: molecules are some of the smallest components ofliving organisms, the point at which b Cnt a high iology crosses over intochemistry. Hence molecular biology is at the leading edge of the attempt toexplain the phenomena of life in terms of ‘the laws of the molecular forces ofmatter’. In so far as biologists succeed in reducing organisms to the molecularlevel, they will then hand the baton to chemists and physicists, who will reducethe properties of molecules to those of atoms and subatomic particles.Until the nineteenth century, most scientists thought that atoms were the solid,permanent, ultimate basis of matter. But in the twentieth century it becameclear that atoms are made up of parts, with nuclei at the centre and electronsin orbitals around them. The nuclei themselves are made up of protons andneutrons, which in turn are composed of components called quarks, with threequarks each. When nuclei are split up in particle accelerators, like the LargeHadron Collider, at CERN, near Geneva, a host of further particles appears.Hundreds have been identified so far, and some physicists expect that with evenlarger particle accelerators, yet more will be found.The bottom has dropped out of the atom, and a zoo of evanescent particles seemsunlikely to explain the shape of an orchid flower, or the leaping of a salmon,or the flight of a flock of starlings. Reductionism no longer offers a solidatomic basis for the explanation of everything else. In any case, however manysubatomic particles there may be, organisms are wholes, and reducing them totheir parts by killing them and analysing their chemical constituents simplydestroys what makes them organisms.I was forced to think about the limitations of reductionism when I was a studentat Cambridge. As part of the final-year biochemistry course, my class did anexperiment on enzymes in rat livers. First, we each took a living rat and‘sacrificed’ it over the sink, decapitating it with a guillotine, then we cut itopen and removed its liver. We ground up the liver in a blender and centrifugedit, to remove unwanted fractions of the cellular debris. Then we purified theaqueous fraction to isolate the enzymes we wanted, and we put them in testtubes. Finally we added chemicals and studied the speeds at which chemicalreactions took place. We learned something about enzymes, but nothing about howrats live and behave. In a corridor of the Biochemistry Department the biggerproblem was summed up on a wall chart showing the chemical details of HumanMetabolic Pathways; across the top someone had written in big blue letters,‘KNOW THYSELF’.Attempts to explain organisms in terms of their chemical constituents are ratherlike trying to understand a computer by grinding it up and analysing itscomponent elements, such as copper, germanium and silicon. Certainly it ispossible to learn something about the computer in this way, namely what it ismade of. But in this process of reduction, the structure and the programmedactivity of the computer vanishes, and chemical analysis will never reveal thecircuit diagrams; no amount of mathematical modelling of interactions betweenits atomic constituents will reveal the computer’s programs or the purposes theyfulfilled.Mechanists expel purposive vital factors from living animals and plants, butthen they reinvent them in molecular guises. One form of molecular vitalism isto treat the genes as purposive entities with goals and powers that go farbeyond those of a mere chemical like DNA. The genes become molecularentelechies. In his book The Selfish Gene, Richard Cro\"n> > We are survival machines, but ‘we’ does not mean just people. It embraces all> animals, plants, bacteria, and viruses . . . We are all survival machines for> the same kind of replicator – molecules called DNA – but there are many> different ways of making a living in the world, and the replicators have built> a vast range of machines to exploit them. A monkey is a machine which> preserves genes up trees; a fish a machine which preserves genes in the> water.46 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1162171] In Dawkins’s words, ‘DNA moves in mysterious ways.’ The DNA molecules are notonly intelligent, they are also selfish, ruthless and competitive, like‘successful Chicago gangsters’. The selfish genes ‘create form’, ‘mould matter’and engage in ‘evolutionary arms races’; they even ‘aspire to immortality’.These genes are no longer mere molecules: > Now they swarm in huge colonies, safe inside gigantic lumbering robots, sealed> off from the outside world, communicating with it by tortuous indirect routes,> manipulating it by remote control. They are in you and me; they created us,> body and mind; and their preservation is the ultimate rationale for our> existence . . . Now they go by the name of genes, and we are their survival> machines.47 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1162716] The persuasive power of Dawkins’s rhetoric depended on anthropocentric languageand his cartoon-like imagery. He admits that his selfish-gene imagery is morelike science fiction than science,48[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1163127] but hejustifies it as a ‘powerful and illuminating’ metaphor.49[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1163415]The most popular use of a vitalistic metaphor in the name of mechanism is the‘genetic program’. Genetic programs are explicitly analogous to computerprograms, which are intelligently designed by human minds to achieve particularpurposes. Programs are purposive, intelligent and goal-directed. They are morelike entelechies than mechanisms. The ‘genetic program’ implies that plants andanimals are organised by purposive principles that are mind-like, or designed byminds. This is another way of smuggling intelligent designs into chemical genes.If challenged, most biologists will admit that genes merely specify the sequenceof amino acids in proteins, or are involved in the control of protein synthesis.They are not really programs; they are not selfish, they do not mould matter, orshape form, or aspire to immortalit Cto l oy. A gene is not ‘for’ acharacteristic like a fish’s fin or the nest-building behaviour of a weaverbird. But molecular vitalism soon creeps back again. The mechanistic theory oflife has degenerated into misleading metaphors and rhetoric.To many people, especially gardeners and people who keep dogs, cats, horses orother animals, it is blindingly obvious that plants and animals are livingorganisms, not machines.The philosophy of organism Whereas the mechanistic and vitalist theories both date back to the seventeenthcentury, the philosophy of organism, also called the holistic or organismicapproach, has been developing only since the 1920s. One of its proponents wasthe philosopher Alfred North Whitehead (1861–1947); another was Jan Smuts, aSouth African statesman and scholar, whose book Holism and Evolution (1926)focused attention on ‘the tendency of nature to form wholes that are greaterthan the sum of the parts through creative evolution’.50[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1163906] He saw holismas > the ultimate synthetic, ordering, organising, regulative activity in the> universe, which accounts for all the structural groupings and syntheses in it,> from the atom and the physico-chemical structures, through the cell and> organisms, through Mind in animals to Personality in man. The all-pervading> and ever-increasing character of synthetic unity or wholeness in these> structures leads to the concept of Holism as the fundamental activity> underlying and co-ordinating all others, and to the view of the universe as a> Holistic Universe.51> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1164317] The holistic or organismic philosophy agrees with the mechanistic theory inaffirming the unity of nature: the life of biological organisms is different indegree but not in kind from physical systems like molecules and crystals.Organicism agrees with vitalism in stressing that organisms have theirorganising principles within themselves; organisms are unities that cannot bereduced to the physics and chemistry of simpler systems.The philosophy of organism in effect treats all nature as alive; in this respectit is an updated version of pre-mechanistic animism. Even atoms, molecules andcrystals are organisms. As Smuts put it, ‘Both matter and life consist, in theatom and the cell, of unit structures whose ordered grouping produces thenatural wholes which we call bodies or organisms.’52[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1164733] Atoms are notinert particles of stuff, as in old-style atomism. Rather, as revealed bytwentieth-century physics, they are structures of activity, patterns ofenergetic vibration within fields. In Whitehead’s words, ‘Biology is the studyof the larger organisms, whereas physics is the study of the smallerorganisms.’53 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1165144]In the light of modern cosmology, physics is also the study of very largeorganisms, like planets, solar systems, galaxies, and the entire universe.The philosophy of organism points out that everywhere we look in nature, atwhatever level or scale, we find wholes that are made up of parts that arethemselves wholes at a lower level. This pattern of organisation can berepresented diagrammatically as in Figure 1.1. The smallest circles representquarks, for example, within protons, within atomic nuclei, within atoms, withinmolecules, within crystals. Or the smallest circles represent organelles, incells, in tissues, in organs, in organisms, in societies of organisms, inecosystems. Or the smallest circles are planets, in solar systems, in galaxies,in galactic clusters. Languages also show the same kind of organisation, withphonemes in syllables, in words, in phrases, in sentences. [images/00003.jpg] > Figure 1.1 A nested hierarchy of wholes or holons. These organised systems are all nested hierarchies. At each level, the wholeincludes the parts; they are literally within it. And at each level the whole ismore than the sum of the parts, with properties that cannot be predicted fromthe study of parts in isolation. For example, the structure and meaning of thissentence could not be worked out by a chemical analysis of the paper and theink, or deduced from the quantities of letters that make it up (five as, one b,five cs, two ds, etc.). Knowing the numbers of constituent parts is not enough:the structure of the whole depends on the way they are combined together inwords, and on the relationships between the words.Arthur Koestler proposed the term holon for wholes made up of parts that arethemselves wholes:> > Every holon has a dual tendency to preserve and assert its individuality as a> quasi-autonomous whole; and to function as an integrated part of an (existing> or evolving) larger whole. This polarity between the Self-assertive and> Integrative tendencies is inherent in the concept of hierarchic order.54> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1165695] For such nested hierarchies of holons, Koestler proposed the term holarchy.Another way of thinking about wholes is through ‘systems theory’, which speaksof ‘a configuration of parts joined together by a web of relationships’.55[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1166242] Such wholesare also called ‘complex systems’, and are the subject of a number ofmathematical models, variously called ‘complex systems theory’, ‘complexitytheory’ or ‘complexity science’.56[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1166828]For a chemical example, think of benzene, a molecule with six carbon and sixhydrogen atoms. Each of these atoms is a holon consisting of a nucleus withelectrons around it. In the benzene molecule, the six carbon atoms are joinedtogether in a six-sided ring, and electrons are shared between the atoms tocreate a vibrating cloud of electrons around the entire molecule. The patternsof vibration of the molecule affect the atoms within it, and since the electronsare electrically charged, the atoms are in a vibrating electromagnetic field.Benzene is a liquid at room temperature, but below 5.5oC it crystallises, and asit does so, the molecules stack themselves together in a regularthree-dimensional pattern, called the lattice structure. This crystal latticealso vibrates in harmonic patterns,57[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1167242] creatingvibrating electromagnetic fields, which affect the molecules within them. Thereis a nested hierarchy of levels of organisation, interacting through a nestedhierarchy of vibrating fields.In the course of evolution, new holons arise that did not exist before: forexample, the first amino acid molecules, the first living cells, or the firstflowers, or the first termite colonies. Since holons are wholes, they must ariseby sudden jumps. New levels of organisation ‘emerge’ and their ‘emergentproperties’ go beyond those of the parts that were there before. The same istrue of new ideas, or new works of art.The cosmos as a developing organism The philosopher David Hume (1711–76) is perhaps best known today for hisscepticism about religion. Yet he was equally sceptical about the mechanisticphilosophy of nature. There was nothing in the universe to prove that it wasmore like a machine than an organism; the organisation we see in nature was moreanalogous to plants and animals than to machines. Hume was against the idea of amachine-designing God, and suggested instead that the world could haveoriginated from something like a seed or an egg. In Hume’s words, publishedposthumously in 1779,"},{"pageContent":" > There are other parts of the universe (besides the machines of human> invention) which bear still a greater resemblance to the fabric of the world,> and which, therefore, afford a better conjecture concerning the universal> origin of the system. These parts are animals and plants. The world plainly> resembles more an animal or a vegetable, than it does a watch or a> knitting-loom . . . And does not a plant or an animal, which springs from> vegetation or generation, bear a stronger resemblance to the world, than does> any artificial machine, which arises from reason and design?58> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1167673] Hume’s argument was surprisingly prescient in the light of modern cosmology.Until the 1960s, most scientists still thought of the universe as a machine, andmoreover as a machine that was running out of steam, heading for its final heatdeath. According to the second law of thermodynamics, promulgated in 1855, theuniverse would gradually lose the capacity to do work. It would eventuallyfreeze in ‘a state of universal rest and death’, as William Thomson, later LordKelvin, put it.59[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1168093]It was not until 1927 that Georges Lemaître, a cosmologist and Roman Catholicpriest, advanced a scientific hypothesis like Hume’s idea of the origin of theuniverse in an egg or seed. Lemaître suggested that the universe began with a‘creation-like event’, which he described as ‘the cosmic egg exploding at themoment of creation’.60[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1168506] Later calledthe Big Bang, this new cosmology echoed many archaic stories of origins, likethe Orphic creation myth of the Cosmic Egg in ancient Greece, or the Indian mythof Hiranyagarbha, the primal Golden Egg.61[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1168917] Significantly,in all these myths the egg is both a primal unity and a primal polarity, sincean egg is a unity composed of two parts, the yolk and the white, an apt symbolof the emergence of ‘many’ from ‘one’.Lemaître’s theory predicted the expansion of the universe, and was supported bythe discovery that galaxies outside our own are moving away from us with a speedproportional to their distance. In 1964, the discovery of a faint backgroundglow everywhere in the universe, the cosmic microwave background radiation,revealed what seemed to be fossil light left over from the early universe, soonafter the Big Bang. The evidence for an initial ‘creation-like event’ becameoverwhelming, and by 1966 the Big Bang theory became orthodox.Cosmology now tells a story of a universe that began extremely small, less thanthe size of a pinhead, and very hot. It has been expanding ever since. As itgrows, it cools down, and as it cools, new forms and structures appear withinit: atomic nuclei and electrons, stars, galaxies, planets, molecules, crystalsand biological life.The machine metaphor has long outlived its usefulness, and holds back scientificthinking in physics, biology and medicine. Our growing, evolving universe ismuch more like an organism, and so is the earth, and so are oak trees, and soare dogs, and so are you.What difference does it make? Can you really think of yourself as a genetically programmed machine in amechanical universe? Probably not. Probably even the most committed materialistscannot either. Most of us feel we are truly alive in a living world – at leastat weekends. But through loyalty to the mechanistic worldview, mechanisticthinking takes over during working hours.In recognising the life of nature, we can allow ourselves to recognise what wealready know, that animals and plants are living organisms, with their ownpurposes and goals. Anyone who gardens or keeps pets knows this, and recognisesthat they have their own ways of responding creatively to their circumstances.But instead of dismissing our own observations and insights to conform tomechanistic dogma, we can pay attention to them and try to learn from them.In relation to the living earth, we can see that the Gaia theory is not just anisolated poetic metaphor in an otherwise mechanical universe. The recognition ofthe earth as a living organism is a major step towards recognising the widerlife of the cosmos. If the earth is a living organism, what about the sun andthe solar system as a whole? If the solar system is a kind of organism, whatabout the galaxy? Cosmology already portrays the entire universe as a kind ofgrowing super-organism, born through the hatching of the cosmic egg.These differences in viewpoint do not immediately suggest a new range oftechnological products, and in that sense they may not be economically useful.But they make a big difference in healing the split created by the mechanistictheo Chanducts, andry – a split between our personal experiences of nature andthe mechanical explanations that science gives us. And they help heal the splitbetween the sciences and all traditional and indigenous cultures, none of whichsees humans and animals as machines in a mechanical world.Finally, dispelling the belief that the universe is an inanimate machine opensup many new questions, discussed in the following chapters.Questions for materialists Is the mechanistic worldview a testable scientific theory, or a metaphor? If it is a metaphor, why is the machine metaphor better in every respect thanthe organism metaphor? If it is a scientific theory, how could it be tested orrefuted? Do you think that you yourself are nothing but a complex machine? Have you been programmed to believe in materialism?Summary The mechanistic theory is based on the metaphor of the machine. But it’s only ametaphor. Living organisms provide better metaphors for organised systems at alllevels of complexity, including molecules, plants and societies of animals, allof which are organised in a series of inclusive levels, in which the whole ateach level is more than the sum of the parts, which are themselves wholes at alower level. Even the most ardent defenders of the mechanistic theory smugglepurposive organising principles into living organisms in the form of selfishgenes or genetic programs. In the light of the Big Bang theory, the entireuniverse is more like a growing, developing organism than a machine slowlyrunning out of steam.2 Is the Total Amount of Matter and Energy Always the Same? Every science student learns that the total amount of matter and energy isalways the same. Matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed. The law ofconservation of matter and energy is simple and reassuring: it guaranteesfundamental permanence in an ever-changing world.This law usually goes unquestioned. But it faces unprecedented challenges. As Idiscuss in this chapter, most physicists now believe that the universe containslarge amounts of ‘dark matter’, whose nature and properties are literallyobscure. Dark matter is currently thought to make up about 23 per cent of themass and energy of the universe, whereas normal matter and energy make up onlyabout four per cent. Worse still, most contemporary cosmologists think that thecontinuing expansion of the universe is driven by ‘dark energy by ƀ, whosenature is again obscure. According to the Standard Model of cosmology, darkenergy currently accounts for about 73 per cent of the matter and energy of theuniverse.How do dark matter and energy relate to regular matter and energy? And what isthe zero-point energy field, also known as the quantum vacuum? Can any of thiszero-point energy be tapped?The law of conservation of matter and energy was formulated before thesequestions arose, and has no ready answer for them. It is based on philosophicaland theological theories. Historically, it is rooted in the atomistic school ofphilosophy in ancient Greece. From the outset it was an assumption. In itsmodern form, it combines a series of ‘laws’ that have developed since theseventeenth century – the laws of conservation of matter, mass, motion, forceand energy. In this chapter I look at the history of these ideas, and show howmodern physics throws up questions that the old theories cannot answer. As faithin conservation comes into question, astonishing new possibilities open up inrealms ranging from the generation of energy to human nutrition.Matter, force and energy Classical Newtonian physics was based on a fundamental distinction betweenmatter and force. Matter was passive. Forces acted on matter causing changes.Material bodies either continued to exist in the same place for ever, orcontinued to move in a straight line perpetually, until they were acted on byforces that caused them to accelerate, or change direction or decelerate. Forcewas the active principle that caused change. Indeed, force or energy wascausation. And because the cause must equal the effect, the total amount offorce or energy must remain the same for logical reasons.As the philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) made explicit, matter was inert andcould only be experienced through its effects, and force was the cause of allthese effects. In contrast with matter or bodies, forces and energies are notthings: they are to do with processes in time. They are elusive. They breathelife, we might say poetically, into material nature and underlie all changes.I begin with the history of the belief in the conservation of matter, whicharose more than 2,500 years ago.Eternal atoms In ancient Greece, philosophers were preoccupied with the idea that behind thechang Kind heighting world of experience there was a changeless eternal reality,or an original unity. This conviction probably originated in mysticalexperiences, which appeared to reveal the existence of an ultimate reality ortruth beyond space and time. The philosopher Parmenides tried to form anintellectual conception of an ultimate changeless being, and concluded that thatbeing must be a changeless, undifferentiated sphere. There could be only onechangeless thing, not many different things that change. But the world weexperience contains many different things that change. Parmenides could onlyregard this as the result of illusion.This conclusion was unacceptable to philosophers who came after him, for obviousreasons. They looked for more plausible theories of Absolute Being. Philosophersin the tradition of Pythagoras (c. 570–c. 495 bc) believed that eternal realitywas made up of changeless mathematical truths. Plato and his followers thoughtin terms of transcendent Ideas or Forms beyond space and time. The atomistphilosophers found another answer: Absolute Being is not a vast,undifferentiated, changeless sphere, but rather consists of many tiny,undifferentiated, changeless things – material atoms moving in the void. Thusthe permanent atoms were the changeless basis of the changing phenomena of theworld: matter was Absolute Being.1[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1169593] Thisphilosophy of atomism or materialism, first propounded in the fifth centurybefore Christ by Leucippus and Democritus,2[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1170010] was based onimpressive feats of logical deduction. No one could see atoms or provideevidence for their existence, but it was a remarkably fruitful idea, and stillexerts an enormous influence. Implicitly, the total amount of matter was alwaysthe same because the atoms were indestructible, by definition.The atomists proposed that the movements and combinations of the atoms weregoverned by natural laws. There was no need for gods; neither were there anydivine purposes in the universe. The human soul itself depended on combinationsof atoms, and was extinguished at death; the atoms themselves continued forever, entering into new permutations and combinations.The main appeal of the atomist or materialist philosophy in pre-Christian Greeceand Rome was its scepticism about the pantheon of gods and goddesses. Epicurus(341–270 bc), one of the most influential atomist philosophers, preached thatmaterialism could liberate human beings from the fear of fickle gods and ofdivine retribution after death. He advocated a moderate for K mooulm ofhedonism, freed from these fears, teaching that happiness could best be achievedthrough simple pleasures and the company of friends.3[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1170564]The Roman philosopher Lucretius (99–55 bc) popularised the Epicurean philosophyin his poem De Rerum Natura, ‘On the Nature of Things’. He began by portrayingEpicurus as the hero who crushed the monster of superstition and religion. Hethen explained everything mechanistically in terms of the purposeless motionsand interactions of eternal atoms.Atomistic materialism re-entered European thought from the late sixteenthcentury onwards largely through Lucretius’s poem. It appealed to the founders ofmechanistic science because it was mechanistic, not because it wasanti-religious. The leading populariser of atomism was a French Roman Catholicpriest, Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655), who tried to make the atomist doctrinecompatible with Christianity. The founding fathers of mechanistic sciencefollowed his example by accepting God, the divine creation of the universe andthe immortality of the soul as well as atoms of matter.In effect, the seventeenth-century mechanistic theory of nature combined twoGreek philosophies of eternity to produce a cosmic dualism: nature was made upof changeless atoms of matter in motion governed by immutable mathematical lawsof nature that transcend space and time. But whereas for pre-Christian Greeks,like Democritus and Epicurus, atoms could be thought of as eternal, for theChristian founders of mechanistic science, they had to have been made by God inthe first place.Robert Boyle preferred to use the word ‘corpuscle’ because he wanted to avoidthe atheistic implications of atomism and materialism. Boyle thought that in thecreation of the universe God divided matter into a large number of smallparticles of different sizes and shapes, and isolated them from each other bysetting them in motion in different ways.4[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1170981] After God hadcreated them, the atoms just stayed the same. Isaac Newton agreed, andsummarised his own views as follows: > It seems probable to me, that God in the beginning formed matter in solid,> massy, hard, impenetrable, movable particles . . . and that these primitive> particles being solids, are incomparably harder than any porous bodies> compounded of them; even so very hard as to never wear or break in pieces; no> ordinary power being able to divide what God himself made one in the first> creation.5 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1171398] In the late eighteenth century, atoms took on a more definite identity as theatoms of chemical elements. The pioneer of chemistry, Antoine Lavoisier(1743–94), took the law of conservation of mass or matter to mean that the totalmass of all the products of a chemical reaction equalled the total mass of allthe reactants. He defined an element as a basic substance that could not befurther broken down by chemical methods, and was the first to recognise and nameoxygen and hydrogen. Unfortunately Lavoisier was a tax collector as well as achemist, and was guillotined at the height of the French Revolution. Soonafterwards, John Dalton (1766–1844) discovered that elements combine together inratios of whole numbers, and he suggested that they involved combinations ofchemical atoms, such as CO2 and H2O. The subsequent growth and enormous successof chemistry made atomism into an extremely fruitful theory.The dissolution of solid matter The more that atoms were investigated, the more apparent it became that theywere not ultimate units of matter, made up of ‘solid, massy, hard, impenetrable’particles, as Newton had imagined. Instead, they were structures of activity.From the 1920s onwards, quantum theory portrayed the constituent parts of atoms– electrons, nuclei and nuclear particles – as vibratory patterns of activitywithin fields. Like photons of light, they behave both as waves and asparticles. As the philosopher of science Karl Popper expressed it, throughmodern physics, ‘materialism transcended itself’:6[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1172224] > Matter turns out to be highly packed energy, transformable into other forms of> energy; and therefore something in the nature of a process, since it can be> converted into other processes, such as light and, of course, motion and heat.> Thus one may say that the results of modern physics suggest that we should> give up the idea of a substance or essence. They suggest that there is no> self-identical entity persisting during all changes in time . . . The universe> now appears to be not a collection of things, but an interacting set of events> or proces Kntss nses (as stressed especially by A. N. Whitehead).7> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1172783] Meanwhile, according to the theory of quantum electrodynamics, brilliantlyexpounded by the physicist Richard Feynman, virtual particles, such aselectrons, and photons, appear and disappear from the quantum vacuum field, alsoknown as the zero-point field, that pervades the universe. Feynman called thistheory the ‘jewel of physics’ because of its extremely accurate predictions,correct to many decimal places.The price that is paid for this accuracy is the acceptance of invisible,unobservable particles and interactions, and of the mysterious quantum vacuumfield. According to quantum electrodynamics, all electrical and magnetic forcesare mediated by virtual photons that appear from the quantum vacuum field andthen disappear into it again. When you look at a compass to find out where northis, the compass needle interacts with the earth’s magnetic field through virtualphotons. When you switch on a fan, its electric motor makes it go round becauseit is suddenly filled with virtual photons that exert forces. When you sit down,the chair supports your bottom because the chair and your bottom repel eachother through a dense creation and destruction of virtual photons between them.When you get up, much of this activity in the vacuum field stops, and now greatclouds of virtual photons appear between your feet and the floor, wherever youput your feet. All the molecules within your body, all your cell membranes, allyour nerve impulses depend on virtual photons appearing and disappearing withinthe all-pervading vacuum field of nature. As the physicist Paul Davies put it,‘A vacuum is not inert and featureless, but alive with throbbing energy andvitality.’8 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1173198]We have come a long way from a simple belief in atoms of matter as tiny solidobjects that persist unchanged through time. According to current theories,matter itself is an energetic process, and mass depends on interactions withfields that pervade the vacuum.Even mass, the quantitative measure of matter, turns out to be deeplymysterious. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, the mass of aparticle like an electron or a proton is not inherent in the particle itself butdepends on its interaction with a field called a Higgs field, named after one ofthe theoretical physicists who proposed it in 1964, Peter Higgs. Physiciststhink of this field as being like a universal pool of treacle that ‘sticks’ tootherwise massless particles travelling through it, conferring mass upon them.9[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1173746] Thus the massof an electron, for example, arises through its interaction with the Higgsfield, and this interaction depends on special Higgs particles, called Higgsbosons, which are hypothetical. There is no agreed prediction about their mass,and no Higgs boson has so far been detected, despite the expenditure of billionsof euros to look for them in a gigantic particle accelerator, the Large HadronCollider at CERN, near Geneva. Writers of popular science often refer to theHiggs boson as ‘the God particle’. These elu K.lidsive particles and fields havetaken physics a long way from the Newtonian conception of matter as made up of‘solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable particles’.The conservation of energy What we now know as the law of conservation of energy did not emerge until the1850s; indeed, the word ‘energy’ itself, though it came from a Greek root, wasnot in general use among scientists until the mid-nineteenth century. But rightfrom the beginning of mechanistic science, there was a precursor of this law inthe idea of conservation of motion or force. Like the conservation of matter,the conservation of motion or force was based on philosophical and theologicalarguments rather than on experimental observations.For Descartes the original source of all matter and motion was God, and becauseGod and his creation were immutable, the total quantity of matter and motioncould not change. Individual particles could acquire or lose motion by collidingwith other particles, but the total amount of motion was unaffected.10[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1174158] In the earlynineteenth century, James Joule, who established the mechanical equivalent ofheat, likewise made God the guarantor: ‘[T]he grand agents of nature are, by theCreator’s fiat, indestructible; . . . wherever mechanical force is expended, anexact equivalent of heat is always obtained.’11[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1174707] MichaelFaraday was also convinced that God’s powers could not be created or destroyedwithout some compensatory balance. He wrote, ‘The highest law in physicalscience which our faculties permit us to perceive [is] the Conservation ofForce.’12 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1175119]In the first half of the nineteenth century, several different investigatorsarrived more or less independently at this conservation principle,13[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1175531] which becameone of the great unifying principles of physics, combining ideas about kineticenergy, potential energy, heat, mechanical energy, chemical energy, light,electromagnetic energy and the energy of living organisms.14[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1175941] The forms ofenergy could change, but the total amount remained the same. The principle ofconservation of energy was embodied in the first law of thermodynamics, whichstates that energy can be transformed from one form to another but cannot becreated or destroyed.As William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin, saw it, energy’s fundamental statusderived from its immutability and convertibility, and also from its unifyingrole in linking all physical phenomena in a web of energy transformations. Hegave energy a theological sanction, and declared in 1852 that energy cannot bedestroyed but only transformed ‘as it is most certain that Creative Power alonecan either call into existence or annihilate mechanical energy’.15[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1176410]The ideas of conservation of matter and energy played an essential role in thedevelopment of the equations of physics. By definition, an equation demands thatthe total quantity of matter and energy before a change is equal to the totalamount afterwards. In the 1960s, Richard Feynman expressed it as follows: > There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that> are known to date. There is no known exception to this law; it is exact, so> far as we know. The law is called the conservation of energy; it states that> there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in> manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because> it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity,> which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a> mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can> calculate some number, and when we finish watching nature go through her> tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same.16> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1176954] The principles of conservation of matter and energy were brought together byAlbert Einstein in his famous equation E=mc2, which shows the equivalencebetween mass (m), energy (E) and the velocity of light (c). For example, theamount of energy released as radiation in the explosion of an atomic bomb equalsthe amount of mass lost by the bomb, times the square of the velocity of light.However, the mass is not destroyed by being converted to radiant energy: theenergy released by the bomb still has mass, and this mass is transferred tobodies that absorb the radiation. If the bomb loses one gram, and all itsradiation is absorbed by other bodies, they collectively gain one gram. Ineffect, Einstein’s equation meant that the conservation of matter became anaspect of the conservation of energy.The equations of physics imply that satisfyingly precise relationships underlieall the transformations of nature. The conservation of matter and energy seemslike a mathematical truth, even though matter is no longer solid, and massdepends on undetected Higgs particles. But the idea that the total amount ofmatter and energy is the same for ever runs into big problems in cosmology.The appearance of matter from nowhere The Big Bang theory, originally called the theory of the primeval atom, wasfirst proposed in 1927 by Father Georges Lemaître. This theory became orthodoxin the late 1960s.The Big Bang theory means that all equations were violated in the primalsingularity of the Big Bang. There was no conservation of matter and energy ifthe universe arose from nothing. As Terence McKenna expressed it, ‘Whatorthodoxy teaches about time is that the universe sprang from utter nothingnessin a single moment . . . It’s almost as if science said, “Give me one freemiracle, and from there the entire thing will proceed with a seamless, causalexplanation.”’17[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1177367] The one freemiracle was the sudden appearance of all the matter and energy in the universe,with all the laws that govern it.The creation of all matter and energy in the Beginning is presupposed by the BigBang creation story, just as it was by René Descartes, Robert Boyle, IsaacNewton and other scientists who wanted to make physics compatible with aninitial act of creation by God. Indeed in 1951, more than fifteen years beforephysicists generally accepted the Big Bang theory, Pope Pius XII welcomed it inan address to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences: > Thus everything seems to indicate that the material universe had a mighty> beginning in time, endowed as it was with vast reserves of energy, in virtue> of which at first rapidly, and then ever more slowly, it evolved into its> present state . . . In fact, it would seem that present-day science, with one> sweeping step back across millions of centuries, has succeeded in bearing> witness to that primordial Fiat lux uttered at the moment when, along with> matter, there burst forth from nothing a sea of light and radiation.18> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1177803] The Big Bang theory was initially controversial because some astronomers weresuspicious of its theological implications; indeed, some opposed it preciselybecause the Pope approved of it. One British physicist suggested that the BigBang theory was part of a conspiracy to shore up Christianity: ‘The underlyingmotive is, of course, to bring in God as creator. It seems like the opportunityChristian theology has been waiting for ever since science began to deposereligion from the minds of rational men in the seventeenth century.’19[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1178357] The astronomerFred Hoyle condemned the Big Bang theory as a model built on Judaeo-Christianfoundations,20 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1178927]and proposed an alternative. He argued that there was a process of continuouscreation through which new matter and energy appeared with Kappd an alin theuniverse as it expanded. The universe was eternal and infinite, and as thegalaxies moved apart, new galaxies were created in the gaps between them. Theuniverse was expanding yet remained in a steady state because of continuouscreation, which took place as a result of the activity of a hypotheticalC-field, or creation field, which both drove the steady expansion of the cosmosand generated new matter.The original version of the steady state theory had to be abandoned because itpredicted that new galaxies would be formed within the gaps between old ones,and hence young galaxies should be scattered all over the universe. By contrast,the Big Bang theory predicted that young galaxies would be formed relativelyearly in the history of the universe, and would therefore be found only faraway, billions of light years in the past. In the early 1960s, evidence gatheredby the British radio astronomer Martin Ryle showed that young galaxies wereindeed distant, favouring the Big Bang theory. One of the theory’s proponents,George Gamow, wrote a poem to celebrate: > ‘Your years of toil’> Said Ryle to Hoyle> ‘Are wasted years, believe me,> The Steady State> Is out of date> Unless my eyes deceive me.’21> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1179338] Another discovery by a radio astronomer in 1963 seemed to provide furtherevidence for the Big Bang. Maartin Schmidt, a Dutch astronomer, was studying anextremely energetic radio source that he thought at first was a star in our owngalaxy. But it turned out to have a high redshift: the radiation from it wasmuch redder than would be expected if it were nearby. Objects far away havelarger redshifts or, in other words, longer wavelengths of light than nearbyobjects because of the expansion of the universe. Redshifts are produced by theDoppler effect: waves are stretched when their source is moving away, just asthe sound waves from a siren get longer when a police car moves past; the tonedrops. The further away galaxies are, the faster they are receding, and theredder they look. The high redshift of Schmidt’s radio source suggested thatthis object was receding from us very fast. In fact it had the highest redshiftever detected, suggesting that it was over a billion light years away. Thisquasi-stellar radio object, or quasar, would therefore have to be anunprecedentedly brilliant galaxy, hundreds of times brighter than any yet known.More quasars were soon discovered, and all of them had high redshifts and henceseemed very distant. If the universe were in a steady state, there should havebeen nearer quasars too, intense radio sources with small redshifts. But quaKiftrsesars seemed to lie in the most distant reaches of the universe.The discovery in 1965 of the cosmic microwave background radiation, thought tobe a kind of echo or afterglow of the Big Bang, seemed to settle the matter.Stephen Hawking described this discovery as ‘the final nail in the coffin of thesteady-state theory’. The Big Bang theory became the new orthodoxy. In thesimplistic style of history favoured by many scientists, the Big Bang theory wasthe victor; the steady state was vanquished.Dark matter In the 1930s, Fritz Zwicky, a Swiss astrophysicist, studied the movements ofgalaxies within galactic clusters and realised that the clusters could not beheld together by normal gravitation. Galaxies were attracting each other toostrongly. The force holding them together seemed to be hundreds of times greaterthan a gravitational pull by visible matter could explain.22[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1179892]Zwicky’s results were ignored for decades, but were again taken seriously whenit became apparent that the orbits of stars within galaxies could not beexplained by the gravitational attraction of known kinds of matter. Too muchforce was acting upon the stars. Astronomers mapped the gravitational influencesand found that apparent sources of gravitation did not correspond to thefamiliar disc-shaped structure of galaxies. Instead, there was a roughlyspherical distribution of matter, which they called dark matter, stretching farbeyond the fringes of the luminous galaxies, forming vast haloes extending intointergalactic space.23[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1180303]Dark matter helps to explain the structures of galaxies and the relationsbetween galaxies within clusters, but it does so at a heavy price: nobody knowswhat it is. Theories to explain it include vast numbers of unobserved blackholes or other massive objects, or enormous quantities of undetected particlescalled WIMPS (weakly interacting massive particles).A few physicists believe they can get rid of dark matter altogether by modifyingthe laws of gravitation instead.24[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1180715] If they areright, then the total amount of matter recognised by physics will dropdramatically.Dark energy In the mid-1990s, the problems for cosmologists worsened. Detailed observationsof distant supernovas – exploding stars in faraway galaxies – showed that theexpansion of the universe was speeding up. Gravitation ought to be slowing itdown. So something else must account for acceleratin Kr a–g growth. Physicistswere forced to conclude that there must be an antigravity force, called darkenergy, which they thought of in terms of a negative pressure’ of empty space,or as an invisible field permeating the universe.In 2010, only about four per cent of the universe was believed to be made up offamiliar matter and energy such as atoms, stars, galaxies, gas clouds, planetsand electromagnetic radiation.25[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1181137] Far fromproviding a satisfyingly complete explanation of the universe, modern physicssuggests that we understand less than one twentieth of it. Moreover, some of thedark matter may be convertible into regular forms of energy. In 2010,observations of the centre of our galaxy showed that more gamma rays were beingemitted than could be accounted for by known sources, leading some physicists tosuggest that dark matter was being annihilated, giving rise to regular kinds ofenergy.26 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1181681]In the light of modern cosmology, how can anyone be sure that the total amountof matter and energy has always been the same? As we have just seen, thestandard kinds of matter and energy to which the conservation laws are supposedto apply are only a small fraction of the total amount of matter and energy.Most of the universe is composed of hypothetical dark matter and dark energywhose relationship to each other and to known kinds of matter and energy ismysterious. But the story becomes even more complicated. The amount of darkenergy may be increasing.Perpetual motion and the second law of thermodynamics From the very beginning of modern science, there has been a denial ofperpetual-motion machines as a matter of principle. Galileo proclaimed suchmachines could not exist, and so did most of the other founders of physics.27[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1182105] In thenineteenth century, Rudolf Clausius reformulated this prohibition in the secondlaw of thermodynamics, which states that heat cannot flow spontaneously from alower temperature to a higher temperature. In other words, heat does not flow‘uphill’ unless aided by the expenditure of energy.28[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_000.html#filepos1182654]Thermodynamics arose through the study of steam engines and was primarilyconcerned with heat, as the name ‘thermodynamics’ tells us. But the second lawwas soon generalised to cover other forms of energy as well. In general terms,this law gives a picture of energy flowing ‘downhill’, from a higher to a lowertemperature, just as water powering a waterwheel flows downhill. In a watermill,the total amount of water remains the same although its ability to power thewheel is lost as it falls. Moreover, only some of the energy lost by the fallingwater as it powers the wheel is converted into Knve abuseful work. Some is lostin friction and as heat; no machine is 100 per cent efficient.From a thermodynamic point of view, machines are energy conversion devices, andonly some of the energy can be converted into work. The rest is lost; it isdissipated into the surroundings as heat. This lost energy that cannot do workis measured in terms of entropy. In other words, entropy is a measure of theamount of energy that is not available for doing useful work in a machine or inany other thermodynamic process. More abstractly, the second law ofthermodynamics states that spontaneous natural processes lead to an increase inentropy. Or, again, the entropy of a closed system always increases or remainsconstant: it does not decrease. This increase of entropy gives an arrow to time,and means that spontaneous processes are always running ‘downhill’ from athermodynamic point of view.When the second law of thermodynamics was generalised to the entire universe, itimplied that the universe was like a machine running out of steam. Entropy wouldgo on increasing until the universe froze for ever, the state described byWilliam Thomson in 1852 as ‘a state of universal rest and death’.29[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1183066] The ultimateheat death of the universe was the concept that underpinned Bertrand Russell’svision of ‘the debris of a universe in ruins’.30[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1183479]By contrast, evolutionary biology showed life evolving towards greater andgreater complexity. The arrows of time in biology and physics were pointing inopposite directions. At first, this seeming disagreement was explained in termsof different time scales. Biological evolution was a temporary phenomenon onearth, but like the earth itself, it was ultimately doomed. But speculationabout an ultimate heat death faded away when the Big Bang theory became orthodoxin the 1960s. Cosmology itself became evolutionary: the universe began verysmall and very hot with little or no structure. As it grew and cooled, ever morecomplex forms of organisation came into being. Nevertheless some cosmologicalmodels suggested that this expanding, evolving universe would still come to anend: the gravity of the universe, magnified by the presence of dark matter,would make the universal expansion slow down, stop, and then give way to anever-accelerating cosmic contraction, ending in a reverse of the Big Bang, theBig Crunch. Old-style cosmic pessimism based on the heat-death theory wasreplaced by a new kind.In the late 1990s, the Big Crunch theory was replaced by a new vision ofcontinued cosmic expansion powered by dark energy. In the current consensus,dark energy provides the motive force for the expansion of the universe,counteracting the gravitational pull that would otherwise cause it to contract.In most Kact currenttheoretical models, the density of dark energy in theuniverse is assumed to be constant; in other words, the amount of dark energy ina fixed physical volume remains the same. But the universe is expanding; itsvolume is increasing. Hence the total amount of dark energy in the universe isincreasing.31 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1184031]The total amount of energy is not always the same. Far from running out ofsteam, the universe is now like a perpetual-motion machine, expanding because ofdark energy, and creating more dark energy by expanding.In the model currently favoured by most cosmologists, dark energy is uniformthroughout the cosmos, but some models of dark energy propose that it arisesfrom a ‘quintessence’ field that varies from place to place and time to time.The term ‘quintessence’, meaning ‘fifth element’, was borrowed from the ancientGreek term for the aether, which was thought to fill the universe. Quintessenceinteracts with matter and changes as the universe grows. It can also transformitself into new forms of hot matter or radiation, giving rise to new matter andenergy.32 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1184579]Although the details differ, the creation of new matter and energy from thequintessence field recalls Hoyle’s theory of the continuous creation of newmatter and energy from a ‘creation field’.In this context, the laws of conservation of matter and energy seem less likeultimate cosmic principles and more like rules of accountancy that workreasonably well for most practical purposes in the realms of terrestrial physicsand chemistry, where exotic possibilities like quintessence and the creation ofdark energy can be ignored. In biology, the principle of conservation of energyis also a useful working assumption, but it may turn out to have papered oversome fundamental cracks, as discussed below. Even in physical systems on earth,there may be energy conversion processes that have so far remained outside thescope of science, but which could be of practical importance in newtechnologies.Alternative energy technologies Scientific dogmas create taboos, with the result that entire areas of researchand enquiry are excluded from mainstream science and from regular sources offunding. The result is ‘fringe’ science, kept beyond the pale of orthodoxy byautomatic scepticism. As we have seen, one of the oldest and strongest taboos inscience is against perpetual-motion machines, and this taboo extends to almostany kind of unconventional energy-generating device.Many people claim to have made devices that produce ‘free’ energy usingunconventional means. But they do not usually claim to have inventedperpetual-motion machines. Instead they suggest that their devices are drawingon sources of energy that are usually untapped. Just as wind- and solar-powerdevices use freely available forms of energy, so some people claim to have madedevices that tap into the zero-point energy or quantum-vacuum field, drawing onunlimited reserves of free power, while some claim to have found new ways ofusing electrical and magnetic forces. A search on the Internet for ‘free energydevices’ leads to a bewildering variety of Kg vf enclaims and procedures. Sodoes a search for ‘over unity devices’. The term ‘over unity’ refers to theability of a machine to produce more energy than is put into it. Sceptics claimthat all these devices are impossible and/or fraudulent, and some promoters of‘free energy’ devices may indeed be fraudulent. But can we be sure that they allare?Do any of these devices really work? And if they do, why have they not alreadybeen taken up by entrepreneurs and marketed? One answer is that it is difficultto promote a device that appears to break the perpetual-motion taboo. As soon asa potential investor asks a scientific adviser, he is likely to be told that thedevice is impossible and would be a waste of money. But perhaps some of thesedevices really do work, and really can tap into new sources of energy.This is an area in which offering a prize might provide the best way forward. Inthe history of science and technology, prizes have spurred several importantinnovations and also enabled inventors to attract publicity for theirachievements. One of the first examples was the Longitude Prize, set up by theBritish government in 1714 for finding an accurate method to determine longitudeat sea.33 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1185008]Another example is the Gossamer Condor, the first human-powered aircraft capableof sustained flight, which won the Kremer Prize in 1977. This prize was set upby a British industrialist, Harry Kremer, who offered £50,000 for the firstgroup to fly a human-powered aircraft over a figure-of-eight course a mile long.The Gossamer Condor design was inspired by hang-gliders made of new lightweightmaterials and powered by an amateur cyclist. Its inventors went on to build theGossamer Albatross, which flew twenty-two miles across the English Channel,winning the second Kremer Prize in 1979.Current examples of incentivised challenges include the $10 million X Prizes,given by the X Prize Foundation ‘to create radical breakthroughs for the benefitof humanity thereby inspiring the formation of new industries, jobs and therevitalisation of markets’.34[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1185419]A prize for the most effective ‘over unity’ energy device might change thesituation in energy research dramatically. In fair tests, conducted in anopen-minded spirit of enquiry, some devices may indeed produce more energy thanis put into them from conventional sources. Or perhaps the contest will revealthat no such devices exist, and no one will win the prize, giving scientificconservatives the pleasure of saying, ‘I told you so.’Energy conservation in living organisms Until some of the theories of modern cosmology came along, energy conservationwas uncontroversial in physics. But in biology, the situation was – and still is– less clear.From the seventeenth century onwards, believers in the mechanistic philosophyasserted that living organisms were machines. Vitalists disagreed. This debateplayed an important part in the emergence of the idea of conservation of energy,especially in the work of Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–94). Although he isusually remembered as a leading German physicist, he was a medical doctor in thePrussian Army as a young man; his first researches were in physiology. When hewas studying in Berlin, the vitalist doctrine held sway, teaching that livingorganisms depended on a ‘life force’ in addition to food, air and water.Helmholtz was an ardent believer in the mechanistic theory of life, and he madeit his mission to rid biology of vitalism. At first he tried to refute theexistence of vital force experimentally by studying the heat generated in themuscles of frogs’ legs when they were stimulated to contract by electricalimpulses. But it was hard to get clear-cut results so, having failed to prove itexperimentally, he adopted a theoretical approach. He argued on philosophicalgrounds that perpetual-motion machines were impossible. Then, assuming thatliving organisms were indeed machines, he concluded that ‘vital forces’ did notexist. In 1847, when he was still only twenty-six, he published a memoirentitled ‘On the Conservation of Force’ that unified ideas about theconservation of force in living organisms, in physics and in machinery.35[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1185714]Helmholtz’s ideas were a major ingredient in the consensus on energyconservation that emerged in the 1850s. Living organisms were machines likeeverything else and obeyed the same laws, to which was now added the law ofconservation of energy. From then onwards, this assumption was treated as anestablished fact. Indeed, as the mathematician Henri Poincaré pointed out, thevery generality of the laws of conservation of matter and energy meant ‘they areno longer capable of verification’.36[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1186395] Any evidencethat went against them could be dismissed as flawed or fraudulent, or explainedby invoking new forms of matter or energy hitherto unobserved.Is the conservation of energy testable? Helmholtz soon abandoned his attempts to prove the conservation of energy infrogs’ legs. Other early attempts to measure the heat output compared with theenergy released by respiration showed serious discrepancies, with 20 per centmore heat being produced than expected,37[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1186955] but themethods were crude and inaccurate. It was not until the 1890s that the energybalance of an animal was measured rigorously, long after the conservation lawshad been assumed to apply to living organisms.Max Rubner, working in Berlin, kept a dog in a specially constructed chamber,called a respiration calorimeter, for five weeks. The substance and energycontent of its food were measured and its urine, faeces, carbon dioxide outputand heat production were analysed. He found that the heat loss from the bodyagreed well with calculations of the amount of food material that was oxidised,with 99.7 per cent accuracy.38[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1187373] This wasexactly what materialists wanted to hear, and the result was proclaimed to bethe ‘death knell of vitalism.39[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1187783]In the United States, in the early twentieth century, Wilbur Atwater and FrancisBenedict carried out similar studies with human subjects using respirationcalorimeters in order to ‘demonstrate that man operated under the same laws thatgovern inanimate reactions’.40[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1188061] Like Rubner,the American researchers calculated the amount of energy that should have beenreleased by the amount of food oxidised, and compared it with the energy outputin terms of heat production plus work. The average for all their experimentsgave a near-perfect agreement between measurements and calculations, just asthey had expected.41[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1188471] This resultwas so convincing that it was unchallenged for more than seventy-five years.42[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1188881]However, several other investigators were unable to replicate the expectedresults, and in a symposium on clinical calorimetry sponsored by the AmericanMedical Association in 1921, a common complaint was that ‘inexperiencedoperators were using the devices and obtaining inaccurate results’.43[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1189291] This commenthighlights a general problem in scientific research. Results that agree withexpectations are readily accepted, while those that do not are dismissed asflawed. And some experiments really are flawed – including some that give theexpected results. Scientists, K. So no like most other people, accept evidencethat agrees with their beliefs much more readily than evidence that contradictsthem. This is one reason why established orthodoxies in science remainestablished.In the late 1970s, Paul Webb reinvestigated human energy balances in hislaboratory in Ohio, with surprising results. The figures simply did not add up,especially when subjects were over-eating or under-eating. He looked again atthe data from Atwater and Benedict’s research, and found that some of theirexperiments showed serious discrepancies under conditions of vigorous exerciseor under-eating. Atwater and Benedict’s near-perfect results were arrived at byaveraging data where too much or too little energy was consumed. Webb also foundpuzzling discrepancies in other previous studies. He concluded, ‘The morecareful the study, the more clearly there is evidence of energy not accountedfor.’44 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1189842]In Webb’s own experiments, he took a careful tally of the food eaten over athree-week period, changes in body weight, heat and other forms of energyoutput, as well as measuring rates of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxideproduction. He found that more energy was being used than he could explain. Hedid not question the law of conservation of energy, but instead suggested thatthere was an as yet unrecognised and unmeasured kind of energy, which he calledx. Taking all the studies together, x was on average 27 per cent of the totalmetabolic expenditure; in other words, more than a quarter of the energy wasunaccounted for. Subsequent studies revealed further discrepancies in the energybalances of people who were gaining or losing weight, in pregnant women and ingrowing children.45[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1190255]No one seemed worried about the problems revealed by Webb’s research. Theconservation of energy was not a question of evidence but an article of faith.However, a modern-day vitalist could assert that there is a vital force at workin living organisms, over and above the standard forms of energy known tophysics. A yogi could speak in terms of prana, or an acupuncturist in terms ofchi. Do the available data rule out any kind of energy not yet known to physics?Is present-day nutrition science so precise that it can explain every detail ofenergetic activity in animals and people? The answer is ‘no’. Careful, preciseresearch might ultimately support the orthodox dogma, but at present it is anassumption, not a fact. Although most people do not realise it, there is ashocking possibility that living organisms draw upon forms of energy over andabove those recognised by standard physics and chemistry.One easy starting point for research would be to find out how some people andother animals seem to survive even though they Kn te e eat very little food. Itis well established that eating much less than usual can have beneficialeffects. A reduced intake of calories, or ‘caloric restriction’, improveshealth, slows the ageing process and increases lifespan in a wide variety ofspecies, including yeast, nematode worms, fruit flies, fish, rodents, dogs andpeople.Inedia A far greater challenge is presented by recurrent stories of people who seem tobe able to live for months or years without eating. This phenomenon is known asinedia (Latin for ‘fasting’). Of course such stories violate common sense:everybody knows that people, and animals, need food in order to stay alive.I first heard of this phenomenon when my wife and I visited Jodhpur, inRajasthan, India, in 1984. An Indian friend took us to visit a local holy womancalled Satimata in the nearby village of Bala. We were told that when herhusband died in 1943, when she was about forty years old, she wanted to immolateherself on his funeral pyre in the tradition of suttee, but she was preventedfrom doing so. Instead, she vowed never to eat again. When we met her, she wassupposed to have lived for forty-three years without food or drink, and withoutproducing faeces or urine. Yet she looked like a normal elderly village woman,apart from the fact that she was surrounded by devotees. While we were there shehad a cold and had to blow her nose several times. So she seemed to be defyingnot only the law of conservation of energy but also the law of conservation ofmatter, generating mucus but taking in no food or water.Of course I assumed that she must have been eating and drinking secretly. Yether devotees were adamant that she was genuine. Some had known her for years,even lived with her, so had had the opportunity to see if she was eating behindthe scenes. Either they were part of a conspiracy, or she was a very skilleddeceiver. My scepticism was an immediate mental reflex. But when I met her, andtalked to people who knew her, she did not strike me as a charlatan, but as awoman of sincere religious faith. I later found that she was not unique: otherholy men and women in India were supposed to have lived without food for years.Some had been exposed as frauds, but others had been investigated by medicalteams who found no evidence of secret eating.In India, the explanation most commonly advanced for the ability to live withoutfood is that the energy is derived from sunlight or from the breath, and inparticular from prana, a life force in the breath. This is why some people whoclaim to live with little or no food call themselves ‘breatharians’.Interestingly, the prana theory does not in itself challenge the principle ofconservation of energy: it suggests that some people can derive all their energyfrom a source other than food.In 2010, a team from the Indian Defence Institute of Physiology and AlliedSciences (DIPAS Kienspa) investigated an eighty-three-year-old yogi calledPrahlad Jani, who lived in the temple town of Anbaji in Gujarat. His devoteesclaimed that he had not eaten for seventy years. In the DIPAS study, he was keptfor two weeks in a hospital under continuous observation and filmed on CCTVcameras. He had several baths and gargled, but the medical team confirmed thathe ate and drank nothing, and passed no urine or faeces. A previous medicalinvestigation in 2003 had given similar results. The director of DIPAS said, ‘Ifa person starts fasting, there will be some changes in his metabolism but in hiscase we did not find any.’46[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1190665] This is animportant point, because surviving a two-week fast is in itself not particularlyimpressive. Most people could do that, but there would be very noticeablephysiological changes while they did so.In the West, there have also been many claims that people can live for longperiods without eating, including holy men and women like St Catherine of Siena(died 1380), St Lidwina (died 1433), who was said to have eaten nothing fortwenty-eight years; the Blessed Nicholas von Flüe (died 1487), nineteen years;and the Venerable Domenica dal Paradiso (died 1553), twenty years. In thenineteenth century, two saintly women were said to have eaten nothing for twelveyears except consecrated wafers in holy communion: Domenica Lazzari (died 1848)and Louise Lateau (died 1883).47[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1191079] In thenineteenth century there was also a widespread ‘fasting girl’ phenomenon inEurope and the United States. Some may have been anorexic, others were exposedas frauds; but there are some well-documented cases where girls lived for yearswithout eating.Herbert Thurston, a Jesuit scholar, documented this fascinating phenomenon inhis classic study The Physical Phenomena of Mysticism (1952). He pointed outthat not all cases of inedia occurred in particularly spiritual people. Forexample, a Scottish girl, Janet McLeod, seemed to survive without food for fouryears. She was investigated quite thoroughly and the case was reported in thePhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1767. This young woman wasseriously sick rather than saintly.In the eighteenth century, Pope Benedict XIV asked the medical faculty of theUniversity of Bologna to investigate cases of inedia. In their report, whilefully recognising the likelihood of imposture, credulity and mal-observation,the doctors upheld ‘the genuineness of certain well-attested examples of longabstinence from food though no supernatural causation could reasonably besupposed’.48 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1191493]As in the case of Janet McLeod, some of these cases seemed to result fromillnesses.The best-documented example in the twentieth century was the Bavarian mysticTherese Neumann (1898–1962). In 1922 she stopped eating solid food. On Fridaysshe had visions of the passion of Christ and, like some other Roman Catholicmystics, bled profusely from wounds on her hands and feet, known as stigmata.The astonishing nature of her prolonged fast as well as the stigmata attractedmuch public attention, and the Bishop of Regensburg appointed a commission toinvestigate the case, headed by a distinguished doctor. Therese was closelyobserved for two weeks by a team of nursing sisters. Relieving each other bypairs, two of the four were continually on duty, never letting the girl out oftheir sight. Observation of her over a fortnight proved to the satisfaction ofall unprejudiced persons that she did not during that period take either food ordrink. What is even more striking, a pronounced loss of weight that occurredduring the Friday ecstasies (owing to bleeding from her stigmata) was in eachcase made good during the two or three days that followed.49[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1191905]But, as Thurston recognised, no amount of evidence would alter the opinions ofcommitted sceptics, who declared her ‘a vulgar imposter’. After considering manyreligious and non-religious cases, he concluded, > We are forced to admit that quite a number of people, in whose case no> miraculous intervention can be supposed, have lived for years upon a pittance> of nourishing food which can be measured only by ounces; and upon this> evidence we shall be forced to admit the justness of the conclusion of Pope> Benedict XIV that mere continuation of life, while food and drink are> withheld, cannot be safely assumed to be due to supernatural causes.50> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1192317] If a pope and a leading Jesuit scholar favour a natural rather than supernaturalexplanation, what might it be? We will never find out by adopting a position ofdogmatic scepticism and pretending that the phenomenon does not exist.One starting point for research would be to find out where else in t Kereignheworld inedia occurs: it seems unlikely to be confined to India and the West. Andif it occurs elsewhere, is it more common among females than males, as it seemsto be in Europe?What relationship does it bear to the physiology of hibernation in animals?How is inedia related to ‘caloric restriction’?All these questions would greatly widen the scope of the science of nutrition,which is of increasing practical importance. About a billion people areclassified as undernourished, while more than a billion are overweight or obese.There is a wide variety of dieting methods and no clear scientific consensus onwhat works best.Including inedia within the field of science rather than keeping it beyond thepale might enable us to learn something important. By treating the laws ofconservation and matter and energy as testable hypotheses rather than revealedtruths, physiology and nutrition science would become more scientific, not lessso.Many people will confidently predict that all cases of inedia will be found tobe fraudulent or to have some other conventional explanation. They may turn outto be right. If they are, the conventional assumptions will be strengthened bynew evidence. But if they are wrong, we will learn something new that may raisebigger questions that go beyond the biological sciences. Are there new forms ofenergy that are not at present recognised by science? Or can the energy in thezero-point field, which is recognised by science, be tapped by living organisms?What difference does it make? The idea of matter as passive, and energy or force as the active principle ofnature, is fundamental to science. It is also an ancient conception in religioustraditions. The active principle is breath or spirit. Maybe there really is afree, creative spirit flowing through all nature, including the dark energy orquintessence through which the cosmos is growing. Our breath is part of thisuniversal flow. We have mechanised the flow of energy through windmills,waterwheels, steam engines, motors and electric circuits, but outside man-mademachines the flow is freer. Maybe the energy balances in galaxies, stars,planets, animals and plants are not always exact. Energy may not always beexactly conserved. And new matter and energy may arise from quintessence, moreat some times and in some places than at others.The flow of energy through living organisms may not depend only on the caloriccontent of food and the physiology of digestion and respiration. It may alsodepend on the way the organism is linked to a larger flow of energy in allnature. Terms like spirit, prana and chi may refer to a kind of energy thatmechanistic science has missed out but which would show up quantitativelythrough discrepancies in calorimeter studies. If such a form of energy exists,how is it related to the principles of physics, including the zero-point field?Physiology may be seriously incomplete, and may have a lot to learn fromnon-mechanistic systems of Kc sit relahealing, such as those of shamans,healers, and practitioners of yoga, ayurveda and acupuncture.Meanwhile, modern physics reveals vast invisible reservoirs of dark matter anddark energy, and the quantum-vacuum field is full of energy, interacting witheverything that happens. Maybe some of this energy can be tapped by new energytechnologies, with huge economic and social consequences.Questions for materialists Is your belief in the conservation of matter and energy an assumption, or is itbased on evidence? If so, what is the evidence? Do you think that dark matter is conserved? Can you accept that there may be a continuous creation of dark energy as theuniverse expands? If there is a vast amount of energy in the quantum-vacuum field, do you thinkthat we might be able to tap it?Summary In the Big Bang all the matter and energy in the universe suddenly appeared fromnowhere. Modern cosmology supposes that dark matter and dark energy now make up96 per cent of reality. No one knows what dark matter and energy are, how theywork or how they interact with familiar forms of matter and energy. The amountof dark energy seems to be increasing as the universe expands, and the‘quintessence field’ may give rise to new matter and energy, more in some placesthan others. The evidence for energy conservation in living organisms is weak,and there are several anomalies, like the apparent ability of some people tolive without food for long periods, that suggest the existence of new forms ofenergy. All quantum processes are supposed to be mediated through thequantum-vacuum field, also known as the zero-point field, which is not empty butfull of energy and continually gives rise to virtual photons and particles ofmatter. Could this energy be tapped in new technologies?3 Are the Laws of Nature Fixed? Most scientists take it for granted that the laws of nature are fixed. They havealways been the same as they are today, and will be for ever.Obviously this is a theoretical assumption, not an empirical observation. On thebasis of two or three hundred years of earthbound research, how can we be surethat the laws were always the same and always will be, everywhere?For most of science’s history, eternal laws of nature made sense. Either theuniverse was eternal and had needed no God to create it, or it had been made byGod and stayed the sa NpanAs soon as we begin to question them, eternal laws become problematic, for twomain reasons. First, the very idea of a law of nature is anthropocentric. Onlyhumans have laws. For the founders of modern science, the metaphor of law wasappropriate because they thought of God as a kind of cosmic emperor whose writran everywhere, and whose omnipotence acted as a cosmic law-enforcement agency.The laws of nature were eternal ideas in the mind of a mathematical God. But formaterialists there is no God and no transcendent mind in which these laws can besustained. So where are they? And why do they still share the traditionalattributes of God? Why are they universal, immutable and omnipotent, and why dothey transcend space and time?Some philosophers of science avoid these awkward questions by denying thatscientific laws are transcendent, eternal realities; they argue instead thatthey are generalisations based on observable behaviour. But this amounts to anadmission that the laws of nature evolve and may not be fixed for ever. In anevolutionary universe, nature evolves, so the generalisations that describenature must evolve as well. There is no reason to assume that the laws thatgovern molecules, plants and brains were all present at the moment of the BigBang, long before any of these systems existed.Nevertheless, whatever some philosophers may say, eternal laws are deeplyembedded in the thinking of most scientists. They are implicit in the scientificmethod. Any experiment should in principle be repeatable anywhere and at anytime. Observations should be replicable. Why? Because the laws of nature are thesame at all times and in all places.In this chapter, I suggest an alternative to eternal laws: evolving habits. Theregularities of nature do not depend on an eternal mind-like realm beyond spaceand time, but on a kind of memory inherent in nature.A belief in eternal laws is itself deeply habitual, and often unconscious. Tochange a habit of thinking, the first step is to become aware of it. And thishabit goes back a long way.Eternal mathematics The search by philosophers in ancient Greece for an eternal reality behind thechanging world of appearances led to very different answers, as we saw in theprevious chapter. The materialists thought that changeless atoms of matter wereeternal, while Pythagoras and his followers believed that the entire universe,especially the heavens, was ordered according to eternal non-material principlesof harmony. To understand mathematics was to link the human mind to the divineintelligence itself, which governed the creation with a transcendent perfectionand order.1 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1192967]The Pythagoreans were more than philosophers: they formed mystical communities,shared property in common, treated men and women as equals, had vegetarian dietsand believed S ant>Plato (428–348 bc) was strongly influenced by the Pythagoreans but went further.He generalised the notion of eternal mathematical truths to a wider vision ofForms or Ideas (Platonic Forms and Ideas are traditionally written with initialcapitals), or archetypes or universals, including not only mathematics but theForms of every object or quality, including horses, human beings, colours andgoodness. These Forms or Ideas exist in an immaterial, transcendent realm,outside space and time. The cosmos is ordered by this realm that transcends it.The horses that we experience in the world are like shadows or reflections ofthe eternal essence of the horse, the horse Idea beyond space and time. Allparticular things in the world that we experience through our senses arereflections of transcendent Forms.Plato famously compared the objects of sense experience to shadows in a caveexperienced by prisoners, permanently chained so they can watch only the blankcave wall, with their backs to a fire. All they see are the shadows on the wallcast by things passing in front of the fire. In Plato’s words, > See what will naturally follow if the prisoners are released and disabused of> their error. At first, when any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to> stand up and turn his neck round and walk and look towards the light, he will> suffer sharp pains; the glare will distress him, and he will be unable to see> the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows; and then> conceive someone saying to him that what he saw before was an illusion but> that now, when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards> more real existence, he has a clearer vision, what will be his reply? Will he> not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects> which are now shown to him?2> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1193516] Plato used the Greek word nous to signify the rational, immortal part of thesoul through which the Forms could be known. As ancient philosophy progressed,the terms logos and nous were used to signify mind, reason, intellect,organising principle, word, speech, thought, wisdom and meaning. Nous wasassociated both with human reason and the universal intelligence.3[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1194062]Many elements of Platonic philosophy were incorporated in Christian theology,and are implicit in the opening of St John’s gospel, which, like the rest of theNew Testament, was written in Greek. ‘In the beginning was the Word.’ ‘Word’with a capital W is the translation of logos. Not long before St John’s gospelwas written, the word logos took on a new significance in the Jewish world whenPhilo of Alexandria (20 bc–ad 50) linked it to Jewish philosophy. Philo was aGreek-educated Jew, and the official representative of the Jewish community inAlexandria to the Roman emperor Caligula. He used logos to mean an intermediarydivine being who bridged the gap between God and the material world. ThePlatonic Ideas were located in the logos, which Philo described as God’sinstrument in the creation of the universe. He compared God to a gardenerforming the world according to the pattern of the logos.In Europe from the fifteenth century onwards there was a revival of Platonism,which helped prepare the way for modern science. The founding fathers of modernscience, Copernicus, Galileo, Descartes, Kepler and Newton, were all essentiallyPlatonists or Pythagoreans. They thought that the business of science was tofind the mathematical patterns underlying the natural world, the eternalmathematical Ideas that underlie all physical reality. As Galileo expressed it,Nature was a simple, orderly system that ‘acts only through immutable laws whichshe never transgresses’. The universe was a ‘book written in the mathematicallanguage’.4 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1194611]Most great physicists expressed similar ideas. For example, in the nineteenthcentury Heinrich Hertz, after whom the unit of frequency is named, expressed itas follows:> One cannot escape the feeling that these mathematical formulae have an> independent existence and an intelligence of their own, that they are wiser> than we are, wiser even than their discoverers, that we get more out of them> than was originally put into them.5> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1195159] Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity was firmly in this tradition, andArthur Eddington, who provided the first evidence in favour of the theory,concluded that it pointed to the idea th So ttioat ‘the stuff of the world ismind stuff . . . [T]he mind stuff is not spread out in space and time: these arepart of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it’.6[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1195719] The physicistJames Jeans took a similarly Platonic view: ‘[T]he universe can be best pictured. . . as consisting of pure thought, the thought of what, for want of a widerword, we must describe as a mathematical thinker.’7[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1196278]Quantum theory extended Platonism to the very heart of matter, which old-styleatomists had regarded as hard, homogeneous stuff. In the words of WernerHeisenberg, one of the founders of quantum mechanics: > [M]odern physics has definitely decided for Plato. For the smallest units of> matter are not physical objects in the ordinary sense of the word: they are> forms, structures, or – in Plato’s sense – Ideas, which can be unambiguously> spoken of only in the language of mathematics.8> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1196695] The traditional assumption that the universe is governed by fixed laws andconstant constants is almost unquestioned. This assumption has led to a baroqueelaboration of theoretical speculation, including billions of extra universes asdiscussed below.How constant are the ‘fundamental constants’? Some constants are considered to be more fundamental than others, including thevelocity of light, c, the Universal Gravitational Constant, known to physicistsas Big G, and the fine-structure constant, ?, which is a measure of the strengthof interaction between charged particles, such as electrons, and photons oflight. Unlike the constants of mathematics, such as ?, the values of theconstants of nature cannot be calculated by mathematics alone: they depend onlaboratory measurements. As the name implies, the physical constants aresupposed to be changeless. They are believed to reflect an underlying constancyof nature. The standard assumption is that the laws and constants of nature arefixed for ever.Are the constants really constant? The values given in handbooks of physics doin fact change from time to time. They are continually adjusted by internationalcommittees of experts known as metrologists. Old values are replaced by new‘best values’ based on the latest data from laboratories around the world.Within their laboratories, metrologists strive for ever-greater precision. In sodoing, they reject unexpected data on the grounds they must be errors. Then,after deviant measurements have been weeded out, they average the valuesobtained at different times, and the final value is then subjected to a seriesof corrections. Finally, in arriving at the latest ‘best values’, internationalcommittees of experts then select, adjust a Secte=\"nd average data fromlaboratories around the world.Although the actual values change, most scientists take it for granted that theconstants themselves are really constant; the variations in their values aresimply a result of experimental errors. The latest values are the best, andprevious values are forgotten. However, some physicists, notably Paul Dirac(1902–84), speculated that at least some of the fundamental constants mightchange with time. In particular, Dirac proposed that the Universal GravitationalConstant might decrease slightly as the universe expands. But Dirac was notchallenging the idea of eternal mathematical laws: he was merely proposing thata mathematical law might govern the gradual variation of a constant. What about the data? All of the published values of constants vary with time,9[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1197111] but here Iwill discuss only three of them: the Universal Gravitational Constant, thefine-structure constant and the speed of light.The oldest of the constants, Newton’s Universal Gravitational Constant, Big G,is also the one that shows the largest variations. Towards the end of thetwentieth century, as methods of measurement became more precise, the disparityin measurements of G by different laboratories increased, rather thandecreased.10 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1197674]Between 1973 and 2010, the lowest value of G was 6.6659, and the highest 6.734,a 1.1 per cent difference (Figure 3.1). These published values are given to atleast three places of decimals, and sometimes to five, with estimated errors ofa few parts per million. Either this appearance of precision is illusory, or Greally does change. The difference between recent high and low values is morethan forty times greater than the estimated errors (expressed as standarddeviations).11 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1198095] [images/00004.jpg] > > Figure 3.1 Values of G (x 10-11m3kg-1s-2) at different times between 1973 and> 2010.12 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1198630] What if G really does change? Maybe it does so because measurements are affectedby changes in the earth’s astronomical environment, as the earth moves aroundthe sun and as the solar system moves within the galaxy. Or maybe there areinherent fluctuations in G. Such changes would never be noticed as long asmeasurements are averaged over time and across laboratories.In 1998, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology published valuesof G taken on different days, rather than averaging them to iron out variations,revealing that there was a remarkable range: for example, on one day the valuewas 6.73, a few months later it was 6.64, 1.3 per cent lower.13[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1201130]In 2002, a team led by Mikhail Gershteyn, of the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, published the first systematic attempt to study changes in G atdifferent times of day and night. G was measured around the clock for sevenmonths, using two independent methods. They found a clear daily rhythm, withmaximum values of G 23.93 hours apart, correlating with the length of thesidereal day, the period of the earth’s rotation in relation to the stars.Gershteyn’s team looked only for daily fluctuations, but G may well vary overlonger time periods as well; there is already some evidence of an annualvariation.14 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1201665]By comparing measurements from different locations, it should be possible tofind more evidence of underlying patterns. Such measurements already exist,buried in the files of metrological laboratories. The simplest and cheapeststarting point for this enquiry would be to collect the measurements of G atdifferent times from laboratories all over the world. Then these measurementscould be compared to see if the fluctuations are correlated.15[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1202081] If they are,we will discover something new.Another way of looking for real changes in nature is to compare astronomicalobservations of galaxies and quasars of different ages to see if there is anydifference in the light they emit that implies long-term changes in constants.The Australian astronomer John Webb has applied this approach to the finestructure constant,?.16[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1202654] Around theturn of the millennium, his team found that ? was slightly smaller in distantparts of the sky, suggesting that it had changed over billions of years.17[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1203202] At first manyphysicists assumed that Webb’s results must be due to errors, but by 2010 moredata from different parts of the sky not only confirmed Webb’s findings, butalso gave new results that were quite unexpected. The variation in ? depended onwhich way the telescopes were facing. The constant seemed to be larger on oneside of the universe than the other. The variation of fundamental constants isnow a matter of serious debate among physicists.18[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1203612] As Webb andhis colleague John Barrow pointed out, ‘If ? is susceptible to change, otherconstants should vary as well, making the inner workings of nature more ficklethan scientists ever suspected.’19[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1204024]Finally, what about the speed of light, c? According to Einstein’s theory ofrelativity, the speed of light Seedsizin a vacuum is an absolute constant, andmodern physics is based on this assumption.Not surprisingly, early measurements of the speed of light varied considerably,but by 1927, the measured values had converged to 299,796 kilometres per second.At the time, the leading authority on the subject concluded, ‘The present valueof c is entirely satisfactory and can be considered more or less permanentlyestablished.’20[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1204445] However, allaround the world from about 1928 to 1945, the speed of light dropped by about 20kilometres per second.21[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1204988] The ‘best’values found by leading investigators were in impressively close agreement witheach other. Some scientists suggested that the data pointed to cyclic variationsin the velocity of light.22[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1205568]In the late 1940s the speed of light went up again by about 20 kilometres persecond and a new consensus developed around the higher value. In 1972, theembarrassing possibility of variations in c was eliminated when the speed oflight was fixed by definition. In addition, in 1983 the unit of distance, themetre, was redefined in terms of light. Therefore if any further changes in thespeed of light happen, we will be blind to them because the length of the metrewill change with the speed of light. (The metre is now defined as the length ofthe path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second.) Thesecond is also defined in terms of light: it is the duration of 9 S,192,631,770periods of vibration of the light given off by cesium 133 atoms in a particularstate of excitation (technically defined as the transition between the twohyperfine levels of the ground state).How can the drop in c between 1928 and 1945 be explained? This remarkableepisode in the history of physics is now generally attributed to the psychologyof metrologists. Brian Petley, a leading British metrologist, explained it thus: > The tendency for experiments in a given epoch to agree with one another has> been described by the delicate phrase intellectual phase locking’. Most> metrologists are very conscious of the possible existence of such effects;> indeed ever-helpful colleagues delight in pointing them out! Aside from the> discovery of mistakes, the near completion of the experiment brings more> frequent and stimulating discussion with interested colleagues and the> preliminaries to writing up the work add a fresh perspective. All of these> circumstances combine to prevent what was intended to be ‘the final result’> from being so in practice, and consequently the accusation that one is most> likely to stop worrying about correction when the value is closest to other> results is easy to make and difficult to refute.23> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1205981] Existing theories of varying constants, like Paul Dirac’s, assume that thechanges are small, slow and systematic. Another possibility is that theconstants oscillate within fairly narrow limits, or even vary chaotically. Weare used to fluctuations in the weather and in human activities: newspapers andwebsites routinely report changes in the weather, stock-market indices, currencyexchange rates and the price of gold. Maybe the constants fluctuate too, andperhaps one day scientific periodicals will carry regular news reports on theirlatest values.The implications of varying constants would be enormous. The course of naturewould no longer seem blandly uniform; there would be fluctuations at the heartof physical reality. If different constants varied at different rates, thesechanges would create differing qualities of time.Multiple universes According to the Anthropic Cosmological Principle, the fact that the ‘laws’ and‘constants’ of nature are just right for human life on this planet requires anexplana Ses ologtion. If these laws and constants had been even slightlydifferent, carbon-based life would not exist. One response is to suggest that anIntelligent Designer fine-tuned the laws and constants of nature at the momentof the Big Bang so they were exactly right for the emergence of life and humanbeings. This is a modern version of deism. But an appeal to a divine mind,albeit of a remote, mathematical kind, is contrary to the atheistic spirit ofmuch modern science. Instead many cosmologists prefer to think that there areinnumerable actually existing universes besides our own, each with differentlaws and constants. In these ‘multiverse’ models the fact that we occupy auniverse that is just right for us is explained very simply. This is the onlyuniverse that we can actually observe precisely because it is the only one rightfor us. No designer or divine mind was involved in making it so.24[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1206526]The multiverse model is popular among cosmologists for two other reasons. First,models of an ultra-rapid period of inflation in the earliest stages of the BigBang suggest that if this period of inflation could generate one universe, ourown, it could also generate many others, and go on generating them.25[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1206938] This model,called eternal inflation, keeps creating ‘pocket’ universes, of which ours ismerely one. The other theoretical reason for the popularity of the multiverse issuperstring theory. This ten-dimensional theory and the relatedeleven-dimensional M-theory generate far too many possible solutions, whichcould correspond to different universes, as many as 10500.26[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1207216]Some theorists go even further. The cosmologist Max Tegmark proposes that anymathematically possible universe must exist somewhere: ‘Complete mathematicaldemocracy holds – mathematical existence and physical existence are equivalent,so that all mathematical structures exist physically as well.’ There is no needto limit the mathematics to superstring theory or even any other existingmathematical system. Tegmark observes that his theory ‘can be viewed as a formof radical Platonism’.27[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1207775]In old-style Platonism, the mathematical laws were treated as if they wereunique truths that transcended space and time, yet applied everywhere andalways. By contrast, multiverse theories assume that particular laws andconstants are built into each separate universe at the moment of its origin orBig Bang. They are somehow ‘imprinted’ in each universe. But how are theyremembered? How does an individual universe ‘know’ what laws and constants aregoverning it, as opposed to the different laws and constants of other universes?As the cosmologist Martin Rees expressed it, ‘The physical laws were themselves“laid down” in the Big Bang.’28[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1208321] But, headmitted, ‘The mechanisms that might “imprint” the basic laws and constants in anew universe are obviously far beyond anything we understand.’29[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1208862]Some physicists and cosmologists are unhappy with these speculations. A vastnumber of unobserved universes violates the canon of scientific testability.Multiverse supporters claim that mathematics itself, in the form of string andM-theories, provides evidence in favour of their speculations. But string andM-theories themselves, on which many of these speculations are based, areuntestable. One critic, Peter Woit, called his book on the subject Not EvenWrong.30 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1209274] Evengeneric predictions that superstring theory shares with other theories, such assupersymmetry, have not fared well. The theoretical physicist Lee Smolinsummarised the situation in 2006: > Hundreds of careers and hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent in the> last 30 years in the search for signs of grand unification, supersymmetry, and> higher dimensions. Despite these efforts, no evidence for any of these> hypotheses has turned up. A confirmation of any of these ideas, even if it> could not be taken as a direct confirmation of string theory, would be the> first indication that at least some parts of the package deal that string> theory requires have taken us closer to, rather than further from, reality.31> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1209684] Physicists who reject the multiverse theory have a variety of alternativesuggestions. Some pin their faith on what they call a ‘final theory’, a uniquemathematical formula that would predict every detail of our present universe,including all the so-called constants of nature. The uniqueness of the universewould then be a necessary consequence of mathematics.32[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1210096] This ultimatePlatonic dream is far from coming true. But suppose that physicists really didone day discover The Formula. The next questions would be: where did it comefrom? And why did it exist in the first place? The answer would probably be asuperformula. But where did that come from?Another class of speculative theories suggests that the universe is part of aseries of universes, the progeny of a previous one and the progenitor of thenext. This is like the ancient Hindu philosophy of great cosmic cycles: theuniverse is born from the cosmic egg under the aegis of the god Brahma, its lifeand activity is sustained by Vishnu, and it is Su, cient Hfinally destroyed byShiva. A new universe then arises. And so on. Or else the cycles are greatbreaths of Brahma, who breathes out a universe, breathes it in again, thenbreathes out another, and so on."},{"pageContent":"In modern cosmology, this ancient cyclic theory takes the form of the ‘bouncinguniverse’ model. After the Big Bang the universe expands for billions of yearsuntil its expansion slows down; it finally stops, and then begins to contractagain under the force of gravity, finally collapsing in on itself in a BigCrunch. This in turn is the beginning of a new universe – a Big Bounce.33[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1210374]One problem for this theory is that dark energy is currently thought to make theuniverse expand at an accelerating rate, so a collapse seems unlikely. To dealwith this problem, the mathematician Roger Penrose has suggested that theexponential expansion of the universe will ultimately dilute everything so muchthat it will iron out all space-time features. Black holes will evaporate, starsand galaxies will disassemble and even elementary particles will decay intophotons. Finally, the late universe will resemble the early universe except insize. Penrose magics this problem away by suggesting that, at these extremes,scale become irrelevant, and the late universe can become the early universe ofthe next in the series. Smolin has described this hypothesis as ‘deliciouslyabsurd, but just possibly true’.34[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1210788]What all these theories have in common is a belief in the primacy ofmathematics. Even if there are many universes besides our own, or a series ofprevious universes, what ultimately underlies these universes and sustains them?The answer is a mathematical formula transcending the universes it governs. Inother words, this is a new, extravagant form of Platonism.Evolutionary habits The alternative to Platonism is the evolution of the regularities of nature.They are more like habits, and grow stronger through repetition. There is a kindof memory in nature: what happens now is influenced by what happened before.Some habits run in very deep grooves and have been established for billions ofyears, like the habits of photons, protons and electrons, which existed beforethe first hydrogen atoms appeared about 370 million years after the Big Bang. Asthese first atoms arose they released the radiation presently observed as thecosmic microwave background.35[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1211200] Then, overbillions of years, molecules, stars, galaxies, planets, crystals, plants andhumanity appeared. Everything has evolved in time, even the chemical elements.At some point in the history of the universe the first carbon atoms, or iodineatoms, or gold atoms came into being.The ‘constants’ associated with these atomic habits, like the fine-structureconstant and the charge on the electron, are likewise very ancient. Amongmolecules, hydrogen, H2, is probably the oldest; it precedes stars and isabundant in the galactic clouds from which new stars are formed. The ‘laws’ and‘constants’ associated with these archaic patterns of organisation are so wellestablished that they show little or no change today.By contrast, some molecules are very new, like the hundreds of compounds madefor the first time by synthetic chemists in the twenty-first century. Here thehabits are still forming. So are new patterns of behaviour in animals, and newhuman skills.In the late nineteenth century, the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce(1839–1914; pronounced ‘purse’) pointed out that fixed laws imposed upon theuniverse from the outset are inconsistent with an evolutionary philosophy. Hewas one of the first to propose that the ‘laws of nature’ are more like habits,and suggested that the tendency to form habits grows spontaneously: ‘There wereslight tendencies to obey rules that had been followed, and these tendencieswere rules which were more and more obeyed by their own action.’36[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1211737] Peirceconsidered that ‘the law of habit is the law of mind’ and he saw the growingcosmos as alive. ‘Matter is merely mind deadened by the development of habit tothe point where the breaking up of these habits is very difficult.’37[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1212293]The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), writing around the sametime, went so far as to suggest that the ‘laws of nature’ underwent naturalselection: > At the beginning of things we may have to assume, as the most general form of> existence, a world which was not yet mechanical, which was outside all> mechanical laws, although having access to them. Thus the origin of the> mechanical world would be a lawless game which would ultimately acquire such> consistency as the organic laws seem to have now . . . All our mechanical laws> would not be eternal, but evolved, and would have survived innumerable> alternative mechanical laws.38> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1212571]> The philosopher and psychologist William James (1842–1910) wrote in a similarvein to Peirce: > If . . . one takes the theory of evolution radically, one ought to apply it> not only to the rock-strata, the animals and plants, but to the stars, to the> chemical elements, and to the laws of nature. There must have been a far-off> antiquity, one is then tempted to suppose, when things were really chaotic.> Little by little, out of all the haphazard possibilities of that time, a few> connected things and habits arose, and the rudiments of regular performance> began.39 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1212986] Likewise, Alfred North Whitehead suggested, ‘Time is differentiated from spaceby the acts of inheriting patterns from the past.’ This inheritance of patternmeant that habits built up. Whitehead said, ‘People make the mistake of talkingabout “natural laws”. There are no natural laws. There are only temporary habitsof nature.’40 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1213412]These philosophers were far ahead of their time. They thought the entireuniverse was evolutionary. But their physicist contemporaries still believed inan eternal universe, made of permanent matter and energy governed by changelesslaws, devolving towards a heat death, according to the second law ofthermodynamics. The Big Bang theory became orthodox only in the 1960s. AsPeirce, James and Whitehead saw so clearly, evolutionary cosmology implies theevolution of habits.Morphic resonance My own hypothesis is that the formation of habits depends on a process calledmorphic resonance.41[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1213960] Similarpatterns of activity resonate across time and space with subsequent patterns.This hypothesis applies to all self-organising systems, including atoms,molecules, crystals, cells, plants, animals and animal societies. All draw upona collective memory and in turn contribute to it.A growing crystal of copper sulphate, for example, is in resonance withcountless previous crystals of copper sulphate, and follows the same habits ofcrystal organisation, the same lattice structure. A growing oak seedling followsthe habits of growth and development of previous oaks. When an orb-web spiderstarts spinning its web, it follows the habits of countless ancestors,resonating with them directly across space and time. The more people who learn anew skill, such as snowboarding, the easier will it be for others to learn itbecause of morphic resonance from previous snowboarders.In summary, this hypothesis proposes that: > 1. Self-organising systems including molecules, cells, tissues, organs,> organisms, societies and minds are made up of nested hierarchies or holarchies> of holons or morphic units (Figure 1.1). At each level the whole is more than> the sum of the parts, and these parts themselves are wholes made up of parts.> 2. The wholeness of each level depends on an organising field, called a> morphic field. This field is within and around the system it organises, and is> a vibratory pattern of activity that interacts with electromagnetic and> quantum fields of the system. The generic name ‘morphic field’ includes> (a) Morphogenetic fields that shape the development of plants and> animals.> (b) Behavioural and perceptual fields that organise the movements,> fixed-action patterns and instincts of animals.> (c) Social fields that link together and co-ordinate the behaviour of> social groups.> (d) Mental fields that underlie mental activities and shape the habits> of minds.> 3. Morphic fields contain attractors (goals), and chreodes> (habitual pathways towards those goals) that guide a system towards its end> state, and maintain its integrity, stabilising it against disruptions (see> Chapter 5).> 4. Morphic fields are shaped by morphic resonance from all similar> past systems, and thus contain a cumulative collective memory. Morphic> resonance depends on similarity, and is not attenuated by distance in space or> time. Morphic fields are local, within and around the systems they organise,> but morphic resonance is non-local.> 5. Morphic resonance involves a transfer of form or in-form-ation> rather than a transfer of energy.> 6. Morphic fields are fie SielRegulSmallds of probability, like> quantum fields, and they work by imposing patterns on otherwise random events> in the systems under their influence.> 7. All self-organising systems are influenced by self-resonance from> their own past, which plays an essential role in maintaining a holon’s> identity and continuity. This hypothesis leaves open the question of how morphic resonance actuallyworks. There are several suggestions. One is that the transfer of informationoccurs through the ‘implicate order’, as proposed by the physicist David Bohm.42[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1214518] The implicateor enfolded order gives rise to the world we can observe, the explicate order,in which things are located in space and time. In the implicate order, accordingto Bohm, ‘everything is enfolded into everything’.43[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1214948] Or resonancemay pass through the quantum-vacuum field, also known as the zero-point energyfield, which mediates all quantum and electromagnetic processes (see Chapter2).44 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1215491] Orsimilar systems might be connected through hidden extra dimensions, as in stringtheory and M-theory.45[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1215968] Or maybe itdepends on new kinds of physics as yet unthought of.This hypothesis is eminently testable, and evidence from many fields of enquiryalready supports it. I discuss tests in the realm of biological development andanimal behaviour in Chapter 6, and in human learning in Chapter 7.Habits of crystallisation The hypothesis of morphic resonance predicts that when chemists make a newcompound for the first time, it might be difficult to obtain crystals of thiscompound because a morphic field for this crystal-form does not yet exist. Whenthe crystals appear for the first time, a new pattern of organisation comes intobeing. The second time the compound crystallises, there will be an influencefrom the first crystals by morphic resonance all over the world. The third time,there will be an influence from the first and the second crystals, and so on.This influence builds up cumulatively. A new habit develops. The more a compoundcrystallises, the easier its crystals should form.In fact, when chemists synthesise new chemicals, they often have greatdifficulty in getting them to crystallise. Sometimes it takes m Ses nionPro\">any years before crystals first appear. For example, turanose, a kind ofsugar, was considered to be a liquid for decades, until it first crystallised inthe 1920s. Thereafter it formed crystals all over the world.46[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1216443] In many othercases, new compounds crystallised with greater and greater ease as time went on.Even more striking are cases in which one kind of crystal appeared, and was thenreplaced by another. Xylitol, a sugar alcohol used as a sweetener in chewinggum, was first prepared in 1891 and was considered to be a liquid until 1942,when crystals first appeared. The melting point of these crystals was 61°C.After a few years another crystal form appeared, with a melting point of 94°C,and thereafter the first kind of crystals did not show up again.47[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1216868]Crystals of the same compound that exist in different forms are calledpolymorphs. Sometimes they coexist, like calcite and aragonite, both crystallineforms of calcium carbonate, or graphite and diamond, both crystalline forms ofcarbon. But sometimes, as in the case of xylitol, the appearance of a newpolymorph can displace an old one. This principle is illustrated in thefollowing account, taken from a textbook on crystallography, of the spontaneousand unexpected appearance of a new type of crystal in a factory: > [A] company was operating a factory which grew large single crystals of> ethylene diamine tartrate from solution in water. From this plant it shipped> the crystals many miles to another which cut and polished them for industrial> use. A year after the factory opened, the crystals in the growing tanks began> to grow badly; crystals of something else adhered to them – something which> grew even more rapidly. The affliction soon spread to the other factory: the> cut and polished crystals acquired the malady on their surfaces . . . The> wanted material was anhydrous ethylene diamine tartrate, and the unwanted> material turned out to be the monohydrate of that substance. During three> years of research and development, and another year of manufacture, no seed of> the monohydrate had formed. After that they seemed to be everywhere.48> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1217146] These authors suggest that on other planets, types of crystal that are common onearth may not yet have appeared, and a Speae=\"+1\" dd: ‘Perhaps in our own worldmany other possible solid species are still unknown, not because theiringredients are lacking, but simply because suitable seeds have not yet put inan appearance.’49[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1217832]The replacement of one polymorph by another is a recurrent problem in thepharmaceutical industry. For example, the antibiotic ampicillin was firstcrystallised as a monohydrate, with one molecule of water of crystallisation perampicillin molecule. In the 1960s it started to crystallise as a trihydrate,with a different crystal form, and despite persistent efforts, the monohydratecould not be made again.50[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1218243]Ritonavir, an AIDS drug made by Abbott Laboratories, was introduced in 1996. Thedrug had been on the market for eighteen months when chemical engineers found apreviously unknown polymorph. No one knew what had caused the change, and theAbbott team could not stop the new polymorph forming. Within a few days of itsdiscovery, it was dominating the production lines. Although the two polymorphshad the same chemical formula, the second form was only half as soluble as thefirst, so patients taking the normal prescribed doses would not absorb enough ofthe drug. Abbott had to withdraw Ritonavir from the market and launched a crashprogramme to get their original polymorph back. They eventually succeeded, butcould not make it reliably: they kept getting mixtures of the two forms. Thecompany finally decided to reformulate the drug as a capsule containing the drugin solution. It spent hundreds of millions of dollars on this process and alsolost an estimated $250 million dollars in sales the year the drug waswithdrawn.51 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1218668]The inability of chemists to achieve control of crystallisation is a seriouschallenge. ‘The loss of control is indeed disturbing, and might even call intoquestion the criterion of reproducibility as a condition for acceptance of aphenomenon as being worthy of scientific enquiry,’ wrote Joel Bernstein, in hisbook Polymorphism in Molecular Crystals.52[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1219078] The emergenceof new polymorphs makes it clear that chemistry is not timeless. It ishistorical and evolutionary, like biology. What happens now depends on what hashappened before.One possible explanation for the disappearance of polymorphs is that the newforms are more stable thermodynamically, and hence appear in preference to theolder forms; in competition with each other, the new forms win. Before the newforms existed, there was no competition; after they had come into being, theyturned up in laboratories all over the world, and the older forms disappeared.There is no doubt that small fragments of previous crystals can act as ‘seeds’or ‘nuclei’ facilitating the process of crystallisation from a supersaturatedsolution. That is why chemists assume that the spread of new crystallisationprocesses depends on the transfer of nuclei from laboratory to laboratory, likea kind of infection. One favourite story in the folklore of chemistry is thatmigrant scientists carry these seeds around the world from lab to lab. Somechemists are said to have beards that ‘harbour nuclei for almost anycrystallisation process’, in the words of a professor of chemical engineering atCambridge University.53[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1219625] Alternatively,the crystal ‘seeds’ are supposed to have been blown around in the atmosphere asmicroscopic particles of dust, before settling in crystallising dishes,catalysing the crystallisation of the new substance. An American chemist, C. P.Saylor, commented, that it was as if ‘the seeds of crystallisation, as dust,[were] carried upon the winds from end to end of the earth’.54[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1220060] Thus the formation of new kinds of crystals provides one way of testing thehypothesis of morphic resonance. According to the conventional assumption,crystals should not form more readily in a laboratory in Australia after theyhave been made in a laboratory in Britain if visitors from the Britishlaboratory are rigorously excluded, and if dust particles are filtered out ofthe atmosphere. If they do form more rapidly, this result would favour morphicresonance. I discuss further tests with crystals in my book A New Science ofLife.55 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1220476]Habit and creativity Habits alone cannot explain evolution. They are by their very natureconservative. They account for repetition, but not for creativity. Evolutionmust involve a combination of these two processes: through creativity, newpatterns of organisation arise; those that survive and are repeated becomeincreasingly habitual. Some new patterns are favoured by natural selection andothers are not.Creativity is a mystery precisely because it involves the appearance of patternsthat have never existed before. Our usual way of explaining things is in termsof pre-existing causes: the cause somehow contains the effect; the effectfollows from the cause. If we apply this way of thinking to the creation of anew form of life, a new work of art, or a new idea, we infer that the newpattern of organisation was already present: it was a latent possibility. Giventhe appropriate circumstances, this latent pattern becomes actual. It isdiscovered rather than created. Creativity consists in the manifestation ofeternally pre-existing possibilities. In other words, the new pattern has notbeen created at all; it has only been manifested in the physical world, whereaspreviously it was unmanifest.This in essence is the Platonic theory of creativity. All possible forms havealways existed as timeless Forms, or as mathematical potentialities implicit inthe eternal laws of nature: ‘The possible would have been there from all time, aphantom awaiting its hour; it would therefore have become reality by theaddition of something, by some transfusion of blood or life,’ as Henri Bergsonexpressed it.56[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1220891] Bergson(1859–1941) was an evolutionary philosopher far ahead of his time, andinfluenced William James and Alfred North Whitehead. In his most famous book,Creative Evolution, he was very clear on what a profound break the concept ofevolution made with the habits of Platonic thought: > The ancients, Platonists to a greater or lesser degree . . . imagined that> Being was given once and for all, complete and perfect, in the immutable> system of Ideas; the world which unfolds before our eyes could therefore add> nothing to it; it was, on the contrary, only diminution or degradation; its> successive states measured as it were the increasing or decreasing distance> between what is, a shadow projected in time, and what ought to be, Idea set in> eternity. The moderns, it is true, take a quite different point of view. They> no longer treat Time as an intruder, a disturber of eternity; but they would> very much like to reduce it to a simple appearance. The temporal is, then,> only the confused form of the rational . . . The real becomes once more the> eternal, with this simple difference, that it is the eternity of the Laws in> which the phenomena are resolved instead of being the eternity of the Ideas> which serve them as models.57> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1221437] Eternal Forms or laws seemed appropriate enough in an eternal universe. They arethrown into question by evolution, a process of creative development. Creativityis real; new patterns of organisation appear as the world develops. Everythingnew that happens is possible in the tautological sense that only the possiblecan happen. Bergson argued that we need not attribute to these possibilities,which are unknowable until they actually happen, a pre-existent realitytranscending time and space.By contrast, the theory of evolution by natural selection was not Platonic. Itwas based on observations of fossils and actual living organisms. For CharlesDarwin, the source of evolutionary creativity was not beyond nature, in theeternal designs and plans of a machine-making God, the God of Paley’s naturaltheology (see Chapter 1). The evolution of life took place spontaneously. Natureitself, or herself, has given rise to all the myriad forms of life.Henri Bergson attributed this creativity to the p> an>élan vital or vitalimpetus. Like Darwinians, Marxists and other believers in emergent evolution, hedenied that the evolutionary process was designed and planned in advance in themind of a Platonic God. Instead, evolution is spontaneous and creative: > Nature is more and better than a plan in course of realisation. A plan is a> term assigned to a labour: it closes the future whose form it indicates.> Before the evolution of life, on the contrary, the portals of the future> remain wide open. It is a creation that goes on for ever in virtue of an> initial movement. This movement constitutes the unity of the organised world –> a prolific unity, of an infinite richness, superior to any that the intellect> could dream of, for the intellect is only one of its aspects or products.58> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1221979]What difference does it make? Abandoning the dogma of fixed laws liberates our understanding of evolution. TheBig Bang theory locates cosmic creativity at the beginning. In the originalmiracle, all the laws of nature and all the matter and energy in the universesuddenly arose from nothing, or from the wreckage of a previous universe. Bycontrast, a radically evolutionary view of nature implies an ongoing creativity,establishing new habits and regularities as nature evolves. Human creativity ispart of a vast creative process that has been unfolding through the whole ofevolution.The inheritance of habits by morphic resonance makes a big difference in theunderstanding of the inheritance of form, learning and memory, as discussed inChapters 6 and 7.When chemists make new chemical compounds that, as far as we know, have neverexisted on earth, they should show an increasing ease of crystallisation as timegoes on, as discussed above. But what if these crystals have existed on otherplanets? If morphic resonance does not fall off with distance, then these newcrystals should be influenced by morphic resonance from crystals of the samekind on other planets, and should crystallise readily, without an apparentlearning effect.Hence it should be possible to discover which new chemicals are unique to theearth and which have existed elsewhere. If the rate of crystallisation of, say,a thousand new chemicals is measured systematically, and if, say, 800 showincreasing rates of crystallisation while the other 200 do not, we could inferthat the latter have existed elsewhere in the universe, but the former have not.Inexpensively, we could find what is truly new on earth, and deduce somethingabout events on other planets, even though we do not know where those planetsare.Questions for materialists If the laws of nature existed before the Big Bang, and governed the Big Bangfrom its first instant, where were they? If the laws and constants of nature all came into being at the moment of the BigBang, how does the universe remember them? Where are they ‘imprinted’? How do you know that the laws of nature are fixed and not evolutionary? What is wrong with the idea that nature has habits rather than laws?Summary The idea that the ‘laws of nature’ are fixed while the universe evolves is anassumption left over from pre-evolutionary cosmology. The laws may themselvesevolve or, rather, be more like habits. Also, the ‘fundamental constants’ may bevariable, and their values may not have been fixed at the instant of the BigBang. They still seem to be varying today. There may be an inherent memory innature. All organisms may participate in a collective memory of their kind.Crystals may crystallise the way they do because they formed that way before;the more crystals of a particular chemical arise in one place, the easier shouldthey crystallise everywhere else on earth, and maybe throughout the universe.Evolution may be the result of an interplay between habits and creativity. Newforms and patterns of organisation appear spontaneously, and are subject tonatural selection. Those that survive are more likely to appear again as newhabits build up, and through repetition they become increasingly habitual.4 Is Matter Unconscious? The central doctrine of materialism is that matter is the only reality.Therefore consciousness ought not to exist. Materialism’s biggest problem isthat consciousness does exist. You are conscious now. The main opposing theory,dualism, accepts the reality of consciousness, but has no convincing explanationfor its interaction with the body and the brain. Dualist-materialist argumentshave gone on for centuries. In this chapter I suggest how we can move forwardsfrom this sterile opposition.Scientific materialism arose historically as a rejection of mechanistic dualism,which defined matter as unconscious and souls as immaterial, as I discuss below.One important motive for this rejection was the elimination of souls and God. Inshort, materialists treated subjective experience as irrelevant; dualistsaccepted the reality of experience but were unable to explain how minds affectbrains.The materialist philosopher Daniel Dennett wrote a book called ConsciousnessExplained (1991) in which he tried to explain away consciousness by arguing thatsubjective experience is illusory. He was forced to this conclusion because herejected dualism as a matter of principle: > I adopt the apparently dogmatic rule that dualism is to be avoided at all> costs. It is not that I think I can give a knock-down proof that dualism, in> all its forms, is false or incoherent, but that, given the way that dualism> wallows in mystery, accepting dualism is giving up [his italics].1> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1222756] The dogmatism of Dennett’s rule is not merely apparent: the rule is dogmatic. By‘giving up’ and ‘wallowing in mystery’, I suppose he means giving up science andreason and relapsing into religion and superstition. Materialism ‘at all costs’demands the denial of the reality of our own minds and personal experiences –including those of Daniel Dennett himself, although by putting forward argumentshe hopes will be persuasive, he seems to make an exception for himself and forthose who read his book.Francis Crick devoted decades of his life to trying to explain consciousnessmechanistically. He frankly admitted that the materialist theory was an‘astonishing hypothesis’ that flew in the face of common sense: ‘“You”, yourjoys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personalidentity and free will, are in fact no more than the behaviour of a vastassembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules.’2[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1223306] PresumablyCrick included himself in this description, although he must have felt thatthere was more to his argument than the automatic activity of nerve cells.One of the motives of materialists is to support an anti-religious worldview.Francis Crick was a militant atheist, as is Daniel Dennett. On the other hand,one of the traditional motives of dualists is to support the possibility of thesoul’s survival. If the human soul is immaterial, it may exist after bodilydeath.Scientific orthodoxy has not always been materialist. The founders ofmechanistic science in the seventeenth century were dualistic Christians. Theydowngraded matter, making it totally inanimate and mechanical, and at the sametime upgraded human minds, making them completely different from unconsciousmatter. By creating an unbridgeable gulf between the two, they thought they werestrengthening the argument for the human soul and its immortality, as well asincreasing the separation between humans and other animals.This mechanistic duali [anir asm is often called Cartesian dualism, afterDescartes (Des Cartes). It saw the human mind as essentially immaterial anddisembodied, and bodies as machines made of unconscious matter.3[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1223853] In practice,most people take a dualist view for granted, as long as they are not called uponto defend it. Almost everyone assumes that we have some degree of free will, andare responsible for our actions. Our educational and legal systems are based onthis belief. And we experience ourselves as conscious beings, with some degreeof free choice. Even to discuss consciousness presupposes that we are consciousourselves. Nevertheless, since the 1920s, most leading scientists andphilosophers in the English-speaking world have been materialists, in spite ofall the problems this doctrine creates.The strongest argument in favour of materialism is the failure of dualism toexplain how immaterial minds work and how they interact with brains. Thestrongest argument in favour of dualism is the implausibility andself-contradictory nature of materialism.The dualist-materialist dialectic has lasted for centuries. The soul-body ormind-brain problem has refused to go away. But before we can move forward, weneed to understand in more detail what materialists claim, since theirbelief-system dominates institutional science and medicine, and everyone isinfluenced by it.Minds that deny their own reality Most neuroscientists do not spend much time thinking about the logical problemsthat materialist beliefs entail. They just get on with the job of trying tounderstand how brains work, in the faith that more hard facts will eventuallyprovide answers. They leave professional philosophers to defend the materialistor physicalist faith.Physicalism means much the same as materialism, but rather than asserting thatall reality is material, it asserts that it is physical, explicable in terms ofphysics, and therefore including energy and fields as well as matter. Inpractice, this is what materialists believe too. In the following discussion Iuse the more familiar word materialism to mean ‘materialism or physicalism’.Among materialist philosophers there are several schools of thought. The mostextreme position is called ‘eliminative materialism’. The philosopher PaulChurchland, for example, claims that there is nothing more to the mind than whatoccurs in the brain. Those who believe in the existence of thoughts, beliefs,desires, motives and other mental states are victims of ‘folk psychology’, anunscientific attitude that will in due course be replaced by explanations interms of the activities of nerves. Folk psychology is a kind of superstition,like belief in demons, and it will be left behind by the onward march ofscientific understanding. Consciousness is just an ‘aspect’ of the activity ofthe brain. Thoughts or sensations are just another way of talking about activityin particular regions of the cerebral cortex; they are the same things talkedabout in different ways.Other materialists are ‘epiphenomenalists’: they accept rather than deny theexistence of consciousness, but see i [ss,ce=\"Mint as a functionless by-productof the activity of the brain, an ‘epiphenomenon’, like a shadow. T. H. Huxleywas an early advocate of this point of view, and in 1874 he famously comparedconsciousness to ‘the steam whistle that accompanies the work of a locomotiveengine . . . without influence upon its machinery’.4[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1224271] He concluded,‘We are conscious automata.’5[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1224821] People mightjust as well be zombies, with no subjective experience, because all theirbehaviour is a result of brain activity alone. Conscious experience doesnothing, and makes no difference to the physical world.A recent form of materialism is ‘cognitive psychology’, which dominated academicpsychology in the English-speaking world in the late twentieth century. Ittreats the brain as a computer and mental activity as information processing.Subjective experiences, like seeing green, or feeling pain, or enjoying music,are computational processes inside the brain, which are themselves unconscious.Some philosophers, like John Searle, think that minds can emerge from matter byanalogy with the way that physical properties can emerge at different levels ofcomplexity, like the wetness of water emerging from the interactions of largenumbers of water molecules. In nature, there are indeed many different levels oforganisation (Figure 1.1), each of which has new properties that are not presentin their parts alone. Atoms have properties over and above nuclear particles andelectrons. Molecules have properties over and above atoms: the molecules ofwater, H2O, are fundamentally different from uncombined hydrogen and oxygenatoms. Then the wetness of liquid water is not explained by water molecules inisolation, but through their organisation together in liquid water. New physicalproperties ‘emerge’ at every level. In the same way, consciousness is anemergent physical property of brains. It is different from other physicalprocesses, but it is physical none the less. Many non-materialists would agreewith Searle that consciousness is in some sense ‘emergent’ but would argue thatwhile mind and conscious agency originate in physical nature, they arequalitatively different from purely material or physical being.Finally, some materialists hope that evolution can provide an answer. Theypropose that consciousness emerged as a result of natural selection throughmindless processes from unconscious matter. Because minds evolved, they musthave been favoured by natural selection and hence they must actually dosomething: they must make a difference. Many non-materialists would agree. Butmaterialists want to have it both ways: emergent consciousness must do somethingif it has evolved as an evolutionary adaptation favoured by natural selection;but it cannot do anything if it is just an epiphenomenon of brain activity, oranother way of talking about brain mechanisms. In 201120an e/span>, thepsychologist Nicholas Humphrey tried to overcome this problem by suggesting thatconsciousness evolved because it helps humans survive and reproduce by making usfeel ‘special and transcendent’. But as a materialist, Humphrey does not agreethat our minds have any agency; that is to say, they cannot affect our actions.Instead our consciousness is illusory: he describes it as ‘a magical mysteryshow that we stage for ourselves inside our own heads’.6[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1225238] But to saythat consciousness is an illusion does not explain consciousness: it presupposesit. Illusion is a mode of consciousness.If all these theories sound unconvincing, that is because they are. They do noteven convince other materialists, which is why there are so many rival theories.Searle has described the debate over the last fifty years as follows: > A philosopher advances a materialist theory of the mind . . . He then> encounters difficulties . . . Criticisms of the materialist theory usually> take a more or less technical form, but, in fact, underlying the technical> objections is a much deeper objection: the theory in question has left out> some essential feature of the mind . . . And this leads to ever more frenzied> attempts to stick with the materialist thesis.7> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1225750] The philosopher Galen Strawson, himself a materialist, is amazed by thewillingness of so many of his fellow philosophers to deny the reality of theirown experience: > I think we should feel very sober, and a little afraid, at the power of human> credulity, the capacity of human minds to be gripped by theory, by faith. For> this particular denial is the strangest thing that has ever happened in the> whole history of human thought, not just the whole history of philosophy.8> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1226299] Francis Crick admitted that the ‘astonishing hypothesis’ was not proved. Heconceded that a dualist view might become more plausible. But, he added, > There is always a third possibility: that the facts support a new, alternative> way of looking at the mind-brain problem that is significantly different from> the rather crude materialistic view that many neuroscientists hold today and> also from the religious point of view. Only time, and much further scientific> work, will enable us to decide.9> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1226795]> > > > There is indeed a third way.> > Mental matter> > > > Galen Strawson shares the frustration of many contemporary philosophers with> the seemingly intractable problems of materialism and dualism.

Is there any evidence for the materialist belief that the entire evolutionaryprocess is purposeless?Summary Self-organising systems have their own ends or goals, attractors towards whichthey move. All living organisms show goal-directed development and behaviour.Developing plants and animals are attracted towards developmental ends, and iftheir development is disrupted they can often reach the same end by a differentpathway. Animal behaviour is directed towards ends or ‘consummatory acts’. Inphysics, goal-directed behaviour is modelled in terms of attractors, as iffuture ends had an influence working ‘backwards’ in time, and several quantumtheorists have proposed that causal influences move from the future towards thepast, as well as from the past towards the future. Chemical processes likeprotein folding also seem to be directed towards attractors or ends.End-directed behaviour is usually unconscious; even in humans, most purposes andgoals are habitual. Conscious purposes are the exception rather than the rule.Both evolution and progress can be interpreted in terms of attractors, withinfluences working backwards in time from future goals.6 Is All Biological Inheritance Material? ‘Like father, like son’ was a proverb in the Middle Ages; the Latin version,‘qualis pater talis filius’, played the same role in ancient Rome. The generalprinciples of heredity had been known all over the world for millennia: childrengenerally resemble their parents; they are usually more like members of theirimmediate family than unrelated people. It was also common knowledge that thesame principles apply to animals and plants. Long before Darwin’s theory ofevolution and the pioneering genetic research of Gregor Mendel, people werebreeding plants and animals selectively, creating an astonishing array ofdomesticated varieties, like dogs from Afghan hounds to Pekinese, and cabbagesfrom broccoli to kale.The discoveries of Mendel and Darwin were based on the practical successes ofmany generations of farmers and breeders. Darwin studied the subject for years.He subscribed to specialist publications like Poultry Chronicle and theGooseberry Growers’ Register, and grew fifty-four varieties of gooseberry in hisgarden at Down House, in Kent. He drew on the experience of cat and rabbitfanciers, horse and dog breeders, bee-keepers, horticulturalists and farmers. Hejoi fdon ned two of the London pigeon clubs, visited fanciers to see theirbirds, and kept all the breeds he could obtain. He summarised this wealth ofinformation in his book The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication(1868), which is one of my favourite books on biology. The power of selectivebreeding suggested that a similar process worked spontaneously in the wild:natural selection.Genetics is now at the very centre of biology. The standard view is thathereditary information is coded in the genes. The words ‘hereditary’ and‘genetic’ are treated as synonyms. After the discovery of the structure of DNAin 1953, the nature of heredity appeared to be fully understood in molecularterms, at least in principle. The human genome project, completed in the year2000, was a culminating technical triumph.From a materialist point of view, non-material inheritance is impossible, exceptfor cultural inheritance. Everyone agrees that cultural inheritance – say,through language – involves a transfer of information that is not genetic. Butall other forms of inheritance must be material: there is no other possibility.Several forms of material inheritance are known to be non-genetic. Cells inheritpatterns of cell organisation and structures like mitochondria directly fromtheir mother cells, not through genes in the cell nuclei. This non-nuclearinheritance is called cytoplasmic inheritance. Animals and plants are alsoinfluenced by characteristics acquired by their ancestors. An inheritance ofacquired characteristics can take place epigenetically, as opposed togenetically, through chemical changes that do not affect the underlying geneticcode, as discussed below.I look first at the unfamiliar idea of the non-material transmission of form andorganisation. This used to be the mainstream view; twentieth-century geneticsdeveloped in reaction against it. But even materialists end up with non-materialexplanations.Immaterial forms In the ancient world, almost no one believed that the form of an acanthus plantor a hawk was inherited through seeds or eggs alone. Platonists thought plantsand animals were somehow shaped by the transcendent Idea or Form of theirspecies. Modern Platonists, like René Thom, agree. They see the ideal Form of aspecies as a mathematical structure or model that is ‘reified’ in physicalplants or animals. The mathematical model for an acanthus plant is not embeddedin the genes: it exists in a mathematical realm that transcends space and time.Human mathematical models are mere approximations to these ultimate mathematicalarchetypes.Aristotle, Plato’s student, disagreed. The forms of the species were not outsidespace and ti k spspan>immanent, meaning ‘dwelling in’, not transcendent, meaning‘climbing beyond’. Instead of an archetype in a transcendent mind-like realm,the form of the body was in the soul, which attracted the developing animal orplant towards its final form (see pages 130–131). The soul served both as itsformal cause, the cause of the body’s form, and its final cause, the end or goaltowards which the organism was attracted.In the European Middle Ages, Aristotle’s theory, as modified and interpreted byThomas Aquinas, was the basis of the orthodox understanding of causation. Aprocess of change, like the growth of a walnut tree from a nut, involved fourkinds of cause. The material cause was the matter out of which the plant wasmade, the nut and the matter it took up from its surroundings as it grew, likewater and minerals from the soil. The moving cause was the energy that poweredit, from sunlight. The formal cause was the cause of the form or structure, thewalnut-tree form in the plant’s soul. The final cause was the goal or purpose ofthe plant’s growth, namely the mature tree producing nuts to reproduce itself.An architectural analogy provides another way of thinking about the four causes.In order to build a house, there must be building materials, like bricks andcement. These are the material causes. Putting them in the right places requiresthe energy of the builders and their machinery: these are the moving causes. Theplaces in which they put the materials are specified by the architect’s plan:this is the formal cause. All this activity is happening because the personpaying for the house wants to live in it: this is the purpose or final cause.All four causes are necessary: the house would not exist without the materialsof which it is made, or the energy of the builders, or a plan, or a motivationfor building it. In living organisms, immaterial souls provide both plans andpurposes.An essential feature of the mechanistic revolution in the seventeenth centurywas the abolition of souls, along with formal and final causes. Everything wasto be explained mechanistically in terms of material and moving causes. Thismeant that the source of an organism’s form must already be present inside thefertilised egg as a material structure.Pre-formation and new formation From the seventeenth century until the beginning of the twentieth, biologistswere divided into two main camps: the mechanists and the vitalists. Both neededto explain heredity. The vitalists continued the Aristotelian tradition:organisms were shaped by souls or non-material vital forces. The problem wasthat they could not say how these non-material forces worked or how theyinteracted with bodies. [images/00011.jpg] > Figure 6.1 A human sperm containing a little man, or homunculus, as seen by a> microscopist in the early eighteenth century. (After Cole, 1930) The mechanists preferred a material explanation, but they too soon ran intoproblems. To start with, they proposed that the animals and plants were alreadypresent in the fertilised egg in a miniature form. They were pre-formed.Development was a growth and unfolding – or inflation – of these pre-formedmaterial structures. A few pre-formationists believed that the tiny unexpandedorganisms came from eggs, but most thought they were in sperm, and some claimedto have proved it. One microscopist saw miniature horses in horse sperm, andminiature donkeys in donkey sperm, with big ears. Another saw tiny homunculi inhuman sperm (Figure 6.1).1[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1256355]Although pre-formationism was easy to understand and apparently supported bymicroscopic evidence, it ran into serious theoretical difficulties in relationto the succession of generations. As their vitalist opponents pointed out, if arabbit grows from a miniature rabbit in a fertilised egg, the tiny rabbit in theegg must contain even tinier rabbits in its gonads, and so on ad infinitum.2[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1256770]Pre-formationism was finally refuted in the late eighteenth century. Asresearchers looked at developing embryos in detail, they found that newstructures appeared that were not there before. For example, the intestine,formed by the infolding of a sheet of tissue from the ventral surface, produceda gutter which in time transformed itself into a closed tube.3[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1257321] By themid-nineteenth century the evidence was overwhelming: development involved theformation of new structures that were not already present. Development wasepigenetic, from the Greek epi, over and above, and genesis, origination. Newstructures appeared that were not already present in the egg.Epigenesis supported both Platonic and Aristotelian schools of thought. Neithersupposed that all of an organism’s form was contained in the matter of thefertilised egg. Its form was de ks fistrived from a Platonic Idea or a soul.By contrast, mechanists faced the daunting challenge of explaining how morematerial form could arise from less and develop in a highly ordered way. In the1880s, August Weismann (1834–1914) thought he had found the answer. He made atheoretical division of organisms into two parts, the body, or somatoplasm, andthe germ-plasm, a material structure present in the fertilised egg. He thoughtthe germ-plasm was an active agency, containing ‘determinants’ that shaped theform of the somatoplasm. The germ-plasm affected the somatoplasm but not viceversa. The determinants ‘directed’ the formation of the adult organism, but thegerm-plasm itself was passed on unchanged through eggs and sperm (Figure 6.1A). [images/00012.jpg] > Figure 6.1A: Weismann’s scheme for the continuity of the germ-plasm from> generation to generation, with organisms as transient entities.> B: The ‘central dogma’ of molecular biology in which Weismann’s scheme is> interpreted in terms of DNA and proteins. By the middle of the twentieth century, the discovery of genes located inchromosomes inside cell nuclei seemed to have confirmed Weismann’s theory. Thegenes were the germ-plasm, replicated more or less unchanged in every celldivision. The discovery of the structure of the genetic material, DNA, and thecracking of the genetic code in the 1950s showed how the Weismann doctrine couldbe reduced to the molecular level. DNA was the germ-plasm, proteins were thesomatoplasm (Figure 6.1B). The DNA coded for the structure of proteins, but notvice versa; Francis Crick called this the ‘central dogma’ of molecular biology.Meanwhile, the neo-Darwinian theory explained evolution in terms of randommutations in genes and changes in gene frequencies in populations as a result ofnatural selection. The triumphs of molecular genetics combined with theneo-Darwinian theory of evolution seemed to provide overwhelming evidence forthe material theory of inheritance. But this triumph was more a matter ofrhetoric than reality.Why genes are overrated There is a vast gulf between rhetoric about the powers of genes and what theyactually do. Investors in biotechnology are swept along by the metaphors, as arereaders of popular science. The problem goes right back to Weismann, who madethe determinants an active agency, controlling and directing the organism’sdevelopment. In effect, he endowed a special kind of matter, the germ-plasm,with the properties of the soul. Genetic programs and selfish genes aresimilarly endowed with vital powers, including the ability to ‘mould matter’ and‘create form’.4[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1257738]Thanks to the discoveries of molecular biology, we know what genes actually do.They code for the sequences of amino acids that are strung together inpolypeptide chains, which then fold up into protein molecules. Also, some genesare involved in the control of protein synthesis.DNA molecules are molecules. They are not ‘determinants’ of particularstructures, even though biologists often speak of genes ‘for’ structures oractivities, such as genes ‘for’ curly hair or ‘for’ nest-building behaviour insparrows. Genes are not selfish and ruthless, as if they contained gangsterhomunculi. Nor are they plans or instructions for organisms. They merely codefor the sequences of amino acids in protein molecules.Richard Dawkins has probably done more than any other author to popularisegenes. Unfortunately his vivid metaphors are highly misleading. For example,this is how he describes how all the cells of the human body contain copies ofthe complete set of human DNA: > This DNA can be regarded as a set of instructions for how to make a body . . .> It is as though, in every room of a gigantic building, there was a book-case> containing the architect’s plans for the entire building. The ‘book-case’ in a> cell is called the nucleus. The architect’s plans run to 46 volumes in humans> – the number is different in other species. The ‘volumes’ are called> chromosomes.5> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1258156] What Dawkins does is to project on to the DNA molecules the purposive vitalfactors of vitalism, trying to squeeze the soul into chemical genes, which arethereby endowed with instructions, plans, purposes and intentions they cannotpossibly have. He admits that these are metaphors, adding, ‘Incidentally, thereis of course no “architect”. ’6[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1258572] But despiteoccasional disclaimers, the entire force of his argument depends onanthropocentric metaphors and molecules that have come to life. He is a vitalistin molecular clothing.The metaphor of the genetic program is another kind of crypto-vitalism. Thepurposive vital factor is a computer program. This metaphor attempts to bridgethe gulf between hereditary characteristics – say, the k ok-case form of asunflower – and the DNA and protein molecules within it. If the genes somehowprogram the development of the sunflower, then the gulf between this complexliving structure and the DNA molecules within it seems less disturbing, eventhough almost nothing is known about the nature of the sunflower program and howit produces a sunflower.The metaphor of the genetic program inevitably suggests that development isorganised by a pre-existing purposive principle that is either mind-like ordesigned by a mind. Computer programs are intelligently designed by human mindsfor particular purposes, and act upon and through the electronic machinery of acomputer. The computer is a machine, but the program is not.Significantly, the analogy between programs and souls played a central role inthe thinking of one of the founders of modern computational theory, Alan Turing.As a young man, he was intensely preoccupied with the question of survival,following the death of his beloved friend Christopher Morcomb in 1930. At firsthe adopted a traditional dualistic view, arguing in favour of a non-materialspirit. He later found a more scientific-sounding model of the mind as a systemof programs. Such programs could be ‘embodied’ in particular physical machinesbut were themselves independent of material incarnation.7[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1258988] The programcould survive the destruction of any particular computer, and be embodied inanother one, like a transmigrating soul.If genetic programs were carried in the genes, then all the cells of the bodywould be programmed identically, because in general they contain exactly thesame genes. The cells of your arms and legs, for example, are geneticallyidentical. Your limbs contain exactly the same kinds of protein molecules, aswell as chemically identical bone, cartilage and nerves. Yet arms and legs havedifferent shapes. Clearly, the genes alone cannot explain these differences.They must depend on formative influences that act differently in differentorgans and tissues as they develop. These influences cannot be inside the genes:they extend over entire tissues and organs. At this stage, in most conventionalexplanations, the concept of the genetic program fades out, and is replaced byvague statements about ‘complex spatio-temporal patterns of physico-chemicalactivity not yet fully understood’ or ‘mechanisms as yet obscure’ or ‘chains ofparallel and successive operations that build complexity’.8[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_012.html#filepos1259405]In spite of the fact that many biologists now recognise that it is misleading,the genetic program continues to play a large conceptual role in modern biology.There seems to be a need for such an idea. Mechanistic biology grew up inopposition to vitalism. It defined itself by denying that living organisms areorganised by purposive, mind-like principles,9[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1259962] but thenreinvented them in the guise of genetic programs and selfish genes. The dominantparadigm of modern biology, although nominally mechanistic, is remarkablysimilar to vitalism, with ‘pro k, wat grams’ or ‘information’ or ‘instructions’or ‘messages’ playing the role formerly attributed to souls.Mechanists have always accused vitalists of trying to explain the mysteries oflife in terms of empty words, such as vital factors and souls, that ‘explaineverything and therefore nothing’. But the vital factors in their mechanisticguises have exactly this characteristic. How does a marigold grow from a seed?Because it is genetically programmed to do so. How does a spider instinctivelyspin its web? Because of the information coded in its genes. And so on.The unfulfilled promises of molecular biology It is hard to recall the atmosphere of exhilaration in the 1980s as newtechniques enabled genes to be cloned and the sequence of ‘letters’ in theirgenetic code to be discovered. This seemed like biology’s crowning moment: thegenetic instructions of life itself were finally laid bare, opening up thepossibility for biologists to modify plants and animals genetically, and growricher than they could ever have imagined. Almost every week newspaper headlinesreported a new breakthrough: ‘Scientists find genes to combat cancer’, ‘Genetherapy offers hope to victims of arthritis’, ‘Scientists find secret ofageing’, and so on.The new genetics seemed so promising that soon the entire spectrum of biologicalresearchers was busy applying its techniques to their specialities. Theirremarkable progress led to a vast, ambitious vision: to spell out the fullcomplement of genes in the human genome. As Walter Gilbert of Harvard Universityput it, ‘The search for this “Holy Grail” of who we are has now reached itsculminating phase. The ultimate goal is the acquisition of all the details ofour genome.’ The Human Genome Project was formally launched in 1990 with aprojected budget of $3 billion.The Human Genome Project was a deliberate attempt to bring ‘Big Science’ tobiology, which had previously been more like a cottage industry. Physicists wereused to huge budgets, partly as a result of the Cold War: there was enormousexpenditure on missiles and hydrogen bombs, Star Wars, multi-billion-dollarparticle accelerators, the space programme and the Hubble Space Telescope.Ambitious biologists suffered from physics envy. They dreamed of the days whenbiology would have high profile, high prestige and multi-billion-dollarprojects. The Human Genome Project was the answer.At the same time, a tide of market speculation in the 1990s led to a boom inbiotechnology, reaching a peak in 2000. In addition to the official Human GenomeProject, Celera Genomics carried out a private genome project, headed by CraigVenter. The company planned to patent hundreds of human genes and own thecommercial rights to them. Celera Genomics’ market value, like that of manyother biotechnology companies, rocketed to dizzy heights in the kigh thearlymonths of 2000.Ironically, the rivalry between the public and private genome projects led to abursting of the bubble before the sequencing of the genome had even beencompleted. In March 2000, the leaders of the public genome project publicisedthe fact that all their information would be freely available to everyone. Thisled to a statement by US President Clinton on 14 March 2000: ‘Our genome, thebook in which all human life is written, belongs to every member of the humanrace . . . We must ensure that the profits of the human genome research aremeasured not in dollars, but in the betterment of human life.’10[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1260577] The pressreported that the president planned to restrict genomic patents. The stockmarkets reacted dramatically. In Venter’s words, there was a ‘sickening slump’.Within two days, Celera’s valuation lost $6 billion, and the wider market inbiotechnology shares collapsed by $500 billion.11[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1261122]In response to this crisis, a day after his speech President Clinton issued acorrection, saying that his statement had not been intended to have any effecton the patentability of genes or the biotechnology industry. But the damage hadbeen done. The stock-market valuations never recovered. And although many humangenes were subsequently patented, very few proved profitable to the companiesthat owned them.12[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1261534]On 26 June 2000, President Clinton and the British prime minister, Tony Blair,with Craig Venter and Francis Collins, the head of the official project,announced the publication of the first draft of the human genome. At the pressconference in the White House, President Clinton said, ‘We are here today tocelebrate the completion of the first survey of the entire human genome. Withouta doubt this is the most important, most wondrous map ever produced by mankind.It will revolutionise the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of most, if notall, human diseases . . . Humankind is on the verge of gaining immense, newpower to heal.’ The British science minister, Lord Sainsbury, said, ‘We now havethe possibility of achieving all we ever hoped for from medicine.’13[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1261812] One of theeditors of Nature proclaimed that by the end of the twenty-first century,‘genomics will allow us to alter entire organisms out of recognition, to suitour needs and tastes . . . [and] will allow us to fashion the human form intoany conceivable shape. We will have extra limbs, if we want them, and maybe evenwings to fly.’14[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1262349]This astonishing achievement of sequencing the human genome has indeedtransformed our view of ourselves, but not as anticipated. The first surprisewas that there were so few genes. Rather than the predicted 100,000 or more, thefinal tally of about 23,000 was very puzzling, and all the more so when comparedwith the genomes of other animals much simpler than ourselves. There are about17,000 genes in a fruit fly, and about 26,000 in a sea urchin. Many species ofplants have far more genes than us – rice has about 38,000, for example.In 2001, the director of the chimpanzee genome project, Svante Paabo,anticipated that when the sequencing of the ape’s genome was completed, it wouldbe possible to identify ‘the profoundly interesting genetic prerequisites thatmake us different from other animals’. When the complete chimpanzee sequence waspublished four years later, his interpretation was more muted: ‘We cannot see inthis why we are so different from chimpanzees.’15[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1262627]The ‘missing heritability problem’ In the wake of the Human Genome Project, the mood changed dramatically. Theoptimism that life would be understood if molecular biologists knew the‘programs’ of an organism gave way to the realisation that there is a huge gapbetween gene sequences and actual human beings. In practice, the predictivevalue of human genomes turned out to be small, in some cases less than thatachieved with a measuring tape. Tall parents tend to have tall children, andshort parents short children. By measuring the height of parents, theirchildren’s heights can be predicted with 80 to 90 per cent accuracy. In otherwords, height is 80 to 90 per cent heritable. Recent ‘genome-wide associationstudies’ compared the genomes of 30,000 people and identified about fifty genesassociated with tallness or shortness. To everyone’s surprise, taken together,these genes accounted for only about five per cent of the inheritance of height.In other words, the ‘height’ genes did not account for 75 to 85 per cent of theheritability of height. Most of the heritability was missing. Many otherexamples of missing heritability are now known, including the heritability ofmany diseases, making ‘personal genomics’ of very questionable value. Since2008, in scientific literature this phenomenon has been called the ‘missingheritability problem’.In 2009, twenty-seven prominent geneticists, including Francis Collins, theformer head of the Human Genome Project, published a paper in Nature on themissing heritability of complex diseases in which they acknowledged that,despite more than seven hundred genome-scanning publications and an expense ofmore than $100 billion, geneticists had found only a very limited genetic basisfor human diseases.16[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1263040] In 2010, in aspecial series of articles in Nature to celebrate the tenth anniversary of thecompletion of the first draft of the human genome, a common theme was the‘mismatch’ between the sophistication of the data collection and understandingit. In an article called ‘A reality check for personalised medicine’, theauthors observed, ‘Never before has the gap between the quantity of informationand our ability to interpret it been so great.’17[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1263575]In 2011, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the actual publication of thehuman genome, the tone was even more modest: ‘Although genomics has alreadybegun to improve diagnostics and treatments in a few circumstances, profoundimprovements in the effectiveness of healthcare cannot realistically be expectedfor many years.’18[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1264109] Some criticsgo further. Jonathan Latham, director of the Bioscience Resource Project,commented, > The most likely explanation for why genes for common diseases have not been> found is that, with few exceptions, they do not exist . . . The likelihood> that further searching might rescue the day appears slim. A much better use of> the money would be to ask: if inherited genes are not to blame for our> commonest illnesses, can we find out what is?19> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1264530] Meanwhile, the optimism of stock-market investors has suffered recurring blows.After the biotech bubble burst in 2000, many biotech companies either went outof business or were taken over by pharmaceutical or chemical corporations. Anarticle in the Wall Street Journal in 2004 entitled ‘Biotech’s Dismal BottomLine: More than $40 billion in Losses’20[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1264942] went on tosay, ‘Biotechnology . . . may yet turn into an engine for economic growth andcure deadly diseases. But it’s hard to argue that it’s a good investment. Notonly has the biotech industry yielded negative financial returns for decades, itgenerally digs its hole deeper every year.’21[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1265558]In 2006 Harvard Business School published a detailed analysis of the industry.They found that ‘only a very tiny fraction’ of biotechnology companies had evermade a profit, and that promises of breakthroughs had failed over and overagain. Defenders of the industry argued that more time was needed, but theHarvard Business School analysis pointed to the opposite conclusion: ‘[G]iventhe extremely poor long-term performance of the biotechnology industry ingeneral, and specific firms in particular, capital has been, if anything, toopatient.’22 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1266103]Despite its disastrous business record, this vast investment in molecularbiology and biot klog\">Precisely because there has been such a strong emphasis on molecular biology,its limitations are becoming increasingly apparent. The sequencing of thegenomes of ever more species of animals and plants, together with thedetermination of the structures of thousands of proteins, is causing molecularbiologists to drown in their own data. There is practically no limit to how manymore genomes they can sequence or proteins they can analyse. Molecularbiologists now rely on computer specialists in the rapidly growing field ofbioinformatics to store and try to make sense of this unprecedented quantity ofinformation, sometimes called the ‘data avalanche’.23[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1266515] What does itall mean?The advances of molecular biology have led to other big surprises. In the 1980s,there was great excitement when a family of genes called homeobox genes wasdiscovered in fruit flies. Homeobox genes determine where limbs and other bodysegments will form in a developing embryo or larva; they seem to control thepattern in which different parts of the body develop. Mutations in these genescan lead to the growth of extra, non-functional body parts.24[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1266934] These arecalled homeotic mutations, as discussed below. At first sight, the homeoboxappeared to provide the basis for a molecular explanation of morphogenesis: herewere the key switches. At the molecular level, homeobox genes act as templatesfor proteins that ‘switch on’ cascades of other genes.This study of genes involved in the regulation of development is part of agrowing field called evolutionary developmental biology, or evo-devo for short.But here too, molecular biology is a victim of its own success: it has shownthat morphogenesis itself continues to elude a molecular explanation. Themolecular control systems turned out to be very similar in widely differentanimals. Homeobox genes are almost identical in flies, reptiles, mice andhumans. Although they play a role in the determination of the body plan, theycannot explain the organisms’ shapes. Since the genes are so similar in fruitflies and in us, they cannot explain the differences between flies and humans.It was shocking to find that the diversity of body plans across many differentanimal groups was not reflected in diversity at the level of the genes. As someleading molecular biologists commented, ‘Where we most expect to find variation,we find conservation, a lack of change.’25[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1267469]The genome wager By 2009, it was clear that many of the promises of the genome project had notbeen fulfilled. But many biologists still believed t kll t>hat the genome inprinciple explained the organism. For example, Lewis Wolpert, an eminent Britishbiologist, gave a ringing statement of faith in the role of the genes and theirexplanatory power when he proclaimed that, with more information and enormouscomputing power, ‘We would, given a fertilised human egg, be able to have apicture of all the details of the newborn baby, including any abnormalities. Wewould also be able to programme the egg to develop into any shape we desire. Thetime will come when this is possible.’26[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1267896]A few months later, Wolpert and I met to debate ‘The Nature of Life’ as thefinal event of the 2009 Cambridge University Science Festival.27[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1268885] Wolpertreaffirmed his faith in the predictive power of the genome, and I challenged himto a bet. I said I was prepared to bet that his prediction would not come truein ten years, or even twenty. After a few moments’ consideration, he said itmight take a hundred years. This was clearly an unverifiable prediction foranyone alive today. After our public debate, we continued our discussion, and Iasked him what he thought could be achieved in twenty years. At first he thoughtthat all the details of a mouse might be predictable on the basis of its genome.Then, after further consideration, he scaled down his prediction from mice tochickens, then frogs, then nematode worms. We finally agreed on a formal wager,published in New Scientist in July 2009.28[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1269221] At stake is acase of fine port, Quinta do Vesuvio 2005, for which we paid half each, andwhich is being stored in the cellars of the Wine Society, near London. Expertssay it should be perfectly mature in 2029. The wager is: > By 1 May 2029, given the genome of a fertilised egg of an animal or plant, we> will be able to predict in at least one case all the details of the organism> that develops from it, including any abnormalities. Wolpert bets that this will happen. I bet that it will not. If the outcome isnot obvious, the Royal Society will be asked to adjudicate.I think Wolpert’s faith in the predictive power of the genome is misplacedbecause genes enable organism kablspas to make proteins, but do not explain thedevelopment of embryos. The problems begin with the proteins themselves. Genescode for the linear sequences of amino acids in proteins, which then fold upinto complex three-dimensional forms. Wolpert presupposes that, given thesequence of amino acids specified by the genes, the folding of proteins can becomputed from first principles. This has proved impossible, despite more thanforty years of intensive, well-funded research (see Chapter 5). Even if theprotein-folding problem could be solved, the next stage would be to attempt topredict the structures of cells on the basis of the interactions of hundreds ofmillions of proteins and other molecules, unleashing a vast combinatorialexplosion, with more possible arrangements than all the atoms in the universe.Random molecular permutations simply cannot explain how organisms work. Instead,cells, tissues and organs develop in a modular manner, shaped by morphogeneticfields, first recognised by developmental biologists in the 1920s (see Chapter5). Wolpert himself acknowledges the importance of such fields. Amongbiologists, he is best known for his concept of ‘positional information’, bywhich cells ‘know’ where they are within the morphogenetic field of a developingorgan, such as a limb. But he believes that morphogenetic fields can be reducedto standard chemistry and physics. I disagree. I propose that these fields haveorganising abilities or systems properties that involve new scientificprinciples.The predictive powers of the genome have been reduced yet further by therecognition of epigenetic inheritance.Epigenetics and the inheritance of acquired characteristics One of the biggest controversies in twentieth-century biology concerned theinheritance of acquired characteristics, the ability of animals and plants toinherit adaptations acquired by their ancestors. For example, if a body-builderacquired enormous muscles, his children would tend to have larger muscles as aresult. The opposing view, promoted by August Weismann (Figure 6.1) and by thescience of genetics, denied that organisms could inherit features theirancestors had acquired; they only passed on ‘determinants’ or genes that theyhad themselves inherited.In Darwin’s day, most people assumed that acquired characteristics could indeedbe inherited. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck had taken this for granted in his theory ofevolution published more than fifty years before Darwin’s, and the inheritanceof acquired characters was often referred to as ‘Lamarckian inheritance’. Darwinshared this belief and cited many examples to support it.29[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1269799] In thisrespect Darwin was a Lamarckian, not so much because of Lamarck’s influence butbecause he and Lamarck both accepted the inheritance of ac kritspequiredcharacteristics as a matter of common sense.30[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1270342]Lamarck placed a strong emphasis on the role of behaviour in evolution: animals’development of new habits in response to needs led to the use or disuse oforgans, which were accordingly either strengthened or weakened. Over a period ofgenerations, this process led to structural changes that became increasinglyhereditary. Lamarck’s most famous example was the giraffe, whose long neck wasacquired through the habit of stretching up to eat the leaves of trees over manygenerations (see Chapter 1). In this respect too, Darwin agreed with Lamarck,and he provided various illustrations of the hereditary effects of the habits oflife. For example, ostriches, he suggested, may have lost the power of flightthrough disuse and gained stronger legs through increased use over successivegenerations.31 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1270885]Darwin was very conscious of the power of habit, which was for him almostanother name for nature. Francis Huxley summarised Darwin’s attitude: > A structure to him meant a habit, and a habit implied not only an internal> need but outer forces to which, for good or evil, the organism had to become> habituated . . . In one sense, therefore, he might well have called his book> The Origin of Habits rather than The Origin of Species.32> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1271301]The problem was that no one knew how acquired characteristics could beinherited. Darwin tried to explain it with his hypothesis of ‘pangenesis’. Heproposed that all the units of the body threw off tiny ‘gemmules’ of ‘formativematter’, which were dispersed throughout the body and aggregated in the buds ofplants and in the germ cells of animals, through which they were transmitted tothe offspring.33[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1271844]The neo-Darwinian theory of evolution, which became orthodox in the West in thetwentieth century, differed from the Darwinian theory in denying the inheritanceof acquired characteristics in favour of genes. Lamarckian inheritance wastreated as a heresy. By contrast, in the Soviet Union the inheritance ofacquired characteristics became the orthodox doctrine from the 1930s to the1960s. Under the leadership of Trofim Lysenko, much research seemed to supportthe inheritance of acquired characteristics. Lysenko’s power was backed byStalin, and Mendelian geneticists were persecuted, and some were killed,34[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1272256] which furtherincreased opposition to the inheritance of acquired characteristics in the West.The scientific question about the nature of inheritance became so intenselypoliticised that ideology, rather than scientific evidence, dominated thedispute.The taboo against the inheritance of acquired characteristics began to dissolvearound the turn of the millennium. There is a growing recognition that someacquired characteristics can indeed be inherited. This kind of inheritance isnow called ‘epigenetic inheritance’. In this context, the word ‘epigenetic’signifies ‘over and above genetics’. Some kinds of epigenetic inheritance dependon chemical attachments to genes, particularly of methyl groups. Genes can be‘switched off’ by the methylation of the DNA itself or of the proteins that bindto it.This is a fast-growing field of research, and there are many examples ofepigenetic inheritance in plants and animals. For example, the effects of toxinscan echo for generations. In one study, when pregnant rats were exposed to acommonly used agricultural fungicide, the development of their sons’ testes wasimpaired, and they had a low sperm count later in life. Their sons also hadlower sperm counts, and this effect was passed on from fathers to sons for fourgenerations.35 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1272670]The inheritance of acquired characteristics occurs in invertebrates, likeDaphnia, the water flea. When predators are around, the water fleas developlarge defensive spines. When they reproduce, their offspring also have thesespines even if they are not exposed to predators.36[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1273203]Epigenetic inheritance also occurs in humans. A study in Sweden of men bornbetween 1890 and 1920 showed that their nutrition in childhood affected theincidence of diabetes and heart disease in their grandchildren. Many commondiseases that are inherited within families can also be passed onepigenetically.37[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1273614] The HumanEpigenome Project, an international public-private consortium, was launched in2003 to help to co-ordinate research in this rapidly growing field of enquiry.38[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1274028]Although epigenetic inheritance breaks the taboo against the inheritance ofacquired characteristics, it does not challenge the materialist assumption thatheredity is material; it is another kind of material inheritance. It affectswhich genes are ‘switched on’ or ‘switched off’, and consequently affects whatprot kcts maeins a cell makes. But genes and proteins cannot in themselvesexplain morphogenesis or instinctive behaviour.Morphic resonance and morphogenetic fields The only way of making sense of inherited patterns of organisation is in termsof top-down causation by higher-level patterns, or ‘systems properties’, orfields.One way of grasping how top-down causation works through fields is to think ofthe field of a magnet. Influences flow ‘up’ and ‘down’, to and from the overallfield. The field of the magnet as a whole emerges from the lining up of thesmall magnetic domains within it. The field in turn works back on theseconstituent domains and keeps them lined up. If a magnet is heated above acritical temperature, it loses its magnetism; the order breaks down, and themicroscopic magnetic domains are oriented randomly. The overall field is lost.This is like an organism dying.Morphogenetic fields contain a nested hierarchy of morphogenetic units or holons(see Chapter 1, Figure 1.1). The morphogenetic field of a lemur co-ordinates thefields of its limbs, muscles and organs, the fields of organs those of tissues;those of the tissues co-ordinate the fields of the cells, and so on.There are two main ways of thinking about morphogenetic fields. The first is totreat them as essentially mathematical structures, in which case we arrive againat a Platonic theory of form, as René Thom made explicit. The inheritance ofform then becomes a matter of chemical genes and proteins interacting withtimeless mathematics. The genes and proteins do not provide the form; the mathsdoes.Alternatively, morphogenetic fields may have history within them. They inherittheir forms by morphic resonance from previous similar organisms. They can stillbe modelled mathematically, but these models do not explain the fields, theyjust model them. Inheritance depends on genes and on morphic resonance.The difference between the Platonic theory and the morphic-resonance hypothesiscan be illustrated by analogy with a television set. The pictures on the screendepend on the material components of the set and the energy that powers it, andalso on the invisible transmissions it receives through the electromagneticfield. A sceptic who rejected the idea of invisible influences might try toexplain everything about the pictures and sounds in terms of the components ofthe set – the wires, transistors, and so on – and the electrical interactionsbetween them. Through careful research he would find that damaging or removingsome of these components affected the pictures or sounds the set produced, anddid so in a repeatable, predictable way. This discovery would reinforce hismaterialist belief. He would be unable to explain exactly how the set producedthe pictures and sounds, but he would hope that a kd hforce h more detailedanalysis of the components and more complex mathematical models of theirinteractions would eventually provide the answer.Some mutations in the components – for example, by a defect in some of thetransistors – affect the pictures by changing their colours or distorting theirshapes; while mutations of components in the tuning circuit cause the set tojump from one channel to another, leading to a completely different set ofsounds and pictures. But this does not prove that the evening news report isproduced by interactions among the TV set’s components. Likewise, geneticmutations may affect an animal’s form and behaviour, but this does not provethat form and behaviour are programmed in the genes. They are inherited bymorphic resonance, an invisible influence on the organism coming from outsideit, just as TV sets are resonantly tuned to transmissions that originateelsewhere. [images/00013.jpg] > Figure 6.2A: A normal fruit fly. B: A mutant fly in which the third thoracic> segment has been transformed into a duplicate of the second thoracic segment,> bearing a pair of wings rather than halteres. Such flies are called bithorax> mutants. Some genetic mutations affect the tuning, with the result that a part of theembryo resonates with one morphogenetic field rather than another, resulting ina different structure, like a TV set tuned to a different channel. For example,fruit flies, like other flies, normally have two wings, and behind them a pairof balancing organs called halteres (Figure 6.2 A). Mutations in particulargenes (in the bithorax gene complex) can cause an extra pair of wings to developinstead of halteres (Figure 6.2 B). Mutations of this kind are called homeoticmutations. Another kind of homeotic mutation in fruit flies causes legs todevelop instead of antennae. In plants, homeotic mutations likewise cause somestructures to be replaced by others – for example, in pea plants, one kind ofhomeotic mutant produces leaves with no tendrils: all the tendrils are replacedby leaflets. In another mutant, all the leaflets are replaced by tendrils. Thisdoes not mean that the altered genes ‘program’ leaflets or tendrils, or legs orantennae. Instead it means that the mutant genes affect the tuning systemwhereby the embryonic structures that normally tune into antenna fields tuneinto leg fields instead, or tendril fields instead of leaflet fields.Other kinds of mutants affect the details of structures, just as some defects inthe components of a television set affect the details of the sounds or pi ksoan>Platonists hope that one day these fields will be explained mathematically. Theonly real alternative is that morphogenetic fields are inherited by morphicresonance from previous similar organisms, together with their chreodes andattractors. This inheritance is not material, but it is nevertheless physical inthe sense that it is natural, not supernatural. It involves a resonant transferor form, or in-form-ation, from the past to the present. This memory-resonancefrom the past takes place through or across time and space. It does not fall offwith distance, but works on the basis of similarity: the more similar, the moreresonant.The hypothesis of morphic resonance is testable experimentally. If fruit fliesdevelop abnormally under abnormal conditions, then the more the abnormalityoccurs, the more likely it will be to happen again under the same conditions,through cumulative morphic resonance. And if animals, like squirrels, learn anew trick in one place, the more squirrels that learn it, the easier it shouldbecome for squirrels of the same species all over the world. There is alreadyexperimental evidence that these effects occur, discussed in detail in my booksA New Science of Life and The Presence of the Past.Twins The relative importance of nature and nurture or genes and environment is notonly a scientific but also a political question. From the nineteenth centuryonwards it stirred up intense passions. The liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill(1806–73) preached a gospel of social progress, whereby political and economicreforms would change human nature through changing the environment, ideas thathad a strong influence on progressive political movements like liberalism,socialism and Communism.On the other hand, Francis Galton, Charles Darwin’s cousin, made a strongscientific case for the predominance of heredity, which is often taken tosupport a more conservative political philosophy. In his book Hereditary Genius(1869), he argued that the prominence of Britain’s most distinguished familiesdepended more on nature than on nurture. Galton was a pioneering advocate ofeugenics, a word he coined. He also realised that the question of nature andnurture could be studied with the help of identical twins. He arg ktwie.Galtoued that identical twins had a similar heredity constitution, whilenon-identical twins were no more similar than ordinary brothers and sisters.And, sure enough, he found remarkable similarities between identical twins in awide range of characteristics including the onset of disease and even time ofdeath.39 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1274437]"},{"pageContent":"Some political philosophers used Galton’s ideas on heredity to justify theBritish class system, and Galton himself proposed that the state should regulatethe fertility of the population in such a way as to favour the improvement ofhuman nature through selective breeding. The eugenics movement had a largefollowing in the United States and reached its apogee in Nazi Germany. Notsurprisingly, Nazi scientists were very interested in twins. The notorious JosefMengele’s favourite project at the Auschwitz death camp was a study of identicaltwins, who were kept in special barracks. Mengele told one of his colleagues,‘It would be a sin, a crime . . . not to utilise the possibilities thatAuschwitz had for twin research. There would never be another chance like it.’40[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1274849]Meanwhile, psychologists of the behaviourist school took the opposite approach.They believed in promoting human progress through environmental conditioning. AsJohn B. Watson, the founder of behaviourism, expressed it, > Suppose we were to take individual twins into the laboratory and begin rigidly> to condition them from birth to the twentieth year along utterly different> lines. We might even condition one of the children to grow up without> language. Those of us who have spent years in the conditioning of children and> animals cannot help but realise that the two end products would be as> different as day is from night.41> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1275403] After the Second World War, the leading figure in identical-twin research wasthe educational psychologist Sir Cyril Burt, who claimed to have studiedfifty-three pairs who had been reared apart. Burt focused on the inheritance ofintelligence, as measured by IQ tests, and claimed that genetics had a farstronger influence than environment. Unfortunately for genetic determinists,Burt was shown to have faked some of his data.42[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1275814] But with thecracking of the genetic code and the growth of molecular biology in the 1960s,genetic determinism became increasingly influential, and was reinforced by newstudies of twins, most notably in the Minnesota Twin Study, established in 1989.The team at the University of Minnesota studied 1 kOld=\"Minion Pfont>,400 pairsof identical twins and fraternal twins, including twins separated soon afterbirth. They found that separated identical twins showed remarkable similaritiesin a variety of characteristics, such as sense of wellbeing, social dominance,alienation, aggression and achievement. They also found a high correlation ofIQ, almost identical to the figure that Burt was accused of inventing.43[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1276362] And there weresome exceptionally striking similarities. For example, the ‘Jim’ twins (bothcalled James by their adoptive families), who were separated soon after birth,showed remarkable similarities in their life histories. Both lived in the onlyhouse on the block, with a white bench around a back tree in the backyard; bothwere interested in stock-car racing; both had elaborate workshops where theymade miniature picnic tables or miniature rocking chairs.44[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1276784] They also hadsimilar health histories.45[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1277196]Morphic resonance casts a new light on the studies of monozygotic twins. Becausethey are genetically identical and share the same womb throughout theirembryonic development, they are much more similar to each other than any otherpairs of humans. The greater the similarity, the stronger the morphic resonance.Hence the morphic resonance between identical twins will be stronger thanbetween any other people. As a result, their patterns of activity, habits orhealth issues are likely to influence them by morphic resonance, even if theywere separated soon after birth. Many of the remarkable similarities betweenidentical twins may depend on morphic resonance rather than genes.Memes and morphic fields In the standard materialist view, all inheritance is material except culturalinheritance, which everyone agrees works in a different way, primarily throughanimals and humans learning by imitation. In 1976, Richard Dawkins proposed theterm ‘meme’ for a unit of cultural inheritance, by analogy with gene:> Examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of> making pots or of building arches. Just as genes propagate themselves in the> gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperms or eggs, so memes propagate> themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a process> which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation.46> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1277686] This idea has itself proved to be a successful meme, showing that there is aneed for such a concept.47[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1278232] Thematerialist philo kriaze=\"-2\" fsopher Daniel Dennett has used the meme conceptas the ‘cornerstone’ of his theory of mind.48[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1278653] But the termmeme is too atomistic and reductionistic, and various authors have proposed newterms to refer to complexes of memes linked together in larger structures, like‘co-adapted meme complex’ or ‘memeplex’.49[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1279087]Atheists are particularly keen on the idea of religions as meme complexes, andthink of them as like viruses infecting other people’s brains.50[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1279365] They regardthemselves as immune. But materialism must itself be a virus-like meme complexthat infects materialists’ brains. When the materialist memeplex is particularlyvirulent, it turns its victims into proselytising atheists so that it can jumpfrom their brains to as many other people’s brains as possible.Despite all the speculation about memes and their role in culture and religion,their nature has remained obscure. Materialists like to think of them asmaterial structures inside material brains, but no one has ever found a memeinside a brain, or seen one leaping from one brain to another. They areinvisible. They are in fact patterns of organisation or information, and Ipropose that it is more helpful to think of them as morphic fields, transferredfrom brain to brain by morphic resonance.51[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1279927] From thematerialist point of view there is a fundamental difference of kind betweengenetic inheritance and cultural inheritance, because the former is material andthe latter is not. Thinking of memes as if they are material objects is anattempt to overcome this problem, but it is a rhetorical manoeuvre, not ascientifically testable hypothesis.I once attempted to discuss this point with Richard Dawkins. I said to him thatmemes and morphic fields seemed to play a similar role in cultural inheritance.He replied, ‘They have nothing in common whatsoever. Memes are real because theyare material. They exist inside material brains. Morphic fields are not materialand therefore they don’t exist.’52[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1280343] That was theend of the discussion. But like morphic fields, memes could only work throughpatterns of brain activity. Memes cannot possibly be material objects, likelittle computer chips or miniature CDs.From the point of view of morphic resonance, there is only a difference ofdegree, not of kind, between the hereditary transmission of form and behaviourand the cultural transmission of patterns of behaviour. Both depend on morphicresonance. Morphic fields are not atomistic and particulate, but organised innested hierarchies or holarchies, which fit much more naturally with thestructure of culturally inherited patterns. Language, for example, is made up ofa nested hierarchy of levels: phonemes, in words, in syllables, in phrases, insentences (Figure 1ied, ‘Tan>.1). I return to a discussion of the role ofmorphic fields in minds and memories in Chapter 7.What difference does it make? The belief that genes are the basis of almost all inheritance is not just anintellectual theory but has had enormous economic and political consequences. Ithas resulted in the investment of hundreds of billions of dollars in genome andbiotechnology projects. If genes are the keys to life, then people want to ownthem and exploit them. But if genes are grossly overrated, genomics will neverlive up to the high hopes it once engendered. A few companies make usefulproducts, but many make promises that never come true.The gene-centred view of life has dominated science since the 1960s with balefuleffects on our general culture. Jeffrey Skilling, the CEO of Enron, acorporation noted for its greed and predatory behaviour, said that his favouritebook was The Selfish Gene,53[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1280978] and theselfish-gene theory was a major part of Enron’s corporate culture until thecompany collapsed in 2001. Skilling, who is serving a long jail sentence,interpreted neo-Darwinism to mean that selfishness was ultimately good even forits victims, because it weeded out losers and forced survivors to becomestrong.54 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1281391]Genes are not individualistic and selfish, despite the rhetoric suggesting theyare. As parts of larger wholes, they work co-operatively in the development andfunctioning of organisms. If they have any moral message for humans, it is thatlife depends on working together and not on ruthless competition.A broader understanding of heredity that includes genes, gene modifications andmorphic resonance opens up many new questions, and helps free the life sciencesfrom the tunnel vision of molecular biology. It makes a big differencescientifically. For a start, the word ‘hereditary’ is no longer synonymous with‘genetic’. Genes are part of heredity, not all of it. Morphic resonance mayunderlie the inheritance of form, and behaviour. This resonance is physical, butnot material. Similarly, morphic resonance may play a major role in culturalinheritance.Through morphic resonance, animals and plants are connected with theirpredecessors. Each individual both draws upon and contributes to the collectivememory of the species. Animals and plants inherit the habits of their speciesand of their breed. The same applies to humans.An extended understanding of heredity changes t kity breehe way we think ofourselves, the influence of our predecessors, and our effects on generations yetunborn.Questions for materialists Do you agree with Lewis Wolpert that ‘By 1 May 2029, given the genome of afertilised egg of an animal or plant, we will be able to predict in at least onecase all the details of the organism that develops from it, including anyabnormalities’? If so, how much would you be prepared to bet on it? If you believe genes ‘program’ organisms, how do you think the programs work?Do you think that mathematical models will eventually explain the inheritance ofform and behaviour? If so, are organisms ‘reifications’ of mathematics? How do you think the missing heritability problem might be solved?Summary Genes are overrated in the sense that they do not ‘code for’ or ‘program’ theform and behaviour of organisms. They specify the sequence of amino acids inprotein molecules and some are involved in the control of protein synthesis. TheHuman Genome Project and other genome projects have been disappointing, bothscientifically and financially, because they were based on a false conception ofwhat genes do. The inheritance of development and behaviour may depend onorganising fields that have an inherent memory. In addition, characteristicsacquired by plants and animals can be passed on to their descendantsepigenetically, through modifications of gene expression rather than mutation.Habits of growth and behaviour can be inherited through a collective memory ofthe species, on which each individual draws, and to which it contributes:organisms inherit habits of form and behaviour that are not coded in the genesby the process of morphic resonance. Morphic resonance may also underliecultural inheritance, which differs in degree, but not in kind, from theinheritance of forms and instincts.7 Are Memories Stored as Material Traces? We take memory for granted, like the air we breathe. Everything we do, see andthink is shaped by habits and memories. My ability to write this book, and yoursto read it, presupposes the memory of words and their meanings. My ability toride a bicycle depends on unconscious habit memory. I can recall facts I havelearned, like the year of the Battle of Hastings – 1066; I can recognise peopleI first met years ago; I can remember specific incidents that happened when Iwas on holiday in Canada last summer. These are nnt>ieise peopledifferent kindsof memory, but all involve influences from the past that affect me in thepresent. Our memories underlie all our experience. And obviously animals havememories too.How does memory work? Most people take it for granted that memories must somehowbe stored in brains as material traces. In ancient Greece these traces wereusually compared to impressions in wax. In the early twentieth century they werecompared to connections between wires in a telephone exchange, and now they arethought of by analogy with memory storage systems in computers. Although themetaphors change, the trace theory is taken for granted by most scientists, andalmost everyone else.From a materialist point of view, memories must be stored as material traces inbrains. Where else could they be? The neuroscientist Steven Rose expressed thestandard assumptions as follows: > Memories are in some way ‘in’ the mind, and therefore, for a biologist, also> ‘in’ the brain. But how? The term memory must include at least two separate> processes. It must involve, on the one hand, that of learning something new> about the world around us; and on the other, at some later date, recalling, or> remembering that thing. We infer that what lies between the learning and the> remembering must be some permanent record, a memory trace, within the brain.1> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1282475] This seems obvious and straightforward. It might seem pointless to question it.Yet the trace theory of memory is very questionable indeed. It raises appallinglogical problems. Attempts to locate memory traces have been unsuccessfuldespite more than a century of research, costing many billions of dollars. Forpromissory materialists, this failure does not imply that the trace theory ofmemory might be wrong; it merely means that we need to spend more time and moneysearching for the elusive memory traces.But memory traces are not the only option. Several philosophers in the ancientworld, notably Plotinus, were sceptical that memories were materialimpressions,2 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1283022]and argued that they were immaterial rather than material, aspects of the soulrather than the body.3[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1283713] Likewise, morerecent philosophers, like Henri Bergson and Alfred North Whitehead, saw memoriesas direct connections across time, not material structures in brains (seeChapter 4).My own suggestion is that memories depend on morphic resonance. All individualsare influenced by mor suenfy\">ms are more similar to themselves in the past thanto other members of their species, self-resonance is highly specific. Individualmemory and collective memory both depend on morphic resonance; they differ fromeach other in degree, not in kind.I start with the trace theory of memory, then discuss the resonance hypothesis,and finally ways in which this hypothesis can be tested.Logical and chemical problems Several modern philosophers have pointed out that the trace theory of memoryruns into an insoluble logical problem, quite apart from repeated failures tofind memory traces.In order for a memory trace to be consulted or reactivated, there has to be aretrieval system, and this system needs to identify the stored memory it islooking for. To do so it must recognise it, which means the retrieval systemmust itself have a memory. There is therefore a vicious regress: if theretrieval system is endowed with a memory store, this in turn requires aretrieval system with memory, and so on ad infinitum.4[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1284524]There is a structural problem too. Memories can persist for decades, yet thenervous system is dynamic, continually changing, and so are the molecules withinit. As Francis Crick put it, ‘Almost all the molecules in our bodies, with theexception of DNA, the genetic material, turn over in a matter of days, weeks, orat the most a few months. How then is memory stored in the brain so that itstrace is relatively immune to molecular turnover?’ He suggested a complexmechanism whereby molecules were replaced one at a time so as to preserve theoverall state of the memory-storage structures.5[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1284941] No suchmechanism has been detected.For decades, the most popular theory has been that memory must depend on changesin connections between nerve cells, the synapses. Yet attempts to locate memorystores have proved unsuccessful over and over again.The fruitless search for memory traces In the 1890s, Ivan Pavlov studied the way that animals such as dogs could learnto associate a stimulus, such as hearing a bell, with being fed. After repeatedtraining, merely hearing the bell could cause the dogs to salivate. Pavlovcalled this a conditioned reflex. For many scientists at the time, this researchsuggested that the animals’ memory depended on reflex arcs, in which the nervefibres were like wires and the brain like a telephone exchange. But Pavlovhimself was reluctant to claim there were specific localised traces. Hediscovered that conditioning could survive massive surgical damage to thebrain.6 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1285357] Thosewho knew less about it were less cautious, and in the first few decades of thetwentieth century many biologists assumed that all psychological activity,including the phenomena of the human mind, could ultimately be reduced to chainsof reflexes wired together in the brain.In a heroic series of experiments lasting more than thirty years, Karl Lashley(1890–1958) tried to locate specific memory traces, or ‘engrams’, in the brainsof rats, monkeys and chimpanzees. He trained the animals in a variety of tasksranging from simple conditioned reflexes to the solution of difficult problems.After the training, he surgically cut nerve tracts or removed portions of thebrain and measured the effects on the animals’ memory. To his astonishment, hefound that the animals could still remember what they had learned even afterlarge amounts of brain tissue had been removed.Lashley first became sceptical of the supposed path of conditioned reflex arcsthrough the motor cortex when he found that rats trained to respond in specificways to light could perform almost as well as control rats after almost alltheir motor cortex was cut out. In similar experiments with monkeys, he removedmost of the motor cortex after they had been trained to open boxes with latches.This operation resulted in a temporary paralysis. After two or three months,when they recovered their ability to move in a co-ordinated way, they wereexposed to the puzzle boxes again. They opened them promptly without randomexploratory movements.Lashley then showed that learned habits were retained after the associativeareas of the brain were destroyed. Habits also survived a series of deepincisions into the cerebral cortex that destroyed cross-connections within it.Moreover, if the cerebral cortex was intact, removal of subcortical structuressuch as the cerebellum did not destroy the memory either.Lashley started as an enthusiastic supporter of the reflex theory of learning,but was forced to abandon it:> The original programme of research looked towards the tracing of> conditioned-reflex arcs throughout the cortex . . . The experimental findings> have never fitted into such a scheme. Rather, they have emphasised the unitary> character of every habit, the impossibility of stating any learning as> concatenations of reflexes, and the participation of large masses of nervous> tissue in the functions rather than the development of restricted conduction> paths.7 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1285774] Lashley suggested that > the characteristics of the nervous network are such that when it is subject to> any pattern of excitation, it may develop a pattern of activity, reduplicated> through an entire functional area by spread of excitations, such as the> surface of se snt sia liquid develops an interference pattern of spreading> waves when it is disturbed at several points. He suggested that recall involved ‘some sort of resonance among a very largenumber of neurons’.8[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1286324] These ideaswere carried further by his former student Karl Pribram in his proposal thatmemories are stored in a distributed manner throughout the brain analogous tothe interference patterns in a hologram.9[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1286875]Even in invertebrates specific memory traces have proved elusive. In a series ofexperiments with trained octopuses, learned habits survived when various partsof the brain were removed, leading to the seemingly paradoxical conclusion that‘memory is both everywhere and nowhere in particular’.10[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1287431]Despite these results, new generations of researchers have tried again and againto find localised memories. In the 1980s, Steven Rose and his colleagues thoughtthey had at last succeeded in finding traces in the brains of day-old chicks.They trained the chicks to avoid pecking at little coloured lights by makingthem sick, and the chicks duly avoided these stimuli when they encountered themagain. Rose and his colleagues then studied the changes in the brains of thesechicks, and found that nerve cells in a particular region of the left forebrainunderwent more active growth and development when learning took place than whenit did not.11 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1287976]These findings agreed with results from studies of the growing brains of youngrats, kittens and monkeys, which found that active nerve cells in the braindeveloped more than inactive nerve cells. But the greater development of activecells did not prove that they contained specific memory traces. When the regionof active cells was surgically removed from the chicks’ left forebrains a dayafter training, the chicks could still remember what they had learned. Thereforethe region of the brain involved in the learning process was not necessary forthe retention of memory. Once again, the hypothetical memory traces provedelusive, and once more those who searched for them were forced to postulateunidentified ‘storage systems’ somewhere else in the brain.12[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1289112]In a more recent series of studies, mice were studied as they learned tonegotiate a maze. The formation of memories involved activity in the mediantemporal lobes of the brain, particularly in the hippocampus. The ability toform long-term memories depended on a process called long-term potentiation,which involved protein synthesis in hippocampal nerve cells. But yet again, thememories proved elusive. Once the memories had been established, the destructionof the hippocampus on both sides of the brain failed to wipe them out. Thus, theresearchers concluded, the soncn e hypothetical memory traces must somehow havemoved from one part of the brain to another.Erik Kandel, who won the Nobel Prize in 2000 for his work on memory in the seaslug, Aplysia, drew attention to some of these problems in his acceptancespeech: > How do different regions of the hippocampus and the median temporal lobe . . .> interact in the storage of explicit memory? We do not, for example, understand> why the initial storage of memory requires the hippocampus, whereas the> hippocampus is not required once a memory has been stored for weeks or months.> What critical information does the hippocampus convey to the neo-cortex? We> also know very little about the recall of explicit (declarative) memory . . .> These systems properties of the brain will require more than the bottom-up> approach of molecular biology.13> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1289652] Currently, in the Connectome Project researchers at the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology and elsewhere are trying to map some of the trillions ofconnections between nerve cells in mammalian brains, using thin slices of braintissue and sophisticated computer analyses of the images. There are about 100billion neurons in the human brain. As Sebastian Seung, the leader of the MITteam, pointed out, ‘In the cerebral cortex, it’s believed that one neuron isconnected to 10,000 others.’ This is a vastly ambitious project, but it seemsunlikely to shed light on memory storage. First of all, a person has to be deadbefore his brain can be cut up, so changes before and after learning cannot bestudied in this way. Second, there are great differences between the brains ofdifferent people; we do not have identical ‘wiring’.The same is true of small animals like mice. A pilot project in the Max PlanckInstitute in Germany looked at the wiring diagrams for just fifteen neurons thatcontrol two small muscles in mouse ears. Even though this work was a technicaltour de force, it revealed no unique wiring diagram. Even for the right and leftears of the same animal the patterns of connection were different.14[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1290064]The most striking deviations from normal brain structure occur in people whosuffered from hydrocephalus when they were babies. In this condition, alsocalled ‘water on the brain’, much of the skull is filled with cerebrospinalfluid. The British neurologist John Lorber found that some people with extremehydrocephalus were surprisingly norma sisied l, which led him to ask theprovocative question: ‘Is the brain really necessary?’ He scanned the brains ofmore than six hundred people with hydrocephalus, and found that about sixty hadmore than 95 per cent of the cranial cavity filled with cerebrospinal fluid.Some were seriously retarded, but others were more or less normal, and some hadIQs of well over 100. One young man who had an IQ of 126 and a first-classdegree in mathematics, a student from Sheffield University, had ‘virtually nobrain’. His skull was lined with a thin layer of brain cells about a millimetrethick, and the rest of the space was filled with fluid.15[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1290594] Any attempt toexplain his brain in terms of a standard ‘connectome’ would be doomed tofailure. His mental activity and his memory were still able to function more orless normally even though he had a brain only five per cent of the normal size.The available evidence shows that memories cannot be explained in terms oflocalised changes in synapses. Brain activity involves rhythmic patterns ofelectrical activity extended over thousands or millions of nerve cells, ratherthan simple reflex arcs like wires in a telephone exchange or wiring diagrams ofcomputers. These patterns of nervous activity set up – and respond to – changesin the electromagnetic fields in the brain.16[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1291005] Theoscillating fields of entire brains are routinely measured in hospitals withelectroencephalographs (EEG), and within these overall rhythms there are manysubsidiary patterns of electrical activity in different regions of the brain. Ifthese patterns, or systems properties, are to be remembered, resonance acrosstime seems more likely than chemical storage in nerve endings.More than a century of intensive, well-funded research has failed to pin downmemory traces in brains. There may be a very simple reason for this: thehypothetical traces do not exist. However long or hard researchers look for themthey may never find them. Instead, memories may depend on morphic resonance froman organism’s own past. The brain may be more like a television set than ahard-drive recorder. What you see on TV depends on the resonant tuning of theset to invisible fields. No one can find out today what programmes you watchedyesterday by analysing the wires and transistors in your TV set for traces ofyesterday’s programmes.For the same reason, the fact that injury and brain degeneration, as inAlzheimer’s disease, lead to loss of memory does not prove that memories arestored in the damaged tissue. If I snipped a wire or removed some componentsfrom the sound circuits of your TV set, I could render it speechless, oraphasic. But this would not mean that all the sounds were stored in the damagedcomponents.Can a moth remember what it learned as a caterpillar? Insects that undergo complete metamorphosis experience enormous changes in sscace=\"Minanatomy and lifestyle. It is hard to believe that a caterpillar chewinga leaf is the same organism as the moth that later emerges from the pupa. In thepupa, almost all the caterpillar tissues are dissolved before the new structuresof the adult develop. Most of the nervous system is dissolved as well.In a recent study, Martha Weiss and her colleagues at Georgetown University,Washington, found that moths could remember what they had learned ascaterpillars in spite of all the changes they went through during metamorphosis.They trained caterpillars of the Carolina Sphinx moth, Manduca sexta, to avoidthe odour of ethyl acetate by associating exposure to this odour with a mildelectric shock. After two larval moults and metamorphosis within the pupae, theadult moths were averse to ethyl acetate, despite that radical transformation oftheir nervous system. Weiss and her colleagues carried out careful controls thatshowed this was a real transfer of learning, not just a carryover of odoursabsorbed by the tested caterpillars.17[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1291434]This ability of adult moths to remember their experience as caterpillars maywell be of evolutionary significance. If the plants that moths have experiencedas caterpillars influence the behaviour of adults, the female moths will tend toavoid laying eggs on harmful plants and favour nutritious ones, even if membersof the species have never encountered these plants before. New patterns ofpreference for particular host plants could be established in a singlegeneration, and would persist in their offspring; a species could evolve newfeeding habits very rapidly.The carryover of learning from caterpillar to moth after the dissolution of mostof the nervous system would be very puzzling indeed if all memories were storedas material traces, but there is already evidence from higher animals and humansthat memories may not be stored in traces and can survive substantial damage tobrains.Brain damage and loss of memory Brain damage can result in two kinds of memory loss: retrograde (backwards)amnesia, forgetting what happened before the damage, and anterograde (forwards)amnesia, losing the ability to remember what happens after the damage.The best-known examples of retrograde amnesia occur after concussion. As aresult of a sudden blow on the head a person loses consciousness and becomesparalysed for a few seconds or for many days, depending on the severity of theimpact. As she recovers and regains the ability to speak, she may seem normal inmost respects, but is unable to recall what happened before the accident.Typically, as recovery proceeds, the first of the forgotten events to berecalled are those longest ago; the memory of more recent events returnsprogressively.In such cases, amnesia cannot be due to the destruction of memory traces, forthe lost memories return. Karl Lashley reached a similar conclusion years ago: > I believe that the evidence strongly favours the view that amnesia from brain> injury rarely, i suryth=\"0f ever, is due to the destruction of specific memory> traces. Rather, the amnesias represent a lowered level of vigilance, a greater> difficulty in activating the organised pattern of traces, or a disturbance of> some broader system of organised functions.18> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1291972] Although many memories return, the events immediately preceding a blow on thehead may never be recovered: there may be a permanent blank period. For example,a motorist may remember approaching the crossroads where an accident occurred,but nothing more. A similar ‘momentary retrograde amnesia’ also occurs as aresult of electroconvulsive therapy, administered to some psychiatric patientsby passing a burst of electric current through their heads. They usually cannotremember what happened immediately before the administration of the shock.19[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1292518]Events and information in short-term memory are forgotten because a loss ofconsciousness prevents them being connected up into patterns of relationshipthat can be remembered. The failure to make such connections, and hence to turnshort-term memories into long-term memories, often persists for some time aftera concussed patient has regained consciousness, and is sometimes described as‘memorising defect’. People in this condition rapidly forget events almost assoon as they occur.Everyone agrees that the formation of memories is an active process. Either theinability to construct them prevents new memory traces being formed; or thisinability prevents the formation of new morphic fields, resonant patterns ofactivity, and if these patterns are not formed in the first place, they cannotbe recalled by morphic resonance.Some kinds of brain damage have very specific effects on people’s abilities torecognise and recall,20[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1292930] and otherscause specific disorders, such as aphasias (disorders of language use) resultingfrom lesions in various parts of the cortex in the left hemisphere. These kindsof damage disturb the organised patterns of activity in the brain,21[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1293537] and affect thebrain’s ability to tune in to skills and memories by morphic resonance.Holograms and the implicate order In a famous series of investigations carried out during brain surgery onconscious patients, Wilder Penfield and his colleagues tested the effects ofmild electrical stimulation of various regions of the cerebral cortex. As theelectrode touched parts of the motor cortex, limbs moved. Electricallystimulating the auditory or visual cortex evoked auditory or visualhallucinations like buzzing noises or flashes of light. Stimulation of thesecondary visual cortex gave hallucinations of flowers, for example, or animals,or familiar people. When some regions of the temporal cortex were stimulated,some patients recalled dream-like memories, for example of a concert or atelephone conversation.22[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1294220]Penfield initially assumed that the electrical evocation of memories meant thatthey were stored in the stimulated tissue, which he named the ‘memory cortex’.On further consideration, he changed his mind: ‘This was a mistake . . . Therecord is not in the cortex.’23[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1294646] Like Lashleyand Pribram, he gave up the idea of localised memory traces in favour of thetheory that they were widely distributed in other parts of the brain.The most popular analogy for distributed memory storage is holography, a form oflens-less photography in which interference patterns are stored as holograms,from which the original image can be reconstructed in three dimensions. If partof the hologram is destroyed, the whole image can still be reconstructed fromthe remaining parts, although in lower definition. The whole is present in eachpart. This may sound mysterious, but the basic principle is simple and familiar.As you look around you now, your eyes are sampling light from all the parts ofthe scene in front of you. The light absorbed by your eyes is only a small partof the available light, and yet you can see the whole scene. If you move a fewfeet, you can still see everything, the whole scene is present there too,although you are now sampling the light-waves in a different place. In a similarway, the whole is enfolded into each part of a hologram. This is not true of anordinary photograph: if you tear off half the photo, you have lost half theimage. If you tear off half a hologram, the whole image can still be re-created.But what if the holographic wave-patterns are not stored in the brain at all?Pribram later came to this conclusion, and thought of the brain as a ‘wave-formanalyser’ rather than a storage system, comparing it to a radio receiver thatpicked up wave-forms from the ‘implicate order’, rendering them explicate.24[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1295199] This aspect ofhis thinking was influenced by the quantum physicist David Bohm, who suggestedthat the entire universe is holographic, in the sense that wholeness is enfoldedinto every part.25[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1295612]According to Bohm, the observable or manifest world is the explicate or unfoldedorder, which emerges from the implicate or enfolded order.26[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1296022] Bohm thoughtthat the implicate order contains a kind of memory. What happens in one place is‘introjected’ or ‘injected’ into the implicate order, which is potentiallypresent everywhere; thereafter when the implicate order unfolds into theexplicate order, this memory affects what happens, giving the process verysimilar properties to morphic resonance. In Bohm’s words, each moment will‘contain a projection of the re-injection of the previous moments, which is akind of memory; so that would result in a general replication of past forms’.27[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1296573]Maybe morphic resonance will one day be included in an enlarged version ofquantum theory, as Bohm suggested. No one yet knows. The question ‘How canmorphic resonance be explained?’ is open. In the context of a debate about thereality of memory traces, does morphic resonance – or memory in the implicateorder – fit the facts better than the trace theory?Resonance across time The trace theory says that memories are stored materially in brains, for exampleas chemicals in synapses. The alternative is the resonance theory: memories aretransferred by resonance from similar patterns of activity in the past. We tunein to ourselves in the past; we do not carry our memories around inside ourheads.The resonance of memory is part of a much wider hypothesis. The hypothesis ofmorphic resonance proposes a resonance across space and time of patterns ofvibratory activity in all self-organising systems.28[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1297129] Morphicresonance underlies habits of crystallisation and protein folding (see Chapter3). It also underlies the inheritance of morphogenetic fields and of patterns ofinstinctive behaviour (see Chapter 6). It plays an essential role in thetransfer of learning, as discussed below. Morphic resonance provides a new wayof looking at memories. There are at least five kinds of memory: habituation,sensitisation, behavioural memory, recognition and recalling.Habituation and sensitisation Habituation means getting used to things. If you hear a new sound, or smell anew smell you may pay attention to it to start with, but if it makes nodifference, you soon cease to notice it. You don’t notice the pressure of yourclothes on your body most of the time, or the pressure of your bottom on theseat on which you are sitting, or the sounds of a clock ticking, or the manyother background noises around you.Habituation is one of the most fundamental kinds of memory and underlies all ourresponses to our environment. Generally speaking, we do not notice what staysthe same; we notice changes or differences. All our senses work on thisprinciple. If you are gazing over a landscape, anything that moves immediatelycatches your eye. If there is a change in the background noise, you notice it.Our entire culture works on the same principle, which is why gossip andnewspapers rarely concern themselves with things that stay the same. They areabout changes or differences.Other animals likewise become accustomed to their environments. They generallyreact to something new because they are not used to it, often showing alarm oravoidance. This kind of response even occurs in single-celled animals likeStentor, which lives in marshy pools. Each Stentor is a trumpet- sis Eacshapedcell covered with rows of fine, beating hairs called cilia. The activity of thecilia sets up currents around the cell, carrying suspended particles to themouth, which is at the bottom of a tiny vortex (Figure 7.1). These cells areattached at their base by a ‘foot’, and the lower part of the cell is surroundedby a mucus-like tube. If the surface to which it is attached is slightly jolted,Stentor rapidly contracts into its tube. If nothing happens, after about half aminute it extends again and the cilia resume their activity. If the samestimulus is repeated, it does not contract but continues its normal activities.This is not a result of fatigue because the cell responds to a new stimulus,such as being touched, by contracting again.29[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1298161] [images/00014.jpg] > Figure 7.1A: The single-celled organism Stentor raesilii, showing the currents> of water around it caused by the beating of its cilia. In response to an> unfamiliar stimulus it rapidly contracts into its tube (B). (After Jennings,> 1906) The cell membranes of Stentor have an electrical charge across them, just likenerve cells. When they are stimulated, an action potential sweeps over thesurface of the cell, very similar to a nerve impulse, and this leads to the cellcontracting.30 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1298575]As it becomes habituated, the receptors on the cell’s membrane become lesssensitive to mechanical stimulation, and the action potential is nottriggered.31 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1298985]Since Stentor is a single cell, its memory cannot be explained in terms ofchanges in nerve endings, or synapses, because it has none.Habituation implies a kind of memory that enables harmless and irrelevantstimuli to be recognised when they recur. Morphic resonance suggests astraightforward explanation. The organism is in resonance with its own pastpatterns of activity, including its return to normal following its withdrawalresponse to a harmless stimulus. When the stimulus is repeated, t ss rTheorganihe organism resonates with its previous pattern of response, including thereturn to normal activity. It returns to normal activity sooner, and respondsless and less, until the harmless stimuli are ignored. It habituates throughself-resonance. A new stimulus stands out precisely because it is new andunfamiliar.Habituation occurs in all animals, large and small, with and without nervoussystems. The effects of habituation have been studied in detail in the giantmarine slug Aplysia, which grows more than a foot long. Its nervous system isrelatively simple, and is similar in different individuals. Normally the slug’sgill is extended, but if the slug is touched, the gill is withdrawn. This reflexsoon ceases if harmless stimuli are repeated; the slugs habituate, just likeStentor. Eric Kandel and his group showed that only four motor nerve cells areresponsible for the gill withdrawal response. As habituation occurs, the sensorynerve cells cease to excite the motor cells because they release fewer and fewerpackets of chemical transmitter at the synapses with the motor cells. But thefact that the synapses function differently as a result of habituation does notprove that the memory is stored chemically in the synapses. The entire systemmay habituate as a result of self-resonance, as in Stentor. Self-resonance mayunderlie habituation in animals at all levels of complexity, includingourselves.Sensitisation is the opposite of habituation: animals become more responsive tostimuli that have a harmful effect. Again, even single-celled animals likeStentor exhibit this kind of behaviour. If a stream of noxious particles isdirected at Stentor, it contracts into its tube. The next time it is exposed tothe same particles it contracts more rapidly, and after several exposures, itgoes on contracting inside its tube until its foot is detached; it swims awayuntil it finds a more peaceful place to settle down, where it builds a new tubeand resumes its normal life. Aplysia shows a similar kind of sensitisation, andKandel and his group have described several changes that occur in the nervecells as this happens. Whereas habituation results in less neurotransmitterbeing released by sensory neurons in their synapses with motor neurons,sensitisation results in more being released.32[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1299395]Again, there is no need to suppose that the memory that underlies sensitisationis stored in the form of chemical changes inside the cells. Like habituation,sensitisation fits well with a self-resonance model. When a stimulus provedharmful in the past occurs, the organism resonates with itself, responding tothe same stimulus, resulting in a greater response. In addition, sensitisationcan reach a threshold where the organism does something different. Stentor swimsaway. CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_000.html#filepos0Aplysia releasestoxic ink containing hydrogen peroxide.34[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1300231]Resonant learning Many animals learn patterns of behaviour from other members of their groupthrough imitation. For example, some species of bird, like blackbirds, learnparts of songs by listening to the songs of nearby adults. This is a kind ofcultural inheritance.Cultural inheritance reaches its highest development in humanity where all humanbeings learn a great variety of patterns of behaviour, including the use oflanguage, as well as many physical and mental skills, like doing arithmetic,playing the flute or knitting. From the point of view of morphic resonance, thetransfer of these skills is a kind of resonance process.In the 1980s, neuroscientists discovered that when animals watched other animalscarrying out a particular action, changes in the motor part of their brainsmirrored those in the brains of the animals they were watching. These responsesare often described in terms of ‘mirror neurons’: the brain activity mirrorsthat of the animal being watched, and involves the same sorts of changes thattake place in carrying out the action itself. But the term mirror neuron ismisleading if it suggests that special kinds of nerves are required for thisactivity. Instead, it is better thought of as a kind of resonance. In fact,Vittorio Gallese, one of the discoverers of mirror neurons, refers to theimitation of movements or actions by another individual as ‘resonancebehaviour’.35 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1300766]Resonance behaviour is a new phrase, but the phenomenon itself is not a newdiscovery. The entire pornography industry depends on it. Watching other peopleengaged in sexual activity stimulates erotic arousal by a kind of resonance.Some neuroscientists have extended the idea of mirror systems to what they calla ‘motor resonance theory of mind reading’, whereby the nervous system responds‘to execution and observation of goal-oriented actions’.36[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1301304] This resonanceis not confined to the brain but to the entire pattern of movements of the bodyas well, and no doubt plays a major part in the learning of skills, such asriding a bicycle, and in other forms of ‘learning by doing’.Through repetition, behavioural patterns and skills improve, and becomeincreasingly habitual. Both the acquisition of new patterns of behaviour andremembering them fit well with a resonance model.Recognising Recognition involves the awareness that a pr sessof esent experience is alsoremembered: we know that we were in this place before, or met this personsomewhere, or came across this fact or idea. But we may not be able to recallwhere or when, or recall the person’s or the place’s name. Recognition andrecall are different kinds of memory: recognition depends on a similaritybetween present experience and previous experience. Recall involves an activereconstruction of the past on the basis of remembered meanings or connections.Recognising is easier than recalling. For example, it is usually easier torecognise people than remember their names. Most of us have remarkable powers ofrecognition that we usually take for granted. Many laboratory experiments havedemonstrated just how powerful this ability can be. For example, in one study,subjects were asked to memorise a meaningless shape. When they were asked torecall it by drawing it, their ability to do so declined rapidly within minutes.By contrast, most people could pick out the test shape from a range of similarshapes weeks later.37[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1301837]Recognition, like habituation, depends on morphic resonance with previoussimilar patterns of activity. The pattern of vibratory activity within yoursensory organs and nervous system when you see a person you know is similar tothe pattern when you saw the same person before. The sensory stimuli are similarand have similar effects on the sense organs and the nervous system. The greaterthe similarity, the stronger the resonance.Recalling Conscious recall is an active process. The ability to recall a particularexperience depends on the ways we made connections in the first place. To theextent that we use language to categorise and connect the elements ofexperience, we can use language to help reconstruct these past patterns. But wecannot recall connections that were not made to start with.Our short-term memory for words and phrases enables us to remember them longenough to grasp their connections and understand their meanings. We usuallyremember meanings – patterns of connection – rather than the actual words. It isrelatively easy to summarise the gist of a recent conversation but, for most ofus, impossible to reproduce it verbatim. The same is true of written language:you may recall some of the facts and ideas in the preceding chapters of thisbook, but you will probably recall very few passages word for word.Short-term memories provide the opportunities for elements of our near-presentexperience to be connected with each other, as well as with past experience.What is not connected is forgotten. Short-term memory is often compared to acomputer’s RAM (Random Access Memory), and has a very limited capacity,typically 7±2 items. In the 1940s, the neuroscientist Donald Hebb pointed outthat such short-term memories, lasting less than a minute, were unlike s, wm mlyto be stored chemically and suggested that they might depend on reverberatingcircuits of electrical activity – again implying a process of resonance.In the case of spatial recall – for instance, in remembering the layout of aparticular house – the connections between different spaces are related tomovements of the body; for example, along a corridor, climbing stairs andentering a room.The principles of memorising and recalling have long been understood; the basicprinciples of mnemonic systems were well known in classical times and weretaught to students of rhetoric, providing techniques for establishingconnections that enable items to be recalled more easily.38[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1302249] Some methodsdepend on verbal connections and involve coding the information in rhymes,phrases or sentences. For instance, ‘Richard Of York Gained Battles In Vain’ isa well-known mnemonic for the colours of the rainbow (Red, Orange, Yellow,Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet). Other systems are spatial and rely on visualimagery. For instance, in the ‘method of loci’ one first memorises a sequence oflocations; for example, the various rooms and cupboards of one’s own house. Eachitem to be recalled is then visualised in one of these locations, and rememberedby imagining walking from one place to the other and finding the object there.Modern mnemonic systems, such as systems for improving your memory poweradvertised in popular magazines, are the heirs of this long and richtradition.39 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1302660]Memorising spatial patterns in many animals depends on the activity of thehippocampus, as discussed above, and the activity of the brain in this and otherregions seems to be necessary for connecting together the items to be recalled.Between being laid down and recalled, the memories are usually supposed to beencoded in elusive long-term memory traces. The resonance hypothesis fits thefacts better. The pattern of connections established when the memories areformed is associated with rhythmic patterns of brain activity. The memories arerecalled through similar patterns of activity established by morphic resonance.They are not stored as traces in the brain.Experimental tests If memories are stored in individual animals’ brains, then anything an animallearns is confined to its own brain. When it dies the memory is extinguished.But if memory is a resonant phenomenon through which organisms specificallyresonate with themselves in the past, individual memory and collective memoryare different aspects of the same phenomenon; they differ in degree not in kind.This hypothesis is testable. If rats learn a new trick in one place, then ratsall over the world should be able to learn the same trick quicker. The more ratsthat learn it, the easier it should become everywhere else. There is alreadyevidence from one of the longest series of experiments in the history ofpsychology that rats do indeed seem to learn quicker what other rats havealready learned. The more that learned to escape from a water maze, the easierit became for others to do so. These experiments, conducted first at Harvard,then at Edinburgh and Melbourne universities, showed that the Scottish andAustralian rats took up more or less wh sre ave alreadere the Harvard rats hadleft off, and their descendants learned even faster. Some got it right firsttime with no need for learning at all. In the experiment at MelbourneUniversity, a line of control rats, whose parents had never been trained, showedthe same pattern of improvement as rats descended from trained parents, showingthat this effect was not passed through the genes, or through epigeneticmodifications of genes. All similar rats learned quicker, just as the hypothesisof morphic resonance would predict.40[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1303079]Likewise, humans should be able to learn more easily what others have alreadylearned. New skills like snowboarding and playing computer games should becomeeasier to learn, on average. Of course there will always be faster and slowerlearners, but the general tendency should be towards quicker learning. Muchanecdotal evidence suggests that this is so. But for hard, quantitativeevidence, the best place to look is in standardised tests that have remainedmore or less the same over decades. Intelligence quotient (IQ) tests are a goodexample. By morphic resonance, the questions should become easier to answerbecause so many people have answered them before. The scores in the tests shouldrise not because people are becoming more intelligent but because the tests arebecoming easier to do. Just such an effect has in fact occurred and is known asthe Flynn effect after the psychologist James Flynn who has done so much todocument this phenomenon.41[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1303763] Average IQtest scores have been rising for decades by 30 per cent or more. Data from theUnited States are in Figure 7.2. [images/00015.jpg] > > Figure 7.2. The Flynn Effect: changes in average IQ scores in the United> States, relative to 1989 values.42> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1304174] There has been a long debate among psychologists about possible reasons for theFlynn effect. Attempted explanations in terms of nutrition, urbanisation,exposure to TV and practice with examinations seem to account for only a smallpart of this effect. At first Flynn confessed himself baffled, and has tried outa number of ever more complex explanations. His most recent attempt ascribesthis effect to a change in the general culture: > The best short- se b\">43> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1304597] The trouble is that this hypothesis is vague, obscure and untestable. Morphicresonance provides a simpler explanation.Scientists in universities in Europe and America have already carried out aseries of tests specifically designed to test for morphic resonance in humanlearning, particularly in connection with written languages. Most have givenpositive, statistically significant results.44[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1305141] This isinevitably a controversial area of research but, unlike Flynn’s hypothesis,morphic resonance is relatively easy to test with animals and people.What difference does it make? I find it makes a big difference to think of tuning in to my memories, insteadof retrieving them from stores inside my brain by obscure molecular mechanisms.Resonance feels more plausible and fits better with experience. It is also morecompatible with the findings of brain research: memory traces are nowhere to befound.In research there would be a shift of focus from the molecular details of nervecells to the transfer of memory by resonance. This shift would also open up thequestion of collective memory, which the psychologist C. G. Jung thought of interms of the collective unconscious.If learning involves a process of resonance not only with the teacher who istransmitting the skill, but all those who have learned it before, educationalmethods could be improved by deliberately enhancing the process of resonance,leading to a faster and more effective transfer of skills.The resonance theory of memory also opens up a religious question. All religionstake it for granted that some aspect of a person’s memory survives that person’sbodily death. In Hindu and Buddhist theories of reincarnation or rebirth,memories, habits or tendencies are carried over from one life to another. Thistransfer of memory is part of the action of karma, a kind of causation acrosstime; actions bring about effects in the future, even in later lives. InChristianity there are several different theories of survival, but all imply asurvival of memory. According to the Roman Catholic doctrine of Purgatory, afterdeath believers enter an ongoing process of development, comparable to dreaming.This process would make no sense unless the person’s memories played a part inthe process. Some Protestants believe that after death everyone goes to sleep,only to be resurrected just before the Last Judgment. But this theory toorequires a survival of memory because the Last Judgment would be meaningless ifthe person being judged had forgotten who he was and what he had done.By contrast, the materialist theory is simple. Memories are in the brain; thebrain decays at death; therefore all memories are wiped out for ever. For anatheist, what could be a better proof of the folly of religious belief? Allreligious theories of survival are impossible because they all rely on thesurvival of personal memories, which are wiped out when the brain decays. Thematerialist theory leaves the question of the survival of bodily death closed.By contrast, the resonance theory leaves the question open. Memories themselvesdo not decay at death, but can continue to act by resonance, as long as there isa vibratory system that they can resonate with. They contribute to thecollective memory of the species. But whether or not there is an immaterial partof the self that can still access these memories in the absence of a brain isanother question.Questions for materialists"},{"pageContent":" Do you believe that memories are stored as material traces in brains? If so, canyou summarise the evidence? How do you think memory-retrieval systems recognise the memories they are tryingto retrieve from memory stores? Have you ever considered the possibility that memory might depend on some kindof resonance rather than on material traces? If the trace theory of memory is a testable hypothesis, rather than a dogma, howcould it be established experimentally that memory depends on traces rather thanresonance?Summary Repeated failures to find memory traces fit well with the idea of memory as aresonant phenomenon, where similar patterns of activity in the past affectpresent activities in minds and brains. Individual and collective memory bothdepend on resonance, but self-resonance from an individual’s own past is morespecific and hence more effective. Animal and human learning may be transmittedby morphic resonance across space and time. The resonance theory helps accountfor the ability of memories to survive serious damage to brains, and isconsistent with all known kinds of remembering. This theory predicts that ifanimals, say, rats, learn a new trick in one place, say, Harvard, rats all overthe world should be able to learn it faster thereafter. There is alreadyevidence that this actually happens. Similar principles apply to human learning.For example, if millions of people take standard tests, like IQ tests, the testsshould become progressively easier, on average, for other people to do. Again,this seems to be what happens. Individual memory and collective memory aredifferent aspects of the same phenomenon and differ in degree, not in kind.8 Are Minds Confined to Brains? Materialism is the doctrine that only matter is real. Hence minds are in brains,and mental activity is nothing but vjion Pro\">M brain activity. This assumptionconflicts with our own experience. When we look at a blackbird, we see ablackbird; we do not experience complex electrical changes in our brains. Butmost of us accepted the mind-within-the-brain theory before we ever had a chanceto question it. We took it for granted as children because it seemed to besupported by all the authority of science and the educational system.In his study of children’s intellectual development, the Swiss psychologist JeanPiaget found that before about the age of ten or eleven, European children werelike ‘primitive’ people. They did not know that the mind was confined to thehead; they thought it extended into the world around them. But by about the ageof eleven, most had assimilated what Piaget called the ‘correct’ view: ‘Imagesand thoughts are situated in the head.’1[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1305808]Educated people rarely question this ‘scientifically correct’ view in public,perhaps because they do not want to be thought stupid, childish or primitive.Yet the ‘correct’ view conflicts with our most immediate experience every timewe look around us. We see things outside our bodies; we do not experience imagesinside our heads. The materialist theory dominated academic psychology for mostof the twentieth century. The long-dominant behaviourist school explicitlydenied the reality of consciousness. The leading American behaviourist, B. F.Skinner, proclaimed in 1953 that mind and consciousness were non-existententities ‘invented for the sole purpose of providing spurious explanations . . .Since mental or psychic events are asserted to lack the dimensions of physicalscience, we have an additional reason for rejecting them.’2[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1306304] As discussedin Chapter 4, a similar denial of conscious experience is still advocated bycontemporary philosophers of the school known as ‘eliminative materialism’. PaulChurchland, for example, argues that subjectively experienced mental statesshould be regarded as non-existent because descriptions of such states cannot bereduced to the language of neuroscience.3[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1306984]Likewise, many leading scientists regard conscious experience as nothing but thesubjective experience of brain activity (see Chapter 4). Francis Crick calledthis the Astonishing Hypothesis: > ‘You’, your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your> sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the> behaviour of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules . .> . This hypothesis is so alien to the ideas of most people alive today that it> can truly be called astonishing.4> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1307400] This is, indeed, an astonishing claim. But within institutional science it iscommonplace. Crick was no revolutionary: he spoke for the mainstream. SusanGreenfield, an influential neuroscientist, looked at an exposed brain in anoperating theatre and reflected, ‘This was all there was to Sarah, or indeed toany of us . . . We are but sludgy brains, and . . . somehow a character and amind are generated in this soupy mess.’5[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1307947]The traditional alternative to materialism is dualism, the doctrine that mindsand brains are radically different: minds are immaterial and brains arematerial; minds are outside time and space, matter is inside time and space.Dualism makes better sense of our experience but makes no sense in terms ofmechanistic science, which is why materialists reject it so vehemently (seeChapter 4).We need not stay stuck in this materialist-dualist contradiction. There is a wayout: a field theory of minds. We are used to the fact that fields exist bothwithin and outside material objects. The field of a magnet is inside it and alsoextends beyond its surface. The gravitational field of the earth is inside theearth and also stretches out far beyond it, keeping the moon in its orbit. Theelectromagnetic field of a mobile phone is both inside it and extends all aroundit. In this chapter I suggest that the fields of minds are within brains andextend beyond them.Extended minds If we follow Francis Crick and treat materialism as a hypothesis, rather than aphilosophical dogma, it should be testable. As Carl Sagan liked to say,‘Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence.’ Where is the extraordinaryevidence for the materialist claim that the mind is nothing but the activity ofthe brain?There is very little. No one has ever seen a thought or image inside someoneelse’s brain, or inside his or her own.6[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1308577] When we lookaround us, the images of the things we see are outside us, not in our heads. Ourexperiences of our bodies are in our bodies. The feelings in my fingers are inmy fingers, not in my head. Direct experience offers no support for theextraordinary claim that all experiences are inside brains. Direct experience isnot irrelevant to the nature of consciousness: it is consciousness.Extended minds are implicit in our language. The words ‘attention’ and‘intention’ come from the Latin root tendere, to stretch, as in ‘tense’ and‘tension’. ‘Attention’ is ad + tendere, ‘to stretch towards’; ‘intention’, in +tendere, ‘to stretch into’.How does vision work? A debate about the nature of vision was going on in ancient Greece 2,500 yearsago. It was taken up in the Roman Empire and in the Islamic world, and continuedin Europe throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The debate played animportant part in the birth of modern science, and is still alive today.There were three main theories of how we see. The first was that vision involvesan outward projection of invisible rays through the eyes. This is often calledthe ‘extramission’ theory, which literally means ‘sending out’. Second was theidea of a ‘sending in’ of images through light into the eyes, the ‘intromission’theory. The third theory, a combination of the other two, states that there isboth an inward movement of light and an outward movement of attention.The extramission theory agrees with people’s experience of vision as an activeprocess. We look at things, and can decide where to direct our attention. Visionis not passive. Plato supported this theory of vision, and around 300 bc Euclid,famous for his works on geometry, worked it out in mathematical detail. Heshowed how projection of virtual images from the eye could explain how we seeimages in mirrors. Unlike light itself, which is reflected by mirrors, visualprojections go straight through them. They are not material.Isaac Newton accepted Euclid’s theory, and illustrated it in 1704 in his bookOpticks (Figure 8.1). Essentially the same diagram is used in science textbookstoday. A typical British physics textbook for secondary schools describes theprocess as follows: ‘Rays from a point on the object are reflected at the mirrorand appear to come from a point behind the mirror where the eye imagines therays intersect when produced backwards.’7[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_000.html#filepos13093] There is nodiscussion of how the eye ‘imagines’ rays intersecting, or how it produces thembackwards. This is essentially Euclid’s extramission theory of virtual images,but its implications are left implicit.Since the early seventeenth century the intromission theory has beenscientifically orthodox, largely thanks to the work of Johannes Kepler(1571–1630), best known for his discoveries in astronomy. Kepler realised thatlight entering the eye through the pupil was focused by the lens, and producedan inverted image on the retina. He published his theory of the retinal image in1604. Although this was a major triumph, and a landmark in the development ofmodern science, it raised questions that Kepler could not answer, and are stillunanswered today. The problem was that the images on the retinas of both eyeswere inverted and reversed; in other words, they were upside down and the leftside was at the right, and vice versa. Yet we do not see two small, inverted,reversed images.8[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1309890] [images/00016.jpg] > Figure 8.1. Isaac Newton’s diagram of reflection in a plane mirror: ‘If an> Object A can be seen by Reflexion of a Looking-glass mn, it shall appear, not> in its proper place A, but behind the Glass at a.’ (Newton, 1704, Fig. 9) The only way Kepler could deal with this problem was by excluding it fromoptics. Once the image had been formed on the retina, it was someone else’sbusiness to explain how we actually see it.9[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1310309] Vision itselfwas ‘mysterious’. Ironically, the triumph of the intromission theory wasachieved by leaving the experience of seeing unexplained. This problem hashaunted science ever since.Kepler’s contemporary, Galileo Galilei (1564–1642), likewise withdrewperceptions from the external world and squeezed them into the brain. He made adistinction between what he called primary and secondary qualities of objects.The primary qualities were those that could be measured and treatedmathematically, such as size, weight and shape. These were the concern ofobjective science. The secondary qualities, such as colour, taste, texture andsmell, were not within matter itself. They were subjective rather thanobjective. And subjective meant within the brain. Thus our direct experience ofthe world was {theture and split into two separate poles, the objective, outthere, and the subjective, within the brain.After four hundred years of mechanistic science, there has been almost noprogress in understanding how the brain produces subjective experience, althoughmany details have been discovered about the activities of different regions ofthe brain. The orthodox assumption is that the brain constructs a picture ormodel of the world inside itself. This is how an authoritative textbook calledEssentials of Neural Science and Behavior described the process: > [T]he brain constructs an internal representation of external physical events> after first analyzing them into component parts. In scanning the visual field> the brain simultaneously but separately analyzes the form of objects, their> movement, and their color, all before putting together an image according to> the brain’s own rules.10> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1310719] Most contemporary metaphors for the activity of the brain are derived fromcomputers, and ‘internal representations’ are commonly conceived of as ‘virtualreality’ displays. As the psycho logist Jeffrey Gray put it succinctly, ‘The“out there” of conscious experience isn’t really out there at all; it’s insidethe head.’ Our visual perceptions are a ‘simulation’ of the real world that is‘made by, and exists within, the brain’.11[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1311385]The idea of visual experiences as simulations inside heads leads to strangeconsequences, as the philosopher Stephen Lehar has pointed out.12[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1312057] It means thatwhen I look at the sky, the sky I see is inside my head.

They thinkthey are where they see {herhers, mostm to be, outside their heads.In the 1990s, Gerald Winer and his colleagues in the psychology department atOhio State University investigated people’s beliefs about the nature of visionthrough a series of questionnaires and tests. They were surprised thatextramission beliefs were common among children, and ‘shocked’ when theydiscovered that they were also widespread among college students, even amongthose studying psychology, who had been taught the ‘correct’ theory of vision.14[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1312879] Amongschoolchildren from grades five to eight, more than 70 per cent believed in acombined intromission-extramission theory, and among college students 59 percent.15 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1313412] Winerand his colleagues called this a ‘striking instance of a scientificmisconception’.16[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1313945] Education hadfailed to convert most of the students to the correct belief: > Given that extramissionists in our studies affirm extramission even though> they have been taught about vision, our attention is now directed to> understanding whether education can eradicate these odd, but seemingly> powerful, intuitions about perception.17> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1314369] Winer and his colleagues seem doomed to failure in their crusade forintellectual cleansing. These ‘odd’ intuitions about perception persist becausethey are closer to experience than the official doctrine, which leaves so muchunexplained – including consciousness itself.Images outside bodies Not all philosophers and psychologists believe the mind-in-the-brain theory, andover the years a minority has always recognised that our perceptions may be justwhere they seem to be, in the external world outside our heads, rather thanrepresentations inside our brains.18[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1314783] In 1904,William James wrote: > [T]he whole philosophy of perception from Democritus’ time downwards has been> just one long wrangle over the paradox that what is evidently one reality> should b {litfrom De in two places at once, both in outer space and in a> person’s mind. ‘Representative’ theories of perception avoid the logical> paradox, but on the other hand they violate the reader’s sense of life which> knows no intervening mental image but seems to see the room and the book> immediately as they physically exist.19> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1315341] As Alfred North Whitehead expressed it in 1925, ‘sensations are projected by themind so as to clothe appropriate bodies in external nature’.20[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1315903]A recent proponent of the extended mind is the psychologist Max Velmans. In hisbook Understanding Consciousness (2000), he proposed a ‘reflexive model’ of themind, which he illustrated by this discussion of a subject (S) looking at a cat: > According to reductionists there seems to be a phenomenal cat ‘in S’s mind’,> but this is really nothing more than a state of her brain. According to the> reflexive model, while S is gazing at the cat, her only visual experience of> the cat is the cat she sees out in the world. If she is asked to point to this> phenomenal cat (her ‘cat experience’), she should point not to her brain but> to the cat as perceived, out in space beyond the body surface.21> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1316450] Velmans suggested that this image might be like ‘a kind of neural “projectionhologram”. A projection hologram has the interesting quality that thethree-dimensional image it encodes is perceived to be out in space, in front ofits two-dimensional surface.’22[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1316996] But Velmanswas ambiguous about the nature of this projection. A hologram is, after all, afield phenomenon. He called it ‘psychological’ rather than ‘physical’ and in theend said he did not know how it happened, but added, ‘not fully understandinghow it happens does not alter the fact that it happens’.My own suggestion is that the outward projection of visual images is bothpsychological and physical. It occurs through perceptual fields {eptan>ces oftheir bodies, and hear things through projected auditory fields. We are likeother animals.The senses are not static. The eyes move as we look at things, and our heads andentire bodies move around in our environments. As we move, our perceptual fieldschange. Perceptual fields are not separate from our bodies, but include them. Wecan see our own outer surface, our skin, hair and clothing. We are inside ourfields of vision and action. Our awareness of three-dimensional space includesour own bodies within it, and our movements and intentions in relation to whatis around us. Like other animals, we are not passive perceivers but activebehavers, and our perceptions and behaviour are closely linked.23[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1317539]Some neuroscientists and philosophers agree that perceptions depend on the closeconnection between perception and activity, linking an animal or person to theenvironment. One school of thought advocates an ‘enactive’ or ‘embodied’ or‘sensorimotor’ approach. Perceptions are not represented in a world-model insidethe head, but are enacted or ‘brought forth’ as a result of the interaction ofthe organism and its environment. As Francisco Varela and his colleaguesexpressed it, ‘perception and action have evolved together . . . perception isalways perceptually guided activity’.24[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1317951] As thephilosopher Arva Noë put it, ‘We are out of our heads. We are in the world andof it. We are patterns of active engagement with fluid boundaries and changingcomponents. We are distributed.’25[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1318487] Thepsychologist Kevin O’Regan, a committed materialist, prefers this approach tothe mind-in-the-brain theory precisely because he wants to expel all magic fromthe brain. He does not accept that seeing is in the brain, because this would‘put you in the terrible situation of having to postulate some magical mechanismthat endows the visual cortex with sight, and the auditory cortex withhearing’.26 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1319030]Henri Bergson anticipated the enactive and sensorimotor approaches more than acentury ago. He emphasised that perception is directed towards action. Throughperception, ‘The objects which surround my body reflect its possible action uponthem.’27 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1319581] Theimages are not inside the brain: > The truth is that the point P, the rays which it emits, the retina and the n> {ina fiervous elements affected, form a single whole; that the luminous point> P is a part of this whole; and that it is really in P, and not elsewhere, that> the image of P is formed and perceived.28> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1320125] My own interpretation is that vision takes place through extended perceptualfields, which are both within the brain and stretch out beyond it.29[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1320666] Vision isrooted in the activity of the brain, but is not confined to the inside of thehead. Like Velmans, I suggest that the formation of these fields depends onchanges in various regions of the brain as vision takes place, influenced byexpectations, intentions and memories. These are a kind of morphic field and,like other morphic fields, connect together parts within wholes, and have aninherent memory given by morphic resonance from similar fields in the past (seeChapter 3). When I look at a person or an animal, my perceptual field interactswith the field of the person or animal I am looking at, enabling my gaze to bedetected.Our experience certainly suggests that our minds are extended beyond our brains.We see and hear things in the space around us. But there is a strong tabooagainst anything that suggests that seeing and hearing might involve any kind ofoutward projection. This issue cannot be resolved by theoretical argumentsalone, or else there would have been more progress over the last century – oreven over the last 2,500 years.I am convinced that the way forward is to treat fields of the mind as a testablescientific hypothesis rather than a philosophical theory. When I look atsomething, my perceptual fields ‘clothe’ what I am looking at. My mind toucheswhat I am seeing. Therefore I might be able to affect another person just bylooking. If I look at someone from behind when she cannot hear me, or see me,and does not know I am there, can she feel my gaze?The detection of stares Most people have felt someone looking at them from behind, turned around and metthe person’s eyes. Most people have also experienced the converse: they havesometimes made people turn round by staring at them. In extensive surveys inEurope and North America, between 70 and 97 per cent of adults and childrenreported experiences of these kinds.30[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1321082]In surveys I carried out in Britain, Sweden and the United States, theseexperiences seemed to be { semost common when people were being stared at by strangers in public places, suchas streets and bars. They happened more when people felt vulnerable than whenthey felt secure.When people made others turn around by staring at them, both men and women saidthat curiosity was their most frequent reason for staring, followed by a desireto attract the other person’s attention. Other motives included sexualattraction, anger and affection.31[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1322022] In short, theability to detect someone’s attention was associated with a range of motives andemotions.In some Oriental martial arts, students are trained to increase theirsensitivity to being looked at from behind.32[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1322438] And somepeople observe others for a living. The sense of being stared at is well knownto many police officers, surveillance personnel and soldiers, as I found througha series of interviews with professionals. Most felt that some people they werewatching seemed to know, even though the watchers were well hidden. For example,a narcotics officer in Plains, Texas, said, ‘I’ve noticed that a lot of timesthe crook will just get a feeling that things aren’t right, that he’s beingwatched. We often have somebody look right in our direction even though he can’tsee us. A lot of times we’re inside a vehicle.’ When detectives are trained tofollow people, they are told not to stare at their backs any more than necessarybecause otherwise the person might turn around, catch their eye and blow theircover.33 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1322716]According to experienced surveillance officers, this sense also works at adistance when people are watched through binoculars. Several soldiers told methat some people could tell when they were being looked at through telescopicsights. For example, a soldier in the US Marine Corps served as a sniper inBosnia in 1995, where he was assigned to shoot ‘known terrorists’. While aimingthrough the telescopic sight of his rifle, he found that people seemed to knowwhen he was aiming at them. ‘Within one second prior to actual termination, atarget would somehow seem to make eye contact with me. I am convinced that thesepeople somehow sensed my presence at distances over one mile. They did so withuncanny accuracy, in effect to stare down my own scope.’Many celebrity photographers have had similar experiences. One long-lensphotographer who worked for the Sun, the most popular tabloid newspaper inBritain, said that he was amazed by how many times his quarries would ‘turnround and look right down the lens’, even if they were looking in the oppositedirection to start with. He did not think they could see him or detect hismovements. ‘I am talking about taking pictures at distances of up to half a mileaway in situations where it is quite impossible for people to see me, although Ican see them. They are so aware it is uncanny.’ {=00 are so aw34[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1322994]Many species of non-human animals also seem able to detect looks. Some huntersand wildlife photographers are convinced that animals can detect their gaze evenwhen they are hidden and looking at the animals through telescopic lenses orsights. One British deer hunter found that the animals seemed to detect hisintention, especially if he delayed shooting when he had them in his riflesights: ‘If you wait a fraction too long, it will just take off. It’ll senseyou.’Several bird photographers told me that when they were in hides, invisible tothe birds they were watching, the birds still seemed to know when they werebeing looked at. One said, ‘I spend a lot of time in hides and it is uncanny howbirds can just seem to sense you are there, become agitated, even though youknow you haven’t moved. With herons you can tell instantly that they are alertto danger. Very often the lens is completely still and they suddenly seem torealise that there is something looking at them, and their heads go up and theygo very stiff and wait to see if they can see anything else.’35[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1323272]Conversely, some photographers and hunters had felt wild animals looking atthem.36 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1323550] Thenaturalist William Long wrote that when he was sitting in the woods alone, > I often found within myself an impression which I expressed in the words,> ‘Something is watching you.’ Again and again, when nothing stirred in my> sight, that curious warning would come; and almost invariably, on looking> around, I would find some bird or fox or squirrel which had probably caught a> slight motion of my head and had halted his roaming to creep near and watch me> inquisitively.37> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1324107] Some pet owners claim that they can wake their sleeping dogs or cats by staringat them. Others have found it works the other way round and that their animalscan wake them by staring.In their surveys in Ohio, Winer and his colleagues found that more than a thirdof their respondents said they had felt when animals were looking at them. Abouthalf believed that animals could feel their looks, even when the animals couldnot see their eyes.38[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1324517]If the sense of being stared at is real, then it must have been subject toevolution by natural selection. How might it have evolved? The most obviouspossibility is in the context of predator-prey relations. Prey animals thatdetected when predators were looking at them would stand a better chance ofsurviving than those that did not.39[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1325053]Experimental tests Since the 1980s the sense of being stared at has been investigatedexperimentally both through direct looking and also through closed circuittelevision (CCTV). In the scientific literature it is variously referred to as‘unseen gaze detection’ or ‘remote attention’ or ‘scopaesthesia’ (from Greekskopein, to view, and aisthetikos, sensitive).In direct-looking experiments, people work in pairs, with a subject and alooker. In a randomised series of trials, blindfolded subjects sit with theirbacks to the lookers, who either stare at the back of their necks, or look awayand think of something else. A mechanical signal – a click or a beep – marks thebeginning of each trial. Within a few seconds the subjects guess whether theyare being looked at or not. Their guesses are either right or wrong, and arerecorded immediately. A test usually consists of twenty trials.These tests are so simple that a child can do them, and thousands of childrenalready have. In the 1990s, this research was popularised through New Scientistmagazine, BBC TV and Discovery Channel TV, and many tests were conducted inschools and as student projects at universities. Altogether, tens of thousandsof trials were carried out.40[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1325469] The resultswere remarkably consistent. Typically, about 55 per cent of the guesses wereright, as opposed to 50 per cent expected by chance. Although the effect wassmall, because it was so widely replicated it was highly significantstatistically. In more rigorous experiments subjects and starers were separatedby windows or one-way mirrors, eliminating the possibility of subtle cues bysound or even smell. They were still able to tell when they were beingwatched.41 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1325747]The largest experiment on the sense of being stared at began in 1995 at the NEMOScience Centre in Amsterdam. More than 18,000 pairs took part, with positiveresults that were highly significant statistically.42[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1326163] The most{o\">argsensitive subjects were children under the age of nine.43[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1326856]Surprisingly, the sense of being stared at works even when people are looked aton screens, rather than directly. CCTV systems are routinely used forsurveillance in shopping malls, banks, airports, streets and other publicspaces. My assistants and I interviewed surveillance officers and securitypersonnel whose job it was to observe people on screens. Most were convincedthat some people could feel when they were being watched.44[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1327134] The securitymanager in a large firm in London had no doubt that some people have a sixthsense: ‘They can have their backs to the cameras, or be scanned using hiddendevices, yet they still become agitated when the camera is trained on them. Somemove on, some look around for the camera.’In laboratory tests, many people respond physiologically to being watchedthrough CCTV, even though they are unconscious of their response. In theseexperiments, the researchers put a subject in one room and a looker in another,where the subject could be watched through CCTV. The subjects’ galvanic skinresponse was recorded, as in lie-detector tests, enabling emotional changes tobe detected through differences in sweating; wet skin conducts electricitybetter than dry skin. In a randomised series of trials, the starers eitherlooked at the subject’s image on the TV monitor, or looked away and thought ofsomething else. The subjects’ skin resistance changed significantly when theywere being looked at.45[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1327550]The fact that gaze detection works through CCTV shows that people can detectother people’s attention even when they are not being watched directly.The effects of attention at a distance show that minds are not confined to theinsides of brains.Minds extended in time"},{"pageContent":" Minds extend beyond brains in time as well as space. We are connected to thepast by memory and habit, and to the future by desires, plans and intentions.Are these memories and virtual futures contained materially within brains in thepresent, or are minds connected to the past and future by non-material links?The conventional answer is that our memories and intentions must be insidebrains in the present. Where else could they be? The computer metaphorreinforces this way of thinking. A computer’s memories are stored on magnetic oroptical disks, or in solid-state memory systems. These memories are materialstructures or patterns in the present. And just as the computer’s memories existphysically in its present, so its programmed goals are present in it too. Pastand future are both physically present. By analogy, memories, goals, plans andintentions are physically present in brains.The assumption that memories are stored materially inside brains was discussedin the previous chapter. The assumption that future goals are inside brains isequally questionable. They exist {e. ese me in a realm of possibility; they arevirtual futures. Possibilities are not material. In quantum physics, the wavefunction that describes how electrons or other particles might behave is amathematical model in a multi-dimensional space based on ‘complex numbers’ thatinclude an imaginary number, the square root of –1. The wave function mapspossible future states of the system in terms of probabilities. When a quantumparticle such as an electron interacts with a physical system, for example in aprocess of being measured in a laboratory, the wave function collapses into oneof its many possible outcomes. Many possibilities are reduced to an objectivelyobservable fact, just as they are when a person takes a decision and acts on it.But the wave function itself is not material; it is a mathematical descriptionof possibilities.As the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead suggested, minds and matter arerelated as processes in time, rather than in space (see Chapter 4). The subjectchooses among its potential futures, and the direction of mental causation runsfrom potential futures to the present. Neither the future nor the past ismaterial, but both have effects in the present through memories, habits andchoices.According to the hypothesis of morphic resonance, similar processes occur at alllevels of organisation, including biological morphogenesis. As a carrot seeddevelops into a carrot plant, it is shaped by its morphogenetic fields,inherited from previous carrot plants by morphic resonance. These morphogeneticfields contain the attractors and chreodes that channel its development towardsthe form of a mature plant (see Chapters 5 and 6). Neither inherited habits norfuture goals are material structures present in the plant; instead they arepatterns of goal-directed activity. In a similar way neither memories norpurposes are contained in brains, although they influence brain activity.Most of our mental activity is habitual and unconscious. Conscious mentalactivity is largely concerned with possible actions, including speaking. Ourconscious minds inhabit the realm of possibility, and languages greatly expandthe possibilities they can entertain. Think of hearing a story. Our minds canembrace possibilities that go far beyond our own experience. Conscious mindschoose among possibilities, and their choices collapse possibilities intoactions that are objectively observable in the physical world. The arrow ofcausation is from the virtual future, going ‘backwards’ in time. In this senseminds act as final causes, setting goals and purposes.In order to make choices, minds must contain alternative possibilities:coexisting at the same time. In the language of quantum physics, thesepossibilities are ‘superposed’. The physicist Freeman Dyson wrote, ‘Theprocesses of human consciousness differ only in degree but not in kind from theprocesses of choice between quantum states which we call “chance” when made byelectrons.’46 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1328229]According to the hypoth {to nr8-46esis of morphic resonance, all self-organisingsystems, including protein molecules, Acetabularia cells, carrot plants, humanembryos and flocks of birds, are shaped by memory from previous similar systemstransmitted by morphic resonance and drawn towards attractors through chreodes.Their very being involves an invisible presence of both past and future. Mindsare extended in time not because they are miraculously different from ordinarymatter, but because they are self-organising systems. All self-organisingsystems are extended in time, shaped by morphic resonance from the past, anddrawn towards attractors in the future.What difference does it make? Liberating minds from confinement in heads is like being released from prison.Most people have already broken out in secret. Even most materialists are nottrue believers when it comes to themselves; they effectively ignore thematerialist theory in their private lives. They do not take seriously the ideathat their skulls are beyond the sky. In practice, they are dualists who believethey make free choices.Those who take their materialist faith seriously ought to believe that they arelike robots with no free will. And some materialists actually want to experiencethemselves as automata. For example, the psychologist Kevin O’Regan told hisfellow materialist Susan Blackmore, ‘Ever since I’ve been a child I’ve wanted tobe a robot. I think one of the great difficulties of human life is that one’slife is inhabited by uncontrollable desires and that if one could only be masterof those and become more like a robot one would be much better off.’ He thoughteveryone else was a robot too, but ‘just labouring under the illusion that theyweren’t’. But as Blackmore pointed out, a robot with emotions it could controlwould be an unusual kind of robot.47[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1328640] O’Regan isexceptional in extending materialist theories to the realm of private life, butnevertheless he endowed his robot-self with a desire to be master of hisemotions, implying both conscious experience and choice.Materialism is unpersuasive if one takes one’s own experience into account. Butbecause it is the creed of established science, its authority is enormous. Thatis why so many educated people try to resolve this dilemma by adopting amaterialist persona in scientific discourse, while in private accepting thereality of conscious experience and choice.A field theory of minds and bodies liberates us from this stalemate. Minds areclosely connected to fields that extend beyond brains in space, and also extendbeyond brains in time, linked to the past by morphic resonance and to virtualfutures through attractors.Questions for materialists When you look at the sky, do you think that the sky you are seeing is insideyour skull, and that your skull is beyond the sky? Have you ever felt someone was looking at you from behind, or have you ever madesomeone turn around by staring at him? Do you believe that all your conscious life and all your bodily experience isinside your brain? In quantum physics, electrons are described by wave equations that include allthe electron’s future possibilities, which are not material. Do you think thatthe possibilities among which you choose are more material than those ofelectrons?Summary Our minds are extended in every act of perception, reaching even as far as thestars. Vision involves a two-way process: the inward movement of light into theeyes, and the outward projection of images. What we see around us is in ourminds but not in our brains. When we look at something, in a sense our mindtouches it. This may help to explain the sense of being stared at. Most peoplesay they have felt someone looking at them from behind, and claim to have madepeople turn round by looking at them. The ability to detect stares seems to bereal, as shown in many scientific tests, and even seems to work through closedcircuit television. Minds are extended beyond brains not only in space but alsoin time, and connect us to our own pasts through memory and to virtual futures,among which we choose.9 Are Psychic Phenomena Illusory?"},{"pageContent":" Most materialist dogmas go almost unquestioned. But the claim that psychicphenomena are illusory is inevitably controversial. Most people have hadseemingly telepathic or precognitive experiences. Most have felt they were beinglooked at from behind, and have turned round, or they have made others turn bystaring at them, as discussed in Chapter 8. Many pet owners have noticed thattheir dogs and cats seem to pick up their intentions, even when they are out ofsight. Such occurrences are sometimes called intuitive, or psychic, orparapsychological, or are attributed to a sixth or seventh sense, or toextra-sensory perception (ESP) or to psi, short for psyche.For committed materialists, all such phenomena are illusory. Minds are insidebrains, and mental activity is nothing but electrochemical brain activity. Hencethoughts and intentions cannot have direct effects at a distance; neither canminds be open to influences from the future. Although such paranormal phenomenaseem to occur, they must have normal explanations in terms of coincidence, orsubtle sensory cues, or wishful thinking, or fraud.This controversy has endured for generations and raises the question of thenature of science itself. Is science a belief system, or is it a method ofenquiry? Materialism has been the standard view since the late nineteenthcentury, but a small minority of researchers has continued to inv ~g1\"face=\"Mestigate psychic phenomena because they will enlarge our understanding ofminds, if they are real, and widen the scope of science.The first organisation devoted to the investigation of these phenomena, theBritish Society for Psychical Research, was established in 1882. Its purpose isstill reprinted in every issue of the Journal of the Society for PsychicalResearch: ‘To examine without prejudice or presupposition and in a scientificspirit those faculties of man, real or supposed, which appear to be inexplicableon any generally recognised hypothesis.’ From the very beginning this enterprisewas controversial. Commenting on this new organisation, the physiologist Hermannvon Helmholtz, who played such an important part in the establishment of theprinciple of conservation of energy in living organisms (see Chapter 2),dismissed the possibility of telepathy out of hand: ‘Neither the testimony ofall the fellows of the Royal Society, nor even the evidence of my own sense,would lead me to believe in the transmission of thought from one person toanother independently of the recognised channels of sense. It is clearlyimpossible.’1 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1329292]Not much has changed. Although a growing body of evidence from psychic researchand parapsychology suggests that telepathy, precognition and other psychicphenomena are real, materialists still believe they are impossible and thatpsychical research is inherently pseudoscientific. In 2010, the veteran scepticJames Alcock declared: > The parapsychological quest is motivated not by scientific theory, nor by> anomalous data produced in the course of mainstream science. Rather, it is> motivated by deeply held beliefs on the part of the researchers – belief that> the mind is more than an epiphenomenal reflection of the physical brain,> belief that it is capable of transcending the physical limits normally imposed> by time and space. It is this belief in the possibility of such impossible> things that sustains parapsychology and leaves it relatively undaunted by the> slings and arrows of (yes, sometimes outrageous) criticism.2> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1329720] This situation recalls a story about a witty English clergyman, Sydney Smith.Around 1800, he was strolling along a narrow street with a friend when theypassed beneath two women leaning out of opposite windows screaming insults ateach other. ‘The two ladies will never agree,’ Smith commented, as the debateraged over his head, ‘for they are arguing from different premises.’3[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1330161]The materialist premise is that the nature of minds is already understood inprinciple: mental activity is brain activity, and is located inside heads. Hencepsychic phenomena are impossible. The premise of psychic researchers is thatpsychic phenomena are possible, although not yet understood; and only bystudying them can more be found out.These different premises are also reflected in the terms ‘normal’ and‘paranormal’. Psychic phenomena are normal in the sense that they are common:for example, most people have made other people turn round by staring at them,or had seemingly telepathic experience with telephone calls, as discussed below.But because these experiences do not fit in with the materialist mind-in-braintheory, they are classified as paranormal, literally meaning ‘beyond thenormal’. In this sense, ‘normal’ is defined not by what actually happens, but bythe assumptions of materialists.Likewise, the term parapsychology means ‘beyond psychology’ and implies that itis not part of normal psychology. I think this term is unfortunate and preferthe older term ‘psychic research’, or ‘psi research’ for short. If psi phenomenaexist, which I think they do, they are normal, not paranormal; natural, notsupernatural. They are part of human nature and animal nature, and they can beinvestigated scientifically.Sceptics often repeat the slogan that ‘extraordinary claims demand extraordinaryevidence’, which is another expression of the materialist assumption. The senseof being stared at and telepathy are ordinary, in that most people haveexperienced them. They are not ‘extraordinary’, meaning ‘beyond the normalorder’, or ‘highly exceptional’:4[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1330587] they arecommon. From this point of view, the sceptics’ claim is extraordinary anddemands extraordinary evidence. Where is the extraordinary evidence that mostpeople are deluded about their own experience? Sceptics can only fall back ongeneric arguments about the fallibility of human judgement – or, rather, otherpeople’s judgements.In this chapter, I consider research on telepathy and precognition orpresentiment. In the interests of brevity, I omit the other two main areas ofpsi research: clairvoyance, the ability to see or experience things at adistance, sometimes called remote viewing; and psychokinesis, ormind-over-matter effects.5[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1331088] I then returnto the opinions of sceptics.How an open-minded scientist opened my mind Telepathy literally means ‘distant feeling’, from the Greek tele, ‘distant’, asin telephone and television, and pathe, ‘feeling’, as in sympathy and empathy.In the course of my sciense ro\">, ‘ftific education at school and university, Iwas converted to the materialist worldview, and absorbed the standard attitudetowards telepathy and other psychic phenomena. I dismissed them. I did not studythe evidence because I assumed there was none worth reading. But when I was agraduate student in the Department of Biochemistry at Cambridge University,someone mentioned telepathy in a conversation in the laboratory tearoom. Idismissed it out of hand. But sitting nearby was one of the doyens of Britishbiochemistry, Sir Rudolph Peters, formerly professor of biochemistry at Oxford,who after retirement continued his research in our laboratory in Cambridge. Hewas kindly, his eyes twinkled, and he had more curiosity than most people halfhis age. He asked if any of us had ever looked at the evidence. We had not. Hetold us he had done some research on this subject himself, and had come to theconclusion that something unexplained was really happening. He later told me thestory in detail, and gave me a paper he had published on the subject in theJournal of the Society for Psychical Research.6[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1331934]A friend of his, E. G. Recordon, an ophthalmologist, had a boy patient who wasseverely disabled, mentally retarded and almost blind. Yet in routine eye testshe seemed able to read the letters very well, apparently by ‘remarkableguesswork’. Recordon said, ‘It gradually dawned on me that this “guesswork” wasparticularly interesting; and I came to the conclusion that he must be workingthrough his mother.’ It turned out that the boy could only read the letters whenhis mother was looking at them, raising the possibility of telepathy.Peters and Recordon did some preliminary experiments at the family’s home. Ascreen separated the mother and son, preventing the boy from picking up anyvisual cues. When his mother was shown a series of written numbers or words, theboy guessed many of them correctly. Peters and his colleagues could not observeany sign of cueing by sound or subtle movements. They then carried out twoexperiments over the telephone, which they tape-recorded. The mother was takento a laboratory six miles away, while the boy remained at home in Cambridge. Theexperimenters had a set of cards on which randomly selected numbers or letterswere written. The cards were shuffled so that they were in a random order. Oneof the researchers turned up a card and showed it to the mother. The boy, at theother end of the telephone line, then guessed what it was, and the motherresponded by saying ‘right’ or ‘no’. The mother was then shown the next card,and so on. Each trial lasted only a few seconds.In the trials with letters, there was a 1 in 26 (3.8 per cent) chance ofguessing the letter correctly at random. The boy guessed correctly in 38 percent of the trials. When he was wrong, he was given a second guess and was right27 per cent of the time. In experiments with random numbers he was likewisecorrect far more than would have been expected by random guessing. The oddsagainst these results arising by chance were billions to one. Peters concludedthat this was indeed a case of telepathy, which had developed to an unusualdegree because of the boy’s extreme needs and the mother’s desire to help him.7[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1332475] As heremarked, ‘In every respect the mother was emotionally involved in trying tohelp her backward son.’As I later came to understand, telepathy usually occurs between people who areclosely bonded, such as parents and children, spouses, and close friends.8[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1333267] Peters’sinvestigation was unusual in that he studied a case where the bonds between the‘sender’ and the ‘receiver’ were unusually strong. By contrast, most experimentsby psychic researchers and parapsychologists have used pairs of strangers,between whom the effects were much smaller. Nevertheless, taken together, theseexperiments produced an impressive body of evidence.Telepathy in the laboratory Between 1880 and 1939, dozens of investigators published a total of 186 papersdescribing four million card-guessing trials, in which subjects guessed whichrandomly selected card a ‘sender’ was looking at. Most of these tests gave hitrates modestly above the level expected by random guessing, and when combinedtogether in a statistical procedure called meta-analysis, the overall resultswere hugely significant statistically.9[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1333688]Sceptics often argue that such impressive collections of data are misleading,because researchers may publish only positive results, and leave negativestudies unpublished in their files, the so-called ‘file-drawer effect’. Thisobjection is plausible, but it applies to all branches of science, includingphysics, chemistry and biology, where most data go unpublished. Psychicresearchers experience much more sceptical scrutiny than scientists inconventional fields, and are also more aware of the importance of publishingstatistically non-significant results, and actually do so. Anyway, calculationsshow how many unsuccessful studies would be needed to bring down the results ofthese card-guessing tests to chance levels. There would have to be 626,000unpublished reports, or in other words 3,,300 unpublished studies for every onethat was published.10[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1334097] This isimplausible.Many card-guessing trials were carried out at the famous parapsychologylaboratory at Duke University, North Carolina, from the 1920s to the 1960s usinga set of five specially prepared cards with abstract symbols on them. By chancesubjects would have been right 20 per cent of the time. In hundreds of thousandsof trials, the average hit rate was 21 per cent, only slightly above the chancelevel, but highly significant statistically because of the large number oftrials.11 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1334375]Unfortunately, the experimenters’ desire to follow rigorous scientificprocedures led them to adopt procedures far removed from the way telepathyoccurs in real life. These repetitive, boring laboratory tests between strangersusing abstract stimuli were about as unnatural as it was possible to be.In the 1960s, a new generation of researchers tried to find ways of doingresearch that were closer to the conditions under which telepathy occursspontaneously, particularly in dreams. A team led by Stanley Krippner carriedout a series of dream telepathy tests in which subjects slept in a soundproofeddream laboratory. Electrodes were attached to their heads to measure brain wavesthrough an electroencephalograph (EEG), and eye movements were monitored. Rapideye movements (REM) typically occur during dreams, and hence the researcherscould tell when the subjects were dreaming. Before the subject went to bed, shemet the sender, who thereafter stayed in another room, and in some cases inanother building, miles away. When she was asleep and her eye movementsindicated that she was dreaming, the sender opened a sealed package containing arandomly selected picture and concentrated on it, trying to influence thesubject’s dream. The subject was then woken by a buzzer and asked to describeher dream. Her comments were tape-recorded and transcribed. A panel ofindependent judges then compared the description of the dream with the pool ofpictures from which the test picture had been selected at random, and decidedwhich agreed best with the descriptions.In some cases the agreement was very striking: one subject dreamed about buyingtickets for a boxing match while the sender was looking at a picture of a boxingmatch. Sometimes the connection was more symbolic: for example, the subjectdreamed of a dead rat in a cigar box, while the sender was looking at a pictureof a dead gangster in a coffin.12[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1334653] In a total of450 dream telepathy trials, the overall results were very significantly abovethe chance level.13[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1335087]In the 1970s, several parapsychologists developed a new kind of telepathy testin which the subjects were in a state of mild sensory deprivation, because theythought that subjects were likely to do better when relaxed. The subjectreclined in a comfortable chair in a special soundproofed room wearingheadphones that played continuous white noise. Over their eyes were halvedping-pong balls, held on with tape, and they were bathed in dim red light. Thisset-up was called the ganzfeld, from a German word meaning ‘whole field’.Meanwhile, the sender, in a separate soundproofed room, looked at a photographor a video randomly selected from a pool of four. The subject spoke about herimpressions and was recorded. At the end of the fifteen- or thirty-minutesession, she was shown all four images from the pool in a random order and askedto rank them according to their closeness to her experience. If she placed thetarget image first, this counted as a hit.By random guessing, subjects would have been right about one time in four, or 25per cent of the time. By 1985, there had been twenty-eight ganzfeld studies inten different laboratories, and the overall hit rate was 35 per cent, highlysignificant statistically. A well-known academic sceptic, Ray Hyman, agreed thatthe data showed a significant effect but thought it might have been due to avariety of flaws in the procedure. He and a leading researcher in the field,Charles Honorton, issued a joint communiqué specifying strict criteria thatfuture tests should follow to eliminate possible flaws.14[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1335671]Subsequent research followed these agreed criteria, and in this new series ofstudies the average hit rate was 34 per cent, again very significantly above the25 per cent chance level.15[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1336251] In most ofthese studies the senders and receivers were strangers. When tests were donebetween people who knew each other well, for example mothers and daughters, thescores were far higher.16[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1337725]>Animal telepathy"},{"pageContent":" Sir Rudolph Peters opened my mind to the possibility of telepathy and I amgrateful to him for it. But as I began to take an interest in the subject, Isoon realised that almost all psychic research and parapsychology concernedhumans. Was this because psychic powers were special attributes of human beings?Or was it simply a reflection of the human-centred interests of researchers?Could animals be telepathic too? It seemed to me that if telepathy existed inhumans, it might well be an ability shared with other animals.At this stage, I came across a remarkable book written by William Long, calledHow Animals Talk, published in 1919.17[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1338294] Some of hismost fascinating studies concerned wolves, which he observed for months on endin Canada. He found that separated members of wolf packs remained in contactwith each other and responded to each other’s activities over many miles. Wolvesseparated from the pack not only seemed to know what the others were doing butwhere they were. Their responsiveness involved more than following habitualpaths, tracking scent trails, or by hearing howling or other sounds.As Long pointed out, the same abilities may occur in domesticated animals. Hewas particularly interested in the ability of some dogs to know when theirowners were coming home, and he described some simple experiments carried out bya friend of his with a return-anticipating dog. The dog started waiting for itsowner soon after he had started his journey and waited for more than half anhour before he arrived home, even at non-routine times.Unfortunately no one followed this lead. The subject of telepathy was taboo, andbiologists avoided it. I started asking friends, family members and neighboursif they had ever noticed that their animals could anticipate when someone wascoming home. I soon heard some very relevant stories. For example, in my hometown, Newark-on-Trent, in Nottinghamshire, one of my neighbours was a widow whokept a cat that was very attached to her son, a seaman in the Merchant Navy. Hedid not tell her when he would be coming home on leave because he was afraid shewould worry if he was late. But she knew anyway, because the cat sat on thefront-door mat miaowing for an hour or two before he arrived. The cat’sbehaviour gave her time to get her son’s room ready and prepare a meal for him.I appealed through the media for people to tell me about their experiences withdogs and cats that anticipated arrivals, and soon received dozens of reports. By2011, on my database I had more than a thousand accounts of dogs and more thansix hundred of cats that anticipated their owners’ returns. Many of thesestories made it clear that the animals’ responses were not simply reactions tothe sounds of a familiar car, or familiar footsteps in the street. They happenedtoo long in advance, and they also happened when people came home by bus ortrain. Nor was it just a matter of routine. Some people worked irregular hours,like plumbers, lawyers and taxi drivers, and yet those at home knew when theywer whcoming hoe coming because the dog or cat waited at the door or window,sometimes half an hour or more before the person arrived. More than twenty otherspecies showed similar anticipatory behaviour, especially parrots and horses,but also a ferret, several bottle-fed lambs raised as pets, and pet geese. Inrandom household telephone surveys in Britain and the United States, I foundthat in about 50 per cent of dog-owning households and about 30 per cent ofcat-owning households, the animals were said to anticipate the arrival of amember of the family.18[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1338914]I carried out experiments with return-anticipating dogs to find out whether theyreally did anticipate their owners’ returns, even when they could not have knownby ‘normal’ means. The first and most extensive tests were with a terrier calledJaytee, who lived near Manchester, England, with his owner, Pam Smart.Preliminary observations revealed that Jaytee usually started waiting for Pamjust before she set off homewards, apparently when she formed the intention todo so. He did this whatever the time of day on 85 out of 100 return journeys. Onsome occasions when he failed to react he was sick; on others there was a bitchon heat in the next flat, showing that Jaytee could be distracted. But on 85 percent of the occasions he seemed to anticipate Pam’s return.19[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1339466]In formal, randomised tests, Pam went at least five miles away from home. Whileshe was out, the place where Jaytee waited was filmed continuously on time-codedvideotape. She did not know in advance when she would be going home and she didso only when she received a message from me via a telephone pager at a randomlyselected time. She travelled by taxi, in a different vehicle each time, to avoidany familiar car sounds. On average, Jaytee was at the window only four per centof the time during the main period of Pam’s absence, and 55 per cent of the timewhen she was on the way back. This difference was very significantstatistically.20[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1339891]I carried out many further filmed observations of Jaytee’s behaviour,21[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1340317] and didsimilar experiments with other dogs, notably a Rhodesian Ridgeback calledKane.22 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1343592] Againand again, on film and under controlled conditions, these dogs anticipated theirowners’ returns.rs>Domestic animals seem to pick up their owners’ thoughts and intentions in otherways: for example, many cats seem to know when they are going to be taken to thevet; they hide. Most dramatically, some animals seem to sense when their ownershave had accidents or have died in distant places. On my database, there are 177accounts of dogs apparently responding to the death or distress of their humancompanions, most by howling, whining or whimpering, and 62 accounts of catsshowing signs of distress. Conversely, in 32 instances, people knew when theirpet had died or was in dire need.23[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1344018]The most remarkable animal I have come across is an African Grey parrot, N’kisi.His vocabulary of around 1,500 words is probably the largest ever recorded. Whenhe was only about two years old, his owner, Aimée Morgana, noticed that heseemed to respond to her thoughts or intentions by saying what she was thinking.He slept in her bedroom, and woke her up on several occasions by commentingloudly on what she was dreaming.She and I set up a controlled experiment in which she viewed a series ofphotographs in a random sequence while she was in a different room on a separatefloor, being filmed continuously. The pictures were in a random order andrepresented twenty words in N’kisi’s vocabulary, like ‘flower’, ‘hug’ and‘phone’. Meanwhile, N’kisi, who was alone, was also filmed continuously. Heoften said words that corresponded to the image she was viewing, and did so muchmore frequently than expected by chance. The results were highly significantstatistically.24[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1344434]The natural history of human telepathy The laboratory investigations of telepathy by parapsychologists provide evidencethat it happens, but shed little light on telepathy in real-life situations.When Laurens van der Post was living with Bushmen in the Kalahari desert, insouthern Africa, he found that they seemed to be in telepathic contact on aregular basis. On one occasion he went hunting with a group of men and theykilled an eland about fifty miles away from the camp. As they were driving backin a Land Rover laden with meat, van der Post asked one of the Bushmen how thepeople would react when they learned of their success. He replied, ‘They alreadyknow. They know by wire . . . We Bushmen have a wire here’ – he tapped his chest– ‘that brings us news.’ He was comparing their method of communication with thewhite man’s telegram or ‘wire’. Sure enough, when they approached the camp, thepeople were singing the ‘Eland Song’ and preparing to give the hunters thegreatterite manest of welcomes.25[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1344861]In most, if not all, traditional societies, telepathy seems to be taken forgranted and put to practical use. Many travellers in Africa reported that peopleseem to know when others to whom they were attached were coming home. The sameoccurred in rural Norway, where there is a special word for the anticipation ofarrivals: vardøger. Typically, someone at home heard a person approaching thehouse and coming in, yet nobody physically did so. Soon afterwards the personactually arrived. Similarly, the ‘second sight’ of some inhabitants of theScottish Highlands included visions of arrivals before the person in the visionappeared.Unfortunately, most anthropologists who have lived with traditional peoples havenot studied these aspects of their behaviour, or at least they have not reportedthem. Materialist taboos have inhibited their spirit of enquiry. As a result,very little is known about the natural history of telepathy and other psychicphenomena in other cultures.In an attempt to find out more about telepathy in modern societies, I launched aseries of appeals for information through the media in Europe, North America andAustralia. Over a period of fifteen years, I built up a database of humanexperiences, similar to my database on unexplained powers of animals, with morethan four thousand case histories, classified into more than sixty categories.Many cases of apparent telepathy occurred in response to other people’s needs.For example, hundreds of mothers told me that when they were stillbreastfeeding, they knew when their baby needed them, even from miles away. Theyfelt their milk let down. (The milk let-down reflex is mediated by the hormoneoxytocin, sometimes called the love hormone, and is normally triggered byhearing the baby cry. The nipples start leaking milk and many women feel atingling sensation in their breasts.) When mothers who were away from theirbabies felt their milk let down, most of them took it for granted that theirbaby needed them. They were usually right. They did not experience their milkletting down because they started thinking about the baby; they started thinkingabout their baby because their milk let down for no apparent reason. Theirresponse was physiological.With the help of a midwife, I carried out a study of nine nursing mothers inNorth London over a two-month period. While the mothers were away from theirbabies, all the times at which their milk let down were recorded; meanwhile thebaby-sitters noted when the babies showed signs of distress. After eliminatingevents that could have been due to synchronised rhythms in mother and baby atregular feeding times, most of the unexpected milk let-downs did indeed coincidewith the babies’ distress. The statistical odds against their occurring bychance were a billion to one. In other words, it was highly unlikely that themothers’ responses were random coincidences.A telepathic connection between mothers and their babies makes good sense inevolutionary terms. Mothers who could tell at a distance when their babiesneeded them would tend to have babies that survived better than the babies ofinsensitive mothers.Telepathic connections between motherbetions and their children often seem tocontinue even when the children have grown up. Many stories on my databaseconcern mothers who went to or telephoned their children when they could nothave known by any conventional means that they were in distress.Until the invention of modern telecommunications, telepathy was the only way inwhich people could be in touch at a distance instantly. In most respectstelepathy has now been superseded by the telephone – but it has not gone away.Telepathy now occurs most commonly in connection with telephone calls.Telephone telepathy"},{"pageContent":" The commonest kind of story about apparent telepathy concerned telephone calls.Hundreds of people told me that they had thought of someone for no apparentreason, and then that person rang in a way that seemed uncanny. Or they knew whowas calling when the phone rang before they looked at a caller ID display oranswered. I followed up these stories with a series of surveys in Europe and inNorth and South America. On average, 92 per cent of the respondents said theyhad thought of someone as the telephone rang, or just before, in a way thatseemed telepathic.26[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1345487]When I talked to friends and colleagues about this phenomenon, most agreed itseems to happen. Some people simply accepted that it was telepathic orintuitive; others tried to explain it ‘normally’. Almost everyone came up withone or both of these two arguments. First, they said, you think about otherpeople frequently; then sometimes, by chance, somebody rings while you arethinking about them; you imagine it is telepathy, but you forget the thousandsof times you were wrong. The second argument was that when you know someonewell, your familiarity with his routines and activities enables you to know whenhe is likely to ring, even though this knowledge may be unconscious.I searched the scientific literature to find out if these standard argumentswere supported by any data or observations. I could find no research whatever onthe subject. The standard sceptical arguments were evidence-free speculations.In science it is not enough to put forward a hypothesis: it needs to be tested.I designed a simple procedure to test both the chance-coincidence theory and theunconscious-knowledge theory experimentally. I recruited subjects who said theyquite frequently knew who was calling before answering the phone. I asked themfor the names and telephone numbers of four people they knew well, friends orfamily members. The subjects were then filmed continuously throughout the periodof the experiment alone in a room with a landline telephone, without a caller IDsystem. If there was a computer in the room, it was switched off, and thesubjects had no mobile phone. My research assistant or I selected one of thefour callers at random by the throw of a die. We rang up the selected person andasked him to phone the subject in the next couple of minutes. He did so. Thesubject’s phone rang, and before answering it she had to say to the camera who,out of the four possible callers, she felt was on the line. She could not haveknown through knowledge of the caller’s habits and daily routines because, inthis experiment, the callers rang at times randomly selected by theexperimenter.t>By guessing at random, subjects would have been right about one time in four,or 25 per cent. In fact, the average hit rate was 45 per cent, verysignificantly above the chance level. None of the subjects was right every time,but they were right much more than they should have been if the chancecoincidence theory were true. This above-chance effect has been replicatedindependently in telephone telepathy tests at the universities of Freiburg,Germany, and Amsterdam, Holland.27[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1346403]In some of our tests, there were two familiar callers and two unfamiliar callerswhom the subjects had never met but whose names they knew. The hit rate withunfamiliar callers was near the chance level; with the familiar callers it was52 per cent, about twice the chance level. This experiment supported the ideathat telepathy occurs more between people who are bonded to each other thanbetween strangers.For some of our experiments we recruited young Australians, New Zealanders andSouth Africans living in London. Some of their callers were back home, thousandsof miles away, and the others were new acquaintances in England. In these tests,the hit rates were higher with their nearest and dearest far away than withpeople in Britain they had met only recently, showing that emotional closenessis more important than physical proximity.28[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1347090]Other researchers have also found that telepathy does not seem to bedistance-dependent.29[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1347519] At first sightthis seems surprising, because most physical influences, like gravitation andlight, fall off with distance. But the physical phenomenon most analogous totelepathy is quantum entanglement, also known as quantum non-locality, whichdoes not fall off with distance.30[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1347935] When twoquantum particles have been part of the same system and move apart, they remaininterconnected or entangled in such a way that a change in one is associatedwith an immediate change in the other. Albert Einstein famously described thiseffect as ‘spooky action at a distance’.31[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1348346]Telepathy has continued to evolve along with modern technologies. Many peoplesay they have the experience of thinking of someone who then emails them, orsends them a text message. Experiments with emails and text messages usingsimilar methods to the telephone tests have also given positive, highlysignificant results.32[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1348782] As intelephone tests, the effect occurred more with familiar people and it didple\"fil not fall off with distance. The same was true of automated telepathy testson the Internet.33[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1349530]I do not know to what extent people can learn to be more sensitivetelepathically, but several automated tests are now available, including a testthat runs on mobile phones, enabling those who are interested to find out forthemselves.34 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1350113]Telepathy involves picking up feelings, needs or thoughts at a distance, acrossspace. Some other phenomena are also spatial, like the sense of being stared atand remote viewing. By contrast, premonitions, precognition and presentimentsare related to future events, and imply links across time from the future to thepresent.Animal premonitions of disasters Premonition means warning in advance; precognition means knowing in advance; andpresentiment means feeling in advance.There are many examples of animals seeming to feel when a disaster is about tostrike. Ever since classical times, people have reported unusual animalbehaviour before earthquakes, and I have collected a large body of evidence forunusual animal behaviour before recent earthquakes, including the 1987 and 1994earthquakes in California; 1995 in Kobe, Japan; 1997 near Assisi, Italy; 1999 inIzmit, Turkey; and 2001 near Seattle, Washington. In all these cases there weremany reports of wild and domesticated animals behaving in fearful, anxious orunusual ways several hours or even days before the earthquakes. Dogs werehowling for hours beforehand, and many cats and birds were behaving unusually.35[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1350440]One of the very few systematic observations of animal behaviour before, duringand after an earthquake concerns toads in Italy. A British biologist, RachelGrant, was carrying out a study of mating behaviour in toads for her PhD projectat San Ruffino Lake in central Italy in the spring of 2009. To her surprise,soon after the beginning of the mating season in late March, the number of maletoads in the breeding group suddenly fell. From more than ninety being active on30 March, there were almost none on 31 March and in early April. As Grant andher colleague Tim Halliday observed, ‘This is highly unusual behaviour fortoads; once toads have appeared to breed, they usually remain active in largenumbers at the breeding site until spawning has finished.’ On 6 April, Italy wasshaken by a 6.4-magnitude earthquake, followed by a series of aftershocks. Thetoads did not resume their normal breeding behaviour for another ten days, twodays after the last aftershock. Grant and Halliday looked in detail at theweather records for this period but found nothing unusual. They were forced tothe conclusion that the toads were somehow detecting the impending earthquakesome six days in advance.36[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1350988]No one knows how some animals sense when earthquakes are imminent. Perhaps theypick up subtle sounds or vibrations in the earth. But if animals can predictearthquake-related disasters by sensing slight tremors, why can’t seismologistsdo so? Or maybe they respond to subterranean gases released prior toearthquakes, or react to changes in the earth’s electrical field. But they mayalso sense in advance what is about to happen in a way that lies beyond currentscientific understanding, through some kind of presentiment.Similarly, many animals seemed to anticipate the great Asian tsunami on 26December 2004, although their reactions were much closer to the actual event.Elephants in Sri Lanka and Sumatra moved to high ground before the giant wavesstruck; they did the same in Thailand, trumpeting beforehand. According tovillagers in Bang Koey, Thailand, a herd of buffalo were grazing by the beachwhen they ‘suddenly lifted their heads and looked out to sea, ears standingupright’. They turned and stampeded up the hill, followed by bewilderedvillagers, whose lives were thereby saved. At Ao Sane beach, near Phuket, dogsran up to the hill tops, and at Galle in Sri Lanka, dog owners were puzzled whentheir animals refused to go for their usual morning walk on the beach. InCuddalore District in south India, buffaloes, goats and dogs escaped by movingto higher ground, and so did a nesting colony of flamingos. In the AndamanIslands, ‘stone age’ tribal groups moved away from the coast before thedisaster, alerted by the behaviour of animals.37[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1351412]How did they know? The usual speculation is that the animals picked up tremorscaused by the under-sea earthquake. But this explanation is unconvincing. Therewould have been tremors all over South East Asia, not just in the afflictedcoastal areas.Some animals anticipate other kinds of natural disaster like avalanches,38[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1351828] and evenman-made catastrophes. During the Second World War, many families in Britain andGermany relied on their pets’ behaviour to warn them of impending air raidsbefore official warnings were given. The animal reactions occurred when enemyplanes were still hundreds of miles away, long before the animals could haveheard them coming. Some dogs in London anticipated the explosion of German V-2rockets. These missiles were supersonic and could not have been heard inadvance.39 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1352244]With very few exceptions, the ability of animals to anticipate disasters hasbeen ignored by Western scientists; the subject is taboo. By contrast, since the1970s, in earthquake-prone areas of China, the authorities have encouragedpeople to report unusual animal behaviour, and Chinese scientists have animpressive track record in predicting earthquakes. In several cases they haveissued warnings that enabled cities to be evacuated hours before devastatingearthquakes struck, saving tens of thousands of lives.40[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1352660]By paying attention to unusual animal behaviour, as the Chinese do, earthquakeand tsunami warning systems might be feasible in parts of the world that are atrisk from these disasters. Millions of people could be asked to take part inthis project through the media. They could be told what kinds of behaviour theirpets and other animals might show if a disaster were imminent – in general,signs of anxiety or fear. If people noticed these signs, or any other unusualbehaviour, they would immediately telephone a hotline with a memorable number –for example, in California, 1-800-PET QUAKE. Or they could send a message on theInternet.A computer system would analyse the places of origin of the incoming messages.If there was an unusually large number, it would signal an alarm, and display ona map the places from which the calls were coming. There would probably be abackground of false alarms from people whose pets were sick, for example, andthere might also be scattered hoax calls. But if there was a sudden surge ofcalls from a particular region, this could indicate that an earthquake ortsunami was imminent.Exploring the potential for animal-based warning systems would cost relativelylittle. From a practical point of view, it does not matter how animals know:they can give useful warnings whatever the explanation. If it turns out thatthey are indeed reacting to subtle physical changes, then seismologists shouldbe able to use instruments to make better predictions themselves. If it turnsout that presentiment plays a part, we will learn something important about thenature of time and causation. By ignoring animal premonitions, or by explainingthem away, we will learn nothing.Human premonitions and precognitions Sixteen-year-old Carole Davies was about to leave a games arcade in London withsome friends when it began to rain heavily. The entrance became crowded aspeople came in from the street to shelter. Carole said: > While standing there looking out into the night, I had a sense of danger. Then> I saw what looked like a picture in front of me showing people on the floor> and with tiles and metal girders on them. I looked round and up and realised> this was to happen here. I began to shout at people to get out. No one> listened. I ran through the rain, with my friends following, to a nearby café.> After a while we heard sirens that stopped outside the arcade building. We all> ran down the road to find out what had happened. It was just as I had seen. A> man I had shouted at was being pulled from under the debris. During wars, people tend to be more alert to danger, and indeed there is moredanger. For example, Charles Bernuth, serving in the US Seventh Army in theSecond World War, took part in the invasion of Germany. Soon after crossing theRhine, he was driving along an autobahn at night with two fellow officers: > All of a sudden, I got the still small voice. Something was wrong with the> road. I just knew it. I stopped, amid the groans and jeers of the other two. I> started walking along the road. About fifty yards from where I had left the> jeep, I found out what was wrong. We were about to go over a bridge – only the> bridge wasn’t there. It had been blown up and there was a sheer drop of about> seventy-five feet. People who had these premonitions survived because they heeded the sense ofdanger.On my database there are 842 cases of human premonitions, precognitions, orpresentiments. Of these, 70 per cent are about dangers, disasters, or deaths; 25per cent are about neutral events; and only five per cent are of happy events,like meeting a future spouse, or winning a raffle. Dangers, deaths andcatastrophes predominate. This agrees with a survey of well-authenticated casesof precognition collected by the Society for Psychical Research in which 60 percent concerned deaths or accidents. Very few were of happy events. Most of theothers were trivial or neutral, although some were very unusual.41[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1353208] In one suchcase, the wife of the Bishop of Hereford dreamed that she was reading themorning prayers in the hall of the Bishop’s Palace. After doing so, on enteringthe dining room, she saw an enormous pig standing beside the table. This dreamamused her, and she hedreamed told it to her children and their governess. Shethen went into the dining room and an escaped pig was standing in the exact spotwhere she had seen it in her dream.42[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1353623]Many precognitions occur in dreams, although often only the most dramatic orbizarre are remembered. In the early twentieth century, a British aeronauticalengineer, J. W. Dunne, made an astonishing discovery, summarised in hisremarkable book An Experiment With Time.43[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1353901] He found heoften dreamed about events that were about to happen, but usually forgot thesedreams. Only by keeping careful records of his dreams, writing them down as soonas he awoke, did the phenomenon become clear. He also found that he sometimeshad experiences that seemed familiar – sometimes called déjà vu, French for‘already seen’ – and by looking back over his records found that theycorresponded to recent dreams he had forgotten.Subsequent studies have confirmed Dunne’s observations. Parapsychologists havealso found statistical evidence for precognition in laboratory tests. Althoughthe effects in these very artificial experiments were usually small, takentogether they were very significant statistically.44[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1354312]Presentiments A presentiment is a feeling that something is about to happen, but without anyconscious awareness of what it is. Some of the most innovative research inmodern parapsychology has shown that presentiments can be detectedphysiologically.In the mid-1990s, in the United States, Dean Radin and his colleagues devised anexperiment to test for presentiment in which a subject’s emotional arousal wasmonitored automatically by measuring changes in skin resistance with electrodesattached to the fingers, as in a lie-detector test. As people’s emotional stateschange, so does the activity of the sweat glands, resulting in changes inelectrodermal activity, registered in a computerised recording device.In the laboratory it is relatively easy to produce measurable emotional changesin subjects by exposing them to noxious smells, mild electric shocks, emotivewords, or provocative photographs. Radin’s experiments used photographs. Mostwere pictures of emotionally calm subjects like landscapes, but some wereshocking, like pictures of corpses that had been cut open for autopsies; otherswere pornographic. A large pool of these ‘calm’ and ‘emotional’ images wasstored within the computer.In Radin’s experiments, when calmntsal’ pictures appeared on the screen, thesubjects remained calm, and when emotional images were displayed, they wereemotionally aroused, as shown by an increase in electrodermal activity. This isnot surprising. But when emotional images were about to appear, the increase inelectrodermal activity began before the picture appeared on the screen, three orfour seconds in advance. The picture that appeared on the screen was selected atrandom by the computer only a millisecond in advance. No one, not even theexperimenter, knew what it would be when the subjects began to react.45[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1354723] Otherresearchers have found similar results.46[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1355270]One of the most interesting findings of precognition and presentiment researchis that people seem to be influenced by themselves in the future, rather than byobjective events. Precognitions are like memories of the future. Presentimentsseem to involve a physiological back-flowing from future states of alarm orarousal, a flow of causation moving in the opposite direction to energeticcausation. This is in agreement with the way that attractors pull organismstowards their inherited or learned goals, with flows of influence from virtualfutures through the present towards the past (see Chapter 5). It also agreeswith Alfred NorthWhitehead’s idea of minds working from the future (see Chapter4).What skeptics say ‘Organized skeptics’ in Britain use the American spelling, with a ‘k’, ratherthan the usual English spelling, with a ‘c’.Informed skeptics do not deny that there is a lot of experimental evidence thatsuggests psychic phenomena are real, but they point out that no experiment isperfect, the evidence is not 100 per cent positive, and that for such anunlikely proposition, vastly more evidence is needed than in more orthodoxscience.47 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1355989]Skeptics feel free to move the scientific goalposts as far as they like. Thereis not enough evidence yet, they say, and for some skeptics there never willbe.48 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1356818]Skeptical organisations are the principal defenders of the belief that thepsychic phenomena are illusory: they seek to debunk or deny any evidence thatsuggests they might be wrong. The best established of these groups is the USCommittee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), which usCSIspaed to be called CSICOP(pronounced sigh-cop), the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claimsof the Paranormal. CSI’s publication, The Skeptical Inquirer, has a circulationof about 50,000. Members of skeptical organisations often think of themselves aslonely defenders of science and reason against the forces of superstition andcredulity; they see their debunking activities as ‘battles’ against theinsidious forces of irrationalism. Their opponents see them as self-appointedvigilantes.49 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1357716]These effects of these well-organised and well-funded skeptical campaigns arenot simply intellectual, but political and economic. Through maintaining thetaboo against the ‘paranormal’, they ensure that most universities avoid thiscontroversial area altogether, despite great public interest in the subject.Their main emphasis is on counteracting ‘claims of the paranormal’ in theserious media, either by attacking journalists or publications that report anypositive evidence or by insisting that a skeptic is given the opportunity todeny that the evidence has any scientific validity.50[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1358280]I have had many encounters with skeptics, described in detail elsewhere.51[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1358634] In almostevery case, they were not only ignorant of the evidence, but uninterested in it.Here are three examples.In 2004, I took part in a debate on telepathy with Lewis Wolpert at the RoyalSociety of Arts in London, with an eminent lawyer in the chair. Wolpert was aprofessor of biology at University College, London, and a former chairman of theBritish Committee on the Public Understanding of Science. For years he had beena faithful standby for journalists as a denouncer of the paranormal, alwaysready to provide a sceptical comment. We were each given thirty minutes topresent our cases. Wolpert spoke first. He said that research on telepathy was‘pathological science’, but after saying, ‘The whole issue is about evidence,’he presented none. He simply stated, ‘There is zero evidence to support the ideathat thoughts can be transmitted from a person to an animal, from an animal to aperson, from a person to a person, or from an animal to an animal.’ He used uponly half his allotted time.I summarised evidence for telepathy from thousands of scientific trials andshowed a video of recent experiments. Wolpert was sitting on the stage in frontof the screen, staring ahead, tapping a pencil on the table, sighing as ifbored. He did not turn around to see the evidence behind him. According to areport on the debate in Nature, ‘few members of the audience seemed to be swayedby his [Wolpert’s] arguments . . . Many in the audience variously accusedWolpert of “not knowing the evidencng w me” and being “unscientific”.’52[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1359133] For anyone whowants to hear both sides for themselves, the debate is online in streamingaudio.53 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1359548]Second, I was invited to speak at the 12th European Skeptics Congress inBrussels, Belgium, in 2005. I took part in a debate on telepathy with JanNienhuys, the secretary of a Dutch skeptical organisation, Stichting Skepsis. Ipresented evidence for telepathy, reviewing research by others and by myself.Nienhuys responded by arguing that telepathy was impossible on theoreticalgrounds and therefore all the evidence was flawed. He said that the morestatistically significant my experimental results were, the greater the errorsmust be. I asked him to specify these errors, but he could not. He admitted hehad not actually read my papers or looked at the evidence. In an account of thedebate, an independent observer, Richard Hardwick, a scientist at the EuropeanCommission, wrote, ‘It seems Dr Nienhuys had not done his homework. He did nothave any data or analyses to hand, and his attack fizzled out.’54[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1359884]In 2006, the British TV company Channel 4 broadcast a two-part diatribe byRichard Dawkins against religion, called The Root of All Evil? Soon afterwards,the same production company, IWC Media, told me that Dawkins wanted to visit meto discuss my research on unexplained abilities of people and animals for a newTV series. I was reluctant to take part because I expected that it would be asone-sided as Dawkins’s previous series. But the company’s representative,Rebecca Frankel, assured me that they were now more open-minded. She told me,‘We are very keen for it to be a discussion between two scientists, aboutscientific modes of enquiry.’ On the understanding that Dawkins was interestedin discussing evidence, and with the written assurance that the material wouldbe edited fairly, I agreed to meet him and we fixed a date. I was still not surewhat to expect. Was he going to be dogmatic, with a mental firewall that blockedout any evidence that went against his beliefs? Or would he be fun to talk to? Dawkins duly came to call. The director, Russell Barnes, asked us to standfacing each other; we were filmed with a hand-held camera. Dawkins began bysaying that he thought we probably agreed about many things, ‘But what worriesme about you is that you are prepared to believe almost anything. Science shouldbe based on the minimum number of beliefs.’I agreed that we had a lot in common, ‘But what worries me about you is that youcome across as dogmatic, giving people a bad impression of science, and puttingthem off.’Dawkins then said that in a romantic spirit he himself would like to believe intelepathy, but there just wasn’t any evidence for it. He dismissed all researchon the subject out of hand, without going into any details. He said that if itreally occurred, it would ‘turn the laws of physics upside down’, and added,‘Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.’‘This depends on what you regard as extraordinary’, I replied. ‘Most people saythey have experienced telepathy, especially in connection with telephone calls.In that sense, telepathy is ordinary. The claim that most people are deludedabout their own experience is extraordinary. Where is the extraordinary evidencefor that?’ He could not produce any evidence at all, apart from genericarguments about the fallibility of human judgement. He took it for granted thatpeople want to believe in ‘the paranormal’ because of wishful thinking.We then agreed that controlled experiments were necessary. I said that this waswhy I had actually been doing such experiments, including tests to find out ifpeople really could tell who was calling them on the telephone when the callerwas selected at random. The previous week, I had sent Dawkins copies of some ofmy papers in scientific journals so that he could examine the data before wemet. I suggested that we actually discuss the evidence. He looked uneasy andsaid, ‘I don’t want to discuss evidence.’‘Why not?’ I asked.He replied, ‘There isn’t time. It’s too complicated. And that’s not what thisprogramme is about.’ The camera stopped.The director confirmed that he, too, was not interested in evidence. The film hewas making was another Dawkins polemic against irrational beliefs. I said, ‘Ifyou’re treating telepathy as an irrational belief, surely evidence about whetherit exists or not is essential for the discussion. If telepathy occurs, it’s notirrational to believe in it. I thought that’s what we were going to talk about.I made it clear from the outset that I wasn’t interested in taking part inanother low-grade debunking exercise.’Dawkins replied, ‘It’s not a low-grade debunking exercise; it’s a high-gradedebunking exercise.’ I said I had been assured that this was to be a balanced scientific discussionabout evidence. Russell Barnes asked to see the emails I had received from hisassistant. He read them with obvious dismay, and said the assurances she hadgiven me were wrong. In that case, I said, they were visiting me under falsepretences. The team packed up and left. The series, broadcast in 2007, wascalled Enemies of Reason.Richard Dawkins has long proclaimed, ‘The paranormal is bunk. Those who try tosell it to us are fakes and charlatans.’ Enemies of Reason was intended topopularise this belief. But does his crusade really promote the PublicUnderstanding of Science, of which he was professor at Oxford? Should scie ce=\"Mince be a fundamentalist belief-system? Or should it be based onopen-minded enquiry into the unknown? In no other field of scientific endeavour do otherwise intelligent people feelfree to make public claims based on prejudice and ignorance. No one woulddenounce research in physical chemistry, say, while knowing nothing about thesubject. Yet in relation to psychic phenomena, committed materialists feel freeto disregard the evidence and behave irrationally and unscientifically whileclaiming to speak in the name of science and reason. They abuse the authority ofscience and bring rationalism into disrepute.What difference does it make? Dropping the taboo against psychic phenomena would have a liberating effect onscience. Scientists would no longer feel the need to pretend these phenomena areimpossible. The word ‘skepticism’ would be liberated from its association withdogmatic denial. People would feel free to talk openly about their ownexperiences. Open-minded research would be able to take place withinuniversities and scientific institutions, and some of this research could beapplied in useful ways, for example in the development of animal-based warningsystems for earthquakes and tsunamis. Public funding for psychic research andparapsychology could reflect the widespread interest in these areas of research,and increase public interest in science. The educational system would be free toteach students about psychic research instead of ignoring or dismissing it.Anthropologists would be liberated from the taboo that stops them studyingpsychic skills that may be better developed in traditional societies than in ourown. Above all, research on these phenomena would contribute to a larger andmore inclusive understanding of the nature of minds, social bonds, time andcausation.Questions for materialists If you think telepathy and precognition are theoretically impossible, or veryimprobable, can you explain why? Have you ever looked at the evidence for psychic phenomena? If so, can yousummarise it, and explain what is wrong with it? Have you yourself ever had a seemingly telepathic experience? What might persuade you to change your mind?Summary Most people claim to have had telepathic experiences. Numerous statisticalexperiments have shown that information can be transmitted from person to personin a way that cannot be explained in terms of the normal senses. Telepathytypically happens between people who are closely bonded, like mothers andchildren, spouses and close friends. Many nursing mothers seem to be able todetect when their babies are in distress when they are miles away. The commonestkind of telepathy in the modern world occurs in connection with telephone callswhen people think of someone who then rings, or just know who’st kies calling.Numerous experimental tests have shown that this is a real phenomenon. It doesnot fall off with distance. Social animals seem to be able to keep in touch withmembers of their group at a distance telepathically, and domesticated animals,like dogs, cats, horses and parrots, often pick up their owners’ emotions andintentions at a distance, as shown in experiments with dogs and parrots. Otherpsychic abilities include premonitions and precognitions, as shown by animals’anticipation of earthquakes, tsunamis and other disasters. Human premonitionsusually occur in dreams or through intuitions. In experimental research on humanpresentiments, future emotional events seem able to work ‘backwards’ in time toproduce detectable physiological effects.10 Is Mechanistic Medicine the Only Kind that Really Works? Modern medicine is amazingly successful. Its achievements would have seemedmiraculous a hundred years ago. Heart transplants, keyhole surgery, hipreplacements and in-vitro fertilisation are just a few of the interventions thathave changed millions of people’s lives. Together with immunisation programmesand advances in public health, ‘miracle drugs’, like antibiotics, have affectedall humanity, reducing infant mortality and increasing life expectancy almosteverywhere.There is no doubt that modern medicine works very well. Yet it has importantlimitations that are becoming increasingly apparent. The great advances ofmedicine over the last century are running out of steam. The rate of discoveryis slowing, despite ever-increasing investment in research. There is a dearth ofnew drugs, and medicine is becoming prohibitively expensive.The mechanistic approach is at its best when dealing with mechanical aspects ofthe body, like defective joints, decayed teeth, faulty heart valves and blockedarteries, or infections curable with antibiotics. But it suffers from tunnelvision: all living organisms, including people, are physico-chemical machines,or ‘lumbering robots’. Hence a materialist medical system confines its attentionto the physical and chemical aspects of human beings, treating them throughsurgery and drugs, while ignoring anything that does not fit in.Doctors are often intensely annoyed by the existence of rival medical systems,including homeopathy, chiropractic and traditional Chinese medicine, all ofwhich claim to be able to heal the sick. From the point of view of a committedmaterialist, none of these other systems can really work. Either the patientswould have got better anyway, or else the benefits of alternative andcomplementary therapies are simply a product of the placebo effect.The belief that only mechanistic medicine is truly effective has enormouspolitical and economic consequences. In most countries, government funding formedical research, totalling many billions of dollars, is exclusively confined tomechanistic medicine. Most national health services and medical insurancecompanies are equally mechanistic in their approach.In this chapter I discuss the strengths and limitations of mechanistic medicine.Its strengths depent> inclusive approach to health and healing.I adopt a historical approach because I believe it offers the best way ofunderstanding our present situation. It is particularly important in revealingwhich aspects of medicine depend on the materialist worldview, and which resultfrom pragmatic discoveries that are not dependent on any particular philosophyof nature.Natural capacities to heal and resist disease In order to see any medical system in perspective, it is important to rememberthat animals and plants have been regenerating after damage, healing themselvesand defending themselves against infections throughout the entire history oflife on earth. All of us are descended from animal and human forebears thatsurvived and reproduced for hundreds of millions of years before the advent ofdoctors. We would not be here if it were not for our ancestors’ innatecapacities to heal and resist diseases. Medicine can help and enhance thesecapacities, but it builds on foundations that have evolved over vast aeons oftime, continually subject to natural selection.The ability to heal after wounding and to regenerate after damage is common toalmost all forms of life. If plants are injured or attacked by diseases, theyoften seal off the wounded area and compensate by growing new tissues. Smallparts of plants can regenerate into entire new organisms: cuttings taken from awillow tree can grow into new willow trees. Similarly, many animals haveastonishing powers of regeneration. A flatworm can be cut into small pieces, andeach can grow into a whole new worm. The leg can be cut off a newt and it willgrow a new leg; the lens can be removed from its eye and it will form a new lensfrom the edge of its iris.1[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1360618] Even inhumans, the skin regenerates after wounding, so does the liver, and theintestinal lining and blood cells are continually replaced (see Chapter 5).Many organisms have the power to resist diseases through an immune response. Inbacteria, enzyme systems attack invading viruses; in plants, immune systemsrecognise and respond to pathogens by producing chemicals that kill them orinhibit their growth.2[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1361175] Likewise, ininvertebrate animals, such as insects, immune systems attack and destroyinvading organisms. The immune systems in vertebrates go further and rememberspecific pathogens, mounting a stronger attack the next time they encounter theinvading organism.People have known for a long time that exposure to a disesurer the iase canconfer immunity later to the same disease. In his description of the plague inAthens in 430 bc, the classical Greek historian Thucydides was the first to notethat people who had recovered from the plague were able to nurse the sickwithout catching it.3[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1361602] Building onobservations like this, at least six hundred years ago, some Arabs and Chinesewere inoculating people with material taken from the pustules of otherssuffering from a mild form of smallpox. As a result, most of those who wereinoculated contracted a mild form of the disease and survived unscathed whenexposed to the disease again.4[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1362020]In 1718, the wife of the British ambassador in Istanbul, Lady Mary WortleyMontagu, inoculated her own children in this way. She had lost her brother tosmallpox, and the disease had marred her own beauty a few years earlier, so shetook a keen interest in this procedure when she learned about it from Turkishwomen. On her return to England she promoted the method enthusiastically.Several members of the Royal Family were inoculated, and the practice becamewidespread, although about three per cent of those who were inoculated died ofthe disease.In the 1790s, Edward Jenner, an English physician, modified the technique ofimmunisation in the light of the observation that dairymaids did not catchsmallpox after they had been infected with cowpox, a much milder disease. Jennerdeveloped the technique of vaccination (from the Latin vacca, cow) by takingfluid from pustules on infected dairymaids and deliberately infected childrenthrough a small wound in the skin. In 1853 a law required universal vaccinationagainst smallpox in England and Wales, and vaccinations and inoculations forother diseases were developed and widely applied in the twentieth century, longbefore the immune system was described in cellular and molecular detail.The World Health Organisation declared in 1979 that smallpox had been eradicatedentirely.Hygiene and public health In the early nineteenth century, a number of epidemiologists and clinicians cameto the conclusion that diseases like puerperal fever and cholera were spreadthrough microscopic germs and could be counteracted by improvements in hygieneand sanitation. Louis Pasteur’s discovery of specific germs in the 1860sainiiene and the subsequent development of the germ theory of disease underlay aseries of preventive measures and public-health policies that resulted in adramatic decline in deaths from epidemics.The improvements in public health through the prevention of infectious diseaseswere triumphs of scientific research, water and sewage engineering, publicpolicy initiatives and health education. Neither the discovery of germs as theinfectious agents of disease nor the building up of immunity through vaccinationdepended on any particular dogma. None of the advances was specificallydependent on the mechanistic theory of life or the materialist worldview.Much of the success of medicine in the twentieth century was due to theprevention of diseases through immunisation and improved hygiene. As thesepreventive measures were spread worldwide, there was a global reduction ininfant and child mortality and there were far fewer epidemics. One result was adramatic increase in the world’s population from 1 billion in 1800, to 3 billionin 1960, and 7 billion in 2012.Cures for infections One of the most iconic discoveries of twentieth-century medicine was penicillin,found by accident by a microbiologist, Alexander Fleming, in 1928. When he wasculturing bacteria in Petri dishes, one of the dishes was contaminated with amould, Penicillium notatum. Fleming noticed that all around the mould thebacteria were dying. He found that juice extracted from the mould, which hecalled penicillin, could inhibit the growth of a wide range of other bacteria.But he assumed that penicillin would be too toxic to be of any medical use, andhe did not pursue it.Fleming’s work was rediscovered ten years later by Howard Florey and Ernst Chainin Oxford, and it was not until 1941 that its full potential became apparent. Itwas a wonder drug that rapidly produced spectacular effects. Not only did itcure acute potentially lethal infections like septicaemia, pneumonia andmeningitis, but also chronic infections of sinuses, joints and bones. With theother antibiotics that followed in its wake, it transformed both the public anddoctors’ perception of what medicine could do.5[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1362304] Yet scientistsdid not invent Penicillium notatum and other organisms produced them for theirown purposes. Antibiotics were a gift of nature.Together with improvements in hygiene and programmes of mass immunisation, thediscovery of antibiotics meant that the death rate from infectious diseasesplummeted. Dreaded diseases like cholera, typhoid, tuberculosis and polio nolonger killed people by the million. These staggering advances changed the veryconditions of human life.In the late twentieth century, the power of antibiotics was extended yet furtherby the surprising discovery that stomach ulcers, previously thought to be causedby excess acidity in the stomach or by stress, were in fact the result ofinfection with a hitherto unknown bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, and could becured with antibiotics.6[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1362723]The young were the major beneficiaries of the control of infectious diseaseswith immunisation and antibiotics. Infant and child mortality, once common, arenow rare. Today the most serious medical problems among young people areinherited diseases, like cystic fibrosis, allergies, like asthma, or accidents.The main challenges that now face medicine are the diseases of old age,including cancer and diseases of the circulatory system, as well as chronic‘degenerative’ diseases, like arthritis and dementia. On the whole, most adultsare remarkably healthy until their fifties or sixties. Nevertheless, there arestill several major diseases that afflict the middle-aged, including diabetes,rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia.The causes of most of these diseases are unknown.7[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1363007]Meanwhile, the germs that cause infectious diseases continue to evolve. Theappearance of new diseases like AIDS and the evolution of bacteria resistant toantibiotics still pose major problems.New drugs Throughout human history, people all over the world have used plants in herbalremedies, but it was not until the nineteenth century that chemists began toisolate ‘active principles’ from medicinal plants: morphine from opium poppies,cocaine from coca leaves, nicotine from tobacco, quinine from cinchona,salicylic acid from willow bark, and a host of other pharmacologically activecompounds.8 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1363555]These purified drugs were more reliable and predictable in their effects thanvariable herbal materials. And once the pure drugs had been chemicallyidentified, they could also be modified chemically to produce new substancesthat were more powerful or had fewer side effects than the naturally occurringcompounds, such as acetyl salicylic acid (aspirin) from salicylic acid anddiacetyl morphine (heroin) from morphine. In some cases a range of compoundswith similar structures was created, known as analogues: for example, xylocaine,amylocaine and procaine, analogues of cocaine, widely used as localanaesthetics.The discovery of penicillin and other antibiotics took this process further, andtheir spectacular success gave a boost to the quest for new drugs. If thesenaturally occurring non-toxic chemicals could cure appalling diseases and makeall the difference between life and death, then why should not other illnessesyield to simple chemical solutions? Could chemical cures for cancer orschizophrenia be waiting to be discovered?Like the drugs derived from medicinal plants, the antibiotics were gifts ofnature, but their identification, purification and modification depended on theart of chemistry. The isolation of drugs from plants, fungi and bacteriacontinued at an increasing pace, and chemical compounds derived from naturalsources, together with synthetic variants on them, account for about 70 per centof the drugs in modern medicine.9[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1363971]The other principal method of drug discovery is by trial and error. Drugcompanies test large numbers of chemicals isolated from plants or synthesised bychemists to find out if any of them have useful effects, while beingsufficiently non-toxic. This process, called screening, is usually carried outon animals, although some tests now use animal or human cells grown in vitro,literally meaning ‘in glass’. Since the 1950s, drug companies have screened tensof thousands of compounds and have discovered several important new drugs,including taxol, isolated from the bark of Pacific yew trees, used in thetreatment of breast cancer.Medical researchers hoped for a long time that, instead of relying on trial anderror, new drugs could be designed on the basis of a rational understanding ofthe body’s physiology and molecular biology. The discovery of vitamins and theidentification of hormones like insulin were important steps in this direction,and from the 1980s onwards, there were great hopes that the understanding ofgenomes and the molecular details of cells would take ‘rational’ drug discoveryto a new level. With this aim in view, hundreds of billions of dollars have beeninvested by governments, drug companies and biotechnology firms. But the resultshave been very disappointing. The returns on investment are diminishing, anddrug companies are now facing a dearth of new drugs. At the same time, thepatents on some of the main ‘blockbuster’ drugs like Lipitor, a statin for thecontrol of cholesterol levels, and Prozac, an antidepressant, are running out,meaning a loss of many billions of dollars in annual revenues for pharmaceuticalcorporations. Many of the new drugs now in the pipeline are merely moreexpensive variants of already-existing drugs.10[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1364248]Discovering and testing new drugs is a lengthy and increasingly expensiveprocess, and drug companies try to make as much money as possible from theirdrugs while patents last. They inevitably devote enormous amounts of money toadvertising and promotion. Some companies go to great s giniolengths to maketheir drugs look safer and more effective than they really are, creating anillusion of scientific respectability for their claims. In order to bolster thedrugs’ scientific credibility, they offer large fees to scientists to put theirnames to articles that have been ghostwritten by authors paid by the drugcompany, or else the scientists are given other inducements to lend their namesto studies they have not done.11[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1364662]Medical ghostwriting takes many forms, but a recent case gives some insight intowhat is involved. In 2009, around fourteen thousand women who developed breastcancer while taking Prempro, a hormone replacement therapy (HRT), sued thedrug’s manufacturer, Wyeth. In court, it turned out that many of the medicalresearch papers supporting HRT had been ghost-written by a commercial medicalcommunications company called DesignWrite, whose website boasted that overtwelve years they had ‘planned, created and/or managed hundreds of advisoryboards, a thousand abstracts and posters, 500 clinical papers, over 10,000speakers’ bureau programmes, over 200 satellite symposia, 60 internationalprogrammes, dozens of websites, and a broad array of ancillary printed andelectronic materials’.12[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1365076] It emergedthat DesignWrite organised a ‘planned publication programme’ for Prempro,consisting of review articles, case reports, editorials and commentaries, usingthe medical literature as a marketing tool. As Ben Goldacre reported in theGuardian, > DesignWrite wrote the first drafts and sent them to Wyeth, who advised on the> creation of a second draft. Only then was the paper sent to the academic who> would appear as the ‘author’ . . . DesignWrite sold Wyeth more than 50> peer-reviewed journal articles for HRT, and a similar number of conference> posters, slide kits, symposia, and journal supplements.

They’re right: when you read an> academic paper, you trust it was written by the pettean reliarson whose name> is on it.13 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1365491] Pharmaceutical companies also have a strong influence on governments and on thepublic funding of medical research. In the United States, between 1998 and 2004,drug companies and their trade groups, the Pharmaceutical Research andManufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the Biotechnology Industry Organization,spent more than $900 million on lobbying, including donations of $90 million topolitical parties and election campaigns, mainly Republicans. They lobbied on atleast 1,600 pieces of legislation, with more than 1,200 registered lobbyists inWashington, DC.14[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1365770]In the UK, the official Medicines and Healthcare Products Agency, whichregulates the pharmaceutical industry, is funded by the pharmaceutical industryitself. The funders inevitably influence the regulator’s actions. For example,in February 2008, the Agency decided that in the light of recent evidence, a newwarning about side effects should be put on the label of statins. But nothinghappened for twenty-one months because one of the drug companies ‘was not inagreement with the wording’. As Ben Goldacre commented in the Guardian, ‘A drugcompany has been able to delay the inclusion of safety warnings on a drugprescribed to 4 million people for 21 months because it didn’t agree with thewording. There is no conceivable world in which this is a good thing.’15[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1366140]Sometimes drug companies simply ignore the regulatory process and sell drugs‘off-label’, in other words for uses that have not been approved because thedrug has not been shown to be safe, necessary and effective. A flagrant casecame to light in 2010, when the US Justice Department fined AstraZenecnedan>520million for the ‘off-label’ marketing of its blockbuster anti-psychoticSeroquel. This drug was approved only for the short-term treatment ofschizophrenia and acute bipolar disorder, but for five years AstraZeneca hadbeen aggressively marketing the drug as a long-term cure-all, promoting its usein old people’s homes, veterans’ hospitals and prisons, as well as for thetreatment of agitation and aggression in children, even though clinical studieshad shown ‘serious and debilitating side effects’, particularly among theelderly and in children.16[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1366555] The samecompany was fined $355 million in 2003 for the fraudulent selling of Zoladex, aprostate cancer treatment. Although these fines were among the largest imposedby the US Justice Department on pharmaceutical companies, critics point out thatthe fines were less than 20 per cent of the revenues from off-label marketing.By settling out of court the companies avoided criminal convictions, no one wentto jail, and the fines were treated as a cost of doing business.17[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1366967]Obviously it is in the interests of pharmaceutical companies to sell as manyexpensive drugs as possible, even though the interests of patients and those whopay for their healthcare are different. This conflict of interest needs to bemediated by governments, independent regulatory agencies, and independentresearchers. Unfortunately, the lobbying of governments, financial control ofregulatory agencies and the funding of medical researchers by the industry meansthat pharmaceutical corporations have a huge influence on the entire medicalsystem, and reinforce its reliance on drugs.Placebo responses and the power of hope How much of the success of more drugs is really due to the drugs themselves, andhow much depends on people’s beliefs and expectations?In scientific and medical research, as in everyday life, our beliefs, desiresand expectations can influence, often subconsciously, how we observe andinterpret things.18[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1367246] There isoverwhelming experimental evidence that scientists’ attitudes and expectationscan influence the outcome of experiments.19[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1367662] Inexperimental psychology and clinical research, these principles are widelyrecognised, which is why experiments in these subjects are often carried outunder ‘blind’ conditions.In medicine, patients’ expectations also influence the results, and double-blindprocedures are used to guard against the expectations of both subjects anth ce=dinvestigators. For example, in a typical double-blind clinical trial of a drug,some patients, selected at random, are given tablets of the drug being testedand others are given similar-looking placebo tablets, pharmacologically inert.The purpose of these trials is to find out if the new drug works better than theplacebo. Only if it does so can it be licensed and marketed as an effectivetreatment. Neither clinicians nor patients know who gets which. In suchexperiments, the placebo often works in a similar way to the drug being tested,although usually to a lesser extent.The largest placebo responses tend to occur in trials in which both patients andphysicians believe a powerful new treatment is being tested. The blank pillswork because the patients who take them and the doctors who administer themthink that they might contain the new wonder drug.20[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1368078] If the trialis not blind, and the patients and doctors know who has been given the real drugand who has the placebo, the placebo response is greatly reduced. Neither thepatients nor the doctors expect the placebo to have much effect, and itdoesn’t.21 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1368614]This can be a serious problem even in double-blind trials. If the real drug hasnoticeable side effects, both the patients and the doctors can find out who isreceiving the placebo and the real drug, and as a result the placebo is lesseffective, which makes the real drug more effective relative to the placebo.22[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1369026] This may seemlike a tiresome technical detail, but it has huge economic consequences.For example, in several clinical trials, the antidepressant drug Prozac hadslightly more effect than the placebo, and was licensed for use, resulting inannual revenues to the manufacturers of more than $2 billion. But was it reallybetter than a placebo? Perhaps not. Although the trials were double-blind,Prozac has some well-known side effects, such as nausea and insomnia. Bothpatients and clinicians might have realised who had received the Prozac and whothe placebo by noticing these side effects, or their absence. This is called‘breaking the blind’. Once some people realised they were receiving the realdrug and others realised they were getting the placebo, the placebo would havebecome less effective, and hence Prozac would have seemed more effective bycomparison. In a study in which doctors and patients were asked to say whetherthey had received the real drug or the placebo, 80 per cent of the patients and87 per cent of the doctors were right, as opposed to the 50 per cent that wouldbe expected by random guessing.23[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1369439]However, in several other clinical trials, Prozac was no better than theplacebo. One reason co Onidth=\"uld be that in these trials the patients had lessexperience with antidepressants and were less able to recognise the sideeffects. However, the drug company, Eli Lilly, did not publish the results ofunsuccessful trials, which were revealed only because an independently mindedresearcher, Irving Kirsch, managed to obtain the data using the US Freedom ofInformation Act. He found that when all the data were taken into account, notjust the positive results published by the manufacturers, Prozac and severalother antidepressants turned out to be no more effective than placebos, or thana herbal remedy, St John’s wort, which is far cheaper.24[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1369852] Ironically,the suppression of the data showing that Prozac was no better than a placeboprobably helped to increase its effectiveness as a prescription drug, becausedoctors and patients had more belief in it, thus enhancing the placebo response.Blind assessment first began in the late eighteenth century as a tool fordetecting fraud. Mainstream scientists and physicians invented blind methods inorder to challenge the suspected charlatanism of unconventional medicine.25[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1370131] Some of thefirst experiments of this kind were carried out to evaluate mesmerism, and wereliterally conducted with blindfolds. They took place in France at the house ofBenjamin Franklin, the American representative in Paris, who was head of acommission of enquiry appointed by King Louis XVI. Homeopaths adopted blindassessment in the mid-nineteenth century, and psychologists and psychicalresearchers took up blind methodologies before 1900 to prevent the subject’sbeliefs and expectations influencing their responses. But in regular medicine,blind methods were rarely used until the 1930s. It was only after the SecondWorld War that double-blind trials to compare drugs and placebos became astandard technique for medical researchers.Although the word ‘placebo’ usually conjures up the image of an inert sugarpill, any treatment that patients believe will make them better can evoke aplacebo response, even fake surgery. In the 1950s, many surgeons carried out anoperation to relieve angina, a severe chest pain caused by lack of blood in theheart muscle. They tied off some of the arteries that carried blood to thechest. In a placebo-controlled study, some patients received only sham surgery,in which their chests were cut open and stitched up again. Much to theirsurprise, the doctors found that the dummy operation did almost as much good asthe real one. The mere belief that they had received a proper operation relievedthe patients’ chest pain.26[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1370547]In a similar way, injecting people with saline solution often brings aboutcures, even though no drug is used. Placebo injections are especially effectivewhen people have a strong belief that injections are magically powerful, as inrural Africa and Latin America.27[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1370959] Placeboinjections also give bigger placebo responses than placebo pills in the UnitedStates, but in Europe they do not.Placebo responses depend on the meanings that people attribute to diseases andcures,28 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1371370] andthese vary from culture to culture, as the research of medical anthropologistshas shown. For example, in a comparison of clinical trials in a wide range ofcountries, Germans had the highest placebo healing rate for ulcers and thelowest for high blood pressure.29[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1371783] One possiblereason for the lower placebo response of Germans in blood-pressure trials isthat Germans are unusually concerned with the heart and its workings. Althoughthe rate of heart disease is the same in Germany, France and England, Germanstake about six times as much heart medication as their neighbours, and Germanphysicians are almost alone in prescribing medication for low blood pressure.Worries by German patients about their blood pressure getting too low may havereduced the placebo response in trials of drugs to lower blood pressure comparedwith patients in other countries without this concern.30[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1372197]For many years, most medical researchers regarded placebo responses as anannoying complication in clinical trials. They got in the way of finding outabout real cures. But attitudes are changing. The placebo response shows thatpatients’ beliefs and hopes play an important part in the healing process.At first, the defenders of mechanistic medicine dismissed the effects ofcomplementary and alternative therapies as ‘mere’ placebo effects. But placeboresponses play an important part in conventional medicine too. As Simon Singhand Edzard Ernst observed, > [T]he impact of a proven treatment is always enhanced by the placebo effect.> Not only will the treatment deliver a standard benefit, but it should also> deliver an added benefit because the patient has an expectation that the> treatment will be effective . . . The best doctors fully exploit the placebo> impact, while the worst ones add only a minimal placebo enhancement to their> treatments.31> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1372476] In 2009, placebo responses turned out to be increasing – especially in theUnited States. In clinical trials, fewer and fewer new drugs beat the placebos.In other words, more and more drugs failed in clinical trials, causing bigproblems for drug companies.Why have placebo responses increased in the Unasesing big pited States, but notelsewhere? The answer may be that drug companies are victims of their ownsuccess. In 1997, direct-to-consumer advertising for drugs was made legal in theUnited States, and as a result US citizens have been deluged with advertisementsfor prescription medicines. Many of these commercials evoke upliftingassociations between pills and peace of mind. The pharmaceutical industry’sadvertising has been all too successful in raising expectations about new drugs,increasing the placebo response in clinical trials, and hence reducing thedifference between the placebo and the drug being tested.32[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1373031]If materialism were an adequate foundation for medicine, placebo responses oughtnot to occur. The fact that they do occur shows that people’s beliefs and hopescan have positive effects on their health and healing. Conversely, despair andhopelessness can have negative effects. There is even a field of researchdevoted to this subject: psychoneuroimmunology. Stress, anxiety and depressionsuppress the activity of the immune system, and make it less able to resistdiseases and inhibit the growth of cancerous cells.33[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1373447] Hence peoplewho are anxious or depressed are more likely to fall ill or get cancer.Placebo responses show that health and sickness are not just a matter of physicsand chemistry. They also depend on hopes, meanings and beliefs. Placeboresponses are an integral part of healing.Hypnotic blisters and the removal of warts Through suggestion, one person can guide the thoughts or feelings of another.This is a normal part of everyday life. But ‘the power of suggestion’ can bringabout exceptionally striking effects through hypnosis. The nature of hypnosishas been debated for decades, but there is no doubt that it occurs, and producesvisual illusions and other subjective effects. But hypnosis can also affect thebody.When I was studying at Cambridge, one of our physiology lecturers, FergusCampbell, gave a demonstration of the powers of hypnosis using one of my fellowstudents as a subject. Campbell told the subject that he was carrying out ascientific experiment on the response of skin to heat, and would be touching thesubject’s arm with a lighted cigarette. In fact he touched it with the flat endof a pencil. Soon afterwards, the skin reddened and a blister appeared where thecool pencil had touched. I later learned that many other hypnotists had shownthe same thing, and that it had been studied, but not explained, by medicalresearchers.34 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1373982]Nerves that control small arteries in the skin mediate this burn response.People cannot will themselves to activate these nerves, which are under thecontrol of the autonomic or involuntary nervous system. Yet the hypnoticinduction of burns shows that suggestion can work through the autonomic nervoussystem. Functions that are normally involuntary are potentially subject tomental influence.35[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1374677] This sameprinciple is also demonstrated by biofeedback training. For example, in onecommon practice, people learn to increase the blood flow to their hands bypaying attention to the temperature in their fingers, which is converted to anaudio or visual display, so that they receive continuous feedback. If thetemperature is indicated by the rate at which they hear clicks, their task is tospeed up the clicks. Without knowing how, most people can soon learn to increasethe blood flow to their fingers, and hence raise their temperature. Withpractice they can do this on their own without the machine.36[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1375225]Hypnosis can also produce ‘miracle cures’, as it did in the case of a boy inLondon in the 1950s. He was born with a thick, dark skin, and as he grew, mostof his body was covered with a black, rough casing. Doctors said he had beenborn with ichthyosis, ‘fish-scale disease’. Treatment at some of London’s besthospitals did no good. Even a skin transplant from his normal chest to his handsproved worse than useless: the skin blackened and then shrank, stiffening hisfingers. Albert Mason, a young doctor interested in hypnosis, heard of the caseand, watched by a dozen sceptical colleagues, put the boy into a hypnotictrance. He told him, ‘Your left arm will clear.’ It did. About five days laterthe coarse outer layer of skin became crumbly and fell off. The skin underneathsoon became pink and soft. Through repeated hypnosis, Mason cleared other partsof the body, limb by limb.37[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1375640] In a follow-upstudy three years later, Mason and a team of dermatologists confirmed that ‘notonly has there been no relapse, but his skin has continued to improve’.38[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1376112]Mental influences are often effective in wart cures. Warts on the skin are madeup of abnormal tissues infected with viruses. Conventional doctors usually treatthem by cutting them off with knives, or burning them with electric sparks, orfreezing them with liquid nitrogen, or dissolving them with corrosive acid.These methods are crude, sometimes painful, and often ineffective: in many casesthe warts grow back, sometimes in multiple clusters. Yet ‘miracle’ cures canwork much quicker and more effectively. Some people build up reputations as‘wart healers’, and cure warts just by touching them. Others do it by applyingcurative plants. Another method is to rub the wart with a potato and then burythe potato under a particular tree at a particular phase of the moon. Somepeople get rid of their warts by selling them to a sibling. Often, within a fewdays of one of these treatments, the wart drops off, leaving clear skin. Orsometimes it gradually shrinks and disappears over a week or two.39[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1376524]The ‘magical’ methods for curing warts are many and various. They cannot havesignificant direct effects on the viruses or the abnormal tissue, but theyprovide rapid, lasting healing. All that they have in common is belief. Theperson with the wart hopes that the method will work,hodn Pro\">The and it oftendoes.40 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1377072]The effects of lifestyle, social networks and spiritual practices Everyone agrees that health is affected by people’s habits and lifestyles. Thecausative role of smoking on lung cancer provides the clearest example. Untilthe 1950s most people did not recognise that smoking had harmful effects, andthe epidemiological research that established the facts is one of the majorachievements of modern medicine. For example, a large-scale study of Britishdoctors began in 1953 by documenting their smoking habits and over thesubsequent decades recording their mortality. This was an example of whatresearchers call a prospective, as opposed to retrospective, study in whichgroups identified at the beginning of the study are tracked over time. It turnedout that those who smoked more than twenty-five cigarettes a day had atwenty-five-fold greater risk of dying from lung cancer than non-smokers.41[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1377484]Anti-smoking education, restrictions on advertising cigarettes and bans onsmoking in public places have contributed to a fall in the percentage of peoplewho smoke and to a decline in the incidence of lung cancer. In men in the UK,the incidence of lung cancer peaked in the late 1970s, and by 2011 had fallen bymore than 45 per cent. Emboldened by this success, from the 1980s onwards,health policy-makers embraced the ‘social theory’ of disease, initially inrelation to heart disease, and more recently in connection with the epidemic ofobesity and its associated health disorders. They have rightly emphasised theimportance of a healthy diet and exercise, and some people have changed theirlifestyles accordingly. Yet many have not.42[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1377898] Obviously manyfactors influence these trends, including sedentary lifestyles, junk foods andsugary drinks, and increases in obesity are now occurring in many other parts ofthe world. More than 1 billion people are now estimated to be overweight,including more than 300 million who are clinically obese. Exhortations by themedical profession and by governments have failed to reverse this trend.The social and economic aspects of medicine show that the materialist model ofpeople as machines is much too limited. People’s motivations and attitudes, theeffects of social networks and the influence of advertising aradvsoce notmeasurable physical and chemical forces: they work through minds. Many otherlines of evidence show that health is influenced by social, spiritual andemotional factors. For example, in studies in the United States, men who hadsuffered a heart attack were four times more likely to die in the next threeyears if they were socially isolated. Both men and women who had undergonecoronary operations were three times more likely to survive for five years ifthey were married or had a close friend.43[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1378274] Other studiesshowed that more people who kept pets survived after heart attacks than thosewithout, and elderly and bereaved people who kept dogs or cats had better healthand needed less medication than those who did not have animals to keep themcompany.44 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1378698]Numerous studies in the United States and elsewhere have shown that people whoare religious, especially those who regularly attend religious services, livesignificantly longer, and have better health and less depression than peoplewithout religious faith. These effects were found with Christian andnon-Christian groups.45[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1379250] Some of thebenefits may be a result of community support and other social factors, but thespiritual practices themselves may also be important.The effects of prayer or meditation on health and survival have beeninvestigated through prospective studies in which people who prayed or meditatedand otherwise similar people who did not pray or meditate were identified at thestart of the study and watched over a period of years to see if their health ormortality turned out differently. It did. On average, those who prayed ormeditated remained healthier and survived longer than those who did not.46[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1379663] For example,in a study in North Carolina, Harold Koenig and his colleagues tracked 1,793subjects who were over sixty-five years old with no physical impairments at thebeginning of the study. Six years later, those who prayed had survived 66 percent more than those who did not pray, after correcting for age differencesbetween the two groups. (Without this correction the difference was 73 percent.) They then examined the effects of ‘confounding variables’, a scientificterm for other factors that might have influenced survival, like stressful lifeevents, depression, social connections and healthy lifestyles. Even aftercontrolling for these variables, those who prayed survived 55 per cent more.‘Thus, healthy subjects who prayed were nearly two-thirds more likely tosurvive, and only a small percentage of this effect could be explained on thebasis of mental, social, or behavioral factors.’47[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1380079]If a new drug or surgical procedure had such dramatic effects on health andsurvival as spiritual practices, it would be hailed as a medical breakthrough.Changes in official thinking In an article in Nature in 2011, Michael Crow, the president of Arizona StateUniversity and a senior science administrator, proposed a radical overhaul ofthe US National Institutes of Health, most of whose $30 billion annual budget isdirected towards the discovery of molecular and genetic aspects of diseasesrather than looking at people’s behaviour. He proposed that the present‘Byzantine array’ of twenty-seven institutes and centres be replaced with threenew institutes. One would look at fundamental questions relating to humanhealth, including sociological and behavioural perspectives. A second would bedevoted to research on health outcomes, defined by measurable improvements inpeople’s health: > This should draw on behavioural sciences, economics, technology,> communications and education as well as on fundamental biomedical research . .> . If the aim is to reduce national obesity levels – currently around 30% of> the US population is obese – to less than 10% or 15% of the population, for> example, project leaders would measure progress against that goal rather than> according to some scientific milestone such as the discovery of a genetic or> microbial driver of obesity.48> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1380492] The third of the new institutes would be for health transformation: ‘Rather thanbeing rewarded for maximising knowledge production, this institute would receivefunding based on its success at producing cost-effective public healthimprovements.’49[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1380982]No doubt attempts to change people’s behaviour will be controversial politicallyand will come into conflict with powerful financial interests, such as those ofthe food and drink industries. But public-health problems seem unlikely to besoluble by drugs or surgery alone, and medical costs related to obesity,estimated to be about $160 billion a year in the United States in 2011, areprojected to double by 2020.50[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1381261]Similar changes in thinking are occurring in other countries. In 2010, the UKgovernment published an official report on health policy, a White Paper entitledHealthy Lives, Healthy People, which strongly emphasised social factors thataffect health and disease. As in the United States, the economic issues were inthe foreground, especially in relation to seemingly voluntary aspects of healthand disease. The Minister for Health, Andrew Lansley, wrote in the Foreword: > We have to be bold because so many of the lifestyle-driven health problems we> see today are already at alarming levels. Britain is now the most obese nation> in Europe.

We need a new approach that> empowers individuals to make healthy choices.51> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1381540] The fact that influential administrators and government ministers are proposingradical reforms is a sign of a general change in attitude to health and disease,a swing away from a focus on drugs and surgery to a social model that takes intoaccount people’s behaviour and motivations, as well as motivational and economicfactors that lie outside the scope of old-style mechanistic medicine.Complementary and alternative therapies One of the paradoxes of modern medicine is that, despite its great triumphs andsuccesses, from the 1980s onwards there has been an enormous surge in thepopularity of alternative therapies, previously of interest to only a smallminority and widely perceived as fraudulent. Part of the reason may be that manyalternative practitioners spend more time with their patients and take a morepersonal interest in them than orthodox doctors, who are working under a greaterpressure of time. Another reason may be that doctors’ preoccupation with drugshas led to the neglect of simpler, more traditional remedies and the dismissalof anything that does not fit with the mechanistic conception of disease. Forexample, as J ex haames Le Fanu has pointed out, in relation to problemsconcerning the joints, muscles and bones, > following the discovery of cortisone and other anti-inflammatory agents, the> skills of rheumatologists devolved around juggling various toxic regimes of> drugs in the hope that the benefits might outweigh the sometimes grievous> side-effects. Meanwhile, all the other therapies for rheumatological disorders> – such as massage, manipulation and dietary advice – were abandoned virtually> wholesale, only to be ‘rediscovered’ by alternative practitioners in the> 1980s.52 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1381960] There are many different alternative and complementary therapies. Some, likehomeopathy, naturopathy and chiropractic, grew up in the nineteenth century inopposition to the practice of orthodox medicine, which was often harmful;standard procedures included bleeding patients through incisions or withleeches. Then there were various mind or faith cures, including miraculoushealing at Catholic shrines like Lourdes, faith healings by Protestantevangelists, and Christian Science, a church founded in the United States byMary Baker Eddy (1821–1910), who taught that disease, injury, pain and evendeath were illusions that were given their power by minds out of harmony withGod. In response, official doctors often opposed these rival systems anddenounced them as dangerous quackery.53[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1382507] In addition tothe wide range of home-grown alternative systems in the West, there are now manytherapists who practise traditional medical systems from other parts of theworld, including shamanic healing rituals, ayurvedic medicine from India andtraditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture.Most of these alternative practices are based on non-materialist systems ofthought, and therefore dogmatic materialists see them as superstitious orfraudulent. Yet all these systems claim to have cured people. Some have hadimpressive levels of success in clinical trials, suggesting that they ‘really’work. For example, in 2003, the World Health Organization published a review of293 controlled clinical trials of acupuncture, and came to the conclusion thatacupuncture was an effective treatment for a wide range of conditions, includingmorning sickness and stroke.54[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1382935] This evidencewas inevitably controversial. For people who believed that real effects areimpossible, then the evidence must have been flawed. befects arFor example,critics argued that all the acupuncture trials conducted in China should beexcluded because the results were too positive.55[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1383367] Nevertheless,critical reviews of non-Chinese studies also showed positive effects ofacupuncture; for example, in the relief of pain and nausea.56[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1383789] But disputesrumble on, because in acupuncture trials it is impossible to conduct trulydouble-blind trials. The acupuncturist has to know whether he or she is giving‘placebo’ acupuncture using fake needles.Nevertheless, everyone is prepared to admit that alternative therapies can workas placebos. And since placebo responses themselves really work, this raises thequestion as to whether some therapies work better than others, even if they areindeed pla cebos. Some may bring about bigger placebo responses and hence healpeople more effectively. Evidence-based medicine and comparative effectiveness research It is often assumed that the only scientifically valid kind of clinical trial isa randomised double-blind placebo controlled study, the ‘gold standard’methodology. These trials are indeed helpful in distinguishing between theeffects of a treatment and the effects of a placebo, but they do not provide theinformation that is needed by many patients and health-care organisations. Forexample, if I am suffering from lower back pain, I do not want to know whetherdrug X works better than a placebo in relieving this condition, but which kindof treatment I should seek among the various available therapies, mainstream andalternative: physiotherapy, or drugs from my doctor, or acupuncture, orosteopathy, or some other therapy.The best way to answer this question is by comparing the outcomes of differentkinds of treatment, doing the trial as fairly as possible on a level playingfield. The question would be purely pragmatic: what works? For example, equalnumbers of sufferers with lower back pain could be allocated at random to arange of treatment methods, including physiotherapy, osteopathy, chiropractic,acupuncture, and any other therapeutic methods that claim to be able to treatthis condition; there would also be a group that is given no treatment at all,by being put on a waiting list. Within each treatment group, there would beseveral different practitioners, so that not only could the different methods becompared, but also the variability between practitioners of any particularmethod.The outcomes would be assessed in the same way for all patients at regularintervals after the treatment. The relevant outcome measures would be agreed inadvance in consultation with the therapists involved. The data would then beanalysed statistically to find out > 1. Which treatment, if any, worked best.> 2. Which treatment methods had the greatest variability between> practitioners.> 3. Which methods were the most cost-effective. This kind of information would be of great use to patients and also to providersof health care, such as the UK National Health Service. A similarlevel-playing-field approach could be adopted for a variety of other commonconditions, including migraine headaches and cold sores. This kind of research,sometimes called Comparative Effectiveness Research, would be relatively simpleand cheap to conduct.Imagine, for example, that homeopathy turned out to be the best treatment forcold sores. Sceptics would argue that this was simply because homeopathy had astronger placebo effect than the other treatments. But if homeopathy did indeedunleash a greater placebo response, then this would be an advantage, not adisadvantage. Homeopathy would really work, and it would probably be cheapertoo.Outcome research of this kind is already used within medicine to a limitedextent, especially in relation to mental disorders, like depression andschizophrenia. Although many psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical industryregard modern antidepressant and anti-psychotic drugs as ‘curing’ chemicalimbalances in the brain, others argue that, instead, these drugs work becausethey are psychoactive drugs, rather than specific cures; they alter states ofmind, with effects that include the suppression of emotions and intellectualactivity.57 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1384068]The drugs are useful, but they are not chemical cures. By contrast,psychotherapy has more lasting effects, whether it is combined with drugs ornot. There have already been hundreds of outcome studies on the treatment ofdepression by psychotherapy rather than drugs, and the results are clear. IrvingKirsch summarised them: > Psychotherapy works for the treatment of depression, and the benefits are> substantial. In head-to-head comparisons, in which the short-term effects of> psychotherapy and antidepressants are pitted against each other, psychotherapy> works as well as medication. This is true regardless of how depressed the> person is to begin with . . . Psychotherapy looks even better when its> long-term effectiveness is assessed. Formerly depressed patients are far more> likely to relapse and become depressed again after treatment with> antidepressants than they are after psychotherapy.58> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1384484] These important conclusions would not be possible unless the effectiveness ofdifferent kinds of treatments had been compared. It would never emerge fromresearch that concentrated only on placebo-controlled trials of drugs.One of the problems with mechanistic medicine is its tunnel vision and itsobsession with chemical and surgical methods to the exclusion of all others. Fordecades, the materialist worldview has shaped the way that medicine is taught inmedical schools, biased the funding of medical research, and shaped the policiesof national health services and private insurance companies. Meanwhile medicinehas become ever more expensive.Comparative effectiveness research could lead to a genuinely evidence-basedsystem of medicine that would include, rather than exclude, therapies that donot fit with the materialist belief-system.Fantasies of immortality Most people, like most doctors, are pragmatic, but there is tension at the heartof modern medicine between realistic expectations of what science and medicinecan do and the dream of physical immortality. For those who have turnedscientific progress into a kind of religion, the scientific conquest of deathbecomes the ultimate goal. Alchemists failed to discover the legendary elixirthat was supposed to confer eternal life or eternal youth, but some of thewilder enthusiasts for the scientific salvation of humanity believe that scienceitself will enable some humans to live for ever.The idea of physical immortality was surprisingly influential in the early yearsof the Soviet Union, when some of the more visionary intellectuals were obsessedwith the idea of ‘God-building’. Through science, humanity would becomeall-powerful. Man would become godlike and abolish physical death.59[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1385030] One of theseso-called God-builders was Leonid Krasin (1870–1926), the People’s Commissar ofForeign Trade in Lenin’s government. In 1921, three years before Lenin’s death,he asserted, ‘That time will come, when the liberation of mankind, using all themight of science and technology . . . will be able to resurrect great historicalfigures.’60 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1385577]When Lenin died, he was first embalmed and then frozen, using a system Krasindesigned. An official commission, called ‘The Immortalisation Commission’,oversaw the building of Lenin’s mausoleum, which became a place of pilgrimagefor Communists, just as the shrines of saints had been places of pilgrimage forChristians. But Lenin’s corpse decayed, despite all Krasin’s efforts.Today, in the United States, several companies offer more advanced refrigerationsystems for the same purpose. In 2011, the price for whole-body preservation inliquid nitrogen was around $150,000>. ‘Neuropreservation’ was cheaper: severedheads were frozen for about $90,000.61[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1385856] Six companiesoffer this service, and dozens of Americans are already frozen and awaitingresurrection.Freezing is merely a stopgap measure, and some people hope that death itselfwill soon be overcome. In 2009, the futurist Ray Kurzweil claimed that humanscould be immortal in as little as twenty years’ time, thanks to nanotechnologiesand nano-robots, or ‘nanobots’, that would enable vital organs to be replaced: > I and many other scientists now believe that in around 20 years we will have> the means to reprogram our bodies’ stone-age software so we can halt, then> reverse, ageing. Then nanotechnology will let us live for ever. Ultimately,> nanobots will replace blood cells and do their work thousands of times more> effectively.

If we want to go into virtual-reality mode, nanobots will shut> down brain signals and take us wherever we want to go. Virtual sex will become> commonplace.62> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1386180]Meanwhile, to delay the ageing process so that he can survive long enough tobenefit from these advances, Kurzweil takes 250 supplement pills a day.63[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1386603] But unless anduntil his dreams come true, we will all have to die of something, and the longerdeath is delayed, the more expensive and medically demanding our lives willbecome.Most doctors take a pragmatic view of their abilities, and recognise that thereare limits to the power of medicine. A conquest of one disease, or at least itsdiminution, must inevitably increase the death rate from other diseases. If allheart disease could be prevented or cured, then death rates from cancer would goup. If all cancers could be cured, then death rates from other causes wouldincrease. And as new drugs and new techniques become ever more expensive, and asmore people survive to old age, the costs of treatment are becoming increasinglyunaffordable, even in the richest countries.Ways of dyingSurgeons can operate on people with lung cancer, but they cannot stop peoplesmoking and increasing their likelihood of getting lung cancer in the firstplace. They can operate on old people to replace failing organs, but suchoperations become increasingly risky and expensive, and give a very limitedextension of life. In the United States, about 30 per cent of the Medicarebudget, which pays the health expenses of people over sixty-five, is spent onpatients in their last year of life; and 78 per cent of this expenditure is inthe last month of life.64[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1387018]A study funded by the US National Cancer Institute compared alternative ways oftreating patients with advanced cancer. Some were treated in the standard way,without being asked about their preferences. Others had an ‘end of life’conversation with their physician, in which one of the questions was: ‘If youcould choose, would you prefer (1) a course of treatment that focused onextending life as much as possible even if that meant more pain and discomfort,or (2) a plan of care that focused on relieving pain and discomfort as long aspossible even if that meant not living as long?’ Many of the patients preferredthe second option: they did not want to die on a respirator in intensive care.Patients who were given this choice ‘had significantly lower health care costsin their final week of life. Higher costs were associated with worse quality ofdeath.’65 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1387886] Inanother study, patients with metastatic lung cancer who were given palliativecare soon after diagnosis reported better quality of life, were less depressedand, on average, actually survived longer than those who received aggressiveanti-cancer therapy.66[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1388420]Hospices and palliative care provide a very different way of approaching death.Palliative care focuses on relieving and preventing suffering. Instead of seeingterminal illness as a medical crisis requiring extreme interventions, patientsare cared for in a way that helps them prepare for death, emotionally, sociallyand spiritually, as well as physically.What difference does it make? At present we have an official state-sponsored medical system that is expensive,restrictive and strongly influenced by powerful pharmaceutical corporations,whose primary concern is the making of large profits. This system has beenspectacularly successful, but most of its advances occurred before the 1980s.The rate of innovation is slowing, and most of the promises of genetic medicineand biotechnology remain unfulfilleain/font>If the state-sponsored monopoly of materialism is loosened, scientific andclinical research could look at the role of beliefs, faiths, hopes, fears andsocial influences in health and healing. Systems of therapy could be compared onthe basis of their effectiveness, and people could choose those that are likelyto work best for them, with the help of informed advisers. Diet, exercise andpreventive medicine programmes would also be compared on the basis of theireffectiveness. The nature of placebo responses and the power of the mind couldbecome valid fields of research, as would the effects of prayer and meditation.An integrative medical system could empower people to lead healthier lives.Doctors and patients could become more aware of the innate capacity of the bodyto heal and could recognise the importance of hope and faith. More people couldbe asked how they would prefer to die, whether at home, in a hospice or inintensive care.An integrative approach to medicine would build on the enormous advances of thelast two centuries, and include them in a broader kind of medicine that couldwork better and cost less.Questions for materialists Have you ever consulted an alternative therapist? If not, would you everconsider doing so? How do you explain the placebo response? How do you think governments and insurance companies should deal with theescalating costs of medicine? Do you think governments should fund comparative effectiveness research ondifferent kinds of therapy, including alternative therapies?Summary Modern medicine has been amazingly successful. Together with immunisationprogrammes and public-health measures it has reduced infant mortality,transformed human lives and increased life expectancy. Its focus on the physicaland chemical aspects of human bodies has resulted in major advances in surgeryand drugs. But because of its materialist prejudices, it ignores mentalinfluences as much as possible. People’s hopes and expectations affect theirrecovery from disease, injury or surgery, as revealed quantitatively in placeboresponses. The power of belief is also shown by the hypnotic induction ofblisters and by ‘magical’ cures for warts. Conversely, feelings of despair andhopelessness can suppress the activity of the immune system, lead to poorerrates of recovery from injuries and surgery. People who have suffered from heartattacks survive better, on average, if they are married, or have a close friend,or keep a pet. Regular attendance at religious services tends to lead to betterhealth and longevity, and people who pray or meditate tend to be healthier andlive longer than those who do not. Thus many psychological, emotional, socialand spiritual factors affect health and disease. So do diet and o deallifestyle.The ‘obesity pandemic’ and the spiralling costs of healthcare are forcingchanges in government policies, but exhortation and education are of limitedeffectiveness in changing people’s motivation and behaviour. Alternative andcomplementary systems of medicine cure some people some of the time, and not alltheir effects can be ascribed to placebo responses alone. Comparativeeffectiveness research provides a way of finding out what works best. Allmedical systems involve placebo responses, and some may produce more thanothers. When people are nearing death, heroic attempts to keep them alive byemergency surgical interventions are expensive and often inappropriate. If theyare given the choice, many prefer palliative care and prefer a hospice to ahospital, even if they are likely to die sooner. An inclusive, integrativemedical system is likely to be cheaper and more effective than an exclusivelymechanistic system.11 Illusions of Objectivity For those who idealise science, scientists are the epitome of objectivity,rising above the sectarian divisions and illusions that afflict the rest ofhumanity. Scientific minds are freed from the normal limitations of bodies,emotions and social obligations, and can travel beyond the earth-bound realm ofthe senses to see all nature as if from outside, stripped of subjectivequalities. They have godlike, mathematical knowledge of the vast reaches ofspace and time, and even of countless universes beyond our own. Unlike religion,locked in endless conflicts and disputes, science offers a true understanding ofmaterial nature, the only reality there is. Scientists constitute a priesthoodsuperior to the priesthoods of religions, which maintain their prestige andpower by playing on human ignorance and fear. Scientists stand in the vanguardof human progress, leading humanity onwards and upwards to a better and brighterworld.Most scientists are unconscious of the myths, allegories and assumptions thatshape their social roles and political power. These beliefs are implicit ratherthan explicit. But they are more powerful because they are so habitual. If theyare unconscious, they cannot be questioned; and in so far as they arecollective, shared by the scientific community, there is no incentive toquestion them.In the course of this book, I have shown that the materialist philosophy or ‘thescientific worldview’ is not a vision of undeniable, objective truth. It is aquestionable belief-system superseded by the development of the sciencesthemselves. In this chapter I look at the myths of disembodied knowledge andscientific objectivity and the ways in which they conflict with the obvious factthat scientists are people. Sciences are human activities. The assumption thatthe sciences are uniquely objective not only distorts the public perception ofscientists, but affects scientists’ perception of themselves. The illusion ofobjectivity makes scientists prone to deception and self-deception. It worksagainst the noble ideal of seeking truth.Shamanic journeys and disembodied minds From the outset, the power of science to persuade has depended not only onquantitative calculations, reason and power, but on the use of the imagination.This is illustrated nowhere more clearly than in a remarkable book by JohannesKepler, written in 1609, called Somnium, sive astronomia lunaris, meaning ‘TheDream, or the Astronomy of the Moon’. The aim of his book, he explained, was to‘work out, through the example of the moon, an argument for the motion of theearth’.1 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1389188] Oneof the biggest problems faced by Kepler and other defenders of the idea that theearth moved around the sun – in other words the Copernican system of astronomy –was that the earth feels stationary and we actually see the sun moving aroundit.In his Somnium, Kepler depicted a journey to the moon and described the universeas seen from its surface. The moon ‘seems to its inhabitants to be stationary,while the stars go around it, just as the earth seems to us to be stationary’.2[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1389736] His voyagersaw the earth hanging in space and revolving on its axis. Thus, by imagining ajourney to the moon, he made the new astronomy imaginable. This vision wasembodied in globes. Everyone who sees a globe in a geography classroom canexperience the earth seen from a point of view outside it, which no human beinghad ever actually seen until the first astronauts looked back at the earth fromspace. But the extraterrestrial point of view long preceded the Copernicanrevolution. Greek astronomers had already concluded by the third century bc thatthe earth was spherical, and were making globes.3[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1390154] The novelfeature of Kepler’s vision was not seeing the earth from outside, but seeing itrotating.Kepler’s observer was able to go to the moon because he was a disembodiedspirit, a daemon who travelled there by will-power, taking with him humans whowere accustomed to flying, especially ‘dried-up old crones, who since childhoodhave ridden over great stretches of the earth at night in tattered cloaks ongoats or pitchforks’.4[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1390833] In Kepler’sstory, the narrator was introduced to the daemon by a wise woman who gatheredherbs on the slopes of the volcano Hekla in Iceland, from which the travellersto the moon left during a lunar eclipse, voyaging in the shadow of the earth toavoid the burning rays of the sun.This story caused Kepler big problems. When he was writing, witchcraft was takenvery seriously, and it was generally believed that witches could fly likespirits; indeed it was the prevalence of this belief that made Kepler think itwould be a persuasive literary device. In Kepler’s home town in Germany,Leonberg, several women had just been burned as witches when news of Kepler’sstill unpublished book leaked out. His mother, Katherina Kepler, was accused ofwitchcraft, arrested and imprisoned, and Kepler had to spend several yearsprotecting her from execution.5[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1391512]The idea of disembodied minds soon became a central feature of mechanisticscience. René Descartes in his Meditations (1641) took as the first principle ofhis philosophy, ‘I am thinking, therefore I exist’, and immediately inferredthat his thinking mind was disembodied: > From this I knew I was a substance whose whole essence or nature is simply to> think, and which does not require any place, or depend on any material thing,> in order to exist. Accordingly, this ‘I’ – that is, the soul by which I am> what I am – is entirely distinct from the body, and indeed is easier to know> than the body, and would not fail to be whatever it is, even if the body did> not exist.6 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1391811] His mind was godlike and immortal. He could know the laws of nature through hisreason and participate in the mathematical mind of God. By contrast, his bodywas material and, like all other matter, unconscious and mechanical.Science became a view from nowhere. The minds of scientists were somehowdisembodied. This is why Stephen Hawking is such an iconic figure in the popularimagination. Through the misfortune of his illness, he is as close to adisembodied mind as a human can be. As a quote from Time magazine on the coverof his bestselling book, A Brief History of Time (1988), put it, ‘Even as hesits helplessly in his wheelchair, his mind seems to soar ever more brilliantlyacross the vastness of space and time to unlock the secrets of the universe.’This image of disembodied minds at the same time harks back to the visionaryjourneys of shamans, whose spirits could travel into the underworld in an animalform, or fly into the heavens like a bird. Like the spirit of the shaman, themind of the scientist can travel far up into the sky; he can look back from theheavens and observe the earth, the solar system, our home galaxy, and even theentire universe as if from outside. He can travel also in the other directioninto the realm of the very small, zooming into the most minuscule recesses ofmatter.Thought experiments have played an important part in science, most notably whenAlbert Einstein imagined himself running alongside a wave of light. He realisedthat, from the point of view of a disembodied mind travelling at the speed oflight, the light would appear to be stationary and no time would elapse. Thisimaginary disembodied experience preoccupied him for years; he first beganthinking about it in 1896 when he was sixteen, and it played a crucial role inthe development of his theory of relativity.7[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1392511]Although only exceptional scientists could use their imaginations like Keplerand Einstein, disembodied, objective knowledge was an ideal that set scienceapart from other forms of human knowing. In order to emphasise science’s specialstatus, scientists adopted a peculiar style of writing that became popular inthe late nineteenth century and is still found in many scientific reports today.They wrote in the passive voice as if they were dispassionate, disembodiedobservers before whom events unfolded spontaneously. Instead of saying, ‘I tooka test tube,’ they wrote, ‘A test tube was taken.’ Instead of observing, ‘It wasobserved that . . .’ Instead of someone thinking about the results, ‘It wasconsidered that . . .’In the nineteenth century, materialists believed that physics was able to give aclear definition of matter, leaving minds out of the picture altogether, butwith the development of quantum theory from the 1920s this assumption becameuntenable. Observations require observers, and the way in which experiments aredone affects the results they give. This is obvious, but until the developmentof quantum theory, physicists tried to pretend that they were not involved intheir own experiments. As the physicist Bernard d’Espagnat expressed it in 1976,in the latter part of the nineteenth century, > physicists thought that they were able to define matter (as the collection of> all atoms plus the fields) and believed they could formulate their science> without any reference, even an implicit one, to states of consciousness of> observers. Consequently, thinkers at that time legitimately believed that> ‘matter’ thus defined was indeed the sole and primeval reality. Nowadays,> however, the situation is completely different . . . [T]he principles of> physics itself have undergone such an evolution that they cannot even be> formulated without referring (though in some cases only implicitly) to the> impressions – and thus to the minds – of the observers. As a consequence,> materialism is bound to change.8> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1392929] Nevertheless, physicists and other scientists went on using the passive voice intheir reports. Things are now changing, as I discuss below, but in the popularimage of science, and in much of science education, the passive voice is stillemployed to maintain the illusion of disembodied objectivity.The allegory of the cave In Plato’s famous allegory of the cave, captives are chained to the wall, andsee only confused shadows on the wall. They are subject to all kinds of opinion,illusion and conlusorts. Thiflict. The philosopher is like a prisoner who breaksfrom the cave and sees reality as it truly is.As Bruno Latour, the sociologist of science, pointed out in his book ThePolitics of Nature (2009), this allegory took on a new lease of life in relationto science. For Plato, the allegory of the cave implied a journey beyond therealm of the body and the senses to the realm of immaterial Ideas. But itsmeaning has been hijacked. For materialists, objective reality is not the realmof Ideas but mathematicised matter. In the modern version of this allegory,scientists alone can step out of the cave, observe reality as it is, and comeback into the cave imparting some of this knowledge to the rest of humanity,confused by rival subjectivities. Only scientists can see reality and truth.‘The Philosopher, and later the Scientist, have to free themselves from thetyranny of the social dimension, public life, politics, subjective feelings,popular agitation – in short, from the dark Cave – if they want to accede totruth.’ Back within the cave, the rest of humanity is locked into the realm ofmulticulturalism, conflict and politics. As Latour put it, > The allegory of the Cave makes it possible to create in one fell swoop a> certain idea of science and a certain idea of the social world that will serve> as a foil for science . . . The contraries turn out to be combined in one and> the same heroic figure, that of the Philosopher-Scientist, at once Lawgiver> and Saviour. Although the world of truth differs absolutely, not relatively,> from the social world, the Scientist can go back and forth from one world to> the other no matter what: the passageway closed to all others is open to him> alone . . . In the original myth, as we know, the Philosopher managed only> with the greatest difficulty to break the chains that attached him to the> shadowy world . . . Today, sizeable budgets, vast laboratories, huge> businesses, and powerful equipment allow researchers to come and go in> complete safety between the social world and the world of Ideas, and from> Ideas to the dark cave where they go to bring light. The narrow door has> become a broad boulevard.9> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1393486] Together with the fantasy of disembodied knowledge, the allegory of the caveimplicitly supports the ideal of scientific objectivity. But the behaviour ofscientists themselves is more ambiguous.The humanity of scientists Among the many scientists I have known, some are ruthlessly ambitious, otherskind and generous; some boringly pedantic, others excitingly speculative; somenarrow-minded, others visionary; some cowardly, others brave; some meticulous,others careless; some honest, others deceptive; some secretive, others open;some original, others unoriginal. In other words, they are people. They vary,just as other kinds of people vary.Through studying scientists in action, sociologists of science have revealedthat scientists are indeed like other people. Tthent hey are subject to socialforces and peer-group pressures, and they need acceptance, funding and, ifpossible, political influence. Their success does not depend simply on theingenuity of their theories or the facts they discover. The facts do not speakfor themselves. To be successful, scientists need rhetorical skills, to build upalliances and win the support of others.10[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1394160]The historian of science Thomas Kuhn has shown that ‘normal science’ ispractised within a shared framework of assumptions and agreed practices, aparadigm. Phenomena that do not fit – anomalies – are routinely dismissed orexplained away. Scientists are often dogmatic and prejudiced when confrontedwith evidence or ideas that go against their beliefs. They usually ignore whatthey do not want to deal with. ‘Turning a blind eye is the no-nonsense way todeal with potentially troublesome ideas,’ observed the sociologists of science,Harry Collins and Trevor Pinch.11[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1394724] ‘The meaningof an experimental result does not . . . depend only on the care with which itwas designed and carried out, it depends on what people are ready to believe.’12[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1395281]In disputes between rival scientists, experimental results are rarely decisiveon their own. The facts do not speak for themselves because there is noagreement about the facts. Maybe the method was flawed, or the apparatus faulty,or the data wrongly interpreted. When a new consensus builds up, these disputesrecede into the background, and the ‘correct’ results are accepted, making iteasier for similar results to be correct.The determination of the fundamental constants is a case in point. When thespeed of light, c, apparently dropped by 20 kilometres per second from 1928 to1945, laboratories all around the world reported measurements close to theconsensus value. But when c went up again, laboratories duly agreed closely withthe new consensus (see Chapter 3). Did the speed of light really change? Thedata say that it did. But for theoretical reasons it could not really havechanged, because it is believed to be a fundamental constant. Therefore theconsensus data must have been flawed. The scientists probably discardedmeasurements that didn’t fit, and ‘corrected’ the remaining data until theyconverged on the expected value as a result of ‘intellectual phase locking’ (seepages 92–3).An international committee fixed the speed of light by definition in 1972,putting an end to embarrassing variations. But other constants have continued tovary, especially the Universal Gravitational Constant, G. So does G really vary?The facts cannot speak for themselves because most of the measurements are notpublished. Within individual laboratories researchers discard unsuitable data,arriving at the final value by averaging selected measurements. Then aninternational committee of experts selects, adjusts and averages the data fromdifferent laboratories to arrive at the internationally recognised ‘best value’of G. Previous ‘best values’ are consigned to the archives of science, wherethey gather dust.13[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1395693]Anyone who has actually carried out scientific research knows that data areuncertain, that much depends on the way they are interpreted, and that allmethods have their limitations. Scientists are used to having their data andinterpretations scrutinised and criticised by anonymous peer-reviewers. They areusually well aware of the uncertainties and limitations of knowledge in theirown field.The illusion of objectivity gains in strength through distance. Biologists,psychologists and social scientists are notorious for physics envy, seeingphysics as far more objective and precise than their own rather messy fields,where there is so much uncertainty. From the outside, metrology, the branch ofphysics concerned with fundamental constants, seems an oasis of certainty. Butmetrologists themselves make no such claim: they are preoccupied with variationsin measurements, arguments about the reliability of different methods, anddisputes between different laboratories. They achieve a higher level ofprecision than scientists studying plants, rats or minds, but their ‘bestvalues’ are still consensus figures arrived at through processes of subjectiveevaluation.The further the distance, the stronger the illusion. Those who are most prone toidealise the objectivity of scientists are people who know almost nothing aboutscience, people for whom it has become a kind of religion, their hope ofsalvation.The active voice The idealised objectivity of science is reflected in the use of the passivevoice in many science reports: ‘A test tube was taken . . .’ All researchscientists know that writing in the passive voice is artificial; they are notdisembodied observers, but people doing research. Technocrats also use thepassive voice to give their reports an air of scientific authority, dressing upopinions as objective facts.The passive style did not become fashionable in science until the end of thenineteenth century. Previously, scientists like Isaac Newton, Michael Faradayand Charles Darwin used the active voice. The passive was introduced to makescience seem more objective, impersonal and professional. Its heyday in thescientific literature was from 1920 to 1970. But times are changing. Manyscientists abandoned this convention in the 1970s and 1980s.In 1999, I was astonished to read in my eleven-year-old son’s science notebook,‘The test tube was heated and carefully smelt.’ At primary school his sciencereports had been lively and vivid, but when he moved to secondary school theybecame stilted and artificial. His teachers had told him to write that way, andgave him a style sheet to copy.I’d thought that schools had abandoned this practice years ago, and was curiousto find out how widespread it still was. In 2000, I carried out a survey of 172secondary schools in Britain to discover how many insisted on the passive style.Overall, 42 per cent of the schools still promoted the passive voice, 45 percent the active, and 13 per cent had no preference.14[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1396124]Most of the teachers enforcing the use of passive voice said they were simplyfollowing convention. No one was enthusiastic about it. They taught it out of asense of duty because they believed that leading scientists and journalsrequired it. Some thought that examination boards insisted on it, but this wasnot true. I found that all the UK examination boards accepted reports in theactive or the passive voice.15[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1396540]I also found that most scientific journals accepted papers in the active voice;some, including Nature, positively encouraged it. I surveyed fifty-five journalsin the physical and biological sciences, and found only two that requiredpassive constructions.When Lord May, the president of the Royal Society, read the results of my surveyof school science teaching, he was ‘horrified’ that so many favoured thepassive: ‘I would put my own view so strongly as to say that, these days, theuse of the passive voice in a research paper is the hallmark of second-ratework,’ he said. ‘In the long run, more authority is conferred by the directapproach than by the pedantic pretence that some impersonal force is performingthe research.’16[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1396957] May’s viewswere shared by many other eminent scientists, including the Astronomer Royal,Martin Rees, who succeeded Lord May as president of the Royal Society, and BruceAlberts, then president of the US National Academy of Sciences.Nevertheless, old habits die hard, and science teachers in many schools stillinsist that their pupils write in the passive voice. In a survey in 2010,science teachers in 30 per cent of British secondary schools were stillinsisting on the passive voice.17[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1397373] This is anoutdated practice. ‘Primary and secondary teachers should, without anyreservation, be encouraging all their students to be writing in the activevoice,’ said Lord May.18[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1398245]Switching from the passive to the active voice in science reports is a simplereform that costs nothing and makes science writing more truthful and morereadable.Standard scientific pretences Peter Medawar was an articulate British biologist who won the Nobel Prize forMedicine. In a witty talk on BBC radio in 1963, he asked, ‘Is the scientificpaper a fraud?’ and answered, ‘Yes.’ He was not referring to fraudulent data,but to the way that scientific papers are conventionally written. In scientificjournals, the standard format for articles, then as now, is to start with aneutral-sounding Introduction, setting out the problem and referring to earlierresearch, followed by a Methods section, then the Results and finally aDiscussion. As Medawar described it, > The section called ‘results’ consists of a stream of factual information in> which it is considered extremely bad form to discuss the significance of> results you are getting. You have to pretend firmly that your mind is, so to> speak, a virgin receptacle, an empty vessel, for information which flows into> it from the external world for no reason which you yourself have revealed. You> reserve all appraisal of the scientific evidence until the ‘discussion’> section, and in the discussion you adopt the ludicrous pretence of asking> yourself if the information you have collected actually means anything. Medawar pointed out that this procedure, still standard today, gives an entirelyfalse impression of the way science works, suggesting that scientists collectfacts and then draw general conclusions from them. In fact, scientists startwith an expectation or a hypothesis that provides the incentive for the enquiryin the first place. It is only in the light of these expectations that someobservations are thought to be relevant, and others not; that some methods arechosen and others discarded; that some experiments are done rather than others.Medawar suggested a more honest approach: putting the discussion at thebeginning: > The scientific facts and scientifs a Pric acts should follow the discussion,> and scientists should not be ashamed to admit, as many of them apparently are> ashamed to admit, that hypotheses appear in their minds along uncharted> by-ways of thought; that they are imaginative and inspirational in character;> that they are indeed adventures of the mind.19> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1398662]How experimenters affect their results Most medical researchers are well aware that their beliefs and expectations caninfluence the results of their experiments, which is why many clinical trialsare carried out double-blind: neither the researchers nor the patients know whohas received which treatment (see Chapter 10).Experimenter effects are also well known in experimental psychology. Thisprinciple was illustrated in a classic experiment in which the experimenterstrained a group of psychology graduate students to administer the Rorschachtest, in which subjects were asked to identify patterns in inkblots. Theexperimenters told half of the students that experienced psychologists obtainedmore human than animal images from their subjects. They told the other half ofthe group the opposite. Sure enough, when they administered the test the secondgroup found more animal images than the first.20[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1399076]Even in experiments with animals, experimenters’ expectations can influence theresults. In a classic experiment at Harvard, Robert Rosenthal and his colleaguesinstructed students to test rats in standard mazes. They asked them to comparetwo strains of rat produced by generations of selective breeding for good andpoor performance in mazes. But they deliberately deceived their students. Infact, the rats came from a standard laboratory strain and were divided at randominto two groups labelled ‘maze-bright’ and ‘maze-dull’.Trusting what they had been told, the students expected the bright rats to dobetter than the dull ones and, sure enough, they found that the ‘bright’ ratslearned much faster than the ‘dull’ ones.21[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1399492] Since the ratswere more or less identical, these dramatic differences must have resulted fromthe students’ expectations.Although experimenter-expectancy effects are widely recognised in psychology andmedicine, in the ‘hard’ sciences most scientists assume that they areirrelevant. They take it for granted that their own expectations have noinfluence on their experiments and on the recording of data."},{"pageContent":"From 1996 to 1998, I carried out a survey of more than 1,500 papers in leadingscientific journals to find out how often the researchers used blind methods.Caroline Watt and Marleen Nagtegaal later replicated this survey, using adifferent selection of journals (Table 1). > Table 11.1. A comparison of the percentage of papers reporting blind> methodologies in different fields of science in two independent surveys, by> Sheldrake (1999c), and Watt and Nagtegaal (2004). [images/00017.jpg] Watt and Nagtegaal found a higher percentage of papers with blind methodologiesin most areas than I did, and a slightly lower percentage in parapsychology, butin both our surveys, in the physical sciences almost no research involved blindmethodologies, and in the biological sciences very little, less than 2.5 percent. Even in experimental psychology, animal behaviour and the medicalsciences, where the effects of experimenters’ expectations are widelyrecognised, a minority of studies used blind methods. By far the highestpercentage was in parapsychology.I also organised a telephone survey of senior researchers in fifty-fivedepartments in eleven British universities, including Oxford, Cambridge,Edinburgh and Imperial College, London. My research assistant, Jane Turney,carried out the interviews by telephone. She asked the professors or othersenior scientists if anyone in their department used blind methodologies, andalso whether they taught students about such methods.Some of the scientists did not know what was meant by the phrase ‘blindmethodology’. Most were aware of blind techniques, but said that they werenecessary only in clinical research or psychology. They thought they were usedto avoid biases introduced by human subjects. The commonest view among physicaland biological scientists was that blind methodologies were unnecessary because‘Nature itself is blind’, as one researcher put it. A professor of chemistryadded, ‘Science is difficult enough as it is without making it even harder bynot knowing what you are working on.’Out of twenty-three physics and chemistry departments, only one used blindmethods and taught the students about such methods. Out of forty-two departmentsin the biological sciences, twelve (29 per cent) sometimes used blind methodsand taught about them.24[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1400805] But only inexceptional cases were blind techniques used routinely. My survey revealed threeexamples, all of which involved industrial contracts that required theuniversity scientists to evaluate coded samples without knowing theiridentity.25 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1401222]Experimental tests for experimenter effects The assumption that blind techniques are unnecessary in most fields of scienceis so fundamental that it deserves to be tested.26[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1401639] In allbranches of experimental science we can ask: can the expectations ofexperimenters act like self-fulfilling prophecies, introducing a bias, consciousor unconscious, into the way the data are collected, analysed and interpreted?There is a simple way to find out by doing experiments on experiments. Take atypical experiment involving a test sample and a control; for example, thecomparison of an inhibited enzyme with an uninhibited control enzyme in abiochemical experiment. Then carry out the experiment as usual, where theexperimenter knows which sample is which. Also do the experiment under ‘blind’conditions with the samples labelled A and B. In a student practical class, forinstance, half of the class would do the experiment blind, while the other halfwould know which sample is which. If there were no significant differencesbetween the results under blind and open conditions, this would show that blindtechniques were unnecessary. Significant differences would reveal the existenceof experimenter effects. Further research would then be needed to find out howthese effects worked.This experiment costs nothing but simply involves labelling samples differently.It would be easy to do in laboratory classes in schools or universities. When Ifirst proposed this simple experiment,27[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1402191] I naïvelyassumed that skeptics, who spend so much of their time insisting on theobjectivity of science, would be particularly interested in this question. Itherefore launched an appeal in the Skeptical Inquirer28[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1402608] and in theSkeptic,29 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1403025]asking people who worked in universities to collaborate in this research. Therewas no response. Richard Wiseman, himself a skeptic, together with CarolineWatt, launched another appeal in the Skeptical Inquirer30[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1403442] with a similarlack of response.On one occasion I thought that it was going to bwas wie possible to do this testwhen a physics teacher at one of Britain’s leading schools agreed to try it withhis final-year students. But he had to ask permission from the head of science,who asked me to meet him to explain what I had in mind. His response wasilluminating. He said, ‘Of course the students are going to be influenced bytheir expectations. That’s what science education is all about. It’s obviousthey will try to get the right results. This experiment will open up a can ofworms, and I don’t want it opened in my school.’These remarks were helpful because of their directness and honesty. I realisedthat all professional scientists have spent years doing lab classes at schooland at university being trained to get the expected results.Over a period of ten years at Cambridge University (in cell biology andbiochemistry), and one year at Harvard (in Biology 101), I taught in laboratoryclasses in which students did standard experiments with outcomes that were wellknown in advance. But there were always some students who did not get the‘right’ results. Everyone assumed they had simply made mistakes. Some studentswere often bad at getting the standard results: I suppose they graduated withpoor degrees, and were therefore unlikely to go on to a career in scientificresearch. Those who became professional scientists were people who showed areliable ability to get the correct results over many years of practicaleducation in laboratories.Although experimenter effects may often result from biases in the observationand recording of results, experimenters might affect the experimental systemitself. This is easy to understand when experiments involve human subjects, whomay well respond to the experimenters’ expectations and attitude. Rosenthal’sclassic experiment with Harvard students testing rats shows that animals too canbe influenced by the way they are treated. But there is a more radicalpossibility. In the uncertain circumstances of research, the experimenter’sexpectations may directly affect the system under investigation throughmind-over-matter effects or psychokinesis. For example, if hundreds of highlyqualified physicists expect to find an evanescent particle among theindeterminate events that occur in a particle accelerator, could theirexpectations affect these quantum events? Could the hopes of scientistsinfluence the outcomes of more mundane experiments too?These may seem far-fetched possibilities, and discussing them is normallyprevented by the taboo against psychic phenomena. But I believe it is importantto investigate rather than suppress this question. Many stories circulate inlaboratories that suggest that some people bring about mysterious effects.Sometimes they are negative effects, or jinxes. One of the most famous examplesis the so-called Pauli effect, named after the Nobel-Prize-winning physicistWolfgang Pauli (1900–58). He was reputed to cause the failure of laboratoryequipment merely by his presence. For fear of this effect, his friend OttoStern, an experimental physicist, banned Pauli from his laboratory in Hamburg.Pauli himself was convinced that the effect was real, and was worried that hemight have contributed unwittingly to the burning of the cyclotron at PrincetonUniversity when he was nearby. effect size=\"-2\"face=\"MinionRegulSmalCapsOldsFigu\">31[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1403865]Sometimes apparent mind-over-matter effects are positive. A professor ofbiochemistry from a major US university told me that part of the secret of hissuccess was that he could achieve better purifications of protein molecules thanhis colleagues. He said that when a sample of mixed proteins was beingseparated, he stayed with the apparatus in the cold room ‘willing’ the system togive clearer separations, and saying, ‘Separate!’Was this a personal superstition, or did it have any effect? This question couldbe investigated experimentally. For example, two identical pieces of apparatuscould be loaded with the same mixture of proteins. One, selected at random,would then be given to the professor to accompany during the separation process.The other would be put in a different cold room and left alone for the sameperiod of time. The separations would then be compared to see if there was anydifference. I tried to persuade this professor to do the experiment himself, buthe was unwilling to try it. Although he was curious, he could not risk thepotential damage to his credibility and career.The supposed objectivity of the ‘hard sciences’ is an untested hypothesis. Thereis a conspiracy of science about experimenter-expectancy effects in mostbranches of physics, chemistry and biology. The assumption that they areconfined to clinical research, human psychology and animal behaviour may well beuntrue.Another problem is that scientists usually publish only a small proportion oftheir data. If they cherry-pick the results that suit their hypotheses, thiswill introduce another source of bias, sometimes called ‘publication bias’, andsometimes called the ‘file-drawer effect’, because negative results are left infiles (see Chapter 9).The built-in bias of publication Of all areas of scientific research, parapsychology is subject to the mostsevere and persistent skeptical scrutiny, as discussed in Chapter 9. Skepticsare strongly motivated to dismiss any positive findings, and have a ready-madelist of objections: flawed methods, fraud, experimenter effects or the selectivepublication of positive results. Because parapsychologists are so aware of thesestandard criticisms, they are exceptionally careful to carry out theirexperiments as rigorously as possible. In the surveys summarised in Table 11.1,a far higher proportion of parapsychologists used blind methods than researchersin any other branch of science. Parapsychologists are also far more rigorousabout publishing negative results and controlling against the so-calledfile-drawer effect.32[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1404275]Skeptics are right to point out these possible sources of error inparapsychological research, and their continual sir \" align=\"crutiny hasbenefited the standards of research in the subject. But the same scepticalprinciples should be applied to other areas of science. What proportion ofresearch results are published in physics, chemistry and biology? There seem tohave been no studies on this question, but in informal surveys I have carriedout myself, in most subjects this proportion seems to be around 5 to 10 percent.Scientists are more likely to publish their ‘best’ results than negative orinconclusive findings. We saw one example in Chapter 10: the manufacturers ofProzac, Eli Lilly, published positive but not negative results from clinicaltrials. In addition, scientific journals are often unwilling to publish negativeresults. The implications are enormous. As Ben Goldacre put it, ‘whole fields ofscience are at risk of spurious positive findings’.33[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1404951]Published data have to pass through three selective filters. The firstfiltration of the data occurs when experimenters decide to publish some resultsrather than others; the second when editors of journals consider only certainkinds of results eligible for publication; and the third in the peer-reviewprocess, which ensures that expected results are more likely to be approved forpublication than unexpected results.If businesses were required to publish only 10 per cent of their accounts, theywould probably publish those that made their business look as profitable and aswell managed as possible. Conversely, if they needed to submit only 10 per centof their accounts to the tax authorities, they would tend to show their leastprofitable activities. Suppressing 90 per cent of the data gives a lot of scopefor selective reporting. How much does this practice affect the sciences? No oneknows.Scientific fraud and deceit Scientists, like doctors, lawyers and other professionals, generally resistattempts by outsiders to regulate their conduct. They pride themselves on theirown system of controls, which are threefold: > 1. Applications for jobs and grants are subject to peer review,> ensuring that the researchers and their projects meet the approval of> established professionals in their field.> 2. Papers submitted to scientific journals are peer-reviewed, and have> to pass the critical scrutiny of expert referees, usually anonymous.> 3. All published results are potentially subject to independent> replication. Peer review and refereeing procedures can indeed act as important qualitychecks, and are often effective, but they tend to favour expected results andconventional procedures. Independent replications are rarely performed. There isusually no motivation for repeating the work of others. And even if exactreplications are performed, it is difficult to get them published becausescientific journals favour original research. Generally speaking, scientists tryto replicate other people’s results only when the results are of unusualimportance or when fraud is suspected on other grounds.An additional safeguard is the convention that when other scientists ask to seea researcher’s raw data so they can reanalyse them, the data are supplied, inthe interests of openness. However, when I asked for data from scientists makingsceptical claims in fields of research closely related to my own, they haverefused to supply them, either on the grounds that they were ‘inaccessible’ orbecause they planned to reanalyse them themselves (but never did). In a recentsystematic study, some Dutch psychologists at the University of Amsterdamcontacted the authors of 141 papers published in leading psychology journals,asking for access to the raw data for the sake of reanalysis. All these journalsrequired authors to sign an undertaking that they ‘would not withhold the dataon which their conclusions are based from other competent professionals’. Aftersix months and four hundred emails, the Amsterdam researchers received sets ofdata from only 29 per cent of the authors.34[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1405366]One of the few areas of science under a limited form of external supervision isthe testing for safety of new foods, drugs and pesticides. In the United States,every year many thousands of results are submitted by industry for review by theFood and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).Their inspectors continually unearth falsified data.35[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1405903]Frauds in the unpoliced hinterlands of science are rarely exposed by theofficial mechanisms of peer review, refereeing or independent replication. Mostcome to light as a result of whistle-blowing by colleagues or rivals, often as aresult of a personal grievance. When this happens, the typical response of theauthorities is to try to hush the matter up. If the charges of fraud do not blowover and if the evidence becomes overwhelming, then an official inquiry is held,and someone is found guilty and dismissed in disgrace.36[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1406324]Probably many cases of fraud are indeed hushed up. The authorities have a strongmotive not only to protect the reputation of their institution but the image ofscience itself. The philosopher Daniel Dennett argues that beliefs are socialforces in their own right, and that a belief in belief plays a vital role insustaining social institutions. Some beliefs need to be maintained for thegeneral good. For instance, democracy depends on maintaining a belief indemocracy. Likewise, the authority of science depends on maintaining a belief inscientific authority: ‘Since the belief in the integrity of scientificprocedures is almost as important as the actual integrity, there is always atension between a whistle-blower and the authorities, even when they know thatthey have mistakenly conferred scientific respectability on a fraudulentlyobtained result.’37[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1406603]One of the biggest cases of fraud to be exposed in physics in the twenty-firstcentury concerned Jan Hendrik Schön, a young researcher on nanotechnology atBell Laboratories, in New Jersey. He seemed brilliantly successful and amazinglyproductive, making breakthrough after breakthrough and receiving threeprestigious awards. But in 2002, several physicists noticed that the same dataappeared in different papers, apparently from different experiments. Aninvestigating committee found sixteen instances of scientific misconduct, mostlythe making up or recycling of data. As a result of the inquiry, twenty-eightpapers were withdrawn by scientific journals, including nine in Science andseven in Nature.38[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1407017] Schön’sco-authors were declared to be innocent, although they had shared in the creditwhen the results were thought to be genuine. Significantly, none of theseinstances of fraud was detected in the peer-review process.In another recent case, Marc Hauser, a Harvard professor of biology, was foundguilty of scientific misconduct by an official inquiry at Harvard in 2010. Hehad falsified or invented data in experiments on monkeys.39[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1407375] Again, hisdishonesty was not detected by peer reviewers, but came to light when a graduatestudent blew the whistle. Hauser is the author of a book called Moral Minds: TheNature of Right and Wrong (2007), in which he claims that morality is aninherited instinct, produced by evolution and independent of religion. Hauser isan atheist, and claheiiguims his findings support an atheist point of view. Inan interview a few months before his fraud was exposed, he said that hisresearch showed that ‘atheists are just as ethical as churchgoers’.40[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1407849]In an insightful study of fraud and deceit in science, William Broad andNicholas Wade showed that deceptions easily pass unchallenged as long as theresults are in accordance with prevalent expectations:> Acceptance of fraudulent results is the other side of that familiar coin,> resistance to new ideas. Fraudulent results are likely to be accepted in> science if they are plausibly presented, if they conform with prevailing> prejudices and expectations, and if they come from a suitably qualified> scientist affiliated with an elite institution. It is for the lack of all> these qualities that new ideas in science are likely to be resisted . . . For> the ideologists of science, fraud is taboo, a scandal whose significance must> be ritually denied on every occasion.41> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1408332] Scientists usually assume that fraud is rare and unimportant because science isself-correcting. Ironically, this complacent belief produces an environment inwhich deception can flourish.42[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1409016]Scepticism as a weapon Research scientists, aware of the limitations and ambiguities of their work,rarely claim to have achieved certainty, and they are routinely subject to peerreview. Scepticism is an essential part of science. But it can easily be turnedinto a weapon to attack opponents. For example, creationists, who denyevolution, use the techniques of critical thinking to highlight problems withevolutionary theory and expose weaknesses in the evidence, such as gaps in thefossil record. Is this because they are seeking truth? No. They believe theyalready know the truth. Scepticism is a weapon to defend their beliefs byattacking their opponents.The same techniques have been used for years by organised groups of skeptics toattack psychic research, parapsychology and alternative medicine. Their motivesare primarily ideological: they, too, believe they know the truth already –psychic phenomena are illusory and mechanistic medicine is the only kind thatreally works (see Chapters 9 and 10).Scepticism is also an important weapon in the defence of commercialself-interest. The publication in 1964 of the US Surgeon General’s reportSmoking and Health, based on a review of more than seven thousand scientific ndCapsOldstudies, made it clear that smoking caused lung cancer and increased therisk of suffering from emphysema (caused by the destruction of lung tissue),bronchitis and heart disease. The tobacco industry responded by setting up theCouncil for Tobacco Research, which funded projects at more than a hundredhospitals, universities and research labs. Many of these studies looked forcomplicating factors that would muddy the waters. As an executive of thecigarette company Brown and Williamson put it in 1969, ‘Doubt is our productsince it is the best means of competing with the “body of fact” that exists inthe mind of the general public.’By the late 1970s the tobacco industry was facing scores of lawsuits in theUnited States claiming personal injury from smoking. In 1979, Colin Stokes, theformer chairman of the R. J. Reynolds tobacco company, addressed a meeting oftobacco-company executives to report on progress. The attacks on smoking, hetold his audience, were based on studies that were either ‘incomplete . . . orrelied on dubious methods or hypotheses and faulty interpretations’.Tobacco-industry-funded research would supply new hypotheses and interpretationsto ‘develop a strong body of scientific data or opinion in defense of theproduct’. Above all, it would supply expert witnesses who could testify incourts.This strategy had worked in the past, and there was no reason to think it wouldnot work in the future. Stokes boasted, ‘Due to favorable scientific testimony,no plaintiff has ever collected a penny from any tobacco company in lawsuitsclaiming that smoking causes lung cancer or cardiovascular illness.’43[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1409432] In the endStokes’s strategy failed, but it staved off legal cases and delayed anti-smokinglegislation for years.The tobacco-industry strategy was adopted by numerous other industries defendingtoxic chemicals such as lead, mercury, vinyl chloride, chromium, benzene, nickeland many more. David Michaels, who was assistant secretary for environment,safety and health at the US Department of Energy in the late 1990s, sawfirst-hand how corporate interests worked to defeat the regulation of beryllium,a chemical element originally used to increase the yield of nuclear explosions,and later used in the manufacture of electronic and other consumer items.Following the discovery in the 1940s that beryllium can scar lung tissue, theAtomic Energy Commission established a safe level of exposure at two microgramsper cubic metre of air. By the 1990s it was clear that people were falling sickat levels far lower. When the federal government began the process of revisingexposure limits, the leading US producer of beryllium, Brush Wellman, fired backwith a series of reports suggesting that the physical properties of berylliumparticles might influence its toxicity. Thus no action should be taken untilthese factors could facck with be worked out more precisely. By ‘manufacturinguncertainty’, Brush Wellman staved off life-saving regulations.44[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1409993]Emphasising uncertainty on behalf of big business has become a big business initself. Specialised product-defence firms have increasingly skewed thescientific literature, created and magnified scientific uncertainty, andinfluenced policy decisions to the advantage of polluters and the manufacturersof dangerous products. In fact, the science behind any proposed public-health orenvironmental regulation is now almost always challenged, however powerful theevidence.The strategy of dismissing research conducted by mainstream scientists as ‘junkscience’ and elevating science conducted by product-defence specialists as‘sound science’ creates confusion and undermines the public’s confidence inscience’s ability to address public-health and environmental concerns.45[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1410408]All these issues took on a global significance in relation to climate change.Organised attempts to discredit the growing scientific consensus began in 1989,with a report attacking climate science by the George C. Marshall Institute,which was originally established in 1984 to defend President Reagan’s StrategicDefense Initiative (‘Star Wars’) against attacks by other scientists. TheMarshall report blamed global warming on increased activity by the sun,discounting the effect of greenhouse gases. This is not the place to review theongoing controversies, but the Marshall Institute and oil-industry-fundedscientists have continually muddied the waters of the debate.46[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1410687]In practice, the goal of scepticism is not the discovery of truth, but theexposure of other people’s errors. It plays an essential role in science,religion, scholarship, business, journalism, politics, the legal system andcommon sense. But we need to remember that it is often a weapon serving beliefor self-interest.Facts and values The illusion of scientific objectivity sustains the equally illusory distinctionbetween facts and values, on which institutional science has been based from theoutset. Francis Bacon (1561–1626) made a distinction between the innocentknowledge of nature, given by God to Adam before the Fall, and the knowledge ofgood and evil, or values, that caused the Fall (see page 13). But Bacon wasdisingenuous. He also coined the slogan ‘knowledge is power’, which has been thebasis on which scientists have solicited funds for their research from rero\">).governments and commercial companies ever since. Very few patrons of scientificresearch are interested in innocent knowledge for its own sake. When scientistssubmit grant proposals, they almost always claim that their research will beuseful. The facts they hope to discover will be of value for national defence,combating disease, increasing profits, promoting the yields of crops, improvingnavigation, increasing national prestige, or conferring other benefits. Thehoped-for values come before the facts; the promised values enable the researchto be funded and the facts to be established.47[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1411112]As we have seen in this chapter, facts and values are not clearly separated, andscientists are all too human. Nevertheless, scientists have found out far morethan anyone knew before, and the sciences have transformed the conditions ofhuman life. But the myths and ideology on which they are based have becomeunconscious habits of thought, creating unhelpful illusions that imprisonscientific enquiry and fuelling prejudice and dogmatism. In the final chapter, Isuggest that the best way forward is to recognise the plurality of sciences,natures and points of view.Questions for materialists Experimenters’ expectations are known to affect the results of research inpsychology, parapsychology and medicine, which is why researchers often useblind methodologies. Do you think that experimenter effects could play a role inother fields of science too? Do you think that scientists and science students should write in the passivevoice in their reports, or use the active voice? Most scientists publish only a small proportion of their results. Do you thinkthat this is likely to introduce serious biases into the scientific literature? How should scientists deal with ideologically, politically or commerciallymotivated scepticism?Summary Scientists are often imagined to achieve a superhuman level of objectivity. Thisbelief is sustained by the ideal of disembodied knowledge, unaffected byambitions, hopes, fears and other emotions. In the allegory of the cave,scientists venture forth into the light of objective truth and bring back theirdiscoveries for the benefit of ordinary people, trapped in a world of opinion,self-interest and illusion. By writing in the passive voice (‘a test tube wastaken’) rather than the active voice (‘I took a test tube’) scientists tried toemphasise their objectivity, but many have now abandoned this pretence.Scientists are, of course, people, and subject to the limitations ofpersonality, politics, peer-group pressures, fashion and the need for funding.Within medicine, psychology and parapsychology, most researchers recognise thattheir expectations can bias their results, which is why they often use blind ordouble-blind methodologies. In the so-called hard sciences, most researchersassume that blind methods bliectatare unnecessary. This is no more than anassumption, and needs to be tested experimentally. In most fields of science,researchers publish only a small proportion of their data, giving plenty ofscope for the selective presentation of results, and scientific journalsintroduce a further source of bias through their unwillingness to publishnegative findings. Fraud and deceit in science are rarely detected by thepeer-review system and usually come to light as a result of whistle-blowing.Scepticism is a healthy part of normal science but is often used as a weapon indefence of politically or ideologically motivated points of view, or to staveoff the regulation of toxic chemicals. Product-defence companies emphasiseuncertainty on behalf of big business, influencing policy decisions in favour oftheir clients. The separation of facts and values is usually impossible inpractice, and many scientists have to exaggerate the value of their research inorder to get it funded. Although the objectivity of science is a noble ideal,there is more hope of achieving it by recognising the humanity of scientists andtheir limitations than by pretending that science has a unique access to truth.12 Scientific Futures The sciences are entering a new phase. The materialist ideology that has ruledthem since the nineteenth century is out of date. All ten of its essentialdoctrines have been superseded. The authoritarian structure of the sciences, theillusions of objectivity and the fantasies of omniscience have all outlivedtheir usefulness.The sciences will have to change for another reason too: they are now global.Mechanistic science and the materialist ideology grew up in Europe, and werestrongly influenced by the religious disputes that obsessed Europeans from theseventeenth century onwards. But these preoccupations are alien to cultures andtraditions in many other parts of the world.In 2011, the worldwide expenditure on scientific and techno logical research anddevelopment was more than $1,000 billion, of which China spent $100 billion.1[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1411942] Asiancountries, especially China and India, now produce enormous numbers of scienceand engineering graduates.

Materialismgains its persuasive power from the technological applications of science. Butthe successes of these applications do not prove that this ideology is true.Penicillin will go on killing bacteria, jet planes will keep on flying andmobile telephones will still work if scientists move on to wider views ofnature.No one can foresee how the sciences will evolve, but I believe recognising that‘science’ is not one thing will facilitate their development. ‘Science’ hasgiven way to ‘the sciences’. By moving beyond physicalism, the status of physicshas changed. By freeing the sciences from the ideology of materialism, newopportunities for debate and dialogue open up, and so do new possibilities forresearch.From one science to many sciences Mechanistic science appeared to provide a simple, unified view of nature.Everything was made up of ultimate particles of matter whose properties andmovements were governed by eternal mathematical laws. Theoretical physicists arestill striving for a Theory of Everything and hope a unified formula willexplain all of reality in terms of the properties of subatomic particles and theforces that affect them (see Chapter 1). Everything can ultimately be reduced tophysics. As Lee Smolin expressed the conventional view, ‘Twelve particles andfour forces are all we need to explain everything in the known world.’6[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1414574]This naïve, old-fashioned reductionist faith bears no relation to the reality ofthe sciences. Physiologists Phyalign=\"jusdo not explain blood pressure in termsof subatomic particles but through the pumping activity of the heart, theelasticity of arterial walls, and so on. Linguists do not analyse languages interms of the movements of subatomic particles in the molecules in the airthrough which the sounds of voices travel: they study the patterns of words,grammars and meanings. Botanists do not study the evolution of flowers byprobing the atoms within them, but by comparing their structures andrelationships to living and extinct species. As the physicist John Ziman put it, > At successively higher levels of complexity, from elementary particles and> chemical molecules, through unicellular and multicellular organisms, to> self-aware human beings and their cultural institutions, we find systems> obeying entirely novel principles. The behaviour of such systems is not> predictable from the properties of their constituents, so distinct ‘languages’> are required to describe them scientifically. The plurality of our sciences is> thus an irreducible feature of the universe we live in.7> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1414992] There are many sciences and many natures. There is no one ‘scientific method’;different sciences use different methods.8[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1415409] Geologistsstudying rocks make different kinds of observations from astronomersinvestigating distant galaxies with radio telescopes, or from biochemistsstudying the properties of protein molecules, or from ecologists studyingrainforests. Some sciences involve experiments. Others do not. An astronomercannot manipulate a star to see how it responds, and a paleontologist cannottravel back in time to change the way sediments formed in the ocean aeons ago.Some kinds of science are highly mathematical, like theoretical physics; othersare not, like the taxonomy of dragonflies.‘Science’ is an abstraction. Scientists work within specialised disciplines, andstudents study one or more of the sciences. At university, they have to choosebetween a wide range of possibilities. For example, at Cambridge University in2011, a second-year student of natural sciences had to take three courses fromthe following list:9[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1415831] > animal biology> biochemistry and molecular biology> cell and developmental biology> chemistry A (mainly theoretical)> chemistry B (inorganic, organic and biological)> ecoini face=\"Minlogy> experimental psychology> geological sciences A (surface environments)> geological sciences B (subsurface processes)> history and philosophy of science> materials science> mathematics> neurobiology> pathology> pharmacology> physics A (mainly quantum physics)> physics B (mainly mechanics, electromagnetism and thermodynamics)> physiology> plant and microbial sciences Each of these courses is broadly based and covers a range of specialities; forexample, in animal biology, there are sections on ecology, brains and behaviour,insect biology, vertebrate evolutionary biology and evolutionary principles. Noone studies ‘science’, and fewer than 20 per cent study history and philosophyof science.Students absorb their general views about the nature of reality as implicitassumptions or from the writings of scientific popularisers. The doctrines ofmaterialism are not taught explicitly, and many students and scientists areunaware of their influence in shaping the practice and assumptions of theirfield. For example, most neuroscientists take it for granted that minds are inbrains and that memories are stored as material traces. These assumptions arenot treated as aspects of a philosophy of nature, or as hypotheses to be tested:they are part of the standard paradigm or consensus reality, protected by taboosagainst deviant thinking.Ironically, the fragmentation of the sciences into separate disciplines was thestimulus for coining the word ‘scientist’. At the third annual meeting of theBritish Association for the Advancement of Science in 1833, delegates expressedthe need for an umbrella term to cover their diverse interests, and WilliamWhewell, a mathematical astronomer, suggested ‘scientist’. The term was animmediate success in America. In Britain, where scientific research was stillfor the most part an expensive occupation for the leisured classes, ‘scientist’was slow to displace older terms like ‘man of science’, ‘naturalist’ or ‘exptstpart anerimental philosopher’. But as research increased and education expanded,there were more opportunities for employment and scientists gradually becamepaid professionals.10[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1416446]As the sciences grew in power and prestige, so did the need to assert theirstatus and authority. Patricia Fara, a historian of science, summarised thesituation in the nineteenth century thus: > Hungry for prestige, scientists wanted the authority to declare that they were> incontrovertibly right, that the knowledge they produced in their laboratories> was irrefutably correct. New specializations were being invented, but not all> of them were deemed worthy to be labeled science. Science was splintering into> disciplines – but disciplining meant controlling as well as teaching. Like> police guards patrolling national borders, scientists decreed which topics> should be inside the large domain they ruled over, and which should be> outlawed.11 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1417120] There are now hundreds of scientific specialities, all with their ownprofessional societies, journals and conferences. Specialists are famously saidto know more and more about less and less, and in the sciences this process hascontinued to produce ever more fragmented fields of knowledge, all with theirown specialised publications. By 2011, there were about twenty-five thousandscientific journals.12[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1417664]It is not the job of all these specialists to think about the underlyingphilosophical assumptions of the sciences. Historians and philosophers ofscience think about them, but they themselves are in a specialised field, oftentreated as of marginal interest to the real business of science. By default, theold materialist or physicalist ideology persists almost unquestioned. One of itseffects is to put physics at the top of the scientific hierarchy, becausephysicalism by definition states that everything is ultimately explicable interms of physics.Physicalism and physics Physics is the source of the vision of a simple, unified view of nature, andphysicists like to think that their discipline is the most fundamental, unifyingall the sciences. It is true that all material bodies are made up of quantumparticles, that all physical processes involve flows of energy and all physicalevents happen within the framework of space-time given by the universalgravitational field. But these aspects of physics leave out almost all thedetails we might want to know about the growth of pine trees, the effects of sexhormones, the social life of bees, the evolution of Indo-European languages, orthe design of computer software.Ironically, for those who would like to reduce everything to physics in theinterests of unifying nature, fyign=physics itself has resisted unification fordecades. Its two most fundamental theories, quantum mechanics and generalrelativity theory, are incompatible. General relativity applies to thelarge-scale structure of the universe – planets, stars and galaxies – anddescribes gravitation, one of the four ‘fundamental forces’. Quantum mechanicsdescribes the other three forces (electromagnetism and the strong and weaknuclear forces) and is most accurate at the atomic and subatomic scales. But thetwo theories start from different assumptions, and have resisted years ofefforts to unify them.13[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1418130]This is where superstring and M-theories come in, with ten and eleven dimensionsrespectively (see Chapter 3). But instead of giving a new unity to physics, theygenerate vast numbers of possible worlds. The price of unification is a runawayproliferation of universes. All except our own are unobserved and unobservable.What kind of unification is this? It looks more like the ultimate plurality.In mechanistic science, physics came first historically, growing out of thestudy of mechanics, astronomy and optics in medieval universities. Physics alsocomes first in term of prestige because of its claim to deal with the mostfundamental realities as well as the origin of all things in the Big Bang. Butthis priority is arbitrary. Other professional groups could claim that thestatus of their field is as high if not higher. Consciousness studies couldclaim primacy because physics happens in human minds and entirely depends onhuman consciousness. Maxwell’s equations and superstring theories do not exist‘out there’ as independent facts: they are mental constructs.Brain scientists then could claim that without neurophysiology and brainchemistry there could be no human consciousness. Proponents of linguistics couldargue that without language there would be no human culture; social scientistscould claim that without societies no physics could ever have happened;economists could claim that without a functioning economy no one would be ableto do physics. Meanwhile physiologists could point out that the brain is simplyone part of the body, and is dependent on the co-ordinated function of thewhole, including digestion, breathing, circulation, limbs, sense organs and soforth. Embryologists could argue that without embryological development therewould be no bodies and no physiology to start with, and hence no physicists, andgeneticists could argue that without genes there would be no embryology.Evolutionists could point to the evolutionary origins of humanity; ecologistscould stress the interdependence of all life; plant scientists could emphasisethat humans and all other animals ultimately depend on plants for food, and onthe biochemistry of photosynthesis; then physicists could re-enter the picturewith solar physics and astronomy, without which there would be nophotosynthesis. Engineers and technologists could argue that without scientificapparatus no accurate measurements would be possible, and without moderncommunications technologies and computers the sciences would not be able tofunction. And so on.No one can claim absolute primacy. Everything is interlinked. Nothing ispermanent and isolated from everything else. There is an interdependence of allthings and all levels of oll o\">Nrganisation. This sounds very like the Buddhistdoctrine of dependent origination or dependent arising, according to which allphenomena occur in a mutually interdependent web of cause and effect.The materialist philosophy and the primacy of physics go hand in hand. So do theinterdependence of all realities and the plurality of the sciences. The sciencesstill need unifying principles, but they need not come exclusively from physics.Unifying principles As well as the familiar unifying principles of physics, like forces, fields, andflows of energy there is the principle of organisation in nested hierarchies.Systems, or organisms, or holons, or morphic units at every level, are wholesmade up of parts, which in turn are wholes made up of parts. Crystals containmolecules, which contain atoms, which contain subatomic particles. Galacticclusters contain galaxies, which contain solar systems, which contain planets.Societies of organisms contain animals, which contain organs, which containtissues, which contain cells, which contain molecules, which contain atoms . . .(see Chapter 1).The hypothesis of morphic resonance provides another unifying principle: allself-organising systems draw upon a collective memory from similar systems oftheir kind (see Chapters 3, 6 and 7).But whenever we find general principles, their very generality hides the detailsof specific things. Sequoias, seaweeds and sunflowers all consist of the samechemical elements, capture the energy of light by photosynthesis, and havenested hierarchies of organisation. But the properties that make them similarfail to explain why each species is different.Then there is a freedom and individuality in all particular things. A field ofpotatoes contains tens of thousands of genetically identical plants; cultivatedpotatoes are clones. Yet despite the fact they are in the same field, planted atthe same time and experiencing the same weather, each plant is different fromits neighbours; and each leaf on each plant is different in detail from everyother leaf. Even the right and the left side of the same leaf have differentpatterns of veins and slightly different shapes.The more the sciences generalise, the less they explain particulars, and viceversa. The sciences need to include both general principles and many specialisedfields of study because the systems they investigate are so diverse, from quarksto galaxies, salt crystals to swallows’ nests, and lichens to languages.Scientific authority One problem with the authority of science is that dissent and debate aredangerous. The need to preserve authority means that disagreements are usuallykept behind the scenes. Scientists are reluctant to admit in p toMinublic thattheir supposed objectivity can be compromised. Even Thomas Kuhn’s theory ofscientific revolutions as paradigm shifts preserved the image of establishedauthority. In a scientific revolution, a new consensus reality replaces an oldone. Ideas that were at first revolutionary become the new orthodoxy, likecontinental drift in geology, or quantum theory in physics. These are not likethose rare political revolutions in which an autocratic system is overthrown andreplaced by democracy. They are more like revolutions in which one dictatorshipis replaced by another.In almost every other sphere of human life, there is not one but many points ofview. There are many languages, cultures, nations, philosophies, religions,sects, political parties, businesses and lifestyles. Only in the realm ofscience can we still find the old ethos of monopoly, universality and absoluteauthority that used to be claimed by the Roman Catholic Church. Catholic means‘universal’. At the Reformation, starting in 1517, the Roman Church lost itsmonopoly; now many other churches and ideologies coexist with it, includingatheism. But there is still only one universal science.In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when Western Europe was divided byconflicts between Roman Catholics and Protestants, the ideals of science andreason shone out as a path to truth that rose above sectarian religiousdisputes. The Enlightenment grew out of this attitude of respect for thesciences and the power of human reason, accompanied by an attitude ofcondescension towards orthodox religion. As John Brooke wrote,> Science was respected not simply for its results, but as a way of thinking. It> offered the prospect of enlightenment through the correction of past error,> and especially through its power to override superstition . . . [But] the> motivation of those who pitted science against religion often had little to do> with gaining intellectual freedom for the study of nature. It was often not> the natural philosophers [scientists] themselves, but thinkers with a social> or political grievance, who transformed the sciences into a secularising force> as they inveighed against clerical power.14> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1418541] Scientists claimed to obtain absolute truth by viewing the world as objectiveobservers.15 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1419087]In the black-and-white version of scientism, science is set apart from all otherhuman activities. Science alone is capable of yielding unassailable facts.16[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1419631] In thisidealised picture, scientists are exempt from the failings of the rest ofhumanity. They have a direct access to the truth. They are uniquely objective.The myths of disembodied knowledge and the allegory of the cave reinforce thisimage, and the prestige of the scientific priesthood adds the seal of authority.This authoritarian mentality is most obvious in relation to psychic phenomenaand alternative medicine (see Chapters 9 and 10). These are treated as heresies,rather than as valid areas for rational enquiry. Self-appointed inquisitions,like the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, try to ensure that the subjects arenot taken seriously in the respectable media, deprived of funding and excludedfrom university syllabuses. The belief that mechanistic medicine is the onlykind that really works has far-ranging political consequences. There are manymedical systems, including osteopathy, acupuncture, naturopathy and homeopathy,but only one kind, mechanistic medicine, is labelled ‘scientific’ and accorded astate-sponsored monopoly of power, scientific authority and financial support.Science as we know it is based on an ideal of objective truth, allowing only onetriumphant theory at a time. That is why scientists use phrases like ‘knockingthe final nail in the coffin of vitalism’ (see page 13) or ‘the final nail inthe coffin of the steady state theory’ (see page 67), gloating over theextermination of heresies. Much of the hypocrisy of science comes from assumingthe mantle of absolute truth, which is a relic of the ethos of absolutereligious and political power when mechanistic science was born. Of course,there are disagreements among scientists, and the sciences are continuallychanging and developing. But a monopoly of truth remains the ideal. Dissentingvoices are heretical. Fair public debates are alien to the culture of thesciences.In the Enlightenment ideal, science was a path to knowledge that would transformhumanity for the better. Science and reason were in the vanguard. These were,and still are, wonderful ideals, and they have inspired scientists forgenerations. They inspire me. I am all in favour of science and reason if theyare scientific and reasonable. But I am against granting scientists and thematerialist worldview an exemption from critical thinking and scepticalinvestigation. We need an enlightenment of the Enlightenment.17[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1419918]Scientific debates and dialogues An important ingredient in the process of reform would be to introduce debatesinto scientific institutions. This may seem simple and obvious, but such debatesare currently very rare. Debates are not yet part of the culture of science.One potential debate that underlies much of this book is the question of whetherthe phenomena of life and mind can be reduced to physics. Many biologistsbelieve they can. But many physicists are more doubtful. A debate on the subject‘Can the phenomena of life and mind be explained in terms of physics?’ couldhappen on almost every university campus.Another illuminating subject for debate would be the objectivity of thesciences. Universities and scientific institutes contain many people who puttheir faith in science and reason as a uniquely objective way of knowing. Manyshare Ricky Gervais’s belief that ‘Science is humble. It knows what it knows andit knows what it knd t doesn’t know. It bases its conclusions and beliefs onhard evidence.’18[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1420465] Manyuniversities also contain historians, sociologists and philosophers of sciencewho study how the sciences work in practice. They could debate how far the idealof scientific objectivity corresponds to the practices of the sciences.Then there are the ten fundamental dogmas of materialism discussed in Chapters 1to 10 of this book. Each of them would make a good topic for debate, and I havesuggested several further questions at the ends of all these chapters, most ofwhich could provide topics for more specialised debates or dialogues.If scientific debates became a normal feature of public life, university lifeand scientific conferences, the culture of science would change. Open questionswould become normal, instead of one side being right and the other heretical. Indemocratic politics we are used to an ongoing pluralism, and no single party hasa monopoly of public support. There are at least two sides to politicalarguments. In a democracy, the party in power cannot wipe out opposing viewswithout becoming totalitarian and destroying the very principle of democracy.But debates have their limitations, the main one being that one side wins thevote and the other loses. Likewise in courts of law, both sides argue theircase, but the verdict goes one way or the other, yes or no. This system isinvaluable when practical verdicts are needed. A judge and jury have to decidewhether to convict or release someone accused of a crime. A parliament or acongress has to decide what laws to enact. There has to be one clear law oranother, not a morass of legal ambiguity. Everyone has to drive on the right (asin the United States, France and Australia) or on the left (as in Britain, Indiaand Japan). The decision may be arbitrary, but it has to be left or right, notleft and right.Some decisions in science have a similar practical necessity: which areas ofresearch to fund, who gets a grant, whether to accept or reject a peer-reviewedpaper for publication in a journal. The decisions are usually made in private,but there is often some kind of debate among the people who make the decisions.All these practical debates, whether public or private, need to come to anagreed decision. But most situations are more ambiguous. At the frontiers ofscientific research, when answers are not yet known, there is an inevitableuncertainty. Physicists do not agree whether one particular ten-dimensionalstring theory is correct, as opposed to other string theories andeleven-dimensional M-theories. Several different theories coexist, all withtheir advocates. In exploratory or uncertain areas, the most productive approachis not through debate but dialogue. A dialogue is an exchange of ideas oropinions, a joint exploration. It is not necessary for one side to win. Ofcourse dialogues or conversations happen all the time in every walk of life,including among scientists, but if pubts,e most prlic dialogues became a regularaspect of scientific life they would encourage a culture of openness, even morethan formal debates.In my experience, the most productive dialogues are between two or threepeople.19 [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1420879]So-called panel discussions, a standard feature of scientific conferences, withfive to ten participants, rarely achieve anything. By the time each participanthas made an opening statement, there is usually no time left for discussion, andwith so many participants a clear focus is often impossible. Two or three peoplecan go further faster.Public participation in science funding Science has always been élitist and undemocratic, whether in monarchies,Communist states or liberal democracies. But it is currently becoming morehierarchical, not less so. In the nineteenth century, Charles Darwin was one ofmany independent researchers who, not reliant on grants, did provocativelyoriginal work. That kind of freedom and independence is rare today.Science-funding committees determine what can happen in research. The power inthose committees is concentrated in the hands of politically adept olderscientists, government officials and representatives of big business.In 2000, a government-sponsored survey in Britain on public attitudes to sciencerevealed most people believed that ‘Science is driven by business – at the endof the day it’s all about money.’ More than three-quarters of those surveyedthought, ‘It is important to have some scientists who are not linked tobusiness.’ More than two-thirds said, ‘Scientists should listen more to whatordinary people think.’ Worried about this public alienation, the Britishgovernment tried to engage the wider public in ‘a dialogue between science,policy-makers and the public’.20[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1423307] In officialcircles, the fashion shifted from the previous policy of the publicunderstanding of science to an ‘engagement’ model of science and society. Thepublic-understanding policy was based on a ‘deficit’ model, which saw simplefactual education as the key. Scientists should tell the public the truth, andthey would accept it gratefully. The trouble was that this policy did not work.The British public was told that mad cow disease was no threat to humans. Thenit was. Then they were told that genetically modified (GM) crops were good forthem, and many did not believe it. Throughout Europe there was a consumer revoltagainst GM foods, and proponents of the public understanding of science werepowerless to prevent it.‘Public engagement’ with science was supposed to be the answer. But this changein rhetoric made little difference in practice, and the funding of sciencecarried on as before. So did public distrust. And although there were severalwell-organised public-engagement exercises in the 2000s, policy-makers usuallyignored them.21[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1423749]Some of the few examples of effective engagement are in medicine, where patientactivist groups, like AIDS activists, have already had a major impact onresearch and treatment.22[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1424162] There are manykinds of patient group. Some are primarily mutual help organisations, whileothers are highly politicised. Sociologists who study these groups havesuggested that they exemplify the emergence of ‘scientific citizenship’.23[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1424512] However, somepatient groups are funded by the pharmaceutical companies, who stand to gainfrom campaigns for health providers to pay for expensive drugs. But despite thisexploitation of some patient groups, many of these organisations demonstratethat lay people are well able to participate in technical discussions.Medical research charities, like Cancer Research UK, the Meningitis ResearchFoundation and the Stroke Association, have a direct influence on research byfunding it. In the UK there are 130 such charities,24[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1425047] andcollectively they contribute about one-third of all public expenditure onmedical and health research. Some are governed by boards or committees mainlycomposed of lay people.The interests of patient activist groups and medical charities are confined toparticular diseases and disabilities. For people without such an intense focus,there is at present little possibility of engaging with scientific research. Isuggest an experiment that would make more widespread public engagement areality. Spend one per cent of the science budget on research that actuallyinterests people outside the scientific and medical professions. At present,money is allocated according to agendas set by committees of establishmentscientists, corporate executives and government bureaucrats. In the UK, theseofficial funding bodies include the Medical Research Council, the Biotechnologyand Biological Sciences Research Council and the Engineering and PhysicalSciences Research Council. The UK government’s scientific research budget isabout £4.6 billion per year,25[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1425426] so the one percent fund would contain about £46 million a year.What questions capable of being answered by scientific research are of publicinterest? The simplest way to find out would be to ask for suggestions. Theycould come from membership organisations like the National Trust, the BritishBeekeepers’ Association, the National Society of Allotment and LeisureGardeners, Oxfam, the Consumers’ Association, the Women’s Institute, as well aslocal authorities and trade unions. Potential subjects for research would bediscussed in these orgd iAllotmanisations’ newsletters, in specialist magazines,newspapers and in online forums. Their research suggestions would be submittedto the body that administers the one per cent fund, which could be called theOpen Research Centre.The Open Research Centre would be independent of the science establishment, andgoverned by a board representing a wide range of interests, includingnon-governmental organisations and voluntary associations. Like some of themedical research charities, most of its members would be non-scientists. Basedon the suggestions it received, it would publish a list of the research areas inwhich grants were available, and would invite proposals that would be evaluatedby experts in the usual way. It would not fund research already covered by theregular science budget.This new venture, open to democratic input and public participation, wouldinvolve no additional expenditure, but would have a big effect on people’sinvolvement in science and innovation.26[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1425839] I expect itwould make the sciences more attractive to young people, stimulate publicinterest in scientific thinking, and help break down the depressing alienationmany people feel from the sciences. It would enable scientists themselves tothink more freely. And it would be more fun.In addition, there could be other engaging methods of funding scientificprojects. One possibility would be a reality TV show in which proposals forresearch of widespread public interest are submitted to a panel, rather like theBBC TV show Dragons’ Den, in which entrepreneurs pitch for investments from apanel of business people. The panel, including both scientists andnon-scientists, would have real money to give out as grants – say £1 million ayear, taken from the one per cent fund.The greater the diversity of funding sources, the greater the freedom of thesciences. Fortunately, there is already a range of non-governmental sources offunding including businesses and charitable foundations, and some of themalready fund areas of research that are taboo for official funding agencies.Foundations have more freedom to adapt to new circumstances than governmentfunding agencies, and may be in the best position to facilitate the opening upof new lines of research.Learning from other cultures The sciences as we know them are weakest when they are dealing with, or tryingto avoid, the subjective aspects of reality. Our own experience of qualitieslike the smell of a rose or the sound of a band has been stripped away, leavingonly odourless molecular structures and the physics of vibrations. The scienceshave tried to confine themselves to I-it relationships, a third-person view ofthe world. They have done their best to leave out I-you relationships,second-person experiences, as well as first-person experiences, our personalexperiences. Our inner life, including our dreams, hopes, loves, hates, pains,excitements, intentions, joys and sorrows, is reduced to charts of readings fromelectrodes, as in electroencephalograms (EEGs), or changes in the levels of thechemicals at nerve endings, or 2-D brain scans on computer screens. By thesemeans a mind becomes an ‘it’, an object.But instead of trying to reduce minds to objects, what if all self-organisingsystems are subjects? As discussed in Chapter 4, some philosophers propose thatmaterialism implies panpsychism, meaning that self-organising systems likeatoms, molecules, crystals, plants and animals have points of view, or innerlives, or subjective experience. Most people who keep companion animals take forgranted that their dog or their cat or their parrot or their horse hassubjective experiences, like emotions, desires and fears. But what about snakes?Or oysters? Or plants? We can try to imagine their inner lives, but it isdifficult to do so. Yet in traditional hunter-gatherer societies all around theworld, specialists in communication with non-human organisms form connectionswith a wide range of animals and plants. Shamans link themselves to animals andplants through their minds or spirits, and find out useful information by doingso. They are said to know where animals are to be found, and they help hunters.They know which plants are useful in healing, or as mind-altering brews.For centuries, among scientists and educated people in the West, shamanicknowledge has been dismissed as primitive, animistic or superstitious.Anthropologists have studied the social roles of shamans, but most of them haveassumed that if shamans have any valid knowledge of the natural world, it hasnot been gained subjectively but rather by ‘normal’ sense-based means, or bytrial and error. They think that if shamans have discovered herbs that work, orvisionary brews like ayahuasca, traditionally used in parts of the Amazonregion, they have done so by trying out various plants at random. But shamansthemselves say that this knowledge has come from ‘the plant teachers’.27[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1427337]What if shamans really do have ways of learning about plants and animals thatare completely unknown to scientists? What if they have explored the naturalworld for many generations, discovering ways of communicating with the worldaround them that depend on subjective rather than objective methods? TheBrazilian anthropologist Viveiros de Castro summarised the difference: > Objectification is the name of our game . . . The form of the other is the> thing. Amerindian shamanism is guided by the opposite ideal. To know is to> personify, to take on the point of view of that which must be known. Shamanic> knowledge aims at something that is a someone – another subject. The form of> the other is the person. What I am defining here is what anthropologists of> yore used to call animism, an attitude that is far more than an idle> metaphysical tenet, for the attribution of soul to animals and other so-called> natural beings entails a specific way of dealing with them.28> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1427751] For most of human history, people have lived as hunter-gatherers, and have onlysurvived because they knew how to hunt and had a deep understanding of theanimals they hunted. They only survived because they knew which plants wereedible, and where and when to find them. Their knowledge worked. We stillbenefit from their discoveries. About 70 per cent of our drugs are ultimatelyderived from plants (see Chapter 10), and much of the knowledge of these plants’medicinal properties was traditional, discovered long ago in pre-scientificcultures.For much of the twentieth century, scientific psychologists tried to learn aboutminds objectively, from outside, by studying measurable behaviour andquantifiable responses. In prototypical behaviourist experiments, rats in cageslearned to press levers to obtain rewards in the form of food pellets or toavoid punishments like electric shocks. In more recent research, the emphasishas mainly been on the study of brains and of computer models of brain activity.In the mystical traditions of both East and West, people explored the nature ofminds through long periods of meditation, discovering how their mental processeswork from within. By contrast, academic psychologists and cognitive scientistsusually carry out their studies with paid subjects, generally undergraduatestudents, who have no professional training in observing or reporting mentalprocesses. As the Buddhist scholar B. Alan Wallace put it: > By leaving introspection in the hands of amateurs, scientists guarantee that> the direct observation of the mind remains at the level of folk psychology . .> . Cognitive scientists have taken on the challenge of understanding mental> processes, but unlike all other natural scientists, they receive no> professional training in observing the realities that constitute their field> of enquiry.29> [CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1428176] Today there are many teachers of meditation, mainly rooted in the Hindu andBuddhist traditions, and some scientists have begun to explore their own mindsfor themselves.30[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1428852]Scientific investigations of the interactions of minds and bodies are asbackward as the investigation of minds from within. In medicine, there is agrowing recognition of the effects of belief on healing, as shown in the placeboresponse, and studies using biofeedback show that people can learn to gainconscious control over their blood flow and their fingers and other aspects oftheir physiology that are normally regulated unconsciously (see Chapter 10). Butthese achievements are elementary compared with the feats of Indian yogis, whodemonstrate a remarstral kable voluntary influence on their digestive andcirculatory systems. One of the means by which they acquire these abilities isthrough the control of breathing. Breathing is controlled by both the voluntaryand involuntary nervous systems, and yogic breathing exercises may provide abridge between them.31[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1429265]In China, the chi gung or qigong tradition likewise places a strong emphasis onbreathing practices, and has many applications in traditional Chinese medicineand in the martial arts. Both prana in the Indian tradition and chi in theChinese are translated into English as ‘energy’ but they differ from the conceptof energy in mechanistic physiology. There are serious problems with thestandard scientific dogma of energy conservation in living organisms (seeChapter 2) and a re-examination of human energy balances is long overdue. Thisis one area in which it might be possible to bring together these differenttraditions in a new, integrated understanding.In many parts of Africa and the India subcontinent, women carry heavy loads ontheir heads, and can do so over great distances. Studies of women in East Africahave shown that they can carry up to 20 per cent of their body weight ‘forfree’, without any extra expenditure of energy compared with just walking. Theycan also carry up to 70 per cent of their body weight using 50 per cent lessenergy than an American army recruit with a backpack. This skill is not simply amatter of putting the load on the head, but involves a special kind of gait.32[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1429676] But is aspecial gait enough to explain this remarkable efficiency?Their abilities also raise a practical question. Why are teenagers not taughtthis skill in physical-education classes all over the world? The ability tocarry loads efficiently is useful. At some stage in their lives, modern peoplemay need to carry loads over rougher terrain than they encounter in airports,when wheeled suitcases will not work. The main reason for ignoring this skill issocial status. Women who carry loads on their heads are of low status, and livein developing countries.Arrogance and snobbery make most modern, scientifically educated people feelsuperior to all pre-scientific cultures, including their own. In the latenineteenth century, these attitudes were given a scientific justification interms of evolution and social progress. Anthropologists, like James Frazer(nineteen size=\"+1\" face=\"MinionRegulSmalCapsOldsFigu\">1854–1941), thought thathuman beliefs progressed through three stages: animism, religion and science.Primitive societies were animistic and child-like, pervaded by magical thinking.Religions like Christianity represented a higher stage of evolution, but stillincluded many primitive elements. But both animism and religion were supersededby science, the ultimate level of human understanding.In this context, why would modern people want to learn to carry loads on theirheads, like uneducated African women? Or why would they have anything to learnfrom pre-scientific traditions like yoga and chi gung? And what have shamans tooffer but mumbo-jumbo?New dialogues with religions As the sciences free themselves from the constrictions of materialism, many newpossibilities arise. And many of them raise new possibilities for dialogues withreligious traditions.33[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1430212] Here are a fewexamples.Statistical research has shown that people who attend religious servicesregularly tend to live longer, have better health and are less prone todepression than those who do not. Also, the practices of prayer and meditationoften have beneficial effects on health and longevity (see Chapter 10). How dothese practices work? Are the effects purely psychological or sociological? Ordoes the connection with a larger spiritual reality confer a greater capacity toheal and an enhancement of wellbeing?If organisms at all levels of complexity are in some sense alive with their ownpurposes, this implies that the earth, the solar system, our galaxy and, indeed,all the stars have lives and purposes of their own. And so may the entireuniverse (see Chapter 1). The cosmic evolutionary process may have inherentpurposes or ends, and the cosmos may have a mind or consciousness. Since theuniverse itself is evolving and developing, the mind or consciousness of theuniverse must be evolving and developing too. Is this cosmic mind the same asGod? Perhaps only if God is conceived of in a pantheistic spirit as the soul ormind of the universe, or of nature. In the Christian tradition, the world soulis not identical with God. For example, the early Christian theologian Origen(c. 184–253) thought of the world soul as the Logos, endlessly creative, whichgave rise to the world and the processes of development within it. The Logos wasan aspect of God, not the whole of God, whose being transcended the universe.34[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1430861] If instead ofone universe there are many, then the divine being would include and transcendthem all.The universe is evolving and is the arena of continuing creativity. Creativityis not confined to the origin of the universe, as in deism (see Chapter 1), butis an ongoing part of the evolutionary process, expressed in all realms ofnature, including human societies, cultures and minds. Although the creativityexpressed in all these realms may have an ultimately divine source, there is noneed to think of God as an external designing mind. In the Judaeo-Christiantradition, God imbued the natural world with creativity too, as in the firstchapter in the Book of Genesis, where he called forth life from the earth andthe seas (Genesis 1: 11, 20, 24) – a very different image from the engineeringGod of a mechanistic universe. And in a creative, evolving universe there is noreason why the appearance of matter and energy should be confined to the veryfirst instant, as in the standard Big Bang theory. Indeed, some cosmologistspropose that the continued expansion of the universe is driven by the ongoingcreation of ‘dark energy’ from the universal gravitational field or from the‘quintessence field’ (see Chapter 2).If the laws of nature are more like habits, and there is an inherent memorywithin the natural world (see Chapter 3), how does this relate to the principleof karma in Hinduism and Buddhism, a chain of cause and effect that implies akind of memory in nature? In some schools of thought, as in the Lankavatra Sutraof Mahayana Buddhism, there is a cosmic or universal memory.35[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1431410] Likewise, ifbiological inheritance largely depends on morphic resonance and a collectivememory within each species (see Chapter 6), how does this relate to doctrines ofreincarnation or rebirth?If minds are not stored as material traces in brains, but depend on a process ofresonance, then memories themselves may not be extinguished at death, althoughthe body through which they are normally retrieved decays. Is there some otherway in which these memories can continue to act? Can some non-bodily form ofconsciousness survive the death of the body and still gain access to anindividual’s memories, conscious or unconscious, as all religions suppose?If minds are not confined to brains, how do these human minds relate to theminds of higher-level systems of organisation, like the solar system, thegalaxy, the universe and the mind of God? Are mystical experiences just whatthey seem to be: connections between human minds and larger, more inclusiveforms of consciousness?If human minds, individually and collectively, make contact with higher-levelminds, including the ultimate consciousness of God, to what extent can theyinfluence the evolutionary process, or be influenced by the divine will? In anevolutionary, living universe, are humans merely part of an unfolding process onone isolated planet, or does human consciousness play a larger role in cosmicevolution, in some way connected to minds in other parts of the universe?All religious traditions grew up in a pre-scientific era. The sciences haverevealed far more of the natural world than anyone could have imagined in thepast. For example, only in the nineteenth century were the great sweep ofbiological evolution and the aeons of geological times recognised, and only inthe twentieth century were galaxies outside our own discovered, along with thevast expanse of time from the Big Bang to the present. The sciences evolve, andso do religions. No religion is the same today as it was at the time of itsfounder. Instead of the bitter conflicts and mutual distrust caused by thematerialist worldview, we are entering an era in which sciences and religionsmay enrich each other through shared explorations.Open questions As the taboos of materialism lose their power, new scientific questions can beasked and, hopefully, answered.Throughout this book, I have suggested a range of new possibilities forresearch: for example, the use of comparative effective research on conventionaland ‘alternative’ cures for conditions such as lower back pain, migraines andcold sores (see Chapter 10); experiments on experiments to find out howsignificantly experimenters’ expectations influence their results in the ‘hard’sciences (see Chapter 11); an analysis of existing data to find out if theUniversal Gravitational Constant varies (see Chapter 3); a mass-participationinvestigation to find out if earthquakes and tsunamis can be predicted on thebasis of animal premonitions (see Chapter 9); and a prize challenge to find outif any alternative energy technologies or ‘over unity’ devices actually work(see Chapter 2).Existing lines of scientific research will, of course, continue. Nothing changesvery fast when big institutions, vast amounts of money and large numbers of jobsare involved: there are now more than seven million scientific researchersworldwide, producing 1.58 million publications a year.36[CR%211PJK754EG14PF6EZMM3TKAQK1N2A_split_013.html#filepos1431823] What I amsuggesting is that a small fraction of these resources is devoted to exploringnew questions. New discoveries are more likely to happen if we venture off thewell-trodden paths of conventional research, and if we open up questions thathave been suppressed by dogmas and taboos.The delusion that science has already answered the fundamental questions chokesoff the spirit of enquiry. The illusion that scientists are superior to the restof humanity means that they have little to learn from anyone else. They needother people’s financial support, but they do not need to listen to anyone lessscientifically educated than themselves. In return for their privilegedposition, scientists will deliver knowledge and power over nature, transforminghumanity and the earth.The materialist agenda was once liberating but is now depressing. Those whobelieve in it are alienated from their own experience; they are cut off from allreligious traditions; and they are prone to suffer from a sense of disconnectionand isolation. Meanwhile, the power unleashed by scientific knowledge is causingthe mass extinction of other species, and endangering our own.The realisation that the sciences do not know the fundamental answers leads tohumility rather than arrogance, and openness rather than dogmatism.Much remains to be discovered and rediscovered, including wisdom.Notes Preface > 1.
