Hewanted to cook, eat, and be gone. He wished he were grown so that he coulddecide when to eat, or whether to bother eating at all. There was something heneeded to do, a thing that scared him. Waiting just made it worse.Matty was no longer a boy, but not yet a man. Sometimes, standing outside thehomeplace, he measured himself against the window. Once he had stood only to itssill, his forehead there, pressing into the wood, but now he was so tall hecould see inside without effort. Or, moving back in the high grass, he could seehimself reflected in the glass pane. His face was becoming manly, he thought,though childishly he still enjoyed making scowls and frowns at his ownreflection. His voice was deepening.He lived with the blind man, the one they called Seer, and helped him. Hecleaned the homeplace, though cleaning bored him. The man said it was necessary.So Matty swept the wooden floor each day and straightened the bedcovers: neatlyon the man's bed, with haphazard indifference on his own, in the room next tothe kitchen. They shared the cooking. The man laughed at Matty's concoctions andtried to teach him, but Matty was impatient and didn't care about the subtletyof herbs.\"We can just put it all together in the pot,\" Matty insisted. \"It all goestogether in our bellies anyway.\"It was a long-standing and friendly argument. Seer chuckled. \"Smell this,\" hesaid, and held out the pale green shoot that he'd been chopping.Matty sniffed dutifully. \"Onion,\" he said, and shrugged. \"We can just throw itin.\"Or,\" he added, \"we don't even need to cook it. But then our breath stinks.There's a girl promised she'd kiss me if I have sweet breath. But I think she'steasing.\"The blind man smiled in the boy's direction. \"Teasing's part of the fun thatcomes before kissing,\" he told Matty, whose face had flushed pink withembarrassment.\"You could trade for a kiss,\" the blind man suggested with a chuckle. \"Whatwould you give? Your fishing pole?\"\"Don't. Don't joke about the trading.\"\"You're right, I shouldn't. It used to be a lighthearted thing. But now—you'reright, Matty. It's not to be laughed at anymore.\"\"My friend Ramon went to the last Trade Mart, with his parents. But he won'ttalk about it.\"\"We won't then, either. Is the butter melted in the pan?\"Matty looked. The butter was bubbling slightly and golden brown. \"Yes.\"\"Add the onion, then. Stir it so it doesn't burn.\" Matty obeyed.\"Now smell that,\" the blind man said. Matty sniffed. The gently sautéing onionreleased an aroma that made his mouth water.\"Better than raw?\" Seer asked.\"But a bother,\" Matty replied impatiently. \"Cooking's a bother.\"\"Add some sugar. Just a pinch or two. Let it cook for a minute and then we'llput the rabbit in. Don't be so impatient, Matty. You always want to rush things,and there's no need.\"\"I want to go out before night comes. I have something to check. I need to eatsupper and get out there to the clearing before it's dark.\"The blind man laughed. He picked up the rabbit parts from the table, and asalways, Matty was amazed at how sure his hands were, how he knew just wherethings had been left. He watched while the man deftly patted flour onto thepieces of meat and then added the rabbit to the pan. The aroma changed when themeat sizzled next to the softened onion. The man added a handful of herbs.\"It doesn't matter to you if it's dark or light outside,\" Matty told him,scowling, \"but I need the daylight to look at something.\"\"What something is that?\" Seer asked, then added, \"When the meat has browned,add some broth so it doesn't stick to the pan.\"Matty obeyed, tilting into the pan the bowl of broth in which the rabbit hadbeen boiled earlier. The dark liquid picked up chunks of onion and choppedherbs, and swirled them around the pieces of meat. He knew to put the lid onnow, and to turn the fire low. The stew simmered and he began to set the plateson the table where they would have their supper together.He hoped the blind man would forget that he had asked what something. He didn'twant to tell. Matty was puzzled by what he had hidden in the clearing. Itfrightened him, not knowing what it meant. He wondered for a moment whether hecould trade it away.***When, finally, the supper dishes were washed and put away, and the blind man satin the cushioned chair and picked up the stringed instrument that he played inthe evening, Matty inched his way to the door, hoping to slip away unnoticed.But the man heard everything that moved. Matty had known him to hear a spiderscurry from one side of its web to another.\"Off to Forest again?\"Matty sighed. No escaping. \"I'll be back by dark.\"\"Could be. But light the lamp, in case you're late. After dark it's nice to havewindow light to aim for. I remember what Forest was like at night.\"\"Remember from when?\"The man smiled. \"From when I could see. Long before you were born.\"\"Were you scared of Forest?\" Matty asked him. So many people were, and with goodreason.\"No. It's all an illusion.\"Matty frowned. He didn't know what the blind man meant. Was he saying that fearwas an illusion? Or that Forest was? He glanced over. The blind man was rubbingthe polished wooden side of his instrument with a soft cloth. His thoughts hadturned to the smooth wood, though he couldn't see the golden maple with itscurly grain. Maybe, Matty thought, everything was an illusion to a man who hadlost his eyes.Matty lengthened the wick and checked the lamp to be certain there was oil. Thenhe struck a match.\"Now you're glad I made you clean the soot from the lamp chimneys, aren't you?\"The blind man didn't expect an answer. He moved his fingers on the strings,listening for the tone. Carefully, as he did most evenings, he tuned theinstrument. He could hear variations in sounds that seemed to the boy to be allthe same. Matty stood in the doorway for a moment, watching. On the table, thelamp flickered. The man sat with his head tilted toward the window so that thesummer early-evening light outlined the scars on his face. He listened, thenturned a small screw on the back of the instrument's wooden neck, then listenedagain. Now he was concentrating on the sounds, and had forgotten the boy. Mattyslipped away.***Heading for the path that entered Forest at the edge of Village, Matty went by aroundabout way so that he could pass the home of the schoolteacher, agood-hearted man with a deep red stain that covered half of his face. Birthmark,it was called. When Matty was new to Village, he had sometimes found himselfstaring at the man because he had never known anyone before with such a mark.Where Matty had come from, flaws like that were not allowed. People were put todeath for less.But here in Village, marks and failings were not considered flaws at all. Theywere valued. The blind man had been given the true name Seer and was respectedfor the special vision that he had behind his ruined eyes.The schoolteacher, though his true name was Mentor, was sometimes affectionatelycalled \"Rosy\" by the children because of the crimson birthmark that spreadacross his face. Children loved him. He was a wise and patient teacher. Matty,just a boy when he first came here to live with the blind man, had attendedschool full time for a while, and still went for added learning on winterafternoons. Mentor had been the one who taught him to sit still, to listen, andeventually to read.He passed by the schoolteacher's house not to see Mentor, or to admire thelavish flower garden, but in hopes of seeing the schoolteacher's prettydaughter, who was named Jean and who had recently teased Matty with the promiseof a kiss. Often she was in the garden, weeding, in the evenings.But tonight there was no sign of her, or her father. Matty saw a fat spotted dogsleeping on the porch, but it appeared that no one was at home.Just as well, he thought. Jean would have delayed him with her giggles andteasing promises—which always came to nothing, and Matty knew that she made themto all the boys—and he should not even have made the side trip in hopes ofseeing her.He took a stick and drew a heart in the dirt on the path beside her garden.Carefully he put her name in the heart, and his own below it. Maybe she wouldsee it and know he had been there, and maybe she would care.\"Hey, Matty! What are you doing?\" It was his friend Ramon, coming around thecorner. \"Have you had supper? Want to come eat with us?\"Quickly Matty moved toward Ramon, hiding the heart traced in the dirt behind himand hoping his friend wouldn't notice it. It was always fun, in a way, to go toRamon's homeplace, because his family had recently traded for something called aGaming Machine, a large decorated box with a handle that you pulled to makethree wheels spin around inside. Then a bell rang and the wheels stopped at asmall window. If their pictures matched, the machine spit out a chunk of candy.It was very exciting to play.Sometimes he wondered what they had sacrificed for the Gaming Machine, but onenever asked.\"We ate already,\" he said. \"I have to go someplace before it gets dark, so weate early.\"\"I'd come with you, but I have a cough, and Herbalist said I shouldn't runaround too much. I promised to go right home,\" Ramon said. \"But if you wait,I'll run and ask...\"\"No,\" Matty replied quickly. \"I have to go alone.\"\"Oh, it's for a message?\"It wasn't, but Matty nodded. It bothered him a little to lie about small things.But he always had; he had grown up lying, and he still found it strange that thepeople in this place where he now lived thought lying was wrong. To Matty, itwas sometimes a way of making things easier, more comfortable, more convenient.\"See you tomorrow, then.\" Ramon waved and hurried on toward his own homeplace.***Matty knew the paths of Forest as if he had made them. And indeed, some of themwere of his making, over the years. The roots had flattened as he made his wayhere and there, seeking the shortest, safest route from place to place. He wasswift and quiet in the woods, and he could feel the direction of things withoutlandmarks, in the same way that he could feel weather and was able to predictrain long before the clouds came or there was a shift in wind. Matty simplyknew.Others from Village rarely ventured into Forest. It was dangerous for them.Sometimes Forest closed in and entangled people who had tried to travel beyond.There had been terrible deaths, with bodies brought out strangled by vines orbranches that had reached out malevolently around the throats and limbs of thosewho decided to leave Village. Somehow Forest knew. Somehow, too, it knew thatMatty's travels were benign and necessary. The vines had never reached out forhim. The trees seemed, sometimes, almost to part and usher him through.\"Forest likes me,\" he had proudly commented once to the blind man.Seer had agreed. \"Maybe it needs you,\" he pointed out.The people needed Matty, too. They trusted him to know the paths, to be safe onthem, and to do the errands that required traveling through the thick woods withits complicated, mazelike turnings. He carried messages for them. It was hisjob. He thought that when it came time to be assigned his true name, Messengerwould be the choice. He liked the sound of it and looked forward to taking thattitle.But this evening Matty was not carrying or collecting a message, though he hadfibbed and told Ramon so. He headed to a clearing he knew of, a place that layjust beyond a thick stand of bristly pines. Deftly he jumped a small brook, thenturned off the worn path to proceed between two trees, pushing his way through.These trees had grown fast in recent years, and now the clearing was completelyconcealed and had become Matty's private place.He needed privacy for this thing he was discovering about himself: a place totest it in secret, to weigh his own fear for what it meant.It was dim in the clearing. Behind him, the sun was starting to set overVillage, and the light that reached down through Forest was pinkish and pale.Matty made his way across the mossy ground of the clearing to a thicket of tallferns near the base of a tree. He squatted there and listened, leaning his headtoward the ferns. Softly he made a sound, one he had practiced; a brief momentlater, he heard the sound he had both hoped and dreaded to hear, in response.He reached gently into the undergrowth and lifted out a small frog. From hishand, it looked up at him through bulging, unafraid eyes, and made the soundagain: churrump.Churrump.Churrump.Matty repeated the frog's throaty sound, as if they were conversing. Though hewas nervous, the back-and-forth sounds made him laugh a little. He examined theslick green body carefully. The frog made no effort to leap from his hand. Itwas passive in his palm, and the deep translucent throat quivered.He found what he was looking for. In a way, he had hoped he would not. His lifewould be easier, Matty knew, if the little frog were unmarked and ordinary. Butit was not; he had known it would not be; and he knew that things were allshifting for him now. His future had taken a new and secret turn. It was not thefrog's fault, he realized, and gently he replaced the small green creature inthe tall ferns and watched the fronds tremble as it moved away, unaware. Herealized that he was trembling as well.***Returning to Village along the path that was deep in shadows now, Matty heardsounds from the area beyond the marketplace. At first he thought in surprisethat people were singing. Singing was common in Village, but usually notoutdoors, not in the evening. Puzzled, he paused and listened. It was notsinging at all, Matty realized, but the rhythmic and mournful sound they calledkeening, the sound of loss. He set aside his other worries and began to hurrythrough the evening's last light to the homeplace, where the blind man would bewaiting and would explain."},{"pageContent":"2\"Did you hear about what happened to Gatherer last night? He tried to go backbut it had been too long.\" Ramon and Matty, carrying their fishing rods, had metfor an excursion to catch salmon, and Ramon was bursting with the news.Matty winced at what his friend said. So Gatherer had been taken by Forest. Hewas a cheerful man who loved children and small animals, who smiled often andtold boisterous jokes.Ramon spoke in the self-important tone of one who likes being a conveyor ofnews. Matty was very fond of his friend but sometimes suspected that his truename might eventually turn out to be Boaster.\"How do you know?\"\"They found him last night on the path behind the schoolhouse. After I left you,I heard the commotion. I saw them bring his body in.\"\"I heard the noise. Seer and I thought it must be someone taken.\"Matty had arrived at the homeplace the night before to find the blind manpreparing for bed and listening attentively to the low collective moan, clearlya large number of people grieving.\"Someone's been lost,\" the blind man had said with a worried look, pausing whileunbuckling his shoes. He sat on his bed, dressed in his nightshirt.\"Should I take a message to Leader?\"\"He'll know already, from the sound. It's a keening.\"\"Should we go?\" Matty asked him. In a way, he had wanted to. He had neverattended a keening. But in another way, he was relieved to see the blind manshake his head no.\"They have enough. It sounds like a good-sized group; I can hear at leasttwelve.\"As always, Matty was amazed at the capacity of the blind man's perceptions. Hehimself heard only the chorus of wails. \"Twelve?\" he asked, and then teased,\"Are you sure it's not eleven, or thirteen?\"\"I hear at least seven women,\" the blind man said, not noticing that Matty hadintended it as a joke. \"Each has a different pitch. And I think five men, thoughone is quite young, maybe your age. The voice is not as deep as it will belater. It may be that friend of yours; what's his name?\"\"Ramon?\"\"Yes. I think I hear Ramon's voice. He's hoarse.\"\"Yes, he has a cough. He's taking herbs for it.\"Now, recalling it, Matty asked his friend, \"Did you keen? I think we may haveheard you.\"\"Yes. They had enough. But since I was there, they let me join. I have thiscough, though, so my voice wasn't very good. I only went because I wanted to seethe body. I've never seen one.\"\"Of course you have. You were with me when we watched them lay out Stocktenderfor burial. And you saw that little girl after she fell in the river and theypulled her out drowned. I remember you were there.\"\"I meant entangled,\" Ramon explained. \"I've seen plenty of dead. But till lastnight I never saw one entangled.\"Neither had Matty. He had only heard of it. Entangling happened so rarely thathe had begun to think of it as a myth, something from the past. \"What was itlike? They say it's hideous.\"Ramon nodded. \"It was. It looked as if first the vines grabbed him by the neckand pulled tight. Poor Gatherer. He had grabbed at them to pull loose but thenthey curled around his hands as well. He was completely entangled. The look onhis face was fearsome. His eyes were open but twigs and all had started to enterunder the lids. And they were in his mouth, too. I could see something wrappedaround his tongue.\"Matty shuddered. \"He was such a nice man,\" he said. \"He always tossed berries tous when he was out gathering. I would open my mouth wide and he would aim forit. If I caught a berry in my mouth he cheered and gave me extra.\"\"Me too.\" Ramon looked sad. \"And his wife has a new baby. Someone said that'swhy he went. He wanted to go tell her family about the baby.\"\"But didn't he know what would happen? Hadn't he received Warnings?\"Ramon coughed suddenly. He bent over and gasped. Then he straightened up andshrugged. \"His wife says not. He went once before, when their first child wasborn, and had no trouble. No Warning.\"Matty thought about it. Gatherer must have overlooked a Warning. The early oneswere sometimes small. He felt great sadness for the gentle, happy man who hadbeen so brutally entangled and had left two children fatherless. Forest alwaysgave Warnings, Matty knew. He entered so often himself and always was watchful.If he had one Warning, even the smallest, he would never enter again. The blindman had entered only once, to return to his original village when it needed hiswisdom. He had come back safely, but he had had a small Warning on his return: asudden painful puncture from what had seemed a tiny twig. He couldn't see it, ofcourse, though later he said he had felt it come forward, had perceived it withthe kind of knowledge that had made the people designate Seer as his true name.But Matty, still a young boy, had been with him then, as a guide; and Matty hadseen the twig grow, expand, sharpen, aim itself, and stab. There was noquestion. It was a Warning. The blind man could never enter Forest again. Histime for going back had ended.Yet Matty had never been warned. Again and again he entered Forest, moved alongits trails, spoke to its creatures. He understood that for some reason, he wasspecial to Forest. He had traveled its paths for years, six years now, sincethat first time, when he was still very young and had left the home that hadbeen cruel to him.\"I'm never going in,\" Ramon said firmly. \"Not after seeing what it did toGatherer.\"\"You don't have a place to go back to,\" Matty pointed out. \"You were born inVillage. It's only those who try to go back to someplace that they left once.\"\"Like you, maybe.\"\"Like me, except I'm careful.\"\"I'm not taking the chance. Is this a good place to fish?\" Ramon asked, changingthe subject. \"I don't want to walk any farther. I'm tired all the time lately.\"They had been ambling toward the river, skirting the cornfield, and had reachedthe grassy bank where they often fished together. \"We caught a lot here lasttime. My mother cooked some for dinner, but there were so many that I nibbled onleftovers while I was playing the Gaming Machine after dinner.\"The Gaming Machine again. Ramon mentioned it so often. Maybe Gloater would behis true name, Matty thought. He had already decided on Boaster, but now, in hismind, he decided Gloater was more appropriate. Or Bragger. He was tired ofhearing about the Gaming Machine. And a little jealous, too.\"Yes, here,\" Matty said. He scrambled down the slippery bank to the place wherea boulder, large enough to stand on, jutted out. Both boys climbed the hugeoutcropping of rock and settled at the top to prepare their fishing gear andcast their lines for salmon.Behind them, Village, quiet and peaceful, continued its daily life. Gatherer hadbeen buried this morning. With her toddler playing on the floor by her feet, hiswidow now nursed her new baby on the porch of her homeplace, attended bycomforting women who sat with their knitting and embroidery and spoke only ofhappy things.In the schoolhouse, Mentor, the schoolteacher, gently tutored a mischievouseight-year-old named Gabe, who had neglected his studies to play and now neededhelp. His daughter, Jean, sold flower bouquets and loaves of fresh-baked breadin her marketplace stall while she flirted, laughing, with the gangly,self-conscious boys who stopped by.The blind man, Seer, made his way through the lanes of Village, checking on thepopulace, assessing the well-being of each individual. He knew each fence post,each crossroad, each voice and smell and shadow. If anything was amiss, he woulddo his best to make it right.From a window, the tall young man known as Leader looked down and watched theslow and cheerful pace of Village, of the people he loved, who had chosen him torule and guard them. He had come here as a boy, finding his way with greatdifficulty. The Museum held the remains of a broken sled in a glass case, andthe inscription explained that it had been Leader's arrival vehicle. There weremany relics of arrival in the Museum, because each person who had not been bornin Village had his own story of coming there. The blind man's history was toldthere, too: how he had been carried, near dead, from the place where enemies hadleft him with his eyes torn out and his future in his own place gone.In the Museum's glass cases there were shoes and canes and bicycles and awheeled chair. But somehow the small red-painted sled had become a symbol ofcourage and hope. Leader was young but he represented those things. He had nevertried to go back, never wanted to. This was his home now, these his people. Ashe did every afternoon, he stood at the window and watched. His eyes were apale, piercing blue.He watched with gratitude as the blind man moved through the lanes.He could see beyond a porch railing to the young woman who rocked an infant andmourned her husband. Grieve gently, he thought.He could see beyond the cornfield to where two young boys named Matty and Ramonwere dangling lines into the river. Good fishing, he thought.He could see beyond the marketplace to the cemetery where Gatherer's ruined bodyhad been buried. Rest in peace, he thought.Finally he looked toward the border of Village, to the place where the pathentered Forest and became shrouded in shadows. Leader could see beyond theshadows but was not certain what he saw. It was blurred, but there was somethingin Forest that disturbed Leader's consciousness and made him uneasy. He couldnot tell whether it was good or bad. Not yet.***Deep in the thick undergrowth near the clearing, at the edge of Leader's puzzledawareness, a small green frog ate an insect it had caught with its sticky,fastdarting tongue. Squatting, it moved its protruding eyes around, trying tosense more insects to devour. Finding nothing, it hopped away. One back leg wasoddly stiff but the frog barely noticed."},{"pageContent":"3\"If we had a Gaming Machine,\" Matty commented in a studied, offhand manner, \"ourevenings would never be boring.\"\"You think our evenings are boring, Matty? I thought you enjoyed our readingtogether.\"Seer laughed, and corrected himself. \"Sorry. I meant your reading to me, Matty,and my listening. It's my favorite time of day.\"Matty shrugged. \"No, I like reading to you, Seer. But I meant it's notexciting.\"\"Well, we should choose a different book, perhaps. That last one—I've forgottenits name, Matty—was a little slow-going. Moby Dick. That was the one.\"\"It was okay,\" Matty conceded. \"But it was too long.\"\"Well, ask at the library for something that would move along more quickly.\"\"Did I explain to you how a Gaming Machine works, Seer? It moves very quickly.\"The blind man chuckled. He had heard it all before, many times. \"Run out to thegarden and get a head of lettuce, Matty, while I finish cleaning the fish. Thenyou can make a salad while the fish cooks.\"\"And also,\" Matty continued in a loud voice as he headed for the garden justbeyond the door, \"it would be a nice end to a meal. Something sweet. Sort of adessert. I did tell you, didn't I, how the Gaming Machine gives you a candy whenyou win?\"\"See if there's a nice ripe tomato while you're out there getting the lettuce. Asweet one,\" Seer suggested in an amused voice.\"You might get a peppermint,\" Matty went on, \"or a gumdrop, or maybe somethingthey call a sourball.\" Beside the back step he reached into the vegetable gardenand uprooted a small head of lettuce. As an afterthought, he pinched a cucumberloose from its vine nearby, and pulled some leaves from a clump of basil. Backin the kitchen, he put the salad things in the sink and halfheartedly began towash them.\"Sourballs come in different colors, and each color is a flavor,\" he announced,\"but I suppose that wouldn't interest you.\"Matty sighed. He looked around. Even though he knew the blind man wouldn't seehis gesture, he pointed to the nearby wall, which was decorated by a colorfulwall-hanging, a gift from the blind man's talented daughter. Matty stood oftenbefore it, looking carefully at the intricate embroidered tapestry depicting alarge thick forest separating two small villages far from each other. It was thegeography of his own life, and that of the blind man, for they had both movedfrom that place to this other, with great difficulty.\"The Gaming Machine could stand right there,\" he decided. \"It would be veryconvenient. Extremely convenient,\" he added, aware that the blind man liked itwhen he exercised his vocabulary.Seer went to the sink, moved the washed lettuce to the side, and began to rinsethe cleaned salmon steaks. \"And so we would give up—or maybe even tradeaway—reading, and music, in exchange for the extreme excitement of pulling ahandle and watching sourballs spit forth from a mechanical device?\" he asked.Put that way, Matty thought, the Gaming Machine didn't actually seem such a goodtrade. \"Well,\" he said, \"it's fun.\"\"Fun,\" the blind man repeated. \"Is the stove ready? And the pan?\"Matty looked at the stove. \"In a minute,\" he said. He stirred the burning wood abit so that the fire flared. Then he placed the oiled pan on top. \"I'll do thefish,\" he said, \"if you fix the salad.\"I brought some basil in, too,\" he added, with a grin, \"just because you're sucha salad perfectionist. It's right there beside the lettuce.\" He watched whilethe blind man's deft hands found the basil and tore the leaves into the woodenbowl.Then Matty took the fish and laid it in the pan, swirling the oil around. In amoment the aroma of the sautéing salmon filled the room.Outside, it was twilight. Matty adjusted the wick on an oil lamp and lighted it.\"You know,\" he remarked, \"when you win a candy, a bell rings and colored lightsblink. Of course that wouldn't matter to you,\" he added, \"but some of us wouldreally appreciate—\"\"Matty, Matty, Matty,\" the blind man said. \"Keep an eye on that fish. It cooksquickly. No bell rings when it's done.\"And don't forget,\" he added, \"that they traded for that Gaming Machine. Itprobably came at a high cost.\"Matty frowned. \"Sometimes you get licorice,\" he said as a last attempt.\"Do you know what they traded? Has Ramon told you?\"\"No. Nobody ever tells.\"\"Maybe he doesn't even know. Maybe his parents didn't tell him. That's probablygood.\"Matty took the pan from the stove and slid the browned fish onto two plates, oneafter the other. He placed them on the table and brought the salad bowl from thesink. \"It's ready,\" he said.The blind man went to the bread container and found two thick pieces of breadthat smelled fresh-baked. \"I got this at the marketplace this morning,\" he said,\"from Mentor's daughter. She'll make someone a good wife. Is she as pretty asher voice makes her sound?\"But Matty was not going to be diverted by reminders of the schoolteacher'spretty daughter. \"When's the next Trade Mart?\" he asked, when they were bothseated.\"You're too young.\"\"I heard that there was one coming soon.\"\"Pay no attention to what you hear. You're too young.\"\"I won't be always. I ought to watch.\"The blind man shook his head. \"It would be painful,\" he said. \"Eat your fishnow, Matty, while it's warm.\"Matty poked at the salmon with his fork. He could tell that there was to be nomore discussion of trading. The blind man had never traded, not one single time,and was proud of it. But Matty thought that someday he himself would. Maybe notfor a Gaming Machine. But there were other things that Matty wanted. He ought tobe allowed to know how the trading worked.He decided he would find out. But first he had the other thing to worry about,and the troubling awareness that he had not dared to tell the blind man of it.***There were no secrets in Village. It was one of the rules that Leader hadproposed, and all of the people had voted in favor of it. Everyone who had cometo Village from elsewhere, all of those who had not been born here, had comefrom places with secrets. Sometimes—not very often, for inevitably it causedsadness—people described their places of origin: places with cruel governments,harsh punishments, desperate poverty, or false comforts.There were so many such places. Sometimes, hearing the stories, remembering hisown childhood, Matty was astounded. At first, having found his way to Village,he had thought his own brutal beginnings—a fatherless hovel for a home; a grim,defeated mother who beat him and his brother bloody—were unusual. But now heknew that there were communities everywhere, sprinkled across the vast landscapeof the known world, in which people suffered. Not always from beatings andhunger, the way he had. But from ignorance. From not knowing. From being keptfrom knowledge.He believed in Leader, and in Leader's insistence that all of Village'scitizens, even the children, read, learn, participate, and care for one another.So Matty studied and did his best.But sometimes he slipped back into the habits of his earlier life, when he hadbeen a sly and deceitful boy in order to survive.\"I can't help it,\" he had argued glumly to the blind man, in the beginning oftheir life together, when he had been caught in some small transgression. \"It'swhat I learnt.\"\"Learned.\" The correction was gentle.\"Learned,\" Matty had repeated.\"Now you are relearning. You are learning honesty. I'm sorry to punish you,Matty, but Village is a population of honest and decent people, and I want youto be one of us.\"Matty had hung his head. \"So you'll beat me?\"\"No, your punishment will be no lessons today. You will help me in the gardeninstead of going to school.\"It had seemed, to Matty then, a laughable punishment. Who wanted to go toschool, anyway? Not him!Yet, when he was deprived of it, and could hear the other children reciting andsinging in the schoolhouse, he felt woefully lost. Gradually he had learned tochange his behavior and to become one of Village's happy children, and soon agood student. Now half grown and soon to finish school, he slipped onlyoccasionally into old bad habits and almost always caught himself when he did.It bothered Matty greatly, now, having a secret."},{"pageContent":"4Leader had summoned Matty for message-running.Matty enjoyed going to Leader's homeplace, because of the stairs—others hadstairs, though Matty and the blind man did not, but Leader's stairs werecircular, which fascinated Matty, and he liked going up and down—and because ofthe books. Others had books, too. Matty had a few schoolbooks, and he oftenborrowed other books from the library so that he could read stories to the blindman in the evenings, a time they both enjoyed.But Leader's homeplace, where he lived alone, had more books than Matty had everseen in one place. The entire ground floor, except for the kitchen to one side,was lined with shelves, and the shelves were filled with volumes of every sort.Leader allowed Matty to lift down and look at any one he wanted. There werestories, of course, not unlike the ones he found in the library. There werehistory books as well, like those he studied at school, the best ones filledwith maps that showed how the world had changed over centuries. Some books hadshiny pages that showed paintings of landscapes unlike anything Matty had everseen, or of people costumed in odd ways, or of battles, and there were manyquiet painted scenes of a woman holding a newborn child. Still others werewritten in languages from the past and from other places.Leader laughed wryly when Matty had opened to a page and pointed to the unknownlanguage. \"It's called Greek,\" Leader said. \"I can read a few words. But in theplace of my childhood, we were not allowed to learn such things. So in my sparetime, I have Mentor come and help me with languages. But...\" Leader sighed. \"Ihave so little spare time. Maybe when I'm old, I will sit here and study. I'dlike that, I think.\"Matty had replaced the book and run his hand gently over the leather bindings ofthe ones beside it.\"If you weren't allowed to learn,\" he asked, \"why did they let you bring thebooks?\"Leader laughed. \"You've seen the little sled,\" he said.\"In the Museum?\"\"Yes. My vehicle of arrival. They've made such a thing of it, it's almostembarrassing. But it is true that I came on that sled. A desperate boy, halfdead. No books! The books were brought to me later. I have never been assurprised in my life as I was the day those books arrived.\"Matty had looked around at the thousands of books. In his own arms—and Matty wasstrong—he could have carried no more than ten or twelve at a time.\"How did they come to you?\"\"A river barge. Suddenly there it was. Huge wooden crates aboard, and each onefilled with books. Until that time I had always been afraid. A year had passed.Then two. But I was still afraid; I thought they would still be looking for me,that I would be recaptured, put to death, because no one had ever fled mycommunity successfully before.\"It was only when I saw the books that I knew that things had changed, that Iwas free, and that back there, where I had come from, they were rebuildingthemselves into something better.\"The books were a kind of forgiveness, I think.\"\"So you could have gone back,\" Matty said. \"Was it too late? Had Forest givenyou Warnings?\"\"No. But why would I go back? I had found a home here, the way everyone has.That's why we have the Museum, Matty, to remind us of how we came, and why: tostart fresh, and begin a new place from what we had learned and carried from theold.\"***Today Matty admired the books, as he always did in Leader's homeplace, but hedidn't linger to touch or examine them. Nor did he stop to admire the staircase,with its intricate risers of crafted, polished wood that ascended in a circle tothe next level. When Leader called, \"Up here, Matty,\" he bounded up the stairsto the second floor, into the spacious room where Leader lived and worked.Leader was at his desk. He looked up from the papers in front of him and smiledat Matty. \"How's the fishing?\"Matty shrugged and grinned. \"Not too bad. Caught four yesterday.\"Leader laid his pen aside and leaned back in his chair. \"Tell me something,Matty. You and your friend are out there a lot, fishing. And you've been doingit for a long time—since you came to Village as a little boy. Isn't that so?\"\"I don't remember exactly how long. I was only about this high when I came.\"Matty gestured with his hand, placing it level with the second button of his ownshirt.\"Six years,\" Leader told him. \"You arrived six years ago. So you've been fishingfor all that time.\"Matty nodded. But he stiffened. He was wary. It was too soon for his true nameto be bestowed, he thought. Surely it was not going to be Fisherman! Was thatwhy Leader had called him here?Leader looked at him and began to laugh. \"Relax, Matty! When you look like that,I can almost read your mind! Don't worry. It was only a question.\"\"A question about fishing. Fishing's a thing I do just to get food or to foolaround. I don't want it to turn into something more.\" Matty liked that aboutLeader, that you could say what you wanted to him, that you could tell him whatyou felt.\"I understand. You needn't worry about that. I was asking because I need toassess the food supply. Some are saying there are fewer fish than there oncewere. Look here, what I've been writing.\" He passed a paper over to Matty. Therewere columns of numbers, lists headed \"Salmon\" and \"Trout.\"Matty read the numbers and frowned. \"It might be true,\" he said. \"I remember atfirst I would pull fish after fish from the river. But you know what, Leader?\"\"What?\" Leader took the paper back from Matty and laid it with others on hisdesk.\"I was little then. And maybe you don't remember this, because you're older thanI am...\"Leader smiled. \"I'm still a young man, Matty. I remember being a boy.\" Mattythought he noticed a brief flicker of sadness in Leader's eyes, despite the warmsmile. So many people in Village—including Matty—had sad memories of theirchildhoods.\"What I meant was, I remember all the fish, the feeling that they would neverend. I felt that I could drop my line in again and again and again and therewould always be fish. Now there aren't. But, Leader...\"Leader looked at him and waited.\"Things seem more when you're little. They seem bigger, and distances seemfarther. The first time I came here through Forest? The journey seemed forever.\"\"It does take days, Matty, from where you started.\"\"Yes, I know. It still takes days. But now it doesn't seem as far or as long.Because I'm older, and bigger, and I've gone back and forth again and again, andI know the way, and I'm not scared. So it seems shorter.\"Leader chuckled. \"And the fish?\"\"Well,\" Matty acknowledged, \"there don't seem to be as many. But maybe it's justthat I was a little boy back then, when the fish seemed endless.\"Leader tapped the tip of his pen on the desk as he thought. \"Maybe so,\" he saidafter a moment. He stood. From a table in the corner of the room he took a stackof folded papers.\"Messages?\" Matty asked.\"Messages. I'm calling a meeting.\"\"About fish?\"\"No. I wish it were just about fish. Fish would be easy.\"Matty took the stack of message papers he would be delivering. Before he turnedto the staircase to leave, he felt compelled to say, \"Fish aren't ever easy. Youhave to use just the right bait, and know the right place to go, and then youhave to pull the line up at just the right moment, because if you don't, thefish can wiggle right off your hook, and not everybody is good at it, and...\"He could hear Leader laughing, still, when he left.***It took Matty most of the day to deliver all of the messages. It wasn't a hardtask. He liked the harder ones better, actually, when he was outfitted with foodand a carrying pack and sent on long journeys through Forest. Although he hadn'tbeen sent to it in almost two years, Matty especially liked trips that took himback to his former home, where he could greet his boyhood pals with a somewhatsuperior smile, and snub those who had been cruel to him in the past. His motherwas dead, he had been told. His brother was still there, and looked at Mattywith more respect than he ever had in the past, but they were strangers to eachother now. The community where he had lived was greatly changed and seemedforeign, though less harsh than he remembered.Today he simply made his way around Village, delivering notice of the meetingthat would be held the following week. Reading the message himself, he couldunderstand Leader's questioning about the supply of fish, and the concern andworry that Matty had felt from him.There had been a petition—signed by a substantial number of people—to closeVillage to outsiders. There would have to be a debate, and a vote.It had happened before, such a petition.\"We voted it down just a year ago,\" the blind man reminded Matty when themessage had been read to him. \"There must be a stronger movement now.\"\"There are still plenty of fish,\" Matty pointed out, \"and the fields are full ofcrops.\"The blind man crumpled the message and dropped it into the fire. \"It's not thefish or crops,\" he said. \"They'll use that, of course. They argued dwindlingfood supply last time. It's...\"\"Not enough housing?\"\"More than that. I can't think of the word for it. Selfishness, I guess. It'screeping in.\"Matty was startled. Village had been created out of the opposite: selflessness.He knew that from his studies and from hearing the history. Everyone did.\"But in the message—I could have read it to you again if you hadn't burned it—itsays that the group who wants to close the border is headed by Mentor! Theschoolteacher!\"The blind man sighed. \"Give the soup a stir, would you, Matty?\"Obediently Matty moved the wooden ladle around in the pot and watched beans andchopped tomatoes churn in the thick mixture as it simmered. Thinking still ofhis teacher, he added, \"He's not selfish!\"\"I know he isn't. That's why it's puzzling.\"\"He welcomes everyone to the school, even new ones who have no learning, whocan't even speak properly.\"\"Like you, when you came,\" the blind man said with a smile. \"It couldn't havebeen easy, but he taught you.\"\"He had to tame me first,\" Matty acknowledged, grinning. \"I was wild, wasn't I?\"Seer nodded. \"Wild. But Mentor loves teaching those who need it.\"\"Why would he want to close the border?\"\"Matty?\"\"What?\"\"Has Mentor traded, do you know?\"Matty thought about it. \"It's school vacation now, so I don't see him as often.But I stop by his homeplace now and then...\" He didn't mention Jean, the widowedschoolteacher's daughter. \"I haven't noticed anything different in hishousehold.\"No Gaming Machine,\" he added, laughing a little.But the blind man didn't chuckle in reply. He sat thinking for a moment. Then hesaid, in a worried voice, \"It's much more than just a Gaming Machine.\""},{"pageContent":"5\"The schoolteacher's daughter told me that her dog has three puppies. I can haveone when it's big enough, if I like.\"\"Isn't she the one who promised you a kiss? Now a dog as well? I'd settle forthe kiss if I were you, Matty.\" The blind man smiled, loosened a beet from theearth, and placed it in the basket of vegetables. They were in the gardentogether.\"I miss my dog. He wasn't any trouble.\" Matty glanced over to the corner oftheir homeplace's plot of land, beyond the garden, to the small grave where theyhad buried Branch two years before.\"You're right, Matty. Your little dog was a good companion for many years. Itwould be fun to have a puppy around.\" The blind man's voice was gentle.\"I could train a dog to lead you.\"\"I don't need leading. Could you train a dog to cook?\"\"Anything but beets,\" Matty said, making a face as he threw another into thebasket.***But when he went in the afternoon to the schoolteacher's homeplace, Matty foundJean distraught. \"Two died last night,\" she said. \"They took sick. Now there'sonly one puppy left, and it's sick, and the mother as well.\"\"How have you tended them?\"Jean shook her head in despair. \"Same as I would for my father or myself.Infusion of white willow bark. But the puppy's too little to drink, and themother's too sick. She lapped a bit and then just put her head down.\"\"Will you take me to see them?\"Jean led him into the small house, and though he was concerned for the dogs,Matty found himself looking around as they walked through, remembering what theblind man had asked. He noticed the sturdy furniture, neatly arranged, and thebookcases filled with Mentor's books. In the kitchen, Jean's baking pans, andthe bowls in which she mixed dough, were set out, ready for her wonderful breadsto be made.He saw nothing that hinted of a trade. Nothing silly like a Gaming Machine,nothing frivolous like the soft upholstered furniture decorated with fringe thata foolish young couple down the road had traded for.Of course there were other kinds of trades, Matty knew, though he didn't fullyunderstand. He had heard murmurs about them. There were trades for things youdidn't see. Those were the most dangerous trades.\"They're in here.\" Jean opened the door to the storage shed attached to thehouse at the back of the kitchen. Matty entered and knelt beside the mother dogwhere she lay on a folded blanket. The tiny puppy, motionless but for itslabored breathing, lay in the curve of her belly, the way any puppy would. But ahealthy pup would have been wiggling and sucking. This one should have beenpawing at its mother for milk.Matty knew dogs. He loved them. Gently he touched the puppy with his finger.Then, startled, he jerked his hand away. He had felt something painful.Oddly, it made him think of lightning.He remembered how he had been instructed, even as a small boy back in his oldplace, to go indoors during a thunderstorm. He had seen a tree split andblackened by a lightning strike, and he knew that it could happen to a human:the flash and the burning power that would surge through you, looking for aplace to enter the earth.He had watched through the window and seen great fiery bolts split the sky, andhe had smelled the sulfurous smell that they sometimes left behind.There was a man in Village, a farmer, who had stood in the field beside hisplow, waiting as dark clouds gathered overhead, hoping the storm would pass by.The lightning had found him there, and though the farmer had survived, he hadlost all his memory but for the sensation of raw power that had entered him thatafternoon. People tended him now, and he helped with farm chores, but his energywas gone, taken away by the mysterious energy that lived in lightning.Matty had felt this sensation—the one of pulsating power, as if he had the powerof lightning within his own self—in the clearing, on a sunny day with no stormbrewing.He had tried to put it out of his mind afterward, any thoughts of the day it hadhappened, because it frightened him so and made him have a secret, which he didnot want. But Matty knew, pulling his hand from the ailing puppy, that it wastime to test it once again.\"Where's your father?\" he asked Jean. He wanted no one to watch.\"He had a meeting to go to. You know about the petition?\"Matty nodded. Good. The schoolteacher was not around.\"I don't think he really even cares about the meeting. He just wants to seeStocktender's widow. He's courting her.\" Jean spoke with affectionate amusement.\"Can you imagine? Courting, at his age?\"He needed the girl to be gone. Matty thought. \"I want you to go to Herbalist's.Get yarrow.\"\"I have yarrow in my own garden! Right beside the door!\" Jean replied.He didn't need yarrow, not really. He needed her gone. Matty thought quickly.\"Spearmint? Lemon balm? Catnip? Do you have all of those?\"She shook her head. \"No catnip. If cats were attracted to my garden, the dogwould make a terrible fuss.\"Wouldn't you, poor thing?\" she said sweetly, leaning down to murmur to thedying mother dog. She stroked the dog's back but it did not lift its head. Itseyes were beginning to glaze.\"Go,\" Matty told her in an urgent voice. \"Get those things.\"\"Do you think they'll help?\" Jean asked dubiously. She took her hand from thedog and stood, but she lingered.\"Just go!\" Matty ordered.\"You needn't use a rude tone, Matty,\" Jean said with an edge in her voice. Butshe turned with a flounce of her skirt and went. He barely heard the sound ofthe door closing behind her. Steeling himself against the painful vibratingshock that he knew would go through his entire body, Matty placed his left handon the mother dog, his right on the puppy, and willed them to live.***An hour later, Matty stumbled home, exhausted. Back at Mentor's house, Jean wasfeeding the mother dog and giggling at the antics of the lively puppy.\"Who would have thought of that combination of herbs? Isn't it amazing!\" she hadsaid in delight, watching the creatures revive.\"Lucky guess.\" He let Jean believe it was the herbs. She was distracted by thesudden liveliness of the dogs and didn't even notice how weak Matty was. He satleaning against the wall in the shed and watched her tend them. But his visionwas slightly blurred and his whole body ached.Finally, when he had regained a little strength, he forced himself to stand andleave. Fortunately his own homeplace was empty. The blind man was out somewhere,and Matty was glad of that. Seer would have noticed something wrong. He couldalways feel it. He said the atmosphere in the homeplace changed, as if wind hadshifted, if Matty had so much as a cold.And this was much more. He staggered into his room off the kitchen and lay downon his bed, breathing hard. Matty had never felt so weak, so drained. Except forthe frog...The frog was smaller, he thought. But it was the same thing.He had come across the little frog by chance, in the clearing. He had no reasonto be there that day; he had simply wanted to be alone, away from busy Village,and had gone into Forest to get away, as he did sometimes.Barefoot, he had stepped on the frog, and was startled. \"Sorry!\" he had saidplayfully, and reached down to pick the little fellow up. \"Are you all right?You should have hopped away when you heard me coming.\"But the frog wasn't all right, and couldn't have escaped with a hop. It hadn'tbeen Matty's light step that had injured it; he could see that right away. Somecreature—Matty thought probably a fox or weasel—had inflicted a terrible woundupon the small green thing, and the frog was almost dead of it. One leg dangled,torn away from the body, held there only by an oozing bit of ragged tissue. Inhis hand, the frog drew a shuddering breath and then was still.\"Someone chewed you up and spit you out,\" Matty said. He was sympathetic butmatter-of-fact. The hard life and quick death of Forest's creatures wereeveryday things. \"Well,\" he said, \"I'll give you a nice burial.\"He knelt to dig out a spot with his hands in the mossy earth. But when he triedto set the little body down, he found that he was connected to it in a way thatmade no sense. A painful kind of power surged from his hand, flowing into thefrog, and held them bound together.Confused and alarmed, he tried to scrape the sticky body of the frog off hishand. But he couldn't. The vibrating pain held them connected. Then, after amoment, while Matty knelt, still mystified by what was happening, the frog'sbody twitched.\"So you're not dead. Get off of me, then.\" Now he was able to drop the frog tothe ground. The stab of pain eased.\"What was that all about?\" Matty found himself talking to the frog as if itmight be able to reply. \"I thought you were dead, but you weren't. You're goingto lose your leg, though. And your hopping days are over. I'm sorry for that.\"He stood and looked down at the impassive frog. Churrump. Its throat made thesound.\"Yes. I agree. Same to you.\" Matty turned to leave.Churrump.The sound compelled him to go back and to kneel again. The frog's wide-openeyes, which had been glazed with death only a few moments before, were now clearand alert. It stared at Matty.\"Look, I'm going to put you over here in the ferns, because if you stay in theopen, some other creature will come along and gobble you up. You have a bigdisadvantage now, not being able to hop away. You'll have to learn to hide.\"He picked up the frog and carried it to the thicket of high ferns. \"If I had myknife with me,\" he told it, \"I'd probably just slice through those threads thatare holding your leg. Then maybe you could heal more quickly. As it is, you'llbe dragging that leg around and it will burden you. But there's nothing I cando.\"He leaned down to turn it loose, still thinking about how best to help it.\"Maybe I can find a sharp rock and slice through. It's just a tiny bit of fleshand it probably wouldn't even pain you if I did it.\"You stay right here,\" Matty commanded, and placed the frog on the earth besidethe ferns. As if it could bop, he thought.Back at the edge of the small stream he had crossed, Matty found what he neededas a tool: a bit of rock with a sharp edge. He took it back to where the woundedfrog lay, immobilized by its wound.\"Now,\" Matty told the frog, \"don't be scared. I'm going to spread you out a bitand then carefully cut that dead leg away. It's the best thing for you.\" Heturned the frog onto its back and touched the shredded leg, meaning to arrangeit in a way that would make the amputation simple and fast. There were only afew sticky strands of flesh to slice through.But he felt a sudden jolt of painful energy enter his arm, concentrated in hisfingertips. Matty was unable to move. His hand grasped the nearly severed legand he could feel his own blood moving through its vessels. His pulse thrummedand he could hear the sound of it.Terrified, Matty held his breath for what seemed forever. Then it all stopped.The thing that had happened ended. He lifted his hand tentatively from thewounded frog.Churrump.Churrump.\"I'm leaving now. I don't know what happened, but I'm leaving now.\" He droppedthe sharp rock and tried to rise, but his knees were weak and he felt dizzy andsick. Still kneeling beside the frog, Matty took a few long breaths, trying toget his strength again so that he could flee.Churrump.\"Stop it. I don't want to hear that.\"As if it understood what Matty had said, the frog turned, flopping itself overfrom its belly-up position, and moved toward the ferns. But it was not dragginga useless leg. Both legs were moving—awkwardly, to be sure, but the frog waspropelling itself with both legs. It disappeared into the clump of quiveringferns.After a moment Matty was able to stand. Desperately tired, he had made his wayout of Forest and stumbled home.***Now, lying on his bed, he felt the same exhaustion, magnified. His arms ached.Matty thought about what had happened. The frog was very small. This was twodogs.This was bigger.I must learn to control it, Matty told himself.Then, surprisingly, he began to cry. Matty had a boyish pride in the fact thathe never cried. But now he wept, and it felt as if the tears were cleansing him,as if his body needed to empty itself. Tears ran down his cheeks.Finally, shuddering with exhaustion, he wiped his eyes, turned on his side, andslept, though it was still midday. The sun was high in the sky over Village.Matty dreamed of vague, frightening things connected to pain, and his body wastense even as he slept. Then his dream changed. His muscles relaxed and hebecame serene in his sleep. He was dreaming now of healed wounds, new life, andcalm."},{"pageContent":"6\"New ones coming! And there's a pretty girl among them!\"Ramon called to Matty but didn't stop. He was hurrying past, eager to get toVillage's entrance place, where new ones always came in. There was, in fact, aWelcome sign there, though many new ones, they had discovered, could not read.Matty had been one of those. The word welcome had meant nothing to him then.\"I saw it but couldn't read it,\" he had said to Seer once, \"and you could haveread it but you couldn't see it.\"\"We're quite a pair, aren't we? No wonder we get along so well together.\" Theblind man had laughed.\"May I go? I'm almost done here.\" When Ramon ran past and called to them, Mattyand the blind man had been clearing out the garden, pulling up the last of theovergrown pea vines. Their season was long past. Soon summer would end. Theywould be storing the root vegetables soon.\"Yes, of course. I'll go, too. It's important to welcome them.\"They wiped their dirty hands quickly and left the garden, closing the gatebehind them and following the same path Ramon had rushed along. The entrance wasnot far, and the new ones were gathered there. In the past, new ones had mostlyarrived alone or in pairs, but now they seemed to come in groups: wholefamilies, often, looking tired, for they had come great distances, andfrightened, because they had left fearsome things behind and usually theirescape had been dangerous and terrifying. But always they were hopeful, too, andclearly relieved to be greeted by the smiles. The people of Village pridedthemselves on the welcome, many of them leaving their regular work to go and bepart of it.Frequently the new ones were damaged. They hobbled on canes or were ill.Sometimes they were disfigured by wounds or simply because they had been bornthat way. Some were orphans. All of them were welcomed.Matty joined the crowded semicircle and smiled encouragingly at the new ones asthe greeters took their names, one by one, and assigned them to helpers whowould lead them to their living spaces and help them settle in. He thought hesaw the girl Ramon had mentioned, a thin but lovely girl about their age. Herface was dirty and her hair uncombed. She held the hand of a younger child whoseeyes were thick with yellow mucus; it was a common ailment of new ones, quicklyhealed with herbal mixtures. He could tell that the girl was worried for thechild, and he tried to smile at her in a way that was reassuring.There were more than usual this time. \"It's a big group,\" Matty whispered to theblind man.\"Yes, I can hear that it is. I wonder if somehow they have begun to hear rumorsthat we may close.\"As he spoke, they both heard something and turned. Approaching the welcomingentrance and the busy processing of the new ones, a small group of people Mattyrecognized—with Mentor leading them—came forward, chanting, \"Close. Close. Nomore. No more.\"The welcoming group was uncertain how to react. They continued to smile at thenew ones and to reach forward to take their hands. But the chant made everyoneuncomfortable.Finally, in the confusion, Leader appeared. Someone had sent for him,apparently. The crowd parted to allow him through and the chanters fell silent.Leader's voice was, as always, calm. He spoke first to the new ones, welcomingthem. He would have done this later in the day, after they had been fed andsettled. But now, instead of waiting, he reassured them briefly.\"We were all of us new ones once,\" he said with a smile, \"except for theyoungsters who have been born here.\"We know what you have been through.\"You will no longer be hungry. You will no longer live under unfair rule. Youwill never be persecuted again.\"We are honored to have you among us. Welcome to your new home. Welcome toVillage.\"He turned to the greeters and said, \"Do the processing later. They are tired.Take them to their living spaces so they can have baths and food. Let them restfor a while.\"The greeters encircled the new ones and led them away.Then Leader turned to those who remained. \"Thank you, those of you who came togive welcome. It is one of the most important things we do in Village.\"Those of you who object? Mentor? You and the others?\" He looked at the smallgroup of dissenters. \"You have that right, as you know. The right to dissent isone of our most important freedoms here.\"But the meeting is in four days. Let me suggest that instead of worrying andfrightening these new ones, who have just come and are weary and confused, letus wait and see what the meeting decides.\"Even those of you who want to close Village to new ones—even you value thepeace and kindness we have always embraced here. Mentor? You seem to be leadingthis. What do you say?\"Matty turned to look at Mentor, the teacher who meant so much to him. Mentor wasthinking, and Matty was accustomed to seeing him deep in thought, for it waspart of his classroom demeanor. He always thought over each question carefully,even the most foolish question from the youngest student.Odd, Matty thought. The birthmark across Mentor's cheek seemed lighter.Ordinarily it was a deep red. Now it seemed merely pink, as if it were fading.But it was late summer. Probably, Matty decided, Mentor's skin had been tannedby the sun, as his own was; and this made the birthmark less visible.Still, Matty was uneasy. Something else was different today about Mentor. Hecouldn't name the difference, not really. Was it that Mentor seemed slightlytaller? How strange that would be, Matty thought. But the teacher had alwayswalked with a bit of a stoop. His shoulders were hunched over. People said thathe had aged terribly after his beloved wife's death, when Jean was just a smallchild. Sadness had done it.Today he stood erect and his shoulders were straight. So he seemed taller, butwasn't, Matty decided with relief. It was simply a changed posture.\"Yes,\" Mentor said to Leader, \"we will see what the meeting decides.\"His voice sounded different, Matty noticed.He saw that Leader, too, was noticing something about Mentor and was puzzled.But everyone was turning away now, the crowd dispersing, people returning totheir usual daily tasks. Matty ran to catch up with the blind man, who hadstarted walking the familiar path home.Behind him he heard an announcement being made. \"Don't forget!\" someone wascalling out. \"Trade Mart tomorrow night!\"Trade Mart. With the other things that had consumed Matty's thoughts recently,he had almost forgotten about Trade Mart.Now he decided he would attend.***Trade Mart was a very old custom. No one remembered its beginnings. The blindman said that he had first known of it when he was a newcomer to Village, stillan invalid with wounds to be tended. He had lain on a bed in the infirmary, inpain, unseeing, his memory slow to return, and half listened to theconversations of the gentle folk who took care of him.\"Did you go to the last Trade Mart?\" he had heard one person ask another.\"No, I have nothing to trade. Did you?\"\"Went and watched. It all seems foolishness to me.\"He had put it from his mind, then. He had nothing to trade, either. He ownednothing. His torn, bloodstained clothes had been taken from him and replaced.From a cord around his neck dangled an amulet of some sort, and he felt itsimportance but could not remember why. Certainly he would not trade it for sometrinket; it was all he had left of his past.The blind man had described all of that to Matty.\"Later I went, just to watch,\" he told him.Matty laughed at him. They were close, by then, and he could do that. \"Watch?\"he hooted.The blind man laughed in reply. \"I have my own kind of watching,\" he said.\"I know you do. That's why they call you Seer. You see more than most. Cananyone go to Trade Mart and watch?\"\"Of course. There are no secrets here. But it was dull stuff, Matty. Peoplecalled out what they wanted to trade for. Women wanted new bracelets, Iremember, and they traded their old bracelets away. Things like that.\"\"So it's like Market Day.\"\"It seemed so to me. I never went back.\"Now, speaking of it the evening of the new ones' arrival, the blind manexpressed concern. \"It's changed, Matty. I hear people talk of it now, and Ifeel the changes. Something's wrong.\"\"What kind of talk?\"The blind man was sitting with his instrument on his lap. He played one chord.Then he frowned. \"I'm not sure. There's a secrecy to it now.\"\"I got up my nerve and asked Ramon what his parents traded for the GamingMachine. But he didn't know. He said they wouldn't tell him, and his motherturned away when he asked, as if she had something to hide.\"\"I don't like the sound of it.\" The blind man stroked the strings and played twomore chords.\"The sound of your own music?\" Matty asked with a laugh, trying to lighten theconversation.\"Something's happening at Trade Mart,\" Seer said, ignoring Matty's attempt athumor.\"Leader said the same.\"\"He would know. I'd be wary of it, Matty, if I were you.\"The next evening, while they prepared supper, he told the blind man he wasplanning to go.\"I know you said I was too young, Seer. But I'm not. Ramon's going. And maybeit's important for me to go. Maybe I can figure out what's happening.\"Seer sighed and nodded. \"Promise me one thing,\" he told Matty.\"I will.\"\"Make no trade. Watch and listen. But make no trade. Even if you're tempted.\"\"I promise.\" Then Matty laughed. \"How could I? I have nothing to trade. Whatcould I give for a Gaming Machine? A puppy too young to leave its mother? Who'dwant that?\"The blind man stirred the chicken that simmered in a broth. \"Ah, Matty, you havemore than you know. And people will want what you have.\"Matty thought. Seer was correct, of course. He had the thing that troubledhim—the power, he thought of it—and perhaps there were those who would want it.Maybe he should find a way to trade it away. But the thought made him nervous.He turned his thoughts to other, less worrying things.He had a fishing pole, but he needed that and loved it. He had a kite, stored inthe loft, and perhaps one day he would trade it for a better kite.But not tonight. Tonight he would only watch. He had promised the blind man."},{"pageContent":"7It was early evening, just past supper, and others were hurrying, as Matty was,along the lane to the place where Trade Mart was held. He nodded to neighbors ashe passed them, and waved to some he saw farther along. People nodded back orwaved in reply, but there was none of the lighthearted banter that wasordinarily part of Village. There was an intentness to everyone, an oddseriousness, and a sense of worry—unusual in Village—pervaded the atmosphere.No wonder Seer didn't want me to come, Matty thought as he approached. Itdoesn't feel right.He could hear the noise. A murmur. People whispering to each other. It was notat all like Market Day, with its sounds of laughter, conversation, and commerce:good-natured bargaining, the squealing of pigs, the motherly cluck of hens withtheir cheeping broods. Tonight it was simply a low hum, a nervous whisperthrough the crowd.Matty slipped into a group that had gathered and was standing nearest to theplatform, a simple wooden structure like a stage that was used for manyoccasions when the people came together. The coming meeting to discuss theproposal to close Village would be held here, too, and Leader would stand on thestage to direct things and keep them orderly.A large wooden roof covered the area so that rain would not prevent a gathering,and in the cold months the enclosing sides would be slid into place. Tonight,though, with the weather still warm, it was open to the evening. A breezeruffled Matty's hair. He could smell the scent of the pine grove that borderedthe area.He found a place to stand next to Mentor, hoping that perhaps Jean would joinher father, though she was nowhere to be seen. Mentor glanced down and smiled athim. \"Matty!\" he said. \"It's a surprise to see you here. You've never beenbefore.\"\"No,\" Matty said. \"I have nothing to trade.\"The schoolteacher put his arm affectionately over Matty's shoulders, and Mattynoticed for the first time that the teacher had lost weight. \"Ah,\" Mentor said,\"you'd be surprised. Everyone has something to trade.\"\"Jean has her flowers,\" Matty said, hoping to turn the conversation to Mentor'sdaughter. \"But she takes them to the market stall. She doesn't need Trade Martfor that.\"And,\" he added, \"she already promised the puppy to me. She'd better not tradehim away.\"Mentor laughed. \"No, the puppy is yours, Matty. And the sooner the better. He'sfull of mischief, and he chewed my shoes just this morning.\"For a moment everything seemed as it had always been. The man was warm andcheerful, the same loving teacher and father he had been for years. His arm overMatty's shoulders was familiar.But Matty found himself wondering suddenly why Mentor was there. Why, in fact,any of these people were here. None of them had brought any goods to trade. Helooked around to confirm what he had noticed. People stood tensely, their armsfolded or at their sides. Some of them were murmuring to one another. Mattynoticed the young couple who were neighbors down the road from the house heshared with the blind man. They were conversing in low voices, perhaps arguing,and the young wife appeared worried at what her husband was saying. But theirarms, too, like Matty's, like Mentor's, like everyone's, were empty. No one hadbrought anything to trade.A silence fell and the crowd parted to make way for the tall, dark-haired manwho was now striding toward the stage. He was called Trademaster. People saidthat he had come, already named, as a new one some years before, and had broughtwith him what he knew about trading from the place he had left. Matty had oftenseen him around Village and knew that he was in charge of Trade Mart and that hechecked on things after, stopping at houses where trades had been made. He hadcome to Ramon's after his parents acquired the Gaming Machine. Tonight hecarried nothing but a thick book that Matty had never seen before.Mentor's arm fell from Matty's shoulders and the schoolteacher's attentionturned eagerly toward the stage, where Trademaster was now standing.\"Trade Mart begins,\" Trademaster called. He had a loud voice with a slightaccent, as many in Village had, the traces of their former languages lingeringwith them. The crowd fell absolutely silent now. Even the slightest whisperingceased. But over on the edge, Matty heard a woman begin to weep. He stood ontiptoe and peered toward her in time to see several people lead her away.Mentor didn't even look toward the commotion of the weeping woman. Matty watchedhim. He noticed suddenly that Mentor's face looked slightly different, and hecould not identify what the difference was. The evening light was dim.More than that, the teacher, usually so calm, was now tense, alert, and appearedto be waiting for something.\"Who first?\" Trademaster called, and while Matty watched, Mentor raised his handand waved it frantically, like a schoolboy hoping for a reward. \"Me! Me!\" theschoolteacher called out in a demanding voice, and as Matty watched, Mentorshoved the people standing in front of him aside so that he would be noticed.***Late that night, the blind man listened with a concerned look on his face whileMatty described Trade Mart.\"Mentor was first, because he raised his hand so fast. And he completely forgotme, Seer. He had been standing with me and we were talking, just as we alwayshave. Then, when they started, it was as if I didn't exist. He pushed ahead ofeveryone and went first.\"\"What do you mean, went first? Where did he go?\"\"To the stage. He pushed through everyone. He shoved and jostled them aside,Seer. It was so odd. Then he went to the stage when Trademaster called hisname.\"The blind man rocked back and forth in his chair. Tonight he had not playedmusic at all. Matty knew he was distressed.\"It used to be different. People just called out. There was a lot of laughterand teasing the time I went.\"\"No laughter tonight, Seer. Just silence, as if people were very nervous. It wasa little scary.\"\"And what happened when Mentor got to the stage?\"Matty thought. It had been a little difficult to see through the crowd. \"He juststood there. Then Trademaster asked him something, but it was as if he alreadyknew the answer. And then everyone laughed a bit, as if they did, too, but itwasn't a having-fun kind of laughter. It was a knowing kind.\"\"Could you hear what he asked?\"\"I couldn't hear that first time, but I know what it was because he asked it ofeveryone who came up. It was the same each time. Just three words. Trade forwhat? That's what he asked each time.\"\"And was the answer the same from everyone?\"Matty shook his head, then remembered that he had to reply aloud. \"No,\" he said.\"It was different.\"\"Could you hear Mentor's reply?\"\"Yes. It made everyone laugh in that odd way. Mentor said, 'Same as before.'\"The blind man frowned. \"Did you get a feel for what that meant?\"\"I think so, because everyone looked at Stocktender's widow, and she blushed.She was near me, so I could see it. Her friends poked at her, teasing, and Iheard her say, 'He needs a few more trades first.'\"\"Then what happened?\"Matty tried to remember the sequence of things. \"Trademaster seemed to say yes,or at least to nod his head, and then he opened his book and wrote it in.\"\"I'd like to see that book,\" the blind man said, and then, laughing at himself,added, \"or have you see it, and read it to me.\"What came next?\"\"Mentor stood there. He seemed relieved that Trademaster had written somethingdown for him.\"\"How could you tell?\"\"He smiled and seemed less nervous.\"\"Then what?\"\"Then everyone got very silent and Trademaster asked, 'Trade away what?' \"The blind man thought. \"Another three words. Was it the same for each? The same'Trade for what?' and then 'Trade away what?' \"\"Yes. But each one said the answer to the first quite loudly, the way Mentordid, but they whispered the answer to the second, so no one could hear.\"\"So it became public, what they were trading for...\"\"Yes, and sometimes the crowd called out in a scornful way. They jeered. I thinkthat's the right word.\"\"And he wrote each down?\"\"No. Ramon's mother went up, and when Trademaster asked, 'Trade for what?' shesaid, 'Fur jacket.' But Trademaster said no.\"\"Did he give a reason for the no?\"\"He said she got a Gaming Machine already. Maybe another time, he said. Keeptrying, he told her.\"The blind man stirred restlessly in his chair. \"Make us some tea, Matty, wouldyou?\"Matty did so, going to the woodstove where the iron kettle was alreadysimmering. He poured the water over tea leaves in two thick mugs and gave one toSeer.\"Tell me again the second three-word thing,\" the blind man said after he hadtaken a sip.Matty repeated it. \"'Trade away what?'\" He tried to make his voice loud andimportant, as Trademaster's had been. He tried to imitate the slight accent.\"But you couldn't hear any of the answers that people gave, is that right?\"\"That's right. They whispered, and he wrote the whispers in his book.\"Matty straightened in his chair with a sudden idea. \"How about if I steal thebook and read you what it says?\"\"Matty, Matty...\"\"Sorry,\" Matty replied immediately. Stealing had been so much a part of hisprevious existence that he sometimes still, even after years, forgot that it wasnot acceptable behavior in Village.\"Well,\" said the blind man after they had sipped their tea in silence for amoment, \"I wish I could figure out what things people are trading away. You saythey came empty-handed. Yet each one whispered something that was written down.\"\"Except for Ramon's mother,\" Matty reminded him. \"Trademaster said no to her.But others got their trades. Mentor got his.\"\"But we don't know what.\"\"No. 'Same as before,' he asked for.\"\"Tell me this, Matty. When Mentor left the Trade Mart, he hadn't been givenanything, had he? He wasn't carrying anything?\"\"No. Nothing.\"\"Was anyone given anything to take away?\"\"Some were told delivery times. Someone got a Gaming Machine.\"I'd really like a Gaming Machine, Seer,\" Matty added, though he knew it washopeless.But the blind man paid no attention to that. \"One more question for you, Matty.Think hard about this.\"\"All right.\" Matty prepared himself to think hard.\"Try to remember if people looked different when it was over. Not everyone, butthose who had made trades.\"Matty sighed. It had been crowded, and long, and he had begun to beuncomfortable and tired by the time it ended. He had seen Ramon and waved, butRamon was standing with his mother, who was angry at having been turned down byTrademaster. Ramon hadn't waved back.He had looked for Jean, but she wasn't there.\"I can't remember. I wasn't paying attention by the end.\"\"What about the person who got a Gaming Machine? You told me someone did. Whowas it?\"\"That woman who lives over near the marketplace. You know the one? Her husbandwalks hunched over because he has a twisted back. He was with her but he didn'tgo up for a trade.\"\"Yes, I know who you mean. They're a nice family,\" the blind man said. \"So shetraded for a Gaming Machine. Did you see her when she was leaving?\"\"I think so. She was with some other women and they were laughing as they walkedaway.\"\"I thought you said she was with her husband.\"\"She was, but he walked behind.\"\"How did she seem?\"\"Happy, because she got a Gaming Machine. She was telling her friends that theycould come play with it.\"\"But anything else? Was there anything else about her that you remember, fromafter the trade, not before?\"Matty shrugged. He was beginning to be bored by the questioning. He was thinkingabout Jean, and that he might go to see her in the morning. Maybe his puppywould be ready. At least the puppy would be an excuse for a visit. It washealthy now, and growing fast, with big feet and ears; recently he had watched,laughing, when the mother dog had growled at it because it was nipping at herown ears in play.Thinking of the puppy's behavior reminded Matty of something.\"Something was different,\" he said. \"She's a nice woman, the one who got theGaming Machine.\"\"Yes, she is. Gentle. Cheerful. Very loving to her husband.\"\"Well,\" said Matty slowly, \"when she was leaving, walking and talking with theother women, and her husband behind trying to keep up, she whirled aroundsuddenly and scolded him for being slow.\"\"Slow? But he's all twisted. He can't walk any other way,\" the blind man said insurprise.\"I know. But she made a sneering face at him and she imitated his way ofwalking. She made fun of him. It was only for a second, though.\"Seer was silent, rocking. Matty picked up the empty mugs, took them to the sink,and rinsed them.\"It's late,\" the blind man said. \"Time to go to bed.\" He rose from his chair andput his stringed instrument on the shelf where he kept it. He began to walkslowly to his sleeping room. \"Good night, Matty,\" he said.Then he said something else, almost to himself.\"So now she has a Gaming Machine,\" the blind man murmured. His voice soundedscornful.Matty, at the sink, remembered something. \"Mentor's birthmark is completelygone,\" he called to Seer."},{"pageContent":"8The puppy was ready. So was Matty. The other little dog, the one who had beenhis childhood companion for years, had lived a happy, active life, died in hissleep, and had been buried with ceremony and sadness beyond the garden. For along time Matty, missing Branch, had not wanted a new dog. But now it was time,and when Jean summoned him—her message was that Matty had to come right away topick up the puppy, because her father was furious at its mischief—he hurried toher house.He had not been to Mentor's homeplace since Trade Mart the previous week. Theflower garden, as always, was thriving and well tended, with late roses in bloomand fall asters fat with bud. He found Jean there, kneeling by her flower bed,digging with a trowel. She smiled up at him, but it was not her usual saucysmile, fraught with flirtatiousness, the smile that drove Matty nearly mad. Thismorning she seemed troubled.\"He's shut in the shed,\" she told Matty, meaning the puppy. \"Did you bring arope to lead him home?\"\"Don't need one. He'll follow me. I have a way with dogs.\"Jean sighed, set her trowel aside, and wiped her forehead, leaving a smear ofearth that Matty found very appealing. \"I wish I did,\" she said. \"I can'tcontrol him at all. He's grown so fast, and he's very strong and determined. Myfather is beside himself, wanting such a wild little thing gone.\"Matty grinned. \"Mentor deals with lots of wild little things in the schoolhouse.I myself was a wild little thing once, and it was he who tamed me.\"Jean smiled at him. \"I remember. What a ragged, naughty thing you were, Matty,when you came to Village.\"\"I called myself the Fiercest of the Fierce.\"\"You were that,\" Jean agreed with a laugh. \"And now your puppy is.\"\"Is your father home?\"\"No, he's off visiting Stocktender's widow, as usual,\" Jean said with a sigh.\"She's a nice woman.\"Jean nodded. \"She is. I like her. But, Matty...\"Matty, who had been standing, sat down on the grass at the edge of the garden.\"What?\"\"May I tell you something troubling?\"He felt himself awash with affection for Jean. He had for a long time beenattracted to her girlish affectations, her silly charms and wiles. But now, forthe first time, he felt something new. He perceived the young woman behind allthose superficial things. With her curly hair tumbling over her dirt-streakedforehead, she was the most beautiful person Matty had ever seen. And now she wastalking to him in a way that was not foolish and childlike, designed toentrance, but instead was human and pained and adult. He felt suddenly that heloved her, and it was a feeling he had never known before.\"It's about my father,\" she said in a low voice.\"He's changing, isn't he?\" Matty replied, startling himself, because he had notspelled it out in his mind before, had not said it aloud yet, yet here it was,and he was saying it to Jean. He felt an odd sense of relief.Jean began to cry softly. \"Yes,\" she said. \"He has traded his deepest self.\"\"Traded?\" That part took Matty by surprise because he had not thought it throughto there. \"Traded for what?\" Matty asked in horror, and realized he wasrepeating the phrase from Trade Mart.\"For Stocktender's widow,\" she said, weeping. \"He wanted her to love him, so hetraded. He's becoming taller and straighten The bald spot at the back of hishead has grown over with hair, Matty. His birthmark has disappeared.\"Of course. That was it. \"I saw it,\" Matty told her, \"but I didn't understand.\"He put his arm around the sobbing girl.She caught her breath finally. \"I didn't know how lonely he was, Matty. If I hadknown...\"\"So that's why...\" Matty was trying to sort through it in his head.\"The puppy. Once he would have loved a naughty puppy, Matty, the way he lovedyou when you were a raggedy boy. I knew it all for certain yesterday when hekicked the puppy. Till then I only suspected.\" Jean wiped her eyes with the backof her hand and left another endearing streak of dirt.\"And the petition!\" Matty added, thinking of it suddenly.\"Yes. Father always welcomed new ones. It was the most wonderful part of Father,how he cared for everyone and tried to help them learn. But now...\"They heard a loud whimpering from the shed, and a scratching sound.\"Let him out, Jean, and I'll take him home before your father gets back.\"She went to the shed door, opened it, and though her face was tear-streaked now,she smiled at the eager, ungainly puppy who bounded forth, jumped into Matty'sarms, and licked his cheeks. The white tail was a whir.\"I need time to think,\" Matty said, subduing the puppy with a rhythmic scratchbelow his chin.\"What's to think about? There's nothing to be done. Trades are forever. Even ifa stupid thing like a Gaming Machine breaks down, or if you tire of it—you don'tget to reverse.\"He wondered if he should tell her. She had seen the effect of his power on thepuppy and its mother, but hadn't understood. Now, if he chose, perhaps he couldexplain. But he was uncertain about this. He did not know how far his power wentand he did not want to promise this beloved girl something impossible. To repaira man's soul and deepest heart—to reverse an irreversible trade—might be far,far more than Matty could possibly undertake.So he stayed silent, and took his lively puppy away.***\"Look! He sits now when I tell him to.\" Then Matty groaned and said, \"Oh,sorry.\"When would he ever learn to stop saying \"Look\" to a man who had no eyes?But the blind man laughed. \"I don't need to be able to look. I can hear that hesits. The sounds of his feet stop. And I don't feel his teeth on my shoes.\"\"He's smart, I think,\" Matty said optimistically.\"Yes, I think you're right. He's a good little puppy, Matty. He'll learnquickly. You don't need to worry about his mischief.\" The blind man reached outhis hand and the puppy scampered to it and licked his fingers.\"And he's quite beautiful.\" In truth, Matty was trying to convince himself. Thepuppy was a combination of several colors, big feet, a whirligig of a tail, andlopsided ears.\"I'm sure he is.\"\"He'll need a name. I haven't thought of the right one yet.\"\"His true name will come to you.\"\"I hope I get my own soon,\" Matty said.\"It will come when the time comes.\"Matty nodded and turned back to the dog. \"First I thought of Survivor, becausehe was the only one of the puppies that did. But it's too long. It doesn't soundlike the right one.\" Matty picked up the puppy and scratched its belly as it layon his lap.\"So then...\" Matty began to laugh. \"Since he was the one that lived? I thoughtof Liver for a name.\"\"Liver?\" The blind man laughed as well.\"I know, I know. It was a stupid idea. Liver with onions.\" Matty made a face.He set the puppy on the floor again and it dashed off, tail wagging, to growl atthe logs piled beside the stove and to chew at their edges where raw woodcurled.\"You could ask Leader,\" the blind man suggested. \"He's the one who gives truenames to people. Maybe he'd do it for a puppy.\"\"That's a good idea. I have to go see Leader anyway. It's time to take messagesaround for the meeting. I'll take the puppy with me.\"***Clumsy with his stubby legs and oversized feet, the puppy couldn't manage thestairs at Leader's homeplace. Matty picked him up and carried him, then set himon the floor in the upper room where Leader was waiting at his desk. The stacksof messages were ready. Matty could have taken them and left on his errandwithout pausing. But he lingered. He enjoyed Leader's company. There were thingshe wanted to tell him. He began to put them in order in his mind.\"Do you want to put a paper down for him?\" Leader asked, watching with amusementas the little thing scampered about the room.\"No, he's fine. He never has an accident. It was the first thing he learned.\"Leader leaned back in his chair and stretched. \"He'll be good company for you,Matty, the way Branch was.\"Do you know,\" he went on, \"in the place where I was a child, there were nodogs? No animals at all.\"\"No chickens? Or goats?\"\"No, nothing.\"\"What did you eat, then?\" Matty asked.\"We had fish. Lots of fish, from a hatchery. And plenty of vegetables. But noanimal meat. And no pets at all. I never knew what it meant to have a pet. Oreven to love something and be loved back.\"His words made Matty think of Jean. He felt his face flush a little. \"Did younever love a girl?\" he asked.He thought Leader would laugh. But instead the young man's face becamereflective.\"I had a sister,\" Leader said, after a moment. \"I think of her still, and hopeshe's happy.\"He picked up a pencil from the desk, twirled it in his fingers, and gazedthrough the window. His clear blue eyes seemed to be able to see greatdistances, even into the past, or perhaps the future.Matty hesitated. Then he explained, \"I meant a girl. Not like a sister. Buta—well, a girl.\"Leader put the pencil down and smiled. \"I understand what you mean. There was agirl once, long ago. I was younger than you, Matty, but I was at the age whensuch things begin.\"\"What happened to her?\"\"She changed. And I did too.\"\"Sometimes I think I want nothing to change, ever,\" Matty said with a sigh. Thenhe remembered what he had wanted to tell Leader.\"Leader, I went to Trade Mart,\" he said. \"I hadn't been before.\"Leader shrugged. \"I wish they'd vote to end it,\" he said. \"I never go anymore,but I did in the past. It seemed folly and time-wasting. Now it seems worse.\"\"It's the only way to get something like a Gaming Machine.\"Leader made a face. \"A Gaming Machine,\" he commented with disdain.\"Well, I'd like one,\" Matty grumbled. \"But Seer says no.\"The puppy wandered to a corner of the room, sniffed, made a circle of himself,collapsed, and fell asleep. Matty and Leader, together, watched it and smiled.\"It isn't just Gaming Machines and such.\" Matty had wondered how to say it, howto describe it. Now, into the silence, as they watched the sleeping puppy, hefound himself simply blurting it out. \"Something else is happening at TradeMart. People are changing, Leader. Mentor is.\"\"I've seen the changes in him,\" Leader acknowledged. \"What are you telling me,Matty?\"\"Mentor has traded away his deepest self,\" Matty said, \"and I think that othersare, too.\"Leader leaned forward and listened intently as Matty described what he had seen,what he suspected, and what he knew.***\"Leader gave me a name for him, but I don't know if I like it.\"Matty was back home by lunchtime, after delivering the last of the messages. Theblind man was at the sink, washing some clothes.\"And what is it?\" he asked, turning toward Matty's voice.\"Frolic.\"\"Hmmmm. It has a nice sound to it. How does the puppy feel about it?\"Matty lifted the puppy from where it had been riding, curled up inside hisjacket. For most of the morning it had followed him, scampering at his heels,but eventually its short legs had tired, and Matty had carried it the rest ofthe way.The puppy blinked—he had been asleep in the jacket—and Matty set him on thefloor.\"Frolic?\" Matty said, and the puppy looked up. His tail churned.\"Sit, Frolic!\" Matty said. The puppy sat instantly. He looked intently at Matty.\"He did!\" Matty told the blind man in delight.\"Lie down, Frolic!\"After a flicker of a pause, the puppy reluctantly sank to the floor and touchedthe rug with his small nose.\"He knows his true name already!\" Matty knelt beside the puppy and stroked thelittle head. \"Good puppy,\" he said. The big brown eyes gazed up at him and thespotted body, still sprawled obediently on the floor, quivered with affection.\"Good Frolic,\" Matty said."},{"pageContent":"9There was much talk in Village about the coming meeting. Matty heard iteverywhere, people arguing about the petition.By now, some of the latest group of new ones were out and about, their soresclearing up, their clothes clean and hair combed, frightened faces eased, andtheir haunted, desperate attitudes changing to something more serene. Theirchildren played, now, with other children of Village, racing down the lanes andpaths in games of tag and hide-and-seek. Watching them, Matty remembered his ownchild self, his bravado and the terrible anguish it had concealed. He had notbelieved anyone would want him, ever, until he came to Village, and even then hehad not trusted in its kindness for a long time.With Frolic scampering at his heels, Matty made his way toward the marketplaceto buy some bread.\"Good morning!\" he called cheerfully to a woman he encountered on the path. Shewas one of the new ones, and he remembered her from the recent welcome. Her eyeshad been wide in her gaunt face that day. She was scarred, as if by untendedwounds, and one arm was held crookedly, so that it was awkward for her to dothings.But today she looked relaxed, and was making her unhurried way along the path.She smiled at Matty's greeting.\"Stop it, Frolic! Down!\" Matty scolded his puppy, who had jumped to grab and tugat the frayed edge of the woman's skirt. Grudgingly Frolic obeyed him.The woman leaned down to pat Frolic's head. \"It's all right,\" she said softly.\"I had a dog once. I had to leave him behind.\" She had a slight accent. Like somany of the people in Village, she had brought her way of speaking from her oldplace.\"Are you settling in?\"\"Yes,\" she told him. \"People are kind. They're patient with me. I've beeninjured, and I have to relearn some things. It will take time.\"\"Patience is important here, because we have so many in Village who havedifficulties,\" Matty explained. \"My father...\"He paused and corrected himself. \"I mean the man I live with. He is called Seer.You've probably met him. He's blind. He strides around everywhere on the pathswithout a problem. But when he first arrived and had just lost his eyes...\"\"I have a concern,\" the woman said suddenly, and he knew it was not a concernabout the condition of the paths or directions to the buildings. He could seethat she was worried.\"You can take any concern to Leader.\"She shook her head. \"Maybe you can answer. It's about the closing of Village. Ihear talk of a petition.\"\"But you're already here!\" Matty reassured her. \"You needn't worry! You're partof us now. They won't send you away, even if they close Village.\"\"I brought my boy with me. Vladik. He's about your age. Maybe you've noticedhim?\"Matty shook his head. He hadn't noticed the boy. There had been a large crowd ofnew ones. He wondered why the woman would be worried for her son. Perhaps he washaving trouble adjusting to Village. Some new ones did. Matty himself had.\"When I came,\" he told her, \"I was scared. Lonely, too, I think. And I behavedbadly. I lied and stole. But look—now I am fine. I'm hoping to get my true namesoon.\"\"No, no. My boy's a good boy,\" she said. \"He doesn't lie or steal. And he'sstrong and eager. They have him working in the fields already. And soon he'll goto school.\"\"Well, then, no need to worry about him.\"She shook her head. \"No, I don't worry about him. It's my others. I broughtVladik but I had to leave my other children behind. We came first, my boy and I,to find the way. It was such a long, hard trip.\"The others are to come later. The little ones. My sister will bring them afterI have made a place here.\"Her voice faltered. \"But now I hear people saying that the border will close. Idon't know what to do. I think maybe I should go back. Leave Vladik here, tomake a life, and go back to my little ones.\"Matty hesitated. He didn't know what to say to her. Could she go back? She hadbeen here only briefly, so it was not yet too late. Surely Forest would notentangle the poor woman yet. But if she did, what would she go back to? Hedidn't know how the woman had been injured. But he knew that in some places—ithad been true, too, in Matty's old place—people were punished in terrible ways.He glanced at her scars, at her unset broken arm, and wondered if she had beenstoned.Of course she wanted to bring her children to the safety of Village.\"They'll be voting tomorrow,\" Matty explained. \"You and I can't vote because wedon't yet have our true names. But we can go and listen to the debate. We canspeak if we want. And we can watch the vote.\"He told her how to find the platform before which the people would gather. Usingher good hand, the woman grasped Matty's hands with a warm gesture of thanks asshe turned away.At the market stall he bought a loaf of bread from Jean, who tucked achrysanthemum blossom into the wrapping. She smiled at Frolic and leaned down tolet him lick some crumbs from her fingers.\"Are you going to the meeting tomorrow?\" he asked her.\"I suppose so. It's all my father talks about.\" Jean sighed and began torearrange her wares on the table.\"Once it was books and poetry,\" she said with sudden and passionate anguish. \"Iremember when I was small, after my mother died, he would tell me stories andrecite poems at dinner. Then, later, he told me about the people who had writtenthem.\"By the time we studied it in school—you remember, Matty, studyingliterature?—it was all so familiar to me, because of the way he had taught mewhen I didn't even know he was teaching.\"Matty remembered. \"He used different voices. Remember Lady Macbeth? 'Out, damn'dspot! Out, I say!'\" He tried to repeat the lines with the sinister yet regalvoice Mentor had used.Jean laughed. \"And Macduff! I cried when my father recited Macduff's speechabout the deaths of his wife and children.\"Matty remembered that speech as well. Standing by the bakery stall with Frolicscampering about at their feet, Matty and Jean recited the lines together.> All my pretty ones?> Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?> What! all my pretty chickens and their dam> At one fell swoop?...> I cannot but remember such things were,> That were most precious to me.Then Jean turned away. She continued restacking the loaves on her table, butclearly her thoughts were someplace else. Finally she looked up at Matty andsaid in a puzzled voice, \"It was so important to him, and he made it importantto me: poetry, and language, and how we use it to remind ourselves of how ourlives should be lived...\"Then her tone changed and became embittered. \"Now he talks of nothing butStocktender's widow, and of closing Village to new ones. What has happened to myfather?\"Matty shook his head. He did not know the answer.The recitation of Macduff's famous speech had reminded him of the woman he hadspoken to on the path, the woman who feared for her lost children's future. Allmy pretty ones.Suddenly he felt that they were all of them doomed.He had forgotten completely about his own power. He had forgotten the frog."},{"pageContent":"10The meeting to discuss and vote on the petition began in the orderly, carefulway such meetings had always been handled. Leader stood on the platform, readthe petition in his strong, clear voice, and opened the meeting to debate. Oneby one the people of Village stood and gave their opinions.The new ones had come. Matty could see the woman he had met on the path,standing beside a tall, light-haired boy who must be Vladik. The two were with agroup of new ones who had a place apart, since they could not vote.Small children, bored, played along the edge of the pine grove. Matty had oncebeen like them, when he was new here and hadn't liked meetings or debates. Butnow he stood with Seer and the other adults. He paid attention. He had not evenbrought Frolic, who usually accompanied Matty everywhere. Today the puppy wasleft at home, whimpering behind the closed door as they walked away.It was frighteningly obvious now, with the population gathered, that somethingterrible was happening. At Trade Mart it had been evening, dark, and Matty hadbeen so interested in the proceedings that he had not noticed many individuals,only those who went to the platform, like Mentor, and the woman who had been sooddly cruel to her husband as they started home.Now, though, it was bright daylight. Matty was able to watch everyone, and tohis horror he could see the changes.Near him stood his friend Ramon, with his parents and younger sister. It wasRamon's mother who had asked to trade for a fur jacket and been denied. But theyhad had a Gaming Machine for quite a while, and so a trade had been made in thepast. Matty looked carefully at his friend's family. He had not seen Ramon sincethe day recently when he had suggested a fishing expedition and been told thatRamon was not well.Ramon glanced at Matty and smiled. But Matty held his breath for a moment,dismayed to see that indeed his friend was ill. Ramon's face was no longertanned and rosy-cheeked but instead seemed thin and gray. Beside him, his littlesister seemed sick, too; her eyes were sunken and Matty could hear her cough.Once, he knew, her mother would have leaned down to tend the little girl at thesound of such a cough. Now, while Matty watched, the woman simply shook thechild roughly by a shoulder and said, \"Shhhh.\"One by one the people spoke, and one by one Matty identified those who hadtraded. Some of those who had been among the most industrious, the kindest, andthe most stalwart citizens of Village now went to the platform and shouted outtheir wish that the border be closed so that \"we\" (Matty shuddered at the use of\"we\") would not have to share the resources anymore.We need all the fish for ourselves.Our school is not big enough to teach their children, too; only our own.They can't even speak right. We can't understand them.They have too many needs. We don't want to take care of them.And finally: We've done it long enough.Now and then a lone citizen, untouched by trade, would go to the platform andtry to speak. They spoke of the history of Village, how each of them there hadfled poverty and cruelty and been welcomed at this new place that had taken themin.The blind man spoke eloquently of the day he had been brought here half dead andbeen tended for months by the people of Village until, though he was stillwithout sight, it had become his true home. Matty had been wondering whether he,too, would go up and speak. He wanted to, for surely Village had also become histrue home, and saved him, but he felt a little shy. Then he heard the blind manbegin to speak on his behalf:\"My boy came here six years ago as a child. Many of you remember the Matty hewas then. He fought and swore and stole.\"Matty liked the sound of the phrase \"my boy,\" which he had never heard the blindman use before. But he was embarrassed to see people turn and look at him.\"Village changed him and made him what he is now,\" the blind man said. \"He willreceive his true name soon.\"For a moment Matty hoped that Leader, who was still standing on the platform,would hold up his hand to call for silence, would call Matty, place his hand onMatty's forehead, then announce the true name. It happened that way, sometimes.Messenger. Matty held his breath, hoping for that.But instead he heard another voice, not Leader's.\"I remember what he was like! If we close the border, we won't have to do thatanymore! We won't have to deal with thieves and braggarts and people who havelice in their hair, the way Matty did then, when he came!\"Matty turned to look. It was a woman. He was stunned, as if someone had slappedhim. It was his own neighbor, the very woman who had made clothes for him whenhe came. He remembered standing there in his rags while she measured him andthen put on her thimble to stitch the clothing for him. She had a soft voicethen, and talked gently to him while she sewed.Now she had a sewing machine, a very fancy one, and bolts of fabric with whichshe created fine clothing. Now the blind man stitched the simple things that heand Matty needed.So she, too, had traded, and was turning not only on him, but on all new ones.Her voice incited others, and now large numbers of people were calling out,\"Close Village! Close the border!\"Matty had never seen Leader look so sad.***When it was over, and the vote to close Village had been finalized, Mattytrudged home beside the blind man. At first they were silent. There was nothingto be said. Their world had changed now.After a bit Matty tried to talk, to be cheerful, to make the best of things.\"I suppose he'll send me out now to all the other villages and communities withthe message. I'll be doing a lot of traveling. I'm glad it isn't winter yet.It's hard in snow.\"\"He came in snow,\" the blind man said. \"He knows what it's like.\"Matty wondered for a moment what he was talking about. Who? Oh yes, he thought.The little sled.\"Leader knows better than anyone about things,\" Matty remarked. \"And he's stillyounger than many.\"\"He sees beyond,\" Seer said.\"What?\"\"He has a special gift. Some people do. Leader sees beyond.\"Matty was startled. He had noticed the quality of Leader's pale blue eyes, howthey seemed to have a kind of vision most people didn't have. But he had notheard it described that way before.It made him think of what he had only recently come to know about himself.\"So some people, like Leader, have a special gift?\"\"It's true,\" Seer replied.\"Is it always the same? Is it always—what did you say?—seeing beyond?\"They were nearing the curve in the path where it branched off and led to theirhomeplace. Matty watched in awe, as he always did, how the blind man felt thecoming curve and knew even in his darkness where to turn.\"No. It's different for different people.\"\"Do you have it? Is that how you know where to walk?\"The blind man laughed. \"No. I've learned that. I've been without eyes for manyyears. At first I stumbled and bumped into things. People had to help me all thetime. Of course in the old days in Village, people were quick to help andguide.\"His voice became bitter. \"Who knows what will happen now?\"They had arrived at the house and could hear Frolic scratching at the door andwoofing in excitement at the sound of their approach.Matty didn't want the conversation to end here. He wanted to tell the blind manabout himself, about his secret.\"So you don't have a special gift, like Leader, but other people do?\"\"My daughter does. She told me of it that night, the night you took me to her.\"\"Kira? She has a special gift?\"\"Yes, your old friend Kira. The one who taught you manners.\"Matty ignored that. \"She must be all grown up now. I saw her last time I wasthere, but it's been almost two years. But, Seer, what do you mean...\"The blind man stopped unexpectedly on the steps leading to the door. \"Matty!\" hesaid with sudden urgency.\"What?\"\"I've just realized. The border will be closing in three weeks.\"\"Yes.\"Seer sat down on the steps. He put his head in his hands. Sometimes he did thatwhen he was thinking. Matty sat beside him and waited. He could hear Frolicinside, throwing himself against the door in frustration.Finally the blind man spoke. \"I want you to go to your old village, Matty.Leader will be sending you anyway, with the message.\"He'll no doubt send you to several places. But, Matty, I want you to go to yourold village first. Leader will understand.\"\"But I don't.\"\"My daughter. She said some day she would come here to live, when the time wasright. You know her, Matty. You know she had things to accomplish there first.\"\"Yes. And she has, Seer. I could tell when I was last there. Things havechanged. People take good care of their children now. And...\"He hesitated, unable to speak for a moment, because the memory of his own abusehad returned. Then he added simply, \"Kira made things change. Things are betternow.\"\"There are only three weeks left, Matty. After the border closes it will be toolate. She won't be allowed to come. You must bring her here before that happens.\"If you don't, Matty, I will never see her again.\"\"It always seems strange to me when you say 'see.'\"The blind man smiled. \"I see in my heart, Matty.\"Matty nodded. \"I know you do. I'll bring her to you. I'll leave here tomorrow.\"Together they rose. Evening was coming. Matty opened the door and Frolic leapedinto his arms."},{"pageContent":"11\"Tuck it inside your shirt, Matty, so it won't get rumpled. You have a longjourney ahead.\"Matty took the packet of folded messages in the thick envelope, and placed itwhere Leader indicated, inside his shirt next to his chest. He didn't say so toLeader, but he thought that later, when he gathered his traveling things, hewould probably find a different place for the envelope. He would put it with hisfood supplies and blanket. It was true that here, inside his shirt, was thesafest and cleanest place. But he had planned to carry Frolic there, against hischest.There was not time, in three weeks, to make journeys to all the other places andcommunities. Some of them were many days away, and a few places could be reachedonly by riverboat. Matty was not qualified to go by river; the man called Boaterwas always the one who took messages and trading goods by that route.But it had been decided that the message would be posted on every paththroughout Forest, so that any new ones coming would see it and turn back. Mattywas the only one who knew all the paths, who was not afraid to enter Forest andtravel in that dangerous place. He would post the messages there. And he wouldgo on to his own old place as well. There had been ongoing communication betweenthat place and Village for years; now they must be told of the new ruling.Leader was standing now at the window, as he so often did, looking down atVillage and the people below. Matty waited. He was in a hurry to be off, tobegin his long journey, but he had a feeling there was something that Leaderwanted to tell him, something still unsaid.Finally Leader turned to Matty, standing beside him. \"He's told you that I seebeyond, hasn't he?\"\"Yes. He says you have a special gift. His daughter does, too.\"\"His daughter. That would be the girl called Kira, the one who helped you leaveyour old place. He never talks about her.\"\"It makes him too sad. But he thinks about her all the time.\"\"And you say she has a gift, too?\"\"Yes. But hers is different. Each gift is different, Seer said.\"Do you know about mine? Matty thought. But he did not need to ask.As if he had read Matty's mind, Leader told him, \"I know of yours.\"Matty shuddered. The gift still frightened him so. \"I kept it secret,\" he saidapologetically. \"I haven't even told Seer. I didn't want to be secretive. ButI'm still trying to understand it. I try to put it out of my mind. I try toforget that it's there inside me. But then it just appears. I can feel itcoming. I don't know how to stop it.\"\"Don't try. If it comes without your summoning it, it is because of need.Because someone needs your gift.\"\"A frog? It was a frog first!\"\"It was to show you. It always starts with a small thing. For me? The very firsttime I saw beyond? It was an apple.\"Despite the solemnity of the conversation, Matty chuckled. A frog and an apple.And a puppy, he realized.\"Wait for the true need, Matty. Don't spend the gift.\"\"But how will I know?\"Leader smiled. He rubbed Matty's shoulder affectionately. \"You'll know,\" hesaid.Matty looked around for Frolic and saw that he was curled in the corner, asleep.\"I should go. I haven't packed my things yet. And I want to stop by and tellJean I'm going, so she won't wonder where I am.Leader kept him there within the comfortable curve of his arm. \"Matty, wait,\" hesaid. \"I want to...\" Then he gazed through the window again. Matty stood there,wondering what he was to wait for. Then he felt something. The weight of theyoung man's arm took on a quality of something beyond human flesh. It came alivewith power. Matty felt it from the arm, but he knew, as well, that it waspervading all of Leader's being. He understood that it was Leader's gift atwork.Finally, after what seemed an unendurable few moments, Leader lifted his armaway from Matty. He exhaled. His body sagged slightly. Matty helped him to achair and he sat there, exhausted, breathing hard.\"Forest is thickening,\" Leader said when he could speak.Matty didn't know what he meant. It sounded ominous. But when he looked throughthe window, to the row of underbrush and pines that was the border of Forest, itlooked no different to him.\"I don't understand it exactly,\" Leader said. \"But I can see a thickening toForest, like a...\" He hesitated.\"I was going to say like a clotting of blood. Things turning sluggish and sick.\"Matty looked through the window again. \"The trees are just the same, Leader.There's a storm coming, though. You can hear the wind. And look. The sky isturning dark. Maybe that's what you saw.\"Leader shook his head skeptically. \"No. It was Forest I saw. I'm sure. It's hardto describe, Matty, but I was trying to look through Forest in order to get afeeling for Seer's daughter. And it was very, very hard to push through. Itwas—well, thick.\"I think you had better not go, Matty. I'm sorry. I know you love making yourjourneys, and that you take pride in being the only one who can. But I thinkthere may be danger in Forest this time.\"Matty's heart sank. He had hoped to be given his true name, Messenger, becauseof this trip. At the same time, something told him that Leader might be right.Then he remembered. \"Leader, I have to!\"\"No. We can post the messages at the entrance to Village. It will mean new oneswill have to turn back after terribly long journeys, and that's tragic. But—\"\"No, it's not the messages! It's Seer's daughter! I promised him I would go andbring Kira home. It will be her last chance to come. His last chance to be withher.\"\"And she will want to come?\"\"I'm sure she will. She always intended to someday. And she has no family there.She's old enough to marry, but no one would want her. Her leg is crooked. Shewalks with a stick.\"Leader took several deep breaths. \"Matty,\" he said, \"I'm going to try again tosee beyond Forest. I'm going to try to see Seer's daughter and her needs. Youmay stay with me now, because whether you make this journey will depend on whatI learn. But be aware that it is very hard for me to do this twice in a row.Don't be distressed as you watch.\"He stood again and went to the window. Matty, knowing he could be of no help,went to the corner where Frolic was asleep and sat down beside his puppy. Fromthere he watched Leader's body tense, as if he were in pain. He heard Leadergasp and then moan slightly.The young man's blue eyes remained open but no longer seemed to be looking atthe ordinary things in the room or through the window. He had gone, eyes andwhole being, far into a place that Matty could not perceive and where no onecould follow him.He seemed to shimmer.Finally he slumped into the chair, shaking, and tried to catch his breath.Matty went to him, stood beside him, and waited while Leader rested. Heremembered how he felt after he had healed the puppy and its mother. Heremembered the desperate need to sleep.\"I reached where she is,\" Leader said when he could speak again.\"Did she know you were there? Could she feel you there?\"Leader shook his head. \"No. To make her aware of me would have taken more energythan I had. It's so very far, and Forest is so thick now, to go through.\"Matty had a sudden thought. \"Leader? Do you think two gifts could meet?\"Leader, still breathing hard, stared at him. \"What do you mean?\"\"I'm not sure. But what if you could go halfway—and she could, too? So you couldmeet in the middle with your gifts? It wouldn't be so hard if you only wenthalfway. If you met.\"Leader's eyes were closed, now. \"I don't know, Matty,\" he said.Matty waited but Leader said nothing more, and after a while Matty feared he wasasleep. \"Frolic?\" he called, and the puppy woke, stirred, and came to him.\"Leader,\" Matty said, leaning close to him, \"I'm going to go. I'm going to getthe blind man's daughter.\"\"Be very careful,\" Leader murmured. His eyes were closed. \"It is dangerous now.\"\"I will. I always am.\"\"Don't waste your gift. Don't spend it.\"\"I won't,\" Matty replied, though he was not certain what the words meant.\"Matty?\"\"Yes?\" He was at the top of the stairs now, holding Frolic, who still couldn'tmanage the staircase on his own.\"She's quite lovely, isn't she?\"Matty shrugged. He understood that Leader was referring to Kira but the blindman's daughter was older than he. She had been like a big sister to him. No onein the old place had thought her lovely. They had been contemptuous of herweakness.\"She has a crooked leg,\" Matty reminded Leader. \"She leans on a stick to walk.\"\"Yes,\" Leader said. \"She's very lovely.\" But his voice was hard to hear now, andin a second he was asleep. Matty, holding Frolic, hurried down the stairs.***It was late in the day by the time Matty was ready to go. It had rained heavily,and though the rain had stopped, wind still blew, and the leaves of the treesfluttered and revealed their pale undersides. The sky was dark, from the stormand from the approach of evening.He placed the packet of messages inside his rolled blanket. By the sink, theblind man was putting food into Matty's backpack. He could not carry enough forthe entire journey; it was too long. But Matty was accustomed to living on thefood that Forest provided. He would feed himself along the way when what Seerpacked was gone.\"While you're away, I'll be fixing the spare room for her. Tell her that, Matty.She'll have a comfortable place to live. And she can have a garden. I knowthat's important to her. She's never been without a garden.\"\"I won't need to convince her. She's always said she'd come when the time wasright. Now it is. Leader could tell. So she'll know, too. You said she has agift.\" Matty, folding a sweater, tried to reassure the blind man.\"It's hard to leave the only place you've known.\"\"You did it,\" Matty reminded him.\"I had no choice. I was brought here when they found me in Forest with my eyesgone.\"\"Well, I did it. Many have.\"\"Yes. That's true. But I hope it won't be hard for her.\"Matty glanced over. \"Don't put those beets in. I hate beets.\"\"They're good for you.\"\"Not if they're thrown on the ground. And that's what they'll be if you put themin.\"The blind man chuckled and dropped the beets into the sink. \"Well,\" he said,\"they're heavy anyway. They'd weigh you down. But I'm putting carrots in.\"\"Anything but beets.\"There was a knock on the door, and it was Jean, her hair curlier than usual fromthe dampness that remained after the rain. \"Are you still going, Matty, in thisweather?\"Matty laughed at her concern. \"I've gone through Forest in snow,\" he boasted.\"This weather is nothing. Yes, I'm about to leave. I'm just packing food.\"\"I've brought you some bread,\" she said, and took the wrapped loaf from thebasket she carried. He noticed that she had decorated it with a leafy sprig anda yellow chrysanthemum blossom.Matty took the loaf and thanked her, though secretly he wondered how he wouldever fit it in. Finally the blind man found a way to tuck it inside the rolledblanket.\"I want to stop on my way out of Village and see Ramon,\" Matty said. \"I'd betterhurry or I'll never get started.\"\"Oh, Matty,\" Jean said. \"You don't know? Ramon's very sick. His sister, too.They've put a sign on the door to their house. No one can enter.\"Troubling though the news was, Matty was not surprised. Ramon had been coughing,feverish-looking, and increasingly unwell for days now. \"What does Herbalistsay?\"\"That's why they put the sign up. Herbalist is afraid it may be contagious. Thatan epidemic could come.\"What was happening to Village? Matty felt a terrible unease. There had neverbeen an epidemic here. He remembered the place he had come from, where many haddied, from time to time, and all of their belongings had been burned, after, inhopes of destroying the illnesses carried by filth or fleas or, some thought,sorcery. But it had never happened here. People had always been so careful here,so clean.He could see that the blind man's face had taken on a worried look, too, at thenews.For a moment, Matty stood there thinking while Seer arranged his pack on hisback and attached the rolled blanket below it. He thought of the frog first,then the puppy, and wondered if his gift could save his friend. He could go toRamon's house now, and place his hands upon the feverish body. He knew it wouldbe indescribably hard, would take all of his strength, but he thought theremight be a chance.But what then? If he himself survived such an attempt, he would be desperatelyweakened, he knew, and would have to recover. He could not possibly make thejourney through Forest if he first weakened himself on Ramon's behalf. Forestwas already thickening, he knew, whatever that meant. It would soon becomeimpassable. The blind man's daughter would be lost to them forever.And, most important, Leader had told him to save his gift. Don't spend it,Leader had said.So Matty decided with regret that he would have to leave Ramon to his illness.\"Look,\" Jean said suddenly. \"Look at this. It's different. \"Matty glanced over and saw that she was standing in front of the tapestry Kirahad made for her father. Even from where he stood, he could see what Jean meant.The entire forest area, the hundreds of tiny stitches in shades of green, haddarkened, and the threads had knotted and twisted in odd ways. The peacefulscene had changed into something no longer beautiful. It had an ominous feel toit, a feel of impenetrability.He went near to it and stared at it, puzzled and alarmed.\"What is it, Matty?\" Jean asked.\"Nothing. It's all right.\" He indicated with his eyes that she should not speakaloud of the odd change in the tapestry. Matty did not want Seer to know.It was time to go.He wriggled his shoulders to adjust the pack comfortably on his back, and leanedforward to hug the blind man, who murmured to him, \"Be safe.\"To his surprise, Jean kissed him. So often in the past, teasing, she had saidshe would, one day. Now she did, and it was a quick and fragrant touch to hislips that gave him courage and, even before he started out, made him yearn tocome back home."},{"pageContent":"12Frolic was afraid of the dark. Matty had never noticed it before, because alwaysthey had been indoors, with the oil lamp glowing, at night. He laughed a littleto hear the puppy whimper in fear when night fell and Forest turned black. Hepicked him up and murmured words of reassurance but could feel the dog's bodytremble, still, in his arms.Well, thought Matty, it was time to sleep, anyway. He was quite near theclearing where the frog had been and perhaps still was. Carefully he made hisway across the soft moss, holding Frolic against his chest and feeling the waywith his feet. Then he knelt in the gnarled root bed of a tall tree and removedhis pack. He unrolled the blanket, fed Frolic a few pieces torn from the loaf ofbread, nibbled at it himself, and then curled up with his puppy and drifted off.Churrump.Churrump.Frolic raised his head. His nose twitched and he flicked his ears curiously atthe sound. But then he buried his head again under the curve of Matty's arm.Soon he too slept.***The days of the journey passed, and after the fourth night, the food was gone.But Matty was strong and unafraid, and to his surprise, little Frolic did notneed to be carried. The puppy followed him and sat watching patiently as heposted the messages along divergent paths. Doing so lengthened the journeyconsiderably. If he had gone straight through, he would be approaching Kira'svillage, his own home in the past, quite soon. But he reminded himself thatbeing a messenger was his most important task, and so he took the side paths,walked great distances, and left the message of Village's closure at each placewhere new ones coming could be advised to turn back.The scarred woman and her group had come from the east, he knew. There was alook that identified the easterners. He could see, on the path to the east,remaining bits of evidence that they had come through not long before: crushedunderbrush where they had huddled to sleep, chunks of charcoal where a fire hadbeen, a pink ribbon that had fallen, Matty thought, from a child's hair. Hepicked it up and put it in his backpack.He wondered if the woman had left her son behind and returned alone to her otherchildren by now. There was no sign of her.The weather remained clear and he was grateful for that, because although he hadbragged about past journeys through snow, in truth it was very hard to fight theelements, and almost impossible to find food in bad weather. Now there wereearly-fall berries and many nuts; he laughed at the chattering squirrels whowere storing their own provisions, and with little guilt robbed a nest he foundthat was half filled with winter fare.He knew places to fish, and the best way to catch them. Frolic turned up hisnose at fish, even after Matty had grilled one on his small fire.\"Go hungry, then,\" Matty told him, laughing, and finished the browned,glistening fish himself. Then, as he watched, Frolic cocked his ears, listening,and dashed off. Matty heard a squawk, then a flurry of wings and rustling leavesand growls. After a bit, Frolic returned, looking satisfied, and with a bit offeather stuck to his whiskers.\"So? I had fish, you had bird.\" It amused Matty to talk to Frolic as if he werehuman. Since his other puppy had died, he had always traveled the paths alone.Now it was a treat to have company, and sometimes he felt that Frolic understoodevery word he said.Although it was a subtle change, he understood what Leader had meant when hesaid that Forest was thickening. Matty knew Forest so well that he couldanticipate changes that came with the seasons. Ordinarily, at summer's end, asnow, some leaves would be falling, and by the time snow came, later, many treeswould be bare. In the heart of winter, he needed to find water at the placeswhere streams rushed quickly and didn't freeze; many of the quiet pools he knewwell would be coated with ice. In spring there would be irritating insects tobrush from his face, but there would be fresh, sweet berries then, too.Always, though, it was familiar.But on this journey, something was different. For the first time, Matty felthostility from Forest. The fish were slow to come to his hook. A chipmunk,usually an amiable companion, chittered angrily and bit his finger when he heldhis hand toward it. Many red berries, of a kind he had always eaten, had blackspots on them and tasted bitter; and for the first time he noticed poison ivygrowing across the path again and again, where it had never grown before.It was darker, too. The trees seemed to have moved at their tops, leaning towardeach other to create a roof across the path; they would protect him from rain,he realized, and perhaps that was a good thing. But they didn't seem benevolent.They created darkness in the middle of day, and shadows that distorted the pathand made him stumble from time to time on roots and rocks.And it smelled bad. There was a stench to Forest now, as if it concealed dead,decaying things in the new thick darkness.Camping in a clearing that he knew well from previous journeys, Matty sat on alog that he had often used as a seat while he cooked his meal. Suddenly itcrumbled under him, and he had to pick himself up and brush rotting bark andslimy, foul-smelling material from his clothing. The piece of log that had beenthere so long, sturdy and useful, had simply fallen into chunks of deadvegetative matter; never again would it provide Matty a place to rest. He kickedit away and watched countless dislodged beetles scurry to new hiding places.He began to have trouble sleeping. Nightmares tormented him. His head achedsuddenly, and his throat was sore.But he was not far, now, from his destination. So he trudged on. To diverthimself from the discomfort that Forest had become, he thought about himself asa little boy. He remembered his earliest days when he had called himself theFiercest of the Fierce, and his friendship then with the girl named Kira who wasthe blind man's daughter."},{"pageContent":"13Such a swaggering, brash little boy he had been! With no father, and only animpoverished, embittered mother to try to make a life for children she had notwanted and did not love, Matty had turned to a life of small crimes and spiritedmischief. Most of his time had been spent with a ragtag band of dirty-faced boyswho carried out whatever schemes they could to survive. The harshness of hishomeplace led him to thievery and deceit; had he been grown, he would have beenimprisoned or worse.But there had always been a gentle side to Matty, even when he had disguised it.He had loved his dog, a mongrel he had found injured and had nursed back tohealth. And he had come, eventually, to love the crippled girl called Kira, whohad never known her father, and whose mother had died suddenly and left heralone.\"Mascot,\" Kira had called him, laughing. \"Sidekick.\" She had made him wash,taught him manners, and told him stories.\"I be the Fiercest of the Fierce!\" he had bragged to her once.\"You are the dirtiest of the dirty faces,\" she had said, laughing, in reply, andgiven him the first bath he ever had. He had struggled and protested, but intruth had loved the feel of warm water. He had never learned to love soap,though Kira gave him some for his own. But he felt the years of grime slip fromhim and knew that he could turn into someone cleaner, better.Roaming as he always had, Matty had learned the intricate paths of Forest. Oneday he had found his way to Village for the first time, and had met the blindman there.\"She lives?\" the blind man had asked him, unbelieving. \"My daughter is alive?\"It was very dangerous for the blind man to return. Those who had tried to killhim, who had left him for dead years before, thought they had succeeded. Theywould have slain him instantly had he found his way back. But Matty, a master ofstealth, had brought him secretly, at night, to meet his daughter for the firsttime. He watched from a corner of the room as Kira recognized the broken stonethat Seer wore as an amulet, and matched it to her own, fitting it to thefragment given to her by her dying mother. Matty saw the blind man touch hisdaughter's face, to learn her, and he watched in silence as they mourned Kira'smother together, their hearts connected by the loss.Then, when darkness came the next night, he had led the blind man back again.But Kira would not come. Not then.\"Someday,\" she had told Matty and her father when they begged her to return withthem to Village. \"I'll come someday. There's time still. And I have things to dohere first.\"\"I suppose there's a young man,\" the blind man had said to Matty as theytraveled back without her. \"She's the age for it.\"\"Nah,\" Matty had said scornfully. \"Not Kira. She has better stuff on her mind.\"Anyways,\" he had added, referring to her twisted leg, \"she has that horridgimp. No one can marry iffen they got a gimp. She's lucky they didn't feed herto the beasts. They wanted to. They only kept her 'cause she could do thingsthey needed.\"\"What things?\"\"She grows flowers, and—\"\"Her mother did, too.\"\"Yes, her mum taught her, and to make the colors from them.\"\"Dyes?\"\"Yes, she dyes the threads and then she makes pictures from them. No one elsecan do it. She has like a magic touch, they say. And they want her for that.\"\"She would be honored in Village. Not only for her talent but for her twistedleg.\"\"Turn here.\" Matty took the blind man's arm and guided him to the right side ofa turning in the path. \"Watch the roots there.\" He noticed that a root lifteditself and stabbed slightly at the man's sandaled foot. It made him verynervous, guiding on this return trip, because he could feel, being familiar withit, that Forest was giving small Warnings to the blind man. He would not beallowed to come through again.\"She'll come when she's ready,\" he reassured Kira's father. \"And till then, I'llgo back and forth between.\"But it had been two years since he had last seen Kira.***Matty emerged from Forest with a stumble, blinking at the sudden sunshine, forhe had been in the dim thickness of trees for many days now and felt that he hadalmost forgotten light.He fell on the path and sat there panting, slightly dizzy, with Frolic pawingworriedly at his leg. In the past he had always—what would the word be?strolled—from Forest, sometimes whistling. But this was different. He felt thathe had been expelled. Chewed up and spat out. When he looked back toward thetrees, in the direction he had come, it seemed inhospitable, unwelcoming, lockeddown.He knew he would have to reenter Forest and return by those same dark paths thatnow seemed so ominous. He would have to lead Kira through, to the safety of herfuture with her father. And he knew suddenly that it would be his last journeyin that place.There was not much time left, and he would not be able to linger here, to lookup his boyhood pals, to reminisce with them about their pranks, or to brag alittle about his status now. He usually did that when he came. He would not evenhave time to say goodbye to the stranger his brother had become.Village would close in three weeks from the time of the proclamation. Matty hadcalculated very carefully. He had counted the days of his journey, adding in theextra days it took for his side trips to tack the messages in place. Now he hadjust enough time to rest, which he badly needed to do, collect food for thereturn journey, and persuade Kira to come with him. If they moved steadily andwithout interruption through Forest (though he knew it would be slower with thegirl, who had to lean on her stick) they would arrive in time.Matty blinked, took a deep breath, got to his feet, and hurried on to the smallcottage around the next turning, the place where Kira lived.***The gardens were larger than he remembered; since his last visit almost twoyears before, she had expanded them, he saw. Thick clumps of yellow and deeppink flowers fringed the edge of the small dwelling with its hand-hewn beams andthatched roof. Matty had never paid attention to the names of flowers—boysgenerally disdained such things— but now he wished he knew them, so that hecould tell Jean.Frolic went to the base of a wooden post that was entwined with apurple-blossomed vine, and lifted his leg to proclaim his presence and authorityhere.The door to the cottage opened and Kira appeared there. She was wearing a bluedress and her long dark hair was tied back with a matching ribbon.\"Matty!\" she cried in delight.He grinned at her.\"And you've got yourself a new pup! I hoped you would. You were so sad, Iremember, after Branchie died.\"\"His name is Frolic, and I'm afraid he's watering your...\"\"Clematis. It's all right,\" she said, laughing. She reached for Matty andembraced him. Ordinarily uncomfortable with hugs, he would have stiffened hisshoulders and drawn back; but now, from exhaustion and affection, he held Kiraand to his own amazement felt his eyes fill with tears. He blinked them back.\"All right, stand back now and let me see you,\" she said. \"Are you taller yetthan I am?\"He stood back grinning and saw that they were eye to eye.\"Soon you will be. And your voice is almost a man's.\"\"I can read Shakespeare,\" he told her, swaggering.\"Hah! So can I!\" she said, and he knew then for certain how changed this villagewas, for in the earlier days, girls had not been allowed to learn.\"Oh, Matty, I remember when you were such a tiny thing, and so wild!\"\"The Fiercest of the Fierce!\" he reminded her, and she smiled fondly at him.\"You must be very tired. And hungry! You've just made such a long journey. Comeinside. I have soup on the fire. And I want news of my father.\"He followed her into the familiar cottage and waited while she reached for herwalking stick that leaned against a wall and arranged it under her right arm.Dragging the useless leg, she took a thick earthen bowl from a shelf and went tothe fire where a large pot simmered and smelled of herbs and vegetables.Matty looked around. No wonder she had not wanted to leave this place. From thesturdy ceiling beams dangled the countless dried herbs and plants from which shemade her dyes. Shelves on the wall were bright with rolls of yarn and threadarranged by color, white and palest yellow at one end, gradually deepening intoblues and purples and then browns and grays at the other. On a threaded loom inthe corner between two windows, a half-finished weaving pictured an intricatelandscape of mountains, and he could see that she was now working on the sky andhad woven in some feathery clouds of pinktinged white.She set the bowl of steaming soup on the table in front of Matty and then wentto the sink to pump water into a bowl for Frolic.\"Now. Tell me of Father,\" she asked. \"He's well?\"\"He's fine. He sends you his love.\"He watched as Kira leaned her stick against the sink and knelt with difficultyto place the bowl on the floor. Then she called to Frolic, who was industriouslychewing a broom in the corner.When the puppy had come to her and turned his attention to the bowl of water,Kira rose again, sliced a thick piece from a loaf of bread, wedged her stickunder her shoulder again, and brought the bread to the table. Matty watched theway she walked, the way she had always walked. Her right foot twisted inward,pulling the entire leg with it. The leg had not grown as the other had. It wasshorter, turned, and useless.He thanked her and dipped one end of the slice into his soup.\"He's a sweet puppy, Matty.\" He half listened as she chattered cheerfully aboutthe dog. His thoughts had turned to Frolic's birth and how close to death thepup and his mother had been.He glanced down at her twisted leg. How much more easily she would be able towalk—how much more steadily and quickly she would be able to travel—if the legwere straight, if the foot could be planted firmly on the ground.He remembered the afternoon after the puppy and his mother had been saved. Todayhe was tired, very tired, from the long journey through Forest. But on that day,he had felt near death.He tried to recall how long it had taken him to recover. He had slept, he knew.Yes. He remembered that he had slept for the afternoon, glad that the blind manhad not been at home to ask why. But he had arisen before dinner—weary, still,but able to hide it, to eat and talk as if nothing had happened.So his recovery had taken only a few hours, really. Still, it had been a puppy.Well, a puppy and its mother. Two dogs. He had fixed—cured? saved?—two dogs inlate morning, and recovered from it by the end of the day.\"Matty? You're not listening! You're half asleep!\" Kira's laughter was warm andsympathetic.\"I'm sorry.\" He put the last bit of bread into his mouth and lookedapologetically at her.\"You're both tired. Look at Frolic.\"He glanced over and saw the puppy sound asleep, curled into a mound of undyedyarn heaped near the door, as if the soft pile were a mother to doze against.\"I have work to do in the garden, Matty. The coreopsis needs staking and I'venot had a chance to get to it. You lie down and get some rest, now, while I'moutside. Later we can talk. And you can go into the village and find yourfriends, for a visit.\"He nodded and went to the couch to lie down on top of the knitted blanket thatshe had thrown across it. In his mind, he was counting the days they had left.He would explain to her that there was no time to visit with old pals.He watched, his eyes heavy with exhaustion, as she took his bowl to the sink,placed it there, and then, leaning on her stick, gathered some stakes from ashelf, and a ball of twine. With her garden tools she turned to go outdoors. Thetwisted foot dragged in its familiar way. He had known everything about Kira forso long: her smile, her voice, her merry optimism, the amazing strength andskill of her hands, and the burden of her useless leg.I must tell you this, Matty thought before he slept. I can fix you."},{"pageContent":"14To his amazement, Kira said no. Not no to leaving—he hadn't suggested that toher, not yet—but a definite, unarguable no to the idea of a straightened, wholeleg.\"This is who I am, Matty,\" she said. \"It is who I have always been.\"She looked at him fondly. But her voice was firm. It was evening. The fireglowed in the fireplace and she had lit the oil lamps. Matty wished that theblind man were in the room with them, playing his instrument, because the soft,intricate chords always brought a peace to their evenings together and he wantedKira to hear the music, to feel the comfort it brought.He had not yet told her that she was to return with him. During their suppertogether, as Kira chattered about the changes in the old village, how muchbetter things were now, he had only half listened. In his mind he had beenweighing what to tell her and when and how. There was so little time; and heneeded, Matty knew, to present it to her in a decisive and convincing way.But suddenly he heard her make a casual comment about her handicap. She wasdescribing a small tapestry she had embroidered as a wedding gift for her friendThomas, the woodcarver, who had recently been married.\"It was all finished and rolled up, and I decorated it with flowers,\" she said,\"and on the morning of the wedding I set out, carrying it. But it had rained,and the path was wet, and I slipped and dropped the tapestry right into a mudpuddle!\" Kira laughed. \"Luckily it was still early, so I came back here and wasable to clean it. No one ever knew.\"My leg and stick are a nuisance when it's wet outdoors,\" she said. \"My stickhas never learned to navigate mud.\" She reached over to the pot and began topour more tea into their mugs.Surprising himself, he blurted it out. \"I can fix your leg.\"The room fell completely silent except for the hiss and crackle of the fire.Kira stared at Matty.\"I can,\" he said after a moment. \"I have a gift. Your father says that you do,too, so you'll understand.\"\"I do,\" Kira agreed. \"I always have. But my gift doesn't fix twisted things.\"\"I know. Your father told me yours is different.\"Kira looked down at her hands, wrapped around her mug of tea. She opened herfingers, spread her hands upon the table, and turned them over. Matty could seethe slender palms and the strong fingers, calloused at their tips from thegarden work, the loom, and the needles that she used for her complicated,beautiful tapestries. \"Mine is in my hands,\" she said softly. \"It happens when Imake things. My hands...\"He knew he shouldn't interrupt. But time was so short. So he cut her off, andapologized for it. \"Kira, I want you to tell me all about your gift. But later.Right now there are important things to do and decide.\"I'm going to show you something,\" he told her. \"Watch this. My gift is in myhands, too.\"He had not planned this. But it seemed necessary. On the table lay the sharpknife with which she had sliced bread for their supper. Matty picked it up. Heleaned down, and pulled the left leg of his trousers up. Kira watched, her eyesconfused. Quickly, without flinching, he punctured his own knee. Dark red bloodtrickled in a thin crooked line down his lower leg.\"Oh!\" Kira gasped. She stared at him and held her hand to her mouth. \"What...?\"Matty swallowed, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and placed both of hishands on his wounded knee. He felt it coming. He felt his veins begin topulsate; then the vibration coursed through him, and he felt the power leave hishands and enter his wound. It lasted no more than a few seconds and ended.He blinked, and took his hands away. They were smeared slightly with blood. Thetrickled line on his leg had already begun to dry there.\"Matty! Whatever are you...?\" When he gestured, Kira leaned forward and lookedcarefully at his knee. After a moment she reached for the woven napkin on thetable, dipped it into her tea, and wiped his leg with the damp cloth. The lineof blood disappeared. His knee was smooth, unblemished. There was no wound atall. She looked intently at it, then bit her lip, reached out, and pulled thehem of his trouser leg down over his knee.\"I see.\" It was all she said.Matty shook himself free of the wave of fatigue it had caused. \"It was a verysmall wound,\" he explained. \"I just did it to show you I could. It didn't takemuch out of me. But I've done it with bigger things, Kira. With other creatures.With much larger wounds.\"\"Humans?\"\"Not yet. But I can do it. I can feel it, Kira. With a gift, you know.\"She nodded. \"Yes. That's true.\" She glanced at her own hands, resting there onthe table, still holding the damp cloth.\"Kira, your leg will take a great deal out of me. I'll have to sleep, after,maybe for a whole day or even longer. And I don't have much time.\"She looked at him quizzically. \"Time for what?\"\"I'll explain. But for now, I think we should start. If I do it right away, Ican sleep completely through the night and almost all of the morning. You canuse that time to become accustomed to being whole...\"\"I am whole,\" she said defiantly.\"I meant to having two strong legs. You'll be amazed at how it feels, at howmuch more easily you can move around. But it will take a little while to adjustto it.\"She stared at him. She looked down at her twisted leg.\"Why don't you lie down over there on the couch? I'll pull this chair over andsit beside you.\" Matty began kneading his hands in preparation. He took severaldeep breaths and felt energized. He could tell that his full strength was back.The knee wound had been such a small thing, really.He rose, lifted his wooden chair, and moved it over beside the couch where hehad napped that afternoon. He arranged the cushions so that she would becomfortable. Behind him he heard Kira rise from her chair as well, lift herstick from where it leaned against the table, and walk across the room. To hissurprise, when he turned, he saw that she had taken the mugs to the sink and wasbeginning to wash them, as if it were an ordinary evening.\"Kira?\"She looked over at him. She frowned slightly. Then she said no.There was no arguing with her, none at all. After a while Matty gave up theattempt.Finally he moved his chair again so that he could sit in front of the fire. Itwas chilly in the evenings now, with summer ending. Forest had been downrightcold at night, and he had woken in the mornings during his journey aching andchilled. It was comforting to sit here by the warm fire now.Kira picked up a small wooden frame with a half-finished piece of embroiderystretched taut across it. She brought it to her chair, and moved a basket filledwith bright threads to the floor beside her. Then she leaned her stick againstthe fireplace wall, sat down, and picked up the needle that was waiting,threaded with green, attached to the fabric.\"I will go with you,\" she said quite suddenly in her soft voice. \"But I will goas I am. With my leg. With my stick.\"Matty, puzzled, stared at her. How had she known, before he asked it, what hewas planning to ask of her?\"I was going to explain,\" he said after a long moment. \"I was going to persuadeyou. How...?\"\"I started to tell you earlier,\" she said, \"about my gift. What my hands do.Move your chair closer and I'll show you now.\"He did so, pulling the crude wooden chair near to where she was. She tilted theembroidery frame so that he could see. Like the colorful tapestry on the wall ofthe blind man's house, this was a landscape. The stitches were tiny andcomplicated, and each section a subtle variation in color, so that deep greenmoved gradually into a slightly lighter shade, and then again lighter, until atthe edges it was a pale yellow. The colors combined to form an exquisite patternof trees, with the tiniest of individual leaves outlined in countless numbers.\"It's Forest,\" Matty said, recognizing it.Kira nodded. \"Look beyond it,\" she said, and extended her finger to point to asection in the upper right, where Forest opened and tiny houses were patternedaround curved paths.He thought he could almost make out the house he shared with the blind man,though it was infinitely small on the fabric.\"Village,\" he said, examining with awe the meticulousness of her craft.\"I embroider this scene again and again,\" Kira said, \"and sometimes—notalways—my hands begin to move in ways I don't understand. The threads seem totake on a power of their own.\"He leaned closer to look more carefully at the embroidery. It was astounding,the detail of it, how tiny it was.\"Matty?\" she said. \"I've never done this with anyone watching. But I can feel itin my hands right now. Watch.\"He peered intently as her right hand picked up the needle threaded with green.She inserted it into the fabric at an unfinished place near the edge of Forest.Suddenly both of her hands began to vibrate slightly. They shimmered. He hadseen this once before, on the day that Leader stood at the window, gatheredhimself, and saw beyond.He looked up at her face and saw that her eyes were closed. But her hands weremoving very quickly now. They reached into the basket again and again, changedthreads in a motion so fast he could barely follow it, and the needle enteredthe cloth, and entered the cloth, and entered the cloth.Time seemed to stop. The fire continued to crackle and sputter. Frolic sighed inhis sleep at the edge of the hearth. Matty sat speechless, watching theshimmering hands dart; hours and days and weeks seemed to go by, yet oddly, onlya blink, an instant, of time passed. Today and tomorrow and yesterday were allspun together and held in those hands that moved and moved and moved, yet hereyes were closed, and the fire still flickered and the dog still slept.Then it ended.Kira opened her eyes, sat up straighter, and stretched her shoulders. \"It tiresme,\" she explained, though he already knew it.\"Look now,\" she said. \"Quickly, because it will fade.\"He leaned forward and saw that now, in the embroidered scene, at the bottom, twotiny people were entering Forest. He recognized one as himself, backpack on hisback; he could even see, amazingly, the torn place on the sleeve of his jacket.Behind him, meticulously stitched in shades of brown, was Frolic, his tail high.And beside Frolic he saw Kira, her blue dress, her stick wedged under her arm,her dark hair tied back.The top edge of the embroidery had changed as well. Now, beside the house he hadrecognized as his, he could see the blind man standing. His posture was that ofsomeone waiting for something.And suddenly Matty could see, too, crowds of people at the edge of Village. Theywere dragging huge logs. Someone—it looked like Mentor—was giving directions.They were preparing to build a wall.Matty sat back. He blinked, astounded, then leaned forward to look at it again.He realized he wanted to search the scene for a glimpse of Jean. But now thedetails were gone. He could still see the colored stitches, but it was asimple—exquisitely beautiful, but simple—landscape again. For a moment he sawthe people, flat now, with no detail, but then they faded abruptly and weregone.Kira set the embroidery frame down on the floor and rose from her chair. \"Wemust leave in the morning,\" she said. \"I'll prepare food.\"Matty was still stunned by what he had just seen. \"I don't understand,\" he said.\"Do you understand what happened when you stabbed your knee with that knife andthen closed and cured the wound with your hands?\"\"No,\" he admitted. \"I don't. It's my gift. That's all.\"\"Well,\" Kira said matter-of-factly, \"this is mine. My hands create a picture ofthe future. Yesterday morning I held that same fabric and saw you come out ofForest. In the afternoon I opened the door and there you were.\"She chuckled. \"I hadn't seen Frolic, though. He was a nice surprise.\" The dogawoke and looked up at the sound of his name. He came to her to be patted.\"While you napped,\" she went on, \"I stitched again and saw Father waiting forme. That was just this afternoon. Now they have started to move the logs intoplace for the wall. And—did you notice the change in Forest, Matty?\"He shook his head. \"I was looking at the people.\"\"Forest is thickening. So we must hurry, Matty.\"Odd. It was the same thing that Leader had seen. \"Kira?\" Matty asked.\"Yes?\" She was taking food from a cupboard.\"Did you see a young man with blue eyes? About your age? We call him Leader.\"She stood still for a moment, thinking. A strand of dark hair fell across herface, and she brushed it back with her hand. Then she shook her head. \"No,\" shesaid. \"But I felt him.\""},{"pageContent":"15They woke early. The sun was just rising, and through the window Matty could seethat the gardens were bathed in amber light. Thick around a tall trellis, a vinethat had been simply green when he arrived the day before was now profuse withopened blue and white morning glories. Beyond the trellis, on tall stalks, tinyaster blossoms, deep pink with golden centers, trembled in the dawn breeze.He felt her presence, suddenly, and turned to see Kira standing behind him,looking out.\"It will be hard for you to leave this,\" he said.But she smiled and shook her head. \"It's time. I always knew the time wouldcome. I told my father that long ago.\"\"He says you'll have a garden there. He wanted me to tell you that.\"She nodded. \"Eat quickly, Matty, and we'll go. I've fed Frolic already.\"***\"Do you need help?\" Matty asked, his mouth full of the sweet muffin she hadgiven him, as he watched her arrange a wrapped bundle on her back, crisscrossingthe straps that held it around her chest. \"What's in it?\"\"No, I can do it just fine. It's my frame and some needles and thread.\"\"Kira, the journey's hard and long. There won't be time to sit and sew.\" ThenMatty fell quiet. Of course she needed this. It was the way her gift came.She had put food inside Matty's pack as well as in his rolled blanket. It washeavier than it had been coming, for there were two of them now. But Matty feltstrong. He was almost relieved that she had not allowed him to mend her leg, forit would have weakened him badly, cost them perhaps several days as he restedfrom it, and sent them out less prepared and more vulnerable.He could see, too, that she was accustomed to her stick and twisted leg. Alifetime of walking in that way had made it, as she had pointed out, part ofher. It was who she was. To become a fast-striding Kira with two straight legswould have been to become a different person. This was not a journey Matty couldundertake with a stranger.\"Frolic, if you were a little bigger and less frisky, I would strap a pack toyour back,\" Kira said, laughing, to the eager puppy, who stood beside the doorwith his tail churning in the air. He could tell they were leaving. He was notgoing to be left behind.Soon they were loaded with everything they had packed so carefully the nightbefore.\"We're ready, then,\" Kira announced, and Matty nodded in agreement. From theopen doorway, with Frolic already outside sniffing the earth, they looked backto the large room that had been Kira's home since she had been a young girl. Shewas leaving the loom, the baskets of yarn and thread, the dried herbs on therafters, the wall-hangings, the earthen mugs and plates made for her by thevillage potter, and a handsome wooden tray that had been a gift long ago fromher friend Thomas, who had carved it with intertwined, complicated designs. Fromhooks along the wall hung her clothes, things she had made, some of them skirtsand jackets rich with embroidered and appliqued designs. Today she was wearingher simple blue dress and a heavy knitted sweater with buttons made from smallflat stones.She closed the door on all of it. \"Come, Frolic,\" Matty called, unnecessarily.The dog scampered to them and raised his leg one last time against the doorsill,saying, in his way, \"I have been here.\"Then Matty moved toward the place where the path entered Forest. Kira, leaningon her stick, followed him, and Frolic, ears up, came behind.***\"You know,\" Kira said, \"I've walked the forest path between this cottage and thecenter of my village so many times.\" Then she laughed. \"Well, of course you knowthat, Matty. You did it with me when you were a little boy.\"\"I did. Again and again.\"\"But I have never once entered Forest. There was no need, of course. And italways seemed frightening somehow.\"They had barely entered, and behind them the light of the clearing still showed,and a corner of Kira's little house. But ahead, Matty could see, the path wasoddly dark. He didn't remember it being so dark.\"Are you frightened now?\" he asked her.\"Oh, no, not with you. You know Forest so well.\"\"That's true. I do.\" It was true, but even as he said it, Matty felt a sense ofdiscomfort, though he hid it from Kira. The path ahead did not seem to be asfamiliar as it had always been. He could tell that it was the same path—theturnings were the same; as he led her around the next one, the clearing behindthem was no longer visible—but things that had seemed easy and accustomed nolonger did. Now everything felt a little different: slightly darker, anddecidedly hostile.But he said nothing. He led the way, and Kira, strong despite her handicap,trudged after him.***\"They have entered.\"Leader turned from the window. He had stood there for a long moment, intent,focused, while beside him the blind man waited. They had been doing this forseveral days.Leader sat to rest. He breathed hard. He was accustomed to this, the way hisbody temporarily lost its vigor and needed to restore itself after he had lookedbeyond.The blind man gave a sigh that was clearly one of relief. \"So she came withhim.\"Leader nodded, still not ready to talk.\"I worried that she wouldn't. It meant leaving so much behind. But Mattyconvinced her. Good for him.\"Leader stretched, and sipped from the glass of water on his desk. Then he wasable to speak. \"She didn't need convincing. She could tell that it was time. Shehas that gift.\"The blind man went to the window and stood there listening. Heavy draggingsounds and thuds were accompanied by shouts:\"Over here!\"\"Put it down there!\"\"Watch out!\"They could hear Mentor's voice, loud above the others. \"Stack them right there,\"he directed. \"Five to a stack. You! You idiot! Stop that! If you aren't going tohelp, go someplace else!\"Leader winced. \"It was such a short time ago that he was so patient andsoft-spoken. Listen to him now.\"\"Tell me how he looks,\" the blind man said.Leader went to the window and looked down at the place where they were preparingto build the wall. He found Mentor in the crowd. \"His bald spot is completelygone,\" he said. \"He's taller. Or at least stands straighter. He's lost weight.And his chin is firmer than it was.\"\"A strange trade for him to have made,\" the blind man commented.Leader shrugged. \"For a woman,\" he pointed out. \"People do strange things.\"\"I suppose it's too soon for you to look beyond again.\" The blind man was stillat the window. His posture was uneasy.Leader smiled. \"You know it is. They've only just entered. They're fine.\"\"How much time do they have?\"\"Ten days. The wall can't go up for ten days, according to the edict. It'senough time.\"\"Matty's like a son to me. It's as if both my children are out there.\"\"I know.\" Leader put a reassuring arm across the blind man's shoulders. \"Comeback here tomorrow morning and we'll look again.\"\"I'll go work in my garden. I'm preparing flower beds for Kira.\"\"Good idea. It'll take your mind from the worry.\"But when Seer had gone, Leader stood at the window for a while, listening to thewall builders at their preparations. He was very worried himself. He had nottold the blind man. But while he had watched Matty, Kira, and the puppy enterForest, he had been able to see, too, that Forest was shifting, moving,thickening, and preparing to destroy them."},{"pageContent":"16\"I'll catch fish farther along,\" Matty said. \"Frolic won't eat it, but you and Ican. And there are berries and nuts. So we don't have to save this. Eat all youwant.\"Kira nodded and took a bite from the deep red apple he had given her. \"It willbe good to reduce the weight in your pack,\" she pointed out. \"We can move morequickly then.\"They were seated on the blanket in the place Matty had chosen to spend the firstnight. They had covered quite a distance during the day. He was surprised at howwell she was able to keep up the pace.\"No, Frolic, not my stick.\" Kira scolded the little dog affectionately when hetried to use her cane as a plaything to chew. \"Here,\" she said to him, andpicked up a stick from the ground. She threw it to him and he dashed away withit, growling playfully, hoping that someone would chase him. When no one did, helay down and attacked the stick like a warrior, tearing its bark with his smallsharp teeth.Matty tossed some dead twigs onto the fire he had built. It was close to darknow, and chilly. \"We walked a long way today,\" he told Kira. \"I'm amazed at howwell you manage. I thought that because of your leg...\"\"I'm so accustomed to it. I've always walked like this.\" Kira untied her leathersandals and began to rub her feet. \"I'm tired, though. And look. I'm bleeding.\"She leaned forward with the hem of her skirt bunched in her hand, and wipedblood from the sole of her foot. \"I'll throw this dress away when we arrive.\"She laughed. \"Will there be fabric there so that I can make new clothes?\"Matty nodded. \"Yes. There's plenty in the marketplace. And you can borrowclothes, too, from my friend Jean. She's about your size.\"Kira looked at him. \"Jean?\" she said. \"You've not mentioned her before.\"He grinned and was glad it was dark so she wouldn't see his face turningcrimson. It startled him that he had blushed. What was happening? He had knownJean for years. They had played together as children after his arrival inVillage. He had tried, once, to tease and frighten her with a snake, only todiscover that she loved garden snakes.To Kira, now, he just shrugged. \"She's my friend.\"She's pretty,\" he added, then cringed, embarrassed that he had said that, andwaited for Kira to tease him. But she wasn't really listening. She was examiningher feet, and he could see, even in the flickering light of the fire, that thesoles were badly cut and bleeding.She dipped the hem of her dress into the bowl of water they had set out forFrolic, and wiped the wounds. Watching her in the firelight, Matty could see herwince.\"How bad is it?\" he asked.\"It will be all right. I've brought some herbal salve and I'll rub it in.\" Hewatched as she opened a pouch she took from her pocket and began to treat thepunctures and cuts.\"Is there something wrong with your shoes?\" he asked, glancing at the softleather sandals set side by side on the ground. They had firm soles and she hadseemed to walk comfortably in them.\"No. My shoes are fine. It's strange, though. While we were walking, I kepthaving to stop to pull twigs out of my shoes. You probably noticed.\" Shelaughed. \"It was as if the underbrush was actually reaching in to poke at me.\"She rubbed a little more ointment into the wounds on her feet. \"It poked mehard, too. Maybe tomorrow I'll wrap some cloth around my feet before I put mysandals back on.\"\"Good idea.\" Matty didn't let her see how uneasy this made him feel. He fed thefire again and then arranged some rocks around it so that it couldn't escapefrom the little cleared space where he had built it. \"We should sleep now, andget an early start tomorrow.\"Soon, curled on the ground beside her, with Frolic between them and the blanketthrown across all three, Matty listened. He heard Kira's even breathing; she hadfallen asleep immediately. He felt Frolic stir and turn in his light puppyishslumber, probably dreaming of birds and chipmunks to chase. He heard the lastshifting of the sticks in the fire as it died and turned to ash. He heard thewhoosh and flutter of an owl as it dived, and then the tiny squeal of a doomedrodent caught in its talons.From the direction toward which they were traveling, he perceived a hint of thestench that permeated the deep center of Forest. By Matty's calculations, theywould not reach the center for three days. He was surprised that already thefoul smell of decay drifted to where they were resting. When finally he slept,his dreams were layered over with an awareness of rot and the imminence ofterrible danger.***In the morning, after they had eaten, Kira wrapped both of her feet in fabrictorn from her petticoat, and when the wrappings were thick and protective, sheloosened the straps of her sandals and fit her bandaged feet carefully intothem.Then she picked up her stick and walked a bit around the fire to test thearrangement. \"Good,\" she said after a moment. \"It's quite comfortable. I won'thave a problem.\"Matty, rolling the blanket around the remains of their food, glanced over. \"Tellme if it happens again, the sticks and twigs poking at you.\"She nodded. \"Ready, Frolic?\" she called, and the puppy scampered to her from thebushes where he had been pawing at a rodent's hole. Kira adjusted her wrappedbundle of embroidery tools on her back and prepared to follow Matty as he setoff.To his surprise, he had some difficulty finding the path this second morning.That had never happened before. Kira waited patiently behind him as heinvestigated several apparent entrances from the clearing where they had slept.\"I've come through here so often,\" he told her, puzzled. \"I've slept in thissame place so many times before. And I've always kept the path clear and easy tofind. But now...\"He pushed back some bushes with his hand, stared for a moment at the ground hehad revealed, then took his knife from his pocket and pruned back the branches.\"Here,\" he said, pointing. \"Here's the path. But the bushes have somehow grownacross and hidden it. Isn't that strange? I just came through here a day and ahalf ago. I'm sure it wasn't overgrown like this then.\"He held the thick shrubbery back to make it easier for Kira to enter, and waspleased to see that her footsteps, despite her injured feet, seemed firm andwithout pain.\"I can push things with my stick,\" she told him.\"See?\" She raised her stick and used it to force up a thick vine that hadreached from one tree to another on the other side of the path, making a barrierat the height of their shoulders. Together they ducked and went under the vine.But immediately they could see that there were others ahead, barring theirapproach.\"I'll cut them,\" Matty said. \"Wait here.\"Kira stood waiting, Frolic suddenly quiet and wary at her feet, while Mattysliced through the vines at eye level ahead of them.\"Ow,\" he said, and winced. An acidic sap dripped from the cut vines and burnedwhere it landed on his arm. It seemed to eat through the thin cotton fabric ofhis sleeve. \"Be careful not to let it drip on you,\" he called to Kira, andmotioned to her to come forward.They made their way carefully through the passageway, which was a maze of vines,Matty in front with his knife. Again and again the sap spattered onto his armsuntil his sleeves were dotted with holes and the flesh beneath was burned raw.Their progress was very slow, and when finally the path widened, opened, and wasfree of the glistening growth—which they could see had already, amazingly,regrown and reblocked the path they had just walked—they stopped to rest. It hadbegun to rain. The trees were so thick above them that the downpour barelypenetrated, but the foliage dripped and was cold on their shoulders.\"Do you have more of that herbal salve?\" Matty asked.Kira took it from her pocket and handed it to him. He had pushed back hissleeves and was examining his arms. Inflamed welts and oozing blisters had madea pattern on his skin.\"It's from the sap,\" he told her, and rubbed the salve onto the lesions.\"I guess my sweater was thick enough to protect me. Does it hurt?\"\"No, not much.\" But it wasn't true. Matty didn't want to alarm her, but he wasin excruciating pain, as if his arms had been burned by fire. He had to hold hisbreath and bite his tongue to keep from crying out as he applied the salve.For a brief moment, he thought that he might try to use his gift, to call forththe vibrating power and eradicate the stinging poisonous rash on his arms. Buthe knew he must not. It would take too much out of him—it would, in Leader'swords, spend his gift—and it would hamper their progress. They had to keepmoving. Something so terrifying was happening that Matty did not even try toassess it.Kira did not know. She had never made this journey before. She could feel thedifficulties of this second day but did not realize they were unusual. She foundherself able to laugh, not aware of the incredible pain that Matty was feelingin his singed and blistered arms. \"Goodness,\" she said, chuckling, \"I'm glad myclematis doesn't grow that fast or that thick. I'd never be able to open myfront door.\"Matty rolled his sleeves back down over the painful burns and returned the salveto Kira. He forced himself to smile.Frolic was whimpering and trembling. \"Poor thing,\" Kira said, and picked him up.\"Was that path scary? Did some of the sap drip on you?\" She handed him to Matty.He saw no wounds on the puppy, but Frolic was unwilling to walk. Matty tuckedhim inside his jacket, curling the ungainly legs and feet, and the puppy nestledthere against his chest. He felt the little heart beat against his own.\"What's that smell?\" Kira asked, making a face. \"It's like compost.\"\"There's a lot of decaying stuff in the center of Forest,\" he told her.\"Does it get worse?\"\"I'm afraid it will.\"\"How do you get through it? Do you tie a cloth around your nose and mouth?\"He wanted to tell her the truth. I've never smelted it before. I've come throughhere a dozen, maybe two dozen, times, but I have never smelted it before. Thevines have never been there. It has never been like this before.Instead, he said, \"That's the best method, I suppose. And your salve has a niceherbal odor. We'll rub some of it on our upper lips, so it will block that foulsmell.\"\"And we'll hurry through,\" she suggested.\"Yes. We'll go through as quickly as we can.\"The searing sensation in his arms had subsided, and now they simply throbbed andached.But his body felt hot and weak, as if he were ill. Matty wanted to suggest thatthey stop here and rest, that they spread the blanket and lie down for a while.But he had never rested at midday on previous journeys. And now they could notafford the time. They had to move forward, toward the stench. At least the vineswere behind them now, and he didn't see any ahead.The cold rain continued to fall. He remembered, suddenly, how Jean's hair curledand framed her face when it was damp. In contrast to the horrible stench thatwas growing stronger by the minute, he remembered the fragrance of her when shehad kissed him goodbye. It seemed so long ago.\"Come,\" he said, and gestured to Kira to follow.***Leader told the blind man that Matty and Kira had made it through the firstnight and were well into the second day. He murmured it from the chair where hewas resting, lacking the strength to talk in his usual firm voice.\"Good,\" the blind man said cheerfully, unsuspecting. \"And the puppy? How'sFrolic? Could you see him?\"Leader nodded. \"He's fine.\"The truth was that the puppy was in better condition than Matty himself, Leaderknew. So was Kira. Leader could see that Kira had had problems the first day,when Forest had punctured and wounded her. His gift had given him a glimpse ofher bleeding feet. He had watched her rub on the salve and wince, and he hadwinced in sympathy. But she was managing well now. He could see, but did nottell the blind man, that now Forest was attacking Matty instead.And he could see as well that they had not yet approached the worst of it."},{"pageContent":"17By the second afternoon Matty was in agony, and he knew there was still a day togo before the worst of it. His arms, poisoned by the sap, had festered and wereseeping, swollen, and hot. The path was almost entirely overgrown now, and thebushes clawed at him, scraping at the infected burns until he was close tosobbing with the pain.He could no longer delude Kira into thinking this was an ordinary journey. Hetold her the truth.\"What should we do?\" she asked him.\"I don't know,\" he said. \"We could try to go back, I suppose, but you can seethat the path back is blocked already. I don't think we could find the way, andI know I can't go through those vines again. Look at my arms.\"He gingerly pulled back his ruined sleeve, and showed her. Kira gasped. His armsno longer looked like human limbs. They had swollen until the skin itself hadsplit and was oozing a yellowish fluid.\"We're close to the center now,\" he explained, \"and once we get through that,we'll be on the way out. But we still have a long way to go, and it will mostlikely get a lot worse than it is already.\"She followed him, uncomplaining, for there was no other choice, but she was paleand frightened.When they came, finally, to the pond where he ordinarily refilled his watercontainer and sometimes caught some fish, he found it stagnant. Once clear andcool, the water was now dark brown, clogged with dead insects, and it smelled ofkinds of filth he could only guess at.So they were thirsty now.The rain had stopped, but it left them clammy and cold.The smell was much, much worse.Kira smoothed the herbal salve on their upper lips and wrapped cloth aroundtheir noses and mouths to filter the stench. Frolic huddled, head down, insideMatty's shirt.Suddenly the path, the same path he had always followed, ended abruptly at aswamp that had never been there before. Sharp, knifelike reeds grew fromglistening mud. There was no way around. Matty stared at it and tried to make aplan.\"I'm going to cut a thick piece of vine, Kira, to use as rope. Then I'll tie ustogether, so that if one of us should get stuck in some way...\"Bending his grotesquely swollen arm with difficulty, he reached with his knifeand severed a length of heavy vine.\"I'll tie it,\" Kira said. \"I'm good at that. I've knotted so much yarn andthread.\" Deftly she circled his waist, and then her own, with the length ofsupple vine. \"Look,\" she told him, \"it's quite fast.\" She tugged at the knots,and he could see that she had done a masterly job of connecting them to eachother, leaving a length of vine between.\"I'll go first,\" Matty said, \"to test the mud. The thing I'm most concernedabout...\"Kira nodded. \"I know. There are muds called quicksand.\"\"Yes. If I start to sink, you must pull hard to help me get out. I'll do thesame for you.\"Inch by inch they moved through the swamp, looking for thickets of growth onwhich to place their feet, testing the suction when they were forced into thethick mud. The razor-sharp reeds sliced mercilessly into their legs andmosquitoes feasted on the fresh blood. From time to time they pulled each otherfree when they were caught by the suction. Kira's sandals, first one and thenthe other, were sucked from her feet and disappeared.Miraculously, Matty's shoes remained, coated with the slippery mud so that heappeared to be wearing heavy wet boots by the time he dragged himself from theother side of the swamp. He waited there, holding the vine rope steady, easingKira through the mud and up the bank.Then he used the knife and cut through the vine that had held them together inthe swamp. \"Look!\" he said, pointing to his feet, encased in mud that wasalready drying into a crust. For a moment he had an odd desire to laugh at thegrotesque thick boots.Then he saw Kira's bare feet and shuddered. They were raw, dripping with bloodfrom the reopened cuts she had previously suffered, and from new lacerationscaused by the sharp swamp reeds. Matty climbed back down the bank, scooped wetmud with his hands, and gently coated her feet and legs, stopping the bleedingand trying to ease her pain with the thick cool paste.He looked up through the tree growth to the sky, trying to assess the time ofday. It had taken them a long time to cross the swamp. His arms were unusable,but he could still hold the knife in his swollen hands. Kira, her legs and feetin muddied shreds, knelt beside him, trying to catch her breath. The stench madeit difficult for them to breathe, and he could feel the puppy choking from itinside his shirt.He forced himself to speak with optimism.\"Follow me,\" he said. \"I think the center is just ahead. And night is comingsoon. We'll find a place to sleep, and then in the morning we'll start the finalbit. Your father's waiting.\"Slowly he moved forward, and Kira rose onto her ruined feet and followed him.***Matty felt his reason leave him now and again, and he began to imagine that hewas outside of his own body. He liked that, escaping the pain. In his mind hedrifted overhead, looking down on a struggling boy who pushed relentlesslythrough the dark, thorny undergrowth, leading a crippled girl. He felt sorry forthe pair and wanted to invite them to soar and hover comfortably with him. Buthis bodiless self had no voice, and he was unable to call down to where theywere.These were daydreams, escapes, and they didn't last long.\"Can we stop for a minute? I need to rest. I'm sorry.\" Kira's voice was weak,and muffled by the cloth covering her mouth.\"Up here. There's a little opening. We'll have room to sit down.\" Matty pointed,and pushed ahead to the place he had seen. When they reached it, he shook hisrolled blanket from his back and set it on the ground as a cushion. They sankdown beside each other.\"Look.\" Kira pointed to the skirt of her dress, to show him. The blue fabric,discolored now, was in shreds. \"The branches seem to reach for me,\" she said.\"They're like knives. They cut my clothes\"—she examined the ruined dress, withits long ragged tears—\"but they don't quite reach my flesh. It's as if they'rewaiting. Teasing me.\"For a terrible instant Matty remembered how Ramon had described poorStocktender, who had been entangled by Forest and whose body had been foundstrangled by vines. He wondered if Forest had teased Stocktender first, burningand cutting him before the final moments of his hideous death.\"Matty? Say something.\"He shook himself. He had let his mind drift again. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"Idon't know what to say.\"How are your feet?\" he thought to ask her.He saw her shudder, and looked down. The encrusted mud he had applied as balmhad fallen away. Her feet were nothing more than ragged flesh.\"And look at your poor arms,\" she said. His torn sleeves were stained withseepage from his wounds.He remembered the days of Village in the past, when a person who had difficultywalking would be helped cheerfully by someone stronger. When a person with aninjured arm would be tended and assisted till he healed.He heard sounds all around them and thought them to be the sounds of Village:soft laughter, quiet conversation, and the bustle of daily work and happy lives.But that was an illusion born of memory and yearning. The sounds he heard werethe rasping croak of a toad, the stealthy movement of a rodent in the bushes,and foamy bubbles belching from some slithery malevolent creature in the darkwaters of the pond.\"I'm really having trouble breathing,\" Kira said.Matty realized that he was, too. It was the heaviness of the air with itsterrible smell. It was like a foul pillow held tightly to their faces, cuttingoff their air, choking them. He coughed.He thought of his gift. Useless now. Probably he still had the strength andpower to repair his own wounded arms or Kira's tortured feet. But then the nextonslaught would come, and the next, and he would be too weakened to resist it.Even now, looking listlessly down, he saw a pale green tendril emerge from thelower portion of a thorny bush and slide silently toward them. He watched in akind of fascination. It moved like a young viper: purposeful, silent, andlethal.Matty took his knife from his pocket again. When the sinister, curling stem—inappearance not unlike the pea vines that grew in early summer in theirgarden—reached his ankle, it began to curl tightly around his flesh. Quickly hereached down and severed it with the small blade. Within seconds it turned brownand fell away from him, lifeless.But there seemed no victory to it. Only a pause in a battle he was bound tolose.He noticed Kira reaching for her pack and spoke sharply to her. \"What are youdoing? We have to move on a minute. It's dangerous here.\" She hadn't seen thedeadly thing that had grabbed at Matty, but he knew there would be more; hewatched the bushes for them.It had come for him first, he realized. He did not want to be the first to die,to leave her alone.To his dismay, she was removing her embroidery tools. \"Kira! There's no time!\"\"I might be able to...\" Then she deftly threaded a needle.To what? he wondered bitterly. To create a handsome wall-hanging depicting ourlast hours? He remembered that in the art books he had leafed through atLeader's, many paintings depicted death. A severed head on a platter. A battle,and the ground strewn with bodies. Swords and spears and fire; and nails beingpounded into the tender flesh of a man's hands. Painters had preserved such painthrough beauty.Perhaps she would.He watched her hands. They flew over the small frame, moving in and out with theneedle. Her eyes were closed. She was not directing her own fingers. They simplymoved.He waited, his eyes vigilant, watching the surrounding bushes for the nextattack. He feared the coming dark. He wanted to move on, out of this place,before evening came. But he waited while her hands moved.Finally she looked up. \"Someone is coming to help us,\" she said. \"It's the youngman with the blue eyes.\"Leader.\"Leader's coming?\"\"He has entered Forest.\"Matty sighed. \"It's too late, Kira. He'll never find us in time.\"\"He knows just where we are.\"\"He can see beyond,\" he said, and coughed. \"Have I already told you that? Ican't remember.\"\"See beyond?\" She had begun to pack her things away.\"It's his gift. You see ahead. He sees beyond. And I...\" Matty fell silent. Heraised one hideously swollen arm and looked listlessly at the pus that seepedthrough the fabric of his sleeve. Then he laughed harshly. \"I can fix a frog.\""},{"pageContent":"18The blind man was alone now, with his fear, since Leader had gone. He hadreturned to his own house to wait, passing as he did the workers still preparingto build a wall surrounding Village.In the yard beside the small homeplace he had shared happily with Matty for solong, he could smell the newly turned earth. Yesterday he had begun to dig aflower garden for his daughter, pushing in the spade and loosening the weeds forpulling.Jean had stopped by to ask about Matty. She had admired Seer's work and told himshe would bring seeds from her own flowers. They could have twin gardens, shesaid. She was looking forward to meeting the blind man's daughter. She had neverhad a big sister, and perhaps Kira would be that for her. He could hear thesmile in her voice.But that had been yesterday, and he had told Jean then, believing it to be true,that the travelers were fine, and on their way home.This morning Leader, after standing motionless at the window for a long time,had told him the truth.The blind man had cried out in anguish. \"Both of them? Both of my children?\"Ordinarily Leader needed to rest after he looked beyond. But now he did not takethe time. The blind man could hear him moving about the room, gathering things.\"Don't let Village know I'm gone,\" Leader told him.\"Gone? Where are you going?\" The blind man was still reeling with the news ofwhat was happening in Forest.\"To save them, of course. But I don't trust the wall builders. If they realizeI'm not here to remind everyone of the proclamation, I think they'll startearly. I don't want to get back here and not be able to reenter.\"\"Can you slip past them?\"\"Yes, I know a back way. And they're all so absorbed in their work that theywon't be looking for me. I'm the last person they want to see, anyway. They knowhow I feel about the wall.\"The blind man was encouraged out of his despair by the optimism in Leader'svoice. To save them, of course. He had said that. Maybe it could be true.\"Do you have food? A warm jacket? Weapons? Maybe you'll need weapons. I hate thethought of it.\"But Leader said no. \"Our gifts are our weaponry,\" he said. Then he hurried downthe stairs.Now, alone in his homeplace, a feeling of hopelessness returned to the blindman. He reached for the wall beside the kitchen and felt the edges of thetapestry hanging there, the one Kira had made for him. He let his fingers creepacross it, feeling their way through the embroidered landscape. He had felt thetiny, even stitches often before, because he went to it and touched it when hewas missing her. Now, on this shattered morning, he felt nothing but knots andsnarls under his fingertips. He felt death, and smelled its terrible smell."},{"pageContent":"19Night was ending and they were still alive. Matty woke at dawn to find himselfstill curled next to Kira in the place where they had collapsed together afterstruggling as far as they could into the evening.\"Kira?\" His voice was hoarse from thirst, but she heard him and stirred. Sheopened her eyes.\"I can't see very well,\" she whispered. \"Everything is blurred.\"\"Can you sit up?\" he asked.She tried, and groaned. \"I'm so weak,\" she said. \"Wait.\" She took a deep breathand then painfully pushed herself into a sitting position.\"What's that on your face?\" she asked him. He touched his upper lip where shepointed, and brought his hand away smeared with bright blood. \"My nose isbleeding,\" he said, puzzled.She handed him the cloth she had worn around her face the day before, and heheld it against his nose to try to stem the flow of blood. \"Do you think you canwalk?\" he asked her after a moment.But she shook her head. \"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Matty.\"He wasn't surprised. After the thorny branches had shredded her dress, they hadreached for her legs as night fell, and now he could see that she was terriblylacerated. The wounds were deep, and he could see exposed muscles and tendonsglisten yellow and pink in a devastating kind of beauty where the ragged fleshgaped open.Matty himself could probably still stumble along. But his arms were completelyuseless now, and his hands seemed no more than huge paws. He could no longereven hold the knife with any strength.As for Frolic, he didn't know. The little dog lay motionless against his chest.He watched dully as a brown lizard with a darting tongue scrambled across theirblanket with its tail flicking.\"You go on,\" Kira murmured. She lay back down and closed her eyes. \"I'll justsleep.\"He moved his damaged arms with some difficulty to her pack, which lay beside herwhere she had dropped it the night before. Through a haze of pain he realizedthat his fingers still moved awkwardly at his will, and he used them to open herpack and remove the embroidery frame. Painstakingly, slowly, he threaded herneedle. Then he shook her awake.\"Don't. I don't want to wake up.\"\"Kira,\" he said to her, \"take this.\" He handed her the frame. \"Just try one moretime. Please. See where Leader is, if you can.\"She blinked and looked at the frame as if it were unfamiliar. Matty put thethreaded needle into her right hand. He was remembering something. It wassomething he had said once, to Leader, about meeting halfway.But she had closed her eyes again. He spoke loudly to her. \"Kira! Put the needleinto the fabric. And try to meet him. Try, Kira!\"Kira sighed, and with a feeble gesture she inserted the needle into the cloth ashe held the frame for her. He watched her hands. Nothing happened. Nothingchanged. \"Again,\" he implored.He saw her hands flutter, and the shimmer came.***Leader felt Forest's attack begin when he was two days in. Probably it hadstarted earlier, with sharp twigs—he remembered now that one had barely missedhis eye—but he had been so intent, then, on finding and following the path thathe had not paid attention to the little wounds inflicted on him. He had strodethrough the deep woods with no thought of danger; he concentrated only onfinding the pair that he had seen so close to death. He didn't eat or sleep.He had begun to perceive the stench on the morning of the second day, and itserved to hurry his steps. Without flinching, he brushed aside the graspingbranches and ignored the thorns that scraped his arms and face.He encountered a place where the path seemed simply to end. He stopped, puzzled,and examined the undergrowth. From somewhere nearby a shiny green frog emergedfrom the base of a bush.Churrump.Churrump.It hopped and skittered toward him in the mud, then turned itself around andwent forward. To his surprise, Leader followed the frog, pushing his way throughthick bushes, and found that it had led him to the place where the path resumed.Relieved, for he had thought briefly that he was lost, he continued on. But nowhe recognized the attacks. Now he saw that it was not random thorny branches andhis own clumsiness in walking into them, but rather an assault from Forestitself.Suddenly the air surrounding him was abuzz with stinging insects. They flew athis face and bit mercilessly. He remembered, from his reading, descriptions ofbesieged medieval castles, and armies of men with bows sending so many arrowsthat the sky seemed thick with them. This felt like that. He felt pierced in athousand places, and he cried out.Then, just as suddenly, they were gone: regrouping, he thought, for anotherattack. He rushed forward, thinking to move away from this swampy area whichharbored and bred such creatures. Indeed, the path did turn and led to drierground, but here a sharp rock flung itself up and split the skin on his knee;then another sliced his hand so badly that he had to wrap the cut tightly incloth for fear the loss of blood would weaken him beyond repair.Stumbling and bleeding, he wished briefly that he had brought some kind ofweapon. But what would have protected him against Forest itself? It was a forcetoo huge to fight with a knife or a club.Our gifts are our weaponry, he remembered saying to the blind man. It seemed solong ago that he had said it. He had felt certain of it at the time, but now hecould not even think what he had meant.He stood silently for a moment. His face was disfigured now, swollen from bitesthat oozed a dark fluid. Blood ran from his left ear, which had been gashed by arazor-sharp stone. One of his ankles was entangled by a vine that grew soquickly he could see it move, snaking its way toward his knee; he knew he wouldsoon be immobilized by it, and the insects would return, then, to finish himoff.He faced what he knew to be the center of Forest, the place where Matty and Kirawere trapped, and he willed himself to look beyond. It seemed the only thingleft to do."},{"pageContent":"20\"What are you seeing?\" Matty asked her in a hoarse voice.But she didn't reply at first. Her eyes were closed. Her fingers moved as if ina dream. The needle went in and out, in and out.He lifted his head to try to see. But his eyes were swollen, and when he raisedhimself, blood still flowed from his nose. So he lay back down, groaning fromthe effort, and in doing so felt the limp body of the puppy shift inside hisshirt.Matty had never experienced such an enormous sadness. His other dog had died inold age, peaceful and ready. But Frolic was only a puppy, new to life, and hadbeen such a spirited creature, so curious and playful. It seemed impossible thathe would have become a lifeless thing in such a short time.But it was true of everything, he thought. His sadness was for all of it: forVillage, no longer the happy place it had been; for Kira, no longer the sturdy,eager young woman he had always known. And Leader? He wondered what washappening to Leader now.Suddenly Kira seemed to come awake. She whispered, \"He's coming. He's close.\"Her voice was right beside him, very near to Matty's ear as he lay curled nextto her. But it sounded, at the same time, far away, as if she were movingsomeplace distant.***The vine around his ankle tugged at him, bit into his flesh, anchored itselfthere, and sent a new shoot upward. Another snaked itself out of the bushes andcurled around his foot. Leader didn't notice. He stood immobile, alert. His eyeswere open but he was no longer seeing the vermin-ridden trees around him, theirblighted leaves, or the foul dark mud under his feet. He was looking beyond, andhe was seeing something beautiful.\"Kira,\" he said, though it was his mind that spoke, for his human voice wasinaudible now and his mouth was painfully swollen with open sores.\"We need you,\" she replied, and it was her mind speaking, too. Matty, besideher, heard nothing but the soft flutter of her fingers moving on the fabric.***In the place called Beyond, Leader's consciousness met Kira's, and they curledaround each other like wisps of smoke, in greeting.\"We are wounded,\" she told him, \"and lost.\"\"I am hurt, too, and captured here,\" he replied.With the exchange, they drifted dangerously apart. Where he stood, Leader couldfeel the vine now. His knee buckled as the sharp-toothed stem bit. He tried toreach for it but his hands were entangled, too.With great effort, his consciousness touched hers again. \"Ask the boy for help,\"he told her.\"Do you mean Matty?\"\"Yes, though it is not his true name. Tell him we need his gift now. Our worlddoes.\"Matty felt Kira stir beside him. She opened her eyes. He watched as her tonguemoved to moisten her blistered lips. When she spoke, her voice was so weak thathe could not make out the words.With difficulty he leaned painfully toward her, so that his ear was near hermouth.\"We need your gift,\" she whispered.Matty fell back in despair. He had followed Leader's instructions. He had notspent the gift. He had not made Ramon well, had not fixed Kira's crooked leg, oreven tried to save his little dog. But it was too late now. His body was sodamaged he could barely move. He could no longer bend his ravaged arms. Howcould he place his hands on anything? And what, in any case, did she want him totouch? So much was ruined.In agony and hopelessness, he turned away from her and rolled off the blanketand into the thick foul-smelling mud. With his arms outstretched, his handstouching the earth, he lay there waiting to die.He felt his fingers begin to vibrate."},{"pageContent":"21It began with the tiniest sensation. It was different from the larger feelingsthat still racked his body: the searing agony in his arms and hands, the almostunendurable ulceration of his parched mouth, the feverish pounding of his head.This was a whispered hint of power. He felt it in the tips of his fingers, inthe whorls and crevices of his outer skin. It moved across his hands as they laymotionless in the mud.Though he shivered from illness and anguish, he could sense his blood beginningto warm and flow. He lay still. Inside him the thick dark liquid slid sinuouslythrough his veins. It entered his heart and throbbed there, moving with purposethrough the labyrinth of muscle, collecting energy that came faintly to it fromhis collapsing lungs. He could feel it surge into his arteries. Within the blooditself he could perceive its separate cells, and see their colors in hisconsciousness, and the prisms of their molecules, and all of it was awake now,gathering power.He could feel his own nerves, each one, millions of them, taut with energywaiting to be released. The fibers of his muscles tightened.Gasping, Matty called for his gift to come. There was no sense of how to directit. He simply clawed at the earth, feeling the power in his hands enter,pulsating, into the ruined world. He became aware, suddenly, that he had beenchosen for this.Near him, Kira began to breathe more easily. What had been close to coma turnednow to sleep.Not far away, Leader tentatively lifted one foot and found it free of theentangling vine. He opened his eyes.Back in Village, a breeze came up. It came through the windows of the homeplacewhere Ramon lived with his family. Ramon sat up suddenly in the bed, where hehad lain ill for days, and felt the fever begin to seep from him.The blind man sensed the breeze entering the open windows and lifting an edge ofthe tapestry on the wall. He felt the fabric, and found the stitches as even andsmooth as they had been in the past.Matty groaned and pressed his hands harder into the ground. All of his strengthand blood and breath were entering the earth now. His brain and spirit becamepart of the earth. He rose. He floated above, weightless, watching his humanself labor and writhe. He gave himself to it willingly, traded himself for allthat he loved and valued, and felt free.***Leader walked forward. He wiped his face with his hands and felt the lesionsfade, as if they had been cleansed away. He could see the path clearly now, forthe bushes had drawn back, their leaves bright with new green growth and dappledwith buds. A yellow butterfly lit on a bush, paused, and darted off. Roundedstones bordered the path, and sunlight filtered down through the canopy oftrees. The air was fresh, and he could hear a stream flowing nearby.***Matty could see and hear everything. He saw Jean, beside her garden, call out inhappy greeting to her father; and he saw Mentor, stooped once more, and balding,wave to her from the path where he was walking toward the schoolhouse with abook in his hand. His face was stained again with the birthmark, and poetry hadreturned to him. Matty heard him recite:> Today, the road all runners come,> Shoulder-high we bring you home,> And set you at your threshold down,> Townsman of a stiller town.He saw the wall builders walk away from their work.He heard the new ones singing in their own languages—a hundred differenttongues, but they understood one another. He saw the scarred woman standingproudly in their midst beside her son, and the people of Village gathered tolisten.He saw Forest and understood what Seer had meant. It was an illusion. It was atangled knot of fears and deceits and dark struggles for power that haddisguised itself and almost destroyed everything. Now it was unfolding, like aflower coming into bloom, radiant with possibility.Drifting there, he looked down and saw his own self becoming motionless. He felthis breathing slow. He sighed, let go, and felt a sense of peace.He watched Kira wake, and he saw Leader find her there.***Kira took a cloth to the stream and brought it back, moistened, to wash Matty'sstill face. Leader had turned him over. She sobbed at the sight of him but wasglad that his terrible wounds were gone. She bathed his arms and hands. The skinwas firm and unblemished, without scars.\"I knew him when he was a little boy,\" she said, weeping. \"He always had a dirtyface and a mischievous spirit.\"She smoothed his hair. \"He called himself the Fiercest of the Fierce.\"Leader smiled. \"He was that. But it was not his true name.\"Kira wiped her eyes. \"He so hoped to receive his true name at the end of thisjourney.\"\"He would have.\"\"He wanted to be Messenger,\" Kira confided.Leader shook his head. \"No. There have been other messengers, and there will bemore to come.\" He leaned down and placed his hand solemnly on Matty's foreheadabove the closed eyes. \"Your true name is Healer,\" he said.A sudden rustling in the bushes startled them both. \"What's that?\" Kira asked inalarm. At her voice, the puppy, his fur matted with twigs, emerged from theplace where he had been hiding.\"It's Frolic!\" Kira took him into her arms and he licked her hand.Beside her, tenderly, Leader picked up what remained of the boy and prepared tocarry him home. In the distance, the sound of keening began."}]
