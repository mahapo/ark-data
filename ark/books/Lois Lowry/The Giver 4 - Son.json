It felt grotesque and unnecessary, butshe didn’t object. It was the procedure. She knew that. One of the other Vesselshad described it to her at lunch a month before.“Mask?” she had asked in surprise, almost chuckling at the strange image.“What’s the mask for?”“Well, it’s not really a mask,” the young woman seated on her left correctedherself, and took another bite of the crisp salad. “It’s a blindfold, actually.”She was whispering. They were not supposed to discuss this among themselves.“Blindfold?” she had asked in astonishment, then laughed apologetically. “Idon’t seem to be able to converse, do I? I keep repeating what you say. But:blindfold? Why?”“They don’t want you to see the Product when it comes out of you. When you birthit.” The girl pointed to her bulging belly.“You’ve produced already, right?” she asked her.The girl nodded. “Twice.”“What’s it like?” Even asking it, she knew it was a somewhat foolish question.They had had classes, seen diagrams, been given instructions. Still, none ofthat was the same as hearing it from someone who had already gone through theprocess. And now that they were already disobeying the restriction aboutdiscussing it—well, why not ask?“Easier the second time. Didn’t hurt as much.”When she didn’t respond, the girl looked at her quizzically. “Hasn’t anyone toldyou it hurts?”“They said ‘discomfort.’”The other girl gave a sarcastic snort. “Discomfort, then. If that’s what theywant to call it. Not as much discomfort the second time. And it doesn’t take aslong.”“Vessels? VESSELS!” The voice of the matron, through the speaker, was stern.“Monitor your conversations, please! You know the rules!”The girl and her companion obediently fell silent then, realizing they had beenheard through the microphones embedded in the walls of the dining room. Some ofthe other girls giggled. They were probably also guilty. There was so littleelse to talk about. The process—their job, their mission—was the thing they hadin common. But the conversation shifted after the stern warning.She had taken another spoonful of soup. Food in the Birthmothers’ Dormitory wasalways plentiful and delicious. The Vessels were all being meticulouslynourished. Of course, growing up in the community, she had always beenadequately fed. Food had been delivered to her family’s dwelling each day.But when she had been selected Birthmother at twelve, the course of her life hadchanged. It had been gradual. The academic courses—math, science, law—at schoolbecame less demanding for her group. Fewer tests, less reading required. Theteachers paid little attention to her.Courses in nutrition and health had been added to her curriculum, and more timewas spent on exercise in the outdoor air. Special vitamins had been added to herdiet. Her body had been examined, tested, and prepared for her time here. Afterthat year had passed, and part of another, she was deemed ready. She wasinstructed to leave her family dwelling and move to the Birthmothers’ Dormitory.Relocating from one place to another within the community was not difficult. Sheowned nothing. Her clothing was distributed and laundered by the centralclothing supply. Her schoolbooks were requisitioned by the school and would beused for another student the following year. The bicycle she had ridden toschool throughout her earlier years was taken to be refurbished and given to adifferent, younger child.There was a celebratory dinner her last evening in the dwelling. Her brother,older by six years, had already gone on to his own training in the Department ofLaw and Justice. They saw him only at public meetings; he had become a stranger.So the last dinner was just the three of them, she and the parental unit who hadraised her. They reminisced a bit; they recalled some funny incidents from herearly childhood (a time she had thrown her shoes into the bushes and come homefrom the Childcare Center barefoot). There was laughter, and she thanked themfor the years of her upbringing.“Were you embarrassed when I was selected for Birthmother?” she asked them. Shehad, herself, secretly hoped for something more prestigious. At her brother’sselection, when she had been just six, they had all been very proud. Law andJustice was reserved for those of especially keen intelligence. But she had notbeen a top student.“No,” her father said. “We trust the committee’s judgment. They knew what youwould do best.”“And Birthmother is very important,” Mother added. “Without Birthmothers, noneof us would be here!”Then they wished her well in the future. Their lives were changing too; parentsno longer, they would move now into the place where Childless Adults lived.The next day, she walked alone to the dormitory attached to the Birthing Unitand moved into the small bedroom she was assigned. From its window she could seethe school she had attended, and the recreation field beyond. In the distance,there was a glimpse of the river that bordered the community.Finally, several weeks later, after she was settled in and beginning to makefriends among the other girls, she was called in for insemination.Not knowing what to expect, she had been nervous. But when the procedure wascomplete, she felt relieved; it had been quick and painless.“It that all?” she had asked in surprise, rising from the table when thetechnician gestured that she should.“That’s all. Come back next week to be tested and certified.”She had laughed nervously. She wished they had explained everything more clearlyin the instruction folder they had given her when she was selected. “What does‘certified’ mean?” she asked.The worker, putting away the insemination equipment, seemed a little rushed.There were probably others waiting. “Once they’re sure it implanted,” heexplained impatiently, “then you’re a certified Vessel.“Anything else?” he asked her as he turned to leave. “No? You’re free to go,then.” That all seemed such a short time ago. Now here she was, nine months later, withthe blindfold strapped around her eyes. The discomfort had started some hoursbefore, intermittently; now it was nonstop. She breathed deeply as they hadinstructed. It was difficult, blinded like this; her skin was hot inside themask. She tried to relax. To breathe in and out. To ignore the discom—No, shethought. It is pain. It really is pain. Gathering her strength for the job, shegroaned slightly, arched her back, and gave herself up to the darkness.Her name was Claire. She was fourteen years old."},{"pageContent":"TWOThey clustered around her. She could hear them, when her mind was able to focusthrough the surging intermittent pain. They were talking urgently to each other.Something was wrong.Again and again they checked her with their instruments, metallic and cold. Acuff on her arm was inflated, and someone pressed a metal disk there, at herelbow. Then a different device against her stretched and shaking belly. Shegasped as another convulsive pain ripped through her. Her hands were tied oneither side of the bed. She was unable to move.Was it supposed to be like this? She tried to ask but her voice was tooweak—mumbly and scared—and no one heard.“Help me,” she whimpered. But their attention, she sensed, was not on her, notreally. They were worried about the Product. Their hands and tools were on hertaut middle. It had been hours, now, since all this began, the first twinge,then the rhythmic, hardening pain, and later, the buckling on of the mask.“Put her out. We’ll have to go in for it.” It was a commanding voice, clearlysomeone in charge. “Quickly.” There was a startling urgency to it.“Breathe deeply,” they ordered her, shoving something rubbery up under the mask,holding it to her mouth and nose. She did. She had no choice. She would havesuffocated otherwise. She inhaled something with an unpleasantly sweet scent,and immediately the pain subsided, her thoughts subsided, her being driftedaway. Her last sensation was the awareness, pain-free, of something cutting intoher belly. Carving her.***She emerged to a new, different pain, no longer the throbbing agony but now abroad, deep ache. She felt freed, and realized that her wrists were unshackled.She was still on the bed, covered with a warm blanket. Metal rails had beenlifted with a clanking sound, so she was protected on either side. The room wasempty now. No attendants or technicians, no equipment. Only Claire, alone. Sheturned tentatively, assessing the emptiness of the room with her eyes, and thentried to lift her head but was forced back by the pain the attempt caused. Shecouldn’t look down at her own body but carefully moved her hands to rest thereon what had been her own taut, swollen belly. It was flat now, bandaged, andvery sore. The Product was what they had carved out of her.And she missed it. She was suffused with a desperate feeling of loss. “You’ve been decertified.”Three weeks had passed. She had recuperated in the Birthing Unit for the firstweek, tended and checked—pampered a bit, actually, she realized. But there wasan awkwardness to everything. There with her were other young women, recovering,so there was pleasant conversation, a few jokes about being slender again. Theirbodies, hers as well, were massaged each morning, and their gentle exercise wassupervised by the staff. Her recuperation was slower, though, than the others’,for she had been left with a wound and they had not.After the first week they were moved to an interim place, where they amusedthemselves with talk and games before returning two weeks later to the large,familiar group of Vessels. Back they went, to the Dormitory, greeting oldfriends—many of them larger in size now, their bellies growing as theywaited—and taking their places again in the group. They all looked alike, intheir shapeless, smocklike dresses, with their identical haircuts; butpersonalities distinguished them. Nadia was funny, making a joke of everything;Miriam very solemn and shy; Suzanne was organized and efficient.As Vessels returned following Production, there was surprisingly little talk ofthe Task. “How did it go?” someone would ask, and the reply would be anonchalant shrug, and “All right. Fairly easy.” Or a wry “Not too bad,” with aface indicating that it had not been pleasant.“Good to have you back.”“Thanks. How were things here while I was gone?”“The same. Two new Vessels, just arrived. And Nancy’s gone.”“What did she get?”“Farm.”“Good. She wanted that.”It was casual talk, inconsequential. Nancy had delivered her third Product notlong before. After the third, the Vessels were reassigned. Farm. ClothingFactory. Food Delivery.Claire remembered that Nancy had hoped for Farm. She liked the outdoors, and aparticular friend of hers had been assigned Farm some months before; she hopedto spend the next part of her working life in the company of someone sheenjoyed. Claire felt happy for her.But she was apprehensive about her own future. Although her memory was hazy, sheknew that something had gone wrong at her own Production. It was clear that noone else had ended up with a wound. She had tried, somewhat shyly, to ask theothers, those who had produced more than once. But they seemed shocked andconfused by her questions.“Is your belly still sore?” Claire whispered to Miriam, who had been in therecuperation place with her.“Sore? No,” Miriam had replied. They were sitting beside each other atbreakfast.“Mine is, just where the scar is. When I press on it,” Claire explained,touching her hand gently to the place.“Scar?” Miriam made a face. “I don’t have a scar.” She turned away and joinedanother conversation.Claire tried again, carefully asking a few other Vessels. But no one had a scar.No one had a wound. After a while, her own ache subsided, and she tried toignore the uneasy awareness that something had gone very wrong.Then she was called in. “Claire,” the voice from the speaker announced at middaywhile the Vessels were eating, “please report to the office immediately afterlunch.”Flustered, Claire looked around. Across the table was Elissa, a special friend.They had been selected the same year, both Twelves at the same time, and so shehad known Elissa through her school years. But Elissa was newer here; she hadnot been inseminated as soon as Claire. Now she was in the early stages of herfirst Production.“What’s that about?” Elissa asked her when they heard the directive.“I don’t know.”“Did you do something wrong?”Claire frowned. “I don’t think so. Maybe I forgot to fold my laundry.”“They wouldn’t call you in for that, would they?”“I don’t think so. It’s so minor.”“Well,” Elissa said, beginning to stack her empty dishes, “you’ll find out soonenough. It’s probably nothing. See you later!” She left Claire still sitting atthe table.But it was not nothing. Claire stood facing them in dismay as the committee toldher of their decision. She had been decertified.“Gather your things,” they told her. “You’ll be moved this afternoon.”“Why?” she asked. “Was it because . . . well, I could tell that something wentwrong, but I . . .”They were kind, solicitous. “It wasn’t your fault.”“What wasn’t my fault?” she asked, aware that she shouldn’t press them butunable to stop herself. “If you could just explain . . . ?”The committee head shrugged. “These things happen. A physical problem. It shouldhave been detected sooner. You should not have been inseminated. Who was yourfirst Examiner?” he asked.“I don’t remember her name.”“Well, we’ll find out. Let’s hope it was her first error, so that she will haveanother chance.”They dismissed her then, but she turned at the door because she could not leavewithout asking.“My Product?”He looked at her dismissively, then relented. He turned to another committeemember near him at the table and nodded to the papers in front of her, directingher to look up the information.“What number was it?” the woman asked him, but he ignored the question. “Well,”she said, “I’ll check by name. You’re—Claire?”As if they didn’t know. They had summoned her here by name. But she nodded.She moved her finger down a page. “Yes. Here you are. Claire: Product numberThirty-six. Oh yes, I see the notations about the difficulties.”She looked up. Claire touched her own belly, remembering.The woman returned the paper to the pile and tapped the edges of the stack tomake it tidy. “He’s fine,” she said.The committee head glared at her.“It.” She corrected herself. “I meant that it’s fine. The medical difficultiesdidn’t affect it.“You’ll be fine too, Claire,” she added, affably.“Where am I going?” Claire asked. Suddenly she was frightened. They hadn’t yetsaid she was being reassigned. Just decertified. So she would no longer be aBirthmother. That made sense. Her body had not performed that function well. Butwhat if—? What if decertified people were simply released? The way failuresoften were?But their reply was reassuring. “Fish Hatchery,” the committee head told her.“You’re being moved there. They need help; they’re short of workers. Yourtraining will start in the morning. You’ll have to catch up. Luckily you have aquick mind.”He dismissed her now with a wave of his hand, and Claire went back to theDormitory to gather her few things. It was rest time. The other Vessels were allnapping, the doors to their cubicle-like rooms closed.He, she thought as she packed the few personal items that she had. It was a he.I produced a baby boy. I had a son. The feeling of loss overwhelmed her again."},{"pageContent":"THREEYou’ll be issued a bicycle.” The man—his name-tag said DIMITRI, HATCHERYSUPERVISOR—gestured toward the area where bicycles were standing in racks. Hehad met her at the door, unsurprised by her arrival. Obviously he had beennotified that she was on her way.Claire nodded. Confined to the Birthing Unit and its surrounding grounds forover a year now, she had not needed any kind of transportation. And she hadwalked here, carrying her small case of belongings, from the Birthmothers’ areato the northeast. It wasn’t far, and she knew the route, but after so manymonths, everything seemed new and unfamiliar. She had passed the school and sawchildren at their required exercise in the recreation field. None seemed torecognize her, though they looked curiously at the young woman walking along thepath at midday. It was unusual. Most people were at their jobs. Those who neededto be out and about were on bicycles making their way from one building toanother. No one walked. A small girl with hair ribbons grinned at Claire fromthe exercise routine, and waved surreptitiously; Claire smiled back, rememberingher own beribboned days, but an instructor called sharply to the child, who madea face and turned back to the assigned calisthenics.Across the Central Plaza, she caught a glimpse, in the Dwelling area, of thesmall house where she had grown up. Other people would live there now, couplesnewly assigned to each other, perhaps waiting for . . .She averted her eyes from the Nurturing Center. It was, she knew, where theProducts were taken after the birthing. Usually in groups. Early morning, mostoften. Once, sleepless at dawn, she had watched from the window of her cubicleand seen four Products, tucked into baskets, loaded into a two-wheeled cartattached to the back of a bicycle. After checking their security in the cart,the birthing attendant had ridden off toward the Nurturing Center to deliverthem there.She wondered if her own Product, her boy, number Thirty-six, had been taken tothe Nurturing Center yet. Claire knew that they waited—sometimes days,occasionally weeks, making certain that everything was going well, that theProducts were healthy—to make the transfer.Well. She sighed. Time to put it out of her mind. She walked on, past the hallof Law and Justice. Peter, whom she had once known as a teasing older brother,would be inside, at work. If he glanced through a window and saw a young womanwalking slowly past, would he know it was Claire? Would he care?Past the House of Elders, the place where the governing committee lived andstudied. Past small office buildings; past the bicycle repair shop; and now shecould see the river that bordered the community, its dark water moving swiftly,foaming around rocks here and there. Claire had always feared the river. Aschildren they had been warned of its dangers. She had known of a young boy whohad drowned. There were rumors, likely untrue, of citizens who had swum across,or even made their way across the high, forbidden bridge and disappeared intothe unknown lands beyond. But she was fascinated by it too—its constant murmurand movement, and the mystery of it.She crossed the bike path, waiting politely until two young women had pedaledby. To her left she could see the shallow fish-holding ponds and remembered how,as younger children, she and her friends had watched the silvery creaturesdarting about.Now she would be working here, at the Hatchery. And living here too, sheassumed, at least until . . . until when? Citizens were given dwellings whenthey were assigned spouses. Birthmothers never had spouses, so she had notthought about it until now. Now she wondered. Was she eligible now for a spouse,and eventually for—? Claire sighed. It was troubling, and confusing, to thinkabout such things. She turned away from the holding ponds, made her way to thefront door of the main building, and was met there by Dimitri. That night, alone in the small bedroom she’d been assigned, Claire looked downfrom her window to the darkened, surging river below. She yawned. It had been along and exhausting day. This morning she had awakened in her familiarsurroundings, the place where she had lived for so many months, but by middayher entire life had shifted. She had not had a chance to say goodbye to herfriends, the other Vessels. They would be wondering where she had gone, butwould likely forget her soon. She had taken her place here, been issued anametag, and been introduced to the other workers. They seemed pleasant enough.Some, older than Claire, had spouses and dwellings, and left at the end of theday’s work. Others, like herself, lived here, in rooms along the corridor. One,Heather, had been the same year as Claire; she had been a Twelve at the sameceremony. Surely she would remember Claire’s Assignment as Birthmother. Her eyesflickered in recognition when they were introduced, but Heather said nothing.Neither did Claire. There was nothing really to say.She supposed that she and the younger workers, including Heather, would becomefriends, of a sort. They would sit together at meals and go in groups to attendcommunity entertainments. After a while they would have shared jokes, probablythings about fish, phrases that would make them chuckle. It had been that waywith the other Vessels, and Claire found herself missing, already, the easycamaraderie among them. But she would fit in here. Everyone welcomed hercheerfully and said they’d be glad of her help.The work wouldn’t be hard. She had been allowed to watch the lab attendants, ingowns and gloves, strip eggs from what they called the breeder fish,anesthetized females. A little like squeezing toothpaste, she thought, amused atthe image. Nearby, other attendants squeezed what they told her was “milt” fromthe male; then they added the creamy substance to the container that held thefresh eggs. It had to be very precisely timed, they explained. And antiseptic.They worried about contamination, and bacteria. The temperature made adifference as well. Everything was carefully controlled.In a nearby room lit by dim red lights, she had watched another gloved workerlook through trays of stacked fertilized eggs.“See those spots?” the worker had asked Claire. She pointed to the tray ofglistening pink eggs. Claire peered down and saw that most of them had two darkspots. She nodded.“Eyes,” the girl told her.“Oh,” Claire said, amazed that already, so young and tiny that she could hardlythink of it as a fish, it had eyes.“See here?” Using a metal tool, the girl pointed to a discolored, eyeless egg.“This one’s dead.” Carefully she plucked it from the tray with her forceps anddiscarded it in the sink. Then she returned the tray to its rack and reached forthe next one.“Why did it die?” Claire asked. She found that she was whispering. The room wasso dimly lit, so quiet and cool, that her voice was hushed.But the worker replied in a normal tone, very matter-of-fact. “I don’t know. Theinsemination went wrong, I guess.” She shrugged and removed another dead eggfrom the second tray. “We have to take them out so they don’t contaminate thegood ones. I check them every day.”Claire felt a vague discomfort. The insemination had gone wrong. Was that whathad happened to her? Had her Product, like the discolored, eyeless egg, beenthrown aside someplace? But no. They had told her that number Thirty-six was“fine.” She tried to set aside her troubling thoughts and pay attention to theworker’s voice and explanations.“Claire?” The door opened and it was Dimitri, the supervisor, looking for her.“I want to show you the dining room. And they have your schedule almost ready togive you.”So she had continued her tour of the facility, and been instructed in her nextday’s duties (cleaning, mostly—everything had to be kept spotless), and latershe had had supper with a group of the workers who lived, as she would now, atthe Hatchery. They talked, mostly, about what they had done during recreationtime. There was an hour allotted each day when they could do whatever theyliked. Someone mentioned a bike ride and a picnic lunch along the river;apparently the kitchen staff would pack your lunch in a basket if you asked inadvance. Two young men had joined a ball game. Someone had watched repairs beingdone on the bridge. It was aimless, pleasant chat, but it served to remindClaire that she was freer now than she had been in a long time. She could go fora walk after lunch, she thought, or in the evening.Later, in her room, thinking, she realized what she wanted to do when she hadtime. Not just an ordinary walk. She wanted to try to find a girl named Sophia,a girl her own age, a girl who had turned twelve when Claire did. They had notbeen particular friends, just acquaintances and schoolmates who had happened toshare a birth year. But Sophia had been seated next to Claire at the ceremonywhen they were given their Assignments.“Birthmother,” the Chief Elder had announced when it was Claire’s turn to standand be acknowledged. She had shaken the Chief Elder’s hand, smiled politely atthe audience, taken her official Assignment papers, and gone back to her seat.Sophia had stood, next.“Nurturer,” the Chief Elder had named Sophia.It had meant little to Claire, then. But now it meant that Sophia, an assistantat first, probably by now fully trained, was working in the Nurturing Center,the place where Claire’s Product—her child, her baby—was being held, and fed. Days passed. Claire waited for the right time. Usually the workers took theirbreaks in pairs or groups. People would wonder if she wandered off alone duringa break; there would be murmurs about her, and questions. She didn’t want that.She needed them to see her as hard-working and responsible, as someone ordinary,someone without secrets.So she waited, worked, and began to fit in. She made friends. One lunchtime shejoined several coworkers in a picnic along the riverbank. They leaned theirbikes against nearby trees and sat on some flat rocks in the high grass whilethey unpacked the prepared food. Nearby, on the path, two young boys rode by ontheir bikes, laughing at something, and waved to them.“Hey, look!” One boy was pointing. “Supply boat!”Eagerly the two youngsters dropped their bikes and scrambled down the slopingriverbank to watch as the bargelike boat passed, its open deck heavy with woodencontainers of various sizes.Rolf, one of the picnickers, looked at his watch and then at the boys. “They’regoing to be late getting back to school,” he commented with a wry smile.The others all chuckled. Now that they were finished with school, it was easy tobe amused by the regulations that they had all lived by as children. “I was lateonce,” Claire told them, “because a groundskeeper sliced his hand when he waspruning the bushes over by the central offices. I stopped and watched while theybandaged him and took him off to the infirmary for stitches.“I used to hope I’d be assigned Nursing Attendant,” she added.There was an awkward silence for a moment. Claire wasn’t certain if they knewher background. Undoubtedly there had been some explanation given for her suddenappearance at the Hatchery, but probably they had been told no details. To havefailed at one’s Assignment—to be reassigned—had something of a shame to it. Noone would ever mention it, if they did know. No one would ask.“Well, the committee knows best,” Edith commented primly as she passedsandwiches around. “Anyway, there’s an element of nursing at the Hatchery. Allthe labs and procedures.”Claire nodded.“Hatchery wouldn’t have been my first choice,” a tall young man named Eric said.“I was really hoping for Law and Justice.”“My brother’s there,” Claire told him.“Does he like it?” Eric asked with interest.Claire shrugged. “I guess so. I never see him. He was older. Once he finishedhis training, he moved away from our dwelling. He might even have a spouse bynow.”“You’d know that,” Rolf pointed out. “You see the Spouse Assignments at theCeremony.“I’ve applied for a spouse,” he added, grinning. “I had to fill out about athousand forms.”Claire didn’t tell them that she had not attended the last two ceremonies.Birthmothers did not leave their quarters during their years of production.Claire had never seen a Vessel until she became one. She had not known, untilshe had both experienced and observed it, that human females swelled and grewand reproduced. No one had told her what “birth” meant.“Look!” Eric said suddenly. “The supply boat’s stopping at the Hatchery. Good! Iput in an order quite a while ago.” He glanced down at the riverbank, where thetwo youngsters were still watching the boat. “Boys!” he called. When they lookedup, he pointed to the watch on his own wrist. “The school bell is going to ringin less than five minutes!”Reluctantly they climbed back up the bank and went to retrieve their bikes.“Thank you for the reminder,” one said politely to Eric.“You think the supply boat will still be there after school?” the other boyasked eagerly.But Eric shook his head. “They unload quickly,” he told the boy, who lookeddisappointed.“I wish I could be a boat worker,” they could hear one boy say to the other asthey set their bikes upright. “I bet they go lots of places we don’t even knowabout. I bet if I were working on a supply boat, I’d get to see—”“If we don’t get back on time,” his friend said nervously, “we’re not going tobe assigned anything! Come on, let’s get going!”The boys rode away toward the school building in the distance.“I wonder what he thought he’d get to see, as a boat worker,” Rolf commented.They began to tidy up the picnic and to pack away the uneaten food.“Other places. Other communities. The boats must make a lot of stops.” Ericfolded the napkins and placed them in the basket.“They’d all be the same. What’s so exciting about seeing a different hatchery, adifferent school, a different nurturing center, a different—”Edith interrupted them. “It’s pointless to speculate,” she said in her terse,businesslike tone. “Accomplishes nothing. ‘Wondering’ is very likely against therules, though I suppose it isn’t a serious infringement.”Eric rolled his eyes and handed Rolf the basket. “Here,” he said. “Strap this onyour bike and take it back, would you? I have to do an errand. I told the labchief that I’d pick up some stuff at the Supply Center.”Rolf, attaching the basket to his bike by its transportation straps, commented,“It might be nice to travel on the river, though, just for the trip. Fun to seenew things. Even,” he added facetiously, “if you haven’t wondered about them.”Edith ignored that.“Could be dangerous,” Eric pointed out. “That water’s deep.” He looked around,making sure they had collected everything. “Ready to go back?” Claire and Edithnodded and moved their bikes to the path. Eric waved and rode off on his errand.Even if it might be against the rules, some kind of infringement (it would behard to know without studying the thick book of community regulations, though itwas always available on the monitor in the Hatchery lobby, but there were pagesand pages of very small print, and no one ever bothered to look at it, as far asClaire could tell), there would be no way for anyone to get caught in the act ofwondering, Claire thought. It was an invisible thing, like a secret. She herselfspent a great deal of time at it . . . wondering.Pedaling back, she rehearsed in her mind, silently, how easy it would be to sayin a casual voice, “I have to run an errand.” How she could slip away—itwouldn’t take long—and ride over to the Nurturing Center, to find Sophia and asksome questions."},{"pageContent":"FOURThen the occasion came.“I just realized that the biology teacher never returned the posters I let himuse,” Dimitri said irritably at lunch. “And I’ll need them tomorrow morning.”“I’ll go get them,” Claire offered.“Thanks.” The lab director nodded in her direction. “That’s a help. There willbe a group of volunteers starting indoctrination, and the visual aids makethings easier.”They were eating in the Hatchery cafeteria, six of them at the same table. Therewas no assigned seating, and today Claire, balancing her tray of prepared food,had made her way to an empty chair at this table where the director was alreadysitting with several technicians. He was talking about a set of demonstrationposters that he liked to use when there were visitors being given a tour of thefacility. The biology teacher had borrowed them and they had not yet beenreturned.“Notify the school. They’ll have a student bring them.” One of the technicianshad finished eating and was tidying his tray. “And they’ll chastise theteacher,” he added, with a malicious chuckle, as he stood.“No need,” Claire said. “I have another errand over that way. It’ll be easy forme to stop by the school.” That wasn’t really a lie, she told herself. Lying wasagainst the rules. They all knew that, abided by it. And she hadn’t made it up,the other errand she had mentioned. She only hoped no one would ask her what itwas. But their attention was elsewhere now. They were crumpling their napkins,looking at their watches, preparing to return to work.It was her chance to look for Sophia. Her stop at the school was brief, and the biology teacher didn’t recognize her.Claire had never studied biology. At twelve, when the selections were made andthe future jobs assigned, the children’s education took different paths. Some inher group—she remembered a boy named Marcus, who excelled in school and wasassigned a future as an engineer—would continue on and learn various sciences.He had probably completed biology by now, she guessed, and would be studyinghigher mathematics, or astrophysics, or biochemistry, one of the subjects thatwas whispered about, when they were young, as incomprehensibly difficult. Marcuswouldn’t be in this ordinary school anymore, but in one of the higher educationbuildings reserved for scholars.Though she had been young at the time, Claire remembered when Peter, herbrother, had moved on to higher education. Maybe Peter had even learned biologyin school. But then he had been transferred over to the law buildings, for hisclerkship and studies.The hallways were familiar, and she found the biology classroom withoutdifficulty.“I had intended to return these,” the biology teacher told her, handing Clairethe rolled-up posters. “Would you please tell him that I didn’t realize he wouldneed them back so soon?” He sounded slightly annoyed.“Yes, I’ll tell him. Thank you.” Claire left the teacher there at his desk inthe classroom and made her way down the hall toward the front door. She glancedinto the empty rooms. School hours had ended and the children had gone to theirvarious volunteer jobs in the community. But she was familiar with some of therooms, and she recognized a language teacher who leaned over a desk, packingthings into a briefcase. Claire nodded uncertainly when the woman looked up andsaw her.“Claire, is it?” The teacher smiled. “What a surprise! What—”But she didn’t continue the question, though the look on her face was curious.Certainly the teacher would have remembered her selection as Birthmother, andclearly a Birthmother had no business in the school, or in fact anywhere in theday-to-day geography of the community. But it would have been extremely rude toask why Claire was there. So the teacher cut off her own question and simplysmiled in greeting.“I’m just here collecting something,” Claire explained, holding up the cylinderof posters. “It’s nice to see you again.”She continued down the hall and out through the front entrance of the educationbuilding, and took her bicycle from the rack by the steps. Carefully sheattached the bundle of papers securely to the holder on the back of the bike.Nearby, a gardener transplanting a bush glanced at her without interest. Twochildren on bicycles pedaled past quickly, rushing toward something, probablyworried about being late for their required volunteer hours.Everything was familiar, unchanged, but it still felt odd to Claire to be backin the community again. She had not ventured far from the Hatchery before this,just the short excursions with her coworkers. Over there, she thought, lookingdown the path she had ridden to get to the school, I can almost see the dwellingwhere I grew up.Briefly she wondered about her parents, whether they ever thought of her—or, forthat matter, of Peter. They had raised two children successfully, fulfilling thejob of Adults with Spouses. Peter had achieved a highly prestigious Assignment.And she, Claire, had not. Birthmother. At the ceremony, standing on the stage toreceive her Assignment, she had not been able to see her parents’ faces in thecrowd. But she could imagine how they looked, how disappointed they would havebeen. They had hoped for more from their female child.“There’s honor in it,” she remembered her mother saying reassuringly that night.“Birthmothers provide our future population.”But it felt a little like those times when they had opened the dinner deliverycontainers to find that the evening meal would be grains prepared with fish oil.“High vitamin D,” her mother would say in that same cheerful voice, in anattempt to make the meal seem more appealing than it really was.Claire biked away from the education buildings and hesitated at the corner,where several paths intersected. She could turn right and ride past the back ofLaw and Justice, straight along that path, and be back at the Hatchery in a fewminutes. But instead, she continued straight, then turned left, so that theHouse of the Old, surrounded by trees, was just ahead of her. She turned righthere and slowed her bicycle near the Childcare Center, steering carefully arounda food delivery vehicle being unloaded. Then she made her way straight aheadtoward the Nurturing Center.It was surprising, she thought, as she approached the structure, that she hadnever spent volunteer hours there as a schoolgirl. She had worked often at theChildcare Center, and had enjoyed the time playing educational games with thetoddlers and young children, but infants—they were called newchildren—had neverinterested her. Some of her friends and age-mates had thought the little ones“cute.” But not Claire. From what she had heard described, they were endlesswork—feeding, rocking, bathing—and they cried too much. She had avoided doingher hours there.Now, planning how she would present herself at the entrance to the NurturingCenter, Claire realized that she was excited, and a little nervous. Sherehearsed what she might say when she went inside. To ask for Sophia would befoolish. Sophia would probably barely remember her; they had not been particularfriends. But why else would she be appearing there, asking to enter?Well, Claire decided abruptly, she would lie once again. Against the rules. Sheknew that. Once, she would have cared. Now she didn’t. As simple as that. And itwas just a small lie.She wheeled her bicycle into the rack where several slots had been left open forvisitors. Then she disengaged the rolled posters from the carrier and took themwith her to the front door. Inside, a young woman sitting at a desk looked upfrom her papers and smiled at her. “Good afternoon,” she said politely, peeringat Claire’s nametag. “Can I help you?”Claire introduced herself. “I’m a worker at the Hatchery,” she explained. “Wehave these extra posters explaining the life cycle of salmon. I was wondering ifyou could use some to decorate your walls.”If the young woman said yes, she realized, she would have some explaining to doto the Hatchery director, who was at this very moment expecting his postersback. But it was a pretty safe assumption that the answer would be no. Who wouldcare about examining the growth of fish? It wasn’t even that interesting tothose who worked with them.And, indeed, the young woman smiled and shook her head. “Thank you,” she said,“but we have specially designed equipment to engage the attention ofnewchildren. We don’t deviate from the standard means of helping them to focustheir attention span and to exercise their small muscles. Everything’s prettycarefully calibrated by the experts in infant development.”Claire nodded. “Interesting,” she said. “I’m sorry I never volunteered here. Idon’t know much about nurturing at all. Do you ever let visitors have a tour?”The receptionist appeared pleased at her interest. “Never been here at all? Mygoodness! It’s such a fun place! You should certainly take a look, since you’rehere anyway! Let me see who’s on duty.” She ran her finger down a list of names.“Is Sophia here?” Claire asked. “She was with my age group.”“Oh, Sophia! She’s such a diligent worker. Let me look. Yes—there’s her name.Let’s see if she’s available.”Summoned through the intercom by the receptionist, Sophia entered the fronthallway from a corridor on the side. She hadn’t changed much since they had bothbeen twelve almost three years before. She was thin, with her hair pulled backunder a cap, which seemed to be part of her uniform. Claire smiled at her. “Hi,”she said. “I don’t know if you remember me. I was a Twelve when you were. Myname’s Claire.”Sophia looked at Claire’s nametag and nodded with a small smile of recognition,after a moment. “We don’t wear nametags,” Sophia explained, “because thenewchildren would grab at them. But I remember you. I think we were in the samemath class.”“I hated math. I was never very good at it.” Claire made a face.Sophia chuckled. “I did pretty well, but it never interested me much. RememberMarcus? He got such high marks in math! He’s in engineering studies now.”Claire nodded. “He was always studying,” she recalled.Sophia frowned and peered toward the small print under Claire’s name on hernametag. “I forget what your Assignment was,” she said. “Your uniform is . . .”“Fish Hatchery,” Claire explained quickly. Good. Sophia didn’t remember that shehad been assigned Birthmother.“And so what are you doing here?”“Hoping to get a tour!” Claire told her. “Somehow I missed out on the wholeNurturing section. And I have a little free time this afternoon.”“Oh. Well, all right. You can follow along and I’ll explain things. But I haveto work. It’s almost feeding time. Come on. Clean your hands first.” Sophiapointed to a disinfectant dispenser on the wall of the corridor, and Clairefollowed her example, rubbing her hands carefully with the clear medicinalliquid.“The youngest ones are in this first room.” Youngest ones. That meant the mostrecent newchildren. Claire thought back, and remembered which of her sisterVessels had been preparing to give birth when she was dismissed. These would betheir Products.“We can’t go in this one without changing to sterile uniforms. But we can lookat them.” Sophia pointed through a window to a spotlessly clean area filled withsmall wheeled carts, many empty. Two workers, a young man in a nurturer’suniform and a volunteer, a girl of ten or so, were tidying things. They lookedup at the window, saw the two observers, and smiled.“How many newest?” Sophia called through the glass. The volunteer held up fourfingers. Then she moved to one of the carts and pushed it closer to the windowso Sophia and Claire could see. A card on the side had a gender symbolindicating Female, and the number 45.“Forty-five?” Claire asked, looking down at the infant, who was wrapped tightlyin a light blanket with only its small face exposed. The eyes were tightlyclosed. “What’s that mean?”Sophia looked at her in surprise. “Number forty-five. Forty-fifth newchild thisyear. Just five more to come. Don’t you remember? We all had numbers. I wasTwenty-seven.”“Oh. Yes, of course. I was one of the earliest ones our year. I was numberEleven.”And she did remember, now that Sophia had reminded her. After age twelve, thenumbers didn’t matter much, were rarely referred to. But being number Eleven hadserved her well when she was young. It had meant she was the eleventh newchildher year—older, therefore, than so many others (like Sophia) who had been laterto walk and talk, later to shoot up in height. By twelve, of course, most ofthat evened out. But Claire could remember being a Five, and a Six, and proudthat she was a little ahead of so many others.“What about the other ones in this year’s batch?” Claire asked.Sophia gestured. “The oldest—numbers One to Ten? They’re in that room overthere. A couple of them can walk already.” She rolled her eyes. “It’s really anuisance to chase after them.” She started down the hall and turned a corner,Claire following. “Then the next oldest are here.” Another large window allowedthe two young women to look into a room where a group of infants crawled on thecarpeted floor strewn with toys, while their attendants prepared bottles at acounter and sink against the wall.“So they’re arranged in groups of ten?”Sophia nodded. “Five rooms, and ten in each, when we have our full fifty. Rightnow we still have a few newborns due to come in. Then, when we reach fifty, nomore till after the next Ceremony.” She waved cheerfully at the volunteerputting the bottles into the warming device, and the young girl grinned andwaved back.“Then, of course, after this year’s fifty are assigned, we start fresh, afterthe Ceremony, with new ones coming in gradually. It’s like a little vacation!”“It’s a while, still, till the Ceremony. But you almost have the full fifty?”“It’s timed, over at the Birthing Unit, so we don’t get a batch of newborns latein the year. Parents being given newchildren don’t want brand-new ones.”“Too much work?”“Not really. You saw, a minute ago—those newest ones? They mostly sleep. Butit’s a lot of responsibility, keeping everything sterile. Also, you can’t playwith the new ones. Parents like to play with their children when they get them.”Claire was half listening. Thirty-six, she thought. Her Product had been numberThirty-six. She had kept the number firmly in her mind.“So next is the third ten?” she asked. “Let me think. One to Ten. Then thisgroup is Eleven to Twenty. The next group will be Twenty-one to Thirty, right?”“Yes. Over there, across the hall. I usually work with that group. I’m going tohave to go back in, in a minute, to help feed.” Claire glanced through thewindow that displayed Sophia’s group of infants, who were dangling in swingssuspended from the ceiling, kicking their bare feet against the carpet. A maleattendant was changing one on a padded table. He noticed the girls and pointedmeaningfully to the large clock on the wall. Sophia opened the door a crack, andClaire could hear the gurgles and giggles as the infants “talked” to oneanother. She smiled. She had not thought of newchildren as being appealing, notat all. But there was a sweetness to these little ones, she had to admit. Shecould understand why new parents wanted ones they could play with.“I’ll be right in,” Sophia was telling her coworker. “I’m giving a tour.“Or”—she turned to Claire—“we could stop here. There’s only one more group, thenext to youngest. They’re not that interesting. Want to come in and play withthese? You could feed one if you want.”Claire hesitated. She didn’t want to seem oddly interested in a particulargroup. “You know,” she told Sophia, “I’d really like to peek at the last group,just so I can say I’ve seen them all. If you don’t mind?”Sophia sighed. “I’ll be back in a minute,” she told the uniformed man, who hadplaced the newly changed infant back in a swing and was now taking small bowlsof cereal from the warmer.“Over here,” Sophia told Claire, and led her to the last room in the corridor.“So these would be, let me think, Thirty-one to Forty?”“Correct.” Sophia was clearly eager to get back to her own charges. “Next tonewest.”“May I go in?” Claire was looking through the observation window. Each smallcrib held an infant, and two attendants were propping warmed bottles on paddedholders beside their heads so that they could suck.“I guess.” Sophia opened the door and asked. “We have a visitor. Could you use ahand for this feed?”A uniformed man smiled. “How about two hands? We can use all the help we canget!”“I have to get back to work with my own group. But I’ll leave her here withyou.”“Thanks, Sophia. It’s been good to see you again.” Claire smiled. “Maybe wecould get together for lunch or something?”“Yes. Come back anytime. Best is when they’re napping, though.” Sophia gave abrief goodbye gesture and returned to her own assigned room.Claire entered timidly and stood watching as the final bottles were distributed.“There,” the attendant said. “Everyone’s been served. Now we have to check fromtime to time and make sure they’re all properly placed. Of course they’ll yellif they lose hold of the nipple! Won’t you?” He glanced down with a smile at oneof the infants who was industriously sucking at the milk. “And then one by onewe pick the little guys up and pat their backs till they burp. Ever done that?”Claire shook her head. Till they burp? She couldn’t even imagine it. “No.”He chuckled. “Well, you can watch. Then, if you want to give it a try—”He lifted one of the infants from its crib. Claire moved forward and saw thenumber. Forty. She glanced around to see if the numbers were in order. But thelittle beds were on wheels, and seemed to have been placed randomly. As shewatched, the attendant took Forty to a rocking chair in the corner and sat downwith the little one against his shoulder.The other attendant, a young woman, leaned forward over a crib with a sniff, andsaid suddenly, “Uh-oh! Thirty-four needs changing!” She wrinkled her nose andpushed the crib over to the changing area. “You’ll have to finish your bottleafter I clean you up, little girl!” she said with a chuckle, and lifted theinfant to the table.Claire noticed, then, that each small crib here was also tagged with a gendersymbol. She made her way past the little beds, glancing in at the infants, somesucking serenely on their milk, others gulping lustily. Suddenly one in a cribmarked male let out a shriek, then switched to a loud wail.“I don’t need to ask who that is!” the man said, continuing to pat and strokethe back of the infant he held. “I recognize his voice!”Claire looked at the number on the crib that contained the howling newchild.“It’s Thirty-six,” she told him.“Of course it’s Thirty-six!” the man replied, laughing. “It’s always Thirty-six!Pick him up, would you? See if you can get him to stop screeching.”Claire took a deep breath. She had never held an infant before. The man,watching her, sensed that. “He won’t break. They’re quite tough, actually. Justbe sure to support his head.”She leaned down. Her hands seemed to know what to do. They slid easily underhim, and found the way to hold his neck and head. Gently Claire picked up herson."},{"pageContent":"FIVENothing changed. Claire’s life didn’t change. She woke each day, showered,donned her uniform, and attached her nametag: CLAIRE. HATCHERY ASSISTANT. Shewent to the cafeteria, greeted her coworkers, ate the morning meal, and beganher assigned tasks. The superiors at the Hatchery were pleased with her work.But at the same time, everything was different. Her every thought now was on thenewchild she had met only once, had held for a moment, whose light eyes she hadgazed into briefly, whose curly hair had touched her chin for too short a time.Number Thirty-six.“Have they chosen the name yet?” she had asked the young woman attendant, whowas re-propping the bottle for the female one she had changed and returned toher crib.“For this one? I don’t think so. They don’t tell us, anyway. We never know theirnames until they’re assigned.”Each newchild was given to his assigned parents at the Ceremony that would takeplace in December. Their names, chosen by a committee, were announced then.“I meant this one,” Claire explained. She had taken an empty rocking chair, andmoved back and forth now with Thirty-six, whose loud crying had subsided. He waslooking up at Claire.“Oh, that one. He might not even get a name at the next Ceremony. They’realready talking about keeping him here another year. He’s not doing well. Theycall it failure to thrive.” The young woman shrugged.“Actually, he does have a name lined up.” The man returned the infant he’d beenburping to the crib, re-propped her bottle, came to where Claire was, and lookeddown at Thirty-six. “Hey there, little guy,” he said, in a singsong voice.“He does? How do you know?” The young woman looked surprised.The man took Thirty-six from Claire, who relinquished him reluctantly. “I’vebeen concerned about him,” he explained. He looked down and made a funny face,as if encouraging the unhappy infant to laugh. “I thought it might make him moreresponsive if I started using his name. So I sneaked into the office and took alook at the list.”“And?” his assistant asked.“And what?”“His name is—?”The man laughed. “Not telling. I only use it in secret. If it’s overheard? Bigtrouble. So I’m being careful.” He jiggled the infant in his lap. “It’s a goodname, though. Suits him.”The woman sighed. “Well, it had better perk him up before December,” she said,“if he wants to get a family. And right now,” she added, looking at the wallclock, “it’s going to be naptime soon, and we haven’t even finished the feeds.”They had forgotten Claire was there. She rose from the rocker. It was true; thetime had passed quickly. “I have to get back,” she told them. “I wonder: Wouldit be all right if I visit again?”They were both silent for a moment. She realized why. It was an odd request.Children volunteered at many different places; it was required. But after theAssignments, after childhood, people worked at their assigned jobs. They didn’tvisit around, or try out other things. She tried to come up, quickly, with anexplanation that seemed logical.“I have a lot of free time,” Claire said. “It’s a slow time of year at theHatchery. So I wandered over today to visit Sophia. You know Sophia; she worksdown the hall, with the next older newchildren?”They nodded. “Twenty-one to Thirty,” the man said. “That’s Sophia’s group.”“Yes. Anyway, she showed me around a bit. And I can see that you can use anextra pair of hands from time to time. So I’m just offering to help out. Ifyou’d like me to, of course.” Claire was aware that she was talking very fast.She was nervous. But the pair didn’t seem to notice.“You know,” the man said, “if you wanted to do it on a regular basis, make itofficial, I think you’d have to fill out some forms.”The young woman agreed. “Get permission,” she added.Claire’s heart sank. She could never do that, never fill out official forms.They would identify her immediately as the Birthmother who had been reassigned.Thirty-six wiggled and wailed. The man carried him to his crib and propped hisbottle, but the wailing continued. The man patted the thrashing legs in a vainattempt to soothe him. He looked over at Claire with a wry smile.“But come on over when you have free time,” he said. “Just on a casual basis.”“Maybe I will,” Claire said, keeping her voice light, as his had been, “if Ihave a few moments sometime.”She turned and fled. Thirty-six continued to cry. She could still hear him asshe left the building. Now she thought of nothing else, of no one else."},{"pageContent":"SIXIt felt very strange, to have this feeling—whatever this feeling was. Claire hadnever experienced it before, the yearning she had to be with the newchild,remembering his face—how the solemn light eyes had stared at her, the way hishair curved around at the top of his head and lifted into a curl there, thewrinkling of his forehead, and his quivering chin before he began to cry.Each family unit was allotted two children, one of each gender, and she had beenthe younger. They had waited several years after receiving Peter before they hadapplied for their girl. So Claire had never known an infant or a small childwell.She asked her coworkers, trying to make it a casual question, at the eveningmeal. “Do any of you remember getting your sibling?”“Sure,” Rolf said. “I was eight when we got my sister.”“I was older,” Edith said. “My parents waited quite a long time before theyapplied for my brother. I think I was eleven.”“I was the second child in my family,” Eric said. “Anyone want that last pieceof bread?”They all shook their heads, and Eric took the last slice from the serving plate.“My sister was only three when they got me. I think my mother actually likedlittle children.” He made a face, as if the idea mystified him.“That’s what I was wondering about, actually,” Claire explained. “Is it, well,usual for people to become really fond of newchildren?”“Depends what you mean by ‘fond,’” Dimitri said. The head of the entire Hatcheryoperation, Dimitri was an upper-level worker; he was older, and had studiedscience intensively. “But you know, of course, that infants of any species—”He stopped and looked at the rest of them, at their blank expressions. “Didn’tyou study this in evolutionary biology?” he asked.Finally, at the silence, he chuckled. “All right, so you don’t know. I’llexplain. Infants are born with big wide-spaced eyes, generally, and large heads,because that makes them look appealing to the adults of the species. So itensures that they will be fed and cared for. Because they look—”“Cute?” Edith interrupted.“Right. Cute. If they were born ugly, no one would want to pick them up, orsmile at them, or talk to them. They wouldn’t get fed. They wouldn’t learn tosmile or talk. They might not survive, if they didn’t appeal to the adults.”“What do you mean by ‘any species’?” Eric asked.“Well, we don’t have mammals anymore, because a healthy diet didn’t includemammal, and they detracted from the efficiency of the community. But in otherareas there are wild creatures of all sorts. And even here, people once hadthings they called pets. Usually small things: dogs, or cats. It was the same inthose species. The newborns were—well, cute. Big eyes, usually. Animals don’tsmile, though. That’s a skill unique to humans.”Claire was fascinated. “What did people do with ‘pets’?”Dimitri shrugged. “Played with them, I think. And also, pets provided companyfor lonely people. We don’t have those now, of course.”“Nobody’s lonely here,” Edith agreed.Claire was quiet. She didn’t say this, but she was thinking: I am. I am lonely.Even as she thought it, though, she realized she didn’t really know what theterm meant.The first buzzer sounded, meaning time to finish up. They began to stack theirtrays. “Rolf? Edith?” Claire asked. “When you got your siblings—and they wereinfants, with big eyes, and big heads, and so they were cute . . .”Both of her coworkers shrugged.“I guess,” Edith said.“Did you think about them all the time, and want to hold them and not ever leavethem?”They looked at Claire as if she had said something preposterous, orunintelligible. She hastened to rephrase her question. “Or maybe I meant yourmothers. Did your mothers cuddle your siblings and rock them, and, well—”“My mother worked, just like every other mother. She took very competent care ofmy sister, of course, and she took her to the Childcare Center every day,” Rolfsaid. “She wasn’t a cuddler, though. Not my mother.”“Same with my mother and my brother,” Edith said. “My father and I helped her totake care of him, but both of my parents had very demanding jobs. And I hadschool, of course, and then my training. We were all happy to drop him off everyday at the Center.“We took great pride in him, of course. He was a very intelligent infant,” sheadded primly. “He’s studying computer science now.”The final buzzer sounded, and they all rose to go back to work.I must put Thirty-six out of my mind, Claire told herself. But she found it impossible. Each day, at her microscope, examining theembryonic salmon for flaws in their structure, Claire looked at the large darkspots that were their primitive, unformed eyes. She imagined that they weregazing at her. It was clearly impossible. Those murky, glistening orbs were notcapable of vision, not yet; and there was no intelligence within the quiveringblob, nothing that craved affection or even attention. But she found herselfreminded, again and again, of the pale, long-lashed eyes that had looked up ather briefly, and of the small fingers that had encircled her thumb.She began to dream of Thirty-six. In one dream, she wore the leather mask again,but they handed her something to hold. It moved tentatively in her arms, and sheclasped it tightly, knowing it was he, not wanting them to take him away,weeping behind the mask when they did.In another, recurrent dream, Thirty-six was here with her, in her small room atthe Hatchery, but no one knew. She kept him hidden in a drawer, and opened itfrom time to time. He would look up and smile at her. Secrecy was forbidden inthe community, and the dream of the hidden newchild caused her to wake with afeeling of guilt and dread. But a stronger feeling was the one that stayed withher after that dream: the excitement of opening the drawer and seeing that hewas still there, that he was safe and smiling.As children, within the family unit, they had been required to tell their dreamseach morning. For single, working members of the community, like those at theHatchery, the requirement was set aside. Occasionally, at the morning meal, oneof the workers would recount an amusing dream. But there was none of thediscussion that had been part of the family ritual. And Claire kept her newdreams private.But she felt restless now, and different, in ways that she didn’t understand. Inkeeping with the demands of her new job and its meticulousness, its constantanalyzing, she tried to examine her own feelings. She had never done so before,had never needed to. For Claire’s entire life, her feelings had been thoseof—what? She searched in her mind for the right descriptive word. Contentment.Yes, she had always been content. Everyone was, in the community. Their needswere tended to; there was nothing they lacked, nothing they . . . That was it,Claire realized. She had never yearned for anything before. But now, ever sincethe day of the birth, she felt a yearning constantly, desperately, to fill theemptiness inside her.She wanted her child.Time passed. It became mid-November. She was busy with her work. But finally shefound a time to return to the Nurturing Center."},{"pageContent":"SEVENHello again!” The man’s greeting was cheerful and welcoming. “I thought you’dforgotten us!”Claire smiled, pleased that he recognized her. “No. But it’s a busy time atwork. It’s been hard to get away.”“Well,” he agreed, “it’s almost December. Lots going on.”“Especially here, I imagine.” Claire gestured to indicate that she meant theentire Nurturing Center, not only this one room, where the lights were dimmed—itwas just past the midday mealtime, and the newchildren were all napping. She andthe man spoke in lowered voices. In the corner, his female assistant was quietlyfolding clean laundry that had just been delivered.“Yes. We’re getting them all ready. Apparently the assignments have all beenmade. I haven’t seen the list yet.”A sudden thought struck Claire. “Do you have a spouse? Could you apply for achild, and then—I suppose this would be against the rules, but—could you choosethe one that would be assigned to you?”He laughed. “Too late for that. Yes, I have a spouse—she works over at Law andJustice. But we already have our complete family: boy first, then girl. And itwas quite a while ago that we got them. I was just an assistant then. No clout.”“So you didn’t even hint at which ones—?”He shook his head. “Didn’t matter. They match them pretty carefully. We’ve beenvery satisfied with ours.”A sound from one of the cribs caught his attention, and he turned. It grewlouder: the fussy whimper of an infant. Claire could see a small arm flail.“You want me to get him?” the assistant asked, looking over.“No, I will. It’s Thirty-six again. Of course!” His voice was resigned andaffectionate.“Could I?” Claire asked, surprising herself.“Be my guest.” The man made a joking gesture toward the crib. “He likes beingtalked to, and sometimes patting his back helps.”“Or not,” the woman in the corner interjected wryly, and the man laughed.Claire lifted the restless newchild from his crib. “Walk him in the hall,” theman suggested, “so he doesn’t wake up the others.”Holding him carefully, she carried the wriggly, whimpering bundle out of theroom and walked back and forth in the long hallway, jiggling him against hershoulder so that he calmed slightly. He held his head up and looked around withwide eyes. She found herself talking to him, nonsense words and phrases, in asingsong voice. She nuzzled his neck and smelled his milky, powdered scent. Herelaxed in her arms, finally, and dozed.I could walk out of here, Claire thought. I could leave right now. I could takehim.Even as she had the thought, she could see the impossibility of it. She had noidea how to feed or care for an infant. No place to hide him, despite hertempting dream of the secret drawer in her room.The man appeared in the doorway, smiled when he saw that the infant was asleep,and beckoned. “Good job,” he whispered when she approached.They stood in the hallway together by a window that looked out across scattereddwellings and the agricultural fields beyond. Two boys rode past on bicycles,and the man waved, but the boys were talking eagerly together and didn’t notice.The man shrugged and chuckled. “My son,” he explained. She watched and could seethe boys turn left where the path intersected another just past the ChildcareCenter. They were probably going to the recreation field.“You’ve got just the right touch,” the man said, and Claire looked at himquestioningly. He nodded toward the sleeping infant she was still holding.“He hardly sleeps. Classic failure to thrive. So they’ve decided not to assignhim to a family at the Ceremony. We’re going to keep him here another year, givehim a chance to mature a bit. Some newchildren do take longer than others.Thirty-six has been very difficult.“I take him back to my dwelling at night,” he explained. “The night crew herehas been complaining about him. He keeps the others awake. So he spends nightswith my family.”He reached for the infant and Claire relinquished him reluctantly. As she passedhim from her arms into the man’s, she felt something. She pushed the blanketaside and looked at a metal bracelet encircling one tiny ankle.“What’s this?”“Security. It would set off an alarm if he were removed from the building.”Claire took a quick breath, recalling the thought she had had briefly: I couldtake him.“All the newchildren wear them. I’m not sure why. Who would want one?” The manchuckled. “I’ll take his off when I take him with me at the end of the day.”The infant slept on, and the man murmured to him quietly. “Good boy,” she couldhear him say. “Coming home with me tonight? That’s a good, good boy.”He turned away, still murmuring, and took the newchild back to his crib.Watching and listening, Claire thought she heard the nurturer whisper a name.But she couldn’t quite make out what it was. Abe? Was that it? It sounded, shethought, like Abe."},{"pageContent":"EIGHTClaire didn’t attend the Ceremony. Almost everyone in the community did, everyyear. But each facility needed to leave someone in charge, and Claire hadvolunteered to stay at the Hatchery. The Birthmothers, the Vessels, were exempt,and so Claire had not attended the two previous years either; and now she foundthat she didn’t have much interest in the two-day event anymore.The Naming and Placement of Newchildren was always first on the program, so thatthe infants could be taken away and cared for during the remaining hours, andwouldn’t be disruptive. Claire would have wanted desperately to attend theCeremony if her own child, Abe (she was trying to think of him now by the nameshe had overheard) were to be given to a parental pair. But it would be anotheryear for him, and she had little interest in watching the placements of theothers.Neither did she care much about the Matching of Spouses. Like Claire, mostpeople found the Matching boring—important, of course, but with few surprises.When an adult member of the community applied for a spouse, the committeepondered for months, sometimes even years, making the selection, matching thecharacteristics—energy level, intelligence, industriousness, other traits—thatwould make two people compatible. The spouse pairs were announced each year atthe Ceremony and shared a dwelling after that. Their pairing was watched andmonitored for three years, after which they could apply for a child, if theywished. The Assignment of the Newchild, when they received one, was actuallymore exciting than the Matching.Thinking about it as she wandered the halls of the empty lab, so quiet andunoccupied today, Claire found herself wondering, suddenly, if she would be ableto apply for a spouse. As Birthmother, she had not been eligible. But now? Rolf,her coworker, had put in an application and was waiting. And so had Dimitri,she’d heard. Could she? She wasn’t old enough yet. But when she was? She didn’tknow. The regulations for ordinary citizens were so clear, so well known, socarefully followed. But Claire’s situation was unusual. And she had been givenvery little information when she was dismissed and transferred to the Hatchery.It was as if they had lost interest in her. They. She wasn’t even sure who theywere. The Elders. The committees. The voices that made announcements over thespeakers, like the message this morning: PLEASE GATHER AT THE AUDITORIUM FOR THEOPENING OF THE CEREMONY.She glanced at the time. It was late morning now. The spouses would be paired,the newchildren named and assigned. Soon there would be a lunch break, withtables set up and lunch packets distributed, outside the Auditorium. Then theywould reconvene for the beginning of the Advance in Age and the rituals ofgrowing older.The younger children were presented in groups: all the Sevens, for example,receiving their front-buttoned jackets; the Nines, brought to the stage andgiven their first bicycles to great applause. Haircuts for all the Tens, withthe little girls losing their braids, and then the sweepers coming quickly tothe stage to remove the shorn hair. But the Advance in Age Ceremonies usuallymoved quickly along, to applause—and some laughter as well, because every yearsomeone burst into tears for one reason or another, or felt compelled to showoff on the stage and did something foolish.Claire had participated in those rituals throughout her childhood. She didn’tmind missing them now.The Ceremony of Twelve, which would begin on the second morning, was always thehighlight. Here was when the unexpected could happen, as the children receivedtheir Life Assignments. It had always been fun, watching the Assignments givenout. Until her own, of course.Well. It was in the past. But she was happy not to be there today, in theaudience, watching as other young girls heard that they too had been found fitonly to breed.It seemed odd, the silence with everyone gone for the day. There was not much,really, for her to do; she was simply required to be there, to be certainnothing went awry. But everything—the temperature in the labs, the humidity,even the lighting—was carefully calibrated and controlled. Claire checked thescreen of her computer periodically for incoming Hatchery messages, but nothingwas urgent.She glanced through a window at the supply boat that was moored at the dock. Ithad arrived at a bad time. With the Ceremony taking place, they would have towait two days before they could unload. Probably, she realized, they’d be happyto have some time free of work. She wondered what the crew was doing on thisunexpected vacation. She had watched them previously, and heard them, liftingand stacking and carrying and directing. Their clothes were different; theydidn’t wear the loose-fitting tunic of the community. And they spoke with aslight accent, an inflection that was unfamiliar.Claire had never been curious about those from Elsewhere. It was part of thecontentment she had always known. Here had always been enough.Now, through the window, she stared at the heavy-laden moored boat and foundherself wondering about its crew."},{"pageContent":"NINEThat lunch was pretty awful, wasn’t it?”Eric entered the lobby of the Hatchery with the others at the end of the day.The group was noisy and laughing, obviously happy to be finished with the hoursof ritual, sitting, paying attention, politely applauding.“It wasn’t so bad,” one of the other workers replied. “Just wasn’t enough of it!I’m still hungry.”Claire was seated at the receptionist’s desk. “It’s almost time for dinner,” shetold them. “How was the Ceremony?”“Fine,” someone said. “They got all the way through the Elevens, so there’s onlythe Ceremony of Twelve left for tomorrow morning.”“Good. It went smoothly, then. No children misbehaved or had a tantrum,” Clairesaid, laughing.“Nope. No surprises at all,” Edith told her.“Except maybe for Dimitri,” Eric announced.“Dimitri?”Everyone chuckled. “He thought he’d be assigned a spouse. He was on the edge ofhis seat. But they didn’t call his name.”“Oops. That means he has another whole year to wait,” Claire said.“Or more!” Eric pointed out. “There have been people who waited years formatching.”“Well, it’s for the best,” Edith commented. “There probably wasn’t a good matchfor him available this time.”A young man whose name Claire didn’t know had been listening. “He only appliedfor a spouse because he wanted a dwelling,” he said. “He’s tired of living inthe dorm.” He turned, seeing Dimitri come through the door. “Even though he getsa special suite, for being director. Isn’t that right, Dimitri? You’re sick ofthe dorm, right?”Dimitri crushed the program he was carrying into a wadded ball, and tossed it atthe young man. “I’m sick of living with you, that’s all!” He grinned, picked upthe paper where it had fallen, and tossed it into the trash receptacle.They hung their jackets on the row of pegs beside the front door. “Everythingquiet here, Claire?” someone asked.She nodded. “A couple of the boatmen came ashore and went for a walk. I saw themstrolling along the river path.”“Those guys are so odd,” Eric commented. “They never talk to anyone.”“Maybe it’s against their rules,” Claire suggested.“Could be. Elsewhere probably has completely different rules.”“Actually, talking to them might be against our rules. Has anyone checked?”Edith asked.Everyone groaned and most of them glanced at the large monitor on thereceptionist’s desk.It occurred to Claire that she could check on the rules and answer her ownquestion about whether she could apply for a spouse. But did she care, really?Enough to make her way through the lengthy index and perhaps find her answer ina sub-subparagraph or footnote? Probably not, she thought.The loud rasp of the buzzer summoned them all to the cafeteria for the eveningmeal. She rose and found her place in the line. From a window in the hallway,she noticed two members of the boat crew lounging on the deck of the vessel. Itwas heavily loaded with crates of cargo, and the two young men sat side by side,leaning against a sealed container. Each of them held a small cylinder to hismouth, and it appeared that they sucked smoke from it and then blew the smokeinto the air. It was an odd custom that she had not seen before, and shewondered what its purpose was. Perhaps it was a medicinal inhaler of some sort.The line moved forward. Conversations, laughter, and comments interrupted herthoughts. Claire approached the stack of trays, took hers from the top, and sawthat Edith and Jeannette had saved a seat for her at their table. She movedahead, holding her tray out to the serving person behind the counter, and putthe boat crew out of her mind.“What was the Naming of Newchildren like?” she asked them after she had sat downwith her tray of food. “Were there any surprising names?”“Not really,” Jeannette said, “except I was startled to hear that one, a boy,was given the name Paul. That was my father’s name.”“But they can’t use the same name twice!” Edith said. “There are never twopeople in the community with the same name!”“But they do regive names,” Claire pointed out, “after someone is gone.”“Right. So that means my father is gone. I was surprised to hear it,” Jeannettesaid.“When did you see him last?” Claire asked. She could remember her own parents,but it had been several years, and details about them had begun to fade.Jeannette thought, and shrugged. “Probably five years. He worked in FoodProduction, and I never go over that way. I see the woman who was my mother nowand then, though, because she’s in the landscaping crew. Not very long ago Inoticed her trimming the bushes over at the edge of the recreation field. Shewaved when she saw me.”“Nice,” Edith said, offhandedly. “You want the rest of that salad? Can I haveit?” Jeannette nodded, and Edith reached for the half-empty plate that had beenset to the side.“Paul’s a handsome name,” Claire said, feeling a little sorry for Jeannette,though she didn’t know exactly why. “It’s nice when they reuse a good one. Iremember back when I was a Ten, they named a newchild Wilhelmina, and everyonecheered, because everyone had been fond of the previous Wilhelmina before sheentered the House of the Old. So when she was gone, it was nice to reuse hername.”“I remember that. I was there,” Edith said.“Me too,” Jeannette recalled. “Nobody cheered when they named the new Paul. ButI think there was a feeling of satisfaction. People liked my father,” she said.“He was nice. Very quiet. But nice.”They finished their meal in silence. Then, at the sound of the buzzer, theystacked their plates and began to tidy their table. It was dusk. The others were tired after the long day of the Ceremony.Anticipating another day of it tomorrow, they had drifted off to their roomsearly, after the evening meal. But Claire found herself restless after the dayindoors. She decided to take a walk.The path along the river was shaded and pleasant at this time of day. Ordinarilyshe would have encountered others walking, and exchanged greetings. But no onewas out and about this evening; it had been a long day for them all. Clairewandered beside the water until she approached the huge bridge. It was forbiddento cross it without special permission, and she had no idea what lay beyond, onthe other side. There was nothing visible but trees. It was simply Elsewhere.She had heard people say that occasionally, though rarely, small groups weretaken to visit other communities. But perhaps it was just a rumor. Claireherself had never known anyone who had seen Elsewhere.Standing at the base of the massive concrete supports that formed the foundationfor the bridge, Claire measured it with her eyes. The barge that was now mooredby the Hatchery must have barely fit beneath.If she crossed the intersecting road here, she would continue along the riverpath and pass the large barn that housed official vehicles. Citizens made theirway around the community only by bicycle, but large deliveries were transportedby trucks, and sometimes maintenance required heavy equipment. It was all storedhere. Claire remembered a few years back, when she had been a Ten or a Nine, theboys who were her age-mates had all been fascinated by the vehicle barn. Theyhad, almost all of them, yearned to be assigned a career involvingtransportation so that they could be trained to drive the equipment.But it had never interested Claire, and it didn’t this evening. She turned ontothe main stretch of road and walked to the northwest, away from the river, withthe central plaza spread out on her left. She passed the Auditorium, which stoodat the end of the plaza; earlier in the day the community had gathered inthrongs on its steps, and they would be there again in the morning. But now, atdusk, the plaza was empty and the large building that dominated its southwestborder was quiet and seemed unoccupied.She realized that she was walking toward the Nurturing Center. She could turnleft there and continue on past the Infirmary and the Childcare Center, making alarge loop that would take her back to the Hatchery.“Hi there!”The man’s voice startled her. The entire community had been so still. Butlooking up, Claire saw the bicycle stopped at the corner of the plaza. Sherecognized the nurturer who had been so pleasant to her during her visits. Shesmiled, waved, and walked toward the corner where he waited, one foot on theground, balancing his bike.He put one finger to his lips as she approached. “Shhh.” Then he gestured towardthe back of his bicycle, where a carrying basket had been attached. As she camenear, she could see that there was a sleeping infant in the basket. “Finallyhe’s asleep,” the man whispered. “I’m taking him home for the night.”Claire nodded and smiled down at Newchild Thirty-six.“Were you at the Ceremony?” the man asked.She shook her head. “I volunteered to stay at the Hatchery. I’ve been to enoughCeremonies.” She kept her voice lowered, as he had.The nurturer chuckled softly. “I know the feeling,” he said. “But it was fun forme today. Part of my job is giving the newchildren to their parental units. Thenew mothers and fathers are always so excited.“I’m glad we get to nurture this one for another year, though,” he added,reaching to touch the edge of the basket. “He seems pretty special.”Claire nodded in agreement, not trusting herself to speak.“Gotta go,” the man said. He placed his right foot on the uptilted pedal of thebike. “Tomorrow’s a big day for my family unit. Our son’s a Twelve this year.Lots of nervousness and apprehension.”“Yes, I’m sure,” Claire said.“Come visit us again at the Center? We’ll have a new batch of newborns arrivingsoon. And this guy will be there too, of course! His playmates will all be gone,to their new family units, so he’ll enjoy visitors.”“I will.” She smiled at him, and he set off again on his bike, toward the areaof family dwellings. Claire stood there watching the little basket jiggle gentlyas the bicycle moved along the path. Then she turned away."},{"pageContent":"TENApparently the Ceremony of Twelve had concluded with a surprise. When theHatchery workers returned at the end of the second day, they were murmuringabout it.The second day of the Ceremony was always a long day. New Twelves were called tothe stage individually and their attributes described. It was the first timethat the youngsters were singled out and attention paid to the accomplishmentsof their childhood. A boy might be praised for his scholarship, and the audiencereminded of his special abilities in science. Or the Chief Elder might even callattention to an especially pretty face—it was always embarrassing when thathappened, because in the community attractiveness was never considered an assetto be mentioned—and the Twelve thus described would blush, and the audiencelaugh. The community was always attentive and supportive; each adult had beenthrough this experience and knew how important it was. But going one by one didmake for a long time on the second day.“The Chief Elder skipped one Twelve,” Rolf explained to Claire at the eveningmeal. “She went from Eighteen to Twenty.”“We all cringed. We thought she’d made a mistake.” Edith straightened andtensed, demonstrating with her posture how nervous she and the others had been.“Everybody thought so. Did you hear the murmur go through the Auditorium?”someone asked.“And the boy she skipped? Number Nineteen? I could see him from where I wassitting. He was completely nonplussed!” A young man at the end of the tablegrinned.“So what happened?” Claire asked.“Well,” Rolf explained, “after she finished with the last one—”“Number Fifty?”“Yes. But of course she had only called up forty-nine to the stage. Then sheapologized to the audience.”“The Chief Elder apologized?” It was hard to believe.Rolf nodded. “She laughed a little. She could see we were all sort of nervous.So she reassured us, and apologized for making us uncomfortable. Then she calledthe boy, number Nineteen, to the stage.”“He looked as if he was going to throw up,” Eric said, laughing.“I don’t blame him,” Claire said. She found herself feeling sorry for the boy.It must have been an awful moment for him. “What did she say to him?”“That he hadn’t been assigned—which we all knew, of course. But then—this wasthe surprise. She said he’d been ‘selected.’”“Selected for what?” Claire had never heard of such a thing before.Rolf raised an eyebrow and shrugged. “I don’t know.”“Didn’t she say?”“Yes, but I didn’t understand what she was talking about. Did any of you?” Helooked around at his coworkers at the table.“Not really,” Edith said. “It was important, though. It had to do with the Giverand the Receiver.”“Whoever they are,” someone murmured.“Yes, it sounded really important,” Eric agreed.“Do you think the boy understood?”They all shook their heads. “He looked completely confused,” Edith said. “I feltsorry for him.”The cleanup buzzer sounded. They began to gather their plates and forks. “Whowas he?” Claire asked. She was still fascinated by the idea of the selected boy.“Never heard of him before. But we all know his name now, don’t we?” Eric saidwith a laugh.“What do you mean?”“The whole community called out his name. It was a kind of ceremonial . . . Whatwould you call it? A recognition. We all shouted the name over and over. Jonas!”Rolf, Edith, and some other workers joined in. “Jonas! Joooonas!”People at all the other tables looked up. Some seemed amused, others a littleworried. Then they too called the name. “JOOOONAS! JOOOONAS!”The final buzzer sounded and they fell quiet. People looked around at each otherin the sudden silence. Then they stood to leave the room. Dinner had ended."},{"pageContent":"ELEVENClaire walked again along the river before retiring. Once more she was alone.Usually the workers took walks in pairs or groups, but again tonight the otherswere tired after the unusual day. One by one they had gone to their rooms, someof them carrying the readers that they were supposed to study in order toadvance in their jobs. From time to time Claire turned her reader on and skimmedthe material, but she had little interest in it. She had not been selected forthis job by a committee that had perceived her fascination with fish. They hadsimply sent her here because they needed a place to put her after her failure asa Birthmother.She had read the manual pages listlessly several times, guiltily aware of herown disinterest. She had memorized a phrase: cleavage, epiboly, andorganogenesis. She could still say it but realized that she had completelyforgotten what it referred to.“Activation of cortical alveoli,” Claire murmured, walking. That was anotherphrase, a heading she had memorized in the manual.“What?” a nearby voice asked, startling her. She looked up.It was one of the boat crew, a young man in shorts and a sweater. He wore darklaced shoes made from a kind of canvas, with thick, textured soles that Claireassumed prevented him from slipping on the wet deck of the vessel. She wasn’tfrightened. He was smiling and looked quite friendly, not at all anyone to benervous about. But she had never spoken to any of the boatmen before, or they toher.“Is that a different language?” he asked, grinning. He had the distinctiveaccent she had overheard.“No,” Claire answered politely. “We speak the same language.”“Then what is ‘amplification of corsical alveoli’?”Claire couldn’t help laughing. He had gotten quite close to her words, but stillhe was amusingly wrong.“I was just trying to memorize something for work,” she explained. “A phase ofembryonal development. It’s a little boring, I’m afraid, unless you arefascinated by fish. I work at the Hatchery.”“Yes, I’ve seen you there.”“You’ve had to wait to unload because of our annual Ceremony.”He shrugged. “Not a problem. Nice to rest from the work. We’ll unload tomorrowand be on our way.”He had begun to walk beside her and now they were approaching the bridge. Theystopped there for a moment and watched the turbulent churning of the water.“Do you ever worry that a bridge might be too low? Do you encounter otherbridges? Might your boat be too tall for a low one?”He chuckled. “Not my job to worry,” he said. “The captain has the charts andknows the routes. We’re six point three meters. Never bumped a bridge yet, orknocked a crew member into the drink.”“We’re required to learn to swim but we’re not allowed in the river,” she foundherself telling him.“Required? Who requires it?”Claire felt slightly flustered. “It’s just one of the rules of the community. Welearn in a pool. When we’re five.”The young man laughed. “No rules like that where I come from. I learned when mydad threw me into a pond. I was eight, I think. Swallowed half the pond before Imade my way to the dock, and my dad laughing the whole time. I bawled when I gotout and so he threw me back in.”“Oh. Goodness.” Claire didn’t know quite what to say. She couldn’t imagine thescene. Her own swimming class had been orderly and precise, with specialinstructors. No heartless laughing men called Dad.“After that I could swim. Wouldn’t want to try in this river, though.” He lookeddown at the fast-moving dark water, how it pounded against some rocks near thebank, then slid splashing over them, so that they disappeared briefly, thenreemerged with foam sliding down their slick, mossy sides.Some years before, a child named Caleb had fallen into the river near here andthe entire community had performed the Ceremony of Loss. Claire remembered it:the shock, the hushed voices, and how parents had kept their children nearbyafterward, and warned them, sternly, again and again. She thought she rememberedhearing that the parents of the lost child, Caleb, had been chastised. It wasthe job of parental units to protect their children from harm. Caleb’s parentshad not performed well.Yet this boy’s father had thrown him into deep water, and laughed; and now hehimself laughed at the memory. It seemed so strange.They chatted. He asked about her job and they discussed fish aimlessly for awhile. In a place far away—he gestured—he had seen some almost as large as theboat. She thought he might be joking, but he seemed serious. Could it be true?She wanted to ask him where his boat would go next. Where it came from; where hecame from. It was Elsewhere, really, that she wondered about. But she feltuneasy. She was afraid that asking such questions might somehow be against therules. Anyway, it was beginning to get dark, and she knew she must return. “Ihave to get back,” she said.He turned with her and they walked toward the Hatchery buildings. “Would youlike to see aboard?” he asked suddenly.“I don’t think it’s allowed,” she told him apologetically.“The captain wouldn’t mind. He often has visitors come aboard. We’re a sea-rivervessel. Very unusual. People like to come aboard and look around.”“Sea-river?”“Yes. We don’t stay just to the river. We can go to sea as well. Most riverboatscan’t.”“Sea,” Claire said. She hadn’t the slightest idea what that meant.He misunderstood her. “Yes, they want to see the galley, and the wheelhouse, allof it. Very curious. The captain is proud to show them around. Or a crew membercan. We have a crew of ten.”“I meant that I’m not allowed. I have to stay at my work, I’m afraid.”They had reached the fork in the path that meant they would separate, he headingback along the river to his boat. She would turn here toward the Hatcheryentrance.“Too bad,” he said. “I would enjoy showing it to you. And you could meet Marie!”“Marie?”“She’s the cook on the boat.” He laughed. “That surprises some people, that wehave a woman aboard.”Claire was puzzled. “Why would people be surprised by that?”“Boating is men’s work, mostly.”“Oh.” Claire frowned. Men’s work? Women’s work? Here in the community, there wasno such difference.“Yes, I would have enjoyed meeting Marie, and seeing the inside of the boat,”Claire told him. “Maybe when you return. Perhaps our rules will change. Or Imight apply for special permission.”“Good night, then,” he said, and turned toward the boat path.Claire waved and stood watching as he disappeared beyond the overhanging bushes.Then she turned away. “Sea,” she repeated to herself, wondering what it mightmean. Sea."},{"pageContent":"TWELVEThe weeks passed. Except for the secret she carried always with her, the secretof the baby, each day was much like the one before, and the one after. It hadalways been so, Claire realized. There had been no surprises in her life, or inanyone’s within the community. Just the Assignment Ceremony, at Twelve: thedisappointing surprise, then, of being named Birthmother. And later, of course,the shock of her failure.But now it was again the dull routine of daily life in the community. Therasping voice through the speaker, making announcements, giving reminders. Therituals and rules. The mealtimes, and the work. Always the work. Claire had beengiven increasingly more demanding tasks in the lab, but they were still tediousand repetitious. She performed the work well but often found herself restlessand bored.What was it she had been told about this year’s Ceremony? A boy had been singledout. It wasn’t clear why, and no mention had been made of it again. Perhaps thatboy—she remembered that his name was Jonas—was doing something different, andinteresting. But she couldn’t imagine what it might be.She had visited the Nurturing Center again but been turned away. After all thenewchildren had been assigned parental units at the Ceremony, the Center wasalmost empty. Newborns were beginning to arrive to start the year’s population.But when Claire stopped by, though she was greeted pleasantly by thereceptionist, she was told that they had no need for extra help until thenumbers increased.“It’s actually vacation time for nurturers,” the young woman explained. “Most ofthem are volunteering at other places while we wait for more infants.” Shepeered at her computer screen. “We have two arriving next week.”She smiled at Claire. “Right now?” she said. “No need for help. But thanks forstopping by. Maybe in a couple of months.”Claire wanted to ask, But what about Thirty-six? He’s still here, isn’t he? Hewasn’t assigned, remember? You’re keeping him another year. He needs someone toplay with him, doesn’t he? Couldn’t I be the one?But of course she said nothing. It was clear that the receptionist, howeverpolite, was disinterested and wished Claire would leave. Reluctantly she turnedaway and left the building.From time to time, though, she saw the man who worked there, the one who had hada special fondness for Thirty-six. She waved one afternoon when, out for a walkafter lunch, she saw him across the Central Plaza, on his bicycle. He wasapparently out on an errand; there was a package in his front basket. He smiledand waved back in reply. She noticed that his bicycle now had a child seat onthe rear, replacing the carrying basket that had once held Thirty-six. Thelittle seat was empty, but the fact that it was there gave Claire hope. Itseemed that perhaps the nurturer was still taking him home at night. And hewould be sitting up now. Claire pictured his sturdy little body and how he wouldgrin in delight to feel the fresh air and see the trees.She began to time her walks, carefully finishing in the lab and cleaning upthere so that she could leave work and stroll during shift-change time. Shewalked to the part of the community that seemed most likely: the northeastcorner of the Central Plaza, where the Nurturing Center stood and then thedwellings began, across the main boulevard. She had hopes of seeing the nurturerheading back to his dwelling for the evening meal, with little Abe riding behindhim.Finally her timing was right. There they were.“Hello there!” Claire called.The man looked up, recognized her, and eased his bicycle to a standstill,balancing it with his right foot on the path. “How are you?” he askedcheerfully. “It’s Claire, isn’t it?”She was pleased that he remembered her name. She wasn’t wearing her nametag—itwas still pinned to the lab coat she had hung up when she left work. And it hadbeen three months now since they had seen each other.“Yes, that’s right. Claire.”“Nice to see you. It’s been a while.”“I stopped by but they said they didn’t need me to help out because thenewchildren had all been assigned.”He nodded. “All but this one!”Claire hadn’t wanted to look directly at Abe. Not at first. But now, since hehad mentioned the infant in the child seat, she turned her attention there andsmiled at the child, who was busily examining a leaf in his hands. He must havepulled it from a bush as they rode past. She watched as he held the leaf to hisown mouth and tasted it with a puzzled, uncertain look. She could see that hehad two teeth.“You’re still taking him to your dwelling at night?”The nurturer nodded. “He still doesn’t sleep well. It annoys the night workersat the Center, especially now that they have some newborns to tend.“But my family unit enjoys him. My daughter—her name is Lily—tried to convinceme that we should apply for what they call a variance.”“A variance? What’s that?”“An exception to a rule. Lily thought we should try to convince them that threechildren would be appropriate for our family.”“And did you apply?” Claire asked.He laughed. “Nope. My spouse would have applied for an annulment of our pairingif I had! This guy will be assigned to his own family next time around. He’ll befine. But in the meantime, it’s fun having him at our dwelling nights.” Heturned to look behind him at the baby. “Oh, great,” he groaned. “Eating a leaf.Well, I’ve been trained to sponge away spit-up. Part of the job!”Claire could see that he was beginning to shift his balance and move his rightfoot toward the bike pedal. “Are you allowed to use his name in public now?” sheasked quickly, trying to keep them there for another minute or so. “I rememberthat you were using it secretly.”The man hesitated. “Actually,” he said a little guiltily, “we do use it at home.But we’re not supposed to. He’s still just Thirty-six until he’s assigned.“So I’m afraid I can’t tell you what it is. But it’s a good one.”“I’m sure it is. They always choose carefully, don’t they? I like yourdaughter’s name. Lily. It’s pretty.”He smiled. “I have to be off. He’s happy now, with that leaf to chew. But waittill he wants real food. He’ll start yowling. And it’s almost mealtime.”“It was nice to see you,” she told him.“You too. I’ll tell my daughter that you think her name is pretty. She’ll lovehearing that.” He rolled his eyes, as if it were too silly for words. “And ofcourse, just to be fair and equal, I have to tell you that my son has a nicename as well.”Claire laughed. “I’m sure he does.”The nurturer started off slowly on the bicycle. Behind him, strapped into thelittle seat, his mouth speckled with leaf fragments, the infant looked back andgrinned at Claire.“It’s Jonas,” the man called, referring to his son, and pedaled away toward thegroup of dwellings where he lived."},{"pageContent":"THIRTEENShe arranged her days so that she would see them often, the man and the infanton the back of his bicycle. She became accustomed to the times, morning andevening, when the two of them made the short journey to and from the NurturingCenter, and she took walks then, after breakfast and before the evening meal.Often she encountered them, and usually the man stopped to chat, thoughsometimes he was rushed and had to hurry on. Little Abe (though she carefullyreferred to him as Thirty-six) knew her now, and grinned when he saw her. Theman had taught him to wave his small hand when she said “Bye-bye” and they rodeon. It became something to look forward to, a pleasant interruption to the longhours of lab work, which held little interest for Claire.He imitated her. She poked her own tongue into her cheek, making a bump. Hestared at it, then pushed his own small tongue into his own cheek. She wrinkledher nose. So did he. Then she did the two things together, her tongue into hercheek, her nose scrunched; solemnly he did the same, and they both began tolaugh.He was growing. Though he was technically now simply a One—every newchild bornhis year had become a One at the Ceremony—she calculated the months from the dayof his birth. It had been, now, ten months.“He’s trying to walk,” the nurturer told her one morning.“He’s strong,” she said, gazing at the sturdy small legs dangling from the childseat on the back of the bike.“Yes. We hold his hands and he takes steps. One day soon he’ll be on his own. Myspouse will have to put things high up on the counters. He grabs at everything.”“You have to be careful,” Claire said, almost talking to herself, thinking abouthow difficult it must be to care for an infant.“Of course that was part of my training,” the nurturer explained reassuringly.“And I’ve taught my spouse and children.“Hey!” he said suddenly, laughing. He turned. The newchild was tugging at hisuniform. “Don’t mess me all up! This was just delivered from the laundry!”He turned to Claire. “Could you reach into that carrying case and get hishippo?” He pointed to a zippered case behind the child seat.“His what?” Claire pulled the zipper open.“His comfort object. It’s called hippo.”“Oh.” She reached in and took out the stuffed toy. All small children hadcomfort objects. They came in various shapes. Hers, she remembered, had beencalled badger.The newchild’s eyes lit up when he saw it. “Po,” he said, and reached for thetoy. Claire handed it to him; he hugged it with a satisfied sigh and began tochew on one of its small ears.“I think they might be ready to have you stop by and help again,” the nurturersuggested. “We have a batch of new ones.“And the little ones take my time,” he added. “You could come play withThirty-six and keep him out of mischief.”“I will.” She waved when they rode on, and called “Bye-bye,” but the newchildwas preoccupied with his hippo and didn’t even hear her. She saw Marie for the first time. The cargo boat had come and gone now threetimes since the day she had met and talked to its crew member. Each month itarrived and remained at dock only a day, long enough for the unloading. Sherecognized the boy she had walked with once, and waved when she saw him on thedeck. He waved back. Claire almost felt that if he repeated his invitation for atour, she would say yes, though she would ask permission first, she decided. Shewould check with the Hatchery director.But they came and went so quickly that the boy (odd, she thought of him as herfriend though in truth they had shared only one brief conversation) did not comeashore.And now they were moored again, but she didn’t see him. Other crew membersscrambled about, tending lines, lifting crates, but the dark-haired boy wasn’tthere. Claire glanced over at the activity on the boat through the windows ofthe lab from time to time, and it became clear that he was no longer part of thecrew.She mentioned it to her coworker, Heather, phrasing it carefully. “There used tobe a dark-haired boy who worked on the boat, but—”“Lots of dark-haired boys. Look. There are three right there, piling thosecrates.”Heather was correct. Three muscular young men were lifting and straighteningsome heavy boxes. Each had dark hair.“Yes, but I meant a different one, one who used to wave to me. He and I talkedonce.”Heather shrugged. “They come and go. Different ones almost every time. Some stayawhile, others not so much. It’s not like here, where we get assigned. I thinkthey can decide about their jobs. If it gets boring, they leave. Or maybesomething better comes along.”“Look! Who’s that?” Claire pointed. A heavy woman had come from the interior ofthe boat and stood on the deck, watching the crew at work. She wore a stainedapron stretched across her wide middle and tied in back. Her light hair waspulled back into a knot, but it was unruly, and as the girls watched, the womansmoothed and retied it. Then she lowered herself and sat on a thick pile ofrope, leaning back against the cabin wall, and took a few deep breaths.“Mind your feet, Marie!” a crew member called as he passed her on the deck,guiding a thick package that swayed in a net as the winch moved it up andoutward.“Mind your own feet,” she called back with a hearty laugh. But she moved herlegs aside so that he could get by.“The boy told me there was a woman aboard,” Claire said. “I’d forgotten hername. But now I remember it’s Marie. She’s the cook.”“Cook?” Heather looked puzzled.Claire shrugged. “Well, they can’t have their meals delivered the way we do. Notwhen they’re on the river.” Or the sea, she added in her mind. “So I guess Marieprepares the food.”“Her apron has its share of it,” Heather said, referring to the darkened,spattered patches on the cloth, and she and Claire both laughed. Their ownuniforms were spotless. Their clothing was collected every morning, launderedmeticulously, and delivered each evening.“Would you go aboard, if they invited you?” Claire asked Heather. “Just for atour?”“You mean like when people come to visit the Hatchery and we show them around?”Claire nodded. Often small school groups came to visit and were given a littlelesson on the life cycle of fish.“I might, if it’s allowed,” Heather said with a shrug. “But I’m not really thatinterested in boats.”They watched as Marie rose heavily from where she had been relaxing, reenteredthe cabin, and disappeared into the dark interior. Claire found herselfwondering what it looked like in there. Where did Marie sleep? And how did itfeel to be on the river, to stop at other communities? Did people everywherelook the same? The boy she had met wore strange-looking shoes and unfamiliarclothing. He had a different speech inflection, she recalled. And the differenthairstyles on the boys was startling; some had almost clean-shaven heads;others, long hair tied back like a girl’s. Here in the community, each age had aprescribed hairstyle. But no boy ever had long hair.Marie, with her oddly light hair, was startling in other ways. She was large,especially broad across her hips, and with a double chin. No one in thecommunity looked like that. They were all of the same proportions. Their fooddelivery was calibrated to their size. Claire remembered a time some years agowhen the weekly report showed that her mother’s weight had risen slightly. Hermother had been a little embarrassed, and perhaps annoyed, when the next mealdeliveries included special weight-loss meals designated for her. She had eatenthem, of course—it was required, and there were no alternatives—until the reportshowed that her size was under control once again.“We’d better get back to work,” Heather murmured. She turned from the window.“I’m just going out for a minute. I want to check the temperature in the lowerholding pond.” Claire could see Heather frown suspiciously.“Well,” Heather said after a moment, “mind your feet. It’s muddy by the pond.”“Mind your own feet,” Claire replied with a laugh as she left the room.She had no intention of going aboard, even if they asked her. But the lower pondwas quite close to the river. The boat almost grazed the bank there, and shefelt a yearning to go close to it. Odd, she thought, but she felt almost luredby the boat, in the same way that she found herself drawn to the NurturingCenter and the newchild who had been wrested from her body almost a year before.There was no relationship between the two, but Claire was feeling increasinglyconnected to both.Standing beside the pond’s edge, she looked up at the vessel’s smooth sidetoward the low railing that edged the deck. The huge crates were all stackednow, and tightly roped in. There were places, near the cargo, where there was norailing. How easy it would be to slip on the wet deck and fall into the riverbelow! Mind your feet. She remembered the young man’s shoes with their ridgedsoles. Boat shoes, she had guessed, made specially for the wet deck.Claire was still standing there when the boat’s engine made a sudden low sound.In a moment it was a steady hum and she could see a spurt of dark smoke from asmall stack. Some voices called, and she saw a crew member pull loops of ropeloose from the moorings. He tossed them to another young man on the deck, andthen jumped across and steadied himself as the boat slid away toward the centerof the river.From the building nearby she heard the buzzer that announced the midday meal.She turned and walked back toward the Hatchery as behind her the cargo boatmoved with increasing speed toward the bridge and beyond. Behind it, at itsbroad stern, foam burst; then the river closed around the interruption andresumed its own form again, as if the boat had never been there.Claire sighed. Returning to her ordinary life seemed so unappealing. She wouldgo tomorrow, she decided, to visit little Abe."},{"pageContent":"FOURTEENOn the twelve-month anniversary of the day he had been born to her, Clairetaught him to say her name. He had been officially a One since the previousceremony, but now, Claire thought secretly, he is truly one year old.The nurturer chuckled when he watched the newchild toddle over to her, calling,“Claire!” with a grin. “He’s a bright boy,” he said. “I just wish we could gethis sleeping-pattern behavior squared away. If he’s not ready to be placed witha family unit by the time of the next Ceremony, well . . .”“What?” Claire asked when his voice drifted away without completing the thought.“To be honest, I don’t know. They can’t give him to parents if he doesn’t sleep.It would interrupt their work habits to be kept awake at night. But we can’tkeep him here indefinitely.”“Not even if he goes home with you at night? He’s fine here in the daytime. Hehardly ever cries. Look at him!” Together they gazed at Thirty-six, who wasseated on the floor, busily arranging wooden blocks in a stack. Feeling theirgaze, he looked over. Impishly, he wrinkled his nose and thrust his tongue intohis cheek, making the funny face that Claire had taught him. She made the sameskewed face in reply and they both laughed.“I can’t keep taking him home forever. My spouse is already somewhat annoyedabout it. The children enjoy him, though. He’s been sleeping in my son’s room.He seems to do well there. But . . .”Again he failed to finish his thought. The nurturer shrugged and went to theother section of the room where younger infants needed attention.“I wonder if I . . .” Claire murmured, then fell silent. Of course she couldn’t.Unmatched people weren’t given newchildren. Even if it were possible, how couldshe care for him? It was enough to contemplate (and she had) how she couldmanage a small infant. But now, so well acquainted with this growing, activetwelve-month-old boy, she could see clearly that they required more, not less,care as they grew. He had to be watched constantly. Taught language. Fedcarefully. Bathed and dressed and . . .She turned away, feeling tears well in her eyes. What on earth was the matterwith her? No one else seemed to feel this kind of passionate attachment to otherhumans. Not to a newchild, not to a spouse, or a coworker, or friend. She hadnot felt it toward her own parents or brother. But now, toward this wobbly,drooling toddler—“Bye-bye,” she whispered to him, and he looked up at her and wiggled hisfingers. It never distressed him when she left. He knew she’d be back.But Claire choked back tears as she pedaled her bike back to the Hatchery. Moreand more she despised her life: the dull routine of the job, the mindlessconversation with her coworkers, the endless repetition of her days. She wantedonly to be with the child, to feel the warm softness of his neck as he curledagainst her, to whisper to him and to sense how he listened happily to hervoice. It was not right to have these feelings, which were growing stronger asthe weeks passed. Not normal. Not permitted. She knew that. But she did not knowhow to make them go away. From time to time she saw the nurturer’s son. Jonas, she remembered. Monthsbefore she had seen his father wave to him one afternoon when he rode by with afriend, the two of them on their way apparently to the recreation field. The twoboys had seemed carefree, calling to each other, racing their bicycles along thepath.He seemed different now, to Claire. She saw him one evening walking along theriver, alone, deep in thought. Although he didn’t know her, and there would havebeen no real reason beyond politeness for a greeting, it was nonethelesscustomary for citizens to acknowledge one another with a nod or smile. But Jonashad not looked up as she passed him. It was not an intentional snub, sherealized. It was that his mind was somewhere else. He seemed somehow troubled,she thought, and that was rare in a youngster.She recalled that he had been singled out in some way at last year’s Ceremony.Her coworkers, in describing it, had chanted his name—Jonas, Jonas—as apparentlythe audience had. But they had not really known what his . . . What had theycalled it? Selection, that was it—what his selection had meant.But his father, the nurturer, spoke of him warmly and without hesitation. He’sbeen sleeping in my son’s room, he had said cheerfully of Thirty-six. So perhapsshe had simply happened on the boy at an unusual moment, when he had somethingon his mind, probably a school assignment. Claire could remember how troublingher own homework had been at times.She saw him several more times, always on his bicycle, alone, after schoolhours. He was a Twelve now, and all Twelves would be working hard this year onthe preparation related to their Assignments. Usually after school they wouldseparate from their age-mates and go to the studies required for their futurejobs. Sophia had been required to take infant-care classes, she recalled; and infact Sophia had told her that even now, several years after their Ceremony year,the scholarly Marcus was still studying engineering. One girl in her group hadtaken up the study of law, as Claire’s brother had six years earlier, and stillwent each day after school to the hall of Law and Justice for training.One afternoon she found herself watching Jonas as he rode his bicycle away fromthe school building, which she could see from the front of the Hatchery. Heturned left at the end of the educational buildings and seemed to be headingtoward the House of the Old. So perhaps, she thought, that was his Assignment:the care of the elderly. But what was so special about that? What would make anentire audience rise to their feet and chant his name?Later, one day while walking, she continued past the House of the Old, turneddown a path, and discovered a very small structure attached at the rear of thebuilding. It had a door, a few windows, and nothing else. Most buildings had aninformational plaque explaining the purpose of the structure. HATCHERYLABORATORY. NURTURING CENTER. BICYCLE REPAIR. But this undistinguished rectanglehad only an unobtrusive, meaningless label on the door. ANNEX.Claire had never heard of the Annex. She had no idea what could be housedinside. But she had a feeling that this was where the boy Jonas was spending histraining time. She wondered vaguely if what was happening in there was causinghim to become so oddly solemn and solitary.What could Jonas have been selected for?"},{"pageContent":"FIFTEENClaire looked around suddenly at her coworkers during the morning meal. Eversince her arrival at the Hatchery over a year earlier, she had felt differentfrom them. They didn’t seem to notice. They were friendly enough, and includedher in their outings. Everyone was fond of the director, Dimitri, who neverallowed his position of authority to make him arrogant. They were able to teasehim about his long wait for a spouse.But those who were young, as Claire was, shared small jokes, sometimes slightlyderisive of the older workers, how methodical and orderly they were, howdutifully they went home each evening to their spouses and family units.Of course they were all diligent workers as well; but youth was a time when acertain amount of lightheartedness was tolerated. Standing on the edge of theholding ponds, they gave the young fish silly names, and invented personalitiesfor them. “Look at Greedy Gus! He’s grabbing all the food again!” “Watch out!Here comes Big-Lips Buster!”Claire always smiled at the foolishness. The Vessels, during her time at theBirthing Unit, had done the same thing: found things to joke about, ways to passthe time. She had joined in. She had been part of it, and of them, until theend.But here she had always felt separate. Different. It was hard to identify why.But today, at breakfast, she suddenly noticed something that she had taken forgranted until now. As they cleared their plates, tossed their crumpled napkinsinto the waste container, and smoothed their uniforms in preparation for anotherday of work, each worker did one other routine, quick thing.They each took a pill.Claire knew about the pills. The pill-taking in the community began at aboutTwelve—or for some children, earlier. Parents observed their children anddecided when the time had come. She herself had not been deemed ready for thepills before her Ceremony of Twelve. It hadn’t mattered to her. Those of herfriends who took them found it a nuisance. But when she was selected Birthmotherat the Ceremony, part of her list of instructions had specified: No pills.If you are already taking the pills, stop immediately.If you have not yet begun, do not begin.She remembered now that the pill prohibition had seemed unimportant at the time.Her parents, though, were a little flustered by it. They took the pills. So didher brother, Peter. “I had them here ready for you when the time came,” Claire’smother had said with a nervous laugh. “I suppose I’ll just throw them away.”“Better turn them in,” her father had suggested.She had asked the other Vessels when she had taken up residence at the BirthingUnit. “Were you already taking the pills?” Claire inquired at mealtime oneevening.Some had shrugged and said no. But several nodded. “I stopped right away when Igot my instructions,” one girl said.“I sort of tapered off,” another girl explained.“I think it’s because we got switched over to vitamins,” Nadia had said. She wasreferring to the carefully measured dosages of vitamins that all the Vesselsdutifully took each morning. “The pills were probably just a different vitaminthat we don’t need anymore.”“No. The pill was something else entirely,” Suzanne insisted. She was the onewho said she had tapered off.“She’s right,” Miriam said. “The vitamins don’t make us feel any different. Butthe pill—” She hesitated. “Well, taking it didn’t seem to have any effect. Butwhen I stopped taking it, I began to feel . . .” But she couldn’t seem todescribe what she meant.“I felt restless,” Suzanne explained. “And—well, this is a little embarrassing.I don’t even know how to describe it. But I began to be aware of my ownfeelings. Not just in my head, but—well, physical feelings too.” She blushed,and chuckled nervously. The other girls, including Claire, felt embarrassed too,but intrigued. Feelings of any sort were not ordinarily discussed.“Yes, that’s it,” Miriam agreed, “and you know what? I think they want us toundergo that change. Without the pills, our body gets ready. That’s what we’reexperiencing.”“I kind of like it. I never really wanted anything before. But now I want theProduct. When I feel it growing, it makes me happy.” She rubbed her belly andsmiled.The other girls agreed, touching their own distended middles. “It’s a nicefeeling.”“After you give birth, you take the pills again, until you’re ready for the nexttime,” Nancy had said. She had produced three Products by then and was waitingfor her post-Birthmother Assignment.“How long? This is my first time,” Claire had asked. “I never had the pills atall.”“You will, though. After you produce, you’ll take the pills. Maybe six months.Then you stop, and you get ready for your next Product. See Karen over there?”She pointed to a young woman at a nearby table. “She just produced. She’s on thepills now. But in a few months she’ll need to start getting ready for her secondproduction.”“It’s really boring,” Suzanne said in a whisper. “When you’re between births,and taking the pills. Nothing is much fun. You don’t really notice it, though.”Now, looking around in the Hatchery cafeteria, Claire was aware that all theother workers took a pill every morning. And that was why, she realized, theirconversation was always lighthearted, superficial, essentially meaningless. Theywere like the Vessels in the pill-taking time between births—without feeling.She was the only one, she could see now, who did not take a pill each day—andshe guessed that it was simply a mistake. Her disastrous birth experience, andher decertification, had been so sudden and startling that no one at theBirthing Unit had thought to supply her with pills or instruct her to take them.Perhaps each attendant had thought that someone else had done so.And so she was the one who felt things. The only one! It was why she yearned forthe child, and felt her heart melt each time his little hand waved and he said“Bye-bye” to her, calling out her name in his silvery voice, smiling thatamazing smile.She would not let them take that from her, that feeling. If someone in authoritynoticed the error, if they delivered a supply of pills to her, she thoughtdefiantly, she would pretend. She would cheat. But she would never, under anycircumstances, stifle the feelings she had discovered. She would die, Clairerealized, before she would give up the love she felt for her son."},{"pageContent":"SIXTEENThe supply boat was once again moored by the Hatchery. Its ropes had been loopedover the posts and its slanted gangplank slid ashore. Recalling the delay theyhad suffered a year ago, this time they had arrived early and would be leavingbefore the coming two-day event prevented their departure.The time of the Ceremony was fast approaching. Had it really been that long? Hadshe been here at the Hatchery for well over a year? It was hard to believe. Butwhen she thought of the child, of little Abe, she was aware of how he haddeveloped from an infant wailing for a bottle when she first encountered himinto a giggly toddler who could say her name, wave bye-bye, and imitate thefunny face they now made to each other as a greeting that made them both laugh.Hearing her coworkers mention the upcoming Ceremony reminded her that Abe wouldbe assigned this time. He would move to a dwelling, have a set of parents andperhaps an older sibling. She would have to find a new way of continuing theirrelationship. Of course his new female parent—Claire could not make herselfthink mother—would have a job in the community as all women did. So the childwould go to the Childcare Center each day.Claire had done volunteer work there when she was young and fulfilling herrequired hours. She had enjoyed that time and knew that Abe would be well caredfor there. He would be given educational toys, fed a balanced diet fortifiedwith vitamins, taken for walks in the big multichild stroller, and introduced tobasic discipline: the meaning of no and don’t; how he must not suck his thumb,though he would be permitted to stroke his comfort object if he needed soothing.He would be tucked into a crib at naptime, when the big room’s lights weredimmed.Thinking of the naptime ritual, Claire felt a little concerned. Abe still wasnot a good sleeper. Most toddlers in the Childcare Center responded to firmdiscipline and learned quickly to be silent when the lights were dimmed. Sheremembered the rows of cribs with most of the little occupants sound asleep, andthose who were wakeful staring quietly at the ceiling. The small children hadnames by then, and she recalled walking along the row and reading LIAM,SVETLANA, BARBARA, HENRIK, on the identifying cards. Soon, after the upcomingCeremony, he would be officially Abe. She desperately hoped that the crib withhis name on it would not contain a wailing, sleepless little boy who would tosshis hippo to the floor and thump his feet rhythmically against the mattress.Shrieking and kicking, sometimes holding his breath until his face turnedfrighteningly dark, was what he was still doing at the Nurturing Center atnaptime. Whatever would they do with such a child when he entered the childcaresystem? Failure to thrive, they wrote on his chart when he was very young. Now?Failure to adjust? She shuddered. There were very severe consequences in thecommunity for a citizen who couldn’t adjust. Surely they would be more lenientwith a very small boy, Claire thought. But she wasn’t certain. It made hernervous to think about it.She rode over to visit one afternoon two days before the Ceremony and could seethe cleanup crews working hard outside the Auditorium, obviously preparing forthe one time each year when the entire community gathered. Claire would attendthis year. Already they had assigned a different worker to remain at theHatchery. It was important to her to see Abe assigned, to know where he would benext. Maybe, since the assignments were so close, she could sneak a look at thepaperwork; sometimes there was a clipboard on the nurturer’s desk. Perhaps theinformation was there.But when Claire arrived at the Nurturing Center, she could feel immediately thatsomething was wrong. Of course, she thought, they are all very busy because ofthe Ceremony plans. They have to prepare these children, all fifty, for newfamilies. A letter would have to accompany each newchild, a letter withinstructions for the parental unit: feeding information, schedules, disciplinereminders, health data, and observations about personality. Of course the staffwas preoccupied and distracted. It accounted, Claire thought, for the heightenedtension she felt. The nurturer who had always been so pleasant to her, the onewith a son named Jonas who took Abe to his dwelling at night, was oddly abruptwhen she greeted him. He seemed angry. She could hear a muttered argument takingplace in a corner. No one smiled at her.Even more distressingly, when she went to pick up Abe, who was playing with awooden toy on the floor, someone snatched him away.“Not a good idea to play with this one,” a uniformed female worker said.“There’s one over there: that girl? She needs to be changed. You could do thatif you want to be helpful.”The woman stalked off, holding Abe. She plopped him into an empty crib and hebegan to howl immediately. Everyone ignored him.“I could maybe quiet him down,” Claire suggested, “and you’d be able to get yourwork done more easily.”“Leave him,” the woman commanded her.Claire looked questioningly at the nurturer whom she had begun to think of as afriend. She realized, suddenly, that in all these months she had never asked hisname. But clearly now was not the time. His face was set in hard lines, and helooked away.“But I—”“I said: leave him,” the woman repeated impatiently.Claire wanted to argue, perceived that she must not, and fell silent. Dutifullyshe picked up the baby girl they had indicated and took her to the changingtable. In the background, Abe screamed and kicked at the bars of the crib. Noone moved toward him.Claire cleaned and diapered the cheerful female and set her back down with hertoys on the floor. Other babies crawled and played nonchalantly, as if they wereaccustomed to the shrieking boy in the crib. At the desk, the nurturer whosename she had never thought to learn, the one who (Claire knew) cared about Abe,suddenly slammed shut the reader/writer device he’d been working on. He stood.He looked at the clock on the wall.“I’m leaving early,” he said.“Excuse me?” The uniformed woman looked up. She seemed to have some authority.“I have a headache,” the nurturer said.The woman glanced at the communication system on the wall. “You can call formedication,” she pointed out.The nurturer ignored her. He went over to the crib and picked up Abe, who wasclutching his comfort object and still shuddering with sobs, though hisshrieking had subsided. “I’ll take him with me now. You know he spends thenights in my dwelling.”“No need,” she said sharply. “He might as well stay here tonight. What’s thepoint?”“The point is that my family is fond of him, and I would like to have him withus this evening.” He was speaking firmly to her, and Claire could see that shewas trying to decide whether to argue. When she turned back to the papers in herhands, it was clear that she had decided against any confrontation.“Return him early tomorrow,” she said. It sounded like an order.“I will.” He walked toward the door, the toddler in his arms, and then spoke toClaire. “Do you have your bike? Why don’t you ride partway with us? You can turnoff to the Hatchery at the main road.”Confused, Claire nodded to the woman, who ignored her, and followed the man andAbe. She waited to watch him pack the hippo into the carrying case, then strapthe child into the bike seat, then mounted her own bicycle and rode beside himon the path. He didn’t speak. The baby glanced at her, smiling now. She liftedone hand from the handle grip, waved to him, and watched him wave back. Bothbikes slowed at the intersection where Claire would turn to the right. Theystopped.“Maybe I’ll see you tomorrow,” she said uncertainly. “I know you have a lot ofwork because of the Ceremony, but—”He interrupted her. “I know you didn’t attend last year,” he said. “Do you planto go to this one?”Claire nodded. “I especially want to see Abe get his assigned family.”The man hesitated, then told her. “They’re not assigning him. And no moreextensions, either. They’ve run out of patience with him. They voted today.”Behind him, the child began to churn his legs. He wanted the bike to start upagain.“But what, then? Where will he—?”The man shrugged. “You should say goodbye now. He’ll be sent on his way in themorning.”“On his way where?”The child had heard the word “goodbye.” He opened and closed his chubby handtoward Claire. “Bye-bye!” he said. “Bye-bye!” Then he thrust his tongue into hischeek and made their secret funny face with its creased forehead and wrinklednose. Claire tried hard to make the face back to him, but it was difficult; shewas breathing hard and could feel tears rising hotly behind her eyes. “Where?”she asked again.But the man simply shook his head. It seemed to Claire that he was unable tospeak, that his breath was coming quickly as well. Then he gathered himself, andsaid offhandedly, “It’s just the way it is. It’s for the best. It’s the way thesystem works. And by the way, you have his name wrong. It’s not Abe.“Ready, little guy?” he asked, swiveling his head to check on his passenger.“Off we go!” As he started forward, some pebbles spat from the path and stungClaire’s ankle.Stunned, she watched the bicycle set off across the path that led to the familydwellings. Years later—many years later—when Claire tried to piece together memories of herlast days in the community, the last things she could see whole and clear werethe bicycle moving away and the back of the child’s head. The rest of the hoursthat followed were fragments, like bits of shattered glass. No matter how shetried to piece them together, she could never create it whole and unblemished.She remembered that the cargo boat was still docked. It was loading. They wererushing, for some reason. She heard someone call to another about weatherconcerns, a phrase she didn’t understand. There were the usual complicatedsounds of the departure preparations. Whistles and shouts. The thump of thecrates being stacked.But then night came and went and the boat had not left. Something had happenedin the night. There were alarm bells. In the Hatchery? Something wrong in thelab?No. Not there. The boat? Were the alarms from the boat? No. From farther away.From the main building. And from the speakers in each room. Loud announcements.Waking everyone. But why? What had gone wrong?It was morning now, in her memory. The boat crew had been preparing to cast offthe ropes and leave. But they were delayed. Time had passed. Usually the boatwas there so briefly. But this time it was longer. Something delayed the boat’sdeparture. Everyone was looking for something. Someone? Yes. It was that:Someone was missing. Searchers came and looked along the riverbank throughout the day. Then it wasdark again. Even at night they searched, with flashlights. They shouted.She remembered, strangely, that the nurturer had been standing on the path. Whywas he there? She had never seen him there before. Now he stood there, butdidn’t acknowledge Claire, didn’t look at her. He was looking at the river. Hewas calling a name.Jonas! Jonas!His son. Yes. That was his son.So it was his son who had gone missing.Piecing together the fragments of memory, Claire could feel the cool dirt of thepath under her bare feet. Why would she have been barefoot? Everyone always woreshoes. And running! Why had she been running?Now the nurturer spoke to her loudly. But what had he said? He took him!Jonas took the babe! Was that what he had shouted to her?Elsewhere! Elsewhere! (But what did that mean?)Then, through the blurred confusion of the memories, she found that she was onthe boat. She had run up the slanted plank, in her bare feet, crying. Theheavyset woman, her light hair unpinned, came from the cabin and put out herarms to Claire. She remembered the feeling of enfolding. The smells: sweat andonions from the woman. Fuel and damp wood from the boat itself. A puff of smoke.The scrape of the plank being pulled aboard.She was with them, on the boat. The engine throbbed. They were leaving. Why wasshe, Claire, on the boat?They were headed Elsewhere. They said they would help her find the boy, and thebaby.My son, she had told them, sobbing.Her next blurred memory was of sea, which she had never seen before. Rain:something she had never felt. Storm. Lightning. Waves. Fear. The men wereshouting. She was in the way; they shoved her aside and rushed to tie thingsdown. She couldn’t stand. It was wet and slippery even inside the cabin. Shefell. Sprawled on the floor, she heard things slide loose and break. She felt arush of water, suddenly; it pulled at her clothing. Cold. So cold. And then:Quiet. A hollow, rushing kind of quiet. Darkness.And that was all Claire remembered of those last days, no matter how hard shetried over the hard and lonely years that followed."},{"pageContent":"BOOK IIBETWEEN"},{"pageContent":"ONEThe slate gray sea roiled, scraping the narrow strip of sand rhythmically,tugging at beach grass, digging and sucking loose the rocks at the shore’s edge.Spray stung the men’s eyes when they went to tighten the ropes holding theirboats secure. Salt coated their beards and eyebrows. They pulled their woven hatbrims low.Old Benedikt cupped his hand above his eyes and peered upward, assessing the skythrough the pelting rain.“It won’t break for a while,” he called. “Not till night.” But his words werecarried off by the stiff wind, and the others, tugging and twisting at thecoarse ropes, didn’t hear him, didn’t reply.The women remained in their cottages. Fighting the weather was men’s work. Thewomen listened to the wind as it roared in the chimneys, to the ripping soundsof torn thatch, and to the whimpering of frightened children. They tended thefires, stirred the soups, rocked the babies, and waited. This storm would pass.The sea would calm. It always had. In the time that came after, the story of Water Claire took different forms. Itwas told and retold; things were forgotten, or shaped and changed. Always,though, there was this truth: that she came from the sea, flung in by thatfearsome December storm years before.Some said she was found, later, when the scudding clouds pulled aside and showedlow sun in early evening: that she was there on the strip of beach, her clotheshalf torn from her, and they thought she was dead till she stirred and her eyesopened to show the deep amber-flecked green that later all remembered the same.Others said no, it was Tall Andras who saw her in the waves, who threw himselfin and grabbed her by her long hair as she clung to a thick wood beam, that heswam with her till he could stand, and when they looked he was there in thechurning broth of sea with her in his thick arms, her head against his beard,and that he said but one word: “Mine.”Children said she was carried in by dolphins and they made games of it, andrhymes, but all of that was just tale-spinning and fun, and no one took it to betrue.Others murmured “selkie” from time to time when she was remembered, but only asa fanciful tale. The selkie stories of seal creatures were well known, oft told,and in all of them there was a shed skin. Water Claire had come in clothing,though it had been shredded by the gritty winter sea. She was human. There wasno seal to her.Or mermaid, either.She was a human girl sent to them by the sea, who stayed among them for a time,became a woman, and went away again.It was actually Old Benedikt himself who carried her in, once she was seen.Several, including Tall Andras, swam out, but it was Old Benedikt who reachedher first, slicing his way through waves with his burly, muscled arms. He priedher loose from the wood spar, for her fingers were locked there. He knew how towrap her lifeless arms around his neck and to hold her pale chin high above thefoam and spray. He had brought wounded sheep in from the field this way manytimes, holding them against his chest.He stood, finally, in the shallow surge and suck of water, walked forward, hisfeet heavy in the drenched, icy sand, and laid her there. He could see that shestill lived, and he covered her with the thick woven coat that he had thownaside as he entered the sea. Then he turned her wet, pale face to the side. Hepressed upon her through the coat until she spewed frothy brine onto the sand,and coughed.Tall Andras was there, it is true, and he thought, gazing down, that he wantedthe girl for his own, but did not give voice to it.Old Benedikt looked up at the surrounding men. “Run ahead,” he directed Gavin,who was fastest. “Tell Alys. We’ll carry her there.”Hastily the men gathered poles and coats and made a carrying litter, knowing howto do it for they had done it many times before. Their children fell from boatsand cliffs. Their sons and brothers were wounded by hooks and rope. Their womendied giving birth, and the newborns died too. They used such a litter for theslow journey to graveside.But this girl was alive, though her eyes stayed closed and her fingers clenchedas if she still felt the splintery mast in them. When they rolled her onto thelitter, she coughed again, and when they lifted it to carry her up the hill, acold breeze picked up a strand of her long wet hair, drawing it across hercheek. Her eyelashes fluttered then, and she began to tremble and whimper.Carefully, in the increasing darkness, for twilight was brief here in winter,they moved with her up the ridge and felt with their feet for the worn path thatwould take them to the village and to Alys’s hut at its edge. Four men carriedthe girl. The others walked behind. Now and then one stopped, turned, and lookedout toward the sea and the horizon with its darkening sky as if searching forthe silhouette of a vessel that might have thrown this astonishing gift theirway. But there was nothing there but what had always been there: empty ocean thecolor of pewter, tarnishing to black now as night fell. The village nestled at the foot of a forbidding cliff in the curved elbow of anarm of land. The peninsula jutted out from the main coast in an isolated placewhere time didn’t matter, for nothing changed. No newcomers had ever appeared,not in anyone’s memory, and only an occasional discontented man climbed out (forthat was what they called the leaving) or tried to. An overgrown, root-tangledpath meandered upward at the foot of the cliff but then disappeared at the baseof a sheer rock wall, and after that there was no way to go farther but toclimb. Several had fallen to their death. One, Fierce Einar, had climbed outsuccessfully but returned, embittered by what he had encountered at the top.He had quarreled with his father and climbed out on a winter night with a sackof his own belongings, and some he had stolen, tied to his back. When hereturned, climbing back in, it almost killed him, for he was maimed by then,bloody and in terrible pain. He dropped from the final rocks onto the snowy pathat the base, howling in agony and with a knowledge of failure. Then he fellsilent. He crawled to a place where he could pull down a narrow tree. Hestripped it of branches, broke the trunk into two pieces, and used them to haulhimself upright. Then he leaned on the sticks and dragged himself home to facehis father. He lost the title Fierce, and was renamed Lame Einar. Still onlyeighteen, still silent, he tended sheep now, and nursed a deep despair.The best route away from the village was by sea. But the ocean was turbulent andunpredictable, with dangerous currents and constant wind. Each fisherman hadfound himself in peril more than once, and all had lost friends or brothers.Alys, toothless and wrinkled though with piercing eyes and a sharp tongue, toldthe men roughly: “Leave us be!” when they carried the trembling creature in toher. She tended the girl through the night. Alys was childless herself but hadbeen midwife to many and was no stranger to damaged young. She stripped the girlof the drenched, ripped clothing, setting it aside, then rubbed her dry withrough cloth, and wrapped her in soft wool. She did all this in flickering lightfrom a smoky oil lamp. When the girl stopped shaking, Alys stirred theherb-flavored broth that had been simmering on the fire in an iron pot. Shepoured some into a bowl, and fed the girl from a spoon held carefully lest shethrust it away in her fear.But the girl sipped, wary at first, then opened her mouth for more.“Go slow or you’ll puke,” Alys told her.“What brung you?” she asked when the soup bowl was emptied. The girl’s headturned and she half rose, listening to the murmur of the sea, but she did notanswer and the old woman did not urge her. Instead, Alys found a comb carved ofbone on the shelf nearby, and began to unsnarl and smooth the wet,salt-stiffened hair.The wind howled through the thatch on the roof. It was deepest night now. Thegirl dozed, half sitting. Finally, Alys lowered her to the bed and pulled thelength of wool cloth up around her bare shoulders. She watched for a few momentsas the girl slept, her hair fanned about her head. Alys had always yearned for adaughter and felt that the sea had sent this one to her. After a bit she loweredthe flame in the lamp so that the hut was dim, with dark shadows on its walls.She wrapped her own self in a woven blanket, sank into a nearby chair, and slepttoo.In the morning the girl woke and wept softly. When she saw her clothing, allrags now encrusted with drying salt, she clutched the tatters, feeling theruined cloth with her fingers, and then relinquished it all, turning her face tothe wall. After a bit, with a resigned sigh, she took the coarse woven shiftthat Alys offered her, slipped it over her head, and stood. Her bare legs andarms were bruised and scraped; one ankle was badly swollen and she favored it,limping to the table where Alys had set a bowl of porridge.Her hair was red-gold, burnished copper in the early light of winter that camethrough the small window and fell over her as she ate. The day was fair, as itwas often after storms.“What brung you to this place?” Alys asked her again. “What carried you andthrew you to the storm?”But again the girl did not answer, though she stared at Alys with hergold-flecked eyes. She had a puzzled look.“Do you not understand our tongue?” Alys asked, knowing that the question wasfoolish, for if the answer were to be no, then the girl could not understand inorder to give it.“I am Alys.” The old woman pointed to herself. “Alys,” she said again, andpatted her own chest in explanation. “I have no child, none ever, but I havebirthed many among our women and few died in the birthing; they say I have thefirm hands and the feel for it, and I also lay out the dead and sometimes canheal if the sickness is not beyond healing.“That’s why they brung you to me, for they felt you needed healing, or if nothealing, then I would clean and wrap you for the grave.”The girl was watching her. Her bowl was empty, and she raised the cup of milkbeside it and drank deeply.From outside they could hear, suddenly, the giggles of children. Alys pushed awindow open, peered out, and called to them. “She’s alive! She eats and iswhole, with no parts broken. Go and tell. And stay off now till she’s restedgood! She don’t need the likes of you laughing and shouting about!”“What be her name?” a child’s voice called.“Go now! We’ll know her name soon enough, or give her one!” the woman called,and then there was the sound of the little ones scampering away.With her gnarled hand she smoothed the girl’s hair. “It’s just the curiositycomes on them. Them three little ones are always together—best friends, theyare. Delwyth, Bethan, and Eira be their names—I midwifed each one, same year.Six, they are, and full of the mischief, but they have good hearts and mean noharm.”Then the girl spoke. “My name is Claire,” she said."},{"pageContent":"TWOThey called her Water Claire.People came to Alys’s hut during the weeks that passed and brought gifts toClaire, knowing she had nothing of her own. They were a generous people, as arule. Gareth, his bald head and round cheeks pink with shyness, made shoes forher, leather sandals with straps that she fastened around her ankles over thickknitted socks when the swelling lessened and she could walk without pain. Bryn,the mother of little Bethan, stitched a linen petticoat and took the time toembroider flowers on its edge, a fanciful touch beyond the ordinary clothing ofthe people, but no one scorned Bryn for it, for the girl seemed worthy of such agift. Old Benedikt carved her a comb, which she carried in her pocket, and tothe surprise of everyone, since he was fierce in his anger and solitude, LameEinar came in from the sheep meadow, hobbling on his two sticks, and gave her ahat he had woven her from straw.As spring came, children brought her early wildflowers in small wilting bouquetsand they helped her weave the stems into the straw of the hat’s brim.She wore the brimmed hat to keep the sun from her eyes but even so needed tohold her hand there when she looked to sea because the light reflecting off thegray-white waves was blinding. She stood often on the shore with the windblowing her hair and molding her skirt against her legs. She watched the horizonas if she waited. But she had no knowledge of what she waited for. The sea haddrunk her memories away, leaving only her name.“How old do you be, Water Claire?” asked a half-grown freckle-faced boy namedSindri. He measured himself beside her and she was the taller. But she shook herhead, not knowing how to answer him. Alys was there; they were gathering herbs.“Sixteen year or so,” Alys said, telling Claire more than the boy. And they knewAlys to be true in her guess, for it was she who tended the bodies of them all,and knew the signs that each year brings.“Sixteen,” Water Claire repeated in her soft voice, and though she said no more,they knew that she was mourning the knowledge of the years that the sea hadgulped away. She watched the little girls at play, laughing as they ran throughthe meadow, quick and colorful as butterflies, but there was sadness in thewatching, for Claire’s meadow days had been taken from her. They did not comeback, even in dreams.“Sixteen?” Tall Andras repeated when he heard of it. The boy, Sindri, had toldeveryone, and most had shrugged. But Tall Andras rubbed his hand across histhick blond beard, looked across the marketplace to where Water Claire stoodfingering ribbons at a stall, and said to his mates, “She could be wed.”It was true that in this place there were often girls given as brides at thatage. Even now the village was preparing for a wedding; Glenys, shy andsparkle-eyed, would soon wed horse tender Martyn, she not yet seventeen and hebarely twenty. But Old Benedikt and Alys both said no. Not this girl. Not WaterClaire. She must not wed, they said firmly, until the sea gave her back what ithad stolen, until she knew what her life had once been.Tall Andras, frowning with disappointment, asked brusquely, “What if it neverdo?”“It will,” Old Benedikt replied.“Bits and pieces, they’ll come,” Alys said, “over time.”Tall Andras glowered. He had a fierce want for the girl. “The sea pukes up deadfish,” he said. “It won’t give her back anything. What the sea coughs up smellsof rot.”“You smell of sweat yourself, Andras,” Alys told him, laughing at his misery,“and should bathe if you want the girl to come close. Wash your hair and chewsome mint. Maybe then she’ll give you a smile some morning.”Tall Andras stalked away, but she could see that he was headed to the freshwaterpond beyond the thick trees at the edge of the village. Old Benedikt, watching,shook his head and smiled. “I told him she’ll come back to herself, but truly Idon’t know,” he told Alys. “It’s as if the sea sucked away her past and left herempty. What does she say to you?”“She remembers only waking in my hut. Nothing before. Not even being in thesea.”They walked together along the rocky path bordering a wide meadow, each of themwith a stick to lean on. Old Benedikt was strong still, but bent. Alys, too,walked with her back hunched. They had been friends for more than sixty years.Alys carried the basket she used for gathering herbs; she was in need ofraspberry leaf on this morning, to steep for tea to give Bryn. Since birthingBethan six years before, Bryn had lost three babies and had fallen into despair.Now she was again with child, and Alys would prepare the raspberry leaf infusionfor her to drink three times a day. Sometimes it tightened and held a pregnancy.“Is there no herb for memory?” Old Benedikt asked her as she leaned to strip theraspberry leaves from the thick thorned bushes where they grew.Alys chuckled. “Aye,” she told him. “Try this.” She reached to a nearby tree,peeled a tiny shred of bark, and placed it in his hand. “Chew, and think back.”Frowning, puzzled, Old Benedikt placed the shred on his own tongue. “Think backon what?”“On a time you choose. Far back.” She watched him.He closed his eyes and chewed. “Bitter,” he said, making a face.She laughed.After a moment he opened his eyes and spat the chewed bark from his tongue. “Ithought back to the day we danced,” he told her with a wry smile.“I was thirteen,” she said. “You were the same. A long way back. Was the memoryclear?”He nodded. “You had pink flowers in your hair,” he said.She nodded. “Beach roses. It was midsummer.”“And bare feet.”“Yours were bare too. It was a warm day.”“Aye. The grass was warm and damp.”“Dew,” he said. “It was early morning.” He looked at her for a moment. “Why werewe dancing?” he asked, his brow furrowed.“Mayhap you need to chew the bark again.” She chuckled. “To remember why.”“You tell me,” he said.Alys added the last of the raspberry leaves to her basket, straightened, took upher stick, and turned on the path. “Back to the hut,” she said. “My kettle’saboil, and I must steep the leaves.” She began to walk away from him.“Shall you take some of the bark for the girl? For Water Claire?” he asked.She turned back to him and crinkled a smile at him. “The bark does naught,” shesaid. “It’s only the turning your mind to it. Making your mind go back.“She’ll do that when she’s ready,” she added. “I must go now. Bryn is in need ofthe tea.”He called after her as she walked away on the path. “Alys? Why were we dancing?”“Take your mind there again,” she called back. “You’ll remember!”To herself, she murmured, shaking her head with amusement as her eyes twinkledat her own memory. “Only thirteen. But we was barefoot and flower-strewn andfoolish with first love.”"},{"pageContent":"THREEClaire was there, at the hut. With her coppery hair tied back by a ribbon, and acloth tied around her waist to protect her simple homemade skirt, she waschopping the long pale green stems of early onions fresh from the garden. Newlypicked greens lay heaped on the table with a thick mutton bone near them, readyto add to the pot of water that was already simmering over the fire. When Alysentered, she smiled.“I’m starting soup,” the girl said.“Aye. I see that.” Alys emptied her basket of raspberry leaves into a bowl.“I’ll just take some of the water first, for my brew.” With a ladle she slowlypoured hot water from the pot over the leaves. Steam rose as the leaves began tosteep and tint the liquid.“For Bryn?” The girl looked at the darkening tea.“Aye. To lose another will surely make her heartsick.”Claire leaned toward the bowl. As Alys watched, she closed her eyes and breathedthe steam. At her forehead, tendrils of hair curled from the moisture, framingher pale face. For a moment she stood there, motionless, breathing. Then shegasped, drew her head back, opened her eyes, and looked around with a puzzledgaze.“I cannot—” she began, then fell silent.Alys went to her and smoothed the damp hair. “What is it, child?” she asked.“I thought—” But the girl couldn’t continue. Moving tentatively, she sat down inthe nearby rocker and stared into the fire.Alys watched her for a moment. Then she went to the trunk against the wall.Unopened for years, it bore an iron clasp that was rusty and worn. But Alys’sstrong fingers pried it loose, and she raised the heavy, carved lid. Her fatherhad made this trunk for her mother almost a century before, a bride-gift whenthey were wed. It had come to Alys when her mother died. Her mother had storedthings in it: linens and baby dresses, sprinkled with dried lavender blossoms.None of those things remained, though the scent of the lavender lingered. Aliceused the trunk only for treasures, and there were few enough of those in herlife.Now she reached through the things within and took from near the bottom afragile bit of folded cloth. Holding it, she went to the rocker and said to thegirl: “Watch now.”Gently she unfolded the cloth and showed her bits of torn brown shreds. “Smell,”Alys told her, and held it to the girl’s nose.“Old,” Claire said. “Sweet.” She leaned back in the chair and sighed. “What isit?”“Beach roses from sixty years ago.”“Why—”“To hold memories. Scents do that. When you smelled the tea—”“Yes. For a moment something came back,” the girl acknowledged. “Like a bit ofbreeze. It drifted past. I couldn’t keep it with me. I wanted—” But she couldn’tsay what she wanted. She sighed and shook her head. “It went away.”“It’s waiting,” Alys said. Carefully she refolded the cloth around the driedpetals and leaves and replaced the little packet in the carved trunk. Then,while Claire watched, she strained the dark tea and poured it carefully intosmall bottles, which she corked tightly. “I’ll take this now to Bryn,” she said.“Add a raspberry leaf or two to the soup. And some of that sorrel from thegarden. It’ll give flavor,” she added. “Those greens you have give bulk, buttheir taste is ordinary.”Claire nodded. Alys watched as the girl pushed the chopped onions into a neatpile with the side of her hand.“Did you cook once, mayhap?” Alys asked.The girl looked up. She frowned and furrowed her brow. “I don’t think so,” shesaid, finally.“But something come back to you a minute ago,” Alys said, “when you breathed thetea.”Claire stood thinking. She closed her eyes. Then, finally, she looked up andshrugged. “It wasn’t the tea,” she said. “It came from something else, I think.”“You talk elegant,” Alys said with a chuckle. “Probably somebody done yourcooking for you, once.”Claire took a deep breath, still thinking. Then she picked up the stirring spoonand turned toward the pot of simmering soup. “Well,” she said, “those days aregone.” The three little girls, Bethan, Delwyth, and Eira, barefoot and grass-stained,smoothed and tidied the little corner of meadow that they called their TeaPlace. A flat rock there became their table; they decorated it with blossomsfrom the clumps of wildflowers nearby. With a leafy branch acting as a broom,Eira swept the ground around the rock. “Sit down, dear ladies,” she said. “Nowthat it’s tidy here, we’ll have tea.”It was a game they often played, serving imaginary tea to one another,pretending to be grown women.“Your hair’s a wee bit straggled, Miss Bethan,” Eira said haughtily as she setthe broom aside. “Was you rushed? I’d expect you’d be more primped up, and maybebrush some, when you’ve got a tea invite.”Bethan giggled and pulled at her unruly curls. “So sorry, Miss Eira,” she said.“This baby in my belly makes me forgetful.” Dramatically she pulled her frockaway from her own thin middle.“Can I have a belly baby too?” whispered solemn-eyed Delwyth.“Yes. Let’s all.” Eira tugged at her own skirt. “Oh, I do hope mine is bornsoon, because I’m so weary of being fat.”“Yes, fat is hard,” Delwyth agreed in a serious voice. “It makes you breathe allpuffy.“When do you expect yours?” she asked the others. “Mine’s coming tomorrow. I dohope for a boy. I’m going to name him . . .” She pondered briefly. “Dylan,” shedecided. “Tea?” Delicately she sipped from her own imaginary cup.“Oops!” Bethan announced. “Mine just be born. A little girl.” She cradled aninvisible baby in her arms.“Mine too!” The other two little girls announced. Rhythmically they rocked theirinvisible infants.“My mum be cross with me if she knowed we did this,” Bethan confided. “She saysit be bad luck to pretend about a baby.”Delwyth stopped her rocking motion. “Bad luck?”Bethan nodded.“Better we don’t do it, then. We can pretend tea, though.” Delwyth smoothed herskirt. “Want a teacake?” She offered the other girls each a twig.Eira pretended to chew. “You be a fine cook, Miss Delwyth,” she said.Delwyth nodded solemnly. “I learnt it from the queen,” she said, “when I be’d ahelper in her kitchen.” Claire, listening from where she stood in a small grove of trees nearby, smiledat the sweetness of the children. But their conversation troubled her, as well,because it reminded her of what she had lost. It was more than the loss ofmemories. She had no knowledge. She wondered what a queen might be. Had sheknown that once? Had she played this way, once?This baby in my belly makes me forgetful, one little girl had said. Claire,working now with Alys, preparing the herbs for Bethan’s mother, understood whatthe child was pretending. Why did it make Claire feel so unbearably sad?She straightened her straw hat and walked slowly back to the hut with the herbsshe had been sent to find and gather. She resolved that she would learn. Shewould learn everything—about queens, whatever they were; and herbs, and birds,and how the men farmed and what they thought, and the women, too, how they spenttheir hours, and what they talked about, what they dreamed, what they yearnedfor.It would be a start, Claire thought. Perhaps somehow she would learn her ownlost life. From a field higher up, where he was prying weeds from the rocky soil with hishoe, Tall Andras stopped his work, wiped sweat from his glistening forehead, andwatched the mysterious girl walk along the path. She had favored one leg forsome weeks, until the bruise and swelling disappeared. He had worried for her,that she might become hunched and lame, as people did when their wounds wentunhealed. Andras’s own father, flung years before against rocks when a boatswung around and tipped, still held one arm locked into a curved and crookedshape.But he could see that Water Claire strode easily now along the path, her legsstrong and equal, her feet sure in the soft leather sandals she wore. He watchedher make her way easily to the turning; then she disappeared into the woods,heading back to the hut she shared with Alys.A shadow crossed the ground in front of him, and Tall Andras looked up and wavedhis arm at the crows that circled the field. His weeding was turning up bugs andworms, morsels that the crows wanted, he knew, and it put his seedlings at risk.He couldn’t afford to lose the crops. Winter was long here, and in the goodweather seasons they prepared for it: growing, catching, storing things away.His father was getting old and his mother had been unwell for months, with feverthat came and went. Tall Andras was young, just seventeen, but the familydepended on him. He would make a bird-scarer, a mommet, he decided. Last summerthat had helped. And he had a large gourd in the shed that he could use for ahead, with a face carved on it: a fierce face. He twisted his own face,practicing, pushing his lips up against his nose, and then flapped his arms, theway the cloth of his mommet might flap in the wind to frighten away the crows.Then he stopped, feeling childish and foolish, and glad that the girl had notseen. For her, he wanted to seem a wise and hard-working man, worthy soon of awife."},{"pageContent":"FOURThey noticed that creatures frightened her. A chipmunk, tamed by the littlegirls, sat on Eira’s hand nibbling at the seeds they gave to it. But Clairebacked away with a startled look.“You never seen one before, then, Water Claire?” Bethan asked her. “They not beharmful.”“You can touch him,” Delwyth suggested. “He don’t mind.”But Claire shook her head no. She was fearful of the smallest of creatures—amouse, scurrying across the floor of Alys’s hut, almost caused her to faint—andfascinated in a worried sort of way with birds. She found frogs amusing butstrange. And she was completely, utterly terrified of cows. Claire held herbreath and looked away when she had to pass the place where a scrawny milk cow,its wrinkled mouth moving as it placidly chewed on the rough grass, was fencedbeside the cottage where Tall Andras lived with his parents.“I must try to learn creatures,” she said to Alys apologetically. “It’s notright to be so fearful. Even the smallest of the children feel at home with thecreatures.”“Mayhap you had a run-in with a creature once.” Alys was in the rocker, knittingwith gray wool in the dim, flickering light.Claire sighed. “I don’t know. But it’s not a feeling of a bad memory. It’s as ifI have never seen them before.”“Fish neither?”“Fish are familiar,” Claire said slowly. “I think I have known of fish somehow.They don’t frighten me. I like how silvery they look.”“Nary birds?”Claire shook her head and shuddered. “Their wings seem so unnatural. I can’t getused to them. Even the littlest ones are strange to me.”Alys thought, and rocked. Her wooden needles clicked in her gnarled hands.Finally she said, “Lame Einar has a way with birds. I’ll have him catch us one,for a pet.”“Pet?”“A plaything. A pretty. He’ll make a cage for it, from twigs.”Claire cringed at the thought, but agreed. It would be a start to the learning. One afternoon she stood barefoot on the beach, watching the trio of littlegirls. Using sticks, they had outlined a house and were furnishing it withdebris they found in the sand.“Here’s my bed!” Bethan announced, and patted an armful of seaweed into a shape.“And cups in the kitchen!” Eira set five scoop-shaped shells in a row. Shelifted one daintily and pretended to drink from it.Delwyth ran to fetch a branch she saw beside some rocks, and dragged it back.Torn from a nearby tree by the constant wind, it was crowned with a thicket ofleaves. “Broom! I found us a broom!” the little girl announced happily, andscraped the sand with it. “Wait. It needs fixing.” Carefully she tugged at athin side branch, broke it loose, and tossed it aside. “There. Now it’s a properbroom.”Claire, watching, leaned down and picked up the slender branch that Delwyth haddiscarded. The sand was damp and she saw her own footprints in it. With the tipof the branch, she poked a round hole in each of her own toeprints, then laughedand scribbled the footprints away with the stick. A gentle surge of seawatermoved in silently, smoothed the roughened sand, and receded.She leaned forward and wrote the first letter of her name.C.Then L. And A.But a foamy inrush of seawater erased the letters.Claire moved back slightly, farther from the sea’s edge, and began again.CLAIRE, she wrote.“What be that?” A shadow fell across her letters. It was Bethan, looking down.“My name.”The little girl stared at it.“Would you like to do your name beside it?” Claire offered her the stick.“How?” she asked.“Just make the letters.”“What be letters?”Claire was startled at first. Then she thought: Oh. They haven’t learned yet.She had a sudden image of herself, learning. Of a teacher, explaining the soundsof letters. There was a place she had gone, a place called school. All childrendid. But she looked around now, at the cliff and hills and huts, at the sea—shecould see the boats bobbing in the distance, and the men leaning in with theirnets—and she was uncertain.“Will you go to school soon?” she asked Bethan.“What be school?”She didn’t know how to answer the child. And maybe, she realized, it wasn’timportant. Six letters; they made a name. What did it matter? She looked againat the word she had written, then erased it with her own toes, stamped the sandfirm, and tossed the stick into a pile of glistening kelp nearby. Alys had sent Old Benedikt to ask the favor of Lame Einar. Not long after, slowon his ruined feet, the young man made his way laboriously down from his hut onthe hillside, carrying the twig cage on his back, with the bird inside.“Here it be,” he told Alys.Einar was not one for talking. His failures had made him a recluse, but peopleremembered the vulnerable boy he had once been. Though he had stolen from hisfather, they forgave him that; his father had been a harsh and unjust man. Thathe had climbed out, many admired, for the cliff was steep and jagged and theworld beyond unknown; few had the courage that Einar had had. They regretted hisfailure, but they welcomed his damaged return. Einar, though, had never forgivenhimself; he lived in self-imposed shame and stayed mostly silent.“It sings,” he said. He leaned his two sturdy sticks against Alys’s hut and hungthe cage on a tree branch near the entrance. He watched for a moment until thecarefully crafted perch inside stopped swaying and the little finch stilled thenervous flutter of its bright-colored wings. Then Lame Einar took up his sticksagain; he righted himself between them, for balance, and went slowly away.The bird was chirping when Claire returned from the beach, carrying her sandals.She stopped in surprise, looking at the cage and the bird within. “It can’t getout, can it?” she asked nervously.Alys laughed. “Were you to take it in your hand, child, it would tremble infear. Have you never been near to a wee bird before?”Claire shook her head no.“You’ll feed it each day. Seeds, mostly, and some of the bugs from the field.”“I don’t like the bugs,” Claire whispered.“It will help when you learn them. Fear dims when you learn things.”The bird chirped loudly, and Claire jumped. Alys laughed at her again.Claire took a breath and calmed herself. She went closer and peered into thecage. The bird tilted its head and looked back at her. “It should have a name,”Claire said.“Name it, then. It be yours.”“I’ve never named a single thing.”Alys frowned, and she looked at Claire with her squinted eyes. “Do you knowthat, then?” she asked.Claire sighed. “I feel it, that’s all.”“Naming is hard. Someone named you once.”Claire looked away. “I suppose,” she said slowly, and then turned her attentionagain to the cage. “Look! It cleans itself!” She pointed. The bird had raisedone wing and pecked fastidiously at its feathers beneath. “Isn’t that a lovelypatch of color on his wing?” She hesitated, then asked, “What is it called? Iknow red. You taught me red from the berries. It’s a pretty red there around hiseyes, but what is that bright color on his wing? I can’t think of its name.”Alys was troubled by this, for she knew by now that the girl was clever, andfilled with knowledge of many things. But she seemed lacking in so many ways,and the realm of colors was one. The names of the various hues were one of thefirst things small children learned. Yet when Alys had sent Claire on a simpleerrand some days ago, asking her to fetch some jewelweed, which Alys needed totreat a painful poison ivy rash on one of Old Benedikt’s grandsons, Claire hadnot known how to find the flower that grew in such profusion by the stream. “Thebright orange blossoms,” Alys reminded her. “We gathered some the other day.”“I forget orange,” Claire had said, embarrassed. “We gathered several thingsthat day. What does orange look like?”And now she could not name the color that decorated the wing of the littlesinging finch.“Yellow,” Alys told her. “The same as evening primrose, remember?”“Yellow,” Claire repeated, learning it. Yellow-wing became the bird’s name. On a cool foggy morning, she climbed the hill to find Lame Einar and thank him.It had taken a while to accustom herself to the bird, to end her fearfulnessaround it. But now it hopped to the side of the cage when she brought seeds toit in a little shell dish and waited, head cocked, while she set the dish down.It would have hopped onto her finger, she knew, if she had held it still andwaited. But she wasn’t ready for that, or for the feeding of live insects. Thelittle girls took on that task, happy to find beetles and hoppers in the grassand bring them to Yellow-wing.She found Einar near his hut. He was seated on a flat rock, cleaning a woodenbowl, scrubbing the cracks in the rounded poplar with a rag dipped in fire ash.Nearby, through the fog, she could hear the sheep move in the grass, and anoccasional bleat. She approached the young man. She was nervous, not to be withEinar, who was always silent and unknowable, but because of the sounds of theanimals.He was startled to see her, and lowered his eyes to the bowl. Had he heard hercoming, he would have fled into the fog and disappeared. But Claire had beensilent, appearing without warning from the swirling gray mist, and his maimedfeet made it impossible for him to jump and run.“Good morning,” she said, and he nodded in reply.“I came to thank you for the bird,” she told him.“It’s nought but a bird,” he muttered.Claire stared at him for a moment. A word came to her from nowhere. He’s lonely,she thought. People say he’s angry, and hermitlike, but it’s loneliness thatafflicts him.She looked around, and saw a log nearby. “May I sit down?” she asked politely.He grunted an assent and scraped some more at the spotless bowl in his hands.“I know it’s just a bird,” she told him, “but you see, I have been afraid ofbirds. They’re strange to me; I don’t know why. And so the little bird youbrought me—I call him Yellow-wing . . .”She saw his puzzled look and laughed. “I know. It’s just his color. But I’m onlylearning colors. They’re as strange to me as birds. And so it’s a help, to callhim Yellow-wing. I say his name when I put his dish of seeds in the cage. Andyou know what? He’s singing now. He was afraid at first, but now he sings!”Einar looked at her. Then he arranged his mouth, gave a small sound as a trial,and then reproduced the sound of the small bright-colored bird, with its trilland fluttering whistle.Claire listened in delight. “Could you do the songs of other birds?” she askedhim. But he ducked his head in embarrassment and didn’t reply. He set the bowlaside and reached for his sticks.“Sheep need me,” he said brusquely. He rose and moved with his awkward gait intothe edge of the foggy meadow. He was no more than a blurred outline when sheheard him call back to her. “Greens!” he called. “Not the color. But he needsgreens. Willow buds be good, and dandelion!”Then he was gone, but as she gathered herself to leave, she heard him whistlethe song of the bird once again. Alys and Old Benedikt stood watching the preparations for the marriage of Glenysand Martyn. Friends of the couple had built a kind of bower from supple willowbranches and now they were decorating it with blossoms and ferns. Beyond, ontables made of board and set outside for the occasion, the women were arrangingfood and drink.“It’s a fine day,” Alys commented, squinting at the cloudless sky.“I was wed in rain,” Old Benedikt said with a chuckle, “and never noticed a dropof it.”She smiled at him. “I remember your wedding day,” she said. “And Ailish, allsmiles. You must miss her, Ben.”He nodded. His wife of many years had died from a sudden fever the winterbefore, with their children and grandchildren watching in sorrow. She was buriednow in the village graveyard with a small stone marker marking her place, androom beside her for Old Benedikt when his time came.“Look there, at Tall Andras, watching the girl,” Old Benedikt said with achuckle, and pointed. “He’s bent near double with longing for her, isn’t it so?”They both watched with amusement as the young man’s lovesick gaze followedClaire, who was helping with the flowers. She hardly noticed him.“She puzzles me, Benedikt.”“Aye. She’s a mystery. But a splendid one!” While they watched, Claire liftedone of the little girls and helped her weave daisies into the twigs of thebower. The other little ones waited eagerly for their turns. “They follow herlike kittens after the mother cat, don’t they?”“Do you know she fears cats? Even kittens? As if she never see’d such before,”Alys told him.“And birds, I hear.”“Lame Einar caught a bird for her, and wove a cage for it. She’s learning tolike it now, for it sings nicely. But, Ben—?”“Aye?”“I had to tell her the colors of it. She don’t know the names! Yellow, and red:it’s as if they are new to her. And yet she’s clever! Clever as can be! Shecreates games for the little girls, and helps me with the herbs, but—”“I never knowed one who couldn’t say the colors. Not even one who is weak in themind, like Ailish’s nephew, who’s like a young boy though he’s thirty! Even hecries for his blue shirt instead of the green,” Old Benedikt said.“Not Water Claire. She may long for the blue but don’t know its name. She’slearning now. But she’s like a babe about it.”“So you’ve got you a wee babe to tend, after all these years without,” he teasedher.He patted her hip through her thick skirt, and she pushed his hand away. “Let mebe, you old fool,” she told him fondly."},{"pageContent":"FIVETell me about weddings,” Claire asked as she and Alys carried the nutcake theyhad made to the feast table, where it would be placed with the festive puddingsand sweets. “Does everyone have one? Did you?”Alys laughed. “Not me,” she said. “But most do, when they reach an age, asMartyn and Glenys. When they choose each other, and the parents say aye, then wehave the Handfasting. Always in summer, usually at new moon.”Summer. Claire had learned, already, from Alys that summer is a time of year,the time of sunshine and crops and the birth of young animals. It had been onemore thing she had not known.She waited while Alys rearranged some of the other foods in order to make room.Then she set down their cake and together they decorated its edge with yellowdaisies.The village people were gathering. No one, not even the fishermen, was at worktoday. Babies perched atop their fathers’ shoulders. Claire saw Tall Andras withhis parents, the three of them scrubbed and dressed in their best clothing. Shecould see that his mother was not well; she leaned on her son, and was flushedwith fever, though she smiled and greeted the others.Bryn waved to Claire. She was holding Bethan’s hand. For once the three littlegirls were separate, each with their families. Claire could see that beneath herlace-trimmed apron, Bryn’s body had thickened with the coming child. Alysthought the time of danger was past and that this one would survive.“Oh! What’s that?” Claire asked, startled at a sound. From the path, severalyoung village men approached and the crowd opened to make way for them. One wasblowing into a carved flute. Another kept time on a small drum made from ananimal skin stretched across a hollowed gourd. The third plucked at stringsstretched across a long-necked instrument made of wood. Moving in time with themelody, they entered the circle that had opened to admit them as Claire watchedfrom where she and Alys stood at the edge.“It’s so lovely! Listen! How they make the sounds go together! I’ve never heardanything like that before!”Alys frowned. “It’s music, child. Have you never heard music? Have you forgottenit?”“No, never,” Claire whispered. “I’m quite sure.” The Handfasting ceremony ended as Martyn and Glenys kissed each other, and thered ribbon that had been wound around them unfurled, loosened, and freed them.The musicians began again, with a louder, rollicking tune, and the villagerscheered and turned to the waiting feast.Claire stood silent, awed by the music, puzzled by the concept of love, andmoved by both the solemnity and the celebration of the occasion. When she turnedto look through the noisy, laughing throng for Alys, she suddenly noticed LameEinar standing alone on a small rise at the edge of the meadow. While shewatched, he adjusted the two sticks that supported him, turned, and hobbledslowly away. For a moment she thought of running over to invite him back, toentice him to join in. But her attention was drawn by the music. Never had sheheard such an enticing thing as music, she was sure of it! And now the villagerswere choosing partners, forming lines, and moving in time to the cheerfulmelody. Surely Einar would enjoy watching, even if he couldn’t do the quickhopping steps that they all seemed to know. They could watch together. But whenshe looked back for him, it was too late. He had disappeared into the woods. Back to daily tasks after the excitement and holiday of the Handfasting, TallAndras knelt in the field and meticulously tied together the thick branches thatwould form the body of the mommet. Then, after he had decided on a spot, in thecenter of the young, sprouting crops, he pushed the main branch into the earthand patted the dirt firmly around its base so that it stood upright withouttilting. He dressed it, carefully fitting the wide sleeves of a ragged coat overthe two stick arms. He tied a sash around the middle to hold the coat closed,but loosely, so that the breeze would lift and sway the fabric. He stood backand watched with satisfaction as the cloth moved. The ends of the arm branches,extending from the sleeves, looked like beckoning, skeletal hands.Claire, approaching on her way to the stream, watched with a smile. Sheunderstood what he was doing, though she had never seen a mommet before. Shestopped, watched, then called to Andras: “Do you have a ribbon? If you added along ribbon, it would wave in the wind.”He shook his head.“I’ll bring you one, if you like,” she suggested, coming closer.He stood back and looked at his creation. “A ribbon would be good,” heacknowledged, “around the neck.”Claire laughed. “The neck?” she asked. There was only the gnarled branch endprotruding upward from the patched coat.Andras laughed as well. “I’ll make the head now,” he told her, and showed herthe large gourd waiting on the ground. He knelt beside it and with his knifecarved a hole at one end. He dug out several inches of the pulpy flesh within,then placed the gourd atop the neck, fitting it down so that it sat firm. Clairecould see that it looked, indeed, like a head, and that from a distance theentire mommet would seem a frightening, flapping creature. The crows wouldsurely avoid it and the crops would be protected.He lifted the yellow gourd off the neck and set it on the ground again. “Itneeds a face,” he told her.She sat on the soft earth and watched him begin to carve. First he gouged twocircles near each other in the center of the gourd, then scraped at the rindbetween and below the eyes, to create the impression of a nose.Impulsively Claire tore some handfuls of grass from the earth and handed them tohim. “Hair,” she said.He laughed and draped the hair over the gourd. It slid away and he lookedaround. “Wait,” he told her. “I can make it stay.” He left her with the gourdlying on the ground and went over to the edge of the woods. As she watched, hefound the pine tree he had in mind, and pulled a length of one supple branchloose. “Oh, aye,” he murmured. “This is good.” He brought it back to where shewas sitting and showed her the wetness from the torn end, where the barkglistened. He held it for her to sniff the woodsy pine scent.“Alys makes a pillow filled with the needles,” she told him.He nodded. He was smearing the oozing resin on the gourd. “Aye, it soothes thesleep,” he said. “Look now!” He picked up the torn grass and pasted it on thegourd’s head, where it settled in tufty clumps, held tight by the sticky sap.They both laughed as he held it up. “Some mommet!” Andras said with pride.“Needs a mouth,” Claire reminded him. She pictured a grin on the odd creature.“Aye, it does.” He bent over it, carving meticulously. She watched as he worked.Now and then he drew back, examined his own efforts, and then leaned forward tocorrect the shape, to trim the curves. She saw him smooth the mouth edges withhis finger. He flicked away some tiny shreds of gourd.“May I see?” she asked him.“Wait.” He moved his blade to the expanse of yellow rind above the gouged eyes,and she could see him make three deep rippled cuts across the broad forehead. Helooked at it and laughed in delight. “There!” he said. He stood, holding it, andplaced it carefully over the wooden neck, easing it down into place.“There!” he said again proudly, and turned with a grin to see her reaction.Claire stared. The grotesque face stared back at her. Its forehead was wrinkledby the wide cuts, which made it looked puzzled, and the eyes squinted above thetwisted nose. The mouth was a tortured smile, a leer. She caught her breath andfelt her heart pound. Andras was laughing. She turned to him, horrified, notknowing why, and cheerfully he twisted his own face into a mimicry of themommet. He thrust his tongue into his cheek, wrinkled his nose and creased hisforehead. He made a chortling sound.The skewed face, the laughter with it, made something flood into Claire’smemory, surging upward in her like a wave about to break. She had made that faceonce, and thought it funny. Someone had made it back to her. But why? Who? Shepulled herself upward from the place where she had been sitting in the grass socheerfully a moment before. She felt sick, suddenly, and began to cry.“I’m sorry,” she gasped. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry—”Then she turned and ran, sobbing and breathless, down the hillside as TallAndras stood uncomprehending beside the wretched, ragged stick figure with itsbulbous head. High above him, two crows wheeled in the sky and cried out. Alys had been busy sorting and separating her dried plants when Claire burstthrough the door, her face wet with tears, and threw herself onto the bed. Itwas clear that this was not a thwarted romance or a quarrel with a friend, theusual cause for the weeping of young girls. This was raw and deep. The old womanpoured steaming water from the kettle over a few pinches of blue vervain andchamomile, then put the mug of herbal tea into Claire’s hands. She watched withconcern as the girl sat huddled and shaking in the dim light of the hut.“Something’s come back, then,” Alys said. “Something cruel.”Claire nodded. She took a few shuddering breaths and sipped the soothing drink.“It helps to say it,” Alys suggested.Claire looked up at her. “I can’t,” she said. “It was so close! It was there, soclose! And I can feel it, still, but I can’t grasp what it is.”“What brung it? Where be you, when it come so close?”“Over on the hillside, with Andras. I was helping him build a stick figure tofrighten the crows away.”“A mommet.”“Yes. That’s what he called it.”“Tall Andras is a good lad. Surely it was nothing he done?”Claire hesitated. “I don’t think so. I can’t remember, exactly. We werelaughing, and then—well, everything changed. I can’t think why.”“Something brung it. Want I should ask Andras?”Claire closed her hands around the mug and breathed the tea’s steam. “I don’tknow.” She whispered, after a moment, “I feel so sad.”Alys watched her, and knew that the herbs in the mug would soothe the panic thathad afflicted her, that soon she would calm and likely sleep for a bit. But theywould not heal her. It would be hard to heal a girl as desperately wounded asthis one."},{"pageContent":"SIXThe good-weather days continued. The sun turned the wave tips to sparklingjewels, and the fishermen filled their nets each day with their glisteningcatch. In Tall Andras’s field the mommet flapped its loose fabric arms and thecrows, made timid by it, called out harshly and went to other fields, othercrops. The gourd head began to rot in the sun and collapse upon itself, oozingand purple like a bruise. A bold starling swooped and grabbed some of thebrowning grass that had been its hair. One day it fell sideways into the field.When Claire walked past on her way to gather herbs, she saw only the toppled,ruined remains. The memory it had brought her was no longer there.Andras’s mother, Eilwen, weakened and no longer left her bed. Alys tended herthere, holding her head so that she could sip warm liquid made from chopped wildsunflower roots simmered in spring water. The medicine eased her cough. But itwas a comfort, not a cure. “She’ll not live,” Alys told Claire.Claire had learned about death already in her time here, for they had buried anold fisherman earlier, and she had helped Alys wash and wrap the gaunt bodybefore his sons lifted it into the box they had built. The fisherman’s death hadbeen sudden, though, in his sleep. Now Claire watched, day by day, as Eilwendrifted in her mind, woke less often, and seemed to shrink. Finally, early oneevening, with Andras and his father there, her breath slowed and stopped.The father and son touched her forehead gently as a goodbye and went away.Alys squeezed cloths that she lifted from the pail of water, handed one toClaire, and together they began to wash the thin body. Clean wrappings werefolded nearby, waiting.“The day they brung you from the sea,” the old woman said, “I washed you likethis.”“Did you think I would die?”Alys shook her head. “I could see you was strong. You fought me some.” Shechuckled softly as she patted Eilwen’s arm dry and laid it back gently on thebed.“I don’t remember.”“No, you wasn’t yourself yet. It was your sleep self what fought me.”“Here.” She handed Claire a dry cloth and together they dried and tidied thedead woman, folding her arms finally across her gaunt chest. Alys brushed herthin hair and they carefully wrapped her. They could hear the two men movingoutside, readying the box.“They’ll be needing a woman here,” Alys said, glancing around the crude hut. Thecooking vessels were unwashed and a blanket thrown across a chair was stainedand in need of mending.“Yes,” Claire agreed. “Men don’t tend houses well, do they?”“Tall Andras is of an age to wed,” Alys said pointedly.Claire shrugged. “He should, then.”“It’s you he wants.”Claire knew it to be true. She blushed. “I’m not of a mind to wed,” shemurmured.Alys didn’t hear, or pretended not to. “He’ll want sons.”“All men do, I expect.” It was something Claire had observed, in the village.Sons carried on the outside work; they took on the boats and the fields as theirfathers grew old.Alys busied herself with tying the cords that held the wrappings firmly in placearound Eilwen’s remains. Claire, silent now, helped her. She thought how proudEilwen must have once been, to have birthed a strong boy like Andras.They sat back. Their work was finished. In a moment they would call the men,father and son, to lift the woman into her coffin. The village would gather inthe morning to place it in the earth.“On that day, the day I tended you,” Alys said to Claire, “I saw your wound.”“Wound?”“Your belly.”Claire placed her hand there protectively. She looked at the ground. “I don’t—”she began, then faltered.“It’s a grievous wound. Someone tended it, stitched it up. There are the marks.”“I know,” Claire whispered.“One day it will come back to your mind, like everything else.”“Perhaps.”“But I fear this: that you will not be able to give birth. I think it has beentaken from you.”Claire was silent.Alys leaned forward and turned the flame higher in the oil lamp. It wasdarkening outside. “There are other ways a woman finds worth,” she said in afirm, knowing voice.“Yes.”“Come. We’ll bring the men inside to be with her now.”They rose and went out into the evening where Tall Andras and his father waitedin a light rain, their faces resigned. In her mind, Claire made a list of what was new to her.Colors, of course. She was grateful for knowing them now: the red ofhollyberries, and the red ribbon of the Handfasting—she marveled at the vibrancyand vigor of it. And she had come to feel bathed in contentment when the sky wasblue, as it was on these late-summer days. Sometimes the sea was quiet and blueas well, but most days it churned dark gray-green, with spumes of white blownand dissolved in the air. Claire liked that darkness as well, with itsrelentless motion and mystery, though she blamed the sea for hiding her past inits depths.Yellow she loved for its playfulness. Yellow-wing, her little bird, came to herfinger now when she poked it between the twigs that formed his cage. He hoppedonto it and tilted his head at her with a questioning look. She wondered why shehad ever been so frightened of birds.They were added to her list of newly learned things: birds, and animals of allsorts. She still skirted the cow uneasily when she walked past, but she hadbecome fond of Lame Einar’s sheep, especially the small ones, who frolicked inthe tall meadow grass and showed their pink tongues when they bleated inexcitement.Einar told her of wolves, but she had not seen one and did not want to, ever.She took joy in butterflies and scolded the little girls for catching them.“You’ve ruined it now,” she said, looking sadly at the crumpled spotted wings inBethan’s outstretched hand. “It deserved to live, and to fly.” Together theyburied the dead creature, but later she saw the child chasing another.She feared bees, and most bugs.“You’re like a wee child,” Alys said to her, laughing when Claire backed awaynervously from a fat beetle on a bush where they were gathering large leaves ofgoldenseal. Infusion of goldenseal eased the sore throat that sometimesafflicted fishermen after long days in the boats.“I’ve just never seen them before,” Claire explained, as she had often, of somany things.Her list included lightning, which astonished her; thunder, which terrified her;and frogs, which made her laugh aloud. A rainbow one morning made her almostfaint with delight and surprise."},{"pageContent":"SEVENClaire joined in the harvesting at the end of summer, and the rejoicing after.The crops were brought in and stored, and in the fields the birds picked at thestrewn leavings. Apples were ripening still, but the early ones were picked andpressed into cider.She could see that the days were shorter now. In summer the children had playedbarefoot into the evening, chasing one another until their shadows grew long.The men fished until there were stars, and still the sky did not darken untilthey brought their catch ashore. Now, though, the air turned brisk late in theafternoon. The sun seemed to topple down to the edge of the horizon and coloredit crimson there until it was gulped by the sea and gone. The wind rose then,taking the brown leaves in a whirl from the trees, and smoke wafted from thechimneys of cottages as fires were fed. The smoke carried with it the scent ofsoups and stews: nourishment for chilly nights. Women unraveled the sweaterstheir children had outgrown. They rolled the yarn and started again with it,forming new patterns, bright stripes, in larger sizes. Nothing was wasted. Boyscarved buttons from bone.Tall Andras gave Claire a fringed shawl that had been his mother’s. Most dayswere still sunlit and warm, but in the evenings she wrapped the soft shawlaround her. Lame Einar, seeing how she tied the ends to fasten it closed,created a clasp from willow twigs that he’d soaked to soften and then twistedinto a curled design. Carefully he attached the two pieces to the green shawland showed her how to fit them into each other and hold the thick fabric tighttogether.She noticed one morning, early, that her breath was visible in the cold, clearair. “Like mist,” she said to Alys.“Steam,” Alys replied.They were on their way to the cottage at the edge of the woods where Bryn livedwith her fisherman husband and their little girl. Bethan had burst into theirhut just before daybreak, shivering with the cold because she had forgotten hersweater, and breathless with excitement.“My mum’s pains have begun and my dad says come because he wants no part in it!”“Run back, child, and tell her we’ll be there shortly.” Alys spoke in a calmvoice while she rose, prodded the fire, and reached for her clothing.“You’ll come too, won’t you, Water Claire?” Bethan begged. Claire had sat up andyawned.“I will. Go tell your dad he’s a big baby himself.” Claire knew Bethan’s father,that he was gentle and loving. But men were not good at this.The little girl giggled. Claire swung her bare feet to the floor and winced atthe cold. She reached for the knitted socks that Alys had made for her. “Go now!Scat!” she said, and Bethan, gleeful, left the hut and scampered back along thelane.Yellow-wing, whose cage had been brought inside at the end of summer, shifted onhis perch and chirped. Alys rolled a leaf tightly and slipped it between thebars for him to nibble. Claire finished dressing. She fastened her leathersandals over the warm socks and watched as the old woman gathered things fromthe shelves in the corner. Suddenly, watching, she shuddered.“Why do you need a knife?”Alys placed the knife carefully beside the corked containers of herbalinfusions. She rolled them all in a soft leather skin and placed the bundleinside her bag. She added a large stack of clean folded cloths to the bag andpulled its drawstring tight.“Some say it eases pain to lay a knife beneath the bed.”“Is it true?”Alsy shrugged. “Likely not. But if the person thinks it, then the thinking easesthe pain.” She wrapped her thick knitted shawl around her and hefted the bagover her shoulder. “And I need the knife for the cord.”Claire pulled her own shawl tight and fastened it with the willow clasp.“Bring the lamp,” Alys told her.Together they hurried along the path. Claire held the lamp high and it madetheir way easier. But the sky itself was lightening now. The moon was a thinsliver against the gauzy gray of earliest morning. Bryn’s child would be adaylight baby.They could see when they arrived that Bethan in her excitement had dashed aboutin the shadowy dawn and wakened her friends. Now all three little girls, stillin their sleeping garments, were giggling nervously in the small room where Bryngroaned and twisted on the bed. Alys firmly shooed them back outdoors.“Don’t come back till the sun is full up. And then you come with your armsfilled with flowers from the meadow, to welcome the babe.”“They’ll find some dried asters still,” she told Claire, “and late goldenrod.And it will keep them out from underfoot.”The coming baby’s father was nowhere in sight. Alys had told Claire that menwere frightened by birthing.She had watched Lame Einar, though, help his ewes to bear young in early spring.He was both firm and gentle with them, and unafraid. Einar hadn’t minded thatshe stood watching when she came upon the scene. It was the first time she hadever seen him smile, when he unfolded the damp legs of a newborn and set itwobbling on its feet so that it could nudge its mother for milk.“They don’t really need me,” he told her gruffly. “They can birth alone unlessthere’s trouble.”“But it’s nice you’re there to help,” Claire said.Einar had shrugged, patted the rump of the nursing ewe, and reached for hissticks to hobble away. Claire watched him for a moment after he turned his back.Then she too walked on.But that had been months before. The spring lambs were tall now, playful, andthick with wool. Einar was no longer so shy with her. Once he startled her bymaking a harsh cackling sound, suddenly, and then a series of soft clucks. Shelooked at him in surprise.“You asked me once could I do other birds. That’s a pheasant,” he explained.Then he looked up at something very large, soaring above the sea. He gave along, hoarse call. “Black-backed gull,” he said.Now he let her help when he gathered the sheep in for the evening. Together theycounted. He had never lost one to wolves, he told her, and was proud of that. Heloved the new lambs.“Wash the knife,” Alys directed her, and her thoughts returned to the cottage,where Bryn gasped and gathered herself now as the child emerged. Claire saw itwas a girl. She heard it cry as she turned and dipped the knife into the waterthat simmered on the fire. The blade was hot when she wiped it carefully drywith a clean cloth.“Don’t cut Bryn!” she implored suddenly.Alys frowned at her. “No need to cut the mother,” she said brusquely.She knotted a string around the pulsing cord. The baby waved a fist in the airand wailed. “Sun’s rising,” Alys said to Bryn. “And you’ve got you a fine girl.”She waited a moment, then reached for the knife that Claire held, took it, andseparated the newborn from its mother with a careful cut.Bryn was watching wearily, and smiling. Suddenly Claire stepped forward withoutthinking, toward the baby that Alys was wrapping now in a cloth, and cried out,“Don’t take it from her!”Alys frowned. “Take what? What’s troubling you, girl?”“Give Bryn her baby!”Alys looked puzzled. She leaned forward and placed the swaddled infant in Bryn’sarms. “And what did you think I was to do, child? Put it out for the wolves? Ofcourse it goes to its mum. Look there. Wee as she is, she knows what to do.”Like the lamb wobbling forward to suckle, Bryn’s baby turned its head againstits mother’s warm skin and its mouth opened, searching. Claire stared at it.Then she began to sob, and stumbled out of the cottage into the dawn. Behindher, Alys, her face folded into puzzlement and concern, began to replace herbirthing tools into the woven bag. The new mother dozed while her tiny daughternuzzled and sucked. Outside, in the distance, the little girls were moving aboutin the gradually lightening meadow, their arms filled with flowers. But forClaire, who stood on the path weeping, the sunrise, perhaps all sunrises tocome, was ruined by memory and loss."},{"pageContent":"EIGHTHaltingly, pausing to weep, Claire told her remembered story to Alys.Astonished, the old woman asked to examine her scar. Her gnarled hands touchedthe raised pink flesh and followed the map of it with one finger.“Aye,” she said, “this is what I saw the day you came, and I knew you’d had aterrible wound. But never did I see until now that it’s the size to remove achild. Imagine: to cut a woman like that! Or a girl! You was just a girl! Thepain would have been so fierce. It would have killed you.”“No,” Claire explained. “I felt nothing when they cut. Before, there waspain—like what Bryn had, with the squeezing of the baby. But when they cut, Ifelt only pressure. The pushing of the knife. No pain.”Alys shook her head as if in disbelief. “How could that be, then?”“There were special medicines. Drugs. They took away pain.”“White willow brings relief,” Alys murmured. “But not for cutting! We have noherbs for that.”“I felt nothing.”“And what of the blood?” Alys again touched the scar. Her finger, its knucklebent and thickened by age, ran the length of the wound. “I’ve seen wounds likethis. A fisherman caught and ripped apart by the gaff. A hunter clawed and tornopen by an animal. I’ve been called to tend them. But I can do nought but tosoothe and comfort. The blood pulses away and they die from it—from the bloodand the pain. They scream from the pain and then weaken as the blood flows.Their eyes die first.” The old woman’s own eyes seemed to look into thedistance, thinking of the terrible things she had seen and could not heal.Claire looked down, herself, at the scar. “I couldn’t see. My eyes werecovered.” She shuddered a bit, as the memory of the mask came to her. “But Ifelt them cut. And you’re right: of course there must have been blood. They hadtools, I think, to deal with that. I remember a small sound—”She thought, and then tried to reproduce it. “Zzzzt! And I smelled a burningsmell. I think it . . .”Alys, puzzled, waited for her to continue.Claire sighed. “They had something that we don’t have here. Electricity. It’shard to explain. I think they had an electric tool that burned and sealed theblood vessels. Zzzzt. Zzzzt.”Alys nodded, as if it made sense to her. “I burn a wound, sometimes, or asnakebite. I use a firestick. To kill the poison. Not for bleeding, though. Notfor a huge wound like this one.”Claire drew her clothing across the scar, covering it, and the two of them sattogether in silence, one with her new and troubling memories, the other puzzlingover what had happened to the girl, and why.“I must find him,” Claire whispered, finally.“Aye. You must.”“How?”Alys stayed silent. She told Bryn. Watching the woman hold and tend her infant one afternoon, Claireconfided in her and described the return of the memories. Bryn listened withshock and sorrow. She clutched her own baby tighter as Claire answered herhorrified questions. Neither of them was aware that just outside the cottage,beside the door that had been left partly open for fresh autumn air, the littlegirls, wide-eyed, were listening.They scampered away to tell others. “A terrible secret,” Bethan called it,enjoying the attention she received as she retold the embellished story. WaterClaire had had a baby! Yes, young as she was! No, no husband at all. And theytook the baby from her—just stole it away, and she never saw it since!The secret was murmured throughout the community. Older women lowered their eyesin sympathy; many of them had lost children in cruel ways and they knew whatstrong, lasting grief came with such a loss. Younger ones, jealous of the prettystranger, tossed their heads in judgment. No husband! Wanton thing! We suspectedsomething like that! So she was tossed out of where she lived!Glenys, who had welcomed Claire’s attentions at the handfasting ceremony inearly summer, now smoothed her skirt smugly over her newly rounded belly. “I’llhave Alys come to midwife me when my time comes,” she said with a toss of herhead, “but I don’t want her.” Tall Andras, his face set in hard lines, turned away when he saw her.“Is something wrong?” Claire asked him, puzzled by his cold look. He had alwaysbeen so friendly.“Is it true, what they say?”“Who? And what is it they’re saying?”“Everyone. That you’ve had a child. And no husband.”Claire stared at him. The knowledge was still so new to her that it seemedsecret. She had yet to think it all through. It was still fragments, some of it,though from describing it to Alys she remembered the birth now, clearly and withhorror. But child? She had no sense, yet, of a child. Only something small andnewly birthed.“It was different, where I lived. There weren’t weddings. And yes, I gavebirth.” She found herself speaking tersely to him. She was angered. “You can’tunderstand. I was selected to give birth. It was an honor. I was calledBirthmother.”He raised his chin and looked at her with a kind of contempt. “You live here,now. And you’re stained.”“Stained? What are you talking about?”“Women who couple in the field, like animals. They have a stain to them. No onewants them, after.”Oh. Now she understood what he meant. She had watched the sheep mating. Einarhad had to explain it to her, how it created the lambs. He had laughed, findingit strange that she knew nothing of the process.“That has nothing to do with me,” she told Andras defiantly.“Or with me,” he said coldly. He turned his back and resumed his stacking ofwood. Claire watched for a moment, then continued striding on, but her morningwas tainted by the encounter. Later, troubled, she told Alys of it while theywere having lunch.“It’s the way here,” Alys explained. “Foolish, mayhap. But it has always beenso. Girls must come to the Handfasting untouched, or pretend to be. Otherwise. . .”“Otherwise no one wants them?”Alys shrugged, and chuckled. “People learn to overlook. Sounds to me as ifAndras was hopeful to have you. He’ll overlook, with time, if you don’t remindhim.”“Hmmppph.” Claire stood. She fed a piece of spinach to Yellow-wing, who hoppedhappily back and forth on his perch. Then she scraped the leavings from theplates into the bucket. “I don’t care about Andras. And I never wish to wed. Youdidn’t,” she pointed out.Alys grinned. “I was a willful girl,” she said.“Willful?”“Some said wild.” Now Alys laughed aloud. “And wanton.”Claire found that the laughter was making her own anger subside. Looking atAlys, wrinkled and bent, it was hard to imagine her as a willful, wild girl. Butin the unrestrained laughter Claire could hear a hint of the carefree creatureshe must once have been.The children, curious about what seemed a mystery (for people spoke of it inwhispers) but too young to judge her, were open with their questions to Claire.They were on the beach, gathering driftwood to dry for the fireplace. The windwas sharp and snapped at Claire’s skirt.“Did it grow in your belly, like my mum’s?” Bethan asked.Claire nodded, resigned to their knowing. She added a bent stick to the pile.“Were it a boy?” Delwyth’s eyes were wide.Claire nodded again. “Yes,” she said. “A male.” She startled herself. Why hadshe called it that? Everyone knew a baby was either a girl, like Bethan’s newsister, or a wee boy. Why had she said that odd word, male, as if she had givenbirth to a creature of woods or fields?“Where did it go, then, your male?” Solemn little Eira looked worried. “Who tookit?”Claire smiled to reassure the child. “Someone else needed it,” she explained.“Just as your mum needs these pieces of wood! Let’s drag that big one over hereand see if we’re strong enough to break it, shall we?”“I’m strong!”“Look at me, how strong I am!”“As strong as a boy! As a male!”The children strutted and shouted as they ran about in the wet sand. Claireglanced toward the high bank that bordered the beach and saw Einar watching. Hebalanced a wooden yoke across his wide shoulders, and two buckets hung levelfrom either side. He was coming from the spring where he got fresh water. Withhis shoulders bearing the weight, he was able still to use his walking sticks.Now, seeing her watching, he lifted one hand and waved to her.Claire waved back, and smiled. So, she thought, there’s one young man whodoesn’t think me stained. Or is it that I’m now ruined, as he is?She watched him make his way along the path, his feet dragging, one after theother. Beside her, in the sand, the laughing children imitated Einar, draggingtheir feet and limping dramatically, and then watching the furrowed ruts theymade fill with seawater and smooth over."},{"pageContent":"NINEWinter descended suddenly, with bone-chilling cold. The damp, raw wind swept infrom the ocean and entered through cracks in the walls of the hut. It made thefire flicker and hiss. Claire wore a thick furred vest that Alys has stitchedfor her from an animal hide, and warm boots from the same hide, laced withsinew.She accompanied Alys one morning to Bryn’s cottage, where the baby girl, nownamed Elen, was swaddled in layers of woven cloth and warmed in her cradle bywrapped stones made hot in the fire. Alys chuckled after listening to the shrillcry of the infant. “Summer babies fare better,” she told Bryn. “But this onesounds to be strong.”Bryn poured tea into thick mugs. Outside the wind blew, and on the floor nearthe fire little Bethan, humming tunelessly, sorted acorns into families. Claireexcused herself and slipped away.Outside, she wrapped her shawl tightly over the fur vest and pulled her thickknitted hat down to protect her ears. She started up the hill, following thedeserted path as it wound among the wind-tossed trees. No one was about. Thecold weather was keeping people indoors. But perhaps, she thought, Einar wouldbe in the meadow, tending his creatures, and would welcome her company.Climbing, she held her mittened hands to her mouth and breathed into them forwarmth. Her feet slipped now and then on mud frozen to ice. It was hard for Claire to understand seasons. Her returning memory had told hernothing of the way the leaves in summer showed their undersides as a stormapproached, then withered and dropped when the nights were chill. Now there wasthe cold, and she could not remember it. She had never had a coat before, orshawl, she was sure of that. And rain! It had been new to her in summer, andnow, with the cold, it was mixed with spits of ice, and who was to guess whatmight follow! Each day came as a surprise, though Alys, realizing, tried toprepare her and explain.Claire knocked at the door of the wood-slatted shed where Lame Einar lived, butthere was no answer. She pushed the door open, peeked in, and saw that the ashesof his fire were still hot; wisps of smoke drifted from the chimney anddisappeared with the wind into the gray sky. He would be up in the field, sheknew. She closed the door tight, pulled her shawl closer around her, and climbedthe path.She found him rubbing salve into the leg of a sheep that had caught itself in athorny bush.“Here—help hold him still, would you? He keeps pulling away.”Claire wrapped her arms around the neck of the impatient creature and tried tosoothe him by murmuring meaningless sounds. “Shhhh, shhhh,” she said, as she hadheard Bryn whisper to the baby when she cried. She leaned her head against thematted fleece of the sheep’s neck. It felt like a pillow, though its smell wasstrong.“There.” Einar released the leg, and the sheep shook itself and pulled loosefrom Claire’s grasp. It bounded away through the high, dry grass, and she couldhear the nasal bleats of greeting from its flock.He looked at her and said, “You’re cold.” Claire laughed at him because he hadsaid the obvious. She was shivering, and breathing again into her own cupped,mittened hands. “Come down to my shed,” he told her. He looked out over theflock, saw that they were huddled together, heads hunched low, out of the sleet.Then he went down the path and she followed.She sat on the heap of skins that he used for sleeping while he poked the ashesinto a red glow and then added a thick piece of oak branch. She could feel thewarmth expand.“Tell me why you’ve come out on a foul day like this,” he asked her.She hesitated, uncertain how he would react. Finally she said carefully, “Theytell me you climbed out, once.”He glanced over, then turned back to the fire and rearranged it a bit, though itseemed to Claire unnecessary. She thought that perhaps he simply needed to lookaway.“Aye. I did,” he acknowledged. “Do you want to know the why of it?”“The how. I want to know the how. I look at the cliff and it looms there,unclimbable.”Einar sighed. He rose with an effort from where he knelt on the ground, thenmoved over to sit beside her on the skins. They both stared at the fire.“I best tell you the why, first, so you understand.”Claire nodded, knowing she would need to tell him her own why when the timecame.Spatters of sleet tapped against the roof of the shed. But they were warminside.“I never knew my mum,” he began. “She died when she birthed me. Alys came, theysaid, and helped, but I was big and she labored too long, and bled, and shedied. It happens sometimes.”Claire nodded. Alys had told her that it did. She remembered how interested Alyshad been, hearing her tell her own story, of the cutting. “It be differenthere,” Alys had said.“My father was a fisherman, and he was out with the boats. It was this time ofyear, with the cold and the wind. He likely had a bad time of it too. But he wasa hard man, my father. Strong. Used to the weather.”He shrugged. “As I am,” he added.“But you’re not hard, Einar.”“Hardened to the weather, I am. I must be, for the creatures.”She knew he meant his flock of sheep.“I don’t feel the cold as you do,” he told her.“You’ve always been here. You’ve learned to live with it.”They sat silently for a moment. Then he began again to talk. “They say he camein from the sea that evening, and emptied his nets and tied his boat. All whosaw him fell silent, for no one wanted to be the one to tell him that his sonwas birthed healthy but his wife was already stiffening and being readied for acoffin.”He looked away. Then he said, “They say he had wanted a son. But not the onewhat took his wife.”Outside, a branch broke in the wind, skittered across the dooryard of his shed,and slammed against the wall. Claire could picture the fisherman arriving homein weather just like this to find a squalling infant and a wife turned blue andlost.“It was Alys kept him from flinging me into the fire. Others came and held himdown. He roared into the night, they say, cursing all flesh and the wind and thegods, even cursing the sea that be his livelihood.“He was a hard man to start, they say. My mum, she softened him a bit, but whenshe was gone he turned to stone. And the stone had an edge to it, sharpenedagainst me, for I had killed her.”“But it wasn’t—” Claire began, then stopped. He hadn’t heard her.“Others raised me. Village women. Then, when I was old enough, he tooken meback. Said it was time for me to pay for what I done.”“What did that mean, ‘old enough’? How old were you?”He thought. “Six years, mayhap? My front teeth had fallen out.”She shuddered at the thought of a little boy expected to atone for his mother’sdeath.“I didn’t know him. It was as if a stranger took me. I went to his cottage, forthey said I must, and that night he gave me food and drink, and a blanket towrap around me as I slept on a pile of straw. In the morning he kicked me awakebefore it was light and told me he would make a fisherman of me, for I owed him.“After that, every day, until I was growed, I went with him to the boat and onthe boat out onto the sea. He never spoke a soft word. Never told me about thekinds of leaves, or creatures, or pointed to the stars in the sky. Never sang asong to me, or held my hand. Just kicked me across the deck if I be clumsy,laughed when I be twisted in the ropes and sliding pure froze in the water thatwashed aboard. Slapped me in the head when the sea was rough and I puked overthe side. He hoped I would wash overboard and drown. He told me that.“He made me climb the mast to untangle the lines and he laughed when my handsslid from the salty wood and I fell onto the deck. When I broke my arm he keptme on the sea all day, hauling nets, then sent me to Alys that night and toldher to have it fixed by morning or he’d break the other.”“You should have killed him,” Claire said in a low voice.He didn’t speak for a moment. Then he said, “I had already killed my mother.”He stood suddenly, leaning on his stick. He went to the door, cracked it open,and breathed the wind. She was afraid he was going to go out into the bittercold, that telling her his past had now forced him to punish himself in someway. But after a moment he pulled the door tightly closed and came back. He satdown again, leaning his stick against the wall, and took several deep breaths.“I growed very strong,” he said.“I know.”“I growed taller than my father and so strong, I could have picked him up andflung him into the sea. But I never thought to do that. I stayed silent. Iobeyed him. I cooked for him like a wife and washed his clothes and was a wifein other ways too terrible to mention. I made myself into stone. I willed myselfdeaf when he cursed me and blind to the look of hatred in his eyes. I waited.”“Waited for what?”“To be old enough, strong enough, brave enough, to leave. To climb out.”“What went wrong?” she asked him.“Naught in the climbing out. I trained for it. I was ready. I knew I could do itand I did. It went wrong after.” Einar moved one damaged foot slightly, staringat it. His tone was bitter. Then it changed and became more gentle, and curious.“Why do you be asking about this?”“I must try,” Claire told him. “I must try to climb out.”He stared at her. “No woman ever done so,” he said.“I must. I have a child out there. A son. I must find him.”She had known he wouldn’t be scornful, for that was not his nature. She hadthought, though, that he might laugh at the impossibility of her plan. But hedid not. And she realized that he already knew of the child, that he had heardthe talk of it.He looked at her thoughtfully for a moment, then said, “Push against this.” Heextended his arm toward her, his hand held out upright at if to shove somethingaway.“Like this?” Claire held her hand up against his.He nodded. “Push.”She did, summoning her strength to try to move his hand, to bend his arm. It wasfirm. Rigid. Immobile. Her own arm trembled with her effort. Finally she gaveup. Her hand dropped back into her lap. It ached.Einar nodded. “You’re strong, at least in the arms. Can you climb?”Claire pictured the vertical rock cliff that hung over the village and hid thesun for half the day. She shook her head. “I climb the path up to the meadowwhere you keep the sheep. You’ve seen me do it often enough. And sometimes,gathering herbs, I go up into the woods near the waterfall. I never get tired.And it’s steep there. But I know that’s not what you mean.”“You must start to harden yourself. I’ll show you. It won’t be easy. You mustwant it.”“I do want it,” Claire said. Her voice broke. “I want him.”Einar paused, and thought, then said, “It be better, I think, to climb out insearch of something, instead of hating what you’re leaving.“It will be a long time,” he told her, “to make you ready.”“I know.”“Not days or weeks,” he said.“I know.”“Mayhap it will take years,” he told her. “For me, it was years.”“Years?”He nodded.“How do I start?” Claire asked."},{"pageContent":"TENEinar says I must do this every single day. It strengthens my belly, where thescar is. Watch.”Alys glanced over from the fire, where she was stirring a pot of onion soup. Shewatched for a moment as Claire, lying on the floor of the hut, wedged her feetunder a slab of rock that jutted from the base of the wall, and then lifted theupper half of her body and held herself at a slant, taut, for a moment beforeshe lowered herself slowly back down and took a breath.“Surely you didn’t show that lad your scar?”“Of course not. But I told him of it.” Claire bit her lip, held her breath, andraised herself once again. Then down, slowly. And again.“There,” she said, gasping, after a few moments. “That’s ten. He told me to doit ten times every day.”“Here. Have some soup and bread now,” Alys told her. “I’ll start bottling somestrengthening brews for you, as well.” She glanced up at the dried herbs hangingfrom the beams that supported the hut’s roof. Claire could hear her murmuringthe names—white willow, nettle, meadowsweet, goldenseal—and knew she waspondering what combinations to create.She had told Alys of her plan. No one else knew.Claire thought of Alys as the calmest person she knew, the person who had seenthe worst of things over her long life and was not surprised or distressed byany of it anymore. Claire had watched her stitch the flesh and wrap anastringent poultice around the leg of a small child gashed by a fall on theslippery rocks, soothing both the terrified mother and the screaming toddler atthe same time with her reassuring voice. She had seen her, quiet and commanding,attend the most difficult births, with the babies upside down or sideways andthe mum begging for death and the dad puking in the dooryard. Claire had beenthere at deaths—Andras’s mother from fever and cough; a fisherman with his skullcrushed by a broken mast; a young boy racked by fits from the day of his birth,finally at five dead with foam on his lips and his eyes rolled back to white.Alys had tended them, tended their families, weighted the eyelids and folded thearms, then returned to the hut to wash her tools, cook supper, and wait for thenext frantic villager who would come to the door begging for help.She had never seemed alarmed—until the day Einar and Claire told her that Clairemust climb out.“That canna be,” she had said loudly, and began to rock back and forth in herchair as if to try to soothe a deep pain. “Oh, no. Canna! You’ll die!”She turned to Claire fiercely. “You’ll die on the cliff. You’ll fall and bebroken to pieces! I’ve seen the others who was! And look at him, who was oncefleet and sure-footed—look at him now, ruined by climbing out! I’m sorry, Einar,you’re a good lad and I loved your mum, but you’re bloody ruined by thatmountain and I won’t have you do it to my girl!”“It was not the mountain ruined me, Alys,” Einar said firmly. Claire, listening,was startled by the sudden sureness of him. He had always been so shy andhalting in his speech. But now he spoke with certainty to Alys. “I strengthenedmyself for it and did it. I climbed out. It was after. And I’ll teach her ofthat. But for now I’ll make her strong. That’s how we’re starting, and we needyou to help, Alys, for she wants her son and must have a way to find him.”“Boat,” Alys wailed. “She can go forth on the sea, surely, if she must go.”“No. Not by sea. I won’t.” As much as she feared the cliff and the climbing shemust learn to do, Claire feared the sea more.“It’s winter now,” Alys said to them, weakening a bit. “Mayhap in spring we cantoughen her up. The sun, and air. That’ll be good for strength.”Einar laughed. “We’ll start now, Alys,” he said, “and spring will come before weknow it. It always does.” It did. Spring came. Through all the months of winter she had, each day, lain onthe hut floor, put her hands behind her head, and raised herself. Her scarredabdomen had become tight and smooth, and she no longer breathed hard at theeffort.She told Einar, “I’m ready.”He laughed. They were standing beside the door of the hut, and he told her torun up the hillside path, up to the waterfall, and back down to where he stood.There was a fine rain falling, as there had been all week. The path was slickwith spring mud. Claire made a face.“It’s too slippery.”“It’s smooth and dry, if you think on it compared to the mountain.”“Yes, well—”“Run up it. Grip with your feet.”Claire looked down at her own feet, encased in thick wool socks under her coarseleather sandals.“Take them off,” Einar said.Claire sighed and obeyed. She pulled her sandals off, and the socks. The groundwas very cold, still. Spring was young and the drizzle was chilly. She wiggledher toes into the cold, wet earth, to get the grip, and then began to run.The path steepened partway up and she slipped, scraping her knee on a rock. Sherighted herself and now her hands were thick with mud and a red trickle of bloodpatterned her leg. Catching her breath, she eyed the wet path above; then shetook a breath and continued. Run, Einar had said. She had climbed this pathoften before, but always slowly, placing her feet carefully. Now she ran. Shetried to dig her toes into the ground, but they slid and she fell again andrighted herself again. By the time she reached the top of the hill and stood bythe rushing waterfall, she found herself in tears. She was coated in mud,shaking with cold, and her knee was swollen and sore. From where she stood, shecould see him below, looking up, watching her. She hoped he couldn’t see hercrying.“Now down!” she heard him call.Sliding partway, grasping tree roots to keep from falling, she stumbled down thetreacherous path to the bottom. She wiped her tearstained face with muddy handsand hurried to where Einar was waiting.“Good,” he told her. “Now do it again.” Each day through the summer she ran the hill path. On fine days, the mist of thefalls made rainbows, and she began to smile when she reached that place, insteadof weeping as she had the first time. It began to feel not easy, but doable. Shebegan to come down grinning and proud.Einar grinned back at her. “You’re growing strong,” he said, then added, “for agirl.”She glanced at him and saw that he was teasing her. His look was fond. He turnedaway quickly and tried to hide the fondness, but Claire knew. She had seen himlook that way at a half-grown lamb prancing in the meadow on a midsummerafternoon, admiring its agile charm. She had seen him look that way at her, andknew there was a longing to his gaze.When she felt she had mastered the path, he made it harder. He tied her handstogether so that she couldn’t use them to steady herself. When the springmoisture had dried, the path became gritty and treacherous in a different way.She couldn’t grip it with her toes. When she fell, bruising her shoulder becauseshe couldn’t break the fall with her tethered hands, he taunted her. When shewept, he ignored her. She dried her tears and ran.One afternoon Bryn, her baby in a sling on her chest, stopped by the hut to geta remedy for a spider bite on her ankle. Alys and Claire looked at the hot,swollen sore. “Comfrey root oil,” Alys told her. “I have it here. Sit while Iheat it.”Bryn handed little Elen to Claire. “I’ll take her outside,” Claire said, and shecarried the sturdy, curly-headed girl to the dooryard to show her someblack-eyed Susans in bloom.Einar appeared. He came every day now, if Claire didn’t run to the sheep meadowand meet him there.“It’s Bryn’s baby,” she told him. “Isn’t she sweet?” She handed a picked flowerto Elen, who grasped it in a fist and waved it in the air.“Run with her,” Einar said.Claire was startled, but she laughed. Then, holding the baby, she ran around thesmall dooryard. Elen waved her arms in delight.“Let me feel her weight.” Einar took the baby from Claire. She could see that hehad no experience with a human infant, though he was sure and facile with lambs.She watched as with his large hands under her, Einar assessed how heavy Elenwas.“You must start running with weight,” he said, and handed the baby back. “I’llbring it tomorrow.”The next day he was back with a crude leather sack half filled with rocks. Hetied it to Claire’s back and told her to run the hill path. She did so, andarrived panting at the waterfall. She was tempted to throw a few of the rocksinto the rushing torrent, to ease the burden for the run back down. But shedidn’t. She ran with the weight, and then ran the path again, and found that herbreathing changed, to accommodate the heaviness. After a few runs, the longerbreaths she needed came naturally, and it was as if she had always carried it.Alys told her that it was the way of women, to tote a newborn and then adjust asit grew until by the time the child was plump and heavy, the weight seemednaught. Einar left a pile of rocks beside the base of the path and told her toadd one more to the sack each day.Her legs grew muscled and firm. She showed him, one day, how strong and surethey had become. He felt where she showed him, pressing his large hand againstthe taut, smooth skin above her ankle, and nodded. Then he left his hand there,encircling her leg, and they looked at each other for a moment before he took itaway. She felt his fondness again, and her own for him, and the futility of itfor them both. She could not stay here.One morning Einar set a thick log on end. It reached to her knee.“Step up on that,” he said.She reached for his hand, needing it for support, but he backed away. Clairechecked the log to be certain it was firm on the ground. Then she measured theheight with her eyes, raised one leg up, placed it on the top of the log,shifted her weight, and picked up her other foot. But she lost her balance andfell back.“Try again.”All afternoon she stepped onto and down from the log. At first she held her armswide, using them for balance. Then Einar approached with the coarse rope he hadused to restrain her hands on the steep path.“Wait,” she told him. “I don’t need my arms tied.” Firmly she held her own handsat her sides. Wobbling at first, she tested herself again and again untilwithout moving her arms she could maintain her balance as she mounted the log.“Good,” he said. The next day he brought a higher, narrower log. Winter came. Outdoors, she ran and climbed on ice. He began to teach her to usea rope, to knot it and twirl it and fling it so that it caught on a rock or abranch. At first it caught things at random. Then, after a bit, she found shecould aim with the noose of the rope, that she could choose a log or a bush andcatch it precisely on most of her attempts. Then he made the noose smaller. Hedirected her to capture smaller things: a seedling pine reaching upward from acrevice; a stone balanced on a tree stump. He took away the thick, coarse ropeand gave her a thin, woven cord that whistled when she spun it out into the coldair and snapped a twig with its tiny noose.Inside the hut, in a corner that Alys had cleared for her, she walked back andforth on a piece of rope stretched taut between two posts, her toes gripping therope, her breath even, her eyes focused, her arms at first stretched forbalance, and then, as spring approached, her hands at her side and her movementsteady and controlled. She walked the rope forward and backward. She stood on itstill as a post: on one leg, then the other. Slowly she bent one knee, loweredherself, remained there poised, then rose again.Yellow-wing twittered and pranced on his perch, excited as he watched her. Alys,watching, held her breath and then gasped at each new move.But Claire was calm. She felt strong. She felt ready.“Now?” she asked Einar.Einar shook his head. “Next, we begin to strengthen your arms,” he said. By the following spring, Bryn’s baby, Elen, was sturdy and walking. Bryn wasexpecting another and hoped for a boy. Bethan, Delwyth, and Eira were tall now,with long legs and secrets that made them whisper and giggle.Most of the village had lost interest in Claire. She was no longer new andmysterious. The scandal of her child was forgotten; there had been more recentdisgraces—a woman who took up with her sister’s husband, a fisherman who wascaught stealing from his own brother. The villagers took little note of Claire’sodd new hobby; the hill paths were not visible, and Alys’s hut was separate.She continued her everyday chores, helping with the gathering of plants,accompanying Alys to births and deaths. Sometimes Alys sent her alone to tend asimple cough or fever or rash. The old woman was increasingly bent over, and herwalking now was slow. Her eyesight was dimmed. She needed more rest.Claire teased her gently and told her that she should train to climb out. “Lookhow strong Einar has made me!” she said, and held out her bare arm, tighteningthe muscles with pride.Each evening, after she had cleaned up the hut from dinner and while Alys satknitting in her rocker, Claire took up her position, lying on her side on a matnear the wall, and breathed deeply. Then, legs straight, she raised her body onone arm, held herself there, hovering, and then eased herself slowly down. Againand again. First one arm. Then the other.Her sack of rocks was so heavy now that an ordinary person groaned, trying tolift it. But for Claire it was easy. She swung it onto her back each day andwore it while she tended the garden or gathered the herbs. She ran up and downthe hill path with the sack on her back and another in her arms. Steep, ruttedplaces that had once made her stumble and slip were now familiar and easy.He had her run the path at night. Things felt different in the dark. She trainedher feet and hands to know the shapes of things and her mind to sense when sheneared an edge and must back away lest she fall.He wanted to blindfold her so that she could practice the dark in daytime. Butshe said no.“I’ll do it at night, even in the middle of the night, when there’s no moon andwhen it’s bitter cold. But I can’t have something tied over my eyes. It’s likebeing on the sea. It’s a fearsome memory that I can’t—”She turned away and couldn’t finish. But he seemed to understand. “You mustlearn the dark, though,” he told her. “Part of the climbing out will be in dark.You’ll start before the sun comes up.”“Why?”“It’s too long a climb to do it all in daylight. If you wait and go at dawn, atsunup, then the dark part will come near the top. You’ll be making your way upand around places where a mistake will bring death on you. I’ll teach you tofeel every bit with your feet, but even so you’ll need your eyes as you near thetop.”Together they looked up at the shadowy cliff. Claire had to lean back to see thetop. Mist swirled there and she could see hawks circling.He had said he would teach her to feel with her feet, and after some time shebecame aware, amused by it, that even her toes were supple now. Withastonishment she realized that she could perceive the smallest of pebbles—andpick them up, if need be, with individual toes. She could grasp a twig betweenthe third and fourth toe of her left foot, or carefully feel her way around thesharp edge of a flat rock by her right big toe, which was as sensitive now as afingertip.She told this to Einar with delight. “Imagine that!” she said. “Toes!” He noddedin agreement but looked sad.“What’s wrong?” she asked him.But he turned away and didn’t reply. Guiltily she realized it had been cruel tobe so gleeful over the strength and agility of her feet to someone who had losthis own."},{"pageContent":"ELEVENTwins! Two boys with bright red hair. Bryn, exhausted as she was, lay laughingat the surprise and the sight of them. Claire held one in each arm and thenlaughed herself as she realized she was raising and lowering them slightly, thesame way Einar had her raise and lower heavy rocks to strengthen her forearms.It was almost winter again. She moved Yellow-wing’s cage indoors. It had hungall summer and into autumn from a tree branch in the dooryard. Now, in thewarmth, he fluffed his wings and chirped. Bethan was there, and Elen. Theirmother needed quiet to tend her two new boys, and sent the girls off to amusethemselves. Now little Elen, squatting on the floor, twisted twigs into a birdshape and pretended she had made a wife for Yellow-wing. Bethan was busilyhelping Alys sort some dried herbs to be packed into bags and stored. Claire,watching, realized that Alys was beginning to teach the young girl in the sameway that she had taught Claire for these past years. The village would needsomeone to take Alys’s place. It was clear that it could not be Claire.She wrapped her hands around the thick branch that Einar had peeled and setfirmly in place above the door. She lifted herself up until her chin was levelwith the peeled wood. She hung poised there and counted to ten, then loweredherself slowly. Doing this still hurt. That meant she needed it. She must dothis each day until it stopped hurting. Then, she knew, Einar would tell her toput on her backpack filled with rocks and begin doing it again.Briefly, on a day when she was exhausted, she thought of Einar with frustration,of how demanding he was, how relentlessly he made her do the exercises again andagain. Then she thought of how he watched her, assessing and admiring herstrength, and she knew that his gaze was also that of someone who loved her.Tall Andras had married in midsummer, his new wife a fresh-faced, quick-smilingyoung girl named Maren. Standing at the ceremony, Claire felt no sadness; shehad never wanted to be his wife. But once he had hoped for it, and now he hadmoved on and seemed happy. She thought sadly of Einar, alone in his hillsidehut, and knew that a part of life was passing both of them by.“Soon?” she asked Einar, after she showed him how she could hold herself raisedon the branch with her arms taut and unshaking, even while wearing the sack ofrocks at its heaviest. He ignored her question.“One arm now,” he said. While he watched, she struggled to lift herself withjust one. He wanted her arms to be equally strong on both sides, as her legs nowwere. On either leg she could hop up onto a rock slippery with damp moss andstand balanced there with the other tucked up like a waterbird. After rain shecould slide, standing on one foot, down the steep muddy path and stop herself atany point by pressure on her heel or toes.She could hold a pebble on her raised foot and then move it by concentrating onit until it was between two toes, then under. From there she could move it fromtoe to toe, under and over. It made little Elen laugh uproariously to watch andthen try the same feat with her own chubby toes.“Why do I need to spend time learning foolish tricks?” Claire asked Einar. “Thisseems a waste.”“It won’t be. It’s important. You’ll see.”She was eager to go. She had waited such a long time.But she had come to trust Einar, his wisdom and caring, deeply. So she sighedand nodded. In the winter she slept beside Alys. When the fire died late one night, withwind howling outside, the old woman shivered and Claire embraced her, trying tosend warmth from her own body into the frail limbs that could no longer hold onto their own heat.“You’re a good girl,” Alys murmured. “Your own mum must miss you fierce.”Claire was startled. When she tried, in response to Alys’s words, to think ofher mother, there was little that came forth. Parents. Yes. She had had parents.She could remember their faces, and could even recall the sound of their voices.But there was little else.“No,” she told Alys. “I don’t think she loved me.”Alys turned in the bed and through the dim light of the last embers that glowedin the fireplace, Claire could see her bright eyes, open in surprise. “How couldthat be, child?”Claire chuckled and hugged her. “I’m not a child anymore, Alys. Maybe I was whenyou found me. I was a young girl, then. But so much time has passed, Alys. I’m awoman now.”“To me you’re a child, still. And a mum always loves her child.”“It should be so, shouldn’t it? But something stood in the way of it. I think itwas a—well, they called them pills. The mothers took pills.”“Pills?”“Like a potion.”“Ah.” That was something Alys understood. “But a potion is meant to fix an ill.”Claire yawned. She was achy and exhausted.“My people—” (“My people”? What did that mean? She didn’t really know) “Theythought that it fixed a lot of ills, not to have feelings like love.”“Fools,” Alys muttered. Now she yawned too. “You loved your boy, though. That’swhy you’re soon to climb out.”Claire closed her eyes and patted the old woman’s back. “I did,” she said. “Iloved my boy. I still do.”"},{"pageContent":"TWELVEIn late spring, Tall Andras had a plump newborn son, and there were lambsprancing in the upper meadow, their soft fleece warm in the changed, gentlerweather. Early wildflowers were in bloom, and lavender butterflies withlacy-patterned wings darted from one to the next. Bryn’s twin boys grinned andshowed two teeth apiece. The fishermen folded freshly knotted nets they hadmended in winter while their wives, beside them at the fire, made the sweatersthey would wear on their boats.Even the wind seemed new. It wasn’t the same brutal wind that had ripped theroof thatch and swirled the snow. Now it pulled the warm scent of brine-washedsea urchins, mussels, and kelp from the rocks and carried it gently across thebeach and up the hill. It lifted Claire’s long curls as she knelt and filled abasket with nettles. The rigid stems and heart-shaped leaves were covered withstiff hairs that were painful to touch, but she was wearing the specialprotective gloves Alys had made. The plant would be a valuable pain reliever forOld Benedikt, who was suffering from gout.“Don’t touch,” she warned Bethan, who had come with her and wanted to help. “Itstings. You gather the elder bark, over there. Your mum needs it for yourbrothers.”Bethan peeled bits of the bark and added it to the basket. The twins were fussyfrom teething.“When I leave, you’ll be in charge of the gathering, then. Alys will make glovesfor you. You must be careful with these nettles.”Bethan hung her head.“Do you think you can’t do it? You’ve learned so much,” Claire reassured her.“I can do it. But I don’t want you to leave.”“Ah, Bethy.” Claire hugged the slender girl. “You know why I must go.”“To find your baby.” Bethan sighed. “Yes, I know.”“Not a baby anymore. He’s a boy now. If I don’t go soon to find him, he’ll be aman!”“I fear for you, Claire.” Bethan’s voice was low.“Why is that? You know how strong I am. Look!” Claire reached up with one armand grasped a limb of the elder tree. She raised herself until she balanced,unwavering, from the one muscled arm. Then, slowly, she lowered herself back tothe ground. “Not even your pa can do that, can he?”Bethan smiled slightly. “No. And Pa’s getting fat, too, Ma says.”“You mustn’t fear for me, then. You can see that I’m strong, and swift, and. . .”“Smart, and sly, and . . .” Bethan giggled. It was a game they often played,with the sounds of words.“And silly!”“And sleepy!”“And slugbucket!”“Swatbottom!”As it always did, their word game dissolved into nonsense and they laughed asthey carried the basket back down the hill. Time passed quickly now. The seasons flowed into one another and Claire was nolonger surprised as the changes came. Like the other villagers, she bundledherself against the increasing cold as each winter approached, and welcomed eachnew spring. The growth of the children made her aware of time passing. Bethanand her companions were no longer giggling, exuberant children; they werebecoming taller, quieter, preparing for womanhood to come. Elen, no longer ababy, was the small, mischievous one now, playing the imaginative games that hersister once had. The redheaded twin boys scuffled and scampered together whileBryn, their mother, fretted over their misbehavior and laughed at their antics.Each spring the snow melted and Claire took Yellow-wing’s cage outside to hangit once again from the tree. Each fall, when the wind swept in from the sea andthe leaves fell rustling on the ground, she brought her little companion intothe cottage once again.“How long will he live?” she asked Einar one day when she was feeding the bird.Suddenly she was aware that each life had a beginning and an end.“Birds have a long life. He’ll be here to keep Alys company when you be gone.”Claire glanced at him. He had not mentioned it in a long time, the fact of herleaving. He tested her strength, still, and kept her working at it, but he hadnot spoken of the climbing out for many months. It had been six years now sincethe day she had been carried in from the sea, and five since the morning thatElen’s birth returned the memory of her son to her. Somewhere he would be ahalf-grown boy: running, shouting, playing.Einar saw her questioning look.“Soon,” he told her. With summer approaching, plants coming into flower, and Alys in need of morehelp as her strength began to ebb, there was a great deal to do. The dailyexercise had long been part of Claire’s routine. She rose before dawn each dayand lifted sacks weighted with stones many times with each arm before she putthe kettle over the fire. Then, while she waited for the water to boil for tea,she practiced the lifting of her legs, and the raising of her upper body as shelay flat. She could now do these things with great ease. It made her laugh toremember how difficult they had been when she started. Now she tied heavy rocksto her ankles and wrists but still performed the familiar motions withouteffort.She cleaned Yellow-wing’s cage as she did each morning. It had been raining forsome days, but now the rain seemed to have ended; it was a simple cloudy springmorning. She carried the cage outside and hung it from the willow tree besidethe hut. She whistled and chirped back at the bird, who was excited at beingoutdoors. Then she heard a familiar answering whistle and turned to greet Einar,who was approaching from the meadow path.“Alys baked bread yesterday,” she told him cheerfully. “And she made extra. Wehave a loaf ready for you.”“Look at the sky,” Einar said.She did. Above the looming cliff, the pale wadded clouds reminded her of Einar’ssheep when, after the snowmelt, they still huddled for warmth but with headsdown moved across the meadow nibbling at new shoots. But somehow she knew thatwasn’t what he meant.“What?”“There’s sun behind. The rain’s done for a while.”Those who tended stock, like Einar, or who farmed, like Andras, or all of thevillage fishermen—they knew the sky. Claire nodded cheerfully at what he said.“Good. I can do the washing and hang it out on the bushes.”“No,” Einar said. “No more washing. It’s time to climb out.”"},{"pageContent":"THIRTEENThere were still stars visible in the night sky. A sliver of spring moon waslow, just above the quiet-moving sea. In the meadow, the huddled sheep weresilent. The only sound was the rush of water from the falls above, through thewoods to the side.They stood there together. Then Claire said, “I’m sorry for what happened toyou.”“Aye. I know.”He had told her, at last, how he had been damaged. It was worse than she couldhave imagined. But she knew she must not think of it now. When she reached thetop would be the time. She would have to plan, then, and what he had revealed toher would be part of her planning. But for now she must concentrate only on theclimb.“He’ll be there at the top, do you think?”“Not at first. You’ll wait there and he’ll come. Don’t think on it now.”“But I will know him?”“Aye. You will.”“Do you think I’ll make it, Einar?”“You will.” He laughed and touched her cheek. “I’ve given you what’s been in mymind for all these years, since I climbed out. Every night since then I’veclimbed out again. I’ve felt again each rock, each bit of moss, each twig andhollow and cleft and turn: at night, when other men are mending their nets orsharpening their tools or making love to their women—I’ve been remembering theclimbing. I have a map in my mind and I’ve given it to you and you’ll be safe.”He chuckled and hugged her. “You must. If you don’t, I’ll be made a fool of, forI was the one what made you strong! Let me see your pack now, to make it tightagainst you.”Claire knelt on the path at the base of the cliff while Einar leaned his walkingsticks against the rock wall and adjusted the pack on her back.“Knife?” he asked her.She showed him how it was firmly knotted onto the cord that hung around herneck.“Rope?”It was coiled neatly and wrapped around her shoulder.“The water gourd’s in your pack. Don’t try to reach it when you’re on the rock,even if you thirst fierce. There are places where you can stop and rest. Ledges,they’re called. If you climb steady you’ll reach the first one at midday. Youcan stop to drink there.”“Yes, I know. You told me.”“What’s this?” He was feeling her pack. “Down by the water gourd, with thegloves?”“Alys put that in. Herb salve for healing.”“Aye, that’s good. Mayhap when you use the rope, you’ll burn your hands, evenwith the gloves. If you slip on the rope, it pulls against your skin. But don’tlet go.”“I won’t. You know I won’t.”“Don’t put on the gloves lessen you use the rope. You need to feel with yourfingers.”“Einar?”“What?”She showed him. “Alys made this. You can’t see it because it’s too dark, butfeel.”She handed him the flat, round object and waited while he felt it.“It’s just an ordinary rock. But Alys sewed a piece of cloth around it. It’sbright red. She made it from the woolen hat I wore last winter.”“Whyever?”“When I get to the top? You told me there’s a very steep place just before. Theplace I must be so careful . . .”“Aye, the place with the rock steps. Don’t look down.”“No, I won’t. I’ll do it just the way you told me, feeling for each step, beingso careful, not looking down, not being gleeful because it’s the top.”“What, then?”“When I finish climbing all those steps and am at the top, and feel my feet inthe solid earth? Then I’ll fling this rock out into the air and down.”“The sun will be setting.”“Yes. I’ll fling my rock out into the sunset. You look tomorrow. Look on theground down here for the bright red. Then you’ll know that I did it. That Iclimbed out.”“Aye. I’ll look. It’ll be a sign.”He touched her cheek and held his hand there tenderly for a moment. “I will missyou, Water Claire,” he said.“I will never forget you, Fierce Einar,” she replied.They both smiled at the long-ago names. Then he kissed her, turned away, andreached for his sticks. She would not see him again. It was time for her tostart. The base of the cliff was large boulders, some of them slippery with damp mosson their shadowed sides. They were easy for her to climb; she had practiced hereoccasionally, after dark. So her feet (bare, though her sandals were in her packfor later) knew the feel and shape of them. But it would be too easy to dismissthe dangers even of this familiar beginning place. A slip on the moss, amisplaced step, a turned ankle, and her mission would end before it began. Soshe reminded herself to be vigilant. She focused on each move, placing each footmeticulously, feeling the surface with her toes, assessing the texture, shiftingher weight before she took the next step. Once she jostled a small rock inpassing and sent a shower of stones clattering down. She scolded herself forthat. It was a small misjudgment and caused no harm. But she could not afford asingle mistake this day.Einar had told her to think of nothing during the climb but the climb itself.But now and then, during this early section that she could maneuver with ease,she found her thoughts straying from the cliff. If only, the voice in her mindwhispered. What if.If only I had taken the baby that day. What if I had brought my little son here,and he could have grown up with Einar teaching him about the birds, and thelambs . . .He would have died in the sea. She shuddered, thinking of it.What if Einar had not tried to climb out? What if he had stayed whole? Then heand I could go together, and find my son, and . . .She willed her thoughts to stop. Concentrate, she told herself. Concentrate onlyon the cliff. On the climb.There were plants here, in places where wind-borne seeds had dropped into therocky crevices and been nourished by melted snow, sprouting now in this earlyspring, their stems reaching up. By daybreak she would be able, perhaps, to seethem move as they sought the sun. Now, in the dark, she could only feel themthere, tendrils brushing against her bare legs. She tried not to trample theirfragile growth.Ah. Here. This was why Einar had told her not to let her thoughts wander. Herewas the place he had described, where suddenly, in this massed section ofboulders, was a rift, a deep gap in the rocks, a place where she must jump tothe next foothold. He knew it would still be dark when she reached it.“Why don’t we go there now, in daylight, just for practice?” she had asked him.“Then I’ll know exactly the length of the jump, and—Oh.” She caught herself,realizing that it would be impossible for him. He struggled each day, making hisway with difficulty down from the sheep pasture in order to teach and help her.He could not scramble up this mass of uneven rocks.But he had helped her to create the practice place. He measured the distance andheight; they built the shapes from mud and let it harden. She jumped it againand again. It was not difficult. She was to leap from the top of a jaggedboulder across the gap to a flat granite surface. He had her do it repeatedly onmoonless nights, so that she could not see, and she began to feel the distanceso accurately that her feet found the same landing place every time.“You’ll come to a place where you must squeeze betwixt two rocks as high as yourshoulder. Matched. Same size, like Bryn’s boys,” he had told her. “When you getyourself through—mind you don’t catch your pack in the squeeze—then you goupward to the top of the next rock. It slants up, and there’s a sharp edgeyou’ll feel. That’s where you plant yourself, on that edge, and jump outward anddown.”It was just as he had described. The twin rocks were as high as her chin, andthe space between them narrow. Carefully she used her hands and felt the surfaceall the way down each one, to make sure there would be no rough places to scrapeand injure her as she squeezed herself between them in the dark. Then, archingher back to accommodate the lumpy pack—it would be a disaster should her watergourd be crushed—she slid through.The next rock was what she expected, a sharp upward slant with jaggedoutcroppings. She mounted it inch by inch, avoiding the daggerlike places thatmight gash her soles. She used her trained toes like fingers, feeling the way.It was slow going because she took such care. It was what he had taught her todo. Finally she reached the top of the slant, the sharp edge where he hadinstructed her to plant her feet for the jump. She balanced there, took a deepbreath, recalled in her mind the feel of the distance she must cover, then madethe leap into darkness with certainty. She landed on the flat granite, balancedperfectly. It had been her first challenge, really, and a small one. But eventhe small ones could be disastrous if they went wrong, and it was satisfying tohave it behind her. She took her water gourd from the pack, sipped, and restedthere for a moment, thinking through the next part of the climb. On the horizon,looking out across the sea, she could see a thin pink line of dawn emerge."},{"pageContent":"FOURTEENMidday. The sun was directly overhead now. Claire could see, below her, that thetops of the trees were moving slightly. So there was a bit of a breeze. But itdidn’t reach here. She wiped sweat from her forehead and pushed her damp hairback. She retied the cord that held it bunched at her neck, then wiped hersweaty hands carefully on the woven cloth of her garment. She could not affordthe least slip of her hand on the rock face of the cliff. Earlier, farther down,she might have recovered from a falter or stumble, might even have bound up atwisted ankle and continued on. But here, now, an instant of missed footing or alost grip on a handhold would mean certain death. She blew on her hands anddried them again.She was balanced now on a narrow ledge. Einar had told her she would reach thisplace at midday and it would be safe to stop here and drink from her gourd. Shehad done so already, once, at dawn, on the lower rocks, when it was still easyto stand and rearrange her pack. Here it was much more difficult. The hours oflearning balance were helping her now. Turned sideways on the ledge that was nowider than her two feet side by side, she wriggled the pack around so that shecould reach in and grasp the gourd. She held it carefully with both hands whileshe drank, then replaced it and withdrew the gloves from the pack. She wouldneed them next.If she had needed her arms for balance on this precarious perch, she would nothave been able to drink. But her body needed the water, and he had prepared herfor this. After she moved the pack again to its place between her shoulders, shestood with her legs steady and firm and pulled a glove onto each hand. Thenslowly she uncoiled the rope.It was amazing, really, that having made this climb only once—then down again,so perhaps that counted as twice; but he was injured then, and could hardly havebeen memorizing the ledges and grasping places—Einar had been able to recreateit for Claire. She imagined him alone in his hut, all those years, making theclimb again in his mind, creating the map of it night after night.Here you must stop and look carefully ahead and slightly up, for the next hold.At this place there is loose rock. It deceives. Do not place your foot on theledge here. It won’t hold.A gull has nested here. Feel under the nest, through the twigs. There’s a placeto grasp.Use the rope here.Feel with your toes now.Don’t look down.She was now at the place where he had said to use the rope. She must find thespot up and ahead where a gnarled tree jutted from a slice in the rock face.There would be a small ledge beneath it. Between here, where she stood balancedon this ledge, and the one below the tree, was nothing she could grip or hold.So she must capture the tree with the noose of her rope and use it to get acrossthe wide expanse of vertical rock.She formed and knotted the noose. Across and above, she saw the stunted tree.She measured it with her eyes, to know how large the noose should be. Einar hadsaid it may have grown in the years since he had done this. She might have tomake a large noose, he had told her, to whirl it over the crooked branches, thentighten it around the twisted trunk.But she could see from here that it had not grown at all. Instead, it wasblackened, and one of the branches hung crooked and dead, split from the trunk.Lightning, Claire thought. It has been struck by lightning.She tried to see where the roots emerged from the rock. Were they split as well?Would they hold? But they were hidden from her sight by a thick knob on thetrunk itself.He had warned her not to look down here. She was tempted to do so, in order toknow what would happen if the tree failed her, if it broke from her weight andshe fell. But she could hear his voice: Think only on the climb. Think on whatyou control.She could not control the tree, or its blackened, split trunk. She could notcontrol the strength of the gnarled roots that held it to the cliff.But he had taught her how to control her body: her arms, her hands, her fingers,her feet and legs. And with them she could control the rope. She let it out,looping between her gloved hands, until it seemed the length was right. Then shebegan to twirl the noose. She had practiced this with Einar so often.Now. She sent it loose and the loops unwound between her gloves as the rope shotout like a snake she had once seen unwind itself in pursuit of a mouse frozen interror. The snake had killed the mouse in a split second. Claire’s aim was justas accurate, but she had made the noose too small. It caught the end of the treebut didn’t encircle it entirely; it was caught in the Y of a small forkedbranch.She jerked at the rope and to her relief the twig on which it was caught snappedand the rope fell loose. She brought it in, hand over hand, and coiled it again.She remade the noose, slightly larger this time, and looped it for a second timebetween her gloved hands.She called back the image of the snake: its eyes, its aim, the swift accuracy ofits strike. One more time she twirled the rope and sent it out. This time,snakelike in its precision, it encircled the tree.Claire tightened the noose, pulling it in close around the trunk by its basenear the rock wall. Then, still balanced on the tiny ledge where she stood, sheknotted the rope around her own waist. Her next move must be to leave the ledge,to steady herself with the taut rope and walk herself across the expanse ofvertical veined granite, feeling for tiny protrusions to grasp with her baretoes. If the tree uprooted and fell, she would fall with it and die.Think only on the task. On the climb.She reached out with a foot, pressed it into the wall, and anchored it there.She tightened her grip on the rope and lifted her second foot from the ledge.For a breathless moment she dangled there in space. Then she placed her foot onthe wall and steadied herself. The tree was holding. She moved her first foot aninch, then another. The tree still held. She tightened the rope, moved hersecond foot, and then the first again. She took in more rope through her glovedpalms as she moved herself slowly across.When at last she reached the small ledge below the tree and felt her feet firmlyin place there, she took a deep breath. From here she would go upward though adiagonal crevice, but there would be footholds—she could see the first ones justabove her—and at the top, another resting place. With difficulty she pulled therope loose from the tree and rewound it. There was no way to return her glovesto her pack here on this tiny precarious place, so she fixed them under the ropeon her shoulder. Then she reached up for the first wedge of rock and liftedherself by one arm into the crevice.It was cooler here in the shadows. She realized she was getting tired. And itwas only early afternoon. There was still a long way to go. It took Claire longer than she had expected to make her way through the narrowshadowed tunnel that the crevice had formed. It was not life-threatening, as therope-assisted passage across the cliff face had been. There was no sheer drophere. She was moving upward at a slant between two walls of rock. It was cool,which helped, for it had been very hot on the cliff face, and the sun had madeit hard to see at times, shimmering as it did on the granite. Here, it was hardto see for the opposite reason: the shadowy darkness that made it cool. But itwas like the night climbing at the bottom. She did it by feel.The chill had also made it wet. Snowmelt had seeped into the rock tunnel, andthe small opening had not allowed the sun in to evaporate the water. So the rockwalls were damp and slippery. Twice Claire’s fingers slid loose from their holdsand she went backwards, sliding down into the space she had just climbedthrough. She wiped her hands firmly again on her clothing, but the fabric toowas now soaked through. Finally she thought to put on the gloves that she hadwedged under her coiled rope. But when she pulled at them, there was only one.The other glove had slipped free and fallen someplace. For a moment shedespaired. Then she remembered what Einar had told her: When something wentwrong—and it’s sure that something will, he had said—you stopped to think, thenfound a way around it.She lay at a slant in the tunnel, holding herself there with her legs tautagainst the walls, and thought. Then she put the remaining glove on her righthand, turned, grasped the next handhold, the one she had slipped from, and heldherself there. The glove made it easier. It was thick and coarse. Even damp, itheld fast. So she was secure for the moment. She worked her legs up an inch at atime, on either side, until they held her.Then slowly, carefully, she took the glove off, put it on her other hand, andreached up farther for the next handhold. She grabbed, held on, and began againto inch her legs up. In the darkness she felt the wall with her ungloved hand,trying to find the next holding place; when she had found it, she carefullyswitched the glove again so she could hold fast. It was painstakingly slow, butshe was moving upward instead of sliding down. Far up and ahead she could seethe sunny opening where she would emerge back onto the side of the cliff. This,she remembered, was where she would find a large nest. She was to reach underthe thick twiggy construction for a place to grasp. From there she would moveonto a series of outcroppings that formed something almost like steps.“Nest. Steps. Nest. Steps.” She began to murmur the two words, giving them asort of rhythm that helped her move upward and forward. It gave her something tofocus on as she continued the agonizingly slow ascent between the dark, dampwalls."},{"pageContent":"FIFTEENEmerging from the tunneled cleft in the cliff wall, Claire was once again facedwith the sheer drop of it, the certain death if she were to fall. Just in frontof her, she was reassured to see the large nest that Einar had told her shewould find. She caught her breath, then stretched forward and pulled loose somedried seaweed that formed part of its construction. She used it to dry herperspiring hands, then tucked it into her sleeve.Reach under the nest, he had told her. There’s a place to grab on to, there.She began to follow his instructions, leaning against the cliff toward the nest.Nest. Then steps.The attack was swift, painful, and without warning. From behind and above,something huge swooped and stabbed her viciously behind her ear. She could feelthe blood flow down her neck.She retreated with a gasp back into the tunnel, supporting herself with her feetpressed against the side walls. She held the wad of seaweed against her woundbut could feel the blood pulsing.Immediately she understood what she was facing. Einar had made the climb inwinter. The nest had been empty then. Now there must be new chicks. Yes. Shelistened and could hear the tiny squawking cries. Peering out, she could see theshadow of the parent gull, circling.The neck of her shirt was wet with it, but the flow of blood gradually eased.Tentatively she lifted the homemade bandage. Good. The wound was only oozing.The sharp pain had subsided. She knew that she would be bruised and sore later,but that was not a concern now. Her urgent need was to figure out how to getpast the nest, using its important handhold, and to the steplike rockprotrusions that would be the means of her final ascent to the top.After testing her legs and feet against the walls to be certain her perch wassecure and she wouldn’t slip back down into the tunnel, Claire reached back intoher pack and took out her water gourd. She drank deeply. Then she remembered thehealing salves that Alys had placed in the bottom of the pack. If she returnedthe gourd, she wouldn’t be able to reach the medicine. But she had no place toput the water container. She shook it, and realized there was little waterremaining. Finally, knowing there was a risk in this, she gulped the remainingliquid and dropped the empty gourd into the tunnel she had just climbed through.She could hear its single hollow thud against the wall as it fell, and thensilence.Now she was able to reach into the pack. First she removed her sandals, thelaces of which were tied together. She hung them around her neck and removed thecontainer of salve. It opened easily, and she smeared the healing paste thicklyon her wound. She returned the small clay pot, and the wad of bloody seaweed, tothe pack, which now dangled, near empty, from her shoulders.She felt ready to try again. The shadow of the gull had stopped passing over theopening. She hoped it had soared to the sea and wouldn’t return until it had abeak full of fish for its young. She would be fast. She planned it in her mind.She would lean from the opening, throw herself across the steep rock, and make aquick grasp of the hold beneath the nest. From there she had only to pullherself across quickly and to find the first step on the other side. He had toldher it was quite close. Easy to reach. She thought it through.One. Move quickly out of the mouth of the tunnel.Two. Reach with her left hand, arm stretched across the rock, under the nest andgrab the handhold firmly.Three. Push with her legs. Holding on with the one hand (how grateful she wasnow for all those months of arm strength exercises!), move across the cliffside. Feel with her toes for small ledges; they would help.Four. Find the first step and reach for it with her right hand. Then she couldmove her left arm away from the nest and go beyond the place where the gullwould see her as a threat.Time to start. From her brief glimpse of the sky when she had tried to reach thenest before she was attacked, she guessed that it was now very late in the day.She must do this quickly. Once she passed this danger, the end was in sight andshe could reach it before darkness.Go!Claire hoisted herself up until she was kneeling at the lip of the tunnel. Shereached across with her left arm quickly, into the debris that formed the thickbase of the nest. She found the knobby handhold there and grasped it. Thesquawking from the chicks became louder. They were frantic with fear.Holding tightly with her left hand, feeling the strength in her arm, which wouldnow briefly be her only support, she planted her feet firmly to push off andpropel herself across the rock.From the sky, its black wings folded tightly against it, the parent gull,summoned by its young, dove at her. She could see its pink legs folded againstthe white underparts, and the red spot at the tip of its razor-sharp yellowbill. But it was just a split second. The gull speared her arm, ripped at it,wrenched it loose from its hold. Claire screamed and fell back into the tunnel,instinctively using her feet once again to wedge herself against its walls.She was bleeding badly. She could see the bone of her arm exposed by the hugegash the bird had made when it tore at her with its beak.She leaned her head as low as possible and took deep, shuddering breaths. If shefainted, she would slide all the way back down the tunnel that it had taken herseveral hours to climb.She would not allow herself to faint.She would not allow herself to be killed by a bird.It came to her what she must do.She removed the container of salve again from her pack, opened it, and appliedit thickly to the gaping slice in her flesh. She used the salve as a paste tocompress the wadded seaweed against the wound. Still it bled. The little pot wasempty now and she let it drop, hearing it fall as the water gourd had. Shereached into the pack again and found nothing remaining there but thered-covered rock intended as a signal when she reached the top. She held itbetween her teeth while she used her knife to cut through the fabric of the packitself and made a strip of the leather. Then she placed the flat rock over theseaweed and held it fast there with the leather strip wrapped tightly around herinjured arm. She tested it, moving her arm in several ways, and the dressingstayed firm. Then she dropped the ruined pack down into the tunnel and itdisappeared into the darkness.Next she moved up to the top opening of the tunnel. The gull was circling,waiting. Claire ignored it. She uncoiled the rope that she had been carryinglooped around her shoulder. She made a noose.Then once again she planned what she was about to do. She did it in her mind,rehearsed it: this motion, then that. She knew she must be very, very fast.Another successful attack from the black-backed gull would bring about herdeath. She could not let that happen.When she was ready, she thought: Now. She lifted her upper body from the tunnellip, spun the noose, and let the rope fly. It was just a short distance, and heraim was accurate. She lassoed the nest, tightened the noose, and pulled. It wasstartlingly heavy for something made of twigs, seaweed, and grass. But itcrumpled, folded upon itself, and she ripped it from the rock, flinging itoutward into the air. She watched it, and the chicks, falling for a moment, andthe enormous gull swooping toward it and shrieking.Then she lifted herself, reached across, grabbed the now visible handhold withher uninjured arm, and pulled herself triumphantly across the cliff face and tothe steps that would lead her to the top."},{"pageContent":"SIXTEENClaire lay panting upon the solid earth. It was dark now. The attack of the gullhad consumed precious time, and when she reached the steps that would be thefinal climb, dusk had come. He had said “Don’t look down” because this very lastsection, although it was made relatively easy in its climb because of the oddoutcroppings that formed footholds, was sheer in its vertical drop. It couldhave been terrifying to look down and realize the distance that a fall would be.To lose your grip out of terror after such a dangerous and difficult day, tofall at the very end of it—that was what Einar feared. But she rose and lookeddown now from the edge at the top and saw nothing but darkness. Above her, thesky was filled with stars.She felt the wound on her neck. It was encrusted with dried blood and very sore,but she thought it was not a serious wound; she had seen worse on children whohad tumbled on rocks. Her arm was a greater concern. Gingerly she untied thetight leather strip and let it fall away. The flat rock was stuck to theseaweed, and she pried it loose carefully. Its red covering had been meant as asign that she was safe. She wondered if Einar would be able to see that it wasstained with her blood as well. She held it to her lips briefly, trying toimpart a message, a thank-you, a goodbye; then she threw it as hard as she couldout into the night beyond the cliff.She left the seaweed on the throbbing gash and retied the leather strip aroundit, using her teeth and her right hand. Then she put on her sandals. She was towait here, Einar had said, for dawn. At dawn the man would come, a strange manwearing a black cloak. He was the one who would take her to her son. Einar didnot know how. He only knew that the man had special powers. He came to peoplewho needed help, and offered himself.Claire was to say yes to the man. There would be a price. She must pay it, Einarsaid. There would be no choice. To decline the man would bring terriblepunishment upon her. Einar knew. The man had approached him, assessed howdesperately cold he was after the climb, seen that his toes were white withfrostbite, and offered—for a price they would agree upon—to provide him withwarmth, comfort, and transportation to whatever his destination might be. It wastempting. But Einar was both willful and proud. He had said no.“I don’t need you,” he had said. “I’m strong. I climbed out alone.”The man had offered again. “One more chance,” he said. “The price will besomething you can afford, I assure you. A fair trade.” But Einar, suddenlymistrustful, had again said no. Without warning he had found himself on theground, struck down and weakened by a mysterious power summoned by the man. Helay there unable to move, watching in horror while the man reached under hiscloak, withdrew a gleaming hatchet, and chopped off half of his right foot. Thenthe left.This was the person Claire was to wait for and say yes to. She moved carefully away from the cliff’s edge, feeling her way in the dark to amossy patch beside some bushes. She arranged herself there and fell into anexhausted sleep. When he came, it was morning, and she was still sleeping. Hetouched her arm and she woke.“Exquisite eyes,” he said when she opened them. Claire blinked. She stared athim. He was not what she had expected. He was ordinary. Somehow she had thoughthe would be powerful in appearance. Large. Frightening. Instead, he wasnarrow-shouldered and thin, with a sallow complexion and neatly trimmed darkhair. And for such a desolate place—she looked around and saw nothing but abarren landscape—he was oddly dressed, in a fashion that was unfamiliar to her.Behind the cloak that Einar had described she could see that he wore a tightlyfitted dark suit with sharp creases in the trousers. On his feet were highlypolished shoes of a fine leather. There were gloves on his hands, not knittedgloves such as those she was accustomed to wearing in winter, or the coarsegloves that had helped her grip the rope as she climbed. The man’s black gloveswere of a thin, silky fabric and molded to fit his slender fingers.The gloved hands frightened her. He was reaching for her arm, and Claire didn’twant to be touched by those sinuous, silk-encased fingers. She shrank back andrubbed her eyes (“exquisite eyes”? What did that mean?), then rose without hishelp and stood.He moved back slightly, facing her. Then he bowed, and his lipless mouthstretched into a mirthless smile. “Your name, I believe, is Claire,” he said.“And perhaps my presence comes as a surprise? Allow me—”She interrupted him. “No. I was told you would be here.” She could tell that theinterruption annoyed him. But she felt vulnerable and humiliated, standing therein her shredded clothing, bleeding from wounds and in need of his help. Shewanted to assert herself in some way.“Indeed. I am here at your service, prepared to offer a fulfillment of yourwishes, at a price to be negotiated to our mutual satisfaction.”Claire drew herself up. “I understand that,” she replied, and could see himstiffen with annoyance again. He wanted her to be weak, and needy. She swore toherself that she would not be. “You realize,” she went on, “that I have nothingof value to give to you.”“Shall we let me be the judge of that?” He spoke now in a threatening whisper.“If you wish,” Claire said.“Let us begin, then. Let us commence. Let us undertake to establish what it isthat you hope to achieve or acquire, what it is that I may provide to you forthis yet-to-be-determined price.”She could feel her resolve weaken, and her voice faltered as she told him. “Ihave a son,” she said. “I want to find my son.”“A son! How sweet. Maternal love is such a delicious trait. So you don’t wantriches, or romance, but simply . . . your son?” The way he said the word,hissing it, sneering it, made her feel sick.“I was told that you could help me.”“You have been informed correctly. Accurately and precisely. But! We must agreeon the price to be paid. The trade, do you see? A son in return for—”She made her voice as firm as she could. “I have nothing. You can see that. Iwas hoping—”To her horror he reached forward and grasped a thick handful of Claire’s longhair. She flinched.“What is this, then? You have beautiful hair. Luxuriant tresses, I would say.Sweet-smelling despite your recent ordeal. Do you call this nothing?”He put his face into her hair and inhaled. His breath was foul-smelling, andClaire willed herself not to step back in disgust. He was twisting the hair heheld and hurting her, but she stood her ground. Was that what he wanted? Justher hair? He was welcome to it. It was dirty and tangled and she would be gladto free herself of it, Claire thought.But he opened his gloved hand, released the handful of curls, and stood back tolook at her with his slitted, close-set eyes. Her first thought on meeting himhad been: ordinary. Now she saw that he was not ordinary at all but darklysinister. It was not just his breath that smelled. Suddenly he was enveloped ina rancid aroma so thick that it was almost foglike. His words seemed to oozefrom his lipless mouth.“Hardly a fair trade, is it? A head full of coppery curls in return for a livingboy? A son?” Had she imagined that his tongue darted in and out, like that of asnake, when he hissed the word?“No,” Claire agreed. “It doesn’t seem an equal trade. But as I told you, I havenothing.”“Nothing is such a pathetic word, isn’t it? But then, you are pathetic. Yourclothes are rags and you have a pustulous scab on your neck. Still . . .” Hehesitated. “My calling, my mission, my motivation and my very existence, is tocreate trades. This for that! Reciprocity!”The tongue flickered again as he drew out the word “reciprocity.” Claireshuddered but maintained her composure.“So you want your boy. Your son. Tell me his name.”“I’m sorry—I’m not certain. My memory has been damaged. I think he was calledBabe.”“Babe?” His voice was contemptuous. Claire felt as if she were failing a test.“Wait!” she said. “Maybe it was Abe! It was so long ago. It might have beenAbe!”“Abe, Babe . . .” The man’s body swayed as he repeated the words in a singsongvoice. Then he fell silent, moved close to her, leaned forward, and whisperedharshly. “I offer you this trade. I make the offer only once. Take it or leaveit. Ready?”Dreading what he was to say, Claire nodded. She had no choice.He grabbed her neck with his eerily smooth gloved hand, pressing into her woundso that pain sliced through her, and drew her face close to his. She could smellhis foul breath again. “I want your youth,” he said harshly into her ear, andhis warm saliva sprayed across her cheek.“Trade?” he murmured, still holding her in his awful embrace.“Yes,” Claire whispered.“Say it.”“Trade,” she said loudly.“Done.” He released her then and shoved her away from him. When he turned andwalked away, she understood that she was to follow. Surprisingly, she found itdifficult to walk. Her legs were weak. She couldn’t straighten her body easily.Had it been only twenty-four hours before that she had leapt from rock to rock,had climbed and grasped and pulled herself up the sheer cliff? Now she wasshuffling and bent, and it was hard to catch her breath. She struggled to keepup with the man, who was striding quickly ahead. Her hair fell forward over herface, and when she reached up to smooth it back, she saw that her hand hadchanged, had become veiny and spotted; and she saw, too, that the loosened hairwas no longer the thick red-gold curls he had admired a few minutes before. Nowit was a sparse handful of coarse gray.He paused, looked back, and smirked at her confusion. “Get a move on, you oldhag,” he said. “And by the way . . .”He watched her contemptuously as she made her way, shuffling around a boulder inthe path. “Your son’s name is Gabe,” he said.“And mine? My name,” he added, with a superior and hostile smile, “isTrademaster.”"},{"pageContent":"BOOK IIIBEYOND"},{"pageContent":"ONEThe old woman appeared frequently. Suddenly she would be there, standing in thethick pines beside the river, watching him as he worked. Gabe would catch sightof her, would see her dark homespun clothing, her stooped posture, and thefierce, knowing intimacy of her gaze. But then she would withdraw and disappearinto the shaded grove of trees. If he turned away and then looked back, therewas no longer a sign of her, not even a whispering motion in the needledbranches she had moved through. She simply went away. Sometimes he thought ofcalling after her, asking who she was, why she watched him. But for some reasonhe felt shy.He saw her in the village as well, but noticed her less there because he wasgenerally in the company of friends. He and the other boys, the group he livedwith, would be wrestling and joking, vying to be cleverest, or strongest, asthey made their way together to or from the schoolhouse. Sometimes the people ofthe village complained about them and their horseplay, said that they were anoisy, inconsiderate group, worse than any bunch of adolescents that had everlived in Boys’ Lodge. One neighbor had called them “louts” after they wrestedplums from the tree beside her cottage, then squashed them in the path.This particular old woman, though she was often nearby, never glared at thegroup of boys, as others did, or chided them for their behavior. She simplywatched. She had been doing it for a long time. And Gabe thought that shewatched him most of all. It puzzled him.Occasionally he thought about using his power—well, he never knew exactly whatto call it, but he thought of it as veering—to try to learn more about who shewas, why she watched him. But he never did. His power made him nervous. He foundveering tiring, painful, and a little frightening. So though he tested it nowand then, seeing if it was still there (and it always was; sometimes he foundhimself wishing it wouldn’t be), trying to understand it (and he never did, notreally), he rarely called it into full use.Anyway, she was gone. He was annoyed at himself for the time he had wasted,wondering about her, when he had so much to do, still. Sighing, Gabe lookedaround the clearing on the riverbank, the place he had claimed for his task, theplace where he was now spending hours every day. His bare feet were deep in woodshavings. He smiled at himself, realizing there was sawdust on his face, stuckthere by his own sweat. He licked his lips and tasted powdered cedar.The boards that he had crafted so carefully were neatly stacked, but his toolswere scattered about, and it looked from the graying clouds as if rain was onthe way. He heard a rumble of thunder. Time to get things into the shed. Buteven as he moved his tools, trudging back and forth to store them in theprimitive little structure he had built between two trees, he found himselfthinking again of the old woman.There were so few mysteries in the small village. When new residents arrived,there was always a ceremony of welcome. Their histories were told. He rememberednone for her, but he would have been a child then; he had seen the strange womanfor years now, had felt her eyes on him since he was a young boy. And he rarelyattended the ceremonies. Some of the histories were interesting, Gabe thought,especially if they involved danger and narrow escapes. But people rambled on,and sometimes they wept, which embarrassed him.I’ll stop being shy, he thought. Next time I notice her staring at me the wayshe does, I’ll simply introduce myself. Then she’ll have to tell me who she is.The rain began spattering suddenly. Gabe closed the crooked, hastily made doorof the shed he had built from old boards. Briefly he glanced back through theincreasing downpour, at the grove of trees where the woman stood from time totime. Then he closed the latch on the door of the shed and ran through the raintoward the village. “How’s the boat coming?” It was Simon, one of his friends, standing on the porchof Boys’ Lodge as Gabe climbed the steps and shook his head to try to get someof the wetness out of his curly hair.“All right, I guess. Slow.”He went inside to change into dry clothes. It would be time for dinner soon, hethought. There were no clocks in the village, but the bell tower rang atintervals, and the midafternoon bell had sounded some time ago. On a shelf inhis cubicle Gabe found a clean, folded shirt and put it on. He tossed his wetone into a bin in the hall.He lived in Boys’ Lodge with twelve other adolescent orphaned boys. Most of hislodge-mates had lost their parents to illness or accident, though one, Tarik,had been abandoned as an infant by an irresponsible couple who had no interestin raising a child. All of the boys had a history to tell. Gabe did too, but hedidn’t enjoy the telling; there were too many I-don’t-knows to it.He had asked Jonas again and again. It was Jonas who had brought him here yearsbefore, when Gabe was just an infant. “Why did my parents let you take me?” hehad asked.“You didn’t have parents,” Jonas had explained.“Everybody has parents!”“Not in the place where we lived. Things were different there.”“How about you? Did you have parents?”“I had people I called Mother and Father. I’d been assigned to them.”“Well, what about me?”“You hadn’t been assigned yet. You were a bit of a problem.”Gabe had grinned at that. He liked the idea of being troublesome. It seemed togive him a certain superiority.“I had to have parents, though. People don’t just get born from nothing.”“You know what, Gabe? I was just a boy then. Babies appeared from theinfant-care building and were given to parents. I accepted it. I never knewanything else. I never asked where the babies had come from.”Gabe had hooted with laughter. “Hah! Where do babies come from? Every kid asksthat!”Gabe was laughing, but Jonas had looked serious and concerned. “You’re right,”he said, slowly. “And I do remember that there were young girls chosen each yearto be what was called ‘birthmothers.’ They must have been the ones who . . .”“What happened to the birthmothers? What happened to my birthmother?”“I don’t know, Gabe.”“Didn’t she want me?”Jonas sighed. “I don’t know, Gabe. It was a different system—”“I’m going to find out.”“How?”Gabe was very young then, no more than nine. But he swaggered when he replied.“I’ll go back there. You can’t stop me. I’ll find a way.” Now that the boys had moved out of the Childhood Place where they had spenttheir first years, now that they were in Boys’ Lodge, their interests hadchanged and they rarely talked of their earlier years. It was girls who didthat, Gabe thought. At Girls’ Lodge, he heard, the girls talked long into theevening, retelling their own tales to each other. For the boys, though, talk nowwas of school, or of sports, or of the future, not the past.Boys’ Lodge was a congenial group. They did their schoolwork together in theevenings, and shared meals, their food prepared by a staff of two workers in thekitchen. There was a lodge director, a kindly man who had a room within thebuilding, and who mediated the infrequent disputes among the boys. One could goto him with problems. But Gabe often wished that he lived in a house with afamily, the way his best friend, Nathaniel, did. Nathaniel had parents, and twosisters; their house was noisy with bickering and laughter.Glancing through the window, through the rain that had now almost stopped, hecould see the house where Nathaniel lived, farther along the curved path. Itslittle garden was thick with summer flowers, and as he watched, a door openedand a gray cat was sent outside, where it assumed a pose, in the way of cats, onthe little porch and licked its paws. It was Deirdre’s cat. Gabe tried toremember its name; he could picture Nathaniel’s sister laughing when she hadtold it to him, but the whimsical name eluded him. Catacomb? Cataclysm? No. Butsomething like those. Deirdre was good with words.Pretty, too. Gabe flushed briefly, a little embarrassed at his own thoughts. Hewatched the cat, hoping that Deirdre would appear at the door. Maybe she wouldsit down and stroke the gray fur. Catapult! That was its name. He pictured herthere, stroking Catapult, gazing into the distance, maybe thinking about—him?Maybe? Could that be possible? Of course, he realized suddenly, he could veer,and find out. But maybe he didn’t really want to know? And anyway, there wasn’ttime. The dinner bell was about to ring. The other boys, laughing and noisy,would soon be rushing down the hallway.Also, Gabe reminded himself, shaking off the thoughts about Nathaniel’s pretty,dark-haired sister, it wasn’t fair to her, even if he found that she did careabout him. She shouldn’t. Very soon he would finish his boat. And then he wouldbe gone."},{"pageContent":"TWOYou know he’s building a boat.”Kira nodded. She had just gotten the children to sleep. They were so lively,into everything. Now that Annabelle could walk, she followed her two-year-oldbrother, Matthew, into all kinds of mischief. Kira was exhausted by evening. Shebrought her cup of tea, set her walking stick aside, and sat down beside Jonas,who looked troubled.“I know. I was here when he came for the books, remember?”Jonas glanced at the walls of the room. Shelves of books extended from the floorto the ceiling. And not just this room, but all the others in the house heshared with his family. It was one of the things they were trying now to teachthe children: not to pull and grab at the books. So tempting, for babies: thebright colors. He remembered when the dog, as a puppy, had indulged in the samemischief, and again and again they had found corners of the lower volumeschewed. Now Frolic was middle-aged, overweight, lazy, and no longer needing tochew. He slept, snoring, on his folded blanket most of the day, and it was thetoddlers who grabbed and gnawed.“I always knew this time would come,” Jonas said. “He told me when he was muchyounger that he would go looking for his past.”Kira nodded again. “Of course he wonders,” she pointed out. “It will be the nextgeneration, the ones like our children, who were born here, who won’t feel thatpull.”Both of them, like almost everyone in the small village, had come from anotherplace, had fled something, had escaped from hardship of some kind. Jonas stood.He stared through the window out into the night. Kira recognized the look. Herhusband had always had that need, to turn his gaze outward, trying to find theanswers to things. It was the first thing she had noticed about him: thepiercing blue eyes, and the way he had of seeming to see beyond what wasobvious. In their earlier days together, when Jonas was Leader, he had called onthat vision often for answers to problems. But the problems had fallen away, thevillage had thrived, and Jonas had relinquished leadership to others so that hecould take up an unburdened life with his family.Now he was the protector of the books and the knowledge. He was thescholar/librarian. It was Jonas to whom Gabriel had come not long ago, lookingfor books with diagrams and instructions, so that he could learn to build aboat.He sighed, turning away from the darkness that was enfolding the village. “Iworry about him,” he said.Kira set aside the needlework she had picked up. She went to him, circled herarms around his waist, and looked up into those solemn eyes that were as blue asher own. “Of course you do. You brought him here.” It had been years before thatJonas, hardly more than a boy himself then, had brought Gabriel—a toddler withno past, a child who deserved a future—to this village, which had welcomed themwith no questions.“He was so little. And he had no one.”“He had you.”“I was a boy. I couldn’t be a parent to him. I didn’t know what that meant. Thepeople who raised me did their best, but it was just a job to them.” Jonassighed, recalling the couple he had called Mother and Father. “I remember thatonce I asked them if they loved me,” he said.“And?”He shook his head. “They didn’t know what that meant. They said the word wasmeaningless.”“They did their best,” Kira said, after a moment, and he nodded.“Gabe’s older now than I was when I brought him here,” Jonas mused. “Stronger.Braver.”“Not as handsome, though.” She reached up, smiling, and smoothed a strand of hishair. Ordinarily he would have grinned back at her. But his face was worried andhis thoughts were elsewhere.“And I’m pretty sure he has a gift of some sort.”Kira sighed. She knew what that meant. She and Jonas both had a gift. Sometimesit was exhilarating, but it was demanding, too, and burdensome, to know how touse it well, and when.“I worry about what he’ll find, if he goes searching,” Jonas went on. “He wantsa family, and there won’t be one. He was a—” Frowning, he searched for the rightdescription. “He was a manufactured product,” he said at last. “We all were.”Kira sat silently. It was a chilling description. Finally, thoughtfully, shereplied. “All of us came here from difficult places,” she reminded him.“But you had a mother who loved you.”“I did. Until she died. Then I was all alone.”“But you had her, at least, for—how many years?”“Almost fifteen.”“That’s close to Gabe’s age now. He feels such a longing for something, and Iworry that he’ll never find it. That it never was there. But—” Jonas rose andwent to the window. Kira watched him as he stood there, looking out into thedarkness. Beyond him, she could see the outline of trees moving slightly in anight breeze against the dark starless sky. “But what?” she asked, when he hadstood silently for a long moment.“I’m not sure. I can feel something out there. Something connected to Gabe.”“Something dangerous?” she asked in an apprehensive tone. “We must warn him, ifthere’s something dangerous out there.”“No.” Jonas shook his head. He was still focusing on something beyond the room.“No. He’s not in danger. At least not now. But there is a presence. It seemsbenign. I think . . .” He paused. “I think something—someone—is looking for him.Or waiting? Waiting for him? Watching him?”He didn’t tell Kira what else he felt, because he didn’t comprehend it himself,and because he didn’t want to alarm her. But there was something else out there,something vaguely at the edges of his awareness, something not really connectedto Gabe. And the something else was vaguely familiar, and very dangerous."},{"pageContent":"THREEAt first, his friends had helped him. But that time had passed. Now they wereoff fishing, playing ball, indulging in all the usual summer pastimes duringthis brief holiday from school. The excitement of Gabe’s project wasshort-lived, and their interest waned when they realized he was not justhammering together a primitive raft that they could paddle along the riverbank.Gabe hummed to himself as he measured his boards. He had a vague picture in hismind of the way they should go together. But though the books he had borrowedfrom Jonas had shown boats of all kinds, from ones with billowy sails to long,narrow vessels with rows of seated men at oars, none had provided instructionsfor the building. His would be small, he knew. Just big enough for him and hissupplies. It would have a paddle; he had already begun carving one, crouched inhis little shed during rainy days.“Any chance you’d like to go fishing?”Gabe looked up at the sound of the voice. Nathaniel, tall and brown from thesun, was standing on the path, holding his gear. Often they had fished together,usually from a huge rock on the bank farther along. The river was easy to fish,slow moving and somewhat shallow there; the silvery, sinuous trout were eagerfor the bait, and made good eating later.It was tempting. But Gabe shook his head. “Can’t. I’m behind. This is slowergoing than I thought it would be.”“What’s that?” Nathaniel asked, pointing to the edge of the clearing where aleafy stack of thin poles waited.Gabe looked over. “Bamboo.”“You can’t build from that. You need real planks for a boat.”Gabe laughed. “I know. I’m using cedar. But I need the bamboo for . . . Well,here; I’ll show you.” He wiped his sweaty hands on the hem of his shirt and thenwent and got the large book from the shed.“Jonas let you bring it here?” Nathaniel asked in surprise.Gabe nodded. “I had to promise to keep it clean and dry.” He set the book on aflat rock, squatted there, and turned the pages. “Look,” he said, pointing to apage.Nathaniel looked at the picture of a large vessel with its many sails unfurled.The rigging was complicated, with countless lines and winches holding thebillowing sails in place, and a large crew of men could be seen on deck. “You’recrazy,” Nathaniel said. “You can’t build that.”Gabe chuckled. “No, no. I just wanted to show you. It’s not for rivers anyway.They sailed them once on oceans. I think we learned about it in history class.”Nathaniel nodded. “There were pirates,” he recalled. “That’s the part I paidattention to.”Gabe turned the pages slowly.He smiled. “Here’s mine,” he said, and he rifled the pages until the book openedto a page near the end, a place that had clearly been opened to frequently.“Don’t laugh.”But Nathaniel did, when he leaned down to look at the picture. Gabe, watchinghis face, chuckled as well. The picture was of a tiny boat, with one lone man,huge waves surging around him, shark fins visible in the foam. There was endlesssea and sky. The man looked terrified, and doomed.“So you’re planning your own death? Where is this guy, anyway?”“Ocean. But that’s far from here. I don’t need to think about ocean, just river.And I’m not going to end up like him. I’m just copying his boat, sort of. Mine’ssmaller, and doesn’t have that cabin part. Mine will be little, and sturdy.That’s all I’ll need. It’ll be easy to build.”Gabe looked around at the piles of boards, the sawdust, the mess on the ground.“Well, I thought it would be easy.”“How will you steer it?” Nathaniel asked, still peering at the picture of thelone man cowering in the boat as the waves approached.“Paddle. Anyway, the river will carry it. I won’t need to steer much. Just to goashore when I want to.”“So what’s the bamboo for?”“It’ll hold it together. I invented this system myself. Once I get the cedar allarranged in the right shape, I’ll use the bamboo—first I’ll wet it, so that whenit dries, it tightens—it’ll be like rope.”Nathaniel looked around. The cedar planks were lying haphazardly about, a few ofthem hammered together. He could see that Gabe had been preparing the bamboo,peeling and slicing it thin. It was a huge task for a boy to do alone.“Does anybody ever come and help you?”Gabriel hesitated. “Not really. Some old woman comes and watches me, though.” Hegestured toward the grove of pines. “She stands over there.”“An old woman?”“Yes. You’ve seen her. She’s all bent over and you can tell she has troublewalking. She sort of follows me. I don’t know why. Someday I’m going to yell ather to stop.”Nathaniel looked uneasy. He gave a nervous laugh. “You can’t yell at an oldwoman,” he said.“I know. I was kidding. Maybe I’ll just growl, and scare her a little.” Gabemade a face and growled loudly, imitating a beast of some kind.Both boys laughed.“Sure you don’t want to go fishing?” Nathaniel asked.Gabe shook his head and picked up the book to return it to the shed. “Can’t.”His friend gathered his things and turned away. “Deirdre says she misses you,”he remarked with a sly grin. “You’re never around lately.”Gabe sighed. He looked up the path as if he might see Nathaniel’s pretty sisterthere. “Will she come to the feast tomorrow night?”Nathaniel nodded and shouldered his fishing pole. “Everyone will. My mother’s atthe gathering place now, helping to get things ready.”“Tell Deirdre I’ll see her there.” Gabe gave his friend a wave and turned againto his work as the other boy walked away."},{"pageContent":"FOURFeasts were frequent in the village. Sometimes there was an excuse: Harvest,Midsummer, or a marriage. But often, no reason was necessary. People just wanteda time of merriment, laughter, dressing up, eating—and overeating—and so a feastwas planned.Kira dressed the children in bright-colored embroidered outfits that she haddesigned and stitched. She was a masterful seamstress. Many people sought herout to create their wedding clothes; and they still talked in the village aboutthe hand-woven cloth adorned with intricately patterned birds of all kinds inwhich she had wrapped the body of her father before his burial. Kira’s fatherhad been blind, and sound had been his life. He knew—and could imitate—eachbird’s call and song; they came from the trees, unafraid, to eat from hisoutstretched hands. The entire village had gathered to sing a farewell as he waslaid to rest, but the only song that day was theirs; the birds had fallensilent, as if they mourned.Her own garment for the feast was a deep blue dress; she entwined blue ribbonsthrough the straps of her sandals and in her long hair. Jonas smiled at her inadmiration and affection, but his own clothing, even on Feast Night, was simple:a homespun shirt over coarse trousers. With a roll of his eyes, he let his wifeattach a blue flower from the garden to his collar. Jonas was not fond ofdecoration. His tastes were plain.Annabelle and Matthew scampered about the large room, giggling, while Kirawrapped the pie she had baked and placed it in a basket she had adorned withdaisies and ferns. Frolic yawned and rose from the blanket where he’d beennapping. The dog sensed excitement and wanted to take part. Noticing, Kiralaughed, and leaned over to wind a stemmed flower around his neck. “There,” shesaid. “Now you’re in your party outfit too!” Tail wagging, Frolic followed thefamily as they set out from their house. Jonas carried the pie basket andMatthew rode atop his father’s shoulders. Annabelle held tightly to her mother’sfree hand, the hand that didn’t grasp the carved cane that Kira had alwaysneeded for walking. Ahead, beyond the curve of the path, they could already hearmusic—flutes and fiddles—from the gathering place where celebrations were held. It was a very small village that had had its beginnings years before in agathering of outcasts. Fleeing battles or chaos of all kinds, often wounded ordriven out by their own clans or villages, each of the original settlers hadmade his way to this place. They had found strength in one another, had formed acommunity. They had welcomed others.From time to time, as the years had passed, people muttered that they shouldn’tlet newcomers in; the village was becoming crowded, and it was hard, sometimes,for the newcomers to learn the customs and rules. There were arguments andpetitions and debates.What if my daughter wants to marry one of them?They talk with a funny accent.What if there aren’t enough jobs?Why should we have to support them while they’re learning our ways?It had been Jonas, during his time as Leader, who had gently but firmly remindedthe villagers that they had all been outsiders once. They had all come here fora new life. Eventually they had voted to remain what they had become: asanctuary, a place of welcome.As a child, Gabe had yawned and fidgeted when his class was taken, as eachschool class was, to visit the village museum and learn the history. History wasboring, he thought. He was embarrassed when the museum curator, pointing tovarious artifacts in the “Vehicles of Arrival” exhibit, had gestured to thebattered red sled and explained that a brave boy named Jonas had battled ablizzard and fought his way here carrying a dying baby.“And today we all know that Jonas has become our village Leader, and the baby herescued and brought here is a healthy boy,” the curator had said dramatically,“named Gabriel.” His classmates grinned at him. They poked each other andgiggled. Gabe pretended to be bored. He averted his eyes and leaned down toscratch an imaginary bug bite on his leg.Most of the earliest settlers, those with their histories recorded in themuseum, had grown old and were gone now. Kira’s father, Christopher, was buriedin the village cemetery beside the pine grove. Left for dead by his enemies in adistant community, he had stumbled, sightless, to this village and been saved;with his new name of Seer, he had lived a long life here of dignity and wisdom.Kira tended his grave now, taking the babies with her while she weeded andwatered the soft blanket of fragrant purple thyme she had planted there.He was buried beside his adopted son, Matty. The villagers remembered Matty as afun-loving young man who had been destroyed when he fought the evil, unknowableforces that had menaced the village in those harsher times, seven years earlier.Thinking of those times as he passed the cemetery on his way to the evening’sfestivities, Gabe recalled the day Matty’s body had been found and carried home.Gabe had been young then, only eight, a rambunctious resident of the Children’sHouse, happiest with solitary adventures and disinterested in schoolwork. But hehad always admired Matty, who had tended and helped Seer with such devotion andundertaken village tasks with energy and good humor. It had been Matty who hadtaught Gabe to bait a hook and cast his line from the fishing rock, Matty whohad shown him how to make a kite and catch the wind with it. The day of hisdeath, Gabe had huddled, heartbroken, in the shadow of a thick stand of treesand watched as the villagers lined the path and bowed their heads in respect towatch the litter carrying the ravaged body move slowly through. Frightened byhis own feelings, he had listened mutely to the wails of grief that permeatedthe community.That day had changed him. It had changed the entire village. Shaken by the deathof a boy they had loved, each person had found ways to be more worthy of thesacrifice he had made. They had become kinder, more careful, more attentive toone another. They had worked hard to eradicate customs that had begun to corrupttheir society, banning even seemingly benign diversions such as a gamingmachine, a simple gambling device that spit out candy to its winners.For years a mysterious, sinister man known as Trademaster had appeared now andthen in the village, bringing tawdry thrills and temptations but leaving chaosand discontentment behind. It had been Jonas, as Leader, who saw through him,who sensed the deep evil in the man and insisted on his banishment.Freed of the menacing greed and self-indulgence that had almost overwhelmed themduring that time, the villagers had learned to celebrate themselves, as theywere doing this evening.Gabe stood still in the path for a moment. He noticed a small bouquet of freshflowers beside the stone into which Matty’s name had been carved. The villagepeople honored Matty’s memory with such tokens because he had made them intobetter people. Gabe did so more privately. He did so by reminding himself of aconversation he had once had with the older boy he had so admired.“You must pay more attention in school, Gabe,” Matty had told him. Gabe had beenrequired to stay late after classes that day, for extra help. Now they weresitting together on the outcropping of rock at the edge of the river.“I don’t like school,” Gabe had replied, feeling the fishing line between hisfingers.“I didn’t either. And I was willful and full of mischief, same as you. But Seermade me work at it because he cared about me so much.”Gabe shrugged. “Nobody cares about me.”“Leader does. I do.”“I guess,” Gabe acknowledged.“He’s the one who brought you here. He had a hard time of it too.”Gabe rolled his eyes. “Did you hear that at the museum as part of the tour? Iwish they’d stop telling that stupid story. And give me another worm, would you?Mine wiggled off the hook.”Patiently Matty had helped him to rebait his hook. “You need knowledge,” hesaid. “That’s how Jonas got to be Leader, by studying.”“I don’t want to be Leader.”“Neither do I. But I want to know stuff. Don’t you?”Gabe sighed. “Some stuff, maybe. Not math. Not grammar.”Matty had laughed. Then he had turned serious again for a moment. “And Gabe?”“What?”“You’re going to find that you have a gift of some kind. Some of us do, andyou’re going to be one. I can tell.”Gabe busied himself with the worm and the hook. For some reason the conversationhad begun to make him self-conscious.“I know,” Matty said, “it’s hard to talk about it because it’s hard tounderstand. But it’s another reason why you must study. You must make yourselfready. Someday you’ll be called upon for something special. Maybe somethingdangerous. So you have to prepare yourself, Gabe. You’ll need knowledge.”“Look,” Gabe said loudly, changing the subject, and pointed. “There’s a bigtrout over there where the rock makes a shadow. He’s hiding. But he sees us.Look at his eyes.”Matty sighed affectionately and turned his attention to the large fish suspendedin the dark water by the rock. It withdrew further, as if it felt their suddeninterest, and its shiny eyes darted back and forth. Matty watched. “He thinks hecan escape us by lurking there in the dark. But not us, Gabe! We’re too cleverfor him. Let’s do it. Let’s try to get him.”Thinking of it now, Gabe remembered it all: the laughter, the puzzlingconversation, the sunshine that day, the sound of the slow-moving river, andthen their stealthy maneuvers as they stalked the huge, silvery fish, finallycaught him, and then threw him back. It had all been years ago, and they hadnever had another chance to talk in that way.Matty had been correct, though, about needing to learn stuff. Gabe had triedhard to settle into his studies, and it served him well now, the math he hadhated, as he measured and fitted together the pieces of his boat.But he found himself wishing now that he had not felt so awkward, that he hadconfided in Matty that day. He had just discovered it then, the power that hehad, the power to veer, and was still confused by it.It had been at a feast, one of the usual celebrations. Probably Midsummer, hethought now, remembering it. With the other boys his age, eight and nine, he hadjoined the crowd watching a contest. Two of the village men were wrestling.Their bodies were smeared with oil so that their hands slid as they tried tograsp at each other. The crowd shouted encouragement and the men repositionedthemselves, shifting on their feet, each waiting for the right instant, theright move, to topple the other and emerge as the winner. Gabe, watchingintently, found his own bare feet shifting in the dirt; he panted, imitating thewrestlers. He focused on his own favorite, the man called Miller, who was incharge of grain production each fall. Miller was a large man and a likable onewho sometimes on slow workdays organized the boys into teams and taught themintricate games on the playing field. Even in the midst of this intense match,Miller was laughing as he caught his opponent in a hold and struggled to downhim.Gabe, moving his own skinny body in imitation of the wrestlers, found himselfwondering how it felt to be Miller: to be so strong, so in command of hismuscles and limbs. Suddenly an odd silence enveloped him. He stopped hearing thegrunts of the wrestlers, the shouts of the crowd, the barking of dogs, the musicfrom the fiddlers preparing nearby. And he felt himself move, in the silence. Heveered—though the word had not yet come to him then—and entered Miller. BecameMiller. Experienced Miller. Was Miller for that instant. He knew, briefly, howit felt to be strong, to be in command, to be winning, to be loving the battleand the coming win.Then sound returned. Gabe returned. The crowd roared in approval and Millerstood with his arms raised, victorious, then leaned forward and helped hislaughing opponent up. Gabe slid to the ground and huddled there in the cheeringcrowd, breathing hard, exhausted, confused, and exhilarated.After that day it had happened again, several times, until he could feel itcoming, and then—later—found that he could command and control the veer. Once,he remembered guiltily, he tried to use it to cheat in school. Seated at hisdesk, floundering over a math test—fractions, which he had not studied the wayhe should have—he glanced up at Mentor, the schoolmaster. Mentor was standingnear the window, looking at the board on which the test questions had beenwritten.If I could veer into Mentor right now, enter Mentor, Gabe thought, I could graball of the answers to these test problems. He concentrated. He closed his eyesand thought about Mentor, about his knowledge, about what it would feel like tobe Mentor. Sure enough, the silence came. He felt his consciousness shift andmove toward the schoolmaster. Within seconds he was there, within the man,experiencing being Mentor.The veer worked. But not in the way Gabe had planned. He found no math answersthere. Instead he had an overwhelming feeling of a kind of passion: forknowledge, for learning of all sorts—and for the children who sat that day atthe small desks, as Gabe did. He felt Mentor’s love for his students and hishopes for them and what they would learn from him.The veer ended suddenly, as it always did, and Gabe put his head into his hands.The sounds of the classroom returned, and the schoolmaster appeared beside him.“Are you all right, Gabriel?”Gabe found himself shaking. He had tears in his eyes. “I don’t feel well,” hewhispered.Mentor excused him for the rest of the day and Gabe walked slowly away from theschoolhouse, promising himself that he would study, that he would not disappointhis teacher again as he had so often in the past.He never told anyone. Veering seemed a private act, something to both savor andsometimes dread alone.Now, though, he found himself wishing he had confided in Matty when he’d had theopportunity. Not only about the veer. He wished he had told Matty about howdesperately he yearned to know about his mother. He couldn’t tell hislodge-mates; they would laugh. But Matty would have understood. And it waslonely, to yearn so, all alone.He reached down into the path, picked up a small pebble, and tossed it towardMatty’s gravestone. It tapped lightly against the rock and fell to the groundwhere other pebbles lay near the flowers. He had thrown each of them. “Hi,” Gabewhispered.Ahead, from the Pavilion where gatherings were held, he heard music and thehappy shouts of children. He thought of his friends, of the games they werealready playing, and of the contests and dancing later. He thought of prettyDeirdre with the sprinkling of freckles across her nose. He saw smoke and couldsmell the pigs that had been roasting on a spit most of the day. He knew Kirawould have made a pie, and there would be thick cream swirled with honey tomound on top of it. Gabe left the cemetery and his somber thoughts behind himand began to run toward the party."},{"pageContent":"FIVEHer back ached badly. It had ached for a long time now, for several years, butit was getting worse, and Claire had difficulty straightening herself. Shewalked bent.She had gone to see Herbalist, the man who dispensed medicines to villagers. Butit was clear that his remedies were the same that she had learned in her yearswith Alys. The drinking of birch and willow tea would ease the pain a bit butcould not take it away.Herbalist had asked her the obvious question: “What is your age?”“I don’t know,” she replied to him. That was true. She had been a young girlwhen she was washed from the sea to the place where she had lived for years. Shehad grown up there and become a young woman. She had left there and become,overnight, old. It was not a question of years.Herbalist was not surprised by her answer. Many people who had found their wayto the village had little memory of their own past. He prescribed the barkinfusions for her aches but said to her, “Such pain comes for us all, in greatage.”“I know,” Claire said. She had no wish to explain what had befallen her.Herbalist lifted her arm gently and felt the thin, sagging skin. Carefully heexamined the dark spots on the backs of her hands. “Do you still have teeth?” heasked.“Some,” she said, and showed him.“And your eyes? Ears?”She could still see and hear.“So,” Herbalist said with a smile, “you can’t dance or chew meat. But if you canhear the birds sing and watch the wind in the leaves, then you still have muchpleasure left.“Your time is limited now, though,” he told her, “so you should enjoy everythingyou can. That’s what I do. I think I must be as old as you. I have the sameaches.” He wrapped the dried barks for her, and she placed them in her carryingbasket.“I’ll see you at the feast,” he said as she turned to go. “We can watch thedancing and remember our young years. There is pleasure in that.”Claire thanked him, leaned on her cane, and continued down the path to her smallcottage. In the distance she could hear some young boys shouting as they playedsome sort of game with a ball. Perhaps one was Gabe. She rarely found him atgames, lately, though; most often he was alone in the clearing near the river,hammering away on the misshapen vessel that he called his boat. Claire oftenstood hidden in the trees and watched him at work. In a way she admired hisdedication to the odd project. But it saddened and puzzled her, his wish to begone.When she had entered the village for the first time, like so many others, shehad been welcomed, years before. The fragility of old age was new to her then,and it had still startled her when she rose in the morning with her bones achingand stiff. The memory of running, climbing, even dancing, was alive andthrobbing within her, but frailty made her hobble and limp.She had seen her son for the first time, in this place, when he was a child ofeight or nine. She remembered that day. He ran along the path near the cottageto which she had been assigned, calling to his friends, laughing, his unkempthair bright in the sunlight. “Gabe!” she heard a boy call; but she would haveknown him without hearing it. It was the same smile she remembered, the samesilvery laugh.She had moved forward in that moment, intending to rush to him, to greet andembrace him. Perhaps she would make the silly face, the one with which they hadonce mimicked each other. But when she started eagerly toward him, she forgother own weakness; her dragging foot caught on a stone and she stumbled clumsily.Quickly she righted herself, but in that moment she saw him glance toward her,then look away in disinterest. As if looking through his eyes, she perceived herown withered skin, her sparse gray hair, the awkward gait with which she moved.She stayed silent, and turned away, thinking.Did he need to know, after all? He appeared to be a happy child. If she were tomake herself known, to tell her unbelievable story, he would be stunned,uncomprehending. His friends might taunt him. Perhaps he would reject her. Orworse—perhaps he would feel obligated to tend her in her remaining days. Hiscarefree life would be interrupted. She would be a burden, an embarrassment.In the end she decided that it was enough that she had found him. She would lethim be. But she realized then the magnitude of the cruel exchange Trademasterhad offered her.Through the years she had watched Gabe grow from a mischievous boy into thisquiet young man who now seemed to have a mission she didn’t understand. Why aboat? The river was a dangerous thing. The village children could swim and playin the one protected section where the water was shallow and slow. But fartherout, and farther along, the water rushed furiously over sharp rocks. She hadheard that there was a steep waterfall someplace, and fallen trees here andthere that could easily smash the thin boards he was so carefully tying togetherwith strips of bamboo.Claire was very frightened of swift-moving water. She had reason to be. She hadonce lived beside a river, once beside a sea. Both had brought her heartbreakand loss.She did not want her son to be lost to water. The crisp-skinned pork, sliced from the roasted pig on the spit, smelleddelicious, but she knew it was not for her, not with her remaining teeth looseand her gums sore. Claire filled her plate from a large bowl of soft beans thathad been baking all day in a sauce of tomatoes and herbs, and added a piece ofsoft bread. She would leave room, though, she thought, for a slice of blackberrypie.She set her plate on a table and eased herself onto a bench next to severalothers. A pregnant woman smiled at her and moved slightly, making room; Clairerecognized her as Jean, the wife of one of the fiddlers who were tuning theirinstruments and preparing to play for the dancing. Kira was there too, keepingan eye on her toddlers as they played near the table. From time to time shespooned food into their mouths, as if they were baby birds.Eating slowly, watching the young women at her table, Claire realized that shemight have been one of them. She looked down at her own gnarled hand holding afork. An old woman’s hand. Herbalist had told her she was nearing her last days,and she sensed that it was true. But inside herself? She was a young womanstill. If she had not made the trade that had brought her here (Youth! In hermemory Claire could hear still how Trademaster had breathed the word into herear, had spat against her cheek with it, how she had nodded in assent andwhispered to him: Trade) she would perhaps be back with Einar now, helping himtend his lambs, cooking a stew they would share in their hillside hut, talkingtogether by the fire in the evenings.But she would not have found her son. She would never have seen Gabe again,would not have watched him grow into the lively young man he had become. Sheknew it was a trade she would make again, given the chance.She rose to return her emptied plate, to get herself a piece of pie, and lookedover to the table where the boisterous young boys were sitting together. He wasthere. She saw him glance sideways at her as she passed; then his attentionreturned to his plate, heaped as it was with food, and to a lengthy joke one ofhis friends was telling. In adolescence Gabe was gangly and tall, and as shewatched, his elbow knocked over the mug holding his drink; the other boyschortled as he sheepishly mopped up the mess with his napkin.His hair was curly, as hers—now a sparse bun at the back of her head—had oncebeen. His blue eyes were surprisingly pale. Jonas had the same eyes. So did hiswife, Kira. Claire remembered now that she had noticed the unusual eyes whenGabe was an infant. Those early days had come back to her very slowly, and withpain attached to each memory.The feel of the mask clamped over her face during his birth. She had shudderedwhen that memory returned.How, later, she had held him for the first time, and had noticed the startlingpale eyes. When she recalled it, she was suffused with a feeling of loss.Then she remembered a dream she had had, of a hidden light-eyed baby. How, inthe dream, she had kept him concealed in a drawer. Thinking of it after all thistime, she almost wept at the sadness of all it implied.She did weep when the next memory came back: of how he had grinned and wiggledhis chubby fingers at her. He had learned by then to say her name. Claire, hehad said in his high voice. And: Bye-bye. She did not regret the trade she had made in order to find him. But she wasdesperately sad to realize that her time was short now. Instead of the strongand vibrant young woman she should be, the mother Gabe deserved, she was now anancient hag waiting for death. It was a hideous joke that Trademaster had playedon them both seven years before.The sky darkened as night fell and the music began in earnest. Soon it would bethe time for the young people, the time for dancing and flirtation. Claire sawGabe rise from his seat and make his way over to the pretty freckle-faced girlnamed Deirdre. He stood self-consciously talking to her as she helped to cleanthe tables. She could see that Deirdre was self-conscious too, but that shepurposely walked in a way that made her striped skirt twirl and flutter.Women gathered their dishes and babies in order to take them home. Clairewatched Kira with the children. Annabelle was half asleep in her arms, butMatthew was dashing about wildly. Finally Jonas scooped him up and laughed asthe overtired two-year-old kicked and cried. Together they gathered their thingsand called good night, then started down the path from the Pavilion toward theirhome. Jonas had set Matthew on his shoulders and the couple became silhouettesagainst the sky as the moon rose and Claire watched.Although Jonas had no awareness of who she had once been, that once she and hehad been contemporaries in the same community, Claire remembered Jonas as a boy.He was too young for fatherhood then; nonetheless, it had been he who had saveda baby sentenced to die because the little one was eager, and curious, andlively. Because he didn’t sleep. He was—what was the word?—disruptive. Didn’tfit in. Jonas had risked his own life, sacrificed his future, to bring him here.She wondered if he worried about Gabe now, about the frailty of the little boathe was striving to build and the dangers he would face if somehow he launched itinto the river.When she rose from her seat in order to start down the path to her own cottage,her hip had stiffened and she stood for a moment massaging it with her handbefore she was able to walk. Finally she started down the gentle hill, carefullyfeeling her way in the moonlight. How soon she would be gone, Claire thought,and sighed. How little Gabe would ever know about his own past.Then she stopped, suddenly, and stood still. Of course, she thought. She knewwhat she would do.She decided she would tell her story, her own history that she had kept sosecret until now, to Jonas. Someday, after she was gone, if the time was everright, when the boy was old enough and ready, he could pass it on to her son."},{"pageContent":"SIXTrademaster?”Jonas looked astonished.He had listened now for a long time. He was sitting with Claire on a bench in asecluded area behind the library. She had thought about how much to tell him,how to tell him, and finally, ten days after the feast, she had approached Jonasand asked if she could talk to him alone. He had brought her here late on a dampmorning, carefully wiping the moisture from the bench and helping her to sitcomfortably.She hadn’t known exactly how to begin. Finally she said, “I knew you when youwere a boy.”Jonas smiled. “I didn’t realize you were here then. I thought you came to thevillage more recently. I would have guessed, oh, five or six years ago. But welose track of time, don’t we?”“No,” Claire said. “You’re right. I arrived here close to seven years ago. But Ihad known you long before then. Back in the community where you had grown up.”He looked more closely at her. “I’m sorry not to recognize you,” he said. “I wasa child there, of course. I left there after I turned twelve. But I did many ofmy volunteer hours in the House of the Old. Were you there then? I remember awoman named . . . What was it? Larissa? That was it. Did you know her?”Claire shook her head. “No,” she murmured. This was so hard. How could shedescribe to him something that would be almost impossible to believe?She sighed, and kneaded her hands, which ached. It was midmorning. Often herjoints ached in the morning. She cleared her throat. Her voice, she knew, was anold person’s voice now, too soft sometimes, too tentative. But she took a deepbreath and tried to speak firmly, to make him listen, to make him understand theincomprehensible.“My ceremony was three years before yours.”“Your ceremony?”“The Ceremony of Twelve.”“But—”She held up her hand. “Shhh. Just listen.”Jonas, looking confused, fell silent.“I received my Assignment when I turned twelve. I was assigned Birthmother.” Shepaused. “That was a disappointment, of course. But I had not been a goodstudent.”She could see that he was still puzzling over her words. There was nothing to dobut go on. “After a while, when I was deemed ready, I moved into the birthingunit.”Around them, the pace of the village continued. Some women were gossiping asthey weeded in the community garden. Nearby, small children played with somepuppies. From Boys’ Lodge, the usual group emerged and ran down the path,calling laughing insults to one another. Gabe was not among them. He had gone tohis place by the river much earlier and was alone there, fitting the last partsof his odd little boat into place.All of this fell away from their awareness as Jonas and Claire sat together. Shetalked. He listened attentively. Now and then he interrupted her softly to ask aquestion. The pills. When did she stop taking the pills?“I did too. I just threw them away,” he told her. “Did you feel the change?”“I felt different from the others. But I was already different in so many ways.”He nodded. She could tell that he was slowly accepting the story she was tellinghim. But she saw him look carefully at her, at her thin gray hair, her stoopedshoulders and gnarled hands, and knew that he could not comprehend yet how shehad become what she now was.She told him of her work at the fish hatchery, after her discharge from theBirthing Center. Of her search for Gabe, and her visits to him.She described how the infant had begun to say her name. How he laughed at thefunny face she made, and tried to imitate it. Claire thrust her tongue into hercheek and made the face for Jonas.He looked startled. “I remember it!” he told her. “When he and I weretogether—you know he stayed in my dwelling at night?”“I know.”“Sometimes he made that funny face for me. But of course I didn’t know—” Hepaused, still trying to comprehend.She continued her story.The midday bell rang. Villagers began to gather for lunch. Jonas and Claireignored it.“Will Kira be wondering where you are?”He shook his head. “No. She was taking the children on a picnic with somefriends. Please—go on. Unless you’re hungry. Would you like to stop for lunch?”Claire said no. “I don’t have much of an appetite anymore.”“You’re too thin.”“I eat very little. Herbalist says it’s not unusual for someone my age. It’spart of the natural process.”“Your age?” Jonas asked. “But you were three years older than I was! Whathappened?”“We’ll get to that. Then you’ll understand.”She went on with the telling. It would take a long time. She felt that in orderto understand, he must know every detail. The day cleared and a pale sun dried the moisture. By late afternoon, theshadows had lengthened and they were sitting in deep shade. The air had turnedcool. Jonas had placed his jacket across Claire’s shoulders. She was very tiredby now, but felt oddly invigorated by relating the story to someone at last. Ithad been her secret, her private burden, for years. She told it slowly, and hedidn’t hurry her. Now and then she had paused to rest. He had brought her water,and a biscuit. The entire day had belonged to them and to her story.She described the torturous climb up the cliff at length, feeling the need torelive it inch by inch as Einar had told her he had, remembering each handhold,each precipice and narrow ledge. Talking slowly, she felt the muscles in herarms and legs respond to the memory. Jonas noticed it, how she shifted her bodyas in her mind she made the climb again. He winced when she told of the attackby the bird. She showed him the scar on her neck.Finally, as exhausted almost by the telling as she had been when she reached thetop of the cliff that long-ago dawn, she described the terrible trade she hadmade. Jonas leaned forward, his elbows on his knees, and put his face into his hands.“Trademaster,” he said. “I thought he was gone. We banished him from the villagea long time ago. I was Leader then.”“Who is he?” Claire asked.He didn’t respond. He stayed silent, looking now into a distant place, a placethat Claire couldn’t see.“I should have known,” he said, after a moment. “I felt something out there,something related to Gabe, but I didn’t realize what it was. I think I wasfeeling your presence,” he mused, “and that was puzzling, but benign. But thereis something else. Something malignant. It must be him.”“Who is he?” Claire asked again.“He is Evil. I don’t know how else to describe it. He is Evil, and like allevil, he has enormous power. He tempts. He taunts. And he takes.“Gabe has your same eyes,” Claire said suddenly. “You and Gabe have the samepale eyes.”“My eyes?” he said, answering her. “They see beyond the places most people cansee. I’m told it’s my gift, that there are others with different gifts. And yes,Gabe has the same eyes. Sometimes I wonder—”From the top of a pine tree near the river, a large bird suddenly lifted itselfand swooped past them in the late golden light.“Were you scared of birds at first?” Claire asked him suddenly.“What?”“When you ran away from the community. When you first saw birds. Were youscared?”Jonas nodded. “Just at first. And other things too. I remember the first time Isaw a fox. Gabe was so little; he wasn’t afraid of anything. It was all new andexciting to him.”Claire realized suddenly that he was talking to her in a different way. He hadknown her since she had arrived in the community and he had always spoken to herin a kindly fashion. He had been helpful and patient: a young man to an oldwoman. But they had never been more than acquaintances. Now they werereminiscing together as old friends who had just reunited.“I thought of taking him,” she confessed. “But I didn’t know how to hide him, orwhere I could go. And then your father showed me that he wore a special braceleton his ankle, so I realized that I’d be caught if I tried to take him.”“Yes. An electronic bracelet.”Claire frowned. “I don’t remember what that means. What it was.”“There was so much in the community that isn’t part of our lives anymore. Butthat’s what our memories consist of: small things,” Jonas said.“My bicycle. I haven’t seen a bicycle since then. Except the one in the museum.That was—”“My father’s bike. I stole it. It had a seat for Gabe.”Claire nodded. “Yes. In my memory I can see him riding in it. He held a toy.”Jonas laughed. “His hippo.”“He called it Po, didn’t he? It’s coming back now.”“Yes. Po.”Now she could almost hear and see it: the dimpled hands clutching the stuffedtoy; the high, happy voice. “Did you take the hippo with you when you escaped?”Jonas shook his head. “I couldn’t. It all happened so fast. I discovered theywere going to release . . . No. Not release. They were going to kill Gabe. Itook him and fled. And I had to take food. There was no room for anything else.”“I would have gone with you, if I’d known. Things would be different now if Ihad.” She shifted on the bench and rubbed her sore hip. “I wish—” But then shefell silent.Jonas was quiet. He didn’t reply.“I was so frightened of birds,” she said suddenly. “Of their feathers and beaks.Then Einar brought me one, in a cage, as a pet. I named it Yellow-wing.”“Einar? He was the one who—”“Yes, the one who prepared me for the climb out.” Her eyes went to her feet,thick and bunioned in primitive sandals. She pulled them back beneath the benchto hide them. He knew she was remembering how limber she had been then, howbalanced and sure.“I loved Einar,” she told him.“Do you wish you had stayed?” Jonas asked her after a moment.“No,” she said firmly. “But I wish it had not been Evil that brought me here.” Jonas helped her up from the bench, his hand under her arm. They had beensitting together for a long time, and Claire was stiff. She stretched slowly andtook a deep breath.“Are you all right?” he asked, looking at her with concern.She nodded. “I’ll be all right in a minute. My heart’s fluttery sometimes. AndI’m just a little slow to get moving.”Jonas continued looking at her. “I remember you,” he said, after a moment.“We never spoke to each other,” Claire pointed out.They began to walk slowly. He was seeing her home.“No. But I saw you. My father mentioned you—the girl who came now and then tothe nurturing center, and played with Gabe. He pointed you out to me one time. Ithink you rode past on your bike, and he said, ‘That’s the one.’”“It seems so strange, to realize who you are. He pointed you out to me: ‘That’smy son,’ he said. He told me your name. It brings it all back, those days in thecommunity.”“I don’t think about it anymore. I’ve made a life here, where it’s sodifferent.”“So has Gabe.”Jonas nodded. “He doesn’t remember the community.”“It’s just as well.”“I’m not certain. It frustrates him, not having a past, or a family.”“So he’s wondered?”“More than wondered,” Jonas told her. “He has a passionate need to figure outhis past. I try to tell him what he wants to know, but it’s never been enough.That’s why he’s building the boat. I told him we had lived by a river, perhapsthis same river. He’s determined to find his way back.”They both fell silent.“Then we must—”“Maybe together we—”They had both spoken at the same time, and they were both saying the same thing:We must try to tell all of this to Gabe. Together we can help him understand.But there was not time to discuss it. They were interrupted by the shouts ofboys, excited, perhaps alarmed. The noise was coming from the riverside, theplace where Gabe had been working for weeks on the little boat."},{"pageContent":"SEVENGabe hadn’t wanted an audience for the launch. He wasn’t certain the boat wascompletely ready, and he didn’t want to be humiliated if anything went wrong.His plan was to sneak away alone. Yesterday he had moved the boat closer to thewater, shoving it across some underbrush. Now it was lying on a low, muddysection of the bank. The paddle was resting diagonally inside.The picture in his book, the book he had borrowed from Jonas, showed the loneman in the ocean, lying doomed in his small boat. His arms were taut andmuscled, but useless; it was clear that the huge waves were going to be the ruinof him. He had no paddle, Gabe had thought, looking intently at the painting.Maybe he lost it. Or maybe he forgot to bring one? There was no way the mancould save himself in that overwhelming sea. He needed a paddle.For a foolish moment Gabe focused intensely and tried to veer into the pictureof the painted man, to know how it felt to be afloat, to be about to die in thesea—and to know it while safe himself, able to end the veer when he chose. Justto feel the fear briefly, and the movement of the churning waves.But it didn’t work. The man was not real. He was the painter’s idea of a man,simply daubs of paint, nothing more. A painted man who needed a paddle.Gabe was proud of the paddle he had made. He was proud of the entire boat, buthe realized it was a rough, primitive construction. The paddle was different. Hehad felt very fortunate to have found a slender young cedar that broadened atits base: just the right potential for his plan. Carefully he had cut the treedown and then shaped the paddle from its trunk. It seemed to take forever. Buthe carried it back and forth to Boys’ Lodge and was able to work on it there inthe evenings: carving carefully, smoothing, shaping. His friends, even those whoridiculed his boat, were impressed with the paddle, with its sweet, cedarysmell, its graceful curved edges, and the sheen of its wood now that he hadrubbed it with oil.“Can I carve my name on it? Just small, but so you can remember me?” Nathanielhad asked. Gabe had agreed, and watched while his friend carved his namemeticulously.Then Simon asked, and Tarik, and others. Even those boys who had made fun of hisproject now took pains to add their signature.Watching them, Gabe found that he could make tiny veers into each of the boys asthey bent over the paddle, carving carefully. He could feel their feelings.I don’t think he’ll make it, he felt Nathaniel worrying. He might die in theriver.I hope he finds his mother, he felt from Tarik. He wants it so badly.He’s something of a fool. But he’s courageous, I’ll say that for him. I wish Ihad his courage. Gabe was surprised to feel that from Simon, who had beenscornful of the whole project.At the last, he had shyly asked Jonas to carve his name as well. He felt Jonas’sfear for him, but Jonas gave no sign. His face was calm, and he smiled when hehanded the paddle back with his name inscribed.He had left a rounded knob at one end for a handhold. The other end fanned outinto a broad triangle. He had stood on the bank by the water and dipped it in,pulling it through to feel the river’s resistance. It required strength. ButGabe was strong. In recent months he had begun to fill out; his muscles werefirm and his energy boundless.He had been delayed after lunch by some chores he had left undone. Grumpily hefolded his laundry, put it away, and straightened his room. Now, heading back tothe river, he assessed the weather. The misty morning had cleared and throughthe clouds a bit of sun made a narrow glint of light. The river would be smooth,Gabe thought. Sometimes after a storm it became turbulent and dangerous. Hewasn’t worried. His boat could manage, he was certain. But for this first test,he was glad of the calm weather; he would take it slow. He needed to learn howexactly to wield the paddle, how to steer. He flexed one arm, admired his ownbicep, and wondered if Deirdre would ever notice. Then he blushed, embarrassedthat he had even thought such a foolish thing.“Gabe!”“Hey, Gabe!”He recognized Tarik’s voice. Then Simon’s, and Nathaniel’s. They had spotted himon the path. Annoyed, Gabe stopped and waited. They had guessed what he wasdoing. His whole group from Boys’ Lodge caught up with him, just Simon and Tarikat first; then they were joined by the others, who came running. “You going todo it, Gabe? Put it in the water? Can we watch?”“We’ll be your rescuers!” Tarik suggested.He had wanted to be alone for this. Too late now. Well, let them watch. When thetime came, the real time, the time when he would leave for good—he would do italone. Maybe at night. He’d leave a note at Boys’ Lodge. A separate note forJonas, he thought, with a thank-you; Jonas had done his best for Gabe. Deirdre?No, that would be foolish. No note for Deirdre. Let her wonder about him always.For now, though, no notes. This was just a practice. What was it they called it,in that book about boats? A sea trial. That’s what it would be.“Hey, Gabe?” Simon saw the coiled rope beside his little shed. Gabe had tiedstacks of boards together in order to drag them into place. He planned to returnthe rope soon.“What?”“How about if you tie one end of this rope to the boat, and we’ll hold the otherend when you push off? Then if you have any kind of trouble, we can haul youback in!”Gabe scowled at Simon. “Like a baby with a toy boat in the pond?”“No, I meant—”“Forget it, Simon. Leave the rope where it is. I borrowed it from Jonas. Hewants it back.“Anybody who wants to help? Give me a hand pushing it into the water.” Severalof the boys came eagerly to the bank where the boat was wedged in the slick mud.“But listen, Gabe!” Nathaniel sounded worried. “Maybe you should at least takethe rope with you in the boat. Because when you want to come ashore, you’ll needto grab something. Maybe you could make a noose in the rope and throw it over atree stump or a bush.”“Yeah, he’s right, Gabe!” someone else said.Gabe stood beside his boat, furious. They were ruining everything, crowdingaround, criticizing, predicting disaster.“Look there, where these two boards don’t quite come together,” a boy namedStefan said suddenly. “Won’t water come in through that crack?” He pointed.Gabe glanced to where Stefan was pointing. He had meant to fill that wide crackwith thick mud and let it dry and harden. “When the boards get wet,” he said,“they’ll expand and come together there.”Stefan looked skeptical. “But what if—”“Look,” Gabe said impatiently. “If you’re going to be all worried about it, I’llstuff something in the gap. Hand me that rag.” He gestured toward the piece ofcloth he had used to oil the paddle. It was lying near the shed. Stefan tossedit to him, and Gabe ripped it into strips. Then he stuffed one wadded strip ofcloth into the space between the boards. “There,” he said. “Happy?”Stefan glanced nervously at the others standing on the bank. Simon shrugged.Nathaniel looked very worried. Tarik grinned. “Sure,” he said. “Happy.”“Happy to see you sink,” muttered one boy, and several others laughed.Gabe ignored them now. He was concentrating on moving the boat into the waterfrom its muddy resting place. His hands were slippery on the rounded wood. Heleaned his shoulder against it and pushed. Several of the boys were pushing aswell, and with a sudden lurch the bottom of the boat lifted from the mud andmoved forward into the water. Gabe leapt in, tumbling onto his backside, andgrabbed the paddle.The river water was very still here at the shallow edge. Gabe raised himselffirst to his knees; then he stood upright, holding the paddle against the woodenfloor of the boat for balance. He hadn’t anticipated that it would rock and tipthe way it was, but he spread his bare feet for balance. He was still quite nearthe shore, and he forgot his anger and impatience in the triumph of the momentwhen he was finally standing upright without faltering. In a moment he wouldkneel and begin to steer with the paddle. But for now, it seemed appropriate tostand tall, to raise one hand from the paddle and salute his friends, who werewatching apprehensively. They grinned.Then, to his surprise, the boat began to rotate. Now he was no longer facing theshore and his friends; he was looking out toward the center of the river andacross to the trees on the opposite bank.Well, of course, he thought, realizing that he wasn’t steering it yet. He knelt.Balancing awkwardly, he raised the paddle and dipped it into the water. He hadpracticed this, pulling the water with the broadened end, and he knew how itfelt, so the resistance didn’t surprise him. Leaning forward, he pulled thepaddle against the current, and the boat responded slightly, revolving a bit, sothat again he saw the boys, but they were farther from him now. The river wasdrawing him outward, away from the bank.He had planned this. This was his time to practice controlling the boat,propelling and steering it. With the paddle, he moved it slightly toward thebank he had just left. But the river pulled him farther out again. All right, hethought. I need to steer faster. He took several long pulls with the paddle andbrought himself, again, closer to shore, but he was moving with the current downthe river, and a group of young alders were hiding the boys from him now.He realized it would be hard to get back to them. The current was pulling himaway from where they stood.“Are you all right?” He recognized Nathaniel’s voice.“Yes,” he called back. “I’m just figuring out how the paddle works!”The boat spun slightly and tilted. It was hard for him to regain his balance. Heplanted his knees and feet. He realized suddenly that they were wet—not from thedamp mud of the riverbank, but from water that was streaming in through cracksbetween the boards. He tried to aim for shore, pulling through the water withhis paddle, but the boat felt heavier now, with water in it.He could hear the boys’ voices, shouting, getting closer to him. He realizedthat his friends were running along the riverbank, following him as he moved,the boat twirling clumsily out of control. The water had risen and covered hislower legs. The paddle seemed more and more useless as a steering device.Finally, angrily, he plunged it straight downward through the water and felt itscrape the bottom. It slowed the boat. Through the bushes the boys appeared,calling to him.“Here!” Tarik shouted. “I brought the rope! If I throw it to you, we can pullyou to shore!”Gabe knew what he wanted to call back. He wanted to call: Don’t bother! I canpaddle myself to shore! But it wasn’t true. The paddle was stuck in the muddybottom of the river and it was, at the moment, precariously holding the boatstill. But the swirling water was rising.“All right, throw it!”At least he caught the rope on the first throw so he wasn’t additionallyhumiliated. He wrapped it around his wrist and waited until Tarik had found afirm footing on the riverbank. Two other boys reached for the rope as well, andwhen Gabe called, “Now!” they pulled as he lifted the paddle that had held himstill. The boat swayed and the water sloshed around his lower body. Gradually itmoved to shore.When he looked up as the bottom of the boat scraped against the rocks at theshallow edge, he saw Jonas there as well, looking concerned.“It needs work,” he muttered as he climbed out. He tied one end of the rope tothe boat, threading it through a gap between some boards near the top. He tookthe other end from Tarik and looked around for a tree trunk to tie it to.“Boys,” he heard Jonas say, “it’s time to start getting ready for supper. You goon. I’ll stay here with Gabe. Thanks for your help.”Gabe knotted the rope around the slender trunk of a nearby sapling and glancedback at the small, leaky failure of a boat that he had been so proud of a shorttime before. It was smeared with mud and the torn rag was dangling from the gaphe had stuffed it into.Jonas was waiting for him, standing silently, his expression sympathetic.“I don’t know why I’m tying it up. I should just let it float out there andsink.” Gabe’s voice was shaking with tears very near the surface. He wiped hiswet, dirt-smeared hands on his dripping shorts and climbed the bank to face theman who was the closest thing he had to a father.“I’m sorry,” Jonas said.“It’s not even a real boat. It’s just a bunch of boards tied together. That’sall it is.” He wiped his face with one dirty hand and looked angrily at Jonas,defying him to disagree.“It floated, though,” he added.“Yes. It did float.”“And my paddle really worked well.”All that work. The weeks and weeks of planning, of building, of hoping. And allhe could say now was that the paddle worked well. Gabe felt it all slippingaway: his dream of returning, of finding his mother, of becoming part ofsomething he had yearned for all his life. He had envisioned a triumphant returnto the place where his life had begun. He had daydreamed about being recognizedand greeted: “Look! It’s Gabriel!” In his imagination he had seen his motherrunning, her arms outstretched to enfold him as he stepped smiling from hissturdy little vessel.The river still surged past. It moved and churned, foaming and dark, carryingleaves and sand and twigs from one place to the next. What a fool he had been,to think that it could have carried him as well.Angrily he kicked at the boat, then turned away.“Come with me, Gabe. You can come back to my house and get cleaned up there.Kira will give us some supper and we can talk. There’s something important Ineed to tell you.”Gabe scowled at his ruined boat one more time. Then, grudgingly, he climbed theslippery bank. Carrying his paddle, he followed Jonas to the path that led backto the village."},{"pageContent":"EIGHTDo you remember Trade Mart, Gabe?”“Yes, sort of. Though they didn’t let children go. You had to be older thantwelve.”“Thank goodness for that,” Jonas said.Gabe reached toward the plate and took another cookie. Kira was a wonderfulcook. The cookies she had served for dessert were crisp and studded with driedfruits and nuts. He hadn’t been counting really, but he thought this was hissixth.Gabe and Jonas were seated together on the pillow-strewn couch. Gabe had had abath and Jonas had provided him with clean clothes. He was glad he hadn’t had togo back to Boys’ Lodge after the boat disaster. The other boys would have madejokes about it. They probably would for weeks to come. But at least for now,this first evening, he wouldn’t have to listen and try to smile.Kira was tucking the children into bed. Gabe had watched her with them earlier,as she fed them their supper and wiped their smeared, sleepy faces, talkingsoftly to them about the nice day they had had, about a picnic, and the flowersthey had picked. In a small earthen pot on the table, the bouquet of yellowloosestrife, purple coneflowers, and lacy ferns cast a shadow against the wallin the dimming light.Gabe had little interest in babies. He would rather talk to Frolic, the old,overweight dog asleep on the floor, than to Matthew and Annabelle, with theirgrabby hands and screechy giggles. He was relieved when Kira finally took themoff to bed. It amused him that Jonas kissed their sweaty little necks and callednight-night affectionately as they toddled off with their mother.But still. Still. He felt an enormous sadness that he didn’t entirelyunderstand, when he watched Kira with her children. He felt a loss, a hole inhis own life. Had anyone—all right: any woman—ever murmured to him that way, orbrushed crumbs gently from his cheek? Had anyone ever mothered him? Jonas hadtold him no. “A manufactured product,” Jonas had said, describing his originssadly.But he thought he remembered something else. A dim blur, that’s all; but it wasthere. Someone had held him, had whispered to him. Someone had loved him once.He was sure of it. He was sure he could find it. Could find her. If only thestupid boat . . .“Try to stay awake, Gabe. I know it’s been a long day. But I want to talk toyou.”He had been drifting off. Gabe shook himself fully awake and took another sipfrom his cup of tea. “About Trade Mart?” he asked. “I barely remember it. Justlistening to people talk about it. It was creepy in some way. But kind ofexciting. We always wanted to sneak in, me and the other boys.”“It had been going on for years,” Jonas described. “I never paid much attentionto it until I became Leader. Then I began to see that . . .” He paused when Kiracame into the room, carrying a cup of tea. She sat down in a nearby chair.“I’m telling Gabe about Trade Mart.”Kira nodded. “I wasn’t here then,” she told Gabe, “but Jonas has described it tome.” She made a face and shivered slightly. “Scary.”Gabe didn’t say anything. He wondered why they were talking about an event thathad ended years before.“It had always seemed to me like a simple entertainment,” Jonas said. “Everyonegot dressed up. There was a lot of merriment to their preparations. But as I gotolder I began to sense that there was always a nervousness to it, an uneasiness.So when I became Leader I began going, to watch.”Gabe yawned. “So what happened, exactly?” he asked politely.“It was a kind of ritualized thing. Every now and then this man appeared in thevillage—he always wore strange clothes, and talked in an odd, convoluted way. Hewas called Trademaster. He got up on the stage and called people forward one byone. Then he invited them to make trades.”“Trades?” Gabe asked. “Meaning what?”“Well, people would tell him what they most wanted. They’d say it loudly.Everyone could hear. And then they told him what they were willing to trade forit. But they whispered that part.”Gabe looked puzzled. “Give me an example,” he said.“Suppose it was your turn. You would go to the stage, and tell Trademaster whatyou wanted most. What might you ask for?”Gabe hesitated. He couldn’t put into words, really, the thing he truly wanted.Finally he shrugged. “A good boat, I guess.”“And then you would whisper to him what you were willing to trade away in orderto get it.”Gabe made a face. “I don’t have anything.”“Most people think that. And they thought that, then. But they found otherwise.He suggested to them that they trade parts of themselves.”Gabe sat up straighter, more awake, intrigued now. “Like a finger or something?Or an ear? There’s a woman here in the village who only has one ear. The othergot chopped off before she came here. As punishment for something, I think.There are places that do those kinds of horrible punishments.”“I know. And I know the woman you mean. You’re right. She escaped from a placewith a cruel government.“But Trademaster was asking for something different. You had to trade—let methink how to describe it—part of your basic character.”“Like what?”“Well, if you wanted a boat, he’d be able to provide that. But let’s think aboutyour character, Gabe. You’re—what? Energetic, I’d say.”“And smart. I do pretty well in school.”“Honest. Likable.”“Well, I’m honest. That’s true. I’m not always likable. I’m pretty mean to Simonsometimes.”Jonas chuckled. “Well, you’re energetic. Agreed?”“Yes. I’m energetic.”“Let’s use that, just for the example. Suppose Trademaster could give you areally fine boat, Gabe. You’d have to trade for it, though. You’d have to tradeyour energy. You’d be on the stage. He’d whisper to you what the trade wouldconsist of. No one would be able to hear. Just you. But then he’d say loudly:‘Trade?’ And you’d have to reply.”“Easy. A fine boat? I’d say, ‘Trade!’”“He’d write it down.”“And I’d get my boat.”“You would. I never knew of anyone asking for a boat, so I don’t know how itwould appear. But he had amazing powers. Probably a fine boat would be waitingfor you the next day, at the river.”“Yes!” Gabe was wide awake now, fascinated by the thought of how easily he mighthave obtained a boat.“But don’t forget: you would have made a trade for it. And your energy wouldhave been taken from you. You might wake up the next morning and be unable toget out of bed.”“So I’d rest for a day till I felt energetic.”“Gabe, Trademaster has enormous power. He could take your energy permanently.”“So I’d be in a wheeled chair or something for the rest of my life?”“Could be.”“All right, that wouldn’t work. I wouldn’t trade my energy.”“But what would your other choices be?”Gabe thought. “Honesty. Smartness. I could maybe trade one of those.”“Think about it.”“Well, I could trade my honesty. Then I’d be a dishonest person, but I’d have areally good boat.” He shrugged. “That might work.”Jonas laughed. “Anyway,” he said, “that’s what Trade Mart was all about. Itbegan to corrupt the people of the village. They traded away the best parts ofthemselves, the way you would have, in order get the foolish things they thoughtthey wanted, or needed.”“A boat isn’t foolish,” Gabe argued. He yawned.Jonas got up and went to where the teakettle was simmering. He made himselfanother cup of tea. “Kira? Tea?” he asked, but she shook her head.“Take my word for it, Gabe,” he said when he sat back down. “Trademaster wastaking control of this village. And he was pure evil. It became clear when Mattydied. That was the end of Trade Mart.”Gabe saw that Kira had put her hands to her face. She had been very close toMatty.They all were silent for a moment. Outside, it had begun to rain. They couldhear it against the roof. Then Jonas said, “I want to talk to you, Gabe, aboutpowers.”“Powers?” Gabe suddenly felt uneasy. They were entering a realm that they hadapproached before.“Maybe a better word is ‘gifts.’ I have a certain power, or gift. It becameapparent when I was young, twelve or so. I was able to focus on something andwill myself to see . . .”He sighed, and looked at Kira. “I don’t know how to describe this to him,” hesaid.Kira tried. “Jonas can see beyond, Gabe. He can see to another place. But he hasto work very hard at it. It depletes him.”“And the power is ebbing,” Jonas added. “I can feel that it’s leaving me. Kirais experiencing the same thing.”“You mean she has a gift too?”“Mine’s different. Mine has always been through my hands,” Kira explained. “Irealized it the way Jonas did, when I was young. My hands began to be able to dothings—to make things—that an ordinary pair of hands can’t. But now . . .”She smiled. “It’s leaving me, as well. And that’s all right. I think Jonas and Idon’t need these gifts anymore. We’ve used them to create our life here. We’vehelped others. And our time of such powers is passing now. But we’ve talkedabout you, Gabe. We feel certain that you have some kind of gift.”“I felt it when you were very young, Gabe,” Jonas said. “When I took you andescaped the place where we were. I’ve been waiting for it to make itself knownto you.” He looked at Gabe as if something might become apparent at that moment.Gabe shifted uncomfortably on the couch.“Well,” he said finally, “it’s not a gift for boatbuilding, is it?”Jonas chuckled. “No,” he said. “But you’re very determined. That serves youwell. And I think you’re going to need that determination, and your energy—infact, all your attributes—plus whatever special gift you haven’t discoveredyet—”I have discovered it, Gabe thought. I can veer. But he stayed silent. He simplydidn’t feel ready to tell them.“—because you have a hard job ahead of you,” Jonas continued.“What do you mean?”“I’m going to use the last of my own power,” Jonas said. “I’m going to seebeyond one final time.”“Why?” asked Kira, startled.Gabe echoed her. “Why?”“I have to find out where Trademaster is,” Jonas told them both. “He’s still outthere somewhere. He’s quite near. And he’s terribly dangerous.”The rain had become louder, drenching, and a wind had risen. Tree brancheswhipped against the side of the house. Kira rose suddenly from her chair andpulled a window closed. Jonas paid no attention. “And Gabe?” he said. “When Ifind him . . .”Gabe waited. He was wide awake now.“It’s going to be up to you, then. You must destroy him.”“Me? Why me? He’s nothing to do with me!”Jonas took a deep breath. “It’s everything to do with you, Gabe. But it’s a verylong story. I was going to tell it to you tonight, but I can see how tired youare. And it’s late. Let’s get some sleep now. And in the morning I’ll explain itto you.”"},{"pageContent":"NINEThe leaves dripped onto the wet grass, but the rain had stopped and a pale sunhad risen. It was late morning now and Gabe was just waking. He had sleptfitfully on the couch until finally, nudged awake by the houshold noises, heyawned and opened his eyes. He watched Kira tending the children. In her softvoice she spoke firmly to Matthew, who was trying to grab a toy from his sister.Annabelle held it tightly in her fist and looked defiantly at her brother. “No!”she said.Kira laughed. When she saw that Gabe was awake, she turned away from the littleones.“How are you feeling?” she asked. “You slept a long time.”Gabe nodded. He looked around the room. “I’m all right. I had strange dreams.I’m sorry I slept so late. You should have woken me. Is Jonas here?”“No. He had to leave.”“But he promised to explain—”“I know. And he will. But he got an urgent message early this morning. Someonein the village is quite sick.”“Why did they call for him? He’s not a healer. They usually call Herbalist.”Kira shrugged. “I’m not sure. Apparently she asked for him. Are you hungry? Thechildren just had some bread and jam. Would you like some?”Gabe went to the table. She poured milk into a thick cup for him. He drank someand spread raspberry jam on the crusty, freshly baked bread. He watched when sheturned her attention again to the toddlers.“Do you think they’ll remember this moment when they’re older?” he askedsuddenly.“Fighting over a toy? Eating bread and jam? Probably not. They’re too little forspecific memories like that. But I think they’ll remember the general feeling ofbeing taken care of, of being scolded now and then, maybe of being held andhugged.” She poured more milk into his empty cup. “Why?”“I don’t know. I just wondered.”“I think I remember being very small and sleeping beside my mother. When I thinkof it, I feel her warmth. And I think maybe she sang to me. I suppose I was justabout the age of Annabelle.” Kira smiled. “I didn’t walk when I was her age. Ittook me a long time to walk because of my leg.”One of her legs was twisted. It was why she leaned on a stick when she walked.He glanced at her, at the stick, when she spoke of it. But his mind was not onthat.“I don’t have a single memory like that.”“What do you remember, Gabe?” Kira asked him.“I rode in a seat on the back of a bike. You know that bicycle in the museum?”“Of course.”“I remember that, a little. But it was Jonas who brought me here on that bike.He wasn’t my parent. I don’t remember a mother, the way you do, the wayAnnabelle and Matthew will. Except . . .”He paused.“Except what?”Gabe squirmed on his chair. “There was a woman. I know there was. And she lovedme.”Kira smiled. “Of course she did.”“Kira, I mean I really know. Last night, when you and Jonas were talking aboutyour gifts . . .”She looked at him. “Yes?”“I didn’t want to tell you. I don’t know why. Maybe I just needed to test it onemore time.”“Test what?” Kira glanced toward the children, who were now playing quietly. Shecame to the table and sat down in the chair next to Gabe.“My gift. I do have one. I call it veering.”“Go on.”“At first it just happened. It always surprised me. But then I found I couldchoose the time. I could direct it. I could cause it to happen. Was it that wayfor you?”Kira nodded. “Yes. It was.”“And this morning, just a few minutes ago, you were over there, with thechildren—” Gabe nodded toward the corner of the room where the two little oneswere industriously piling blocks into towers. “I was lying on the couch, halfawake, watching, and I decided to veer into Matthew.”“Into Matthew?” Kira looked puzzled.“Yes, because he’s the boy. I suppose it’s not that different with a girl, but Ineeded to know how it felt to be a small boy looking at his mother.”They both glanced over at Matthew. His tongue was wedged between his lips and hewas frowning with concentration as he balanced a blue wooden triangle on top ofa pile of square red blocks.“So I concentrated really hard. The first thing that happens is a silence. Youwere talking to the children, showing them how the blocks fit together, and justas you said, ‘See the shapes?’ You were holding up a yellow one, and—”“Yes. Annabelle took it from me,” Kira said.“Maybe. I don’t remember that, because the silence happened. I never noticewhat’s happening when the silence comes. But then I, ah, well, I veered intoMatthew. I entered Matthew.”“You never moved from the couch.”“No, my body doesn’t move. But my awareness shifts.”Kira nodded.“And then,” Gabe went on, “I became part of Matthew’s feelings at that moment. Ifelt them. I understood them.”“So your gift is understanding how someone feels?”“More than understanding it. Feeling it. And this morning, when I did that, Ifelt my own little self, my baby self, experiencing what Matthew wasexperiencing at that moment. He was receiving so much love from his mother.”Kira, beginning to understand, nodded. “For Matthew, that was coming from me.But for you, Gabe, you were remembering . . .”“Yes. I don’t know her name or where she is now. But I know for certain who shewas.”The two of them sat silently, watching the children play. Later, after he had helped her clean up the lunch dishes, Kira said, “I’m goingto take the children for a walk. Want to come?” She lifted two small jacketsfrom a hook on the wall.“When’s Jonas coming back?”“I don’t know. I’m surprised that he’s been gone so long.”“Is it all right if I wait here for him?”“Of course. You and he have a lot to talk about.”Gabe looked through the window, down at the winding paths that crisscrossed thevillage. People hurried along, busy with midday tasks. Beyond the orchard, hecould see the library; it appeared closed. Nearby, in the playing field,children were running around with a ball that they passed back and forth; hecould hear their shouts. It was an ordinary day in the quiet, well-orderedplace. Yet someplace in the village, someone was very ill, and Jonas was there.“I think I’ll go look for him,” Gabe said suddenly. “Do you know where he went?Who is it who is so sick?”Kira reached into a small sleeve and guided Annabelle’s chubby arm through.“Other side now,” she said to the little girl, and held open the other sleeve.“Can you do yours by yourself?” she asked Matthew, whose jacket was on the floorin front of him. He grinned and shook his head no.“A woman named Claire,” she said to Gabe, in answer to his question. “I’m sureyou’ve seen her in the village. She’s very, very old.”“Oh, her! Yes, I’ve seen her often.”“Well, I fear you won’t be seeing her much longer. It sounds as if her time isrunning out.” With both children now buttoned into their jackets, Kira headed tothe door with Annabelle in her arms and Matthew by one hand. “Can you open thedoor for me?”“Is it all right if I leave my paddle here?” He looked toward the corner whereit was propped against the wall. The sunlight made it gleam golden.“Of course. I won’t let the children play with it.”Gabe helped her through the door and down the front steps. “Do you know whereshe lives? Or is she in the infirmary?”“Jonas went to her house. It’s over there someplace.” Kira indicated, noddingher head, a place beyond the library, beyond the schoolhouse. He could see thesmall cottages, deep in shade, that dotted the wooded area.Gabe thanked her quickly for the place to eat and sleep after such a bad day.Then, as Kira headed with the children to the play area nearby, he began to jogtoward the place where Claire lived and where Jonas was with her now. He wantedto talk more about what Jonas had proposed last night. It had been on his mindsince he had awakened. He was to kill someone named Trademaster? It made nosense. Jonas was a peaceful, compassionate man. All right, maybe thisTrademaster guy was bad. Maybe even pure evil! But he wasn’t bothering anyonethey knew. They would watch out for him, would fend him off if he showed signsof trying to return to the village and do harm.Hah, Gabe thought with a wry smile. Maybe they should just put him into mystupid boat and give it a firm shove into the river. The little cottage was deep in a thicket of trees, but he had no trouble findingthe place where Claire lived. Several aged women stood somberly outside,murmuring to one another.“So sudden,” he overheard one woman say to another. “Came upon her just likethat. She was fine last night.”“Happens that way,” a tall white-haired woman said knowingly, and several othersnodded.Gabe excused himself politely as he passed them. “Is Jonas inside?” he asked. Awoman nodded.“She asked for him, first thing. Strange,” she murmured.“Is it all right if I go in?” Gabe asked.No one seemed to be in charge. They all looked at him blankly, and he took it aspermission. The door stood partially open, and he entered after a quiet knock onthe wood, which drew no reply. The interior was very dim. It was bright outsideon this clear day after the night’s rain, but the windows of the cottage weresmall, and woven curtains were drawn across. He smelled stale food, old age,dried herbs, and dust.Herbalist, who ordinarily tended the sick, sat quietly in a rocking chair.Gabe looked around. “Jonas?”“Over here.” He followed the voice and found Jonas sitting in the shadows besidethe bed. Again he wondered: Why? Why had the old woman asked for Jonas?And how soon could Jonas excuse himself and come away? Gabe needed to talk tohim. Their conversation last night had seemed urgent. More than urgent; it hadbeen alarming. Jonas, the most peaceful of souls, seemed to be commanding Gabeto commit a murder. He had not explained, not really. He had said they woulddiscuss it more fully in the morning.Now morning had passed, and Gabe wanted to know more. The old woman was dying,as old people always do. It was the natural way of things. Her friends werenearby, and Herbalist was sitting in the corner. She didn’t need Jonas. Not asmuch as Gabe did.“Can’t you leave?” Gabe whispered, moving closer. “We need to talk. You promisedto explain—”“Shhh.” Jonas held up a hand.Now, through the dim light, he could see Jonas more clearly, and the woman inthe bed as well. Her eyes were open, and it was clear that she had seen Gabeapproaching. Her thin fingers moved, plucking at the blanket. Jonas was watchingher very closely; now he leaned forward, as if to listen. Her thin, dry lipswere moving. Gabe could not hear, at first, what she said. But Jonas did. Jonaswas nodding.Gabe stood there uncertainly. The woman’s mouth began to move again, and hefound himself leaning forward to listen. This time, nearer, he could hear herwords.“Tell him,” she was saying to Jonas."},{"pageContent":"TENI’m sorry. I just don’t believe you.”Gabe’s voice was both skeptical and firm.Jonas leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. He cupped his own face with hishands. They were sitting together on the bench behind the library, the samebench where he had so recently sat with Claire.He looked up and sighed. “I felt the same way yesterday when she told it to me.I sat here thinking: This woman is crazy. Is that what you’re thinking now ofme, Gabe?”Gabe shook his head and looked away. He wanted to be someplace else. Off withhis lodge-mates. Building another boat. Sinking another boat. He didn’t care.Anywhere but here, listening to this unbelievable story being told to him by aman he loved. And last night this same man had talked of the need to destroysomeone. It was scary. It was sad.He turned to Jonas and tried to speak in a soothing voice. “You know what?You’ve been working awfully hard. Probably reading too much. You should take along walk along the river. Have a nice relaxing, restful . . .”“Gabe. Listen to me! We don’t have much time. This is not a wild made-up thing.This is real. She remembers you. She remembers me. She—” Jonas paused and took adeep breath. “I know you were very young when we left the community, so youwon’t recall these things. But I do, Gabe. I remember seeing her there. She usedto work at the fish hatchery. But in her spare time she came to the nurturingcenter and helped out. She did that because you were there, Gabe.“She had given birth to you. It’s the way things were done there. Young girlsproduced babies—they weren’t called babies; they were called newchildren. Thebirthmothers turned them out like factory products. Then the babies were movedto the nurturing center, and eventually assigned to couples who applied forchildren.”“That’s how your parents got you?” Gabe asked.Jonas nodded.“So some girl had given birth to you?”“Yes.”“But you don’t know who?”Jonas shook his head.“And some other girl—or maybe it was the same one?—gave birth to me yearslater—”“Claire gave birth to you. You were the only child she ever had.”“But you’re saying she ended up working in the fish place.”Jonas nodded. “Yes, they determined that she couldn’t handle any more births.She had difficulty when you were born. So they gave her another job. But shespent all her time watching over you. She loved you, Gabe. But love wasn’tpermitted.”Gabe leaned down, slipped off one of the sandals he was wearing, and dislodged apebble that had been rubbing against his toe. He watched a bird flutter in anearby tree, and noticed that it had a twig in its beak. He examined a scratchon his arm. He yawned, and stretched. He unbuttoned and rebuttoned the neck ofhis shirt. He investigated his fingernails.Jonas watched him.“You know what?” Gabe said at last. “I guess I can believe all of that. You’vetold me before about what the community was like. So: there was a girl; she gavebirth to me. I believe that. And, Jonas? I know it’s true that she loved me.But—”Jonas nodded. “I know. It’s the rest of it.”“Yes, the rest of it is just crazy. That old woman? I’m supposed to believe thatsome man in strange-looking clothes—”He noticed that Jonas was no longer looking at him. He was looking across thegrassy area, to the path beyond. Gabe followed Jonas’s gaze and saw Mentor, theelderly schoolmaster, walking slowly along the path. Nothing unusual. It wasschool vacation now. Mentor was a part of the village. One often saw him walkingaround.To his surprise, Jonas rose from the bench and called to Mentor. “Come with me,Gabe,” he said.He followed Jonas’s quick strides toward the path where Mentor had stopped andwas waiting. The bearded schoolmaster was stooped, and his face was lined. Buthis eyes were keen and intelligent. Gabe had always liked Mentor, even when hehad not liked school. “Good morning,” he said. “What can I do for you gentlementhis morning?”“Mentor,” Jonas began, “I’m trying to explain to Gabe here about Trademaster.About his powers.”Mentor visibly winced. “That’s of the past,” he said abruptly. “It’s forgotten.”“I’m afraid it isn’t,” Jonas told him. “We have a rather urgent situation. I’lldescribe it to you later. But right now I need you to help me convince Gabe thatthe powers exist. He finds it hard to believe.”“It is hard to believe,” Mentor agreed, nodding. “In a peaceful village likethis, it is hard to conceive of true evil.”“We don’t have a lot of time, Mentor. Could you describe, to Gabe, the trade youmade?”Mentor sighed. “This is necessary?” he asked Jonas.“Necessary and very important.”Mentor nodded. “I see. Very well, then. It was years ago, Gabe. You were alittle boy. I remember how mischievous you were in school. Sometimesinattentive.”“I know,” Gabe acknowledged in embarrassment.“You were too young to go to Trade Mart. But surely you knew of it?”Gabe shrugged. “I guess. It seemed kind of mysterious.”“Some of us adults went every time. There was a kind of entertainment to it,watching other villagers make fools of themselves. But you didn’t usuallyattend, did you, Jonas?”Jonas shook his head. “It didn’t ever interest me until it got out of hand, andby then I was Leader and had to take action.”“Well, I was a fool. Many of us were. I was an old man—widowed, lonely. I livedwith my daughter, but I knew she would marry someday and I’d be alone. I feltsorry for myself. I had this birthmark. The schoolchildren used to called meRosie because of it; remember, Gabe?”Gabe looked at the deep red stain on Mentor’s cheek. He nodded. “We didn’t meanany harm.”“Of course you didn’t.” Mentor smiled. “But I was self-pitying and foolish. Andthere was a woman, a widow, I was attracted to. You understand about that, don’tyou? Boys your age would understand.”Gabe’s instinct was to pretend ignorance. The question embarrassed him. But withboth Mentor and Jonas watching him intently, it seemed a time for honesty.“Yes,” he said. “I understand.”“So,” Mentor said with a deep sigh, “I went to Trade Mart and for the firsttime, I asked to make a trade.”“What did you ask for?”Mentor laughed, but it was a sardonic laugh. “I told Trademaster that I wantedto be younger, and handsome. I wanted Stocktender’s widow to fall in love withme.”Gabe looked at the ground. He was embarrassed for Mentor, that he must make sucha confession of his own idiocy. “He couldn’t do that kind of transformation,could he? You should have asked for, oh, I don’t know, maybe a set of new desksfor the schoolhouse!”“Evil can do anything, Gabe,” Mentor said, “for a price.”Gabe stared at him. “What was the price?” he asked, after a moment.“His terms were vague. Vague enough that they sounded unimportant. He’s veryclever, Trademaster is. He sets his terms but we don’t really understand themwhen we agree to the trade. He told me I would have to trade away my honor.”“So you said no.”Mentor shook his head. “I grabbed at it. Eagerly. I told you I was a fool.”“But, Mentor! You are an honorable man! Everyone knows that. And—I don’t mean tobe rude, but you’re not young and handsome. So the trade didn’t work! No one hasthat kind of power, not even someone evil.”“Oh, it worked. It worked for many of us here in the village. Me—I grew taller,and my bald spot disappeared. Thick hair where once there had been just thisshiny dome! Birthmark? Faded, faded, then poof! Gone! You may not have noticed,Gabe; you were a child then, and it was summer so you weren’t in school. Butbriefly I was a younger, handsome man. I began courting the pretty widow.“But you know what, Gabe?”“What?” Gabe was stunned. So Trademaster, whoever he was, did have incrediblepowers. He could have made a trade with the woman—what was her name, Claire? Hetried to pay attention to what Mentor was saying, but his thoughts now were onwhat this all meant—what it meant to him, Gabe, and to the woman, Claire, whomay have made a terrible trade in order to find her . . . her . . .“I am her son,” he whispered aloud.Mentor hadn’t heard him. He continued talking. “I had traded away the mostimportant part of myself. I turned selfish. Cruel. The pretty widow didn’t wanta man like that! So I had made a meaningless trade, and I had turned into aperson I hated—but a handsome one! And young!”Gabe forced himself to pay attention to the schoolmaster. “What changed youback? You’re a man of honor now, Mentor.”“Jonas stepped in. Trade Mart had corrupted the whole village. Many people hadtraded away their best selves. We turned on each other. There was greed, andjealousy, and . . . Well, it had to end. There was a set of horrible events—welost one of our best young people—”“Matty?”“Yes, Matty died, battling the evil. But because of him the rest of us survivedand were restored. I got my bald head and my birthmark back!” He laughed. “And Ilost my silly romance. Still a bachelor today.”“And we banished Trademaster,” Jonas reminded them.“We did. Forever.” Mentor said it with a kind of relief and satisfaction. Heturned to leave. Then he said slowly, with a questioning look, “Something’swrong?”Jonas nodded. “He’s returned,” he said.Mentor looked stunned. “So this battle must be waged again?”Jonas nodded. “This time we must be sure it’s final.”“Whom do we send this time, to die?” Mentor’s voice was bitter and sad. Likeeveryone, he had loved Matty.“I’m going,” Gabe told him.Mentor was silent. Then, without speaking, he turned away from them.Gabe and Jonas stood watching the aged schoolmaster walk away. His shoulderswere slumped.“He got himself back,” Gabe said, after a moment.Jonas nodded. “He did.”“That means a trade can be reversed,” Gabe said.Jonas nodded.“I’m scared.”“I am too,” Jonas replied. “For you, for all of us.”She is my mother. She is my mother. Gabe took a deep breath. “How much time dowe have?” he asked."},{"pageContent":"ELEVENThey hurried back to the cottage where Claire was dying. The sun was settingnow. Someone had lit an oil lamp on the table. This time, in the flickeringgolden light, Gabe approached the bed without hesitation. He knew, he thought,what he wanted to say: that he’d been waiting all his life for her to find him.That he understood the sacrifice she had made for him. That it didn’t matterthat she was old. What mattered was being together.But when he knelt beside her, he thought he’d come too late. Her eyes were halfopen and glazed. Her mouth fell slack. Her hand on the coverlet, when he took itin his, was limp and cold.Crying unashamedly, Gabe turned to Jonas, who stood behind him. “I wanted totell her I knew! I wanted to tell her I remember her! But I’m too late,” hewept. “She’s gone.”Jonas gently moved Gabe aside. He leaned down and touched Claire’s thin, veinedneck. Then he rested his head against her chest, listening carefully.“Her heart is beating still,” he told Gabe. “She’s very close to death. But sheis still alive. We have very little time, and I have very little left of thegift I once possessed. But I am going to use it. I am going to look beyond andtry to see where he is. After that, it will be up to you. Your gift is stillyoung.”“Do you need to go to some special place?” Gabe asked, wiping his eyes on thesleeve of his shirt.“No. I just need to gather my strength. And I need quiet, for concentration.“Claire? Can you hear me?” Jonas said toward the old woman. She didn’t respond.She took a slow, deep breath.“Gabe will sit here beside you. Gabe, hold her hand so that she knows you’rethere.”Gabe took the gnarled hand in his own.“I’m going to close the door to the cottage so that no one comes in, so that itwill be quiet. I’ll be here, by the window.” He was speaking to them both. “I’mtold that this is difficult to watch, Gabe. But don’t be afraid. It’s notpainful for me, just very draining. It shouldn’t take long.”Jonas went to the front of the cottage, spoke briefly to the people gatheredoutside, then closed and latched the door. Gabe, watching him, could see thatalready he was changing in some way; he was becoming something different fromthe ordinary and pleasant man he had been. He went to the window and stoodlooking through it into the night, though his eyes were half closed. He wasbreathing deeply, in and out, very slowly. Suddenly he gasped, as if he werepierced by pain. He moaned slightly. Gabe found himself squeezing the oldwoman’s hand. He continued to watch Jonas.On the bed, Claire breathed occasionally, with a tortured sound.Jonas began to shimmer. His body vibrated and was suffused with a silvery light.“He is beyond now,” Gabe said to Claire, hoping that somehow she could hear andknow how desperately they were trying to save her.Jonas gasped loudly again.“I think he is seeing Trademaster,” Gabe whispered, and felt Claire shudder.Then he fell silent and waited. Afterward, Gabe had to help Jonas to the nearby rocking chair. He collapsed intoit, panting and trembling. “What did you see?” Gabe asked. “Could you find him?”But Jonas was unable to speak. He closed his eyes and held up one hand, askingGabe to wait. Finally, after resting for several minutes, Jonas opened his eyes.“I don’t think I’ll be able to do that again,” he said hoarsely to Gabe. “It wasthe last time. It has become too hard.”He turned slightly and looked toward the bed. “How is she?”Gabe went to Claire and took her hand. There was no answering squeeze from her.Her hand and arm were limp. But he heard a long, slow breath.“Alive,” Gabe told Jonas, returning to the chair where he was slumped.“There’s not much time.” Jonas sat up a little straighter, still breathing hard.“But I saw him; he’s close by. It’s up to you now, Gabe. I’ll stay here withher.”Close by? What did that mean? Gabe found himself looking around the room, andtoward the window. Was someone standing out there in the trees? A closet doorwas open in the corner, the interior dark. Was someone in the closet? A boardcreaked, and Gabe jumped nervously. But it was just Jonas’s chair, its curvedrockers moving against the wooden floor.He found a pitcher of water and brought Jonas a cup. Jonas drank, and sat upstraighter.“I forgot to tell you something else that she and I both remembered. When youwere a baby—a newchild—you had a stuffed toy.” He smiled. “It went everywherewith you. Your hippo.”A blurred image appeared to Gabe. A soft, comforting object. With ears. He hadchewed on the ears.“Po,” he said.“A fine water beast,” Jonas said. “You’ve always been attracted to water, Gabe.And now you must become like Po. Trademaster is on the other side of the river.” It was dark when Gabe stood at the water’s edge, alone. He had begged Jonas tocome with him. But Jonas had said no.“Years ago, Gabe, when I took you and ran away, there was a man I loved and leftbehind. I wanted him to come with me but he said no.“He was right to refuse. It was my journey and I had to do it without help. Ihad to find my own strengths, face my own fears. And now you must.”Gabe had leaned down and kissed the papery cheek of the silent woman in the bed.There were long pauses between her breaths now, and occasionally a gurgle deepin her throat. Jonas moved his chair so that he could sit close to her. Then hetold Gabe where he would find Trademaster—in a grove of birch trees on the farside of the river—and he grasped Gabe’s hand. “Go,” he said. “This is yourjourney, your battle. Be brave. Find your gift. Use it to save what you love.” Now, standing barefoot in the pebbly sand, Gabe didn’t feel brave. It was verydark. Clouds covered the moon. There were no sounds but the rushing water, andthough the river had always lured him, fascinated him, he had never been herebefore at night. Suddenly, in the dark, it seemed dangerous and forbidding.Gabe was a good swimmer. But the place where he and his friends swam was fartherdown the river, a bend where the water, protected by encircling rocks, was calm,separated from the fast-moving water farther out. It was safer there, lesstreacherous. But Jonas had told him to cross the river here. The current wouldmove him downriver and he would emerge at the other side very near to the woodedgrove where Trademaster, gloating, was waiting for Claire to die.“Why is he there?” Gabe had asked.“I think he must feel a certain satisfaction at knowing how things end. He setsthem in motion and then watches from a distance. He has probably been aware ofClaire for all these years, since she made the trade.”“Is it just Claire he’s been watching?”“Oh, no, he must have many, many tragedies to keep track of. I suppose theynourish him in some terrible way.”Gabe moved forward and felt the pull of the current against his ankles. He knew,from the disaster with his little boat two days before, how strong the swirlingmotion of the water was. But he was strong too, and he felt certain he couldfight his way across the river. He was holding his cedar paddle. The mud-smearedboat, leaky and useless, was still tied to a tree. But he had run back toJonas’s house and retrieved the paddle for the night swim. He thought he coulduse it to push himself away from rocks, and perhaps, when he reached the otherside, he would need it as a weapon.He wished he had the power that Jonas had used: the gift of seeing beyond. Hewould like to know what Trademaster was doing at this moment. Did such a mansleep? Eat?He had no idea how he was to destroy this evil. Gabe knew—all village childrenhad been taught—which berries, which plants, were lethal. Perhaps he should havecrushed some leaves of oleander, or chopped up nightshade root, and somehowfound a way to sneak the poison into Trademaster’s food. Of course there hadbeen no time for plans like that.If he were to find Trademaster asleep, then a heavy rock brought down on hishead would do it, Gabe thought. Awake? He could use the paddle as if it were aspear or a bludgeon.The thought made him feel sick.He was now in the water to his knees, and he realized that instead of plottinghow to do away with the enemy—and sickening himself at the thought of it—he mustfirst concentrate on the dangerous swim he was about to undertake. The currentpulled at him, and he waded deeper. Soon his feet would be lifted from thebottom and he would be fighting his way across. He held the buoyant paddle inboth hands, crosswise in front of him. His feet lifted and he began to kick andmove forward.The speed with which the current caught him was frightening. He felt himselfpropelled downriver instead of across. The water rushed over his head and heforced himself up through it to catch his breath. In the darkness he could notsee how far out into the river he had been swept, but he could feel the current;he continued kicking his way across it, even as it pushed him sideways againsthis will. Suddenly his paddle caught against two large rocks and he was heldthere, able to rest and breathe. The water parted and foamed around him and hewaited, gathering his strength. He knew he would have to leave this wedgedprotection and enter the river’s surge again. But for this moment he rested.Then, as he pondered the mission that lay ahead for him, he realized, suddenly,he could not fulfill it.I cannot kill someone, he thought.As he had the realization, a cloud slid beyond the moon and pale lightilluminated the river. He could see where he was, nearing the halfway point, andwhere he must aim for. The water between him and the other side was veryturbulent, but in the gleaming moonlight, the grove of birches, his destination,was visible. Trademaster would be lurking there. He must pull the paddle freefrom the rocks now and force himself into that maelstrom. He would fight his wayacross, and—I cannot kill someone. The unbidden thought was so strong the second time thathe may have said it aloud, into the night, into the roaring sound of theturbulence.Oddly, as if affected by his thought, the motion of the river subsided slightly.As he waited there, suspended from his paddle between the rocks, his legs couldsense the change in the current. For a moment the water around him was still.The water ahead of him was calm. Then it began to move again, to swirl and suckat him.What had changed?Nothing, except that into the night breeze, into the noise of the river, he hadwhispered a phrase. He began to say the words again.I cannot kill—Three words was all it took. The three words that he had spoken soothed the sky,the river, the world.He repeated them, like a chant. He loosened the paddle from where it was wedged.With his fingers he could feel the carved names in the smooth wet wood: Tarik.Simon. Nathaniel. Stefan. Jonas. Though she had not carved her name, he addedKira in his mind. Then little Matthew, and Annabelle. Finally he said hismother’s name—Claire—aloud, adding it to the list of those who cared about him.He shouted it—“Claire!”—into the night, begging her to live. Holding tightly tothe paddle, he began to kick his way easily across the gently flowing water inthe moonlight. While he propelled himself, he said the words in rhythm with themovement of his fluttering kick—I cannot kill, I cannot kill—murmuring themuntil he reached the opposite bank easily and pulled himself, dripping, ashore.When he fell silent, he heard the river resume its relentless churn and pull. Abrisk wind blew. Above him, the moon receded and disappeared again behindclouds. Around him the shadows darkened and enveloped the swaying shrubbery andtrees. At the edge of the bushes stood a tall man wrapped in a dark cloak."},{"pageContent":"TWELVEGabe shuddered. Suddenly he was very cold. The wind that was rustling the bushesand making the trees sway was also causing his wet garments to feel icy againsthis skin.But his shudder was more fear than chill. He could see the man standing in theshadows.Somehow Gabe had anticipated that he would arrive on the river’s far side, catchhis breath, get his bearings—he had never crossed the river before—and thenbegin to search. He had assumed his enemy would be hiding. He had planned tomake his way with stealth to the place where they would encounter each other. Hethought he would have time to prepare, though he had not known how.Instead, the man was not hiding at all. He stood, wrapped in a dark cloak, infull view at the edge of the trees. Even through the darkness, Gabe could seethat his eyes glittered. His face was expressionless, but his eyes—they werestaring directly at Gabe—were excited. Then he spoke.“What a pleasure,” the man said with an air of mocking hospitality. “Seldom dopeople come looking for me.”Gabe didn’t reply. He didn’t know how to. Nervously, he clutched the slim stalkof the paddle, the only thing in this strange place that felt familiar andcomforting. Beneath his thumb he could feel the ridge of the gouged J, the placewhere Jonas had carved his name.“Are you not going to introduce yourself?”Gabe cleared his throat. “My name is Gabriel,” he said.There was a flurry of cloak and motion. The man, who had been standing somedistance away, was suddenly so near that Gabe could smell the stench of him.Odd, as he looked very clean, Gabe thought. His clothes, visible in the partedcloak, were pressed, almost stiff with creases. His face was pale and seemedvery white against the darkness. His dark hair was combed and oiled.And he was too close. When he leaned forward and said harshly, “You fool! Didyou think I didn’t know your name?” his rancid breath was hot against Gabe’sface. “And you, of course, know mine.“Don’t you?” he sneered. “Don’t you?”“Yes,” Gabe said. “I know your name, Trademaster.” He stepped back, slightly,away from the smell. The foul breath was making him feel nauseated.“And we both know why we are here.” The voice had become soft, as if the manwere confiding a secret.Gabriel nodded. “Yes,” he whispered back. “I do.”“You hope to destroy me, and I plan to destroy you.”In a quick flash of memory, Gabe thought of Mentor, his teacher, standing infront of a class of restless children, teaching them about language. Aboutverbs. Hope. Plan. How different the meanings were. Hope seemed tentative,uncertain—exactly how Gabe was feeling. He took a deep breath and tried to calmhis own anxiety.“What weapons do you have? Can they match mine?” Trademaster’s gloved handreached inside his thick cloak. Gabe grasped the paddle more tightly, trying tosteady himself. His knees felt weak.“I see you have brought a crude stick. Pathetic. Is that the only weapon youhave?” The voice was contemptuous.“This isn’t a weapon,” Gabe confessed. “I didn’t bring a weapon. I cannot kill—”He began to repeat the phrase that had mysteriously helped him cross the river.To his surprise, Trademaster winced. The wind stopped, suddenly. The restlessmovement of the trees ceased. Again the moon slid from the clouds and the nightbrightened slightly. Back in the cottage, Jonas had been waiting in the rocking chair beside the bed.Earlier, Kira had brought him supper. Together they had moistened Claire’s drylips with water and her tongue had moved slightly. But her eyes had remainedclosed and her breathing was irregular. Sometimes she gasped and her fingersplucked at the blanket. But mostly she was silent and still. He knew she woulddie during the night, unless—He tried not to think of the unless. He had seen, when he looked beyond, thatTrademaster was out there in the birch grove. He had seen too—but had not toldGabe—that Trademaster was waiting for the boy.Gabe had always been a determined child. Even as an infant, when Jonas hadbrought him here after a long and torturous journey, Gabe had held out, had beenstrong, had stayed alive, when he, Jonas, had almost given up. It had alwaysbeen clear to Jonas that Gabe had some kind of gift. And it might have beensimply this: the tenacity of the boy, the stubbornness. Who else would haveworked so hard at an impossible project like the doomed boat?But now, waiting through the night, thinking of how Gabe had set out on anotherprobably impossible mission, one that might well cost him his life, Jonas foundhimself hoping desperately that the stubborn energy would be accompanied by adeeper gift of some sort, something that would be able to pierce the very coreof the creature he would be facing soon. Jonas shuddered. Trademaster was soinhuman, so dangerous. So evil. And Gabe was so young and vulnerable.He would be across the river now, Jonas realized, checking the time. He is onthe other side by now. The shift in the atmosphere calmed Gabriel. It had happened the same way in theriver: the moon had appeared and the rush of water had subsided; the world hadbeen somehow soothed. Standing now in the moonlight, Gabe stroked the paddle,feeling the carved names, and wondered if perhaps Trademaster had felt thesudden shift.But instead of calmed, his opponent was angered. The gloved hand emerged fromthe deep folds of the cloak and in the moonlight Gabe could see that it now helda gleaming knife with a long, very narrow blade and pointed tip. Frightened, hestepped back.“Stiletto,” Trademaster hissed. “You don’t have one of these tucked awaysomeplace? It would serve you well. Quite sharp. Quite deadly.“Here!” he said suddenly, and tossed the stiletto to Gabe. “Take mine!”Gabe dropped the paddle and caught the handle of the weapon awkwardly, relievedthat the blade had not sliced through his hand. The knife was surprisinglyheavy. He didn’t want it. But he seemed to have no choice. He tightened his gripon the cold steel handle.“Now you can kill,” Trademaster said with a short, mirthless laugh. He reachedagain into the folds of his cloak. The sky darkened again and the wind resumed,whipping the tree branches back and forth. Gabe peered through the darkness,trying to see what weapon might appear. Another stiletto? Would the man lungeforward with his own narrow blade? Terrified, Gabe held his knife up, hoping todeflect the attack that was coming.Then suddenly the stiletto was on the ground and Gabe’s hands were empty anddefenseless. Trademaster was inches from him and had struck the knife out ofGabe’s hand with a larger weapon, something with a terrifying curved blade.“Guan dao,” Trademaster whispered into Gabe’s ear, naming it.The wind howled. The man held Gabe’s neck with one gloved hand, raised hisweapon with the other, and touched the tender skin there with the blade. Gabeheld his breath, afraid that the slightest movement would cause it to slice intohis skin. He could feel the exquisite sharpness of the steel.The two of them stood motionless in an embrace that was wrought by hatred. Gabehoped that his death would be quick. It was the only thing that he could hopefor now.Then, to Gabe’s surprise, still with the knife poised, Trademaster began totalk. Gabe could again smell his foul breath. His voice was low, and herecognized the tone, superior and arrogant, as bragging.“You’re such a small, unworthy opponent,” Trademaster taunted. “I’ve destroyedpeople far more important than you.”Gabe said nothing. He barely breathed. He was motionless, still aware of theblade against his skin.“Leaders. Whole families.” The voice was excited. “I’ve torn them to pieces.Left them in whimpering shreds!”Gabe felt a sharp sliver of pain, and something trickled from his neck onto hisbare shoulder. Trademaster had allowed the razor-sharp blade to make a shallowcut.“Wars,” the voice went on. “I’ve caused wars!”Gabe stood motionless, paralyzed, but sensed that the man wanted a reaction fromhim. Some kind of admiration, perhaps. He stayed silent.“I’ve destroyed whole communities,” the man murmured gleefully into Gabe’s ear.“Do you believe me?”“Yes,” Gabe whispered. And it was true. He did believe that he had such power.This was not a man, Gabe realized. It was a force disguised as a man. It wasnothing human. It was simple evil, wearing a cloak. Jonas had told him this buthe had not understood, not until now. He tried desperately to remember whatadvice Jonas had given him. How should he fight this battle? Finally he said theonly thing he could think of to say.“If you have such power,” Gabe whispered, still trying not to move, “why killsomeone as unimportant as me?”To his amazement, Trademaster withdrew. He lifted the blade from Gabe’s skin andtossed it to the ground, where it fell beside the stiletto. Then he smoothed thefolds of his cloak. “I have other weapons,” he said. “Cutlass? Pole-ax? Machete?Cleaver? Pick one and we’ll duel.” He licked his lips and gave a harsh laugh.Gabe could think of nothing to reply. He remained silent.“No? Dueling doesn’t appeal? Forget the weaponry, then. I’ll make it more fun,the way Trade Mart was,” he announced. “I’m going to offer you a trade.” Through the window, quite suddenly, the moonless night brightened. A pale goldenstream of light appeared across the floor, reaching almost to the bed. At thesame time, Claire’s hoarse, uneven breathing changed slightly. She seemedquieter, more comfortable. Jonas reached over and took her hand. He had beenholding it, stroking it, off and on throughout the night. The veins had beenthick and knotted under the thin, frail skin; the fingers were thickened at thejoints.Now, startlingly, the old woman’s hand felt different. Smoother. More pliant. Inthe sudden light he leaned down to look. But at that moment the moonlightdisappeared; the night was dark again. He thought of going to relight the oillamp in the corner, to bring it closer to Claire. But why? Let her sleep, hethought. She is at peace. Let her die without knowing the peril her son is in.Perhaps this is what death does, he thought, still touching her hand. Smoothsthe skin, eases the painful joints. Yes, he thought. This must be death coming.Jonas nodded off against his will and dozed fitfully. It had been such a long,exhausting day. He didn’t see the moonlight reappear, then recede, thenreappear. Claire’s hand slid away from his. He didn’t see the skin clear, itsdark spots fading, or how the thickened, discolored nails became shell-like andtranslucent. “A boat.” The offer was abrupt and angry.“I don’t need a boat.”Trademaster looked at him slyly. “It’s not a question of need, my stubborn,stupid lad. It all has to do with want. It’s always want.”Gabe stood there silently. He was cold. He was wet, still, from the river, andnow the stiff breeze had resumed. He rubbed his own arms briskly.“Chilly?” Trademaster said with a sneer, seeing him shiver. “I could loan you mycloak.” He twirled it. “You could come inside. I could envelop you.”Gabe didn’t reply. The thought of being inside the dark cloak revolted him.His eyes glittering, Trademaster said, “All right then, stand there and shiver.Let’s revisit the boat idea, shall we? Not need, but want. Do you want a boat?Wait—don’t answer yet. Let’s make it, oh, a fine sailboat. And part of the deal,guaranteed: billowing sails, a sunny day, a smooth lake, and a strong wind.”He leaned forward and beckoned with a thin, gloved finger. “Want it?”Not long ago Gabe would have wanted it very much indeed. But things had changedfor him. A boat no longer held any appeal. He no longer needed a boat. His questfor belonging, for love, had ended when he had knelt by a bed and held his dyingmother’s hand.He stood silently for a moment, trying to think of how to say no without furtherenraging Trademaster.“Wait! I’m going to add something!” The man leaned even closer.Gabe didn’t reply.“On the fine teak deck of this superior sailing vessel? Seated there, her hairblowing in the wind, smiling at you, looking at you veryaffectionately—extremely affectionately—as you sail your craft, maybe leaningforward to offer you something . . . Let me think. An apple—she has just peeleda fine round apple and she will offer you a bite, she being, of course, someoneyou care about deeply, maybe that freckle-faced girl named . . . Deirdre?“Want it?” Trademaster put his mouth to Gabe’s ear and breathed the questionhoarsely.“No,” Gabe said. “I don’t.”Trademaster laughed cruelly. “Of course you don’t,” he rasped. “You’re waitingfor something more? Let’s do it, then! Still the boat. You can have the boat andthe lake and the sunshine. And she’ll still be there, leaning forward, offeringyou food and sustenance and affection—but it’s not silly little Deirdre at all.Know who it is?“Got a guess?” he hissed.Gabe did. But he refused to say it. He tightened his hands on the smooth wood ofthe paddle. When he did, he felt the curved indentations, the places carved hereand there with names: Tarik. Nathaniel. Simon. Stefan.“It’s Claire,” Trademaster murmured to him. “Sweet, young Claire with the long,curly hair. She could be there with you. You know who Claire is, don’t you?“Want it? Want her?”Gabe felt the place where the name Jonas had been carved. The sweet cedar of thepaddle was infused with all of them: the ones who cared about him, the ones whoat this moment were sending strength to him. As his hand lingered on the wood,he suddenly felt something unfamiliar beneath his fingers. The paddle had beensmooth in this spot. Now, to his surprise, it had been carved. He felt therounded curve of a C. An L. And then the four letters that followed.“Don’t you dare to speak my mother’s name,” he said fiercely. “I don’t want yourtrade.”Trademaster stared at him with his hostile, gleaming eyes. Gabe remembered whathe knew, what Jonas had told him, of Einar, who had refused an offered trade andbeen mutilated so hideously. He saw that Trademaster was glancing now at theweapons near them on the ground.Frantically he tried again to remember what Jonas had told him. Use your gift.That was it. Use your gift!He was very frightened, but looking directly at Trademaster, he concentrated andwilled himself to veer."},{"pageContent":"THIRTEENThe silence came, lowering itself on him as if a curtain had been drawn. Therush of water behind him disappeared. The leaves on the surrounding trees stillmoved in the wind, but without sound. Gabe entered Trademaster. He found himselfwhirling through eons of time, destroying at random, screaming with rage andpain.He became Trademaster. He was sick with searing hatred, and in the endlessvortex through which he whirled, there was no comfort.He understood Trademaster, and the deep malevolence that inhabited him. It wastrue, what he had earlier sensed, that Trademaster was inhuman. He was not a manbut simply disguised as one. He was the force of evil, of all evil for all time.Gabriel floated and spun within the veer, being part of evil, feeling theanguish and loneliness of it, of having been cast out again and again throughouthistory. Of gathering strength once more. Gaining power. Weaponry. Treachery.Cruelty. The feelings were strong enough to destroy one human boy, but he foughtthrough them, concentrating on the knowledge of himself and his task. There mustbe something within the gift of the veer that would help him now when he emergedto face Trademaster for the final time. Jonas was startled out of his fitful doze by a sound.Claire was sitting up. The room was still quite dark, but he could see that shehad pushed her coverlet aside. Her eyes were bright, and her shoulders, oncefrail and hunched, were now straight and firm.“I’m hungry,” she said. Suddenly, within the simmering wrath and agony of the veer, Gabe felt hunger. Itstartled him. Such a small and unimportant feeling—one he had felt himself oftenas he headed home to dinner.But this, he realized, letting himself go deeper, to feel it completely, was nota yearning for a bowl of soup or piece of bread. Trademaster was starving.Gabe remembered what Jonas had told him about this kind of evil—that it is fedby its victims.He wants to know how his tragedies play out, Jonas had said. He likes to see howthings end. He gloats. It nourishes him.It came to him quickly and was so simple. Those who aren’t nourished will die.Those who starve will die.Knowing exactly what he must do, Gabriel shed the veer. Sound returned.Trademaster still stood before him, sneering, in his cloak. Nothing had changedexcept for Gabe’s understanding.He stood up straight and said loudly, “Remember Mentor?”Trademaster curled his lip and laughed. “Blotchy face? Old, saggy skin? Thatmiserable fool. Of course I remember him.”“He was my teacher.”“I ruined him.”“No. You ruined him for a while. But he’s himself again. He has his honor back.He’s happy.”On hearing Gabe’s words, Trademaster gasped slightly. He clutched his stomach asif a sharp pain had stabbed him. Or perhaps a gnawing ache? Hunger?“Remember someone named Einar?”Gabe had recoiled in horror when Jonas had related Einar’s terrible history tohim. Now he watched Trademaster’s face. “He’s the one who turned you down,remember? He said no to a trade!”Trademaster spat on the ground. He laughed in contempt. “I destroyed him.”“You didn’t, actually,” Gabe told him calmly. “He made a good life for himself.”“The life of a cripple?” Trademaster taunted, and briefly imitated Einar’slurching walk.“No. The life of a good man. He knows each lamb by name. He can make the soundsof every bird.“And a beautiful girl fell in love with him,” Gabe added.Trademaster groaned. He sank onto one knee. His cloak flapped around him, toolarge suddenly, as if the man inside had shrunk.“You remember her, I know. Her name was Claire,” Gabe said. “She was looking forher little boy. And you know what? She found me, Trademaster.“She was willing to give you everything she had. And you took it from her. Youtook her youth, and her beauty, and her energy and her health—”For a moment, thinking of his mother, Gabe couldn’t continue speaking. He fellsilent and choked back tears. Then he took a deep breath and went on, “—and itdidn’t matter. We found each other. None of it mattered but that.“You won’t ever know what that’s like, to love someone. In a way, I pity you.But I hope you starve.”Gabe found himself looking down on his enemy, who was hunched over on theground, whimpering.His voice, which had earlier been low and sinuous, now gave a loud drawn-outhowl, as if of grief. His eyes were closed, but he groped in the dark for theweapons that had been discarded on the ground. When he touched them, he howledagain. At that moment, the moon once more emerged from dissipating clouds andthe wind fell still. In the new light, Gabe could see that the weapons hadchanged. They were broken toys, bits of rusted tin, as if a careless child hadleft them out in the rain.“Your power is gone,” Gabe said.The only response was a moan. As Gabe watched, Trademaster shrank further. Soonhe had become a formless, unidentifiable heap of something that smelled of rot.Gabe nudged with his toe at what was left. It had never been human—he knew that.Now it fell away when he touched it with his foot, and became nothing. He staredat it for a long time as the night lifted and dawn seeped into the sky. Then hefound a sharp rock and dug into the earth until he had made a hole just theright size. He planted his paddle there and banked the damp earth around it sothat it stood and marked the place where Evil had been vanquished.Then he turned and looked at the river and at the pale wisps of smoke comingfrom chimneys in the village beyond. It was, all of it, familiar and beckoningand safe. He lowered himself into the gently flowing water and swam easilyacross. Sunrise woke Jonas. He had fallen asleep in the chair after feeding Claire someof the soup that Kira had brought. She had murmured a thank-you. Then he hadtucked the blanket around her and waited there beside the bed while she resumedher sleep. Her breathing was stronger. He realized that tonight would not be thenight of her death after all.Was there a chance that somehow Gabe—? Jonas didn’t allow himself to finish thethought. For a moment he had simply watched Claire sleep, marveling at herresilience. Then he had returned to his chair and his worry about the boy.Now, waking, he was stiff and disoriented. He yawned, stretched, and lookedaround, confused, then remembered Claire and rushed to the bed. But it wasempty, the covers thrown back.The door to the cottage was open. She was standing there in her nightdress,breathing deeply of the daybreak air. She was tall and slender, with copperyhair that fell in curls around her shoulders. Hearing him, she turned to Jonasand smiled.He thought he heard her say, “I see the sun.”Indeed, the sky was pink with dawn light. Then Jonas looked past Claire and sawGabe approaching on the path. THE END"},{"pageContent":"A GUIDE FOR DISCUSSION AND CLASSROOM USESONBY LOIS LOWRY"},{"pageContent":"[Image] [../images/00002.jpeg] About the Book Claire had hoped for a prestigious assignment when she turned twelve, andharbors disappointment when she is named Birthmother, the least favoredassignment. She is fourteen when she gives birth to “Product number Thirty-six,”but something goes terribly wrong with the birth. She is a miserable failure andreassigned to the Fish Hatchery, and number Thirty-six is whisked away to theNurturing Center. When Claire begins to experience an unfamiliar “yearning” forher baby, she makes excuses to leave the hatchery and visit the NurturingCenter, where she learns that her son isn’t thriving according to schedule. ThenJonas, the main character in The Giver, escapes with the baby to Elsewhere, andClaire has a mother’s urge to find her son. She leaves by boat and lands in aseaside village, where she meets a wise old woman and a lame sheep herder whohelp her come to terms with the secrets of her past and find a path to her son.Her greatest obstacle is the evil Trademaster, who demands that she tradesomething precious for a glimpse of her child. This is a story of a mother’slove, and a son’s desperate desire to discover his past. PRE-READING ACTIVITY Son is divided into three parts: “Book One: Before”, “Book Two: Between”, and“Book Three: Beyond.” Lead a class discussion about why it’s important to dealwith the “before” and “between” in life in order to understand and confront the“beyond.” DISCUSSION • Ask students to define community. Compare and contrast each community in whichClaire lives. How is she a mystery, or a foreigner, in all three communities? • Discuss how the rituals in the seaside community in “Book Two: Between” definethe culture of the people. How does Claire’s previous life resemble a sciencelab? What is the connection between science, culture, and the human experience?How does Jonas understand the human experience? Explain how Claire’s “Between”years help her make the transition to “Beyond.” • Claire is inexperienced with feelings. Why is she so confused when she beginsto have a “yearning” for her product? How does this feeling frighten her?Discuss how the emotion of love overtakes the emotion of fear. Explain howClaire’s “yearning” sets her free. • Discuss Claire’s reaction when she learns that she is a failure as aBirthmother. Debate whether she thinks she has failed herself or her community.Discuss whether her product’s failure to thrive contributes to additionalfeelings of failure. How does her failure as a Birthmother cause her shame inthe seaside community? Why is she considered “stained”? How does her failure asa “vessel” allow her to become a mother? • Secrets and lying are prohibited in the community. How do Claire’s secretfeelings cause her great pain? Debate whether Claire is guilty of lying orsimply creating excuses to wander from the Fish Hatchery to the NurturingCenter. The man who is caring for Thirty-six is also harboring a secret. Whatwould happen if the Chief Elder of the community discovered that he had namedthe product, now a newchild? What is symbolic about the newchild’s name? • What does the nurturer see in Thirty-six that others can’t see? Explain Gabe’sgift. Jonas gave Gabe life by taking him to Elsewhere. Debate the possibilitythat Jonas saw something “special” in the infant Gabe. What does he give him atthe end of Son? • In “Book One: Before,” Claire says that she is lonely, though she reallydoesn’t understand the meaning of the word. How does she confront her feelingsof loneliness as she makes her journey to “Between” and “Beyond”? Which othercharacters suffer from a similar loneliness? Debate whether Gabe is lonely orsimply needs to understand his history. • In “Book Two: Between,” Alys realizes that Claire is deeply wounded. How doesshe help Claire come to terms with “Before”? Why does Claire decide to tell Brynher story? How does Claire know that Lame Einar won’t be scornful of her past? • Discuss what Lame Einar means when he tells Claire, “It be better, I think, toclimb out in search of something, instead of hating what you’re leaving.”[part0030.html#px29] How is love stronger than hate? Discuss how Alysunderstands a mother’s love, even though she is not a mother herself. • Explain the statement, “Fear dims when you learn things.” [part0025.html#px16]Debate whether Claire’s fear intensifies or lessens as she continues her plightto find her son. What does she learn in “Book Two: Between” that dims her fears?Which characters in the seaside village help her gain knowledge? • Power may corrupt, but it can heal. How does Trademaster use his power tocorrupt? Jonas needs for Gabe to understand the difference between a uniquepower and a gift. Why does Jonas feel that having a gift is burdensome? Discusswhy Gabe is uncomfortable with his special gift. He uses his gift of veering todestroy evil. Debate whether he will ever use his gift again. • Discuss the symbolism of the river that flows through the community in “BookOne: Before.” Why are the people taught to fear the river? At what point doesClaire recognize that her fascination with the boat and the river may havemeaning? How is Gabe lured to the river in “Book Three: Beyond”? What issymbolic about Gabe’s swimming across the river at the end of the novel? Mighthis boat be displayed in the Vehicles of Arrival exhibit? REACHING ACROSS THE CURRICULUM Ask students to write a decree announcing the death of Trademaster. Include astatement about his evil use of power and how he attempted to destroy thevillage. The sled that brought Jonas and Gabe to the village is displayed in the Vehiclesof Arrival exhibit at the town museum. Ask students to imagine other vehiclesthat are included in the exhibit. Then have them write a description of eachvehicle for the museum exhibition catalogue. Alys is the midwife and healer in the seaside community in “Book Two: Between.”Have students make a list of the various herbs and plants that Alys uses in herpractice (e.g., goldenseal and chamomile). Instruct them to make an illustratedchart of the plants that includes their medicinal use. Claire struggles to understand the cycle of life. Dimitri, the head of theHatchery operation, is puzzled that she didn’t learn that in evolutionarybiology. Ask students to use books in the library or sites on the Internet tolearn about the study of evolutionary biology. Have them write a coursedescription for a college catalogue. The community in which Claire is born is colorless. In “Book Two: Between,” shebegins to learn colors. Have students list the various emotions that Claireexperiences throughout the novel (e.g., love, passion, anger, fear, hope) andask them to select a color that symbolizes each emotion. Then ask them to colorfreedom from Claire’s point of view. It’s a custom in the village where Claire finds Gabe to perform a welcomingceremony for new residents, at which time their histories are told. Ask studentsto discuss why Claire never received a proper welcome. Then have them plan andperform a welcoming ceremony, called “Son and Sun,” for Claire after she regainsher youth. Give roles to Gabe, Jonas, Kira, and Claire. Have students make a poster announcing Claire’s welcoming ceremony to the peoplein the village. Consider illustrating Claire as an old woman, created byTrademaster, and the young woman, brought back to life by Gabe. A ballad is a form of verse that tells a story and is often set to music. Askstudents to use books in the library or sites on the Internet to find examplesof musical ballads. Then have them write a ballad about Claire’s quest to findGabe. Jonas is the librarian, or keeper of knowledge, in the village. Ask students toselect books from the school or public library that Claire may place in thevillage library in honor of the following characters: the nurturer, Alys, LameEinar, Old Benedikt, Bryn, Gabe, Kira, and Jonas. Write a brief dedication foreach book. Jonas saves Gabe at the end of The Giver. Now it’s Gabe’s turn to save hisBirthmother.
