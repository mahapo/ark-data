No. Wrongword, Jonas thought. Frightened meant that deep, sickening feeling of somethingterrible about to happen. Frightened was the way he had felt a year ago when anunidentified aircraft had overflown the community twice. He had seen it bothtimes. Squinting toward the sky, he had seen the sleek jet, almost a blur at itshigh speed, go past, and a second later heard the blast of sound that followed.Then one more time, a moment later, from the opposite direction, the same plane.At first, he had been only fascinated. He had never seen aircraft so close, forit was against the rules for Pilots to fly over the community. Occasionally,when supplies were delivered by cargo planes to the landing field across theriver, the children rode their bicycles to the riverbank and watched, intrigued,the unloading and then the takeoff directed to the west, always away from thecommunity.But the aircraft a year ago had been different. It was not a squat, fat-belliedcargo plane but a needle-nosed single-pilot jet. Jonas, looking aroundanxiously, had seen others—adults as well as children—stop what they were doingand wait, confused, for an explanation of the frightening event.Then all of the citizens had been ordered to go into the nearest building andstay there. IMMEDIATELY, the rasping voice through the speakers had said, LEAVEYOUR BICYCLES WHERE THEY ARE.Instantly, obediently, Jonas had dropped his bike on its side on the path behindhis family's dwelling. He had run indoors and stayed there, alone. His parentswere both at work, and his little sister, Lily, was at the Childcare Centerwhere she spent her after-school hours.Looking through the front window, he had seen no people: none of the busyafternoon crew of Street Cleaners, Landscape Workers, and Food Delivery peoplewho usually populated the community at that time of day. He saw only theabandoned bikes here and there on their sides; an upturned wheel on one wasstill revolving slowly.He had been frightened then. The sense of his own community silent, waiting, hadmade his stomach churn. He had trembled.But it had been nothing. Within minutes the speakers had crackled again, and thevoice, reassuring now and less urgent, had explained that a Pilot-in-Traininghad misread his navigational instructions and made a wrong turn. Desperately thePilot had been trying to make his way back before his error was noticed.NEEDLESS TO SAY, HE WILL BE RELEASED, the voice had said, followed by silence.There was an ironic tone to that final message, as if the Speaker found itamusing; and Jonas had smiled a little, though he knew what a grim statement ithad been. For a contributing citizen to be released from the community was afinal decision, a terrible punishment, an overwhelming statement of failure.Even the children were scolded if they used the term lightly at play, jeering ata teammate who missed a catch or stumbled in a race. Jonas had done it once, hadshouted at his best friend, \"That's it, Asher! You're released!\" when Asher'sclumsy error had lost a match for his team. He had been taken aside for a briefand serious talk by the coach, had hung his head with guilt and embarrassment,and apologized to Asher after the game.Now, thinking about the feeling of fear as he pedaled home along the river path,he remembered that moment of palpable, stomach-sinking terror when the aircrafthad streaked above. It was not what he was feeling now with Decemberapproaching. He searched for the right word to describe his own feeling.Jonas was careful about language. Not like his friend, Asher, who talked toofast and mixed things up, scrambling words and phrases until they were barelyrecognizable and often very funny.Jonas grinned, remembering the morning that Asher had dashed into the classroom,late as usual, arriving breathlessly in the middle of the chanting of themorning anthem. When the class took their seats at the conclusion of thepatriotic hymn, Asher remained standing to make his public apology as wasrequired.\"I apologize for inconveniencing my learning community.\" Asher ran through thestandard apology phrase rapidly, still catching his breath. The Instructor andclass waited patiently for his explanation. The students had all been grinning,because they had listened to Asher's explanations so many times before.\"I left home at the correct time but when I was riding along near the hatchery,the crew was separating some salmon. I guess I just got distraught, watchingthem.\"I apologize to my classmates,\" Asher concluded. He smoothed his rumpled tunicand sat down.\"We accept your apology, Asher.\" The class recited the standard response inunison. Many of the students were biting their lips to keep from laughing.\"I accept your apology, Asher,\" the Instructor said. He was smiling. \"And Ithank you, because once again you have provided an opportunity for a lesson inlanguage. 'Distraught' is too strong an adjective to describe salmon-viewing.\"He turned and wrote \"distraught\" on the instructional board. Beside it he wrote\"distracted.\"Jonas, nearing his home now, smiled at the recollection. Thinking, still, as hewheeled his bike into its narrow port beside the door, he realized thatfrightened was the wrong word to describe his feelings, now that December wasalmost here. It was too strong an adjective.He had waited a long time for this special December. Now that it was almost uponhim, he wasn't frightened, but he was ... eager, he decided. He was eager for itto come. And he was excited, certainly. All of the Elevens were excited aboutthe event that would be coming so soon.But there was a little shudder of nervousness when he thought about it, aboutwhat might happen.Apprehensive, Jonas decided. That's what I am.\"Who wants to be the first tonight, for feelings?\" Jonas's father asked, at theconclusion of their evening meal.It was one of the rituals, the evening telling of feelings. Sometimes Jonas andhis sister, Lily, argued over turns, over who would get to go first. Theirparents, of course, were part of the ritual; they, too, told their feelings eachevening. But like all parents—all adults—they didn't fight and wheedle for theirturn.Nor did Jonas, tonight. His feelings were too complicated this evening. Hewanted to share them, but he wasn't eager to begin the process of siftingthrough his own complicated emotions, even with the help that he knew hisparents could give.\"You go, Lily,\" he said, seeing his sister, who was much younger—only aSeven—wiggling with impatience in her chair.\"I felt very angry this afternoon,\" Lily announced. \"My Childcare group was atthe play area, and we had a visiting group of Sevens, and they didn't obey therules at all. One of them—a male; I don't know his name—kept going right to thefront of the line for the slide, even though the rest of us were all waiting. Ifelt so angry at him. I made my hand into a fist, like this.\" She held up aclenched fist and the rest of the family smiled at her small defiant gesture.\"Why do you think the visitors didn't obey the rules?\" Mother asked.Lily considered, and shook her head. \"I don't know. They acted like ... like...\"\"Animals?\" Jonas suggested. He laughed.\"That's right,\" Lily said, laughing too. \"Like animals.\" Neither child knew whatthe word meant, exactly, but it was often used to describe someone uneducated orclumsy, someone who didn't fit in.\"Where were the visitors from?\" Father asked.Lily frowned, trying to remember. \"Our leader told us, when he made the welcomespeech, but I can't remember. I guess I wasn't paying attention. It was fromanother community. They had to leave very early, and they had their midday mealon the bus.\"Mother nodded. \"Do you think it's possible that their rules may be different?And so they simply didn't know what your play area rules were?\"Lily shrugged, and nodded. \"I suppose.\"\"You've visited other communities, haven't you?\" Jonas asked. \"My group has,often.\"Lily nodded again. \"When we were Sixes, we went and shared a whole school daywith a group of Sixes in their community.\"\"How did you feel when you were there?\"Lily frowned. \"I felt strange. Because their methods were different. They werelearning usages that my group hadn't learned yet, so we felt stupid.\"Father was listening with interest. \"I'm thinking, Lily,\" he said, \"about theboy who didn't obey the rules today. Do you think it's possible that he feltstrange and stupid, being in a new place with rules that he didn't know about?\"Lily pondered that. \"Yes,\" she said, finally. \"I feel a little sorry for him,\"Jonas said, \"even though I don't even know him. I feel sorry for anyone who isin a place where he feels strange and stupid.\"\"How do you feel now, Lily?\" Father asked. \"Still angry?\"\"I guess not,\" Lily decided. \"I guess I feel a little sorry for him. And sorry Imade a fist.\" She grinned.Jonas smiled back at his sister. Lily's feelings were always straightforward,fairly simple, usually easy to resolve. He guessed that his own had been, too,when he was a Seven.He listened politely, though not very attentively, while his father took histurn, describing a feeling of worry that he'd had that day at work: a concernabout one of the newchildren who wasn't doing well. Jonas's father's title wasNurturer. He and the other Nurturers were responsible for all the physical andemotional needs of every newchild during its earliest life. It was a veryimportant job, Jonas knew, but it wasn't one that interested him much.\"What gender is it?\" Lily asked.\"Male,\" Father said. \"He's a sweet little male with a lovely disposition. But heisn't growing as fast as he should, and he doesn't sleep soundly. We have him inthe extra care section for supplementary nurturing, but the committee'sbeginning to talk about releasing him.\"\"Oh, no,\" Mother murmured sympathetically. \"I know how sad that must make youfeel.\"Jonas and Lily both nodded sympathetically as well. Release of newchildren wasalways sad, because they hadn't had a chance to enjoy life within the communityyet. And they hadn't done anything wrong.There were only two occasions of release which were not punishment. Release ofthe elderly, which was a time of celebration for a life well and fully lived;and release of a newchild, which always brought a sense ofwhat-could-we-have-done. This was especially troubling for the Nurturers, likeFather, who felt they had failed somehow. But it happened very rarely.\"Well,\" Father said, \"I'm going to keep trying. I may ask the committee forpermission to bring him here at night, if you don't mind. You know what thenight-crew Nurturers are like. I think this little guy needs something extra.\"\"Of course,\" Mother said, and Jonas and Lily nodded. They had heard Fathercomplain about the night crew before. It was a lesser job, night-crew nurturing,assigned to those who lacked the interest or skills or insight for the morevital jobs of the daytime hours. Most of the people on the night crew had noteven been given spouses because they lacked, somehow, the essential capacity toconnect to others, which was required for the creation of a family unit.\"Maybe we could even keep him,\" Lily suggested sweetly, trying to look innocent.The look was fake, Jonas knew; they all knew.\"Lily,\" Mother reminded her, smiling, \"you know the rules.\"Two children—one male, one female—to each family unit. It was written veryclearly in the rules.Lily giggled. \"Well,\" she said, \"I thought maybe just this once.\"Next, Mother, who held a prominent position at the Department of Justice, talkedabout her feelings. Today a repeat offender had been brought before her, someonewho had broken the rules before. Someone who she hoped had been adequately andfairly punished, and who had been restored to his place: to his job, his home,his family unit. To see him brought before her a second time caused heroverwhelming feelings of frustration and anger. And even guilt, that she hadn'tmade a difference in his life.\"I feel frightened, too, for him,\" she confessed. \"You know that there's nothird chance. The rules say that if there's a third transgression, he simply hasto be released.\" Jonas shivered. He knew it happened. There was even a boy inhis group of Elevens whose father had been released years before. No one evermentioned it; the disgrace was unspeakable. It was hard to imagine.Lily stood up and went to her mother. She stroked her mother's arm.From his place at the table, Father reached over and took her hand. Jonasreached for the other.One by one, they comforted her. Soon she smiled, thanked them, and murmured thatshe felt soothed.The ritual continued. \"Jonas?\" Father asked. \"You're last, tonight.\"Jonas sighed. This evening he almost would have preferred to keep his feelingshidden. But it was, of course, against the rules.\"I'm feeling apprehensive,\" he confessed, glad that the appropriate descriptiveword had finally come to him.\"Why is that, son?\" His father looked concerned.\"I know there's really nothing to worry about,\" Jonas explained, \"and that everyadult has been through it. I know you have, Father, and you too, Mother. Butit's the Ceremony that I'm apprehensive about. It's almost December.\"Lily looked up, her eyes wide. \"The Ceremony of Twelve,\" she whispered in anawed voice. Even the smallest children—Lily's age and younger—knew that it layin the future for each of them.\"I'm glad you told us of your feelings,\" Father said.\"Lily,\" Mother said, beckoning to the little girl, \"Go on now and get into yournightclothes. Father and I are going to stay here and talk to Jonas for awhile.\"Lily sighed, but obediently she got down from her chair. \"Privately?\" she asked.Mother nodded. \"Yes,\" she said, \"this talk will be a private one with Jonas.\""},{"pageContent":"2Jonas watched as his father poured a fresh cup of coffee.He waited.\"You know,\" his father finally said, \"every December was exciting to me when Iwas young. And it has been for you and Lily, too, I'm sure. Each December bringssuch changes.\"Jonas nodded. He could remember the Decembers back to When he had become, well,probably a Four. The earlier ones were lost to him. But he observed them eachyear, and he remembered Lily's earliest Decembers. He remembered when his familyreceived Lily, the day she was named, the day that she had become a One.The Ceremony for the Ones was always noisy and fun. Each December, all thenewchildren born in the previous year turned One. One at a time—there werealways fifty in each year's group, if none had been released—they had beenbrought to the stage by the Nurturers who had cared for them since birth. Somewere already walking, wobbly on their unsteady legs; others were no more than afew days old, wrapped in blankets, held by their Nurturers.\"I enjoy the Naming,\" Jonas said.His mother agreed, smiling. \"The year we got Lily, we knew, of course, that we'dreceive our female, because we'd made our application and been approved. But I'dbeen wondering and wondering what her name would be.\"\"I could have sneaked a look at the list prior to the ceremony,\" Fatherconfided. \"The committee always makes the list in advance, and it's right therein the office at the Nurturing Center.\"As a matter of fact,\" he went on, \"I feel a little guilty about this. But I didgo in this afternoon and looked to see if this year's Naming list had been madeyet. It was right there in the office, and I looked up number Thirty-six—that'sthe little guy I've been concerned about—because it occurred to me that it mightenhance his nurturing if I could call him by a name. Just privately, of course,when no one else is around.\"\"Did you find it?\" Jonas asked. He was fascinated. It didn't seem a terriblyimportant rule, but the fact that his father had broken a rule at all awed him.He glanced at his mother, the one responsible for adherence to the rules, andwas relieved that she was smiling.His father nodded. \"His name—if he makes it to the Naming without beingreleased, of course—is to be Gabriel. So I whisper that to him when I feed himevery four hours, and during exercise and playtime. If no one can hear me.\"I call him Gabe, actually,\" he said, and grinned.\"Gabe.\" Jonas tried it out. A good name, he decided.Though Jonas had only become a Five the year that they acquired Lily and learnedher name, he remembered the excitement, the conversations at home, wonderingabout her: how she would look, who she would be, how she would fit into theirestablished family unit. He remembered climbing the steps to the stage with hisparents, his father by his side that year instead of with the Nurturers, sinceit was the year that he would be given a newchild of his own.He remembered his mother taking the newchild, his sister, into her arms, whilethe document was read to the assembled family units. \"Newchild Twenty-three,\"the Namer had read. \"Lily.\"He remembered his father's look of delight, and that his father had whispered,\"She's one of my favorites. I was hoping for her to be the one.\" The crowd hadclapped, and Jonas had grinned. He liked his sister's name. Lily, barely awake,had waved her small fist. Then they had stepped down to make room for the nextfamily unit.\"When I was an Eleven,\" his father said now, \"as you are, Jonas, I was veryimpatient, waiting for the Ceremony of Twelve. It's a long two days. I rememberthat I enjoyed the Ones, as I always do, but that I didn't pay much attention tothe other ceremonies, except for my sister's. She became a Nine that year, andgot her bicycle. I'd been teaching her to ride mine, even though technically Iwasn't supposed to.\"Jonas laughed. It was one of the few rules that was not taken very seriously andwas almost always broken. The children all received their bicycles at Nine; theywere not allowed to ride bicycles before then. But almost always, the olderbrothers and sisters had secretly taught the younger ones. Jonas had beenthinking already about teaching Lily.There was talk about changing the rule and giving the bicycles at an earlierage. A committee was studying the idea. When something went to a committee forstudy, the people always joked about it. They said that the committee memberswould become Elders by the time the rule change was made.Rules were very hard to change. Sometimes, if it was a very importantrule—unlike the one governing the age for bicycles—it would have to go,eventually, to The Receiver for a decision. The Receiver was the most importantElder. Jonas had never even seen him, that he knew of; someone in a position ofsuch importance lived and worked alone. But the committee would never bother TheReceiver with a question about bicycles; they would simply fret and argue aboutit themselves for years, until the citizens forgot that it had ever gone to themfor study.His father continued. \"So I watched and cheered when my sister, Katya, became aNine and removed her hair ribbons and got her bicycle,\" Father went on. \"Then Ididn't pay much attention to the Tens and Elevens. And finally, at the end ofthe second day, which seemed to go on forever, it was my turn. It was theCeremony of Twelve.\"Jonas shivered. He pictured his father, who must have been a shy and quiet boy,for he was a shy and quiet man, seated with his group, waiting to be called tothe stage. The Ceremony of Twelve was the last of the Ceremonies. The mostimportant.\"I remember how proud my parents looked—and my sister, too; even though shewanted to be out riding the bicycle publicly, she stopped fidgeting and was verystill and attentive when my turn came.\"But to be honest, Jonas,\" his father said, \"for me there was not the element ofsuspense that there is with your Ceremony. Because I was already fairly certainof what my Assignment was to be.\"Jonas was surprised. There was no way, really, to know in advance. It was asecret selection, made by the leaders of the community, the Committee of Elders,who took the responsibility so seriously that there were never even any jokesmade about Assignments.His mother seemed surprised, too. \"How could you have known?\" she asked.His father smiled his gentle smile. \"Well, it was clear to me—and my parentslater confessed that it had been obvious to them, too—what my aptitude was. Ihad always loved the newchildren more than anything. When my friends in my agegroup were holding bicycle races, or building toy vehicles or bridges with theirconstruction sets, or—\"\"All the things I do with my friends,\" Jonas pointed out, and his mother noddedin agreement.\"I always participated, of course, because as children we must experience all ofthose things. And I studied hard in school, as you do, Jonas. But again andagain, during free time, I found myself drawn to the newchildren. I spent almostall of my volunteer hours helping in the Nurturing Center. Of course the Eldersknew that, from their observation.\"Jonas nodded. During the past year he had been aware of the increasing level ofobservation. In school, at recreation time, and during volunteer hours, he hadnoticed the Elders watching him and the other Elevens. He had seen them takingnotes. He knew, too, that the Elders were meeting for long hours with all of theinstructors that he and the other Elevens had had during their years of school.\"So I expected it, and I was pleased, but not at all surprised, when myAssignment was announced as Nurturer,\" Father explained.\"Did everyone applaud, even though they weren't surprised?\" Jonas asked.\"Oh, of course. They were happy for me, that my Assignment was what I wantedmost. I felt very fortunate.\" His father smiled.\"Were any of the Elevens disappointed, your year?\" Jonas asked. Unlike hisfather, he had no idea what his Assignment would be. But he knew that some woulddisappoint him. Though he respected his father's work, Nurturer would not be hiswish. And he didn't envy Laborers at all.His father thought. \"No, I don't think so. Of course the Elders are so carefulin their observations and selections.\"\"I think it's probably the most important job in our community,\" his mothercommented.\"My friend Yoshiko was surprised by her selection as Doctor,\" Father said, \"butshe was thrilled. And let's see, there was Andrei—I remember that when we wereboys he never wanted to do physical things. He spent all the recreation time hecould with his construction set, and his volunteer hours were always on buildingsites. The Elders knew that, of course. Andrei was given the Assignment ofEngineer and he was delighted.\"\"Andrei later designed the bridge that crosses the river to the west of town,\"Jonas's mother said. \"It wasn't there when we were children.\"\"There are very rarely disappointments, Jonas. I don't think you need to worryabout that,\" his father reassured him. \"And if there are, you know there's anappeal process.\" But they all laughed at that—an appeal went to a committee forstudy.\"I worry a little about Asher's Assignment,\" Jonas confessed. \"Asher's such fun.But he doesn't really have any serious interests. He makes a game out ofeverything.\"His father chuckled. \"You know,\" he said, \"I remember when Asher was a newchildat the Nurturing Center, before he was named. He never cried. He giggled andlaughed at everything. All of us on the staff enjoyed nurturing Asher.\"\"The Elders know Asher,\" his mother said. \"They'll find exactly the rightAssignment for him. I don't think you need to worry about him. But, Jonas, letme warn you about something that may not have occurred to you. I know I didn'tthink about it until after my Ceremony of Twelve.\"\"What's that?\"\"Well, it's the last of the Ceremonies, as you know. After Twelve, age isn'timportant. Most of us even lose track of how old we are as time passes, thoughthe information is in the Hall of Open Records, and we could go and look it upif we wanted to. What's important is the preparation for adult life, and thetraining you'll receive in your Assignment.\"\"I know that,\" Jonas said. \"Everyone knows that.\"\"But it means,\" his mother went on, \"that you'll move into a new group. And eachof your friends will. You'll no longer be spending your time with your group ofElevens. After the Ceremony of Twelve, you'll be with your Assignment group,with those in training. No more volunteer hours. No more recreation hours. Soyour friends will no longer be as close.\"Jonas shook his head. \"Asher and I will always be friends,\" he said firmly. \"Andthere will still be school.\"\"That's true,\" his father agreed. \"But what your mother said is true as well.There will be changes.\"\"Good changes, though,\" his mother pointed out. \"After my Ceremony of Twelve, Imissed my childhood recreation. But when I entered my training for Law andJustice, I found myself with people who shared my interests. I made friends on anew level, friends of all ages.\"\"Did you still play at all, after Twelve?\" Jonas asked.\"Occasionally,\" his mother replied. \"But it didn't seem as important to me.\"\"I did,\" his father said, laughing. \"I still do. Every day, at the NurturingCenter, I play bounce-on-the-knee, and peek-a-boo, and hug-the-teddy.\" Hereached over and stroked Jonas's neatly trimmed hair. \"Fun doesn't end when youbecome Twelve.\"Lily appeared, wearing her nightclothes, in the doorway. She gave an impatientsigh. \"This is certainly a very long private conversation,\" she said. \"And thereare certain people waiting for their comfort object.\"\"Lily,\" her mother said fondly, \"you're very close to being an Eight, and whenyou're an Eight, your comfort object will be taken away. It will be recycled tothe younger children. You should be starting to go off to sleep without it.\"But her father had already gone to the shelf and taken down the stuffed elephantwhich was kept there. Many of the comfort objects, like Lily's, were soft,stuffed, imaginary creatures. Jonas's had been called a bear.\"Here you are, Lily-billy,\" he said. \"I'll come help you remove your hairribbons.\"Jonas and his mother rolled their eyes, yet they watched affectionately as Lilyand her father headed to her sleeping-room with the stuffed elephant that hadbeen given to her as her comfort object when she was born. His mother moved toher big desk and opened her briefcase; her work never seemed to end, even whenshe was at home in the evening. Jonas went to his own desk and began to sortthrough his school papers for the evening's assignment. But his mind was stillon December and the coming Ceremony.Though he had been reassured by the talk with his parents, he hadn't theslightest idea what Assignment the Elders would be selecting for his future, orhow he might feel about it when the day came."},{"pageContent":"3\"Oh, look!\" Lily squealed in delight. \"Isn't he cute? Look how tiny he is! Andhe has funny eyes like yours, Jonas!\" Jonas glared at her. He didn't like itthat she had mentioned his eyes. He waited for his father to chastise Lily. ButFather was busy unstrapping the carrying basket from the back of his bicycle.Jonas walked over to look.It was the first thing Jonas noticed as he looked at the newchild peering upcuriously from the basket. The pale eyes.Almost every citizen in the community had dark eyes. His parents did, and Lilydid, and so did all of his group members and friends. But there were a fewexceptions: Jonas himself, and a female Five who he had noticed had thedifferent, lighter eyes. No one mentioned such things; it was not a rule, butwas considered rude to call attention to things that were unsettling ordifferent about individuals. Lily, he decided, would have to learn that soon, orshe would be called in for chastisement because of her insensitive chatter.Father put his bike into its port. Then he picked up the basket and carried itinto the house. Lily followed behind, but she glanced back over her shoulder atJonas and teased, \"Maybe he had the same Birthmother as you.\"Jonas shrugged. He followed them inside. But he had been startled by thenewchild's eyes. Mirrors were rare in the community; they weren't forbidden, butthere was no real need of them, and Jonas had simply never bothered to look athimself very often even when he found himself in a location where a mirrorexisted. Now, seeing the newchild and its expression, he was reminded that thelight eyes were not only a rarity but gave the one who had them a certainlook—what was it? Depth, he decided; as if one were looking into the clear waterof the river, down to the bottom, where things might lurk which hadn't beendiscovered yet. He felt self-conscious, realizing that he, too, had that look.He went to his desk, pretending not to be interested in the newchild. On theother side of the room, Mother and Lily were bending over to watch as Fatherunwrapped its blanket.\"What's his comfort object called?\" Lily asked, picking up the stuffed creaturewhich had been placed beside the newchild in his basket.Father glanced at it. \"Hippo,\" he said.Lily giggled at the strange word. \"Hippo,\" she repeated, and put the comfortobject down again. She peered at the unwrapped newchild, who waved his arms.\"I think newchildren are so cute,\" Lily sighed. \"I hope I get assigned to be aBirthmother.\"\"Lily!\" Mother spoke very sharply. \"Don't say that. There's very little honor inthat Assignment.\"\"But I was talking to Natasha. You know the Ten who lives around the corner? Shedoes some of her volunteer hours at the Birthing Center. And she told me thatthe Birthmothers get wonderful food, and they have very gentle exercise periods,and most of the time they just play games and amuse themselves while they'rewaiting. I think I'd like that,\" Lily said petulantly.\"Three years,\" Mother told her firmly. \"Three births, and that's all. After thatthey are Laborers for the rest of their adult lives, until the day that theyenter the House of the Old. Is that what you want, Lily? Three lazy years, andthen hard physical labor until you are old?\"\"Well, no, I guess not,\" Lily acknowledged reluctantly.Father turned the newchild onto his tummy in the basket. He sat beside it andrubbed its small back with a rhythmic motion. \"Anyway, Lily-billy,\" he saidaffectionately, \"the Birthmothers never even get to see newchildren. If youenjoy the little ones so much, you should hope for an Assignment as Nurturer.\"\"When you're an Eight and start your volunteer hours, you can try some at theNurturing Center,\" Mother suggested.\"Yes, I think I will,\" Lily said. She knelt beside the basket. \"What did you sayhis name is? Gabriel? Hello, Gabriel,\" she said in a singsong voice. Then shegiggled. \"Ooops,\" she whispered. \"I think he's alseep. I guess I'd better bequiet.\"Jonas turned to the school assignments on his desk. Some chance of that, hethought. Lily was never quiet. Probably she should hope for an Assignment asSpeaker, so that she could sit in the office with the microphone all day, makingannouncements. He laughed silently to himself, picturing his sister droning onin the self-important voice that all the Speakers seemed to develop, sayingthings like, ATTENTION, THIS IS A REMINDER TO FEMALES UNDER NINE THAT HAIRRIBBONS ARE TO BE NEATLY TIED AT ALL TIMES.He turned toward Lily and noticed to his satisfaction that her ribbons were, asusual, undone and dangling. There would be an announcement like that quite soon,he felt certain, and it would be directed mainly at Lily, though her name, ofcourse, would not be mentioned. Everyone would know.Everyone had known, he remembered with humiliation, that the announcementATTENTION, THIS IS A REMINDER TO MALE ELEVENS THAT OBJECTS ARE NOT TO BE REMOVEDFROM THE RECREATION AREA AND THAT SNACKS ARE TO BE EATEN, NOT HOARDED had beenspecifically directed at him, the day last month that he had taken an applehome. No one had mentioned it, not even his parents, because the publicannouncement had been sufficient to produce the appropriate remorse. He had, ofcourse, disposed of the apple and made his apology to the Recreation Directorthe next morning, before school.Jonas thought again about that incident. He was still bewildered by it. Not bythe announcement or the necessary apology; those were standard procedures, andhe had deserved them—but by the incident itself. He probably should have broughtup his feeling of bewilderment that very evening when the family unit had sharedtheir feelings of the day. But he had not been able to sort out and put words tothe source of his confusion, so he had let it pass.It had happened during the recreation period, when he had been playing withAsher. Jonas had casually picked up an apple from the basket where the snackswere kept, and had thrown it to his friend. Asher had thrown it back, and theyhad begun a simple game of catch.There had been nothing special about it; it was an activity that he hadperformed countless times: throw, catch; throw, catch. It was effortless forJonas, and even boring, though Asher enjoyed it, and playing catch was arequired activity for Asher because it would improve his hand-eye coordination,which was not up to standards.But suddenly Jonas had noticed, following the path of the apple through the airwith his eyes, that the piece of fruit had—well, this was the part that hecouldn't adequately understand—the apple had changed. Just for an instant. Ithad changed in mid-air, he remembered. Then it was in his hand, and he looked atit carefully, but it was the same apple. Unchanged. The same size and shape: aperfect sphere. The same nondescript shade, about the same shade as his owntunic.There was absolutely nothing remarkable about that apple. He had tossed it backand forth between his hands a few times, then thrown it again to Asher. Andagain—in the air, for an instant only—it had changed.It had happened four times. Jonas had blinked, looked around, and then testedhis eyesight, squinting at the small print on the identification badge attachedto his tunic. He read his name quite clearly. He could also clearly see Asher atthe other end of the throwing area. And he had had no problem catching theapple.Jonas had been completely mystified.\"Ash?\" he had called. \"Does anything seem strange to you? About the apple?\"\"Yes,\" Asher called back, laughing. \"It jumps out of my hand onto the ground!\"Asher had just dropped it once again.So Jonas laughed too, and with his laughter tried to ignore his uneasyconviction that something had happened. But he had taken the apple home, againstthe recreation area rules. That evening, before his parents and Lily arrived atthe dwelling, he had held it in his hands and looked at it carefully. It wasslightly bruised now, because Asher had dropped it several times. But there wasnothing at all unusual about the apple.He had held a magnifying glass to it. He had tossed it several times across theroom, watching, and then rolled it around and around on his desktop, waiting forthe thing to happen again.But it hadn't. The only thing that happened was the announcement later thatevening over the speaker, the announcement that had singled him out withoutusing his name, that had caused both of his parents to glance meaningfully athis desk where the apple still lay.Now, sitting at his desk, staring at his schoolwork as his family hovered overthe newchild in its basket, he shook his head, trying to forget the oddincident. He forced himself to arrange his papers and try to study a littlebefore the evening meal. The newchild, Gabriel, stirred and whimpered, andFather spoke softly to Lily, explaining the feeding procedure as he opened thecontainer that held the formula and equipment.The evening proceeded as all evenings did in the family unit, in the dwelling,in the community: quiet, reflective, a time for renewal and preparation for theday to come. It was different only in the addition to it of the newchild withhis pale, solemn, knowing eyes."},{"pageContent":"4Jonas rode at a leisurely pace, glancing at the bikeports beside the buildingsto see if he could spot Asher's. He didn't often do his volunteer hours with hisfriend because Asher frequently fooled around and made serious work a littledifficult. But now, with Twelve coming so soon and the volunteer hours ending,it didn't seem to matter.The freedom to choose where to spend those hours had always seemed a wonderfulluxury to Jonas; other hours of the day were so carefully regulated.He remembered when he had become an Eight, as Lily would do shortly, and hadbeen faced with that freedom of choice. The Eights always set out on their firstvolunteer hour a little nervously, giggling and staying in groups of friends.They almost invariably did their hours on Recreation Duty first, helping withthe younger ones in a place where they still felt comfortable. But withguidance, as they developed self-confidence and maturity, they moved on to otherjobs, gravitating toward those that would suit their own interests and skills.A male Eleven named Benjamin had done his entire nearly-Four years in theRehabilitation Center, working with citizens who had been injured. It wasrumored that he was as skilled now as the Rehabilitation Directors themselves,and that he had even developed some machines and methods to hastenrehabilitation. There was no doubt that Benjamin would receive his Assignment tothat field and would probably be permitted to bypass most of the training.Jonas was impressed by the things Benjamin had achieved. He knew him, of course,since they had always been groupmates, but they had never talked about the boy'saccomplishments because such a conversation would have been awkward forBenjamin. There was never any comfortable way to mention or discuss one'ssuccesses without breaking the rule against bragging, even if one didn't meanto. It was a minor rule, rather like rudeness, punishable only by gentlechastisement. But still. Better to steer clear of an occasion governed by a rulewhich would be so easy to break.The area of dwellings behind him, Jonas rode past the community structures,hoping to spot Asher's bicycle parked beside one of the small factories oroffice buildings. He passed the Childcare Center where Lily stayed after school,and the play areas surrounding it. He rode through the Central Plaza and thelarge Auditorium where public meetings were held.Jonas slowed and looked at the nametags on the bicycles lined up outside theNurturing Center. Then he checked those outside Food Distribution; it was alwaysfun to help with the deliveries, and he hoped he would find his friend there sothat they could go together on the daily rounds, carrying the cartons ofsupplies into the dwellings of the community. But he finally found Asher'sbicycle—leaning, as usual, instead of upright in its port, as it should havebeen—at the House of the Old.There was only one other child's bicycle there, that of a female Eleven namedFiona. Jonas liked Fiona. She was a good student, quiet and polite, but she hada sense of fun as well, and it didn't surprise him that she was working withAsher today. He parked his bicycle neatly in the port beside theirs and enteredthe building.\"Hello, Jonas,\" the attendant at the front desk said. She handed him the sign-upsheet and stamped her own official seal beside his signature. All of hisvolunteer hours would be carefully tabulated at the Hall of Open Records. Once,long ago, it was whispered among the children, an Eleven had arrived at theCeremony of Twelve only to hear a public announcement that he had not completedthe required number of volunteer hours and would not, therefore, be given hisAssignment. He had been permitted an additional month in which to complete thehours, and then given his Assignment privately, with no applause, nocelebration: a disgrace that had clouded his entire future.\"It's good to have some volunteers here today,\" the attendant told him. \"Wecelebrated a release this morning, and that always throws the schedule off alittle, so things get backed up.\" She looked at a printed sheet. \"Let's see.Asher and Fiona are helping in the bathing room. Why don't you join them there?You know where it is, don't you?\"Jonas nodded, thanked her, and walked down the long hallway. He glanced into therooms on either side. The Old were sitting quietly, some visiting and talkingwith one another, others doing handwork and simple crafts. A few were asleep.Each room was comfortably furnished, the floors covered with thick carpeting. Itwas a serene and slow-paced place, unlike the busy centers of manufacture anddistribution where the daily work of the community occurred.Jonas was glad that he had, over the years, chosen to do his hours in a varietyof places so that he could experience the differences. He realized, though, thatnot focusing on one area meant he was left with not the slightest idea—not evena guess—of what his Assignment would be.He laughed softly. Thinking about the Ceremony again, Jonas? he teased himself.But he suspected that with the date so near, probably all of his friends were,too.He passed a Caretaker walking slowly with one of the Old in the hall. \"Hello,Jonas,\" the young uniformed man said, smiling pleasantly. The woman beside him,whose arm he held, was hunched over as she shuffled along in her soft slippers.She looked toward Jonas and smiled, but her dark eyes were clouded and blank. Herealized she was blind.He entered the bathing room with its warm moist air and scent of cleansinglotions. He removed his tunic, hung it carefully on a wall hook, and put on thevolunteer's smock that was folded on a shelf.\"Hi, Jonas!\" Asher called from the corner where he was kneeling beside a tub.Jonas saw Fiona nearby, at a different tub. She looked up and smiled at him, butshe was busy, gently washing a man who lay in the warm water.Jonas greeted them and the caretaking attendants at work nearby. Then he went tothe row of padded lounging chairs where others of the Old were waiting. He hadworked here before; he knew what to do.\"Your turn, Larissa,\" he said, reading the nametag on the woman's robe. \"I'lljust start the water and then help you up.\" He pressed the button on a nearbyempty tub and watched as the warm water flowed in through the many smallopenings on the sides. The tub would be filled in a minute and the water flowwould stop automatically.He helped the woman from the chair, led her to the tub, removed her robe, andsteadied her with his hand on her arm as she stepped in and lowered herself. Sheleaned back and sighed with pleasure, her head on a soft cushioned headrest.\"Comfortable?\" he asked, and she nodded, her eyes closed. Jonas squeezedcleansing lotion onto the clean sponge at the edge of the tub and began to washher frail body.Last night he had watched as his father bathed the newchild. This was much thesame: the fragile skin, the soothing water, the gentle motion of his hand,slippery with soap. The relaxed, peaceful smile on the woman's face reminded himof Gabriel being bathed.And the nakedness, too. It was against the rules for children or adults to lookat another's nakedness; but the rule did not apply to newchildren or the Old.Jonas was glad. It was a nuisance to keep oneself covered while changing forgames, and the required apology if one had by mistake glimpsed another's bodywas always awkward. He couldn't see why it was necessary. He liked the feelingof safety here in this warm and quiet room; he liked the expression of trust onthe woman's face as she lay in the water unprotected, exposed, and free.From the corner of his eye he could see his friend Fiona help the old man fromthe tub and tenderly pat his thin, naked body dry with an absorbant cloth. Shehelped him into his robe.Jonas thought Larissa had drifted into sleep, as the Old often did, and he wascareful to keep his motions steady and gentle so he wouldn't wake her. He wassurprised when she spoke, her eyes still closed.\"This morning we celebrated the release of Roberto,\" she told him. \"It waswonderful.\"\"I knew Roberto!\" Jonas said. \"I helped with his feeding the last time I washere, just a few weeks ago. He was a very interesting man.\"Larissa opened her eyes happily. \"They told his whole life before they releasedhim,\" she said. \"They always do. But to be honest,\" she whispered with amischievous look, \"some of the tellings are a little boring. I've even seen someof the Old fall asleep during tellings—when they released Edna recently. Did youknow Edna?\"Jonas shook his head. He couldn't recall anyone named Edna.\"Well, they tried to make her life sound meaningful. And of course,\" she addedprimly, \"all lives are meaningful, I don't mean that they aren't. But Edna. Mygoodness. She was a Birthmother, and then she worked in Food Production foryears, until she came here. She never even had a family unit.\"Larissa lifted her head and looked around to make sure no one else waslistening. Then she confided, \"I don't think Edna was very smart.\"Jonas laughed. He rinsed her left arm, laid it back into the water, and began towash her feet. She murmured with pleasure as he massaged her feet with thesponge.\"But Roberto's life was wonderful,\" Larissa went on, after a moment. \"He hadbeen an Instructor of Elevens—you know how important that is—and he'd been onthe Planning Committee. And—goodness, I don't know how he found the time—he alsoraised two very successful children, and he was also the one who did thelandscaping design for the Central Plaza. He didn't do the actual labor, ofcourse.\"\"Now your back. Lean forward and I'll help you sit up.\" Jonas put his arm aroundher and supported her as she sat. He squeezed the sponge against her back andbegan to rub her sharp-boned shoulders. \"Tell me about the celebration.\"\"Well, there was the telling of his life. That is always first. Then the toast.We all raised our glasses and cheered. We chanted the anthem. He made a lovelygood-bye speech. And several of us made little speeches wishing him well. Ididn't, though. I've never been fond of public speaking.\"He was thrilled. You should have seen the look on his face when they let himgo.\"Jonas slowed the strokes of his hand on her back thoughtfully. \"Larissa,\" heasked, \"what happens when they make the actual release? Where exactly didRoberto go?\"She lifted her bare wet shoulders in a small shrug. \"I don't know. I don't thinkanybody does, except the committee. He just bowed to all of us and then walked,like they all do, through the special door in the Releasing Room. But you shouldhave seen his look. Pure happiness, I'd call it.\"Jonas grinned. \"I wish I'd been there to see it.\"Larissa frowned. \"I don't know why they don't let children come. Not enoughroom, I guess. They should enlarge the Releasing Room.\"\"We'll have to suggest that to the committee. Maybe they'd study it,\" Jonas saidslyly, and Larissa chortled with laughter.\"Right!\" she hooted, and Jonas helped her from the tub."},{"pageContent":"5Usually, at the morning ritual when the family members told their dreams, Jonasdidn't contribute much. He rarely dreamed. Sometimes he awoke with a feeling offragments afloat in his sleep, but he couldn't seem to grasp them and put themtogether into something worthy of telling at the ritual.But this morning was different. He had dreamed very vividly the night before.His mind wandered while Lily, as usual, recounted a lengthy dream, this one afrightening one in which she had, against the rules, been riding her mother'sbicycle and been caught by the Security Guards.They all listened carefully and discussed with Lily the warning that the dreamhad given.\"Thank you for your dream, Lily.\" Jonas said the standard phrase automatically,and tried to pay better attention while his mother told of a dream fragment, adisquieting scene where she had been chastised for a rule infraction she didn'tunderstand. Together they agreed that it probably resulted from her feelingswhen she had reluctantly dealt punishment to the citizen who had broken themajor rules a second time.Father said that he had had no dreams.\"Gabe?\" Father asked, looking down at the basket where the newchild lay gurglingafter his feeding, ready to be taken back to the Nurturing Center for the day.They all laughed. Dream-telling began with Threes. If newchildren dreamed, noone knew.\"Jonas?\" Mother asked. They always asked, though they knew how rarely Jonas hada dream to tell.\"I did dream last night,\" Jonas told them. He shifted in his chair, frowning.\"Good,\" Father said. \"Tell us.\"\"The details aren't clear, really,\" Jonas explained, trying to recreate the odddream in his mind. \"I think I was in the bathing room at the House of the Old.\"\"That's where you were yesterday,\" Father pointed out.Jonas nodded. \"But it wasn't really the same. There was a tub, in the dream. Butonly one. And the real bathing room has rows and rows of them. But the room inthe dream was warm and damp. And I had taken off my tunic, but hadn't put on thesmock, so my chest was bare. I was perspiring, because it was so warm. And Fionawas there, the way she was yesterday.\"\"Asher, too?\" Mother asked.Jonas shook his head. \"No. It was only me and Fiona, alone in the room, standingbeside the tub. She was laughing. But I wasn't. I was almost a little angry ather, in the dream, because she wasn't taking me seriously.\"\"Seriously about what?\" Lily asked.Jonas looked at his plate. For some reason that he didn't understand, he feltslightly embarrassed. \"I think I was trying to convince her that she should getinto the tub of water.\"He paused. He knew he had to tell it all, that it was not only all right butnecessary to tell all of a dream. So he forced himself to relate the part thatmade him uneasy.\"I wanted her to take off her clothes and get into the tub,\" he explainedquickly. \"I wanted to bathe her. I had the sponge in my hand. But she wouldn't.She kept laughing and saying no.\"He looked up at his parents. \"That's all,\" he said.\"Can you describe the strongest feeling in your dream, son?\" Father asked.Jonas thought about it. The details were murky and vague. But the feelings wereclear, and flooded him again now as he thought. \"The wanting,\" he said. \"I knewthat she wouldn't. And I think I knew that she shouldn't. But I wanted it soterribly. I could feel the wanting all through me.\"\"Thank you for your dream, Jonas,\" Mother said after a moment. She glanced atFather.\"Lily,\" Father said, \"it's time to leave for school. Would you walk beside methis morning and keep an eye on the newchild's basket? We want to be certain hedoesn't wiggle himself loose.\"Jonas began to rise to collect his schoolbooks. He thought it surprising thatthey hadn't talked about his dream at length before the thank you. Perhaps theyfound it as confusing as he had.\"Wait, Jonas,\" Mother said gently. \"I'll write an apology to your instructor sothat you won't have to speak one for being late.\"He sank back down into his chair, puzzled. He waved to Father and Lily as theyleft the dwelling, carrying Gabe in his basket. He watched while Mother tidiedthe remains of the morning meal and placed the tray by the front door for theCollection Crew.Finally she sat down beside him at the table. \"Jonas,\" she said with a smile,\"the feeling you described as the wanting? It was your first Stirrings. Fatherand I have been expecting it to happen to you. It happens to everyone. Ithappened to Father when he was your age. And it happened to me. It will happensomeday to Lily.\"And very often,\" Mother added, \"it begins with a dream.\"Stirrings. He had heard the word before. He remembered that there was areference to the Stirrings in the Book of Rules, though he didn't remember whatit said. And now and then the Speaker mentioned it. ATTENTION. A REMINDER THATSTIRRINGS MUST BE REPORTED IN ORDER FOR TREATMENT TO TAKE PLACE.He had always ignored that announcement because he didn't understand it and ithad never seemed to apply to him in any way. He ignored, as most citizens did,many of the commands and reminders read by the Speaker.\"Do I have to report it?\" he asked his mother.She laughed. \"You did, in the dream-telling. That's enough.\"\"But what about the treatment? The Speaker says that treatment must take place.\"Jonas felt miserable. Just when the Ceremony was about to happen, his Ceremonyof Twelve, would he have to go away someplace for treatment? Just because of astupid dream?But his mother laughed again in a reassuring, affectionate way. \"No, no,\" shesaid. \"It's just the pills. You're ready for the pills, that's all. That's thetreatment for Stirrings.\"Jonas brightened. He knew about the pills. His parents both took them eachmorning. And some of his friends did, he knew. Once he had been heading off toschool with Asher, both of them on their bikes, when Asher's father had calledfrom their dwelling doorway, \"You forgot your pill, Asher!\" Asher had groanedgood-naturedly, turned his bike, and ridden back while Jonas waited.It was the sort of thing one didn't ask a friend about because it might havefallen into that uncomfortable category of \"being different.\" Asher took a pilleach morning; Jonas did not. Always better, less rude, to talk about things thatwere the same.Now he swallowed the small pill that his mother handed him.\"That's all?\" he asked.\"That's all,\" she replied, returning the bottle to the cupboard. \"But youmustn't forget. I'll remind you for the first weeks, but then you must do it onyour own. If you forget, the Stirrings will come back. The dreams of Stirringswill come back. Sometimes the dosage must be adjusted.\"\"Asher takes them,\" Jonas confided.His mother nodded, unsurprised. \"Many of your groupmates probably do. The males,at least. And they all will, soon. Females too.\"\"How long will I have to take them?\"\"Until you enter the House of the Old,\" she explained. \"All of your adult life.But it becomes routine; after a while you won't even pay much attention to it.\"She looked at her watch. \"If you leave right now, you won't even be late forschool. Hurry along.\"And thank you again, Jonas,\" she added, as he went to the door, \"for yourdream.\"Pedaling rapidly down the path, Jonas felt oddly proud to have joined those whotook the pills. For a moment, though, he remembered the dream again. The dreamhad felt pleasurable. Though the feelings were confused, he thought that he hadliked the feelings that his mother had called Stirrings. He remembered that uponwaking, he had wanted to feel the Stirrings again.Then, in the same way that his own dwelling slipped away behind him as herounded a corner on his bicycle, the dream slipped away from his thoughts. Verybriefly, a little guiltily, he tried to grasp it back. But the feelings haddisappeared. The Stirrings were gone."},{"pageContent":"6\"Lily, please hold still,\" Mother said again.Lily, standing in front of her, fidgeted impatiently. \"I can tie them myself,\"she complained. \"I always have.\"\"I know that,\" Mother replied, straightening the hair ribbons on the littlegirl's braids. \"But I also know that they constantly come loose and more oftenthan not, they're dangling down your back by afternoon. Today, at least, we wantthem to be neatly tied and to stay neatly tied.\"\"I don't like hair ribbons. I'm glad I only have to wear them one more year,\"Lily said irritably. \"Next year I get my bicycle, too,\" she added morecheerfully.\"There are good things each year,\" Jonas reminded her. \"This year you get tostart your volunteer hours. And remember last year, when you became a Seven, youwere so happy to get your front-buttoned jacket?\"The little girl nodded and looked down at herself, at the jacket with its row oflarge buttons that designated her as a Seven. Fours, Fives, and Sixes all worejackets that fastened down the back so that they would have to help each otherdress and would learn interdependence.The front-buttoned jacket was the first sign of independence, the first veryvisible symbol of growing up. The bicycle, at Nine, would be the powerful emblemof moving gradually out into the community, away from the protective familyunit.Lily grinned and wriggled away from her mother. \"And this year you get yourAssignment,\" she said to Jonas in an excited voice. \"I hope you get Pilot. Andthat you take me flying!\"\"Sure I will,\" said Jonas. \"And I'll get a special little parachute that justfits you, and I'll take you up to, oh, maybe twenty thousand feet, and open thedoor, and—\"\"Jonas,\" Mother warned.\"I was only joking,\" Jonas groaned. \"I don't want Pilot, anyway. If I get PilotI'll put in an appeal.\"\"Come on,\" Mother said. She gave Lily's ribbons a final tug. \"Jonas? Are youready? Did you take your pill? I want to get a good seat in the Auditorium.\" Sheprodded Lily to the front door and Jonas followed.It was a short ride to the Auditorium, Lily waving to her friends from her seaton the back of Mother's bicycle. Jonas stowed his bicycle beside Mother's andmade his way through the throng to find his group.The entire community attended the Ceremony each year. For the parents, it meanttwo days holiday from work; they sat together in the huge hall. Children satwith their groups until they went, one by one, to the stage.Father, though, would not join Mother in the audience right away. For theearliest ceremony, the Naming, the Nurturers brought the newchildren to thestage. Jonas, from his place in the balcony with the Elevens, searched theAuditorium for a glimpse of Father. It wasn't at all hard to spot the Nurturers'section at the front; coming from it were the wails and howls of the newchildrenwho sat squirming on the Nurturers' laps. At every other public ceremony, theaudience was silent and attentive. But once a year, they all smiled indulgentlyat the commotion from the little ones waiting to receive their names andfamilies.Jonas finally caught his father's eye and waved. Father grinned and waved back,then held up the hand of the newchild on his lap, making it wave, too.It wasn't Gabriel. Gabe was back at the Nurturing Center today, being cared forby the night crew. He had been given an unusual and special reprieve from thecommittee, and granted an additional year of nurturing before his Naming andPlacement. Father had gone before the committee with a plea on behalf ofGabriel, who had not yet gained the weight appropriate to his days of life norbegun to sleep soundly enough at night to be placed with his family unit.Normally such a newchild would be labeled Inadequate and released from thecommunity.Instead, as a result of Father's plea, Gabriel had been labeled Uncertain andgiven the additional year. He would continue to be nurtured at the Center andwould spend his nights with Jonas's family unit. Each family member, includingLily, had been required to sign a pledge that they would not become attached tothis little temporary guest, and that they would relinquish him without protestor appeal when he was assigned to his own family unit at next year's Ceremony.At least, Jonas thought, after Gabriel was placed next year, they would stillsee him often because he would be part of the community. If he were released,they would not see him again. Ever. Those who were released—even asnewchildren—were sent Elsewhere and never returned to the community.Father had not had to release a single newchild this year, so Gabriel would haverepresented a real failure and sadness. Even Jonas, though he didn't hover overthe little one the way Lily and his father did, was glad that Gabe had not beenreleased.The first Ceremony began right on time, and Jonas watched as one after anothereach newchild was given a name and handed by the Nurturers to its new familyunit. For some, it was a first child. But many came to the stage accompanied byanother child beaming with pride to receive a little brother or sister, the wayJonas had when he was about to be a Five.Asher poked Jonas's arm. \"Remember when we got Phillipa?\" he asked in a loudwhisper. Jonas nodded. It had only been last year. Asher's parents had waitedquite a long time before applying for a second child. Maybe, Jonas suspected,they had been so exhausted by Asher's lively foolishness that they had needed alittle time.Two of their group, Fiona and another female named Thea, were missingtemporarily, waiting with their parents to receive newchildren. But it was rarethat there was such an age gap between children in a family unit.When her family's ceremony was completed, Fiona took the seat that had beensaved for her in the row ahead of Asher and Jonas. She turned and whispered tothem, \"He's cute. But I don't like his name very much.\" She made a face andgiggled. Fiona's new brother had been named Bruno. It wasn't a great name, Jonasthought, like—well, like Gabriel, for example. But it was okay.The audience applause, which was enthusiastic at each Naming, rose in anexuberant swell when one parental pair, glowing with pride, took a male newchildand heard him named Caleb.This new Caleb was a replacement child. The couple had lost their first Caleb, acheerful little Four. Loss of a child was very, very rare. The community wasextraordinarily safe, each citizen watchful and protective of all children. Butsomehow the first little Caleb had wandered away unnoticed, and had fallen intothe river. The entire community had performed the Ceremony of Loss together,murmuring the name Caleb throughout an entire day, less and less frequently,softer in volume, as the long and somber day went on, so that the little Fourseemed to fade away gradually from everyone's consciousness.Now, at this special Naming, the community performed the briefMurmur-of-Replacement Ceremony, repeating the name for the first time since theloss: softly and slowly at first, then faster and with greater volume, as thecouple stood on the stage with the newchild sleeping in the mother's arms. Itwas as if the first Caleb were returning.Another newchild was given the name Roberto, and Jonas remembered that Robertothe Old had been released only last week. But there was no Murmur-of-ReplacementCeremony for the new little Roberto. Release was not the same as Loss.He sat politely through the ceremonies of Two and Three and Four, increasinglybored as he was each year. Then a break for midday meal—served outdoors—and backagain to the seats, for the Fives, Sixes, Sevens, and finally, last of the firstday's ceremonies, the Eights.Jonas watched and cheered as Lily marched proudly to the stage, became an Eightand received the identifying jacket that she would wear this year, this one withsmaller buttons and, for the first time, pockets, indicating that she was matureenough now to keep track of her own small belongings. She stood solemnlylistening to the speech of firm instructions on the responsibilities of Eightand doing volunteer hours for the first time. But Jonas could see that Lily,though she seemed attentive, was looking longingly at the row of gleamingbicycles, which would be presented tomorrow morning to the Nines.Next year, Lily-billy, Jonas thought.It was an exhausting day, and even Gabriel, retrieved in his basket from theNurturing Center, slept soundly that night.Finally it was the morning of the Ceremony of Twelve.Now Father sat beside Mother in the audience. Jonas could see them applaudingdutifully as the Nines, one by one, wheeled their new bicycles, each with itsgleaming nametag attached to the back, from the stage. He knew that his parentscringed a little, as he did, when Fritz, who lived in the dwelling next door totheirs, received his bike and almost immediately bumped into the podium with it.Fritz was a very awkward child who had been summoned for chastisement again andagain. His transgressions were small ones, always: shoes on the wrong feet,schoolwork misplaced, failure to study adequately for a quiz. But each sucherror reflected negatively on his parents' guidance and infringed on thecommunity's sense of order and success. Jonas and his family had not beenlooking forward to Fritz's bicycle, which they realized would probably too oftenbe dropped on the front walk instead of wheeled neatly into its port.Finally the Nines were all resettled in their seats, each having wheeled abicycle outside where it would be waiting for its owner at the end of the day.Everyone always chuckled and made small jokes when the Nines rode home for thefirst time. \"Want me to show you how to ride?\" older friends would call. \"I knowyou've never been on a bike before!\" But invariably the grinning Nines, who intechnical violation of the rule had been practicing secretly for weeks, wouldmount and ride off in perfect balance, training wheels never touching theground.Then the Tens. Jonas never found the Ceremony of Ten particularlyinteresting—only time-consuming, as each child's hair was snipped neatly intoits distinguishing cut: females lost their braids at Ten, and males, too,relinquished their long childish hair and took on the more manly short stylewhich exposed their ears.Laborers moved quickly to the stage with brooms and swept away the mounds ofdiscarded hair. Jonas could see the parents of the new Tens stir and murmur, andhe knew that this evening, in many dwellings, they would be snipping andstraightening the hastily done haircuts, trimming them into a neater line.Elevens. It seemed a short time ago that Jonas had undergone the Ceremony ofEleven, but he remembered that it was not one of the more interesting ones. ByEleven, one was only waiting to be Twelve. It was simply a marking of time withno meaningful changes. There was new clothing: different undergarments for thefemales, whose bodies were beginning to change; and longer trousers for themales, with a specially shaped pocket for the small calculator that they woulduse this year in school; but those were simply presented in wrapped packageswithout an accompanying speech.Break for midday meal. Jonas realized he was hungry. He and his groupmatescongregated by the tables in front of the Auditorium and took their packagedfood. Yesterday there had been merriment at lunch, a lot of teasing and energy.But today the group stood anxiously, separate from the other children. Jonaswatched the new Nines gravitate toward their waiting bicycles, each one admiringhis or her nametag. He saw the Tens stroking their new shortened hair, thefemales shaking their heads to feel the unaccustomed lightness without the heavybraids they had worn so long.\"I heard about a guy who was absolutely certain he was going to be assignedEngineer,\" Asher muttered as they ate, \"and instead they gave him SanitationLaborer. He went out the next day, jumped into the river, swam across, andjoined the next community he came to. Nobody ever saw him again.\"Jonas laughed. \"Somebody made that story up, Ash,\" he said. \"My father said heheard that story when he was a Twelve.\"But Asher wasn't reassured. He was eyeing the river where it was visible behindthe Auditorium. \"I can't even swim very well,\" he said. \"My swimming instructorsaid that I don't have the right boyishness or something.\"\"Buoyancy,\" Jonas corrected him.\"Whatever. I don't have it. I sink.\"\"Anyway,\" Jonas pointed out, \"have you ever once known of anyone—I mean reallyknown for sure, Asher, not just heard a story about it—who joined anothercommunity?\"\"No,\" Asher admitted reluctantly. \"But you can. It says so in the rules. If youdon't fit in, you can apply for Elsewhere and be released. My mother says thatonce, about ten years ago, someone applied and was gone the next day.\" Then hechuckled. \"She told me that because I was driving her crazy. She Threatened toapply for Elsewhere.\"\"She was joking.\"\"I know. But it was true, what she said, that someone did that once. She saidthat it was really true. Here today and gone tomorrow. Never seen again. Noteven a Ceremony of Release.\"Jonas shrugged. It didn't worry him. How could someone not fit in? The communitywas so meticulously ordered, the choices so carefully made.Even the Matching of Spouses was given such weighty consideration that sometimesan adult who applied to receive a spouse waited months or even years before aMatch was approved and announced. All of the factors—disposition, energy level,intelligence, and interests—had to correspond and to interact perfectly. Jonas'smother, for example, had higher intelligence than his father; but his father hada calmer disposition. They balanced each other. Their Match, which like allMatches had been monitored by the Committee of Elders for three years beforethey could apply for children, had always been a successful one.Like the Matching of Spouses and the Naming and Placement of newchildren, theAssignments were scrupulously thought through by the Committee of Elders.He was certain that his Assignment, whatever it was to be, and Asher's too,would be the right one for them. He only wished that the midday break wouldconclude, that the audience would reenter the Auditorium, and the suspense wouldend.As if in answer to his unspoken wish, the signal came and the crowd began tomove toward the doors."},{"pageContent":"7Now Jonas's group had taken a new place in the Auditorium, trading with the newElevens, so that they sat in the very front, immediately before the stage.They were arranged by their original numbers, the numbers they had been given atbirth. The numbers were rarely used after the Naming. But each child knew hisnumber, of course. Sometimes parents used them in irritation at a child'smisbehavior, indicating that mischief made one unworthy of a name. Jonas alwayschuckled when he heard a parent, exasperated, call sharply to a whining toddler,\"That's enough, Twenty-three!\"Jonas was Nineteen. He had been the nineteenth newchild born his year. It hadmeant that at his Naming, he had been already standing and bright-eyed, soon towalk and talk. It had given him a slight advantage the first year or two, alittle more maturity than many of his groupmates who had been born in the latermonths of that year. But it evened out, as it always did, by Three.After Three, the children progressed at much the same level, though by theirfirst number one could always tell who was a few months older than others in hisgroup. Technically, Jonas's full number was Eleven-nineteen, since there wereother Nineteens, of course, in each age group. And today, now that the newElevens had been advanced this morning, there were two Eleven-nineteens. At themidday break he had exchanged smiles with the new one, a shy female namedHarriet.But the duplication was only for these few hours. Very soon he would not be anEleven but a Twelve, and age would no longer matter. He would be an adult, likehis parents, though a new one and untrained still.Asher was Four, and sat now in the row ahead of Jonas. He would receive hisAssignment fourth.Fiona, Eighteen, was on his left; on his other side sat Twenty, a male namedPierre whom Jonas didn't like much. Pierre was very serious, not much fun, and aworrier and tattletale, too. \"Have you checked the rules, Jonas?\" Pierre wasalways whispering solemnly. \"I'm not sure that's within the rules.\" Usually itwas some foolish thing that no one cared about—opening his tunic if it was a daywith a breeze; taking a brief try on a friend's bicycle, just to experience thedifferent feel of it.The initial speech at the Ceremony of Twelve was made by the Chief Elder, theleader of the community who was elected every ten years. The speech was much thesame each year: recollection of the time of childhood and the period ofpreparation, the coming responsibilities of adult life, the profound importanceof Assignment, the seriousness of training to come.Then the Chief Elder moved ahead in her speech.\"This is the time,\" she began, looking directly at them, \"when we acknowledgedifferences. You Elevens have spent all your years till now learning to fit in,to standardize your behavior, to curb any impulse that might set you apart fromthe group.\"But today we honor your differences. They have determined your futures.\"She began to describe this year's group and its variety of personalities, thoughshe singled no one out by name. She mentioned that there was one who hadsingular skills at caretaking, another who loved newchildren, one with unusualscientific aptitude, and a fourth for whom physical labor was an obviouspleasure. Jonas shifted in his seat, trying to recognize each reference as oneof his groupmates. The caretaking skills were no doubt those of Fiona, on hisleft; he remembered noticing the tenderness with which she had bathed the Old.Probably the one with scientific aptitude was Benjamin, the male who had devisednew, important equipment for the Rehabilitation Center.He heard nothing that he recognized as himself, Jonas.Finally the Chief Elder paid tribute to the hard work of her committee, whichhad performed the observations so meticulously all year. The Committee of Eldersstood and was acknowledged by applause. Jonas noticed Asher yawn slightly,covering his mouth politely with his hand.Then, at last, the Chief Elder called number One to the stage, and theAssignments began.Each announcement was lengthy, accompanied by a speech directed at the newTwelve. Jonas tried to pay attention as One, smiling happily, received herAssignment as Fish Hatchery Attendant along with words of praise for herchildhood spent doing many volunteer hours there, and her obvious interest inthe important process of providing nourishment for the community.Number One—her name was Madeline—returned, finally, amidst applause, to herseat, wearing the new badge that designated her Fish Hatchery Attendant. Jonaswas certainly glad that that Assignment was taken; he wouldn't have wanted it.But he gave Madeline a smile of congratulation.When Two, a female named Inger, received her Assignment as Birthmother, Jonasremembered that his mother had called it a job without honor. But he thoughtthat the Committee had chosen well. Inger was a nice girl though somewhat lazy,and her body was strong. She would enjoy the three years of being pampered thatwould follow her brief training; she would give birth easily and well; and thetask of Laborer that would follow would use her strength, keep her healthy, andimpose self-discipline. Inger was smiling when she resumed her seat. Birthmotherwas an important job, if lacking in prestige.Jonas noticed that Asher looked nervous. He kept turning his head and glancingback at Jonas until the group leader had to give him a silent chastisement, amotion to sit still and face forward.Three, Isaac, was given an Assignment as Instructor of Sixes, which obviouslypleased him and was well deserved. Now there were three Assignments gone, noneof them ones that Jonas would have liked—not that he could have been aBirthmother, anyway, he realized with amusement. He tried to sort through thelist in his mind, the possible Assignments that remained. But there were so manyhe gave it up; and anyway, now it was Asher's turn. He paid strict attention ashis friend went to the stage and stood self-consciously beside the Chief Elder.\"All of us in the community know and enjoy Asher,\" the Chief Elder began. Ashergrinned and scratched one leg with the other foot. The audience chuckled softly.\"When the committee began to consider Asher's Assignment,\" she went on, \"therewere some possibilities that were immediately discarded. Some that would clearlynot have been right for Asher.\"For example,\" she said, smiling, \"we did not consider for an instantdesignating Asher an Instructor of Threes.\"The audience howled with laughter. Asher laughed, too, looking sheepish butpleased at the special attention. The Instructors of Threes were in charge ofthe acquisition of correct language.\"In fact,\" the Chief Elder continued, chuckling a little herself, \"we even gavea little thought to some retroactive chastisement for the one who had beenAsher's Instructor of Threes so long ago. At the meeting where Asher wasdiscussed, we retold many of the stories that we all remembered from his days oflanguage acquisition.\"Especially,\" she said, chuckling, \"the difference between snack and smack.Remember, Asher?\"Asher nodded ruefully, and the audience laughed aloud. Jonas did, too. Heremembered, though he had been only a Three at the time himself.The punishment used for small children was a regulated system of smacks with thediscipline wand: a thin, flexible weapon that stung painfully when it waswielded. The Childcare specialists were trained very carefully in the disciplinemethods: a quick smack across the hands for a bit of minor misbehavior; threesharper smacks on the bare legs for a second offense.Poor Asher, who always talked too fast and mixed up words, even as a toddler. Asa Three, eager for his juice and crackers at snacktime, he one day said \"smack\"instead of \"snack\" as he stood waiting in line for the morning treat.Jonas remembered it clearly. He could still see little Asher, wiggling withimpatience in the line. He remembered the cheerful voice call out, \"I want mysmack!\"The other Threes, including Jonas, had laughed nervously. \"Snack!\" theycorrected. \"You meant snack, Asher!\" But the mistake had been made. Andprecision of language was one of the most important tasks of small children.Asher had asked for a smack.The discipline wand, in the hand of the Childcare worker, whistled as it camedown across Asher's hands. Asher whimpered, cringed, and corrected himselfinstantly. \"Snack,\" he whispered.But the next morning he had done it again. And again the following week. Hecouldn't seem to stop, though for each lapse the discipline wand came again,escalating to a series of painful lashes that left marks on Asher's legs.Eventually, for a period of time, Asher stopped talking altogether, when he wasa Three.\"For a while,\" the Chief Elder said, relating the story, \"we had a silent Asher!But he learned.\"She turned to him with a smile. \"When he began to talk again, it was withgreater precision. And now his lapses are very few. His corrections andapologies are very prompt. And his good humor is unfailing.\" The audiencemurmured in agreement. Asher's cheerful disposition was well-known throughoutthe community.\"Asher.\" She lifted her voice to make the official announcement. \"We have givenyou the Assignment of Assistant Director of Recreation.\"She clipped on his new badge as he stood beside her, beaming. Then he turned andleft the stage as the audience cheered. When he had taken his seat again, theChief Elder looked down at him and said the words that she had said now fourtimes, and would say to each new Twelve. Somehow she gave it special meaning foreach of them.\"Asher,\" she said, \"thank you for your childhood.\"The Assignments continued, and Jonas watched and listened, relieved now by thewonderful Assignment his best friend had been given. But he was more and moreapprehensive as his own approached. Now the new Twelves in the row ahead had allreceived their badges. They were fingering them as they sat, and Jonas knew thateach one was thinking about the training that lay ahead. For some—one studiousmale had been selected as Doctor, a female as Engineer, and another for Law andJustice—it would be years of hard work and study. Others, like Laborers andBirthmothers, would have a much shorter training period.Eighteen, Fiona, on his left, was called. Jonas knew she must be nervous, butFiona was a calm female. She had been sitting quietly, serenely, throughout theCeremony.Even the applause, though enthusiastic, seemed serene when Fiona was given theimportant Assignment of Caretaker of the Old. It was perfect for such asensitive, gentle girl, and her smile was satisfied and pleased when she tookher seat beside him again.Jonas prepared himself to walk to the stage when the applause ended and theChief Elder picked up the next folder and looked down to the group to callforward the next new Twelve. He was calm now that his turn had come. He took adeep breath and smoothed his hair with his hand.\"Twenty,\" he heard her voice say clearly. \"Pierre.\"She skipped me, Jonas thought, stunned. Had he heard wrong? No. There was asudden hush in the crowd, and he knew that the entire community realized thatthe Chief Elder had moved from Eighteen to Twenty, leaving a gap. On his right,Pierre, with a startled look, rose from his seat and moved to the stage.A mistake. She made a mistake. But Jonas knew, even as he had the thought, thatshe hadn't. The Chief Elder made no mistakes. Not at the Ceremony of Twelve.He felt dizzy, and couldn't focus his attention. He didn't hear what AssignmentPierre received, and was only dimly aware of the applause as the boy returned,wearing his new badge. Then: Twenty-one. Twenty-two.The numbers continued in order. Jonas sat, dazed, as they moved into theThirties and then the Forties, nearing the end. Each time, at each announcement,his heart jumped for a moment, and he thought wild thoughts. Perhaps now shewould call his name. Could he have forgotten his own number? No. He had alwaysbeen Nineteen. He was sitting in the seat marked Nineteen.But she had skipped him. He saw the others in his group glance at him,embarrassed, and then avert their eyes quickly. He saw a worried look on theface of his group leader.He hunched his shoulders and tried to make himself smaller in the seat. Hewanted to disappear, to fade away, not to exist. He didn't dare to turn and findhis parents in the crowd. He couldn't bear to see their faces darkened withshame.Jonas bowed his head and searched through his mind. What had he done wrong?"},{"pageContent":"8The audience was clearly ill at ease. They applauded at the final Assignment;but the applause was piecemeal, no longer a crescendo of united enthusiasm.There were murmurs of confusion.Jonas moved his hands together, clapping, but it was an automatic, meaninglessgesture that he wasn't even aware of. His mind had shut out all of the earlieremotions: the anticipation, excitement, pride, and even the happy kinship withhis friends. Now he felt only humiliation and terror.The Chief Elder waited until the uneasy applause subsided. Then she spoke again.\"I know,\" she said in her vibrant, gracious voice, \"that you are all concerned.That you feel I have made a mistake.\"She smiled. The community, relieved from its discomfort very slightly by herbenign statement, seemed to breathe more easily. It was very silent.Jonas looked up.\"I have caused you anxiety,\" she said. \"I apologize to my community.\" Her voiceflowed over the assembled crowd.\"We accept your apology,\" they all uttered together.\"Jonas,\" she said, looking down at him, \"I apologize to you in particular. Icaused you anguish.\"\"I accept your apology,\" Jonas replied shakily.\"Please come to the stage now.\"Earlier that day, dressing in his own dwelling, he had practiced the kind ofjaunty, self-assured walk that he hoped he could make to the stage when his turncame. All of that was forgotten now. He simply willed himself to stand, to movehis feet that felt weighted and clumsy, to go forward, up the steps and acrossthe platform until he stood at her side.Reassuringly she placed her arm across his tense shoulders.\"Jonas has not been assigned,\" she informed the crowd, and his heart sank.Then she went on. \"Jonas has been selected.\"He blinked. What did that mean? He felt a collective, questioning stir from theaudience. They, too, were puzzled.In a firm, commanding voice she announced, \"Jonas has been selected to be ournext Receiver of Memory.\"Then he heard the gasp—the sudden intake of breath, drawn sharply inastonishment, by each of the seated citizens. He saw their faces; the eyeswidened in awe.And still he did not understand.\"Such a selection is very, very rare,\" the Chief Elder told the audience. \"Ourcommunity has only one Receiver. It is he who trains his successor.\"We have had our current Receiver for a very long time,\" she went on. Jonasfollowed her eyes and saw that she was looking at one of the Elders. TheCommittee of Elders was sitting together in a group; and the Chief Elder's eyeswere now on one who sat in the midst but seemed oddly separate from them. It wasa man Jonas had never noticed before, a bearded man with pale eyes. He waswatching Jonas intently.\"We failed in our last selection,\" the Chief Elder said solemnly. \"It was tenyears ago, when Jonas was just a toddler. I will not dwell on the experiencebecause it causes us all terrible discomfort.\"Jonas didn't know what she was referring to, but he could sense the discomfortof the audience. They shifted uneasily in their seats.\"We have not been hasty this time,\" she continued. \"We could not afford anotherfailure.\"\"Sometimes,\" she went on, speaking now in a lighter tone, relaxing the tensionin the Auditorium, \"we are not entirely certain about the Assignments, evenafter the most painstaking observations. Sometimes we worry that the oneassigned might not develop, through training, every attribute necessary. Elevensare still children, after all. What we observe as playfulness and patience—therequirements to become Nurturer—could, with maturity, be revealed as simplyfoolishness and indolence. So we continue to observe during training, and tomodify behavior when necessary.\"But the Receiver-in-training cannot be observed, cannot be modified. That isstated quite clearly in the rules. He is to be alone, apart, while he isprepared by the current Receiver for the job which is the most honored in ourcommunity.\"Alone? Apart? Jonas listened with increasing unease.\"Therefore the selection must be sound. It must be a unanimous choice of theCommittee. They can have no doubts, however fleeting. If, during the process, anElder reports a dream of uncertainty, that dream has the power to set acandidate aside instantly.\"Jonas was identified as a possible Receiver many years ago. We have observedhim meticulously. There were no dreams of uncertainty.\"He has shown all of the qualities that a Receiver must have.\"With her hand still firmly on his shoulder, the Chief Elder listed thequalities.\"Intelligence.\" she said. \"We are all aware that Jonas has been a top studentthroughout his school days.\"Integrity\" she said next. \"Jonas has, like all of us, committed minortransgressions.\" She smiled at him. \"We expect that. We hoped, also, that hewould present himself promptly for chastisement, and he has always done so.\"Courage,\" she went on. \"Only one of us here today has ever undergone therigorous training required of a Receiver. He, of course, is the most importantmember of the Committee: the current Receiver. It was he who reminded us, againand again, of the courage required.\"Jonas,\" she said, turning to him, but speaking in a voice that the entirecommunity could hear, \"the training required of you involves pain. Physicalpain.\"He felt fear flutter within him.\"You have never experienced that. Yes, you have scraped your knees in falls fromyour bicycle. Yes, you crushed your finger in a door last year.\"Jonas nodded, agreeing, as he recalled the incident, and its accompanyingmisery.\"But you will be faced, now,\" she explained gently, \"with pain of a magnitudethat none of us here can comprehend because it is beyond our experience. TheReceiver himself was not able to describe it, only to remind us that you wouldbe faced with it, that you would need immense courage. We cannot prepare you forthat.\"But we feel certain that you are brave,\" she said to him.He did not feel brave at all. Not now.\"The fourth essential attribute,\" the Chief Elder said, \"is wisdom. Jonas hasnot yet acquired that. The acquisition of wisdom will come through his training.\"We are convinced that Jonas has the ability to acquire wisdom. That is what welooked for.\"Finally, The Receiver must have one more quality, and it is one which I canonly name, but not describe. I do not understand it. You members of thecommunity will not understand it, either. Perhaps Jonas will, because thecurrent Receiver has told us that Jonas already has this quality. He calls itthe Capacity to See Beyond.\"The Chief Elder looked at Jonas with a question in her eyes. The audiencewatched him, too. They were silent.For a moment he froze, consumed with despair. He didn't have it, thewhatever-she-had-said. He didn't know what it was. Now was the moment when hewould have to confess, to say, \"No, I don't. I can't,\" and throw himself ontheir mercy, ask their forgiveness, to explain that he had been wrongly chosen,that he was not the right one at all.But when he looked out across the crowd, the sea of faces, the thing happenedagain. The thing that had happened with the apple.They changed.He blinked, and it was gone. His shoulders straightened slightly. Briefly hefelt a tiny sliver of sureness for the first time.She was still watching him. They all were.\"I think it's true,\" he told the Chief Elder and the community. \"I don'tunderstand it yet. I don't know what it is. But sometimes I see something. Andmaybe it's beyond.\"She took her arm from his shoulders.\"Jonas,\" she said, speaking not to him alone but to the entire community ofwhich he was a part, \"you will be trained to be our next Receiver of Memory. Wethank you for your childhood.\"Then she turned and left the stage, left him there alone, standing and facingthe crowd, which began spontaneously the collective murmur of his name.\"Jonas.\" It was a whisper at first: hushed, barely audible. \"Jonas. Jonas.\"Then louder, faster. \"JONAS. JONAS. JONAS.\"With the chant, Jonas knew, the community was accepting him and his new role,giving him life, the way they had given it to the newchild Caleb. His heartswelled with gratitude and pride.But at the same time he was filled with fear. He did not know what his selectionmeant. He did not know what he was to become.Or what would become of him."},{"pageContent":"9Now, for the first time in his twelve years of life, Jonas felt separate,different. He remembered what the Chief Elder had said: that his training wouldbe alone and apart.But his training had not yet begun and already, upon leaving the Auditorium, hefelt the apartness. Holding the folder she had given him, he made his waythrough the throng, looking for his family unit and for Asher. People movedaside for him. They watched him. He thought he could hear whispers.\"Ash!\" he called, spotting his friend near the rows of bicycles. \"Ride back withme?\"\"Sure.\" Asher smiled, his usual smile, friendly and familiar. But Jonas felt amoment of hesitation from his friend, an uncertainty.\"Congratulations,\" Asher said.\"You too,\" Jonas replied. \"It was really funny, when she told about the smacks.You got more applause than almost anybody else.\"The other new Twelves clustered nearby, placing their folders carefully into thecarrying containers on the backs of the bikes. In each dwelling tonight theywould be studying the instructions for the beginning of their training. Eachnight for years the children had memorized the required lessons for school,often yawning with boredom. Tonight they would all begin eagerly to memorize therules for their adult Assignments.\"Congratulations, Asher!\" someone called. Then that hesitation again. \"You too,Jonas!\"Asher and Jonas responded with congratulations to their groupmates. Jonas sawhis parents watching him from the place where their own bicycles were waiting.Lily had already been strapped into her sear.He waved. They waved back, smiling, but he noticed that Lily was watching himsolemnly, her thumb in her mouth.He rode directly to his dwelling, exchanging only small jokes and unimportantremarks with Asher.\"See you in the morning, Recreation Director!\" he called, dismounting by hisdoor as Asher continued on.\"Right! See you!\" Asher called back. Once again, there was just a moment whenthings weren't quite the same, weren't quite as they had always been through thelong friendship. Perhaps he had imagined it. Things couldn't change, with Asher.The evening meal was quieter than usual. Lily chattered about her plans forvolunteer work; she would begin, she said, at the Nurturing Center, since shewas already an expert at feeding Gabriel.\"I know,\" she added quickly, when her father gave her a warning glance, \"I won'tmention his name. I know I'm not supposed to know his name.\"I can't wait for tomorrow to come,\" she said happily.Jonas sighed uneasily. \"I can,\" he muttered.\"You've been greatly honored,\" his mother said. \"Your father and I are veryproud.\"\"It's the most important job in the community,\" Father said.\"But just the other night, you said that the job of making Assignments was themost important!\"Mother nodded. \"This is different. It's not a job, really. I never thought,never expected—\" She paused. \"There's only one Receiver.\"\"But the Chief Elder said that they had made a selection before, and that itfailed. What was she talking about?\"Both of his parents hesitated. Finally his father described the previousselection. \"It was very much as it was today, Jonas—the same suspense, as oneEleven had been passed over when the Assignments were given. Then theannouncement, when they singled out the one—\"Jonas interrupted. \"What was his name?\"His mother replied, \"Her, not his. It was a female. But we are never to speakthe name, or to use it again for a newchild.\"Jonas was shocked. A name designated Not-to-Be-Spoken indicated the highestdegree of disgrace.\"What happened to her?\" he asked nervously.But his parents looked blank. \"We don't know,\" his father said uncomfortably.\"We never saw her again.\"A silence fell over the room. They looked at each other. Finally his mother,rising from the table, said, \"You've been greatly honored, Jonas. Greatlyhonored.\"Alone in his sleepingroom, prepared for bed, Jonas opened his folder at last.Some of the other Twelves, he had noticed, had been given folders thick withprinted pages. He imagined Benjamin, the scientific male in his group, beginningto read pages of rules and instructions with relish. He pictured Fiona smilingher gentle smile as she bent over the lists of duties and methods that she wouldbe required to learn in the days to come.But his own folder was startlingly close to empty. Inside there was only asingle printed sheet. He read it twice.> JONAS> RECEIVER OF MEMORY> > 1. Go immediately at the end of school hours each day to the Annex entrance> behind the House of the Old and present yourself to the attendant.> > 2. Go immediately to your dwelling at the conclusion of Training Hours each> day.> > 3. From this moment you are exempted from rules governing rudeness. You may> ask any question of any citizen and you will receive answers.> > 4. Do not discuss your training with any other member of the community,> including parents and Elders.> > 5. From this moment you are prohibited from dream-telling.> > 6. Except for illness or injury unrelated to your training, do not apply for> any medication.> > 7. You are not permitted to apply for release.> > 8. You may lie.Jonas was stunned. What would happen to his friendships? His mindless hoursplaying ball, or riding his bike along the river? Those had been happy and vitaltimes for him. Were they to be completely taken from him, now? The simplelogistic instructions—where to go, and when—were expected. Every Twelve had tobe told, of course, where and how and when to report for training. But he was alittle dismayed that his schedule left no time, apparently, for recreation.The exemption from rudeness startled him. Reading it again, however, he realizedthat it didn't compel him to be rude; it simply allowed him the option. He wasquite certain he would never take advantage of it. He was so completely, sothoroughly accustomed to courtesy within the community that the thought ofasking another citizen an intimate question, of calling someone's attention toan area of awkwardness, was unnerving.The prohibition of dream-telling, he thought, would not be a real problem. Hedreamed so rarely that the dream-telling did not come easily to him anyway, andhe was glad to be excused from it. He wondered briefly, though, how to deal withit at the morning meal. What if he did dream—should he simply tell his familyunit, as he did so often, anyway, that he hadn't? That would be a lie. Still,the final rule said ... well, he wasn't quite ready to think about the finalrule on the page.The restriction of medication unnerved him. Medication was always available tocitizens, even to children, through their parents. When he had crushed hisfinger in the door, he had quickly, gasping into the speaker, notified hismother; she had hastily requisitioned relief-of-pain medication which hadpromptly been delivered to his dwelling. Almost instantly the excruciating painin his hand had diminished to the throb which was, now, all he could recall ofthe experience.Re-reading rule number 6, he realized that a crushed finger fell into thecategory of \"unrelated to training.\" So if it ever happened again—and he wasquite certain it wouldn't; he had been very careful near heavy doors since theaccident!—he could still receive medication.The pill he took now, each morning, was also unrelated to training. So he wouldcontinue to receive the pill.But he remembered uneasily what the Chief Elder had said about the pain thatwould come with his training. She had called it indescribable.Jonas swallowed hard, trying without success to imagine what such pain might belike, with no medication at all. But it was beyond his comprehension.He felt no reaction to rule number 7 at all. It had never occurred to him thatunder any circumstances, ever, he might apply for release.Finally he steeled himself to read the final rule again. He had been trainedsince earliest childhood, since his earliest learning of language, never to lie.It was an integral part of the learning of precise speech. Once, when he hadbeen a Four, he had said, just prior to the midday meal at school, \"I'mstarving.\"Immediately he had been taken aside for a brief private lesson in languageprecision. He was not starving, it was pointed out. He was hungry. No one in thecommunity was starving, had ever been starving, would ever be starving. To say\"starving\" was to speak a lie. An unintentioned lie, of course. But the reasonfor precision of language was to ensure that unintentional lies were neveruttered. Did he understand that? they asked him. And he had.He had never, within his memory, been tempted to lie. Asher did not lie. Lilydid not lie. His parents did not lie. No one did. Unless...Now Jonas had a thought that he had never had before. This new thought wasfrightening. What if others—adults—had, upon becoming Twelves, received in theirinstructions the same terrifying sentence?What if they had all been instructed: You may lie?His mind reeled. Now, empowered to ask questions of utmost rudeness—and promisedanswers—he could, conceivably (though it was almost unimaginable), ask someone,some adult, his father perhaps: \"Do you lie?\"But he would have no way of knowing if the answer he received were true."},{"pageContent":"10\"I go in here, Jonas,\" Fiona told him when they reached the front door of theHouse of the Old after parking their bicycles in the designated area.\"I don't know why I'm nervous,\" she confessed. \"I've been here so often before.\"She turned her folder over in her hands.\"Well, everything's different now,\" Jonas reminded her.\"Even the nameplates on our bikes,\" Fiona laughed. During the night thenameplate of each new Twelve had been removed by the Maintenance Crew andreplaced with the style that indicated citizen-in-training.\"I don't want to be late,\" she said hastily, and started up the steps. \"If wefinish at the same time, I'll ride home with you.\"Jonas nodded, waved to her, and headed around the building toward the Annex, asmall wing attached to the back. He certainly didn't want to be late for hisfirst day of training, either.The Annex was very ordinary, its door unremarkable. He reached for the heavyhandle, then noticed a buzzer on the wall. So he buzzed instead.\"Yes?\" The voice came through a small speaker above the buzzer.\"It's, uh, Jonas. I'm the new—I mean—\"\"Come in.\" A click indicated that the door had been unlatched.The lobby was very small and contained only a desk at which a female Attendantsat working on some papers. She looked up when he entered; then, to hissurprise, she stood. It was a small thing, the standing; but no one had everstood automatically to acknowledge Jonas's presence before.\"Welcome, Receiver of Memory,\" she said respectfully.\"Oh, please,\" he replied uncomfortably. \"Call me Jonas.\"She smiled, pushed a button, and he heard a click that unlocked the door to herleft. \"You may go right on in,\" she told him.Then she seemed to notice his discomfort and to realize its origin. No doors inthe community were locked, ever. None that Jonas knew of, anyway.\"The locks are simply to insure The Receiver's privacy because he needsconcentration,\" she explained. \"It would be difficult if citizens wandered in,looking for the Department of Bicycle Repair, or something.\"Jonas laughed, relaxing a little. The woman seemed very friendly, and it wastrue—in fact it was a joke throughout the community—that the Department ofBicycle Repair, an unimportant little office, was relocated so often that no oneever knew where it was.\"There is nothing dangerous here,\" she told him.\"But,\" she added, glancing at the wall clock, \"he doesn't like to be keptwaiting.\"Jonas hurried through the door and found himself in a comfortably furnishedliving area. It was not unlike his own family unit's dwelling. Furniture wasstandard throughout the community: practical, sturdy, the function of each piececlearly defined. A bed for sleeping. A table for eating. A desk for studying.All of those things were in this spacious room, though each was slightlydifferent from those in his own dwelling. The fabrics on the upholstered chairsand sofa were slightly thicker and more luxurious; the table legs were notstraight like those at home, but slender and curved, with a small carveddecoration at the foot. The bed, in an alcove at the far end of the room, wasdraped with a splendid cloth embroidered over its entire surface with intricatedesigns.But the most conspicuous difference was the books. In his own dwelling, therewere the necessary reference volumes that each household contained: adictionary, and the thick community volume which contained descriptions of everyoffice, factory, building, and committee. And the Book of Rules, of course.The books in his own dwelling were the only books that Jonas had ever seen. Hehad never known that other books existed.But this room's walls were completely covered by bookcases, filled, whichreached to the ceiling. There must have been hundreds—perhaps thousands—ofbooks, their titles embossed in shiny letters.Jonas stared at them. He couldn't imagine what the thousands of pages contained.Could there be rules beyond the rules that governed the community? Could therebe more descriptions of offices and factories and committees?He had only a second to look around because he was aware that the man sitting ina chair beside the table was watching him. Hastily he moved forward, stoodbefore the man, bowed slightly, and said, \"I'm Jonas.\"\"I know. Welcome, Receiver of Memory.\"Jonas recognized the man. He was the Elder who had seemed separate from theothers at the Ceremony, though he was dressed in the same special clothing thatonly Elders wore.Jonas looked self-consciously into the pale eyes that mirrored his own.\"Sir, I apologize for my lack of understanding....\"He waited, but the man did not give the standard accepting-of-apology response.After a moment, Jonas went on, \"But I thought—I mean I think,\" he corrected,reminding himself that if precision of language were ever to be important, itwas certainly important now, in the presence of this man, \"that you are thereceiver of Memory. I'm only, well, I was only assigned, I mean selected,yesterday. I'm not anything at all. Not yet.\"The man looked at him thoughtfully, silently. It was a look that combinedinterest, curiosity, concern, and perhaps a little sympathy as well.Finally he spoke. \"Beginning today, this moment, at least to me, you are TheReceiver.\"I have been The Receiver for a long time. A very, very long time. You can seethat, can't you?\"Jonas nodded. The man was wrinkled, and his eyes, though piercing in theirunusual lightness, seemed tired. The flesh around them was darkened intoshadowed circles.\"I can see that you are very old,\" Jonas responded with respect. The Old werealways given the highest respect.The man smiled. He touched the sagging flesh on his own face with amusement. \"Iam not, actually, as old as I look,\" he told Jonas. \"This job has aged me. Iknow I look as if I should be scheduled for release very soon. But actually Ihave a good deal of time left.\"I was pleased, though, when you were selected. It took them a long time. Thefailure of the previous selection was ten years ago, and my energy is startingto diminish. I need what strength I have remaining for your training. We havehard and painful work to do, you and I.\"Please sit down,\" he said, and gestured toward the nearby chair. Jonas loweredhimself onto the soft cushioned seat.The man closed his eyes and continued speaking. \"When I became a Twelve, I wasselected, as you were. I was frightened, as I'm sure you are.\" He opened hiseyes for a moment and peered at Jonas, who nodded.The eyes closed again. \"I came to this very room to begin my training. It wassuch a long time ago.\"The previous Receiver seemed just as old to me as I do to you. He was just astired as I am today.\"He sat forward suddenly, opened his eyes, and said, \"You may ask questions. Ihave so little experience in describing this process. It is forbidden to talk ofit.\"\"I know, sir. I have read the instructions,\" Jonas said.\"So I may neglect to make things as clear as I should.\" The man chuckled. \"Myjob is important and has enormous honor. But that does not mean I am perfect,and when I tried before to train a successor, I failed. Please ask any questionsthat will help you.\"In his mind, Jonas had questions. A thousand. A million questions. As manyquestions as there were books lining the walls. But he did not ask one, not yet.The man sighed, seeming to put his thoughts in order. Then he spoke again.\"Simply stated,\" he said, \"although it's not really simple at all, my job is totransmit to you all the memories I have within me. Memories of the past.\"\"Sir,\" Jonas said tentatively, \"I would be very interested to hear the story ofyour life, and to listen to your memories.\"I apologize for interrupting,\" he added quickly.The man waved his hand impatiently. \"No apologies in this room. We haven'ttime.\"\"Well,\" Jonas went on, uncomfortably aware that he might be interrupting again,\"I am really interested, I don't mean that I'm not. But I don't exactlyunderstand why it's so important. I could do some adult job in the community,and in my recreation time I could come and listen to the stories from yourchildhood. I'd like that. Actually,\" he added, \"I've done that already, in theHouse of the Old. The Old like to tell about their childhoods, and it's alwaysfun to listen.\"The man shook his head. \"No, no,\" he said. \"I'm not being clear. It's not mypast, not my childhood that I must transmit to you.\"He leaned back, resting his head against the back of the upholstered chair.\"It's the memories of the whole world,\" he said with a sigh. \"Before you, beforeme, before the previous Receiver, and generations before him.\"Jonas frowned. \"The whole world?\" he asked. \"I don't understand. Do you mean notjust us? Not just the community? Do you mean Elsewhere, too?\" He tried, in hismind, to grasp the concept. \"I'm sorry, sir. I don't understand exactly. MaybeI'm not smart enough. I don't know what you mean when you say 'the whole world'or 'generations before him.' I thought there was only us. I thought there wasonly now.\"\"There's much more. There's all that goes beyond—all that is Elsewhere—and allthat goes back, and back, and back. I received all of those, when I wasselected. And here in this room, all alone, I re-experience them again andagain. It is how wisdom comes. And how we shape our future.\"He rested for a moment, breathing deeply. \"I am so weighted with them,\" he said.Jonas felt a terrible concern for the man, suddenly.\"It's as if...\" The man paused, seeming to search his mind for the right wordsof description. \"It's like going downhill through deep snow on a sled,\" he said,finally. \"At first it's exhilarating: the speed; the sharp, clear air; but thenthe snow accumulates, builds up on the runners, and you slow, you have to pushhard to keep going, and—\"He shook his head suddenly, and peered at Jonas. \"That meant nothing to you, didit?\" he asked.Jonas was confused. \"I didn't understand it, sir.\"\"Of course you didn't. You don't know what snow is, do you?\"Jonas shook his head.\"Or a sled? Runners?\"\"No, sir,\" Jonas said.\"Downhill? The term means nothing to you?\"\"Nothing, sir.\"\"Well, it's a place to start. I'd been wondering how to begin. Move to the bed,and lie face down. Remove your tunic first.\"Jonas did so, a little apprehensively. Beneath his bare chest, he felt the softfolds of the magnificent cloth that covered the bed. He watched as the man roseand moved first to the wall where the speaker was. It was the same sort ofspeaker that occupied a place in every dwelling, but one thing about it wasdifferent. This one had a switch, which the man deftly snapped to the end thatsaid OFF.Jonas almost gasped aloud. To have the power to turn the speaker off! It was anastonishing thing.Then the man moved with surprising quickness to the corner where the bed was. Hesat on a chair beside Jonas, who was motionless, waiting for what would happennext.\"Close your eyes. Relax. This will not be painful.\"Jonas remembered that he was allowed, that he had even been encouraged, to askquestions. \"What are you going to do, sir?\" he asked, hoping that his voicedidn't betray his nervousness.\"I am going to transmit the memory of snow,\" the old man said, and placed hishands on Jonas's bare back."},{"pageContent":"11Jonas felt nothing unusual at first. He felt only the light touch of the oldman's hands on his back.He tried to relax, to breathe evenly. The room was absolutely silent, and for amoment Jonas feared that he might disgrace himself now, on the first day of histraining, by falling asleep.Then he shivered. He realized that the touch of the hands felt, suddenly, cold.At the same instant, breathing in, he felt the air change, and his very breathwas cold. He licked his lips, and in doing so, his tongue touched the suddenlychilled air.It was very startling; but he was not at all frightened, now. He was filled withenergy, and he breathed again, feeling the sharp intake of frigid air. Now, too,he could feel cold air swirling around his entire body. He felt it blow againsthis hands where they lay at his sides, and over his back.The touch of the man's hands seemed to have disappeared.Now he became aware of an entirely new sensation: pinpricks? No, because theywere soft and without pain. Tiny, cold, featherlike feelings peppered his bodyand face. He put out his tongue again, and caught one of the dots of cold uponit. It disappeared from his awareness instantly; but he caught another, andanother. The sensation made him smile.One part of his consciousness knew that he was still lying there, on the bed, inthe Annex room. Yet another, separate part of his being was upright now, in asitting position, and beneath him he could feel that he was not on the softdecorated bedcovering at all, but rather seated on a flat, hard surface. Hishands now held (though at the same time they were still motionless at his sides)a rough, damp rope.And he could see, though his eyes were closed. He could see a bright, whirlingtorrent of crystals in the air around him, and he could see them gather on thebacks of his hands, like cold fur.His breath was visible.Beyond, through the swirl of what he now, somehow, perceived was the thing theold man had spoken of—snow—he could look out and down a great distance. He wasup high someplace. The ground was thick with the furry snow, but he sat slightlyabove it on a hard, flat object.Sled, he knew abruptly. He was sitting on a thing called sled. And the sleditself seemed to be poised at the top of a long, extended mound that rose fromthe very land where he was. Even as he thought the word \"mound,\" his newconsciousness told him hill.Then the sled, with Jonas himself upon it, began to move through the snowfall,and he understood instantly that now he was going downhill. No voice made anexplanation. The experience explained itself to him.His face cut through the frigid air as he began the descent, moving through thesubstance called snow on the vehicle called sled, which propelled itself on whathe now knew without doubt to be runners.Comprehending all of those things as he sped downward, he was free to enjoy thebreathless glee that overwhelmed him: the speed, the clear cold air, the totalsilence, the feeling of balance and excitement and peace.Then, as the angle of incline lessened, as the mound—the hill—flattened, nearingthe bottom, the sled's forward motion slowed. The snow was piled now around it,and he pushed with his body, moving it forward, not wanting the exhilaratingride to end.Finally the obstruction of the piled snow was too much for the thin runners ofthe sled, and he came to a stop. He sat there for a moment, panting, holding therope in his cold hands. Tentatively he opened his eyes—not his snow-hill-sledeyes, for they had been open throughout the strange ride. He opened his ordinaryeyes, and saw that he was still on the bed, that he had not moved at all.The old man, still beside the bed, was watching him. \"How do you feel?\" heasked.Jonas sat up and tried to answer honestly. \"Surprised,\" he said, after a moment.The old man wiped his forehead with his sleeve. \"Whew,\" he said. \"It wasexhausting. But you know, even transmitting that tiny memory to you—I think itlightened me just a little.\"\"Do you mean—you did say I could ask questions?\"The man nodded, encouraging his question.\"Do you mean that now you don't have the memory of it—of that ride on thesled—anymore?\"\"That's right. A little weight off this old body.\"\"But it was such fun! And now you don't have it anymore! I took it from you!\"But the old man laughed. \"All I gave you was one ride, on one sled, in one snow,on one hill. I have a whole world of them in my memory. I could give them to youone by one, a thousand times, and there would still be more.\"\"Are you saying that I—I mean we—could do it again?\" Jonas asked. \"I'd reallylike to. I think I could steer, by pulling the rope. I didn't try this time,because it was so new.\"The old man, laughing, shook his head. \"Maybe another day, for a treat. Butthere's no time, really, just to play. I only wanted to begin by showing you howit works.\"Now,\" he said, turning businesslike, \"lie back down. I want to—\"Jonas did. He was eager for whatever experience would come next. But he had,suddenly, so many questions.\"Why don't we have snow, and sleds, and hills?\" he asked. \"And when did we, inthe past? Did my parents have sleds when they were young? Did you?\"The old man shrugged and gave a short laugh. \"No,\" he told Jonas. \"It's a verydistant memory. That's why it was so exhausting—I had to tug it forward frommany generations back. It was given to me when I was a new Receiver, and theprevious Receiver had to pull it through a long time period, too.\"\"But what happened to those things? Snow, and the rest of it?\"\"Climate Control. Snow made growing food difficult, limited the agriculturalperiods. And unpredictable weather made transportation almost impossible attimes. It wasn't a practical thing, so it became obsolete when we went toSameness.\"And hills, too,\" he added. \"They made conveyance of goods unwieldy. Trucks;buses. Slowed them down. So—\" He waved his hand, as if a gesture had causedhills to disappear. \"Sameness,\" he concluded.Jonas frowned. \"I wish we had those things, still. Just now and then.\"'The old man smiled. \"So do I,\" he said. \"But that choice is not ours.\"\"But sir,\" Jonas suggested, \"since you have so much power—\"The man corrected him. \"Honor,\" he said firmly. \"I have great honor. So willyou. But you will find that that is not the same as power.\"Lie quietly now. Since we've entered into the topic of climate, let me give yousomething else. And this time I'm not going to tell you the name of it, becauseI want to test the receiving. You should be able to perceive the name withoutbeing told. I gave away snow and sled and downhill and runners by telling themto you in advance.\"Without being instructed, Jonas closed his eyes again. He felt the hands on hisback again. He waited.Now it came more quickly, the feelings. This time the hands didn't become cold,but instead began to feel warm on his body. They moistened a little. The warmthspread, extending across his shoulders, up his neck, onto the side of his face.He could feel it through his clothed parts, too: a pleasant, all-over sensation;and when he licked his lips this time, the air was hot and heavy.He didn't move. There was no sled. His posture didn't change. He was simplyalone someplace, out of doors, lying down, and the warmth came from far above.It was not as exciting as the ride through the snowy air; but it was pleasurableand comforting.Suddenly he perceived the word for it: sunshine. He perceived that it came fromthe sky.Then it ended.\"Sunshine,\" he said aloud, opening his eyes.\"Good. You did get the word. That makes my job easier. Not so much explaining.\"\"And it came from the sky.\"\"That's right,\" the old man said. \"Just the way it used to.\"\"Before Sameness. Before Climate Control,\" Jonas added.The man laughed. \"You receive well, and learn quickly. I'm very pleased withyou. That's enough for today, I think. We're off to a good start.\"There was a question bothering Jonas. \"Sir,\" he said, \"The Chief Elder toldme—she told everyone—and you told me, too, that it would be painful. So I was alittle scared. But it didn't hurt at all. I really enjoyed it.\" He lookedquizzically at the old man.The man sighed. \"I started you with memories of pleasure. My previous failuregave me the wisdom to do that.\" He took a few deep breaths. \"Jonas,\" he said,\"it will be painful. But it need not be painful yet.\"\"I'm brave. I really am.\" Jonas sat up a little straighter.The old man looked at him for a moment. He smiled. \"I can see that,\" he said.\"Well, since you asked the question—I think I have enough energy for one moretransmission.\"Lie down once more. This will be the last today.\"Jonas obeyed cheerfully. He closed his eyes, waiting, and felt the hands again;then he felt the warmth again, the sunshine again, coming from the sky of thisother consciousness that was so new to him. This time, as he lay basking in thewonderful warmth, he felt the passage of time. His real self was aware that itwas only a minute or two; but his other, memory-receiving self felt hours passin the sun. His skin began to sting. Restlessly he moved one arm, bending it,and felt a sharp pain in the crease of his inner arm at the elbow.\"Ouch,\" he said loudly, and shifted on the bed. \"Owwww,\" he said, wincing at theshift, and even moving his mouth to speak made his face hurt.He knew there was a word, but the pain kept him from grasping it.Then it ended. He opened his eyes, wincing with discomfort. \"It hurt,\" he toldthe man, \"and I couldn't get the word for it.\"\"It was sunburn,\" the old man told him.\"It hurt a lot,\" Jonas said, \"but I'm glad you gave it to me. It wasinteresting. And now I understand better, what it meant, that there would bepain.\"The man didn't respond. He sat silently for a second. Finally he said, \"Get up,now. It's time for you to go home.\"They both walked to the center of the room. Jonas put his tunic back on.\"Goodbye, sir,\" he said. \"Thank you for my first day.\"The old man nodded to him. He looked drained, and a little sad.\"Sir?\" Jonas said shyly.\"Yes? Do you have a question?\"\"It's just that I don't know your name. I thought you were The Receiver, but yousay that now I'm The Receiver. So I don't know what to call you.\"The man had sat back down in the comfortable upholstered chair. He moved hisshoulders around as if to ease away an aching sensation. He seemed terriblyweary.\"Call me The Giver,\" he told Jonas."},{"pageContent":"12\"You slept soundly, Jonas?\" his mother asked at the morning meal. \"No dreams?\"Jonas simply smiled and nodded, not ready to lie, not willing to tell the truth.\"I slept very soundly,\" he said.\"I wish this one would,\" his father said, leaning down from his chair to touchGabriel's waving fist. The basket was on the floor beside him; in its corner,beside Gabriel's head, the stuffed hippo sat staring with its blank eyes.\"So do I,\" Mother said, rolling her eyes. \"He's so fretful at night.\"Jonas had not heard the newchild during the night because as always, he hadslept soundly. But it was not true that he had no dreams.Again and again, as he slept, he had slid down that snow-covered hill. Always,in the dream, it seemed as if there were a destination: a something—he could notgrasp what—that lay beyond the place where the thickness of snow brought thesled to a stop.He was left, upon awakening, with the feeling that he wanted, even somehowneeded, to reach the something that waited in the distance. The feeling that itwas good. That it was welcoming. That it was significant.But he did not know how to get there.He tried to shed the leftover dream, gathering his schoolwork and preparing forthe day.School seemed a little different today. The classes were the same: language andcommunications; commerce and industry; science and technology; civil proceduresand government. But during the breaks for recreation periods and the middaymeal, the other new Twelves were abuzz with descriptions of their first day oftraining. All of them talked at once, interrupting each other, hastily makingthe required apology for interrupting, then forgetting again in the excitementof describing the new experiences.Jonas listened. He was very aware of his own admonition not to discuss histraining. But it would have been impossible, anyway. There was no way todescribe to his friends what he had experienced there in the Annex room. Howcould you describe a sled without describing a hill and snow; and how could youdescribe a hill and snow to someone who had never felt height or wind or thatfeathery, magical cold?Even trained for years as they all had been in precision of language, what wordscould you use which would give another the experience of sunshine?So it was easy for Jonas to be still and to listen.After school hours he rode again beside Fiona to the House of the Old.\"I looked for you yesterday,\" she told him, \"so we could ride home together.Your bike was still there, and I waited for a little while. But it was gettinglate, so I went on home.\"\"I apologize for making you wait,\" Jonas said.\"I accept your apology,\" she replied automatically.\"I stayed a little longer than I expected,\" Jonas explained.She pedaled forward silently, and he knew that she expected him to tell her why.She expected him to describe his first day of training. But to ask would havefallen into the category of rudeness.\"You've been doing so many volunteer hours with the Old,\" Jonas said, changingthe subject. \"There won't be much that you don't already know.\"\"Oh, there's lots to learn,\" Fiona replied. \"There's administrative work, andthe dietary rules, and punishment for disobedience—did you know that they use adiscipline wand on the Old, the same as for small children? And there'soccupational therapy, and recreational activities, and medications, and—\"They reached the building and braked their bikes.\"I really think I'll like it better than school,\" Fiona confessed.\"Me too,\" Jonas agreed, wheeling his bike into its place.She waited for a second, as if, again, she expected him to go on. Then shelooked at her watch, waved, and hurried toward the entrance.Jonas stood for a moment beside his bike, startled. It had happened again: thething that he thought of now as \"seeing beyond.\" This time it had been Fiona whohad undergone that fleeting indescribable change. As he looked up and toward hergoing through the door, it happened; she changed. Actually, Jonas thought,trying to recreate it in his mind, it wasn't Fiona in her entirety. It seemed tobe just her hair. And just for that flickering instant.He ran through it in his mind. It was clearly beginning to happen more often.First, the apple a few weeks before. The next time had been the faces in theaudience at the Auditorium, just two days ago. Now, today, Fiona's hair.Frowning, Jonas walked toward the Annex. I will ask The Giver, he decided.The old man looked up, smiling, when Jonas entered the room. He was alreadyseated beside the bed, and he seemed more energetic today, slightly renewed, andglad to see Jonas.\"Welcome,\" he said. \"We must get started. You're one minute late.\"\"I apologi—\" Jonas began, and then stopped, flustered, remembering there were tobe no apologies.He removed his tunic and went to the bed. \"I'm one minute late because somethinghappened,\" he explained. \"And I'd like to ask you about it, if you don't mind.\"\"You may ask me anything.\"Jonas tried to sort it out in his mind so that he could explain it clearly. \"Ithink it's what you call seeing-beyond,\" he said.The Giver nodded. \"Describe it,\" he said.Jonas told him about the experience with the apple. Then the moment on thestage, when he had looked out and seen the same phenomenon in the faces of thecrowd.\"Then today, just now, outside, it happened with my friend Fiona. She herselfdidn't change, exactly. But something about her changed for a second. Her hairlooked different; but not in its shape, not in its length. I can't quite—\" Jonaspaused, frustrated by his inability to grasp and describe exactly what hadoccurred.Finally he simply said, \"It changed. I don't know how, or why.\"That's why I was one minute late,\" he concluded, and looked questioningly atThe Giver.To his surprise, the old man asked him a question which seemed unrelated to theseeing-beyond. \"When I gave you the memory yesterday, the first one, the ride onthe sled, did you look around?\"Jonas nodded. \"Yes,\" he said, \"but the stuff—I mean the snow—in the air made ithard to see anything.\"\"Did you look at the sled?\"Jonas thought back. \"No. I only felt it under me. I dreamed of it last night,too. But I don't remember seeing the sled in my dream, either. Just feeling it.\"The Giver seemed to be thinking.\"When I was observing you, before the selection, I perceived that you probablyhad the capacity, and what you describe confirms that. It happened somewhatdifferently to me,\" The Giver told him. \"When I was just your age—about tobecome the new Receiver—I began to experience it, though it took a differentform. With me it was ... well, I won't describe that now; you wouldn'tunderstand it yet.\"But I think I can guess how it's happening with you. Let me just make a littletest, to confirm my guess. Lie down.\"Jonas lay on the bed again with his hands at his sides. He felt comfortable herenow. He closed his eyes and waited for the familiar feel of The Giver's hands onhis back.But it didn't come. Instead, The Giver instructed him, \"Call back the memory ofthe ride on the sled. Just the beginning of it, where you're at the top of thehill, before the slide starts. And this time, look down at the sled.\"Jonas was puzzled. He opened his eyes. \"Excuse me,\" he asked politely, \"butdon't you have to give me the memory?\"\"It's your memory, now, It's not mine to experience any longer. I gave it away.\"\"But how can I call it back?\"\"You can remember last year, or the year that you were a Seven, or a Five, can'tyou?\"\"Of course.\"\"It's much the same. Everyone in the community has one-generation memories likethose. But now you will be able to go back farther. Try. Just concentrate.\"Jonas closed his eyes again. He took a deep breath and sought the sled and thehill and the snow in his consciousness.There they were, with no effort. He was again sitting in that whirling world ofsnowflakes, atop the hill.Jonas grinned with delight, and blew his own steamy breath into view. Then, ashe had been instructed, he looked down. He saw his own hands, furred again withsnow, holding the tope. He saw his legs, and moved them aside for a glimpse ofthe sled beneath.Dumbfounded, he stared at it. This time it was not a fleeting impression. Thistime the sled had—and continued to have, as he blinked, and stared at itagain—that same mysterious quality that the apple had had so briefly. AndFiona's hair. The sled did not change. It simply was—whatever the thing was.Jonas opened his eyes and was still on the bed. The Giver was watching himcuriously.\"Yes,\" Jonas said slowly. \"I saw it, in the sled.\"\"Let me try one more thing. Look over there, to the bookcase. Do you see thevery top row of books, the ones behind the table, on the top shelf?\"Jonas sought them with his eyes. He stared at them, and they changed. But thechange was fleeting. It slipped away the next instant.\"It happened,\" Jonas said. \"It happened to the books, but it went away again.\"\"I'm right, then,\" The Giver said. \"You're beginning to see the color red.\"\"The what?\"The Giver sighed. \"How to explain this? Once, back in the time of the memories,everything had a shape and size, the way things still do, but they also had aquality called color.\"There were a lot of colors, and one of them was called red. That's the one youare starting to see. Your friend Fiona has red hair—quite distinctive, actually;I've noticed it before. When you mentioned Fiona's hair, it was the clue thattold me you were probably beginning to see the color red.\"\"And the faces of people? The ones I saw at the Ceremony?\"The Giver shook his head. \"No, flesh isn't red. But it has red tones in it.There was a time, actually—you'll see this in the memories later—when flesh wasmany different colors. That was before we went to Sameness. Today flesh is allthe same, and what you saw was the red tones. Probably when you saw the facestake on color it wasn't as deep or vibrant as the apple, or your friend's hair.\"The Giver chuckled, suddenly. \"We've never completely mastered Sameness. Isuppose the genetic scientists are still hard at work trying to work the kinksout. Hair like Fiona's must drive them crazy.\"Jonas listened, trying hard to comprehend. \"And the sled?\" he said. \"It had thatsame thing: the color red. But it didn't change, Giver. It just was.\"\"Because it's a memory from the time when color was.\"\"It was so—oh, I wish language were more precise! The red was so beautiful!\"The Giver nodded. \"It is.\"\"Do you see it all the time?\"\"I see all of them. All the colors.\"\"Will I?\"\"Of course. When you receive the memories. You have the capacity to see beyond.You'll gain wisdom, then, along with colors. And lots more.\"Jonas wasn't interested, just then, in wisdom. It was the colors that fascinatedhim. \"Why can't everyone see them? Why did colors disappear?\"The Giver shrugged. \"Our people made that choice, the choice to go to Sameness.Before my time, before the previous time, back and back and back. Werelinquished color when we relinquished sunshine and did away with differences.\"He thought for a moment. \"We gained control of many things. But we had to let goof others.\"\"We shouldn't have!\" Jonas said fiercely.The Giver looked startled at the certainty of Jonas's reaction. Then he smiledwryly. \"You've come very quickly to that conclusion,\" he said. \"It took me manyyears. Maybe your wisdom will come much more quickly than mine.\"He glanced at the wall clock. \"Lie back down, now. We have so much to do.\"\"Giver,\" Jonas asked as he arranged himself again on the bed, \"how did it happento you when you were becoming The Receiver? You said that the seeing-beyondhappened to you, but not the same way.\"The hands came to his back. \"Another day,\" The Giver said gently. \"I'll tell youanother day. Now we must work. And I've thought of a way to help you with theconcept of color.\"Close your eyes and be still, now. I'm going to give you a memory of arainbow.\""},{"pageContent":"13Days went by, and weeks. Jonas learned, through the memories, the names ofcolors; and now he began to see them all, in his ordinary life (though he knewit was ordinary no longer, and would never be again). But they didn't last.There would be a glimpse of green—the landscaped lawn around the Central Plaza;a bush on the riverbank. The bright orange of pumpkins being trucked in from theagricultural fields beyond the community boundary—seen in an instant, the flashof brilliant color, but gone again, returning to their flat and hueless shade.The Giver told him that it would be a very long time before he had the colors tokeep.\"But I want them!\" Jonas said angrily. \"It isn't fair that nothing has color!\"\"Not fair?\" The Giver looked at Jonas curiously. \"Explain what you mean.\"\"Well...\"Jonas had to stop and think it through. \"If everything's the same, thenthere aren't any choices! I want to wake up in the morning and decide things! Ablue tunic, or a red one?\"He looked down at himself, at the colorless fabric of his clothing. \"But it'sall the same, always.\"Then he laughed a little. \"I know it's not important, what you wear. It doesn'tmatter. But—\"\"It's the choosing that's important, isn't it?\" The Giver asked him.Jonas nodded. \"My little brother—\" he began, and then corrected himself. \"No,that's inaccurate. He's not my brother, not really. But this newchild that myfamily takes care of—his name's Gabriel?\"\"Yes, I know about Gabriel.\"\"Well, he's right at the age where he's learning so much. He grabs toys when wehold them in front of him—my father says he's learning small-muscle control. Andhe's really cute.\"The Giver nodded.\"But now that I can see colors, at least sometimes, I was just thinking: what ifwe could hold up things that were bright red, or bright yellow, and he couldchoose? Instead of the Sameness.\"\"He might make wrong choices.\"\"Oh.\" Jonas was silent for a minute. \"Oh, I see what you mean. It wouldn'tmatter for a newchild's toy. But later it does matter, doesn't it? We don't dareto let people make choices of their own.\"\"Not safe?\" The Giver suggested.\"Definitely not safe,\" Jonas said with certainty. \"What if they were allowed tochoose their own mate? And chose wrong?\"Or what if,\" he went on, almost laughing at the absurdity, \"they chose theirown jobs?\"\"Frightening, isn't it?\" The Giver said.Jonas chuckled. \"Very frightening. I can't even imagine it. We really have toprotect people from wrong choices.\"\"It's safer.\"\"Yes,\" Jonas agreed. \"Much safer.\"But when the conversation turned to other things, Jonas was left, still, with afeeling of frustration that he didn't understand.He found that he was often angry, now: irrationally angry at his groupmates,that they were satisfied with their lives which had none of the vibrance his ownwas taking on. And he was angry at himself, that he could not change that forthem.He tried. Without asking permission from The Giver, because he feared—orknew—that it would be denied, he tried to give his new awareness to his friends.\"Asher,\" Jonas said one morning, \"look at those flowers very carefully.\" Theywere standing beside a bed of geraniums planted near the Hall of Open Records.He put his hands on Asher's shoulders, and concentrated on the red of thepetals, trying to hold it as long as he could, and trying at the same time totransmit the awareness of red to his friend.\"What's the matter?\" Asher asked uneasily. \"Is something wrong?\" He moved awayfrom Jonas's hands. It was extremely rude for one citizen to touch anotheroutside of family units.\"No, nothing. I thought for a minute that they were wilting, and we should letthe Gardening Crew know they needed more watering.\" Jonas sighed, and turnedaway.One evening he came home from his training weighted with new knowledge. TheGiver had chosen a startling and disturbing memory that day. Under the touch ofhis hands, Jonas had found himself suddenly in a place that was completelyalien: hot and windswept under a vast blue sky. There were rufts of sparsegrass, a few bushes and rocks, and nearby he could see an area of thickervegetation: broad, low trees outlined against the sky. He could hear noises: thesharp crack of weapons—he perceived the word guns—and then shouts, and animmense crashing thud as something fell, tearing branches from the trees.He heard voices calling to one another. Peering from the place where he stoodhidden behind some shrubbery, he was reminded of what The Giver had told him,that there had been a time when flesh had different colors. Two of these men haddark brown skin; the others were light. Going closer, he watched them hack therusks from a motionless elephant on the ground and haul them away, spatteredwith blood. He felt himself overwhelmed with a new perception of the color heknew as red.Then the men were gone, speeding toward the horizon in a vehicle that spitpebbles from its whirling tires. One hit his forehead and stung him there. Butthe memory continued, though Jonas ached now for it to end.Now he saw another elephant emerge from the place where it had stood hidden inthe trees. Very slowly it walked to the mutilated body and looked down. With itssinuous trunk it stroked the huge corpse; then it reached up, broke some leafybranches with a snap, and draped them over the mass of torn thick flesh.Finally it tilted its massive head, raised its trunk, and roared into the emptylandscape. Jonas had never heard such a sound. It was a sound of rage and griefand it seemed never to end.He could still hear it when he opened his eyes and lay anguished on the bedwhere he received the memories. It continued to roar into his consciousness ashe pedaled slowly home.\"Lily,\" he asked that evening when his sister took her comfort object, thestuffed elephant, from the shelf, \"did you know that once there really wereelephants? Live ones?\"She glanced down at the ragged comfort object and grinned. \"Right,\" she said,skeptically. \"Sure, Jonas.\"Jonas went and sat beside them while his father untied Lily's hair ribbons andcombed her hair. He placed one hand on each of their shoulders. With all of hisbeing he tried to give each of them a piece of the memory: not of the torturedcry of the elephant, but of the being of the elephant, of the towering, immensecreature and the meticulous touch with which it had tended its friend at theend.But his father had continued to comb Lily's long hair, and Lily, impatient, hadfinally wiggled under her brother's touch. \"Jonas,\" she said, \"you're hurting mewith your hand.\"\"I apologize for hurting you, Lily,\" Jonas mumbled, and took his hand away.'Ccept your apology,\" Lily responded indifferently, stroking the lifelesselephant.\"Giver,\" Jonas asked once, as they prepared for the day's work, \"don't you havea spouse? Aren't you allowed to apply for one?\" Although he was exempted fromthe rules against rudeness, he was aware that this was a rude question. But TheGiver had encouraged all of his questions, not seeming to be embarrassed oroffended by even the most personal.The Giver chuckled. \"No, there's no rule against it. And I did have a spouse.You're forgetting how old I am, Jonas. My former spouse lives now with theChildless Adults.\"\"Oh, of course.\" Jonas had forgotten The Giver's obvious age. When adults of thecommunity became older, their lives became different. They were no longer neededto create family units. Jonas's own parents, when he and Lily were grown, wouldgo to live with the Childless Adults.\"You'll be able to apply for a spouse, Jonas, if you want to. I'll warn you,though, that it will be difficult. Your living arrangements will have to bedifferent from those of most family units, because the books are forbidden tocitizens. You and I are the only ones with access to the books.\"Jonas glanced around at the astonishing array of volumes. From time to time,now, he could see their colors. With their hours together, his and The Giver's,consumed by conversation and by the transmission of memories, Jonas had not yetopened any of the books. But he read the titles here and there, and knew thatthey contained all of the knowledge of centuries, and that one day they wouldbelong to him.\"So if I have a spouse, and maybe children, I will have to hide the books fromthem?\"The Giver nodded. \"I wasn't permitted to share the books with my spouse, that'scorrect. And there are other difficulties, too. You remember the rule that saysthe new Receiver can't talk about his training?\"Jonas nodded. Of course he remembered. It had turned out, by far, to be the mostfrustrating of the rules he was required to obey.\"When you become the official Receiver, when we're finished here, you'll begiven a whole new set of rules. Those are the rules that I obey. And it won'tsurprise you that I am forbidden to talk about my work to anyone except the newReceiver. That's you, of course.\"So there will be a whole part of your life which you won't be able to sharewith a family. It's hard, Jonas. It was hard for me.\"You do understand, don't you, that this is my life? The memories?\"Jonas nodded again, but he was puzzled. Didn't life consist of the things youdid each day? There wasn't anything else, really. \"I've seen you taking walks,\"he said.The Giver sighed. \"I walk. I eat at mealtime. And when I am called by theCommittee of Elders, I appear before them, to give them counsel and advice.\"\"Do you advise them often?\" Jonas was a little frightened at the thought thatone day he would be the one to advise the ruling body.But The Giver said no. \"Rarely. Only when they are faced with something thatthey have not experienced before. Then they call upon me to use the memories andadvise them. But it very seldom happens. Sometimes I wish they'd ask for mywisdom more often—there are so many things I could tell them; things I wish theywould change. But they don't want change. Life here is so orderly, sopredictable—so painless. It's what they've chosen.\"\"I don't know why they even need a Receiver, then, if they never call upon him,\"Jonas commented.\"They need me. And you,\" The Giver said, but didn't explain. \"They were remindedof that ten years ago.\"\"What happened ten years ago?\" Jonas asked. \"Oh, I know. You tried to train asuccessor and it failed. Why? Why did that remind them?\"The Giver smiled grimly. \"When the new Receiver failed, the memories that shehad received were released. They didn't come back to me. They went...\"He paused, and seemed to be struggling with the concept. \"I don't know, exactly.They went to the place where memories once existed before Receivers werecreated. Someplace out there—\" He gestured vaguely with his arm. \"And then thepeople had access to them. Apparently that's the way it was, once. Everyone hadaccess to memories.\"It was chaos,\" he said. \"They really suffered for a while. Finally it subsidedas the memories were assimilated. But it certainly made them aware of how theyneed a Receiver to contain all that pain. And knowledge.\"\"But you have to suffer like that all the time,\" Jonas pointed out.The Giver nodded. \"And you will. It's my life. It will be yours.\"Jonas thought about it, about what it would be like for him. \"Along with walkingand eating and—\" He looked around the walls of books. \"Reading? That's it?\"The Giver shook his head. \"Those are simply the things that I do. My life ishere.\"\"In this room?\"The Giver shook his head. He put his hands to his own face, to his chest. \"No.Here, in my being. Where the memories are.\"\"My Instructors in science and technology have taught us about how the brainworks,\" Jonas told him eagerly. \"It's full of electrical impulses. It's like acomputer. If you stimulate one part of the brain with an electrode, it—\" Hestopped talking. He could see an odd look on The Giver's face.\"They know nothing,\" The Giver said bitterly.Jonas was shocked. Since the first day in the Annex room, they had togetherdisregarded the rules about rudeness, and Jonas felt comfortable with that now.But this was different, and far beyond rude. This was a terrible accusation.What if someone had heard?He glanced quickly at the wall speaker, terrified that the Committee might belistening as they could at any time. But, as always during their sessionstogether, the switch had been turned to OFF.\"Nothing?\" Jonas whispered nervously. \"But my instructors—\"The Giver flicked his hand as if brushing something aside. \"Oh, your instructorsare well trained. They know their scientific facts. Everyone is well trained forhis job.\"It's just that ... without the memories it's all meaningless. They gave thatburden to me. And to the previous Receiver. And the one before him.\"\"And back and back and back,\" Jonas said, knowing the phrase that always came.The Giver smiled, though his smile was oddly harsh. \"That's right. And next itwill be you. A great honor.\"\"Yes, sir. They told me that at the Ceremony. The very highest honor.\"Some afternoons The Giver sent him away without training. Jonas knew, on dayswhen he arrived to find The Giver hunched over, rocking his body slightly backand forth, his face pale, that he would be sent away.\"Go,\" The Giver would tell him tensely. \"I'm in pain today. Come back tomorrow.\"On those days, worried and disappointed, Jonas would walk alone beside theriver. The paths were empty of people except for the few Delivery Crews andLandscape Workers here and there. Small children were all at the ChildcareCenter after school, and the older ones busy with volunteer hours or training.By himself, he tested his own developing memory. He watched the landscape forglimpses of the green that he knew was embedded in the shrubbery; when it cameflickering into his consciousness, he focused upon it, keeping it there,darkening it, holding it in his vision as long as possible until his head hurtand he let it fade away.He stared at the flat, colorless sky, bringing blue from it, and rememberedsunshine until finally, for an instant, he could feel warmth.He stood at the foot of the bridge that spanned the river, the bridge thatcitizens were allowed to cross only on official business. Jonas had crossed iton school trips, visiting the outlying communities, and he knew that the landbeyond the bridge was much the same, flat and well ordered, with fields foragriculture. The other communities he had seen on visits were essentially thesame as his own, the only differences were slightly altered styles of dwellings,slightly different schedules in the schools.He wondered what lay in the far distance where he had never gone. The landdidn't end beyond those nearby communities. Were there hills Elsewhere? Werethere vast wind-torn areas like the place he had seen in memory, the place wherethe elephant died?\"Giver,\" he asked one afternoon following a day when he had been sent away,\"what causes you pain?\"When The Giver was silent, Jonas continued. \"The Chief Elder told me, at thebeginning, that the receiving of memory causes terrible pain. And you describedfor me that the failure of the last new Receiver released painful memories tothe community.\"But I haven't suffered, Giver. Not really.\" Jonas smiled. \"Oh, I remember thesunburn you gave me on the very first day. But that wasn't so terrible. What isit that makes you suffer so much? If you gave some of it to me, maybe your painwould be less.\"The Giver nodded. \"Lie down,\" he said. \"It's time, I suppose. I can't shield youforever. You'll have to take it all on eventually.\"Let me think,\" he went on, when Jonas was on the bed, waiting, a littlefearful.\"All right,\" The Giver said after a moment, \"I've decided. We'll start withsomething familiar. Let's go once again to a hill, and a sled.\"He placed his hands on Jonas's back."},{"pageContent":"14It was much the same, this memory, though the hill seemed to be a different one,steeper, and the snow was not falling as thickly as it had before.It was colder, also, Jonas perceived. He could see, as he sat waiting at the topof the hill, that the snow beneath the sled was not thick and soft as it hadbeen before, but hard, and coated with bluish ice.The sled moved forward, and Jonas grinned with delight, looking forward to thebreathtaking slide down through the invigorating air.But the runners, this time, couldn't slice through the frozen expanse as theyhad on the other, snow-cushioned hill. They skittered sideways and the sledgathered speed. Jonas pulled at the rope, trying to steer, but the steepness andspeed took control from his hands and he was no longer enjoying the feeling offreedom but instead, terrified, was at the mercy of the wild accelerationdownward over the ice.Sideways, spinning, the sled hit a bump in the hill and Jonas was jarred looseand thrown violently into the air. He fell with his leg twisted under him, andcould hear the crack of bone. His face scraped along jagged edges of ice andwhen he came, at last, to a stop, he lay shocked and still, feeling nothing atfirst but fear.Then, the first wave of pain. He gasped. It was as if a hatchet lay lodged inhis leg, slicing through each nerve with a hot blade. In his agony he perceivedthe word \"fire\" and felt flames licking at the torn bone and flesh. He tried tomove, and could not. The pain grew.He screamed. There was no answer.Sobbing, he turned his head and vomited onto the frozen snow. Blood dripped fromhis face into the vomit.\"Nooooo!\" he cried, and the sound disappeared into the empty landscape, into thewind.Then, suddenly, he was in the Annex room again, writhing on the bed. His facewas wet with tears.Able to move now, he rocked his own body back and forth, breathing deeply torelease the remembered pain.He sat, and looked at his own leg, where it lay straight on the bed, unbroken.The brutal slice of pain was gone. But the leg ached horribly, still, and hisface felt raw.\"May I have relief-of-pain, please?\" he begged. It was always provided in hiseveryday life for the bruises and wounds, for a mashed finger, a stomach ache, askinned knee from a fall from a bike. There was always a daub of anestheticointment, or a pill; or in severe instances, an injection that brought completeand instantaneous deliverance.But The Giver said no, and looked away.Limping, Jonas walked home, pushing his bicycle, that evening. The sunburn painhad been so small, in comparison, and had not stayed with him. But this achelingered.It was not unendurable, as the pain on the hill had been. Jonas tried to bebrave. He remembered that the Chief Elder had said he was brave.\"Is something wrong, Jonas?\" his father asked at the evening meal. \"You're soquiet tonight. Aren't you feeling well? Would you like some medication?\"But Jonas remembered the rules. No medication for anything related to histraining.And no discussion of his training. At the time for sharing-of-feelings, hesimply said that he felt tired, that his school lessons had been unusuallydemanding that day.He went to his sleepingroom early, and from behind the closed door he could hearhis parents and sister laughing as they gave Gabriel his evening bath.They have never known pain, he thought. The realization made him feeldesperately lonely, and he rubbed his throbbing leg. He eventually slept. Againand again he dreamed of the anguish and the isolation on the forsaken hill.The daily training continued, and now it always included pain. The agony of thefractured leg began to seem no more than a mild discomfort as The Giver ledJonas firmly, little by little, into the deep and terrible suffering of thepast. Each time, in his kindness, The Giver ended the afternoon with acolor-filled memory of pleasure: a brisk sail on a blue-green lake; a meadowdotted with yellow wildflowers; an orange sunset behind mountains.It was not enough to assuage the pain that Jonas was beginning, now, to know.\"Why?\" Jonas asked him after he had received a torturous memory in which he hadbeen neglected and unfed; the hunger had caused excruciating spasms in hisempty, distended stomach. He lay on the bed, aching. \"Why do you and I have tohold these memories?\"\"It gives us wisdom,\" The Giver replied. \"Without wisdom I could not fulfill myfunction of advising the Committee of Elders when they call upon me.\"\"But what wisdom do you get from hunger?\" Jonas groaned. His stomach still hurt,though the memory had ended.\"Some years ago,\" The Giver told him, \"before your birth, a lot of citizenspetitioned the Committee of Elders. They wanted to increase the rate of births.They wanted each Birthmother to be assigned four births instead of three, sothat the population would increase and there would be more Laborers available.\"Jonas nodded, listening. \"That makes sense.\"\"The idea was that certain family units could accommodate an additional child.\"Jonas nodded again. \"Mine could,\" he pointed out. \"We have Gabriel this year,and it's fun, having a third child.\"\"The Committee of Elders sought my advice,\" The Giver said. \"It made sense tothem, too, but it was a new idea, and they came to me for wisdom.\"\"And you used your memories?\"The Giver said yes. \"And the strongest memory that came was hunger. It came frommany generations back. Centuries back. The population had gotten so big thathunger was everywhere. Excruciating hunger and starvation. It was followed bywarfare.\"Warfare? It was a concept Jonas did not know. But hunger was familiar to himnow. Unconsciously he rubbed his own abdomen, recalling the pain of itsunfulfilled needs. \"So you described that to them?\"\"They don't want to hear about pain. They just seek the advice. I simply advisedthem against increasing the population.\"\"But you said that that was before my birth. They hardly ever come to you foradvice. Only when they—what was it you said? When they have a problem they'venever faced before. When did it happen last?\"\"Do you remember the day when the plane flew over the community?\"\"Yes. I was scared.\"\"So were they. They prepared to shoot it down. But they sought my advice. I toldthem to wait.\"\"But how did you know? How did you know the pilot was lost?\"\"I didn't. I used my wisdom, from the memories. I knew that there had been timesin the past—terrible times—when people had destroyed others in haste, in fear,and had brought about their own destruction.\"Jonas realized something. \"That means,\" he said slowly, \"that you have memoriesof destruction. And you have to give them to me, too, because I have to get thewisdom.\"The Giver nodded.\"But it will hurt,\" Jonas said. It wasn't a question.\"It will hurt terribly,\" The Giver agreed.\"But why can't everyone have the memories? I think it would seem a little easierif the memories were shared. You and I wouldn't have to bear so much byourselves, if everybody took a part.\"The Giver sighed. \"You're right,\" he said. \"But then everyone would be burdenedand pained. They don't want that. And that's the real reason The Receiver is sovital to them, and so honored. They selected me—and you—to lift that burden fromthemselves.\"\"When did they decide that?\" Jonas asked angrily. \"It wasn't fair. Let's changeit!\"\"How do you suggest we do that? I've never been able to think of a way, and I'msupposed to be the one with all the wisdom.\"\"But there are two of us now,\" Jonas said eagerly. \"Together we can think ofsomething!\"The Giver watched him with a wry smile.\"Why can't we just apply for a change of rules?\" Jonas suggested.The Giver laughed; then Jonas, too, chuckled reluctantly.\"The decision was made long before my time or yours,\" The Giver said, \"andbefore the previous Receiver, and—\" He waited.\"Back and back and back.\" Jonas repeated the familiar phrase. Sometimes it hadseemed humorous to him. Sometimes it had seemed meaningful and important.Now it was ominous. It meant, he knew, that nothing could be changed.The newchild, Gabriel, was growing, and successfully passed the tests ofmaturity that the Nurturers gave each month; he could sit alone, now, couldreach for and grasp small play objects, and he had six teeth. During the daytimehours, Father reported, he was cheerful and seemed of normal intelligence. Buthe remained fretful at night, whimpering often, needing frequent attention.\"After all this extra time I've put in with him,\" Father said one evening afterGabriel had been bathed and was lying, for the moment, hugging his hippoplacidly in the small crib that had replaced the basket, \"I hope they're notgoing to decide to release him.\"\"Maybe it would be for the best,\" Mother suggested. \"I know you don't mindgetting up with him at night. But the lack of sleep is awfully hard for me.\"\"If they release Gabriel, can we get another newchild as a visitor?\" asked Lily.She was kneeling beside the crib, making funny faces at the little one, who wassmiling back at her.Jonas's mother rolled her eyes in dismay.\"No,\" Father said, smiling. He ruffled Lily's hair. \"It's very rare, anyway,that a newchild's status is as uncertain as Gabriel's. It probably won't happenagain, for a long time.\"Anyway,\" he sighed, \"they won't make the decision for a while. Right now we'reall preparing for a release we'll probably have to make very soon. There's aBirthmother who's expecting twin males next month.\"\"Oh, dear,\" Mother said, shaking her head. \"If they're identical, I hope you'renot the one assigned—\"\"I am. I'm next on the list. I'll have to select the one to be nurtured, and theone to be released. It's usually not hard, though. Usually it's just a matter ofbirthweight. We release the smaller of the two.\"Jonas, listening, thought suddenly about the bridge and how, standing there, hehad wondered what lay Elsewhere. Was there someone there, waiting, who wouldreceive the tiny released twin? Would it grow up Elsewhere, not knowing, ever,that in this community lived a being who looked exactly the same?For a moment he felt a tiny, fluttering hope that he knew was quite foolish. Hehoped that it would be Larissa, waiting. Larissa, the old woman he had bathed.He remembered her sparkling eyes, her soft voice, her low chuckle. Fiona hadtold him recently that Larissa had been released at a wonderful ceremony.But he knew that the Old were not given children to raise. Larissa's lifeElsewhere would be quiet and serene as befit the Old; she would not welcome theresponsibility of nurturing a newchild who needed feeding and care, and wouldlikely cry at night.\"Mother? Father?\" he said, the idea coming to him unexpectedly, \"why don't weput Gabriel's crib in my room tonight? I know how to feed and comfort him, andit would let you and Father get some sleep.\"Father looked doubtful. \"You sleep so soundly, Jonas. What if his restlessnessdidn't wake you?\"It was Lily who answered that. \"If no one goes to tend Gabriel,\" she pointedout, \"he gets very loud. He'd wake all of us, if Jonas slept through it.\"Father laughed. \"You're right, Lily-billy. All right, Jonas, let's try it, justfor tonight. I'll take the night off and we'll let Mother get some sleep, too.\"Gabriel slept soundly for the earliest part of the night. Jonas, in his bed, layawake for a while; from time to time he raised himself on one elbow, lookingover at the crib. The newchild was on his stomach, his arms relaxed beside hishead, his eyes closed, and his breathing regular and undisturbed. Finally Jonasslept too.Then, as the middle hours of the night approached, the noise of Gabe'srestlessness woke Jonas. The newchild was turning under his cover, flailing hisarms, and beginning to whimper.Jonas rose and went to him. Gently he patted Gabriel's back. Sometimes that wasall it took to lull him back to sleep. But the newchild still squirmed fretfullyunder his hand.Still patting rhythmically, Jonas began to remember the wonderful sail that TheGiver had given him not long before: a bright, breezy day on a clear turquoiselake, and above him the white sail of the boat billowing as he moved along inthe brisk wind.He was not aware of giving the memory; but suddenly he realized that it wasbecoming dimmer, that it was sliding through his hand into the being of thenewchild. Gabriel became quiet. Startled, Jonas pulled back what was left of thememory with a burst of will. He removed his hand from the little back and stoodquietly beside the crib.To himself, he called the memory of the sail forward again. It was still there,but the sky was less blue, the gentle motion of the boat slower, the water ofthe lake more murky and clouded. He kept it for a while, soothing his ownnervousness at what had occurred, then let it go and returned to his bed.Once more, toward dawn, the newchild woke and cried out. Again Jonas went tohim. This time he quite deliberately placed his hand firmly on Gabriel's back,and released the rest of the calming day on the lake. Again Gabriel slept.But now Jonas lay awake, thinking. He no longer had any more than a wisp of thememory, and he felt a small lack where it had been. He could ask The Giver foranother sail, he knew. A sail perhaps on ocean, next time, for Jonas had amemory of ocean, now, and knew what it was; he knew that there were sailboatsthere, too, in memories yet to be acquired.He wondered, though, if he should confess to The Giver that he had given amemory away. He was not yet qualified to be a Giver himself; nor had Gabrielbeen selected to be a Receiver.That he had this power frightened him. He decided not to tell."},{"pageContent":"15Jonas entered the Annex room and realized immediately that it was a day when hewould be sent away. The Giver was rigid in his chair, his face in his hands.\"I'll come back tomorrow, sir,\" he said quickly. Then he hesitated. \"Unlessmaybe there's something I can do to help.\"The Giver looked up at him, his face contorted with suffering. \"Please,\" hegasped, \"take some of the pain.\"Jonas helped him to his chair at the side of the bed. Then he quickly removedhis tunic and lay face down. \"Put your hands on me,\" he directed, aware that insuch anguish The Giver might need reminding.The hands came, and the pain came with them and through them. Jonas bracedhimself and entered the memory which was torturing The Giver.He was in a confused, noisy, foul-smelling place. It was daylight, earlymorning, and the air was thick with smoke that hung, yellow and brown, above theground. Around him, everywhere, far across the expanse of what seemed to be afield, lay groaning men. A wild-eyed horse, its bridle torn and dangling,trotted frantically through the mounds of men, tossing its head, whinnying inpanic. It stumbled, finally, then fell, and did not rise.Jonas heard a voice next to him. \"Water,\" the voice said in a parched, croakingwhisper.He turned his head toward the voice and looked into the half-closed eyes of aboy who seemed not much older than himself. Dirt streaked the boy's face and hismatted blond hair. He lay sprawled, his gray uniform glistening with wet, freshblood.The colors of the carnage were grotesquely bright: the crimson wetness on therough and dusty fabric, the ripped shreds of grass, startlingly green, in theboy's yellow hair.The boy stared at him. \"Water,\" he begged again. When he spoke, a new spurt ofblood drenched the coarse cloth across his chest and sleeve.One of Jonas's arms was immobilized with pain, and he could see through his owntorn sleeve something that looked like ragged flesh and splintery bone. He triedhis remaining arm and felt it move. Slowly he reached to his side, felt themetal container there, and removed its cap, stopping the small motion of hishand now and then to wait for the surging pain to ease. Finally, when thecontainer was open, he extended his arm slowly across the blood-soaked earth,inch by inch, and held it to the lips of the boy. Water trickled into theimploring mouth and down the grimy chin.The boy sighed. His head fell back, his lower jaw dropping as if he had beensurprised by something. A dull blankness slid slowly across his eyes. He wassilent.But the noise continued all around: the cries of the wounded men, the criesbegging for water and for Mother and for death. Horses lying on the groundshrieked, raised their heads, and stabbed randomly toward the sky with theirhooves.From the distance, Jonas could hear the thud of cannons. Overwhelmed by pain, helay there in the fearsome stench for hours, listened to the men and animals die,and learned what warfare meant.Finally, when he knew that he could bear it no longer and would welcome deathhimself, he opened his eyes and was once again on the bed.The Giver looked away, as if he could not bear to see what he had done to Jonas.\"Forgive me,\" he said."},{"pageContent":"16Jonas did not want to go back. He didn't want the memories, didn't want thehonor, didn't want the wisdom, didn't want the pain. He wanted his childhoodagain, his scraped knees and ball games. He sat in his dwelling alone, watchingthrough the window, seeing children at play, citizens bicycling home fromuneventful days at work, ordinary lives free of anguish because he had beenselected, as others before him had, to bear their burden.But the choice was not his. He returned each day to the Annex room.The Giver was gentle with him for many days following the terrible shared memoryof war.\"There are so many good memories,\" The Giver reminded Jonas. And it was true. Bynow Jonas had experienced countless bits of happiness, things he had never knownof before.He had seen a birthday party, with one child singled out and celebrated on hisday, so that now he understood the joy of being an individual, special andunique and proud.He had visited museums and seen paintings filled with all the colors he couldnow recognize and name.In one ecstatic memory he had ridden a gleaming brown horse across a field thatsmelled of damp grass, and had dismounted beside a small stream from which bothhe and the horse drank cold, clear water. Now he understood about animals; andin the moment that the horse turned from the stream and nudged Jonas's shoulderaffectionately with its head, he perceived the bonds between animal and human.He had walked through woods, and sat at night beside a campfire. Although he hadthrough the memories learned about the pain of loss and loneliness, now hegained, too, an understanding of solitude and its joy.\"What is your favorite?\" Jonas asked The Giver. \"You don't have to give it awayyet,\" he added quickly. \"Just tell me about it, so I can look forward to it,because I'll have to receive it when your job is done.\"The Giver smiled. \"Lie down,\" he said. \"I'm happy to give it to you.\"Jonas felt the joy of it as soon as the memory began. Sometimes it took a whilefor him to get his bearings, to find his place. But this time he fit right inand felt the happiness that pervaded the memory.He was in a room filled with people, and it was warm, with firelight glowing ona hearth. He could see through a window that outside it was night, and snowing.There were colored lights: red and green and yellow, twinkling from a tree whichwas, oddly, inside the room. On a table, lighted candles stood in a polishedgolden holder and cast a soft, flickering glow. He could smell things cooking,and he heard soft laughter. A golden-haired dog lay sleeping on the floor.On the floor there were packages wrapped in brightly colored paper and tied withgleaming ribbons. As Jonas watched, a small child began to pick up the packagesand pass them around the room: to other children, to adults who were obviouslyparents, and to an older, quiet couple, man and woman, who sat smiling togetheron a couch.While Jonas watched, the people began one by one to untie the ribbons on thepackages, to unwrap the bright papers, open the boxes and reveal toys andclothing and books. There were cries of delight. They hugged one another.The small child went and sat on the lap of the old woman, and she rocked him andrubbed her cheek against his.Jonas opened his eyes and lay contentedly on the bed, still luxuriating in thewarm and comforting memory. It had all been there, all the things he had learnedto treasure.\"What did you perceive?\" The Giver asked.\"Warmth,\" Jonas replied, \"and happiness. And—let me think. Family. That it was acelebration of some sort, a holiday. And something else—I can't quite get theword for it.\"\"It will come to you.\"\"Who were the old people? Why were they there?\" It had puzzled Jonas, seeingthem in the room. The Old of the community did not ever leave their specialplace, the House of the Old, where they were so well cared for and respected.\"They were called Grandparents.\"\"Grand parents?\"\"Grandparents. It meant parents-of-the-parents, long ago.\"\"Back and back and back?\" Jonas began to laugh. \"So actually, there could beparents-of-the-parents-of-the-parents-of-the parents?\"The Giver laughed, too. \"That's right. It's a little like looking at yourselflooking in a mirror looking at yourself looking in a mirror.\"Jonas frowned. \"But my parents must have had parents! I never thought about itbefore. Who are my parents-of-the-parents? Where are they?\"\"You could go look in the Hall of Open Records. You'd find the names. But think,son. If you apply for children, then who will be their parents-of-the-parents?Who will be their grandparents?\"\"My mother and father, of course.\"\"And where will they be?\"Jonas thought. \"Oh,\" he said slowly. \"When I finish my training and become afull adult, I'll be given my own dwelling. And then when Lily does, a few yearslater, she'll get her own dwelling, and maybe a spouse, and children if sheapplies for them, and then Mother and Father—\"\"That's right.\"\"As long as they're still working and contributing to the community, they'll goand live with the other Childless Adults. And they won't be part of my lifeanymore.\"And after that, when the time comes, they'll go to the House of the Old,\" Jonaswent on. He was thinking aloud. \"And they'll be well cared for, and respected,and when they're released, there will be a celebration.\"\"Which you won't attend,\" The Giver pointed out.\"No, of course not, because I won't even know about it. By then I'll be so busywith my own life. And Lily will, too. So our children, if we have them, won'tknow who their parents-of-parents are, either.\"It seems to work pretty well that way, doesn't it? The way we do it in ourcommunity?\" Jonas asked. \"I just didn't realize there was any other way, until Ireceived that memory.\"\"It works,\" The Giver agreed.Jonas hesitated. \"I certainly liked the memory, though. I can see why it's yourfavorite. I couldn't quite get the word for the whole feeling of it, the feelingthat was so strong in the room.\"\"Love,\" The Giver told him.Jonas repeated it. \"Love.\" It was a word and concept new to him.They were both silent for a minute. Then Jonas said, \"Giver?\"\"Yes?\"\"I feel very foolish saying this. Very, very foolish.\"\"No need. Nothing is foolish here. Trust the memories and how they make youfeel.\"\"Well,\" Jonas said, looking at the floor, \"I know you don't have the memoryanymore, because you gave it to me, so maybe you won't understand this—\"\"I will. I am left with a vague wisp of that one; and I have many other memoriesof families, and holidays, and happiness. Of love.\"Jonas blurted out what he was feeling. \"I was thinking that ... well, I can seethat it wasn't a very practical way to live, with the Old right there in thesame place, where maybe they wouldn't be well taken care of, the way they arenow, and that we have a better-arranged way of doing things. But anyway, I wasthinking, I mean feeling, actually, that it was kind of nice, then. And that Iwish we could be that way, and that you could be my grandparent. The family inthe memory seemed a little more—\" He faltered, not able to find the word hewanted.\"A little more complete,\" The Giver suggested.Jonas nodded. \"I liked the feeling of love,\" he confessed. He glanced nervouslyat the speaker on the wall, reassuring himself that no one was listening. \"Iwish we still had that,\" he whispered. \"Of course,\" he added quickly, \"I dounderstand that it wouldn't work very well. And that it's much better to beorganized the way we are now. I can see that it was a dangerous way to live.\"\"What do you mean?\"Jonas hesitated. He wasn't certain, really, what he had meant. He could feelthat there was risk involved, though he wasn't sure how. \"Well,\" he saidfinally, grasping for an explanation, \"they had fire right there in that room.There was a fire burning in the fireplace. And there were candles on a table. Ican certainly see why those things were outlawed.\"Still,\" he said slowly, almost to himself, \"I did like the light they made. Andthe warmth.\"\"Father? Mother?\" Jonas asked tentatively after the evening meal. \"I have aquestion I want to ask you.\"\"What is it, Jonas?\" his father asked.He made himself say the words, though he felt flushed with embarrassment. He hadrehearsed them in his mind all the way home from the Annex.\"Do you love me?\"There was an awkward silence for a moment. Then Father gave a little chuckle.\"Jonas. You, of all people. Precision of language, please!\"\"What do you mean?\" Jonas asked. Amusement was not at all what he hadanticipated.\"Your father means that you used a very generalized word, so meaningless thatit's become almost obsolete,\" his mother explained carefully.Jonas stared at them. Meaningless? He had never before felt anything asmeaningful as the memory.\"And of course our community can't function smoothly if people don't use preciselanguage. You could ask, 'Do you enjoy me?' The answer is 'Yes,'\" his mothersaid.\"Or,\" his father suggested, \"'Do you take pride in my accomplishments?' And theanswer is wholeheartedly 'Yes.'\"\"Do you understand why it's inappropriate to use a word like 'love'?\" Motherasked.Jonas nodded. \"Yes, thank you, I do,\" he replied slowly.It was his first lie to his parents.\"Gabriel?\" Jonas whispered that night to the newchild. The crib was in his roomagain. After Gabe had slept soundly in Jonas's room for four nights, his parentshad pronounced the experiment a success and Jonas a hero. Gabriel was growingrapidly, now crawling and giggling across the room and pulling himself up tostand. He could be upgraded in the Nurturing Center, Father said happily, nowthat he slept; he could be officially named and given to his family in December,which was only two months away.But when he was taken away, he stopped sleeping again, and cried in the night.So he was back in Jonas's sleepingroom. They would give it a little more time,they decided. Since Gabe seemed to like it in Jonas's room, he would sleep thereat night a little longer, until the habit of sound sleep was fully formed. TheNurturers were very optimistic about Gabriel's future.There was no answer to Jonas's whisper. Gabriel was sound asleep.\"Things could change, Gabe,\" Jonas went on. \"Things could be different. I don'tknow how, but there must be some way for things to be different. There could becolors.\"And grandparents,\" he added, staring through the dimness toward the ceiling ofhis sleepingroom. \"And everybody would have the memories.\"You know about memories,\" he whispered, turning toward the crib.Gabriel's breathing was even and deep. Jonas liked having him there, though hefelt guilty about the secret. Each night he gave memories to Gabriel: memoriesof boat rides and picnics in the sun; memories of soft rainfall againstwindowpanes; memories of dancing barefoot on a damp lawn.\"Gabe?\"The newchild stirred slightly in his sleep. Jonas looked over at him.\"There could be love,\" Jonas whispered.The next morning, for the first time, Jonas did not take his pill. Somethingwithin him, something that had grown there through the memories, told him tothrow the pill away."},{"pageContent":"17TODAY IS DECLARED AN UNSCHEDULED HOLIDAY. Jonas, his parents, and Lily allturned in surprise and looked at the wall speaker from which the announcementhad come. It happened so rarely, and was such a treat for the entire communitywhen it did. Adults were exempted from the day's work, children from school andtraining and volunteer hours. The substitute Laborers, who would be given adifferent holiday, took over all the necessary tasks: nurturing, food delivery,and care of the Old; and the community was free.Jonas cheered, and put his homework folder down. He had been about to leave forschool. School was less important to him now; and before much more time passed,his formal schooling would end. But still, for Twelves, though they had beguntheir adult training, there were the endless lists of rules to be memorized andthe newest technology to be mastered.He wished his parents, sister, and Gabe a happy day, and rode down the bicyclepath, looking for Asher.He had not taken the pills, now, for four weeks. The Stirrings had returned, andhe felt a little guilty and embarrassed about the pleasurable dreams that cameto him as he slept. But he knew he couldn't go back to the world of no feelingsthat he had lived in so long.And his new, heightened feelings permeated a greater realm than simply hissleep. Though he knew that his failure to take the pills accounted for some ofit, he thought that the feelings came also from the memories. Now he could seeall of the colors; and he could keep them, too, so that the trees and grass andbushes stayed green in his vision. Gabriel's rosy cheeks stayed pink, even whenhe slept. And apples were always, always red.Now, through the memories, he had seen oceans and mountain lakes and streamsthat gurgled through woods; and now he saw the familiar wide river beside thepath differently. He saw all of the light and color and history it contained andcarried in its slow-moving water; and he knew that there was an Elsewhere fromwhich it came, and an Elsewhere to which it was going.On this unexpected, casual holiday he felt happy, as he always had on holidays;but with a deeper happiness than ever before. Thinking, as he always did, aboutprecision of language, Jonas realized that it was a new depth of feelings thathe was experiencing. Somehow they were not at all the same as the feelings thatevery evening, in every dwelling, every citizen analyzed with endless talk.\"I felt angry because someone broke the play area rules,\" Lily had said once,making a fist with her small hand to indicate her fury. Her family—Jonas amongthem—had talked about the possible reasons for rule-breaking, and the need forunderstanding and patience, until Lily's fist had relaxed and her anger wasgone.But Lily had not felt anger, Jonas realized now. Shallow impatience andexasperation, that was all Lily had felt. He knew that with certainty becausenow he knew what anger was. Now he had, in the memories, experienced injusticeand cruelty, and he had reacted with rage that welled up so passionately insidehim that the thought of discussing it calmly at the evening meal wasunthinkable.\"I felt sad today,\" he had heard his mother say, and they had comforted her.But now Jonas had experienced real sadness. He had felt grief. He knew thatthere was no quick comfort for emotions like those.These were deeper and they did not need to be told. They were felt.Today, he felt happiness.\"Asher!\" He spied his friend's bicycle leaning against a tree at the edge of theplaying field. Nearby, other bikes were strewn about on the ground. On a holidaythe usual rules of order could be disregarded.He skidded to a stop and dropped his own bike beside the others. \"Hey, Ash!\" heshouted, looking around. There seemed to be no one in the play area. \"Where areyou?\"\"Psssheeewwww!\" A child's voice, coming from behind a nearby bush, made thesound. \"Pow! Pow! Pow!\"A female Eleven named Tanya staggered forward from where she had been hiding.Dramatically she clutched her stomach and stumbled about in a zig-zag pattern,groaning. \"You got me!\" she called, and fell to the ground, grinning.\"Blam!\"Jonas, standing on the side of the playing field, recognized Asher's voice. Hesaw his friend, aiming an imaginary weapon in his hand, dart from behind onetree to another. \"Blam! You're in my line of ambush, Jonas! Watch out!\"Jonas stepped back. He moved behind Asher's bike and knelt so that he was out ofsight. It was a game he had often played with the other children, a game of goodguys and bad guys, a harmless pasttime that used up their contained energy andended only when they all lay posed in freakish postures on the ground.He had never recognized it before as a game of war.\"Attack!\" The shout came from behind the small storehouse where play equipmentwas kept. Three children dashed forward, their imaginary weapons in firingposition.From the opposite side of the field came an opposing shout: \"Counter-attack!\"From their hiding places a horde of children—Jonas recognized Fiona in thegroup—emerged, running in a crouched position, firing across the field. Severalof them stopped, grabbed their own shoulders and chests with exaggeratedgestures, and pretended to be hit. They dropped to the ground and laysuppressing giggles.Feelings surged within Jonas. He found himself walking forward into the field.\"You're hit, Jonas!\" Asher yelled from behind the tree. \"Pow! You're hit again!\"Jonas stood alone in the center of the field. Several of the children raisedtheir heads and looked at him uneasily. The attacking armies slowed, emergedfrom their crouched positions, and watched to see what he was doing.In his mind, Jonas saw again the face of the boy who had lain dying on a fieldand had begged him for water. He had a sudden choking feeling, as if it weredifficult to breathe.One of the children raised an imaginary rifle and made an attempt to destroy himwith a firing noise. \"Pssheeew!\" Then they were all silent, standing awkwardly,and the only sound was the sound of Jonas's shuddering breaths. He wasstruggling not to cry.Gradually, when nothing happened, nothing changed, the children looked at eachother nervously and went away. He heard the sounds as they righted theirbicycles and began to ride down the path that led from the field.Only Asher and Fiona remained.\"What's wrong, Jonas? It was only a game,\" Fiona said.\"You ruined it,\" Asher said in an irritated voice.\"Don't play it anymore,\" Jonas pleaded.\"I'm the one who's training for Assistant Recreation Director,\" Asher pointedout angrily. \"Games aren't your area of expertness.\"\"Expertise,\" Jonas corrected him automatically.\"Whatever. You can't say what we play, even if you are going to be the newReceiver.\" Asher looked warily at him. \"I apologize for not paying you therespect you deserve,\" he mumbled.\"Asher,\" Jonas said. He was trying to speak carefully, and with kindness, to sayexactly what he wanted to say. \"You had no way of knowing this. I didn't know itmyself until recently. But it's a cruel game. In the past, there have—\"\"I said I apologize, Jonas.\"Jonas sighed. It was no use. Of course Asher couldn't understand. \"I accept yourapology, Asher,\" he said wearily.\"Do you want to go for a ride along the river, Jonas?\" Fiona asked, biting herlip with nervousness.Jonas looked at her. She was so lovely. For a fleeting instant he thought hewould like nothing better than to ride peacefully along the river path, laughingand talking with his gentle female friend. But he knew that such times had beentaken from him now. He shook his head. After a moment his two friends turned andwent to their bikes. He watched as they rode away.Jonas trudged to the bench beside the Storehouse and sat down, overwhelmed withfeelings of loss. His childhood, his friendships, his carefree sense ofsecurity—all of these things seemed to be slipping away. With his new,heightened feelings, he was overwhelmed by sadness at the way the others hadlaughed and shouted, playing at war. But he knew that they could not understandwhy, without the memories. He felt such love for Asher and for Fiona. But theycould not feel it back, without the memories. And he could not give them those.Jonas knew with certainty that he could change nothing.Back in their dwelling, that evening, Lily chattered merrily about the wonderfulholiday she had had, playing with her friends, having her midday meal out ofdoors, and (she confessed) sneaking a very short try on her father's bicycle.\"I can't wait till I get my very own bicycle next month. Father's is too big forme. I fell,\" she explained matter-offactly. \"Good thing Gabe wasn't in the childseat!\"\"A very good thing,\" Mother agreed, frowning at the idea of it. Gabriel wavedhis arms at the mention of himself. He had begun to walk just the week before.The first steps of a newchild were always the occasion for celebration at theNurturing Center, Father said, but also for the introduction of a disciplinewand. Now Father brought the slender instrument home with him each night, incase Gabriel misbehaved.But he was a happy and easygoing toddler. Now he moved unsteadily across theroom, laughing. \"Gay!\" he chirped. \"Gay!\" It was the way he said his own name.Jonas brightened. It had been a depressing day for him, after such a brightstart. But he set his glum thoughts aside. He thought about starting to teachLily to ride so that she could speed off proudly after her Ceremony of Nine,which would be coming soon. It was hard to believe that it was almost Decemberagain, that almost a year had passed since he had become a Twelve.He smiled as he watched the newchild plant one small foot carefully before theother, grinning with glee at his own steps as he tried them out.\"I want to get to sleep early tonight,\" Father said. \"Tomorrow's a busy day forme. The twins are being born tomorrow, and the test results show that they'reidentical.\"\"One for here, one for Elsewhere,\" Lily chanted. \"One for here, one for Else—\"\"Do you actually take it Elsewhere, Father?\" Jonas asked.\"No, I just have to make the selection. I weigh them, hand the larger over to aNurturer who's standing by, waiting, and then I get the smaller one all cleanedup and comfy. Then I perform a small Ceremony of Release and—\"He glanced down,grinning at Gabriel. \"Then I wave bye-bye,\" he said, in the special sweet voicehe used when he spoke to the newchild. He waved his hand in the familiargesture.Gabriel giggled and waved bye-bye back to him.\"And somebody else comes to get him? Somebody from Elsewhere?\"\"That's right, Jonas-bonus.\"Jonas rolled his eyes in embarrassment that his father had used the silly petname.Lily was deep in thought. \"What if they give the little twin a name Elsewhere, aname like, oh, maybe Jonathan? And here, in our community, at his naming, thetwin that we kept here is given the name Jonathan, and then there would be twochildren with the same name, and they would look exactly the same, and someday,maybe when they were a Six, one group of Sixes would go to visit anothercommunity on a bus, and there in the other community, in the other group ofSixes, would be a Jonathan who was exactly the same as the other Jonathan, andthen maybe they would get mixed up and take the wrong Jonathan home, and maybehis parents wouldn't notice, and then—\"She paused for breath.\"Lily,\" Mother said, \"I have a wonderful idea. Maybe when you become a Twelve,they'll give you the Assignment of Storyteller! I don't think we've had aStoryteller in the community for a long time. But if I were on the Committee, Iwould definitely choose you for that job!\"Lily grinned. \"I have a better idea for one more story,\" she announced. \"What ifactually we were all twins and didn't know it, and so Elsewhere there would beanother Lily, and another Jonas, and another Father, and another Asher, andanother Chief Elder, and another—\"Father groaned. \"Lily,\" he said. \"It's bedtime.\""},{"pageContent":"18\"Giver,\" Jonas asked the next afternoon, \"Do you ever think about release?\"\"Do you mean my own release, or just the general topic of release?\"\"Both, I guess. I apologi—I mean I should have been more precise. But I don'tknow exactly what I meant.\"\"Sit back up. No need to lie down while we're talking.\" Jonas, who had alreadybeen stretched out on the bed when the question came to his mind, sat back up.\"I guess I do think about it occasionally,\" The Giver said. \"I think about myown release when I'm in an awful lot of pain. I wish I could put in a requestfor it, sometimes. But I'm not permitted to do that until the new Receiver istrained.\"\"Me,\" Jonas said in a dejected voice. He was not looking forward to the end ofthe training, when he would become the new Receiver. It was clear to him what aterribly difficult and lonely life it was, despite the honor.\"I can't request release either,\" Jonas pointed out. \"It was in my rules.\"The Giver laughed harshly. \"I know that. They hammered out those rules after thefailure ten years ago.\"Jonas had heard again and again now, reference to the previous failure. But hestill did not know what had happened ten years before. \"Giver,\" he said, \"tellme what happened. Please.\"The Giver shrugged. \"On the surface, it was quite simple. A Receiver-to-be wasselected, the way you were. The selection went smoothly enough. The Ceremony washeld, and the selection was made. The crowd cheered, as they did for you. Thenew Receiver was puzzled and a little frightened, as you were.\"\"My parents told me it was a female.\"The Giver nodded.Jonas thought of his favorite female, Fiona, and shivered. He wouldn't want hisgentle friend to suffer the way he had, taking on the memories. \"What was shelike?\" he asked The Giver.The Giver looked sad, thinking about it. \"She was a remarkable young woman. Veryself-possessed and serene. Intelligent, eager to learn.\" He shook his head anddrew a deep breath. \"You know, Jonas, when she came to me in this room, when shepresented herself to begin her training—\"Jonas interrupted him with a question. \"Can you tell me her name? My parentssaid that it wasn't to be spoken again in the community. But couldn't you say itjust to me?\"The Giver hesitated painfully, as if saying the name aloud might beexcruciating. \"Her name was Rosemary,\" he told Jonas, finally.\"Rosemary. I like that name.\"The Giver went on. \"When she came to me for the first time, she sat there in thechair where you sat on your first day. She was eager and excited and a littlescared. We talked. I tried to explain things as well as I could.\"\"The way you did to me.\"The Giver chuckled ruefully. \"The explanations are difficult. The whole thing isso beyond one's experience. But I tried. And she listened carefully. Her eyeswere very luminous, I remember.\"He looked up suddenly. \"Jonas, I gave you a memory that I told you was myfavorite. I still have a shred of it left. The room, with the family, andgrandparents?\"Jonas nodded. Of course he remembered. \"Yes,\" he said. \"It had that wonderfulfeeling with it. You told me it was love.\"\"You can understand, then, that that's what I felt for Rosemary,\" The Giverexplained. \"I loved her.\"I feel it for you, too,\" he added.\"What happened to her?\" Jonas asked.\"Her training began. She received well, as you do. She was so enthusiastic. Sodelighted to experience new things. I remember her laughter...\"His voice faltered and trailed off.\"What happened?\" Jonas asked again, after a moment. \"Please tell me.\"The Giver closed his eyes. \"It broke my heart, Jonas, to transfer pain to her.But it was my job. It was what I had to do, the way I've had to do it to you.\"The room was silent. Jonas waited. Finally The Giver continued.\"Five weeks. That was all. I gave her happy memories: a ride on amerry-go-round; a kitten to play with; a picnic. Sometimes I chose one justbecause I knew it would make her laugh, and I so treasured the sound of thatlaughter in this room that had always been so silent.\"But she was like you, Jonas. She wanted to experience everything. She knew thatit was her responsibility. And so she asked me for more difficult memories.\"Jonas held his breath for a moment. \"You didn't give her war, did you? Not afterjust five weeks?\"The Giver shook his head and sighed. \"No. And I didn't give her physical pain.But I gave her loneliness. And I gave her loss. I transferred a memory of achild taken from its parents. That was the first one. She appeared stunned atits end.\"Jonas swallowed. Rosemary, and her laughter, had begun to seem real to him, andhe pictured her looking up from the bed of memories, shocked.The Giver continued. \"I backed off, gave her more little delights. Buteverything changed, once she knew about pain. I could see it in her eyes.\"\"She wasn't brave enough?\" Jonas suggested.The Giver didn't respond to the question. \"She insisted that I continue, that Inot spare her. She said it was her duty. And I knew, of course, that she wascorrect.\"I couldn't bring myself to inflict physical pain on her. But I gave her anguishof many kinds. Poverty, and hunger, and terror.\"I had to, Jonas. It was my job. And she had been chosen.\" The Giver looked athim imploringly. Jonas stroked his hand.\"Finally one afternoon, we finished for the day. It had been a hard session. Itried to finish—as I do with you—by transferring something happy and cheerful.But the times of laughter were gone by then. She stood up very silently,frowning, as if she were making a decision. Then she came over to me and put herarms around me. She kissed my cheek.\" As Jonas watched, The Giver stroked hisown cheek, recalling the touch of Rosemary's lips ten years before.\"She left here that day, left this room, and did not go back to her dwelling. Iwas notified by the Speaker that she had gone directly to the Chief Elder andasked to be released.\"\"But it's against the rules! The Receiver-in-training can't apply for rel—\"\"It's in your rules, Jonas. But it wasn't in hers. She asked for release, andthey had to give it to her. I never saw her again.\"So that was the failure, Jonas thought. It was obvious that it saddened TheGiver very deeply. But it didn't seem such a terrible thing, after all. And he,Jonas, would never have done it—never have requested release, no matter nowdifficult his training became. The Giver needed a successor, and he had beenchosen.A thought occurred to Jonas. Rosemary had been released very early in hertraining. What if something happened to him, Jonas? He had a whole year's worthof memories now.\"Giver,\" he asked, \"I can't request release, I know that. But what if somethinghappened: an accident? What if I fell into the river like the little Four,Caleb, did? Well, that doesn't make sense because I'm a good swimmer. But whatif I couldn't swim, and fell into the river and was lost? Then there wouldn't bea new Receiver, but you would already have given away an awful lot of importantmemories, so even though they would select a new Receiver, the memories would begone except for the shreds that you have left of them? And then what if—\"He started to laugh, suddenly. \"I sound like my sister, Lily,\" he said, amusedat himself.The Giver looked at him gravely. \"You just stay away from the river, my friend,\"he said. \"The community lost Rosemary after five weeks and it was a disaster forthem. I don't know what the community would do if they lost you.\"\"Why was it a disaster?\"\"I think I mentioned to you once,\" The Giver reminded him, \"that when she wasgone, the memories came back to the people. If you were to be lost in the river,Jonas, your memories would not be lost with you. Memories are forever.\"Rosemary had only those five weeks worth, and most of them were good ones. Butthere were those few terrible memories, the ones that had overwhelmed her. For awhile they overwhelmed the community. All those feelings! They'd neverexperienced that before.\"I was so devastated by my own grief at her loss, and my own feeling of failure,that I didn't even try to help them through it. I was angry, too.\"The Giver was quiet for a moment, obviously thinking. \"You know,\" he said,finally, \"if they lost you, with all the training you've had now, they'd haveall those memories again themselves.\"Jonas made a face. \"They'd hate that.\"\"They certainly would. They wouldn't know how to deal with it at all.\"\"The only way / deal with it is by having you there to help me,\" Jonas pointedout with a sigh.The Giver nodded. \"I suppose,\" he said slowly, \"that I could—\"\"You could what?\"The Giver was still deep in thought. After a moment, he said, \"If you floatedoff in the river, I suppose I could help the whole community the way I've helpedyou. It's an interesting concept. I need to think about it some more. Maybewe'll talk about it again sometime. But not now.\"I'm glad you're a good swimmer, Jonas. But stay away from the river.\" Helaughed a little, but the laughter was not lighthearted. His thoughts seemed tobe elsewhere, and his eyes were very troubled."},{"pageContent":"19Jonas glanced at the clock. There was so much work to be done, always, that heand The Giver seldom simply sat and talked, the way they just had.\"I'm sorry that I wasted so much time with my questions,\" Jonas said. \"I wasonly asking about release because my father is releasing a newchild today. Atwin. He has to select one and release the other one. They do it by weight.\"Jonas glanced at the clock. \"Actually, I suppose he's already finished. I thinkit was this morning.\"The Giver's face took on a solemn look. \"I wish they wouldn't do that,\" he saidquietly, almost to himself.\"Well, they can't have two identical people around! Think how confusing it wouldbe!\" Jonas chuckled.\"I wish I could watch,\" he added, as an afterthought. He liked the thought ofseeing his father perform the ceremony, and making the little twin clean andcomfy. His father was such a gentle man.\"You can watch,\" The Giver said.\"No,\" Jonas told him. \"They never let children watch. It's very private.\"\"Jonas,\" The Giver told him, \"I know that you read your training instructionsvery carefully. Don't you remember that you are allowed to ask anyone anything?\"Jonas nodded. \"Yes, but—\"\"Jonas, when you and I have finished our time together, you will be the newReceiver. You can read the books; you'll have the memories. You have access toeverything. It's part of your training. If you want to watch a release, you havesimply to ask.\"Jonas shrugged. \"Well, maybe I will, then. But it's too late for this one. I'msure it was this morning.\"The Giver told him, then, something he had not known. \"All private ceremoniesare recorded. They're in the Hall of Closed Records. Do you want to see thismorning's release?\"Jonas hesitated. He was afraid that his father wouldn't like it, if he watchedsomething so private.\"I think you should,\" The Giver told him firmly.\"All right, then,\" Jonas said. \"Tell me how.\"The Giver rose from his chair, went to the speaker on the wall, and clicked theswitch from OFF to ON.The voice spoke immediately. \"Yes, Receiver. How may I help you?\"\"I would like to see this morning's release of the twin.\"\"One moment, Receiver. Thank you for your instructions.\"Jonas watched the video screen above the row of switches. Its blank face beganto flicker with zig-zag lines; then some numbers appeared, followed by the dateand time. He was astonished and delighted that this was available to him, andsurprised that he had not known.Suddenly he could see a small windowless room, empty except for a bed, a tablewith some equipment on it—Jonas recognized a scale; he had seen them before,when he'd been doing volunteer hours at the Nurturing Center— and a cupboard. Hecould see pale carpeting on the floor.\"It's just an ordinary room,\" he commented. \"I thought maybe they'd have it inthe Auditorium, so that everybody could come. All the Old go to Ceremonies ofRelease. But I suppose that when it's just a newborn, they don't—\"\"Shhh,\" The Giver said, his eyes on the screen.Jonas's father, wearing his nurturing uniform, entered the room, cradling a tinynewchild wrapped in a soft blanket in his arms. A uniformed woman followedthrough the door, carrying a second newchild wrapped in a similar blanket.\"That's my father.\" Jonas found himself whispering, as if he might wake thelittle ones if he spoke aloud. \"And the other Nurturer is his assistant. She'sstill in training, but she'll be finished soon.\"The two Nurturers unwrapped the blankets and laid the identical newborns on thebed. They were naked. Jonas could see that they were males.He watched, fascinated, as his father gently lifted one and then the other tothe scale and weighed them.He heard his father laugh. \"Good,\" his father said to the woman. \"I thought fora moment that they might both be exactly the same. Then we'd have a problem. Butthis one,\" he handed one, after rewrapping it, to his assistant, \"is six poundseven. So you can clean him up and dress him and take him over to the Center.\"The woman took the newchild and left through the door she had entered.Jonas watched as his father bent over the squirming newchild on the bed. \"Andyou, little guy, you're only five pounds ten ounces. A shrimp!\"\"That's the special voice he uses with Gabriel,\" Jonas remarked, smiling.\"Watch,\" The Giver said.\"Now he cleans him up and makes him comfy,\" Jonas told him. \"He told me.\"\"Be quiet, Jonas,\" The Giver commanded in a strange voice. \"Watch.\"Obediently Jonas concentrated on the screen, waiting for what would happen next.He was especially curious about the ceremony part.His father turned and opened the cupboard. He rook out a syringe and a smallbottle. Very carefully he inserted the needle into the bottle and began to fillthe syringe with a clear liquid.Jonas winced sympathetically. He had forgotten that newchildren had to getshots. He hated shots himself, though he knew that they were necessary.To his surprise, his father began very carefully to direct the needle into thetop of newchild's forehead, puncturing the place where the fragile skin pulsed.The newborn squirmed, and wailed faintly.\"Why's he—\"\"Shhh,\" The Giver said sharply.His father was talking, and Jonas realized that he was hearing the answer to thequestion he had started to ask. Still in the special voice, his father wassaying, \"I know, I know. It hurts, little guy. But I have to use a vein, and theveins in your arms are still too teeny-weeny.\"He pushed the plunger very slowly, injecting the liquid into the scalp veinuntil the syringe was empty.\"All done. That wasn't so bad, was it?\" Jonas heard his father say cheerfully.He turned aside and dropped the syringe into a waste receptacle.Now he cleans him up and makes him comfy, Jonas said to himself, aware that TheGiver didn't want to talk during the little ceremony.As he continued to watch, the newchild, no longer crying, moved his arms andlegs in a jerking motion. Then he went limp. He head fell to the side, his eyeshalf open. Then he was still.With an odd, shocked feeling, Jonas recognized the gestures and posture andexpression. They were familiar. He had seen them before. But he couldn'tremember where.Jonas stared at the screen, waiting for something to happen. But nothing did.The little twin lay motionless. His father was putting things away. Folding theblanket. Closing the cupboard.Once again, as he had on the playing field, he felt the choking sensation. Onceagain he saw the face of the lighthaired, bloodied soldier as life left hiseyes. The memory came back.He killed it! My father killed it! Jonas said to himself, stunned at what he wasrealizing. He continued to stare at the screen numbly.His father tidied the room. Then he picked up a small carton that lay waiting onthe floor, set it on the bed, and lifted the limp body into it. He placed thelid on tightly.He picked up the carton and carried it to the other side of the room. He openeda small door in the wall; Jonas could see darkness behind the door. It seemed tobe the same sort of chute into which trash was deposited at school.His father loaded the carton containing the body into the chute and gave it ashove.\"Bye-bye, little guy,\" Jonas heard his father say before he left the room. Thenthe screen went blank.The Giver turned to him. Quite calmly, he related, \"When the Speaker notified methat Rosemary had applied for release, they turned on the tape to show me theprocess. There she was—my last glimpse of that beautiful child—waiting. Theybrought in the syringe and asked her to roll up her sleeve.\"You suggested, Jonas, that perhaps she wasn't brave enough? I don't know aboutbravery: what it is, what it means. I do know that I sat here numb with horror.Wretched with helplessness. And I listened as Rosemary told them that she wouldprefer to inject herself.\"Then she did so. I didn't watch. I looked away.\"The Giver turned to him. \"Well, there you are, Jonas. You were wondering aboutrelease,\" he said in a bitter voice.Jonas felt a ripping sensation inside himself, the feeling of terrible painclawing its way forward to emerge in a cry."},{"pageContent":"20\"I won't! I won't go home! You can't make me!\" Jonas sobbed and shouted andpounded the bed with his fists.\"Sit up, Jonas,\" The Giver told him firmly.Jonas obeyed him. Weeping, shuddering, he sat on the edge of the bed. He wouldnot look at The Giver.\"You may stay here tonight. I want to talk to you. But you must be quiet now,while I notify your family unit. No one must hear you cry.\"Jonas looked up wildly. \"No one heard that little twin cry, either! No one butmy father!\" He collapsed in sobs again.The Giver waited silently. Finally Jonas was able to quiet himself and he sathuddled, his shoulders shaking.The Giver went to the wall speaker and clicked the switch to ON.\"Yes, Receiver. How may I help you?\"\"Notify the new Receiver's family unit that he will be staying with me tonight,for additional training.\"\"I will take care of that, sir. Thank you for your instructions,\" the voicesaid.\"I will take care of that, sir. I will take care of that, sir,\" Jonas mimickedin a cruel, sarcastic voice. \"I will do whatever you like, sir. I will killpeople, sir. Old people? Small newborn people? I'd be happy to kill them, sir.Thank you for your instructions, sir. How may I help y—\" He couldn't seem tostop.The Giver grasped his shoulders firmly. Jonas fell silent and stared at him.\"Listen to me, Jonas. They can't help it. They know nothing.\"\"You said that to me once before.\"\"I said it because it's true. It's the way they live. It's the life that wascreated for them. It's the same life that you would have, if you had not beenchosen as my successor.\"\"But he lied to me!\" Jonas wept.\"It's what he was told to do, and he knows nothing else.\"\"What about you? Do you lie to me, too?\" Jonas almost spat the question at TheGiver.\"I am empowered to lie. But I have never lied to you.\"Jonas stared at him. \"Release is always like that? For people who break therules three times? For the Old? Do they kill the Old, too?\"\"Yes, it's true.\"\"And what about Fiona? She loves the Old! She's in training to care for them.Does she know yet? What will she do when she finds out? How will she feel?\"Jonas brushed wetness from his face with the back of one hand.\"Fiona is already being trained in the fine art of release,\" The Giver told him.\"She's very efficient at her work, your red-haired friend. Feelings are not partof the life she's learned.\"Jonas wrapped his arms around himself and rocked his own body back and forth.\"What should I do? I can't go back! I can't!\"The Giver srood up. \"First, I will order our evening meal. Then we will eat.\"Jonas found himself using the nasty, sarcastic voice again. \"Then we'll have asharing of feelings?\"The Giver gave a rueful, anguished, empty laugh. \"Jonas, you and I are the onlyones who have feelings. We've been sharing them now for almost a year.\"\"I'm sorry, Giver,\" Jonas said miserably. \"I don't mean to be so hateful. Not toyou.\"The Giver rubbed Jonas's hunched shoulders. \"And after we eat,\" he went on,\"we'll make a plan.\"Jonas looked up, puzzled. \"A plan for what? There's nothing. There's nothing wecan do. It's always been this way. Before me, before you, before the ones whocame before you. Back and back and back.\" His voice trailed the familiar phrase.\"Jonas,\" The Giver said, after a moment, \"it's true that it has been this wayfor what seems forever. But the memories tell us that it has not always been.People felt things once. You and I have been part of that, so we know. We knowthat they once felt things like pride, and sorrow, and—\"\"And love,\" Jonas added, remembering the family scene that had so affected him.\"And pain.\" He thought again of the soldier.\"The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the loneliness ofit. Memories need to be shared.\"\"I've started to share them with you,\" Jonas said, trying to cheer him.\"That's true. And having you here with me over the past year has made me realizethat things must change. For years I've felt that they should, but it seemed sohopeless.\"Now for the first time I think there might be a way,\" The Giver said slowly.\"And you brought it to my attention, barely—\" He glanced at the clock, \"twohours ago.\"Jonas watched him, and listened.It was late at night, now. They had talked and talked. Jonas sat wrapped in arobe belonging to The Giver, the long robe that only Elders wore.It was possible, what they had planned. Barely possible. If it failed, he wouldvery likely be killed.But what did that matter? If he stayed, his life was no longer worth living.\"Yes,\" he told The Giver. \"I'll do it. I think I can do it. I'll try, anyway.But I want you to come with me.\"The Giver shook his head. \"Jonas,\" he said, \"the community has depended, allthese generations, back and back and back, on a resident Receiver to hold theirmemories for them. I've turned over many of them to you in the past year. And Ican't take them back. There's no way for me to get them back if I have giventhem.\"So if you escape, once you are gone—and, Jonas, you know that you can neverreturn—\"Jonas nodded solemnly. It was the terrifying part. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I know. Butif you come with me—\"The Giver shook his head and made a gesture to silence him. He continued. \"Ifyou get away, if you get beyond, if you get to Elsewhere, it will mean that thecommunity has to bear the burden themselves, of the memories you had beenholding for them.\"I think that they can, and that they will acquire some wisdom. But it will bedesperately hard for them. When we lost Rosemary ten years ago, and her memoriesreturned to the people, they panicked. And those were such few memories,compared to yours. When your memories return, they'll need help. Remember how Ihelped you in the beginning, when the receiving of memories was new to you?\"Jonas nodded. \"It was scary at first. And it hurt a lot.\"\"You needed me then. And now they will.\"\"It's no use. They'll find someone to take my place. They'll choose a newReceiver.\"\"There's no one ready for training, not right away. Oh, they'll speed up theselection, of course. But I can't think of another child who has the rightqualities—\"\"There's a little female with pale eyes. But she's only a Six.\"\"That's correct. I know the one you mean. Her name is Katharine. But she's tooyoung. So they will be forced to bear those memories.\"\"I want you to come, Giver,\" Jonas pleaded.\"No. I have to stay here,\" The Giver said firmly. \"I want to, Jonas. If I gowith you, and together we take away all their protection from the memories,Jonas, the community will be left with no one to help them. They'll be throwninto chaos. They'll destroy themselves. I can't go.\"\"Giver,\" Jonas suggested, \"you and I don't need to care about the rest of them.\"The Giver looked at him with a questioning smile. Jonas hung his head. Of coursethey needed to care. It was the meaning of everything.\"And in any case, Jonas,\" The Giver sighed, \"I wouldn't make it. I'm veryweakened now. Do you know that I no longer see colors?\"Jonas's heart broke. He reached for The Giver's hand.\"You have the colors,\" The Giver told him. \"And you have the courage. I willhelp you to have the strength.\"\"A year ago,\" Jonas reminded him, \"when I had just become a Twelve, when I beganto see the first color, you told me that the beginning had been different foryou. But that I wouldn't understand.\"The Giver brightened. \"That's true. And do you know, Jonas, that with all yourknowledge now, with all your memories, with all you've learned—still you won'tunderstand? Because I've been a little selfish. I haven't given any of it toyou. I wanted to keep it for myself to the last.\"\"Keep what?\"\"When I was just a boy, younger than you, it began to come to me. But it wasn'tthe seeing-beyond for me. It was different. For me, it was hearing-beyond.\"Jonas frowned, trying to figure that out. \"What did you hear?\" he asked.\"Music,\" The Giver said, smiling. \"I began to hear something truly remarkable,and it is called music. I'll give you some before I go.\"Jonas shook his head emphatically. \"No, Giver,\" he said. \"I want you to keepthat, to have with you, when I'm gone.\"***Jonas went home the next morning, cheerfully greeted his parents, and liedeasily about what a busy, pleasant night he had had.His father smiled and lied easily, too, about his busy and pleasant day the daybefore.Throughout the school day, as he did his lessons, Jonas went over the plan inhis head. It seemed startlingly simple. Jonas and The Giver had gone over it andover it, late into the night hours.For the next two weeks, as the time for the December Ceremony approached, TheGiver would transfer every memory of courage and strength that he could toJonas. He would need those to help him find the Elsewhere that they were bothsure existed. They knew it would be a very difficult journey.Then, in the middle of the night before the Ceremony, Jonas would secretly leavehis dwelling. This was probably the most dangerous part, because it was aviolation of a major rule for any citizen not on official business to leave adwelling at night.\"I'll leave at midnight,\" Jonas said. \"The Food Collectors will be finishedpicking up the evening-meal remains by then, and the Path-Maintenance Crewsdon't start their work that early. So there won't be anyone to see me, unless ofcourse someone is out on emergency business.\"\"I don't know what you should do if you are seen, Jonas,\" The Giver had said. \"Ihave memories, of course, of all kinds of escapes. People fleeing from terriblethings throughout history. But every situation is individual. There is no memoryof one like this.\"\"I'll be careful,\" Jonas said. \"No one will see me.\"\"As Receiver-in-training, you're held in very high respect already. So I thinkyou wouldn't be questioned very forcefully.\"\"I'd just say I was on some important errand for the Receiver. I'd say it wasall your fault that I was out after hours,\" Jonas teased.They both laughed a little nervously. But Jonas was certain that he could slipaway, unseen, from his house, carrying an extra set of clothing. Silently hewould take his bicycle to the riverbank and leave it there hidden in bushes withthe clothing folded beside it.Then he would make his way through the darkness, on foot, silently, to theAnnex.\"There's no nighttime attendant,\" The Giver explained. \"I'll leave the doorunlocked. You simply slip into the room. I'll be waiting for you.\"His parents would discover, when they woke, that he was gone. They would alsofind a cheerful note from Jonas on his bed, telling them that he was going foran early morning ride along the river; that he would be back for the Ceremony.His parents would be irritated but not alarmed. They would think himinconsiderate and they would plan to chastise him, later.They would wait, with mounting anger, for him; finally they would be forced togo, taking Lily to the Ceremony without him.\"They won't say anything to anyone, though,\" Jonas said, quite certain. \"Theywon't call attention to my rudeness because it would reflect on their parenting.And anyway, everyone is so involved in the Ceremony that they probably won'tnotice that I'm not there. Now that I'm a Twelve and in training, I don't haveto sit with my age group any more. So Asher will think I'm with my parents, orwith you—\"\"And your parents will assume you're with Asher, or with me—\"Jonas shrugged. \"It will take everyone a while to realize that I'm not there atall.\"\"And you and I will be long on our way by then.\"In the early morning, The Giver would order a vehicle and driver from theSpeaker. He visited the other communities frequently, meeting with their Elders;his responsibilities extended over all the surrounding areas. So this would notbe an unusual undertaking.Ordinarily The Giver did not attend the December Ceremony. Last year he had beenpresent because of the occasion of Jonas's selection, in which he was soinvolved. But his life was usually quite separate from that of the community. Noone would comment on his absence, or on the fact that he had chosen this day tobe away.When the driver and vehicle arrived, The Giver would send the driver on somebrief errand. During his absence, The Giver would help Jonas hide in the storagearea of the vehicle. He would have with him a bundle of food which The Giverwould save from his own meals during the next two weeks.The Ceremony would begin, with all the community there, and by then Jonas andThe Giver would be on their way.By midday Jonas's absence would become apparent, and would be a cause forserious concern. The Ceremony would not be disrupted—such a disruption would beunthinkable. But searchers would be sent out into the community.By the time his bicycle and clothing were found, The Giver would be returning.Jonas, by then, would be on his own, making his journey Elsewhere.The Giver, on his return, would find the community in a state of confusion andpanic. Confronted by a situation which they had never faced before, and havingno memories from which to find either solace or wisdom, they would not know whatto do and would seek his advice.He would go to the Auditorium where the people would be gathered, still. Hewould stride to the stage and command their attention.He would make the solemn announcement that Jonas had been lost in the river. Hewould immediately begin the Ceremony of Loss.\"Jonas, Jonas,\" they would say loudly, as they had once said the name of Caleb.The Giver would lead the chant. Together they would let Jonas's presence intheir lives fade away as they said his name in unison more slowly, softer andsofter, until he was disappearing from them, until he was no more than anoccasional murmur and then, by the end of the long day, gone forever, not to bementioned again.Their attention would turn to the overwhelming task of bearing the memoriesthemselves. The Giver would help them.\"Yes, I understand that they'll need you,\" Jonas had said at the end of thelengthy discussion and planning. \"But I'll need you, too. Please come with me.\"He knew the answer even as he made the final plea.\"My work will be finished,\" The Giver had replied gently, \"when I have helpedthe community to change and become whole.\"I'm grateful to you, Jonas, because without you I would never have figured outa way to bring about the change. But your role now is to escape. And my role isto stay.\"\"But don't you want to be with me, Giver?\" Jonas asked sadly.The Giver hugged him. \"I love you, Jonas,\" he said. \"But I have another place togo. When my work here is finished, I want to be with my daughter.\"Jonas had been staring glumly at the floor. Now he looked up, startled. \"Ididn't know you had a daughter, Giver! You told me that you'd had a spouse. ButI never knew about your daughter.\"The Giver smiled, and nodded. For the first time in their long months together,Jonas saw him look truly happy.\"Her name was Rosemary,\" The Giver said."},{"pageContent":"21It would work. They could make it work, Jonas told himself again and againthroughout the day.But that evening everything changed. All of it—all the things they had thoughtthrough so meticulously—fell apart.That night, Jonas was forced to flee. He left the dwelling shortly after the skybecame dark and the community still. It was terribly dangerous because some ofthe work crews were still about, but he moved stealthily and silently, stayingin the shadows, making his way past the darkened dwellings and the empty CentralPlaza, toward the river. Beyond the Plaza he could see the House of the Old,with the Annex behind it, outlined against the night sky. But he could not stopthere. There was no time. Every minute counted now, and every minute must takehim farther from the community.Now he was on the bridge, hunched over on the bicycle, pedaling steadily. Hecould see the dark, churning water far below.He felt, surprisingly, no fear, nor any regret at leaving the community behind.But he felt a very deep sadness that he had left his closest friend behind. Heknew that in the danger of his escape he must be absolutely silent; but with hisheart and mind, he called back and hoped that with his capacity forhearing-beyond, The Giver would know that Jonas had said goodbye.It had happened at the evening meal. The family unit was eating together asalways: Lily chattering away, Mother and Father making their customary comments(and lies, Jonas knew) about the day. Nearby, Gabriel played happily on thefloor, babbling his baby talk, looking with glee now and then toward Jonas,obviously delighted to have him back after the unexpected night away from thedwelling.Father glanced down toward the toddler. \"Enjoy it, little guy,\" he said. \"Thisis your last night as visitor.\"\"What do you mean?\" Jonas asked him.Father sighed with disappointment. \"Well, you know he wasn't here when you gothome this morning because we had him stay overnight at the Nurturing Center. Itseemed like a good opportunity, with you gone, to give it a try. He'd beensleeping so soundly.\"\"Didn't it go well?\" Mother asked sympathetically.Father gave a rueful laugh. \"That's an understatement. It was a disaster. Hecried all night, apparently. The night crew couldn't handle it. They were reallyfrazzled by the time I got to work.\"\"Gabe, you naughty thing,\" Lily said, with a scolding little cluck toward thegrinning toddler on the floor.\"So,\" Father went on, \"we obviously had to make the decision. Even I voted forGabriel's release when we had the meeting this afternoon.\"Jonas put down his fork and stared at his father. \"Release?\" he asked.Father nodded. \"We certainly gave it our best try, didn't we?\"\"Yes, we did,\" Mother agreed emphatically.Lily nodded in agreement, too.Jonas worked at keeping his voice absolutely calm. \"When?\" he asked. \"When willhe be released?\"\"First thing tomorrow morning. We have to start our preparations for the NamingCeremony, so we thought we'd get this taken care of right away.\"It's bye-bye to you, Gabe, in the morning,\" Father had said, in his sweet,sing-song voice.Jonas reached the opposite side of the river, stopped briefly, and looked back.The community where his entire life had been lived lay behind him now, sleeping.At dawn, the orderly, disciplined life he had always known would continue again,without him. The life where nothing was ever unexpected. Or inconvenient. Orunusual. The life without color, pain, or past.He pushed firmly again at the pedal with his foot and continued riding along theroad. It was not safe to spend time looking back. He thought of the rules he hadbroken so far: enough that if he were caught, now, he would be condemned.First, he had left the dwelling at night. A major transgression.Second, he had robbed the community of food: a very serious crime, even thoughwhat he had taken was leftovers, set out on the dwelling doorsteps forcollection.Third, he had stolen his father's bicycle. He had hesitated for a moment,standing beside the bikeport in the darkness, not wanting anything of hisfather's and uncertain, as well, whether he could comfortably ride the largerbike when he was so accustomed to his own.But it was necessary because it had the child seat attached to the back.And he had taken Gabriel, too.He could feel the little head nudge his back, bouncing gently against him as herode. Gabriel was sleeping soundly, strapped into the seat. Before he had leftthe dwelling, he had laid his hands firmly on Gabe's back and transmitted to himthe most soothing memory he could: a slow-swinging hammock under palm trees onan island someplace, at evening, with a rhythmic sound of languid water lappinghypnotically against a beach nearby. As the memory seeped from him into thenewchild, he could feel Gabe's sleep ease and deepen. There had been no stir atall when Jonas lifted him from the crib and placed him gently into the moldedseat.He knew that he had the remaining hours of night before they would be aware ofhis escape. So he rode hard, steadily, willing himself not to tire as theminutes and miles passed. There had been no time to receive the memories he andThe Giver had counted on, of strength and courage. So he relied on what he had,and hoped it would be enough.He circled the outlying communities, their dwellings dark. Gradually thedistances between communities widened, with longer stretches of empty road. Hislegs ached at first; then, as time passed, they became numb.At dawn Gabriel began to stir. They were in an isolated place; fields on eitherside of the road were dotted with thickets of trees here and there. He saw astream, and made his way to it across a rutted, bumpy meadow; Gabriel, wideawake now, giggled as the bicycle jolted him up and down.Jonas unstrapped Gabe, lifted him from the bike, and watched him investigate thegrass and twigs with delight. Carefully he hid the bicycle in thick bushes.\"Morning meal, Gabe!\" He unwrapped some of the food and fed them both. Then hefilled the cup he had brought with water from the stream and held it for Gabrielto drink. He drank thirstily himself, and sat by the stream, watching thenewchild play.He was exhausted. He knew he must sleep, resting his own muscles and preparinghimself for more hours on the bicycle. It would not be safe to travel indaylight.They would be looking for him soon.He found a place deeply hidden in the trees, took the newchild there, and laydown, holding Gabriel in his arms. Gabe struggled cheerfully as if it were awrestling game, the kind they had played back in the dwelling, with tickles andlaughter.\"Sorry, Gabe,\" Jonas told him. \"I know it's morning, and I know you just wokeup. But we have to sleep now.\"He cuddled the small body close to him, and rubbed the little back. He murmuredto Gabriel soothingly. Then he pressed his hands firmly and transmitted a memoryof deep, contented exhaustion. Gabriel's head nodded, after a moment, and fellagainst Jonas's chest.Together the fugitives slept through the first dangerous day.The most terrifying thing was the planes. By now, days had passed; Jonas nolonger knew how many. The journey had become automatic: the sleep by days,hidden in underbrush and trees; the finding of water; the careful division ofscraps of food, augmented by what he could find in the fields. And the endless,endless miles on the bicycle by night.His leg muscles were taut now. They ached when he settled himself to sleep. Butthey were stronger, and he stopped now less often to rest. Sometimes he pausedand lifted Gabriel down for a brief bit of exercise, running down the road orthrough a field together in the dark. But always, when he returned, strapped theuncomplaining toddler into the seat again, and remounted, his legs were ready.So he had enough strength of his own, and had not needed what The Giver mighthave provided, had there been time.But when the planes came, he wished that he could have received the courage.He knew they were search planes. They flew so low that they woke him with thenoise of their engines, and sometimes, looking out and up fearfully from thehiding places, he could almost see the faces of the searchers.He knew that they could not see color, and that their flesh, as well asGabriel's light golden curls, would be no more than smears of gray against thecolorless foliage. But he remembered from his science and technology studies atschool that the search planes used heat-seeking devices which could identifybody warmth and would hone in on two humans huddled in shrubbery.So always, when he heard the aircraft sound, he reached to Gabriel andtransmitted memories of snow, keeping some for himself. Together they becamecold; and when the planes were gone, they would shiver, holding each other,until sleep came again.Sometimes, urging the memories into Gabriel, Jonas felt that they were moreshallow, a little weaker than they had been. It was what he had hoped, and whathe and The Giver had planned: that as he moved away from the community, he wouldshed the memories and leave them behind for the people. But now, when he neededthem, when the planes came, he tried hard to cling to what he still had, ofcold, and to use it for their survival.Usually the aircraft came by day, when they were hiding. But he was alert atnight, too, on the road, always listening intently for the sound of the engines.Even Gabriel listened, and would call out, \"Plane! Plane!\" sometimes beforeJonas had heard the terrifying noise. When the aircraft searchers came, as theydid occasionally, during the night as they rode, Jonas sped to the nearest treeor bush, dropped to the ground, and made himself and Gabriel cold. But it wassometimes a frighteningly close call.As he pedaled through the nights, through isolated landscape now, with thecommunities far behind and no sign of human habitation around him or ahead, hewas constantly vigilant, looking for the next nearest hiding place should thesound of engines come.But the frequency of the planes diminished. They came less often, and flew, whenthey did come, less slowly, as if the search had become haphazard and no longerhopeful. Finally there was an entire day and night when they did not come atall."},{"pageContent":"22Now the landscape was changing. It was a subtle change, hard to identify atfirst. The road was narrower, and bumpy, apparently no longer tended by roadcrews. It was harder, suddenly, to balance on the bike, as the front wheelwobbled over stones and ruts.One night Jonas fell, when the bike jolted to a sudden stop against a rock. Hegrabbed instinctively for Gabriel; and the newchild, strapped tightly in hisseat, was uninjured, only frightened when the bike fell to its side. But Jonas'sankle was twisted, and his knees were scraped and raw, blood seeping through historn trousers. Painfully he righted himself and the bike, and reassured Gabe.Tentatively he began to ride in daylight. He had forgotten the fear of thesearchers, who seemed to have diminished into the past. But now there were newfears; the unfamiliar landscape held hidden, unknown perils.Trees became more numerous, and the forests beside the road were dark and thickwith mystery. They saw streams more frequently now and stopped often to drink.Jonas carefully washed his injured knees, wincing as he rubbed at the raw flesh.The constant ache of his swollen ankle was eased when he soaked it occasionallyin the cold water that rushed through roadside gullies.He was newly aware that Gabriel's safety depended entirely upon his owncontinued strength.They saw their first waterfall, and for the first time wildlife.\"Plane! Plane!\" Gabriel called, and Jonas turned swiftly into the trees, thoughhe had not seen planes in days, and he did not hear an aircraft engine now. Whenhe stopped the bicycle in the shrubbery and turned to grab Gabe, he saw thesmall chubby arm pointing toward the sky.Terrified, he looked up, but it was not a plane at all. Though he had never seenone before, he identified it from his fading memories, for The Giver had giventhem to him often. It was a bird.Soon there were many birds along the way, soaring overhead, calling. They sawdeer; and once, beside the road, looking at them curious and unafraid, a smallreddishbrown creature with a thick tail, whose name Jonas did not know. Heslowed the bike and they stared at one another until the creature turned awayand disappeared into the woods.All of it was new to him. After a life of Sameness and predictability, he wasawed by the surprises that lay beyond each curve of the road. He slowed the bikeagain and again to look with wonder at wildflowers, to enjoy the throaty warbleof a new bird nearby, or merely to watch the way wind shifted the leaves in thetrees. During his twelve years in the community, he had never felt such simplemoments of exquisite happiness.But there were desperate fears building in him now as well. The most relentlessof his new fears was that they would starve. Now that they had left thecultivated fields behind them, it was almost impossible to find food. Theyfinished the meager store of potatoes and carrots they had saved from the lastagricultural area, and now they were always hungry.Jonas knelt by a stream and tried without success to catch a fish with hishands. Frustrated, he threw rocks into the water, knowing even as he did so thatit was useless. Finally, in desperation, he fashioned a makeshift net, loopingthe strands of Gabriel's blanket around a curved stick.After countless tries, the net yielded two flopping silvery fish. MethodicallyJonas hacked them to pieces with a sharp rock and fed the raw shreds to himselfand to Gabriel. They ate some berries, and tried without success to catch abird.At night, while Gabriel slept beside him, Jonas lay awake, tortured by hunger,and remembered his life in the community where meals were delivered to eachdwelling every day.He tried to use the flagging power of his memory to recreate meals, and managedbrief, tantalizing fragments: banquets with huge roasted meats; birthday partieswith thick-frosted cakes; and lush fruits picked and eaten, sunwarmed anddripping, from trees.But when the memory glimpses subsided, he was left with the gnawing, painfulemptiness. Jonas remembered, suddenly and grimly, the time in his childhood whenhe had been chastised for misusing a word. The word had been \"starving.\" Youhave never been starving, he had been told. You will never be starving.Now he was. If he had stayed in the community, he would not be. It was as simpleas that. Once he had yearned for choice. Then, when he had had a choice, he hadmade the wrong one: the choice to leave. And now he was starving.But if he had stayed...His thoughts continued. If he had stayed, he would have starved in other ways.He would have lived a life hungry for feelings, for color, for love.And Gabriel? For Gabriel there would have been no life at all. So there had notreally been a choice.It became a struggle to ride the bicycle as Jonas weakened from lack of food,and realized at the same time that he was encountering something he had for along time yearned to see: hills. His sprained ankle throbbed as he forced thepedal downward in an effort that was almost beyond him.And the weather was changing. It rained for two days. Jonas had never seen rain,though he had experienced it often in the memories. He had liked those rains,enjoyed the new feeling of it, but this was different. He and Gabriel becamecold and wet, and it was hard to get dry, even when sunshine occasionallyfollowed.Gabriel had not cried during the long frightening journey. Now he did. He criedbecause he was hungry and cold and terribly weak. Jonas cried, too, for the samereasons, and another reason as well. He wept because he was afraid now that hecould not save Gabriel. He no longer cared about himself."},{"pageContent":"23Jonas felt more and more certain that the destination lay ahead of him, verynear now in the night that was approaching. None of his senses confirmed it. Hesaw nothing ahead except the endless ribbon of road unfolding in twisting narrowcurves. He heard no sound ahead.Yet he felt it: felt that Elsewhere was not far away. But he had little hopeleft that he would be able to reach it. His hope diminished further when thesharp, cold air began to blur and thicken with swirling white.Gabriel, wrapped in his inadequate blanket, was hunched, shivering, and silentin his little seat. Jonas stopped the bike wearily, lifted the child down, andrealized with heartbreak how cold and weak Gabe had become.Standing in the freezing mound that was thickening around his numb feet, Jonasopened his own tunic, held Gabriel to his bare chest, and tied the torn anddirty blanket around them both. Gabriel moved feebly against him and whimperedbriefly into the silence that surrounded them.Dimly, from a nearly forgotten perception as blurred as the substance itself,Jonas recalled what the whiteness was.\"It's called snow, Gabe,\" Jonas whispered. \"Snowflakes. They fall down from thesky, and they're very beautiful.\"There was no response from the child who had once been so curious and alert.Jonas looked down through the dusk at the little head against his chest.Gabriel's curly hair was matted and filthy, and there were tearstains outlinedin dirt on his pale cheeks. His eyes were closed. As Jonas watched, a snowflakedrifted down and was caught briefly for a moment's sparkle in the tinyfluttering eyelashes.Wearily he remounted the bicycle. A steep hill loomed ahead. In the best ofconditions, the hill would have been a difficult, demanding ride. But now therapidly deepening snow obscured the narrow road and made the ride impossible.His front wheel moved forward imperceptibly as he pushed on the pedals with hisnumb, exhausted legs. But the bicycle stopped. It would not move.He got off and let it drop sideways into the snow. For a moment he thought howeasy it would be to drop beside it himself, to let himself and Gabriel slideinto the softness of snow, the darkness of night, the warm comfort of sleep.But he had come this far. He must try to go on.The memories had fallen behind him now, escaping from his protection to returnto the people of his community. Were there any left at all? Could he hold onto alast bit of warmth? Did he still have the strength to Give? Could Gabriel stillReceive?He pressed his hands into Gabriel's back and tried to remember sunshine. For amoment it seemed that nothing came to him, that his power was completely gone.Then it flickered suddenly, and he felt tiny tongues of heat begin to creepacross and into his frozen feet and legs. He felt his face begin to glow and thetense, cold skin of his arms and hands relax. For a fleeting second he felt thathe wanted to keep it for himself, to let himself bathe in sunlight, unburdenedby anything or anyone else.But the moment passed and was followed by an urge, a need, a passionate yearningto share the warmth with the one person left for him to love. Aching from theeffort, he forced the memory of warmth into the thin, shivering body in hisarms.Gabriel stirred. For a moment they both were bathed in warmth and renewedstrength as they stood hugging each other in the blinding snow.Jonas began to walk up the hill.The memory was agonizingly brief. He had trudged no more than a few yardsthrough the night when it was gone and they were cold again.But his mind was alert now. Warming himself ever so briefly had shaken away thelethargy and resignation and restored his will to survive. He began to walkfaster on feet that he could no longer feel. But the hill was treacherouslysteep; he was impeded by the snow and his own lack of strength. He didn't makeit very far before he stumbled and fell forward.On his knees, unable to rise, Jonas tried a second time. His consciousnessgrasped at a wisp of another warm memory, and tried desperately to hold itthere, to enlarge it, and pass it into Gabriel. His spirits and strength liftedwith the momentary warmth and he stood. Again, Gabriel stirred against him as hebegan to climb.But the memory faded, leaving him colder than before.If only he had had time to receive more warmth from The Giver before he escaped!Maybe there would be more left for him now. But there was no purpose inif-onlys. His entire concentration now had to be on moving his feet, warmingGabriel and himself, and going forward.He climbed, stopped, and warmed them both briefly again, with a tiny scrap ofmemory that seemed certainly to be all he had left.The top of the hill seemed so far away, and he did not know what lay beyond. Butthere was nothing left to do but continue. He trudged upward.As he approached the summit of the hill at last, something began to happen. Hewas not warmer; if anything, he felt more numb and more cold. He was not lessexhausted; on the contrary, his steps were leaden, and he could barely move hisfreezing, tired legs.But he began, suddenly, to feel happy. He began to recall happy times. Heremembered his parents and his sister. He remembered his friends, Asher andFiona. He remembered The Giver.Memories of joy flooded through him suddenly.He reached the place where the hill crested and he could feel the ground underhis snow-covered feet become level. It would not be uphill anymore.\"We're almost there, Gabriel,\" he whispered, feeling quite certain withoutknowing why. \"I remember this place, Gabe.\" And it was true. But it was not agrasping of a thin and burdensome recollection; this was different. This wassomething that he could keep. It was a memory of his own.He hugged Gabriel and rubbed him briskly, warming him, to keep him alive. Thewind was bitterly cold. The snow swirled, blurring his vision. But somewhereahead, through the blinding storm, he knew there was warmth and light.Using his final strength, and a special knowledge that was deep inside him,Jonas found the sled that was waiting for them at the top of the hill. Numblyhis hands fumbled for the rope.He settled himself on the sled and hugged Gabe close. The hill was steep but thesnow was powdery and soft, and he knew that this time there would be no ice, nofall, no pain. Inside his freezing body, his heart surged with hope.They started down.Jonas felt himself losing consciousness and with his whole being willed himselfto stay upright atop the sled, clutching Gabriel, keeping him safe. The runnerssliced through the snow and the wind whipped at his face as they sped in astraight line through an incision that seemed to lead to the final destination,the place that he had always felt was waiting, the Elsewhere that held theirfuture and their past.He forced his eyes open as they went downward, downward, sliding, and all atonce he could see lights, and he recognized them now. He knew they were shiningthrough the windows of rooms, that they were the red, blue, and yellow lightsthat twinkled from trees in places where families created and kept memories,where they celebrated love.Downward, downward, faster and faster Suddenly he was aware with certainty andjoy that below, ahead, they were waiting for him; and that they were waiting,too, for the baby. For the first time, he heard something that he knew to bemusic. He heard people singing.Behind him, across vast distances of space and time, from the place he had left,he thought he heard music too. But perhaps it was only an echo."}]
