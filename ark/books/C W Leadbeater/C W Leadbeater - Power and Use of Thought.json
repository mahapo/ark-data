Leadbeater The Theosophical Publishing House Adyar, Chennai 600 020 India Wheaton, III.,USA London, England The Theosophical Publishing House, 1911 1.  THOSE who are ignorant of Theosophy sometimes suppose it to be merely a system of speculative philosophy. Nothing could be farther from the truth than this; there is nothing in any way speculative about it, for it is founded entirely upon observation of facts, a nd upon experiments made in connection with the phenomena and the forces of Nature. From its study emerges a practical rule of life—a rule which cannot but affe ct the thought and action of its students at every moment of their existence. This is chiefly because it involve s a study of life as it really is, so that its students become acquainted with the whole of the world in which the y live instead of knowing only the least important part of it. They are led to understand the laws of evolution; a nd they naturally learn to live intelligently in accor dance with those laws and to take into account the unseen part of the world as well as the infinitesimal portion whic h is within reach of the limited physical senses. 2.  Of the general nature of the unseen world I have written elsewhere. For the moment, let us concentra te"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"our attention on one of its most striking character istics— the ready response of the finer types of matter (of which it is constructed) to the influences of human thoug ht and emotion. It is difficult for those who have not stu died the subject to grasp the absolute reality of the forces —to understand that they are in every respect as defini te in their action upon the finer type of matter as is th e power of stream or electricity upon physical matter. Ever yone knows that a man who has at his disposal a large amount of steam power or electrical power can do us eful work and produce definite results; but few people k now that every man has at his disposal a certain amount of this other and higher power, and that with that he can produce results just as definite and just as real. As matters stand at present in the physical world, onl y a few men can have at their disposal any large amount of its forces and so only a few can become rich by their means; but it is a prominent feature of the vivid i nterest in the unseen side of life that every human being, rich or poor, old or young, has already at his disposal no inconsiderable proportion of its forces. And theref ore the riches of these higher planes, which are obtained b y the right use of these powers, are within the reach of all. 3.  Here, then, is a power possessed by all, but intelligently used as yet by few, It is surely well worth our while to take up the matter, to enquire into it, an d to try to comprehend it. Indeed, there is even more reason for doing so than has yet been mentioned, for the truth is that to some extent we are all already unconsciousl y making use of this power and, because of our ignora nce, we are employing it wrongly and doing harm with it instead of good. The possession of power always mea ns responsibility; so in order to avoid doing harm unintentionally, and in order to utilize thoroughly these magnificent possibilities, it will clearly be well for us to learn all that we can on the subject. 4.  What, then, is thought, and how does it show itself ? Those who have even a superficial acquaintance with theosophical literature are aware that man possesse s a vehicle corresponding to each of the interpenetrati ng worlds of our solar system—that his astral body is the vehicle of his desires, passions, and emotions; and that his thought expresses itself through that higher ve hicle of still finer matter which we usually call the men tal body."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"It is in this latter vehicle that thought first sho ws itself to the sight of the clairvoyant; and it appears as a v ibration of its matter—a vibration which is found to produce various effects, all of them quite in line with wha t scientific experience in the physical world would l ead us to expect. 5.  First, there is the effect produced upon the mental body itself; and we find that to be of the nature o f setting up a habit. There are many different types of matte r in the mental body, and each of them appears to have i ts own special rate of oscillation to which it seems m ost accustomed, so that it readily responds to it and t ends to return thereto as soon as possible when it has been forced away from it by some strong rush of thought or feeling. A sufficiently strong thought may, for the moment, set the whole of the matter of the mental b ody swinging at the same rate; and every time that happ ens it is a little easier for it to happen again. A hab it of vibrating at that rate is being set up in the menta l body so that the man will readily repeat that particular thought. 6.  Secondly, there is the effect produced upon the oth er vehicles of the man which are above and below the mental body in degree of density. We know that in t he physical world disturbances in one type of matter a re readily communicated to another type—that, for example, an earthquake will produce a mighty wave i n the sea; and again (from the other side) that the disturbance of the air by a storm will immediately produce ripples, and presently great waves, in the ocean beneath it. In just the same way, a disturbance in a man’s astral body (that is to say, what we commonly call an emotion) will set up undulations in the mental b ody and cause thoughts which correspond to the emotion. Conversely, the movement in the mental body affects the astral body, if it be of a type which can affec t it— which means that certain types of thought will read ily provoke emotion. Just as the mental vibration acts upon the astral matter, which is denser than it is, so a lso does it inevitably act upon the matter of the causal bod y which is finer than it. Thus the habitual thought of the man builds up qualities in the ego himself. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"7.  So far, we have been dealing with the effect of the man’s thought upon himself; and we see that in the first place it tends to repeat itself, and that in the se cond place it acts not only upon his emotions but also permanently upon the man himself. Now let us turn t o the effects which it produces outside of himself—th at is, upon the sea of mental matter which surrounds us al l, just as does the atmosphere. 8.  Thirdly, then, every thought produces a radiating undulation, which may be either simple or complex according to the nature of the thought that gives i t birth. This vibration may, under certain conditions, be co nfined to the mental world, but it may also produce an eff ect in worlds above and below. If the thought be purely intellectual and impersonal—it, for example, the th inker is considering a philosophical system or attempting to solve a problem in algebra or geometry—the wave sen t forth will affect merely the mental matter. If the thought be of a spiritual nature—if it be tinged with love or aspiration, or with deep unselfish feeling—it will rise upwards into the realm of the higher mental, and ma y even borrow some of the splendour and glory of the intuitional level—a combination which renders it exceedingly powerful. If, on the other hand, the th ought is tinged with something of self or of personal des ire, its oscillations at once draw downwards and expend most of their force in the astral world. 9.  All these undulations act upon their respective lev els just as does a vibration of light or sound here in the physical world. They radiate out in all directions, becoming less powerful in proportion to their dista nce from their source. But we should remember that the radiations affect not only the sea of mental matter which surrounds us, but other mental bodies moving within that sea. We are all familiar with the experiment in whi ch a note struck or a piano, on a string sounded on a vi olin, will set the corresponding note sounding upon anoth er instrument of the same kind which has been tuned exactly to the same pitch. Just as the vibration se t up in one instrument is conveyed through the air and acts upon the other instrument, so is the thought-vibrat ion set up in one mental body conveyed by the surrounding mental matter and reproduced in another mental body — which, stated from another point of view, means tha t"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"thought is infectious. We shall return to this consideration later. 10.  Fourthly, every thought produces not only an undulation but a form—a definite, separate object— which is endowed with force and vitality of a certa in kind and, in many cases, behaves like a temporary living creature. This form, like the vibration, may be in the mental world only; but much more frequently it desc ends to the astral level and produces its principal effe ct in the world of emotions. The study of these thought-forms is of great interest; a detailed account of many of them, with coloured illustrations of their appearance, will be found in a book called Thought-Forms . * [The Theosophical Publishing House]. At the moment, we are concerned less with their appearance than with their effects and with the way in which they can be utilized. 11.  Let us consider separately the action of these two manifestations of thought-power. The vibration may be simple or it may be complex, according to the chara cter of the thought ; but its strength is poured out chi efly upon some one of the four levels of mental matter—the fo ur subdivisions which constitute the lower part of the mental world. Most of the thoughts of the ordinary man centre round himself, his desires, and his emotions , and they are therefore undulations of the lowest subdiv ision of mental matter; indeed, the corresponding part of the mental body is the only one which is as yet fully developed and active in the great majority of manki nd. It must not be forgotten that in this respect the cond ition of the mental body is very different from that of the astral vehicle. In the ordinary cultured man of our race t he astral body is as fully developed as the physical, and he is perfectly capable of using it as a vehicle of consciousness. But he is not yet much in the habit of so using it, and is consequently shy about it and dist rustful of his powers; but the astral powers are all there, and it is simply a question of becoming accustomed to thei r use. When he finds himself functioning in the astra l world either during sleep or after death, he is ful ly capable of sight and hearing and can move about whithersoever he will. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"12.  In the heaven-world, however, he finds himself unde r very different conditions, for the mental body is a s yet by no means fully developed, that being the part of it s evolution upon which the human race is at the prese nt moment engaged. The mental body can be employed as a vehicle only by those who have been specially tra ined in its use under teachers belonging to the Great Brotherhood of Initiates; in the average man it is only partially developed and cannot in the least be empl oyed as a separate vehicle of consciousness. In the majo rity of men the higher portions of the mental body are a s yet quite dormant, even when the lower portions are in vigorous activity. This necessarily implies that wh ile the whole mental atmosphere is surging with vibrations belonging to the lowest subdivision, there is as ye t comparatively little activity on the higher subdivi sions—a fact which we shall need to have clearly in mind wh en we come to consider presently the practical possibi lity of the use of thought-power. It has also an important bearing upon the distance to which a thought-wave c an penetrate. 13.  The distance covered by such a wave and the strength and persistence with which it can impinge upon the mental bodies of others, depend upon the streng th and clarity of the original thought. In this respec t it resembles the voice of the speaker, setting in moti on waves of sound in the air which radiate from him in all directions and convey his words to all those who ar e within hearing; and the distance to which his voice can penetrate depends upon its strength and the clearne ss of his enunciation. In exactly the same way, a stro ng thought will carry much farther than one which is w eak and undecided; but clearness and distinctness are o f even greater importance than strength. Again, just as the speaker’s voice may fall upon heedless ears where m en are already engaged in business or in pleasure, so may a strong wave of thought sweep past without affecti ng the mind of a man if he is already wholly engrossed in some other line of thought. Many men, however, do n ot think definitely or strongly except when in the imm ediate prosecution of some business that demands their who le attention, so that there are always within reach ma ny minds that are likely to be considerably affected b y the thoughts which impinge upon them. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"14.  The action of this undulation is highly adaptable. It may exactly reproduce itself, if it finds a mental body which readily responds to it in every particular; b ut when this is not the case it may nevertheless produce a decided effect along lines broadly similar to its o wn. Suppose for example, that a Catholic kneels in devo tion before an image of the Blessed Virgin. He sends rip pling out from him in all directions strong devotional vi brations; if they strike upon the mental or astral body of an other Catholic, they will arouse in him a thought and fee ling identical with the original. But if they should str ike upon a Christian of some other sect, to whom the image of the Blessed Virgin is unfamiliar, they will still awake n in him the sentiment of devotion, but it will follow along its accustomed channel and be directed, perhaps, toward s the Christ. 15.  In the same way, if they should touch a Muslim they would arouse in him devotion to Allah, while in the case of a Hindu the object might be Krishna and in the c ase of a Parsi, Ahuramazda. But they would excite devotion of some sort wherever there was a possibility of respo nse to that idea. If, however, they should touch the me ntal body of a materialist, to whom the very idea of dev otion in any form is unknown, they would still produce an elevating effect. They could not at once create a t ype of vibration to which the man was wholly unaccustomed, but their tendency would be to stir a higher part o f his mental body into some sort of activity, and the eff ect, though less permanent than in the case of the sympathetic recipient, could not fail to be good. 16.  The action of an evil or impure thought is governed by the same laws. A man who is so foolish as to allow himself to think of another with hatred or envy rad iates a wave tending to provoke similar passions in others; and though his feeling of hatred be for someone quite unknown to these others, so that it is impossible f or them to share it, yet the radiation will stir in then an emotion of the same nature towards a totally different person. 17.  The work of the thought-form is more limited but mu ch more precise than that of the undulation. It cannot reach so many persons—indeed we may say that it cannot ac t"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"upon a person at all unless he has in him something which is harmonious with the vibrant energy which ensouls it. The powers and possibilities of these t hought- forms will perhaps be clearer to us if we attempt t o classify them. Let us consider first the thought wh ich is definitely directed towards another person—as when a man sends forth from himself a thought of affection or gratitude, envy or jealousy, towards someone else. Such a thought will produce radiating waves precisely as would any other, and will therefore tend to reprodu ce itself in the minds of those within the sphere of i ts influence. But the thought-form which it creates is imbued with definite intention and as soon as it br eaks away from the mental and astral bodies of the think er it goes straight towards the person to whom it is dire cted and fastens itself upon him. 18.  It may be compared not ineptly to a Leyden jar with its charge of electricity—the matter of the mental and astral worlds forming the body represented by the jar, and the vibrant energy of the thought which ensouls it corresponding to the charge of electricity. If the man towards whom it is directed is at that moment in a passive condition, or if he has within him active oscillations of a character harmonious with its own , it will at once discharge itself upon him. Its effect will naturally be to provoke an undulation similar to its own if n one such previously existed, and to intensify it if it is already to be found there. If the man’s mind is for the tim e so strongly occupied along some other lines that it is impossible for the vibration to find an entrance, t he thought-form hovers about him waiting for an opport unity to discharge itself. 19.  In the case of a thought which is not directed to s ome other person but is connected chiefly with the thin ker himself (as indeed are the majority of men’s though ts) the undulation spreads in all directions as usual, but the thought-form floats in the immediate neighbourhood of its creator, and its tendency is constantly to reac t upon him. As long as his mind is fully occupied with bus iness or with a thought of some other type, the floating form simply bides its time; but when his train of though t is exhausted, or his mind for a moment lies fallow, it has an opportunity to react upon him, and immediately it b egins to repeat itself—to stir up in his mind a repetitio n of the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"thought to which he had previously yielded himself. Many a man may be seen surrounded by a shell of suc h thought-forms, and will frequently feel their press ure upon him—a constant suggestion from without of cert ain thoughts; and if the thought be evil, he very likel y believes himself to be tempted by the devil, wherea s the truth is that he is his own tempter and that the ev il thoughts are entirely his own creation. 20.  Thirdly, there is the class of thought which is nei ther centred round the thinker nor aimed specially at an y person. The thought-form generated in this case doe s not hang about the thinker, nor has it any special attraction towards another man, so it simply remain s idly floating where it was called into existence. Each m an as he moves through life is thus producing three class es of thought-forms—those which shoot straight out away from him aiming at a definite object; those which h over round him and follow him wherever he goes; and thos e which he leaves behind him as a sort of trail which marks his route. 21.  The whole atmosphere is filled with thoughts of thi s third type, vague and indeterminate; so that as we walk along we are, as it were, picking our way through v ast masses of them; and if our minds are not already definitely occupied, these vague wandering fragment s of other people’s thought will seriously affect us. Th ey sweep through the mind which is lying idle, and pro bably the majority of them do not arouse in it any specia l interest; but now and then comes one which attracts attention and the mind fastens upon it, entertains it for a moment or two, and dismisses it a little stronger t han it was on arrival. Naturally this mixture of thought f rom many sources has no definite coherence—though it must be remembered that any one of these may start a line of associated ideas and so set the mind thinki ng on its own account. If a man pulls himself up suddenly as he walks along the street and asks himself: ‘What a m I thinking about, and why? How did I reach this parti cular point in my train of thought?’ and if he tries to f ollow back the line of his thoughts for the last ten minutes h e will probably be quite surprised to discover how many id le and useless thoughts have passed through his mind i n that space of time. They are not one fourth of them his own thoughts; they are simply those fragments which he"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"has picked up as he passed along. In most cases the y are quite valueless and their general tendency is distinctly more likely to be evil than good. 22.  Now that we understand to some extent the action of thought, let us see what use it is possible to make of this knowledge and what practical considerations emerge from it. Knowing these things, what can we do to fo rward our own evolution, and what can we do to help other s? Obviously, a scientific consideration of the way in which thought works exhibits it as a matter of far greate r importance for evolution than we ordinarily suppose . Since every thought or emotion produces a permanent effect by strengthening or weakening a tendency and since furthermore, every thought-vibration and thou ght- form must inevitably react upon the thinker, the gr eatest care must be exercised as to the thought or emotion which a man permits within himself. The ordinary ma n rarely thinks of attempting to check an emotion; wh en he feels it surging within him he yields himself to it and considers it merely natural. One who studies scientifically the action of these forces realizes that it is in his interest as well as his duty to check every such upwelling and consider, before he allows it to sway him, whether it is or is not prejudicial to his evolutio n. 23.  Instead of allowing his emotions to run away with h im, he must have them absolutely under control; and sin ce the state of evolution at which we have arrived is the development of the mental body, he must take this matter also seriously in hand and see what can be d one to assist that development. Instead of allowing the mind to indulge in its vagaries he should endeavour that the mind is not the man, but is an instrument which the man must learn to use. It must not be left to lie fallo w; it must not be allowed to remain idle so that any passing thought-form can drift in upon it and impress it. T he worthy Isaac Watts long ago remarked that ‘Satan fi nds some mischief still for idle hands to do’, and cert ainly there is truth in the saying when it is applied to these higher levels, for the mind which is left unoccupie d is far more likely to take up evil impressions than good o nes. The first step towards control of the mind is to le arn to keep it usefully occupied—to have some definite goo d and useful set of thoughts as a background to its operation—something upon which it can always fall b ack"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"when there is no immediate need for its activity in connection with duty to be done. 24.  Another most necessary point in its training is tha t it should be taught to do thoroughly that which it has to do—in other words, that the power of concentration should be acquired. This is no light task, as any unpractised person will find who endeavours to keep his mind absolutely upon one point even for five minute s. He will find that there is an active tendency to wande r, that all kinds of other thoughts thrust themselves in. T he first effort to fix the mind on one subject for five minu tes is likely to resolve itself into spending five minutes in bringing the mind back again and again from various side-issues which it has followed. Fortunately, tho ugh concentration itself is no easy thing, there are pl enty of opportunities for attempting it, and the acquisitio n of it will be of great use in our daily life. We should l earn then, whatever we are doing, to focus our attention upon it, and to do it with all our might and as well as it can be done. If we write a letter, let that letter be well and accurately written, and let no carelessness in deta il delay it or mar its effect; if we are reading a boo k, even though it be only a novel, let us read it with atte ntion, trying to grasp the author’s meaning and to gain fr om it all that there is to be gained. The endeavour to be constantly learning something, to let no day pass w ithout some definite exercise of the mind, is a most salut ary one; for it is only by exercise that strength comes , and disuse always means weakness and eventual atrophy. 25.  Another point of great importance is that we should learn to husband our energy. Each man possesses onl y a certain amount of energy and he is responsible fo r using it to the best advantage. The ordinary man wa stes his forces in the most foolish manner; but it is es pecially necessary for the student of occultism to learn to avoid this. The average man is simply a centre of agitate d vibrations; he is constantly in a state of worry, o f trouble about something, or of depression, or else he is un duly excited in the endeavour to grasp something. For on e reason or another he is always in a state of unnece ssary agitation, usually about the nearest trifle. Althou gh he never thinks about it, he is all the while influenc ing other people around him by this condition of his astral a nd mental bodies; he is constantly communicating these"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"vibrations and this agitation to those unfortunate people who are near him. It is just because millions of pe ople are thus unnecessarily agitated by all sorts of foo lish desires and feelings that it is difficult for a sen sitive person to live in a large city or to go into a grea t crowd of his fellow men. 26.  Another way in which the average man wastes a great deal of force is by unnecessary argument. It appears to be impossible for him to hold any opinio n, whether it be religious or political, or relating t o some matter in ordinary life, without becoming a prey to an overmastering desire to force this opinion upon eve ryone else. He seems quite incapable of grasping the rudimentary fact that what another man chooses to believe is no business of his, and that he is not commissioned by the authorities in charge of the wo rld to go round and secure uniformity in thought and practice. The wise man realizes that truth is a man y- sided thing, not commonly held in its entirety by a ny one man or by any one set of men; he knows that there i s room for diversity of opinion upon almost any conceivable subject, and that therefore a man whose point of view is opposite to his own may neverthele ss have something of reason and truth in his belief. H e knows that most of the subjects over which men argu e are not in the least worth the trouble of discussio n, and that those who speak most loudly and most confident ly about them are usually those who know least. The student of occultism will therefore decline to wast e his time in argument; if he is asked for information he is quite willing to give it, but not to waste his time and strength in unprofitable wrangling. 27.  Another painfully common method of wasting strength is in worry. Many men are constantly forecasting ev il for themselves and for those whom they love—troubling themselves with the fear of death and of what comes after it, with the fear of financial ruin or loss o f social position. A vast amount of strength is frittered aw ay along these unprofitable and unpleasant lines; but all such foolishness is swept aside for the man who rea lizes that the world is governed by a law of absolute jus tice, that progress towards the highest is the divine Wil l for him, that he cannot escape from that progress, that whatever comes in his way and whatever happens to"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"him is meant to help him along that line, and that he himself is the only person who can delay that advan ce. He no longer fears for himself or others; he simply goes on and does the duty that comes nearest in the best way that he can, confident that if he does this, all wi ll be well for him. He knows that worry never helped anyone, n or has it ever been of the slightest use, but that it has been responsible for an immense amount of evil and waste of force. 28.  The wise man declines to spend his strength in ill- directed emotion. For example, he will utterly decl ine to take offence at what is said or done by someone els e. If another man says something which is untrue or offensive, it is certain that in nine cases out of ten there was no evil intention behind the remark, so that it is not only foolish but unjust to be disturbed about it. E ven in the rare case where the remark is intentionally wic ked and spiteful—where the man said something purposely to wound another—it is still utterly foolish for th at other to allow himself to feel hurt. The irritating word doe s not in any way injure him, except in so far as he may choo se to take it up and injure himself by brooding over it o r allowing himself to be wounded in his feelings. Wha t are the words of another, that he should let his sereni ty be disturbed by them? If he permits himself to care ab out what another has said, then it is he himself who is responsible for the disturbance created in his ment al body and not the other man. The other has done and can do nothing that can harm him, and if the studen t feels hurt and injured, and thereby makes a great d eal of trouble for himself, he has only himself to thank f or it. If he suffers a disturbance to arise within his mental body or his astral body in reference to something that a nother has said, that is merely because he has not yet per fect control over his vehicles; he has not yet developed the common sense which enables him to look down as a soul upon all this, and to go on his way and attend to his own work without taking the slightest notice of foo lish or spiteful remarks made by others. 29.  But this is, after all, only one side of the matter , and that the least important. It is certainly necessary for his own evolution that a man should keep his mind and emotion under control and not foolishly waste his f orce; but it is assuredly still more necessary from anoth er point"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"of view, because it is only by such care that he ca n enable himself to be of use to his fellow men, that he can avoid doing harm to them and can learn how to do go od. If, for example, he lets himself feel angry, he nat urally produces a serious effect upon himself because he s ets up an evil habit and makes it more difficult to res ist the evil impulse next time it assails him. But he also acts seriously upon others around him for, inevitably, t he vibration which radiates from him must affect them also. If he is making an effort to control his irritabili ty, so perhaps are they, and his action will help or hinde r them, even though he is not in the least thinking of them . Every time that he allows himself to send out a wave of a nger, it tends to arouse a similar vibration in the mind or astral body of another—to arouse it if it has not previous ly existed, and to intensify it if it is already prese nt; and thus he makes his brother’s work of self-developmen t harder, and places a heavier burden upon his should ers. On the other hand, if he controls and represses tha t wave of anger, he radiates instead calming and soot hing influences which are distinctly helpful to all thos e near him who are engaged in the same struggle. 30.  Inevitably and without any effort of ours, any thou ght which arises within our minds must be influencing t he minds of others about us. Consider then the responsibility if a thought be impure or evil, for we are then spreading moral contagion among our fellow men . Hundreds and thousands of people possess within the m latent germs of evil—germs which may never blossom and bear fruit unless some force from without plays upon them and stirs them into activity. If we yield ours elves to an impure or unholy thought, the wave of force whic h we thus produce may be the very factor which awakens t he germ and causes it to begin to grow, and so we may start some soul upon a downward career. The impulse so given may blossom out later into thoughts and wo rds and deeds of evil, and these in their turn may inju riously affect thousands of other men, even in the far dist ant future. We see then how terrible is the responsibil ity for a single impure or evil thought. Happily all this is true of good thought as well as of evil, and the man who realizes this may set himself to work to be a verit able sun, constantly radiating upon all his neighbours thoughts of love and calm and peace. This is a trul y magnificent power, yet it is within the reach of ev ery human being, of the poorest as well as the wealthie st, of the little child as well as the great sage."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 31.  Possessing this tremendous power, we must be careful how we exercise it. We must remember to thi nk of a person as we wish him to be, for the image tha t we make of him will naturally act powerfully upon him and tend to draw him gradually into harmony with itself . Let us fix our thoughts upon the good qualities of our friends, because in thinking of any quality we tend to stren gthen its undulations and therefore to intensify it. 32.  From this consideration it follows that the habit o f gossip and scandal, in which many people thoughtles sly indulge themselves, is in reality a horrible wicked ness, in condemning which no expression can be too strong. When people are guilty of the impertinence of discu ssing others, it is not usually upon the good qualities t hat they most insist. We have, therefore, a number of people fixing their thought upon some alleged evil in anot her, calling to that evil the attention of others who mi ght perhaps not have observed it; and in this way, if t hat bad quality really exists in the person whom they are s o improperly criticizing, they distinctly increase it by strengthening the vibration which is its expression . If, as is usually the case, the depravity exists only in t heir own prurient imagination and is not present in the pers on about whom they are gossiping, they are doing the utmost in their power to create that evil quality i n that person, and, if there be any latent germ of it exis ting in their victim, their nefarious effort is only too li kely to be successful. 33.  Assuredly we may think helpfully of those whom we love; we may hold before them in thought a high ide al of themselves and wish strongly that they may presentl y be enabled to attain it. If we know of certain defects or vices in a man’s character we should never under any circumstances let our thoughts dwell upon them and intensify them; on the contrary, we should formulat e a strong thought of the contrary virtues and send out waves of that thought to the man who needs our help . The ordinary method is for one to say to another: ‘ O, my dear, what a terrible thing it is that Mrs So-and-s o is so ill-tempered! Why, do you know, only yesterday she did this and that, and I have heard that she constantly , etc., etc. Isn’t it a terrible thing?"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 34.  And this is repeated by each of her thirty or forty dearest friends so that in a few hours several hund red people are pouring converging streams of thought, a ll about anger and irritability, upon the unfortunate victim. Is it any wonder that she presently justifies their expectations and gives them yet another example of ill- temper over which they can gloat? 35.  A man wishing to help in such a case will be especially careful to avoid the idea of anger, but will think with all his force: ‘I wish Mrs So-and-so wer e calm and serene; she has the possibility of such self-co ntrol within her; let me try frequently to send her a str ong, calm soothing influence that will help her to reali ze the divine possibility within her.’ In the one case the thought is of anger, and in the other it is of serenity; in both alike it will inevitably find its goal and reproduce itse lf in the mental and astral bodies of the person of whom the thought is made. By all means let us think frequent ly and lovingly of our friends, but let us think of their good points and try, by concentrating our attention upon those, to strengthen them and to help our friends b y their means; let our criticism be of that happy kind whic h grasps at a pearl as eagerly as the criticism of th e average man pounces upon an imaginary flaw. 36.  A man will often say that he cannot control his tho ught or his passion, that he has often tried to do so bu t has constantly failed, and has therefore come to the conclusion that such efforts are useless. This idea is wholly unscientific. If an evil quality or habit po ssesses a certain amount of strength within us, it is because in previous lives we have allowed that strength to accumulate—because we have not resisted it in the beginning when it could easily have been repressed, but have permitted it to gather the momentum which make s it difficult now to deal with it. 37.  We have, in fact, made it very easy for ourselves t o move along a certain line, and correspondingly diff icult to move along another line—difficult, but not impossib le. The amount of momentum or energy accumulated is"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"necessarily a finite amount; even if we have devote d several lives entirely to storing up such energy (a n unlikely supposition), still the time so occupied h as been limited and the results are necessarily finite. If we have now realized the mistake we made, and are settling ourselves to control the habit and to counteract th e impetus, we shall find it necessary to put forth ex actly as much strength in the opposite direction as we origi nally spent in setting up that momentum. Naturally, we ca nnot instantly produce sufficient force entirely to coun teract the work of many years, but every effort which we m ake will reduce the amount of force stored up. We ourse lves, as living souls, can go on generating force indefin itely; we have an infinite store of strength on which to d raw and therefore it is absolutely certain that if we p ersevere we must eventually succeed. However often we may fa il, each time we succeed something is withdrawn from th at finite store of force and it will be exhausted befo re we shall; our eventual success is simply a matter of mechanics. 38.  You may have seen a railway porter, by steady and continuous pushing, set a big wagon or carriage in motion. Having brought it where he wishes, how does he stop it? It is quite impossible for him, even by th e exertion of his utmost strength, to check it instantaneously; so he puts himself in front of it and pushes vigorously against it, walking backwards as it forces him along, but never ceasing to exert his fo rce against its advance. Thus by degrees he counterbalances the momentum which he has himself produced in it, and so at last wins the victory and brings it to rest. A good object-lesson in the neutralizat ion of previous karma! 39.  The knowledge of the use of these thought-currents makes it possible for us to give assistance when we know of some case of sorrow or suffering. It very o ften happens that we are unable to do anything for the sufferer in the physical world; our physical presen ce may not be helpful to him; his physical brain may be cl osed to our suggestions by prejudice or by religious bigotr y. But his astral and mental bodies are far more easily impressible than the physical, and it is always ope n to us to approach these by a wave of helpful thought or o f affection and soothing feeling."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 40.  We must not forget that the law of cause and effect holds good just as certainly in finer matter as in denser and that, consequently, the energy which we pour fo rth must reach its goal and produce its effect. There c an be no question that the image or idea which we wish to put before a man for his comfort or his help will reach him; whether it will present itself clearly to his mind when it arrives, depends first upon the definiteness of out line which we have been able to give to it and, secondly , upon his mental condition at the time. He may be so fully occupied with thoughts of his own trials and suffer ings that there is little room for our idea to insert it self; but in that case our thought-form simply bides its time an d, when at last his attention is diverted or exhaustio n forces him to suspend the activity of his own train of tho ught, will assuredly slip in and do its errand of mercy. There are so many cases where the best will in the world can do nothing physically for a sufferer; but there is no conceivable case in which, in either the mental or the astral world, some relief cannot be given by steady , concentrated loving thought. 41.  The phenomena of mind-cure show how powerful thought may be even in the physical world, and, sin ce it acts so much more easily in astral and mental matte r, we may realize how tremendous the power really is, if we will but exercise it. We should watch for an opport unity of being thus helpful; there is little doubt that plen ty of cases will offer themselves. As we walk along the s treet, as we ride in a bus or a train we may often see som eone who is obviously suffering from depression or sadne ss; there is our opportunity, and we may immediately ta ke advantage of it by trying to arouse and to help him . Let us try to send him strongly the feeling that, in sp ite of his personal sorrows and troubles, the sun still shines above all and there is still much to be thankful for, muc h that is good and beautiful in the world. Sometimes we may s ee the instant effect of our effort—we may actually wa tch the man brighten up under the influence of the thou ght which we have sent to him. We cannot always expect such immediate physical results; but if we understa nd the laws of nature we shall in every case be sure t hat some results is being produced.

It is often difficult for the man who is unaccustom ed to these studies to believe that he is really affectin g those at whom his thought is aimed; but experience in a g reat number of cases has shown us that anyone who makes a practice of such efforts will in time find eviden ce of his success accumulating until it is no longer possible for him to doubt. Each man should make it part of his l ife thus to try to help all whom he knows and loves, wh ether they be what is commonly called living or what is commonly called dead; for naturally the possession or the absence of the physical body makes no differenc e whatever to the action of forces which are levelled at the mental and astral bodies. By steady regular practic e great good will be done, for we gain strength by us ing it, and so while we are developing our own powers and ensuring our progress the world will be helped by o ur kindly efforts. 43.  I remember seeing in an American book on mind- cure, a passage which illustrates exceedingly well what should be the theosophical attitude to the duties a nd associations of daily life: ‘Knead love into the br ead you bake; wrap strength and courage in the parcel which you tie for the woman with the weary face; hand trust a nd candour with the coin that you pay to the man with the suspicious eyes.’ 44.  Quaint in expression, but lovely in its thought, tr uly the theosophical concept that every connection is an opportunity, and that everyone whom we meet even casually, is a person to be helped. Thus the studen t of the Good Law goes through life distributing blessin gs on all about him, doing good unobtrusively everywhere, though often the recipients of the blessing and the help may have no idea whence it comes. Never forget that in such benefactions every man can take his share, and every man ought to take his share; all who can thin k can send out kindly, helpful thoughts, and no such thou ght has ever failed, or can ever fail while the laws of the universe hold. We may not always see the result, bu t it is there, and we know not what fruit may spring from t he tiny seed which we sow in passing along our path of peace and love. -----------------------------"}]
