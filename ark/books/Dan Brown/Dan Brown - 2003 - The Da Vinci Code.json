FACT:The Priory of Sion—a European secret society founded in 1099—is a realorganization. In 1975 Paris's Bibliothèque Nationale discovered parchments knownas Les Dossiers Secrets, identifying numerous members of the Priory of Sion,including Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Leonardo da Vinci.The Vatican prelature known as Opus Dei is a deeply devout Catholic sect thathas been the topic of recent controversy due to reports of brainwashing,coercion, and a dangerous practice known as \"corporal mortification.\" Opus Deihas just completed construction of a $47 million World Headquarters at 243Lexington Avenue in New York City.All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in thisnovel are accurate. PROLOGUELOUVRE MUSEUM, PARIS 10:46 P.M.Renowned curator Jacques Saunière staggered through the vaulted archway of themuseum's Grand Gallery. He lunged for the nearest painting he could see, aCaravaggio. Grabbing the gilded frame, the seventy-six-year-old man heaved themasterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and Saunière collapsedbackward in a heap beneath the canvas.As he had anticipated, a thundering iron gate fell nearby, barricading theentrance to the suite. The parquet floor shook. Far off, an alarm began to ring.The curator lay a moment, gasping for breath, taking stock. I am still alive. Hecrawled out from under the canvas and scanned the cavernous space for someplaceto hide.A voice spoke, chillingly close. \"Do not move.\"On his hands and knees, the curator froze, turning his head slowly.Only fifteen feet away, outside the sealed gate, the mountainous silhouette ofhis attacker stared through the iron bars. He was broad and tall, withghost-pale skin and thinning white hair. His irises were pink with dark redpupils. The albino drew a pistol from his coat and aimed the barrel through thebars, directly at the curator. \"You should not have run.\" His accent was noteasy to place. \"Now tell me where it is.\"\"I told you already,\" the curator stammered, kneeling defenseless on the floorof the gallery. \"I have no idea what you are talking about!\"\"You are lying.\" The man stared at him, perfectly immobile except for the glintin his ghostly eyes. \"You and your brethren possess something that is notyours.\"The curator felt a surge of adrenaline. How could he possibly know this?\"Tonight the rightful guardians will be restored. Tell me where it is hidden,and you will live.\" The man leveled his gun at the curator's head. \"Is it asecret you will die for?\"Saunière could not breathe.The man tilted his head, peering down the barrel of his gun.Saunière held up his hands in defense. \"Wait,\" he said slowly. \"I will tell youwhat you need to know.\" The curator spoke his next words carefully. The lie hetold was one he had rehearsed many times... each time praying he would neverhave to use it.When the curator had finished speaking, his assailant smiled smugly. \"Yes. Thisis exactly what the others told me.\"Saunière recoiled. The others?\"I found them, too,\" the huge man taunted. \"All three of them. They confirmedwhat you have just said.\"It cannot be! The curator's true identity, along with the identities of histhree sénéchaux, was almost as sacred as the ancient secret they protected.Saunière now realized his sénéchaux, following strict procedure, had told thesame lie before their own deaths. It was part of the protocol.The attacker aimed his gun again. \"When you are gone, I will be the only one whoknows the truth.\"The truth. In an instant, the curator grasped the true horror of the situation.If I die, the truth will be lost forever. Instinctively, he tried to scramblefor cover.The gun roared, and the curator felt a searing heat as the bullet lodged in hisstomach. He fell forward... struggling against the pain. Slowly, Saunière rolledover and stared back through the bars at his attacker.The man was now taking dead aim at Saunière's head.Saunière closed his eyes, his thoughts a swirling tempest of fear and regret.The click of an empty chamber echoed through the corridor.The curator's eyes flew open.The man glanced down at his weapon, looking almost amused. He reached for asecond clip, but then seemed to reconsider, smirking calmly at Saunière's gut.\"My work here is done.\"The curator looked down and saw the bullet hole in his white linen shirt. It wasframed by a small circle of blood a few inches below his breastbone. My stomach.Almost cruelly, the bullet had missed his heart. As a veteran of la Guerred'Algérie, the curator had witnessed this horribly drawn-out death before. Forfifteen minutes, he would survive as his stomach acids seeped into his chestcavity, slowly poisoning him from within.\"Pain is good, monsieur,\" the man said.Then he was gone.Alone now, Jacques Saunière turned his gaze again to the iron gate. He wastrapped, and the doors could not be reopened for at least twenty minutes. By thetime anyone got to him, he would be dead. Even so, the fear that now gripped himwas a fear far greater than that of his own death.I must pass on the secret.Staggering to his feet, he pictured his three murdered brethren. He thought ofthe generations who had come before them... of the mission with which they hadall been entrusted.An unbroken chain of knowledge.Suddenly, now, despite all the precautions... despite all the fail-safes...Jacques Saunière was the only remaining link, the sole guardian of one of themost powerful secrets ever kept.Shivering, he pulled himself to his feet.I must find some way....He was trapped inside the Grand Gallery, and there existed only one person onearth to whom he could pass the torch. Saunière gazed up at the walls of hisopulent prison. A collection of the world's most famous paintings seemed tosmile down on him like old friends.Wincing in pain, he summoned all of his faculties and strength. The desperatetask before him, he knew, would require every remaining second of his life. CHAPTER 1Robert Langdon awoke slowly.A telephone was ringing in the darkness—a tinny, unfamiliar ring. He fumbled forthe bedside lamp and turned it on. Squinting at his surroundings he saw a plushRenaissance bedroom with Louis XVI furniture, hand-frescoed walls, and acolossal mahogany four-poster bed.Where the hell am I?The jacquard bathrobe hanging on his bedpost bore the monogram: HOTEL RITZPARIS.Slowly, the fog began to lift.Langdon picked up the receiver. \"Hello?\"\"Monsieur Langdon?\" a man's voice said. \"I hope I have not awoken you?\"Dazed, Langdon looked at the bedside clock. It was 12:32 A.M. He had been asleeponly an hour, but he felt like the dead.\"This is the concierge, monsieur. I apologize for this intrusion, but you have avisitor. He insists it is urgent.\"Langdon still felt fuzzy. A visitor? His eyes focused now on a crumpled flyer onhis bedside table. THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF PARISproudly presentsAN EVENING WITH ROBERT LANGDONPROFESSOR OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLOGY,HARVARD UNIVERSITY Langdon groaned. Tonight's lecture—a slide show about pagan symbolism hidden inthe stones of Chartres Cathedral—had probably ruffled some conservative feathersin the audience. Most likely, some religious scholar had trailed him home topick a fight.\"I'm sorry,\" Langdon said, \"but I'm very tired and—\"\"Mais, monsieur,\" the concierge pressed, lowering his voice to an urgentwhisper. \"Your guest is an important man.\"Langdon had little doubt. His books on religious paintings and cult symbologyhad made him a reluctant celebrity in the art world, and last year Langdon'svisibility had increased a hundredfold after his involvement in a widelypublicized incident at the Vatican. Since then, the stream of self-importanthistorians and art buffs arriving at his door had seemed never-ending.\"If you would be so kind,\" Langdon said, doing his best to remain polite, \"couldyou take the man's name and number, and tell him I'll try to call him before Ileave Paris on Tuesday? Thank you.\" He hung up before the concierge couldprotest.Sitting up now, Langdon frowned at his bedside Guest Relations Handbook, whosecover boasted: SLEEP LIKE A BABY IN THE CITY OF LIGHTS. SLUMBER AT THE PARISRITZ. He turned and gazed tiredly into the full-length mirror across the room.The man staring back at him was a stranger—tousled and weary.You need a vacation, Robert.The past year had taken a heavy toll on him, but he didn't appreciate seeingproof in the mirror. His usually sharp blue eyes looked hazy and drawn tonight.A dark stubble was shrouding his strong jaw and dimpled chin. Around histemples, the gray highlights were advancing, making their way deeper into histhicket of coarse black hair. Although his female colleagues insisted the grayonly accentuated his bookish appeal, Langdon knew better.If Boston Magazine could see me now.Last month, much to Langdon's embarrassment, Boston Magazine had listed him asone of that city's top ten most intriguing people—a dubious honor that made himthe brunt of endless ribbing by his Harvard colleagues. Tonight, three thousandmiles from home, the accolade had resurfaced to haunt him at the lecture he hadgiven.\"Ladies and gentlemen...\" the hostess had announced to a full house at theAmerican University of Paris's Pavilion Dauphine, \"Our guest tonight needs nointroduction. He is the author of numerous books: The Symbology of Secret Sects,The An of the Illuminati, The Lost Language of Ideograms, and when I say hewrote the book on Religious Iconology, I mean that quite literally. Many of youuse his textbooks in class.\"The students in the crowd nodded enthusiastically.\"I had planned to introduce him tonight by sharing his impressive curriculumvitae. However...\" She glanced playfully at Langdon, who was seated onstage. \"Anaudience member has just handed me a far more, shall we say... intriguingintroduction.\"She held up a copy of Boston Magazine.Langdon cringed. Where the hell did she get that?The hostess began reading choice excerpts from the inane article, and Langdonfelt himself sinking lower and lower in his chair. Thirty seconds later, thecrowd was grinning, and the woman showed no signs of letting up. \"And Mr.Langdon's refusal to speak publicly about his unusual role in last year'sVatican conclave certainly wins him points on our intrigue-o-meter.\" The hostessgoaded the crowd. \"Would you like to hear more?\"The crowd applauded.Somebody stop her, Langdon pleaded as she dove into the article again.\"Although Professor Langdon might not be considered hunk-handsome like some ofour younger awardees, this forty-something academic has more than his share ofscholarly allure. His captivating presence is punctuated by an unusually low,baritone speaking voice, which his female students describe as 'chocolate forthe ears.' \"The hall erupted in laughter.Langdon forced an awkward smile. He knew what came next—some ridiculous lineabout \"Harrison Ford in Harris tweed\"—and because this evening he had figured itwas finally safe again to wear his Harris tweed and Burberry turtleneck, hedecided to take action.\"Thank you, Monique,\" Langdon said, standing prematurely and edging her awayfrom the podium. \"Boston Magazine clearly has a gift for fiction.\" He turned tothe audience with an embarrassed sigh. \"And if I find which one of you providedthat article, I'll have the consulate deport you.\"The crowd laughed.\"Well, folks, as you all know, I'm here tonight to talk about the power ofsymbols...\" The ringing of Langdon's hotel phone once again broke the silence.Groaning in disbelief, he picked up. \"Yes?\"As expected, it was the concierge. \"Mr. Langdon, again my apologies. I amcalling to inform you that your guest is now en route to your room. I thought Ishould alert you.\"Langdon was wide awake now. \"You sent someone to my room?\"\"I apologize, monsieur, but a man like this... I cannot presume the authority tostop him.\"\"Who exactly is he?\"But the concierge was gone.Almost immediately, a heavy fist pounded on Langdon's door.Uncertain, Langdon slid off the bed, feeling his toes sink deep into thesavonniere carpet. He donned the hotel bathrobe and moved toward the door. \"Whois it?\"\"Mr. Langdon? I need to speak with you.\" The man's English was accented—a sharp,authoritative bark. \"My name is Lieutenant Jerome Collet. Direction CentralePolice Judiciaire.\"Langdon paused. The Judicial Police? The DCPJ was the rough equivalent of theU.S. FBI.Leaving the security chain in place, Langdon opened the door a few inches. Theface staring back at him was thin and washed out. The man was exceptionallylean, dressed in an official-looking blue uniform.\"May I come in?\" the agent asked.Langdon hesitated, feeling uncertain as the stranger's sallow eyes studied him.\"What is this all about?\"\"My capitaine requires your expertise in a private matter.\"\"Now?\" Langdon managed. \"It's after midnight.\"\"Am I correct that you were scheduled to meet with the curator of the Louvrethis evening?\"Langdon felt a sudden surge of uneasiness. He and the revered curator JacquesSaunière had been slated to meet for drinks after Langdon's lecture tonight, butSaunière had never shown up. \"Yes. How did you know that?\"\"We found your name in his daily planner.\"\"I trust nothing is wrong?\"The agent gave a dire sigh and slid a Polaroid snapshot through the narrowopening in the door.When Langdon saw the photo, his entire body went rigid.\"This photo was taken less than an hour ago. Inside the Louvre.\"As Langdon stared at the bizarre image, his initial revulsion and shock gave wayto a sudden upwelling of anger. \"Who would do this!\"\"We had hoped that you might help us answer that very question, considering yourknowledge in symbology and your plans to meet with him.\"Langdon stared at the picture, his horror now laced with fear. The image wasgruesome and profoundly strange, bringing with it an unsettling sense of déjàvu. A little over a year ago, Langdon had received a photograph of a corpse anda similar request for help. Twenty-four hours later, he had almost lost his lifeinside Vatican City. This photo was entirely different, and yet something aboutthe scenario felt disquietingly familiar.The agent checked his watch. \"My capitaine is waiting, sir.\"Langdon barely heard him. His eyes were still riveted on the picture. \"Thissymbol here, and the way his body is so oddly...\"\"Positioned?\" the agent offered.Langdon nodded, feeling a chill as he looked up. \"I can't imagine who would dothis to someone.\"The agent looked grim. \"You don't understand, Mr. Langdon. What you see in thisphotograph...\" He paused. \"Monsieur Saunière did that to himself.\" CHAPTER 2One mile away, the hulking albino named Silas limped through the front gate ofthe luxurious brownstone residence on Rue La Bruyère. The spiked cilice beltthat he wore around his thigh cut into his flesh, and yet his soul sang withsatisfaction of service to the Lord.Pain is good.His red eyes scanned the lobby as he entered the residence. Empty. He climbedthe stairs quietly, not wanting to awaken any of his fellow numeraries. Hisbedroom door was open; locks were forbidden here. He entered, closing the doorbehind him.The room was spartan—hardwood floors, a pine dresser, a canvas mat in the cornerthat served as his bed. He was a visitor here this week, and yet for many yearshe had been blessed with a similar sanctuary in New York City.The Lord has provided me shelter and purpose in my life.Tonight, at last, Silas felt he had begun to repay his debt. Hurrying to thedresser, he found the cell phone hidden in his bottom drawer and placed a call.\"Yes?\" a male voice answered.\"Teacher, I have returned.\"\"Speak,\" the voice commanded, sounding pleased to hear from him.\"All four are gone. The three sénéchaux... and the Grand Master himself.\"There was a momentary pause, as if for prayer. \"Then I assume you have theinformation?\"\"All four concurred. Independently.\"\"And you believed them?\"\"Their agreement was too great for coincidence.\"An excited breath. \"Excellent. I had feared the brotherhood's reputation forsecrecy might prevail.\"\"The prospect of death is strong motivation.\"\"So, my pupil, tell me what I must know.\"Silas knew the information he had gleaned from his victims would come as ashock. \"Teacher, all four confirmed the existence of the clef de voûte... thelegendary keystone.\"He heard a quick intake of breath over the phone and could feel the Teacher'sexcitement. \"The keystone. Exactly as we suspected.\"According to lore, the brotherhood had created a map of stone—a clef de voûte...or keystone—an engraved tablet that revealed the final resting place of thebrotherhood's greatest secret... information so powerful that its protection wasthe reason for the brotherhood's very existence.\"When we possess the keystone,\" the Teacher said, \"we will be only one stepaway.\"\"We are closer than you think. The keystone is here in Paris.\"\"Paris? Incredible. It is almost too easy.\"Silas relayed the earlier events of the evening... how all four of his victims,moments before death, had desperately tried to buy back their godless lives bytelling their secret. Each had told Silas the exact same thing—that the keystonewas ingeniously hidden at a precise location inside one of Paris's ancientchurches—the Eglise de Saint-Sulpice.\"Inside a house of the Lord,\" the Teacher exclaimed. \"How they mock us!\"\"As they have for centuries.\"The Teacher fell silent, as if letting the triumph of this moment settle overhim. Finally, he spoke. \"You have done a great service to God. We have waitedcenturies for this. You must retrieve the stone for me. Immediately. Tonight.You understand the stakes.\"Silas knew the stakes were incalculable, and yet what the Teacher was nowcommanding seemed impossible. \"But the church, it is a fortress. Especially atnight. How will I enter?\"With the confident tone of a man of enormous influence, the Teacher explainedwhat was to be done. When Silas hung up the phone, his skin tingled with anticipation.One hour, he told himself, grateful that the Teacher had given him time to carryout the necessary penance before entering a house of God. I must purge my soulof today's sins. The sins committed today had been holy in purpose. Acts of waragainst the enemies of God had been committed for centuries. Forgiveness wasassured.Even so, Silas knew, absolution required sacrifice.Pulling his shades, he stripped naked and knelt in the center of his room.Looking down, he examined the spiked cilice belt clamped around his thigh. Alltrue followers of The Way wore this device—a leather strap, studded with sharpmetal barbs that cut into the flesh as a perpetual reminder of Christ'ssuffering. The pain caused by the device also helped counteract the desires ofthe flesh.Although Silas already had worn his cilice today longer than the requisite twohours, he knew today was no ordinary day. Grasping the buckle, he cinched it onenotch tighter, wincing as the barbs dug deeper into his flesh. Exhaling slowly,he savored the cleansing ritual of his pain.Pain is good, Silas whispered, repeating the sacred mantra of Father JosemaríaEscrivá—the Teacher of all Teachers. Although Escrivá had died in 1975, hiswisdom lived on, his words still whispered by thousands of faithful servantsaround the globe as they knelt on the floor and performed the sacred practiceknown as \"corporal mortification.\"Silas turned his attention now to a heavy knotted rope coiled neatly on thefloor beside him. The Discipline. The knots were caked with dried blood. Eagerfor the purifying effects of his own agony, Silas said a quick prayer. Then,gripping one end of the rope, he closed his eyes and swung it hard over hisshoulder, feeling the knots slap against his back. He whipped it over hisshoulder again, slashing at his flesh. Again and again, he lashed.Castigo corpus meum.Finally, he felt the blood begin to flow. CHAPTER 3The crisp April air whipped through the open window of the Citroën ZX as itskimmed south past the Opera House and crossed Place Vendôme. In the passengerseat, Robert Langdon felt the city tear past him as he tried to clear histhoughts. His quick shower and shave had left him looking reasonably presentablebut had done little to ease his anxiety. The frightening image of the curator'sbody remained locked in his mind.Jacques Saunière is dead.Langdon could not help but feel a deep sense of loss at the curator's death.Despite Saunière's reputation for being reclusive, his recognition fordedication to the arts made him an easy man to revere. His books on the secretcodes hidden in the paintings of Poussin and Teniers were some of Langdon'sfavorite classroom texts. Tonight's meeting had been one Langdon was very muchlooking forward to, and he was disappointed when the curator had not shown.Again the image of the curator's body flashed in his mind. Jacques Saunière didthat to himself? Langdon turned and looked out the window, forcing the picturefrom his mind.Outside, the city was just now winding down—street vendors wheeling carts ofcandied amandes, waiters carrying bags of garbage to the curb, a pair of latenight lovers cuddling to stay warm in a breeze scented with jasmine blossom. TheCitroën navigated the chaos with authority, its dissonant two-tone siren partingthe traffic like a knife.\"Le capitaine was pleased to discover you were still in Paris tonight,\" theagent said, speaking for the first time since they'd left the hotel. \"Afortunate coincidence.\"Langdon was feeling anything but fortunate, and coincidence was a concept he didnot entirely trust. As someone who had spent his life exploring the hiddeninterconnectivity of disparate emblems and ideologies, Langdon viewed the worldas a web of profoundly intertwined histories and events. The connections may beinvisible, he often preached to his symbology classes at Harvard, but they arealways there, buried just beneath the surface.\"I assume,\" Langdon said, \"that the American University of Paris told you whereI was staying?\"The driver shook his head. \"Interpol.\"Interpol, Langdon thought. Of course. He had forgotten that the seeminglyinnocuous request of all European hotels to see a passport at check-in was morethan a quaint formality—it was the law. On any given night, all across Europe,Interpol officials could pinpoint exactly who was sleeping where. FindingLangdon at the Ritz had probably taken all of five seconds.As the Citroën accelerated southward across the city, the illuminated profile ofthe Eiffel Tower appeared, shooting skyward in the distance to the right. Seeingit, Langdon thought of Vittoria, recalling their playful promise a year ago thatevery six months they would meet again at a different romantic spot on theglobe. The Eiffel Tower, Langdon suspected, would have made their list. Sadly,he last kissed Vittoria in a noisy airport in Rome more than a year ago.\"Did you mount her?\" the agent asked, looking over.Langdon glanced up, certain he had misunderstood. \"I beg your pardon?\"\"She is lovely, no?\" The agent motioned through the windshield toward the EiffelTower. \"Have you mounted her?\"Langdon rolled his eyes. \"No, I haven't climbed the tower.\"\"She is the symbol of France. I think she is perfect.\"Langdon nodded absently. Symbologists often remarked that France—a countryrenowned for machismo, womanizing, and diminutive insecure leaders like Napoleonand Pepin the Short—could not have chosen a more apt national emblem than athousand-foot phallus.When they reached the intersection at Rue de Rivoli, the traffic light was red,but the Citroën didn't slow. The agent gunned the sedan across the junction andsped onto a wooded section of Rue Castiglione, which served as the northernentrance to the famed Tuileries Gardens—Paris's own version of Central Park.Most tourists mistranslated Jardins des Tuileries as relating to the thousandsof tulips that bloomed here, but Tuileries was actually a literal reference tosomething far less romantic. This park had once been an enormous, pollutedexcavation pit from which Parisian contractors mined clay to manufacture thecity's famous red roofing tiles—or tuiles.As they entered the deserted park, the agent reached under the dash and turnedoff the blaring siren. Langdon exhaled, savoring the sudden quiet. Outside thecar, the pale wash of halogen headlights skimmed over the crushed gravelparkway, the rugged whir of the tires intoning a hypnotic rhythm. Langdon hadalways considered the Tuileries to be sacred ground. These were the gardens inwhich Claude Monet had experimented with form and color, and literally inspiredthe birth of the Impressionist movement. Tonight, however, this place held astrange aura of foreboding.The Citroën swerved left now, angling west down the park's central boulevard.Curling around a circular pond, the driver cut across a desolate avenue out intoa wide quadrangle beyond. Langdon could now see the end of the TuileriesGardens, marked by a giant stone archway.Arc du Carrousel.Despite the orgiastic rituals once held at the Arc du Carrousel, art aficionadosrevered this place for another reason entirely. From the esplanade at the end ofthe Tuileries, four of the finest art museums in the world could be seen... oneat each point of the compass.Out the right-hand window, south across the Seine and Quai Voltaire, Langdoncould see the dramatically lit facade of the old train station—now the esteemedMusée d'Orsay. Glancing left, he could make out the top of the ultramodernPompidou Center, which housed the Museum of Modern Art. Behind him to the west,Langdon knew the ancient obelisk of Ramses rose above the trees, marking theMusée du Jeu de Paume.But it was straight ahead, to the east, through the archway, that Langdon couldnow see the monolithic Renaissance palace that had become the most famous artmuseum in the world.Musée du Louvre.Langdon felt a familiar tinge of wonder as his eyes made a futile attempt toabsorb the entire mass of the edifice. Across a staggeringly expansive plaza,the imposing facade of the Louvre rose like a citadel against the Paris sky.Shaped like an enormous horseshoe, the Louvre was the longest building inEurope, stretching farther than three Eiffel Towers laid end to end. Not eventhe million square feet of open plaza between the museum wings could challengethe majesty of the facade's breadth. Langdon had once walked the Louvre's entireperimeter, an astonishing three-mile journey.Despite the estimated five days it would take a visitor to properly appreciatethe 65,300 pieces of art in this building, most tourists chose an abbreviatedexperience Langdon referred to as \"Louvre Lite\"—a full sprint through the museumto see the three most famous objects: the Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo, and WingedVictory. Art Buchwald had once boasted he'd seen all three masterpieces in fiveminutes and fifty-six seconds.The driver pulled out a handheld walkie-talkie and spoke in rapid-fire French.\"Monsieur Langdon est arrivé. Deux minutes.\"An indecipherable confirmation came crackling back.The agent stowed the device, turning now to Langdon. \"You will meet thecapitaine at the main entrance.\"The driver ignored the signs prohibiting auto traffic on the plaza, revved theengine, and gunned the Citroën up over the curb. The Louvre's main entrance wasvisible now, rising boldly in the distance, encircled by seven triangular poolsfrom which spouted illuminated fountains.La Pyramide.The new entrance to the Paris Louvre had become almost as famous as the museumitself. The controversial, neomodern glass pyramid designed by Chinese-bornAmerican architect I. M. Pei still evoked scorn from traditionalists who felt itdestroyed the dignity of the Renaissance courtyard. Goethe had describedarchitecture as frozen music, and Pei's critics described this pyramid asfingernails on a chalkboard. Progressive admirers, though, hailed Pei'sseventy-one-foot-tall transparent pyramid as a dazzling synergy of ancientstructure and modern method—a symbolic link between the old and new—helpingusher the Louvre into the next millennium.\"Do you like our pyramid?\" the agent asked.Langdon frowned. The French, it seemed, loved to ask Americans this. It was aloaded question, of course. Admitting you liked the pyramid made you a tastelessAmerican, and expressing dislike was an insult to the French.\"Mitterrand was a bold man,\" Langdon replied, splitting the difference. The lateFrench president who had commissioned the pyramid was said to have suffered froma \"Pharaoh complex.\" Singlehandedly responsible for filling Paris with Egyptianobelisks, art, and artifacts.François Mitterrand had an affinity for Egyptian culture that was soall-consuming that the French still referred to him as the Sphinx.\"What is the captain's name?\" Langdon asked, changing topics.\"Bezu Fache,\" the driver said, approaching the pyramid's main entrance. \"We callhim le Taureau.\"Langdon glanced over at him, wondering if every Frenchman had a mysteriousanimal epithet. \"You call your captain the Bull?\"The man arched his eyebrows. \"Your French is better than you admit, MonsieurLangdon.\"My French stinks, Langdon thought, but my zodiac iconography is pretty good.Taurus was always the bull. Astrology was a symbolic constant all over theworld.The agent pulled the car to a stop and pointed between two fountains to a largedoor in the side of the pyramid. \"There is the entrance. Good luck, monsieur.\"\"You're not coming?\"\"My orders are to leave you here. I have other business to attend to.\"Langdon heaved a sigh and climbed out. It's your circus.The agent revved his engine and sped off.As Langdon stood alone and watched the departing taillights, he realized hecould easily reconsider, exit the courtyard, grab a taxi, and head home to bed.Something told him it was probably a lousy idea.As he moved toward the mist of the fountains, Langdon had the uneasy sense hewas crossing an imaginary threshold into another world. The dreamlike quality ofthe evening was settling around him again. Twenty minutes ago he had been asleepin his hotel room. Now he was standing in front of a transparent pyramid builtby the Sphinx, waiting for a policeman they called the Bull.I'm trapped in a Salvador Dali painting, he thought.Langdon strode to the main entrance—an enormous revolving door. The foyer beyondwas dimly lit and deserted.Do I knock?Langdon wondered if any of Harvard's revered Egyptologists had ever knocked onthe front door of a pyramid and expected an answer. He raised his hand to bangon the glass, but out of the darkness below, a figure appeared, striding up thecurving staircase. The man was stocky and dark, almost Neanderthal, dressed in adark double-breasted suit that strained to cover his wide shoulders. He advancedwith unmistakable authority on squat, powerful legs. He was speaking on his cellphone but finished the call as he arrived. He motioned for Langdon to enter.\"I am Bezu Fache,\" he announced as Langdon pushed through the revolving door.\"Captain of the Central Directorate Judicial Police.\" His tone was fitting—aguttural rumble... like a gathering storm.Langdon held out his hand to shake. \"Robert Langdon.\"Fache's enormous palm wrapped around Langdon's with crushing force.\"I saw the photo,\" Langdon said. \"Your agent said Jacques Saunière himself did—\"\"Mr. Langdon,\" Fache's ebony eyes locked on. \"What you see in the photo is onlythe beginning of what Saunière did.\" CHAPTER 4Captain Bezu Fache carried himself like an angry ox, with his wide shouldersthrown back and his chin tucked hard into his chest. His dark hair was slickedback with oil, accentuating an arrow-like widow's peak that divided his juttingbrow and preceded him like the prow of a battleship. As he advanced, his darkeyes seemed to scorch the earth before him, radiating a fiery clarity thatforecast his reputation for unblinking severity in all matters.Langdon followed the captain down the famous marble staircase into the sunkenatrium beneath the glass pyramid. As they descended, they passed between twoarmed Judicial Police guards with machine guns. The message was clear: Nobodygoes in or out tonight without the blessing of Captain Fache.Descending below ground level, Langdon fought a rising trepidation. Fache'spresence was anything but welcoming, and the Louvre itself had an almostsepulchral aura at this hour. The staircase, like the aisle of a dark movietheater, was illuminated by subtle tread-lighting embedded in each step. Langdoncould hear his own footsteps reverberating off the glass overhead. As he glancedup, he could see the faint illuminated wisps of mist from the fountains fadingaway outside the transparent roof.\"Do you approve?\" Fache asked, nodding upward with his broad chin.Langdon sighed, too tired to play games. \"Yes, your pyramid is magnificent.\"Fache grunted. \"A scar on the face of Paris.\"Strike one. Langdon sensed his host was a hard man to please. He wondered ifFache had any idea that this pyramid, at President Mitterrand's explicit demand,had been constructed of exactly 666 panes of glass—a bizarre request that hadalways been a hot topic among conspiracy buffs who claimed 666 was the number ofSatan.Langdon decided not to bring it up.As they dropped farther into the subterranean foyer, the yawning space slowlyemerged from the shadows. Built fifty-seven feet beneath ground level, theLouvre's newly constructed 70,000-square-foot lobby spread out like an endlessgrotto. Constructed in warm ocher marble to be compatible with the honey-coloredstone of the Louvre facade above, the subterranean hall was usually vibrant withsunlight and tourists. Tonight, however, the lobby was barren and dark, givingthe entire space a cold and crypt-like atmosphere.\"And the museum's regular security staff?\" Langdon asked.\"En quarantaine,\" Fache replied, sounding as if Langdon were questioning theintegrity of Fache's team. \"Obviously, someone gained entry tonight who shouldnot have. All Louvre night wardens are in the Sully Wing being questioned. Myown agents have taken over museum security for the evening.\"Langdon nodded, moving quickly to keep pace with Fache.\"How well did you know Jacques Saunière?\" the captain asked.\"Actually, not at all. We'd never met.\"Fache looked surprised. \"Your first meeting was to be tonight?\"\"Yes. We'd planned to meet at the American University reception following mylecture, but he never showed up.\"Fache scribbled some notes in a little book. As they walked, Langdon caught aglimpse of the Louvre's lesser-known pyramid—La Pyramide Inversée—a hugeinverted skylight that hung from the ceiling like a stalactite in an adjoiningsection of the entresol. Fache guided Langdon up a short set of stairs to themouth of an arched tunnel, over which a sign read: DENON. The Denon Wing was themost famous of the Louvre's three main sections.\"Who requested tonight's meeting?\" Fache asked suddenly. \"You or he?\"The question seemed odd. \"Mr. Saunière did,\" Langdon replied as they entered thetunnel. \"His secretary contacted me a few weeks ago via e-mail. She said thecurator had heard I would be lecturing in Paris this month and wanted to discusssomething with me while I was here.\"\"Discuss what?\"\"I don't know. Art, I imagine. We share similar interests.\"Fache looked skeptical. \"You have no idea what your meeting was about?\"Langdon did not. He'd been curious at the time but had not felt comfortabledemanding specifics. The venerated Jacques Saunière had a renowned penchant forprivacy and granted very few meetings; Langdon was grateful simply for theopportunity to meet him.\"Mr. Langdon, can you at least guess what our murder victim might have wanted todiscuss with you on the night he was killed? It might be helpful.\"The pointedness of the question made Langdon uncomfortable. \"I really can'timagine. I didn't ask. I felt honored to have been contacted at all. I'm anadmirer of Mr. Saunière's work. I use his texts often in my classes.\"Fache made note of that fact in his book.The two men were now halfway up the Denon Wing's entry tunnel, and Langdon couldsee the twin ascending escalators at the far end, both motionless.\"So you shared interests with him?\" Fache asked.\"Yes. In fact, I've spent much of the last year writing the draft for a bookthat deals with Mr. Saunière's primary area of expertise. I was looking forwardto picking his brain.\"Fache glanced up. \"Pardon?\"The idiom apparently didn't translate. \"I was looking forward to learning histhoughts on the topic.\"\"I see. And what is the topic?\"Langdon hesitated, uncertain exactly how to put it. \"Essentially, the manuscriptis about the iconography of goddess worship—the concept of female sanctity andthe art and symbols associated with it.\"Fache ran a meaty hand across his hair. \"And Saunière was knowledgeable aboutthis?\"\"Nobody more so.\"\"I see.\"Langdon sensed Fache did not see at all. Jacques Saunière was considered thepremiere goddess iconographer on earth. Not only did Saunière have a personalpassion for relics relating to fertility, goddess cults, Wicca, and the sacredfeminine, but during his twenty-year tenure as curator, Saunière had helped theLouvre amass the largest collection of goddess art on earth—labrys axes from thepriestesses' oldest Greek shrine in Delphi, gold caducei wands, hundreds of Tjetankhs resembling small standing angels, sistrum rattles used in ancient Egypt todispel evil spirits, and an astonishing array of statues depicting Horus beingnursed by the goddess Isis.\"Perhaps Jacques Saunière knew of your manuscript?\" Fache offered. \"And hecalled the meeting to offer his help on your book.\"Langdon shook his head. \"Actually, nobody yet knows about my manuscript. It'sstill in draft form, and I haven't shown it to anyone except my editor.\"Fache fell silent.Langdon did not add the reason he hadn't yet shown the manuscript to anyoneelse. The three-hundred-page draft—tentatively titled Symbols of the Lost SacredFeminine—proposed some very unconventional interpretations of establishedreligious iconography which would certainly be controversial.Now, as Langdon approached the stationary escalators, he paused, realizing Fachewas no longer beside him. Turning, Langdon saw Fache standing several yards backat a service elevator.\"We'll take the elevator,\" Fache said as the lift doors opened. \"As I'm sureyou're aware, the gallery is quite a distance on foot.\"Although Langdon knew the elevator would expedite the long, two-story climb tothe Denon Wing, he remained motionless.\"Is something wrong?\" Fache was holding the door, looking impatient.Langdon exhaled, turning a longing glance back up the open-air escalator.Nothing's wrong at all, he lied to himself, trudging back toward the elevator.As a boy, Langdon had fallen down an abandoned well shaft and almost diedtreading water in the narrow space for hours before being rescued. Since then,he'd suffered a haunting phobia of enclosed spaces—elevators, subways, squashcourts. The elevator is a perfectly safe machine, Langdon continually toldhimself, never believing it. It's a tiny metal box hanging in an enclosed shaft!Holding his breath, he stepped into the lift, feeling the familiar tingle ofadrenaline as the doors slid shut. Two floors. Ten seconds.\"You and Mr. Saunière,\" Fache said as the lift began to move, \"you never spokeat all? Never corresponded? Never sent each other anything in the mail?\"Another odd question. Langdon shook his head. \"No. Never.\" Fache cocked hishead, as if making a mental note of that fact. Saying nothing, he stared deadahead at the chrome doors.As they ascended, Langdon tried to focus on anything other than the four wallsaround him. In the reflection of the shiny elevator door, he saw the captain'stie clip—a silver crucifix with thirteen embedded pieces of black onyx. Langdonfound it vaguely surprising. The symbol was known as a crux gemmata—a crossbearing thirteen gems—a Christian ideogram for Christ and His twelve apostles.Somehow Langdon had not expected the captain of the French police to broadcasthis religion so openly. Then again, this was France; Christianity was not areligion here so much as a birthright.\"It's a crux gemmata\" Fache said suddenly.Startled, Langdon glanced up to find Fache's eyes on him in the reflection.The elevator jolted to a stop, and the doors opened.Langdon stepped quickly out into the hallway, eager for the wide-open spaceafforded by the famous high ceilings of the Louvre galleries. The world intowhich he stepped, however, was nothing like he expected.Surprised, Langdon stopped short.Fache glanced over. \"I gather, Mr. Langdon, you have never seen the Louvre afterhours?\"I guess not, Langdon thought, trying to get his bearings.Usually impeccably illuminated, the Louvre galleries were startlingly darktonight. Instead of the customary flat-white light flowing down from above, amuted red glow seemed to emanate upward from the baseboards—intermittent patchesof red light spilling out onto the tile floors.As Langdon gazed down the murky corridor, he realized he should have anticipatedthis scene. Virtually all major galleries employed red service lighting atnight—strategically placed, low-level, noninvasive lights that enabled staffmembers to navigate hallways and yet kept the paintings in relative darkness toslow the fading effects of overexposure to light. Tonight, the museum possessedan almost oppressive quality. Long shadows encroached everywhere, and theusually soaring vaulted ceilings appeared as a low, black void.\"This way,\" Fache said, turning sharply right and setting out through a seriesof interconnected galleries.Langdon followed, his vision slowly adjusting to the dark. All around,large-format oils began to materialize like photos developing before him in anenormous darkroom... their eyes following as he moved through the rooms. Hecould taste the familiar tang of museum air—an arid, deionized essence thatcarried a faint hint of carbon—the product of industrial, coal-filterdehumidifiers that ran around the clock to counteract the corrosive carbondioxide exhaled by visitors.Mounted high on the walls, the visible security cameras sent a clear message tovisitors: We see you. Do not touch anything.\"Any of them real?\" Langdon asked, motioning to the cameras.Fache shook his head. \"Of course not.\"Langdon was not surprised. Video surveillance in museums this size wascost-prohibitive and ineffective. With acres of galleries to watch over, theLouvre would require several hundred technicians simply to monitor the feeds.Most large museums now used \"containment security.\" Forget keeping thieves out.Keep them in. Containment was activated after hours, and if an intruder removeda piece of artwork, compartmentalized exits would seal around that gallery, andthe thief would find himself behind bars even before the police arrived.The sound of voices echoed down the marble corridor up ahead. The noise seemedto be coming from a large recessed alcove that lay ahead on the right. A brightlight spilled out into the hallway.\"Office of the curator,\" the captain said.As he and Fache drew nearer the alcove, Langdon peered down a short hallway,into Saunière's luxurious study—warm wood, Old Master paintings, and an enormousantique desk on which stood a two-foot-tall model of a knight in full armor. Ahandful of police agents bustled about the room, talking on phones and takingnotes. One of them was seated at Saunière's desk, typing into a laptop.Apparently, the curator's private office had become DCPJ's makeshift commandpost for the evening.\"Messieurs,\" Fache called out, and the men turned. \"Ne nous dérangez pas sousaucun prétexte. Entendu?\"Everyone inside the office nodded their understanding.Langdon had hung enough NE PAS DERANGER signs on hotel room doors to catch thegist of the captain's orders. Fache and Langdon were not to be disturbed underany circumstances.Leaving the small congregation of agents behind, Fache led Langdon farther downthe darkened hallway. Thirty yards ahead loomed the gateway to the Louvre's mostpopular section—la Grande Galerie—a seemingly endless corridor that housed theLouvre's most valuable Italian masterpieces. Langdon had already discerned thatthis was where Saunière's body lay; the Grand Gallery's famous parquet floor hadbeen unmistakable in the Polaroid.As they approached, Langdon saw the entrance was blocked by an enormous steelgrate that looked like something used by medieval castles to keep out maraudingarmies.\"Containment security,\" Fache said, as they neared the grate.Even in the darkness, the barricade looked like it could have restrained a tank.Arriving outside, Langdon peered through the bars into the dimly lit caverns ofthe Grand Gallery.\"After you, Mr. Langdon,\" Fache said.Langdon turned. After me, where?Fache motioned toward the floor at the base of the grate.Langdon looked down. In the darkness, he hadn't noticed. The barricade wasraised about two feet, providing an awkward clearance underneath.\"This area is still off limits to Louvre security,\" Fache said. \"My team fromPolice Technique et Scientifique has just finished their investigation.\" Hemotioned to the opening. \"Please slide under.\"Langdon stared at the narrow crawl space at his feet and then up at the massiveiron grate. He's kidding, right? The barricade looked like a guillotine waitingto crush intruders.Fache grumbled something in French and checked his watch. Then he dropped to hisknees and slithered his bulky frame underneath the grate. On the other side, hestood up and looked back through the bars at Langdon.Langdon sighed. Placing his palms flat on the polished parquet, he lay on hisstomach and pulled himself forward. As he slid underneath, the nape of hisHarris tweed snagged on the bottom of the grate, and he cracked the back of hishead on the iron.Very suave, Robert, he thought, fumbling and then finally pulling himselfthrough. As he stood up, Langdon was beginning to suspect it was going to be avery long night. CHAPTER 5Murray Hill Place—the new Opus Dei World Headquarters and conference center—islocated at 243 Lexington Avenue in New York City. With a price tag of just over$47 million, the 133,000-square-foot tower is clad in red brick and Indianalimestone. Designed by May & Pinska, the building contains over one hundredbedrooms, six dining rooms, libraries, living rooms, meeting rooms, and offices.The second, eighth, and sixteenth floors contain chapels, ornamented withmill-work and marble. The seventeenth floor is entirely residential. Men enterthe building through the main doors on Lexington Avenue. Women enter through aside street and are \"acoustically and visually separated\" from the men at alltimes within the building.Earlier this evening, within the sanctuary of his penthouse apartment, BishopManuel Aringarosa had packed a small travel bag and dressed in a traditionalblack cassock. Normally, he would have wrapped a purple cincture around hiswaist, but tonight he would be traveling among the public, and he preferred notto draw attention to his high office. Only those with a keen eye would noticehis 14-karat gold bishop's ring with purple amethyst, large diamonds, andhand-tooled mitre-crozier appliqué. Throwing the travel bag over his shoulder,he said a silent prayer and left his apartment, descending to the lobby wherehis driver was waiting to take him to the airport.Now, sitting aboard a commercial airliner bound for Rome, Aringarosa gazed outthe window at the dark Atlantic. The sun had already set, but Aringarosa knewhis own star was on the rise. Tonight the battle will be won, he thought, amazedthat only months ago he had felt powerless against the hands that threatened todestroy his empire.As president-general of Opus Dei, Bishop Aringarosa had spent the last decade ofhis life spreading the message of \"God's Work\"—literally, Opus Dei. Thecongregation, founded in 1928 by the Spanish priest Josemaría Escrivá, promoteda return to conservative Catholic values and encouraged its members to makesweeping sacrifices in their own lives in order to do the Work of God.Opus Dei's traditionalist philosophy initially had taken root in Spain beforeFranco's regime, but with the 1934 publication of Josemaría Escrivá's spiritualbook The Way—999 points of meditation for doing God's Work in one's ownlife—Escrivá's message exploded across the world. Now, with over four millioncopies of The Way in circulation in forty-two languages, Opus Dei was a globalforce. Its residence halls, teaching centers, and even universities could befound in almost every major metropolis on earth. Opus Dei was thefastest-growing and most financially secure Catholic organization in the world.Unfortunately, Aringarosa had learned, in an age of religious cynicism, cults,and televangelists, Opus Dei's escalating wealth and power was a magnet forsuspicion.\"Many call Opus Dei a brainwashing cult,\" reporters often challenged. \"Otherscall you an ultraconservative Christian secret society. Which are you?\"\"Opus Dei is neither,\" the bishop would patiently reply. \"We are a CatholicChurch. We are a congregation of Catholics who have chosen as our priority tofollow Catholic doctrine as rigorously as we can in our own daily lives.\"\"Does God's Work necessarily include vows of chastity, tithing, and atonementfor sins through self-flagellation and the cilice?\"\"You are describing only a small portion of the Opus Dei population,\" Aringarosasaid. \"There are many levels of involvement. Thousands of Opus Dei members aremarried, have families, and do God's Work in their own communities. Otherschoose lives of asceticism within our cloistered residence halls. These choicesare personal, but everyone in Opus Dei shares the goal of bettering the world bydoing the Work of God. Surely this is an admirable quest.\"Reason seldom worked, though. The media always gravitated toward scandal, andOpus Dei, like most large organizations, had within its membership a fewmisguided souls who cast a shadow over the entire group.Two months ago, an Opus Dei group at a midwestern university had been caughtdrugging new recruits with mescaline in an effort to induce a euphoric statethat neophytes would perceive as a religious experience. Another universitystudent had used his barbed cilice belt more often than the recommended twohours a day and had given himself a near lethal infection. In Boston not longago, a disillusioned young investment banker had signed over his entire lifesavings to Opus Dei before attempting suicide.Misguided sheep, Aringarosa thought, his heart going out to them.Of course the ultimate embarrassment had been the widely publicized trial of FBIspy Robert Hanssen, who, in addition to being a prominent member of Opus Dei,had turned out to be a sexual deviant, his trial uncovering evidence that he hadrigged hidden video cameras in his own bedroom so his friends could watch himhaving sex with his wife. \"Hardly the pastime of a devout Catholic,\" the judgehad noted.Sadly, all of these events had helped spawn the new watch group known as theOpus Dei Awareness Network (ODAN). The group's popularwebsite—www.odan.org—relayed frightening stories from former Opus Dei memberswho warned of the dangers of joining. The media was now referring to Opus Dei as\"God's Mafia\" and \"the Cult of Christ.\"We fear what we do not understand, Aringarosa thought, wondering if thesecritics had any idea how many lives Opus Dei had enriched. The group enjoyed thefull endorsement and blessing of the Vatican. Opus Dei is a personal prelatureof the Pope himself.Recently, however, Opus Dei had found itself threatened by a force infinitelymore powerful than the media... an unexpected foe from which Aringarosa couldnot possibly hide. Five months ago, the kaleidoscope of power had been shaken,and Aringarosa was still reeling from the blow.\"They know not the war they have begun,\" Aringarosa whispered to himself,staring out the plane's window at the darkness of the ocean below. For aninstant, his eyes refocused, lingering on the reflection of his awkwardface—dark and oblong, dominated by a flat, crooked nose that had been shatteredby a fist in Spain when he was a young missionary. The physical flaw barelyregistered now. Aringarosa's was a world of the soul, not of the flesh.As the jet passed over the coast of Portugal, the cell phone in Aringarosa'scassock began vibrating in silent ring mode. Despite airline regulationsprohibiting the use of cell phones during flights, Aringarosa knew this was acall he could not miss. Only one man possessed this number, the man who hadmailed Aringarosa the phone.Excited, the bishop answered quietly. \"Yes?\"\"Silas has located the keystone,\" the caller said. \"It is in Paris. Within theChurch of Saint-Sulpice.\"Bishop Aringarosa smiled. \"Then we are close.\"\"We can obtain it immediately. But we need your influence.\"\"Of course. Tell me what to do.\"When Aringarosa switched off the phone, his heart was pounding. He gazed onceagain into the void of night, feeling dwarfed by the events he had put intomotion. Five hundred miles away, the albino named Silas stood over a small basin ofwater and dabbed the blood from his back, watching the patterns of red spinningin the water. Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean, he prayed, quotingPsalms. Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.Silas was feeling an aroused anticipation that he had not felt since hisprevious life. It both surprised and electrified him. For the last decade, hehad been following The Way, cleansing himself of sins... rebuilding his life...erasing the violence in his past. Tonight, however, it had all come rushingback. The hatred he had fought so hard to bury had been summoned. He had beenstartled how quickly his past had resurfaced. And with it, of course, had comehis skills. Rusty but serviceable.Jesus' message is one of peace... of nonviolence... of love. This was themessage Silas had been taught from the beginning, and the message he held in hisheart. And yet this was the message the enemies of Christ now threatened todestroy. Those who threaten God with force will be met with force. Immovable andsteadfast.For two millennia, Christian soldiers had defended their faith against those whotried to displace it. Tonight, Silas had been called to battle.Drying his wounds, he donned his ankle-length, hooded robe. It was plain, madeof dark wool, accentuating the whiteness of his skin and hair. Tightening therope-tie around his waist, he raised the hood over his head and allowed his redeyes to admire his reflection in the mirror. The wheels are in motion. CHAPTER 6Having squeezed beneath the security gate, Robert Langdon now stood just insidethe entrance to the Grand Gallery. He was staring into the mouth of a long, deepcanyon. On either side of the gallery, stark walls rose thirty feet, evaporatinginto the darkness above. The reddish glow of the service lighting sifted upward,casting an unnatural smolder across a staggering collection of Da Vincis,Titians, and Caravaggios that hung suspended from ceiling cables. Still lifes,religious scenes, and landscapes accompanied portraits of nobility andpoliticians.Although the Grand Gallery housed the Louvre's most famous Italian art, manyvisitors felt the wing's most stunning offering was actually its famous parquetfloor. Laid out in a dazzling geometric design of diagonal oak slats, the floorproduced an ephemeral optical illusion—a multi-dimensional network that gavevisitors the sense they were floating through the gallery on a surface thatchanged with every step.As Langdon's gaze began to trace the inlay, his eyes stopped short on anunexpected object lying on the floor just a few yards to his left, surrounded bypolice tape. He spun toward Fache. \"Is that... a Caravaggio on the floor?\"Fache nodded without even looking.The painting, Langdon guessed, was worth upward of two million dollars, and yetit was lying on the floor like a discarded poster. \"What the devil is it doingon the floor!\"Fache glowered, clearly unmoved. \"This is a crime scene, Mr. Langdon. We havetouched nothing. That canvas was pulled from the wall by the curator. It was howhe activated the security system.\"Langdon looked back at the gate, trying to picture what had happened.\"The curator was attacked in his office, fled into the Grand Gallery, andactivated the security gate by pulling that painting from the wall. The gatefell immediately, sealing off all access. This is the only door in or out ofthis gallery.\"Langdon felt confused. \"So the curator actually captured his attacker inside theGrand Gallery?\"Fache shook his head. \"The security gate separated Saunière from his attacker.The killer was locked out there in the hallway and shot Saunière through thisgate.\" Fache pointed toward an orange tag hanging from one of the bars on thegate under which they had just passed. \"The PTS team found flashback residuefrom a gun. He fired through the bars. Saunière died in here alone.\"Langdon pictured the photograph of Saunière's body. They said he did that tohimself. Langdon looked out at the enormous corridor before them. \"So where ishis body?\"Fache straightened his cruciform tie clip and began to walk. \"As you probablyknow, the Grand Gallery is quite long.\"The exact length, if Langdon recalled correctly, was around fifteen hundredfeet, the length of three Washington Monuments laid end to end. Equallybreathtaking was the corridor's width, which easily could have accommodated apair of side-by-side passenger trains. The center of the hallway was dotted bythe occasional statue or colossal porcelain urn, which served as a tastefuldivider and kept the flow of traffic moving down one wall and up the other.Fache was silent now, striding briskly up the right side of the corridor withhis gaze dead ahead. Langdon felt almost disrespectful to be racing past so manymasterpieces without pausing for so much as a glance.Not that I could see anything in this lighting, he thought.The muted crimson lighting unfortunately conjured memories of Langdon's lastexperience in noninvasive lighting in the Vatican Secret Archives. This wastonight's second unsettling parallel with his near-death in Rome. He flashed onVittoria again. She had been absent from his dreams for months. Langdon couldnot believe Rome had been only a year ago; it felt like decades. Another life.His last correspondence from Vittoria had been in December—a postcard saying shewas headed to the Java Sea to continue her research in entanglement physics...something about using satellites to track manta ray migrations. Langdon hadnever harbored delusions that a woman like Vittoria Vetra could have been happyliving with him on a college campus, but their encounter in Rome had unlocked inhim a longing he never imagined he could feel. His lifelong affinity forbachelorhood and the simple freedoms it allowed had been shaken somehow...replaced by an unexpected emptiness that seemed to have grown over the pastyear.They continued walking briskly, yet Langdon still saw no corpse. \"JacquesSaunière went this far?\"\"Mr. Saunière suffered a bullet wound to his stomach. He died very slowly.Perhaps over fifteen or twenty minutes. He was obviously a man of great personalstrength.\"Langdon turned, appalled. \"Security took fifteen minutes to get here?\"\"Of course not. Louvre security responded immediately to the alarm and found theGrand Gallery sealed. Through the gate, they could hear someone moving around atthe far end of the corridor, but they could not see who it was. They shouted,but they got no answer. Assuming it could only be a criminal, they followedprotocol and called in the Judicial Police. We took up positions within fifteenminutes. When we arrived, we raised the barricade enough to slip underneath, andI sent a dozen armed agents inside. They swept the length of the gallery tocorner the intruder.\"\"And?\"\"They found no one inside. Except...\" He pointed farther down the hall. \"Him.\"Langdon lifted his gaze and followed Fache's outstretched finger. At first hethought Fache was pointing to a large marble statue in the middle of thehallway. As they continued, though, Langdon began to see past the statue. Thirtyyards down the hall, a single spotlight on a portable pole stand shone down onthe floor, creating a stark island of white light in the dark crimson gallery.In the center of the light, like an insect under a microscope, the corpse of thecurator lay naked on the parquet floor.\"You saw the photograph,\" Fache said, \"so this should be of no surprise.\"Langdon felt a deep chill as they approached the body. Before him was one of thestrangest images he had ever seen. The pallid corpse of Jacques Saunière lay on the parquet floor exactly as itappeared in the photograph. As Langdon stood over the body and squinted in theharsh light, he reminded himself to his amazement that Saunière had spent hislast minutes of life arranging his own body in this strange fashion.Saunière looked remarkably fit for a man of his years... and all of hismusculature was in plain view. He had stripped off every shred of clothing,placed it neatly on the floor, and laid down on his back in the center of thewide corridor, perfectly aligned with the long axis of the room. His arms andlegs were sprawled outward in a wide spread eagle, like those of a child makinga snow angel... or, perhaps more appropriately, like a man being drawn andquartered by some invisible force.Just below Saunière's breastbone, a bloody smear marked the spot where thebullet had pierced his flesh. The wound had bled surprisingly little, leavingonly a small pool of blackened blood.Saunière's left index finger was also bloody, apparently having been dipped intothe wound to create the most unsettling aspect of his own macabre deathbed;using his own blood as ink, and employing his own naked abdomen as a canvas,Saunière had drawn a simple symbol on his flesh—five straight lines thatintersected to form a five-pointed star.The pentacle.The bloody star, centered on Saunière's navel, gave his corpse a distinctlyghoulish aura. The photo Langdon had seen was chilling enough, but now,witnessing the scene in person, Langdon felt a deepening uneasiness.He did this to himself.\"Mr. Langdon?\" Fache's dark eyes settled on him again.\"It's a pentacle,\" Langdon offered, his voice feeling hollow in the huge space.\"One of the oldest symbols on earth. Used over four thousand years beforeChrist.\"\"And what does it mean?\"Langdon always hesitated when he got this question. Telling someone what asymbol \"meant\" was like telling them how a song should make them feel—it wasdifferent for all people. A white Ku Klux Klan headpiece conjured images ofhatred and racism in the United States, and yet the same costume carried ameaning of religious faith in Spain.\"Symbols carry different meanings in different settings,\" Langdon said.\"Primarily, the pentacle is a pagan religious symbol.\"Fache nodded. \"Devil worship.\"\"No,\" Langdon corrected, immediately realizing his choice of vocabulary shouldhave been clearer.Nowadays, the term pagan had become almost synonymous with devil worship—a grossmisconception. The word's roots actually reached back to the Latin paganus,meaning country-dwellers. \"Pagans\" were literally unindoctrinated country-folkwho clung to the old, rural religions of Nature worship. In fact, so strong wasthe Church's fear of those who lived in the rural villes that the once innocuousword for \"villager\"—villain—came to mean a wicked soul.\"The pentacle,\" Langdon clarified, \"is a pre-Christian symbol that relates toNature worship. The ancients envisioned their world in two halves—masculine andfeminine. Their gods and goddesses worked to keep a balance of power. Yin andyang. When male and female were balanced, there was harmony in the world. Whenthey were unbalanced, there was chaos.\" Langdon motioned to Saunière's stomach.\"This pentacle is representative of the female half of all things—a conceptreligious historians call the 'sacred feminine' or the 'divine goddess.'Saunière, of all people, would know this.\"\"Saunière drew a goddess symbol on his stomach?\"Langdon had to admit, it seemed odd. \"In its most specific interpretation, thepentacle symbolizes Venus—the goddess of female sexual love and beauty.\"Fache eyed the naked man, and grunted.\"Early religion was based on the divine order of Nature. The goddess Venus andthe planet Venus were one and the same. The goddess had a place in the nighttimesky and was known by many names—Venus, the Eastern Star, Ishtar, Astarte—all ofthem powerful female concepts with ties to Nature and Mother Earth.\"Fache looked more troubled now, as if he somehow preferred the idea of devilworship.Langdon decided not to share the pentacle's most astonishing property—thegraphic origin of its ties to Venus. As a young astronomy student, Langdon hadbeen stunned to learn the planet Venus traced a perfect pentacle across theecliptic sky every four years. So astonished were the ancients to observe thisphenomenon, that Venus and her pentacle became symbols of perfection, beauty,and the cyclic qualities of sexual love. As a tribute to the magic of Venus, theGreeks used her four-year cycle to organize their Olympiads. Nowadays, fewpeople realized that the four-year schedule of modern Olympic Games stillfollowed the cycles of Venus. Even fewer people knew that the five-pointed starhad almost become the official Olympic seal but was modified at the lastmoment—its five points exchanged for five intersecting rings to better reflectthe games' spirit of inclusion and harmony.\"Mr. Langdon,\" Fache said abruptly. \"Obviously, the pentacle must also relate tothe devil. Your American horror movies make that point clearly.\"Langdon frowned. Thank you, Hollywood. The five-pointed star was now a virtualcliché in Satanic serial killer movies, usually scrawled on the wall of someSatanist's apartment along with other alleged demonic symbology. Langdon wasalways frustrated when he saw the symbol in this context; the pentacle's trueorigins were actually quite godly.\"I assure you,\" Langdon said, \"despite what you see in the movies, thepentacle's demonic interpretation is historically inaccurate. The originalfeminine meaning is correct, but the symbolism of the pentacle has beendistorted over the millennia. In this case, through bloodshed.\"\"I'm not sure I follow.\"Langdon glanced at Fache's crucifix, uncertain how to phrase his next point.\"The Church, sir. Symbols are very resilient, but the pentacle was altered bythe early Roman Catholic Church. As part of the Vatican's campaign to eradicatepagan religions and convert the masses to Christianity, the Church launched asmear campaign against the pagan gods and goddesses, recasting their divinesymbols as evil.\"\"Go on.\"\"This is very common in times of turmoil,\" Langdon continued. \"A newly emergingpower will take over the existing symbols and degrade them over time in anattempt to erase their meaning. In the battle between the pagan symbols andChristian symbols, the pagans lost; Poseidon's trident became the devil'spitchfork, the wise crone's pointed hat became the symbol of a witch, andVenus's pentacle became a sign of the devil.\" Langdon paused. \"Unfortunately,the United States military has also perverted the pentacle; it's now ourforemost symbol of war. We paint it on all our fighter jets and hang it on theshoulders of all our generals.\" So much for the goddess of love and beauty.\"Interesting.\" Fache nodded toward the spread-eagle corpse. \"And the positioningof the body? What do you make of that?\"Langdon shrugged. \"The position simply reinforces the reference to the pentacleand sacred feminine.\"Fache's expression clouded. \"I beg your pardon?\"\"Replication. Repeating a symbol is the simplest way to strengthen its meaning.Jacques Saunière positioned himself in the shape of a five-pointed star.\" If onepentacle is good, two is better.Fache's eyes followed the five points of Saunière's arms, legs, and head as heagain ran a hand across his slick hair. \"Interesting analysis.\" He paused. \"Andthe nudity?\" He grumbled as he spoke the word, sounding repulsed by the sight ofan aging male body. \"Why did he remove his clothing?\"Damned good question, Langdon thought. He'd been wondering the same thing eversince he first saw the Polaroid. His best guess was that a naked human form wasyet another endorsement of Venus—the goddess of human sexuality. Although modernculture had erased much of Venus's association with the male/female physicalunion, a sharp etymological eye could still spot a vestige of Venus's originalmeaning in the word \"venereal.\" Langdon decided not to go there.\"Mr. Fache, I obviously can't tell you why Mr. Saunière drew that symbol onhimself or placed himself in this way, but I can tell you that a man likeJacques Saunière would consider the pentacle a sign of the female deity. Thecorrelation between this symbol and the sacred feminine is widely known by arthistorians and symbologists.\"\"Fine. And the use of his own blood as ink?\"\"Obviously he had nothing else to write with.\"Fache was silent a moment. \"Actually, I believe he used blood such that thepolice would follow certain forensic procedures.\"\"I'm sorry?\"\"Look at his left hand.\"Langdon's eyes traced the length of the curator's pale arm to his left hand butsaw nothing. Uncertain, he circled the corpse and crouched down, now noting withsurprise that the curator was clutching a large, felt-tipped marker.\"Saunière was holding it when we found him,\" Fache said, leaving Langdon andmoving several yards to a portable table covered with investigation tools,cables, and assorted electronic gear. \"As I told you,\" he said, rummaging aroundthe table, \"we have touched nothing. Are you familiar with this kind of pen?\"Langdon knelt down farther to see the pen's label.STYLO DE LUMIERE NOIRE.He glanced up in surprise.The black-light pen or watermark stylus was a specialized felt-tipped markeroriginally designed by museums, restorers, and forgery police to place invisiblemarks on items. The stylus wrote in a noncorrosive, alcohol-based fluorescentink that was visible only under black light. Nowadays, museum maintenance staffscarried these markers on their daily rounds to place invisible \"tick marks\" onthe frames of paintings that needed restoration.As Langdon stood up, Fache walked over to the spotlight and turned it off. Thegallery plunged into sudden darkness.Momentarily blinded, Langdon felt a rising uncertainty. Fache's silhouetteappeared, illuminated in bright purple. He approached carrying a portable lightsource, which shrouded him in a violet haze.\"As you may know,\" Fache said, his eyes luminescing in the violet glow, \"policeuse black-light illumination to search crime scenes for blood and other forensicevidence. So you can imagine our surprise...\" Abruptly, he pointed the lightdown at the corpse.Langdon looked down and jumped back in shock.His heart pounded as he took in the bizarre sight now glowing before him on theparquet floor. Scrawled in luminescent handwriting, the curator's final wordsglowed purple beside his corpse. As Langdon stared at the shimmering text, hefelt the fog that had surrounded this entire night growing thicker.Langdon read the message again and looked up at Fache. \"What the hell does thismean!\"Fache's eyes shone white. \"That, monsieur, is precisely the question you arehere to answer.\" Not far away, inside Saunière's office, Lieutenant Collet had returned to theLouvre and was huddled over an audio console set up on the curator's enormousdesk. With the exception of the eerie, robot-like doll of a medieval knight thatseemed to be staring at him from the corner of Saunière's desk, Collet wascomfortable. He adjusted his AKG headphones and checked the input levels on thehard-disk recording system. All systems were go. The microphones werefunctioning flawlessly, and the audio feed was crystal clear.Le moment de vérité, he mused.Smiling, he closed his eyes and settled in to enjoy the rest of the conversationnow being taped inside the Grand Gallery. CHAPTER 7The modest dwelling within the Church of Saint-Sulpice was located on the secondfloor of the church itself, to the left of the choir balcony. A two-room suitewith a stone floor and minimal furnishings, it had been home to Sister SandrineBieil for over a decade. The nearby convent was her formal residence, if anyoneasked, but she preferred the quiet of the church and had made herself quitecomfortable upstairs with a bed, phone, and hot plate.As the church's conservatrice d'affaires, Sister Sandrine was responsible foroverseeing all nonreligious aspects of church operations—general maintenance,hiring support staff and guides, securing the building after hours, and orderingsupplies like communion wine and wafers.Tonight, asleep in her small bed, she awoke to the shrill of her telephone.Tiredly, she lifted the receiver.\"Soeur Sandrine. Eglise Saint-Sulpice.\"\"Hello, Sister,\" the man said in French.Sister Sandrine sat up. What time is it? Although she recognized her boss'svoice, in fifteen years she had never been awoken by him. The abbé was a deeplypious man who went home to bed immediately after mass.\"I apologize if I have awoken you, Sister,\" the abbé said, his own voicesounding groggy and on edge. \"I have a favor to ask of you. I just received acall from an influential American bishop. Perhaps you know him? ManuelAringarosa?\"\"The head of Opus Dei?\" Of course I know of him. Who in the Church doesn't?Aringarosa's conservative prelature had grown powerful in recent years. Theirascension to grace was jump-started in 1982 when Pope John Paul II unexpectedlyelevated them to a \"personal prelature of the Pope,\" officially sanctioning allof their practices. Suspiciously, Opus Dei's elevation occurred the same yearthe wealthy sect allegedly had transferred almost one billion dollars into theVatican's Institute for Religious Works—commonly known as the VaticanBank—bailing it out of an embarrassing bankruptcy. In a second maneuver thatraised eyebrows, the Pope placed the founder of Opus Dei on the \"fast track\" forsainthood, accelerating an often century-long waiting period for canonization toa mere twenty years. Sister Sandrine could not help but feel that Opus Dei'sgood standing in Rome was suspect, but one did not argue with the Holy See.\"Bishop Aringarosa called to ask me a favor,\" the abbé told her, his voicenervous. \"One of his numeraries is in Paris tonight....\"As Sister Sandrine listened to the odd request, she felt a deepening confusion.\"I'm sorry, you say this visiting Opus Dei numerary cannot wait until morning?\"\"I'm afraid not. His plane leaves very early. He has always dreamed of seeingSaint-Sulpice.\"\"But the church is far more interesting by day. The sun's rays through theoculus, the graduated shadows on the gnomon, this is what makes Saint-Sulpiceunique.\"\"Sister, I agree, and yet I would consider it a personal favor if you could lethim in tonight. He can be there at... say one o'clock? That's in twentyminutes.\"Sister Sandrine frowned. \"Of course. It would be my pleasure.\"The abbé thanked her and hung up.Puzzled, Sister Sandrine remained a moment in the warmth of her bed, trying toshake off the cobwebs of sleep. Her sixty-year-old body did not awake as fast asit used to, although tonight's phone call had certainly roused her senses. OpusDei had always made her uneasy. Beyond the prelature's adherence to the arcaneritual of corporal mortification, their views on women were medieval at best.She had been shocked to learn that female numeraries were forced to clean themen's residence halls for no pay while the men were at mass; women slept onhardwood floors, while the men had straw mats; and women were forced to endureadditional requirements of corporal mortification... all as added penance fororiginal sin. It seemed Eve's bite from the apple of knowledge was a debt womenwere doomed to pay for eternity. Sadly, while most of the Catholic Church wasgradually moving in the right direction with respect to women's rights, Opus Deithreatened to reverse the progress. Even so, Sister Sandrine had her orders.Swinging her legs off the bed, she stood slowly, chilled by the cold stone onthe soles of her bare feet. As the chill rose through her flesh, she felt anunexpected apprehension.Women's intuition?A follower of God, Sister Sandrine had learned to find peace in the calmingvoices of her own soul. Tonight, however, those voices were as silent as theempty church around her. CHAPTER 8Langdon couldn't tear his eyes from the glowing purple text scrawled across theparquet floor. Jacques Saunière's final communication seemed as unlikely adeparting message as any Langdon could imagine.The message read: 13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5O, Draconian devil!Oh, lame saint! Although Langdon had not the slightest idea what it meant, he did understandFache's instinct that the pentacle had something to do with devil worship.O, Draconian devil!Saunière had left a literal reference to the devil. Equally as bizarre was theseries of numbers. \"Part of it looks like a numeric cipher.\"\"Yes,\" Fache said. \"Our cryptographers are already working on it. We believethese numbers may be the key to who killed him. Maybe a telephone exchange orsome kind of social identification. Do the numbers have any symbolic meaning toyou?\"Langdon looked again at the digits, sensing it would take him hours to extractany symbolic meaning. If Saunière had even intended any. To Langdon, the numberslooked totally random. He was accustomed to symbolic progressions that made somesemblance of sense, but everything here—the pentacle, the text, thenumbers—seemed disparate at the most fundamental level.\"You alleged earlier,\" Fache said, \"that Saunière's actions here were all in aneffort to send some sort of message... goddess worship or something in thatvein? How does this message fit in?\"Langdon knew the question was rhetorical. This bizarre communiqué obviously didnot fit Langdon's scenario of goddess worship at all.O, Draconian devil? Oh, lame saint?Fache said, \"This text appears to be an accusation of some sort. Wouldn't youagree?\"Langdon tried to imagine the curator's final minutes trapped alone in the GrandGallery, knowing he was about to die. It seemed logical. \"An accusation againsthis murderer makes sense, I suppose.\"\"My job, of course, is to put a name to that person. Let me ask you this, Mr.Langdon. To your eye, beyond the numbers, what about this message is moststrange?\"Most strange? A dying man had barricaded himself in the gallery, drawn apentacle on himself, and scrawled a mysterious accusation on the floor. Whatabout the scenario wasn't strange?\"The word 'Draconian'?\" he ventured, offering the first thing that came to mind.Langdon was fairly certain that a reference to Draco—the ruthlessseventh-century B.C. politician—was an unlikely dying thought. \" 'Draconiandevil' seems an odd choice of vocabulary.\"\"Draconian?\" Fache's tone came with a tinge of impatience now. \"Saunière'schoice of vocabulary hardly seems the primary issue here.\"Langdon wasn't sure what issue Fache had in mind, but he was starting to suspectthat Draco and Fache would have gotten along well.\"Saunière was a Frenchman,\" Fache said flatly. \"He lived in Paris. And yet hechose to write this message...\"\"In English,\" Langdon said, now realizing the captain's meaning.Fache nodded. \"Précisément. Any idea why?\"Langdon knew Saunière spoke impeccable English, and yet the reason he had chosenEnglish as the language in which to write his final words escaped Langdon. Heshrugged.Fache motioned back to the pentacle on Saunière's abdomen. \"Nothing to do withdevil worship? Are you still certain?\"Langdon was certain of nothing anymore. \"The symbology and text don't seem tocoincide. I'm sorry I can't be of more help.\"\"Perhaps this will clarify.\" Fache backed away from the body and raised theblack light again, letting the beam spread out in a wider angle. \"And now?\"To Langdon's amazement, a rudimentary circle glowed around the curator's body.Saunière had apparently lay down and swung the pen around himself in severallong arcs, essentially inscribing himself inside a circle.In a flash, the meaning became clear.\"The Vitruvian Man,\" Langdon gasped. Saunière had created a life-sized replicaof Leonardo da Vinci's most famous sketch.Considered the most anatomically correct drawing of its day, Da Vinci's TheVitruvian Man had become a modern-day icon of culture, appearing on posters,mouse pads, and T-shirts around the world. The celebrated sketch consisted of aperfect circle in which was inscribed a nude male... his arms and legsoutstretched in a naked spread eagle.Da Vinci. Langdon felt a shiver of amazement. The clarity of Saunière'sintentions could not be denied. In his final moments of life, the curator hadstripped off his clothing and arranged his body in a clear image of Leonardo daVinci's Vitruvian Man.The circle had been the missing critical element. A feminine symbol ofprotection, the circle around the naked man's body completed Da Vinci's intendedmessage—male and female harmony. The question now, though, was why Saunièrewould imitate a famous drawing.\"Mr. Langdon,\" Fache said, \"certainly a man like yourself is aware that Leonardoda Vinci had a tendency toward the darker arts.\"Langdon was surprised by Fache's knowledge of Da Vinci, and it certainly went along way toward explaining the captain's suspicions about devil worship. DaVinci had always been an awkward subject for historians, especially in theChristian tradition. Despite the visionary's genius, he was a flamboyanthomosexual and worshipper of Nature's divine order, both of which placed him ina perpetual state of sin against God. Moreover, the artist's eerieeccentricities projected an admittedly demonic aura: Da Vinci exhumed corpses tostudy human anatomy; he kept mysterious journals in illegible reversehandwriting; he believed he possessed the alchemic power to turn lead into goldand even cheat God by creating an elixir to postpone death; and his inventionsincluded horrific, never-before-imagined weapons of war and torture.Misunderstanding breeds distrust, Langdon thought.Even Da Vinci's enormous output of breathtaking Christian art only furthered theartist's reputation for spiritual hypocrisy. Accepting hundreds of lucrativeVatican commissions, Da Vinci painted Christian themes not as an expression ofhis own beliefs but rather as a commercial venture—a means of funding a lavishlifestyle. Unfortunately, Da Vinci was a prankster who often amused himself byquietly gnawing at the hand that fed him. He incorporated in many of hisChristian paintings hidden symbolism that was anything but Christian—tributes tohis own beliefs and a subtle thumbing of his nose at the Church. Langdon hadeven given a lecture once at the National Gallery in London entitled: \"TheSecret Life of Leonardo: Pagan Symbolism in Christian Art.\"\"I understand your concerns,\" Langdon now said, \"but Da Vinci never reallypracticed any dark arts. He was an exceptionally spiritual man, albeit one inconstant conflict with the Church.\" As Langdon said this, an odd thought poppedinto his mind. He glanced down at the message on the floor again. O, Draconiandevil! Oh, lame saint!\"Yes?\" Fache said.Langdon weighed his words carefully. \"I was just thinking that Saunière shared alot of spiritual ideologies with Da Vinci, including a concern over the Church'selimination of the sacred feminine from modern religion. Maybe, by imitating afamous Da Vinci drawing, Saunière was simply echoing some of their sharedfrustrations with the modern Church's demonization of the goddess.\"Fache's eyes hardened. \"You think Saunière is calling the Church a lame saintand a Draconian devil?\"Langdon had to admit it seemed far-fetched, and yet the pentacle seemed toendorse the idea on some level. \"All I am saying is that Mr. Saunière dedicatedhis life to studying the history of the goddess, and nothing has done more toerase that history than the Catholic Church. It seems reasonable that Saunièremight have chosen to express his disappointment in his final good-bye.\"\"Disappointment?\" Fache demanded, sounding hostile now. \"This message soundsmore enraged than disappointed, wouldn't you say?\"Langdon was reaching the end of his patience. \"Captain, you asked for myinstincts as to what Saunière is trying to say here, and that's what I'm givingyou.\"\"That this is an indictment of the Church?\" Fache's jaw tightened as he spokethrough clenched teeth. \"Mr. Langdon, I have seen a lot of death in my work, andlet me tell you something. When a man is murdered by another man, I do notbelieve his final thoughts are to write an obscure spiritual statement that noone will understand. I believe he is thinking of one thing only.\" Fache'swhispery voice sliced the air. \"La vengeance. I believe Saunière wrote this noteto tell us who killed him.\" Langdon stared. \"But that makes no sensewhatsoever.\"\"No?\"\"No,\" he fired back, tired and frustrated. \"You told me Saunière was attacked inhis office by someone he had apparently invited in.\"\"Yes.\"\"So it seems reasonable to conclude that the curator knew his attacker.\"Fache nodded. \"Go on.\"\"So if Saunière knew the person who killed him, what kind of indictment isthis?\" He pointed at the floor. \"Numeric codes? Lame saints? Draconian devils?Pentacles on his stomach? It's all too cryptic.\"Fache frowned as if the idea had never occurred to him. \"You have a point.\"\"Considering the circumstances,\" Langdon said, \"I would assume that if Saunièrewanted to tell you who killed him, he would have written down somebody's name.\"As Langdon spoke those words, a smug smile crossed Fache's lips for the firsttime all night. \"Précisément,\" Fache said. \"Précisément.\" I am witnessing the work of a master, mused Lieutenant Collet as he tweaked hisaudio gear and listened to Fache's voice coming through the headphones. Theagent supérieur knew it was moments like these that had lifted the captain tothe pinnacle of French law enforcement.Fache will do what no one else dares.The delicate art of cajoler was a lost skill in modern law enforcement, one thatrequired exceptional poise under pressure. Few men possessed the necessarysangfroid for this kind of operation, but Fache seemed born for it. Hisrestraint and patience bordered on the robotic.Fache's sole emotion this evening seemed to be one of intense resolve, as ifthis arrest were somehow personal to him. Fache's briefing of his agents an hourago had been unusually succinct and assured. I know who murdered JacquesSaunière, Fache had said. You know what to do. No mistakes tonight.And so far, no mistakes had been made.Collet was not yet privy to the evidence that had cemented Fache's certainty oftheir suspect's guilt, but he knew better than to question the instincts of theBull. Fache's intuition seemed almost supernatural at times. God whispers in hisear, one agent had insisted after a particularly impressive display of Fache'ssixth sense. Collet had to admit, if there was a God, Bezu Fache would be on HisA-list. The captain attended mass and confession with zealous regularity—farmore than the requisite holiday attendance fulfilled by other officials in thename of good public relations. When the Pope visited Paris a few years back,Fache had used all his muscle to obtain the honor of an audience. A photo ofFache with the Pope now hung in his office. The Papal Bull, the agents secretlycalled it.Collet found it ironic that one of Fache's rare popular public stances in recentyears had been his outspoken reaction to the Catholic pedophilia scandal. Thesepriests should be hanged twice! Fache had declared. Once for their crimesagainst children. And once for shaming the good name of the Catholic Church.Collet had the odd sense it was the latter that angered Fache more.Turning now to his laptop computer, Collet attended to the other half of hisresponsibilities here tonight—the GPS tracking system. The image onscreenrevealed a detailed floor plan of the Denon Wing, a structural schematicuploaded from the Louvre Security Office. Letting his eyes trace the maze ofgalleries and hallways, Collet found what he was looking for.Deep in the heart of the Grand Gallery blinked a tiny red dot.La marque.Fache was keeping his prey on a very tight leash tonight. Wisely so. RobertLangdon had proven himself one cool customer. CHAPTER 9To ensure his conversation with Mr. Langdon would not be interrupted, Bezu Fachehad turned off his cellular phone. Unfortunately, it was an expensive modelequipped with a two-way radio feature, which, contrary to his orders, was nowbeing used by one of his agents to page him.\"Capitaine?\" The phone crackled like a walkie-talkie.Fache felt his teeth clench in rage. He could imagine nothing important enoughthat Collet would interrupt this surveillance cachée—especially at this criticaljuncture.He gave Langdon a calm look of apology. \"One moment please.\" He pulled the phonefrom his belt and pressed the radio transmission button. \"Oui?\"\"Capitaine, un agent du Département de Cryptographie est arrivé.\"Fache's anger stalled momentarily. A cryptographer? Despite the lousy timing,this was probably good news. Fache, after finding Saunière's cryptic text on thefloor, had uploaded photographs of the entire crime scene to the CryptographyDepartment in hopes someone there could tell him what the hell Saunière wastrying to say. If a code breaker had now arrived, it most likely meant someonehad decrypted Saunière's message.\"I'm busy at the moment,\" Fache radioed back, leaving no doubt in his tone thata line had been crossed. \"Ask the cryptographer to wait at the command post.I'll speak to him when I'm done.\"\"Her,\" the voice corrected. \"It's Agent Neveu.\"Fache was becoming less amused with this call every passing moment. Sophie Neveuwas one of DCPJ's biggest mistakes. A young Parisian déchiffreuse who hadstudied cryptography in England at the Royal Holloway, Sophie Neveu had beenfoisted on Fache two years ago as part of the ministry's attempt to incorporatemore women into the police force. The ministry's ongoing foray into politicalcorrectness, Fache argued, was weakening the department. Women not only lackedthe physicality necessary for police work, but their mere presence posed adangerous distraction to the men in the field. As Fache had feared, Sophie Neveuwas proving far more distracting than most.At thirty-two years old, she had a dogged determination that bordered onobstinate. Her eager espousal of Britain's new cryptologic methodologycontinually exasperated the veteran French cryptographers above her. And by farthe most troubling to Fache was the inescapable universal truth that in anoffice of middle-aged men, an attractive young woman always drew eyes away fromthe work at hand.The man on the radio said, \"Agent Neveu insisted on speaking to you immediately,Captain. I tried to stop her, but she's on her way into the gallery.\"Fache recoiled in disbelief. \"Unacceptable! I made it very clear—\" For a moment, Robert Langdon thought Bezu Fache was suffering a stroke. Thecaptain was mid-sentence when his jaw stopped moving and his eyes bulged. Hisblistering gaze seemed fixated on something over Langdon's shoulder. BeforeLangdon could turn to see what it was, he heard a woman's voice chime out behindhim.\"Excusez-moi, messieurs.\"Langdon turned to see a young woman approaching. She was moving down thecorridor toward them with long, fluid strides... a haunting certainty to hergait. Dressed casually in a knee-length, cream-colored Irish sweater over blackleggings, she was attractive and looked to be about thirty. Her thick burgundyhair fell unstyled to her shoulders, framing the warmth of her face. Unlike thewaifish, cookie-cutter blondes that adorned Harvard dorm room walls, this womanwas healthy with an unembellished beauty and genuineness that radiated astriking personal confidence.To Langdon's surprise, the woman walked directly up to him and extended a politehand. \"Monsieur Langdon, I am Agent Neveu from DCPJ's Cryptology Department.\"Her words curved richly around her muted Anglo-Franco accent. \"It is a pleasureto meet you.\"Langdon took her soft palm in his and felt himself momentarily fixed in herstrong gaze. Her eyes were olive-green—incisive and clear.Fache drew a seething inhalation, clearly preparing to launch into a reprimand.\"Captain,\" she said, turning quickly and beating him to the punch, \"pleaseexcuse the interruption, but—\"\"Ce n'est pas le moment!\" Fache sputtered.\"I tried to phone you.\" Sophie continued in English, as if out of courtesy toLangdon. \"But your cell phone was turned off.\"\"I turned it off for a reason,\" Fache hissed. \"I am speaking to Mr. Langdon.\"\"I've deciphered the numeric code,\" she said flatly.Langdon felt a pulse of excitement. She broke the code?Fache looked uncertain how to respond.\"Before I explain,\" Sophie said, \"I have an urgent message for Mr. Langdon.\"Fache's expression turned to one of deepening concern. \"For Mr. Langdon?\"She nodded, turning back to Langdon. \"You need to contact the U.S. Embassy, Mr.Langdon. They have a message for you from the States.\"Langdon reacted with surprise, his excitement over the code giving way to asudden ripple of concern. A message from the States? He tried to imagine whocould be trying to reach him. Only a few of his colleagues knew he was in Paris.Fache's broad jaw had tightened with the news. \"The U.S. Embassy?\" he demanded,sounding suspicious. \"How would they know to find Mr. Langdon here?\"Sophie shrugged. \"Apparently they called Mr. Langdon's hotel, and the conciergetold them Mr. Langdon had been collected by a DCPJ agent.\"Fache looked troubled. \"And the embassy contacted DCPJ Cryptography?\"\"No, sir,\" Sophie said, her voice firm. \"When I called the DCPJ switchboard inan attempt to contact you, they had a message waiting for Mr. Langdon and askedme to pass it along if I got through to you.\"Fache's brow furrowed in apparent confusion. He opened his mouth to speak, butSophie had already turned back to Langdon.\"Mr. Langdon,\" she declared, pulling a small slip of paper from her pocket,\"this is the number for your embassy's messaging service. They asked that youphone in as soon as possible.\" She handed him the paper with an intent gaze.\"While I explain the code to Captain Fache, you need to make this call.\"Langdon studied the slip. It had a Paris phone number and extension on it.\"Thank you,\" he said, feeling worried now. \"Where do I find a phone?\"Sophie began to pull a cell phone from her sweater pocket, but Fache waved heroff. He now looked like Mount Vesuvius about to erupt. Without taking his eyesoff Sophie, he produced his own cell phone and held it out. \"This line issecure, Mr. Langdon. You may use it.\"Langdon felt mystified by Fache's anger with the young woman. Feeling uneasy, heaccepted the captain's phone. Fache immediately marched Sophie several stepsaway and began chastising her in hushed tones. Disliking the captain more andmore, Langdon turned away from the odd confrontation and switched on the cellphone. Checking the slip of paper Sophie had given him, Langdon dialed thenumber.The line began to ring.One ring... two rings... three rings...Finally the call connected.Langdon expected to hear an embassy operator, but he found himself insteadlistening to an answering machine. Oddly, the voice on the tape was familiar. Itwas that of Sophie Neveu.\"Bonjour, vous êtes bien chez Sophie Neveu,\" the woman's voice said. \"Je suisabsenle pour le moment, mais...\"Confused, Langdon turned back toward Sophie. \"I'm sorry, Ms. Neveu? I think youmay have given me—\"\"No, that's the right number,\" Sophie interjected quickly, as if anticipatingLangdon's confusion. \"The embassy has an automated message system. You have todial an access code to pick up your messages.\"Langdon stared. \"But—\"\"It's the three-digit code on the paper I gave you.\"Langdon opened his mouth to explain the bizarre error, but Sophie flashed him asilencing glare that lasted only an instant. Her green eyes sent a crystal-clearmessage.Don't ask questions. Just do it.Bewildered, Langdon punched in the extension on the slip of paper: 454.Sophie's outgoing message immediately cut off, and Langdon heard an electronicvoice announce in French: \"You have one new message.\" Apparently, 454 wasSophie's remote access code for picking up her messages while away from home.I'm picking up this woman's messages?Langdon could hear the tape rewinding now. Finally, it stopped, and the machineengaged. Langdon listened as the message began to play. Again, the voice on theline was Sophie's.\"Mr. Langdon,\" the message began in a fearful whisper. \"Do not react to thismessage. Just listen calmly. You are in danger right now. Follow my directionsvery closely.\" CHAPTER 10Silas sat behind the wheel of the black Audi the Teacher had arranged for himand gazed out at the great Church of Saint-Sulpice. Lit from beneath by banks offloodlights, the church's two bell towers rose like stalwart sentinels above thebuilding's long body. On either flank, a shadowy row of sleek buttresses juttedout like the ribs of a beautiful beast.The heathens used a house of God to conceal their keystone. Again thebrotherhood had confirmed their legendary reputation for illusion and deceit.Silas was looking forward to finding the keystone and giving it to the Teacherso they could recover what the brotherhood had long ago stolen from thefaithful.How powerful that will make Opus Dei.Parking the Audi on the deserted Place Saint-Sulpice, Silas exhaled, tellinghimself to clear his mind for the task at hand. His broad back still ached fromthe corporal mortification he had endured earlier today, and yet the pain wasinconsequential compared with the anguish of his life before Opus Dei had savedhim.Still, the memories haunted his soul.Release your hatred, Silas commanded himself. Forgive those who trespassedagainst you.Looking up at the stone towers of Saint-Sulpice, Silas fought that familiarundertow... that force that often dragged his mind back in time, locking himonce again in the prison that had been his world as a young man. The memories ofpurgatory came as they always did, like a tempest to his senses... the reek ofrotting cabbage, the stench of death, human urine and feces. The cries ofhopelessness against the howling wind of the Pyrenees and the soft sobs offorgotten men.Andorra, he thought, feeling his muscles tighten.Incredibly, it was in that barren and forsaken suzerain between Spain andFrance, shivering in his stone cell, wanting only to die, that Silas had beensaved.He had not realized it at the time.The light came long after the thunder.His name was not Silas then, although he didn't recall the name his parents hadgiven him. He had left home when he was seven. His drunken father, a burlydockworker, enraged by the arrival of an albino son, beat his mother regularly,blaming her for the boy's embarrassing condition. When the boy tried to defendher, he too was badly beaten.One night, there was a horrific fight, and his mother never got up. The boystood over his lifeless mother and felt an unbearable up-welling of guilt forpermitting it to happen.This is my fault!As if some kind of demon were controlling his body, the boy walked to thekitchen and grasped a butcher knife. Hypnotically, he moved to the bedroom wherehis father lay on the bed in a drunken stupor. Without a word, the boy stabbedhim in the back. His father cried out in pain and tried to roll over, but hisson stabbed him again, over and over until the apartment fell quiet.The boy fled home but found the streets of Marseilles equally unfriendly. Hisstrange appearance made him an outcast among the other young runaways, and hewas forced to live alone in the basement of a dilapidated factory, eating stolenfruit and raw fish from the dock. His only companions were tattered magazines hefound in the trash, and he taught himself to read them. Over time, he grewstrong. When he was twelve, another drifter—a girl twice his age—mocked him onthe streets and attempted to steal his food. The girl found herself pummeled towithin inches of her life. When the authorities pulled the boy off her, theygave him an ultimatum—leave Marseilles or go to juvenile prison.The boy moved down the coast to Toulon. Over time, the looks of pity on thestreets turned to looks of fear. The boy had grown to a powerful young man. Whenpeople passed by, he could hear them whispering to one another. A ghost, theywould say, their eyes wide with fright as they stared at his white skin. A ghostwith the eyes of a devil!And he felt like a ghost... transparent... floating from seaport to seaport.People seemed to look right through him.At eighteen, in a port town, while attempting to steal a case of cured ham froma cargo ship, he was caught by a pair of crewmen. The two sailors who began tobeat him smelled of beer, just as his father had. The memories of fear andhatred surfaced like a monster from the deep. The young man broke the firstsailor's neck with his bare hands, and only the arrival of the police saved thesecond sailor from a similar fate.Two months later, in shackles, he arrived at a prison in Andorra.You are as white as a ghost, the inmates ridiculed as the guards marched him in,naked and cold. Mira el espectro! Perhaps the ghost will pass right throughthese walls!Over the course of twelve years, his flesh and soul withered until he knew hehad become transparent.I am a ghost.I am weightless.Yo soy un espectro... palido coma una fantasma... caminando este mundo a solas.One night the ghost awoke to the screams of other inmates. He didn't know whatinvisible force was shaking the floor on which he slept, nor what mighty handwas trembling the mortar of his stone cell, but as he jumped to his feet, alarge boulder toppled onto the very spot where he had been sleeping. Looking upto see where the stone had come from, he saw a hole in the trembling wall, andbeyond it, a vision he had not seen in over ten years. The moon.Even while the earth still shook, the ghost found himself scrambling through anarrow tunnel, staggering out into an expansive vista, and tumbling down abarren mountainside into the woods. He ran all night, always downward, deliriouswith hunger and exhaustion.Skirting the edges of consciousness, he found himself at dawn in a clearingwhere train tracks cut a swath across the forest. Following the rails, he movedon as if dreaming. Seeing an empty freight car, he crawled in for shelter andrest. When he awoke the train was moving. How long? How far? A pain was growingin his gut. Am I dying? He slept again. This time he awoke to someone yelling,beating him, throwing him out of the freight car. Bloody, he wandered theoutskirts of a small village looking in vain for food. Finally, his body tooweak to take another step, he lay down by the side of the road and slipped intounconsciousness.The light came slowly, and the ghost wondered how long he had been dead. A day?Three days? It didn't matter. His bed was soft like a cloud, and the air aroundhim smelled sweet with candles. Jesus was there, staring down at him. I am here,Jesus said. The stone has been rolled aside, and you are born again.He slept and awoke. Fog shrouded his thoughts. He had never believed in heaven,and yet Jesus was watching over him. Food appeared beside his bed, and the ghostate it, almost able to feel the flesh materializing on his bones. He sleptagain. When he awoke, Jesus was still smiling down, speaking. You are saved, myson. Blessed are those who follow my path.Again, he slept.It was a scream of anguish that startled the ghost from his slumber. His bodyleapt out of bed, staggered down a hallway toward the sounds of shouting. Heentered into a kitchen and saw a large man beating a smaller man. Withoutknowing why, the ghost grabbed the large man and hurled him backward against awall. The man fled, leaving the ghost standing over the body of a young man inpriest's robes. The priest had a badly shattered nose. Lifting the bloodypriest, the ghost carried him to a couch.\"Thank you, my friend,\" the priest said in awkward French. \"The offertory moneyis tempting for thieves. You speak French in your sleep. Do you also speakSpanish?\"The ghost shook his head.\"What is your name?\" he continued in broken French.The ghost could not remember the name his parents had given him. All he heardwere the taunting gibes of the prison guards.The priest smiled. \"No hay problema. My name is Manuel Aringarosa. I am amissionary from Madrid. I was sent here to build a church for the Obra de Dios.\"\"Where am I?\" His voice sounded hollow.\"Oviedo. In the north of Spain.\"\"How did I get here?\"\"Someone left you on my doorstep. You were ill. I fed you. You've been here manydays.\"The ghost studied his young caretaker. Years had passed since anyone had shownany kindness. \"Thank you, Father.\"The priest touched his bloody lip. \"It is I who am thankful, my friend.\"When the ghost awoke in the morning, his world felt clearer. He gazed up at thecrucifix on the wall above his bed. Although it no longer spoke to him, he felta comforting aura in its presence. Sitting up, he was surprised to find anewspaper clipping on his bedside table. The article was in French, a week old.When he read the story, he filled with fear. It told of an earthquake in themountains that had destroyed a prison and freed many dangerous criminals.His heart began pounding. The priest knows who I am! The emotion he felt was onehe had not felt for some time. Shame. Guilt. It was accompanied by the fear ofbeing caught. He jumped from his bed. Where do I run?\"The Book of Acts,\" a voice said from the door.The ghost turned, frightened.The young priest was smiling as he entered. His nose was awkwardly bandaged, andhe was holding out an old Bible. \"I found one in French for you. The chapter ismarked.\"Uncertain, the ghost took the Bible and looked at the chapter the priest hadmarked.Acts 16.The verses told of a prisoner named Silas who lay naked and beaten in his cell,singing hymns to God. When the ghost reached Verse 26, he gasped in shock.\"...And suddenly, there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of theprison were shaken, and all the doors fell open.\"His eyes shot up at the priest.The priest smiled warmly. \"From now on, my friend, if you have no other name, Ishall call you Silas.\"The ghost nodded blankly. Silas. He had been given flesh. My name is Silas.\"It's time for breakfast,\" the priest said. \"You will need your strength if youare to help me build this church.\" Twenty thousand feet above the Mediterranean, Alitalia flight 1618 bounced inturbulence, causing passengers to shift nervously. Bishop Aringarosa barelynoticed. His thoughts were with the future of Opus Dei. Eager to know how plansin Paris were progressing, he wished he could phone Silas. But he could not. TheTeacher had seen to that.\"It is for your own safety,\" the Teacher had explained, speaking in English witha French accent. \"I am familiar enough with electronic communications to knowthey can be intercepted. The results could be disastrous for you.\"Aringarosa knew he was right. The Teacher seemed an exceptionally careful man.He had not revealed his own identity to Aringarosa, and yet he had provenhimself a man well worth obeying. After all, he had somehow obtained very secretinformation. The names of the brotherhood's four top members! This had been oneof the coups that convinced the bishop the Teacher was truly capable ofdelivering the astonishing prize he claimed he could unearth.\"Bishop,\" the Teacher had told him, \"I have made all the arrangements. For myplan to succeed, you must allow Silas to answer only to me for several days. Thetwo of you will not speak. I will communicate with him through secure channels.\"\"You will treat him with respect?\"\"A man of faith deserves the highest.\"\"Excellent. Then I understand. Silas and I shall not speak until this is over.\"\"I do this to protect your identity, Silas's identity, and my investment.\"\"Your investment?\"\"Bishop, if your own eagerness to keep abreast of progress puts you in jail,then you will be unable to pay me my fee.\"The bishop smiled. \"A fine point. Our desires are in accord. Godspeed.\"Twenty million euro, the bishop thought, now gazing out the plane's window. Thesum was approximately the same number of U.S. dollars. A pittance for somethingso powerful.He felt a renewed confidence that the Teacher and Silas would not fail. Moneyand faith were powerful motivators. CHAPTER 11\"Une plaisanterie numérique?\" Bezu Fache was livid, glaring at Sophie Neveu indisbelief. A numeric joke? \"Your professional assessment of Saunière's code isthat it is some kind of mathematical prank?\"Fache was in utter incomprehension of this woman's gall. Not only had she justbarged in on Fache without permission, but she was now trying to convince himthat Saunière, in his final moments of life, had been inspired to leave amathematical gag?\"This code,\" Sophie explained in rapid French, \"is simplistic to the point ofabsurdity. Jacques Saunière must have known we would see through itimmediately.\" She pulled a scrap of paper from her sweater pocket and handed itto Fache. \"Here is the decryption.\"Fache looked at the card. 1-1-2-3-5-8-13-21 \"This is it?\" he snapped. \"All you did was put the numbers in increasing order!\"Sophie actually had the nerve to give a satisfied smile. \"Exactly.\"Fache's tone lowered to a guttural rumble. \"Agent Neveu, I have no idea wherethe hell you're going with this, but I suggest you get there fast.\" He shot ananxious glance at Langdon, who stood nearby with the phone pressed to his ear,apparently still listening to his phone message from the U.S. Embassy. FromLangdon's ashen expression, Fache sensed the news was bad.\"Captain,\" Sophie said, her tone dangerously defiant, \"the sequence of numbersyou have in your hand happens to be one of the most famous mathematicalprogressions in history.\"Fache was not aware there even existed a mathematical progression that qualifiedas famous, and he certainly didn't appreciate Sophie's off-handed tone.\"This is the Fibonacci sequence,\" she declared, nodding toward the piece ofpaper in Fache's hand. \"A progression in which each term is equal to the sum ofthe two preceding terms.\"Fache studied the numbers. Each term was indeed the sum of the two previous, andyet Fache could not imagine what the relevance of all this was to Saunière'sdeath.\"Mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci created this succession of numbers in thethirteenth-century. Obviously there can be no coincidence that all of thenumbers Saunière wrote on the floor belong to Fibonacci's famous sequence.\"Fache stared at the young woman for several moments. \"Fine, if there is nocoincidence, would you tell me why Jacques Saunière chose to do this. What is hesaying? What does this mean?\"She shrugged. \"Absolutely nothing. That's the point. It's a simplisticcryptographic joke. Like taking the words of a famous poem and shuffling them atrandom to see if anyone recognizes what all the words have in common.\"Fache took a menacing step forward, placing his face only inches from Sophie's.\"I certainly hope you have a much more satisfying explanation than that.\"Sophie's soft features grew surprisingly stern as she leaned in. \"Captain,considering what you have at stake here tonight, I thought you might appreciateknowing that Jacques Saunière might be playing games with you. Apparently not.I'll inform the director of Cryptography you no longer need our services.\"With that, she turned on her heel, and marched off the way she had come.Stunned, Fache watched her disappear into the darkness. Is she out of her mind?Sophie Neveu had just redefined le suicide professionnel.Fache turned to Langdon, who was still on the phone, looking more concerned thanbefore, listening intently to his phone message. The U.S. Embassy. Bezu Fachedespised many things... but few drew more wrath than the U.S. Embassy.Fache and the ambassador locked horns regularly over shared affairs ofstate—their most common battleground being law enforcement for visitingAmericans. Almost daily, DCPJ arrested American exchange students in possessionof drugs, U.S. businessmen for soliciting underage Prostitutes, Americantourists for shoplifting or destruction of property. Legally, the U.S. Embassycould intervene and extradite guilty citizens back to the United States, wherethey received nothing more than a slap on the wrist.And the embassy invariably did just that.L'émasculation de la Police Judiciaire, Fache called it. Paris Match had run acartoon recently depicting Fache as a police dog, trying to bite an Americancriminal, but unable to reach because it was chained to the U.S. Embassy.Not tonight, Fache told himself. There is far too much at stake.By the time Robert Langdon hung up the phone, he looked ill.\"Is everything all right?\" Fache asked.Weakly, Langdon shook his head.Bad news from home, Fache sensed, noticing Langdon was sweating slightly asFache took back his cell phone.\"An accident,\" Langdon stammered, looking at Fache with a strange expression. \"Afriend...\" He hesitated. \"I'll need to fly home first thing in the morning.\"Fache had no doubt the shock on Langdon's face was genuine, and yet he sensedanother emotion there too, as if a distant fear were suddenly simmering in theAmerican's eyes. \"I'm sorry to hear that,\" Fache said, watching Langdon closely.\"Would you like to sit down?\" He motioned toward one of the viewing benches inthe gallery.Langdon nodded absently and took a few steps toward the bench. He paused,looking more confused with every moment. \"Actually, I think I'd like to use therest room.\"Fache frowned inwardly at the delay. \"The rest room. Of course. Let's take abreak for a few minutes.\" He motioned back down the long hallway in thedirection they had come from. \"The rest rooms are back toward the curator'soffice.\"Langdon hesitated, pointing in the other direction toward the far end of theGrand Gallery corridor. \"I believe there's a much closer rest room at the end.\"Fache realized Langdon was right. They were two thirds of the way down, and theGrand Gallery dead-ended at a pair of rest rooms. \"Shall I accompany you?\"Langdon shook his head, already moving deeper into the gallery. \"Not necessary.I think I'd like a few minutes alone.\"Fache was not wild about the idea of Langdon wandering alone down the remaininglength of corridor, but he took comfort in knowing the Grand Gallery was a deadend whose only exit was at the other end—the gate under which they had entered.Although French fire regulations required several emergency stairwells for aspace this large, those stairwells had been sealed automatically when Saunièretripped the security system. Granted, that system had now been reset, unlockingthe stairwells, but it didn't matter—the external doors, if opened, would setoff fire alarms and were guarded outside by DCPJ agents. Langdon could notpossibly leave without Fache knowing about it.\"I need to return to Mr. Saunière's office for a moment,\" Fache said. \"Pleasecome find me directly, Mr. Langdon. There is more we need to discuss.\"Langdon gave a quiet wave as he disappeared into the darkness.Turning, Fache marched angrily in the opposite direction. Arriving at the gate,he slid under, exited the Grand Gallery, marched down the hall, and stormed intothe command center at Saunière's office.\"Who gave the approval to let Sophie Neveu into this building!\" Fache bellowed.Collet was the first to answer. \"She told the guards outside she'd broken thecode.\"Fache looked around. \"Is she gone?\"\"She's not with you?\"\"She left.\" Fache glanced out at the darkened hallway. Apparently Sophie hadbeen in no mood to stop by and chat with the other officers on her way out.For a moment, Fache considered radioing the guards in the entresol and tellingthem to stop Sophie and drag her back up here before she could leave thepremises. He thought better of it. That was only his pride talking... wantingthe last word. He'd had enough distractions tonight.Deal with Agent Neveu later, he told himself, already looking forward to firingher.Pushing Sophie from his mind, Fache stared for a moment at the miniature knightstanding on Saunière's desk. Then he turned back to Collet. \"Do you have him?\"Collet gave a curt nod and spun the laptop toward Fache. The red dot was clearlyvisible on the floor plan overlay, blinking methodically in a room markedTOILETTES PUBLIQUES.\"Good,\" Fache said, lighting a cigarette and stalking into the hall. I've got aphone call to make. Be damned sure the rest room is the only place Langdongoes.\" CHAPTER 12Robert Langdon felt light-headed as he trudged toward the end of the GrandGallery. Sophie's phone message played over and over in his mind. At the end ofthe corridor, illuminated signs bearing the international stick-figure symbolsfor rest rooms guided him through a maze-like series of dividers displayingItalian drawings and hiding the rest rooms from sight.Finding the men's room door, Langdon entered and turned on the lights.The room was empty.Walking to the sink, he splashed cold water on his face and tried to wake up.Harsh fluorescent lights glared off the stark tile, and the room smelled ofammonia. As he toweled off, the rest room's door creaked open behind him. Hespun.Sophie Neveu entered, her green eyes flashing fear. \"Thank God you came. Wedon't have much time.\"Langdon stood beside the sinks, staring in bewilderment at DCPJ cryptographerSophie Neveu. Only minutes ago, Langdon had listened to her phone message,thinking the newly arrived cryptographer must be insane. And yet, the more helistened, the more he sensed Sophie Neveu was speaking in earnest. Do not reactto this message. Just listen calmly. You are in danger right now. Follow mydirections very closely. Filled with uncertainty, Langdon had decided to doexactly as Sophie advised. He told Fache that the phone message was regarding aninjured friend back home. Then he had asked to use the rest room at the end ofthe Grand Gallery.Sophie stood before him now, still catching her breath after doubling back tothe rest room. In the fluorescent lights, Langdon was surprised to see that herstrong air actually radiated from unexpectedly soft features. Only her gaze wassharp, and the juxtaposition conjured images of a multilayered Renoirportrait... veiled but distinct, with a boldness that somehow retained itsshroud of mystery.\"I wanted to warn you, Mr. Langdon...\" Sophie began, still catching her breath,\"that you are sous surveillance cachée. Under a guarded observation.\" As shespoke, her accented English resonated off the tile walls, giving her voice ahollow quality.\"But... why?\" Langdon demanded. Sophie had already given him an explanation onthe phone, but he wanted to hear it from her lips.\"Because,\" she said, stepping toward him, \"Fache's primary suspect in thismurder is you.\"Langdon was braced for the words, and yet they still sounded utterly ridiculous.According to Sophie, Langdon had been called to the Louvre tonight not as asymbologist but rather as a suspect and was currently the unwitting target ofone of DCPJ's favorite interrogation methods—surveillance cachée—a deftdeception in which the police calmly invited a suspect to a crime scene andinterviewed him in hopes he would get nervous and mistakenly incriminatehimself.\"Look in your jacket's left pocket,\" Sophie said. \"You'll find proof they arewatching you.\"Langdon felt his apprehension rising. Look in my pocket? It sounded like somekind of cheap magic trick.\"Just look.\"Bewildered, Langdon reached his hand into his tweed jacket's left pocket—one henever used. Feeling around inside, he found nothing. What the devil did youexpect? He began wondering if Sophie might just be insane after all. Then hisfingers brushed something unexpected. Small and hard. Pinching the tiny objectbetween his fingers, Langdon pulled it out and stared in astonishment. It was ametallic, button-shaped disk, about the size of a watch battery. He had neverseen it before. \"What the...?\"\"GPS tracking dot,\" Sophie said. \"Continuously transmits its location to aGlobal Positioning System satellite that DCPJ can monitor. We use them tomonitor people's locations. It's accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe.They have you on an electronic leash. The agent who picked you up at the hotelslipped it inside your pocket before you left your room.\"Langdon flashed back to the hotel room... his quick shower, getting dressed, theDCPJ agent politely holding out Langdon's tweed coat as they left the room. It'scool outside, Mr. Langdon, the agent had said. Spring in Paris is not all yoursong boasts. Langdon had thanked him and donned the jacket.Sophie's olive gaze was keen. \"I didn't tell you about the tracking dot earlierbecause I didn't want you checking your pocket in front of Fache. He can't knowyou've found it.\"Langdon had no idea how to respond.\"They tagged you with GPS because they thought you might run.\" She paused. \"Infact, they hoped you would run; it would make their case stronger.\"\"Why would I run!\" Langdon demanded. \"I'm innocent!\"\"Fache feels otherwise.\"Angrily, Langdon stalked toward the trash receptacle to dispose of the trackingdot.\"No!\" Sophie grabbed his arm and stopped him. \"Leave it in your pocket. If youthrow it out, the signal will stop moving, and they'll know you found the dot.The only reason Fache left you alone is because he can monitor where you are. Ifhe thinks you've discovered what he's doing...\" Sophie did not finish thethought. Instead, she pried the metallic disk from Langdon's hand and slid itback into the pocket of his tweed coat. \"The dot stays with you. At least forthe moment.\"Langdon felt lost. \"How the hell could Fache actually believe I killed JacquesSaunière!\"\"He has some fairly persuasive reasons to suspect you.\" Sophie's expression wasgrim. \"There is a piece of evidence here that you have not yet seen. Fache haskept it carefully hidden from you.\"Langdon could only stare.\"Do you recall the three lines of text that Saunière wrote on the floor?\"Langdon nodded. The numbers and words were imprinted on Langdon's mind.Sophie's voice dropped to a whisper now. \"Unfortunately, what you saw was notthe entire message. There was a fourth line that Fache photographed and thenwiped clean before you arrived.\"Although Langdon knew the soluble ink of a watermark stylus could easily bewiped away, he could not imagine why Fache would erase evidence.\"The last line of the message,\" Sophie said, \"was something Fache did not wantyou to know about.\" She paused. \"At least not until he was done with you.\"Sophie produced a computer printout of a photo from her sweater pocket and beganunfolding it. \"Fache uploaded images of the crime scene to the CryptologyDepartment earlier tonight in hopes we could figure out what Saunière's messagewas trying to say. This is a photo of the complete message.\" She handed the pageto Langdon.Bewildered, Langdon looked at the image. The close-up photo revealed the glowingmessage on the parquet floor. The final line hit Langdon like a kick in the gut. 13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5O, Draconian devil!Oh, lame saint!P.S. Find Robert Langdon CHAPTER 13For several seconds, Langdon stared in wonder at the photograph of Saunière'spostscript. P.S. Find Robert Langdon. He felt as if the floor were tiltingbeneath his feet. Saunière left a postscript with my name on it? In his wildestdreams, Langdon could not fathom why.\"Now do you understand,\" Sophie said, her eyes urgent, \"why Fache ordered youhere tonight, and why you are his primary suspect?\"The only thing Langdon understood at the moment was why Fache had looked so smugwhen Langdon suggested Saunière would have accused his killer by name.Find Robert Langdon.\"Why would Saunière write this?\" Langdon demanded, his confusion now giving wayto anger. \"Why would I want to kill Jacques Saunière?\"\"Fache has yet to uncover a motive, but he has been recording his entireconversation with you tonight in hopes you might reveal one.\"Langdon opened his mouth, but still no words came.\"He's fitted with a miniature microphone,\" Sophie explained. \"It's connected toa transmitter in his pocket that radios the signal back to the command post.\"\"This is impossible,\" Langdon stammered. \"I have an alibi. I went directly backto my hotel after my lecture. You can ask the hotel desk.\"\"Fache already did. His report shows you retrieving your room key from theconcierge at about ten-thirty. Unfortunately, the time of the murder was closerto eleven. You easily could have left your hotel room unseen.\"\"This is insanity! Fache has no evidence!\"Sophie's eyes widened as if to say: No evidence? \"Mr. Langdon, your name iswritten on the floor beside the body, and Saunière's date book says you werewith him at approximately the time of the murder.\" She paused. \"Fache has morethan enough evidence to take you into custody for questioning.\"Langdon suddenly sensed that he needed a lawyer. \"I didn't do this.\"Sophie sighed. \"This is not American television, Mr. Langdon. In France, thelaws protect the police, not criminals. Unfortunately, in this case, there isalso the media consideration. Jacques Saunière was a very prominent andwell-loved figure in Paris, and his murder will be news in the morning. Fachewill be under immediate pressure to make a statement, and he looks a lot betterhaving a suspect in custody already. Whether or not you are guilty, you mostcertainly will be held by DCPJ until they can figure out what really happened.\"Langdon felt like a caged animal. \"Why are you telling me all this?\"\"Because, Mr. Langdon, I believe you are innocent.\" Sophie looked away for amoment and then back into his eyes. \"And also because it is partially my faultthat you're in trouble.\"\"I'm sorry? It's your fault Saunière is trying to frame me?\"\"Saunière wasn't trying to frame you. It was a mistake. That message on thefloor was meant for me.\"Langdon needed a minute to process that one. \"I beg your pardon?\"\"That message wasn't for the police. He wrote it for me. I think he was forcedto do everything in such a hurry that he just didn't realize how it would lookto the police.\" She paused. \"The numbered code is meaningless. Saunière wrote itto make sure the investigation included cryptographers, ensuring that I wouldknow as soon as possible what had happened to him.\"Langdon felt himself losing touch fast. Whether or not Sophie Neveu had lost hermind was at this point up for grabs, but at least Langdon now understood why shewas trying to help him. P.S. Find Robert Langdon. She apparently believed thecurator had left her a cryptic postscript telling her to find Langdon. \"But whydo you think his message was for you?\"\"The Vitruvian Man,\" she said flatly. \"That particular sketch has always been myfavorite Da Vinci work. Tonight he used it to catch my attention.\"\"Hold on. You're saying the curator knew your favorite piece of art?\" Shenodded. \"I'm sorry. This is all coming out of order. Jacques Saunière and I...\"Sophie's voice caught, and Langdon heard a sudden melancholy there, a painfulpast, simmering just below the surface. Sophie and Jacques Saunière apparentlyhad some kind of special relationship. Langdon studied the beautiful young womanbefore him, well aware that aging men in France often took young mistresses.Even so, Sophie Neveu as a \"kept woman\" somehow didn't seem to fit.\"We had a falling-out ten years ago,\" Sophie said, her voice a whisper now.\"We've barely spoken since. Tonight, when Crypto got the call that he had beenmurdered, and I saw the images of his body and text on the floor, I realized hewas trying to send me a message.\"\"Because of The Vitruvian Man?\"\"Yes. And the letters P.S.\"\"Post Script?\"She shook her head. \"P.S. are my initials.\"\"But your name is Sophie Neveu.\"She looked away. \"P.S. is the nickname he called me when I lived with him.\" Sheblushed. \"It stood for Princesse Sophie\"Langdon had no response.\"Silly, I know,\" she said. \"But it was years ago. When I was a little girl.\"\"You knew him when you were a little girl?\"\"Quite well,\" she said, her eyes welling now with emotion. \"Jacques Saunière wasmy grandfather.\" CHAPTER 14\"Where's Langdon?\" Fache demanded, exhaling the last of a cigarette as he pacedback into the command post.\"Still in the men's room, sir.\" Lieutenant Collet had been expecting thequestion.Fache grumbled, \"Taking his time, I see.\"The captain eyed the GPS dot over Collet's shoulder, and Collet could almosthear the wheels turning. Fache was fighting the urge to go check on Langdon.Ideally, the subject of an observation was allowed the most time and freedompossible, lulling him into a false sense of security. Langdon needed to returnof his own volition. Still, it had been almost ten minutes.Too long.\"Any chance Langdon is onto us?\" Fache asked.Collet shook his head. \"We're still seeing small movements inside the men'sroom, so the GPS dot is obviously still on him. Perhaps he feels ill? If he hadfound the dot, he would have removed it and tried to run.\"Fache checked his watch. \"Fine.\"Still Fache seemed preoccupied. All evening, Collet had sensed an atypicalintensity in his captain. Usually detached and cool under pressure, Fachetonight seemed emotionally engaged, as if this were somehow a personal matterfor him.Not surprising, Collet thought. Fache needs this arrest desperately. Recentlythe Board of Ministers and the media had become more openly critical of Fache'saggressive tactics, his clashes with powerful foreign embassies, and his grossoverbudgeting on new technologies. Tonight, a high-tech, high-profile arrest ofan American would go a long way to silence Fache's critics, helping him securethe job a few more years until he could retire with the lucrative pension. Godknows he needs the pension, Collet thought. Fache's zeal for technology had hurthim both professionally and personally. Fache was rumored to have invested hisentire savings in the technology craze a few years back and lost his shirt. AndFache is a man who wears only the finest shirts.Tonight, there was still plenty of time. Sophie Neveu's odd interruption, thoughunfortunate, had been only a minor wrinkle. She was gone now, and Fache stillhad cards to play. He had yet to inform Langdon that his name had been scrawledon the floor by the victim. P.S. Find Robert Langdon. The American's reaction tothat little bit of evidence would be telling indeed.\"Captain?\" one of the DCPJ agents now called from across the office. \"I thinkyou better take this call.\" He was holding out a telephone receiver, lookingconcerned.\"Who is it?\" Fache said.The agent frowned. \"It's the director of our Cryptology Department.\"\"And?\"\"It's about Sophie Neveu, sir. Something is not quite right.\" CHAPTER 15It was time.Silas felt strong as he stepped from the black Audi, the nighttime breezerustling his loose-fitting robe. The winds of change are in the air. He knew thetask before him would require more finesse than force, and he left his handgunin the car. The thirteen-round Heckler Koch USP 40 had been provided by theTeacher.A weapon of death has no place in a house of God.The plaza before the great church was deserted at this hour, the only visiblesouls on the far side of Place Saint-Sulpice a couple of teenage hookers showingtheir wares to the late night tourist traffic. Their nubile bodies sent afamiliar longing to Silas's loins. His thigh flexed instinctively, causing thebarbed cilice belt to cut painfully into his flesh.The lust evaporated instantly. For ten years now, Silas had faithfully deniedhimself all sexual indulgence, even self-administered. It was The Way. He knewhe had sacrificed much to follow Opus Dei, but he had received much more inreturn. A vow of celibacy and the relinquishment of all personal assets hardlyseemed a sacrifice. Considering the poverty from which he had come and thesexual horrors he had endured in prison, celibacy was a welcome change.Now, having returned to France for the first time since being arrested andshipped to prison in Andorra, Silas could feel his homeland testing him,dragging violent memories from his redeemed soul. You have been reborn, hereminded himself. His service to God today had required the sin of murder, andit was a sacrifice Silas knew he would have to hold silently in his heart forall eternity.The measure of your faith is the measure of the pain you can endure, the Teacherhad told him. Silas was no stranger to pain and felt eager to prove himself tothe Teacher, the one who had assured him his actions were ordained by a higherpower.\"Hago la obra de Dios,\" Silas whispered, moving now toward the church entrance.Pausing in the shadow of the massive doorway, he took a deep breath. It was notuntil this instant that he truly realized what he was about to do, and whatawaited him inside.The keystone. It will lead us to our final goal.He raised his ghost-white fist and banged three times on the door.Moments later, the bolts of the enormous wooden portal began to move. CHAPTER 16Sophie wondered how long it would take Fache to figure out she had not left thebuilding. Seeing that Langdon was clearly overwhelmed, Sophie questioned whethershe had done the right thing by cornering him here in the men's room.What else was I supposed to do?She pictured her grandfather's body, naked and spread-eagle on the floor. Therewas a time when he had meant the world to her, yet tonight, Sophie was surprisedto feel almost no sadness for the man. Jacques Saunière was a stranger to hernow. Their relationship had evaporated in a single instant one March night whenshe was twenty-two. Ten years ago. Sophie had come home a few days early fromgraduate university in England and mistakenly witnessed her grandfather engagedin something Sophie was obviously not supposed to see. It was an image shebarely could believe to this day.If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes...Too ashamed and stunned to endure her grandfather's pained attempts to explain,Sophie immediately moved out on her own, taking money she had saved, and gettinga small flat with some roommates. She vowed never to speak to anyone about whatshe had seen. Her grandfather tried desperately to reach her, sending cards andletters, begging Sophie to meet him so he could explain. Explain how!? Sophienever responded except once—to forbid him ever to call her or try to meet her inpublic. She was afraid his explanation would be more terrifying than theincident itself.Incredibly, Saunière had never given up on her, and Sophie now possessed adecade's worth of correspondence unopened in a dresser drawer. To hergrandfather's credit, he had never once disobeyed her request and phoned her.Until this afternoon.\"Sophie?\" His voice had sounded startlingly old on her answering machine. \"Ihave abided by your wishes for so long... and it pains me to call, but I mustspeak to you. Something terrible has happened.\"Standing in the kitchen of her Paris flat, Sophie felt a chill to hear him againafter all these years. His gentle voice brought back a flood of fond childhoodmemories.\"Sophie, please listen.\" He was speaking English to her, as he always did whenshe was a little girl. Practice French at school. Practice English at home. \"Youcannot be mad forever. Have you not read the letters that I've sent all theseyears? Do you not yet understand?\" He paused. \"We must speak at once. Pleasegrant your grandfather this one wish. Call me at the Louvre. Right away. Ibelieve you and I are in grave danger.\" Sophie stared at the answering machine.Danger? What was he talking about?\"Princess...\" Her grandfather's voice cracked with an emotion Sophie could notplace. \"I know I've kept things from you, and I know it has cost me your love.But it was for your own safety. Now you must know the truth. Please, I must tellyou the truth about your family.\"Sophie suddenly could hear her own heart. My family? Sophie's parents had diedwhen she was only four. Their car went off a bridge into fast-moving water. Hergrandmother and younger brother had also been in the car, and Sophie's entirefamily had been erased in an instant. She had a box of newspaper clippings toconfirm it.His words had sent an unexpected surge of longing through her bones. My family!In that fleeting instant, Sophie saw images from the dream that had awoken hercountless times when she was a little girl: My family is alive! They are cominghome! But, as in her dream, the pictures evaporated into oblivion.Your family is dead, Sophie. They are not coming home.\"Sophie...\" her grandfather said on the machine. \"I have been waiting for yearsto tell you. Waiting for the right moment, but now time has run out. Call me atthe Louvre. As soon as you get this. I'll wait here all night. I fear we bothmay be in danger. There's so much you need to know.\"The message ended.In the silence, Sophie stood trembling for what felt like minutes. As sheconsidered her grandfather's message, only one possibility made sense, and histrue intent dawned.It was bait.Obviously, her grandfather wanted desperately to see her. He was tryinganything. Her disgust for the man deepened. Sophie wondered if maybe he hadfallen terminally ill and had decided to attempt any ploy he could think of toget Sophie to visit him one last time. If so, he had chosen wisely.My family.Now, standing in the darkness of the Louvre men's room, Sophie could hear theechoes of this afternoon's phone message. Sophie, we both may be in danger. Callme.She had not called him. Nor had she planned to. Now, however, her skepticism hadbeen deeply challenged. Her grandfather lay murdered inside his own museum. Andhe had written a code on the floor.A code for her. Of this, she was certain.Despite not understanding the meaning of his message, Sophie was certain itscryptic nature was additional proof that the words were intended for her.Sophie's passion and aptitude for cryptography were a product of growing up withJacques Saunière—a fanatic himself for codes, word games, and puzzles. How manySundays did we spend doing the cryptograms and crosswords in the newspaper?At the age of twelve, Sophie could finish the Le Monde crossword without anyhelp, and her grandfather graduated her to crosswords in English, mathematicalpuzzles, and substitution ciphers. Sophie devoured them all. Eventually sheturned her passion into a profession by becoming a codebreaker for the JudicialPolice.Tonight, the cryptographer in Sophie was forced to respect the efficiency withwhich her grandfather had used a simple code to unite two total strangers—SophieNeveu and Robert Langdon.The question was why?Unfortunately, from the bewildered look in Langdon's eyes, Sophie sensed theAmerican had no more idea than she did why her grandfather had thrown themtogether.She pressed again. \"You and my grandfather had planned to meet tonight. Whatabout?\"Langdon looked truly perplexed. \"His secretary set the meeting and didn't offerany specific reason, and I didn't ask. I assumed he'd heard I would be lecturingon the pagan iconography of French cathedrals, was interested in the topic, andthought it would be fun to meet for drinks after the talk.\"Sophie didn't buy it. The connection was flimsy. Her grandfather knew more aboutpagan iconography than anyone else on earth. Moreover, he an exceptionallyprivate man, not someone prone to chatting with random American professorsunless there were an important reason.Sophie took a deep breath and probed further. \"My grandfather called me thisafternoon and told me he and I were in grave danger. Does that mean anything toyou?\"Langdon's blue eyes now clouded with concern. \"No, but considering what justhappened...\"Sophie nodded. Considering tonight's events, she would be a fool not to befrightened. Feeling drained, she walked to the small plate-glass window at thefar end of the bathroom and gazed out in silence through the mesh of alarm tapeembedded in the glass. They were high up—forty feet at least.Sighing, she raised her eyes and gazed out at Paris's dazzling landscape. On herleft, across the Seine, the illuminated Eiffel Tower. Straight ahead, the Arc deTriomphe. And to the right, high atop the sloping rise of Montmartre, thegraceful arabesque dome of Sacré-Coeur, its polished stone glowing white like aresplendent sanctuary.Here at the westernmost tip of the Denon Wing, the north-south thoroughfare ofPlace du Carrousel ran almost flush with the building with only a narrowsidewalk separating it from the Louvre's outer wall. Far below, the usualcaravan of the city's nighttime delivery trucks sat idling, waiting for thesignals to change, their running lights seeming to twinkle mockingly up atSophie.\"I don't know what to say,\" Langdon said, coming up behind her. \"Yourgrandfather is obviously trying to tell us something. I'm sorry I'm so littlehelp.\"Sophie turned from the window, sensing a sincere regret in Langdon's deep voice.Even with all the trouble around him, he obviously wanted to help her. Theteacher in him, she thought, having read DCPJ's workup on their suspect. Thiswas an academic who clearly despised not understanding.We have that in common, she thought.As a codebreaker, Sophie made her living extracting meaning from seeminglysenseless data. Tonight, her best guess was that Robert Langdon, whether he knewit or not, possessed information that she desperately needed. Princesse Sophie,Find Robert Langdon. How much clearer could her grandfather's message be? Sophieneeded more time with Langdon. Time to think. Time to sort out this mysterytogether. Unfortunately, time was running out.Gazing up at Langdon, Sophie made the only play she could think of. \"Bezu Fachewill be taking you into custody at any minute. I can get you out of this museum.But we need to act now.\"Langdon's eyes went wide. \"You want me to run?\"\"It's the smartest thing you could do. If you let Fache take you into custodynow, you'll spend weeks in a French jail while DCPJ and the U.S. Embassy fightover which courts try your case. But if we get you out of here, and make it toyour embassy, then your government will protect your rights while you and Iprove you had nothing to do with this murder.\"Langdon looked not even vaguely convinced. \"Forget it! Fache has armed guards onevery single exit! Even if we escape without being shot, running away only makesme look guilty. You need to tell Fache that the message on the floor was foryou, and that my name is not there as an accusation.\"\"I will do that,\" Sophie said, speaking hurriedly, \"but after you're safelyinside the U.S. Embassy. It's only about a mile from here, and my car is parkedjust outside the museum. Dealing with Fache from here is too much of a gamble.Don't you see? Fache has made it his mission tonight to prove you are guilty.The only reason he postponed your arrest was to run this observance in hopes youdid something that made his case stronger.\"\"Exactly. Like running!\"The cell phone in Sophie's sweater pocket suddenly began ringing. Facheprobably. She reached in her sweater and turned off the phone.\"Mr. Langdon,\" she said hurriedly, \"I need to ask you one last question.\" Andyour entire future may depend on it. \"The writing on the floor is obviously notproof of your guilt, and yet Fache told our team he is certain you are his man.Can you think of any other reason he might be convinced you're guilty?\"Langdon was silent for several seconds. \"None whatsoever.\"Sophie sighed. Which means Fache is lying. Why, Sophie could not begin toimagine, but that was hardly the issue at this point. The fact remained thatBezu Fache was determined to put Robert Langdon behind bars tonight, at anycost. Sophie needed Langdon for herself, and it was this dilemma that leftSophie only one logical conclusion.I need to get Langdon to the U.S. Embassy.Turning toward the window, Sophie gazed through the alarm mesh embedded in theplate glass, down the dizzying forty feet to the pavement below. A leap fromthis height would leave Langdon with a couple of broken legs. At best.Nonetheless, Sophie made her decision.Robert Langdon was about to escape the Louvre, whether he wanted to or not. CHAPTER 17\"What do you mean she's not answering?\" Fache looked incredulous. \"You'recalling her cell phone, right? I know she's carrying it.\"Collet had been trying to reach Sophie now for several minutes. \"Maybe herbatteries are dead. Or her ringer's off.\"Fache had looked distressed ever since talking to the director of Cryptology onthe phone. After hanging up, he had marched over to Collet and demanded he getAgent Neveu on the line. Now Collet had failed, and Fache was pacing like acaged lion.\"Why did Crypto call?\" Collet now ventured.Fache turned. \"To tell us they found no references to Draconian devils and lamesaints.\"\"That's all?\"\"No, also to tell us that they had just identified the numerics as Fibonaccinumbers, but they suspected the series was meaningless.\"Collet was confused. \"But they already sent Agent Neveu to tell us that.\"Fache shook his head. \"They didn't send Neveu.\"\"What?\"\"According to the director, at my orders he paged his entire team to look at theimages I'd wired him. When Agent Neveu arrived, she took one look at the photosof Saunière and the code and left the office without a word. The director saidhe didn't question her behavior because she was understandably upset by thephotos.\"\"Upset? She's never seen a picture of a dead body?\"Fache was silent a moment. \"I was not aware of this, and it seems neither wasthe director until a coworker informed him, but apparently Sophie Neveu isJacques Saunière's granddaughter.\"Collet was speechless.\"The director said she never once mentioned Saunière to him, and he assumed itwas because she probably didn't want preferential treatment for having a famousgrandfather.\"No wonder she was upset by the pictures. Collet could barely conceive of theunfortunate coincidence that called in a young woman to decipher a code writtenby a dead family member. Still, her actions made no sense. \"But she obviouslyrecognized the numbers as Fibonacci numbers because she came here and told us. Idon't understand why she would leave the office without telling anyone she hadfigured it out.\"Collet could think of only one scenario to explain the troubling developments:Saunière had written a numeric code on the floor in hopes Fache would involvecryptographers in the investigation, and therefore involve his owngranddaughter. As for the rest of the message, was Saunière communicating insome way with his granddaughter? If so, what did the message tell her? And howdid Langdon fit in?Before Collet could ponder it any further, the silence of the deserted museumwas shattered by an alarm. The bell sounded like it was coming from inside theGrand Gallery.\"Alarme!\" one of the agents yelled, eyeing his feed from the Louvre securitycenter. \"Grande Galerie! Toilettes Messieurs!\"Fache wheeled to Collet. \"Where's Langdon?\"\"Still in the men's room!\" Collet pointed to the blinking red dot on his laptopschematic. \"He must have broken the window!\" Collet knew Langdon wouldn't getfar. Although Paris fire codes required windows above fifteen meters in publicbuildings be breakable in case of fire, exiting a Louvre second-story windowwithout the help of a hook and ladder would be suicide. Furthermore, there wereno trees or grass on the western end of the Denon Wing to cushion a fall.Directly beneath that rest room window, the two-lane Place du Carrousel ranwithin a few feet of the outer wall. \"My God,\" Collet exclaimed, eyeing thescreen. \"Langdon's moving to the window ledge!\"But Fache was already in motion. Yanking his Manurhin MR-93 revolver from hisshoulder holster, the captain dashed out of the office.Collet watched the screen in bewilderment as the blinking dot arrived at thewindow ledge and then did something utterly unexpected. The dot moved outsidethe perimeter of the building.What's going on? he wondered. Is Langdon out on a ledge or—\"Jesu!\" Collet jumped to his feet as the dot shot farther outside the wall. Thesignal seemed to shudder for a moment, and then the blinking dot came to anabrupt stop about ten yards outside the perimeter of the building.Fumbling with the controls, Collet called up a Paris street map and recalibratedthe GPS. Zooming in, he could now see the exact location of the signal.It was no longer moving.It lay at a dead stop in the middle of Place du Carrousel.Langdon had jumped. CHAPTER 18Fache sprinted down the Grand Gallery as Collet's radio blared over the distantsound of the alarm.\"He jumped!\" Collet was yelling. \"I'm showing the signal out on Place duCarrousel! Outside the bathroom window! And it's not moving at all! Jesus, Ithink Langdon has just committed suicide!\"Fache heard the words, but they made no sense. He kept running. The hallwayseemed never-ending. As he sprinted past Saunière's body, he set his sights onthe partitions at the far end of the Denon Wing. The alarm was getting loudernow.\"Wait!\" Collet's voice blared again over the radio. \"He's moving! My God, he'salive. Langdon's moving!\"Fache kept running, cursing the length of the hallway with every step.\"Langdon's moving faster!\" Collet was still yelling on the radio. \"He's runningdown Carrousel. Wait... he's picking up speed. He's moving too fast!\"Arriving at the partitions, Fache snaked his way through them, saw the rest roomdoor, and ran for it.The walkie-talkie was barely audible now over the alarm. \"He must be in a car! Ithink he's in a car! I can't—\"Collet's words were swallowed by the alarm as Fache finally burst into the men'sroom with his gun drawn. Wincing against the piercing shrill, he scanned thearea.The stalls were empty. The bathroom deserted. Fache's eyes moved immediately tothe shattered window at the far end of the room. He ran to the opening andlooked over the edge. Langdon was nowhere to be seen. Fache could not imagineanyone risking a stunt like this. Certainly if he had dropped that far, he wouldbe badly injured.The alarm cut off finally, and Collet's voice became audible again over thewalkie-talkie.\"...moving south... faster... crossing the Seine on Pont du Carrousel!\"Fache turned to his left. The only vehicle on Pont du Carrousel was an enormoustwin-bed Trailor delivery truck moving southward away from the Louvre. Thetruck's open-air bed was covered with a vinyl tarp, roughly resembling a gianthammock. Fache felt a shiver of apprehension. That truck, only moments ago, hadprobably been stopped at a red light directly beneath the rest room window.An insane risk, Fache told himself. Langdon had no way of knowing what the truckwas carrying beneath that tarp. What if the truck were carrying steel? Orcement? Or even garbage? A forty-foot leap? It was madness.\"The dot is turning!\" Collet called. \"He's turning right on Pont desSaints-Peres!\"Sure enough, the Trailor truck that had crossed the bridge was slowing down andmaking a right turn onto Pont des Saints-Peres. So be it, Fache thought. Amazed,he watched the truck disappear around the corner. Collet was already radioingthe agents outside, pulling them off the Louvre perimeter and sending them totheir patrol cars in pursuit, all the while broadcasting the truck's changinglocation like some kind of bizarre play-by-play.It's over, Fache knew. His men would have the truck surrounded within minutes.Langdon was not going anywhere.Stowing his weapon, Fache exited the rest room and radioed Collet. \"Bring my cararound. I want to be there when we make the arrest.\"As Fache jogged back down the length of the Grand Gallery, he wondered ifLangdon had even survived the fall.Not that it mattered.Langdon ran. Guilty as charged. Only fifteen yards from the rest room, Langdon and Sophie stood in the darknessof the Grand Gallery, their backs pressed to one of the large partitions thathid the bathrooms from the gallery. They had barely managed to hide themselvesbefore Fache had darted past them, gun drawn, and disappeared into the bathroom.The last sixty seconds had been a blur.Langdon had been standing inside the men's room refusing to run from a crime hedidn't commit, when Sophie began eyeing the plate-glass window and examining thealarm mesh running through it. Then she peered downward into the street, as ifmeasuring the drop.\"With a little aim, you can get out of here,\" she said.Aim? Uneasy, he peered out the rest room window.Up the street, an enormous twin-bed eighteen-wheeler was headed for thestoplight beneath the window. Stretched across the truck's massive cargo bay wasa blue vinyl tarp, loosely covering the truck's load. Langdon hoped Sophie wasnot thinking what she seemed to be thinking.\"Sophie, there's no way I'm jump—\"\"Take out the tracking dot.\"Bewildered, Langdon fumbled in his pocket until he found the tiny metallic disk.Sophie took it from him and strode immediately to the sink. She grabbed a thickbar of soap, placed the tracking dot on top of it, and used her thumb to pushthe disk down hard into the bar. As the disk sank into the soft surface, shepinched the hole closed, firmly embedding the device in the bar.Handing the bar to Langdon, Sophie retrieved a heavy, cylindrical trash can fromunder the sinks. Before Langdon could protest, Sophie ran at the window, holdingthe can before her like a battering ram. Driving the bottom of the trash caninto the center of the window, she shattered the glass.Alarms erupted overhead at earsplitting decibel levels.\"Give me the soap!\" Sophie yelled, barely audible over the alarm.Langdon thrust the bar into her hand.Palming the soap, she peered out the shattered window at the eighteen-wheeleridling below. The target was plenty big—an expansive, stationary tarp—and it wasless than ten feet from the side of the building. As the traffic lights preparedto change, Sophie took a deep breath and lobbed the bar of soap out into thenight.The soap plummeted downward toward the truck, landing on the edge of the tarp,and sliding downward into the cargo bay just as the traffic light turned green.\"Congratulations,\" Sophie said, dragging him toward the door. \"You just escapedfrom the Louvre.\"Fleeing the men's room, they moved into the shadows just as Fache rushed past. Now, with the fire alarm silenced, Langdon could hear the sounds of DCPJ sirenstearing away from the Louvre. A police exodus. Fache had hurried off as well,leaving the Grand Gallery deserted.\"There's an emergency stairwell about fifty meters back into the Grand Gallery,\"Sophie said. \"Now that the guards are leaving the perimeter, we can get out ofhere.\"Langdon decided not to say another word all evening. Sophie Neveu was clearly ahell of a lot smarter than he was. CHAPTER 19The Church of Saint-Sulpice, it is said, has the most eccentric history of anybuilding in Paris. Built over the ruins of an ancient temple to the Egyptiangoddess Isis, the church possesses an architectural footprint matching that ofNotre Dame to within inches. The sanctuary has played host to the baptisms ofthe Marquis de Sade and Baudelaire, as well as the marriage of Victor Hugo. Theattached seminary has a well-documented history of unorthodoxy and was once theclandestine meeting hall for numerous secret societies.Tonight, the cavernous nave of Saint-Sulpice was as silent as a tomb, the onlyhint of life the faint smell of incense from mass earlier that evening. Silassensed an uneasiness in Sister Sandrine's demeanor as she led him into thesanctuary. He was not surprised by this. Silas was accustomed to people beinguncomfortable with his appearance.\"You're an American,\" she said.\"French by birth,\" Silas responded. \"I had my calling in Spain, and I now studyin the United States.\"Sister Sandrine nodded. She was a small woman with quiet eyes. \"And you havenever seen Saint-Sulpice?\"\"I realize this is almost a sin in itself.\"\"She is more beautiful by day.\"\"I am certain. Nonetheless, I am grateful that you would provide me thisopportunity tonight.\"\"The abbé requested it. You obviously have powerful friends.\"You have no idea, Silas thought.As he followed Sister Sandrine down the main aisle, Silas was surprised by theausterity of the sanctuary. Unlike Notre Dame with its colorful frescoes, gildedaltar-work, and warm wood, Saint-Sulpice was stark and cold, conveying an almostbarren quality reminiscent of the ascetic cathedrals of Spain. The lack of decormade the interior look even more expansive, and as Silas gazed up into thesoaring ribbed vault of the ceiling, he imagined he was standing beneath thehull of an enormous overturned ship.A fitting image, he thought. The brotherhood's ship was about to be capsizedforever. Feeling eager to get to work, Silas wished Sister Sandrine would leavehim. She was a small woman whom Silas could incapacitate easily, but he hadvowed not to use force unless absolutely necessary. She is a woman of the cloth,and it is not her fault the brotherhood chose her church as a hiding place fortheir keystone. She should not be punished for the sins of others.\"I am embarrassed, Sister, that you were awoken on my behalf.\"\"Not at all. You are in Paris a short time. You should not miss Saint-Sulpice.Are your interests in the church more architectural or historical?\"\"Actually, Sister, my interests are spiritual.\"She gave a pleasant laugh. \"That goes without saying. I simply wondered where tobegin your tour.\"Silas felt his eyes focus on the altar. \"A tour is unnecessary. You have beenmore than kind. I can show myself around.\"\"It is no trouble,\" she said. \"After all, I am awake.\"Silas stopped walking. They had reached the front pew now, and the altar wasonly fifteen yards away. He turned his massive body fully toward the smallwoman, and he could sense her recoil as she gazed up into his red eyes. \"If itdoes not seem too rude, Sister, I am not accustomed to simply walking into ahouse of God and taking a tour. Would you mind if I took some time alone to praybefore I look around?\"Sister Sandrine hesitated. \"Oh, of course. I shall wait in the rear of thechurch for you.\"Silas put a soft but heavy hand on her shoulder and peered down. \"Sister, I feelguilty already for having awoken you. To ask you to stay awake is too much.Please, you should return to bed. I can enjoy your sanctuary and then let myselfout.\"She looked uneasy. \"Are you sure you won't feel abandoned?\"\"Not at all. Prayer is a solitary joy.\"\"As you wish.\"Silas took his hand from her shoulder. \"Sleep well, Sister. May the peace of theLord be with you.\"\"And also with you.\" Sister Sandrine headed for the stairs. \"Please be sure thedoor closes tightly on your way out.\"\"I will be sure of it.\" Silas watched her climb out of sight. Then he turned andknelt in the front pew, feeling the cilice cut into his leg.Dear God, I offer up to you this work I do today.... Crouching in the shadows of the choir balcony high above the altar, SisterSandrine peered silently through the balustrade at the cloaked monk kneelingalone. The sudden dread in her soul made it hard to stay still. For a fleetinginstant, she wondered if this mysterious visitor could be the enemy they hadwarned her about, and if tonight she would have to carry out the orders she hadbeen holding all these years. She decided to stay there in the darkness andwatch his every move. CHAPTER 20Emerging from the shadows, Langdon and Sophie moved stealthily up the desertedGrand Gallery corridor toward the emergency exit stairwell.As he moved, Langdon felt like he was trying to assemble a jigsaw puzzle in thedark. The newest aspect of this mystery was a deeply troubling one: The captainof the Judicial Police is trying to frame me for murder\"Do you think,\" he whispered, \"that maybe Fache wrote that message on thefloor?\"Sophie didn't even turn. \"Impossible.\"Langdon wasn't so sure. \"He seems pretty intent on making me look guilty. Maybehe thought writing my name on the floor would help his case?\"\"The Fibonacci sequence? The P.S.? All the Da Vinci and goddess symbolism? Thathad to be my grandfather.\"Langdon knew she was right. The symbolism of the clues meshed too perfectly—thepentacle, The Vitruvian Man, Da Vinci, the goddess, and even the Fibonaccisequence. A coherent symbolic set, as iconographers would call it. Allinextricably tied.\"And his phone call to me this afternoon,\" Sophie added. \"He said he had to tellme something. I'm certain his message at the Louvre was his final effort to tellme something important, something he thought you could help me understand.\"Langdon frowned. O, Draconian devil! Oh, lame saint.! He wished he couldcomprehend the message, both for Sophie's well-being and for his own. Things haddefinitely gotten worse since he first laid eyes on the cryptic words. His fakeleap out the bathroom window was not going to help Langdon's popularity withFache one bit. Somehow he doubted the captain of the French police would see thehumor in chasing down and arresting a bar of soap.\"The doorway isn't much farther,\" Sophie said.\"Do you think there's a possibility that the numbers in your grandfather'smessage hold the key to understanding the other lines?\" Langdon had once workedon a series of Baconian manuscripts that contained epigraphical ciphers in whichcertain lines of code were clues as to how to decipher the other lines.\"I've been thinking about the numbers all night. Sums, quotients, products. Idon't see anything. Mathematically, they're arranged at random. Cryptographicgibberish.\"\"And yet they're all part of the Fibonacci sequence. That can't be coincidence.\"\"It's not. Using Fibonacci numbers was my grandfather's way of waving anotherflag at me—like writing the message in English, or arranging himself like myfavorite piece of art, or drawing a pentacle on himself. All of it was to catchmy attention.\"\"The pentacle has meaning to you?\"\"Yes. I didn't get a chance to tell you, but the pentacle was a special symbolbetween my grandfather and me when I was growing up. We used to play Tarot cardsfor fun, and my indicator card always turned out to be from the suit ofpentacles. I'm sure he stacked the deck, but pentacles got to be our littlejoke.\"Langdon felt a chill. They played Tarot? The medieval Italian card game was soreplete with hidden heretical symbolism that Langdon had dedicated an entirechapter in his new manuscript to the Tarot. The game's twenty-two cards borenames like The Female Pope, The Empress, and The Star. Originally, Tarot hadbeen devised as a secret means to pass along ideologies banned by the Church.Now, Tarot's mystical qualities were passed on by modern fortune-tellers.The Tarot indicator suit for feminine divinity is pentacles, Langdon thought,realizing that if Saunière had been stacking his granddaughter's deck for fun,pentacles was an apropos inside joke.They arrived at the emergency stairwell, and Sophie carefully pulled open thedoor. No alarm sounded. Only the doors to the outside were wired. Sophie ledLangdon down a tight set of switchback stairs toward the ground level, pickingup speed as they went.\"Your grandfather,\" Langdon said, hurrying behind her, \"when he told you aboutthe pentacle, did he mention goddess worship or any resentment of the CatholicChurch?\"Sophie shook her head. \"I was more interested in the mathematics of it—theDivine Proportion, PHI, Fibonacci sequences, that sort of thing.\"Langdon was surprised. \"Your grandfather taught you about the number PHI?\"\"Of course. The Divine Proportion.\" Her expression turned sheepish. \"In fact, heused to joke that I was half divine... you know, because of the letters in myname.\"Langdon considered it a moment and then groaned.s-o-PHI-e.Still descending, Langdon refocused on PHI. He was starting to realize thatSaunière's clues were even more consistent than he had first imagined.Da Vinci... Fibonacci numbers... the pentacle.Incredibly, all of these things were connected by a single concept sofundamental to art history that Langdon often spent several class periods on thetopic.PHI.He felt himself suddenly reeling back to Harvard, standing in front of his\"Symbolism in Art\" class, writing his favorite number on the chalkboard.1.618Langdon turned to face his sea of eager students. \"Who can tell me what thisnumber is?\"A long-legged math major in back raised his hand. \"That's the number PHI.\" Hepronounced it fee.\"Nice job, Stettner,\" Langdon said. \"Everyone, meet PHI.\"\"Not to be confused with PI,\" Stettner added, grinning. \"As we mathematicianslike to say: PHI is one H of a lot cooler than PI!\"Langdon laughed, but nobody else seemed to get the joke.Stettner slumped.\"This number PHI,\" Langdon continued, \"one-point-six-one-eight, is a veryimportant number in art. Who can tell me why?\"Stettner tried to redeem himself. \"Because it's so pretty?\"Everyone laughed.\"Actually,\" Langdon said, \"Stettner's right again. PHI is generally consideredthe most beautiful number in the universe.\"The laughter abruptly stopped, and Stettner gloated.As Langdon loaded his slide projector, he explained that the number PHI wasderived from the Fibonacci sequence—a progression famous not only because thesum of adjacent terms equaled the next term, but because the quotients ofadjacent terms possessed the astonishing property of approaching the number1.618—PHI!Despite PHI's seemingly mystical mathematical origins, Langdon explained, thetruly mind-boggling aspect of PHI was its role as a fundamental building blockin nature. Plants, animals, and even human beings all possessed dimensionalproperties that adhered with eerie exactitude to the ratio of PHI to 1.\"PHI's ubiquity in nature,\" Langdon said, killing the lights, \"clearly exceedscoincidence, and so the ancients assumed the number PHI must have beenpreordained by the Creator of the universe. Early scientists heraldedone-point-six-one-eight as the Divine Proportion.\"\"Hold on,\" said a young woman in the front row. \"I'm a bio major and I've neverseen this Divine Proportion in nature.\"\"No?\" Langdon grinned. \"Ever study the relationship between females and males ina honeybee community?\"\"Sure. The female bees always outnumber the male bees.\"\"Correct. And did you know that if you divide the number of female bees by thenumber of male bees in any beehive in the world, you always get the samenumber?\"\"You do?\"\"Yup. PHI.\"The girl gaped. \"NO WAY!\"\"Way!\" Langdon fired back, smiling as he projected a slide of a spiral seashell.\"Recognize this?\"\"It's a nautilus,\" the bio major said. \"A cephalopod mollusk that pumps gas intoits chambered shell to adjust its buoyancy.\"\"Correct. And can you guess what the ratio is of each spiral's diameter to thenext?\"The girl looked uncertain as she eyed the concentric arcs of the nautilusspiral.Langdon nodded. \"PHI. The Divine Proportion. One-point-six-one-eight to one.\"The girl looked amazed.Langdon advanced to the next slide—a close-up of a sunflower's seed head.\"Sunflower seeds grow in opposing spirals. Can you guess the ratio of eachrotation's diameter to the next?\"\"PHI?\" everyone said.\"Bingo.\" Langdon began racing through slides now—spiraled pinecone petals, leafarrangement on plant stalks, insect segmentation—all displaying astonishingobedience to the Divine Proportion.\"This is amazing!\" someone cried out.\"Yeah,\" someone else said, \"but what does it have to do with art?\"\"Aha!\" Langdon said. \"Glad you asked.\" He pulled up another slide—a pale yellowparchment displaying Leonardo da Vinci's famous male nude—The VitruvianMan—named for Marcus Vitruvius, the brilliant Roman architect who praised theDivine Proportion in his text De Architectura.\"Nobody understood better than Da Vinci the divine structure of the human body.Da Vinci actually exhumed corpses to measure the exact proportions of human bonestructure. He was the first to show that the human body is literally made ofbuilding blocks whose proportional ratios always equal PHI.\"Everyone in class gave him a dubious look.\"Don't believe me?\" Langdon challenged. \"Next time you're in the shower, take atape measure.\"A couple of football players snickered.\"Not just you insecure jocks,\" Langdon prompted. \"All of you. Guys and girls.Try it. Measure the distance from the tip of your head to the floor. Then dividethat by the distance from your belly button to the floor. Guess what number youget.\"\"Not PHI!\" one of the jocks blurted out in disbelief.\"Yes, PHI,\" Langdon replied. \"One-point-six-one-eight. Want another example?Measure the distance from your shoulder to your fingertips, and then divide itby the distance from your elbow to your fingertips. PHI again. Another? Hip tofloor divided by knee to floor. PHI again. Finger joints. Toes. Spinaldivisions. PHI. PHI. PHI. My friends, each of you is a walking tribute to theDivine Proportion.\"Even in the darkness, Langdon could see they were all astounded. He felt afamiliar warmth inside. This is why he taught. \"My friends, as you can see, thechaos of the world has an underlying order. When the ancients discovered PHI,they were certain they had stumbled across God's building block for the world,and they worshipped Nature because of that. And one can understand why. God'shand is evident in Nature, and even to this day there exist pagan, MotherEarth-revering religions. Many of us celebrate nature the way the pagans did,and don't even know it. May Day is a perfect example, the celebration ofspring... the earth coming back to life to produce her bounty. The mysteriousmagic inherent in the Divine Proportion was written at the beginning of time.Man is simply playing by Nature's rules, and because art is man's attempt toimitate the beauty of the Creator's hand, you can imagine we might be seeing alot of instances of the Divine Proportion in art this semester.\"Over the next half hour, Langdon showed them slides of artwork by Michelangelo,Albrecht Dürer, Da Vinci, and many others, demonstrating each artist'sintentional and rigorous adherence to the Divine Proportion in the layout of hiscompositions. Langdon unveiled PHI in the architectural dimensions of the GreekParthenon, the pyramids of Egypt, and even the United Nations Building in NewYork. PHI appeared in the organizational structures of Mozart's sonatas,Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, as well as the works of Bartók, Debussy, andSchubert. The number PHI, Langdon told them, was even used by Stradivarius tocalculate the exact placement of the f-holes in the construction of his famousviolins.\"In closing,\" Langdon said, walking to the chalkboard, \"we return to symbols\" Hedrew five intersecting lines that formed a five-pointed star. \"This symbol isone of the most powerful images you will see this term. Formally known as apentagram—or pentacle, as the ancients called it—this symbol is considered bothdivine and magical by many cultures. Can anyone tell me why that might be?\"Stettner, the math major, raised his hand. \"Because if you draw a pentagram, thelines automatically divide themselves into segments according to the DivineProportion.\"Langdon gave the kid a proud nod. \"Nice job. Yes, the ratios of line segments ina pentacle all equal PHI, making this symbol the ultimate expression of theDivine Proportion. For this reason, the five-pointed star has always been thesymbol for beauty and perfection associated with the goddess and the sacredfeminine.\"The girls in class beamed.\"One note, folks. We've only touched on Da Vinci today, but we'll be seeing alot more of him this semester. Leonardo was a well-documented devotee of theancient ways of the goddess. Tomorrow, I'll show you his fresco The Last Supper,which is one of the most astonishing tributes to the sacred feminine you willever see.\"\"You're kidding, right?\" somebody said. \"I thought The Last Supper was aboutJesus!\"Langdon winked. \"There are symbols hidden in places you would never imagine.\" \"Come on,\" Sophie whispered. \"What's wrong? We're almost there. Hurry!\"Langdon glanced up, feeling himself return from faraway thoughts. He realized hewas standing at a dead stop on the stairs, paralyzed by sudden revelation.O, Draconian devil! Oh, lame saint!Sophie was looking back at him.It can't be that simple, Langdon thought.But he knew of course that it was.There in the bowels of the Louvre... with images of PHI and Da Vinci swirlingthrough his mind, Robert Langdon suddenly and unexpectedly deciphered Saunière'scode.\"O, Draconian devil!\" he said. \"Oh, lame saint! It's the simplest kind of code!\" Sophie was stopped on the stairs below him, staring up in confusion. A code? Shehad been pondering the words all night and had not seen a code. Especially asimple one.\"You said it yourself.\" Langdon's voice reverberated with excitement. \"Fibonaccinumbers only have meaning in their proper order. Otherwise they're mathematicalgibberish.\"Sophie had no idea what he was talking about. The Fibonacci numbers? She wascertain they had been intended as nothing more than a means to get theCryptography Department involved tonight. They have another purpose? She plungedher hand into her pocket and pulled out the printout, studying her grandfather'smessage again. 13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5O, Draconian devil!Oh, lame saint! What about the numbers?\"The scrambled Fibonacci sequence is a clue,\" Langdon said, taking the printout.\"The numbers are a hint as to how to decipher the rest of the message. He wrotethe sequence out of order to tell us to apply the same concept to the text. O,Draconian devil? Oh, lame saint? Those lines mean nothing. They are simplyletters written out of order.\"Sophie needed only an instant to process Langdon's implication, and it seemedlaughably simple. \"You think this message is... une anagramme?\" She stared athim. \"Like a word jumble from a newspaper?\"Langdon could see the skepticism on Sophie's face and certainly understood. Fewpeople realized that anagrams, despite being a trite modern amusement, had arich history of sacred symbolism.The mystical teachings of the Kabbala drew heavily on anagrams—rearranging theletters of Hebrew words to derive new meanings. French kings throughout theRenaissance were so convinced that anagrams held magic power that they appointedroyal anagrammatists to help them make better decisions by analyzing words inimportant documents. The Romans actually referred to the study of anagrams asars magna—\"the great art.\"Langdon looked up at Sophie, locking eyes with her now. \"Your grandfather'smeaning was right in front of us all along, and he left us more than enoughclues to see it.\"Without another word, Langdon pulled a pen from his jacket pocket and rearrangedthe letters in each line. O, Draconian devil!Oh, lame saint! was a perfect anagram of... Leonardo da Vinci!The Mona Lisa! CHAPTER 21The Mona Lisa.For an instant, standing in the exit stairwell, Sophie forgot all about tryingto leave the Louvre.Her shock over the anagram was matched only by her embarrassment at not havingdeciphered the message herself. Sophie's expertise in complex cryptanalysis hadcaused her to overlook simplistic word games, and yet she knew she should haveseen it. After all, she was no stranger to anagrams—especially in English.When she was young, often her grandfather would use anagram games to hone herEnglish spelling. Once he had written the English word \"planets\" and told Sophiethat an astonishing sixty-two other English words of varying lengths could beformed using those same letters. Sophie had spent three days with an Englishdictionary until she found them all.\"I can't imagine,\" Langdon said, staring at the printout, \"how your grandfathercreated such an intricate anagram in the minutes before he died.\"Sophie knew the explanation, and the realization made her feel even worse. Ishould have seen this! She now recalled that her grandfather—a wordplayaficionado and art lover—had entertained himself as a young man by creatinganagrams of famous works of art. In fact, one of his anagrams had gotten him introuble once when Sophie was a little girl. While being interviewed by anAmerican art magazine, Saunière had expressed his distaste for the modernistCubist movement by noting that Picasso's masterpiece Les Demoiselles d'Avignonwas a perfect anagram of vile meaningless doodles. Picasso fans were not amused.\"My grandfather probably created this Mona Lisa anagram long ago,\" Sophie said,glancing up at Langdon. And tonight he was forced to use it as a makeshift code.Her grandfather's voice had called out from beyond with chilling precision.Leonardo da Vinci!The Mona Lisa!Why his final words to her referenced the famous painting, Sophie had no idea,but she could think of only one possibility. A disturbing one.Those were not his final words....Was she supposed to visit the Mona Lisa? Had her grandfather left her a messagethere? The idea seemed perfectly plausible. After all, the famous painting hungin the Salle des Etats—a private viewing chamber accessible only from the GrandGallery. In fact, Sophie now realized, the doors that opened into the chamberwere situated only twenty meters from where her grandfather had been found dead.He easily could have visited the Mona Lisa before he died.Sophie gazed back up the emergency stairwell and felt torn. She knew she shouldusher Langdon from the museum immediately, and yet instinct urged her to thecontrary. As Sophie recalled her first childhood visit to the Denon Wing, sherealized that if her grandfather had a secret to tell her, few places on earthmade a more apt rendezvous than Da Vinci's Mona Lisa. \"She's just a little bit farther,\" her grandfather had whispered, clutchingSophie's tiny hand as he led her through the deserted museum after hours.Sophie was six years old. She felt small and insignificant as she gazed up atthe enormous ceilings and down at the dizzying floor. The empty museumfrightened her, although she was not about to let her grandfather know that. Sheset her jaw firmly and let go of his hand.\"Up ahead is the Salle des Etats,\" her grandfather said as they approached theLouvre's most famous room. Despite her grandfather's obvious excitement, Sophiewanted to go home. She had seen pictures of the Mona Lisa in books and didn'tlike it at all. She couldn't understand why everyone made such a fuss.\"C'est ennuyeux,\" Sophie grumbled.\"Boring,\" he corrected. \"French at school. English at home.\"\"Le Louvre, c'est pas chez moi!\" she challenged.He gave her a tired laugh. \"Right you are. Then let's speak English just forfun.\"Sophie pouted and kept walking. As they entered the Salle des Etats, her eyesscanned the narrow room and settled on the obvious spot of honor—the center ofthe right-hand wall, where a lone portrait hung behind a protective Plexiglaswall. Her grandfather paused in the doorway and motioned toward the painting.\"Go ahead, Sophie. Not many people get a chance to visit her alone.\"Swallowing her apprehension, Sophie moved slowly across the room. Aftereverything she'd heard about the Mona Lisa, she felt as if she were approachingroyalty. Arriving in front of the protective Plexiglas, Sophie held her breathand looked up, taking it in all at once.Sophie was not sure what she had expected to feel, but it most certainly was notthis. No jolt of amazement. No instant of wonder. The famous face looked as itdid in books. She stood in silence for what felt like forever, waiting forsomething to happen.\"So what do you think?\" her grandfather whispered, arriving behind her.\"Beautiful, yes?\"\"She's too little.\"Saunière smiled. \"You're little and you're beautiful.\"I am not beautiful, she thought. Sophie hated her red hair and freckles, and shewas bigger than all the boys in her class. She looked back at the Mona Lisa andshook her head. \"She's even worse than in the books. Her face is... brumeux.\"\"Foggy,\" her grandfather tutored.\"Foggy,\" Sophie repeated, knowing the conversation would not continue until sherepeated her new vocabulary word.\"That's called the sfumato style of painting,\" he told her, \"and it's very hardto do. Leonardo da Vinci was better at it than anyone.\"Sophie still didn't like the painting. \"She looks like she knows something...like when kids at school have a secret.\"Her grandfather laughed. \"That's part of why she is so famous. People like toguess why she is smiling.\"\"Do you know why she's smiling?\"\"Maybe.\" Her grandfather winked. \"Someday I'll tell you all about it.\"Sophie stamped her foot. \"I told you I don't like secrets!\"\"Princess,\" he smiled. \"Life is filled with secrets. You can't learn them all atonce.\" \"I'm going back up,\" Sophie declared, her voice hollow in the stairwell.\"To the Mona Lisa?\" Langdon recoiled. \"Now?\"Sophie considered the risk. \"I'm not a murder suspect. I'll take my chances. Ineed to understand what my grandfather was trying to tell me.\"\"What about the embassy?\"Sophie felt guilty turning Langdon into a fugitive only to abandon him, but shesaw no other option. She pointed down the stairs to a metal door. \"Go throughthat door, and follow the illuminated exit signs. My grandfather used to bringme down here. The signs will lead you to a security turnstile. It'smonodirectional and opens out.\" She handed Langdon her car keys. \"Mine is thered SmartCar in the employee lot. Directly outside this bulkhead. Do you knowhow to get to the embassy?\"Langdon nodded, eyeing the keys in his hand.\"Listen,\" Sophie said, her voice softening. \"I think my grandfather may haveleft me a message at the Mona Lisa—some kind of clue as to who killed him. Orwhy I'm in danger.\" Or what happened to my family. \"I have to go see.\"\"But if he wanted to tell you why you were in danger, why wouldn't he simplywrite it on the floor where he died? Why this complicated word game?\"\"Whatever my grandfather was trying to tell me, I don't think he wanted anyoneelse to hear it. Not even the police.\" Clearly, her grandfather had doneeverything in his power to send a confidential transmission directly to her. Hehad written it in code, included her secret initials, and told her to findRobert Langdon—a wise command, considering the American symbologist haddeciphered his code. \"As strange as it may sound,\" Sophie said, \"I think hewants me to get to the Mona Lisa before anyone else does.\"\"I'll come.\"\"No! We don't know how long the Grand Gallery will stay empty. You have to go.\"Langdon seemed hesitant, as if his own academic curiosity were threatening tooverride sound judgment and drag him back into Fache's hands.\"Go. Now.\" Sophie gave him a grateful smile. \"I'll see you at the embassy, Mr.Langdon.\"Langdon looked displeased. \"I'll meet you there on one condition,\" he replied,his voice stern.She paused, startled. \"What's that?\"\"That you stop calling me Mr. Langdon.\"Sophie detected the faint hint of a lopsided grin growing across Langdon's face,and she felt herself smile back. \"Good luck, Robert.\" When Langdon reached the landing at the bottom of the stairs, the unmistakablesmell of linseed oil and plaster dust assaulted his nostrils. Ahead, anilluminated SORTIE/EXIT displayed an arrow pointing down a long corridor.Langdon stepped into the hallway.To the right gaped a murky restoration studio out of which peered an army ofstatues in various states of repair. To the left, Langdon saw a suite of studiosthat resembled Harvard art classrooms—rows of easels, paintings, palettes,framing tools—an art assembly line.As he moved down the hallway, Langdon wondered if at any moment he might awakewith a start in his bed in Cambridge. The entire evening had felt like a bizarredream. I'm about to dash out of the Louvre... a fugitive.Saunière's clever anagrammatic message was still on his mind, and Langdonwondered what Sophie would find at the Mona Lisa... if anything. She had seemedcertain her grandfather meant for her to visit the famous painting one moretime. As plausible an interpretation as this seemed, Langdon felt haunted now bya troubling paradox.P.S. Find Robert Langdon.Saunière had written Langdon's name on the floor, commanding Sophie to find him.But why? Merely so Langdon could help her break an anagram?It seemed quite unlikely.After all, Saunière had no reason to think Langdon was especially skilled atanagrams. We've never even met. More important, Sophie had stated flat out thatshe should have broken the anagram on her own. It had been Sophie who spottedthe Fibonacci sequence, and, no doubt, Sophie who, if given a little more time,would have deciphered the message with no help from Langdon.Sophie was supposed to break that anagram on her own. Langdon was suddenlyfeeling more certain about this, and yet the conclusion left an obvious gapinglapse in the logic of Saunière's actions.Why me? Langdon wondered, heading down the hall. Why was Saunière's dying wishthat his estranged granddaughter find me? What is it that Saunière thinks Iknow?With an unexpected jolt, Langdon stopped short. Eyes wide, he dug in his pocketand yanked out the computer printout. He stared at the last line of Saunière'smessage.P.S. Find Robert Langdon.He fixated on two letters.P.S.In that instant, Langdon felt Saunière's puzzling mix of symbolism fall intostark focus. Like a peal of thunder, a career's worth of symbology and historycame crashing down around him. Everything Jacques Saunière had done tonightsuddenly made perfect sense.Langdon's thoughts raced as he tried to assemble the implications of what thisall meant. Wheeling, he stared back in the direction from which he had come.Is there time?He knew it didn't matter.Without hesitation, Langdon broke into a sprint back toward the stairs."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22Kneeling in the first pew, Silas pretended to pray as he scanned the layout ofthe sanctuary. Saint-Sulpice, like most churches, had been built in the shape ofa giant Roman cross. Its long central section—the nave—led directly to the mainaltar, where it was transversely intersected by a shorter section, known as thetransept. The intersection of nave and transept occurred directly beneath themain cupola and was considered the heart of the church... her most sacred andmystical point.Not tonight, Silas thought. Saint-Sulpice hides her secrets elsewhere.Turning his head to the right, he gazed into the south transept, toward the openarea of floor beyond the end of the pews, to the object his victims haddescribed.There it is.Embedded in the gray granite floor, a thin polished strip of brass glistened inthe stone... a golden line slanting across the church's floor. The line boregraduated markings, like a ruler. It was a gnomon, Silas had been told, a paganastronomical device like a sundial. Tourists, scientists, historians, and pagansfrom around the world came to Saint-Sulpice to gaze upon this famous line.The Rose Line.Slowly, Silas let his eyes trace the path of the brass strip as it made its wayacross the floor from his right to left, slanting in front of him at an awkwardangle, entirely at odds with the symmetry of the church. Slicing across the mainaltar itself, the line looked to Silas like a slash wound across a beautifulface. The strip cleaved the communion rail in two and then crossed the entirewidth of the church, finally reaching the corner of the north transept, where itarrived at the base of a most unexpected structure.A colossal Egyptian obelisk.Here, the glistening Rose Line took a ninety-degree vertical turn and continueddirectly up the face of the obelisk itself, ascending thirty-three feet to thevery tip of the pyramidical apex, where it finally ceased.The Rose Line, Silas thought. The brotherhood hid the keystone at the Rose Line.Earlier tonight, when Silas told the Teacher that the Priory keystone was hiddeninside Saint-Sulpice, the Teacher had sounded doubtful. But when Silas addedthat the brothers had all given him a precise location, with relation to a brassline running through Saint-Sulpice, the Teacher had gasped with revelation. \"Youspeak of the Rose Line!\"The Teacher quickly told Silas of Saint-Sulpice's famed architectural oddity—astrip of brass that segmented the sanctuary on a perfect north-south axis. Itwas an ancient sundial of sorts, a vestige of the pagan temple that had oncestood on this very spot. The sun's rays, shining through the oculus on the southwall, moved farther down the line every day, indicating the passage of time,from solstice to solstice.The north-south stripe had been known as the Rose Line. For centuries, thesymbol of the Rose had been associated with maps and guiding souls in the properdirection. The Compass Rose—drawn on almost every map—indicated North, East,South, and West. Originally known as the Wind Rose, it denoted the directions ofthe thirty-two winds, blowing from the directions of eight major winds, eighthalf-winds, and sixteen quarter-winds. When diagrammed inside a circle, thesethirty-two points of the compass perfectly resembled a traditional thirty-twopetal rose bloom. To this day, the fundamental navigational tool was still knownas a Compass Rose, its northernmost direction still marked by an arrowhead...or, more commonly, the symbol of the fleur-de-lis.On a globe, a Rose Line—also called a meridian or longitude—was any imaginaryline drawn from the North Pole to the South Pole. There were, of course, aninfinite number of Rose Lines because every point on the globe could have alongitude drawn through it connecting north and south poles. The question forearly navigators was which of these lines would be called the Rose Line—the zerolongitude—the line from which all other longitudes on earth would be measured.Today that line was in Greenwich, England.But it had not always been.Long before the establishment of Greenwich as the prime meridian, the zerolongitude of the entire world had passed directly through Paris, and through theChurch of Saint-Sulpice. The brass marker in Saint-Sulpice was a memorial to theworld's first prime meridian, and although Greenwich had stripped Paris of thehonor in 1888, the original Rose Line was still visible today.\"And so the legend is true,\" the Teacher had told Silas. \"The Priory keystonehas been said to lie 'beneath the Sign of the Rose.' \"Now, still on his knees in a pew, Silas glanced around the church and listenedto make sure no one was there. For a moment, he thought he heard a rustling inthe choir balcony. He turned and gazed up for several seconds. Nothing.I am alone.Standing now, he faced the altar and genuflected three times. Then he turnedleft and followed the brass line due north toward the obelisk. At that moment, at Leonardo da Vinci International Airport in Rome, the jolt oftires hitting the runway startled Bishop Aringarosa from his slumber.I drifted off, he thought, impressed he was relaxed enough to sleep.\"Benvenuto a Roma,\" the intercom announced.Sitting up, Aringarosa straightened his black cassock and allowed himself a raresmile. This was one trip he had been happy to make. I have been on the defensivefor too long. Tonight, however, the rules had changed. Only five months ago,Aringarosa had feared for the future of the Faith. Now, as if by the will ofGod, the solution had presented itself.Divine intervention.If all went as planned tonight in Paris, Aringarosa would soon be in possessionof something that would make him the most powerful man in Christendom. CHAPTER 23Sophie arrived breathless outside the large wooden doors of the Salle desEtats—the room that housed the Mona Lisa. Before entering, she gazed reluctantlyfarther down the hall, twenty yards or so, to the spot where her grandfather'sbody still lay under the spotlight.The remorse that gripped her was powerful and sudden, a deep sadness laced withguilt. The man had reached out to her so many times over the past ten years, andyet Sophie had remained immovable—leaving his letters and packages unopened in abottom drawer and denying his efforts to see her. He lied to me! Kept appallingsecrets! What was I supposed to do? And so she had blocked him out. Completely.Now her grandfather was dead, and he was talking to her from the grave.The Mona Lisa.She reached for the huge wooden doors, and pushed. The entryway yawned open.Sophie stood on the threshold a moment, scanning the large rectangular chamberbeyond. It too was bathed in a soft red light. The Salle des Etats was one ofthis museum's rare culs-de-sac—a dead end and the only room off the middle ofthe Grand Gallery. This door, the chamber's sole point of entry, faced adominating fifteen-foot Botticelli on the far wall. Beneath it, centered on theparquet floor, an immense octagonal viewing divan served as a welcome respitefor thousands of visitors to rest their legs while they admired the Louvre'smost valuable asset.Even before Sophie entered, though, she knew she was missing something. A blacklight. She gazed down the hall at her grandfather under the lights in thedistance, surrounded by electronic gear. If he had written anything in here, healmost certainly would have written it with the watermark stylus.Taking a deep breath, Sophie hurried down to the well-lit crime scene. Unable tolook at her grandfather, she focused solely on the PTS tools. Finding a smallultraviolet penlight, she slipped it in the pocket of her sweater and hurriedback up the hallway toward the open doors of the Salle des Etats.Sophie turned the corner and stepped over the threshold. Her entrance, however,was met by an unexpected sound of muffled footsteps racing toward her frominside the chamber. There's someone in here! A ghostly figure emerged suddenlyfrom out of the reddish haze. Sophie jumped back.\"There you are!\" Langdon's hoarse whisper cut the air as his silhouette slid toa stop in front of her.Her relief was only momentary. \"Robert, I told you to get out of here! IfFache—\"\"Where were you?\"\"I had to get the black light,\" she whispered, holding it up. \"If my grandfatherleft me a message—\"\"Sophie, listen.\" Langdon caught his breath as his blue eyes held her firmly.\"The letters P.S.... do they mean anything else to you? Anything at all?\"Afraid their voices might echo down the hall, Sophie pulled him into the Salledes Etats and closed the enormous twin doors silently, sealing them inside. \"Itold you, the initials mean Princess Sophie.\"\"I know, but did you ever see them anywhere else? Did your grandfather ever useP.S. in any other way? As a monogram, or maybe on stationery or a personalitem?\"The question startled her. How would Robert know that? Sophie had indeed seenthe initials P.S. once before, in a kind of monogram. It was the day before herninth birthday. She was secretly combing the house, searching for hiddenbirthday presents. Even then, she could not bear secrets kept from her. What didGrand-père get for me this year? She dug through cupboards and drawers. Did heget me the doll I wanted? Where would he hide it?Finding nothing in the entire house, Sophie mustered the courage to sneak intoher grandfather's bedroom. The room was off-limits to her, but her grandfatherwas downstairs asleep on the couch.I'll just take a fast peek!Tiptoeing across the creaky wood floor to his closet, Sophie peered on theshelves behind his clothing. Nothing. Next she looked under the bed. Stillnothing. Moving to his bureau, she opened the drawers and one by one beganpawing carefully through them. There must be something for me here! As shereached the bottom drawer, she still had not found any hint of a doll. Dejected,she opened the final drawer and pulled aside some black clothes she had neverseen him wear. She was about to close the drawer when her eyes caught a glint ofgold in the back of the drawer. It looked like a pocket watch chain, but sheknew he didn't wear one. Her heart raced as she realized what it must be.A necklace!Sophie carefully pulled the chain from the drawer. To her surprise, on the endwas a brilliant gold key. Heavy and shimmering. Spellbound, she held it up. Itlooked like no key she had ever seen. Most keys were flat with jagged teeth, butthis one had a triangular column with little pockmarks all over it. Its largegolden head was in the shape of a cross, but not a normal cross. This was aneven-armed one, like a plus sign. Embossed in the middle of the cross was astrange symbol—two letters intertwined with some kind of flowery design.\"P.S.,\" she whispered, scowling as she read the letters. Whatever could this be?\"Sophie?\" her grandfather spoke from the doorway.Startled, she spun, dropping the key on the floor with a loud clang. She stareddown at the key, afraid to look up at her grandfather's face. \"I... was lookingfor my birthday present,\" she said, hanging her head, knowing she had betrayedhis trust.For what seemed like an eternity, her grandfather stood silently in the doorway.Finally, he let out a long troubled breath. \"Pick up the key, Sophie.\"Sophie retrieved the key.Her grandfather walked in. \"Sophie, you need to respect other people's privacy.\"Gently, he knelt down and took the key from her. \"This key is very special. Ifyou had lost it...\"Her grandfather's quiet voice made Sophie feel even worse. \"I'm sorry,Grand-père. I really am.\" She paused. \"I thought it was a necklace for mybirthday.\"He gazed at her for several seconds. \"I'll say this once more, Sophie, becauseit's important. You need to learn to respect other people's privacy.\"\"Yes, Grand-père.\"\"We'll talk about this some other time. Right now, the garden needs to beweeded.\"Sophie hurried outside to do her chores.The next morning, Sophie received no birthday present from her grandfather. Shehadn't expected one, not after what she had done. But he didn't even wish herhappy birthday all day. Sadly, she trudged up to bed that night. As she climbedin, though, she found a note card lying on her pillow. On the card was written asimple riddle. Even before she solved the riddle, she was smiling. I know whatthis is! Her grandfather had done this for her last Christmas morning.A treasure hunt!Eagerly, she pored over the riddle until she solved it. The solution pointed herto another part of the house, where she found another card and another riddle.She solved this one too, racing on to the next card. Running wildly, she dartedback and forth across the house, from clue to clue, until at last she found aclue that directed her back to her own bedroom. Sophie dashed up the stairs,rushed into her room, and stopped in her tracks. There in the middle of the roomsat a shining red bicycle with a ribbon tied to the handlebars. Sophie shriekedwith delight.\"I know you asked for a doll,\" her grandfather said, smiling in the corner. \"Ithought you might like this even better.\"The next day, her grandfather taught her to ride, running beside her down thewalkway. When Sophie steered out over the thick lawn and lost her balance, theyboth went tumbling onto the grass, rolling and laughing.\"Grand-père,\" Sophie said, hugging him. \"I'm really sorry about the key.\"\"I know, sweetie. You're forgiven. I can't possibly stay mad at you.Grandfathers and granddaughters always forgive each other.\"Sophie knew she shouldn't ask, but she couldn't help it. \"What does it open? Inever saw a key like that. It was very pretty.\"Her grandfather was silent a long moment, and Sophie could see he was uncertainhow to answer. Grand-père never lies. \"It opens a box,\" he finally said. \"WhereI keep many secrets.\"Sophie pouted. \"I hate secrets!\"\"I know, but these are important secrets. And someday, you'll learn toappreciate them as much as I do.\"\"I saw letters on the key, and a flower.\"\"Yes, that's my favorite flower. It's called a fleur-de-lis. We have them in thegarden. The white ones. In English we call that kind of flower a lily.\"\"I know those! They're my favorite too!\"\"Then I'll make a deal with you.\" Her grandfather's eyebrows raised the way theyalways did when he was about to give her a challenge. \"If you can keep my key asecret, and never talk about it ever again, to me or anybody, then someday Iwill give it to you.\"Sophie couldn't believe her ears. \"You will?\"\"I promise. When the time comes, the key will be yours. It has your name on it.\"Sophie scowled. \"No it doesn't. It said P.S. My name isn't P.S.!\"Her grandfather lowered his voice and looked around as if to make sure no onewas listening. \"Okay, Sophie, if you must know, P.S. is a code. It's your secretinitials.\"Her eyes went wide. \"I have secret initials?\"\"Of course. Granddaughters always have secret initials that only theirgrandfathers know.\"\"P.S.?\"He tickled her. \"Princesse Sophie.\"She giggled. \"I'm not a princess!\"He winked. \"You are to me.\"From that day on, they never again spoke of the key. And she became his PrincessSophie. Inside the Salle des Etats, Sophie stood in silence and endured the sharp pangof loss.\"The initials,\" Langdon whispered, eyeing her strangely. \"Have you seen them?\"Sophie sensed her grandfather's voice whispering in the corridors of the museum.Never speak of this key, Sophie. To me or to anyone. She knew she had failed himin forgiveness, and she wondered if she could break his trust again. P.S. FindRobert Langdon. Her grandfather wanted Langdon to help. Sophie nodded. \"Yes, Isaw the initials P.S. once. When I was very young.\"\"Where?\"Sophie hesitated. \"On something very important to him.\"Langdon locked eyes with her. \"Sophie, this is crucial. Can you tell me if theinitials appeared with a symbol? A fleur-de-lis?\"Sophie felt herself staggering backward in amazement. \"But... how could youpossibly know that!\"Langdon exhaled and lowered his voice. \"I'm fairly certain your grandfather wasa member of a secret society. A very old covert brotherhood.\"Sophie felt a knot tighten in her stomach. She was certain of it too. For tenyears she had tried to forget the incident that had confirmed that horrifyingfact for her. She had witnessed something unthinkable. Unforgivable.\"The fleur-de-lis,\" Langdon said, \"combined with the initials P.S., that is thebrotherhood's official device. Their coat of arms. Their logo.\"\"How do you know this?\" Sophie was praying Langdon was not going to tell herthat he himself was a member.\"I've written about this group,\" he said, his voice tremulous with excitement.\"Researching the symbols of secret societies is a specialty of mine. They callthemselves the Prieuré de Sion—the Priory of Sion. They're based here in Franceand attract powerful members from all over Europe. In fact, they are one of theoldest surviving secret societies on earth.\"Sophie had never heard of them.Langdon was talking in rapid bursts now. \"The Priory's membership has includedsome of history's most cultured individuals: men like Botticelli, Sir IsaacNewton, Victor Hugo.\" He paused, his voice brimming now with academic zeal.\"And, Leonardo da Vinci.\"Sophie stared. \"Da Vinci was in a secret society?\"\"Da Vinci presided over the Priory between 1510 and 1519 as the brotherhood'sGrand Master, which might help explain your grandfather's passion for Leonardo'swork. The two men share a historical fraternal bond. And it all fits perfectlywith their fascination for goddess iconology, paganism, feminine deities, andcontempt for the Church. The Priory has a well-documented history of reverencefor the sacred feminine.\"\"You're telling me this group is a pagan goddess worship cult?\"\"More like the pagan goddess worship cult. But more important, they are known asthe guardians of an ancient secret. One that made them immeasurably powerful.\"Despite the total conviction in Langdon's eyes, Sophie's gut reaction was one ofstark disbelief. A secret pagan cult? Once headed by Leonardo da Vinci? It allsounded utterly absurd. And yet, even as she dismissed it, she felt her mindreeling back ten years—to the night she had mistakenly surprised her grandfatherand witnessed what she still could not accept. Could that explain—?\"The identities of living Priory members are kept extremely secret,\" Langdonsaid, \"but the P.S. and fleur-de-lis that you saw as a child are proof. It couldonly have been related to the Priory.\"Sophie realized now that Langdon knew far more about her grandfather than shehad previously imagined. This American obviously had volumes to share with her,but this was not the place. \"I can't afford to let them catch you, Robert.There's a lot we need to discuss. You need to go!\" Langdon heard only the faint murmur of her voice. He wasn't going anywhere. Hewas lost in another place now. A place where ancient secrets rose to thesurface. A place where forgotten histories emerged from the shadows.Slowly, as if moving underwater, Langdon turned his head and gazed through thereddish haze toward the Mona Lisa.The fleur-de-lis... the flower of Lisa... the Mona Lisa.It was all intertwined, a silent symphony echoing the deepest secrets of thePriory of Sion and Leonardo da Vinci. A few miles away, on the riverbank beyond Les Invalides, the bewildered driverof a twin-bed Trailor truck stood at gunpoint and watched as the captain of theJudicial Police let out a guttural roar of rage and heaved a bar of soap outinto the turgid waters of the Seine. CHAPTER 24Silas gazed upward at the Saint-Sulpice obelisk, taking in the length of themassive marble shaft. His sinews felt taut with exhilaration. He glanced aroundthe church one more time to make sure he was alone. Then he knelt at the base ofthe structure, not out of reverence, but out of necessity.The keystone is hidden beneath the Rose Line.At the base of the Sulpice obelisk.All the brothers had concurred.On his knees now, Silas ran his hands across the stone floor. He saw no cracksor markings to indicate a movable tile, so he began rapping softly with hisknuckles on the floor. Following the brass line closer to the obelisk, heknocked on each tile adjacent to the brass line. Finally, one of them echoedstrangely.There's a hollow area beneath the floor!Silas smiled. His victims had spoken the truth.Standing, he searched the sanctuary for something with which to break the floortile. High above Silas, in the balcony, Sister Sandrine stifled a gasp. Her darkestfears had just been confirmed. This visitor was not who he seemed. Themysterious Opus Dei monk had come to Saint-Sulpice for another purpose.A secret purpose.You are not the only one with secrets, she thought.Sister Sandrine Bieil was more than the keeper of this church. She was a sentry.And tonight, the ancient wheels had been set in motion. The arrival of thisstranger at the base of the obelisk was a signal from the brotherhood.It was a silent call of distress. CHAPTER 25The U.S. Embassy in Paris is a compact complex on Avenue Gabriel, just north ofthe Champs-Elysées. The three-acre compound is considered U.S. soil, meaning allthose who stand on it are subject to the same laws and protections as they wouldencounter standing in the United States.The embassy's night operator was reading Time magazine's International Editionwhen the sound of her phone interrupted.\"U.S. Embassy,\" she answered.\"Good evening.\" The caller spoke English accented with French. \"I need someassistance.\" Despite the politeness of the man's words, his tone sounded gruffand official. \"I was told you had a phone message for me on your automatedsystem. The name is Langdon. Unfortunately, I have forgotten my three-digitaccess code. If you could help me, I would be most grateful.\"The operator paused, confused. \"I'm sorry, sir. Your message must be quite old.That system was removed two years ago for security precautions. Moreover, allthe access codes were five-digit. Who told you we had a message for you?\"\"You have no automated phone system?\"\"No, sir. Any message for you would be handwritten in our services department.What was your name again?\"But the man had hung up. Bezu Fache felt dumbstruck as he paced the banks of the Seine. He was certain hehad seen Langdon dial a local number, enter a three-digit code, and then listento a recording. But if Langdon didn't phone the embassy, then who the hell didhe call?It was at that moment, eyeing his cellular phone, that Fache realized theanswers were in the palm of his hand. Langdon used my phone to place that call.Keying into the cell phone's menu, Fache pulled up the list of recently dialednumbers and found the call Langdon had placed.A Paris exchange, followed by the three-digit code 454.Redialing the phone number, Fache waited as the line began ringing.Finally a woman's voice answered. \"Bonjour, vous êtes bien chez Sophie Neveu,\"the recording announced. \"Je suis absente pour le moment, mais...\"Fache's blood was boiling as he typed the numbers 4... 5... 4. CHAPTER 26Despite her monumental reputation, the Mona Lisa was a mere thirty-one inches bytwenty-one inches—smaller even than the posters of her sold in the Louvre giftshop. She hung on the northwest wall of the Salle des Etats behind atwo-inch-thick pane of protective Plexiglas. Painted on a poplar wood panel, herethereal, mist-filled atmosphere was attributed to Da Vinci's mastery of thesfumato style, in which forms appear to evaporate into one another.Since taking up residence in the Louvre, the Mona Lisa—or La Jaconde as theycall her in France—had been stolen twice, most recently in 1911, when shedisappeared from the Louvre's \"satte impénétrable\"—Le Salon Carre. Parisianswept in the streets and wrote newspaper articles begging the thieves for thepainting's return. Two years later, the Mona Lisa was discovered hidden in thefalse bottom of a trunk in a Florence hotel room.Langdon, now having made it clear to Sophie that he had no intention of leaving,moved with her across the Salle des Etats. The Mona Lisa was still twenty yardsahead when Sophie turned on the black light, and the bluish crescent of penlightfanned out on the floor in front of them. She swung the beam back and forthacross the floor like a minesweeper, searching for any hint of luminescent ink.Walking beside her, Langdon was already feeling the tingle of anticipation thataccompanied his face-to-face reunions with great works of art. He strained tosee beyond the cocoon of purplish light emanating from the black light inSophie's hand. To the left, the room's octagonal viewing divan emerged, lookinglike a dark island on the empty sea of parquet.Langdon could now begin to see the panel of dark glass on the wall. Behind it,he knew, in the confines of her own private cell, hung the most celebratedpainting in the world.The Mona Lisa's status as the most famous piece of art in the world, Langdonknew, had nothing to do with her enigmatic smile. Nor was it due to themysterious interpretations attributed her by many art historians and conspiracybuffs. Quite simply, the Mona Lisa was famous because Leonardo da Vinci claimedshe was his finest accomplishment. He carried the painting with him whenever hetraveled and, if asked why, would reply that he found it hard to part with hismost sublime expression of female beauty.Even so, many art historians suspected Da Vinci's reverence for the Mona Lisahad nothing to do with its artistic mastery. In actuality, the painting was asurprisingly ordinary sfumato portrait. Da Vinci's veneration for this work,many claimed, stemmed from something far deeper: a hidden message in the layersof paint. The Mona Lisa was, in fact, one of the world's most documented insidejokes. The painting's well-documented collage of double entendres and playfulallusions had been revealed in most art history tomes, and yet, incredibly, thepublic at large still considered her smile a great mystery.No mystery at all, Langdon thought, moving forward and watching as the faintoutline of the painting began to take shape. No mystery at all.Most recently Langdon had shared the Mona Lisa's secret with a rather unlikelygroup—a dozen inmates at the Essex County Penitentiary. Langdon's jail seminarwas part of a Harvard outreach program attempting to bring education into theprison system—Culture for Convicts, as Langdon's colleagues liked to call it.Standing at an overhead projector in a darkened penitentiary library, Langdonhad shared the Mona Lisa's secret with the prisoners attending class, men whomhe found surprisingly engaged—rough, but sharp. \"You may notice,\" Langdon toldthem, walking up to the projected image of the Mona Lisa on the library wall,\"that the background behind her face is uneven.\" Langdon motioned to the glaringdiscrepancy. \"Da Vinci painted the horizon line on the left significantly lowerthan the right.\"\"He screwed it up?\" one of the inmates asked.Langdon chuckled. \"No. Da Vinci didn't do that too often. Actually, this is alittle trick Da Vinci played. By lowering the countryside on the left, Da Vincimade Mona Lisa look much larger from the left side than from the right side. Alittle Da Vinci inside joke. Historically, the concepts of male and female haveassigned sides—left is female, and right is male. Because Da Vinci was a big fanof feminine principles, he made Mona Lisa look more majestic from the left thanthe right.\"\"I heard he was a fag,\" said a small man with a goatee.Langdon winced. \"Historians don't generally put it quite that way, but yes, DaVinci was a homosexual.\"\"Is that why he was into that whole feminine thing?\"\"Actually, Da Vinci was in tune with the balance between male and female. Hebelieved that a human soul could not be enlightened unless it had both male andfemale elements.\"\"You mean like chicks with dicks?\" someone called.This elicited a hearty round of laughs. Langdon considered offering anetymological sidebar about the word hermaphrodite and its ties to Hermes andAphrodite, but something told him it would be lost on this crowd.\"Hey, Mr. Langford,\" a muscle-bound man said. \"Is it true that the Mona Lisa isa picture of Da Vinci in drag? I heard that was true.\"\"It's quite possible,\" Langdon said. \"Da Vinci was a prankster, and computerizedanalysis of the Mona Lisa and Da Vinci's self-portraits confirm some startlingpoints of congruency in their faces. Whatever Da Vinci was up to,\" Langdon said,\"his Mona Lisa is neither male nor female. It carries a subtle message ofandrogyny. It is a fusing of both.\"\"You sure that's not just some Harvard bullshit way of saying Mona Lisa is oneugly chick.\"Now Langdon laughed. \"You may be right. But actually Da Vinci left a big cluethat the painting was supposed to be androgynous. Has anyone here ever heard ofan Egyptian god named Amon?\"\"Hell yes!\" the big guy said. \"God of masculine fertility!\"Langdon was stunned.\"It says so on every box of Amon condoms.\" The muscular man gave a wide grin.\"It's got a guy with a ram's head on the front and says he's the Egyptian god offertility.\"Langdon was not familiar with the brand name, but he was glad to hear theprophylactic manufacturers had gotten their hieroglyphs right. \"Well done. Amonis indeed represented as a man with a ram's head, and his promiscuity and curvedhorns are related to our modern sexual slang 'horny.' \"\"No shit!\"\"No shit,\" Langdon said. \"And do you know who Amon's counterpart was? TheEgyptian goddess of fertility?\"The question met with several seconds of silence.\"It was Isis,\" Langdon told them, grabbing a grease pen. \"So we have the malegod, Amon.\" He wrote it down. \"And the female goddess, Isis, whose ancientpictogram was once called L'ISA.\"Langdon finished writing and stepped back from the projector. AMON L'ISA \"Ring any bells?\" he asked.\"Mona Lisa... holy crap,\" somebody gasped.Langdon nodded. \"Gentlemen, not only does the face of Mona Lisa lookandrogynous, but her name is an anagram of the divine union of male and female.And that, my friends, is Da Vinci's little secret, and the reason for MonaLisa's knowing smile.\" \"My grandfather was here,\" Sophie said, dropping suddenly to her knees, now onlyten feet from the Mona Lisa. She pointed the black light tentatively to a spoton the parquet floor.At first Langdon saw nothing. Then, as he knelt beside her, he saw a tinydroplet of dried liquid that was luminescing. Ink? Suddenly he recalled whatblack lights were actually used for. Blood. His senses tingled. Sophie wasright. Jacques Saunière had indeed paid a visit to the Mona Lisa before he died.\"He wouldn't have come here without a reason,\" Sophie whispered, standing up. \"Iknow he left a message for me here.\" Quickly striding the final few steps to theMona Lisa, she illuminated the floor directly in front of the painting. Shewaved the light back and forth across the bare parquet.\"There's nothing here!\"At that moment, Langdon saw a faint purple glimmer on the protective glassbefore the Mona Lisa. Reaching down, he took Sophie's wrist and slowly moved thelight up to the painting itself.They both froze.On the glass, six words glowed in purple, scrawled directly across the MonaLisa's face. CHAPTER 27Seated at Saunière's desk, Lieutenant Collet pressed the phone to his ear indisbelief. Did I hear Fache correctly? \"A bar of soap? But how could Langdonhave known about the GPS dot?\"\"Sophie Neveu,\" Fache replied. \"She told him.\"\"What! Why?\"\"Damned good question, but I just heard a recording that confirms she tipped himoff.\"Collet was speechless. What was Neveu thinking? Fache had proof that Sophie hadinterfered with a DCPJ sting operation? Sophie Neveu was not only going to befired, she was also going to jail. \"But, Captain... then where is Langdon now?\"\"Have any fire alarms gone off there?\"\"No, sir.\"\"And no one has come out under the Grand Gallery gate?\"\"No. We've got a Louvre security officer on the gate. Just as you requested.\"\"Okay, Langdon must still be inside the Grand Gallery.\"\"Inside? But what is he doing?\"\"Is the Louvre security guard armed?\"\"Yes, sir. He's a senior warden.\"\"Send him in,\" Fache commanded. \"I can't get my men back to the perimeter for afew minutes, and I don't want Langdon breaking for an exit.\" Fache paused. \"Andyou'd better tell the guard Agent Neveu is probably in there with him.\"\"Agent Neveu left, I thought.\"\"Did you actually see her leave?\"\"No, sir, but—\"\"Well, nobody on the perimeter saw her leave either. They only saw her go in.\"Collet was flabbergasted by Sophie Neveu's bravado. She's still inside thebuilding?\"Handle it,\" Fache ordered. \"I want Langdon and Neveu at gunpoint by the time Iget back.\" As the Trailor truck drove off, Captain Fache rounded up his men. Robert Langdonhad proven an elusive quarry tonight, and with Agent Neveu now helping him, hemight be far harder to corner than expected.Fache decided not to take any chances.Hedging his bets, he ordered half of his men back to the Louvre perimeter. Theother half he sent to guard the only location in Paris where Robert Langdoncould find safe harbor. CHAPTER 28Inside the Salle des Etats, Langdon stared in astonishment at the six wordsglowing on the Plexiglas. The text seemed to hover in space, casting a jaggedshadow across Mona Lisa's mysterious smile.\"The Priory,\" Langdon whispered. \"This proves your grandfather was a member!\"Sophie looked at him in confusion. \"You understand this?\"\"It's flawless,\" Langdon said, nodding as his thoughts churned. \"It's aproclamation of one of the Priory's most fundamental philosophies!\"Sophie looked baffled in the glow of the message scrawled across the Mona Lisa'sface. SO DARK THE CON OF MAN \"Sophie,\" Langdon said, \"the Priory's tradition of perpetuating goddess worshipis based on a belief that powerful men in the early Christian church 'conned'the world by propagating lies that devalued the female and tipped the scales infavor of the masculine.\"Sophie remained silent, staring at the words.\"The Priory believes that Constantine and his male successors successfullyconverted the world from matriarchal paganism to patriarchal Christianity bywaging a campaign of propaganda that demonized the sacred feminine, obliteratingthe goddess from modern religion forever.\"Sophie's expression remained uncertain. \"My grandfather sent me to this spot tofind this. He must be trying to tell me more than that.\"Langdon understood her meaning. She thinks this is another code. Whether ahidden meaning existed here or not, Langdon could not immediately say. His mindwas still grappling with the bold clarity of Saunière's outward message.So dark the con of man, he thought. So dark indeed.Nobody could deny the enormous good the modern Church did in today's troubledworld, and yet the Church had a deceitful and violent history. Their brutalcrusade to \"reeducate\" the pagan and feminine-worshipping religions spannedthree centuries, employing methods as inspired as they were horrific.The Catholic Inquisition published the book that arguably could be called themost blood-soaked publication in human history. Malleus Maleficarum—or TheWitches' Hammer—indoctrinated the world to \"the dangers of freethinking women\"and instructed the clergy how to locate, torture, and destroy them. Those deemed\"witches\" by the Church included all female scholars, priestesses, gypsies,mystics, nature lovers, herb gatherers, and any women \"suspiciously attuned tothe natural world.\" Midwives also were killed for their heretical practice ofusing medical knowledge to ease the pain of childbirth—a suffering, the Churchclaimed, that was God's rightful punishment for Eve's partaking of the Apple ofKnowledge, thus giving birth to the idea of Original Sin. During three hundredyears of witch hunts, the Church burned at the stake an astounding five millionwomen.The propaganda and bloodshed had worked.Today's world was living proof.Women, once celebrated as an essential half of spiritual enlightenment, had beenbanished from the temples of the world. There were no female Orthodox rabbis,Catholic priests, nor Islamic clerics. The once hallowed act of Hieros Gamos—thenatural sexual union between man and woman through which each became spirituallywhole—had been recast as a shameful act. Holy men who had once required sexualunion with their female counterparts to commune with God now feared theirnatural sexual urges as the work of the devil, collaborating with his favoriteaccomplice... woman.Not even the feminine association with the left-hand side could escape theChurch's defamation. In France and Italy, the words for \"left\"—gauche andsinistra—came to have deeply negative overtones, while their right-handcounterparts rang of righteousness, dexterity, and correctness. To this day,radical thought was considered left wing, irrational thought was left brain, andanything evil, sinister.The days of the goddess were over. The pendulum had swung. Mother Earth hadbecome a man's world, and the gods of destruction and war were taking theirtoll. The male ego had spent two millennia running unchecked by its femalecounterpart. The Priory of Sion believed that it was this obliteration of thesacred feminine in modern life that had caused what the Hopi Native Americanscalled koyanisquatsi—\"life out of balance\"—an unstable situation marked bytestosterone-fueled wars, a plethora of misogynistic societies, and a growingdisrespect for Mother Earth.\"Robert!\" Sophie said, her whisper yanking him back. \"Someone's coming!\"He heard the approaching footsteps out in the hallway.\"Over here!\" Sophie extinguished the black light and seemed to evaporate beforeLangdon's eyes.For an instant he felt totally blind. Over where! As his vision cleared he sawSophie's silhouette racing toward the center of the room and ducking out ofsight behind the octagonal viewing bench. He was about to dash after her when abooming voice stopped him cold.\"Arrêtez!\" a man commanded from the doorway.The Louvre security agent advanced through the entrance to the Salle des Etats,his pistol outstretched, taking deadly aim at Langdon's chest.Langdon felt his arms raise instinctively for the ceiling.\"Couchez-vous!\" the guard commanded. \"Lie down!\"Langdon was face first on the floor in a matter of seconds. The guard hurriedover and kicked his legs apart, spreading Langdon out.\"Mauvaise idée, Monsieur Langdon,\" he said, pressing the gun hard into Langdon'sback. \"Mauvaise idée.\"Face down on the parquet floor with his arms and legs spread wide, Langdon foundlittle humor in the irony of his position. The Vitruvian Man, he thought. Facedown. CHAPTER 29Inside Saint-Sulpice, Silas carried the heavy iron votive candle holder from thealtar back toward the obelisk. The shaft would do nicely as a battering ram.Eyeing the gray marble panel that covered the apparent hollow in the floor, herealized he could not possibly shatter the covering without making considerablenoise.Iron on marble. It would echo off the vaulted ceilings.Would the nun hear him? She should be asleep by now. Even so, it was a chanceSilas preferred not to take. Looking around for a cloth to wrap around the tipof the iron pole, he saw nothing except the altar's linen mantle, which herefused to defile. My cloak, he thought. Knowing he was alone in the greatchurch, Silas untied his cloak and slipped it off his body. As he removed it, hefelt a sting as the wool fibers stuck to the fresh wounds on his back.Naked now, except for his loin swaddle, Silas wrapped his cloak over the end ofthe iron rod. Then, aiming at the center of the floor tile, he drove the tipinto it. A muffled thud. The stone did not break. He drove the pole into itagain. Again a dull thud, but this time accompanied by a crack. On the thirdswing, the covering finally shattered, and stone shards fell into a hollow areabeneath the floor.A compartment!Quickly pulling the remaining pieces from the opening, Silas gazed into thevoid. His blood pounded as he knelt down before it. Raising his pale bare arm,he reached inside.At first he felt nothing. The floor of the compartment was bare, smooth stone.Then, feeling deeper, reaching his arm in under the Rose Line, he touchedsomething! A thick stone tablet. Getting his fingers around the edge, he grippedit and gently lifted the tablet out. As he stood and examined his find, herealized he was holding a rough-hewn stone slab with engraved words. He felt foran instant like a modern-day Moses.As Silas read the words on the tablet, he felt surprise. He had expected thekeystone to be a map, or a complex series of directions, perhaps even encoded.The keystone, however, bore the simplest of inscriptions.Job 38:11A Bible verse? Silas was stunned with the devilish simplicity. The secretlocation of that which they sought was revealed in a Bible verse? Thebrotherhood stopped at nothing to mock the righteous!Job. Chapter thirty-eight. Verse eleven.Although Silas did not recall the exact contents of verse eleven by heart, heknew the Book of Job told the story of a man whose faith in God survivedrepeated tests. Appropriate, he thought, barely able to contain his excitement.Looking over his shoulder, he gazed down the shimmering Rose Line and couldn'thelp but smile. There atop the main altar, propped open on a gilded book stand,sat an enormous leather-bound Bible. Up in the balcony, Sister Sandrine was shaking. Moments ago, she had been aboutto flee and carry out her orders, when the man below suddenly removed his cloak.When she saw his alabaster-white flesh, she was overcome with a horrifiedbewilderment. His broad, pale back was soaked with blood-red slashes. Even fromhere she could see the wounds were fresh.This man has been mercilessly whipped!She also saw the bloody cilice around his thigh, the wound beneath it dripping.What kind of God would want a body punished this way? The rituals of Opus Dei,Sister Sandrine knew, were not something she would ever understand. But that washardly her concern at this instant. Opus Dei is searching for the keystone. Howthey knew of it, Sister Sandrine could not imagine, although she knew she didnot have time to think.The bloody monk was now quietly donning his cloak again, clutching his prize ashe moved toward the altar, toward the Bible.In breathless silence, Sister Sandrine left the balcony and raced down the hallto her quarters. Getting on her hands and knees, she reached beneath her woodenbed frame and retrieved the sealed envelope she had hidden there years ago.Tearing it open, she found four Paris phone numbers.Trembling, she began to dial. Downstairs, Silas laid the stone tablet on the altar and turned his eager handsto the leather Bible. His long white fingers were sweating now as he turned thepages. Flipping through the Old Testament, he found the Book of Job. He locatedchapter thirty-eight. As he ran his finger down the column of text, heanticipated the words he was about to read.They will lead the way!Finding verse number eleven, Silas read the text. It was only seven words.Confused, he read it again, sensing something had gone terribly wrong. The versesimply read:HITHERTO SHALT THOU COME, BUT NO FURTHER. CHAPTER 30Security warden Claude Grouard simmered with rage as he stood over his prostratecaptive in front of the Mona Lisa. This bastard killed Jacques Saunière!Saunière had been like a well-loved father to Grouard and his security team.Grouard wanted nothing more than to pull the trigger and bury a bullet in RobertLangdon's back. As senior warden, Grouard was one of the few guards who actuallycarried a loaded weapon. He reminded himself, however, that killing Langdonwould be a generous fate compared to the misery about to be communicated by BezuFache and the French prison system.Grouard yanked his walkie-talkie off his belt and attempted to radio for backup.All he heard was static. The additional electronic security in this chamberalways wrought havoc with the guards' communications. I have to move to thedoorway. Still aiming his weapon at Langdon, Grouard began backing slowly towardthe entrance. On his third step, he spied something that made him stop short.What the hell is that!An inexplicable mirage was materializing near the center of the room. Asilhouette. There was someone else in the room? A woman was moving through thedarkness, walking briskly toward the far left wall. In front of her, a purplishbeam of light swung back and forth across the floor, as if she were searchingfor something with a colored flashlight.\"Qui est là?\" Grouard demanded, feeling his adrenaline spike for a second timein the last thirty seconds. He suddenly didn't know where to aim his gun or whatdirection to move.\"PTS,\" the woman replied calmly, still scanning the floor with her light.Police Technique et Scientifique. Grouard was sweating now. I thought all theagents were gone! He now recognized the purple light as ultraviolet, consistentwith a PTS team, and yet he could not understand why DCPJ would be looking forevidence in here.\"Votre nom!\" Grouard yelled, instinct telling him something was amiss.\"Répondez!\"\"C'est mot,\" the voice responded in calm French. \"Sophie Neveu.\"Somewhere in the distant recesses of Grouard's mind, the name registered. SophieNeveu? That was the name of Saunière's granddaughter, wasn't it? She used tocome in here as a little kid, but that was years ago. This couldn't possibly beher! And even if it were Sophie Neveu, that was hardly a reason to trust her;Grouard had heard the rumors of the painful falling-out between Saunière and hisgranddaughter.\"You know me,\" the woman called. \"And Robert Langdon did not kill mygrandfather. Believe me.\"Warden Grouard was not about to take that on faith. I need backup! Trying hiswalkie-talkie again, he got only static. The entrance was still a good twentyyards behind him, and Grouard began backing up slowly, choosing to leave his guntrained on the man on the floor. As Grouard inched backward, he could see thewoman across the room raising her UV light and scrutinizing a large paintingthat hung on the far side of the Salle des Etats, directly opposite the MonaLisa.Grouard gasped, realizing which painting it was.What in the name of God is she doing? Across the room, Sophie Neveu felt a cold sweat breaking across her forehead.Langdon was still spread-eagle on the floor. Hold on, Robert. Almost there.Knowing the guard would never actually shoot either of them, Sophie now turnedher attention back to the matter at hand, scanning the entire area around onemasterpiece in particular—another Da Vinci. But the UV light revealed nothingout of the ordinary. Not on the floor, on the walls, or even on the canvasitself.There must be something here!Sophie felt totally certain she had deciphered her grandfather's intentionscorrectly.What else could he possibly intend?The masterpiece she was examining was a five-foot-tall canvas. The bizarre sceneDa Vinci had painted included an awkwardly posed Virgin Mary sitting with BabyJesus, John the Baptist, and the Angel Uriel on a perilous outcropping of rocks.When Sophie was a little girl, no trip to the Mona Lisa had been completewithout her grandfather dragging her across the room to see this secondpainting.Grand-père, I'm here! But I don't see it!Behind her, Sophie could hear the guard trying to radio again for help.Think!She pictured the message scrawled on the protective glass of the Mona Lisa. Sodark the con of man. The painting before her had no protective glass on which towrite a message, and Sophie knew her grandfather would never have defaced thismasterpiece by writing on the painting itself. She paused. At least not on thefront. Her eyes shot upward, climbing the long cables that dangled from theceiling to support the canvas.Could that be it? Grabbing the left side of the carved wood frame, she pulled ittoward her. The painting was large and the backing flexed as she swung it awayfrom the wall. Sophie slipped her head and shoulders in behind the painting andraised the black light to inspect the back.It took only seconds to realize her instinct had been wrong. The back of thepainting was pale and blank. There was no purple text here, only the mottledbrown backside of aging canvas and—Wait.Sophie's eyes locked on an incongruous glint of lustrous metal lodged near thebottom edge of the frame's wooden armature. The object was small, partiallywedged in the slit where the canvas met the frame. A shimmering gold chaindangled off it.To Sophie's utter amazement, the chain was affixed to a familiar gold key. Thebroad, sculpted head was in the shape of a cross and bore an engraved seal shehad not seen since she was nine years old. A fleur-de-lis with the initials P.S.In that instant, Sophie felt the ghost of her grandfather whispering in her ear.When the time comes, the key will be yours. A tightness gripped her throat asshe realized that her grandfather, even in death, had kept his promise. This keyopens a box, his voice was saying, where I keep many secrets.Sophie now realized that the entire purpose of tonight's word game had been thiskey. Her grandfather had it with him when he was killed. Not wanting it to fallinto the hands of the police, he hid it behind this painting. Then he devised aningenious treasure hunt to ensure only Sophie would find it.\"Au secours!\" the guard's voice yelled.Sophie snatched the key from behind the painting and slipped it deep in herpocket along with the UV penlight. Peering out from behind the canvas, she couldsee the guard was still trying desperately to raise someone on thewalkie-talkie. He was backing toward the entrance, still aiming the gun firmlyat Langdon.\"Au secours!\" he shouted again into his radio.Static.He can't transmit, Sophie realized, recalling that tourists with cell phonesoften got frustrated in here when they tried to call home to brag about seeingthe Mona Lisa. The extra surveillance wiring in the walls made it virtuallyimpossible to get a carrier unless you stepped out into the hall. The guard wasbacking quickly toward the exit now, and Sophie knew she had to act immediately.Gazing up at the large painting behind which she was partially ensconced, Sophierealized that Leonardo da Vinci, for the second time tonight, was there to help. Another few meters, Grouard told himself, keeping his gun leveled.\"Arrêtez! Ou je la détruis!\" the woman's voice echoed across the room.Grouard glanced over and stopped in his tracks. \"Mon dieu, non!\"Through the reddish haze, he could see that the woman had actually lifted thelarge painting off its cables and propped it on the floor in front of her. Atfive feet tall, the canvas almost entirely hid her body. Grouard's first thoughtwas to wonder why the painting's trip wires hadn't set off alarms, but of coursethe artwork cable sensors had yet to be reset tonight. What is she doing!When he saw it, his blood went cold.The canvas started to bulge in the middle, the fragile outlines of the VirginMary, Baby Jesus, and John the Baptist beginning to distort.\"Non!\" Grouard screamed, frozen in horror as he watched the priceless Da Vincistretching. The woman was pushing her knee into the center of the canvas frombehind! \"NON!\"Grouard wheeled and aimed his gun at her but instantly realized it was an emptythreat. The canvas was only fabric, but it was utterly impenetrable—asix-million-dollar piece of body armor.I can't put a bullet through a Da Vinci!\"Set down your gun and radio,\" the woman said in calm French, \"or I'll put myknee through this painting. I think you know how my grandfather would feel aboutthat.\"Grouard felt dizzy. \"Please... no. That's Madonna of the Rocks!\" He dropped hisgun and radio, raising his hands over his head.\"Thank you,\" the woman said. \"Now do exactly as I tell you, and everything willwork out fine.\" Moments later, Langdon's pulse was still thundering as he ran beside Sophie downthe emergency stairwell toward the ground level. Neither of them had said a wordsince leaving the trembling Louvre guard lying in the Salle des Etats. Theguard's pistol was now clutched tightly in Langdon's hands, and he couldn't waitto get rid of it. The weapon felt heavy and dangerously foreign.Taking the stairs two at a time, Langdon wondered if Sophie had any idea howvaluable a painting she had almost ruined. Her choice in art seemed eerilypertinent to tonight's adventure. The Da Vinci she had grabbed, much like theMona Lisa, was notorious among art historians for its plethora of hidden pagansymbolism.\"You chose a valuable hostage,\" he said as they ran.\"Madonna of the Rocks,\" she replied. \"But I didn't choose it, my grandfatherdid. He left me a little something behind the painting.\"Langdon shot her a startled look. \"What!? But how did you know which painting?Why Madonna of the Rocks?\"\"So dark the con of man.\" She flashed a triumphant smile. \"I missed the firsttwo anagrams, Robert. I wasn't about to miss the third.\" CHAPTER 31\"They're dead!\" Sister Sandrine stammered into the telephone in herSaint-Sulpice residence. She was leaving a message on an answering machine.\"Please pick up! They're all dead!\"The first three phone numbers on the list had produced terrifying results—ahysterical widow, a detective working late at a murder scene, and a somberpriest consoling a bereaved family. All three contacts were dead. And now, asshe called the fourth and final number—the number she was not supposed to callunless the first three could not be reached—she got an answering machine. Theoutgoing message offered no name but simply asked the caller to leave a message.\"The floor panel has been broken!\" she pleaded as she left the message. \"Theother three are dead!\"Sister Sandrine did not know the identities of the four men she protected, butthe private phone numbers stashed beneath her bed were for use on only onecondition.If that floor panel is ever broken, the faceless messenger had told her, itmeans the upper echelon has been breached. One of us has been mortallythreatened and been forced to tell a desperate lie. Call the numbers. Warn theothers. Do not fail us in this.It was a silent alarm. Foolproof in its simplicity. The plan had amazed her whenshe first heard it. If the identity of one brother was compromised, he couldtell a lie that would start in motion a mechanism to warn the others. Tonight,however, it seemed that more than one had been compromised.\"Please answer,\" she whispered in fear. \"Where are you?\"\"Hang up the phone,\" a deep voice said from the doorway.Turning in terror, she saw the massive monk. He was clutching the heavy ironcandle stand. Shaking, she set the phone back in the cradle.\"They are dead,\" the monk said. \"All four of them. And they have played me for afool. Tell me where the keystone is.\"\"I don't know!\" Sister Sandrine said truthfully. \"That secret is guarded byothers.\" Others who are dead!The man advanced, his white fists gripping the iron stand. \"You are a sister ofthe Church, and yet you serve them?\"\"Jesus had but one true message,\" Sister Sandrine said defiantly. \"I cannot seethat message in Opus Dei.\"A sudden explosion of rage erupted behind the monk's eyes. He lunged, lashingout with the candle stand like a club. As Sister Sandrine fell, her last feelingwas an overwhelming sense of foreboding.All four are dead.The precious truth is lost forever. CHAPTER 32The security alarm on the west end of the Denon Wing sent the pigeons in thenearby Tuileries Gardens scattering as Langdon and Sophie dashed out of thebulkhead into the Paris night. As they ran across the plaza to Sophie's car,Langdon could hear police sirens wailing in the distance.\"That's it there,\" Sophie called, pointing to a red snub-nosed two-seater parkedon the plaza.She's kidding, right? The vehicle was easily the smallest car Langdon had everseen.\"SmartCar,\" she said. \"A hundred kilometers to the liter.\"Langdon had barely thrown himself into the passenger seat before Sophie gunnedthe SmartCar up and over a curb onto a gravel divider. He gripped the dash asthe car shot out across a sidewalk and bounced back down over into the smallrotary at Carrousel du Louvre.For an instant, Sophie seemed to consider taking the shortcut across the rotaryby plowing straight ahead, through the median's perimeter hedge, and bisectingthe large circle of grass in the center.\"No!\" Langdon shouted, knowing the hedges around Carrousel du Louvre were thereto hide the perilous chasm in the center—La Pyramide Inversée—the upside-downpyramid skylight he had seen earlier from inside the museum. It was large enoughto swallow their Smart-Car in a single gulp. Fortunately, Sophie decided on themore conventional route, jamming the wheel hard to the right, circling properlyuntil she exited, cut left, and swung into the northbound lane, acceleratingtoward Rue de Rivoli.The two-tone police sirens blared louder behind them, and Langdon could see thelights now in his side view mirror. The SmartCar engine whined in protest asSophie urged it faster away from the Louvre. Fifty yards ahead, the trafficlight at Rivoli turned red. Sophie cursed under her breath and kept racingtoward it. Langdon felt his muscles tighten.\"Sophie?\"Slowing only slightly as they reached the intersection, Sophie flicked herheadlights and stole a quick glance both ways before flooring the acceleratoragain and carving a sharp left turn through the empty intersection onto Rivoli.Accelerating west for a quarter of a mile, Sophie banked to the right around awide rotary. Soon they were shooting out the other side onto the wide avenue ofChamps-Elysées.As they straightened out, Langdon turned in his seat, craning his neck to lookout the rear window toward the Louvre. The police did not seem to be chasingthem. The sea of blue lights was assembling at the museum.His heartbeat finally slowing, Langdon turned back around. \"That wasinteresting.\"Sophie didn't seem to hear. Her eyes remained fixed ahead down the longthoroughfare of Champs-Elysées, the two-mile stretch of posh storefronts thatwas often called the Fifth Avenue of Paris. The embassy was only about a mileaway, and Langdon settled into his seat. So dark the con of man. Sophie's quickthinking had been impressive. Madonna of the Rocks.Sophie had said her grandfather left her something behind the painting. A finalmessage? Langdon could not help but marvel over Saunière's brilliant hidingplace; Madonna of the Rocks was yet another fitting link in the evening's chainof interconnected symbolism. Saunière, it seemed, at every turn, was reinforcinghis fondness for the dark and mischievous side of Leonardo da Vinci.Da Vinci's original commission for Madonna of the Rocks had come from anorganization known as the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception, whichneeded a painting for the centerpiece of an altar triptych in their church ofSan Francesco in Milan. The nuns gave Leonardo specific dimensions, and thedesired theme for the painting—the Virgin Mary, baby John the Baptist, Uriel,and Baby Jesus sheltering in a cave. Although Da Vinci did as they requested,when he delivered the work, the group reacted with horror. He had filled thepainting with explosive and disturbing details.The painting showed a blue-robed Virgin Mary sitting with her arm around aninfant child, presumably Baby Jesus. Opposite Mary sat Uriel, also with aninfant, presumably baby John the Baptist. Oddly, though, rather than the usualJesus-blessing-John scenario, it was baby John who was blessing Jesus... andJesus was submitting to his authority! More troubling still, Mary was holdingone hand high above the head of infant John and making a decidedly threateninggesture—her fingers looking like eagle's talons, gripping an invisible head.Finally, the most obvious and frightening image: Just below Mary's curledfingers, Uriel was making a cutting gesture with his hand—as if slicing the neckof the invisible head gripped by Mary's claw-like hand.Langdon's students were always amused to learn that Da Vinci eventuallymollified the confraternity by painting them a second, \"watered-down\" version ofMadonna of the Rocks in which everyone was arranged in a more orthodox manner.The second version now hung in London's National Gallery under the name Virginof the Rocks, although Langdon still preferred the Louvre's more intriguingoriginal.As Sophie gunned the car up Champs-Elysées, Langdon said, \"The painting. Whatwas behind it?\"Her eyes remained on the road. \"I'll show you once we're safely inside theembassy.\"\"You'll show it to me?\" Langdon was surprised. \"He left you a physical object?\"Sophie gave a curt nod. \"Embossed with a fleur-de-lis and the initials P.S.\"Langdon couldn't believe his ears. We're going to make it, Sophie thought as she swung the SmartCar's wheel to theright, cutting sharply past the luxurious Hôtel de Crillon into Paris'stree-lined diplomatic neighborhood. The embassy was less than a mile away now.She was finally feeling like she could breathe normally again.Even as she drove, Sophie's mind remained locked on the key in her pocket, hermemories of seeing it many years ago, the gold head shaped as an equal-armedcross, the triangular shaft, the indentations, the embossed flowery seal, andthe letters P.S.Although the key barely had entered Sophie's thoughts through the years, herwork in the intelligence community had taught her plenty about security, and nowthe key's peculiar tooling no longer looked so mystifying. A laser-tooledvarying matrix. Impossible to duplicate. Rather than teeth that moved tumblers,this key's complex series of laser-burned pockmarks was examined by an electriceye. If the eye determined that the hexagonal pockmarks were correctly spaced,arranged, and rotated, then the lock would open.Sophie could not begin to imagine what a key like this opened, but she sensedRobert would be able to tell her. After all, he had described the key's embossedseal without ever seeing it. The cruciform on top implied the key belonged tosome kind of Christian organization, and yet Sophie knew of no churches thatused laser-tooled varying matrix keys.Besides, my grandfather was no Christian....Sophie had witnessed proof of that ten years ago. Ironically, it had beenanother key—a far more normal one—that had revealed his true nature to her.The afternoon had been warm when she landed at Charles de Gaulle Airport andhailed a taxi home. Grand-père will be so surprised to see me, she thought.Returning from graduate school in Britain for spring break a few days early,Sophie couldn't wait to see him and tell him all about the encryption methodsshe was studying.When she arrived at their Paris home, however, her grandfather was not there.Disappointed, she knew he had not been expecting her and was probably working atthe Louvre. But it's Saturday afternoon, she realized. He seldom worked onweekends. On weekends, he usually—Grinning, Sophie ran out to the garage. Sure enough, his car was gone. It wasthe weekend. Jacques Saunière despised city driving and owned a car for onedestination only—his vacation château in Normandy, north of Paris. Sophie, aftermonths in the congestion of London, was eager for the smells of nature and tostart her vacation right away. It was still early evening, and she decided toleave immediately and surprise him. Borrowing a friend's car, Sophie drovenorth, winding into the deserted moon-swept hills near Creully. She arrived justafter ten o'clock, turning down the long private driveway toward hergrandfather's retreat. The access road was over a mile long, and she was halfwaydown it before she could start to see the house through the trees—a mammoth, oldstone château nestled in the woods on the side of a hill.Sophie had half expected to find her grandfather asleep at this hour and wasexcited to see the house twinkling with lights. Her delight turned to surprise,however, when she arrived to find the driveway filled with parkedcars—Mercedeses, BMWs, Audis, and a Rolls-Royce.Sophie stared a moment and then burst out laughing. My grand-père, the famousrecluse! Jacques Saunière, it seemed, was far less reclusive than he liked topretend. Clearly he was hosting a party while Sophie was away at school, andfrom the looks of the automobiles, some of Paris's most influential people werein attendance.Eager to surprise him, she hurried to the front door. When she got there,though, she found it locked. She knocked. Nobody answered. Puzzled, she walkedaround and tried the back door. It too was locked. No answer.Confused, she stood a moment and listened. The only sound she heard was the coolNormandy air letting out a low moan as it swirled through the valley.No music.No voices.Nothing.In the silence of the woods, Sophie hurried to the side of the house andclambered up on a woodpile, pressing her face to the living room window. Whatshe saw inside made no sense at all.\"Nobody's here!\"The entire first floor looked deserted.Where are all the people?Heart racing, Sophie ran to the woodshed and got the spare key her grandfatherkept hidden under the kindling box. She ran to the front door and let herselfin. As she stepped into the deserted foyer, the control panel for the securitysystem started blinking red—a warning that the entrant had ten seconds to typethe proper code before the security alarms went off.He has the alarm on during a party?Sophie quickly typed the code and deactivated the system.Entering, she found the entire house uninhabited. Upstairs too. As she descendedagain to the deserted living room, she stood a moment in the silence, wonderingwhat could possibly be happening.It was then that Sophie heard it.Muffled voices. And they seemed to be coming from underneath her. Sophie couldnot imagine. Crouching, she put her ear to the floor and listened. Yes, thesound was definitely coming from below. The voices seemed to be singing, or...chanting? She was frightened. Almost more eerie than the sound itself was therealization that this house did not even have a basement.At least none I've ever seen.Turning now and scanning the living room, Sophie's eyes fell to the only objectin the entire house that seemed out of place—her grandfather's favorite antique,a sprawling Aubusson tapestry. It usually hung on the east wall beside thefireplace, but tonight it had been pulled aside on its brass rod, exposing thewall behind it.Walking toward the bare wooden wall, Sophie sensed the chanting getting louder.Hesitant, she leaned her ear against the wood. The voices were clearer now.People were definitely chanting... intoning words Sophie could not discern.The space behind this wall is hollow!Feeling around the edge of the panels, Sophie found a recessed fingerhold. Itwas discreetly crafted. A sliding door. Heart pounding, she placed her finger inthe slot and pulled it. With noiseless precision, the heavy wall slid sideways.From out of the darkness beyond, the voices echoed up.Sophie slipped through the door and found herself on a rough-hewn stonestaircase that spiraled downward. She'd been coming to this house since she wasa child and yet had no idea this staircase even existed!As she descended, the air grew cooler. The voices clearer. She heard men andwomen now. Her line of sight was limited by the spiral of the staircase, but thelast step was now rounding into view. Beyond it, she could see a small patch ofthe basement floor—stone, illuminated by the flickering orange blaze offirelight.Holding her breath, Sophie inched down another few steps and crouched down tolook. It took her several seconds to process what she was seeing.The room was a grotto—a coarse chamber that appeared to have been hollowed fromthe granite of the hillside. The only light came from torches on the walls. Inthe glow of the flames, thirty or so people stood in a circle in the center ofthe room.I'm dreaming, Sophie told herself. A dream. What else could this be?Everyone in the room was wearing a mask. The women were dressed in whitegossamer gowns and golden shoes. Their masks were white, and in their hands theycarried golden orbs. The men wore long black tunics, and their masks were black.They looked like pieces in a giant chess set. Everyone in the circle rocked backand forth and chanted in reverence to something on the floor before them...something Sophie could not see.The chanting grew steady again. Accelerating. Thundering now. Faster. Theparticipants took a step inward and knelt. In that instant, Sophie could finallysee what they all were witnessing. Even as she staggered back in horror, shefelt the image searing itself into her memory forever. Overtaken by nausea,Sophie spun, clutching at the stone walls as she clambered back up the stairs.Pulling the door closed, she fled the deserted house, and drove in a tearfulstupor back to Paris.That night, with her life shattered by disillusionment and betrayal, she packedher belongings and left her home. On the dining room table, she left a note. I WAS THERE. DON'T TRY TO FIND ME. Beside the note, she laid the old spare key from the château's woodshed. \"Sophie! Langdon's voice intruded. \"Stop! Stop!\"Emerging from the memory, Sophie slammed on the brakes, skidding to a halt.\"What? What happened?!\"Langdon pointed down the long street before them.When she saw it, Sophie's blood went cold. A hundred yards ahead, theintersection was blocked by a couple of DCPJ police cars, parked askew, theirpurpose obvious. They've sealed off Avenue Gabriel!Langdon gave a grim sigh. \"I take it the embassy is off-limits this evening?\"Down the street, the two DCPJ officers who stood beside their cars were nowstaring in their direction, apparently curious about the headlights that hadhalted so abruptly up the street from them.Okay, Sophie, turn around very slowly.Putting the SmartCar in reverse, she performed a composed three-point turn andreversed her direction. As she drove away, she heard the sound of squealingtires behind them. Sirens blared to life.Cursing, Sophie slammed down the accelerator. CHAPTER 33Sophie's SmartCar tore through the diplomatic quarter, weaving past embassiesand consulates, finally racing out a side street and taking a right turn backonto the massive thoroughfare of Champs-Elysées.Langdon sat white-knuckled in the passenger seat, twisted backward, scanningbehind them for any signs of the police. He suddenly wished he had not decidedto run. You didn't, he reminded himself. Sophie had made the decision for himwhen she threw the GPS dot out the bathroom window. Now, as they sped away fromthe embassy, serpentining through sparse traffic on Champs-Elysées, Langdon felthis options deteriorating. Although Sophie seemed to have lost the police, atleast for the moment, Langdon doubted their luck would hold for long.Behind the wheel Sophie was fishing in her sweater pocket. She removed a smallmetal object and held it out for him. \"Robert, you'd better have a look at this.This is what my grandfather left me behind Madonna of the Rocks.\"Feeling a shiver of anticipation, Langdon took the object and examined it. Itwas heavy and shaped like a cruciform. His first instinct was that he washolding a funeral pieu—a miniature version of a memorial spike designed to bestuck into the ground at a gravesite. But then he noted the shaft protrudingfrom the cruciform was prismatic and triangular. The shaft was also pockmarkedwith hundreds of tiny hexagons that appeared to be finely tooled and scatteredat random.\"It's a laser-cut key,\" Sophie told him. \"Those hexagons are read by an electriceye.\"A key? Langdon had never seen anything like it.\"Look at the other side,\" she said, changing lanes and sailing through anintersection.When Langdon turned the key, he felt his jaw drop. There, intricately embossedon the center of the cross, was a stylized fleur-de-lis with the initials P.S.!\"Sophie,\" he said, \"this is the seal I told you about! The official device ofthe Priory of Sion.\"She nodded. \"As I told you, I saw the key a long time ago. He told me never tospeak of it again.\"Langdon's eyes were still riveted on the embossed key. Its high-tech tooling andage-old symbolism exuded an eerie fusion of ancient and modern worlds.\"He told me the key opened a box where he kept many secrets.\"Langdon felt a chill to imagine what kind of secrets a man like Jacques Saunièremight keep. What an ancient brotherhood was doing with a futuristic key, Langdonhad no idea. The Priory existed for the sole purpose of protecting a secret. Asecret of incredible power. Could this key have something to do with it? Thethought was overwhelming. \"Do you know what it opens?\"Sophie looked disappointed. \"I was hoping you knew.\"Langdon remained silent as he turned the cruciform in his hand, examining it.\"It looks Christian,\" Sophie pressed.Langdon was not so sure about that. The head of this key was not the traditionallong-stemmed Christian cross but rather was a square cross—with four arms ofequal length—which predated Christianity by fifteen hundred years. This kind ofcross carried none of the Christian connotations of crucifixion associated withthe longer-stemmed Latin Cross, originated by Romans as a torture device.Langdon was always surprised how few Christians who gazed upon \"the crucifix\"realized their symbol's violent history was reflected in its very name: \"cross\"and \"crucifix\" came from the Latin verb cruciare—to torture.\"Sophie,\" he said, \"all I can tell you is that equal-armed crosses like this oneare considered peaceful crosses. Their square configurations make themimpractical for use in crucifixion, and their balanced vertical and horizontalelements convey a natural union of male and female, making them symbolicallyconsistent with Priory philosophy.\"She gave him a weary look. \"You have no idea, do you?\"Langdon frowned. \"Not a clue.\"\"Okay, we have to get off the road.\" Sophie checked her rearview mirror. \"Weneed a safe place to figure out what that key opens.\"Langdon thought longingly of his comfortable room at the Ritz. Obviously, thatwas not an option. \"How about my hosts at the American University of Paris?\"\"Too obvious. Fache will check with them.\"\"You must know people. You live here.\"\"Fache will run my phone and e-mail records, talk to my coworkers. My contactsare compromised, and finding a hotel is no good because they all requireidentification.\"Langdon wondered again if he might have been better off taking his chancesletting Fache arrest him at the Louvre. \"Let's call the embassy. I can explainthe situation and have the embassy send someone to meet us somewhere.\"\"Meet us?\" Sophie turned and stared at him as if he were crazy. \"Robert, you'redreaming. Your embassy has no jurisdiction except on their own property. Sendingsomeone to retrieve us would be considered aiding a fugitive of the Frenchgovernment. It won't happen. If you walk into your embassy and request temporaryasylum, that's one thing, but asking them to take action against French lawenforcement in the field?\" She shook her head. \"Call your embassy right now, andthey are going to tell you to avoid further damage and turn yourself over toFache. Then they'll promise to pursue diplomatic channels to get you a fairtrial.\" She gazed up the line of elegant storefronts on Champs-Elysées. \"Howmuch cash do you have?\"Langdon checked his wallet. \"A hundred dollars. A few euro. Why?\"\"Credit cards?\"\"Of course.\"As Sophie accelerated, Langdon sensed she was formulating a plan. Dead ahead, atthe end of Champs-Elysées, stood the Arc de Triomphe—Napoleon's 164-foot-talltribute to his own military potency—encircled by France's largest rotary, anine-lane behemoth.Sophie's eyes were on the rearview mirror again as they approached the rotary.\"We lost them for the time being,\" she said, \"but we won't last another fiveminutes if we stay in this car.\"So steal a different one, Langdon mused, now that we're criminals. \"What are yougoing to do?\"Sophie gunned the SmartCar into the rotary. \"Trust me.\"Langdon made no response. Trust had not gotten him very far this evening.Pulling back the sleeve of his jacket, he checked his watch—a vintage,collector's-edition Mickey Mouse wristwatch that had been a gift from hisparents on his tenth birthday. Although its juvenile dial often drew odd looks,Langdon had never owned any other watch; Disney animations had been his firstintroduction to the magic of form and color, and Mickey now served as Langdon'sdaily reminder to stay young at heart. At the moment, however, Mickey's armswere skewed at an awkward angle, indicating an equally awkward hour.2:51 A.M.\"Interesting watch,\" Sophie said, glancing at his wrist and maneuvering theSmartCar around the wide, counterclockwise rotary.\"Long story,\" he said, pulling his sleeve back down.\"I imagine it would have to be.\" She gave him a quick smile and exited therotary, heading due north, away from the city center. Barely making two greenlights, she reached the third intersection and took a hard right onto BoulevardMalesherbes. They'd left the rich, tree-lined streets of the diplomaticneighborhood and plunged into a darker industrial neighborhood. Sophie took aquick left, and a moment later, Langdon realized where they were.Gare Saint-Lazare.Ahead of them, the glass-roofed train terminal resembled the awkward offspringof an airplane hangar and a greenhouse. European train stations never slept.Even at this hour, a half-dozen taxis idled near the main entrance. Vendorsmanned carts of sandwiches and mineral water while grungy kids in backpacksemerged from the station rubbing their eyes, looking around as if trying toremember what city they were in now. Up ahead on the street, a couple of citypolicemen stood on the curb giving directions to some confused tourists.Sophie pulled her SmartCar in behind the line of taxis and parked in a red zonedespite plenty of legal parking across the street. Before Langdon could ask whatwas going on, she was out of the car. She hurried to the window of the taxi infront of them and began speaking to the driver.As Langdon got out of the SmartCar, he saw Sophie hand the taxi driver a big wadof cash. The taxi driver nodded and then, to Langdon's bewilderment, sped offwithout them.\"What happened?\" Langdon demanded, joining Sophie on the curb as the taxidisappeared.Sophie was already heading for the train station entrance. \"Come on. We'rebuying two tickets on the next train out of Paris.\"Langdon hurried along beside her. What had begun as a one-mile dash to the U.S.Embassy had now become a full-fledged evacuation from Paris. Langdon was likingthis idea less and less. CHAPTER 34The driver who collected Bishop Aringarosa from Leonardo da Vinci InternationalAirport pulled up in a small, unimpressive black Fiat sedan. Aringarosa recalleda day when all Vatican transports were big luxury cars that sported grille-platemedallions and flags emblazoned with the seal of the Holy See. Those days aregone. Vatican cars were now less ostentatious and almost always unmarked. TheVatican claimed this was to cut costs to better serve their dioceses, butAringarosa suspected it was more of a security measure. The world had gone mad,and in many parts of Europe, advertising your love of Jesus Christ was likepainting a bull's-eye on the roof of your car.Bundling his black cassock around himself, Aringarosa climbed into the back seatand settled in for the long drive to Castel Gandolfo. It would be the same ridehe had taken five months ago.Last year's trip to Rome, he sighed. The longest night of my life.Five months ago, the Vatican had phoned to request Aringarosa's immediatepresence in Rome. They offered no explanation. Your tickets are at the airport.The Holy See worked hard to retain a veil of mystery, even for its highestclergy.The mysterious summons, Aringarosa suspected, was probably a photo opportunityfor the Pope and other Vatican officials to piggyback on Opus Dei's recentpublic success—the completion of their World Headquarters in New York City.Architectural Digest had called Opus Dei's building \"a shining beacon ofCatholicism sublimely integrated with the modern landscape,\" and lately theVatican seemed to be drawn to anything and everything that included the word\"modern.\"Aringarosa had no choice but to accept the invitation, albeit reluctantly. Not afan of the current papal administration, Aringarosa, like most conservativeclergy, had watched with grave concern as the new Pope settled into his firstyear in office. An unprecedented liberal, His Holiness had secured the papacythrough one of the most controversial and unusual conclaves in Vatican history.Now, rather than being humbled by his unexpected rise to power, the Holy Fatherhad wasted no time flexing all the muscle associated with the highest office inChristendom. Drawing on an unsettling tide of liberal support within the Collegeof Cardinals, the Pope was now declaring his papal mission to be \"rejuvenationof Vatican doctrine and updating Catholicism into the third millennium.\"The translation, Aringarosa feared, was that the man was actually arrogantenough to think he could rewrite God's laws and win back the hearts of those whofelt the demands of true Catholicism had become too inconvenient in a modernworld.Aringarosa had been using all of his political sway—substantial considering thesize of the Opus Dei constituency and their bankroll—to persuade the Pope andhis advisers that softening the Church's laws was not only faithless andcowardly, but political suicide. He reminded them that previous tempering ofChurch law—the Vatican II fiasco—had left a devastating legacy: Churchattendance was now lower than ever, donations were drying up, and there were noteven enough Catholic priests to preside over their churches.People need structure and direction from the Church, Aringarosa insisted, notcoddling and indulgence!On that night, months ago, as the Fiat had left the airport, Aringarosa wassurprised to find himself heading not toward Vatican City but rather eastward upa sinuous mountain road. \"Where are we going?\" he had demanded of his driver.\"Alban Hills,\" the man replied. \"Your meeting is at Castel Gandolfo.\"The Pope's summer residence? Aringarosa had never been, nor had he ever desiredto see it. In addition to being the Pope's summer vacation home, thesixteenth-century citadel housed the Specula Vaticana—the VaticanObservatory—one of the most advanced astronomical observatories in Europe.Aringarosa had never been comfortable with the Vatican's historical need todabble in science. What was the rationale for fusing science and faith? Unbiasedscience could not possibly be performed by a man who possessed faith in God. Nordid faith have any need for physical confirmation of its beliefs.Nonetheless, there it is, he thought as Castel Gandolfo came into view, risingagainst a star-filled November sky. From the access road, Gandolfo resembled agreat stone monster pondering a suicidal leap. Perched at the very edge of acliff, the castle leaned out over the cradle of Italian civilization—the valleywhere the Curiazi and Orazi clans fought long before the founding of Rome.Even in silhouette, Gandolfo was a sight to behold—an impressive example oftiered, defensive architecture, echoing the potency of this dramatic cliffsidesetting. Sadly, Aringarosa now saw, the Vatican had ruined the building byconstructing two huge aluminum telescope domes atop the roof, leaving this oncedignified edifice looking like a proud warrior wearing a couple of party hats.When Aringarosa got out of the car, a young Jesuit priest hurried out andgreeted him. \"Bishop, welcome. I am Father Mangano. An astronomer here.\"Good for you. Aringarosa grumbled his hello and followed his host into thecastle's foyer—a wide-open space whose decor was a graceless blend ofRenaissance art and astronomy images. Following his escort up the widetravertine marble staircase, Aringarosa saw signs for conference centers,science lecture halls, and tourist information services. It amazed him to thinkthe Vatican was failing at every turn to provide coherent, stringent guidelinesfor spiritual growth and yet somehow still found time to give astrophysicslectures to tourists.\"Tell me,\" Aringarosa said to the young priest, \"when did the tail start waggingthe dog?\"The priest gave him an odd look. \"Sir?\"Aringarosa waved it off, deciding not to launch into that particular offensiveagain this evening. The Vatican has gone mad. Like a lazy parent who found iteasier to acquiesce to the whims of a spoiled child than to stand firm and teachvalues, the Church just kept softening at every turn, trying to reinvent itselfto accommodate a culture gone astray.The top floor's corridor was wide, lushly appointed, and led in only onedirection—toward a huge set of oak doors with a brass sign.BIBLIOTECA ASTRONOMICAAringarosa had heard of this place—the Vatican's Astronomy Library—rumored tocontain more than twenty-five thousand volumes, including rare works ofCopernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, and Secchi. Allegedly, it was also theplace in which the Pope's highest officers held private meetings... thosemeetings they preferred not to hold within the walls of Vatican City.Approaching the door, Bishop Aringarosa would never have imagined the shockingnews he was about to receive inside, or the deadly chain of events it would putinto motion. It was not until an hour later, as he staggered from the meeting,that the devastating implications settled in. Six months from now! he hadthought. God help us! Now, seated in the Fiat, Bishop Aringarosa realized his fists were clenched justthinking about that first meeting. He released his grip and forced a slowinhalation, relaxing his muscles.Everything will be fine, he told himself as the Fiat wound higher into themountains. Still, he wished his cell phone would ring. Why hasn't the Teachercalled me? Silas should have the keystone by now.Trying to ease his nerves, the bishop meditated on the purple amethyst in hisring. Feeling the textures of the mitre-crozier appliqué and the facets of thediamonds, he reminded himself that this ring was a symbol of power far less thanthat which he would soon attain. CHAPTER 35The inside of Gare Saint-Lazare looked like every other train station in Europe,a gaping indoor-outdoor cavern dotted with the usual suspects—homeless menholding cardboard signs, collections of bleary-eyed college kids sleeping onbackpacks and zoning out to their portable MP3 players, and clusters ofblue-clad baggage porters smoking cigarettes.Sophie raised her eyes to the enormous departure board overhead. The black andwhite tabs reshuffled, ruffling downward as the information refreshed. When theupdate was finished, Langdon eyed the offerings. The topmost listing read:LYON—RAPIDE—3:06\"I wish it left sooner,\" Sophie said, \"but Lyon will have to do.\" Sooner?Langdon checked his watch 2:59 A.M. The train left in seven minutes and theydidn't even have tickets yet.Sophie guided Langdon toward the ticket window and said, \"Buy us two ticketswith your credit card.\"\"I thought credit card usage could be traced by—\"\"Exactly.\"Langdon decided to stop trying to keep ahead of Sophie Neveu. Using his Visacard, he purchased two coach tickets to Lyon and handed them to Sophie.Sophie guided him out toward the tracks, where a familiar tone chimed overheadand a P.A. announcer gave the final boarding call for Lyon. Sixteen separatetracks spread out before them. In the distance to the right, at quay three, thetrain to Lyon was belching and wheezing in preparation for departure, but Sophiealready had her arm through Langdon's and was guiding him in the exact oppositedirection. They hurried through a side lobby, past an all-night cafe, andfinally out a side door onto a quiet street on the west side of the station.A lone taxi sat idling by the doorway.The driver saw Sophie and flicked his lights.Sophie jumped in the back seat. Langdon got in after her.As the taxi pulled away from station, Sophie took out their newly purchasedtrain tickets and tore them up.Langdon sighed. Seventy dollars well spent.It was not until their taxi had settled into a monotonous northbound hum on Ruede Clichy that Langdon felt they'd actually escaped. Out the window to hisright, he could see Montmartre and the beautiful dome of Sacré-Coeur. The imagewas interrupted by the flash of police lights sailing past them in the oppositedirection.Langdon and Sophie ducked down as the sirens faded.Sophie had told the cab driver simply to head out of the city, and from herfirmly set jaw, Langdon sensed she was trying to figure out their next move.Langdon examined the cruciform key again, holding it to the window, bringing itclose to his eyes in an effort to find any markings on it that might indicatewhere the key had been made. In the intermittent glow of passing streetlights,he saw no markings except the Priory seal.\"It doesn't make sense,\" he finally said.\"Which part?\"\"That your grandfather would go to so much trouble to give you a key that youwouldn't know what to do with.\"\"I agree.\"\"Are you sure he didn't write anything else on the back of the painting?\"\"I searched the whole area. This is all there was. This key, wedged behind thepainting. I saw the Priory seal, stuck the key in my pocket, then we left.\"Langdon frowned, peering now at the blunt end of the triangular shaft. Nothing.Squinting, he brought the key close to his eyes and examined the rim of thehead. Nothing there either. \"I think this key was cleaned recently.\"\"Why?\"\"It smells like rubbing alcohol.\"She turned. \"I'm sorry?\"\"It smells like somebody polished it with a cleaner.\" Langdon held the key tohis nose and sniffed. \"It's stronger on the other side.\" He flipped it over.\"Yes, it's alcohol-based, like it's been buffed with a cleaner or—\" Langdonstopped.\"What?\"He angled the key to the light and looked at the smooth surface on the broad armof the cross. It seemed to shimmer in places... like it was wet. \"How well didyou look at the back of this key before you put it in your pocket?\"\"What? Not well. I was in a hurry.\"Langdon turned to her. \"Do you still have the black light?\"Sophie reached in her pocket and produced the UV penlight. Langdon took it andswitched it on, shining the beam on the back of the key.The back luminesced instantly. There was writing there. In penmanship that washurried but legible.\"Well,\" Langdon said, smiling. \"I guess we know what the alcohol smell was.\" Sophie stared in amazement at the purple writing on the back of the key. 24 Rue Haxo An address! My grandfather wrote down an address!\"Where is this?\" Langdon asked.Sophie had no idea. Facing front again, she leaned forward and excitedly askedthe driver, \"Connaissez-vous la Rue Haxo?\"The driver thought a moment and then nodded. He told Sophie it was out near thetennis stadium on the western outskirts of Paris. She asked him to take themthere immediately.\"Fastest route is through Bois de Boulogne,\" the driver told her in French. \"Isthat okay?\"Sophie frowned. She could think of far less scandalous routes, but tonight shewas not going to be picky. \"Oui.\" We can shock the visiting American.Sophie looked back at the key and wondered what they would possibly find at 24Rue Haxo. A church? Some kind of Priory headquarters?Her mind filled again with images of the secret ritual she had witnessed in thebasement grotto ten years ago, and she heaved a long sigh. \"Robert, I have a lotof things to tell you.\" She paused, locking eyes with him as the taxi racedwestward. \"But first I want you to tell me everything you know about this Prioryof Sion.\" CHAPTER 36Outside the Salle des Etats, Bezu Fache was fuming as Louvre warden Grouardexplained how Sophie and Langdon had disarmed him. Why didn't you just shoot theblessed painting!\"Captain?\" Lieutenant Collet loped toward them from the direction of the commandpost. \"Captain, I just heard. They located Agent Neveu's car.\"\"Did she make the embassy?\"\"No. Train station. Bought two tickets. Train just left.\"Fache waved off warden Grouard and led Collet to a nearby alcove, addressing himin hushed tones. \"What was the destination?\"\"Lyon.\"\"Probably a decoy.\" Fache exhaled, formulating a plan. \"Okay, alert the nextstation, have the train stopped and searched, just in case. Leave her car whereit is and put plainclothes on watch in case they try to come back to it. Sendmen to search the streets around the station in case they fled on foot. Arebuses running from the station?\"\"Not at this hour, sir. Only the taxi queue.\"\"Good. Question the drivers. See if they saw anything. Then contact the taxicompany dispatcher with descriptions. I'm calling Interpol.\"Collet looked surprised. \"You're putting this on the wire?\"Fache regretted the potential embarrassment, but he saw no other choice.Close the net fast, and close it tight.The first hour was critical. Fugitives were predictable the first hour afterescape. They always needed the same thing. Travel. Lodging. Cash. The HolyTrinity. Interpol had the power to make all three disappear in the blink of aneye. By broadcast-faxing photos of Langdon and Sophie to Paris travelauthorities, hotels, and banks, Interpol would leave no options—no way to leavethe city, no place to hide, and no way to withdraw cash without beingrecognized. Usually, fugitives panicked on the street and did something stupid.Stole a car. Robbed a store. Used a bank card in desperation. Whatever mistakethey committed, they quickly made their whereabouts known to local authorities.\"Only Langdon, right?\" Collet said. \"You're not flagging Sophie Neveu. She's ourown agent.\"\"Of course I'm flagging her!\" Fache snapped. \"What good is flagging Langdon ifshe can do all his dirty work? I plan to run Neveu's employment file—friends,family, personal contacts—anyone she might turn to for help. I don't know whatshe thinks she's doing out there, but it's going to cost her one hell of a lotmore than her job!\"\"Do you want me on the phones or in the field?\"\"Field. Get over to the train station and coordinate the team. You've got thereins, but don't make a move without talking to me.\"\"Yes, sir.\" Collet ran out.Fache felt rigid as he stood in the alcove. Outside the window, the glasspyramid shone, its reflection rippling in the windswept pools. They slippedthrough my fingers. He told himself to relax.Even a trained field agent would be lucky to withstand the pressure thatInterpol was about to apply.A female cryptologist and a schoolteacher?They wouldn't last till dawn. CHAPTER 37The heavily forested park known as the Bois de Boulogne was called many things,but the Parisian cognoscenti knew it as \"the Garden of Earthly Delights.\" Theepithet, despite sounding flattering, was quite to the contrary. Anyone who hadseen the lurid Bosch painting of the same name understood the jab; the painting,like the forest, was dark and twisted, a purgatory for freaks and fetishists. Atnight, the forest's winding lanes were lined with hundreds of glistening bodiesfor hire, earthly delights to satisfy one's deepest unspoken desires—male,female, and everything in between.As Langdon gathered his thoughts to tell Sophie about the Priory of Sion, theirtaxi passed through the wooded entrance to the park and began heading west onthe cobblestone crossfare. Langdon was having trouble concentrating as ascattering of the park's nocturnal residents were already emerging from theshadows and flaunting their wares in the glare of the headlights. Ahead, twotopless teenage girls shot smoldering gazes into the taxi. Beyond them, awell-oiled black man in a G-string turned and flexed his buttocks. Beside him, agorgeous blond woman lifted her miniskirt to reveal that she was not, in fact, awoman.Heaven help me! Langdon turned his gaze back inside the cab and took a deepbreath.\"Tell me about the Priory of Sion,\" Sophie said.Langdon nodded, unable to imagine a less congruous a backdrop for the legend hewas about to tell. He wondered where to begin. The brotherhood's history spannedmore than a millennium... an astonishing chronicle of secrets, blackmail,betrayal, and even brutal torture at the hands of an angry Pope.\"The Priory of Sion,\" he began, \"was founded in Jerusalem in 1099 by a Frenchking named Godefroi de Bouillon, immediately after he had conquered the city.\"Sophie nodded, her eyes riveted on him.\"King Godefroi was allegedly the possessor of a powerful secret—a secret thathad been in his family since the time of Christ. Fearing his secret might belost when he died, he founded a secret brotherhood—the Priory of Sion—andcharged them with protecting his secret by quietly passing it on from generationto generation. During their years in Jerusalem, the Priory learned of a stash ofhidden documents buried beneath the ruins of Herod's temple, which had beenbuilt atop the earlier ruins of Solomon's Temple. These documents, theybelieved, corroborated Godefroi's powerful secret and were so explosive innature that the Church would stop at nothing to get them.\" Sophie lookeduncertain.\"The Priory vowed that no matter how long it took, these documents must berecovered from the rubble beneath the temple and protected forever, so the truthwould never die. In order to retrieve the documents from within the ruins, thePriory created a military arm—a group of nine knights called the Order of thePoor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon.\" Langdon paused. \"Morecommonly known as the Knights Templar.\"Sophie glanced up with a surprised look of recognition. Langdon had lecturedoften enough on the Knights Templar to know that almost everyone on earth hadheard of them, at least abstractedly. For academics, the Templars' history was aprecarious world where fact, lore, and misinformation had become so intertwinedthat extracting a pristine truth was almost impossible. Nowadays, Langdonhesitated even to mention the Knights Templar while lecturing because itinvariably led to a barrage of convoluted inquiries into assorted conspiracytheories.Sophie already looked troubled. \"You're saying the Knights Templar were foundedby the Priory of Sion to retrieve a collection of secret documents? I thoughtthe Templars were created to protect the Holy Land.\"\"A common misconception. The idea of protection of pilgrims was the guise underwhich the Templars ran their mission. Their true goal in the Holy Land was toretrieve the documents from beneath the ruins of the temple.\"\"And did they find them?\"Langdon grinned. \"Nobody knows for sure, but the one thing on which allacademics agree is this: The Knights discovered something down there in theruins... something that made them wealthy and powerful beyond anyone's wildestimagination.\"Langdon quickly gave Sophie the standard academic sketch of the accepted KnightsTemplar history, explaining how the Knights were in the Holy Land during theSecond Crusade and told King Baldwin II that they were there to protectChristian pilgrims on the roadways. Although unpaid and sworn to poverty, theKnights told the king they required basic shelter and requested his permissionto take up residence in the stables under the ruins of the temple. King Baldwingranted the soldiers' request, and the Knights took up their meager residenceinside the devastated shrine.The odd choice of lodging, Langdon explained, had been anything but random. TheKnights believed the documents the Priory sought were buried deep under theruins—beneath the Holy of Holies, a sacred chamber where God Himself wasbelieved to reside. Literally, the very center of the Jewish faith. For almost adecade, the nine Knights lived in the ruins, excavating in total secrecy throughsolid rock.Sophie looked over. \"And you said they discovered something?\"\"They certainly did,\" Langdon said, explaining how it had taken nine years, butthe Knights had finally found what they had been searching for. They took thetreasure from the temple and traveled to Europe, where their influence seemed tosolidify overnight.Nobody was certain whether the Knights had blackmailed the Vatican or whetherthe Church simply tried to buy the Knights' silence, but Pope Innocent IIimmediately issued an unprecedented papal bull that afforded the Knights Templarlimitless power and declared them \"a law unto themselves\"—an autonomous armyindependent of all interference from kings and prelates, both religious andpolitical.With their new carte blanche from the Vatican, the Knights Templar expanded at astaggering rate, both in numbers and political force, amassing vast estates inover a dozen countries. They began extending credit to bankrupt royals andcharging interest in return, thereby establishing modern banking and broadeningtheir wealth and influence still further.By the 1300s, the Vatican sanction had helped the Knights amass so much powerthat Pope Clement V decided that something had to be done. Working in concertwith France's King Philippe IV, the Pope devised an ingeniously planned stingoperation to quash the Templars and seize their treasure, thus taking control ofthe secrets held over the Vatican. In a military maneuver worthy of the CIA,Pope Clement issued secret sealed orders to be opened simultaneously by hissoldiers all across Europe on Friday, October 13 of 1307.At dawn on the thirteenth, the documents were unsealed and their appallingcontents revealed. Clement's letter claimed that God had visited him in a visionand warned him that the Knights Templar were heretics guilty of devil worship,homosexuality, defiling the cross, sodomy, and other blasphemous behavior. PopeClement had been asked by God to cleanse the earth by rounding up all theKnights and torturing them until they confessed their crimes against God.Clement's Machiavellian operation came off with clockwork precision. On thatday, countless Knights were captured, tortured mercilessly, and finally burnedat the stake as heretics. Echoes of the tragedy still resonated in modernculture; to this day, Friday the thirteenth was considered unlucky.Sophie looked confused. \"The Knights Templar were obliterated? I thoughtfraternities of Templars still exist today?\"\"They do, under a variety of names. Despite Clement's false charges and bestefforts to eradicate them, the Knights had powerful allies, and some managed toescape the Vatican purges. The Templars' potent treasure trove of documents,which had apparently been their source of power, was Clement's true objective,but it slipped through his fingers. The documents had long since been entrustedto the Templars' shadowy architects, the Priory of Sion, whose veil of secrecyhad kept them safely out of range of the Vatican's onslaught. As the Vaticanclosed in, the Priory smuggled their documents from a Paris preceptory by nightonto Templar ships in La Rochelle.\"\"Where did the documents go?\"Langdon shrugged. \"That mystery's answer is known only to the Priory of Sion.Because the documents remain the source of constant investigation andspeculation even today, they are believed to have been moved and rehiddenseveral times. Current speculation places the documents somewhere in the UnitedKingdom.\"Sophie looked uneasy.\"For a thousand years,\" Langdon continued, \"legends of this secret have beenpassed on. The entire collection of documents, its power, and the secret itreveals have become known by a single name—Sangreal. Hundreds of books have beenwritten about it, and few mysteries have caused as much interest amonghistorians as the Sangreal.\"\"The Sangreal? Does the word have anything to do with the French word sang orSpanish sangre—meaning 'blood'?\"Langdon nodded. Blood was the backbone of the Sangreal, and yet not in the waySophie probably imagined. \"The legend is complicated, but the important thing toremember is that the Priory guards the proof, and is purportedly awaiting theright moment in history to reveal the truth.\"\"What truth? What secret could possibly be that powerful?\"Langdon took a deep breath and gazed out at the underbelly of Paris leering inthe shadows. \"Sophie, the word Sangreal is an ancient word. It has evolved overthe years into another term... a more modern name.\" He paused. \"When I tell youits modern name, you'll realize you already know a lot about it. In fact, almosteveryone on earth has heard the story of the Sangreal.\"Sophie looked skeptical. \"I've never heard of it.\"\"Sure you have.\" Langdon smiled. \"You're just used to hearing it called by thename 'Holy Grail.' \" CHAPTER 38Sophie scrutinized Langdon in the back of the taxi. He's joking. \"The HolyGrail?\"Langdon nodded, his expression serious. \"Holy Grail is the literal meaning ofSangreal. The phrase derives from the French Sangraal, which evolved toSangreal, and was eventually split into two words, San Greal.\"Holy Grail. Sophie was surprised she had not spotted the linguistic tiesimmediately. Even so, Langdon's claim still made no sense to her. \"I thought theHoly Grail was a cup. You just told me the Sangreal is a collection of documentsthat reveals some dark secret.\"\"Yes, but the Sangreal documents are only half of the Holy Grail treasure. Theyare buried with the Grail itself... and reveal its true meaning. The documentsgave the Knights Templar so much power because the pages revealed the truenature of the Grail.\"The true nature of the Grail? Sophie felt even more lost now. The Holy Grail,she had thought, was the cup that Jesus drank from at the Last Supper and withwhich Joseph of Arimathea later caught His blood at the crucifixion. \"The HolyGrail is the Cup of Christ,\" she said. \"How much simpler could it be?\"\"Sophie,\" Langdon whispered, leaning toward her now, \"according to the Priory ofSion, the Holy Grail is not a cup at all. They claim the Grail legend—that of achalice—is actually an ingeniously conceived allegory. That is, that the Grailstory uses the chalice as a metaphor for something else, something far morepowerful.\" He paused. \"Something that fits perfectly with everything yourgrandfather has been trying to tell us tonight, including all his symbologicreferences to the sacred feminine.\"Still unsure, Sophie sensed in Langdon's patient smile that he empathized withher confusion, and yet his eyes remained earnest. \"But if the Holy Grail is nota cup,\" she asked, \"what is it?\"Langdon had known this question was coming, and yet he still felt uncertainexactly how to tell her. If he did not present the answer in the properhistorical background, Sophie would be left with a vacant air ofbewilderment—the exact expression Langdon had seen on his own editor's face afew months ago after Langdon handed him a draft of the manuscript he was workingon.\"This manuscript claims what?\" his editor had choked, setting down his wineglassand staring across his half-eaten power lunch. \"You can't be serious.\"\"Serious enough to have spent a year researching it.\"Prominent New York editor Jonas Faukman tugged nervously at his goatee. Faukmanno doubt had heard some wild book ideas in his illustrious career, but this oneseemed to have left the man flabbergasted.\"Robert,\" Faukman finally said, \"don't get me wrong. I love your work, and we'vehad a great run together. But if I agree to publish an idea like this, I'll havepeople picketing outside my office for months. Besides, it will kill yourreputation. You're a Harvard historian, for God's sake, not a pop schlockmeisterlooking for a quick buck. Where could you possibly find enough credible evidenceto support a theory like this?\"With a quiet smile Langdon pulled a piece of paper from the pocket of his tweedcoat and handed it to Faukman. The page listed a bibliography of over fiftytitles—books by well-known historians, some contemporary, some centuriesold—many of them academic bestsellers. All the book titles suggested the samepremise Langdon had just proposed. As Faukman read down the list, he looked likea man who had just discovered the earth was actually flat. \"I know some of theseauthors. They're... real historians!\"Langdon grinned. \"As you can see, Jonas, this is not only my theory. It's beenaround for a long time. I'm simply building on it. No book has yet explored thelegend of the Holy Grail from a symbologic angle. The iconographic evidence I'mfinding to support the theory is, well, staggeringly persuasive.\"Faukman was still staring at the list. \"My God, one of these books was writtenby Sir Leigh Teabing—a British Royal Historian.\"\"Teabing has spent much of his life studying the Holy Grail. I've met with him.He was actually a big part of my inspiration. He's a believer, Jonas, along withall of the others on that list.\"\"You're telling me all of these historians actually believe...\" Faukmanswallowed, apparently unable to say the words.Langdon grinned again. \"The Holy Grail is arguably the most sought-aftertreasure in human history. The Grail has spawned legends, wars, and lifelongquests. Does it make sense that it is merely a cup? If so, then certainly otherrelics should generate similar or greater interest—the Crown of Thorns, the TrueCross of the Crucifixion, the Titulus—and yet, they do not. Throughout history,the Holy Grail has been the most special.\" Langdon grinned. \"Now you know why.\"Faukman was still shaking his head. \"But with all these books written about it,why isn't this theory more widely known?\"\"These books can't possibly compete with centuries of established history,especially when that history is endorsed by the ultimate bestseller of alltime.\"Faukman's eyes went wide. \"Don't tell me Harry Potter is actually about the HolyGrail.\"\"I was referring to the Bible.\"Faukman cringed. \"I knew that.\" \"Laissez-le!\" Sophie's shouts cut the air inside the taxi. \"Put it down!\"Langdon jumped as Sophie leaned forward over the seat and yelled at the taxidriver. Langdon could see the driver was clutching his radio mouthpiece andspeaking into it.Sophie turned now and plunged her hand into the pocket of Langdon's tweedjacket. Before Langdon knew what had happened, she had yanked out the pistol,swung it around, and was pressing it to the back of the driver's head. Thedriver instantly dropped his radio, raising his one free hand overhead.\"Sophie!\" Langdon choked. \"What the hell—\"\"Arrêtez!\" Sophie commanded the driver.Trembling, the driver obeyed, stopping the car and putting it in park.It was then that Langdon heard the metallic voice of the taxi company'sdispatcher coming from the dashboard. \"...qui s'appette Agent Sophie Neveu...\"the radio crackled. \"Et un Américain, Robert Langdon...\"Langdon's muscles turned rigid. They found us already?\"Descendez,\" Sophie demanded.The trembling driver kept his arms over his head as he got out of his taxi andtook several steps backward.Sophie had rolled down her window and now aimed the gun outside at thebewildered cabbie. \"Robert,\" she said quietly, \"take the wheel. You're driving.\"Langdon was not about to argue with a woman wielding a gun. He climbed out ofthe car and jumped back in behind the wheel. The driver was yelling curses, hisarms still raised over his head.\"Robert,\" Sophie said from the back seat, \"I trust you've seen enough of ourmagic forest?\"He nodded. Plenty.\"Good. Drive us out of here.\"Langdon looked down at the car's controls and hesitated. Shit. He groped for thestick shift and clutch. \"Sophie? Maybe you—\"\"Go!\" she yelled.Outside, several hookers were walking over to see what was going on. One womanwas placing a call on her cell phone. Langdon depressed the clutch and jostledthe stick into what he hoped was first gear. He touched the accelerator, testingthe gas.Langdon popped the clutch. The tires howled as the taxi leapt forward,fishtailing wildly and sending the gathering crowd diving for cover. The womanwith the cell phone leapt into the woods, only narrowly avoiding being run down.\"Doucement!\" Sophie said, as the car lurched down the road. \"What are youdoing?\"\"I tried to warn you,\" he shouted over the sound of gnashing gears. \"I drive anautomatic!\" CHAPTER 39Although the spartan room in the brownstone on Rue La Bruyère had witnessed alot of suffering, Silas doubted anything could match the anguish now grippinghis pale body. I was deceived. Everything is lost.Silas had been tricked. The brothers had lied, choosing death instead ofrevealing their true secret. Silas did not have the strength to call theTeacher. Not only had Silas killed the only four people who knew where thekeystone was hidden, he had killed a nun inside Saint-Sulpice. She was workingagainst God! She scorned the work of Opus Dei!A crime of impulse, the woman's death complicated matters greatly. BishopAringarosa had placed the phone call that got Silas into Saint-Sulpice; whatwould the abbé think when he discovered the nun was dead? Although Silas hadplaced her back in her bed, the wound on her head was obvious. Silas hadattempted to replace the broken tiles in the floor, but that damage too wasobvious. They would know someone had been there.Silas had planned to hide within Opus Dei when his task here was complete.Bishop Aringarosa will protect me. Silas could imagine no more blissfulexistence than a life of meditation and prayer deep within the walls of OpusDei's headquarters in New York City. He would never again set foot outside.Everything he needed was within that sanctuary. Nobody will miss me.Unfortunately, Silas knew, a prominent man like Bishop Aringarosa could notdisappear so easily.I have endangered the bishop. Silas gazed blankly at the floor and ponderedtaking his own life. After all, it had been Aringarosa who gave Silas life inthe first place... in that small rectory in Spain, educating him, giving himpurpose.\"My friend,\" Aringarosa had told him, \"you were born an albino. Do not letothers shame you for this. Do you not understand how special this makes you?Were you not aware that Noah himself was an albino?\"\"Noah of the Ark?\" Silas had never heard this.Aringarosa was smiling. \"Indeed, Noah of the Ark. An albino. Like you, he hadskin white like an angel. Consider this. Noah saved all of life on the planet.You are destined for great things, Silas. The Lord has freed you for a reason.You have your calling. The Lord needs your help to do His work.\"Over time, Silas learned to see himself in a new light. I am pure. White.Beautiful. Like an angel.At the moment, though, in his room at the residence hall, it was his father'sdisappointed voice that whispered to him from the past.Tu es un désastre. Un spectre.Kneeling on the wooden floor, Silas prayed for forgiveness. Then, stripping offhis robe, he reached again for the Discipline. CHAPTER 40Struggling with the gear shift, Langdon managed to maneuver the hijacked taxi tothe far side of the Bois de Boulogne while stalling only twice. Unfortunately,the inherent humor in the situation was overshadowed by the taxi dispatcherrepeatedly hailing their cab over the radio.\"Voiture cinq-six-trois. Où êtes-vous? Répondez!\"When Langdon reached the exit of the park, he swallowed his machismo and jammedon the brakes. \"You'd better drive.\"Sophie looked relieved as she jumped behind the wheel. Within seconds she hadthe car humming smoothly westward along Allée de Longchamp, leaving the Gardenof Earthly Delights behind.\"Which way is Rue Haxo?\" Langdon asked, watching Sophie edge the speedometerover a hundred kilometers an hour.Sophie's eyes remained focused on the road. \"The cab driver said it's adjacentto the Roland Garros tennis stadium. I know that area.\"Langdon pulled the heavy key from his pocket again, feeling the weight in hispalm. He sensed it was an object of enormous consequence. Quite possibly the keyto his own freedom.Earlier, while telling Sophie about the Knights Templar, Langdon had realizedthat this key, in addition to having the Priory seal embossed on it, possessed amore subtle tie to the Priory of Sion. The equal-armed cruciform was symbolic ofbalance and harmony but also of the Knights Templar. Everyone had seen thepaintings of Knights Templar wearing white tunics emblazoned with redequal-armed crosses. Granted, the arms of the Templar cross were slightly flaredat the ends, but they were still of equal length.A square cross. Just like the one on this key.Langdon felt his imagination starting to run wild as he fantasized about whatthey might find. The Holy Grail. He almost laughed out loud at the absurdity ofit. The Grail was believed to be somewhere in England, buried in a hiddenchamber beneath one of the many Templar churches, where it had been hidden sinceat least 1500.The era of Grand Master Da Vinci.The Priory, in order to keep their powerful documents safe, had been forced tomove them many times in the early centuries. Historians now suspected as many assix different Grail relocations since its arrival in Europe from Jerusalem. Thelast Grail \"sighting\" had been in 1447 when numerous eyewitnesses described afire that had broken out and almost engulfed the documents before they werecarried to safety in four huge chests that each required six men to carry. Afterthat, nobody claimed to see the Grail ever again. All that remained wereoccasional whisperings that it was hidden in Great Britain, the land of KingArthur and the Knights of the Round Table.Wherever it was, two important facts remained:Leonardo knew where the Grail resided during his lifetime.That hiding place had probably not changed to this day.For this reason, Grail enthusiasts still pored over Da Vinci's art and diariesin hopes of unearthing a hidden clue as to the Grail's current location. Someclaimed the mountainous backdrop in Madonna of the Rocks matched the topographyof a series of cave-ridden hills in Scotland. Others insisted that thesuspicious placement of disciples in The Last Supper was some kind of code.Still others claimed that X rays of the Mona Lisa revealed she originally hadbeen painted wearing a lapis lazuli pendant of Isis—a detail Da Vincipurportedly later decided to paint over. Langdon had never seen any evidence ofthe pendant, nor could he imagine how it could possibly reveal the Holy Grail,and yet Grail aficionados still discussed it ad nauseum on Internet bulletinboards and worldwide-web chat rooms.Everyone loves a conspiracy.And the conspiracies kept coming. Most recently, of course, had been theearthshaking discovery that Da Vinci's famed Adoration of the Magi was hiding adark secret beneath its layers of paint. Italian art diagnostician MaurizioSeracini had unveiled the unsettling truth, which the New York Times Magazinecarried prominently in a story titled \"The Leonardo Cover-Up.\"Seracini had revealed beyond any doubt that while the Adoration's gray-greensketched underdrawing was indeed Da Vinci's work, the painting itself was not.The truth was that some anonymous painter had filled in Da Vinci's sketch like apaint-by-numbers years after Da Vinci's death. Far more troubling, however, waswhat lay beneath the impostor's paint. Photographs taken with infraredreflectography and X ray suggested that this rogue painter, while filling in DaVinci's sketched study, had made suspicious departures from the underdrawing...as if to subvert Da Vinci's true intention. Whatever the true nature of theunderdrawing, it had yet to be made public. Even so, embarrassed officials atFlorence's Uffizi Gallery immediately banished the painting to a warehouseacross the street. Visitors at the gallery's Leonardo Room now found amisleading and unapologetic plaque where the Adoration once hung. THIS WORK IS UNDERGOINGDIAGNOSTIC TESTS IN PREPARATIONFOR RESTORATION. In the bizarre underworld of modern Grail seekers, Leonardo da Vinci remainedthe quest's great enigma. His artwork seemed bursting to tell a secret, and yetwhatever it was remained hidden, perhaps beneath a layer of paint, perhapsenciphered in plain view, or perhaps nowhere at all. Maybe Da Vinci's plethoraof tantalizing clues was nothing but an empty promise left behind to frustratethe curious and bring a smirk to the face of his knowing Mona Lisa.\"Is it possible,\" Sophie asked, drawing Langdon back, \"that the key you'reholding unlocks the hiding place of the Holy Grail?\"Langdon's laugh sounded forced, even to him. \"I really can't imagine. Besides,the Grail is believed to be hidden in the United Kingdom somewhere, not France.\"He gave her the quick history.\"But the Grail seems the only rational conclusion,\" she insisted. \"We have anextremely secure key, stamped with the Priory of Sion seal, delivered to us by amember of the Priory of Sion—a brotherhood which, you just told me, areguardians of the Holy Grail.\"Langdon knew her contention was logical, and yet intuitively he could notpossibly accept it. Rumors existed that the Priory had vowed someday to bringthe Grail back to France to a final resting place, but certainly no historicalevidence existed to suggest that this indeed had happened. Even if the Prioryhad managed to bring the Grail back to France, the address 24 Rue Haxo near atennis stadium hardly sounded like a noble final resting place. \"Sophie, Ireally don't see how this key could have anything to do with the Grail.\"\"Because the Grail is supposed to be in England?\"\"Not only that. The location of the Holy Grail is one of the best kept secretsin history. Priory members wait decades proving themselves trustworthy beforebeing elevated to the highest echelons of the fraternity and learning where theGrail is. That secret is protected by an intricate system of compartmentalizedknowledge, and although the Priory brotherhood is very large, only four membersat any given time know where the Grail is hidden—the Grand Master and his threesénéchaux. The probability of your grandfather being one of those four toppeople is very slim.\"My grandfather was one of them, Sophie thought, pressing down on theaccelerator. She had an image stamped in her memory that confirmed hergrandfather's status within the brotherhood beyond any doubt.\"And even if your grandfather were in the upper echelon, he would never beallowed to reveal anything to anyone outside the brotherhood. It isinconceivable that he would bring you into the inner circle.\"I've already been there, Sophie thought, picturing the ritual in the basement.She wondered if this were the moment to tell Langdon what she had witnessed thatnight in the Normandy château. For ten years now, simple shame had kept her fromtelling a soul. Just thinking about it, she shuddered. Sirens howled somewherein the distance, and she felt a thickening shroud of fatigue settling over her.\"There!\" Langdon said, feeling excited to see the huge complex of the RolandGarros tennis stadium looming ahead.Sophie snaked her way toward the stadium. After several passes, they located theintersection of Rue Haxo and turned onto it, driving in the direction of thelower numbers. The road became more industrial, lined with businesses.We need number twenty-four, Langdon told himself, realizing he was secretlyscanning the horizon for the spires of a church. Don't be ridiculous. Aforgotten Templar church in this neighborhood?\"There it is,\" Sophie exclaimed, pointing.Langdon's eyes followed to the structure ahead.What in the world?The building was modern. A squat citadel with a giant, neon equal-armed crossemblazoned atop its facade. Beneath the cross were the words:DEPOSITORY BANK OF ZURICHLangdon was thankful not to have shared his Templar church hopes with Sophie. Acareer hazard of symbologists was a tendency to extract hidden meaning fromsituations that had none. In this case, Langdon had entirely forgotten that thepeaceful, equal-armed cross had been adopted as the perfect symbol for the flagof neutral Switzerland.At least the mystery was solved.Sophie and Langdon were holding the key to a Swiss bank deposit box. CHAPTER 41Outside Castel Gandolfo, an updraft of mountain air gushed over the top of thecliff and across the high bluff, sending a chill through Bishop Aringarosa as hestepped from the Fiat. I should have worn more than this cassock, he thought,fighting the reflex to shiver. The last thing he needed to appear tonight wasweak or fearful.The castle was dark save the windows at the very top of the building, whichglowed ominously. The library, Aringarosa thought. They are awake and waiting.He ducked his head against the wind and continued on without so much as a glancetoward the observatory domes.The priest who greeted him at the door looked sleepy. He was the same priest whohad greeted Aringarosa five months ago, albeit tonight he did so with much lesshospitality. \"We were worried about you, Bishop,\" the priest said, checking hiswatch and looking more perturbed than worried.\"My apologies. Airlines are so unreliable these days.\"The priest mumbled something inaudible and then said, \"They are waitingupstairs. I will escort you up.\"The library was a vast square room with dark wood from floor to ceiling. On allsides, towering bookcases burgeoned with volumes. The floor was amber marblewith black basalt trim, a handsome reminder that this building had once been apalace.\"Welcome, Bishop,\" a man's voice said from across the room.Aringarosa tried to see who had spoken, but the lights were ridiculouslylow—much lower than they had been on his first visit, when everything wasablaze. The night of stark awakening. Tonight, these men sat in the shadows, asif they were somehow ashamed of what was about to transpire.Aringarosa entered slowly, regally even. He could see the shapes of three men ata long table on the far side of the room. The silhouette of the man in themiddle was immediately recognizable—the obese Secretariat Vaticana, overlord ofall legal matters within Vatican City. The other two were high-ranking Italiancardinals.Aringarosa crossed the library toward them. \"My humble apologies for the hour.We're on different time zones. You must be tired.\"\"Not at all,\" the secretariat said, his hands folded on his enormous belly. \"Weare grateful you have come so far. The least we can do is be awake to meet you.Can we offer you some coffee or refreshments?\"\"I'd prefer we don't pretend this is a social visit. I have another plane tocatch. Shall we get to business?\"\"Of course,\" the secretariat said. \"You have acted more quickly than weimagined.\"\"Have I?\"\"You still have a month.\"\"You made your concerns known five months ago,\" Aringarosa said. \"Why should Iwait?\"\"Indeed. We are very pleased with your expediency.\"Aringarosa's eyes traveled the length of the long table to a large blackbriefcase. \"Is that what I requested?\"\"It is.\" The secretariat sounded uneasy. \"Although, I must admit, we areconcerned with the request. It seems quite...\"\"Dangerous,\" one of the cardinals finished. \"Are you certain we cannot wire itto you somewhere? The sum is exorbitant.\"Freedom is expensive. \"I have no concerns for my own safety. God is with me.\"The men actually looked doubtful.\"The funds are exactly as I requested?\"The secretariat nodded. \"Large-denomination bearer bonds drawn on the VaticanBank. Negotiable as cash anywhere in the world.\"Aringarosa walked to the end of the table and opened the briefcase. Inside weretwo thick stacks of bonds, each embossed with the Vatican seal and the titlePORTATORE, making the bonds redeemable to whoever was holding them.The secretariat looked tense. \"I must say, Bishop, all of us would feel lessapprehensive if these funds were in cash.\"I could not lift that much cash, Aringarosa thought, closing the case. \"Bondsare negotiable as cash. You said so yourself.\"The cardinals exchanged uneasy looks, and finally one said, \"Yes, but thesebonds are traceable directly to the Vatican Bank.\"Aringarosa smiled inwardly. That was precisely the reason the Teacher suggestedAringarosa get the money in Vatican Bank bonds. It served as insurance. We areall in this together now. \"This is a perfectly legal transaction,\" Aringarosadefended. \"Opus Dei is a personal prelature of Vatican City, and His Holinesscan disperse monies however he sees fit. No law has been broken here.\"\"True, and yet...\" The secretariat leaned forward and his chair creaked underthe burden. \"We have no knowledge of what you intend to do with these funds, andif it is in any way illegal...\"\"Considering what you are asking of me,\" Aringarosa countered, \"what I do withthis money is not your concern.\"There was a long silence.They know I'm right, Aringarosa thought. \"Now, I imagine you have something forme to sign?\"They all jumped, eagerly pushing the paper toward him, as if they wished hewould simply leave.Aringarosa eyed the sheet before him. It bore the papal seal. \"This is identicalto the copy you sent me?\"\"Exactly.\"Aringarosa was surprised how little emotion he felt as he signed the document.The three men present, however, seemed to sigh in relief.\"Thank you, Bishop,\" the secretariat said. \"Your service to the Church willnever be forgotten.\"Aringarosa picked up the briefcase, sensing promise and authority in its weight.The four men looked at one another for a moment as if there were something moreto say, but apparently there was not. Aringarosa turned and headed for the door.\"Bishop?\" one of the cardinals called out as Aringarosa reached the threshold.Aringarosa paused, turning. \"Yes?\"\"Where will you go from here?\"Aringarosa sensed the query was more spiritual than geographical, and yet he hadno intention of discussing morality at this hour. \"Paris,\" he said, and walkedout the door. CHAPTER 42The Depository Bank of Zurich was a twenty-four-hour Geldschrank bank offeringthe full modern array of anonymous services in the tradition of the Swissnumbered account. Maintaining offices in Zurich, Kuala Lumpur, New York, andParis, the bank had expanded its services in recent years to offer anonymouscomputer source code escrow services and faceless digitized backup.The bread and butter of its operation was by far its oldest and simplestoffering—the anonyme Lager—blind drop services, otherwise known as anonymoussafe-deposit boxes. Clients wishing to store anything from stock certificates tovaluable paintings could deposit their belongings anonymously, through a seriesof high-tech veils of privacy, withdrawing items at any time, also in totalanonymity.As Sophie pulled the taxi to a stop in front of their destination, Langdon gazedout at the building's uncompromising architecture and sensed the Depository Bankof Zurich was a firm with little sense of humor. The building was a windowlessrectangle that seemed to be forged entirely of dull steel. Resembling anenormous metal brick, the edifice sat back from the road with afifteen-foot-tall, neon, equilateral cross glowing over its facade.Switzerland's reputation for secrecy in banking had become one of the country'smost lucrative exports. Facilities like this had become controversial in the artcommunity because they provided a perfect place for art thieves to hide stolengoods, for years if necessary, until the heat was off. Because deposits wereprotected from police inspection by privacy laws and were attached to numberedaccounts rather than people's names, thieves could rest easily knowing theirstolen goods were safe and could never be traced to them.Sophie stopped the taxi at an imposing gate that blocked the bank's driveway—acement-lined ramp that descended beneath the building. A video camera overheadwas aimed directly at them, and Langdon had the feeling that this camera, unlikethose at the Louvre, was authentic.Sophie rolled down the window and surveyed the electronic podium on the driver'sside. An LCD screen provided directions in seven languages. Topping the list wasEnglish. INSERT KEY. Sophie took the gold laser-pocked key from her pocket and turned her attentionback to the podium. Below the screen was a triangular hole.\"Something tells me it will fit,\" Langdon said.Sophie aligned the key's triangular shaft with the hole and inserted it, slidingit in until the entire shaft had disappeared. This key apparently required noturning. Instantly, the gate began to swing open. Sophie took her foot off thebrake and coasted down to a second gate and podium. Behind her, the first gateclosed, trapping them like a ship in a lock.Langdon disliked the constricted sensation. Let's hope this second gate workstoo.This second podium bore familiar directions. INSERT KEY. When Sophie inserted the key, the second gate immediately opened. Moments laterthey were winding down the ramp into the belly of the structure.The private garage was small and dim, with spaces for about a dozen cars. At thefar end, Langdon spied the building's main entrance. A red carpet stretchedacross the cement floor, welcoming visitors to a huge door that appeared to beforged of solid metal.Talk about mixed messages, Langdon thought. Welcome and keep out.Sophie pulled the taxi into a parking space near the entrance and killed theengine. \"You'd better leave the gun here.\"With pleasure, Langdon thought, sliding the pistol under the seat.Sophie and Langdon got out and walked up the red carpet toward the slab ofsteel. The door had no handle, but on the wall beside it was another triangularkeyhole. No directions were posted this time.\"Keeps out the slow learners,\" Langdon said.Sophie laughed, looking nervous. \"Here we go.\" She stuck the key in the hole,and the door swung inward with a low hum. Exchanging glances, Sophie and Langdonentered. The door shut with a thud behind them.The foyer of the Depository Bank of Zurich employed as imposing a decor as anyLangdon had ever seen. Where most banks were content with the usual polishedmarble and granite, this one had opted for wall-to-wall metal and rivets.Who's their decorator? Langdon wondered. Allied Steel?Sophie looked equally intimidated as her eyes scanned the lobby.The gray metal was everywhere—the floor, walls, counters, doors, even the lobbychairs appeared to be fashioned of molded iron. Nonetheless, the effect wasimpressive. The message was clear: You are walking into a vault.A large man behind the counter glanced up as they entered. He turned off thesmall television he was watching and greeted them with a pleasant smile. Despitehis enormous muscles and visible sidearm, his diction chimed with the polishedcourtesy of a Swiss bellhop.\"Bonsoir,\" he said. \"How may I help you?\"The dual-language greeting was the newest hospitality trick of the Europeanhost. It presumed nothing and opened the door for the guest to reply inwhichever language was more comfortable.Sophie replied with neither. She simply laid the gold key on the counter infront of the man.The man glanced down and immediately stood straighter. \"Of course. Your elevatoris at the end of the hall. I will alert someone that you are on your way.\"Sophie nodded and took her key back. \"Which floor?\"The man gave her an odd look. \"Your key instructs the elevator which floor.\"She smiled. \"Ah, yes.\" The guard watched as the two newcomers made their way to the elevators, insertedtheir key, boarded the lift, and disappeared. As soon as the door had closed, hegrabbed the phone. He was not calling to alert anyone of their arrival; therewas no need for that. A vault greeter already had been alerted automaticallywhen the client's key was inserted outside in the entry gate.Instead, the guard was calling the bank's night manager. As the line rang, theguard switched the television back on and stared at it. The news story he hadbeen watching was just ending. It didn't matter. He got another look at the twofaces on the television.The manager answered. \"Oui?\"\"We have a situation down here.\"\"What's happening?\" the manager demanded.\"The French police are tracking two fugitives tonight.\"\"So?\"\"Both of them just walked into our bank.\"The manager cursed quietly. \"Okay. I'll contact Monsieur Vernet immediately.\"The guard then hung up and placed a second call. This one to Interpol. Langdon was surprised to feel the elevator dropping rather than climbing. He hadno idea how many floors they had descended beneath the Depository Bank of Zurichbefore the door finally opened. He didn't care. He was happy to be out of theelevator.Displaying impressive alacrity, a host was already standing there to greet them.He was elderly and pleasant, wearing a neatly pressed flannel suit that made himlook oddly out of place—an old-world banker in a high-tech world.\"Bonsoir,\" the man said. \"Good evening. Would you be so kind as to follow me,s'il vous plait?\" Without waiting for a response, he spun on his heel and strodebriskly down a narrow metal corridor.Langdon walked with Sophie down a series of corridors, past several large roomsfilled with blinking mainframe computers.\"Voici,\" their host said, arriving at a steel door and opening it for them.\"Here you are.\"Langdon and Sophie stepped into another world. The small room before them lookedlike a lavish sitting room at a fine hotel. Gone were the metal and rivets,replaced with oriental carpets, dark oak furniture, and cushioned chairs. On thebroad desk in the middle of the room, two crystal glasses sat beside an openedbottle of Perrier, its bubbles still fizzing. A pewter pot of coffee steamedbeside it.Clockwork, Langdon thought. Leave it to the Swiss.The man gave a perceptive smile. \"I sense this is your first visit to us?\"Sophie hesitated and then nodded.\"Understood. Keys are often passed on as inheritance, and our first-time usersare invariably uncertain of the protocol.\" He motioned to the table of drinks.\"This room is yours as long as you care to use it.\"\"You say keys are sometimes inherited?\" Sophie asked.\"Indeed. Your key is like a Swiss numbered account, which are often willedthrough generations. On our gold accounts, the shortest safety-deposit box leaseis fifty years. Paid in advance. So we see plenty of family turnover.\"Langdon stared. \"Did you say fifty years?\"\"At a minimum,\" their host replied. \"Of course, you can purchase much longerleases, but barring further arrangements, if there is no activity on an accountfor fifty years, the contents of that safe-deposit box are automaticallydestroyed. Shall I run through the process of accessing your box?\"Sophie nodded. \"Please.\"Their host swept an arm across the luxurious salon. \"This is your privateviewing room. Once I leave the room, you may spend all the time you need in hereto review and modify the contents of your safe-deposit box, which arrives...over here.\" He walked them to the far wall where a wide conveyor belt enteredthe room in a graceful curve, vaguely resembling a baggage claim carousel. \"Youinsert your key in that slot there....\" The man pointed to a large electronicpodium facing the conveyor belt. The podium had a familiar triangular hole.\"Once the computer confirms the markings on your key, you enter your accountnumber, and your safe-deposit box will be retrieved robotically from the vaultbelow for your inspection. When you are finished with your box, you place itback on the conveyor belt, insert your key again, and the process is reversed.Because everything is automated, your privacy is guaranteed, even from the staffof this bank. If you need anything at all, simply press the call button on thetable in the center of the room.\"Sophie was about to ask a question when a telephone rang. The man looked puzzledand embarrassed. \"Excuse me, please.\" He walked over to the phone, which wassitting on the table beside the coffee and Perrier.\"Oui?\" he answered.His brow furrowed as he listened to the caller. \"Oui... oui... d'accord.\" Hehung up, and gave them an uneasy smile. \"I'm sorry, I must leave you now. Makeyourselves at home.\" He moved quickly toward the door.\"Excuse me,\" Sophie called. \"Could you clarify something before you go? Youmentioned that we enter an account number?\"The man paused at the door, looking pale. \"But of course. Like most Swiss banks,our safe-deposit boxes are attached to a number, not a name. You have a key anda personal account number known only to you. Your key is only half of youridentification. Your personal account number is the other half. Otherwise, ifyou lost your key, anyone could use it.\"Sophie hesitated. \"And if my benefactor gave me no account number?\"The banker's heart pounded. Then you obviously have no business here! He gavethem a calm smile. \"I will ask someone to help you. He will be in shortly.\"Leaving, the banker closed the door behind him and twisted a heavy lock, sealingthem inside. Across town, Collet was standing in the Gare du Nord train terminal when hisphone rang.It was Fache. \"Interpol got a tip,\" he said. \"Forget the train. Langdon andNeveu just walked into the Paris branch of the Depository Bank of Zurich. I wantyour men over there right away.\"\"Any leads yet on what Saunière was trying to tell Agent Neveu and RobertLangdon?\"Fache's tone was cold. \"If you arrest them, Lieutenant Collet, then I can askthem personally.\"Collet took the hint. \"Twenty-four Rue Haxo. Right away, Captain.\" He hung upand radioed his men. CHAPTER 43André Vernet—president of the Paris branch of the Depository Bank ofZurich—lived in a lavish flat above the bank. Despite his plush accommodations,he had always dreamed of owning a riverside apartment on L'lle Saint-Louis,where he could rub shoulders with the true cognoscenti, rather than here, wherehe simply met the filthy rich.When I retire, Vernet told himself, I will fill my cellar with rare Bordeaux,adorn my salon with a Fragonard and perhaps a Boucher, and spend my days huntingfor antique furniture and rare books in the Quartier Latin.Tonight, Vernet had been awake only six and a half minutes. Even so, as hehurried through the bank's underground corridor, he looked as if his personaltailor and hairdresser had polished him to a fine sheen. Impeccably dressed in asilk suit, Vernet sprayed some breath spray in his mouth and tightened his tieas he walked. No stranger to being awoken to attend to his international clientsarriving from different time zones, Vernet modeled his sleep habits after theMaasai warriors—the African tribe famous for their ability to rise from thedeepest sleep to a state of total battle readiness in a matter of seconds.Battle ready, Vernet thought, fearing the comparison might beuncharacteristically apt tonight. The arrival of a gold key client alwaysrequired an extra flurry of attention, but the arrival of a gold key client whowas wanted by the Judicial Police would be an extremely delicate matter. Thebank had enough battles with law enforcement over the privacy rights of theirclients without proof that some of them were criminals.Five minutes, Vernet told himself. I need these people out of my bank before thepolice arrive.If he moved quickly, this impending disaster could be deftly sidestepped. Vernetcould tell the police that the fugitives in question had indeed walked into hisbank as reported, but because they were not clients and had no account number,they were turned away. He wished the damned watchman had not called Interpol.Discretion was apparently not part of the vocabulary of a 15-euro-per-hourwatchman.Stopping at the doorway, he took a deep breath and loosened his muscles. Then,forcing a balmy smile, he unlocked the door and swirled into the room like awarm breeze.\"Good evening,\" he said, his eyes finding his clients. \"I am André Vernet. Howcan I be of serv—\" The rest of the sentence lodged somewhere beneath his Adam'sapple. The woman before him was as unexpected a visitor as Vernet had ever had. \"I'm sorry, do we know each other?\" Sophie asked. She did not recognize thebanker, but he for a moment looked as if he'd seen a ghost.\"No...,\" the bank president fumbled. \"I don't... believe so. Our services areanonymous.\" He exhaled and forced a calm smile. \"My assistant tells me you havea gold key but no account number? Might I ask how you came by this key?\"\"My grandfather gave it to me,\" Sophie replied, watching the man closely. Hisuneasiness seemed more evident now.\"Really? Your grandfather gave you the key but failed to give you the accountnumber?\"\"I don't think he had time,\" Sophie said. \"He was murdered tonight.\"Her words sent the man staggering backward. \"Jacques Saunière is dead?\" hedemanded, his eyes filling with horror. \"But... how?!\"Now it was Sophie who reeled, numb with shock. \"You knew my grandfather?\"Banker André Vernet looked equally astounded, steadying himself by leaning on anend table. \"Jacques and I were dear friends. When did this happen?\"\"Earlier this evening. Inside the Louvre.\"Vernet walked to a deep leather chair and sank into it. \"I need to ask you botha very important question.\" He glanced up at Langdon and then back to Sophie.\"Did either of you have anything to do with his death?\"\"No!\" Sophie declared. \"Absolutely not.\"Vernet's face was grim, and he paused, pondering. \"Your pictures are beingcirculated by Interpol. This is how I recognized you. You're wanted for amurder.\"Sophie slumped. Fache ran an Interpol broadcast already? It seemed the captainwas more motivated than Sophie had anticipated. She quickly told Vernet whoLangdon was and what had happened inside the Louvre tonight.Vernet looked amazed. \"And as your grandfather was dying, he left you a messagetelling you to find Mr. Langdon?\"\"Yes. And this key.\" Sophie laid the gold key on the coffee table in front ofVernet, placing the Priory seal face down.Vernet glanced at the key but made no move to touch it. \"He left you only thiskey? Nothing else? No slip of paper?\"Sophie knew she had been in a hurry inside the Louvre, but she was certain shehad seen nothing else behind Madonna of the Rocks. \"No. Just the key.\"Vernet gave a helpless sigh. \"I'm afraid every key is electronically paired witha ten-digit account number that functions as a password. Without that number,your key is worthless.\"Ten digits. Sophie reluctantly calculated the cryptographic odds. Over tenbillion possible choices. Even if she could bring in DCPJ's most powerfulparallel processing computers, she still would need weeks to break the code.\"Certainly, monsieur, considering the circumstances, you can help us.\"\"I'm sorry. I truly can do nothing. Clients select their own account numbers viaa secure terminal, meaning account numbers are known only to the client andcomputer. This is one way we ensure anonymity. And the safety of our employees.\"Sophie understood. Convenience stores did the same thing. EMPLOYEES DO NOT HAVEKEYS TO THE SAFE. This bank obviously did not want to risk someone stealing akey and then holding an employee hostage for the account number.Sophie sat down beside Langdon, glanced down at the key and then up at Vernet.\"Do you have any idea what my grandfather is storing in your bank?\"\"None whatsoever. That is the definition of a Geldschrank bank.\"\"Monsieur Vernet,\" she pressed, \"our time tonight is short. I am going to bevery direct if I may.\" She reached out to the gold key and flipped it over,watching the man's eyes as she revealed the Priory of Sion seal. \"Does thesymbol on this key mean anything to you?\"Vernet glanced down at the fleur-de-lis seal and made no reaction. \"No, but manyof our clients emboss corporate logos or initials onto their keys.\"Sophie sighed, still watching him carefully. \"This seal is the symbol of asecret society known as the Priory of Sion.\"Vernet again showed no reaction. \"I know nothing of this. Your grandfather was afriend, but we spoke mostly of business.\" The man adjusted his tie, lookingnervous now.\"Monsieur Vernet,\" Sophie pressed, her tone firm. \"My grandfather called metonight and told me he and I were in grave danger. He said he had to give mesomething. He gave me a key to your bank. Now he is dead. Anything you can tellus would be helpful.\"Vernet broke a sweat. \"We need to get out of the building. I'm afraid the policewill arrive shortly. My watchman felt obliged to call Interpol.\"Sophie had feared as much. She took one last shot. \"My grandfather said heneeded to tell me the truth about my family. Does that mean anything to you?\"\"Mademoiselle, your family died in a car accident when you were young. I'msorry. I know your grandfather loved you very much. He mentioned to me severaltimes how much it pained him that you two had fallen out of touch.\"Sophie was uncertain how to respond.Langdon asked, \"Do the contents of this account have anything to do with theSangreal?\"Vernet gave him an odd look. \"I have no idea what that is.\" Just then, Vernet'scell phone rang, and he snatched it off his belt. \"Oui?\" He listened a moment,his expression one of surprise and growing concern. \"La police? Si rapidement?\"He cursed, gave some quick directions in French, and said he would be up to thelobby in a minute.Hanging up the phone, he turned back to Sophie. \"The police have responded farmore quickly than usual. They are arriving as we speak.\"Sophie had no intention of leaving empty-handed. \"Tell them we came and wentalready. If they want to search the bank, demand a search warrant. That willtake them time.\"\"Listen,\" Vernet said, \"Jacques was a friend, and my bank does not need thiskind of press, so for those two reasons, I have no intention of allowing thisarrest to be made on my premises. Give me a minute and I will see what I can doto help you leave the bank undetected. Beyond that, I cannot get involved.\" Hestood up and hurried for the door. \"Stay here. I'll make arrangements and beright back.\"\"But the safe-deposit box,\" Sophie declared. \"We can't just leave.\"\"There's nothing I can do,\" Vernet said, hurrying out the door. \"I'm sorry.\"Sophie stared after him a moment, wondering if maybe the account number wasburied in one of the countless letters and packages her grandfather had sent herover the years and which she had left unopened.Langdon stood suddenly, and Sophie sensed an unexpected glimmer of contentmentin his eyes.\"Robert? You're smiling.\"\"Your grandfather was a genius.\"\"I'm sorry?\"\"Ten digits?\"Sophie had no idea what he was talking about.\"The account number,\" he said, a familiar lopsided grin now craning his face.\"I'm pretty sure he left it for us after all.\"\"Where?\"Langdon produced the printout of the crime scene photo and spread it out on thecoffee table. Sophie needed only to read the first line to know Langdon wascorrect. 13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5O, Draconian devil!Oh, lame saint!P.S. Find Robert Langdon CHAPTER 44\"Ten digits,\" Sophie said, her cryptologic senses tingling as she studied theprintout.13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5Grand-père wrote his account number on the Louvre floor!When Sophie had first seen the scrambled Fibonacci sequence on the parquet, shehad assumed its sole purpose was to encourage DCPJ to call in theircryptographers and get Sophie involved. Later, she realized the numbers werealso a clue as to how to decipher the other lines—a sequence out of order... anumeric anagram. Now, utterly amazed, she saw the numbers had a more importantmeaning still. They were almost certainly the final key to opening hergrandfather's mysterious safe-deposit box.\"He was the master of double-entendres,\" Sophie said, turning to Langdon. \"Heloved anything with multiple layers of meaning. Codes within codes.\"Langdon was already moving toward the electronic podium near the conveyor belt.Sophie grabbed the computer printout and followed.The podium had a keypad similar to that of a bank ATM terminal. The screendisplayed the bank's cruciform logo. Beside the keypad was a triangular hole.Sophie wasted no time inserting the shaft of her key into the hole.The screen refreshed instantly. ACCOUNT NUMBER: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ The cursor blinked. Waiting.Ten digits. Sophie read the numbers off the printout, and Langdon typed them in. ACCOUNT NUMBER: 1332211185 When he had typed the last digit, the screen refreshed again. A message inseveral languages appeared. English was on top. CAUTION:Before you strike the enter key, please check the accuracy of your accountnumber.For your own security, if the computer does not recognize your account number,this system will automatically shut down. \"Fonction terminer,\" Sophie said, frowning. \"Looks like we only get one try.\"Standard ATM machines allowed users three attempts to type a PIN beforeconfiscating their bank card. This was obviously no ordinary cash machine.\"The number looks right,\" Langdon confirmed, carefully checking what they hadtyped and comparing it to the printout. He motioned to the ENTER key. \"Fireaway.\"Sophie extended her index finger toward the keypad, but hesitated, an oddthought now hitting her.\"Go ahead,\" Langdon urged. \"Vernet will be back soon.\"\"No.\" She pulled her hand away. \"This isn't the right account number.\"\"Of course it is! Ten digits. What else would it be?\"\"It's too random.\"Too random? Langdon could not have disagreed more. Every bank advised itscustomers to choose PINs at random so nobody could guess them. Certainly clientshere would be advised to choose their account numbers at random.Sophie deleted everything she had just typed in and looked up at Langdon, hergaze self-assured. \"It's far too coincidental that this supposedly randomaccount number could be rearranged to form the Fibonacci sequence.\"Langdon realized she had a point. Earlier, Sophie had rearranged this accountnumber into the Fibonacci sequence. What were the odds of being able to do that?Sophie was at the keypad again, entering a different number, as if from memory.\"Moreover, with my grandfather's love of symbolism and codes, it seems to followthat he would have chosen an account number that had meaning to him, somethinghe could easily remember.\" She finished typing the entry and gave a sly smile.\"Something that appeared random... but was not.\" Langdon looked at the screen. ACCOUNT NUMBER: 1123581321 It took him an instant, but when Langdon spotted it, he knew she was right.The Fibonacci sequence.1-1-2-3-5-8-13-21When the Fibonacci sequence was melded into a single ten-digit number, it becamevirtually unrecognizable. Easy to remember, and yet seemingly random. Abrilliant ten-digit code that Saunière would never forget. Furthermore, itperfectly explained why the scrambled numbers on the Louvre floor could berearranged to form the famous progression.Sophie reached down and pressed the ENTER key.Nothing happened.At least nothing they could detect. At that moment, beneath them, in the bank's cavernous subterranean vault, arobotic claw sprang to life. Sliding on a double-axis transport system attachedto the ceiling, the claw headed off in search of the proper coordinates. On thecement floor below, hundreds of identical plastic crates lay aligned on anenormous grid... like rows of small coffins in an underground crypt.Whirring to a stop over the correct spot on the floor, the claw dropped down, anelectric eye confirming the bar code on the box. Then, with computer precision,the claw grasped the heavy handle and hoisted the crate vertically. New gearsengaged, and the claw transported the box to the far side of the vault, comingto a stop over a stationary conveyor belt.Gently now, the retrieval arm set down the crate and retracted.Once the arm was clear, the conveyor belt whirred to life.... Upstairs, Sophie and Langdon exhaled in relief to see the conveyor belt move.Standing beside the belt, they felt like weary travelers at baggage claimawaiting a mysterious piece of luggage whose contents were unknown.The conveyor belt entered the room on their right through a narrow slit beneatha retractable door. The metal door slid up, and a huge plastic box appeared,emerging from the depths on the inclined conveyor belt. The box was black, heavymolded plastic, and far larger than she imagined. It looked like an air-freightpet transport crate without any airholes.The box coasted to a stop directly in front of them.Langdon and Sophie stood there, silent, staring at the mysterious container.Like everything else about this bank, this crate was industrial—metal clasps, abar code sticker on top, and molded heavy-duty handle. Sophie thought it lookedlike a giant toolbox.Wasting no time, Sophie unhooked the two buckles facing her. Then she glancedover at Langdon. Together, they raised the heavy lid and let it fall back.Stepping forward, they peered down into the crate.At first glance, Sophie thought the crate was empty. Then she saw something.Sitting at the bottom of the crate. A lone item.The polished wooden box was about the size of a shoebox and had ornate hinges.The wood was a lustrous deep purple with a strong grain. Rosewood, Sophierealized. Her grandfather's favorite. The lid bore a beautiful inlaid design ofa rose. She and Langdon exchanged puzzled looks. Sophie leaned in and grabbedthe box, lifting it out.My God, it's heavy!She carried it gingerly to a large receiving table and set it down. Langdonstood beside her, both of them staring at the small treasure chest hergrandfather apparently had sent them to retrieve.Langdon stared in wonderment at the lid's hand-carved inlay—a five-petal rose.He had seen this type of rose many times. \"The five-petal rose,\" he whispered,\"is a Priory symbol for the Holy Grail.\"Sophie turned and looked at him. Langdon could see what she was thinking, and hewas thinking it too. The dimensions of the box, the apparent weight of itscontents, and a Priory symbol for the Grail all seemed to imply one unfathomableconclusion. The Cup of Christ is in this wooden box. Langdon again told himselfit was impossible.\"It's a perfect size,\" Sophie whispered, \"to hold... a chalice.\"It can't be a chalice.Sophie pulled the box toward her across the table, preparing to open it. As shemoved it, though, something unexpected happened. The box let out an odd gurglingsound.Langdon did a double take. There's liquid inside?Sophie looked equally confused. \"Did you just hear...?\"Langdon nodded, lost. \"Liquid.\"Reaching forward, Sophie slowly unhooked the clasp and raised the lid.The object inside was unlike anything Langdon had ever seen. One thing wasimmediately clear to both of them, however. This was definitely not the Cup ofChrist. CHAPTER 45\"The police are blocking the street,\" André Vernet said, walking into thewaiting room. \"Getting you out will be difficult.\" As he closed the door behindhim, Vernet saw the heavy-duty plastic case on the conveyor belt and halted inhis tracks. My God! They accessed Saunière's account?Sophie and Langdon were at the table, huddling over what looked to be a largewooden jewelry box. Sophie immediately closed the lid and looked up. \"We had theaccount number after all,\" she said.Vernet was speechless. This changed everything. He respectfully diverted hiseyes from the box and tried to figure out his next move. I have to get them outof the bank! But with the police already having set up a roadblock, Vernet couldimagine only one way to do that. \"Mademoiselle Neveu, if I can get you safelyout of the bank, will you be taking the item with you or returning it to thevault before you leave?\"Sophie glanced at Langdon and then back to Vernet. \"We need to take it.\"Vernet nodded. \"Very well. Then whatever the item is, I suggest you wrap it inyour jacket as we move through the hallways. I would prefer nobody else see it.\"As Langdon shed his jacket, Vernet hurried over to the conveyor belt, closed thenow empty crate, and typed a series of simple commands. The conveyor belt beganmoving again, carrying the plastic container back down to the vault. Pulling thegold key from the podium, he handed it to Sophie.\"This way please. Hurry.\"When they reached the rear loading dock, Vernet could see the flash of policelights filtering through the underground garage. He frowned. They were probablyblocking the ramp. Am I really going to try to pull this off? He was sweatingnow.Vernet motioned to one of the bank's small armored trucks. Transport sûr wasanother service offered by the Depository Bank of Zurich.\"Get in the cargo hold,\" he said, heaving open the massive rear door andmotioning to the glistening steel compartment. \"I'll be right back.\"As Sophie and Langdon climbed in, Vernet hurried across the loading dock to thedock overseer's office, let himself in, collected the keys for the truck, andfound a driver's uniform jacket and cap. Shedding his own suit coat and tie, hebegan to put on the driver's jacket. Reconsidering, he donned a shoulder holsterbeneath the uniform. On his way out, he grabbed a driver's pistol from the rack,put in a clip, and stuffed it in the holster, buttoning his uniform over it.Returning to the truck, Vernet pulled the driver's cap down low and peered in atSophie and Langdon, who were standing inside the empty steel box.\"You'll want this on,\" Vernet said, reaching inside and flicking a wall switchto illuminate the lone courtesy bulb on the hold's ceiling. \"And you'd bettersit down. Not a sound on our way out the gate.\"Sophie and Langdon sat down on the metal floor. Langdon cradled the treasurewadded in his tweed jacket. Swinging the heavy doors closed, Vernet locked theminside. Then he got in behind the wheel and revved the engine.As the armored truck lumbered toward the top of the ramp, Vernet could feel thesweat already collecting beneath his driver's cap. He could see there were farmore police lights in front than he had imagined. As the truck powered up theramp, the interior gate swung inward to let him pass. Vernet advanced and waitedwhile the gate behind him closed before pulling forward and tripping the nextsensor. The second gate opened, and the exit beckoned.Except for the police car blocking the top of the ramp.Vernet dabbed his brow and pulled forward.A lanky officer stepped out and waved him to a stop a few meters from theroadblock. Four patrol cars were parked out front.Vernet stopped. Pulling his driver's cap down farther, he effected as rough afacade as his cultured upbringing would allow. Not budging from behind thewheel, he opened the door and gazed down at the agent, whose face was stern andsallow.\"Qu'est-ce qui se passe?\" Vernet asked, his tone rough.\"Je suis Jérome Collet,\" the agent said. \"Lieutenant Police Judiciaire.\" Hemotioned to the truck's cargo hold. \"Qu'est-ce qu'ily a là dedans?\"\"Hell if I know,\" Vernet replied in crude French. \"I'm only a driver.\"Collet looked unimpressed. \"We're looking for two criminals.\"Vernet laughed. \"Then you came to the right spot. Some of these bastards I drivefor have so much money they must be criminals.\"The agent held up a passport picture of Robert Langdon. \"Was this man in yourbank tonight?\"Vernet shrugged. \"No clue. I'm a dock rat. They don't let us anywhere near theclients. You need to go in and ask the front desk.\"\"Your bank is demanding a search warrant before we can enter.\"Vernet put on a disgusted look. \"Administrators. Don't get me started.\"\"Open your truck, please.\" Collet motioned toward the cargo hold.Vernet stared at the agent and forced an obnoxious laugh. \"Open the truck? Youthink I have keys? You think they trust us? You should see the crap wages I getpaid.\"The agent's head tilted to one side, his skepticism evident. \"You're telling meyou don't have keys to your own truck?\"Vernet shook his head. \"Not the cargo area. Ignition only. These trucks getsealed by overseers on the loading dock. Then the truck sits in dock whilesomeone drives the cargo keys to the drop-off. Once we get the call that thecargo keys are with the recipient, then I get the okay to drive. Not a secondbefore. I never know what the hell I'm lugging.\"\"When was this truck sealed?\"\"Must have been hours ago. I'm driving all the way up to St. Thurial tonight.Cargo keys are already up there.\"The agent made no response, his eyes probing as if trying to read Vernet's mind.A drop of sweat was preparing to slide down Vernet's nose. \"You mind?\" he said,wiping his nose with his sleeve and motioning to the police car blocking hisway. \"I'm on a tight schedule.\"\"Do all the drivers wear Rolexes?\" the agent asked, pointing to Vernet's wrist.Vernet glanced down and saw the glistening band of his absurdly expensive watchpeeking out from beneath the sleeve of his jacket. Merde. \"This piece of shit?Bought it for twenty euro from a Taiwanese street vendor in St. Germain desPrés. I'll sell it to you for forty.\"The agent paused and finally stepped aside. \"No thanks. Have a safe trip.\"Vernet did not breathe again until the truck was a good fifty meters down thestreet. And now he had another problem. His cargo. Where do I take them? CHAPTER 46Silas lay prone on the canvas mat in his room, allowing the lash wounds on hisback to clot in the air. Tonight's second session with the Discipline had lefthim dizzy and weak. He had yet to remove the cilice belt, and he could feel theblood trickling down his inner thigh. Still, he could not justify removing thestrap.I have failed the Church.Far worse, I have failed the bishop.Tonight was supposed to be Bishop Aringarosa's salvation. Five months ago, thebishop had returned from a meeting at the Vatican Observatory, where he hadlearned something that left him deeply changed. Depressed for weeks, Aringarosahad finally shared the news with Silas.\"But this is impossible!\" Silas had cried out. \"I cannot accept it!\"\"It is true,\" Aringarosa said. \"Unthinkable, but true. In only six months.\"The bishop's words terrified Silas. He prayed for deliverance, and even in thosedark days, his trust in God and The Way never wavered. It was only a month laterthat the clouds parted miraculously and the light of possibility shone through.Divine intervention, Aringarosa had called it.The bishop had seemed hopeful for the first time. \"Silas,\" he whispered, \"Godhas bestowed upon us an opportunity to protect The Way. Our battle, like allbattles, will take sacrifice. Will you be a soldier of God?\"Silas fell to his knees before Bishop Aringarosa—the man who had given him a newlife—and he said, \"I am a lamb of God. Shepherd me as your heart commands.\"When Aringarosa described the opportunity that had presented itself, Silas knewit could only be the hand of God at work. Miraculous fate! Aringarosa put Silasin contact with the man who had proposed the plan—a man who called himself theTeacher. Although the Teacher and Silas never met face-to-face, each time theyspoke by phone, Silas was awed, both by the profundity of the Teacher's faithand by the scope of his power. The Teacher seemed to be a man who knew all, aman with eyes and ears in all places. How the Teacher gathered his information,Silas did not know, but Aringarosa had placed enormous trust in the Teacher, andhe had told Silas to do the same. \"Do as the Teacher commands you,\" the bishoptold Silas. \"And we will be victorious.\"Victorious. Silas now gazed at the bare floor and feared victory had eludedthem. The Teacher had been tricked. The keystone was a devious dead end. Andwith the deception, all hope had vanished.Silas wished he could call Bishop Aringarosa and warn him, but the Teacher hadremoved all their lines of direct communication tonight. For our safety.Finally, overcoming enormous trepidation, Silas crawled to his feet and foundhis robe, which lay on the floor. He dug his cell phone from the pocket. Hanginghis head in shame, he dialed.\"Teacher,\" he whispered, \"all is lost.\" Silas truthfully told the man how he hadbeen tricked.\"You lose your faith too quickly,\" the Teacher replied. \"I have just receivednews. Most unexpected and welcome. The secret lives. Jacques Saunièretransferred information before he died. I will call you soon. Our work tonightis not yet done.\" CHAPTER 47Riding inside the dimly lit cargo hold of the armored truck was like beingtransported inside a cell for solitary confinement. Langdon fought the all toofamiliar anxiety that haunted him in confined spaces. Vernet said he would takeus a safe distance out of the city. Where? How far?Langdon's legs had gotten stiff from sitting cross-legged on the metal floor,and he shifted his position, wincing to feel the blood pouring back into hislower body. In his arms, he still clutched the bizarre treasure they hadextricated from the bank.\"I think we're on the highway now,\" Sophie whispered.Langdon sensed the same thing. The truck, after an unnerving pause atop the bankramp, had moved on, snaking left and right for a minute or two, and was nowaccelerating to what felt like top speed. Beneath them, the bulletproof tireshummed on smooth pavement. Forcing his attention to the rosewood box in hisarms, Langdon laid the precious bundle on the floor, unwrapped his jacket, andextracted the box, pulling it toward him. Sophie shifted her position so theywere sitting side by side. Langdon suddenly felt like they were two kids huddledover a Christmas present.In contrast to the warm colors of the rosewood box, the inlaid rose had beencrafted of a pale wood, probably ash, which shone clearly in the dim light. TheRose. Entire armies and religions had been built on this symbol, as had secretsocieties. The Rosicrucians. The Knights of the Rosy Cross.\"Go ahead,\" Sophie said. \"Open it.\"Langdon took a deep breath. Reaching for the lid, he stole one more admiringglance at the intricate woodwork and then, unhooking the clasp, he opened thelid, revealing the object within.Langdon had harbored several fantasies about what they might find inside thisbox, but clearly he had been wrong on every account. Nestled snugly inside thebox's heavily padded interior of crimson silk lay an object Langdon could noteven begin to comprehend.Crafted of polished white marble, it was a stone cylinder approximately thedimensions of a tennis ball can. More complicated than a simple column of stone,however, the cylinder appeared to have been assembled in many pieces. Sixdoughnut-sized disks of marble had been stacked and affixed to one anotherwithin a delicate brass framework. It looked like some kind of tubular,multiwheeled kaleidoscope. Each end of the cylinder was affixed with an end cap,also marble, making it impossible to see inside. Having heard liquid within,Langdon assumed the cylinder was hollow.As mystifying as the construction of the cylinder was, however, it was theengravings around the tube's circumference that drew Langdon's primary focus.Each of the six disks had been carefully carved with the same unlikely series ofletters—the entire alphabet. The lettered cylinder reminded Langdon of one ofhis childhood toys—a rod threaded with lettered tumblers that could be rotatedto spell different words.\"Amazing, isn't it?\" Sophie whispered.Langdon glanced up. \"I don't know. What the hell is it?\"Now there was a glint in Sophie's eye. \"My grandfather used to craft these as ahobby. They were invented by Leonardo da Vinci.\"Even in the diffuse light, Sophie could see Langdon's surprise.\"Da Vinci?\" he muttered, looking again at the canister.\"Yes. It's called a cryptex. According to my grandfather, the blueprints comefrom one of Da Vinci's secret diaries.\"\"What is it for?\"Considering tonight's events, Sophie knew the answer might have some interestingimplications. \"It's a vault,\" she said. \"For storing secret information.\"Langdon's eyes widened further.Sophie explained that creating models of Da Vinci's inventions was one of hergrandfather's best-loved hobbies. A talented craftsman who spent hours in hiswood and metal shop, Jacques Saunière enjoyed imitating mastercraftsmen—Fabergé, assorted cloisonne artisans, and the less artistic, but farmore practical, Leonardo da Vinci.Even a cursory glance through Da Vinci's journals revealed why the luminary wasas notorious for his lack of follow-through as he was famous for his brilliance.Da Vinci had drawn up blueprints for hundreds of inventions he had never built.One of Jacques Saunière's favorite pastimes was bringing Da Vinci's more obscurebrainstorms to life—timepieces, water pumps, cryptexes, and even a fullyarticulated model of a medieval French knight, which now stood proudly on thedesk in his office. Designed by Da Vinci in 1495 as an outgrowth of his earliestanatomy and kinesiology studies, the internal mechanism of the robot knightpossessed accurate joints and tendons, and was designed to sit up, wave itsarms, and move its head via a flexible neck while opening and closing ananatomically correct jaw. This armor-clad knight, Sophie had always believed,was the most beautiful object her grandfather had ever built... that was, untilshe had seen the cryptex in this rosewood box.\"He made me one of these when I was little,\" Sophie said. \"But I've never seenone so ornate and large.\"Langdon's eyes had never left the box. \"I've never heard of a cryptex.\"Sophie was not surprised. Most of Leonardo's unbuilt inventions had never beenstudied or even named. The term cryptex possibly had been her grandfather'screation, an apt title for this device that used the science of cryptology toprotect information written on the contained scroll or codex.Da Vinci had been a cryptology pioneer, Sophie knew, although he was seldomgiven credit. Sophie's university instructors, while presenting computerencryption methods for securing data, praised modern cryptologists likeZimmerman and Schneier but failed to mention that it was Leonardo who hadinvented one of the first rudimentary forms of public key encryption centuriesago. Sophie's grandfather, of course, had been the one to tell her all aboutthat.As their armored truck roared down the highway, Sophie explained to Langdon thatthe cryptex had been Da Vinci's solution to the dilemma of sending securemessages over long distances. In an era without telephones or e-mail, anyonewanting to convey private information to someone far away had no option but towrite it down and then trust a messenger to carry the letter. Unfortunately, ifa messenger suspected the letter might contain valuable information, he couldmake far more money selling the information to adversaries than he coulddelivering the letter properly.Many great minds in history had invented cryptologic solutions to the challengeof data protection: Julius Caesar devised a code-writing scheme called theCaesar Box; Mary, Queen of Scots created a transposition cipher and sent secretcommuniqués from prison; and the brilliant Arab scientist Abu Yusuf Ismailal-Kindi protected his secrets with an ingeniously conceived polyalphabeticsubstitution cipher.Da Vinci, however, eschewed mathematics and cryptology for a mechanicalsolution. The cryptex. A portable container that could safeguard letters, maps,diagrams, anything at all. Once information was sealed inside the cryptex, onlythe individual with the proper password could access it.\"We require a password,\" Sophie said, pointing out the lettered dials. \"Acryptex works much like a bicycle's combination lock. If you align the dials inthe proper position, the lock slides open. This cryptex has five lettered dials.When you rotate them to their proper sequence, the tumblers inside align, andthe entire cylinder slides apart.\"\"And inside?\"\"Once the cylinder slides apart, you have access to a hollow centralcompartment, which can hold a scroll of paper on which is the information youwant to keep private.\"Langdon looked incredulous. \"And you say your grandfather built these for youwhen you were younger?\"\"Some smaller ones, yes. A couple times for my birthday, he gave me a cryptexand told me a riddle. The answer to the riddle was the password to the cryptex,and once I figured it out, I could open it up and find my birthday card.\"\"A lot of work for a card.\"\"No, the cards always contained another riddle or clue. My grandfather lovedcreating elaborate treasure hunts around our house, a string of clues thateventually led to my real gift. Each treasure hunt was a test of character andmerit, to ensure I earned my rewards. And the tests were never simple.\"Langdon eyed the device again, still looking skeptical. \"But why not just pry itapart? Or smash it? The metal looks delicate, and marble is a soft rock.\"Sophie smiled. \"Because Da Vinci is too smart for that. He designed the cryptexso that if you try to force it open in any way, the information self-destructs.Watch.\" Sophie reached into the box and carefully lifted out the cylinder. \"Anyinformation to be inserted is first written on a papyrus scroll.\"\"Not vellum?\"Sophie shook her head. \"Papyrus. I know sheep's vellum was more durable and morecommon in those days, but it had to be papyrus. The thinner the better.\"\"Okay.\"\"Before the papyrus was inserted into the cryptex's compartment, it was rolledaround a delicate glass vial.\" She tipped the cryptex, and the liquid insidegurgled. \"A vial of liquid.\"\"Liquid what?\"Sophie smiled. \"Vinegar.\"Langdon hesitated a moment and then began nodding. \"Brilliant.\"Vinegar and papyrus, Sophie thought. If someone attempted to force open thecryptex, the glass vial would break, and the vinegar would quickly dissolve thepapyrus. By the time anyone extracted the secret message, it would be a glob ofmeaningless pulp.\"As you can see,\" Sophie told him, \"the only way to access the informationinside is to know the proper five-letter password. And with five dials, eachwith twenty-six letters, that's twenty-six to the fifth power.\" She quicklyestimated the permutations. \"Approximately twelve million possibilities.\"\"If you say so,\" Langdon said, looking like he had approximately twelve millionquestions running through his head. \"What information do you think is inside?\"\"Whatever it is, my grandfather obviously wanted very badly to keep it secret.\"She paused, closing the box lid and eyeing the five-petal Rose inlaid on it.Something was bothering her. \"Did you say earlier that the Rose is a symbol forthe Grail?\"\"Exactly. In Priory symbolism, the Rose and the Grail are synonymous.\"Sophie furrowed her brow. \"That's strange, because my grandfather always told methe Rose meant secrecy. He used to hang a rose on his office door at home whenhe was having a confidential phone call and didn't want me to disturb him. Heencouraged me to do the same.\" Sweetie, her grandfather said, rather than lockeach other out, we can each hang a rose—la fleur des secrets—on our door when weneed privacy. This way we learn to respect and trust each other. Hanging a roseis an ancient Roman custom.\"Sub rosa,\" Langdon said. \"The Romans hung a rose over meetings to indicate themeeting was confidential. Attendees understood that whatever was said under therose—or sub rosa—had to remain a secret.\"Langdon quickly explained that the Rose's overtone of secrecy was not the onlyreason the Priory used it as a symbol for the Grail. Rosa rugosa, one of theoldest species of rose, had five petals and pentagonal symmetry, just like theguiding star of Venus, giving the Rose strong iconographic ties to womanhood. Inaddition, the Rose had close ties to the concept of \"true direction\" andnavigating one's way. The Compass Rose helped travelers navigate, as did RoseLines, the longitudinal lines on maps. For this reason, the Rose was a symbolthat spoke of the Grail on many levels—secrecy, womanhood, and guidance—thefeminine chalice and guiding star that led to secret truth.As Langdon finished his explanation, his expression seemed to tighten suddenly.\"Robert? Are you okay?\"His eyes were riveted to the rosewood box. \"Sub... rosa,\" he choked, a fearfulbewilderment sweeping across his face. \"It can't be.\"\"What?\"Langdon slowly raised his eyes. \"Under the sign of the Rose,\" he whispered.\"This cryptex... I think I know what it is.\" CHAPTER 48Langdon could scarcely believe his own supposition, and yet, considering who hadgiven this stone cylinder to them, how he had given it to them, and now, theinlaid Rose on the container, Langdon could formulate only one conclusion.I am holding the Priory keystone.The legend was specific.The keystone is an encoded stone that lies beneath the sign of the Rose.\"Robert?\" Sophie was watching him. \"What's going on?\"Langdon needed a moment to gather his thoughts. \"Did your grandfather ever speakto you of something called la clef de voûte?\"\"The key to the vault?\" Sophie translated.\"No, that's the literal translation. Clef de voûte is a common architecturalterm. Voûte refers not to a bank vault, but to a vault in an archway. Like avaulted ceiling.\"\"But vaulted ceilings don't have keys.\"\"Actually they do. Every stone archway requires a central, wedge-shaped stone atthe top which locks the pieces together and carries all the weight. This stoneis, in an architectural sense, the key to the vault. In English we call it akeystone.\" Langdon watched her eyes for any spark of recognition.Sophie shrugged, glancing down at the cryptex. \"But this obviously is not akeystone.\"Langdon didn't know where to begin. Keystones as a masonry technique forbuilding stone archways had been one of the best-kept secrets of the earlyMasonic brotherhood. The Royal Arch Degree. Architecture. Keystones. It was allinterconnected. The secret knowledge of how to use a wedged keystone to build avaulted archway was part of the wisdom that had made the Masons such wealthycraftsmen, and it was a secret they guarded carefully. Keystones had always hada tradition of secrecy. And yet, the stone cylinder in the rosewood box wasobviously something quite different. The Priory keystone—if this was indeed whatthey were holding—was not at all what Langdon had imagined.\"The Priory keystone is not my specialty,\" Langdon admitted. \"My interest in theHoly Grail is primarily symbologic, so I tend to ignore the plethora of loreregarding how to actually find it.\"Sophie's eyebrows arched. \"Find the Holy Grail?\"Langdon gave an uneasy nod, speaking his next words carefully. \"Sophie,according to Priory lore, the keystone is an encoded map... a map that revealsthe hiding place of the Holy Grail.\"Sophie's face went blank. \"And you think this is it?\"Langdon didn't know what to say. Even to him it sounded unbelievable, and yetthe keystone was the only logical conclusion he could muster. An encryptedstone, hidden beneath the sign of the Rose.The idea that the cryptex had been designed by Leonardo da Vinci—former GrandMaster of the Priory of Sion—shone as another tantalizing indicator that thiswas indeed the Priory keystone. A former Grand Master's blueprint... brought tolife centuries later by another Priory member. The bond was too palpable todismiss.For the last decade, historians had been searching for the keystone in Frenchchurches. Grail seekers, familiar with the Priory's history of crypticdouble-talk, had concluded la clef de voûte was a literal keystone—anarchitectural wedge—an engraved, encrypted stone, inserted into a vaultedarchway in a church. Beneath the sign of the Rose. In architecture, there was noshortage of roses. Rose windows. Rosette reliefs. And, of course, an abundanceof cinquefoils—the five-petaled decorative flowers often found at the top ofarchways, directly over the keystone. The hiding place seemed diabolicallysimple. The map to the Holy Grail was incorporated high in an archway of someforgotten church, mocking the blind churchgoers who wandered beneath it.\"This cryptex can't be the keystone,\" Sophie argued. \"It's not old enough. I'mcertain my grandfather made this. It can't be part of any ancient Grail legend.\"\"Actually,\" Langdon replied, feeling a tingle of excitement ripple through him,\"the keystone is believed to have been created by the Priory sometime in thepast couple of decades.\"Sophie's eyes flashed disbelief. \"But if this cryptex reveals the hiding placeof the Holy Grail, why would my grandfather give it to me? I have no idea how toopen it or what to do with it. I don't even know what the Holy Grail is!\"Langdon realized to his surprise that she was right. He had not yet had a chanceto explain to Sophie the true nature of the Holy Grail. That story would have towait. At the moment, they were focused on the keystone.If that is indeed what this is....Against the hum of the bulletproof wheels beneath them, Langdon quicklyexplained to Sophie everything he had heard about the keystone. Allegedly, forcenturies, the Priory's biggest secret—the location of the Holy Grail—was neverwritten down. For security's sake, it was verbally transferred to each newrising sénéchal at a clandestine ceremony. However, at some point during thelast century, whisperings began to surface that the Priory policy had changed.Perhaps it was on account of new electronic eavesdropping capabilities, but thePriory vowed never again even to speak the location of the sacred hiding place.\"But then how could they pass on the secret?\" Sophie asked.\"That's where the keystone comes in,\" Langdon explained. \"When one of the topfour members died, the remaining three would choose from the lower echelons thenext candidate to ascend as sénéchal. Rather than telling the new sénéchal wherethe Grail was hidden, they gave him a test through which he could prove he wasworthy.\"Sophie looked unsettled by this, and Langdon suddenly recalled her mentioninghow her grandfather used to make treasure hunts for her—preuves de mérite.Admittedly, the keystone was a similar concept. Then again, tests like this wereextremely common in secret societies. The best known was the Masons', whereinmembers ascended to higher degrees by proving they could keep a secret and byperforming rituals and various tests of merit over many years. The tasks becameprogressively harder until they culminated in a successful candidate's inductionas thirty-second-degree Mason.\"So the keystone is a preuve de mérite,\" Sophie said. \"If a rising Priorysénéchal can open it, he proves himself worthy of the information it holds.\"Langdon nodded. \"I forgot you'd had experience with this sort of thing.\"\"Not only with my grandfather. In cryptology, that's called a 'self-authorizinglanguage.' That is, if you're smart enough to read it, you're permitted to knowwhat is being said.\"Langdon hesitated a moment. \"Sophie, you realize that if this is indeed thekeystone, your grandfather's access to it implies he was exceptionally powerfulwithin the Priory of Sion. He would have to have been one of the highest fourmembers.\"Sophie sighed. \"He was powerful in a secret society. I'm certain of it. I canonly assume it was the Priory.\"Langdon did a double take. \"You knew he was in a secret society?\"\"I saw some things I wasn't supposed to see ten years ago. We haven't spokensince.\" She paused. \"My grandfather was not only a ranking top member of thegroup... I believe he was the top member.\"Langdon could not believe what she had just said. \"Grand Master? But... there'sno way you could know that!\"\"I'd rather not talk about it.\" Sophie looked away, her expression as determinedas it was pained.Langdon sat in stunned silence. Jacques Saunière? Grand Master? Despite theastonishing repercussions if it were true, Langdon had the eerie sensation italmost made perfect sense. After all, previous Priory Grand Masters had alsobeen distinguished public figures with artistic souls. Proof of that fact hadbeen uncovered years ago in Paris's Bibliothèque Nationale in papers that becameknown as Les Dossiers Secrets.Every Priory historian and Grail buff had read the Dossiers. Cataloged underNumber 4° lm1 249, the Dossiers Secrets had been authenticated by manyspecialists and incontrovertibly confirmed what historians had suspected for along time: Priory Grand Masters included Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, SirIsaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and, more recently, Jean Cocteau, the famous Parisianartist.Why not Jacques Saunière?Langdon's incredulity intensified with the realization that he had been slatedto meet Saunière tonight. The Priory Grand Master called a meeting with me. Why?To make artistic small talk? It suddenly seemed unlikely. After all, ifLangdon's instincts were correct, the Grand Master of the Priory of Sion hadjust transferred the brotherhood's legendary keystone to his granddaughter andsimultaneously commanded her to find Robert Langdon.Inconceivable!Langdon's imagination could conjure no set of circumstances that would explainSaunière's behavior. Even if Saunière feared his own death, there were threesénéchaux who also possessed the secret and therefore guaranteed the Priory'ssecurity. Why would Saunière take such an enormous risk giving his granddaughterthe keystone, especially when the two of them didn't get along? And why involveLangdon... a total stranger?A piece of this puzzle is missing, Langdon thought.The answers were apparently going to have to wait. The sound of the slowingengine caused them both to look up. Gravel crunched beneath the tires. Why is hepulling over already? Langdon wondered. Vernet had told them he would take themwell outside the city to safety. The truck decelerated to a crawl and made itsway over unexpectedly rough terrain. Sophie shot Langdon an uneasy look, hastilyclosing the cryptex box and latching it. Langdon slipped his jacket back on.When the truck came to a stop, the engine remained idling as the locks on therear doors began to turn. When the doors swung open, Langdon was surprised tosee they were parked in a wooded area, well off the road. Vernet stepped intoview, a strained look in his eye. In his hand, he held a pistol.\"I'm sorry about this,\" he said. \"I really have no choice.\" CHAPTER 49André Vernet looked awkward with a pistol, but his eyes shone with adetermination that Langdon sensed would be unwise to test.\"I'm afraid I must insist,\" Vernet said, training the weapon on the two of themin the back of the idling truck. \"Set the box down.\"Sophie clutched the box to her chest. \"You said you and my grandfather werefriends.\"\"I have a duty to protect your grandfather's assets,\" Vernet replied. \"And thatis exactly what I am doing. Now set the box on the floor.\"\"My grandfather entrusted this to me!\" Sophie declared.\"Do it,\" Vernet commanded, raising the gun.Sophie set the box at her feet.Langdon watched the gun barrel swing now in his direction.\"Mr. Langdon,\" Vernet said, \"you will bring the box over to me. And be awarethat I'm asking you because you I would not hesitate to shoot.\"Langdon stared at the banker in disbelief. \"Why are you doing this?\"\"Why do you imagine?\" Vernet snapped, his accented English terse now. \"Toprotect my client's assets.\"\"We are your clients now,\" Sophie said.Vernet's visage turned ice-cold, an eerie transformation. \"Mademoiselle Neveu, Idon't know how you got that key and account number tonight, but it seems obviousthat foul play was involved. Had I known the extent of your crimes, I wouldnever have helped you leave the bank.\"\"I told you,\" Sophie said, \"we had nothing to do with my grandfather's death!\"Vernet looked at Langdon. \"And yet the radio claims you are wanted not only forthe murder of Jacques Saunière but for those of three other men as well?\"\"What!\" Langdon was thunderstruck. Three more murders? The coincidental numberhit him harder than the fact that he was the prime suspect. It seemed toounlikely to be a coincidence. The three sénéchaux? Langdon's eyes dropped to therosewood box. If the sénéchaux were murdered, Saunière had no options. He had totransfer the keystone to someone.\"The police can sort that out when I turn you in,\" Vernet said. \"I have gottenmy bank involved too far already.\"Sophie glared at Vernet. \"You obviously have no intention of turning us in. Youwould have driven us back to the bank. And instead you bring us out here andhold us at gunpoint?\"\"Your grandfather hired me for one reason—to keep his possessions both safe andprivate. Whatever this box contains, I have no intention of letting it become apiece of cataloged evidence in a police investigation. Mr. Langdon, bring me thebox.\"Sophie shook her head. \"Don't do it.\"A gunshot roared, and a bullet tore into the wall above him. The reverberationshook the back of the truck as a spent shell clinked onto the cargo floor.Shit! Langdon froze.Vernet spoke more confidently now. \"Mr. Langdon, pick up the box.\"Langdon lifted the box.\"Now bring it over to me.\" Vernet was taking dead aim, standing on the groundbehind the rear bumper, his gun outstretched into the cargo hold now.Box in hand, Langdon moved across the hold toward the open door.I've got to do something! Langdon thought. I'm about to hand over the Priorykeystone! As Langdon moved toward the doorway, his position of higher groundbecame more pronounced, and he began wondering if he could somehow use it to hisadvantage. Vernet's gun, though raised, was at Langdon's knee level. Awell-placed kick perhaps? Unfortunately, as Langdon neared, Vernet seemed tosense the dangerous dynamic developing, and he took several steps back,repositioning himself six feet away. Well out of reach.Vernet commanded, \"Place the box beside the door.\"Seeing no options, Langdon knelt down and set the rosewood box at the edge ofthe cargo hold, directly in front of the open doors.\"Now stand up.\"Langdon began to stand up but paused, spying the small, spent pistol shell onthe floor beside the truck's precision-crafted doorsill.\"Stand up, and step away from the box.\"Langdon paused a moment longer, eyeing the metal threshold. Then he stood. As hedid, he discreetly brushed the shell over the edge onto the narrow ledge thatwas the door's lower sill. Fully upright now, Langdon stepped backward.\"Return to the back wall and turn around.\"Langdon obeyed. Vernet could feel his own heart pounding. Aiming the gun with his right hand, hereached now with his left for the wooden box. He discovered that it was far tooheavy. I need two hands. Turning his eyes back to his captives, he calculatedthe risk. Both were a good fifteen feet away, at the far end of the cargo hold,facing away from him. Vernet made up his mind. Quickly, he laid down the gun onthe bumper, lifted the box with two hands, and set it on the ground, immediatelygrabbing the gun again and aiming it back into the hold. Neither of hisprisoners had moved.Perfect. Now all that remained was to close and lock the door. Leaving the boxon the ground for the moment, he grabbed the metal door and began to heave itclosed. As the door swung past him, Vernet reached up to grab the single boltthat needed to be slid into place. The door closed with a thud, and Vernetquickly grabbed the bolt, pulling it to the left. The bolt slid a few inches andcrunched to an unexpected halt, not lining up with its sleeve. What's going on?Vernet pulled again, but the bolt wouldn't lock. The mechanism was not properlyaligned. The door isn't fully closed! Feeling a surge of panic, Vernet shovedhard against the outside of the door, but it refused to budge. Something isblocking it! Vernet turned to throw full shoulder into the door, but this timethe door exploded outward, striking Vernet in the face and sending him reelingbackward onto the ground, his nose shattering in pain. The gun flew as Vernetreached for his face and felt the warm blood running from his nose.Robert Langdon hit the ground somewhere nearby, and Vernet tried to get up, buthe couldn't see. His vision blurred and he fell backward again. Sophie Neveu wasshouting. Moments later, Vernet felt a cloud of dirt and exhaust billowing overhim. He heard the crunching of tires on gravel and sat up just in time to seethe truck's wide wheelbase fail to navigate a turn. There was a crash as thefront bumper clipped a tree. The engine roared, and the tree bent. Finally, itwas the bumper that gave, tearing half off. The armored car lurched away, itsfront bumper dragging. When the truck reached the paved access road, a shower ofsparks lit up the night, trailing the truck as it sped away.Vernet turned his eyes back to the ground where the truck had been parked. Evenin the faint moonlight he could see there was nothing there.The wooden box was gone."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 50The unmarked Fiat sedan departing Castel Gandolfo snaked downward through theAlban Hills into the valley below. In the back seat, Bishop Aringarosa smiled,feeling the weight of the bearer bonds in the briefcase on his lap and wonderinghow long it would be before he and the Teacher could make the exchange.Twenty million euro.The sum would buy Aringarosa power far more valuable than that.As his car sped back toward Rome, Aringarosa again found himself wondering whythe Teacher had not yet contacted him. Pulling his cell phone from his cassockpocket, he checked the carrier signal. Extremely faint.\"Cell service is intermittent up here,\" the driver said, glancing at him in therearview mirror. \"In about five minutes, we'll be out of the mountains, andservice improves.\"\"Thank you.\" Aringarosa felt a sudden surge of concern. No service in themountains? Maybe the Teacher had been trying to reach him all this time. Maybesomething had gone terribly wrong.Quickly, Aringarosa checked the phone's voice mail. Nothing. Then again, herealized, the Teacher never would have left a recorded message; he was a man whotook enormous care with his communications. Nobody understood better than theTeacher the perils of speaking openly in this modern world. Electroniceavesdropping had played a major role in how he had gathered his astonishingarray of secret knowledge.For this reason, he takes extra precautions.Unfortunately, the Teacher's protocols for caution included a refusal to giveAringarosa any kind of contact number. I alone will initiate contact, theTeacher had informed him. So keep your phone close. Now that Aringarosa realizedhis phone might not have been working properly, he feared what the Teacher mightthink if he had been repeatedly phoning with no answer.He'll think something is wrong.Or that I failed to get the bonds.The bishop broke a light sweat.Or worse... that I took the money and ran! CHAPTER 51Even at a modest sixty kilometers an hour, the dangling front bumper of thearmored truck grated against the deserted suburban road with a grinding roar,spraying sparks up onto the hood.We've got to get off the road, Langdon thought.He could barely even see where they were headed. The truck's lone workingheadlight had been knocked off-center and was casting a skewed sidelong beaminto the woods beside the country highway. Apparently the armor in this \"armoredtruck\" referred only to the cargo hold and not the front end.Sophie sat in the passenger seat, staring blankly at the rosewood box on herlap.\"Are you okay?\" Langdon asked.Sophie looked shaken. \"Do you believe him?\"\"About the three additional murders? Absolutely. It answers a lot ofquestions—the issue of your grandfather's desperation to pass on the keystone,as well as the intensity with which Fache is hunting me.\"\"No, I meant about Vernet trying to protect his bank.\"Langdon glanced over. \"As opposed to?\"\"Taking the keystone for himself.\"Langdon had not even considered it. \"How would he even know what this boxcontains?\"\"His bank stored it. He knew my grandfather. Maybe he knew things. He might havedecided he wanted the Grail for himself.\"Langdon shook his head. Vernet hardly seemed the type. \"In my experience, thereare only two reasons people seek the Grail. Either they are naive and believethey are searching for the long-lost Cup of Christ...\"\"Or?\"\"Or they know the truth and are threatened by it. Many groups throughout historyhave sought to destroy the Grail.\"The silence between them accentuated the sound of the scraping bumper. They haddriven a few kilometers now, and as Langdon watched the cascade of sparks comingoff the front of the truck, he wondered if it was dangerous. Either way, if theypassed another car, it would certainly draw attention. Langdon made up his mind.\"I'm going to see if I can bend this bumper back.\"Pulling onto the shoulder, he brought the truck to a stop.Silence at last.As Langdon walked toward the front of the truck, he felt surprisingly alert.Staring into the barrel of yet another gun tonight had given him a second wind.He took a deep breath of nighttime air and tried to get his wits about him.Accompanying the gravity of being a hunted man, Langdon was starting to feel theponderous weight of responsibility, the prospect that he and Sophie mightactually be holding an encrypted set of directions to one of the most enduringmysteries of all time.As if this burden were not great enough, Langdon now realized that anypossibility of finding a way to return the keystone to the Priory had justevaporated. News of the three additional murders had dire implications. ThePriory has been infiltrated. They are compromised. The brotherhood was obviouslybeing watched, or there was a mole within the ranks. It seemed to explain whySaunière might have transferred the keystone to Sophie and Langdon—peopleoutside the brotherhood, people he knew were not compromised. We can't very wellgive the keystone back to the brotherhood. Even if Langdon had any idea how tofind a Priory member, chances were good that whoever stepped forward to take thekeystone could be the enemy himself. For the moment, at least, it seemed thekeystone was in Sophie and Langdon's hands, whether they wanted it or not.The truck's front end looked worse than Langdon had imagined. The left headlightwas gone, and the right one looked like an eyeball dangling from its socket.Langdon straightened it, and it dislodged again. The only good news was that thefront bumper had been torn almost clean off. Langdon gave it a hard kick andsensed he might be able to break it off entirely.As he repeatedly kicked the twisted metal, Langdon recalled his earlierconversation with Sophie. My grandfather left me a phone message, Sophie hadtold him. He said he needed to tell me the truth about my family. At the time ithad meant nothing, but now, knowing the Priory of Sion was involved, Langdonfelt a startling new possibility emerge.The bumper broke off suddenly with a crash. Langdon paused to catch his breath.At least the truck would no longer look like a Fourth of July sparkler. Hegrabbed the bumper and began dragging it out of sight into the woods, wonderingwhere they should go next. They had no idea how to open the cryptex, or whySaunière had given it to them. Unfortunately, their survival tonight seemed todepend on getting answers to those very questions.We need help, Langdon decided. Professional help.In the world of the Holy Grail and the Priory of Sion, that meant only one man.The challenge, of course, would be selling the idea to Sophie. Inside the armored car, while Sophie waited for Langdon to return, she couldfeel the weight of the rosewood box on her lap and resented it. Why did mygrandfather give this to me? She had not the slightest idea what to do with it.Think, Sophie! Use your head. Grand-père is trying to tell you something!Opening the box, she eyed the cryptex's dials. A proof of merit. She could feelher grandfather's hand at work. The keystone is a map that can be followed onlyby the worthy. It sounded like her grandfather to the core.Lifting the cryptex out of the box, Sophie ran her fingers over the dials. Fiveletters. She rotated the dials one by one. The mechanism moved smoothly. Shealigned the disks such that her chosen letters lined up between the cryptex'stwo brass alignment arrows on either end of the cylinder. The dials now spelleda five-letter word that Sophie knew was absurdly obvious.G-R-A-I-L.Gently, she held the two ends of the cylinder and pulled, applying pressureslowly. The cryptex didn't budge. She heard the vinegar inside gurgle andstopped pulling. Then she tried again.V-I-N-C-IAgain, no movement.V-O-U-T-ENothing. The cryptex remained locked solid.Frowning, she replaced it in the rosewood box and closed the lid. Lookingoutside at Langdon, Sophie felt grateful he was with her tonight. P.S. FindRobert Langdon. Her grandfather's rationale for including him was now clear.Sophie was not equipped to understand her grandfather's intentions, and so hehad assigned Robert Langdon as her guide. A tutor to oversee her education.Unfortunately for Langdon, he had turned out to be far more than a tutortonight. He had become the target of Bezu Fache... and some unseen force intenton possessing the Holy Grail.Whatever the Grail turns out to be.Sophie wondered if finding out was worth her life. As the armored truck accelerated again, Langdon was pleased how much moresmoothly it drove. \"Do you know how to get to Versailles?\"Sophie eyed him. \"Sightseeing?\"\"No, I have a plan. There's a religious historian I know who lives nearVersailles. I can't remember exactly where, but we can look it up. I've been tohis estate a few times. His name is Leigh Teabing. He's a former British RoyalHistorian.\"\"And he lives in Paris?\"\"Teabing's life passion is the Grail. When whisperings of the Priory keystonesurfaced about fifteen years ago, he moved to France to search churches in hopesof finding it. He's written some books on the keystone and the Grail. He may beable to help us figure out how to open it and what to do with it.\"Sophie's eyes were wary. \"Can you trust him?\"\"Trust him to what? Not steal the information?\"\"And not to turn us in.\"\"I don't intend to tell him we're wanted by the police. I'm hoping he'll take usin until we can sort all this out.\"\"Robert, has it occurred to you that every television in France is probablygetting ready to broadcast our pictures? Bezu Fache always uses the media to hisadvantage. He'll make it impossible for us to move around without beingrecognized.\"Terrific, Langdon thought. My French TV debut will be on \"Paris's Most Wanted.\"At least Jonas Faukman would be pleased; every time Langdon made the news, hisbook sales jumped.\"Is this man a good enough friend?\" Sophie asked.Langdon doubted Teabing was someone who watched television, especially at thishour, but still the question deserved consideration. Instinct told Langdon thatTeabing would be totally trustworthy. An ideal safe harbor. Considering thecircumstances, Teabing would probably trip over himself to help them as much aspossible. Not only did he owe Langdon a favor, but Teabing was a Grailresearcher, and Sophie claimed her grandfather was the actual Grand Master ofthe Priory of Sion. If Teabing heard that, he would salivate at the thought ofhelping them figure this out.\"Teabing could be a powerful ally,\" Langdon said. Depending on how much you wantto tell him.\"Fache probably will be offering a monetary reward.\"Langdon laughed. \"Believe me, money is the last thing this guy needs.\" LeighTeabing was wealthy in the way small countries were wealthy. A descendant ofBritain's First Duke of Lancaster, Teabing had gotten his money theold-fashioned way—he'd inherited it. His estate outside of Paris was aseventeenth-century palace with two private lakes.Langdon had first met Teabing several years ago through the British BroadcastingCorporation. Teabing had approached the BBC with a proposal for a historicaldocumentary in which he would expose the explosive history of the Holy Grail toa mainstream television audience. The BBC producers loved Teabing's hot premise,his research, and his credentials, but they had concerns that the concept was soshocking and hard to swallow that the network might end up tarnishing itsreputation for quality journalism. At Teabing's suggestion, the BBC solved itscredibility fears by soliciting three cameos from respected historians fromaround the world, all of whom corroborated the stunning nature of the Holy Grailsecret with their own research.Langdon had been among those chosen.The BBC had flown Langdon to Teabing's Paris estate for the filming. He satbefore cameras in Teabing's opulent drawing room and shared his story, admittinghis initial skepticism on hearing of the alternate Holy Grail story, thendescribing how years of research had persuaded him that the story was true.Finally, Langdon offered some of his own research—a series of symbologicconnections that strongly supported the seemingly controversial claims.When the program aired in Britain, despite its ensemble cast and well-documentedevidence, the premise rubbed so hard against the grain of popular Christianthought that it instantly confronted a firestorm of hostility. It never aired inthe States, but the repercussions echoed across the Atlantic. Shortly afterward,Langdon received a postcard from an old friend—the Catholic Bishop ofPhiladelphia. The card simply read: Et tu, Robert?\"Robert,\" Sophie asked, \"you're certain we can trust this man?\"\"Absolutely. We're colleagues, he doesn't need money, and I happen to know hedespises the French authorities. The French government taxes him at absurd ratesbecause he bought a historic landmark. He'll be in no hurry to cooperate withFache.\"Sophie stared out at the dark roadway. \"If we go to him, how much do you want totell him?\"Langdon looked unconcerned. \"Believe me, Leigh Teabing knows more about thePriory of Sion and the Holy Grail than anyone on earth.\"Sophie eyed him. \"More than my grandfather?\"\"I meant more than anyone outside the brotherhood.\"\"How do you know Teabing isn't a member of the brotherhood?\"\"Teabing has spent his life trying to broadcast the truth about the Holy Grail.The Priory's oath is to keep its true nature hidden.\"\"Sounds to me like a conflict of interest.\"Langdon understood her concerns. Saunière had given the cryptex directly toSophie, and although she didn't know what it contained or what she was supposedto do with it, she was hesitant to involve a total stranger. Considering theinformation potentially enclosed, the instinct was probably a good one. \"Wedon't need to tell Teabing about the keystone immediately. Or at all, even. Hishouse will give us a place to hide and think, and maybe when we talk to himabout the Grail, you'll start to have an idea why your grandfather gave this toyou.\"\"Us,\" Sophie reminded.Langdon felt a humble pride and wondered yet again why Saunière had includedhim.\"Do you know more or less where Mr. Teabing lives?\" Sophie asked.\"His estate is called Château Villette.\"Sophie turned with an incredulous look. \"The Château Villette?\"\"That's the one.\"\"Nice friends.\"\"You know the estate?\"\"I've passed it. It's in the castle district. Twenty minutes from here.\"Langdon frowned. \"That far?\"\"Yes, which will give you enough time to tell me what the Holy Grail really is.\"Langdon paused. \"I'll tell you at Teabing's. He and I specialize in differentareas of the legend, so between the two of us, you'll get the full story.\"Langdon smiled. \"Besides, the Grail has been Teabing's life, and hearing thestory of the Holy Grail from Leigh Teabing will be like hearing the theory ofrelativity from Einstein himself.\"\"Let's hope Leigh doesn't mind late-night visitors.\"\"For the record, it's Sir Leigh.\" Langdon had made that mistake only once.\"Teabing is quite a character. He was knighted by the Queen several years backafter composing an extensive history on the House of York.\"Sophie looked over. \"You're kidding, right? We're going to visit a knight?\"Langdon gave an awkward smile. \"We're on a Grail quest, Sophie. Who better tohelp us than a knight?\" CHAPTER 52The Sprawling 185-acre estate of Château Villette was located twenty-fiveminutes northwest of Paris in the environs of Versailles. Designed by FrançoisMansart in 1668 for the Count of Aufflay, it was one of Paris's most significanthistorical châteaux. Complete with two rectangular lakes and gardens designed byLe Nôtre, Château Villette was more of a modest castle than a mansion. Theestate fondly had become known as la Petite Versailles.Langdon brought the armored truck to a shuddering stop at the foot of themile-long driveway. Beyond the imposing security gate, Sir Leigh Teabing'sresidence rose on a meadow in the distance. The sign on the gate was in English:PRIVATE PROPERTY. NO TRESPASSING.As if to proclaim his home a British Isle unto itself, Teabing had not onlyposted his signs in English, but he had installed his gate's intercom entrysystem on the right-hand side of the truck—the passenger's side everywhere inEurope except England.Sophie gave the misplaced intercom an odd look. \"And if someone arrives withouta passenger?\"\"Don't ask.\" Langdon had already been through that with Teabing. \"He prefersthings the way they are at home.\"Sophie rolled down her window. \"Robert, you'd better do the talking.\"Langdon shifted his position, leaning out across Sophie to press the intercombutton. As he did, an alluring whiff of Sophie's perfume filled his nostrils,and he realized how close they were. He waited there, awkwardly prone, while atelephone began ringing over the small speaker.Finally, the intercom crackled and an irritated French accent spoke. \"ChâteauVillette. Who is calling?\"\"This is Robert Langdon,\" Langdon called out, sprawled across Sophie's lap. \"I'ma friend of Sir Leigh Teabing. I need his help.\"\"My master is sleeping. As was I. What is your business with him?\"\"It is a private matter. One of great interest to him.\"\"Then I'm sure he will be pleased to receive you in the morning.\"Langdon shifted his weight. \"It's quite important.\"\"As is Sir Leigh's sleep. If you are a friend, then you are aware he is in poorhealth.\"Sir Leigh Teabing had suffered from polio as a child and now wore leg braces andwalked with crutches, but Langdon had found him such a lively and colorful manon his last visit that it hardly seemed an infirmity. \"If you would, please tellhim I have uncovered new information about the Grail. Information that cannotwait until morning.\"There was a long pause.Langdon and Sophie waited, the truck idling loudly.A full minute passed.Finally, someone spoke. \"My good man, I daresay you are still on HarvardStandard Time.\" The voice was crisp and light.Langdon grinned, recognizing the thick British accent. \"Leigh, my apologies forwaking you at this obscene hour.\"\"My manservant tells me that not only are you in Paris, but you speak of theGrail.\"\"I thought that might get you out of bed.\"\"And so it has.\"\"Any chance you'd open the gate for an old friend?\"\"Those who seek the truth are more than friends. They are brothers.\"Langdon rolled his eyes at Sophie, well accustomed to Teabing's predilection fordramatic antics.\"Indeed I will open the gate,\" Teabing proclaimed, \"but first I must confirmyour heart is true. A test of your honor. You will answer three questions.\"Langdon groaned, whispering at Sophie. \"Bear with me here. As I mentioned, he'ssomething of a character.\"\"Your first question,\" Teabing declared, his tone Herculean. \"Shall I serve youcoffee, or tea?\"Langdon knew Teabing's feelings about the American phenomenon of coffee. \"Tea,\"he replied. \"Earl Grey.\"\"Excellent. Your second question. Milk or sugar?\"Langdon hesitated.\"Milk,\" Sophie whispered in his ear. \"I think the British take milk.\"\"Milk,\" Langdon said.Silence.\"Sugar?\"Teabing made no reply.Wait! Langdon now recalled the bitter beverage he had been served on his lastvisit and realized this question was a trick. \"Lemon!\" he declared. \"Earl Greywith lemon\"\"Indeed.\" Teabing sounded deeply amused now. \"And finally, I must make the mostgrave of inquiries.\" Teabing paused and then spoke in a solemn tone. \"In whichyear did a Harvard sculler last outrow an Oxford man at Henley?\"Langdon had no idea, but he could imagine only one reason the question had beenasked. \"Surely such a travesty has never occurred.\"The gate clicked open. \"Your heart is true, my friend. You may pass.\" CHAPTER 53\"Monsieur Vernet!\" The night manager of the Depository Bank of Zurich feltrelieved to hear the bank president's voice on the phone. \"Where did you go,sir? The police are here, everyone is waiting for you!\"\"I have a little problem,\" the bank president said, sounding distressed. \"I needyour help right away.\"You have more than a little problem, the manager thought. The police hadentirely surrounded the bank and were threatening to have the DCPJ captainhimself show up with the warrant the bank had demanded. \"How can I help you,sir?\"\"Armored truck number three. I need to find it.\"Puzzled, the manager checked his delivery schedule. \"It's here. Downstairs atthe loading dock.\"\"Actually, no. The truck was stolen by the two individuals the police aretracking.\"\"What? How did they drive out?\"\"I can't go into the specifics on the phone, but we have a situation here thatcould potentially be extremely unfortunate for the bank.\"\"What do you need me to do, sir?\"\"I'd like you to activate the truck's emergency transponder.\"The night manager's eyes moved to the LoJack control box across the room. Likemany armored cars, each of the bank's trucks had been equipped with aradio-controlled homing device, which could be activated remotely from the bank.The manager had only used the emergency system once, after a hijacking, and ithad worked flawlessly—locating the truck and transmitting the coordinates to theauthorities automatically. Tonight, however, the manager had the impression thepresident was hoping for a bit more prudence. \"Sir, you are aware that if Iactivate the LoJack system, the transponder will simultaneously inform theauthorities that we have a problem.\"Vernet was silent for several seconds. \"Yes, I know. Do it anyway. Truck numberthree. I'll hold. I need the exact location of that truck the instant you haveit.\"\"Right away, sir.\" Thirty seconds later, forty kilometers away, hidden in the undercarriage of thearmored truck, a tiny transponder blinked to life. CHAPTER 54As Langdon and Sophie drove the armored truck up the winding, poplar-lineddriveway toward the house, Sophie could already feel her muscles relaxing. Itwas a relief to be off the road, and she could think of few safer places to gettheir feet under them than this private, gated estate owned by a good-naturedforeigner.They turned into the sweeping circular driveway, and Château Villette came intoview on their right. Three stories tall and at least sixty meters long, theedifice had gray stone facing illuminated by outside spotlights. The coarsefacade stood in stark juxtaposition to the immaculately landscaped gardens andglassy pond.The inside lights were just now coming on.Rather than driving to the front door, Langdon pulled into a parking areanestled in the evergreens. \"No reason to risk being spotted from the road,\" hesaid. \"Or having Leigh wonder why we arrived in a wrecked armored truck.\"Sophie nodded. \"What do we do with the cryptex? We probably shouldn't leave itout here, but if Leigh sees it, he'll certainly want to know what it is.\"\"Not to worry,\" Langdon said, removing his jacket as he stepped out of the car.He wrapped the tweed coat around the box and held the bundle in his arms like ababy.Sophie looked dubious. \"Subtle.\"\"Teabing never answers his own door; he prefers to make an entrance. I'll findsomewhere inside to stash this before he joins us.\" Langdon paused. \"Actually, Ishould probably warn you before you meet him. Sir Leigh has a sense of humorthat people often find a bit... strange.\"Sophie doubted anything tonight would strike her as strange anymore.The pathway to the main entrance was hand-laid cobblestone. It curved to a doorof carved oak and cherry with a brass knocker the size of a grapefruit. BeforeSophie could grasp the knocker, the door swung open from within.A prim and elegant butler stood before them, making final adjustments on thewhite tie and tuxedo he had apparently just donned. He looked to be about fifty,with refined features and an austere expression that left little doubt he wasunamused by their presence here.\"Sir Leigh will be down presently,\" he declared, his accent thick French. \"He isdressing. He prefers not to greet visitors while wearing only a nightshirt. MayI take your coat?\" He scowled at the bunched-up tweed in Langdon's arms.\"Thank you, I'm fine.\"\"Of course you are. Right this way, please.\"The butler guided them through a lush marble foyer into an exquisitely adorneddrawing room, softly lit by tassel-draped Victorian lamps. The air insidesmelled antediluvian, regal somehow, with traces of pipe tobacco, tea leaves,cooking sherry, and the earthen aroma of stone architecture. Against the farwall, flanked between two glistening suits of chain mail armor, was a rough-hewnfireplace large enough to roast an ox. Walking to the hearth, the butler kneltand touched a match to a pre-laid arrangement of oak logs and kindling. A firequickly crackled to life.The man stood, straightening his jacket. \"His master requests that you makeyourselves at home.\" With that, he departed, leaving Langdon and Sophie alone.Sophie wondered which of the fireside antiques she was supposed to sit on—theRenaissance velvet divan, the rustic eagle-claw rocker, or the pair of stonepews that looked like they'd been lifted from some Byzantine temple.Langdon unwrapped the cryptex from his coat, walked to the velvet divan, andslid the wooden box deep underneath it, well out of sight. Then, shaking out hisjacket, he put it back on, smoothed the lapels, and smiled at Sophie as he satdown directly over the stashed treasure.The divan it is, Sophie thought, taking a seat beside him.As she stared into the growing fire, enjoying the warmth, Sophie had thesensation that her grandfather would have loved this room. The dark woodpaneling was bedecked with Old Master paintings, one of which Sophie recognizedas a Poussin, her grandfather's second-favorite painter. On the mantel above thefireplace, an alabaster bust of Isis watched over the room.Beneath the Egyptian goddess, inside the fireplace, two stone gargoyles servedas andirons, their mouths gaping to reveal their menacing hollow throats.Gargoyles had always terrified Sophie as a child; that was, until hergrandfather cured her of the fear by taking her atop Notre Dame Cathedral in arainstorm. \"Princess, look at these silly creatures,\" he had told her, pointingto the gargoyle rainspouts with their mouths gushing water. \"Do you hear thatfunny sound in their throats?\" Sophie nodded, having to smile at the burpingsound of the water gurgling through their throats. \"They're gargling,\" hergrandfather told her. \"Gargariser! And that's where they get the silly name'gargoyles.' \" Sophie had never again been afraid.The fond memory caused Sophie a pang of sadness as the harsh reality of themurder gripped her again. Grand-père is gone. She pictured the cryptex under thedivan and wondered if Leigh Teabing would have any idea how to open it. Or if weeven should ask him. Sophie's grandfather's final words had instructed her tofind Robert Langdon. He had said nothing about involving anyone else. We neededsomewhere to hide, Sophie said, deciding to trust Robert's judgment.\"Sir Robert!\" a voice bellowed somewhere behind them. \"I see you travel with amaiden.\"Langdon stood up. Sophie jumped to her feet as well. The voice had come from thetop of a curled staircase that snaked up to the shadows of the second floor. Atthe top of the stairs, a form moved in the shadows, only his silhouette visible.\"Good evening,\" Langdon called up. \"Sir Leigh, may I present Sophie Neveu.\"\"An honor.\" Teabing moved into the light.\"Thank you for having us,\" Sophie said, now seeing the man wore metal leg bracesand used crutches. He was coming down one stair at a time. \"I realize it's quitelate.\"\"It is so late, my dear, it's early.\" He laughed. \"Vous n'êtes pas Américaine?\"Sophie shook her head. \"Parisienne.\"\"Your English is superb.\"\"Thank you. I studied at the Royal Holloway.\"\"So then, that explains it.\" Teabing hobbled lower through the shadows. \"PerhapsRobert told you I schooled just down the road at Oxford.\" Teabing fixed Langdonwith a devilish smile. \"Of course, I also applied to Harvard as my safetyschool.\"Their host arrived at the bottom of the stairs, appearing to Sophie no more likea knight than Sir Elton John. Portly and ruby-faced, Sir Leigh Teabing had bushyred hair and jovial hazel eyes that seemed to twinkle as he spoke. He worepleated pants and a roomy silk shirt under a paisley vest. Despite the aluminumbraces on his legs, he carried himself with a resilient, vertical dignity thatseemed more a by-product of noble ancestry than any kind of conscious effort.Teabing arrived and extended a hand to Langdon. \"Robert, you've lost weight.\"Langdon grinned. \"And you've found some.\"Teabing laughed heartily, patting his rotund belly. \"Touché. My only carnalpleasures these days seem to be culinary.\" Turning now to Sophie, he gently tookher hand, bowing his head slightly, breathing lightly on her fingers, anddiverting his eyes. \"M'lady.\"Sophie glanced at Langdon, uncertain whether she'd stepped back in time or intoa nuthouse.The butler who had answered the door now entered carrying a tea service, whichhe arranged on a table in front of the fireplace.\"This is Rémy Legaludec,\" Teabing said, \"my manservant.\"The slender butler gave a stiff nod and disappeared yet again.\"Rémy is Lyonais,\" Teabing whispered, as if it were an unfortunate disease. \"Buthe does sauces quite nicely.\"Langdon looked amused. \"I would have thought you'd import an English staff?\"\"Good heavens, no! I would not wish a British chef on anyone except the Frenchtax collectors.\" He glanced over at Sophie. \"Pardonnez-moi, Mademoiselle Neveu.Please be assured that my distaste for the French extends only to politics andthe soccer pitch. Your government steals my money, and your football squadrecently humiliated us.\"Sophie offered an easy smile.Teabing eyed her a moment and then looked at Langdon. \"Something has happened.You both look shaken.\"Langdon nodded. \"We've had an interesting night, Leigh.\"\"No doubt. You arrive on my doorstep unannounced in the middle of the nightspeaking of the Grail. Tell me, is this indeed about the Grail, or did yousimply say that because you know it is the lone topic for which I would rousemyself in the middle of the night?\"A little of both, Sophie thought, picturing the cryptex hidden beneath thecouch.\"Leigh,\" Langdon said, \"we'd like to talk to you about the Priory of Sion.\"Teabing's bushy eyebrows arched with intrigue. \"The keepers. So this is indeedabout the Grail. You say you come with information? Something new, Robert?\"\"Perhaps. We're not quite sure. We might have a better idea if we could get someinformation from you first.\"Teabing wagged his finger. \"Ever the wily American. A game of quid pro quo. Verywell. I am at your service. What is it I can tell you?\"Langdon sighed. \"I was hoping you would be kind enough to explain to Ms. Neveuthe true nature of the Holy Grail.\"Teabing looked stunned. \"She doesn't know?\"Langdon shook his head.The smile that grew on Teabing's face was almost obscene. \"Robert, you'vebrought me a virgin?\"Langdon winced, glancing at Sophie. \"Virgin is the term Grail enthusiasts use todescribe anyone who has never heard the true Grail story.\"Teabing turned eagerly to Sophie. \"How much do you know, my dear?\"Sophie quickly outlined what Langdon had explained earlier—the Priory of Sion,the Knights Templar, the Sangreal documents, and the Holy Grail, which manyclaimed was not a cup... but rather something far more powerful.\"That's all?\" Teabing fired Langdon a scandalous look. \"Robert, I thought youwere a gentleman. You've robbed her of the climax!\"\"I know, I thought perhaps you and I could...\" Langdon apparently decided theunseemly metaphor had gone far enough.Teabing already had Sophie locked in his twinkling gaze. \"You are a Grailvirgin, my dear. And trust me, you will never forget your first time.\" CHAPTER 55Seated on the divan beside Langdon, Sophie drank her tea and ate a scone,feeling the welcome effects of caffeine and food. Sir Leigh Teabing was beamingas he awkwardly paced before the open fire, his leg braces clicking on the stonehearth.\"The Holy Grail,\" Teabing said, his voice sermonic. \"Most people ask me onlywhere it is. I fear that is a question I may never answer.\" He turned and lookeddirectly at Sophie. \"However... the far more relevant question is this: What isthe Holy Grail?\"Sophie sensed a rising air of academic anticipation now in both of her malecompanions.\"To fully understand the Grail,\" Teabing continued, \"we must first understandthe Bible. How well do you know the New Testament?\"Sophie shrugged. \"Not at all, really. I was raised by a man who worshippedLeonardo da Vinci.\"Teabing looked both startled and pleased. \"An enlightened soul. Superb! Then youmust be aware that Leonardo was one of the keepers of the secret of the HolyGrail. And he hid clues in his art.\"\"Robert told me as much, yes.\"\"And Da Vinci's views on the New Testament?\"\"I have no idea.\"Teabing's eyes turned mirthful as he motioned to the bookshelf across the room.\"Robert, would you mind? On the bottom shelf. La Storia di Leonardo.\"Langdon went across the room, found a large art book, and brought it back,setting it down on the table between them. Twisting the book to face Sophie,Teabing flipped open the heavy cover and pointed inside the rear cover to aseries of quotations. \"From Da Vinci's notebook on polemics and speculation,\"Teabing said, indicating one quote in particular. \"I think you'll find thisrelevant to our discussion.\"Sophie read the words. Many have made a trade of delusionsand false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude.—LEONARDO DA VINCI \"Here's another,\" Teabing said, pointing to a different quote. Blinding ignorance does mislead us.O! Wretched mortals, open your eyes!—LEONARDO DA VINCI Sophie felt a little chill. \"Da Vinci is talking about the Bible?\"Teabing nodded. \"Leonardo's feelings about the Bible relate directly to the HolyGrail. In fact, Da Vinci painted the true Grail, which I will show youmomentarily, but first we must speak of the Bible.\" Teabing smiled. \"Andeverything you need to know about the Bible can be summed up by the great canondoctor Martyn Percy.\" Teabing cleared his throat and declared, \"The Bible didnot arrive by fax from heaven.\"\"I beg your pardon?\"\"The Bible is a product of man, my dear. Not of God. The Bible did not fallmagically from the clouds. Man created it as a historical record of tumultuoustimes, and it has evolved through countless translations, additions, andrevisions. History has never had a definitive version of the book.\"\"Okay.\"\"Jesus Christ was a historical figure of staggering influence, perhaps the mostenigmatic and inspirational leader the world has ever seen. As the prophesiedMessiah, Jesus toppled kings, inspired millions, and founded new philosophies.As a descendant of the lines of King Solomon and King David, Jesus possessed arightful claim to the throne of the King of the Jews. Understandably, His lifewas recorded by thousands of followers across the land.\" Teabing paused to siphis tea and then placed the cup back on the mantel. \"More than eighty gospelswere considered for the New Testament, and yet only a relative few were chosenfor inclusion—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John among them.\"Who chose which gospels to include?\" Sophie asked.\"Aha!\" Teabing burst in with enthusiasm. \"The fundamental irony of Christianity!The Bible, as we know it today, was collated by the pagan Roman emperorConstantine the Great.\"\"I thought Constantine was a Christian,\" Sophie said.\"Hardly,\" Teabing scoffed. \"He was a lifelong pagan who was baptized on hisdeathbed, too weak to protest. In Constantine's day, Rome's official religionwas sun worship—the cult of Sol Invictus, or the Invincible Sun—and Constantinewas its head priest. Unfortunately for him, a growing religious turmoil wasgripping Rome. Three centuries after the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, Christ'sfollowers had multiplied exponentially. Christians and pagans began warring, andthe conflict grew to such proportions that it threatened to rend Rome in two.Constantine decided something had to be done. In 325 A.D., he decided to unifyRome under a single religion. Christianity.\"Sophie was surprised. \"Why would a pagan emperor choose Christianity as theofficial religion?\"Teabing chuckled. \"Constantine was a very good businessman. He could see thatChristianity was on the rise, and he simply backed the winning horse. Historiansstill marvel at the brilliance with which Constantine converted thesun-worshipping pagans to Christianity. By fusing pagan symbols, dates, andrituals into the growing Christian tradition, he created a kind of hybridreligion that was acceptable to both parties.\"\"Transmogrification,\" Langdon said. \"The vestiges of pagan religion in Christiansymbology are undeniable. Egyptian sun disks became the halos of Catholicsaints. Pictograms of Isis nursing her miraculously conceived son Horus becamethe blueprint for our modern images of the Virgin Mary nursing Baby Jesus. Andvirtually all the elements of the Catholic ritual—the miter, the altar, thedoxology, and communion, the act of \"God-eating\"—were taken directly fromearlier pagan mystery religions.\"Teabing groaned. \"Don't get a symbologist started on Christian icons. Nothing inChristianity is original. The pre-Christian God Mithras—called the Son of Godand the Light of the World—was born on December 25, died, was buried in a rocktomb, and then resurrected in three days. By the way, December 25 is also thebirthday of Osiris, Adonis, and Dionysus. The newborn Krishna was presented withgold, frankincense, and myrrh. Even Christianity's weekly holy day was stolenfrom the pagans.\"\"What do you mean?\"\"Originally,\" Langdon said, \"Christianity honored the Jewish Sabbath ofSaturday, but Constantine shifted it to coincide with the pagan's veneration dayof the sun.\" He paused, grinning. \"To this day, most churchgoers attend serviceson Sunday morning with no idea that they are there on account of the pagan sungod's weekly tribute—Sunday.\"Sophie's head was spinning. \"And all of this relates to the Grail?\"\"Indeed,\" Teabing said. \"Stay with me. During this fusion of religions,Constantine needed to strengthen the new Christian tradition, and held a famousecumenical gathering known as the Council of Nicaea.\"Sophie had heard of it only insofar as its being the birthplace of the NiceneCreed.\"At this gathering,\" Teabing said, \"many aspects of Christianity were debatedand voted upon—the date of Easter, the role of the bishops, the administrationof sacraments, and, of course, the divinity of Jesus.\"\"I don't follow. His divinity?\"\"My dear,\" Teabing declared, \"until that moment in history, Jesus was viewed byHis followers as a mortal prophet... a great and powerful man, but a mannonetheless. A mortal.\"\"Not the Son of God?\"\"Right,\" Teabing said. \"Jesus' establishment as 'the Son of God' was officiallyproposed and voted on by the Council of Nicaea.\"\"Hold on. You're saying Jesus' divinity was the result of a vote?\"\"A relatively close vote at that,\" Teabing added. \"Nonetheless, establishingChrist's divinity was critical to the further unification of the Roman empireand to the new Vatican power base. By officially endorsing Jesus as the Son ofGod, Constantine turned Jesus into a deity who existed beyond the scope of thehuman world, an entity whose power was unchallengeable. This not only precludedfurther pagan challenges to Christianity, but now the followers of Christ wereable to redeem themselves only via the established sacred channel—the RomanCatholic Church.\"Sophie glanced at Langdon, and he gave her a soft nod of concurrence.\"It was all about power,\" Teabing continued. \"Christ as Messiah was critical tothe functioning of Church and state. Many scholars claim that the early Churchliterally stole Jesus from His original followers, hijacking His human message,shrouding it in an impenetrable cloak of divinity, and using it to expand theirown power. I've written several books on the topic.\"\"And I assume devout Christians send you hate mail on a daily basis?\"\"Why would they?\" Teabing countered. \"The vast majority of educated Christiansknow the history of their faith. Jesus was indeed a great and powerful man.Constantine's underhanded political maneuvers don't diminish the majesty ofChrist's life. Nobody is saying Christ was a fraud, or denying that He walkedthe earth and inspired millions to better lives. All we are saying is thatConstantine took advantage of Christ's substantial influence and importance. Andin doing so, he shaped the face of Christianity as we know it today.\"Sophie glanced at the art book before her, eager to move on and see the Da Vincipainting of the Holy Grail.\"The twist is this,\" Teabing said, talking faster now. \"Because Constantineupgraded Jesus' status almost four centuries after Jesus' death, thousands ofdocuments already existed chronicling His life as a mortal man. To rewrite thehistory books, Constantine knew he would need a bold stroke. From this sprangthe most profound moment in Christian history.\" Teabing paused, eyeing Sophie.\"Constantine commissioned and financed a new Bible, which omitted those gospelsthat spoke of Christ's human traits and embellished those gospels that made Himgodlike. The earlier gospels were outlawed, gathered up, and burned.\"\"An interesting note,\" Langdon added. \"Anyone who chose the forbidden gospelsover Constantine's version was deemed a heretic. The word heretic derives fromthat moment in history. The Latin word haereticus means 'choice.' Those who'chose' the original history of Christ were the world's first heretics.\"\"Fortunately for historians,\" Teabing said, \"some of the gospels thatConstantine attempted to eradicate managed to survive. The Dead Sea Scrolls werefound in the 1950s hidden in a cave near Qumran in the Judean desert. And, ofcourse, the Coptic Scrolls in 1945 at Nag Hammadi. In addition to telling thetrue Grail story, these documents speak of Christ's ministry in very humanterms. Of course, the Vatican, in keeping with their tradition ofmisinformation, tried very hard to suppress the release of these scrolls. Andwhy wouldn't they? The scrolls highlight glaring historical discrepancies andfabrications, clearly confirming that the modern Bible was compiled and editedby men who possessed a political agenda—to promote the divinity of the man JesusChrist and use His influence to solidify their own power base.\"\"And yet,\" Langdon countered, \"it's important to remember that the modernChurch's desire to suppress these documents comes from a sincere belief in theirestablished view of Christ. The Vatican is made up of deeply pious men who trulybelieve these contrary documents could only be false testimony.\"Teabing chuckled as he eased himself into a chair opposite Sophie. \"As you cansee, our professor has a far softer heart for Rome than I do. Nonetheless, he iscorrect about the modern clergy believing these opposing documents are falsetestimony. That's understandable. Constantine's Bible has been their truth forages. Nobody is more indoctrinated than the indoctrinator.\"\"What he means,\" Langdon said, \"is that we worship the gods of our fathers.\"\"What I mean,\" Teabing countered, \"is that almost everything our fathers taughtus about Christ is false. As are the stories about the Holy Grail.\"Sophie looked again at the Da Vinci quote before her. Blinding ignorance doesmislead us. O! Wretched mortals, open your eyes!Teabing reached for the book and flipped toward the center. \"And finally, beforeI show you Da Vinci's paintings of the Holy Grail, I'd like you to take a quicklook at this.\" He opened the book to a colorful graphic that spanned both fullpages. \"I assume you recognize this fresco?\"He's kidding, right? Sophie was staring at the most famous fresco of alltime—The Last Supper—Da Vinci's legendary painting from the wall of Santa Mariadelle Grazie near Milan. The decaying fresco portrayed Jesus and His disciplesat the moment that Jesus announced one of them would betray Him. \"I know thefresco, yes.\"\"Then perhaps you would indulge me this little game? Close your eyes if youwould.\"Uncertain, Sophie closed her eyes.\"Where is Jesus sitting?\" Teabing asked.\"In the center.\"\"Good. And what food are He and His disciples breaking and eating?\"\"Bread.\" Obviously.\"Superb. And what drink?\"\"Wine. They drank wine.\"\"Great. And one final question. How many wineglasses are on the table?\"Sophie paused, realizing it was the trick question. And after dinner, Jesus tookthe cup of wine, sharing it with His disciples. \"One cup,\" she said. \"Thechalice.\" The Cup of Christ. The Holy Grail. \"Jesus passed a single chalice ofwine, just as modern Christians do at communion.\"Teabing sighed. \"Open your eyes.\"She did. Teabing was grinning smugly. Sophie looked down at the painting, seeingto her astonishment that everyone at the table had a glass of wine, includingChrist. Thirteen cups. Moreover, the cups were tiny, stemless, and made ofglass. There was no chalice in the painting. No Holy Grail.Teabing's eyes twinkled. \"A bit strange, don't you think, considering that boththe Bible and our standard Grail legend celebrate this moment as the definitivearrival of the Holy Grail. Oddly, Da Vinci appears to have forgotten to paintthe Cup of Christ.\"\"Surely art scholars must have noted that.\"\"You will be shocked to learn what anomalies Da Vinci included here that mostscholars either do not see or simply choose to ignore. This fresco, in fact, isthe entire key to the Holy Grail mystery. Da Vinci lays it all out in the openin The Last Supper\"Sophie scanned the work eagerly. \"Does this fresco tell us what the Grail reallyis?\"\"Not what it is,\" Teabing whispered. \"But rather who it is. The Holy Grail isnot a thing. It is, in fact... a person\" CHAPTER 56Sophie stared at Teabing a long moment and then turned to Langdon. \"The HolyGrail is a person?\"Langdon nodded. \"A woman, in fact.\" From the blank look on Sophie's face,Langdon could tell they had already lost her. He recalled having a similarreaction the first time he heard the statement. It was not until he understoodthe symbology behind the Grail that the feminine connection became clear.Teabing apparently had a similar thought. \"Robert, perhaps this is the momentfor the symbologist to clarify?\" He went to a nearby end table, found a piece ofpaper, and laid it in front of Langdon.Langdon pulled a pen from his pocket. \"Sophie, are you familiar with the modernicons for male and female?\" He drew the common male symbol mail[danbrown/davincicode-1.gif]and female symbol female[danbrown/davincicode-2.gif].\"Of course,\" she said.\"These,\" he said quietly, \"are not the original symbols for male and female.Many people incorrectly assume the male symbol is derived from a shield andspear, while the female symbol represents a mirror reflecting beauty. In fact,the symbols originated as ancient astronomical symbols for the planet-god Marsand planet-goddess Venus. The original symbols are far simpler.\" Langdon drewanother icon on the paper./\" [danbrown/davincicode-3.gif]\"This symbol is the original icon for male,\" he told her. \"A rudimentaryphallus.\"\"Quite to the point,\" Sophie said.\"As it were,\" Teabing added.Langdon went on. \"This icon is formally known as the blade, and it representsaggression and manhood. In fact, this exact phallus symbol is still used todayon modern military uniforms to denote rank.\"\"Indeed.\" Teabing grinned. \"The more penises you have, the higher your rank.Boys will be boys.\"Langdon winced. \"Moving on, the female symbol, as you might imagine, is theexact opposite.\" He drew another symbol on the page. \"This is called thechalice.\"\\/ [danbrown/davincicode-4.gif]Sophie glanced up, looking surprised.Langdon could see she had made the connection. \"The chalice,\" he said,\"resembles a cup or vessel, and more important, it resembles the shape of awoman's womb. This symbol communicates femininity, womanhood, and fertility.\"Langdon looked directly at her now. \"Sophie, legend tells us the Holy Grail is achalice—a cup. But the Grail's description as a chalice is actually an allegoryto protect the true nature of the Holy Grail. That is to say, the legend usesthe chalice as a metaphor for something far more important.\"\"A woman,\" Sophie said.\"Exactly.\" Langdon smiled. \"The Grail is literally the ancient symbol forwomanhood, and the Holy Grail represents the sacred feminine and the goddess,which of course has now been lost, virtually eliminated by the Church. The powerof the female and her ability to produce life was once very sacred, but it poseda threat to the rise of the predominantly male Church, and so the sacredfeminine was demonized and called unclean. It was man, not God, who created theconcept of 'original sin,' whereby Eve tasted of the apple and caused thedownfall of the human race. Woman, once the sacred giver of life, was now theenemy.\"\"I should add,\" Teabing chimed, \"that this concept of woman as life-bringer wasthe foundation of ancient religion. Childbirth was mystical and powerful. Sadly,Christian philosophy decided to embezzle the female's creative power by ignoringbiological truth and making man the Creator. Genesis tells us that Eve wascreated from Adam's rib. Woman became an offshoot of man. And a sinful one atthat. Genesis was the beginning of the end for the goddess.\"\"The Grail,\" Langdon said, \"is symbolic of the lost goddess. When Christianitycame along, the old pagan religions did not die easily. Legends of chivalricquests for the lost Grail were in fact stories of forbidden quests to find thelost sacred feminine. Knights who claimed to be \"searching for the chalice\" werespeaking in code as a way to protect themselves from a Church that hadsubjugated women, banished the Goddess, burned nonbelievers, and forbidden thepagan reverence for the sacred feminine.\"Sophie shook her head. \"I'm sorry, when you said the Holy Grail was a person, Ithought you meant it was an actual person.\"\"It is,\" Langdon said.\"And not just any person,\" Teabing blurted, clambering excitedly to his feet. \"Awoman who carried with her a secret so powerful that, if revealed, it threatenedto devastate the very foundation of Christianity!\"Sophie looked overwhelmed. \"Is this woman well known in history?\"\"Quite.\" Teabing collected his crutches and motioned down the hall. \"And if weadjourn to the study, my friends, it would be my honor to show you Da Vinci'spainting of her.\" Two rooms away, in the kitchen, manservant Rémy Legaludec stood in silencebefore a television. The news station was broadcasting photos of a man andwoman... the same two individuals to whom Rémy had just served tea. CHAPTER 57Standing at the roadblock outside the Depository Bank of Zurich, LieutenantCollet wondered what was taking Fache so long to come up with the searchwarrant. The bankers were obviously hiding something. They claimed Langdon andNeveu had arrived earlier and were turned away from the bank because they didnot have proper account identification.So why won't they let us inside for a look?Finally, Collet's cellular phone rang. It was the command post at the Louvre.\"Do we have a search warrant yet?\" Collet demanded.\"Forget about the bank, Lieutenant,\" the agent told him. \"We just got a tip. Wehave the exact location where Langdon and Neveu are hiding.\"Collet sat down hard on the hood of his car. \"You're kidding.\"\"I have an address in the suburbs. Somewhere near Versailles.\"\"Does Captain Fache know?\"\"Not yet. He's busy on an important call.\"\"I'm on my way. Have him call as soon as he's free.\" Collet took down theaddress and jumped in his car. As he peeled away from the bank, Collet realizedhe had forgotten to ask who had tipped DCPJ off to Langdon's location. Not thatit mattered. Collet had been blessed with a chance to redeem his skepticism andearlier blunders. He was about to make the most high-profile arrest of hiscareer.Collet radioed the five cars accompanying him. \"No sirens, men. Langdon can'tknow we're coming.\" Forty kilometers away, a black Audi pulled off a rural road and parked in theshadows on the edge of a field. Silas got out and peered through the rungs ofthe wrought-iron fence that encircled the vast compound before him. He gazed upthe long moonlit slope to the château in the distance.The downstairs lights were all ablaze. Odd for this hour, Silas thought,smiling. The information the Teacher had given him was obviously accurate. Iwill not leave this house without the keystone, he vowed. I will not fail thebishop and the Teacher.Checking the thirteen-round clip in his Heckler Koch, Silas pushed it throughthe bars and let it fall onto the mossy ground inside the compound. Then,gripping the top of the fence, he heaved himself up and over, dropping to theground on the other side. Ignoring the slash of pain from his cilice, Silasretrieved his gun and began the long trek up the grassy slope. CHAPTER 58Teabing's \"study\" was like no study Sophie had ever seen. Six or seven timeslarger than even the most luxurious of office spaces, the knight's cabinet detravail resembled an ungainly hybrid of science laboratory, archival library,and indoor flea market. Lit by three overhead chandeliers, the boundless tilefloor was dotted with clustered islands of worktables buried beneath books,artwork, artifacts, and a surprising amount of electronic gear—computers,projectors, microscopes, copy machines, and flatbed scanners.\"I converted the ballroom,\" Teabing said, looking sheepish as he shuffled intothe room. \"I have little occasion to dance.\"Sophie felt as if the entire night had become some kind of twilight zone wherenothing was as she expected. \"This is all for your work?\"\"Learning the truth has become my life's love,\" Teabing said. \"And the Sangrealis my favorite mistress.\"The Holy Grail is a woman, Sophie thought, her mind a collage of interrelatedideas that seemed to make no sense. \"You said you have a picture of this womanwho you claim is the Holy Grail.\"\"Yes, but it is not I who claim she is the Grail. Christ Himself made thatclaim.\"\"Which one is the painting?\" Sophie asked, scanning the walls.\"Hmmm...\" Teabing made a show of seeming to have forgotten. \"The Holy Grail. TheSangreal. The Chalice.\" He wheeled suddenly and pointed to the far wall. On ithung an eight-foot-long print of The Last Supper, the same exact image Sophiehad just been looking at. \"There she is!\"Sophie was certain she had missed something. \"That's the same painting you justshowed me.\"He winked. \"I know, but the enlargement is so much more exciting. Don't youthink?\"Sophie turned to Langdon for help. \"I'm lost.\"Langdon smiled. \"As it turns out, the Holy Grail does indeed make an appearancein The Last Supper. Leonardo included her prominently.\"\"Hold on,\" Sophie said. \"You told me the Holy Grail is a woman. The Last Supperis a painting of thirteen men.\"\"Is it?\" Teabing arched his eyebrows. \"Take a closer look.\"Uncertain, Sophie made her way closer to the painting, scanning the thirteenfigures—Jesus Christ in the middle, six disciples on His left, and six on Hisright. \"They're all men,\" she confirmed.\"Oh?\" Teabing said. \"How about the one seated in the place of honor, at theright hand of the Lord?\"Sophie examined the figure to Jesus' immediate right, focusing in. As shestudied the person's face and body, a wave of astonishment rose within her. Theindividual had flowing red hair, delicate folded hands, and the hint of a bosom.It was, without a doubt... female.\"That's a woman!\" Sophie exclaimed.Teabing was laughing. \"Surprise, surprise. Believe me, it's no mistake. Leonardowas skilled at painting the difference between the sexes.\"Sophie could not take her eyes from the woman beside Christ. The Last Supper issupposed to be thirteen men. Who is this woman? Although Sophie had seen thisclassic image many times, she had not once noticed this glaring discrepancy.\"Everyone misses it,\" Teabing said. \"Our preconceived notions of this scene areso powerful that our mind blocks out the incongruity and overrides our eyes.\"\"It's known as skitoma,\" Langdon added. \"The brain does it sometimes withpowerful symbols.\"\"Another reason you might have missed the woman,\" Teabing said, \"is that many ofthe photographs in art books were taken before 1954, when the details were stillhidden beneath layers of grime and several restorative repaintings done byclumsy hands in the eighteenth century. Now, at last, the fresco has beencleaned down to Da Vinci's original layer of paint.\" He motioned to thephotograph. \"Et voilà!\"Sophie moved closer to the image. The woman to Jesus' right was young andpious-looking, with a demure face, beautiful red hair, and hands folded quietly.This is the woman who singlehandedly could crumble the Church?\"Who is she?\" Sophie asked.\"That, my dear,\" Teabing replied, \"is Mary Magdalene.\"Sophie turned. \"The prostitute?\"Teabing drew a short breath, as if the word had injured him personally.\"Magdalene was no such thing. That unfortunate misconception is the legacy of asmear campaign launched by the early Church. The Church needed to defame MaryMagdalene in order to cover up her dangerous secret—her role as the Holy Grail.\"\"Her role?\"\"As I mentioned,\" Teabing clarified, \"the early Church needed to convince theworld that the mortal prophet Jesus was a divine being. Therefore, any gospelsthat described earthly aspects of Jesus' life had to be omitted from the Bible.Unfortunately for the early editors, one particularly troubling earthly themekept recurring in the gospels. Mary Magdalene.\" He paused. \"More specifically,her marriage to Jesus Christ.\"\"I beg your pardon?\" Sophie's eyes moved to Langdon and then back to Teabing.\"It's a matter of historical record,\" Teabing said, \"and Da Vinci was certainlyaware of that fact. The Last Supper practically shouts at the viewer that Jesusand Magdalene were a pair.\"Sophie glanced back to the fresco.\"Notice that Jesus and Magdalene are clothed as mirror images of one another.\"Teabing pointed to the two individuals in the center of the fresco.Sophie was mesmerized. Sure enough, their clothes were inverse colors. Jesuswore a red robe and blue cloak; Mary Magdalene wore a blue robe and red cloak.Yin and yang.\"Venturing into the more bizarre,\" Teabing said, \"note that Jesus and His brideappear to be joined at the hip and are leaning away from one another as if tocreate this clearly delineated negative space between them.\"Even before Teabing traced the contour for her, Sophie saw it—the indisputable Vshape at the focal point of the painting. It was the same symbol Langdon haddrawn earlier for the Grail, the chalice, and the female womb.\"Finally,\" Teabing said, \"if you view Jesus and Magdalene as compositionalelements rather than as people, you will see another obvious shape leap out atyou.\" He paused. \"A letter of the alphabet.\"Sophie saw it at once. To say the letter leapt out at her was an understatement.The letter was suddenly all Sophie could see. Glaring in the center of thepainting was the unquestionable outline of an enormous, flawlessly formed letterM.\"A bit too perfect for coincidence, wouldn't you say?\" Teabing asked.Sophie was amazed. \"Why is it there?\"Teabing shrugged. \"Conspiracy theorists will tell you it stands for Matrimonioor Mary Magdalene. To be honest, nobody is certain. The only certainty is thatthe hidden M is no mistake. Countless Grail-related works contain the hiddenletter M—whether as watermarks, underpaintings, or compositional allusions. Themost blatant M, of course, is emblazoned on the altar at Our Lady of Paris inLondon, which was designed by a former Grand Master of the Priory of Sion, JeanCocteau.\"Sophie weighed the information. \"I'll admit, the hidden M's are intriguing,although I assume nobody is claiming they are proof of Jesus' marriage toMagdalene.\"\"No, no,\" Teabing said, going to a nearby table of books. \"As I said earlier,the marriage of Jesus and Mary Magdalene is part of the historical record.\" Hebegan pawing through his book collection. \"Moreover, Jesus as a married manmakes infinitely more sense than our standard biblical view of Jesus as abachelor.\"\"Why?\" Sophie asked.\"Because Jesus was a Jew,\" Langdon said, taking over while Teabing searched forhis book, \"and the social decorum during that time virtually forbid a Jewish manto be unmarried. According to Jewish custom, celibacy was condemned, and theobligation for a Jewish father was to find a suitable wife for his son. If Jesuswere not married, at least one of the Bible's gospels would have mentioned itand offered some explanation for His unnatural state of bachelorhood.\"Teabing located a huge book and pulled it toward him across the table. Theleather-bound edition was poster-sized, like a huge atlas. The cover read: TheGnostic Gospels. Teabing heaved it open, and Langdon and Sophie joined him.Sophie could see it contained photographs of what appeared to be magnifiedpassages of ancient documents—tattered papyrus with handwritten text. She didnot recognize the ancient language, but the facing pages bore typedtranslations.\"These are photocopies of the Nag Hammadi and Dead Sea scrolls, which Imentioned earlier,\" Teabing said. \"The earliest Christian records. Troublingly,they do not match up with the gospels in the Bible.\" Flipping toward the middleof the book, Teabing pointed to a passage. \"The Gospel of Philip is always agood place to start.\" Sophie read the passage:> And the companion of the Saviour is Mary Magdalene. Christ loved her more than> all the disciples and used to kiss her often on her mouth. The rest of the> disciples were offended by it and expressed disapproval. They said to him,> \"Why do you love her more than all of us?\"The words surprised Sophie, and yet they hardly seemed conclusive. \"It saysnothing of marriage.\"\"Au contraire.\" Teabing smiled, pointing to the first line. \"As any Aramaicscholar will tell you, the word companion, in those days, literally meantspouse.\"Langdon concurred with a nod.Sophie read the first line again. And the companion of the Saviour is MaryMagdalene.Teabing flipped through the book and pointed out several other passages that, toSophie's surprise, clearly suggested Magdalene and Jesus had a romanticrelationship. As she read the passages, Sophie recalled an angry priest who hadbanged on her grandfather's door when she was a schoolgirl.\"Is this the home of Jacques Saunière?\" the priest had demanded, glaring down atyoung Sophie when she pulled open the door. \"I want to talk to him about thiseditorial he wrote.\" The priest held up a newspaper.Sophie summoned her grandfather, and the two men disappeared into his study andclosed the door. My grandfather wrote something in the paper? Sophie immediatelyran to the kitchen and flipped through that morning's paper. She found hergrandfather's name on an article on the second page. She read it. Sophie didn'tunderstand all of what was said, but it sounded like the French government,under pressure from priests, had agreed to ban an American movie called The LastTemptation of Christ, which was about Jesus having sex with a lady called MaryMagdalene. Her grandfather's article said the Church was arrogant and wrong toban it.No wonder the priest is mad, Sophie thought.\"It's pornography! Sacrilege!\" the priest yelled, emerging from the study andstorming to the front door. \"How can you possibly endorse that! This AmericanMartin Scorsese is a blasphemer, and the Church will permit him no pulpit inFrance!\" The priest slammed the door on his way out.When her grandfather came into the kitchen, he saw Sophie with the paper andfrowned. \"You're quick.\"Sophie said, \"You think Jesus Christ had a girlfriend?\"\"No, dear, I said the Church should not be allowed to tell us what notions wecan and can't entertain.\"\"Did Jesus have a girlfriend?\"Her grandfather was silent for several moments. \"Would it be so bad if He did?\"Sophie considered it and then shrugged. \"I wouldn't mind.\" Sir Leigh Teabing was still talking. \"I shan't bore you with the countlessreferences to Jesus and Magdalene's union. That has been explored ad nauseum bymodern historians. I would, however, like to point out the following.\" Hemotioned to another passage. \"This is from the Gospel of Mary Magdalene.\"Sophie had not known a gospel existed in Magdalene's words. She read the text:> And Peter said, \"Did the Saviour really speak with a woman without our> knowledge? Are we to turn about and all listen to her? Did he prefer her to> us?\"> > And Levi answered, \"Peter, you have always been hot-tempered. Now I see you> contending against the woman like an adversary. If the Saviour made her> worthy, who are you indeed to reject her? Surely the Saviour knows her very> well. That is why he loved her more than us.\"\"The woman they are speaking of,\" Teabing explained, \"is Mary Magdalene. Peteris jealous of her.\"\"Because Jesus preferred Mary?\"\"Not only that. The stakes were far greater than mere affection. At this pointin the gospels, Jesus suspects He will soon be captured and crucified. So Hegives Mary Magdalene instructions on how to carry on His Church after He isgone. As a result, Peter expresses his discontent over playing second fiddle toa woman. I daresay Peter was something of a sexist.\"Sophie was trying to keep up. \"This is Saint Peter. The rock on which Jesusbuilt His Church.\"\"The same, except for one catch. According to these unaltered gospels, it wasnot Peter to whom Christ gave directions with which to establish the ChristianChurch. It was Mary Magdalene.\"Sophie looked at him. \"You're saying the Christian Church was to be carried onby a woman?\"\"That was the plan. Jesus was the original feminist. He intended for the futureof His Church to be in the hands of Mary Magdalene.\"\"And Peter had a problem with that,\" Langdon said, pointing to The Last Supper.\"That's Peter there. You can see that Da Vinci was well aware of how Peter feltabout Mary Magdalene.\"Again, Sophie was speechless. In the painting, Peter was leaning menacinglytoward Mary Magdalene and slicing his blade-like hand across her neck. The samethreatening gesture as in Madonna of the Rocks!\"And here too,\" Langdon said, pointing now to the crowd of disciples near Peter.\"A bit ominous, no?\"Sophie squinted and saw a hand emerging from the crowd of disciples. \"Is thathand wielding a dagger?\"\"Yes. Stranger still, if you count the arms, you'll see that this hand belongsto... no one at all. It's disembodied. Anonymous.\"Sophie was starting to feel overwhelmed. \"I'm sorry, I still don't understandhow all of this makes Mary Magdalene the Holy Grail.\"\"Aha!\" Teabing exclaimed again. \"Therein lies the rub!\" He turned once more tothe table and pulled out a large chart, spreading it out for her. It was anelaborate genealogy. \"Few people realize that Mary Magdalene, in addition tobeing Christ's right hand, was a powerful woman already.\"Sophie could now see the title of the family tree. THE TRIBE OF BENJAMIN \"Mary Magdalene is here,\" Teabing said, pointing near the top of the genealogy.Sophie was surprised. \"She was of the House of Benjamin?\"\"Indeed,\" Teabing said. \"Mary Magdalene was of royal descent.\"\"But I was under the impression Magdalene was poor.\"Teabing shook his head. \"Magdalene was recast as a whore in order to eraseevidence of her powerful family ties.\"Sophie found herself again glancing at Langdon, who again nodded. She turnedback to Teabing. \"But why would the early Church care if Magdalene had royalblood?\"The Briton smiled. \"My dear child, it was not Mary Magdalene's royal blood thatconcerned the Church so much as it was her consorting with Christ, who also hadroyal blood. As you know, the Book of Matthew tells us that Jesus was of theHouse of David. A descendant of King Solomon—King of the Jews. By marrying intothe powerful House of Benjamin, Jesus fused two royal bloodlines, creating apotent political union with the potential of making a legitimate claim to thethrone and restoring the line of kings as it was under Solomon.\"Sophie sensed he was at last coming to his point.Teabing looked excited now. \"The legend of the Holy Grail is a legend aboutroyal blood. When Grail legend speaks of 'the chalice that held the blood ofChrist'... it speaks, in fact, of Mary Magdalene—the female womb that carriedJesus' royal bloodline.\"The words seemed to echo across the ballroom and back before they fullyregistered in Sophie's mind. Mary Magdalene carried the royal bloodline of JesusChrist? \"But how could Christ have a bloodline unless...?\" She paused and lookedat Langdon.Langdon smiled softly. \"Unless they had a child.\"Sophie stood transfixed.\"Behold,\" Teabing proclaimed, \"the greatest cover-up in human history. Not onlywas Jesus Christ married, but He was a father. My dear, Mary Magdalene was theHoly Vessel. She was the chalice that bore the royal bloodline of Jesus Christ.She was the womb that bore the lineage, and the vine from which the sacred fruitsprang forth!\"Sophie felt the hairs stand up on her arms. \"But how could a secret that big bekept quiet all of these years?\"\"Heavens!\" Teabing said. \"It has been anything but quiet! The royal bloodline ofJesus Christ is the source of the most enduring legend of all time—the HolyGrail. Magdalene's story has been shouted from the rooftops for centuries in allkinds of metaphors and languages. Her story is everywhere once you open youreyes.\"\"And the Sangreal documents?\" Sophie said. \"They allegedly contain proof thatJesus had a royal bloodline?\"\"They do.\"\"So the entire Holy Grail legend is all about royal blood?\"\"Quite literally,\" Teabing said. \"The word Sangreal derives from San Greal—orHoly Grail. But in its most ancient form, the word Sangreal was divided in adifferent spot.\" Teabing wrote on a piece of scrap paper and handed it to her.She read what he had written. Sang Real Instantly, Sophie recognized the translation. Sang Real literally meant RoyalBlood. CHAPTER 59The male receptionist in the lobby of the Opus Dei headquarters on LexingtonAvenue in New York City was surprised to hear Bishop Aringarosa's voice on theline. \"Good evening, sir.\"\"Have I had any messages?\" the bishop demanded, sounding unusually anxious.\"Yes, sir. I'm very glad you called in. I couldn't reach you in your apartment.You had an urgent phone message about half an hour ago.\"\"Yes?\" He sounded relieved by the news. \"Did the caller leave a name?\"\"No, sir, just a number.\" The operator relayed the number.\"Prefix thirty-three? That's France, am I right?\"\"Yes, sir. Paris. The caller said it was critical you contact him immediately.\"\"Thank you. I have been waiting for that call.\" Aringarosa quickly severed theconnection.As the receptionist hung up the receiver, he wondered why Aringarosa's phoneconnection sounded so crackly. The bishop's daily schedule showed him in NewYork this weekend, and yet he sounded a world away. The receptionist shrugged itoff. Bishop Aringarosa had been acting very strangely the last few months. My cellular phone must not have been receiving, Aringarosa thought as the Fiatapproached the exit for Rome's Ciampino Charter Airport. The Teacher was tryingto reach me. Despite Aringarosa's concern at having missed the call, he feltencouraged that the Teacher felt confident enough to call Opus Dei headquartersdirectly.Things must have gone well in Paris tonight.As Aringarosa began dialing the number, he felt excited to know he would soon bein Paris. I'll be on the ground before dawn. Aringarosa had a chartered turboprop awaiting him here for the short flight to France. Commercial carriers werenot an option at this hour, especially considering the contents of hisbriefcase.The line began to ring.A female voice answered. \"Direction Centrale Police Judidaire.\"Aringarosa felt himself hesitate. This was unexpected. \"Ah, yes... I was askedto call this number?\"\"Qui êtes-vous?\" the woman said. \"Your name?\"Aringarosa was uncertain if he should reveal it. The French Judicial Police?\"Your name, monsieur?\" the woman pressed.\"Bishop Manuel Aringarosa.\"\"Un moment.\" There was a click on the line.After a long wait, another man came on, his tone gruff and concerned. \"Bishop, Iam glad I finally reached you. You and I have much to discuss.\" CHAPTER 60Sangreal... Sang Real... San Greal... Royal Blood... Holy Grail.It was all intertwined.The Holy Grail is Mary Magdalene... the mother of the royal bloodline of JesusChrist. Sophie felt a new wave of disorientation as she stood in the silence ofthe ballroom and stared at Robert Langdon. The more pieces Langdon and Teabinglaid on the table tonight, the more unpredictable this puzzle became.\"As you can see, my dear,\" Teabing said, hobbling toward a bookshelf, \"Leonardois not the only one who has been trying to tell the world the truth about theHoly Grail. The royal bloodline of Jesus Christ has been chronicled inexhaustive detail by scores of historians.\" He ran a finger down a row ofseveral dozen books.Sophie tilted her head and scanned the list of titles:> > > THE TEMPLAR REVELATION:> > Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ> > > > THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR:> > Mary Magdalene and the Holy Grail> > > > THE GODDESS IN THE GOSPELS> > Reclaiming the Sacred Feminine> > \"Here is perhaps the best-known tome,\" Teabing said, pulling a tatteredhardcover from the stack and handing it to her. The cover read:> > > HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL> > The Acclaimed International Bestseller> > Sophie glanced up. \"An international bestseller? I've never heard of it.\"\"You were young. This caused quite a stir back in the nineteen eighties. To mytaste, the authors made some dubious leaps of faith in their analysis, but theirfundamental premise is sound, and to their credit, they finally brought the ideaof Christ's bloodline into the mainstream.\"\"What was the Church's reaction to the book?\"\"Outrage, of course. But that was to be expected. After all, this was a secretthe Vatican had tried to bury in the fourth century. That's part of what theCrusades were about. Gathering and destroying information. The threat MaryMagdalene posed to the men of the early Church was potentially ruinous. Not onlywas she the woman to whom Jesus had assigned the task of founding the Church,but she also had physical proof that the Church's newly proclaimed deity hadspawned a mortal bloodline. The Church, in order to defend itself against theMagdalene's power, perpetuated her image as a whore and buried evidence ofChrist's marriage to her, thereby defusing any potential claims that Christ hada surviving bloodline and was a mortal prophet.\"Sophie glanced at Langdon, who nodded. \"Sophie, the historical evidencesupporting this is substantial.\"\"I admit,\" Teabing said, \"the assertions are dire, but you must understand theChurch's powerful motivations to conduct such a cover-up. They could never havesurvived public knowledge of a bloodline. A child of Jesus would undermine thecritical notion of Christ's divinity and therefore the Christian Church, whichdeclared itself the sole vessel through which humanity could access the divineand gain entrance to the kingdom of heaven.\"\"The five-petal rose,\" Sophie said, pointing suddenly to the spine of one ofTeabing's books. The same exact design inlaid on the rosewood box.Teabing glanced at Langdon and grinned. \"She has a good eye.\" He turned back toSophie. \"That is the Priory symbol for the Grail. Mary Magdalene. Because hername was forbidden by the Church, Mary Magdalene became secretly known by manypseudonyms—the Chalice, the Holy Grail, and the Rose.\" He paused. \"The Rose hasties to the five-pointed pentacle of Venus and the guiding Compass Rose. By theway, the word rose is identical in English, French, German, and many otherlanguages.\"\"Rose,\" Langdon added, \"is also an anagram of Eros, the Greek god of sexuallove.\"Sophie gave him a surprised look as Teabing plowed on.\"The Rose has always been the premiere symbol of female sexuality. In primitivegoddess cults, the five petals represented the five stations of femalelife—birth, menstruation, motherhood, menopause, and death. And in modern times,the flowering rose's ties to womanhood are considered more visual.\" He glancedat Robert. \"Perhaps the symbologist could explain?\"Robert hesitated. A moment too long.\"Oh, heavens!\" Teabing huffed. \"You Americans are such prudes.\" He looked backat Sophie. \"What Robert is fumbling with is the fact that the blossoming flowerresembles the female genitalia, the sublime blossom from which all mankindenters the world. And if you've ever seen any paintings by Georgia O'Keeffe,you'll know exactly what I mean.\"\"The point here,\" Langdon said, motioning back to the bookshelf, \"is that all ofthese books substantiate the same historical claim.\"\"That Jesus was a father.\" Sophie was still uncertain.\"Yes,\" Teabing said. \"And that Mary Magdalene was the womb that carried Hisroyal lineage. The Priory of Sion, to this day, still worships Mary Magdalene asthe Goddess, the Holy Grail, the Rose, and the Divine Mother.\"Sophie again flashed on the ritual in the basement.\"According to the Priory,\" Teabing continued, \"Mary Magdalene was pregnant atthe time of the crucifixion. For the safety of Christ's unborn child, she had nochoice but to flee the Holy Land. With the help of Jesus' trusted uncle, Josephof Arimathea, Mary Magdalene secretly traveled to France, then known as Gaul.There she found safe refuge in the Jewish community. It was here in France thatshe gave birth to a daughter. Her name was Sarah.\"Sophie glanced up. \"They actually know the child's name?\"\"Far more than that. Magdalene's and Sarah's lives were scrutinously chronicledby their Jewish protectors. Remember that Magdalene's child belonged to thelineage of Jewish kings—David and Solomon. For this reason, the Jews in Franceconsidered Magdalene sacred royalty and revered her as the progenitor of theroyal line of kings. Countless scholars of that era chronicled Mary Magdalene'sdays in France, including the birth of Sarah and the subsequent family tree.\"Sophie was startled. \"There exists a family tree of Jesus Christ?\"\"Indeed. And it is purportedly one of the cornerstones of the Sangrealdocuments. A complete genealogy of the early descendants of Christ.\"\"But what good is a documented genealogy of Christ's bloodline?\" Sophie asked.\"It's not proof. Historians could not possibly confirm its authenticity.\"Teabing chuckled. \"No more so than they can confirm the authenticity of theBible.\"\"Meaning?\"\"Meaning that history is always written by the winners. When two cultures clash,the loser is obliterated, and the winner writes the history books—books whichglorify their own cause and disparage the conquered foe. As Napoleon once said,'What is history, but a fable agreed upon?' \" He smiled. \"By its very nature,history is always a one-sided account.\"Sophie had never thought of it that way.\"The Sangreal documents simply tell the other side of the Christ story. In theend, which side of the story you believe becomes a matter of faith and personalexploration, but at least the information has survived. The Sangreal documentsinclude tens of thousands of pages of information. Eyewitness accounts of theSangreal treasure describe it as being carried in four enormous trunks. In thosetrunks are reputed to be the Purist Documents—thousands of pages of unaltered,pre-Constantine documents, written by the early followers of Jesus, revering Himas a wholly human teacher and prophet. Also rumored to be part of the treasureis the legendary \"Q\" Document—a manuscript that even the Vatican admits theybelieve exists. Allegedly, it is a book of Jesus' teachings, possibly written inHis own hand.\"\"Writings by Christ Himself?\"\"Of course,\" Teabing said. \"Why wouldn't Jesus have kept a chronicle of Hisministry? Most people did in those days. Another explosive document believed tobe in the treasure is a manuscript called The Magdalene Diaries—Mary Magdalene'spersonal account of her relationship with Christ, His crucifixion, and her timein France.\"Sophie was silent for a long moment. \"And these four chests of documents werethe treasure that the Knights Templar found under Solomon's Temple?\"\"Exactly. The documents that made the Knights so powerful. The documents thathave been the object of countless Grail quests throughout history.\"\"But you said the Holy Grail was Mary Magdalene. If people are searching fordocuments, why would you call it a search for the Holy Grail?\"Teabing eyed her, his expression softening. \"Because the hiding place of theHoly Grail includes a sarcophagus.\"Outside, the wind howled in the trees.Teabing spoke more quietly now. \"The quest for the Holy Grail is literally thequest to kneel before the bones of Mary Magdalene. A journey to pray at the feetof the outcast one, the lost sacred feminine.\"Sophie felt an unexpected wonder. \"The hiding place of the Holy Grail isactually... a tomb?\"Teabing's hazel eyes got misty. \"It is. A tomb containing the body of MaryMagdalene and the documents that tell the true story of her life. At its heart,the quest for the Holy Grail has always been a quest for the Magdalene—thewronged Queen, entombed with proof of her family's rightful claim to power.\"Sophie waited a moment as Teabing gathered himself. So much about hergrandfather was still not making sense. \"Members of the Priory,\" she finallysaid, \"all these years have answered the charge of protecting the Sangrealdocuments and the tomb of Mary Magdalene?\"\"Yes, but the brotherhood had another, more important duty as well—to protectthe bloodline itself. Christ's lineage was in perpetual danger. The early Churchfeared that if the lineage were permitted to grow, the secret of Jesus andMagdalene would eventually surface and challenge the fundamental Catholicdoctrine—that of a divine Messiah who did not consort with women or engage insexual union.\" He paused. \"Nonetheless, Christ's line grew quietly under coverin France until making a bold move in the fifth century, when it intermarriedwith French royal blood and created a lineage known as the Merovingianbloodline.\"This news surprised Sophie. Merovingian was a term learned by every student inFrance. \"The Merovingians founded Paris.\"\"Yes. That's one of the reasons the Grail legend is so rich in France. Many ofthe Vatican's Grail quests here were in fact stealth missions to erase membersof the royal bloodline. Have you heard of King Dagobert?\"Sophie vaguely recalled the name from a grisly tale in history class. \"Dagobertwas a Merovingian king, wasn't he? Stabbed in the eye while sleeping?\"\"Exactly. Assassinated by the Vatican in collusion with Pepin d'Heristal. Lateseventh century. With Dagobert's murder, the Merovingian bloodline was almostexterminated. Fortunately, Dagobert's son, Sigisbert, secretly escaped theattack and carried on the lineage, which later included Godefroi deBouillon—founder of the Priory of Sion.\"\"The same man,\" Langdon said, \"who ordered the Knights Templar to recover theSangreal documents from beneath Solomon's Temple and thus provide theMerovingians proof of their hereditary ties to Jesus Christ.\"Teabing nodded, heaving a ponderous sigh. \"The modern Priory of Sion has amomentous duty. Theirs is a threefold charge. The brotherhood must protect theSangreal documents. They must protect the tomb of Mary Magdalene. And, ofcourse, they must nurture and protect the bloodline of Christ—those few membersof the royal Merovingian bloodline who have survived into modern times.\"The words hung in the huge space, and Sophie felt an odd vibration, as if herbones were reverberating with some new kind of truth. Descendants of Jesus whosurvived into modern times. Her grandfather's voice again was whispering in herear. Princess, I must tell you the truth about your family.A chill raked her flesh.Royal blood.She could not imagine.Princess Sophie.\"Sir Leigh?\" The manservant's words crackled through the intercom on the wall,and Sophie jumped. \"If you could join me in the kitchen a moment?\"Teabing scowled at the ill-timed intrusion. He went over to the intercom andpressed the button. \"Rémy, as you know, I am busy with my guests. If we needanything else from the kitchen tonight, we will help ourselves. Thank you andgood night.\"\"A word with you before I retire, sir. If you would.\"Teabing grunted and pressed the button. \"Make it quick, Rémy.\"\"It is a household matter, sir, hardly fare for guests to endure.\"Teabing looked incredulous. \"And it cannot wait until morning?\"\"No, sir. My question won't take a minute.\"Teabing rolled his eyes and looked at Langdon and Sophie. \"Sometimes I wonderwho is serving whom?\" He pressed the button again. \"I'll be right there, Rémy.Can I bring you anything when I come?\"\"Only freedom from oppression, sir.\"\"Rémy, you realize your steak au poivre is the only reason you still work forme.\"\"So you tell me, sir. So you tell me.\" CHAPTER 61Princess Sophie.Sophie felt hollow as she listened to the clicking of Teabing's crutches fadedown the hallway. Numb, she turned and faced Langdon in the deserted ballroom.He was already shaking his head as if reading her mind.\"No, Sophie,\" he whispered, his eyes reassuring. \"The same thought crossed mymind when I realized your grandfather was in the Priory, and you said he wantedto tell you a secret about your family. But it's impossible.\" Langdon paused.\"Saunière is not a Merovingian name.\"Sophie wasn't sure whether to feel relieved or disappointed. Earlier, Langdonhad asked an unusual passing question about Sophie's mother's maiden name.Chauvel. The question now made sense. \"And Chauvel?\" she asked, anxious.Again he shook his head. \"I'm sorry. I know that would have answered somequestions for you. Only two direct lines of Merovingians remain. Their familynames are Plantard and Saint-Clair. Both families live in hiding, probablyprotected by the Priory.\"Sophie repeated the names silently in her mind and then shook her head. Therewas no one in her family named Plantard or Saint-Clair. A weary undertow waspulling at her now. She realized she was no closer than she had been at theLouvre to understanding what truth her grandfather had wanted to reveal to her.Sophie wished her grandfather had never mentioned her family this afternoon. Hehad torn open old wounds that felt as painful now as ever. They are dead,Sophie. They are not coming back. She thought of her mother singing her to sleepat night, of her father giving her rides on his shoulders, and of hergrandmother and younger brother smiling at her with their fervent green eyes.All that was stolen. And all she had left was her grandfather.And now he is gone too. I am alone.Sophie turned quietly back to The Last Supper and gazed at Mary Magdalene's longred hair and quiet eyes. There was something in the woman's expression thatechoed the loss of a loved one. Sophie could feel it too.\"Robert?\" she said softly.He stepped closer.\"I know Leigh said the Grail story is all around us, but tonight is the firsttime I've ever heard any of this.\"Langdon looked as if he wanted to put a comforting hand on her shoulder, but herefrained. \"You've heard her story before, Sophie. Everyone has. We just don'trealize it when we hear it.\"\"I don't understand.\"\"The Grail story is everywhere, but it is hidden. When the Church outlawedspeaking of the shunned Mary Magdalene, her story and importance had to bepassed on through more discreet channels... channels that supported metaphor andsymbolism.\"\"Of course. The arts.\"Langdon motioned to The Last Supper. \"A perfect example. Some of today's mostenduring art, literature, and music secretly tell the history of Mary Magdaleneand Jesus.\"Langdon quickly told her about works by Da Vinci, Botticelli, Poussin, Bernini,Mozart, and Victor Hugo that all whispered of the quest to restore the banishedsacred feminine. Enduring legends like Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, KingArthur, and Sleeping Beauty were Grail allegories. Victor Hugo's Hunchback ofNotre Dame and Mozart's Magic Flute were filled with Masonic symbolism and Grailsecrets.\"Once you open your eyes to the Holy Grail,\" Langdon said, \"you see hereverywhere. Paintings. Music. Books. Even in cartoons, theme parks, and popularmovies.\"Langdon held up his Mickey Mouse watch and told her that Walt Disney had made ithis quiet life's work to pass on the Grail story to future generations.Throughout his entire life, Disney had been hailed as \"the Modern-Day Leonardoda Vinci.\" Both men were generations ahead of their times, uniquely giftedartists, members of secret societies, and, most notably, avid pranksters. LikeLeonardo, Walt Disney loved infusing hidden messages and symbolism in his art.For the trained symbologist, watching an early Disney movie was like beingbarraged by an avalanche of allusion and metaphor.Most of Disney's hidden messages dealt with religion, pagan myth, and stories ofthe subjugated goddess. It was no mistake that Disney retold tales likeCinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White—all of which dealt with theincarceration of the sacred feminine. Nor did one need a background in symbolismto understand that Snow White—a princess who fell from grace after partaking ofa poisoned apple—was a clear allusion to the downfall of Eve in the Garden ofEden. Or that Sleeping Beauty's Princess Aurora—code-named \"Rose\" and hiddendeep in the forest to protect her from the clutches of the evil witch—was theGrail story for children.Despite its corporate image, Disney still had a savvy, playful element among itsemployees, and their artists still amused themselves by inserting hiddensymbolism in Disney products. Langdon would never forget one of his studentsbringing in a DVD of The Lion King and pausing the film to reveal a freeze-framein which the word SEX was clearly visible, spelled out by floating dustparticles over Simba's head. Although Langdon suspected this was more of acartoonist's sophomoric prank than any kind of enlightened allusion to paganhuman sexuality, he had learned not to underestimate Disney's grasp ofsymbolism. The Little Mermaid was a spellbinding tapestry of spiritual symbolsso specifically goddess-related that they could not be coincidence.When Langdon had first seen The Little Mermaid, he had actually gasped aloudwhen he noticed that the painting in Ariel's underwater home was none other thanseventeenth-century artist Georges de la Tour's The Penitent Magdalene—a famoushomage to the banished Mary Magdalene—fitting decor considering the movie turnedout to be a ninety-minute collage of blatant symbolic references to the lostsanctity of Isis, Eve, Pisces the fish goddess, and, repeatedly, Mary Magdalene.The Little Mermaid's name, Ariel, possessed powerful ties to the sacred feminineand, in the Book of Isaiah, was synonymous with \"the Holy City besieged.\" Ofcourse, the Little Mermaid's flowing red hair was certainly no coincidenceeither.The clicking of Teabing's crutches approached in the hallway, his pace unusuallybrisk. When their host entered the study, his expression was stern.\"You'd better explain yourself, Robert,\" he said coldly. \"You have not beenhonest with me.\" CHAPTER 62\"I'm being framed, Leigh,\" Langdon said, trying to stay calm. You know me. Iwouldn't kill anyone.Teabing's tone did not soften. \"Robert, you're on television, for Christ's sake.Did you know you were wanted by the authorities?\"\"Yes.\"\"Then you abused my trust. I'm astonished you would put me at risk by cominghere and asking me to ramble on about the Grail so you could hide out in myhome.\"\"I didn't kill anyone.\"\"Jacques Saunière is dead, and the police say you did it.\" Teabing lookedsaddened. \"Such a contributor to the arts...\"\"Sir?\" The manservant had appeared now, standing behind Teabing in the studydoorway, his arms crossed. \"Shall I show them out?\"\"Allow me.\" Teabing hobbled across the study, unlocked a set of wide glassdoors, and swung them open onto a side lawn. \"Please find your car, and leave.\"Sophie did not move. \"We have information about the clef de voûte. The Priorykeystone.\"Teabing stared at her for several seconds and scoffed derisively. \"A desperateploy. Robert knows how I've sought it.\"\"She's telling the truth,\" Langdon said. \"That's why we came to you tonight. Totalk to you about the keystone.\"The manservant intervened now. \"Leave, or I shall call the authorities.\"\"Leigh,\" Langdon whispered, \"we know where it is.\"Teabing's balance seemed to falter a bit.Rémy now marched stiffly across the room. \"Leave at once! Or I will forcibly—\"\"Rémy!\" Teabing spun, snapping at his servant. \"Excuse us for a moment.\"The servant's jaw dropped. \"Sir? I must protest. These people are—\"\"I'll handle this.\" Teabing pointed to the hallway.After a moment of stunned silence, Rémy skulked out like a banished dog.In the cool night breeze coming through the open doors, Teabing turned back toSophie and Langdon, his expression still wary. \"This better be good. What do youknow of the keystone?\" In the thick brush outside Teabing's study, Silas clutched his pistol and gazedthrough the glass doors. Only moments ago, he had circled the house and seenLangdon and the woman talking in the large study. Before he could move in, a manon crutches entered, yelled at Langdon, threw open the doors, and demanded hisguests leave. Then the woman mentioned the keystone, and everything changed.Shouts turned to whispers. Moods softened. And the glass doors were quicklyclosed.Now, as he huddled in the shadows, Silas peered through the glass. The keystoneis somewhere inside the house. Silas could feel it.Staying in the shadows, he inched closer to the glass, eager to hear what wasbeing said. He would give them five minutes. If they did not reveal where theyhad placed the keystone, Silas would have to enter and persuade them with force. Inside the study, Langdon could sense their host's bewilderment.\"Grand Master?\" Teabing choked, eyeing Sophie. \"Jacques Saunière?\"Sophie nodded, seeing the shock in his eyes.\"But you could not possibly know that!\"\"Jacques Saunière was my grandfather.\"Teabing staggered back on his crutches, shooting a glance at Langdon, whonodded. Teabing turned back to Sophie. \"Miss Neveu, I am speechless. If this istrue, then I am truly sorry for your loss. I should admit, for my research, Ihave kept lists of men in Paris whom I thought might be good candidates forinvolvement in the Priory. Jacques Saunière was on that list along with manyothers. But Grand Master, you say? It's hard to fathom.\" Teabing was silent amoment and then shook his head. \"But it still makes no sense. Even if yourgrandfather were the Priory Grand Master and created the keystone himself, hewould never tell you how to find it. The keystone reveals the pathway to thebrotherhood's ultimate treasure. Granddaughter or not, you are not eligible toreceive such knowledge.\"\"Mr. Saunière was dying when he passed on the information,\" Langdon said. \"Hehad limited options.\"\"He didn't need options,\" Teabing argued. \"There exist three sénéchaux who alsoknow the secret. That is the beauty of their system. One will rise to GrandMaster and they will induct a new sénéchal and share the secret of thekeystone.\"\"I guess you didn't see the entire news broadcast,\" Sophie said. \"In addition tomy grandfather, three other prominent Parisians were murdered today. All insimilar ways. All looked like they had been interrogated.\"Teabing's jaw fell. \"And you think they were...\"\"The sénéchaux,\" Langdon said.\"But how? A murderer could not possibly learn the identities of all four topmembers of the Priory of Sion! Look at me, I have been researching them fordecades, and I can't even name one Priory member. It seems inconceivable thatall three sénéchaux and the Grand Master could be discovered and killed in oneday.\"\"I doubt the information was gathered in a single day,\" Sophie said. \"It soundslike a well-planned décapiter. It's a technique we use to fight organized crimesyndicates. If DCPJ wants to move on a certain group, they will silently listenand watch for months, identify all the main players, and then move in and takethem all at the same moment. Decapitation. With no leadership, the group fallsinto chaos and divulges other information. It's possible someone patientlywatched the Priory and then attacked, hoping the top people would reveal thelocation of the keystone.\"Teabing looked unconvinced. \"But the brothers would never talk. They are swornto secrecy. Even in the face of death.\"\"Exactly,\" Langdon said. \"Meaning, if they never divulged the secret, and theywere killed...\"Teabing gasped. \"Then the location of the keystone would be lost forever!\"\"And with it,\" Langdon said, \"the location of the Holy Grail.\"Teabing's body seemed to sway with the weight of Langdon's words. Then, as iftoo tired to stand another moment, he flopped in a chair and stared out thewindow.Sophie walked over, her voice soft. \"Considering my grandfather's predicament,it seems possible that in total desperation he tried to pass the secret on tosomeone outside the brotherhood. Someone he thought he could trust. Someone inhis family.\"Teabing was pale. \"But someone capable of such an attack... of discovering somuch about the brotherhood...\" He paused, radiating a new fear. \"It could onlybe one force. This kind of infiltration could only have come from the Priory'soldest enemy.\"Langdon glanced up. \"The Church.\"\"Who else? Rome has been seeking the Grail for centuries.\"Sophie was skeptical. \"You think the Church killed my grandfather?\"Teabing replied, \"It would not be the first time in history the Church haskilled to protect itself. The documents that accompany the Holy Grail areexplosive, and the Church has wanted to destroy them for years.\"Langdon was having trouble buying Teabing's premise that the Church wouldblatantly murder people to obtain these documents. Having met the new Pope andmany of the cardinals, Langdon knew they were deeply spiritual men who wouldnever condone assassination. Regardless of the stakes.Sophie seemed to be having similar thoughts. \"Isn't it possible that thesePriory members were murdered by someone outside the Church? Someone who didn'tunderstand what the Grail really is? The Cup of Christ, after all, would bequite an enticing treasure. Certainly treasure hunters have killed for less.\"\"In my experience,\" Teabing said, \"men go to far greater lengths to avoid whatthey fear than to obtain what they desire. I sense a desperation in this assaulton the Priory.\"\"Leigh,\" Langdon said, \"the argument is paradoxical. Why would members of theCatholic clergy murder Priory members in an effort to find and destroy documentsthey believe are false testimony anyway?\"Teabing chuckled. \"The ivory towers of Harvard have made you soft, Robert. Yes,the clergy in Rome are blessed with potent faith, and because of this, theirbeliefs can weather any storm, including documents that contradict everythingthey hold dear. But what about the rest of the world? What about those who arenot blessed with absolute certainty? What about those who look at the cruelty inthe world and say, where is God today? Those who look at Church scandals andask, who are these men who claim to speak the truth about Christ and yet lie tocover up the sexual abuse of children by their own priests?\" Teabing paused.\"What happens to those people, Robert, if persuasive scientific evidence comesout that the Church's version of the Christ story is inaccurate, and that thegreatest story ever told is, in fact, the greatest story ever sold\"Langdon did not respond.\"I'll tell you what happens if the documents get out,\" Teabing said. \"TheVatican faces a crisis of faith unprecedented in its two-millennia history.\"After a long silence, Sophie said, \"But if it is the Church who is responsiblefor this attack, why would they act now? After all these years? The Priory keepsthe Sangreal documents hidden. They pose no immediate threat to the Church.\"Teabing heaved an ominous sigh and glanced at Langdon. \"Robert, I assume you arefamiliar with the Priory's final charge?\"Langdon felt his breath catch at the thought. \"I am.\"\"Miss Neveu,\" Teabing said, \"the Church and the Priory have had a tacitunderstanding for years. That is, the Church does not attack the Priory, and thePriory keeps the Sangreal documents hidden.\" He paused. \"However, part of thePriory history has always included a plan to unveil the secret. With the arrivalof a specific date in history, the brotherhood plans to break the silence andcarry out its ultimate triumph by unveiling the Sangreal documents to the worldand shouting the true story of Jesus Christ from the mountaintops.\"Sophie stared at Teabing in silence. Finally, she too sat down. \"And you thinkthat date is approaching? And the Church knows it?\"\"A speculation,\" Teabing said, \"but it would certainly provide the Churchmotivation for an all-out attack to find the documents before it was too late.\"Langdon had the uneasy feeling that Teabing was making good sense. \"Do you thinkthe Church would actually be capable of uncovering hard evidence of the Priory'sdate?\"\"Why not—if we're assuming the Church was able to uncover the identities of thePriory members, then certainly they could have learned of their plans. And evenif they don't have the exact date, their superstitions may be getting the bestof them.\"\"Superstitions?\" Sophie asked.\"In terms of prophecy,\" Teabing said, \"we are currently in an epoch of enormouschange. The millennium has recently passed, and with it has ended thetwo-thousand-year-long astrological Age of Pisces—the fish, which is also thesign of Jesus. As any astrological symbologist will tell you, the Piscean idealbelieves that man must be told what to do by higher powers because man isincapable of thinking for himself. Hence it has been a time of fervent religion.Now, however, we are entering the Age of Aquarius—the water bearer—whose idealsclaim that man will learn the truth and be able to think for himself. Theideological shift is enormous, and it is occurring right now.\"Langdon felt a shiver. Astrological prophecy never held much interest orcredibility for him, but he knew there were those in the Church who followed itvery closely. \"The Church calls this transitional period the End of Days.\"Sophie looked skeptical. \"As in the end of the world? The Apocalypse?\"\"No.\" Langdon replied. \"That's a common misconception. Many religions speak ofthe End of Days. It refers not to the end of the world, but rather the end ofour current age—Pisces, which began at the time of Christ's birth, spanned twothousand years, and waned with the passing of the millennium. Now that we'vepassed into the Age of Aquarius, the End of Days has arrived.\"\"Many Grail historians,\" Teabing added, \"believe that if the Priory is indeedplanning to release this truth, this point in history would be a symbolicallyapt time. Most Priory academics, myself included, anticipated the brotherhood'srelease would coincide precisely with the millennium. Obviously, it did not.Admittedly, the Roman calendar does not mesh perfectly with astrologicalmarkers, so there is some gray area in the prediction. Whether the Church nowhas inside information that an exact date is looming, or whether they are justgetting nervous on account of astrological prophecy, I don't know. Anyway, it'simmaterial. Either scenario explains how the Church might be motivated to launcha preemptive attack against the Priory.\" Teabing frowned. \"And believe me, ifthe Church finds the Holy Grail, they will destroy it. The documents and therelics of the blessed Mary Magdalene as well.\" His eyes grew heavy. \"Then, mydear, with the Sangreal documents gone, all evidence will be lost. The Churchwill have won their age-old war to rewrite history. The past will be erasedforever.\"Slowly, Sophie pulled the cruciform key from her sweater pocket and held it outto Teabing.Teabing took the key and studied it. \"My goodness. The Priory seal. Where didyou get this?\"\"My grandfather gave it to me tonight before he died.\"Teabing ran his fingers across the cruciform. \"A key to a church?\"She drew a deep breath. \"This key provides access to the keystone.\"Teabing's head snapped up, his face wild with disbelief. \"Impossible! Whatchurch did I miss? I've searched every church in France!\"\"It's not in a church,\" Sophie said. \"It's in a Swiss depository bank.\"Teabing's look of excitement waned. \"The keystone is in a bank?\"\"A vault,\" Langdon offered.\"A bank vault?\" Teabing shook his head violently. \"That's impossible. Thekeystone is supposed to be hidden beneath the sign of the Rose.\"\"It is,\" Langdon said. \"It was stored in a rosewood box inlaid with a five-petalRose.\"Teabing looked thunderstruck. \"You've seen the keystone?\"Sophie nodded. \"We visited the bank.\"Teabing came over to them, his eyes wild with fear. \"My friends, we must dosomething. The keystone is in danger! We have a duty to protect it. What ifthere are other keys? Perhaps stolen from the murdered sénéchaux? If the Churchcan gain access to the bank as you have—\"\"Then they will be too late,\" Sophie said. \"We removed the keystone.\"\"What! You removed the keystone from its hiding place?\"\"Don't worry,\" Langdon said. \"The keystone is well hidden.\"\"Extremely well hidden, I hope!\"\"Actually,\" Langdon said, unable to hide his grin, \"that depends on how oftenyou dust under your couch.\" The wind outside Château Villette had picked up, and Silas's robe danced in thebreeze as he crouched near the window. Although he had been unable to hear muchof the conversation, the word keystone had sifted through the glass on numerousoccasions.It is inside.The Teacher's words were fresh in his mind. Enter Château Villette. Take thekeystone. Hun no one.Now, Langdon and the others had adjourned suddenly to another room,extinguishing the study lights as they went. Feeling like a panther stalkingprey, Silas crept to the glass doors. Finding them unlocked, he slipped insideand closed the doors silently behind him. He could hear muffled voices fromanother room. Silas pulled the pistol from his pocket, turned off the safety,and inched down the hallway. CHAPTER 63Lieutenant Collet stood alone at the foot of Leigh Teabing's driveway and gazedup at the massive house. Isolated. Dark. Good ground cover. Collet watched hishalf-dozen agents spreading silently out along the length of the fence. Theycould be over it and have the house surrounded in a matter of minutes. Langdoncould not have chosen a more ideal spot for Collet's men to make a surpriseassault.Collet was about to call Fache himself when at last his phone rang.Fache sounded not nearly as pleased with the developments as Collet would haveimagined. \"Why didn't someone tell me we had a lead on Langdon?\"\"You were on a phone call and—\"\"Where exactly are you, Lieutenant Collet?\"Collet gave him the address. \"The estate belongs to a British national namedTeabing. Langdon drove a fair distance to get here, and the vehicle is insidethe security gate, with no signs of forced entry, so chances are good thatLangdon knows the occupant.\"\"I'm coming out,\" Fache said. \"Don't make a move. I'll handle this personally.\"Collet's jaw dropped. \"But Captain, you're twenty minutes away! We should actimmediately. I have him staked out. I'm with eight men total. Four of us havefield rifles and the others have sidearms.\"\"Wait for me.\"\"Captain, what if Langdon has a hostage in there? What if he sees us and decidesto leave on foot? We need to move now! My men are in position and ready to go.\"\"Lieutenant Collet, you will wait for me to arrive before taking action. That isan order.\" Fache hung up.Stunned, Lieutenant Collet switched off his phone. Why the hell is Fache askingme to wait? Collet knew the answer. Fache, though famous for his instinct, wasnotorious for his pride. Fache wants credit for the arrest. After putting theAmerican's face all over the television, Fache wanted to be sure his own facegot equal time. Collet's job was simply to hold down the fort until the bossshowed up to save the day.As he stood there, Collet flashed on a second possible explanation for thisdelay. Damage control. In law enforcement, hesitating to arrest a fugitive onlyoccurred when uncertainty had arisen regarding the suspect's guilt. Is Fachehaving second thoughts that Langdon is the right man? The thought wasfrightening. Captain Fache had gone out on a limb tonight to arrest RobertLangdon—surveillance cachée, Interpol, and now television. Not even the greatBezu Fache would survive the political fallout if he had mistakenly splashed aprominent American's face all over French television, claiming he was amurderer. If Fache now realized he'd made a mistake, then it made perfect sensethat he would tell Collet not to make a move. The last thing Fache needed wasfor Collet to storm an innocent Brit's private estate and take Langdon atgunpoint.Moreover, Collet realized, if Langdon were innocent, it explained one of thiscase's strangest paradoxes: Why had Sophie Neveu, the granddaughter of thevictim, helped the alleged killer escape? Unless Sophie knew Langdon was falselycharged. Fache had posited all kinds of explanations tonight to explain Sophie'sodd behavior, including that Sophie, as Saunière's sole heir, had persuaded hersecret lover Robert Langdon to kill off Saunière for the inheritance money.Saunière, if he had suspected this, might have left the police the message P.S.Find Robert Langdon. Collet was fairly certain something else was going on here.Sophie Neveu seemed far too solid of character to be mixed up in something thatsordid.\"Lieutenant?\" One of the field agents came running over. \"We found a car.\"Collet followed the agent about fifty yards past the driveway. The agent pointedto a wide shoulder on the opposite side of the road. There, parked in the brush,almost out of sight, was a black Audi. It had rental plates. Collet felt thehood. Still warm. Hot even.\"That must be how Langdon got here,\" Collet said. \"Call the rental company. Findout if it's stolen.\"\"Yes, sir.\"Another agent waved Collet back over in the direction of the fence. \"Lieutenant,have a look at this.\" He handed Collet a pair of night vision binoculars. \"Thegrove of trees near the top of the driveway.\"Collet aimed the binoculars up the hill and adjusted the image intensifierdials. Slowly, the greenish shapes came into focus. He located the curve of thedriveway and slowly followed it up, reaching the grove of trees. All he could dowas stare. There, shrouded in the greenery, was an armored truck. A truckidentical to the one Collet had permitted to leave the Depository Bank of Zurichearlier tonight. He prayed this was some kind of bizarre coincidence, but heknew it could not be.\"It seems obvious,\" the agent said, \"that this truck is how Langdon and Neveugot away from the bank.\"Collet was speechless. He thought of the armored truck driver he had stopped atthe roadblock. The Rolex. His impatience to leave. I never checked the cargohold.Incredulous, Collet realized that someone in the bank had actually lied to DCPJabout Langdon and Sophie's whereabouts and then helped them escape. But who? Andwhy? Collet wondered if maybe this were the reason Fache had told him not totake action yet. Maybe Fache realized there were more people involved tonightthan just Langdon and Sophie. And if Langdon and Neveu arrived in the armoredtruck, then who drove the Audi? Hundreds of miles to the south, a chartered Beechcraft Baron 58 raced northwardover the Tyrrhenian Sea. Despite calm skies, Bishop Aringarosa clutched anairsickness bag, certain he could be ill at any moment. His conversation withParis had not at all been what he had imagined.Alone in the small cabin, Aringarosa twisted the gold ring on his finger andtried to ease his overwhelming sense of fear and desperation. Everything inParis has gone terribly wrong. Closing his eyes, Aringarosa said a prayer thatBezu Fache would have the means to fix it. CHAPTER 64Teabing sat on the divan, cradling the wooden box on his lap and admiring thelid's intricate inlaid Rose. Tonight has become the strangest and most magicalnight of my life.\"Lift the lid,\" Sophie whispered, standing over him, beside Langdon.Teabing smiled. Do not rush me. Having spent over a decade searching for thiskeystone, he wanted to savor every millisecond of this moment. He ran a palmacross the wooden lid, feeling the texture of the inlaid flower.\"The Rose,\" he whispered. The Rose is Magdalene is the Holy Grail. The Rose isthe compass that guides the way. Teabing felt foolish. For years he had traveledto cathedrals and churches all over France, paying for special access, examininghundreds of archways beneath rose windows, searching for an encrypted keystone.La clef de voûte—a stone key beneath the sign of the Rose.Teabing slowly unlatched the lid and raised it.As his eyes finally gazed upon the contents, he knew in an instant it could onlybe the keystone. He was staring at a stone cylinder, crafted of interconnectinglettered dials. The device seemed surprisingly familiar to him.\"Designed from Da Vinci's diaries,\" Sophie said. \"My grandfather made them as ahobby.\"Of course, Teabing realized. He had seen the sketches and blueprints. The key tofinding the Holy Grail lies inside this stone. Teabing lifted the heavy cryptexfrom the box, holding it gently. Although he had no idea how to open thecylinder, he sensed his own destiny lay inside. In moments of failure, Teabinghad questioned whether his life's quest would ever be rewarded. Now those doubtswere gone forever. He could hear the ancient words... the foundation of theGrail legend:Vous ne trouvez pas le Saint-Graal, c'est le Saint-Graal qui vous trouve.You do not find the Grail, the Grail finds you.And tonight, incredibly, the key to finding the Holy Grail had walked rightthrough his front door. While Sophie and Teabing sat with the cryptex and talked about the vinegar, thedials, and what the password might be, Langdon carried the rosewood box acrossthe room to a well-lit table to get a better look at it. Something Teabing hadjust said was now running through Langdon's mind.The key to the Grail is hidden beneath the sign of the Rose.Langdon held the wooden box up to the light and examined the inlaid symbol ofthe Rose. Although his familiarity with art did not include woodworking orinlaid furniture, he had just recalled the famous tiled ceiling of the Spanishmonastery outside of Madrid, where, three centuries after its construction, theceiling tiles began to fall out, revealing sacred texts scrawled by monks on theplaster beneath.Langdon looked again at the Rose.Beneath the Rose.Sub Rosa.Secret.A bump in the hallway behind him made Langdon turn. He saw nothing but shadows.Teabing's manservant most likely had passed through. Langdon turned back to thebox. He ran his finger over the smooth edge of the inlay, wondering if he couldpry the Rose out, but the craftsmanship was perfect. He doubted even a razorblade could fit in between the inlaid Rose and the carefully carved depressioninto which it was seated.Opening the box, he examined the inside of the lid. It was smooth. As he shiftedits position, though, the light caught what appeared to be a small hole on theunderside of the lid, positioned in the exact center. Langdon closed the lid andexamined the inlaid symbol from the top. No hole.It doesn't pass through.Setting the box on the table, he looked around the room and spied a stack ofpapers with a paper clip on it. Borrowing the clip, he returned to the box,opened it, and studied the hole again. Carefully, he unbent the paper clip andinserted one end into the hole. He gave a gentle push. It took almost no effort.He heard something clatter quietly onto the table. Langdon closed the lid tolook. It was a small piece of wood, like a puzzle piece. The wooden Rose hadpopped out of the lid and fallen onto the desk.Speechless, Langdon stared at the bare spot on the lid where the Rose had been.There, engraved in the wood, written in an immaculate hand, were four lines oftext in a language he had never seen.The characters look vaguely Semitic, Langdon thought to himself, and yet I don'trecognize the language!A sudden movement behind him caught his attention. Out of nowhere, a crushingblow to the head knocked Langdon to his knees.As he fell, he thought for a moment he saw a pale ghost hovering over him,clutching a gun. Then everything went black. CHAPTER 65Sophie Neveu, despite working in law enforcement, had never found herself atgunpoint until tonight. Almost inconceivably, the gun into which she was nowstaring was clutched in the pale hand of an enormous albino with long whitehair. He looked at her with red eyes that radiated a frightening, disembodiedquality. Dressed in a wool robe with a rope tie, he resembled a medieval cleric.Sophie could not imagine who he was, and yet she was feeling a sudden newfoundrespect for Teabing's suspicions that the Church was behind this.\"You know what I have come for,\" the monk said, his voice hollow.Sophie and Teabing were seated on the divan, arms raised as their attacker hadcommanded. Langdon lay groaning on the floor. The monk's eyes fell immediatelyto the keystone on Teabing's lap.Teabing's tone was defiant. \"You will not be able to open it.\"\"My Teacher is very wise,\" the monk replied, inching closer, the gun shiftingbetween Teabing and Sophie.Sophie wondered where Teabing's manservant was. Didn't he hear Robert fall?\"Who is your teacher?\" Teabing asked. \"Perhaps we can make a financialarrangement.\"\"The Grail is priceless.\" He moved closer.\"You're bleeding,\" Teabing noted calmly, nodding to the monk's right ankle wherea trickle of blood had run down his leg. \"And you're limping.\"\"As do you,\" the monk replied, motioning to the metal crutches propped besideTeabing. \"Now, hand me the keystone.\"\"You know of the keystone?\" Teabing said, sounding surprised.\"Never mind what I know. Stand up slowly, and give it to me.\"\"Standing is difficult for me.\"\"Precisely. I would prefer nobody attempt any quick moves.\"Teabing slipped his right hand through one of his crutches and grasped thekeystone in his left. Lurching to his feet, he stood erect, palming the heavycylinder in his left hand, and leaning unsteadily on his crutch with his right.The monk closed to within a few feet, keeping the gun aimed directly atTeabing's head. Sophie watched, feeling helpless as the monk reached out to takethe cylinder.\"You will not succeed,\" Teabing said. \"Only the worthy can unlock this stone.\" God alone judges the worthy, Silas thought.\"It's quite heavy,\" the man on crutches said, his arm wavering now. \"If youdon't take it soon, I'm afraid I shall drop it!\" He swayed perilously.Silas stepped quickly forward to take the stone, and as he did, the man oncrutches lost his balance. The crutch slid out from under him, and he began totopple sideways to his right. No! Silas lunged to save the stone, lowering hisweapon in the process. But the keystone was moving away from him now. As the manfell to his right, his left hand swung backward, and the cylinder tumbled fromhis palm onto the couch. At the same instant, the metal crutch that had beensliding out from under the man seemed to accelerate, cutting a wide arc throughthe air toward Silas's leg.Splinters of pain tore up Silas's body as the crutch made perfect contact withhis cilice, crushing the barbs into his already raw flesh. Buckling, Silascrumpled to his knees, causing the belt to cut deeper still. The pistoldischarged with a deafening roar, the bullet burying itself harmlessly in thefloorboards as Silas fell. Before he could raise the gun and fire again, thewoman's foot caught him square beneath the jaw. At the bottom of the driveway, Collet heard the gunshot. The muffled pop sentpanic through his veins. With Fache on the way, Collet had already relinquishedany hopes of claiming personal credit for finding Langdon tonight. But Colletwould be damned if Fache's ego landed him in front of a Ministerial Review Boardfor negligent police procedure.A weapon was discharged inside a private home! And you waited at the bottom ofthe driveway?Collet knew the opportunity for a stealth approach had long since passed. Healso knew if he stood idly by for another second, his entire career would behistory by morning. Eyeing the estate's iron gate, he made his decision.\"Tie on, and pull it down.\" In the distant recesses of his groggy mind, Robert Langdon had heard thegunshot. He'd also heard a scream of pain. His own? A jackhammer was boring ahole into the back of his cranium. Somewhere nearby, people were talking.\"Where the devil were you?\" Teabing was yelling.The manservant hurried in. \"What happened? Oh my God! Who is that? I'll call thepolice!\"\"Bloody hell! Don't call the police. Make yourself useful and get us somethingwith which to restrain this monster.\"\"And some ice!\" Sophie called after him.Langdon drifted out again. More voices. Movement. Now he was seated on thedivan. Sophie was holding an ice pack to his head. His skull ached. As Langdon'svision finally began to clear, he found himself staring at a body on the floor.Am I hallucinating? The massive body of an albino monk lay bound and gagged withduct tape. His chin was split open, and the robe over his right thigh was soakedwith blood. He too appeared to be just now coming to.Langdon turned to Sophie. \"Who is that? What... happened?\"Teabing hobbled over. \"You were rescued by a knight brandishing an Excaliburmade by Acme Orthopedic.\"Huh? Langdon tried to sit up.Sophie's touch was shaken but tender. \"Just give yourself a minute, Robert.\"\"I fear,\" Teabing said, \"that I've just demonstrated for your lady friend theunfortunate benefit of my condition. It seems everyone underestimates you.\"From his seat on the divan, Langdon gazed down at the monk and tried to imaginewhat had happened.\"He was wearing a cilice,\" Teabing explained.\"A what?\"Teabing pointed to a bloody strip of barbed leather that lay on the floor. \"ADiscipline belt. He wore it on his thigh. I took careful aim.\"Langdon rubbed his head. He knew of Discipline belts. \"But how... did you know?\"Teabing grinned. \"Christianity is my field of study, Robert, and there arecertain sects who wear their hearts on their sleeves.\" He pointed his crutch atthe blood soaking through the monk's cloak. \"As it were.\"\"Opus Dei,\" Langdon whispered, recalling recent media coverage of severalprominent Boston businessmen who were members of Opus Dei. Apprehensivecoworkers had falsely and publicly accused the men of wearing Discipline beltsbeneath their three-piece suits. In fact, the three men did no such thing. Likemany members of Opus Dei, these businessmen were at the \"supernumerary\" stageand practiced no corporal mortification at all. They were devout Catholics,caring fathers to their children, and deeply dedicated members of the community.Not surprisingly, the media spotlighted their spiritual commitment only brieflybefore moving on to the shock value of the sect's more stringent \"numerary\"members... members like the monk now lying on the floor before Langdon.Teabing was looking closely at the bloody belt. \"But why would Opus Dei betrying to find the Holy Grail?\"Langdon was too groggy to consider it.\"Robert,\" Sophie said, walking to the wooden box. \"What's this?\" She was holdingthe small Rose inlay he had removed from the lid.\"It covered an engraving on the box. I think the text might tell us how to openthe keystone.\"Before Sophie and Teabing could respond, a sea of blue police lights and sirenserupted at the bottom of the hill and began snaking up the half-mile driveway.Teabing frowned. \"My friends, it seems we have a decision to make. And we'dbetter make it fast.\" CHAPTER 66Collet and his agents burst through the front door of Sir Leigh Teabing's estatewith their guns drawn. Fanning out, they began searching all the rooms on thefirst level. They found a bullet hole in the drawing room floor, signs of astruggle, a small amount of blood, a strange, barbed leather belt, and apartially used roll of duct tape. The entire level seemed deserted.Just as Collet was about to divide his men to search the basement and groundsbehind the house, he heard voices on the level above them.\"They're upstairs!\"Rushing up the wide staircase, Collet and his men moved room by room through thehuge home, securing darkened bedrooms and hallways as they closed in on thesounds of voices. The sound seemed to be coming from the last bedroom on anexceptionally long hallway. The agents inched down the corridor, sealing offalternate exits.As they neared the final bedroom, Collet could see the door was wide open. Thevoices had stopped suddenly, and had been replaced by an odd rumbling, like anengine.Sidearm raised, Collet gave the signal. Reaching silently around the door frame,he found the light switch and flicked it on. Spinning into the room with menpouring in after him, Collet shouted and aimed his weapon at... nothing.An empty guest bedroom. Pristine.The rumbling sounds of an automobile engine poured from a black electronic panelon the wall beside the bed. Collet had seen these elsewhere in the house. Somekind of intercom system. He raced over. The panel had about a dozen labeledbuttons: STUDY... KITCHEN... LAUNDRY... CELLAR... So where the hell do I hear a car? MASTER BEDROOM... SUN ROOM... BARN... LIBRARY... Barn! Collet was downstairs in seconds, running toward the back door, grabbingone of his agents on the way. The men crossed the rear lawn and arrivedbreathless at the front of a weathered gray barn. Even before they entered,Collet could hear the fading sounds of a car engine. He drew his weapon, rushedin, and flicked on the lights.The right side of the barn was a rudimentary workshop—lawn-mowers, automotivetools, gardening supplies. A familiar intercom panel hung on the wall nearby.One of its buttons was flipped down, transmitting. GUEST BEDROOM II. Collet wheeled, anger brimming. They lured us upstairs with the intercom!Searching the other side of the barn, he found a long line of horse stalls. Nohorses. Apparently the owner preferred a different kind of horsepower; thestalls had been converted into an impressive automotive parking facility. Thecollection was astonishing—a black Ferrari, a pristine Rolls-Royce, an antiqueAstin Martin sports coupe, a vintage Porsche 356.The last stall was empty.Collet ran over and saw oil stains on the stall floor. They can't get off thecompound. The driveway and gate were barricaded with two patrol cars to preventthis very situation.\"Sir?\" The agent pointed down the length of the stalls.The barn's rear slider was wide open, giving way to a dark, muddy slope ofrugged fields that stretched out into the night behind the barn. Collet ran tothe door, trying to see out into the darkness. All he could make out was thefaint shadow of a forest in the distance. No headlights. This wooded valley wasprobably crisscrossed by dozens of unmapped fire roads and hunting trails, butCollet was confident his quarry would never make the woods. \"Get some men spreadout down there. They're probably already stuck somewhere nearby. These fancysports cars can't handle terrain.\"\"Um, sir?\" The agent pointed to a nearby pegboard on which hung several sets ofkeys. The labels above the keys bore familiar names. DAIMLER... ROLLS-ROYCE... ASTIN MARTIN... PORSCHE... The last peg was empty.When Collet read the label above the empty peg, he knew he was in trouble. CHAPTER 67The Range Rover was Java Black Pearl, four-wheel drive, standard transmission,with high-strength polypropylene lamps, rear light cluster fittings, and thesteering wheel on the right.Langdon was pleased he was not driving.Teabing's manservant Rémy, on orders from his master, was doing an impressivejob of maneuvering the vehicle across the moonlit fields behind ChâteauVillette. With no headlights, he had crossed an open knoll and was nowdescending a long slope, moving farther away from the estate. He seemed to beheading toward a jagged silhouette of wooded land in the distance.Langdon, cradling the keystone, turned in the passenger seat and eyed Teabingand Sophie in the back seat.\"How's your head, Robert?\" Sophie asked, sounding concerned.Langdon forced a pained smile. \"Better, thanks.\" It was killing him.Beside her, Teabing glanced over his shoulder at the bound and gagged monk lyingin the cramped luggage area behind the back seat. Teabing had the monk's gun onhis lap and looked like an old photo of a British safari chap posing over hiskill.\"So glad you popped in this evening, Robert,\" Teabing said, grinning as if hewere having fun for the first time in years.\"Sorry to get you involved in this, Leigh.\"\"Oh, please, I've waited my entire life to be involved.\" Teabing looked pastLangdon out the windshield at the shadow of a long hedgerow. He tapped Rémy onthe shoulder from behind. \"Remember, no brake lights. Use the emergency brake ifyou need it. I want to get into the woods a bit. No reason to risk them seeingus from the house.\"Rémy coasted to a crawl and guided the Range Rover through an opening in thehedge. As the vehicle lurched onto an overgrown pathway, almost immediately thetrees overhead blotted out the moonlight.I can't see a thing, Langdon thought, straining to distinguish any shapes at allin front of them. It was pitch black. Branches rubbed against the left side ofthe vehicle, and Rémy corrected in the other direction. Keeping the wheel moreor less straight now, he inched ahead about thirty yards.\"You're doing beautifully, Rémy,\" Teabing said. \"That should be far enough.Robert, if you could press that little blue button just below the vent there.See it?\"Langdon found the button and pressed it.A muted yellow glow fanned out across the path in front of them, revealing thickunderbrush on either side of the pathway. Fog lights, Langdon realized. Theygave off just enough light to keep them on the path, and yet they were deepenough into the woods now that the lights would not give them away.\"Well, Rémy,\" Teabing chimed happily. \"The lights are on. Our lives are in yourhands.\"\"Where are we going?\" Sophie asked.\"This trail continues about three kilometers into the forest,\" Teabing said.\"Cutting across the estate and then arching north. Provided we don't hit anystanding water or fallen trees, we shall emerge unscathed on the shoulder ofhighway five.\"Unscathed. Langdon's head begged to differ. He turned his eyes down to his ownlap, where the keystone was safely stowed in its wooden box. The inlaid Rose onthe lid was back in place, and although his head felt muddled, Langdon was eagerto remove the inlay again and examine the engraving beneath more closely. Heunlatched the lid and began to raise it when Teabing laid a hand on his shoulderfrom behind.\"Patience, Robert,\" Teabing said. \"It's bumpy and dark. God save us if we breakanything. If you didn't recognize the language in the light, you won't do anybetter in the dark. Let's focus on getting away in one piece, shall we? Therewill be time for that very soon.\"Langdon knew Teabing was right. With a nod, he relatched the box.The monk in back was moaning now, struggling against his trusses. Suddenly, hebegan kicking wildly.Teabing spun around and aimed the pistol over the seat. \"I can't imagine yourcomplaint, sir. You trespassed in my home and planted a nasty welt on the skullof a dear friend. I would be well within my rights to shoot you right now andleave you to rot in the woods.\"The monk fell silent.\"Are you sure we should have brought him?\" Langdon asked.\"Bloody well positive!\" Teabing exclaimed. \"You're wanted for murder, Robert.This scoundrel is your ticket to freedom. The police apparently want you badlyenough to have tailed you to my home.\"\"My fault,\" Sophie said. \"The armored car probably had a transmitter.\"\"Not the point,\" Teabing said. \"I'm not surprised the police found you, but I amsurprised that this Opus Dei character found you. From all you've told me, Ican't imagine how this man could have tailed you to my home unless he had acontact either within the Judicial Police or within the Zurich Depository.\"Langdon considered it. Bezu Fache certainly seemed intent on finding a scapegoatfor tonight's murders. And Vernet had turned on them rather suddenly, althoughconsidering Langdon was being charged with four murders, the banker's change ofheart seemed understandable.\"This monk is not working alone, Robert,\" Teabing said, \"and until you learn whois behind all this, you both are in danger. The good news, my friend, is thatyou are now in the position of power. This monster behind me holds thatinformation, and whoever is pulling his strings has got to be quite nervousright now.\"Rémy was picking up speed, getting comfortable with the trail. They splashedthrough some water, climbed a small rise, and began descending again.\"Robert, could you be so kind as to hand me that phone?\" Teabing pointed to thecar phone on the dash. Langdon handed it back, and Teabing dialed a number. Hewaited for a very long time before someone answered. \"Richard? Did I wake you?Of course, I did. Silly question. I'm sorry. I have a small problem. I'm feelinga bit off. Rémy and I need to pop up to the Isles for my treatments. Well, rightaway, actually. Sorry for the short notice. Can you have Elizabeth ready inabout twenty minutes? I know, do the best you can. See you shortly.\" He hung up.\"Elizabeth?\" Langdon said.\"My plane. She cost me a Queen's ransom.\"Langdon turned full around and looked at him.\"What?\" Teabing demanded. \"You two can't expect to stay in France with theentire Judicial Police after you. London will be much safer.\"Sophie had turned to Teabing as well. \"You think we should leave the country?\"\"My friends, I am far more influential in the civilized world than here inFrance. Furthermore, the Grail is believed to be in Great Britain. If we unlockthe keystone, I am certain we will discover a map that indicates we have movedin the proper direction.\"\"You're running a big risk,\" Sophie said, \"by helping us. You won't make anyfriends with the French police.\"Teabing gave a wave of disgust. \"I am finished with France. I moved here to findthe keystone. That work is now done. I shan't care if I ever again see ChâteauVillette.\"Sophie sounded uncertain. \"How will we get through airport security?\"Teabing chuckled. \"I fly from Le Bourget—an executive airfield not far fromhere. French doctors make me nervous, so every fortnight, I fly north to take mytreatments in England. I pay for certain special privileges at both ends. Oncewe're airborne, you can make a decision as to whether or not you'd like someonefrom the U.S. Embassy to meet us.\"Langdon suddenly didn't want anything to do with the embassy. All he could thinkof was the keystone, the inscription, and whether it would all lead to theGrail. He wondered if Teabing was right about Britain. Admittedly most modernlegends placed the Grail somewhere in the United Kingdom. Even King Arthur'smythical, Grail-rich Isle of Avalon was now believed to be none other thanGlastonbury, England. Wherever the Grail lay, Langdon never imagined he wouldactually be looking for it. The Sangreal documents. The true history of JesusChrist. The tomb of Mary Magdalene. He suddenly felt as if he were living insome kind of limbo tonight... a bubble where the real world could not reach him.\"Sir?\" Rémy said. \"Are you truly thinking of returning to England for good?\"\"Rémy, you needn't worry,\" Teabing assured. \"Just because I am returning to theQueen's realm does not mean I intend to subject my palate to bangers and mashfor the rest of my days. I expect you will join me there permanently. I'mplanning to buy a splendid villa in Devonshire, and we'll have all your thingsshipped up immediately. An adventure, Rémy. I say, an adventure!\"Langdon had to smile. As Teabing railed on about his plans for a triumphantreturn to Britain, Langdon felt himself caught up in the man's infectiousenthusiasm.Gazing absently out the window, Langdon watched the woods passing by, ghostlypale in the yellow blush of the fog lights. The side mirror was tipped inward,brushed askew by branches, and Langdon saw the reflection of Sophie sittingquietly in the back seat. He watched her for a long while and felt an unexpectedupwelling of contentment. Despite his troubles tonight, Langdon was thankful tohave landed in such good company.After several minutes, as if suddenly sensing his eyes on her, Sophie leanedforward and put her hands on his shoulders, giving him a quick rub. \"You okay?\"\"Yeah,\" Langdon said. \"Somehow.\"Sophie sat back in her seat, and Langdon saw a quiet smile cross her lips. Herealized that he too was now grinning. Wedged in the back of the Range Rover, Silas could barely breathe. His arms werewrenched backward and heavily lashed to his ankles with kitchen twine and ducttape. Every bump in the road sent pain shooting through his twisted shoulders.At least his captors had removed the cilice. Unable to inhale through the stripof tape over his mouth, he could only breathe through his nostrils, which wereslowly clogging up due to the dusty rear cargo area into which he had beencrammed. He began coughing.\"I think he's choking,\" the French driver said, sounding concerned.The British man who had struck Silas with his crutch now turned and peered overthe seat, frowning coldly at Silas. \"Fortunately for you, we British judge man'scivility not by his compassion for his friends, but by his compassion for hisenemies.\" The Brit reached down and grabbed the duct tape on Silas's mouth. Inone fast motion, he tore it off.Silas felt as if his lips had just caught fire, but the air pouring into hislungs was sent from God.\"Whom do you work for?\" the British man demanded.\"I do the work of God,\" Silas spat back through the pain in his jaw where thewoman had kicked him.\"You belong to Opus Dei,\" the man said. It was not a question.\"You know nothing of who I am.\"\"Why does Opus Dei want the keystone?\"Silas had no intention of answering. The keystone was the link to the HolyGrail, and the Holy Grail was the key to protecting the faith.I do the work of God. The Way is in peril.Now, in the Range Rover, struggling against his bonds, Silas feared he hadfailed the Teacher and the bishop forever. He had no way even to contact themand tell them the terrible turn of events. My captors have the keystone! Theywill reach the Grail before we do! In the stifling darkness, Silas prayed. Helet the pain of his body fuel his supplications.A miracle, Lord. I need a miracle. Silas had no way of knowing that hours fromnow, he would get one. \"Robert?\" Sophie was still watching him. \"A funny look just crossed your face.\"Langdon glanced back at her, realizing his jaw was firmly set and his heart wasracing. An incredible notion had just occurred to him. Could it really be thatsimple an explanation? \"I need to use your cell phone, Sophie.\"\"Now?\"\"I think I just figured something out.\"\"What?\"\"I'll tell you in a minute. I need your phone.\"Sophie looked wary. \"I doubt Fache is tracing, but keep it under a minute justin case.\" She gave him her phone.\"How do I dial the States?\"\"You need to reverse the charges. My service doesn't cover transatlantic.\"Langdon dialed zero, knowing that the next sixty seconds might answer a questionthat had been puzzling him all night. CHAPTER 68New York editor Jonas Faukman had just climbed into bed for the night when thetelephone rang. A little late for callers, he grumbled, picking up the receiver.An operator's voice asked him, \"Will you accept charges for a collect call fromRobert Langdon?\"Puzzled, Jonas turned on the light. \"Uh... sure, okay.\"The line clicked. \"Jonas?\"\"Robert? You wake me up and you charge me for it?\"\"Jonas, forgive me,\" Langdon said. \"I'll keep this very short. I really need toknow. The manuscript I gave you. Have you—\"\"Robert, I'm sorry, I know I said I'd send the edits out to you this week, butI'm swamped. Next Monday. I promise.\"\"I'm not worried about the edits. I need to know if you sent any copies out forblurbs without telling me?\"Faukman hesitated. Langdon's newest manuscript—an exploration of the history ofgoddess worship—included several sections about Mary Magdalene that were goingto raise some eyebrows. Although the material was well documented and had beencovered by others, Faukman had no intention of printing Advance Reading Copiesof Langdon's book without at least a few endorsements from serious historiansand art luminaries. Jonas had chosen ten big names in the art world and sentthem all sections of the manuscript along with a polite letter asking if theywould be willing to write a short endorsement for the jacket. In Faukman'sexperience, most people jumped at the opportunity to see their name in print.\"Jonas?\" Langdon pressed. \"You sent out my manuscript, didn't you?\"Faukman frowned, sensing Langdon was not happy about it. \"The manuscript wasclean, Robert, and I wanted to surprise you with some terrific blurbs.\"A pause. \"Did you send one to the curator of the Paris Louvre?\"\"What do you think? Your manuscript referenced his Louvre collection severaltimes, his books are in your bibliography, and the guy has some serious cloutfor foreign sales. Saunière was a no-brainer.\"The silence on the other end lasted a long time. \"When did you send it?\"\"About a month ago. I also mentioned you would be in Paris soon and suggestedyou two chat. Did he ever call you to meet?\" Faukman paused, rubbing his eyes.\"Hold on, aren't you supposed to be in Paris this week?\"\"I am in Paris.\"Faukman sat upright. \"You called me collect from Paris?\"\"Take it out of my royalties, Jonas. Did you ever hear back from Saunière? Didhe like the manuscript?\"\"I don't know. I haven't yet heard from him.\"\"Well, don't hold your breath. I've got to run, but this explains a lot Thanks.\"\"Robert—\"But Langdon was gone.Faukman hung up the phone, shaking his head in disbelief Authors, he thought.Even the sane ones are nuts. Inside the Range Rover, Leigh Teabing let out a guffaw. \"Robert, you're sayingyou wrote a manuscript that delves into a secret society, and your editor sent acopy to that secret society?\"Langdon slumped. \"Evidently.\"\"A cruel coincidence, my friend.\"Coincidence has nothing to do with it, Langdon knew. Asking Jacques Saunière toendorse a manuscript on goddess worship was as obvious as asking Tiger Woods toendorse a book on golf. Moreover, it was virtually guaranteed that any book ongoddess worship would have to mention the Priory of Sion.\"Here's the million-dollar question,\" Teabing said, still chuckling. \"Was yourposition on the Priory favorable or unfavorable?\"Langdon could hear Teabing's true meaning loud and clear. Many historiansquestioned why the Priory was still keeping the Sangreal documents hidden. Somefelt the information should have been shared with the world long ago. \"I took noposition on the Priory's actions.\"\"You mean lack thereof.\"Langdon shrugged. Teabing was apparently on the side of making the documentspublic. \"I simply provided history on the brotherhood and described them as amodern goddess worship society, keepers of the Grail, and guardians of ancientdocuments.\"Sophie looked at him. \"Did you mention the keystone?\"Langdon winced. He had. Numerous times. \"I talked about the supposed keystone asan example of the lengths to which the Priory would go to protect the Sangrealdocuments.\"Sophie looked amazed. \"I guess that explains P.S. Find Robert Langdon.\"Langdon sensed it was actually something else in the manuscript that had piquedSaunière's interest, but that topic was something he would discuss with Sophiewhen they were alone.\"So,\" Sophie said, \"you lied to Captain Fache.\"\"What?\" Langdon demanded.\"You told him you had never corresponded with my grandfather.\"\"I didn't! My editor sent him a manuscript.\"\"Think about it, Robert. If Captain Fache didn't find the envelope in which youreditor sent the manuscript, he would have to conclude that you sent it.\" Shepaused. \"Or worse, that you hand-delivered it and lied about it.\" When the Range Rover arrived at Le Bourget Airfield, Rémy drove to a smallhangar at the far end of the airstrip. As they approached, a tousled man inwrinkled khakis hurried from the hangar, waved, and slid open the enormouscorrugated metal door to reveal a sleek white jet within.Langdon stared at the glistening fuselage. \"That's Elizabeth?\"Teabing grinned. \"Beats the bloody Chunnel.\"The man in khakis hurried toward them, squinting into the headlights. \"Almostready, sir,\" he called in a British accent. \"My apologies for the delay, but youtook me by surprise and—\" He stopped short as the group unloaded. He looked atSophie and Langdon, and then Teabing.Teabing said, \"My associates and I have urgent business in London. We've no timeto waste. Please prepare to depart immediately.\" As he spoke, Teabing took thepistol out of the vehicle and handed it to Langdon.The pilot's eyes bulged at the sight of the weapon. He walked over to Teabingand whispered, \"Sir, my humble apologies, but my diplomatic flight allowanceprovides only for you and your manservant. I cannot take your guests.\"\"Richard,\" Teabing said, smiling warmly, \"two thousand pounds sterling and thatloaded gun say you can take my guests.\" He motioned to the Range Rover. \"And theunfortunate fellow in the back.\" CHAPTER 69The Hawker 731's twin Garrett TFE-731 engines thundered, powering the planeskyward with gut-wrenching force. Outside the window, Le Bourget Airfielddropped away with startling speed.I'm fleeing the country, Sophie thought, her body forced back into the leatherseat. Until this moment, she had believed her game of cat and mouse with Fachewould be somehow justifiable to the Ministry of Defense. I was attempting toprotect an innocent man. I was trying to fulfill my grandfather's dying wishes.That window of opportunity, Sophie knew, had just closed. She was leaving thecountry, without documentation, accompanying a wanted man, and transporting abound hostage. If a \"line of reason\" had ever existed, she had just crossed it.At almost the speed of sound.Sophie was seated with Langdon and Teabing near the front of the cabin—the FanJet Executive Elite Design, according to the gold medallion on the door. Theirplush swivel chairs were bolted to tracks on the floor and could be repositionedand locked around a rectangular hardwood table. A mini-boardroom. The dignifiedsurroundings, however, did little to camouflage the less than dignified state ofaffairs in the rear of the plane where, in a separate seating area near the restroom, Teabing's manservant Rémy sat with the pistol in hand, begrudginglycarrying out Teabing's orders to stand guard over the bloody monk who laytrussed at his feet like a piece of luggage.\"Before we turn our attention to the keystone,\" Teabing said, \"I was wonderingif you would permit me a few words.\" He sounded apprehensive, like a fatherabout to give the birds-and-the-bees lecture to his children. \"My friends, Irealize I am but a guest on this journey, and I am honored as such. And yet, assomeone who has spent his life in search of the Grail, I feel it is my duty towarn you that you are about to step onto a path from which there is no return,regardless of the dangers involved.\" He turned to Sophie. \"Miss Neveu, yourgrandfather gave you this cryptex in hopes you would keep the secret of the HolyGrail alive.\"\"Yes.\"\"Understandably, you feel obliged to follow the trail wherever it leads.\"Sophie nodded, although she felt a second motivation still burning within her.The truth about my family. Despite Langdon's assurances that the keystone hadnothing to do with her past, Sophie still sensed something deeply personalentwined within this mystery, as if this cryptex, forged by her grandfather'sown hands, were trying to speak to her and offer some kind of resolution to theemptiness that had haunted her all these years.\"Your grandfather and three others died tonight,\" Teabing continued, \"and theydid so to keep this keystone away from the Church. Opus Dei came within inchestonight of possessing it. You understand, I hope, that this puts you in aposition of exceptional responsibility. You have been handed a torch. Atwo-thousand-year-old flame that cannot be allowed to go out. This torch cannotfall into the wrong hands.\" He paused, glancing at the rosewood box. \"I realizeyou have been given no choice in this matter, Miss Neveu, but considering whatis at stake here, you must either fully embrace this responsibility... or youmust pass that responsibility to someone else.\"\"My grandfather gave the cryptex to me. I'm sure he thought I could handle theresponsibility.\"Teabing looked encouraged but unconvinced. \"Good. A strong will is necessary.And yet, I am curious if you understand that successfully unlocking the keystonewill bring with it a far greater trial.\"\"How so?\"\"My dear, imagine that you are suddenly holding a map that reveals the locationof the Holy Grail. In that moment, you will be in possession of a truth capableof altering history forever. You will be the keeper of a truth that man hassought for centuries. You will be faced with the responsibility of revealingthat truth to the world. The individual who does so will be revered by many anddespised by many. The question is whether you will have the necessary strengthto carry out that task.\"Sophie paused. \"I'm not sure that is my decision to make.\"Teabing's eyebrows arched. \"No? If not the possessor of the keystone, then who?\"\"The brotherhood who has successfully protected the secret for so long.\"\"The Priory?\" Teabing looked skeptical. \"But how? The brotherhood was shatteredtonight. Decapitated, as you so aptly put it. Whether they were infiltrated bysome kind of eavesdropping or by a spy within their ranks, we will never know,but the fact remains that someone got to them and uncovered the identities oftheir four top members. I would not trust anyone who stepped forward from thebrotherhood at this point.\"\"So what do you suggest?\" Langdon asked.\"Robert, you know as well as I do that the Priory has not protected the truthall these years to have it gather dust until eternity. They have been waitingfor the right moment in history to share their secret. A time when the world isready to handle the truth.\"\"And you believe that moment has arrived?\" Langdon asked.\"Absolutely. It could not be more obvious. All the historical signs are inplace, and if the Priory did not intend to make their secret known very soon,why has the Church now attacked?\"Sophie argued, \"The monk has not yet told us his purpose.\"\"The monk's purpose is the Church's purpose,\" Teabing replied, \"to destroy thedocuments that reveal the great deception. The Church came closer tonight thanthey have ever come, and the Priory has put its trust in you, Miss Neveu. Thetask of saving the Holy Grail clearly includes carrying out the Priory's finalwishes of sharing the truth with the world.\"Langdon intervened. \"Leigh, asking Sophie to make that decision is quite a loadto drop on someone who only an hour ago learned the Sangreal documents exist.\"Teabing sighed. \"I apologize if I am pressing, Miss Neveu. Clearly I have alwaysbelieved these documents should be made public, but in the end the decisionbelongs to you. I simply feel it is important that you begin to think about whathappens should we succeed in opening the keystone.\"\"Gentlemen,\" Sophie said, her voice firm. \"To quote your words, 'You do not findthe Grail, the Grail finds you.' I am going to trust that the Grail has found mefor a reason, and when the time comes, I will know what to do.\"Both of them looked startled.\"So then,\" she said, motioning to the rosewood box. \"Let's move on.\" CHAPTER 70Standing in the drawing room of Château Villette, Lieutenant Collet watched thedying fire and felt despondent. Captain Fache had arrived moments earlier andwas now in the next room, yelling into the phone, trying to coordinate thefailed attempt to locate the missing Range Rover.It could be anywhere by now, Collet thought.Having disobeyed Fache's direct orders and lost Langdon for a second time,Collet was grateful that PTS had located a bullet hole in the floor, which atleast corroborated Collet's claims that a shot had been fired. Still, Fache'smood was sour, and Collet sensed there would be dire repercussions when the dustsettled.Unfortunately, the clues they were turning up here seemed to shed no light atall on what was going on or who was involved. The black Audi outside had beenrented in a false name with false credit card numbers, and the prints in the carmatched nothing in the Interpol database.Another agent hurried into the living room, his eyes urgent. \"Where's CaptainFache?\"Collet barely looked up from the burning embers. \"He's on the phone.\"\"I'm off the phone,\" Fache snapped, stalking into the room. \"What have you got?\"The second agent said, \"Sir, Central just heard from André Vernet at theDepository Bank of Zurich. He wants to talk to you privately. He is changing hisstory.\"\"Oh?\" Fache said.Now Collet looked up.\"Vernet is admitting that Langdon and Neveu spent time inside his bank tonight.\"\"We figured that out,\" Fache said. \"Why did Vernet lie about it?\"\"He said he'll talk only to you, but he's agreed to cooperate fully.\"\"In exchange for what?\"\"For our keeping his bank's name out of the news and also for helping himrecover some stolen property. It sounds like Langdon and Neveu stole somethingfrom Saunière's account.\"\"What?\" Collet blurted. \"How?\"Fache never flinched, his eyes riveted on the second agent. \"What did theysteal?\"\"Vernet didn't elaborate, but he sounds like he's willing to do anything to getit back.\"Collet tried to imagine how this could happen. Maybe Langdon and Neveu had helda bank employee at gunpoint? Maybe they forced Vernet to open Saunière's accountand facilitate an escape in the armored truck. As feasible as it was, Collet washaving trouble believing Sophie Neveu could be involved in anything like that.From the kitchen, another agent yelled to Fache. \"Captain? I'm going through Mr.Teabing's speed dial numbers, and I'm on the phone with Le Bourget Airfield.I've got some bad news.\" Thirty seconds later, Fache was packing up and preparing to leave ChâteauVillette. He had just learned that Teabing kept a private jet nearby at LeBourget Airfield and that the plane had taken off about a half hour ago.The Bourget representative on the phone had claimed not to know who was on theplane or where it was headed. The takeoff had been unscheduled, and no flightplan had been logged. Highly illegal, even for a small airfield. Fache wascertain that by applying the right pressure, he could get the answers he waslooking for.\"Lieutenant Collet,\" Fache barked, heading for the door. \"I have no choice butto leave you in charge of the PTS investigation here. Try to do something rightfor a change.\" CHAPTER 71As the Hawker leveled off, with its nose aimed for England, Langdon carefullylifted the rosewood box from his lap, where he had been protecting it duringtakeoff. Now, as he set the box on the table, he could sense Sophie and Teabingleaning forward with anticipation.Unlatching the lid and opening the box, Langdon turned his attention not to thelettered dials of the cryptex, but rather to the tiny hole on the underside ofthe box lid. Using the tip of a pen, he carefully removed the inlaid Rose on topand revealed the text beneath it. Sub Rosa, he mused, hoping a fresh look at thetext would bring clarity. Focusing all his energies, Langdon studied the strangetext.strange text [danbrown/davincicode-5.gif]After several seconds, he began to feel the initial frustration resurfacing.\"Leigh, I just can't seem to place it.\"From where Sophie was seated across the table, she could not yet see the text,but Langdon's inability to immediately identify the language surprised her. Mygrandfather spoke a language so obscure that even a symbologist can't identifyit? She quickly realized she should not find this surprising. This would not bethe first secret Jacques Saunière had kept from his granddaughter. Opposite Sophie, Leigh Teabing felt ready to burst. Eager for his chance to seethe text, he quivered with excitement, leaning in, trying to see around Langdon,who was still hunched over the box.\"I don't know,\" Langdon whispered intently. \"My first guess is a Semitic, butnow I'm not so sure. Most primary Semitics include nekkudot. This has none.\"\"Probably ancient,\" Teabing offered.\"Nekkudot?\" Sophie inquired.Teabing never took his eyes from the box. \"Most modern Semitic alphabets have novowels and use nekkudot—tiny dots and dashes written either below or within theconsonants—to indicate what vowel sound accompanies them. Historically speaking,nekkudot are a relatively modern addition to language.\"Langdon was still hovering over the script. \"A Sephardic transliteration,perhaps...?\"Teabing could bear it no longer. \"Perhaps if I just...\" Reaching over, he edgedthe box away from Langdon and pulled it toward himself. No doubt Langdon had asolid familiarity with the standard ancients—Greek, Latin, the Romances—but fromthe fleeting glance Teabing had of this language, he thought it looked morespecialized, possibly a Rashi script or a STA'M with crowns.Taking a deep breath, Teabing feasted his eyes upon the engraving. He saidnothing for a very long time. With each passing second, Teabing felt hisconfidence deflating. \"I'm astonished,\" he said. \"This language looks likenothing I've ever seen!\"Langdon slumped.\"Might I see it?\" Sophie asked.Teabing pretended not to hear her. \"Robert, you said earlier that you thoughtyou'd seen something like this before?\"Langdon looked vexed. \"I thought so. I'm not sure. The script looks familiarsomehow.\"\"Leigh?\" Sophie repeated, clearly not appreciating being left out of thediscussion. \"Might I have a look at the box my grandfather made?\"\"Of course, dear,\" Teabing said, pushing it over to her. He hadn't meant tosound belittling, and yet Sophie Neveu was light-years out of her league. If aBritish Royal Historian and a Harvard symbologist could not even identify thelanguage—\"Aah,\" Sophie said, seconds after examining the box. \"I should have guessed.\"Teabing and Langdon turned in unison, staring at her.\"Guessed what?\" Teabing demanded.Sophie shrugged. \"Guessed that this would be the language my grandfather wouldhave used.\"\"You're saying you can read this text?\" Teabing exclaimed.\"Quite easily,\" Sophie chimed, obviously enjoying herself now. \"My grandfathertaught me this language when I was only six years old. I'm fluent.\" She leanedacross the table and fixed Teabing with an admonishing glare. \"And frankly, sir,considering your allegiance to the Crown, I'm a little surprised you didn'trecognize it.\"In a flash, Langdon knew.No wonder the script looks so damned familiar!Several years ago, Langdon had attended an event at Harvard's Fogg Museum.Harvard dropout Bill Gates had returned to his alma mater to lend to the museumone of his priceless acquisitions—eighteen sheets of paper he had recentlypurchased at auction from the Armand Hammar Estate.His winning bid—a cool $30.8 million.The author of the pages—Leonardo da Vinci.The eighteen folios—now known as Leonardo's Codex Leicester after their famousowner, the Earl of Leicester—were all that remained of one of Leonardo's mostfascinating notebooks: essays and drawings outlining Da Vinci's progressivetheories on astronomy, geology, archaeology, and hydrology.Langdon would never forget his reaction after waiting in line and finallyviewing the priceless parchment. Utter letdown. The pages were unintelligible.Despite being beautifully preserved and written in an impeccably neatpenmanship—crimson ink on cream paper—the codex looked like gibberish. At firstLangdon thought he could not read them because Da Vinci wrote his notebooks inan archaic Italian. But after studying them more closely, he realized he couldnot identify a single Italian word, or even one letter.\"Try this, sir,\" whispered the female docent at the display case. She motionedto a hand mirror affixed to the display on a chain. Langdon picked it up andexamined the text in the mirror's surface.Instantly it was clear.Langdon had been so eager to peruse some of the great thinker's ideas that hehad forgotten one of the man's numerous artistic talents was an ability to writein a mirrored script that was virtually illegible to anyone other than himself.Historians still debated whether Da Vinci wrote this way simply to amuse himselfor to keep people from peering over his shoulder and stealing his ideas, but thepoint was moot. Da Vinci did as he pleased. Sophie smiled inwardly to see that Robert understood her meaning. \"I can readthe first few words,\" she said. \"It's English.\"Teabing was still sputtering. \"What's going on?\"\"Reverse text,\" Langdon said. \"We need a mirror.\"\"No we don't,\" Sophie said. \"I bet this veneer is thin enough.\" She lifted therosewood box up to a canister light on the wall and began examining theunderside of the lid. Her grandfather couldn't actually write in reverse, so healways cheated by writing normally and then flipping the paper over and tracingthe reversed impression. Sophie's guess was that he had wood-burned normal textinto a block of wood and then run the back of the block through a sander untilthe wood was paper thin and the wood-burning could be seen through the wood.Then he'd simply flipped the piece over, and laid it in.As Sophie moved the lid closer to the light, she saw she was right. The brightbeam sifted through the thin layer of wood, and the script appeared in reverseon the underside of the lid.Instantly legible.\"English,\" Teabing croaked, hanging his head in shame. \"My native tongue.\" At the rear of the plane, Rémy Legaludec strained to hear beyond the rumblingengines, but the conversation up front was inaudible. Rémy did not like the waythe night was progressing. Not at all. He looked down at the bound monk at hisfeet. The man lay perfectly still now, as if in a trance of acceptance, orperhaps, in silent prayer for deliverance. CHAPTER 72Fifteen thousand feet in the air, Robert Langdon felt the physical world fadeaway as all of his thoughts converged on Saunière's mirror-image poem, which wasilluminated through the lid of the box.mirrored text [danbrown/davincicode-6.gif]Sophie quickly found some paper and copied it down longhand. When she was done,the three of them took turns reading the text. It was like some kind ofarchaeological crossword... a riddle that promised to reveal how to open thecryptex. Langdon read the verse slowly.An ancient word of wisdom frees this scroll... and helps us keep her scatter'dfamily whole... a headstone praised by templars is the key... and atbash willreveal the truth to thee.Before Langdon could even ponder what ancient password the verse was trying toreveal, he felt something far more fundamental resonate within him—the meter ofthe poem. Iambic pentameter.Langdon had come across this meter often over the years while researching secretsocieties across Europe, including just last year in the Vatican SecretArchives. For centuries, iambic pentameter had been a preferred poetic meter ofoutspoken literati across the globe, from the ancient Greek writer Archilochusto Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer, and Voltaire—bold souls who chose to writetheir social commentaries in a meter that many of the day believed had mysticalproperties. The roots of iambic pentameter were deeply pagan.Iambs. Two syllables with opposite emphasis. Stressed and unstressed. Yin yang.A balanced pair. Arranged in strings of five. Pentameter. Five for the pentacleof Venus and the sacred feminine.\"It's pentameter!\" Teabing blurted, turning to Langdon. \"And the verse is inEnglish! La lingua pura!\"Langdon nodded. The Priory, like many European secret societies at odds with theChurch, had considered English the only European pure language for centuries.Unlike French, Spanish, and Italian, which were rooted in Latin—the tongue ofthe Vatican—English was linguistically removed from Rome's propaganda machine,and therefore became a sacred, secret tongue for those brotherhoods educatedenough to learn it.\"This poem,\" Teabing gushed, \"references not only the Grail, but the KnightsTemplar and the scattered family of Mary Magdalene! What more could we ask for?\"\"The password,\" Sophie said, looking again at the poem. \"It sounds like we needsome kind of ancient word of wisdom?\"\"Abracadabra?\" Teabing ventured, his eyes twinkling.A word of five letters, Langdon thought, pondering the staggering number ofancient words that might be considered words of wisdom—selections from mysticchants, astrological prophecies, secret society inductions, Wicca incantations,Egyptian magic spells, pagan mantras—the list was endless.\"The password,\" Sophie said, \"appears to have something to do with theTemplars.\" She read the text aloud. \" 'A headstone praised by Templars is thekey.' \"\"Leigh,\" Langdon said, \"you're the Templar specialist. Any ideas?\"Teabing was silent for several seconds and then sighed. \"Well, a headstone isobviously a grave marker of some sort. It's possible the poem is referencing agravestone the Templars praised at the tomb of Magdalene, but that doesn't helpus much because we have no idea where her tomb is.\"\"The last line,\" Sophie said, \"says that Atbash will reveal the truth. I'veheard that word. Atbash.\"\"I'm not surprised,\" Langdon replied. \"You probably heard it in Cryptology 101.The Atbash Cipher is one of the oldest codes known to man.\"Of course! Sophie thought. The famous Hebrew encoding system.The Atbash Cipher had indeed been part of Sophie's early cryptology training.The cipher dated back to 500 B.C. and was now used as a classroom example of abasic rotational substitution scheme. A common form of Jewish cryptogram, theAtbash Cipher was a simple substitution code based on the twenty-two-letterHebrew alphabet. In Atbash, the first letter was substituted by the last letter,the second letter by the next to last letter, and so on.\"Atbash is sublimely appropriate,\" Teabing said. \"Text encrypted with Atbash isfound throughout the Kabbala, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and even the Old Testament.Jewish scholars and mystics are still finding hidden meanings using Atbash. ThePriory certainly would include the Atbash Cipher as part of their teachings.\"\"The only problem,\" Langdon said, \"is that we don't have anything on which toapply the cipher.\"Teabing sighed. \"There must be a code word on the headstone. We must find thisheadstone praised by Templars.\"Sophie sensed from the grim look on Langdon's face that finding the Templarheadstone would be no small feat.Atbash is the key, Sophie thought. But we don't have a door.It was three minutes later that Teabing heaved a frustrated sigh and shook hishead. \"My friends, I'm stymied. Let me ponder this while I get us some nibbliesand check on Rémy and our guest.\" He stood up and headed for the back of theplane.Sophie felt tired as she watched him go.Outside the window, the blackness of the predawn was absolute. Sophie felt as ifshe were being hurtled through space with no idea where she would land. Havinggrown up solving her grandfather's riddles, she had the uneasy sense right nowthat this poem before them contained information they still had not seen.There is more there, she told herself. Ingeniously hidden... but presentnonetheless.Also plaguing her thoughts was a fear that what they eventually found insidethis cryptex would not be as simple as \"a map to the Holy Grail.\" DespiteTeabing's and Langdon's confidence that the truth lay just within the marblecylinder, Sophie had solved enough of her grandfather's treasure hunts to knowthat Jacques Saunière did not give up his secrets easily. CHAPTER 73Bourget Airfield's night shift air traffic controller had been dozing before ablank radar screen when the captain of the Judicial Police practically brokedown his door.\"Teabing's jet,\" Bezu Fache blared, marching into the small tower, \"where did itgo?\"The controller's initial response was a babbling, lame attempt to protect theprivacy of their British client—one of the airfield's most respected customers.It failed miserably.\"Okay,\" Fache said, \"I am placing you under arrest for permitting a privateplane to take off without registering a flight plan.\" Fache motioned to anotherofficer, who approached with handcuffs, and the traffic controller felt a surgeof terror. He thought of the newspaper articles debating whether the nation'spolice captain was a hero or a menace. That question had just been answered.\"Wait!\" the controller heard himself whimper at the sight of the handcuffs. \"Ican tell you this much. Sir Leigh Teabing makes frequent trips to London formedical treatments. He has a hangar at Biggin Hill Executive Airport in Kent. Onthe outskirts of London.\"Fache waved off the man with the cuffs. \"Is Biggin Hill his destinationtonight?\"\"I don't know,\" the controller said honestly. \"The plane left on its usual tack,and his last radar contact suggested the United Kingdom. Biggin Hill is anextremely likely guess.\"\"Did he have others onboard?\"\"I swear, sir, there is no way for me to know that. Our clients can drivedirectly to their hangars, and load as they please. Who is onboard is theresponsibility of the customs officials at the receiving airport.\"Fache checked his watch and gazed out at the scattering of jets parked in frontof the terminal. \"If they're going to Biggin Hill, how long until they land?\"The controller fumbled through his records. \"It's a short flight. His planecould be on the ground by... around six-thirty. Fifteen minutes from now.\"Fache frowned and turned to one of his men. \"Get a transport up here. I'm goingto London. And get me the Kent local police. Not British MI5. I want this quiet.Kent local. Tell them I want Teabing's plane to be permitted to land. Then Iwant it surrounded on the tarmac. Nobody deplanes until I get there.\" CHAPTER 74\"You're quiet,\" Langdon said, gazing across the Hawker's cabin at Sophie.\"Just tired,\" she replied. \"And the poem. I don't know.\"Langdon was feeling the same way. The hum of the engines and the gentle rockingof the plane were hypnotic, and his head still throbbed where he'd been hit bythe monk. Teabing was still in the back of the plane, and Langdon decided totake advantage of the moment alone with Sophie to tell her something that hadbeen on his mind. \"I think I know part of the reason why your grandfatherconspired to put us together. I think there's something he wanted me to explainto you.\"\"The history of the Holy Grail and Mary Magdalene isn't enough?\"Langdon felt uncertain how to proceed. \"The rift between you. The reason youhaven't spoken to him in ten years. I think maybe he was hoping I could somehowmake that right by explaining what drove you apart.\"Sophie squirmed in her seat. \"I haven't told you what drove us apart.\"Langdon eyed her carefully. \"You witnessed a sex rite. Didn't you?\"Sophie recoiled. \"How do you know that?\"\"Sophie, you told me you witnessed something that convinced you your grandfatherwas in a secret society. And whatever you saw upset you enough that you haven'tspoken to him since. I know a fair amount about secret societies. It doesn'ttake the brains of Da Vinci to guess what you saw.\"Sophie stared.\"Was it in the spring?\" Langdon asked. \"Sometime around the equinox? Mid-March?\"Sophie looked out the window. \"I was on spring break from university. I camehome a few days early.\"\"You want to tell me about it?\"\"I'd rather not.\" She turned suddenly back to Langdon, her eyes welling withemotion. \"I don't know what I saw.\"\"Were both men and women present?\"After a beat, she nodded.\"Dressed in white and black?\"She wiped her eyes and then nodded, seeming to open up a little. \"The women werein white gossamer gowns... with golden shoes. They held golden orbs. The menwore black tunics and black shoes.\"Langdon strained to hide his emotion, and yet he could not believe what he washearing. Sophie Neveu had unwittingly witnessed a two-thousand-year-old sacredceremony. \"Masks?\" he asked, keeping his voice calm. \"Androgynous masks?\"\"Yes. Everyone. Identical masks. White on the women. Black on the men.\"Langdon had read descriptions of this ceremony and understood its mystic roots.\"It's called Hieros Gamos,\" he said softly. \"It dates back more than twothousand years. Egyptian priests and priestesses performed it regularly tocelebrate the reproductive power of the female,\" He paused, leaning toward her.\"And if you witnessed Hieros Gamos without being properly prepared to understandits meaning, I imagine it would be pretty shocking.\"Sophie said nothing.\"Hieros Gamos is Greek,\" he continued. \"It means sacred marriage.\"\"The ritual I saw was no marriage.\"\"Marriage as in union, Sophie.\"\"You mean as in sex.\"\"No.\"\"No?\" she said, her olive eyes testing him.Langdon backpedaled. \"Well... yes, in a manner of speaking, but not as weunderstand it today.\" He explained that although what she saw probably lookedlike a sex ritual, Hieros Gamos had nothing to do with eroticism. It was aspiritual act. Historically, intercourse was the act through which male andfemale experienced God. The ancients believed that the male was spirituallyincomplete until he had carnal knowledge of the sacred feminine. Physical unionwith the female remained the sole means through which man could becomespiritually complete and ultimately achieve gnosis—knowledge of the divine.Since the days of Isis, sex rites had been considered man's only bridge fromearth to heaven. \"By communing with woman,\" Langdon said, \"man could achieve aclimactic instant when his mind went totally blank and he could see God.\"Sophie looked skeptical. \"Orgasm as prayer?\"Langdon gave a noncommittal shrug, although Sophie was essentially correct.Physiologically speaking, the male climax was accompanied by a split secondentirely devoid of thought. A brief mental vacuum. A moment of clarity duringwhich God could be glimpsed. Meditation gurus achieved similar states ofthoughtlessness without sex and often described Nirvana as a never-endingspiritual orgasm.\"Sophie,\" Langdon said quietly, \"it's important to remember that the ancients'view of sex was entirely opposite from ours today. Sex begot new life—theultimate miracle—and miracles could be performed only by a god. The ability ofthe woman to produce life from her womb made her sacred. A god. Intercourse wasthe revered union of the two halves of the human spirit—male and female—throughwhich the male could find spiritual wholeness and communion with God. What yousaw was not about sex, it was about spirituality. The Hieros Gamos ritual is nota perversion. It's a deeply sacrosanct ceremony.\"His words seemed to strike a nerve. Sophie had been remarkably poised allevening, but now, for the first time, Langdon saw the aura of composurebeginning to crack. Tears materialized in her eyes again, and she dabbed themaway with her sleeve.He gave her a moment. Admittedly, the concept of sex as a pathway to God wasmind-boggling at first. Langdon's Jewish students always looked flabbergastedwhen he first told them that the early Jewish tradition involved ritualisticsex. In the Temple, no less. Early Jews believed that the Holy of Holies inSolomon's Temple housed not only God but also His powerful female equal,Shekinah. Men seeking spiritual wholeness came to the Temple to visitpriestesses—or hierodules—with whom they made love and experienced the divinethrough physical union. The Jewish tetragrammaton YHWH—the sacred name of God—infact derived from Jehovah, an androgynous physical union between the masculineJah and the pre-Hebraic name for Eve, Havah.\"For the early Church,\" Langdon explained in a soft voice, \"mankind's use of sexto commune directly with God posed a serious threat to the Catholic power base.It left the Church out of the loop, undermining their self-proclaimed status asthe sole conduit to God. For obvious reasons, they worked hard to demonize sexand recast it as a disgusting and sinful act. Other major religions did thesame.\"Sophie was silent, but Langdon sensed she was starting to understand hergrandfather better. Ironically, Langdon had made this same point in a classlecture earlier this semester. \"Is it surprising we feel conflicted about sex?\"he asked his students. \"Our ancient heritage and our very physiologies tell ussex is natural—a cherished route to spiritual fulfillment—and yet modernreligion decries it as shameful, teaching us to fear our sexual desire as thehand of the devil.\"Langdon decided not to shock his students with the fact that more than a dozensecret societies around the world—many of them quite influential—still practicedsex rites and kept the ancient traditions alive. Tom Cruise's character in thefilm Eyes Wide Shut discovered this the hard way when he sneaked into a privategathering of ultraelite Manhattanites only to find himself witnessing HierosGamos. Sadly, the filmmakers had gotten most of the specifics wrong, but thebasic gist was there—a secret society communing to celebrate the magic of sexualunion.\"Professor Langdon?\" A male student in back raised his hand, sounding hopeful.\"Are you saying that instead of going to chapel, we should have more sex?\"Langdon chuckled, not about to take the bait. From what he'd heard about Harvardparties, these kids were having more than enough sex. \"Gentlemen,\" he said,knowing he was on tender ground, \"might I offer a suggestion for all of you.Without being so bold as to condone premarital sex, and without being so naiveas to think you're all chaste angels, I will give you this bit of advice aboutyour sex lives.\"All the men in the audience leaned forward, listening intently.\"The next time you find yourself with a woman, look in your heart and see if youcannot approach sex as a mystical, spiritual act. Challenge yourself to findthat spark of divinity that man can only achieve through union with the sacredfeminine.\"The women smiled knowingly, nodding.The men exchanged dubious giggles and off-color jokes.Langdon sighed. College men were still boys. Sophie's forehead felt cold as she pressed it against the plane's window andstared blankly into the void, trying to process what Langdon had just told her.She felt a new regret well within her. Ten years. She pictured the stacks ofunopened letters her grandfather had sent her. I will tell Robert everything.Without turning from the window, Sophie began to speak. Quietly. Fearfully.As she began to recount what had happened that night, she felt herself driftingback... alighting in the woods outside her grandfather's Normandy château...searching the deserted house in confusion... hearing the voices below her... andthen finding the hidden door. She inched down the stone staircase, one step at atime, into that basement grotto. She could taste the earthy air. Cool and light.It was March. In the shadows of her hiding place on the staircase, she watchedas the strangers swayed and chanted by flickering orange candles.I'm dreaming, Sophie told herself. This is a dream. What else could this be?The women and men were staggered, black, white, black, white. The women'sbeautiful gossamer gowns billowed as they raised in their right hands goldenorbs and called out in unison, \"I was with you in the beginning, in the dawn ofall that is holy, I bore you from the womb before the start of day.\"The women lowered their orbs, and everyone rocked back and forth as if in atrance. They were revering something in the center of the circle.What are they looking at?The voices accelerated now. Louder. Faster.\"The woman whom you behold is love!\" The women called, raising their orbs again.The men responded, \"She has her dwelling in eternity!\"The chanting grew steady again. Accelerating. Thundering now. Faster. Theparticipants stepped inward and knelt.In that instant, Sophie could finally see what they were all watching.On a low, ornate altar in the center of the circle lay a man. He was naked,positioned on his back, and wearing a black mask. Sophie instantly recognizedhis body and the birthmark on his shoulder. She almost cried out. Grand-père!This image alone would have shocked Sophie beyond belief, and yet there wasmore.Straddling her grandfather was a naked woman wearing a white mask, her luxuriantsilver hair flowing out behind it. Her body was plump, far from perfect, and shewas gyrating in rhythm to the chanting—making love to Sophie's grandfather.Sophie wanted to turn and run, but she couldn't. The stone walls of the grottoimprisoned her as the chanting rose to a fever pitch. The circle of participantsseemed almost to be singing now, the noise rising in crescendo to a frenzy. Witha sudden roar, the entire room seemed to erupt in climax. Sophie could notbreathe. She suddenly realized she was quietly sobbing. She turned and staggeredsilently up the stairs, out of the house, and drove trembling back to Paris. CHAPTER 75The chartered turboprop was just passing over the twinkling lights of Monacowhen Aringarosa hung up on Fache for the second time. He reached for theairsickness bag again but felt too drained even to be sick.Just let it be over!Fache's newest update seemed unfathomable, and yet almost nothing tonight madesense anymore. What is going on? Everything had spiraled wildly out of control.What have I gotten Silas into? What have I gotten myself into!On shaky legs, Aringarosa walked to the cockpit. \"I need to changedestinations.\"The pilot glanced over his shoulder and laughed. \"You're joking, right?\"\"No. I have to get to London immediately.\"\"Father, this is a charter flight, not a taxi.\"\"I will pay you extra, of course. How much? London is only one hour farthernorth and requires almost no change of direction, so—\"\"It's not a question of money, Father, there are other issues.\"\"Ten thousand euro. Right now.\"The pilot turned, his eyes wide with shock. \"How much? What kind of priestcarries that kind of cash?\"Aringarosa walked back to his black briefcase, opened it, and removed one of thebearer bonds. He handed it to the pilot.\"What is this?\" the pilot demanded.\"A ten-thousand-euro bearer bond drawn on the Vatican Bank.\"The pilot looked dubious.\"It's the same as cash.\"\"Only cash is cash,\" the pilot said, handing the bond back.Aringarosa felt weak as he steadied himself against the cockpit door. \"This is amatter of life or death. You must help me. I need to get to London.\"The pilot eyed the bishop's gold ring. \"Real diamonds?\"Aringarosa looked at the ring. \"I could not possibly part with this.\"The pilot shrugged, turning and focusing back out the windshield.Aringarosa felt a deepening sadness. He looked at the ring. Everything itrepresented was about to be lost to the bishop anyway. After a long moment, heslid the ring from his finger and placed it gently on the instrument panel.Aringarosa slunk out of the cockpit and sat back down. Fifteen seconds later, hecould feel the pilot banking a few more degrees to the north.Even so, Aringarosa's moment of glory was in shambles.It had all begun as a holy cause. A brilliantly crafted scheme. Now, like ahouse of cards, it was collapsing in on itself... and the end was nowhere insight. CHAPTER 76Langdon could see Sophie was still shaken from recounting her experience ofHieros Gamos. For his part, Langdon was amazed to have heard it. Not only hadSophie witnessed the full-blown ritual, but her own grandfather had been thecelebrant... the Grand Master of the Priory of Sion. It was heady company. DaVinci, Botticelli, Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, Jean Cocteau... Jacques Saunière.\"I don't know what else I can tell you,\" Langdon said softly.Sophie's eyes were a deep green now, tearful. \"He raised me like his owndaughter.\"Langdon now recognized the emotion that had been growing in her eyes as theyspoke. It was remorse. Distant and deep. Sophie Neveu had shunned hergrandfather and was now seeing him in an entirely different light.Outside, the dawn was coming fast, its crimson aura gathering off the starboard.The earth was still black beneath them.\"Victuals, my dears?\" Teabing rejoined them with a flourish, presenting severalcans of Coke and a box of old crackers. He apologized profusely for the limitedfare as he doled out the goods. \"Our friend the monk isn't talking yet,\" hechimed, \"but give him time.\" He bit into a cracker and eyed the poem. \"So, mylovely, any headway?\" He looked at Sophie. \"What is your grandfather trying totell us here? Where the devil is this headstone? This headstone praised byTemplars.\"Sophie shook her head and remained silent.While Teabing again dug into the verse, Langdon popped a Coke and turned to thewindow, his thoughts awash with images of secret rituals and unbroken codes. Aheadstone praised by Templars is the key. He took a long sip from the can. Aheadstone praised by Templars. The cola was warm.The dissolving veil of night seemed to evaporate quickly, and as Langdon watchedthe transformation, he saw a shimmering ocean stretch out beneath them. TheEnglish Channel. It wouldn't be long now.Langdon willed the light of day to bring with it a second kind of illumination,but the lighter it became outside, the further he felt from the truth. He heardthe rhythms of iambic pentameter and chanting, Hieros Gamos and sacred rites,resonating with the rumble of the jet.A headstone praised by Templars.The plane was over land again when a flash of enlightenment struck him. Langdonset down his empty can of Coke hard. \"You won't believe this,\" he said, turningto the others. \"The Templar headstone—I figured it out.\"Teabing's eyes turned to saucers. \"You know where the headstone is?\"Langdon smiled. \"Not where it is. What it is.\"Sophie leaned in to hear.\"I think the headstone references a literal stone head,\" Langdon explained,savoring the familiar excitement of academic breakthrough. \"Not a grave marker.\"\"A stone head?\" Teabing demanded.Sophie looked equally confused.\"Leigh,\" Langdon said, turning, \"during the Inquisition, the Church accused theKnights Templar of all kinds of heresies, right?\"\"Correct. They fabricated all kinds of charges. Sodomy, urination on the cross,devil worship, quite a list.\"\"And on that list was the worship of false idols, right? Specifically, theChurch accused the Templars of secretly performing rituals in which they prayedto a carved stone head... the pagan god—\"\"Baphomet!\" Teabing blurted. \"My heavens, Robert, you're right! A headstonepraised by Templars!\"Langdon quickly explained to Sophie that Baphomet was a pagan fertility godassociated with the creative force of reproduction. Baphomet's head wasrepresented as that of a ram or goat, a common symbol of procreation andfecundity. The Templars honored Baphomet by encircling a stone replica of hishead and chanting prayers.\"Baphomet,\" Teabing tittered. \"The ceremony honored the creative magic of sexualunion, but Pope Clement convinced everyone that Baphomet's head was in fact thatof the devil. The Pope used the head of Baphomet as the linchpin in his caseagainst the Templars.\"Langdon concurred. The modern belief in a horned devil known as Satan could betraced back to Baphomet and the Church's attempts to recast the horned fertilitygod as a symbol of evil. The Church had obviously succeeded, although notentirely. Traditional American Thanksgiving tables still bore pagan, hornedfertility symbols. The cornucopia or \"horn of plenty\" was a tribute toBaphomet's fertility and dated back to Zeus being suckled by a goat whose hornbroke off and magically filled with fruit. Baphomet also appeared in groupphotographs when some joker raised two fingers behind a friend's head in theV-symbol of horns; certainly few of the pranksters realized their mockinggesture was in fact advertising their victim's robust sperm count.\"Yes, yes,\" Teabing was saying excitedly. \"Baphomet must be what the poem isreferring to. A headstone praised by Templars.\"\"Okay,\" Sophie said, \"but if Baphomet is the headstone praised by Templars, thenwe have a new dilemma.\" She pointed to the dials on the cryptex. \"Baphomet haseight letters. We only have room for five.\"Teabing grinned broadly. \"My dear, this is where the Atbash Cipher comes intoplay\" CHAPTER 77Langdon was impressed. Teabing had just finished writing out the entiretwenty-two-letter Hebrew alphabet—alef-beit—from memory. Granted, he'd usedRoman equivalents rather than Hebrew characters, but even so, he was now readingthrough them with flawless pronunciation.A B G D H V Z Ch T Y K L M N S O P Tz Q R Sh Th\"Alef, Beit, Gimel, Dalet, Hei, Vav, Zayin, Chet, Tet, Yud, Kaf, Lamed, Mem,Nun, Samech, Ayin, Pei, Tzadik, Kuf, Reish, Shin, and Tav.\" Teabing dramaticallymopped his brow and plowed on. \"In formal Hebrew spelling, the vowel sounds arenot written. Therefore, when we write the word Baphomet using the Hebrewalphabet, it will lose its three vowels in translation, leaving us—\"\"Five letters,\" Sophie blurted.Teabing nodded and began writing again. \"Okay, here is the proper spelling ofBaphomet in Hebrew letters. I'll sketch in the missing vowels for clarity'ssake. B a P V o M e Th \"Remember, of course,\" he added, \"that Hebrew is normally written in theopposite direction, but we can just as easily use Atbash this way. Next, all wehave to do is create our substitution scheme by rewriting the entire alphabet inreverse order opposite the original alphabet.\"\"There's an easier way,\" Sophie said, taking the pen from Teabing. \"It works forall reflectional substitution ciphers, including the Atbash. A little trick Ilearned at the Royal Holloway.\" Sophie wrote the first half of the alphabet fromleft to right, and then, beneath it, wrote the second half, right to left.\"Cryptanalysts call it the fold-over. Half as complicated. Twice as clean.\" ABGDHVZChTYKThShRQTzPOSNML Teabing eyed her handiwork and chuckled. \"Right you are. Glad to see those boysat the Holloway are doing their job.\"Looking at Sophie's substitution matrix, Langdon felt a rising thrill that heimagined must have rivaled the thrill felt by early scholars when they firstused the Atbash Cipher to decrypt the now famous Mystery of Sheshach. For years,religious scholars had been baffled by biblical references to a city calledSheshach. The city did not appear on any map nor in any other documents, and yetit was mentioned repeatedly in the Book of Jeremiah—the king of Sheshach, thecity of Sheshach, the people of Sheshach. Finally, a scholar applied the AtbashCipher to the word, and his results were mind-numbing. The cipher revealed thatSheshach was in fact a code word for another very well-known city. Thedecryption process was simple.Sheshach, in Hebrew, was spelled: Sh-Sh-K.Sh-Sh-K, when placed in the substitution matrix, became B-B-L.B-B-L, in Hebrew, spelled Babel.The mysterious city of Sheshach was revealed as the city of Babel, and a frenzyof biblical examination ensued. Within weeks, several more Atbash code wordswere uncovered in the Old Testament, unveiling myriad hidden meanings thatscholars had no idea were there.\"We're getting close,\" Langdon whispered, unable to control his excitement.\"Inches, Robert,\" Teabing said. He glanced over at Sophie and smiled. \"Youready?\"She nodded.\"Okay, Baphomet in Hebrew without the vowels reads: B-P-V-M-Th. Now we simplyapply your Atbash substitution matrix to translate the letters into ourfive-letter password.\"Langdon's heart pounded. B-P-V-M-Th. The sun was pouring through the windowsnow. He looked at Sophie's substitution matrix and slowly began to make theconversion. B is Sh... P is V...Teabing was grinning like a schoolboy at Christmas. \"And the Atbash Cipherreveals...\" He stopped short. \"Good God!\" His face went white.Langdon's head snapped up.\"What's wrong?\" Sophie demanded.\"You won't believe this.\" Teabing glanced at Sophie. \"Especially you.\"\"What do you mean?\" she said.\"This is... ingenious,\" he whispered. \"Utterly ingenious!\" Teabing wrote againon the paper. \"Drumroll, please. Here is your password.\" He showed them what hehad written. Sh-V-P-Y-A Sophie scowled. \"What is it?\"Langdon didn't recognize it either.Teabing's voice seemed to tremble with awe. \"This, my friend, is actually anancient word of wisdom.\"Langdon read the letters again. An ancient word of wisdom frees this scroll. Aninstant later he got it. He had newer seen this coming. \"An ancient word ofwisdom!\"Teabing was laughing. \"Quite literally!\"Sophie looked at the word and then at the dial. Immediately she realized Langdonand Teabing had failed to see a serious glitch. \"Hold on! This can't be thepassword,\" she argued. \"The cryptex doesn't have an Sh on the dial. It uses atraditional Roman alphabet.\"\"Read the word,\" Langdon urged. \"Keep in mind two things. In Hebrew, the symbolfor the sound Sh can also be pronounced as S, depending on the accent. Just asthe letter P can be pronounced F.\"SVFYA? she thought, puzzled.\"Genius!\" Teabing added. \"The letter Vav is often a placeholder for the vowelsound O!\"Sophie again looked at the letters, attempting to sound them out.\"S...o...f...y...a.\"She heard the sound of her voice, and could not believe what she had just said.\"Sophia? This spells Sophia?\"Langdon was nodding enthusiastically. \"Yes! Sophia literally means wisdom inGreek. The root of your name, Sophie, is literally a 'word of wisdom.' \"Sophie suddenly missed her grandfather immensely. He encrypted the Priorykeystone with my name. A knot caught in her throat. It all seemed so perfect.But as she turned her gaze to the five lettered dials on the cryptex, sherealized a problem still existed. \"But wait... the word Sophia has six letters.\"Teabing's smile never faded. \"Look at the poem again. Your grandfather wrote,'An ancient word of wisdom.' \"\"Yes?\"Teabing winked. \"In ancient Greek, wisdom is spelled S-O-F-I-A.\" CHAPTER 78Sophie felt a wild excitement as she cradled the cryptex and began dialing inthe letters. An ancient word of wisdom frees this scroll. Langdon and Teabingseemed to have stopped breathing as they looked on.S... O... F...\"Carefully,\" Teabing urged. \"Ever so carefully.\"...I... A.Sophie aligned the final dial. \"Okay,\" she whispered, glancing up at the others.\"I'm going to pull it apart.\"\"Remember the vinegar,\" Langdon whispered with fearful exhilaration. \"Becareful.\"Sophie knew that if this cryptex were like those she had opened in her youth,all she would need to do is grip the cylinder at both ends, just beyond thedials, and pull, applying slow, steady pressure in opposite directions. If thedials were properly aligned with the password, then one of the ends would slideoff, much like a lens cap, and she could reach inside and remove the rolledpapyrus document, which would be wrapped around the vial of vinegar. However, ifthe password they had entered were incorrect, Sophie's outward force on the endswould be transferred to a hinged lever inside, which would pivot downward intothe cavity and apply pressure to the glass vial, eventually shattering it if shepulled too hard.Pull gently, she told herself.Teabing and Langdon both leaned in as Sophie wrapped her palms around the endsof the cylinder. In the excitement of deciphering the code word, Sophie hadalmost forgotten what they expected to find inside. This is the Priory keystone.According to Teabing, it contained a map to the Holy Grail, unveiling the tombof Mary Magdalene and the Sangreal treasure... the ultimate treasure trove ofsecret truth.Now gripping the stone tube, Sophie double-checked that all of the letters wereproperly aligned with the indicator. Then, slowly, she pulled. Nothing happened.She applied a little more force. Suddenly, the stone slid apart like awell-crafted telescope. The heavy end piece detached in her hand. Langdon andTeabing almost jumped to their feet. Sophie's heart rate climbed as she set theend cap on the table and tipped the cylinder to peer inside.A scroll!Peering down the hollow of the rolled paper, Sophie could see it had beenwrapped around a cylindrical object—the vial of vinegar, she assumed. Strangely,though, the paper around the vinegar was not the customary delicate papyrus butrather, vellum. That's odd, she thought, vinegar can't dissolve a lambskinvellum. She looked again down the hollow of the scroll and realized the objectin the center was not a vial of vinegar after all. It was something elseentirely.\"What's wrong?\" Teabing asked. \"Pull out the scroll.\"Frowning, Sophie grabbed the rolled vellum and the object around which it waswrapped, pulling them both out of the container.\"That's not papyrus,\" Teabing said. \"It's too heavy.\"\"I know. It's padding.\"\"For what? The vial of vinegar?\"\"No.\" Sophie unrolled the scroll and revealed what was wrapped inside. \"Forthis.\"When Langdon saw the object inside the sheet of vellum, his heart sank.\"God help us,\" Teabing said, slumping. \"Your grandfather was a pitilessarchitect.\"Langdon stared in amazement. I see Saunière has no intention of making thiseasy.On the table sat a second cryptex. Smaller. Made of black onyx. It had beennested within the first. Saunière's passion for dualism. Two cryptexes.Everything in pairs. Double entendres. Male female. Black nested within white.Langdon felt the web of symbolism stretching onward. White gives birth to black.Every man sprang from woman.White—female.Black—male.Reaching over, Langdon lifted the smaller cryptex. It looked identical to thefirst, except half the size and black. He heard the familiar gurgle. Apparently,the vial of vinegar they had heard earlier was inside this smaller cryptex.\"Well, Robert,\" Teabing said, sliding the page of vellum over to him.\"You'll be pleased to hear that at least we're flying in the right direction.\"Langdon examined the thick vellum sheet. Written in ornate penmanship wasanother four-line verse. Again, in iambic pentameter. The verse was cryptic, butLangdon needed to read only as far as the first line to realize that Teabing'splan to come to Britain was going to pay off. IN LONDON LIES A KNIGHT A POPE INTERRED. The remainder of the poem clearly implied that the password for opening thesecond cryptex could be found by visiting this knight's tomb, somewhere in thecity.Langdon turned excitedly to Teabing. \"Do you have any idea what knight this poemis referring to?\"Teabing grinned. \"Not the foggiest. But I know in precisely which crypt weshould look.\" At that moment, fifteen miles ahead of them, six Kent police cars streaked downrain-soaked streets toward Biggin Hill Executive Airport. CHAPTER 79Lieutenant Collet helped himself to a Perrier from Teabing's refrigerator andstrode back out through the drawing room. Rather than accompanying Fache toLondon where the action was, he was now baby-sitting the PTS team that hadspread out through Château Villette.So far, the evidence they had uncovered was unhelpful: a single bullet buried inthe floor; a paper with several symbols scrawled on it along with the wordsblade and chalice; and a bloody spiked belt that PTS had told Collet wasassociated with the conservative Catholic group Opus Dei, which had caused astir recently when a news program exposed their aggressive recruiting practicesin Paris.Collet sighed. Good luck making sense of this unlikely mélange.Moving down a lavish hallway, Collet entered the vast ballroom study, where thechief PTS examiner was busy dusting for fingerprints. He was a corpulent man insuspenders.\"Anything?\" Collet asked, entering.The examiner shook his head. \"Nothing new. Multiple sets matching those in therest of the house.\"\"How about the prints on the cilice belt?\"\"Interpol is still working. I uploaded everything we found.\"Collet motioned to two sealed evidence bags on the desk. \"And this?\"The man shrugged. \"Force of habit. I bag anything peculiar.\"Collet walked over. Peculiar?\"This Brit's a strange one,\" the examiner said. \"Have a look at this.\" He siftedthrough the evidence bags and selected one, handing it to Collet.The photo showed the main entrance of a Gothic cathedral—the traditional,recessed archway, narrowing through multiple, ribbed layers to a small doorway.Collet studied the photo and turned. \"This is peculiar?\"\"Turn it over.\"On the back, Collet found notations scrawled in English, describing acathedral's long hollow nave as a secret pagan tribute to a woman's womb. Thiswas strange. The notation describing the cathedral's doorway, however, was whatstartled him. \"Hold on! He thinks a cathedral's entrance represents awoman's...\"The examiner nodded. \"Complete with receding labial ridges and a nice littlecinquefoil clitoris above the doorway.\" He sighed. \"Kind of makes you want to goback to church.\"Collet picked up the second evidence bag. Through the plastic, he could see alarge glossy photograph of what appeared to be an old document. The heading atthe top read:Les Dossiers Secrets—Number 4° lm1 249\"What's this?\" Collet asked.\"No idea. He's got copies of it all over the place, so I bagged it.\"Collet studied the document."},{"pageContent":"PRIEURE DE SIGN—LES NAUTONIERS/GRAND MASTERSJEAN DE GISORS1188-1220MARIE DE SAINT-CLAIR1220-1266GUILLAUME DE GlSORS1266-1307EDOUARD DE BAR1307-1336JEANNE DE BAR1336-1351JEAN DE SAINT-CLAIR1351-1366BLANCE D'EVREUX1366-1398NICOLAS FLAMEL1398-1418RENE D'ANJOU1418-1480IOLANDE DE BAR1480-1483SANDRO BOTTICELLI1483-1510LEONARDO DA VINCI1510-1519CONNETABLE DE BOURBON1519-1527FERDINAND DE GONZAQUE1527-1575LOUIS DE NEVERS1575-1595ROBERT FLUDD1595-1637J.

Collet wondered.\"Lieutenant?\" Another agent stuck his head in. \"The switchboard has an urgentcall for Captain Fache, but they can't reach him. Will you take it?\"Collet returned to the kitchen and took the call.It was André Vernet.The banker's refined accent did little to mask the tension in his voice. \"Ithought Captain Fache said he would call me, but I have not yet heard from him.\"\"The captain is quite busy,\" Collet replied. \"May I help you?\"\"I was assured I would be kept abreast of your progress tonight.\"For a moment, Collet thought he recognized the timbre of the man's voice, but hecouldn't quite place it. \"Monsieur Vernet, I am currently in charge of the Parisinvestigation. My name is Lieutenant Collet.\"There was a long pause on the line. \"Lieutenant, I have another call coming in.Please excuse me. I will call you later.\" He hung up.For several seconds, Collet held the receiver. Then it dawned on him. I knew Irecognized that voice! The revelation made him gasp.The armored car driver.With the fake Rolex.Collet now understood why the banker had hung up so quickly. Vernet hadremembered the name Lieutenant Collet—the officer he blatantly lied to earliertonight.Collet pondered the implications of this bizarre development. Vernet isinvolved. Instinctively, he knew he should call Fache. Emotionally, he knew thislucky break was going to be his moment to shine.He immediately called Interpol and requested every shred of information theycould find on the Depository Bank of Zurich and its president, André Vernet. CHAPTER 80\"Seat belts, please,\" Teabing's pilot announced as the Hawker 731 descended intoa gloomy morning drizzle. \"We'll be landing in five minutes.\"Teabing felt a joyous sense of homecoming when he saw the misty hills of Kentspreading wide beneath the descending plane. England was less than an hour fromParis, and yet a world away. This morning, the damp, spring green of hishomeland looked particularly welcoming. My time in France is over. I amreturning to England victorious. The keystone has been found. The questionremained, of course, as to where the keystone would ultimately lead. Somewherein the United Kingdom. Where exactly, Teabing had no idea, but he was alreadytasting the glory.As Langdon and Sophie looked on, Teabing got up and went to the far side of thecabin, then slid aside a wall panel to reveal a discreetly hidden wall safe. Hedialed in the combination, opened the safe, and extracted two passports.\"Documentation for Rémy and myself.\" He then removed a thick stack offifty-pound notes. \"And documentation for you two.\"Sophie looked leery. \"A bribe?\"\"Creative diplomacy. Executive airfields make certain allowances. A Britishcustoms official will greet us at my hangar and ask to board the plane. Ratherthan permitting him to come on, I'll tell him I'm traveling with a Frenchcelebrity who prefers that nobody knows she is in England—press considerations,you know—and I'll offer the official this generous tip as gratitude for hisdiscretion.\"Langdon looked amazed. \"And the official will accept?\"\"Not from anyone, they won't, but these people all know me. I'm not an armsdealer, for heaven's sake. I was knighted.\" Teabing smiled. \"Membership has itsprivileges.\"Rémy approached up the aisle now, the Heckler Koch pistol cradled in his hand.\"Sir, my agenda?\"Teabing glanced at his servant. \"I'm going to have you stay onboard with ourguest until we return. We can't very well drag him all over London with us.\"Sophie looked wary. \"Leigh, I was serious about the French police finding yourplane before we return.\"Teabing laughed. \"Yes, imagine their surprise if they board and find Rémy.\"Sophie looked surprised by his cavalier attitude. \"Leigh, you transported abound hostage across international borders. This is serious.\"\"So are my lawyers.\" He scowled toward the monk in the rear of the plane. \"Thatanimal broke into my home and almost killed me. That is a fact, and Rémy willcorroborate.\"\"But you tied him up and flew him to London!\" Langdon said.Teabing held up his right hand and feigned a courtroom oath. \"Your honor,forgive an eccentric old knight his foolish prejudice for the British courtsystem. I realize I should have called the French authorities, but I'm a snoband do not trust those laissez-faire French to prosecute properly. This manalmost murdered me. Yes, I made a rash decision forcing my manservant to help mebring him to England, but I was under great stress. Mea culpa. Mea culpa.\"Langdon looked incredulous. \"Coming from you, Leigh, that just might fly.\"\"Sir?\" the pilot called back. \"The tower just radioed. They've got some kind ofmaintenance problem out near your hangar, and they're asking me to bring theplane directly to the terminal instead.\"Teabing had been flying to Biggin Hill for over a decade, and this was a first.\"Did they mention what the problem is?\"\"The controller was vague. Something about a gas leak at the pumping station?They asked me to park in front of the terminal and keep everyone onboard untilfurther notice. Safety precaution. We're not supposed to deplane until we getthe all clear from airport authorities.\"Teabing was skeptical. Must be one hell of a gas leak. The pumping station was agood half mile from his hangar.Rémy also looked concerned. \"Sir, this sounds highly irregular.\"Teabing turned to Sophie and Langdon. \"My friends, I have an unpleasantsuspicion that we are about to be met by a welcoming committee.\"Langdon gave a bleak sigh. \"I guess Fache still thinks I'm his man.\"\"Either that,\" Sophie said, \"or he is too deep into this to admit his error.Teabing was not listening. Regardless of Fache's mind-set, action needed to betaken fast. Don't lose sight of the ultimate goal. The Grail. We're so dose.Below them, the landing gear descended with a clunk.\"Leigh,\" Langdon said, sounding deeply remorseful, \"I should turn myself in andsort this out legally. Leave you all out of it.\"\"Oh, heavens, Robert!\" Teabing waved it off. \"Do you really think they're goingto let the rest of us go? I just transported you illegally. Miss Neveu assistedin your escape from the Louvre, and we have a man tied up in the back of theplane. Really now! We're all in this together.\"\"Maybe a different airport?\" Sophie said.Teabing shook his head. \"If we pull up now, by the time we get clearanceanywhere else, our welcoming party will include army tanks.\"Sophie slumped.Teabing sensed that if they were to have any chance of postponing confrontationwith the British authorities long enough to find the Grail, bold action had tobe taken. \"Give me a minute,\" he said, hobbling toward the cockpit.\"What are you doing?\" Langdon asked.\"Sales meeting,\" Teabing said, wondering how much it would cost him to persuadehis pilot to perform one highly irregular maneuver. CHAPTER 81The Hawker is on final approach.Simon Edwards—Executive Services Officer at Biggin Hill Airport—paced thecontrol tower, squinting nervously at the rain-drenched runway. He neverappreciated being awoken early on a Saturday morning, but it was particularlydistasteful that he had been called in to oversee the arrest of one of his mostlucrative clients. Sir Leigh Teabing paid Biggin Hill not only for a privatehangar but a \"per landing fee\" for his frequent arrivals and departures.Usually, the airfield had advance warning of his schedule and was able to followa strict protocol for his arrival. Teabing liked things just so. Thecustom-built Jaguar stretch limousine that he kept in his hangar was to be fullygassed, polished, and the day's London Times laid out on the back seat. Acustoms official was to be waiting for the plane at the hangar to expedite themandatory documentation and luggage check. Occasionally, customs agents acceptedlarge tips from Teabing in exchange for turning a blind eye to the transport ofharmless organics—mostly luxury foods—French escargots, a particularly ripeunprocessed Roquefort, certain fruits. Many customs laws were absurd, anyway,and if Biggin Hill didn't accommodate its clients, certainly competing airfieldswould. Teabing was provided with what he wanted here at Biggin Hill, and theemployees reaped the benefits.Edwards's nerves felt frayed now as he watched the jet coming in. He wondered ifTeabing's penchant for spreading the wealth had gotten him in trouble somehow;the French authorities seemed very intent on containing him. Edwards had not yetbeen told what the charges were, but they were obviously serious. At the Frenchauthorities' request, Kent police had ordered the Biggin Hill air trafficcontroller to radio the Hawker's pilot and order him directly to the terminalrather than to the client's hangar. The pilot had agreed, apparently believingthe far-fetched story of a gas leak.Though the British police did not generally carry weapons, the gravity of thesituation had brought out an armed response team. Now, eight policemen withhandguns stood just inside the terminal building, awaiting the moment when theplane's engines powered down. The instant this happened, a runway attendantwould place safety wedges under the tires so the plane could no longer move.Then the police would step into view and hold the occupants at bay until theFrench police arrived to handle the situation.The Hawker was low in the sky now, skimming the treetops to their right. SimonEdwards went downstairs to watch the landing from tarmac level. The Kent policewere poised, just out of sight, and the maintenance man waited with his wedges.Out on the runway, the Hawker's nose tipped up, and the tires touched down in apuff of smoke. The plane settled in for deceleration, streaking from right toleft in front of the terminal, its white hull glistening in the wet weather. Butrather than braking and turning into the terminal, the jet coasted calmly pastthe access lane and continued on toward Teabing's hangar in the distance.All the police spun and stared at Edwards. \"I thought you said the pilot agreedto come to the terminal!\"Edwards was bewildered. \"He did!\"Seconds later, Edwards found himself wedged in a police car racing across thetarmac toward the distant hangar. The convoy of police was still a good fivehundred yards away as Teabing's Hawker taxied calmly into the private hangar anddisappeared. When the cars finally arrived and skidded to a stop outside thegaping hangar door, the police poured out, guns drawn.Edwards jumped out too.The noise was deafening.The Hawker's engines were still roaring as the jet finished its usual rotationinside the hangar, positioning itself nose-out in preparation for laterdeparture. As the plane completed its 180-degree turn and rolled toward thefront of the hangar, Edwards could see the pilot's face, which understandablylooked surprised and fearful to see the barricade of police cars.The pilot brought the plane to a final stop, and powered down the engines. Thepolice streamed in, taking up positions around the jet. Edwards joined the Kentchief inspector, who moved warily toward the hatch. After several seconds, thefuselage door popped open.Leigh Teabing appeared in the doorway as the plane's electronic stairs smoothlydropped down. As he gazed out at the sea of weapons aimed at him, he proppedhimself on his crutches and scratched his head. \"Simon, did I win thepolicemen's lottery while I was away?\" He sounded more bewildered thanconcerned.Simon Edwards stepped forward, swallowing the frog in his throat. \"Good morning,sir. I apologize for the confusion. We've had a gas leak and your pilot said hewas coming to the terminal.\"\"Yes, yes, well, I told him to come here instead. I'm late for an appointment. Ipay for this hangar, and this rubbish about avoiding a gas leak soundedovercautious.\"\"I'm afraid your arrival has taken us a bit off guard, sir.\"\"I know. I'm off my schedule, I am. Between you and me, the new medication givesme the tinkles. Thought I'd come over for a tune-up.\"The policemen all exchanged looks. Edwards winced. \"Very good, sir.\"\"Sir,\" the Kent chief inspector said, stepping forward. \"I need to ask you tostay onboard for another half hour or so.\"Teabing looked unamused as he hobbled down the stairs. \"I'm afraid that isimpossible. I have a medical appointment.\" He reached the tarmac. \"I cannotafford to miss it.\"The chief inspector repositioned himself to block Teabing's progress away fromthe plane. \"I am here at the orders of the French Judicial Police. They claimyou are transporting fugitives from the law on this plane.\"Teabing stared at the chief inspector a long moment, and then burst outlaughing. \"Is this one of those hidden camera programs? Jolly good!\"The chief inspector never flinched. \"This is serious, sir. The French policeclaim you also may have a hostage onboard.\"Teabing's manservant Rémy appeared in the doorway at the top of the stairs. \"Ifeel like a hostage working for Sir Leigh, but he assures me I am free to go.\"Rémy checked his watch. \"Master, we really are running late.\" He nodded towardthe Jaguar stretch limousine in the far corner of the hangar. The enormousautomobile was ebony with smoked glass and whitewall tires. \"I'll bring thecar.\" Rémy started down the stairs.\"I'm afraid we cannot let you leave,\" the chief inspector said. \"Please returnto your aircraft. Both of you. Representatives from the French police will belanding shortly.\"Teabing looked now toward Simon Edwards. \"Simon, for heaven's sake, this isridiculous! We don't have anyone else on board. Just the usual—Rémy, our pilot,and myself. Perhaps you could act as an intermediary? Go have a look onboard,and verify that the plane is empty.\"Edwards knew he was trapped. \"Yes, sir. I can have a look.\"\"The devil you will!\" the Kent chief inspector declared, apparently knowingenough about executive airfields to suspect Simon Edwards might well lie aboutthe plane's occupants in an effort to keep Teabing's business at Biggin Hill. \"Iwill look myself.\"Teabing shook his head. \"No you won't, Inspector. This is private property anduntil you have a search warrant, you will stay off my plane. I am offering you areasonable option here. Mr. Edwards can perform the inspection.\"\"No deal.\"Teabing's demeanor turned frosty. \"Inspector, I'm afraid I don't have time toindulge in your games. I'm late, and I'm leaving. If it is that important to youto stop me, you'll just have to shoot me.\" With that, Teabing and Rémy walkedaround the chief inspector and headed across the hangar toward the parkedlimousine. The Kent chief inspector felt only distaste for Leigh Teabing as the man hobbledaround him in defiance. Men of privilege always felt like they were above thelaw.They are not. The chief inspector turned and aimed at Teabing's back. \"Stop! Iwill fire!\"\"Go ahead,\" Teabing said without breaking stride or glancing back. \"My lawyerswill fricassee your testicles for breakfast. And if you dare board my planewithout a warrant, your spleen will follow.\"No stranger to power plays, the chief inspector was unimpressed. Technically,Teabing was correct and the police needed a warrant to board his jet, butbecause the flight had originated in France, and because the powerful Bezu Fachehad given his authority, the Kent chief inspector felt certain his career wouldbe far better served by finding out what it was on this plane that Teabingseemed so intent on hiding.\"Stop them,\" the inspector ordered. \"I'm searching the plane.\"His men raced over, guns leveled, and physically blocked Teabing and his servantfrom reaching the limousine.Now Teabing turned. \"Inspector, this is your last warning. Do not even think ofboarding that plane. You will regret it.\"Ignoring the threat, the chief inspector gripped his sidearm and marched up theplane's gangway. Arriving at the hatch, he peered inside. After a moment, hestepped into the cabin. What the devil?With the exception of the frightened-looking pilot in the cockpit, the aircraftwas empty. Entirely devoid of human life. Quickly checking the bathroom, thechairs, and the luggage areas, the inspector found no traces of anyone hiding...much less multiple individuals.What the hell was Bezu Fache thinking? It seemed Leigh Teabing had been tellingthe truth.The Kent chief inspector stood alone in the deserted cabin and swallowed hard.Shit. His face flushed, he stepped back onto the gangway, gazing across thehangar at Leigh Teabing and his servant, who were now under gunpoint near thelimousine. \"Let them go,\" the inspector ordered. \"We received a bad tip.\"Teabing's eyes were menacing even across the hangar. \"You can expect a call frommy lawyers. And for future reference, the French police cannot be trusted.\"With that, Teabing's manservant opened the door at the rear of the stretchlimousine and helped his crippled master into the back seat. Then the servantwalked the length of the car, climbed in behind the wheel, and gunned theengine. Policemen scattered as the Jaguar peeled out of the hangar. \"Well played, my good man,\" Teabing chimed from the rear seat as the limousineaccelerated out of the airport. He turned his eyes now to the dimly lit frontrecesses of the spacious interior. \"Everyone comfy?\"Langdon gave a weak nod. He and Sophie were still crouched on the floor besidethe bound and gagged albino.Moments earlier, as the Hawker taxied into the deserted hangar, Rémy had poppedthe hatch as the plane jolted to a stop halfway through its turn. With thepolice closing in fast, Langdon and Sophie dragged the monk down the gangway toground level and out of sight behind the limousine. Then the jet engines hadroared again, rotating the plane and completing its turn as the police cars cameskidding into the hangar.Now, as the limousine raced toward Kent, Langdon and Sophie clambered toward therear of the limo's long interior, leaving the monk bound on the floor. Theysettled onto the long seat facing Teabing. The Brit gave them both a roguishsmile and opened the cabinet on the limo's bar. \"Could I offer you a drink? Somenibblies? Crisps? Nuts? Seltzer?\"Sophie and Langdon both shook their heads.Teabing grinned and closed the bar. \"So then, about this knight's tomb...\" CHAPTER 82\"Fleet Street?\" Langdon asked, eyeing Teabing in the back of the limo. There's acrypt on Fleet Street? So far, Leigh was being playfully cagey about where hethought they would find the \"knight's tomb,\" which, according to the poem, wouldprovide the password for opening the smaller cryptex.Teabing grinned and turned to Sophie. \"Miss Neveu, give the Harvard boy one moreshot at the verse, will you?\"Sophie fished in her pocket and pulled out the black cryptex, which was wrappedin the vellum. Everyone had decided to leave the rosewood box and larger cryptexbehind in the plane's strongbox, carrying with them only what they needed, thefar more portable and discreet black cryptex. Sophie unwrapped the vellum andhanded the sheet to Langdon.Although Langdon had read the poem several times onboard the jet, he had beenunable to extract any specific location. Now, as he read the words again, heprocessed them slowly and carefully, hoping the pentametric rhythms would reveala clearer meaning now that he was on the ground. In London lies a knight a Pope interred.His labor's fruit a Holy wrath incurred.You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb. The language seemed simple enough. There was a knight buried in London. A knightwho labored at something that angered the Church. A knight whose tomb wasmissing an orb that should be present. The poem's final reference—Rosy flesh andseeded womb—was a clear allusion to Mary Magdalene, the Rose who bore the seedof Jesus.Despite the apparent straightforwardness of the verse, Langdon still had no ideawho this knight was or where he was buried. Moreover, once they located thetomb, it sounded as if they would be searching for something that was absent.The orb that ought be on his tomb?\"No thoughts?\" Teabing clucked in disappointment, although Langdon sensed theRoyal Historian was enjoying being one up. \"Miss Neveu?\"She shook her head.\"What would you two do without me?\" Teabing said. \"Very well, I will walk youthrough it. It's quite simple really. The first line is the key. Would you readit please?\"Langdon read aloud. \" 'In London lies a knight a Pope interred.' \"\"Precisely. A knight a Pope interred.\" He eyed Langdon. \"What does that mean toyou?\"Langdon shrugged. \"A knight buried by a Pope? A knight whose funeral waspresided over by a Pope?\"Teabing laughed loudly. \"Oh, that's rich. Always the optimist, Robert. Look atthe second line. This knight obviously did something that incurred the Holywrath of the Church. Think again. Consider the dynamic between the Church andthe Knights Templar. A knight a Pope interred?\"\"A knight a Pope killed?\" Sophie asked.Teabing smiled and patted her knee. \"Well done, my dear. A knight a Pope buried.Or killed.\"Langdon thought of the notorious Templar round-up in 1307—unlucky Friday thethirteenth—when Pope Clement killed and interred hundreds of Knights Templar.\"But there must be endless graves of 'knights killed by Popes.' \"\"Aha, not so! \"Teabing said. \"Many of them were burned at the stake and tossedunceremoniously into the Tiber River. But this poem refers to a tomb. A tomb inLondon. And there are few knights buried in London.\" He paused, eyeing Langdonas if waiting for light to dawn. Finally he huffed. \"Robert, for heaven's sake!The church built in London by the Priory's military arm—the Knights Templarthemselves!\"\"The Temple Church?\" Langdon drew a startled breath. \"It has a crypt?\"\"Ten of the most frightening tombs you will ever see.\"Langdon had never actually visited the Temple Church, although he'd come acrossnumerous references in his Priory research. Once the epicenter of allTemplar/Priory activities in the United Kingdom, the Temple Church had been sonamed in honor of Solomon's Temple, from which the Knights Templar had extractedtheir own title, as well as the Sangreal documents that gave them all theirinfluence in Rome. Tales abounded of knights performing strange, secretiverituals within the Temple Church's unusual sanctuary. \"The Temple Church is onFleet Street?\"\"Actually, it's just off Fleet Street on Inner Temple Lane.\" Teabing lookedmischievous. \"I wanted to see you sweat a little more before I gave it away.\"\"Thanks.\"\"Neither of you has ever been there?\"Sophie and Langdon shook their heads.\"I'm not surprised,\" Teabing said. \"The church is hidden now behind much largerbuildings. Few people even know it's there. Eerie old place. The architecture ispagan to the core.\"Sophie looked surprised. \"Pagan?\"\"Pantheonically pagan!\" Teabing exclaimed. \"The church is round. The Templarsignored the traditional Christian cruciform layout and built a perfectlycircular church in honor of the sun.\" His eyebrows did a devilish dance. \"A notso subtle howdy-do to the boys in Rome. They might as well have resurrectedStonehenge in downtown London.\"Sophie eyed Teabing. \"What about the rest of the poem?\"The historian's mirthful air faded. \"I'm not sure. It's puzzling. We will needto examine each of the ten tombs carefully. With luck, one of them will have aconspicuously absent orb.\"Langdon realized how close they really were. If the missing orb revealed thepassword, they would be able to open the second cryptex. He had a hard timeimagining what they might find inside.Langdon eyed the poem again. It was like some kind of primordial crosswordpuzzle. A five-letter word that speaks of the Grail? On the plane, they hadalready tried all the obvious passwords—GRAIL, GRAAL, GREAL, VENUS, MARIA,JESUS, SARAH—but the cylinder had not budged. Far too obvious. Apparently thereexisted some other five-letter reference to the Rose's seeded womb. The factthat the word was eluding a specialist like Leigh Teabing signified to Langdonthat it was no ordinary Grail reference.\"Sir Leigh?\" Rémy called over his shoulder. He was watching them in the rearviewmirror through the open divider. \"You said Fleet Street is near BlackfriarsBridge?\"\"Yes, take Victoria Embankment.\"\"I'm sorry. I'm not sure where that is. We usually go only to the hospital.\"Teabing rolled his eyes at Langdon and Sophie and grumbled, \"I swear, sometimesit's like baby-sitting a child. One moment please. Help yourself to a drink andsavory snacks.\" He left them, clambering awkwardly toward the open divider totalk to Rémy.Sophie turned to Langdon now, her voice quiet. \"Robert, nobody knows you and Iare in England.\"Langdon realized she was right. The Kent police would tell Fache the plane wasempty, and Fache would have to assume they were still in France. We areinvisible. Leigh's little stunt had just bought them a lot of time.\"Fache will not give up easily,\" Sophie said. \"He has too much riding on thisarrest now.\"Langdon had been trying not to think about Fache. Sophie had promised she woulddo everything in her power to exonerate Langdon once this was over, but Langdonwas starting to fear it might not matter. Fache could easily be pan of thisplot. Although Langdon could not imagine the Judicial Police tangled up in theHoly Grail, he sensed too much coincidence tonight to disregard Fache as apossible accomplice. Fache is religions, and he is intent on pinning thesemurders on me. Then again, Sophie had argued that Fache might simply beoverzealous to make the arrest. After all, the evidence against Langdon wassubstantial. In addition to Langdon's name scrawled on the Louvre floor and inSaunière's date book, Langdon now appeared to have lied about his manuscript andthen run away. At Sophie's suggestion.\"Robert, I'm sorry you're so deeply involved,\" Sophie said, placing her hand onhis knee. \"But I'm very glad you're here.\"The comment sounded more pragmatic than romantic, and yet Langdon felt anunexpected flicker of attraction between them. He gave her a tired smile. \"I'm alot more fun when I've slept.\"Sophie was silent for several seconds. \"My grandfather asked me to trust you.I'm glad I listened to him for once.\"\"Your grandfather didn't even know me.\"\"Even so, I can't help but think you've done everything he would have wanted.You helped me find the keystone, explained the Sangreal, told me about theritual in the basement.\" She paused. \"Somehow I feel closer to my grandfathertonight than I have in years. I know he would be happy about that.\"In the distance, now, the skyline of London began to materialize through thedawn drizzle. Once dominated by Big Ben and Tower Bridge, the horizon now bowedto the Millennium Eye—a colossal, ultramodern Ferris wheel that climbed fivehundred feet and afforded breathtaking views of the city. Langdon had attemptedto board it once, but the \"viewing capsules\" reminded him of sealed sarcophagi,and he opted to keep his feet on the ground and enjoy the view from the airybanks of the Thames.Langdon felt a squeeze on his knee, pulling him back, and Sophie's green eyeswere on him. He realized she had been speaking to him. \"What do you think weshould do with the Sangreal documents if we ever find them?\" she whispered.\"What I think is immaterial,\" Langdon said. \"Your grandfather gave the cryptexto you, and you should do with it what your instinct tells you he would wantdone.\"\"I'm asking for your opinion. You obviously wrote something in that manuscriptthat made my grandfather trust your judgment. He scheduled a private meetingwith you. That's rare.\"\"Maybe he wanted to tell me I have it all wrong.\"\"Why would he tell me to find you unless he liked your ideas? In yourmanuscript, did you support the idea that the Sangreal documents should berevealed or stay buried?\"\"Neither. I made no judgment either way. The manuscript deals with the symbologyof the sacred feminine—tracing her iconography throughout history. I certainlydidn't presume to know where the Grail is hidden or whether it should ever berevealed.\"\"And yet you're writing a book about it, so you obviously feel the informationshould be shared.\"\"There's an enormous difference between hypothetically discussing an alternatehistory of Christ, and...\" He paused.\"And what?\"\"And presenting to the world thousands of ancient documents as scientificevidence that the New Testament is false testimony.\"\"But you told me the New Testament is based on fabrications.\"Langdon smiled. \"Sophie, every faith in the world is based on fabrication. Thatis the definition of faith—acceptance of that which we imagine to be true, thatwhich we cannot prove. Every religion describes God through metaphor, allegory,and exaggeration, from the early Egyptians through modern Sunday school.Metaphors are a way to help our minds process the unprocessible. The problemsarise when we begin to believe literally in our own metaphors.\"\"So you are in favor of the Sangreal documents staying buried forever?\"\"I'm a historian. I'm opposed to the destruction of documents, and I would loveto see religious scholars have more information to ponder the exceptional lifeof Jesus Christ.\"\"You're arguing both sides of my question.\"\"Am I? The Bible represents a fundamental guidepost for millions of people onthe planet, in much the same way the Koran, Torah, and Pali Canon offer guidanceto people of other religions. If you and I could dig up documentation thatcontradicted the holy stories of Islamic belief, Judaic belief, Buddhist belief,pagan belief, should we do that? Should we wave a flag and tell the Buddhiststhat we have proof the Buddha did not come from a lotus blossom? Or that Jesuswas not born of a literal virgin birth? Those who truly understand their faithsunderstand the stories are metaphorical.\"Sophie looked skeptical. \"My friends who are devout Christians definitelybelieve that Christ literally walked on water, literally turned water into wine,and was born of a literal virgin birth.\"\"My point exactly,\" Langdon said. \"Religious allegory has become a part of thefabric of reality. And living in that reality helps millions of people cope andbe better people.\"\"But it appears their reality is false.\"Langdon chuckled. \"No more false than that of a mathematical cryptographer whobelieves in the imaginary number 'i' because it helps her break codes.\"Sophie frowned. \"That's not fair.\"A moment passed.\"What was your question again?\" Langdon asked.\"I can't remember.\"He smiled. \"Works every time.\" CHAPTER 83Langdon's Mickey Mouse wristwatch read almost seven-thirty when he emerged fromthe Jaguar limousine onto Inner Temple Lane with Sophie and Teabing. Thethreesome wound through a maze of buildings to a small courtyard outside theTemple Church. The rough-hewn stone shimmered in the rain, and doves cooed inthe architecture overhead.London's ancient Temple Church was constructed entirely of Caen stone. Adramatic, circular edifice with a daunting facade, a central turret, and aprotruding nave off one side, the church looked more like a military strongholdthan a place of worship. Consecrated on the tenth of February in 1185 byHeraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, the Temple Church survived eight centuries ofpolitical turmoil, the Great Fire of London, and the First World War, only to beheavily damaged by Luftwaffe incendiary bombs in 1940. After the war, it wasrestored to its original, stark grandeur.The simplicity of the circle, Langdon thought, admiring the building for thefirst time. The architecture was coarse and simple, more reminiscent of Rome'srugged Castel Sant'Angelo than the refined Pantheon. The boxy annex jutting outto the right was an unfortunate eyesore, although it did little to shroud theoriginal pagan shape of the primary structure.\"It's early on a Saturday,\" Teabing said, hobbling toward the entrance, \"so I'massuming we won't have services to deal with.\"The church's entryway was a recessed stone niche inside which stood a largewooden door. To the left of the door, looking entirely out of place, hung abulletin board covered with concert schedules and religious serviceannouncements.Teabing frowned as he read the board. \"They don't open to sightseers for anothercouple of hours.\" He moved to the door and tried it. The door didn't budge.Putting his ear to the wood, he listened. After a moment, he pulled back, ascheming look on his face as he pointed to the bulletin board. \"Robert, checkthe service schedule, will you? Who is presiding this week?\" Inside the church, an altar boy was almost finished vacuuming the communionkneelers when he heard a knocking on the sanctuary door. He ignored it. FatherHarvey Knowles had his own keys and was not due for another couple of hours. Theknocking was probably a curious tourist or indigent. The altar boy keptvacuuming, but the knocking continued. Can't you read? The sign on the doorclearly stated that the church did not open until nine-thirty on Saturday. Thealtar boy remained with his chores.Suddenly, the knocking turned to a forceful banging, as if someone were hittingthe door with a metal rod. The young man switched off his vacuum cleaner andmarched angrily toward the door. Unlatching it from within, he swung it open.Three people stood in the entryway. Tourists, he grumbled. \"We open atnine-thirty.\"The heavyset man, apparently the leader, stepped forward using metal crutches.\"I am Sir Leigh Teabing,\" he said, his accent a highbrow, Saxonesque British.\"As you are no doubt aware, I am escorting Mr. and Mrs. Christopher Wren theFourth.\" He stepped aside, flourishing his arm toward the attractive couplebehind them. The woman was soft-featured, with lush burgundy hair. The man wastall, dark-haired, and looked vaguely familiar.The altar boy had no idea how to respond. Sir Christopher Wren was the TempleChurch's most famous benefactor. He had made possible all the restorationsfollowing damage caused by the Great Fire. He had also been dead since the earlyeighteenth century. \"Um... an honor to meet you?\"The man on crutches frowned. \"Good thing you're not in sales, young man, you'renot very convincing. Where is Father Knowles?\"\"It's Saturday. He's not due in until later.\"The crippled man's scowl deepened. \"There's gratitude. He assured us he would behere, but it looks like we'll do it without him. It won't take long.\"The altar boy remained blocking the doorway. \"I'm sorry, what won't take long?\"The visitor's eyes sharpened now, and he leaned forward whispering as if to saveeveryone some embarrassment. \"Young man, apparently you are new here. Every yearSir Christopher Wren's descendants bring a pinch of the old man's ashes toscatter in the Temple sanctuary. It is part of his last will and testament.Nobody is particularly happy about making the trip, but what can we do?\"The altar boy had been here a couple of years but had never heard of thiscustom. \"It would be better if you waited until nine-thirty. The church isn'topen yet, and I'm not finished hoovering.\"The man on crutches glared angrily. \"Young man, the only reason there's anythingleft of this building for you to hoover is on account of the gentleman in thatwoman's pocket.\"\"I'm sorry?\"\"Mrs. Wren,\" the man on crutches said, \"would you be so kind as to show thisimpertinent young man the reliquary of ashes?\"The woman hesitated a moment and then, as if awaking from a trance, reached inher sweater pocket and pulled out a small cylinder wrapped in protective fabric.\"There, you see?\" the man on crutches snapped. \"Now, you can either grant hisdying wish and let us sprinkle his ashes in the sanctuary, or I tell FatherKnowles how we've been treated.\"The altar boy hesitated, well acquainted with Father Knowles' deep observance ofchurch tradition... and, more importantly, with his foul temper when anythingcast this time-honored shrine in anything but favorable light. Maybe FatherKnowles had simply forgotten these family members were coming. If so, then therewas far more risk in turning them away than in letting them in. After all, theysaid it would only take a minute. What harm could it do?When the altar boy stepped aside to let the three people pass, he could havesworn Mr. and Mrs. Wren looked just as bewildered by all of this as he was.Uncertain, the boy returned to his chores, watching them out of the corner ofhis eye. Langdon had to smile as the threesome moved deeper into the church.\"Leigh,\" he whispered, \"you lie entirely too well.\"Teabing's eyes twinkled. \"Oxford Theatre Club. They still talk of my JuliusCaesar. I'm certain nobody has ever performed the first scene of Act Three withmore dedication.\"Langdon glanced over. \"I thought Caesar was dead in that scene.\"Teabing smirked. \"Yes, but my toga tore open when I fell, and I had to lie onstage for half an hour with my todger hanging out. Even so, I never moved amuscle. I was brilliant, I tell you.\"Langdon cringed. Sorry I missed it.As the group moved through the rectangular annex toward the archway leading intothe main church, Langdon was surprised by the barren austerity. Although thealtar layout resembled that of a linear Christian chapel, the furnishings werestark and cold, bearing none of the traditional ornamentation. \"Bleak,\" hewhispered.Teabing chuckled. \"Church of England. Anglicans drink their religion straight.Nothing to distract from their misery.\"Sophie motioned through the vast opening that gave way to the circular sectionof the church. \"It looks like a fortress in there,\" she whispered.Langdon agreed. Even from here, the walls looked unusually robust.\"The Knights Templar were warriors,\" Teabing reminded, the sound of his aluminumcrutches echoing in this reverberant space. \"A religio-military society. Theirchurches were their strongholds and their banks.\"\"Banks?\" Sophie asked, glancing at Leigh.\"Heavens, yes. The Templars invented the concept of modern banking. For Europeannobility, traveling with gold was perilous, so the Templars allowed nobles todeposit gold in their nearest Temple Church and then draw it from any otherTemple Church across Europe. All they needed was proper documentation.\" Hewinked. \"And a small commission. They were the original ATMs.\" Teabing pointedtoward a stained-glass window where the breaking sun was refracting through awhite-clad knight riding a rose-colored horse. \"Alanus Marcel,\" Teabing said,\"Master of the Temple in the early twelve hundreds. He and his successorsactually held the Parliamentary chair of Primus Baro Angiae.\"Langdon was surprised. \"First Baron of the Realm?\"Teabing nodded. \"The Master of the Temple, some claim, held more influence thanthe king himself.\" As they arrived outside the circular chamber, Teabing shot aglance over his shoulder at the altar boy, who was vacuuming in the distance.\"You know,\" Teabing whispered to Sophie, \"the Holy Grail is said to once havebeen stored in this church overnight while the Templars moved it from one hidingplace to another. Can you imagine the four chests of Sangreal documents sittingright here with Mary Magdalene's sarcophagus? It gives me gooseflesh.\"Langdon was feeling gooseflesh too as they stepped into the circular chamber.His eye traced the curvature of the chamber's pale stone perimeter, taking inthe carvings of gargoyles, demons, monsters, and pained human faces, all staringinward. Beneath the carvings, a single stone pew curled around the entirecircumference of the room.\"Theater in the round,\" Langdon whispered.Teabing raised a crutch, pointing toward the far left of the room and then tothe far right. Langdon had already seen them.Ten stone knights.Five on the left. Five on the right.Lying prone on the floor, the carved, life-sized figures rested in peacefulposes. The knights were depicted wearing full armor, shields, and swords, andthe tombs gave Langdon the uneasy sensation that someone had snuck in and pouredplaster over the knights while they were sleeping. All of the figures weredeeply weathered, and yet each was clearly unique—different armory pieces,distinct leg and arm positions, facial features, and markings on their shields.In London lies a knight a Pope interred.Langdon felt shaky as he inched deeper into the circular room.This had to be the place. CHAPTER 84In a rubbish-strewn alley very close to Temple Church, Rémy Legaludec pulled theJaguar limousine to a stop behind a row of industrial waste bins. Killing theengine, he checked the area. Deserted. He got out of the car, walked toward therear, and climbed back into the limousine's main cabin where the monk was.Sensing Rémy's presence, the monk in the back emerged from a prayer-like trance,his red eyes looking more curious than fearful. All evening Rémy had beenimpressed with this trussed man's ability to stay calm. After some initialstruggles in the Range Rover, the monk seemed to have accepted his plight andgiven over his fate to a higher power.Loosening his bow tie, Rémy unbuttoned his high, starched, wing-tipped collarand felt as if he could breathe for the first time in years. He went to thelimousine's wet bar, where he poured himself a Smirnoff vodka. He drank it in asingle swallow and followed it with a second.Soon I will be a man of leisure.Searching the bar, Rémy found a standard service wine-opener and flicked openthe sharp blade. The knife was usually employed to slice the lead foil fromcorks on fine bottles of wine, but it would serve a far more dramatic purposethis morning. Rémy turned and faced Silas, holding up the glimmering blade.Now those red eyes flashed fear.Rémy smiled and moved toward the back of the limousine. The monk recoiled,struggling against his bonds.\"Be still,\" Rémy whispered, raising the blade.Silas could not believe that God had forsaken him. Even the physical pain ofbeing bound Silas had turned into a spiritual exercise, asking the throb of hisblood-starved muscles to remind him of the pain Christ endured. I have beenpraying all night for liberation. Now, as the knife descended, Silas clenchedhis eyes shut.A slash of pain tore through his shoulder blades. He cried out, unable tobelieve he was going to die here in the back of this limousine, unable to defendhimself. I was doing God's work. The Teacher said he would protect me.Silas felt the biting warmth spreading across his back and shoulders and couldpicture his own blood, spilling out over his flesh. A piercing pain cut throughhis thighs now, and he felt the onset of that familiar undertow ofdisorientation—the body's defense mechanism against the pain.As the biting heat tore through all of his muscles now, Silas clenched his eyestighter, determined that the final image of his life would not be of his ownkiller. Instead he pictured a younger Bishop Aringarosa, standing before thesmall church in Spain... the church that he and Silas had built with their ownhands. The beginning of my life.Silas felt as if his body were on fire.\"Take a drink,\" the tuxedoed man whispered, his accent French. \"It will helpwith your circulation.\"Silas's eyes flew open in surprise. A blurry image was leaning over him,offering a glass of liquid. A mound of shredded duct tape lay on the floorbeside the bloodless knife.\"Drink this,\" he repeated. \"The pain you feel is the blood rushing into yourmuscles.\"Silas felt the fiery throb transforming now to a prickling sting. The vodkatasted terrible, but he drank it, feeling grateful. Fate had dealt Silas ahealthy share of bad luck tonight, but God had solved it all with one miraculoustwist.God has not forsaken me.Silas knew what Bishop Aringarosa would call it.Divine intervention.\"I had wanted to free you earlier,\" the servant apologized, \"but it wasimpossible. With the police arriving at Château Villette, and then at BigginHill airport, this was the first possible moment. You understand, don't you,Silas?\"Silas recoiled, startled. \"You know my name?\"The servant smiled.Silas sat up now, rubbing his stiff muscles, his emotions a torrent ofincredulity, appreciation, and confusion. \"Are you... the Teacher?\"Rémy shook his head, laughing at the proposition. \"I wish I had that kind ofpower. No, I am not the Teacher. Like you, I serve him. But the Teacher speakshighly of you. My name is Rémy.\"Silas was amazed. \"I don't understand. If you work for the Teacher, why didLangdon bring the keystone to your home?\"\"Not my home. The home of the world's foremost Grail historian, Sir LeighTeabing.\"\"But you live there. The odds...\"Rémy smiled, seeming to have no trouble with the apparent coincidence ofLangdon's chosen refuge. \"It was all utterly predictable. Robert Langdon was inpossession of the keystone, and he needed help. What more logical place to runthan to the home of Leigh Teabing? That I happen to live there is why theTeacher approached me in the first place.\" He paused. \"How do you think theTeacher knows so much about the Grail?\"Now it dawned, and Silas was stunned. The Teacher had recruited a servant whohad access to all of Sir Leigh Teabing's research. It was brilliant.\"There is much I have to tell you,\" Rémy said, handing Silas the loaded HecklerKoch pistol. Then he reached through the open partition and retrieved a small,palm-sized revolver from the glove box. \"But first, you and I have a job to do.\" Captain Fache descended from his transport plane at Biggin Hill and listened indisbelief to the Kent chief inspector's account of what had happened inTeabing's hangar.\"I searched the plane myself,\" the inspector insisted, \"and there was no oneinside.\" His tone turned haughty. \"And I should add that if Sir Leigh Teabingpresses charges against me, I will—\"\"Did you interrogate the pilot?\"\"Of course not. He is French, and our jurisdiction requires—\"\"Take me to the plane.\"Arriving at the hangar, Fache needed only sixty seconds to locate an anomaloussmear of blood on the pavement near where the limousine had been parked. Fachewalked up to the plane and rapped loudly on the fuselage.\"This is the captain of the French Judicial Police. Open the door!\"The terrified pilot opened the hatch and lowered the stairs.Fache ascended. Three minutes later, with the help of his sidearm, he had a fullconfession, including a description of the bound albino monk. In addition, helearned that the pilot saw Langdon and Sophie leave something behind inTeabing's safe, a wooden box of some sort. Although the pilot denied knowingwhat was in the box, he admitted it had been the focus of Langdon's fullattention during the flight to London.\"Open the safe,\" Fache demanded.The pilot looked terrified. \"I don't know the combination!\"\"That's too bad. I was going to offer to let you keep your pilot's license.\"The pilot wrung his hands. \"I know some men in maintenance here. Maybe theycould drill it?\"\"You have half an hour.\"The pilot leapt for his radio.Fache strode to the back of the plane and poured himself a hard drink. It wasearly, but he had not yet slept, so this hardly counted as drinking before noon.Sitting in a plush bucket seat, he closed his eyes, trying to sort out what wasgoing on. The Kent police's blunder could cost me dearly. Everyone was now onthe lookout for a black Jaguar limousine.Fache's phone rang, and he wished for a moment's peace. \"Allo?\"\"I'm en route to London.\" It was Bishop Aringarosa. \"I'll be arriving in anhour.\"Fache sat up. \"I thought you were going to Paris.\"\"I am deeply concerned. I have changed my plans.\"\"You should not have.\"\"Do you have Silas?\"\"No. His captors eluded the local police before I landed.\"Aringarosa's anger rang sharply. \"You assured me you would stop that plane!\"Fache lowered his voice. \"Bishop, considering your situation, I recommend younot test my patience today. I will find Silas and the others as soon aspossible. Where are you landing?\"\"One moment.\" Aringarosa covered the receiver and then came back. \"The pilot istrying to get clearance at Heathrow. I'm his only passenger, but our redirectwas unscheduled.\"\"Tell him to come to Biggin Hill Executive Airport in Kent. I'll get himclearance. If I'm not here when you land, I'll have a car waiting for you.\"\"Thank you.\"\"As I expressed when we first spoke, Bishop, you would do well to remember thatyou are not the only man on the verge of losing everything.\" CHAPTER 85You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.Each of the carved knights within the Temple Church lay on his back with hishead resting on a rectangular stone pillow. Sophie felt a chill. The poem'sreference to an \"orb\" conjured images of the night in her grandfather'sbasement.Hieros Gamos. The orbs.Sophie wondered if the ritual had been performed in this very sanctuary. Thecircular room seemed custom-built for such a pagan rite. A stone pew encircled abare expanse of floor in the middle. A theater in the round, as Robert hadcalled it. She imagined this chamber at night, filled with masked people,chanting by torchlight, all witnessing a \"sacred communion\" in the center of theroom.Forcing the image from her mind, she advanced with Langdon and Teabing towardthe first group of knights. Despite Teabing's insistence that theirinvestigation should be conducted meticulously, Sophie felt eager and pushedahead of them, making a cursory walk-through of the five knights on the left.Scrutinizing these first tombs, Sophie noted the similarities and differencesbetween them. Every knight was on his back, but three of the knights had theirlegs extended straight out while two had their legs crossed. The oddity seemedto have no relevance to the missing orb. Examining their clothing, Sophie notedthat two of the knights wore tunics over their armor, while the other three woreankle-length robes. Again, utterly unhelpful. Sophie turned her attention to theonly other obvious difference—their hand positions. Two knights clutched swords,two prayed, and one had his arms at his side. After a long moment looking at thehands, Sophie shrugged, having seen no hint anywhere of a conspicuously absentorb.Feeling the weight of the cryptex in her sweater pocket, she glanced back atLangdon and Teabing. The men were moving slowly, still only at the third knight,apparently having no luck either. In no mood to wait, she turned away from themtoward the second group of knights.As she crossed the open space, she quietly recited the poem she had read so manytimes now that it was committed to memory. In London lies a knight a Pope interred.His labor's fruit a Holy wrath incurred.You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb. When Sophie arrived at the second group of knights, she found that this secondgroup was similar to the first. All lay with varied body positions, wearingarmor and swords.That was, all except the tenth and final tomb.Hurrying over to it, she stared down.No pillow. No armor. No tunic. No sword.\"Robert? Leigh?\" she called, her voice echoing around the chamber. \"There'ssomething missing over here.\"Both men looked up and immediately began to cross the room toward her.\"An orb?\" Teabing called excitedly. His crutches clicked out a rapid staccato ashe hurried across the room. \"Are we missing an orb?\"\"Not exactly,\" Sophie said, frowning at the tenth tomb. \"We seem to be missingan entire knight.\"Arriving beside her both men gazed down in confusion at the tenth tomb. Ratherthan a knight lying in the open air, this tomb was a sealed stone casket. Thecasket was trapezoidal, tapered at the feet, widening toward the top, with apeaked lid.\"Why isn't this knight shown?\" Langdon asked.\"Fascinating,\" Teabing said, stroking his chin. \"I had forgotten about thisoddity. It's been years since I was here.\"\"This coffin,\" Sophie said, \"looks like it was carved at the same time and bythe same sculptor as the other nine tombs. So why is this knight in a casketrather than in the open?\"Teabing shook his head. \"One of this church's mysteries. To the best of myknowledge, nobody has ever found any explanation for it.\"\"Hello?\" the altar boy said, arriving with a perturbed look on his face.\"Forgive me if this seems rude, but you told me you wanted to spread ashes, andyet you seem to be sightseeing.\"Teabing scowled at the boy and turned to Langdon. \"Mr. Wren, apparently yourfamily's philanthropy does not buy you the time it used to, so perhaps we shouldtake out the ashes and get on with it.\" Teabing turned to Sophie. \"Mrs. Wren?\"Sophie played along, pulling the vellum-wrapped cryptex from her pocket.\"Now then,\" Teabing snapped at the boy, \"if you would give us some privacy?\"The altar boy did not move. He was eyeing Langdon closely now. \"You lookfamiliar.\"Teabing huffed. \"Perhaps that is because Mr. Wren comes here every year!\"Or perhaps, Sophie now feared, because he saw Langdon on television at theVatican last year.\"I have never met Mr. Wren,\" the altar boy declared.\"You're mistaken,\" Langdon said politely. \"I believe you and I met in passinglast year. Father Knowles failed to formally introduce us, but I recognized yourface as we came in. Now, I realize this is an intrusion, but if you could affordme a few more minutes, I have traveled a great distance to scatter ashes amongstthese tombs.\" Langdon spoke his lines with Teabing-esque believability.The altar boy's expression turned even more skeptical. \"These are not tombs.\"\"I'm sorry?\" Langdon said.\"Of course they are tombs,\" Teabing declared. \"What are you talking about?\"The altar boy shook his head. \"Tombs contain bodies. These are effigies. Stonetributes to real men. There are no bodies beneath these figures.\"\"This is a crypt!\" Teabing said.\"Only in outdated history books. This was believed to be a crypt but wasrevealed as nothing of the sort during the 1950 renovation.\" He turned back toLangdon. \"And I imagine Mr. Wren would know that. Considering it was his familythat uncovered that fact.\"An uneasy silence fell.It was broken by the sound of a door slamming out in the annex.\"That must be Father Knowles,\" Teabing said. \"Perhaps you should go see?\"The altar boy looked doubtful but stalked back toward the annex, leavingLangdon, Sophie, and Teabing to eye one another gloomily.\"Leigh,\" Langdon whispered. \"No bodies? What is he talking about?\"Teabing looked distraught. \"I don't know. I always thought... certainly, thismust be the place. I can't imagine he knows what he is talking about. It makesno sense!\"\"Can I see the poem again?\" Langdon said.Sophie pulled the cryptex from her pocket and carefully handed it to him.Langdon unwrapped the vellum, holding the cryptex in his hand while he examinedthe poem. \"Yes, the poem definitely references a tomb. Not an effigy.\"\"Could the poem be wrong?\" Teabing asked. \"Could Jacques Saunière have made thesame mistake I just did?\"Langdon considered it and shook his head. \"Leigh, you said it yourself. Thischurch was built by Templars, the military arm of the Priory. Something tells methe Grand Master of the Priory would have a pretty good idea if there wereknights buried here.\"Teabing looked flabbergasted. \"But this place is perfect.\" He wheeled backtoward the knights. \"We must be missing something!\" Entering the annex, the altar boy was surprised to find it deserted. \"FatherKnowles?\" I know I heard the door, he thought, moving forward until he could seethe entryway.A thin man in a tuxedo stood near the doorway, scratching his head and lookinglost. The altar boy gave an irritated huff, realizing he had forgotten to relockthe door when he let the others in. Now some pathetic sod had wandered in offthe street, looking for directions to some wedding from the looks of it. \"I'msorry,\" he called out, passing a large pillar, \"we're closed.\"A flurry of cloth ruffled behind him, and before the altar boy could turn, hishead snapped backward, a powerful hand clamping hard over his mouth from behind,muffling his scream. The hand over the boy's mouth was snow-white, and hesmelled alcohol.The prim man in the tuxedo calmly produced a very small revolver, which he aimeddirectly at the boy's forehead.The altar boy felt his groin grow hot and realized he had wet himself.\"Listen carefully,\" the tuxedoed man whispered. \"You will exit this churchsilently, and you will run. You will not stop. Is that clear?\"The boy nodded as best he could with the hand over his mouth.\"If you call the police...\" The tuxedoed man pressed the gun to his skin. \"Iwill find you.\"The next thing the boy knew, he was sprinting across the outside courtyard withno plans of stopping until his legs gave out. CHAPTER 86Like a ghost, Silas drifted silently behind his target. Sophie Neveu sensed himtoo late. Before she could turn, Silas pressed the gun barrel into her spine andwrapped a powerful arm across her chest, pulling her back against his hulkingbody. She yelled in surprise. Teabing and Langdon both turned now, theirexpressions astonished and fearful.\"What...?\" Teabing choked out. \"What did you do to Rémy!\"\"Your only concern,\" Silas said calmly, \"is that I leave here with thekeystone.\" This recovery mission, as Rémy had described it, was to be clean andsimple: Enter the church, take the keystone, and walk out; no killing, nostruggle.Holding Sophie firm, Silas dropped his hand from her chest, down to her waist,slipping it inside her deep sweater pockets, searching. He could smell the softfragrance of her hair through his own alcohol-laced breath. \"Where is it?\" hewhispered. The keystone was in her sweater pocket earlier. So where is it now?\"It's over here,\" Langdon's deep voice resonated from across the room.Silas turned to see Langdon holding the black cryptex before him, waving it backand forth like a matador tempting a dumb animal.\"Set it down,\" Silas demanded.\"Let Sophie and Leigh leave the church,\" Langdon replied. \"You and I can settlethis.\"Silas pushed Sophie away from him and aimed the gun at Langdon, moving towardhim.\"Not a step closer,\" Langdon said. \"Not until they leave the building.\"\"You are in no position to make demands.\"\"I disagree.\" Langdon raised the cryptex high over his head. \"I will nothesitate to smash this on the floor and break the vial inside.\"Although Silas sneered outwardly at the threat, he felt a flash of fear. Thiswas unexpected. He aimed the gun at Langdon's head and kept his voice as steadyas his hand. \"You would never break the keystone. You want to find the Grail asmuch as I do.\"\"You're wrong. You want it much more. You've proven you're willing to kill forit.\" Forty feet away, peering out from the annex pews near the archway, RémyLegaludec felt a rising alarm. The maneuver had not gone as planned, and evenfrom here, he could see Silas was uncertain how to handle the situation. At theTeacher's orders, Rémy had forbidden Silas to fire his gun.\"Let them go,\" Langdon again demanded, holding the cryptex high over his headand staring into Silas's gun.The monk's red eyes filled with anger and frustration, and Rémy tightened withfear that Silas might actually shoot Langdon while he was holding the cryptex.The cryptex cannot fall!The cryptex was to be Rémy's ticket to freedom and wealth. A little over a yearago, he was simply a fifty-five-year-old manservant living within the walls ofChâteau Villette, catering to the whims of the insufferable cripple Sir LeighTeabing. Then he was approached with an extraordinary proposition. Rémy'sassociation with Sir Leigh Teabing—the preeminent Grail historian on earth—wasgoing to bring Rémy everything he had ever dreamed of in life. Since then, everymoment he had spent inside Château Villette had been leading him to this veryinstant.I am so close, Rémy told himself, gazing into the sanctuary of the Temple Churchand the keystone in Robert Langdon's hand. If Langdon dropped it, all would belost.Am I willing to show my face? It was something the Teacher had strictlyforbidden. Rémy was the only one who knew the Teacher's identity.\"Are you certain you want Silas to carry out this task?\" Rémy had asked theTeacher less than half an hour ago, upon getting orders to steal the keystone.\"I myself am capable.\"The Teacher was resolute. \"Silas served us well with the four Priory members. Hewill recover the keystone. You must remain anonymous. If others see you, theywill need to be eliminated, and there has been enough killing already. Do notreveal your face.\"My face will change, Rémy thought. With what you've promised to pay me, I willbecome an entirely new man. Surgery could even change his fingerprints, theTeacher had told him. Soon he would be free—another unrecognizable, beautifulface soaking up the sun on the beach. \"Understood,\" Rémy said. \"I will assistSilas from the shadows.\"\"For your own knowledge, Rémy,\" the Teacher had told him, \"the tomb in questionis not in the Temple Church. So have no fear. They are looking in the wrongplace.\"Rémy was stunned. \"And you know where the tomb is?\"\"Of course. Later, I will tell you. For the moment, you must act quickly. If theothers figure out the true location of the tomb and leave the church before youtake the cryptex, we could lose the Grail forever.\"Rémy didn't give a damn about the Grail, except that the Teacher refused to payhim until it was found. Rémy felt giddy every time he thought of the money hesoon would have. One third of twenty million euro. Plenty to disappear forever.Rémy had pictured the beach towns on the Côte d'Azur, where he planned to liveout his days basking in the sun and letting others serve him for a change.Now, however, here in the Temple Church, with Langdon threatening to break thekeystone, Rémy's future was at risk. Unable to bear the thought of coming thisclose only to lose it all, Rémy made the decision to take bold action. The gunin his hand was a concealable, small-caliber, J-frame Medusa, but it would beplenty deadly at close range.Stepping from the shadows, Rémy marched into the circular chamber and aimed thegun directly at Teabing's head. \"Old man, I've been waiting a long time to dothis.\" Sir Leigh Teabing's heart practically stalled to see Rémy aiming a gun at him.What is he doing! Teabing recognized the tiny Medusa revolver as his own, theone he kept locked in the limousine glove box for safety.\"Rémy?\" Teabing sputtered in shock. \"What is going on?\"Langdon and Sophie looked equally dumbstruck.Rémy circled behind Teabing and rammed the pistol barrel into his back, high andon the left, directly behind his heart.Teabing felt his muscles seize with terror. \"Rémy, I don't—\"\"I'll make it simple,\" Rémy snapped, eyeing Langdon over Teabing's shoulder.\"Set down the keystone, or I pull the trigger.\"Langdon seemed momentarily paralyzed. \"The keystone is worthless to you,\" hestammered. \"You cannot possibly open it.\"\"Arrogant fools,\" Rémy sneered. \"Have you not noticed that I have been listeningtonight as you discussed these poems? Everything I heard, I have shared withothers. Others who know more than you. You are not even looking in the rightplace. The tomb you seek is in another location entirely!\"Teabing felt panicked. What is he saying!\"Why do you want the Grail?\" Langdon demanded. \"To destroy it? Before the End ofDays?\"Rémy called to the monk. \"Silas, take the keystone from Mr. Langdon.\"As the monk advanced, Langdon stepped back, raising the keystone high, lookingfully prepared to hurl it at the floor.\"I would rather break it,\" Langdon said, \"than see it in the wrong hands.\"Teabing now felt a wave of horror. He could see his life's work evaporatingbefore his eyes. All his dreams about to be shattered.\"Robert, no!\" Teabing exclaimed. \"Don't! That's the Grail you're holding! Rémywould never shoot me. We've known each other for ten—\"Rémy aimed at the ceiling and fired the Medusa. The blast was enormous for sucha small weapon, the gunshot echoing like thunder inside the stone chamber.Everyone froze.\"I am not playing games,\" Rémy said. \"The next one is in his back. Hand thekeystone to Silas.\"Langdon reluctantly held out the cryptex. Silas stepped forward and took it, hisred eyes gleaming with the self-satisfaction of vengeance. Slipping the keystonein the pocket of his robe, Silas backed off, still holding Langdon and Sophie atgunpoint.Teabing felt Rémy's arm clamp hard around his neck as the servant began backingout of the building, dragging Teabing with him, the gun still pressed in hisback.\"Let him go,\" Langdon demanded.\"We're taking Mr. Teabing for a drive,\" Rémy said, still backing up. \"If youcall the police, he will die. If you do anything to interfere, he will die. Isthat clear?\"\"Take me,\" Langdon demanded, his voice cracking with emotion. \"Let Leigh go.\"Rémy laughed. \"I don't think so. He and I have such a nice history. Besides, hestill might prove useful.\"Silas was backing up now, keeping Langdon and Sophie at gunpoint as Rémy pulledLeigh toward the exit, his crutches dragging behind him.Sophie's voice was unwavering. \"Who are you working for?\"The question brought a smirk to the departing Rémy's face. \"You would besurprised, Mademoiselle Neveu.\" CHAPTER 87The fireplace in Château Villette's drawing room was cold, but Collet pacedbefore it nonetheless as he read the faxes from Interpol.Not at all what he expected.André Vernet, according to official records, was a model citizen. No policerecord—not even a parking ticket. Educated at prep school and the Sorbonne, hehad a cum laude degree in international finance. Interpol said Vernet's nameappeared in the newspapers from time to time, but always in a positive light.Apparently the man had helped design the security parameters that kept theDepository Bank of Zurich a leader in the ultramodern world of electronicsecurity. Vernet's credit card records showed a penchant for art books,expensive wine, and classical CD's—mostly Brahms—which he apparently enjoyed onan exceptionally high-end stereo system he had purchased several years ago.Zero, Collet sighed.The only red flag tonight from Interpol had been a set of fingerprints thatapparently belonged to Teabing's servant. The chief PTS examiner was reading thereport in a comfortable chair across the room.Collet looked over. \"Anything?\"The examiner shrugged. \"Prints belong to Rémy Legaludec. Wanted for petty crime.Nothing serious. Looks like he got kicked out of university for rewiring phonejacks to get free service... later did some petty theft. Breaking and entering.Skipped out on a hospital bill once for an emergency tracheotomy.\" He glancedup, chuckling. \"Peanut allergy.\"Collet nodded, recalling a police investigation into a restaurant that hadfailed to notate on its menu that the chili recipe contained peanut oil. Anunsuspecting patron had died of anaphylactic shock at the table after a singlebite.\"Legaludec is probably a live-in here to avoid getting picked up.\" The examinerlooked amused. \"His lucky night.\"Collet sighed. \"All right, you better forward this info to Captain Fache.\"The examiner headed off just as another PTS agent burst into the living room.\"Lieutenant! We found something in the barn.\"From the anxious look on the agent's face, Collet could only guess. \"A body.\"\"No, sir. Something more...\" He hesitated. \"Unexpected.\"Rubbing his eyes, Collet followed the agent out to the barn. As they entered themusty, cavernous space, the agent motioned toward the center of the room, wherea wooden ladder now ascended high into the rafters, propped against the ledge ofa hayloft suspended high above them.\"That ladder wasn't there earlier,\" Collet said.\"No, sir. I set that up. We were dusting for prints near the Rolls when I sawthe ladder lying on the floor. I wouldn't have given it a second thought exceptthe rungs were worn and muddy. This ladder gets regular use. The height of thehayloft matched the ladder, so I raised it and climbed up to have a look.\"Collet's eyes climbed the ladder's steep incline to the soaring hayloft. Someonegoes up there regularly? From down here, the loft appeared to be a desertedplatform, and yet admittedly most of it was invisible from this line of sight.A senior PTS agent appeared at the top of the ladder, looking down. \"You'lldefinitely want to see this, Lieutenant,\" he said, waving Collet up with alatex-gloved hand.Nodding tiredly, Collet walked over to the base of the old ladder and graspedthe bottom rungs. The ladder was an antique tapered design and narrowed asCollet ascended. As he neared the top, Collet almost lost his footing on a thinrung. The barn below him spun. Alert now, he moved on, finally reaching the top.The agent above him reached out, offering his wrist. Collet grabbed it and madethe awkward transition onto the platform.\"It's over there,\" the PTS agent said, pointing deep into the immaculately cleanloft. \"Only one set of prints up here. We'll have an ID shortly.\"Collet squinted through the dim light toward the far wall. What the hell?Nestled against the far wall sat an elaborate computer workstation—two towerCPUs, a flat-screen video monitor with speakers, an array of hard drives, and amultichannel audio console that appeared to have its own filtered power supply.Why in the world would anyone work all the way up here? Collet moved toward thegear. \"Have you examined the system?\"\"It's a listening post.\"Collet spun. \"Surveillance?\"The agent nodded. \"Very advanced surveillance.\" He motioned to a long projecttable strewn with electronic parts, manuals, tools, wires, soldering irons, andother electronic components. \"Someone clearly knows what he's doing. A lot ofthis gear is as sophisticated as our own equipment. Miniature microphones,photoelectric recharging cells, high-capacity RAM chips. He's even got some ofthose new nano drives.\"Collet was impressed.\"Here's a complete system,\" the agent said, handing Collet an assembly not muchlarger than a pocket calculator. Dangling off the contraption was a foot-longwire with a stamp-sized piece of wafer-thin foil stuck on the end. \"The base isa high-capacity hard disk audio recording system with rechargeable battery. Thatstrip of foil at the end of the wire is a combination microphone andphotoelectric recharging cell.\"Collet knew them well. These foil-like, photocell microphones had been anenormous breakthrough a few years back. Now, a hard disk recorder could beaffixed behind a lamp, for example, with its foil microphone molded into thecontour of the base and dyed to match. As long as the microphone was positionedsuch that it received a few hours of sunlight per day, the photo cells wouldkeep recharging the system. Bugs like this one could listen indefinitely.\"Reception method?\" Collet asked.The agent signaled to an insulated wire that ran out of the back of thecomputer, up the wall, through a hole in the barn roof. \"Simple radio wave.Small antenna on the roof.\"Collet knew these recording systems were generally placed in offices, werevoice-activated to save hard disk space, and recorded snippets of conversationduring the day, transmitting compressed audio files at night to avoid detection.After transmitting, the hard drive erased itself and prepared to do it all overagain the next day.Collet's gaze moved now to a shelf on which were stacked several hundred audiocassettes, all labeled with dates and numbers. Someone has been very busy. Heturned back to the agent. \"Do you have any idea what target is being bugged?\"\"Well, Lieutenant,\" the agent said, walking to the computer and launching apiece of software. \"It's the strangest thing....\" CHAPTER 88Langdon felt utterly spent as he and Sophie hurdled a turnstile at the Templetube station and dashed deep into the grimy labyrinth of tunnels and platforms.The guilt ripped through him.I involved Leigh, and now he's in enormous danger.Rémy's involvement had been a shock, and yet it made sense. Whoever was pursuingthe Grail had recruited someone on the inside. They went to Teabing's for thesame reason I did. Throughout history, those who held knowledge of the Grail hadalways been magnets for thieves and scholars alike. The fact that Teabing hadbeen a target all along should have made Langdon feel less guilty aboutinvolving him. It did not. We need to find Leigh and help him. Immediately.Langdon followed Sophie to the westbound District and Circle Line platform,where she hurried to a pay phone to call the police, despite Rémy's warning tothe contrary. Langdon sat on a grungy bench nearby, feeling remorseful.\"The best way to help Leigh,\" Sophie reiterated as she dialed, \"is to involvethe London authorities immediately. Trust me.\"Langdon had not initially agreed with this idea, but as they had hatched theirplan, Sophie's logic began to make sense. Teabing was safe at the moment. Evenif Rémy and the others knew where the knight's tomb was located, they stillmight need Teabing's help deciphering the orb reference. What worried Langdonwas what would happen after the Grail map had been found. Leigh will become ahuge liability.If Langdon were to have any chance of helping Leigh, or of ever seeing thekeystone again, it was essential that he find the tomb first. Unfortunately,Rémy has a big head start.Slowing Rémy down had become Sophie's task.Finding the right tomb had become Langdon's.Sophie would make Rémy and Silas fugitives of the London police, forcing theminto hiding or, better yet, catching them. Langdon's plan was less certain—totake the tube to nearby King's College, which was renowned for its electronictheological database. The ultimate research tool, Langdon had heard. Instantanswers to any religious historical question. He wondered what the databasewould have to say about \"a knight a Pope interred.\"He stood up and paced, wishing the train would hurry. At the pay phone, Sophie's call finally connected to the London police.\"Snow Hill Division,\" the dispatcher said. \"How may I direct your call?\"\"I'm reporting a kidnapping.\" Sophie knew to be concise.\"Name please?\"Sophie paused. \"Agent Sophie Neveu with the French Judicial Police.\"The title had the desired effect. \"Right away, ma'am. Let me get a detective onthe line for you.\"As the call went through, Sophie began wondering if the police would evenbelieve her description of Teabing's captors. A man in a tuxedo. How much easierto identify could a suspect be? Even if Rémy changed clothes, he was partneredwith an albino monk. Impossible to miss. Moreover, they had a hostage and couldnot take public transportation. She wondered how many Jaguar stretch limos therecould be in London.Sophie's connection to the detective seemed to be taking forever. Come on! Shecould hear the line clicking and buzzing, as if she was being transferred.Fifteen seconds passed.Finally a man came on the line. \"Agent Neveu?\"Stunned, Sophie registered the gruff tone immediately.\"Agent Neveu,\" Bezu Fache demanded. \"Where the hell are you?\"Sophie was speechless. Captain Fache had apparently requested the London policedispatcher alert him if Sophie called in.\"Listen,\" Fache said, speaking to her in terse French. \"I made a terriblemistake tonight. Robert Langdon is innocent. All charges against him have beendropped. Even so, both of you are in danger. You need to come in.\"Sophie's jaw fell slack. She had no idea how to respond. Fache was not a man whoapologized for anything.\"You did not tell me,\" Fache continued, \"that Jacques Saunière was yourgrandfather. I fully intend to overlook your insubordination last night onaccount of the emotional stress you must be under. At the moment, however, youand Langdon need to go to the nearest London police headquarters for refuge.\"He knows I'm in London? What else does Fache know? Sophie heard what soundedlike drilling or machinery in the background. She also heard an odd clicking onthe line. \"Are you tracing this call, Captain?\"Fache's voice was firm now. \"You and I need to cooperate, Agent Neveu. We bothhave a lot to lose here. This is damage control. I made errors in judgment lastnight, and if those errors result in the deaths of an American professor and aDCPJ cryptologist, my career will be over. I've been trying to pull you backinto safety for the last several hours.\"A warm wind was now pushing through the station as a train approached with a lowrumble. Sophie had every intention of being on it. Langdon apparently had thesame idea; he was gathering himself together and moving toward her now.\"The man you want is Rémy Legaludec,\" Sophie said. \"He is Teabing's servant. Hejust kidnapped Teabing inside the Temple Church and—\"\"Agent Neveu!\" Fache bellowed as the train thundered into the station. \"This isnot something to discuss on an open line. You and Langdon will come in now. Foryour own well-being! That is a direct order!\"Sophie hung up and dashed with Langdon onto the train. CHAPTER 89The immaculate cabin of Teabing's Hawker was now covered with steel shavings andsmelled of compressed air and propane. Bezu Fache had sent everyone away and satalone with his drink and the heavy wooden box found in Teabing's safe.Running his finger across the inlaid Rose, he lifted the ornate lid. Inside hefound a stone cylinder with lettered dials. The five dials were arranged tospell SOFIA. Fache stared at the word a long moment and then lifted the cylinderfrom its padded resting place and examined every inch. Then, pulling slowly onthe ends, Fache slid off one of the end caps. The cylinder was empty.Fache set it back in the box and gazed absently out the jet's window at thehangar, pondering his brief conversation with Sophie, as well as the informationhe'd received from PTS in Château Villette. The sound of his phone shook himfrom his daydream.It was the DCPJ switchboard. The dispatcher was apologetic. The president of theDepository Bank of Zurich had been calling repeatedly, and although he had beentold several times that the captain was in London on business, he just keptcalling. Begrudgingly Fache told the operator to forward the call.\"Monsieur Vernet,\" Fache said, before the man could even speak, \"I am sorry Idid not call you earlier. I have been busy. As promised, the name of your bankhas not appeared in the media. So what precisely is your concern?\"Vernet's voice was anxious as he told Fache how Langdon and Sophie had extracteda small wooden box from the bank and then persuaded Vernet to help them escape.\"Then when I heard on the radio that they were criminals,\" Vernet said, \"Ipulled over and demanded the box back, but they attacked me and stole thetruck.\"\"You are concerned for a wooden box,\" Fache said, eyeing the Rose inlay on thecover and again gently opening the lid to reveal the white cylinder. \"Can youtell me what was in the box?\"\"The contents are immaterial,\" Vernet fired back. \"I am concerned with thereputation of my bank. We have never had a robbery. Ever. It will ruin us if Icannot recover this property on behalf of my client.\"\"You said Agent Neveu and Robert Langdon had a password and a key. What makesyou say they stole the box?\"\"They murdered people tonight. Including Sophie Neveu's grandfather. The key andpassword were obviously ill-gotten.\"\"Mr. Vernet, my men have done some checking into your background and yourinterests. You are obviously a man of great culture and refinement. I wouldimagine you are a man of honor, as well. As am I. That said, I give you my wordas commanding officer of the Police Judiciaire that your box, along with yourbank's reputation, are in the safest of hands.\" CHAPTER 90High in the hayloft at Château Villette, Collet stared at the computer monitorin amazement. \"This system is eavesdropping on all these locations?\"\"Yes,\" the agent said. \"It looks like data has been collected for over a yearnow.\"Collet read the list again, speechless.> COLBERT SOSTAQUE—Chairman of the Conseil Constitutionnel> > JEAN CHAFFÉE—Curator, Musée du Jeu de Paume> > EDOUARD DESROCHERS—Senior Archivist, Mitterrand Library> > JACQUES SAUNIÈRE—Curator, Musée du Louvre> > MICHEL BRETON—Head of DAS (French Intelligence)The agent pointed to the screen. \"Number four is of obvious concern.\"Collet nodded blankly. He had noticed it immediately. Jacques Saunière was beingbugged. He looked at the rest of the list again. How could anyone possiblymanage to bug these prominent people? \"Have you heard any of the audio files?\"\"A few. Here's one of the most recent.\" The agent clicked a few computer keys.The speakers crackled to life. \"Capitaine, un agent du Département deCryptographie est arrivé.\"Collet could not believe his ears. \"That's me! That's my voice!\" He recalledsitting at Saunière's desk and radioing Fache in the Grand Gallery to alert himof Sophie Neveu's arrival.The agent nodded. \"A lot of our Louvre investigation tonight would have beenaudible if someone had been interested.\"\"Have you sent anyone in to sweep for the bug?\"\"No need. I know exactly where it is.\" The agent went to a pile of old notes andblueprints on the worktable. He selected a page and handed it to Collet. \"Lookfamiliar?\"Collet was amazed. He was holding a photocopy of an ancient schematic diagram,which depicted a rudimentary machine. He was unable to read the handwrittenItalian labels, and yet he knew what he was looking at. A model for a fullyarticulated medieval French knight.The knight sitting on Saunière's desk!Collet's eyes moved to the margins, where someone had scribbled notes on thephotocopy in red felt-tipped marker. The notes were in French and appeared to beideas outlining how best to insert a listening device into the knight. CHAPTER 91Silas sat in the passenger seat of the parked Jaguar limousine near the TempleChurch. His hands felt damp on the keystone as he waited for Rémy to finishtying and gagging Teabing in back with the rope they had found in the trunk.Finally, Rémy climbed out of the rear of the limo, walked around, and slid intothe driver's seat beside Silas.\"Secure?\" Silas asked.Rémy chuckled, shaking off the rain and glancing over his shoulder through theopen partition at the crumpled form of Leigh Teabing, who was barely visible inthe shadows in the rear. \"He's not going anywhere.\"Silas could hear Teabing's muffled cries and realized Rémy had used some of theold duct tape to gag him.\"Ferme ta gueule!\" Rémy shouted over his shoulder at Teabing. Reaching to acontrol panel on the elaborate dash, Rémy pressed a button. An opaque partitionraised behind them, sealing off the back. Teabing disappeared, and his voice wassilenced. Rémy glanced at Silas. \"I've been listening to his miserablewhimpering long enough.\" Minutes later, as the Jaguar stretch limo powered through the streets, Silas'scell phone rang. The Teacher. He answered excitedly. \"Hello?\"\"Silas,\" the Teacher's familiar French accent said, \"I am relieved to hear yourvoice. This means you are safe.\"Silas was equally comforted to hear the Teacher. It had been hours, and theoperation had veered wildly off course. Now, at last, it seemed to be back ontrack. \"I have the keystone.\"\"This is superb news,\" the Teacher told him. \"Is Rémy with you?\"Silas was surprised to hear the Teacher use Rémy's name. \"Yes. Rémy freed me.\"\"As I ordered him to do. I am only sorry you had to endure captivity for solong.\"\"Physical discomfort has no meaning. The important thing is that the keystone isours.\"\"Yes. I need it delivered to me at once. Time is of the essence.\"Silas was eager to meet the Teacher face-to-face at last. \"Yes, sir, I would behonored.\"\"Silas, I would like Rémy to bring it to me.\"Rémy? Silas was crestfallen. After everything Silas had done for the Teacher, hehad believed he would be the one to hand over the prize. The Teacher favorsRémy?\"I sense your disappointment,\" the Teacher said, \"which tells me you do notunderstand my meaning.\" He lowered his voice to a whisper. \"You must believethat I would much prefer to receive the keystone from you—a man of God ratherthan a criminal—but Rémy must be dealt with. He disobeyed my orders and made agrave mistake that has put our entire mission at risk.\"Silas felt a chill and glanced over at Rémy. Kidnapping Teabing had not beenpart of the plan, and deciding what to do with him posed a new problem.\"You and I are men of God,\" the Teacher whispered. \"We cannot be deterred fromour goal.\" There was an ominous pause on the line. \"For this reason alone, Iwill ask Rémy to bring me the keystone. Do you understand?\"Silas sensed anger in the Teacher's voice and was surprised the man was not moreunderstanding. Showing his face could not be avoided, Silas thought. Rémy didwhat he had to do. He saved the keystone. \"I understand,\" Silas managed.\"Good. For your own safety, you need to get off the street immediately. Thepolice will be looking for the limousine soon, and I do not want you caught.Opus Dei has a residence in London, no?\"\"Of course.\"\"And you are welcome there?\"\"As a brother.\"\"Then go there and stay out of sight. I will call you the moment I am inpossession of the keystone and have attended to my current problem.\"\"You are in London?\"\"Do as I say, and everything will be fine.\"\"Yes, sir.\"The Teacher heaved a sigh, as if what he now had to do was profoundlyregrettable. \"It's time I speak to Rémy.\"Silas handed Rémy the phone, sensing it might be the last call Rémy Legaludecever took. As Rémy took the phone, he knew this poor, twisted monk had no idea what fateawaited him now that he had served his purpose.The Teacher used you, Silas.And your bishop is a pawn.Rémy still marveled at the Teacher's powers of persuasion. Bishop Aringarosa hadtrusted everything. He had been blinded by his own desperation. Aringarosa wasfar too eager to believe. Although Rémy did not particularly like the Teacher,he felt pride at having gained the man's trust and helped him so substantially.I have earned my payday.\"Listen carefully,\" the Teacher said. \"Take Silas to the Opus Dei residence halland drop him off a few streets away. Then drive to St. James's Park. It isadjacent to Parliament and Big Ben. You can park the limousine on Horse GuardsParade. We'll talk there.\"With that, the connection went dead. CHAPTER 92King's College, established by King George IV in 1829, houses its Department ofTheology and Religious Studies adjacent to Parliament on property granted by theCrown. King's College Religion Department boasts not only 150 years' experiencein teaching and research, but the 1982 establishment of the Research Institutein Systematic Theology, which possesses one of the most complete andelectronically advanced religious research libraries in the world.Langdon still felt shaky as he and Sophie came in from the rain and entered thelibrary. The primary research room was as Teabing had described it—a dramaticoctagonal chamber dominated by an enormous round table around which King Arthurand his knights might have been comfortable were it not for the presence oftwelve flat-screen computer workstations. On the far side of the room, areference librarian was just pouring a pot of tea and settling in for her day ofwork.\"Lovely morning,\" she said in a cheerful British accent, leaving the tea andwalking over. \"May I help you?\"\"Thank you, yes,\" Langdon replied. \"My name is—\"\"Robert Langdon.\" She gave a pleasant smile. \"I know who you are.\"For an instant, he feared Fache had put him on English television as well, butthe librarian's smile suggested otherwise. Langdon still had not gotten used tothese moments of unexpected celebrity. Then again, if anyone on earth were goingto recognize his face, it would be a librarian in a Religious Studies referencefacility.\"Pamela Gettum,\" the librarian said, offering her hand. She had a genial,erudite face and a pleasingly fluid voice. The horn-rimmed glasses hangingaround her neck were thick.\"A pleasure,\" Langdon said. \"This is my friend Sophie Neveu.\"The two women greeted one another, and Gettum turned immediately back toLangdon. \"I didn't know you were coming.\"\"Neither did we. If it's not too much trouble, we could really use your helpfinding some information.\"Gettum shifted, looking uncertain. \"Normally our services are by petition andappointment only, unless of course you're the guest of someone at the college?\"Langdon shook his head. \"I'm afraid we've come unannounced. A friend of minespeaks very highly of you. Sir Leigh Teabing?\" Langdon felt a pang of gloom ashe said the name. \"The British Royal Historian.\"Gettum brightened now, laughing. \"Heavens, yes. What a character. Fanatical!Every time he comes in, it's always the same search strings. Grail. Grail.Grail. I swear that man will die before he gives up on that quest.\" She winked.\"Time and money afford one such lovely luxuries, wouldn't you say? A regular DonQuixote, that one.\"\"Is there any chance you can help us?\" Sophie asked. \"It's quite important.\"Gettum glanced around the deserted library and then winked at them both. \"Well,I can't very well claim I'm too busy, now can I? As long as you sign in, I can'timagine anyone being too upset. What did you have in mind?\"\"We're trying to find a tomb in London.\"Gettum looked dubious. \"We've got about twenty thousand of them. Can you be alittle more specific?\"\"It's the tomb of a knight. We don't have a name.\"\"A knight. That tightens the net substantially. Much less common.\"\"We don't have much information about the knight we're looking for,\" Sophiesaid, \"but this is what we know.\" She produced a slip of paper on which she hadwritten only the first two lines of the poem.Hesitant to show the entire poem to an outsider, Langdon and Sophie had decidedto share just the first two lines, those that identified the knight.Compartmentalized cryptography, Sophie had called it. When an intelligenceagency intercepted a code containing sensitive data, cryptographers each workedon a discrete section of the code. This way, when they broke it, no singlecryptographer possessed the entire deciphered message.In this case, the precaution was probably excessive; even if this librarian sawthe entire poem, identified the knight's tomb, and knew what orb was missing,the information was useless without the cryptex. Gettum sensed an urgency in the eyes of this famed American scholar, almost asif his finding this tomb quickly were a matter of critical importance. Thegreen-eyed woman accompanying him also seemed anxious.Puzzled, Gettum put on her glasses and examined the paper they had just handedher. In London lies a knight a Pope interred.His labor's fruit a Holy wrath incurred. She glanced at her guests. \"What is this? Some kind of Harvard scavenger hunt?\"Langdon's laugh sounded forced. \"Yeah, something like that.\"Gettum paused, feeling she was not getting the whole story. Nonetheless, shefelt intrigued and found herself pondering the verse carefully. \"According tothis rhyme, a knight did something that incurred displeasure with God, and yet aPope was kind enough to bury him in London.\"Langdon nodded. \"Does it ring any bells?\"Gettum moved toward one of the workstations. \"Not offhand, but let's see what wecan pull up in the database.\"Over the past two decades, King's College Research Institute in SystematicTheology had used optical character recognition software in unison withlinguistic translation devices to digitize and catalog an enormous collection oftexts—encyclopedias of religion, religious biographies, sacred scriptures indozens of languages, histories, Vatican letters, diaries of clerics, anything atall that qualified as writings on human spirituality. Because the massivecollection was now in the form of bits and bytes rather than physical pages, thedata was infinitely more accessible.Settling into one of the workstations, Gettum eyed the slip of paper and begantyping. \"To begin, we'll run a straight Boolean with a few obvious keywords andsee what happens.\"\"Thank you.\"Gettum typed in a few words: LONDON, KNIGHT, POPE As she clicked the SEARCH button, she could feel the hum of the massivemainframe downstairs scanning data at a rate of 500 MB/sec. \"I'm asking thesystem to show us any documents whose complete text contains all three of thesekeywords. We'll get more hits than we want, but it's a good place to start.\"The screen was already showing the first of the hits now. Painting the Pope. The Collected Portraits of Sir Joshua Reynolds. LondonUniversity Press. Gettum shook her head. \"Obviously not what you're looking for.\" She scrolled tothe next hit. The London Writings of Alexander Pope by G. Wilson Knight. Again she shook her head.As the system churned on, the hits came up more quickly than usual. Dozens oftexts appeared, many of them referencing the eighteenth-century British writerAlexander Pope, whose counterreligious, mock-epic poetry apparently containedplenty of references to knights and London.Gettum shot a quick glance to the numeric field at the bottom of the screen.This computer, by calculating the current number of hits and multiplying by thepercentage of the database left to search, provided a rough guess of how muchinformation would be found. This particular search looked like it was going toreturn an obscenely large amount of data. Estimated number of total hits: 2,692 \"We need to refine the parameters further,\" Gettum said, stopping the search.\"Is this all the information you have regarding the tomb? There's nothing elseto go on?\"Langdon glanced at Sophie Neveu, looking uncertain.This is no scavenger hunt, Gettum sensed. She had heard the whisperings ofRobert Langdon's experience in Rome last year. This American had been grantedaccess to the most secure library on earth—the Vatican Secret Archives. Shewondered what kinds of secrets Langdon might have learned inside and if hiscurrent desperate hunt for a mysterious London tomb might relate to informationhe had gained within the Vatican. Gettum had been a librarian long enough toknow the most common reason people came to London to look for knights. TheGrail.Gettum smiled and adjusted her glasses. \"You are friends with Leigh Teabing, youare in England, and you are looking for a knight.\" She folded her hands. \"I canonly assume you are on a Grail quest.\"Langdon and Sophie exchanged startled looks.Gettum laughed. \"My friends, this library is a base camp for Grail seekers.Leigh Teabing among them. I wish I had a shilling for every time I'd runsearches for the Rose, Mary Magdalene, Sangreal, Merovingian, Priory of Sion, etcetera, et cetera. Everyone loves a conspiracy.\" She took off her glasses andeyed them. \"I need more information.\"In the silence, Gettum sensed her guests' desire for discretion was quicklybeing outweighed by their eagerness for a fast result.\"Here,\" Sophie Neveu blurted. \"This is everything we know.\" Borrowing a pen fromLangdon, she wrote two more lines on the slip of paper and handed it to Gettum. You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb. Gettum gave an inward smile. The Grail indeed, she thought, noting thereferences to the Rose and her seeded womb. \"I can help you,\" she said, lookingup from the slip of paper. \"Might I ask where this verse came from? And why youare seeking an orb?\"\"You might ask,\" Langdon said, with a friendly smile, \"but it's a long story andwe have very little time.\"\"Sounds like a polite way of saying 'mind your own business.' \"\"We would be forever in your debt, Pamela,\" Langdon said, \"if you could find outwho this knight is and where he is buried.\"\"Very well,\" Gettum said, typing again. \"I'll play along. If this is aGrail-related issue, we should cross-reference against Grail keywords. I'll adda proximity parameter and remove the title weighting. That will limit our hitsonly to those instances of textual keywords that occur near a Grail-relatedword.\" Search for: KNIGHT, LONDON, POPE, TOMBWithin 100 word proximity of: GRAIL, ROSE, SANGREAL, CHALICE \"How long will this take?\" Sophie asked.\"A few hundred terabytes with multiple cross-referencing fields?\" Gettum's eyesglimmered as she clicked the SEARCH key. \"A mere fifteen minutes.\"Langdon and Sophie said nothing, but Gettum sensed this sounded like an eternityto them.\"Tea?\" Gettum asked, standing and walking toward the pot she had made earlier.\"Leigh always loves my tea.\" CHAPTER 93London's Opus Dei Centre is a modest brick building at 5 Orme Court, overlookingthe North Walk at Kensington Gardens. Silas had never been here, but he felt arising sense of refuge and asylum as he approached the building on foot. Despitethe rain, Rémy had dropped him off a short distance away in order to keep thelimousine off the main streets. Silas didn't mind the walk. The rain wascleansing.At Rémy's suggestion, Silas had wiped down his gun and disposed of it through asewer grate. He was glad to get rid of it. He felt lighter. His legs still achedfrom being bound all that time, but Silas had endured far greater pain. Hewondered, though, about Teabing, whom Rémy had left bound in the back of thelimousine. The Briton certainly had to be feeling the pain by now.\"What will you do with him?\" Silas had asked Rémy as they drove over here.Rémy had shrugged. \"That is a decision for the Teacher.\" There was an oddfinality in his tone.Now, as Silas approached the Opus Dei building, the rain began to fall harder,soaking his heavy robe, stinging the wounds of the day before. He was ready toleave behind the sins of the last twenty-four hours and purge his soul. His workwas done.Moving across a small courtyard to the front door, Silas was not surprised tofind the door unlocked. He opened it and stepped into the minimalist foyer. Amuted electronic chime sounded upstairs as Silas stepped onto the carpet. Thebell was a common feature in these halls where the residents spent most of theday in their rooms in prayer. Silas could hear movement above on the creaky woodfloors.A man in a cloak came downstairs. \"May I help you?\" He had kind eyes that seemednot even to register Silas's startling physical appearance.\"Thank you. My name is Silas. I am an Opus Dei numerary.\"\"American?\"Silas nodded. \"I am in town only for the day. Might I rest here?\"\"You need not even ask. There are two empty rooms on the third floor. Shall Ibring you some tea and bread?\"\"Thank you.\" Silas was famished.Silas went upstairs to a modest room with a window, where he took off his wetrobe and knelt down to pray in his undergarments. He heard his host come up andlay a tray outside his door. Silas finished his prayers, ate his food, and laydown to sleep. Three stories below, a phone was ringing. The Opus Dei numerary who had welcomedSilas answered the line.\"This is the London police,\" the caller said. \"We are trying to find an albinomonk. We've had a tip-off that he might be there. Have you seen him?\"The numerary was startled. \"Yes, he is here. Is something wrong?\"\"He is there now?\"\"Yes, upstairs praying. What is going on?\"\"Leave him precisely where he is,\" the officer commanded. \"Don't say a word toanyone. I'm sending officers over right away.\""},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 94St. James's Park is a sea of green in the middle of London, a public parkbordering the palaces of Westminster, Buckingham, and St. James's. Once enclosedby King Henry VIII and stocked with deer for the hunt, St. James's Park is nowopen to the public. On sunny afternoons, Londoners picnic beneath the willowsand feed the pond's resident pelicans, whose ancestors were a gift to Charles IIfrom the Russian ambassador.The Teacher saw no pelicans today. The stormy weather had brought insteadseagulls from the ocean. The lawns were covered with them—hundreds of whitebodies all facing the same direction, patiently riding out the damp wind.Despite the morning fog, the park afforded splendid views of the Houses ofParliament and Big Ben. Gazing across the sloping lawns, past the duck pond andthe delicate silhouettes of the weeping willows, the Teacher could see thespires of the building that housed the knight's tomb—the real reason he had toldRémy to come to this spot.As the Teacher approached the front passenger door of the parked limousine, Rémyleaned across and opened the door. The Teacher paused outside, taking a pullfrom the flask of cognac he was carrying. Then, dabbing his mouth, he slid inbeside Rémy and closed the door.Rémy held up the keystone like a trophy. \"It was almost lost.\"\"You have done well,\" the Teacher said.\"We have done well,\" Rémy replied, laying the keystone in the Teacher's eagerhands.The Teacher admired it a long moment, smiling. \"And the gun? You wiped it down?\"\"Back in the glove box where I found it.\"\"Excellent.\" The Teacher took another drink of cognac and handed the flask toRémy. \"Let's toast our success. The end is near.\" Rémy accepted the bottle gratefully. The cognac tasted salty, but Rémy didn'tcare. He and the Teacher were truly partners now. He could feel himselfascending to a higher station in life. I will never be a servant again. As Rémygazed down the embankment at the duck pond below, Château Villette seemed milesaway.Taking another swig from the flask, Rémy could feel the cognac warming hisblood. The warmth in Rémy's throat, however, mutated quickly to an uncomfortableheat. Loosening his bow tie, Rémy tasted an unpleasant grittiness and handed theflask back to the Teacher. \"I've probably had enough,\" he managed, weakly.Taking the flask, the Teacher said, \"Rémy, as you are aware, you are the onlyone who knows my face. I placed enormous trust in you.\"\"Yes,\" he said, feeling feverish as he loosened his tie further. \"And youridentity shall go with me to the grave.\"The Teacher was silent a long moment. \"I believe you.\" Pocketing the flask andthe keystone, the Teacher reached for the glove box and pulled out the tinyMedusa revolver. For an instant, Rémy felt a surge of fear, but the Teachersimply slipped it in his trousers pocket.What is he doing? Rémy felt himself sweating suddenly.\"I know I promised you freedom,\" the Teacher said, his voice now soundingregretful. \"But considering your circumstances, this is the best I can do.\"The swelling in Rémy's throat came on like an earthquake, and he lurched againstthe steering column, grabbing his throat and tasting vomit in his narrowingesophagus. He let out a muted croak of a scream, not even loud enough to beheard outside the car. The saltiness in the cognac now registered.I'm being murdered!Incredulous, Rémy turned to see the Teacher sitting calmly beside him, staringstraight ahead out the windshield. Rémy's eyesight blurred, and he gasped forbreath. I made everything possible for him! How could he do this! Whether theTeacher had intended to kill Rémy all along or whether it had been Rémy'sactions in the Temple Church that had made the Teacher lose faith, Rémy wouldnever know. Terror and rage coursed through him now. Rémy tried to lunge for theTeacher, but his stiffening body could barely move. I trusted you witheverything!Rémy tried to lift his clenched fists to blow the horn, but instead he slippedsideways, rolling onto the seat, lying on his side beside the Teacher, clutchingat his throat. The rain fell harder now. Rémy could no longer see, but he couldsense his oxygen-deprived brain straining to cling to his last faint shreds oflucidity. As his world slowly went black, Rémy Legaludec could have sworn heheard the sounds of the soft Riviera surf. The Teacher stepped from the limousine, pleased to see that nobody was lookingin his direction. I had no choice, he told himself, surprised how little remorsehe felt for what he had just done. Rémy sealed his own fate. The Teacher hadfeared all along that Rémy might need to be eliminated when the mission wascomplete, but by brazenly showing himself in the Temple Church, Rémy hadaccelerated the necessity dramatically. Robert Langdon's unexpected visit toChâteau Villette had brought the Teacher both a fortuitous windfall and anintricate dilemma. Langdon had delivered the keystone directly to the heart ofthe operation, which was a pleasant surprise, and yet he had brought the policeon his tail. Rémy's prints were all over Château Villette, as well as in thebarn's listening post, where Rémy had carried out the surveillance. The Teacherwas grateful he had taken so much care in preventing any ties between Rémy'sactivities and his own. Nobody could implicate the Teacher unless Rémy talked,and that was no longer a concern.One more loose end to tie up here, the Teacher thought, moving now toward therear door of the limousine. The police will have no idea what happened... and noliving witness left to tell them. Glancing around to ensure nobody was watching,he pulled open the door and climbed into the spacious rear compartment. Minutes later, the Teacher was crossing St. James's Park. Only two people nowremain. Langdon and Neveu. They were more complicated. But manageable. At themoment, however, the Teacher had the cryptex to attend to.Gazing triumphantly across the park, he could see his destination. In Londonlies a knight a Pope interred. As soon as the Teacher had heard the poem, he hadknown the answer. Even so, that the others had not figured it out was notsurprising. I have an unfair advantage. Having listened to Saunière'sconversations for months now, the Teacher had heard the Grand Master mentionthis famous knight on occasion, expressing esteem almost matching that he heldfor Da Vinci. The poem's reference to the knight was brutally simple once onesaw it—a credit to Saunière's wit—and yet how this tomb would reveal the finalpassword was still a mystery.You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.The Teacher vaguely recalled photos of the famous tomb and, in particular, itsmost distinguishing feature. A magnificent orb. The huge sphere mounted atop thetomb was almost as large as the tomb itself. The presence of the orb seemed bothencouraging and troubling to the Teacher. On one hand, it felt like a signpost,and yet, according to the poem, the missing piece of the puzzle was an orb thatought to be on his tomb... not one that was already there. He was counting onhis closer inspection of the tomb to unveil the answer.The rain was getting heavier now, and he tucked the cryptex deep in hisright-hand pocket to protect it from the dampness. He kept the tiny Medusarevolver in his left, out of sight. Within minutes, he was stepping into thequiet sanctuary of London's grandest nine-hundred-year-old building. Just as the Teacher was stepping out of the rain, Bishop Aringarosa was steppinginto it. On the rainy tarmac at Biggin Hill Executive Airport, Aringarosaemerged from his cramped plane, bundling his cassock against the cold damp. Hehad hoped to be greeted by Captain Fache. Instead a young British police officerapproached with an umbrella.\"Bishop Aringarosa? Captain Fache had to leave. He asked me to look after you.He suggested I take you to Scotland Yard. He thought it would be safest.\"Safest? Aringarosa looked down at the heavy briefcase of Vatican bonds clutchedin his hand. He had almost forgotten. \"Yes, thank you.\"Aringarosa climbed into the police car, wondering where Silas could be. Minuteslater, the police scanner crackled with the answer.5 Orme Court.Aringarosa recognized the address instantly.The Opus Dei Centre in London.He spun to the driver. \"Take me there at once!\" CHAPTER 95Langdon's eyes had not left the computer screen since the search began.Five minutes. Only two hits. Both irrelevant.He was starting to get worried.Pamela Gettum was in the adjoining room, preparing hot drinks. Langdon andSophie had inquired unwisely if there might be some coffee brewing alongside thetea Gettum had offered, and from the sound of the microwave beeps in the nextroom, Langdon suspected their request was about to be rewarded with instantNescafe.Finally, the computer pinged happily.\"Sounds like you got another,\" Gettum called from the next room. \"What's thetitle?\"Langdon eyed the screen. Grail Allegory in Medieval Literature: A Treatise on Sir Gawain and the GreenKnight. \"Allegory of the Green Knight,\" he called back.\"No good,\" Gettum said. \"Not many mythological green giants buried in London.\"Langdon and Sophie sat patiently in front of the screen and waited through twomore dubious returns. When the computer pinged again, though, the offering wasunexpected. DIE OPERN VON RICHARD WAGNER \"The operas of Wagner?\" Sophie asked.Gettum peeked back in the doorway, holding a packet of instant coffee. \"Thatseems like a strange match. Was Wagner a knight?\"\"No,\" Langdon said, feeling a sudden intrigue. \"But he was a well-knownFreemason.\" Along with Mozart, Beethoven, Shakespeare, Gershwin, Houdini, andDisney. Volumes had been written about the ties between the Masons and theKnights Templar, the Priory of Sion, and the Holy Grail. \"I want to look at thisone. How do I see the full text?\"\"You don't want the full text,\" Gettum called. \"Click on the hypertext title.The computer will display your keyword hits along with mono prelogs and triplepostlogs for context.\"Langdon had no idea what she had just said, but he clicked anyway.A new window popped up. ...mythological knight named Parsifal who......metaphorical Grail quest that arguably......the London Philharmonic in 1855...Rebecca Pope's opera anthology \"Diva's......Wagner's tomb in Bayreuth, Germany... \"Wrong Pope,\" Langdon said, disappointed. Even so, he was amazed by the system'sease of use. The keywords with context were enough to remind him that Wagner'sopera Parsifal was a tribute to Mary Magdalene and the bloodline of JesusChrist, told through the story of a young knight on a quest for truth.\"Just be patient,\" Gettum urged. \"It's a numbers game. Let the machine run.\"Over the next few minutes, the computer returned several more Grail references,including a text about troubadours—France's famous wandering minstrels. Langdonknew it was no coincidence that the word minstrel and minister shared anetymological root. The troubadours were the traveling servants or \"ministers\" ofthe Church of Mary Magdalene, using music to disseminate the story of the sacredfeminine among the common folk. To this day, the troubadours sang songsextolling the virtues of \"our Lady\"—a mysterious and beautiful woman to whomthey pledged themselves forever.Eagerly, he checked the hypertext but found nothing.The computer pinged again. KNIGHTS, KNAVES, POPES, AND PENTACLES: THE HISTORY OF THE HOLY GRAIL THROUGHTAROT \"Not surprising,\" Langdon said to Sophie. \"Some of our keywords have the samenames as individual cards.\" He reached for the mouse to click on a hyperlink.\"I'm not sure if your grandfather ever mentioned it when you played Tarot withhim, Sophie, but this game is a 'flash-card catechism' into the story of theLost Bride and her subjugation by the evil Church.\"Sophie eyed him, looking incredulous. \"I had no idea.\"\"That's the point. By teaching through a metaphorical game, the followers of theGrail disguised their message from the watchful eye of the Church.\" Langdonoften wondered how many modern card players had any clue that their foursuits—spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds—were Grail-related symbols that camedirectly from Tarot's four suits of swords, cups, scepters, and pentacles.Spades were Swords—The blade. Male.Hearts were Cups—The chalice. Feminine.Clubs were Scepters—The Royal Line. The flowering staff.Diamonds were Pentacles—The goddess. The sacred feminine. Four minutes later, as Langdon began feeling fearful they would not find whatthey had come for, the computer produced another hit. The Gravity of Genius: Biography of a Modern Knight. \"Gravity of Genius?\" Langdon called out to Gettum. \"Bio of a modern knight?\"Gettum stuck her head around the corner. \"How modern? Please don't tell me it'syour Sir Rudy Giuliani. Personally, I found that one a bit off the mark.\"Langdon had his own qualms about the newly knighted Sir Mick Jagger, but thishardly seemed the moment to debate the politics of modern British knighthood.\"Let's have a look.\" Langdon summoned up the hypertext keywords. ... honorable knight, Sir Isaac Newton...... in London in 1727 and...... his tomb in Westminster Abbey...... Alexander Pope, friend and colleague... \"I guess 'modern' is a relative term,\" Sophie called to Gettum. \"It's an oldbook. About Sir Isaac Newton.\"Gettum shook her head in the doorway. \"No good. Newton was buried in WestminsterAbbey, the seat of English Protestantism. There's no way a Catholic Pope waspresent. Cream and sugar?\"Sophie nodded.Gettum waited. \"Robert?\"Langdon's heart was hammering. He pulled his eyes from the screen and stood up.\"Sir Isaac Newton is our knight.\"Sophie remained seated. \"What are you talking about?\"\"Newton is buried in London,\" Langdon said. \"His labors produced new sciencesthat incurred the wrath of the Church. And he was a Grand Master of the Prioryof Sion. What more could we want?\"\"What more?\" Sophie pointed to the poem. \"How about a knight a Pope interred?You heard Ms. Gettum. Newton was not buried by a Catholic Pope.\"Langdon reached for the mouse. \"Who said anything about a Catholic Pope?\" Heclicked on the \"Pope\" hyperlink, and the complete sentence appeared. Sir Isaac Newton's burial, attended by kings and nobles, was presided over byAlexander Pope, friend and colleague, who gave a stirring eulogy beforesprinkling dirt on the tomb. Langdon looked at Sophie. \"We had the correct Pope on our second hit.Alexander.\" He paused. \"A. Pope.\"In London lies a knight A. Pope interred.Sophie stood up, looking stunned.Jacques Saunière, the master of double-entendres, had proven once again that hewas a frighteningly clever man. CHAPTER 96Silas awoke with a start.He had no idea what had awoken him or how long he had been asleep. Was Idreaming? Sitting up now on his straw mat, he listened to the quiet breathing ofthe Opus Dei residence hall, the stillness textured only by the soft murmurs ofsomeone praying aloud in a room below him. These were familiar sounds and shouldhave comforted him.And yet he felt a sudden and unexpected wariness.Standing, wearing only his undergarments, Silas walked to the window. Was Ifollowed? The courtyard below was deserted, exactly as he had seen it when heentered. He listened. Silence. So why am I uneasy? Long ago Silas had learned totrust his intuition. Intuition had kept him alive as a child on the streets ofMarseilles long before prison... long before he was born again by the hand ofBishop Aringarosa. Peering out the window, he now saw the faint outline of a carthrough the hedge. On the car's roof was a police siren. A floorboard creaked inthe hallway. A door latch moved.Silas reacted on instinct, surging across the room and sliding to a stop justbehind the door as it crashed open. The first police officer stormed through,swinging his gun left then right at what appeared an empty room. Before herealized where Silas was, Silas had thrown his shoulder into the door, crushinga second officer as he came through. As the first officer wheeled to shoot,Silas dove for his legs. The gun went off, the bullet sailing above Silas'shead, just as he connected with the officer's shins, driving his legs out fromunder him, and sending the man down, his head hitting the floor. The secondofficer staggered to his feet in the doorway, and Silas drove a knee into hisgroin, then went clambering over the writhing body into the hall.Almost naked, Silas hurled his pale body down the staircase. He knew he had beenbetrayed, but by whom? When he reached the foyer, more officers were surgingthrough the front door. Silas turned the other way and dashed deeper into theresidence hall. The women's entrance. Every Opus Dei building has one. Windingdown narrow hallways, Silas snaked through a kitchen, past terrified workers,who left to avoid the naked albino as he knocked over bowls and silverware,bursting into a dark hallway near the boiler room. He now saw the door hesought, an exit light gleaming at the end.Running full speed through the door out into the rain, Silas leapt off the lowlanding, not seeing the officer coming the other way until it was too late. Thetwo men collided, Silas's broad, naked shoulder grinding into the man's sternumwith crushing force. He drove the officer backward onto the pavement, landinghard on top of him. The officer's gun clattered away. Silas could hear menrunning down the hall shouting. Rolling, he grabbed the loose gun just as theofficers emerged. A shot rang out on the stairs, and Silas felt a searing painbelow his ribs. Filled with rage, he opened fire at all three officers, theirblood spraying.A dark shadow loomed behind, coming out of nowhere. The angry hands that grabbedat his bare shoulders felt as if they were infused with the power of the devilhimself. The man roared in his ear. SILAS, NO!Silas spun and fired. Their eyes met. Silas was already screaming in horror asBishop Aringarosa fell. CHAPTER 97More than three thousand people are entombed or enshrined within WestminsterAbbey. The colossal stone interior burgeons with the remains of kings,statesmen, scientists, poets, and musicians. Their tombs, packed into every lastniche and alcove, range in grandeur from the most regal of mausoleums—that ofQueen Elizabeth I, whose canopied sarcophagus inhabits its own private, apsidalchapel—down to the most modest etched floor tiles whose inscriptions have wornaway with centuries of foot traffic, leaving it to one's imagination whoserelics might lie below the tile in the undercroft.Designed in the style of the great cathedrals of Amiens, Chartres, andCanterbury, Westminster Abbey is considered neither cathedral nor parish church.It bears the classification of royal peculiar, subject only to the Sovereign.Since hosting the coronation of William the Conqueror on Christmas Day in 1066,the dazzling sanctuary has witnessed an endless procession of royal ceremoniesand affairs of state—from the canonization of Edward the Confessor, to themarriage of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, to the funerals of Henry V, QueenElizabeth I, and Lady Diana.Even so, Robert Langdon currently felt no interest in any of the abbey's ancienthistory, save one event—the funeral of the British knight Sir Isaac Newton.In London lies a knight a Pope interred.Hurrying through the grand portico on the north transept, Langdon and Sophiewere met by guards who politely ushered them through the abbey's newestaddition—a large walk-through metal detector—now present in most historicbuildings in London. They both passed through without setting off the alarm andcontinued to the abbey entrance.Stepping across the threshold into Westminster Abbey, Langdon felt the outsideworld evaporate with a sudden hush. No rumble of traffic. No hiss of rain. Justa deafening silence, which seemed to reverberate back and forth as if thebuilding were whispering to itself.Langdon's and Sophie's eyes, like those of almost every visitor, shiftedimmediately skyward, where the abbey's great abyss seemed to explode overhead.Gray stone columns ascended like redwoods into the shadows, arching gracefullyover dizzying expanses, and then shooting back down to the stone floor. Beforethem, the wide alley of the north transept stretched out like a deep canyon,flanked by sheer cliffs of stained glass. On sunny days, the abbey floor was aprismatic patchwork of light. Today, the rain and darkness gave this massivehollow a wraithlike aura... more like that of the crypt it truly was.\"It's practically empty,\" Sophie whispered.Langdon felt disappointed. He had hoped for a lot more people. A more publicplace. Their earlier experience in the deserted Temple Church was not oneLangdon wanted to repeat. He had been anticipating a certain feeling of securityin the popular tourist destination, but Langdon's recollections of bustlingthrongs in a well-lit abbey had been formed during the peak summer touristseason. Today was a rainy April morning. Rather than crowds and shimmeringstained glass, all Langdon saw was acres of desolate floor and shadowy, emptyalcoves.\"We passed through metal detectors,\" Sophie reminded, apparently sensingLangdon's apprehension. \"If anyone is in here, they can't be armed.\"Langdon nodded but still felt circumspect. He had wanted to bring the Londonpolice with them, but Sophie's fears of who might be involved put a damper onany contact with the authorities. We need to recover the cryptex, Sophie hadinsisted. It is the key to everything.She was right, of course.The key to getting Leigh back alive.The key to finding the Holy Grail.The key to learning who is behind this.Unfortunately, their only chance to recover the keystone seemed to be here andnow... at the tomb of Isaac Newton. Whoever held the cryptex would have to pay avisit to the tomb to decipher the final clue, and if they had not already comeand gone, Sophie and Langdon intended to intercept them.Striding toward the left wall to get out of the open, they moved into an obscureside aisle behind a row of pilasters. Langdon couldn't shake the image of LeighTeabing being held captive, probably tied up in the back of his own limousine.Whoever had ordered the top Priory members killed would not hesitate toeliminate others who stood in the way. It seemed a cruel irony that Teabing—amodern British knight—was a hostage in the search for his own countryman, SirIsaac Newton.\"Which way is it?\" Sophie asked, looking around.The tomb. Langdon had no idea. \"We should find a docent and ask.\"Langdon knew better than to wander aimlessly in here. Westminster Abbey was atangled warren of mausoleums, perimeter chambers, and walk-in burial niches.Like the Louvre's Grand Gallery, it had a lone point of entry—the door throughwhich they had just passed—easy to find your way in, but impossible to find yourway out. A literal tourist trap, one of Langdon's befuddled colleagues hadcalled it. Keeping architectural tradition, the abbey was laid out in the shapeof a giant crucifix. Unlike most churches, however, it had its entrance on theside, rather than the standard rear of the church via the narthex at the bottomof the nave. Moreover, the abbey had a series of sprawling cloisters attached.One false step through the wrong archway, and a visitor was lost in a labyrinthof outdoor passageways surrounded by high walls.\"Docents wear crimson robes,\" Langdon said, approaching the center of thechurch. Peering obliquely across the towering gilded altar to the far end of thesouth transept, Langdon saw several people crawling on their hands and knees.This prostrate pilgrimage was a common occurrence in Poets' Corner, although itwas far less holy than it appeared. Tourists doing grave rubbings.\"I don't see any docents,\" Sophie said. \"Maybe we can find the tomb on our own?\"Without a word, Langdon led her another few steps to the center of the abbey andpointed to the right.Sophie drew a startled breath as she looked down the length of the abbey's nave,the full magnitude of the building now visible. \"Aah,\" she said. \"Let's find adocent.\" At that moment, a hundred yards down the nave, out of sight behind the choirscreen, the stately tomb of Sir Isaac Newton had a lone visitor. The Teacher hadbeen scrutinizing the monument for ten minutes now.Newton's tomb consisted of a massive black-marble sarcophagus on which reclinedthe sculpted form of Sir Isaac Newton, wearing classical costume, and leaningproudly against a stack of his own books—Divinity, Chronology, Opticks, andPhilosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. At Newton's feet stood two wingedboys holding a scroll. Behind Newton's recumbent body rose an austere pyramid.Although the pyramid itself seemed an oddity, it was the giant shape mountedhalfway up the pyramid that most intrigued the Teacher.An orb.The Teacher pondered Saunière's beguiling riddle. You seek the orb that ought beon his tomb. The massive orb protruding from the face of the pyramid was carvedin basso-relievo and depicted all kinds of heavenly bodies—constellations, signsof the zodiac, comets, stars, and planets. Above it, the image of the Goddess ofAstronomy beneath a field of stars.Countless orbs.The Teacher had been convinced that once he found the tomb, discerning themissing orb would be easy. Now he was not so sure. He was gazing at acomplicated map of the heavens. Was there a missing planet? Had someastronomical orb been omitted from a constellation? He had no idea. Even so, theTeacher could not help but suspect that the solution would be ingeniously cleanand simple—\"a knight a pope interred.\" What orb am I looking for? Certainly, anadvanced knowledge of astrophysics was not a prerequisite for finding the HolyGrail, was it?It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb.The Teacher's concentration was broken by several approaching tourists. Heslipped the cryptex back in his pocket and watched warily as the visitors wentto a nearby table, left a donation in the cup, and restocked on thecomplimentary grave-rubbing supplies set out by the abbey. Armed with freshcharcoal pencils and large sheets of heavy paper, they headed off toward thefront of the abbey, probably to the popular Poets' Corner to pay their respectsto Chaucer, Tennyson, and Dickens by rubbing furiously on their graves.Alone again, he stepped closer to the tomb, scanning it from bottom to top. Hebegan with the clawed feet beneath the sarcophagus, moved upward past Newton,past his books on science, past the two boys with their mathematical scroll, upthe face of the pyramid to the giant orb with its constellations, and finally upto the niche's star-filled canopy.What orb ought to be here... and yet is missing? He touched the cryptex in hispocket as if he could somehow divine the answer from Saunière's crafted marble.Only five letters separate me from the Grail.Pacing now near the corner of the choir screen, he took a deep breath andglanced up the long nave toward the main altar in the distance. His gaze droppedfrom the gilded altar down to the bright crimson robe of an abbey docent who wasbeing waved over by two very familiar individuals.Langdon and Neveu.Calmly, the Teacher moved two steps back behind the choir screen. That was fast.He had anticipated Langdon and Sophie would eventually decipher the poem'smeaning and come to Newton's tomb, but this was sooner than he had imagined.Taking a deep breath, the Teacher considered his options. He had grownaccustomed to dealing with surprises.I am holding the cryptex.Reaching down to his pocket, he touched the second object that gave him hisconfidence: the Medusa revolver. As expected, the abbey's metal detectors hadblared as the Teacher passed through with the concealed gun. Also as expected,the guards had backed off at once when the Teacher glared indignantly andflashed his identification card. Official rank always commanded the properrespect.Although initially the Teacher had hoped to solve the cryptex alone and avoidany further complications, he now sensed that the arrival of Langdon and Neveuwas actually a welcome development. Considering the lack of success he washaving with the \"orb\" reference, he might be able to use their expertise. Afterall, if Langdon had deciphered the poem to find the tomb, there was a reasonablechance he also knew something about the orb. And if Langdon knew the password,then it was just a matter of applying the right pressure.Not here, of course.Somewhere private.The Teacher recalled a small announcement sign he had seen on his way into theabbey. Immediately he knew the perfect place to lure them.The only question now... what to use as bait. CHAPTER 98Langdon and Sophie moved slowly down the north aisle, keeping to the shadowsbehind the ample pillars that separated it from the open nave. Despite havingtraveled more than halfway down the nave, they still had no clear view ofNewton's tomb. The sarcophagus was recessed in a niche, obscured from thisoblique angle.\"At least there's nobody over there,\" Sophie whispered.Langdon nodded, relieved. The entire section of the nave near Newton's tomb wasdeserted. \"I'll go over,\" he whispered. \"You should stay hidden just in casesomeone—\"Sophie had already stepped from the shadows and was headed across the openfloor.\"—is watching,\" Langdon sighed, hurrying to join her.Crossing the massive nave on a diagonal, Langdon and Sophie remained silent asthe elaborate sepulchre revealed itself in tantalizing increments... ablack-marble sarcophagus... a reclining statue of Newton... two winged boys... ahuge pyramid... and... an enormous orb.\"Did you know about that?\" Sophie said, sounding startled.Langdon shook his head, also surprised.\"Those look like constellations carved on it,\" Sophie said.As they approached the niche, Langdon felt a slow sinking sensation. Newton'stomb was covered with orbs—stars, comets, planets. You seek the orb that oughtbe on his tomb? It could turn out to be like trying to find a missing blade ofgrass on a golf course.\"Astronomical bodies,\" Sophie said, looking concerned. \"And a lot of them.\"Langdon frowned. The only link between the planets and the Grail that Langdoncould imagine was the pentacle of Venus, and he had already tried the password\"Venus\" en route to the Temple Church.Sophie moved directly to the sarcophagus, but Langdon hung back a few feet,keeping an eye on the abbey around them.\"Divinity,\" Sophie said, tilting her head and reading the titles of the books onwhich Newton was leaning. \"Chronology. Opticks. Philosophiae Naturalis PrincipiaMathematica?\" She turned to him. \"Ring any bells?\"Langdon stepped closer, considering it. \"Principia Mathematica, as I remember,has something to do with the gravitation pull of planets... which admittedly areorbs, but it seems a little far-fetched.\"\"How about the signs of the zodiac?\" Sophie asked, pointing to theconstellations on the orb. \"You were talking about Pisces and Aquarius earlier,weren't you?\"The End of Days, Langdon thought. \"The end of Pisces and the beginning ofAquarius was allegedly the historical marker at which the Priory planned torelease the Sangreal documents to the world.\" But the millennium came and wentwithout incident, leaving historians uncertain when the truth was coming.\"It seems possible,\" Sophie said, \"that the Priory's plans to reveal the truthmight be related to the last line of the poem.\"It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb. Langdon felt a shiver of potential. Hehad not considered the line that way before.\"You told me earlier,\" she said, \"that the timing of the Priory's plans tounveil the truth about 'the Rose' and her fertile womb was linked directly tothe position of planets—orbs.\"Langdon nodded, feeling the first faint wisps of possibility materializing. Evenso, his intuition told him astronomy was not the key. The Grand Master'sprevious solutions had all possessed an eloquent, symbolic significance—the MonaLisa, Madonna of the Rocks, SOFIA. This eloquence was definitely lacking in theconcept of planetary orbs and the zodiac. Thus far, Jacques Saunière had provenhimself a meticulous code writer, and Langdon had to believe that his finalpassword—those five letters that unlocked the Priory's ultimate secret—wouldprove to be not only symbolically fitting but also crystal clear. If thissolution were anything like the others, it would be painfully obvious once itdawned.\"Look!\" Sophie gasped, jarring his thoughts as she grabbed his arm. From thefear in her touch Langdon sensed someone must be approaching, but when he turnedto her, she was staring aghast at the top of the black marble sarcophagus.\"Someone was here,\" she whispered, pointing to a spot on the sarcophagus nearNewton's outstretched right foot.Langdon did not understand her concern. A careless tourist had left a charcoal,grave-rubbing pencil on the sarcophagus lid near Newton's foot. It's nothing.Langdon reached out to pick it up, but as he leaned toward the sarcophagus, thelight shifted on the polished black-marble slab, and Langdon froze. Suddenly, hesaw why Sophie was afraid.Scrawled on the sarcophagus lid, at Newton's feet, shimmered a barely visiblecharcoal-pencil message: I have Teabing.Go through Chapter House,out south exit, to public garden. Langdon read the words twice, his heart pounding wildly.Sophie turned and scanned the nave.Despite the pall of trepidation that settled over him upon seeing the words,Langdon told himself this was good news. Leigh is still alive. There was anotherimplication here too. \"They don't know the password either,\" he whispered.Sophie nodded. Otherwise why make their presence known?\"They may want to trade Leigh for the password.\"\"Or it's a trap.\"Langdon shook his head. \"I don't think so. The garden is outside the abbeywalls. A very public place.\" Langdon had once visited the abbey's famous CollegeGarden—a small fruit orchard and herb garden—left over from the days when monksgrew natural pharmacological remedies here. Boasting the oldest living fruittrees in Great Britain, College Garden was a popular spot for tourists to visitwithout having to enter the abbey. \"I think sending us outside is a show offaith. So we feel safe.\"Sophie looked dubious. \"You mean outside, where there are no metal detectors?\"Langdon scowled. She had a point.Gazing back at the orb-filled tomb, Langdon wished he had some idea about thecryptex password... something with which to negotiate. I got Leigh involved inthis, and I'll do whatever it takes if there is a chance to help him.\"The note says to go through the Chapter House to the south exit,\" Sophie said.\"Maybe from the exit we would have a view of the garden? That way we couldassess the situation before we walked out there and exposed ourselves to anydanger?\"The idea was a good one. Langdon vaguely recalled the Chapter House as a hugeoctagonal hall where the original British Parliament convened in the days beforethe modern Parliament building existed. It had been years since he had beenthere, but he remembered it being out through the cloister somewhere. Takingseveral steps back from the tomb, Langdon peered around the choir screen to hisright, across the nave to the side opposite that which they had descended.A gaping vaulted passageway stood nearby, with a large sign. THIS WAY TO:CLOISTERSDEANERYCOLLEGE HALLMUSEUMPYX CHAMBERST. FAITH'S CHAPELCHAPTER HOUSE Langdon and Sophie were jogging as they passed beneath the sign, moving tooquickly to notice the small announcement apologizing that certain areas wereclosed for renovations.They emerged immediately into a high-walled, open-roof courtyard through whichmorning rain was falling. Above them, the wind howled across the opening with alow drone, like someone blowing over the mouth of a bottle. Entering the narrow,low-hanging walkways that bordered the courtyard perimeter, Langdon felt thefamiliar uneasiness he always felt in enclosed spaces. These walkways werecalled cloisters, and Langdon noted with uneasiness that these particularcloisters lived up to their Latin ties to the word claustrophobic.Focusing his mind straight ahead toward the end of the tunnel, Langdon followedthe signs for the Chapter House. The rain was spitting now, and the walkway wascold and damp with gusts of rain that blew through the lone pillared wall thatwas the cloister's only source of light. Another couple scurried past them theother way, hurrying to get out of the worsening weather. The cloisters lookeddeserted now, admittedly the abbey's least enticing section in the wind andrain.Forty yards down the east cloister, an archway materialized on their left,giving way to another hallway. Although this was the entrance they were lookingfor, the opening was cordoned off by a swag and an official-looking sign. CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONPYX CHAMBERST. FAITH'S CHAPELCHAPTER HOUSE The long, deserted corridor beyond the swag was littered with scaffolding anddrop cloths. Immediately beyond the swag, Langdon could see the entrances to thePyx Chamber and St. Faith's Chapel on the right and left. The entrance to theChapter House, however, was much farther away, at the far end of the longhallway. Even from here, Langdon could see that its heavy wooden door was wideopen, and the spacious octagonal interior was bathed in a grayish natural lightfrom the room's enormous windows that looked out on College Garden. Go throughChapter House, out south exit, to public garden.\"We just left the east cloister,\" Langdon said, \"so the south exit to the gardenmust be through there and to the right.\"Sophie was already stepping over the swag and moving forward.As they hurried down the dark corridor, the sounds of the wind and rain from theopen cloister faded behind them. The Chapter House was a kind of satellitestructure—a freestanding annex at the end of the long hallway to ensure theprivacy of the Parliament proceedings housed there.\"It looks huge,\" Sophie whispered as they approached.Langdon had forgotten just how large this room was. Even from outside theentrance, he could gaze across the vast expanse of floor to the breathtakingwindows on the far side of the octagon, which rose five stories to a vaultedceiling. They would certainly have a clear view of the garden from in here.Crossing the threshold, both Langdon and Sophie found themselves having tosquint. After the gloomy cloisters, the Chapter House felt like a solarium. Theywere a good ten feet into the room, searching the south wall, when they realizedthe door they had been promised was not there.They were standing in an enormous dead end.The creaking of a heavy door behind them made them turn, just as the door closedwith a resounding thud and the latch fell into place.The lone man who had been standing behind the door looked calm as he aimed asmall revolver at them. He was portly and was propped on a pair of aluminumcrutches.For a moment Langdon thought he must be dreaming.It was Leigh Teabing. CHAPTER 99Sir Leigh Teabing felt rueful as he gazed out over the barrel of his Medusarevolver at Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu. \"My friends,\" he said, \"since themoment you walked into my home last night, I have done everything in my power tokeep you out of harm's way. But your persistence has now put me in a difficultposition.\"He could see the expressions of shock and betrayal on Sophie's and Langdon'sfaces, and yet he was confident that soon they would both understand the chainof events that had guided the three of them to this unlikely crossroads.There is so much I have to tell you both... so much you do not yet understand.\"Please believe,\" Teabing said, \"I never had any intention of your beinginvolved. You came to my home. You came searching for me.\"\"Leigh?\" Langdon finally managed. \"What the hell are you doing? We thought youwere in trouble. We came here to help you!\"\"As I trusted you would,\" he said. \"We have much to discuss.\"Langdon and Sophie seemed unable to tear their stunned gazes from the revolveraimed at them.\"It is simply to ensure your full attention,\" Teabing said. \"If I had wanted toharm you, you would be dead by now. When you walked into my home last night, Irisked everything to spare your lives. I am a man of honor, and I vowed in mydeepest conscience only to sacrifice those who had betrayed the Sangreal.\"\"What are you talking about?\" Langdon said. \"Betrayed the Sangreal?\"\"I discovered a terrible truth,\" Teabing said, sighing. \"I learned why theSangreal documents were never revealed to the world. I learned that the Prioryhad decided not to release the truth after all. That's why the millennium passedwithout any revelation, why nothing happened as we entered the End of Days.\"Langdon drew a breath, about to protest.\"The Priory,\" Teabing continued, \"was given a sacred charge to share the truth.To release the Sangreal documents when the End of Days arrived. For centuries,men like Da Vinci, Botticelli, and Newton risked everything to protect thedocuments and carry out that charge. And now, at the ultimate moment of truth,Jacques Saunière changed his mind. The man honored with the greatestresponsibility in Christian history eschewed his duty. He decided the time wasnot right.\" Teabing turned to Sophie. \"He failed the Grail. He failed thePriory. And he failed the memory of all the generations that had worked to makethat moment possible.\"\"You?\" Sophie declared, glancing up now, her green eyes boring into him withrage and realization. \"You are the one responsible for my grandfather's murder?\"Teabing scoffed. \"Your grandfather and his sénéchaux were traitors to theGrail.\"Sophie felt a fury rising from deep within. He's lying!Teabing's voice was relentless. \"Your grandfather sold out to the Church. It isobvious they pressured him to keep the truth quiet.\"Sophie shook her head. \"The Church had no influence on my grandfather!\"Teabing laughed coldly. \"My dear, the Church has two thousand years ofexperience pressuring those who threaten to unveil its lies. Since the days ofConstantine, the Church has successfully hidden the truth about Mary Magdaleneand Jesus. We should not be surprised that now, once again, they have found away to keep the world in the dark. The Church may no longer employ crusaders toslaughter non-believers, but their influence is no less persuasive. No lessinsidious.\" He paused, as if to punctuate his next point. \"Miss Neveu, for sometime now your grandfather has wanted to tell you the truth about your family.\"Sophie was stunned. \"How could you know that?\"\"My methods are immaterial. The important thing for you to grasp right now isthis.\" He took a deep breath. \"The deaths of your mother, father, grandmother,and brother were not accidental.\"The words sent Sophie's emotions reeling. She opened her mouth to speak but wasunable.Langdon shook his head. \"What are you saying?\"\"Robert, it explains everything. All the pieces fit. History repeats itself. TheChurch has a precedent of murder when it comes to silencing the Sangreal. Withthe End of Days imminent, killing the Grand Master's loved ones sent a veryclear message. Be quiet, or you and Sophie are next.\"\"It was a car accident,\" Sophie stammered, feeling the childhood pain wellinginside her. \"An accident!\"\"Bedtime stories to protect your innocence,\" Teabing said. \"Consider that onlytwo family members went untouched—the Priory's Grand Master and his lonegranddaughter—the perfect pair to provide the Church with control over thebrotherhood. I can only imagine the terror the Church wielded over yourgrandfather these past years, threatening to kill you if he dared release theSangreal secret, threatening to finish the job they started unless Saunièreinfluenced the Priory to reconsider its ancient vow.\"\"Leigh,\" Langdon argued, now visibly riled, \"certainly you have no proof thatthe Church had anything to do with those deaths, or that it influenced thePriory's decision to remain silent.\"\"Proof?\" Teabing fired back. \"You want proof the Priory was influenced? The newmillennium has arrived, and yet the world remains ignorant! Is that not proofenough?\"In the echoes of Teabing's words, Sophie heard another voice speaking. Sophie, Imust tell you the truth about your family. She realized she was trembling. Couldthis possibly be that truth her grandfather had wanted to tell her? That herfamily had been murdered? What did she truly know about the crash that took herfamily? Only sketchy details. Even the stories in the newspaper had been vague.An accident? Bedtime stories? Sophie flashed suddenly on her grandfather'soverprotectiveness, how he never liked to leave her alone when she was young.Even when Sophie was grown and away at university, she had the sense hergrandfather was watching over. She wondered if there had been Priory members inthe shadows throughout her entire life, looking after her.\"You suspected he was being manipulated,\" Langdon said, glaring with disbeliefat Teabing. \"So you murdered him?\"\"I did not pull the trigger,\" Teabing said. \"Saunière was dead years ago, whenthe Church stole his family from him. He was compromised. Now he is free of thatpain, released from the shame caused by his inability to carry out his sacredduty. Consider the alternative. Something had to be done. Shall the world beignorant forever? Shall the Church be allowed to cement its lies into ourhistory books for all eternity? Shall the Church be permitted to influenceindefinitely with murder and extortion? No, something needed to be done! And nowwe are poised to carry out Saunière's legacy and right a terrible wrong.\" Hepaused. \"The three of us. Together.\"Sophie felt only incredulity. \"How could you possibly believe that we would helpyou?\"\"Because, my dear, you are the reason the Priory failed to release thedocuments. Your grandfather's love for you prevented him from challenging theChurch. His fear of reprisal against his only remaining family crippled him. Henever had a chance to explain the truth because you rejected him, tying hishands, making him wait. Now you owe the world the truth. You owe it to thememory of your grandfather.\" Robert Langdon had given up trying to get his bearings. Despite the torrent ofquestions running through his mind, he knew only one thing mattered now—gettingSophie out of here alive. All the guilt Langdon had mistakenly felt earlier forinvolving Teabing had now been transferred to Sophie.I took her to Château Villette. I am responsible.Langdon could not fathom that Leigh Teabing would be capable of killing them incold blood here in the Chapter House, and yet Teabing certainly had beeninvolved in killing others during his misguided quest. Langdon had the uneasyfeeling that gunshots in this secluded, thick-walled chamber would go unheard,especially in this rain. And Leigh just admitted his guilt to us.Langdon glanced at Sophie, who looked shaken. The Church murdered Sophie'sfamily to silence the Priory? Langdon felt certain the modern Church did notmurder people. There had to be some other explanation.\"Let Sophie leave,\" Langdon declared, staring at Leigh. \"You and I shoulddiscuss this alone.\"Teabing gave an unnatural laugh. \"I'm afraid that is one show of faith I cannotafford. I can, however, offer you this.\" He propped himself fully on hiscrutches, gracelessly keeping the gun aimed at Sophie, and removed the keystonefrom his pocket. He swayed a bit as he held it out for Langdon. \"A token oftrust, Robert.\"Robert felt wary and didn't move. Leigh is giving the keystone back to us?\"Take it,\" Teabing said, thrusting it awkwardly toward Langdon.Langdon could imagine only one reason Teabing would give it back. \"You opened italready. You removed the map.\"Teabing was shaking his head. \"Robert, if I had solved the keystone, I wouldhave disappeared to find the Grail myself and kept you uninvolved. No, I do notknow the answer. And I can admit that freely. A true knight learns humility inthe face of the Grail. He learns to obey the signs placed before him. When I sawyou enter the abbey, I understood. You were here for a reason. To help. I am notlooking for singular glory here. I serve a far greater master than my own pride.The Truth. Mankind deserves to know that truth. The Grail found us all, and nowshe is begging to be revealed. We must work together.\"Despite Teabing's pleas for cooperation and trust, his gun remained trained onSophie as Langdon stepped forward and accepted the cold marble cylinder. Thevinegar inside gurgled as Langdon grasped it and stepped backward. The dialswere still in random order, and the cryptex remained locked.Langdon eyed Teabing. \"How do you know I won't smash it right now?\"Teabing's laugh was an eerie chortle. \"I should have realized your threat tobreak it in the Temple Church was an empty one. Robert Langdon would never breakthe keystone. You are an historian, Robert. You are holding the key to twothousand years of history—the lost key to the Sangreal. You can feel the soulsof all the knights burned at the stake to protect her secret. Would you havethem die in vain? No, you will vindicate them. You will join the ranks of thegreat men you admire—Da Vinci, Botticelli, Newton—each of whom would have beenhonored to be in your shoes right now. The contents of the keystone are cryingout to us. Longing to be set free. The time has come. Destiny has led us to thismoment.\"\"I cannot help you, Leigh. I have no idea how to open this. I only saw Newton'stomb for a moment. And even if I knew the password...\" Langdon paused, realizinghe had said too much.\"You would not tell me?\" Teabing sighed. \"I am disappointed and surprised,Robert, that you do not appreciate the extent to which you are in my debt. Mytask would have been far simpler had Rémy and I eliminated you both when youwalked into Château Villette. Instead I risked everything to take the noblercourse.\"\"This is noble?\" Langdon demanded, eyeing the gun.\"Saunière's fault,\" Teabing said. \"He and his sénéchaux lied to Silas.Otherwise, I would have obtained the keystone without complication. How was I toimagine the Grand Master would go to such ends to deceive me and bequeath thekeystone to an estranged granddaughter?\" Teabing looked at Sophie with disdain.\"Someone so unqualified to hold this knowledge that she required a symbologistbaby-sitter.\" Teabing glanced back at Langdon. \"Fortunately, Robert, yourinvolvement turned out to be my saving grace. Rather than the keystone remaininglocked in the depository bank forever, you extracted it and walked into myhome.\"Where else would I run? Langdon thought. The community of Grail historians issmall, and Teabing and I have a history together.Teabing now looked smug. \"When I learned Saunière left you a dying message, Ihad a pretty good idea you were holding valuable Priory information. Whether itwas the keystone itself, or information on where to find it, I was not sure. Butwith the police on your heels, I had a sneaking suspicion you might arrive on mydoorstep.\"Langdon glared. \"And if we had not?\"\"I was formulating a plan to extend you a helping hand. One way or another, thekeystone was coming to Château Villette. The fact that you delivered it into mywaiting hands only serves as proof that my cause is just.\"\"What!\" Langdon was appalled.\"Silas was supposed to break in and steal the keystone from you in ChâteauVillette—thus removing you from the equation without hurting you, andexonerating me from any suspicion of complicity. However, when I saw theintricacy of Saunière's codes, I decided to include you both in my quest a bitlonger. I could have Silas steal the keystone later, once I knew enough to carryon alone.\"\"The Temple Church,\" Sophie said, her tone awash with betrayal. Light begins to dawn, Teabing thought. The Temple Church was the perfectlocation to steal the keystone from Robert and Sophie, and its apparentrelevance to the poem made it a plausible decoy. Rémy's orders had beenclear—stay out of sight while Silas recovers the keystone. Unfortunately,Langdon's threat to smash the keystone on the chapel floor had caused Rémy topanic. If only Rémy had not revealed himself, Teabing thought ruefully,recalling his own mock kidnapping. Rémy was the sole link to me, and he showedhis face!Fortunately, Silas remained unaware of Teabing's true identity and was easilyfooled into taking him from the church and then watching naively as Rémypretended to tie their hostage in the back of the limousine. With the soundproofdivider raised, Teabing was able to phone Silas in the front seat, use the fakeFrench accent of the Teacher, and direct Silas to go straight to Opus Dei. Asimple anonymous tip to the police was all it would take to remove Silas fromthe picture.One loose end tied up.The other loose end was harder. Rémy.Teabing struggled deeply with the decision, but in the end Rémy had provenhimself a liability. Every Grail quest requires sacrifice. The cleanest solutionhad been staring Teabing in the face from the limousine's wet bar—a flask, somecognac, and a can of peanuts. The powder at the bottom of the can would be morethan enough to trigger Rémy's deadly allergy. When Rémy parked the limo on HorseGuards Parade, Teabing climbed out of the back, walked to the side passengerdoor, and sat in the front next to Rémy. Minutes later, Teabing got out of thecar, climbed into the rear again, cleaned up the evidence, and finally emergedto carry out the final phase of his mission.Westminster Abbey had been a short walk, and although Teabing's leg braces,crutches, and gun had set off the metal detector, the rent-a-cops never knewwhat to do. Do we ask him to remove his braces and crawl through? Do we friskhis deformed body? Teabing presented the flustered guards a far easiersolution—an embossed card identifying him as Knight of the Realm. The poorfellows practically tripped over one another ushering him in.Now, eyeing the bewildered Langdon and Neveu, Teabing resisted the urge toreveal how he had brilliantly implicated Opus Dei in the plot that would soonbring about the demise of the entire Church. That would have to wait. Right nowthere was work to do.\"Mes amis,\" Teabing declared in flawless French, \"vous ne trouvez pas leSaint-Graal, c'est le Saint-Graal qui vous trouve.\" He smiled. \"Our pathstogether could not be more clear. The Grail has found us.\"Silence.He spoke to them in a whisper now. \"Listen. Can you hear it? The Grail isspeaking to us across the centuries. She is begging to be saved from thePriory's folly. I implore you both to recognize this opportunity. There couldnot possibly be three more capable people assembled at this moment to break thefinal code and open the cryptex.\" Teabing paused, his eyes alight. \"We need toswear an oath together. A pledge of faith to one another. A knight's allegianceto uncover the truth and make it known.\"Sophie stared deep into Teabing's eyes and spoke in a steely tone. \"I will neverswear an oath with my grandfather's murderer. Except an oath that I will see yougo to prison.\"Teabing's heart turned grave, then resolute. \"I am sorry you feel that way,mademoiselle.\" He turned and aimed the gun at Langdon. \"And you, Robert? Are youwith me, or against me?\" CHAPTER 100Bishop Manuel Aringarosa's body had endured many kinds of pain, and yet thesearing heat of the bullet wound in his chest felt profoundly foreign to him.Deep and grave. Not a wound of the flesh... but closer to the soul.He opened his eyes, trying to see, but the rain on his face blurred his vision.Where am I? He could feel powerful arms holding him, carrying his limp body likea rag doll, his black cassock flapping.Lifting a weary arm, he mopped his eyes and saw the man holding him was Silas.The great albino was struggling down a misty sidewalk, shouting for a hospital,his voice a heartrending wail of agony. His red eyes were focused dead ahead,tears streaming down his pale, blood-spattered face.\"My son,\" Aringarosa whispered, \"you're hurt.\"Silas glanced down, his visage contorted in anguish. \"I am so very sorry,Father.\" He seemed almost too pained to speak.\"No, Silas,\" Aringarosa replied. \"It is I who am sorry. This is my fault.\" TheTeacher promised me there would be no killing, and I told you to obey him fully.\"I was too eager. Too fearful. You and I were deceived.\" The Teacher was nevergoing to deliver us the Holy Grail.Cradled in the arms of the man he had taken in all those years ago, BishopAringarosa felt himself reel back in time. To Spain. To his modest beginnings,building a small Catholic church in Oviedo with Silas. And later, to New YorkCity, where he had proclaimed the glory of God with the towering Opus Dei Centeron Lexington Avenue.Five months ago, Aringarosa had received devastating news. His life's work wasin jeopardy. He recalled, with vivid detail, the meeting inside Castel Gandolfothat had changed his life... the news that had set this entire calamity intomotion.Aringarosa had entered Gandolfo's Astronomy Library with his head held high,fully expecting to be lauded by throngs of welcoming hands, all eager to pat himon the back for his superior work representing Catholicism in America.But only three people were present.The Vatican secretariat. Obese. Dour.Two high-ranking Italian cardinals. Sanctimonious. Smug.\"Secretariat?\" Aringarosa said, puzzled.The rotund overseer of legal affairs shook Aringarosa's hand and motioned to thechair opposite him. \"Please, make yourself comfortable.\"Aringarosa sat, sensing something was wrong.\"I am not skilled in small talk, Bishop,\" the secretariat said, \"so let me bedirect about the reason for your visit.\"\"Please. Speak openly.\" Aringarosa glanced at the two cardinals, who seemed tobe measuring him with self-righteous anticipation.\"As you are well aware,\" the secretariat said, \"His Holiness and others in Romehave been concerned lately with the political fallout from Opus Dei's morecontroversial practices.\"Aringarosa felt himself bristle instantly. He already had been through this onnumerous occasions with the new pontiff, who, to Aringarosa's great dismay, hadturned out to be a distressingly fervent voice for liberal change in the Church.\"I want to assure you,\" the secretariat added quickly, \"that His Holiness doesnot seek to change anything about the way you run your ministry.\"I should hope not! \"Then why am I here?\"The enormous man sighed. \"Bishop, I am not sure how to say this delicately, so Iwill state it directly. Two days ago, the Secretariat Council voted unanimouslyto revoke the Vatican's sanction of Opus Dei.\"Aringarosa was certain he had heard incorrectly. \"I beg your pardon?\"\"Plainly stated, six months from today, Opus Dei will no longer be considered aprelature of the Vatican. You will be a church unto yourself. The Holy See willbe disassociating itself from you. His Holiness agrees and we are alreadydrawing up the legal papers.\"\"But... that is impossible!\"\"On the contrary, it is quite possible. And necessary. His Holiness has becomeuneasy with your aggressive recruiting policies and your practices of corporalmortification.\" He paused. \"Also your policies regarding women. Quite frankly,Opus Dei has become a liability and an embarrassment.\"Bishop Aringarosa was stupefied. \"An embarrassment?\"\"Certainly you cannot be surprised it has come to this.\"\"Opus Dei is the only Catholic organization whose numbers are growing! We nowhave over eleven hundred priests!\"\"True. A troubling issue for us all.\"Aringarosa shot to his feet. \"Ask His Holiness if Opus Dei was an embarrassmentin 1982 when we helped the Vatican Bank!\"\"The Vatican will always be grateful for that,\" the secretariat said, his toneappeasing, \"and yet there are those who still believe your financial munificencein 1982 is the only reason you were granted prelature status in the firstplace.\"\"That is not true!\" The insinuation offended Aringarosa deeply.\"Whatever the case, we plan to act in good faith. We are drawing up severanceterms that will include a reimbursement of those monies. It will be paid in fiveinstallments.\"\"You are buying me off?\" Aringarosa demanded. \"Paying me to go quietly? WhenOpus Dei is the only remaining voice of reason!\"One of the cardinals glanced up. \"I'm sorry, did you say reason?\"Aringarosa leaned across the table, sharpening his tone to a point. \"Do youreally wonder why Catholics are leaving the Church? Look around you, Cardinal.People have lost respect. The rigors of faith are gone. The doctrine has becomea buffet line. Abstinence, confession, communion, baptism, mass—take yourpick—choose whatever combination pleases you and ignore the rest. What kind ofspiritual guidance is the Church offering?\"\"Third-century laws,\" the second cardinal said, \"cannot be applied to the modernfollowers of Christ. The rules are not workable in today's society.\"\"Well, they seem to be working for Opus Dei!\"\"Bishop Aringarosa,\" the secretariat said, his voice conclusive. \"Out of respectfor your organization's relationship with the previous Pope, His Holiness willbe giving Opus Dei six months to voluntarily break away from the Vatican. Isuggest you cite your differences of opinion with the Holy See and establishyourself as your own Christian organization.\"\"I refuse!\" Aringarosa declared. \"And I'll tell him that in person!\"\"I'm afraid His Holiness no longer cares to meet with you.\"Aringarosa stood up. \"He would not dare abolish a personal prelature establishedby a previous Pope!\"\"I'm sorry.\" The secretariat's eyes did not flinch. \"The Lord giveth and theLord taketh away.\"Aringarosa had staggered from that meeting in bewilderment and panic. Returningto New York, he stared out at the skyline in disillusionment for days,overwhelmed with sadness for the future of Christianity.It was several weeks later that he received the phone call that changed allthat. The caller sounded French and identified himself as the Teacher—a titlecommon in the prelature. He said he knew of the Vatican's plans to pull supportfrom Opus Dei.How could he know that? Aringarosa wondered. He had hoped only a handful ofVatican power brokers knew of Opus Dei's impending annulment. Apparently theword was out. When it came to containing gossip, no walls in the world were asporous as those surrounding Vatican City.\"I have ears everywhere, Bishop,\" the Teacher whispered, \"and with these ears Ihave gained certain knowledge. With your help, I can uncover the hiding place ofa sacred relic that will bring you enormous power... enough power to make theVatican bow before you. Enough power to save the Faith.\" He paused. \"Not justfor Opus Dei. But for all of us.\"The Lord taketh away... and the Lord giveth. Aringarosa felt a glorious ray ofhope. \"Tell me your plan.\" Bishop Aringarosa was unconscious when the doors of St. Mary's Hospital hissedopen. Silas lurched into the entryway delirious with exhaustion. Dropping to hisknees on the tile floor, he cried out for help. Everyone in the reception areagaped in wonderment at the half-naked albino offering forth a bleedingclergyman.The doctor who helped Silas heave the delirious bishop onto a gurney lookedgloomy as he felt Aringarosa's pulse. \"He's lost a lot of blood. I am nothopeful.\"Aringarosa's eyes flickered, and he returned for a moment, his gaze locatingSilas. \"My child...\"Silas's soul thundered with remorse and rage. \"Father, if it takes my lifetime,I will find the one who deceived us, and I will kill him.\"Aringarosa shook his head, looking sad as they prepared to wheel him away.\"Silas... if you have learned nothing from me, please... learn this.\" He tookSilas's hand and gave it a firm squeeze. \"Forgiveness is God's greatest gift.\"\"But Father...\"Aringarosa closed his eyes. \"Silas, you must pray.\" CHAPTER 101Robert Langdon stood beneath the lofty cupola of the deserted Chapter House andstared into the barrel of Leigh Teabing's gun.Robert, are you with me, or against me? The Royal Historian's words echoed inthe silence of Langdon's mind.There was no viable response, Langdon knew. Answer yes, and he would be sellingout Sophie. Answer no, and Teabing would have no choice but to kill them both.Langdon's years in the classroom had not imbued him with any skills relevant tohandling confrontations at gunpoint, but the classroom had taught him somethingabout answering paradoxical questions. When a question has no correct answer,there is only one honest response.The gray area between yes and no.Silence.Staring at the cryptex in his hands, Langdon chose simply to walk away.Without ever lifting his eyes, he stepped backward, out into the room's vastempty spaces. Neutral ground. He hoped his focus on the cryptex signaled Teabingthat collaboration might be an option, and that his silence signaled Sophie hehad not abandoned her.All the while buying time to think.The act of thinking, Langdon suspected, was exactly what Teabing wanted him todo. That's why he handed me the cryptex. So I could feel the weight of mydecision. The British historian hoped the touch of the Grand Master's cryptexwould make Langdon fully grasp the magnitude of its contents, coaxing hisacademic curiosity to overwhelm all else, forcing him to realize that failure tounlock the keystone would mean the loss of history itself.With Sophie at gunpoint across the room, Langdon feared that discovering thecryptex's elusive password would be his only remaining hope of bartering herrelease. If I can free the map, Teabing will negotiate. Forcing his mind to thiscritical task, Langdon moved slowly toward the far windows... allowing his mindto fill with the numerous astronomical images on Newton's tomb. You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb. Turning his back to the others, he walked toward the towering windows, searchingfor any inspiration in their stained-glass mosaics. There was none.Place yourself in Saunière's mind, he urged, gazing outward now into CollegeGarden. What would he believe is the orb that ought be on Newton's tomb? Imagesof stars, comets, and planets twinkled in the falling rain, but Langdon ignoredthem. Saunière was not a man of science. He was a man of humanity, of art, ofhistory. The sacred feminine... the chalice... the Rose... the banished MaryMagdalene... the decline of the goddess... the Holy Grail.Legend had always portrayed the Grail as a cruel mistress, dancing in theshadows just out of sight, whispering in your ear, luring you one more step andthen evaporating into the mist.Gazing out at the rustling trees of College Garden, Langdon sensed her playfulpresence. The signs were everywhere. Like a taunting silhouette emerging fromthe fog, the branches of Britain's oldest apple tree burgeoned with five-petaledblossoms, all glistening like Venus. The goddess was in the garden now. She wasdancing in the rain, singing songs of the ages, peeking out from behind thebud-filled branches as if to remind Langdon that the fruit of knowledge wasgrowing just beyond his reach. Across the room, Sir Leigh Teabing watched with confidence as Langdon gazed outthe window as if under a spell.Exactly as I hoped, Teabing thought. He will come around.For some time now, Teabing had suspected Langdon might hold the key to theGrail. It was no coincidence that Teabing launched his plan into action on thesame night Langdon was scheduled to meet Jacques Saunière. Listening in on thecurator, Teabing was certain the man's eagerness to meet privately with Langdoncould mean only one thing. Langdon's mysterious manuscript has touched a nervewith the Priory.Langdon has stumbled onto a truth, and Saunière fears its release. Teabing feltcertain the Grand Master was summoning Langdon to silence him.The Truth has been silenced long enough!Teabing knew he had to act quickly. Silas's attack would accomplish two goals.It would prevent Saunière from persuading Langdon to keep quiet, and it wouldensure that once the keystone was in Teabing's hands, Langdon would be in Parisfor recruitment should Teabing need him.Arranging the fatal meeting between Saunière and Silas had been almost too easy.I had inside information about Saunière's deepest fears. Yesterday afternoon,Silas had phoned the curator and posed as a distraught priest. \"MonsieurSaunière, forgive me, I must speak to you at once. I should never breach thesanctity of the confessional, but in this case, I feel I must. I just tookconfession from a man who claimed to have murdered members of your family.\"Saunière's response was startled but wary. \"My family died in an accident. Thepolice report was conclusive.\"\"Yes, a car accident,\" Silas said, baiting the hook. \"The man I spoke to said heforced their car off the road into a river.\"Saunière fell silent.\"Monsieur Saunière, I would never have phoned you directly except this man madea comment which makes me now fear for your safety.\" He paused. \"The man alsomentioned your granddaughter, Sophie.\"The mention of Sophie's name had been the catalyst. The curator leapt intoaction. He ordered Silas to come see him immediately in the safest locationSaunière knew—his Louvre office. Then he phoned Sophie to warn her she might bein danger. Drinks with Robert Langdon were instantly abandoned.Now, with Langdon separated from Sophie on the far side of the room, Teabingsensed he had successfully alienated the two companions from one another. SophieNeveu remained defiant, but Langdon clearly saw the larger picture. He wastrying to figure out the password. He understands the importance of finding theGrail and releasing her from bondage.\"He won't open it for you,\" Sophie said coldly. \"Even if he can.\"Teabing was glancing at Langdon as he held the gun on Sophie. He was fairlycertain now he was going to have to use the weapon. Although the idea troubledhim, he knew he would not hesitate if it came to that. I have given her everyopportunity to do the right thing. The Grail is bigger than any one of us.At that moment, Langdon turned from the window. \"The tomb...\" he said suddenly,facing them with a faint glimmer of hope in his eyes. \"I know where to look onNewton's tomb. Yes, I think I can find the password!\"Teabing's heart soared. \"Where, Robert? Tell me!\"Sophie sounded horrified. \"Robert, no! You're not going to help him, are you?\"Langdon approached with a resolute stride, holding the cryptex before him. \"No,\"he said, his eyes hardening as he turned to Leigh. \"Not until he lets you go.\"Teabing's optimism darkened. \"We are so close, Robert. Don't you dare startplaying games with me!\"\"No games,\" Langdon said. \"Let her go. Then I'll take you to Newton's tomb.We'll open the cryptex together.\"\"I'm not going anywhere,\" Sophie declared, her eyes narrowing with rage. \"Thatcryptex was given to me by my grandfather. It is not yours to open.\"Langdon wheeled, looking fearful. \"Sophie, please! You're in danger. I'm tryingto help you!\"\"How? By unveiling the secret my grandfather died trying to protect? He trustedyou, Robert. I trusted you!\"Langdon's blue eyes showed panic now, and Teabing could not help but smile tosee the two of them working against one another. Langdon's attempts to begallant were more pathetic than anything. On the verge of unveiling one ofhistory's greatest secrets, and he troubles himself with a woman who has provenherself unworthy of the quest.\"Sophie,\" Langdon pleaded. \"Please... you must leave.\"She shook her head. \"Not unless you either hand me the cryptex or smash it onthe floor.\"\"What?\" Langdon gasped.\"Robert, my grandfather would prefer his secret lost forever than see it in thehands of his murderer.\" Sophie's eyes looked as if they would well with tears,but they did not. She stared directly back at Teabing. \"Shoot me if you have to.I am not leaving my grandfather's legacy in your hands.\"Very well. Teabing aimed the weapon.\"No!\" Langdon shouted, raising his arm and suspending the cryptex precariouslyover the hard stone floor. \"Leigh, if you even think about it, I will dropthis.\"Teabing laughed. \"That bluff worked on Rémy. Not on me. I know you better thanthat.\"\"Do you, Leigh?\"Yes I do. Your poker face needs work, my friend. It took me several seconds, butI can see now that you are lying. You have no idea where on Newton's tomb theanswer lies. \"Truly, Robert? You know where on the tomb to look?\"\"I do.\"The falter in Langdon's eyes was fleeting but Leigh caught it. There was a liethere. A desperate, pathetic ploy to save Sophie. Teabing felt a profounddisappointment in Robert Langdon.I am a lone knight, surrounded by unworthy souls. And I will have to decipherthe keystone on my own.Langdon and Neveu were nothing but a threat to Teabing now... and to the Grail.As painful as the solution was going to be, he knew he could carry it out with aclean conscience. The only challenge would be to persuade Langdon to set downthe keystone so Teabing could safely end this charade.\"A show of faith,\" Teabing said, lowering the gun from Sophie. \"Set down thekeystone, and we'll talk.\" Langdon knew his lie had failed.He could see the dark resolve in Teabing's face and knew the moment was uponthem. When I set this down, he will kill us both. Even without looking atSophie, he could hear her heart beseeching him in silent desperation. Robert,this man is not worthy of the Grail. Please do not place it in his hands. Nomatter what the cost.Langdon had already made his decision several minutes ago, while standing aloneat the window overlooking College Garden.Protect Sophie.Protect the Grail.Langdon had almost shouted out in desperation. But I cannot see how!The stark moments of disillusionment had brought with them a clarity unlike anyhe had ever felt. The Truth is right before your eyes, Robert. He knew not fromwhere the epiphany came. The Grail is not mocking you, she is calling out to aworthy soul.Now, bowing down like a subject several yards in front of Leigh Teabing, Langdonlowered the cryptex to within inches of the stone floor.\"Yes, Robert,\" Teabing whispered, aiming the gun at him. \"Set it down.\"Langdon's eyes moved heavenward, up into the gaping void of the Chapter Housecupola. Crouching lower, Langdon lowered his gaze to Teabing's gun, aimeddirectly at him.\"I'm sorry, Leigh.\"In one fluid motion, Langdon leapt up, swinging his arm skyward, launching thecryptex straight up toward the dome above. Leigh Teabing did not feel his finger pull the trigger, but the Medusadischarged with a thundering crash. Langdon's crouched form was now vertical,almost airborne, and the bullet exploded in the floor near Langdon's feet. Halfof Teabing's brain attempted to adjust his aim and fire again in rage, but themore powerful half dragged his eyes upward into the cupola.The keystone!Time seemed to freeze, morphing into a slow-motion dream as Teabing's entireworld became the airborne keystone. He watched it rise to the apex of itsclimb... hovering for a moment in the void... and then tumbling downward, endover end, back toward the stone floor.All of Teabing's hopes and dreams were plummeting toward earth. It cannot strikethe floor! I can reach it! Teabing's body reacted on instinct. He released thegun and heaved himself forward, dropping his crutches as he reached out with hissoft, manicured hands. Stretching his arms and fingers, he snatched the keystonefrom midair.Falling forward with the keystone victoriously clutched in his hand, Teabingknew he was falling too fast. With nothing to break his fall, his outstretchedarms hit first, and the cryptex collided hard with the floor.There was a sickening crunch of glass within.For a full second, Teabing did not breathe. Lying there outstretched on the coldfloor, staring the length of his outstretched arms at the marble cylinder in hisbare palms, he implored the glass vial inside to hold. Then the acrid tang ofvinegar cut the air, and Teabing felt the cool liquid flowing out through thedials onto his palm.Wild panic gripped him. NO! The vinegar was streaming now, and Teabing picturedthe papyrus dissolving within. Robert, you fool! The secret is lost!Teabing felt himself sobbing uncontrollably. The Grail is gone. Everythingdestroyed. Shuddering in disbelief over Langdon's actions, Teabing tried toforce the cylinder apart, longing to catch a fleeting glimpse of history beforeit dissolved forever. To his shock, as he pulled the ends of the keystone, thecylinder separated.He gasped and peered inside. It was empty except for shards of wet glass. Nodissolving papyrus. Teabing rolled over and looked up at Langdon. Sophie stoodbeside him, aiming the gun down at Teabing.Bewildered, Teabing looked back at the keystone and saw it. The dials were nolonger at random. They spelled a five-letter word: APPLE. \"The orb from which Eve partook,\" Langdon said coolly, \"incurring the Holy wrathof God. Original sin. The symbol of the fall of the sacred feminine.\"Teabing felt the truth come crashing down on him in excruciating austerity. Theorb that ought be on Newton's tomb could be none other than the Rosy apple thatfell from heaven, struck Newton on the head, and inspired his life's work. Hislabor's fruit! The Rosy flesh with a seeded womb!\"Robert,\" Teabing stammered, overwhelmed. \"You opened it. Where... is the map?\"Without blinking, Langdon reached into the breast pocket of his tweed coat andcarefully extracted a delicate rolled papyrus. Only a few yards from whereTeabing lay, Langdon unrolled the scroll and looked at it. After a long moment,a knowing smile crossed Langdon's face.He knows! Teabing's heart craved that knowledge. His life's dream was right infront of him. \"Tell me!\" Teabing demanded. \"Please! Oh God, please! It's not toolate!\"As the sound of heavy footsteps thundered down the hall toward the ChapterHouse, Langdon quietly rolled the papyrus and slipped it back in his pocket.\"No!\" Teabing cried out, trying in vain to stand.When the doors burst open, Bezu Fache entered like a bull into a ring, his feraleyes scanning, finding his target—Leigh Teabing—helpless on the floor. Exhalingin relief, Fache holstered his Manurhin sidearm and turned to Sophie. \"AgentNeveu, I am relieved you and Mr. Langdon are safe. You should have come in whenI asked.\"The British police entered on Fache's heels, seizing the anguished prisoner andplacing him in handcuffs.Sophie seemed stunned to see Fache. \"How did you find us?\"Fache pointed to Teabing. \"He made the mistake of showing his ID when he enteredthe abbey. The guards heard a police broadcast about our search for him.\"\"It's in Langdon's pocket!\" Teabing was screaming like a madman. \"The map to theHoly Grail!\"As they hoisted Teabing and carried him out, he threw back his head and howled.\"Robert! Tell me where it's hidden!\"As Teabing passed, Langdon looked him in the eye. \"Only the worthy find theGrail, Leigh. You taught me that.\" CHAPTER 102The mist had settled low on Kensington Gardens as Silas limped into a quiethollow out of sight. Kneeling on the wet grass, he could feel a warm stream ofblood flowing from the bullet wound below his ribs. Still, he stared straightahead.The fog made it look like heaven here.Raising his bloody hands to pray, he watched the raindrops caress his fingers,turning them white again. As the droplets fell harder across his back andshoulders, he could feel his body disappearing bit by bit into the mist.I am a ghost.A breeze rustled past him, carrying the damp, earthy scent of new life. Withevery living cell in his broken body, Silas prayed. He prayed for forgiveness.He prayed for mercy. And, above all, he prayed for his mentor... BishopAringarosa... that the Lord would not take him before his time. He has so muchwork left to do.The fog was swirling around him now, and Silas felt so light that he was surethe wisps would carry him away. Closing his eyes, he said a final prayer.From somewhere in the mist, the voice of Manuel Aringarosa whispered to him.Our Lord is a good and merciful God.Silas's pain at last began to fade, and he knew the bishop was right. CHAPTER 103It was late afternoon when the London sun broke through and the city began todry. Bezu Fache felt weary as he emerged from the interrogation room and haileda cab. Sir Leigh Teabing had vociferously proclaimed his innocence, and yet fromhis incoherent rantings about the Holy Grail, secret documents, and mysteriousbrotherhoods, Fache suspected the wily historian was setting the stage for hislawyers to plead an insanity defense.Sure, Fache thought. Insane. Teabing had displayed ingenious precision informulating a plan that protected his innocence at every turn. He had exploitedboth the Vatican and Opus Dei, two groups that turned out to be completelyinnocent. His dirty work had been carried out unknowingly by a fanatical monkand a desperate bishop. More clever still, Teabing had situated his electroniclistening post in the one place a man with polio could not possibly reach. Theactual surveillance had been carried out by his manservant, Rémy—the lone personprivy to Teabing's true identity—now conveniently dead of an allergic reaction.Hardly the handiwork of someone lacking mental faculties, Fache thought.The information coming from Collet out of Château Villette suggested thatTeabing's cunning ran so deep that Fache himself might even learn from it. Tosuccessfully hide bugs in some of Paris's most powerful offices, the Britishhistorian had turned to the Greeks. Trojan horses. Some of Teabing's intendedtargets received lavish gifts of artwork, others unwittingly bid at auctions inwhich Teabing had placed specific lots. In Saunière's case, the curator hadreceived a dinner invitation to Château Villette to discuss the possibility ofTeabing's funding a new Da Vinci Wing at the Louvre. Saunière's invitation hadcontained an innocuous postscript expressing fascination with a robotic knightthat Saunière was rumored to have built. Bring him to dinner, Teabing hadsuggested. Saunière apparently had done just that and left the knight unattendedlong enough for Rémy Legaludec to make one inconspicuous addition.Now, sitting in the back of the cab, Fache closed his eyes. One more thing toattend to before I return to Paris. The St. Mary's Hospital recovery room was sunny.\"You've impressed us all,\" the nurse said, smiling down at him. \"Nothing shortof miraculous.\"Bishop Aringarosa gave a weak smile. \"I have always been blessed.\"The nurse finished puttering, leaving the bishop alone. The sunlight feltwelcome and warm on his face. Last night had been the darkest night of his life.Despondently, he thought of Silas, whose body had been found in the park.Please forgive me, my son.Aringarosa had longed for Silas to be part of his glorious plan. Last night,however, Aringarosa had received a call from Bezu Fache, questioning the bishopabout his apparent connection to a nun who had been murdered in Saint-Sulpice.Aringarosa realized the evening had taken a horrifying turn. News of the fouradditional murders transformed his horror to anguish. Silas, what have you done!Unable to reach the Teacher, the bishop knew he had been cut loose. Used. Theonly way to stop the horrific chain of events he had helped put in motion was toconfess everything to Fache, and from that moment on, Aringarosa and Fache hadbeen racing to catch up with Silas before the Teacher persuaded him to killagain.Feeling bone weary, Aringarosa closed his eyes and listened to the televisioncoverage of the arrest of a prominent British knight, Sir Leigh Teabing. TheTeacher laid bare for all to see. Teabing had caught wind of the Vatican's plansto disassociate itself from Opus Dei. He had chosen Aringarosa as the perfectpawn in his plan. After all, who more likely to leap blindly after the HolyGrail than a man like myself with everything to lose? The Grail would havebrought enormous power to anyone who possessed it.Leigh Teabing had protected his identity shrewdly—feigning a French accent and apious heart, and demanding as payment the one thing he did not need—money.Aringarosa had been far too eager to be suspicious. The price tag of twentymillion euro was paltry when compared with the prize of obtaining the Grail, andwith the Vatican's separation payment to Opus Dei, the finances had workednicely. The blind see what they want to see. Teabing's ultimate insult, ofcourse, had been to demand payment in Vatican bonds, such that if anything wentwrong, the investigation would lead to Rome.\"I am glad to see you're well, My Lord.\"Aringarosa recognized the gruff voice in the doorway, but the face wasunexpected—stern, powerful features, slicked-back hair, and a broad neck thatstrained against his dark suit. \"Captain Fache?\" Aringarosa asked. Thecompassion and concern the captain had shown for Aringarosa's plight last nighthad conjured images of a far gentler physique.The captain approached the bed and hoisted a familiar, heavy black briefcaseonto a chair. \"I believe this belongs to you.\"Aringarosa looked at the briefcase filled with bonds and immediately lookedaway, feeling only shame. \"Yes... thank you.\" He paused while working hisfingers across the seam of his bedsheet, then continued. \"Captain, I have beengiving this deep thought, and I need to ask a favor of you.\"\"Of course.\"\"The families of those in Paris who Silas...\" He paused, swallowing the emotion.\"I realize no sum could possibly serve as sufficient restitution, and yet, ifyou could be kind enough to divide the contents of this briefcase among them...the families of the deceased.\"Fache's dark eyes studied him a long moment. \"A virtuous gesture, My Lord. Iwill see to it your wishes are carried out.\"A heavy silence fell between them.On the television, a lean French police officer was giving a press conference infront of a sprawling mansion. Fache saw who it was and turned his attention tothe screen.\"Lieutenant Collet,\" a BBC reporter said, her voice accusing. \"Last night, yourcaptain publicly charged two innocent people with murder. Will Robert Langdonand Sophie Neveu be seeking accountability from your department? Will this costCaptain Fache his job?\"Lieutenant Collet's smile was tired but calm. \"It is my experience that CaptainBezu Fache seldom makes mistakes. I have not yet spoken to him on this matter,but knowing how he operates, I suspect his public manhunt for Agent Neveu andMr. Langdon was part of a ruse to lure out the real killer.\"The reporters exchanged surprised looks.Collet continued. \"Whether or not Mr. Langdon and Agent Neveu were willingparticipants in the sting, I do not know. Captain Fache tends to keep his morecreative methods to himself. All I can confirm at this point is that the captainhas successfully arrested the man responsible, and that Mr. Langdon and AgentNeveu are both innocent and safe.\"Fache had a faint smile on his lips as he turned back to Aringarosa. \"A goodman, that Collet.\"Several moments passed. Finally, Fache ran his hand over his forehead, slickingback his hair as he gazed down at Aringarosa. \"My Lord, before I return toParis, there is one final matter I'd like to discuss—your impromptu flight toLondon. You bribed a pilot to change course. In doing so, you broke a number ofinternational laws.\"Aringarosa slumped. \"I was desperate.\"\"Yes. As was the pilot when my men interrogated him.\" Fache reached in hispocket and produced a purple amethyst ring with a familiar hand-tooledmitre-crozier appliqué.Aringarosa felt tears welling as he accepted the ring and slipped it back on hisfinger. \"You've been so kind.\" He held out his hand and clasped Fache's. \"Thankyou.\"Fache waved off the gesture, walking to the window and gazing out at the city,his thoughts obviously far away. When he turned, there was an uncertainty abouthim. \"My Lord, where do you go from here?\"Aringarosa had been asked the exact same question as he left Castel Gandolfo thenight before. \"I suspect my path is as uncertain as yours.\"\"Yes.\" Fache paused. \"I suspect I will be retiring early.\"Aringarosa smiled. \"A little faith can do wonders, Captain. A little faith.\" CHAPTER 104Rosslyn Chapel—often called the Cathedral of Codes—stands seven miles south ofEdinburgh, Scotland, on the site of an ancient Mithraic temple. Built by theKnights Templar in 1446, the chapel is engraved with a mind-boggling array ofsymbols from the Jewish, Christian, Egyptian, Masonic, and pagan traditions.The chapel's geographic coordinates fall precisely on the north-south meridianthat runs through Glastonbury. This longitudinal Rose Line is the traditionalmarker of King Arthur's Isle of Avalon and is considered the central pillar ofBritain's sacred geometry. It is from this hallowed Rose Line thatRosslyn—originally spelled Roslin—takes its name.Rosslyn's rugged spires were casting long evening shadows as Robert Langdon andSophie Neveu pulled their rental car into the grassy parking area at the foot ofthe bluff on which the chapel stood. Their short flight from London to Edinburghhad been restful, although neither of them had slept for the anticipation ofwhat lay ahead. Gazing up at the stark edifice framed against a cloud-swept sky,Langdon felt like Alice falling headlong into the rabbit hole. This must be adream. And yet he knew the text of Saunière's final message could not have beenmore specific. The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits. Langdon had fantasized that Saunière's \"Grail map\" would be a diagram—a drawingwith an X-marks-the-spot—and yet the Priory's final secret had been unveiled inthe same way Saunière had spoken to them from the beginning. Simple verse. Fourexplicit lines that pointed without a doubt to this very spot. In addition toidentifying Rosslyn by name, the verse made reference to several of the chapel'srenowned architectural features.Despite the clarity of Saunière's final revelation, Langdon had been leftfeeling more off balance than enlightened. To him, Rosslyn Chapel seemed far tooobvious a location. For centuries, this stone chapel had echoed with whispers ofthe Holy Grail's presence. The whispers had turned to shouts in recent decadeswhen ground-penetrating radar revealed the presence of an astonishing structurebeneath the chapel—a massive subterranean chamber. Not only did this deep vaultdwarf the chapel atop it, but it appeared to have no entrance or exit.Archaeologists petitioned to begin blasting through the bedrock to reach themysterious chamber, but the Rosslyn Trust expressly forbade any excavation ofthe sacred site. Of course, this only fueled the fires of speculation. What wasthe Rosslyn Trust trying to hide?Rosslyn had now become a pilgrimage site for mystery seekers. Some claimed theywere drawn here by the powerful magnetic field that emanated inexplicably fromthese coordinates, some claimed they came to search the hillside for a hiddenentrance to the vault, but most admitted they had come simply to wander thegrounds and absorb the lore of the Holy Grail.Although Langdon had never been to Rosslyn before now, he always chuckled whenhe heard the chapel described as the current home of the Holy Grail. Admittedly,Rosslyn once might have been home to the Grail, long ago... but certainly nolonger. Far too much attention had been drawn to Rosslyn in past decades, andsooner or later someone would find a way to break into the vault.True Grail academics agreed that Rosslyn was a decoy—one of the devious deadends the Priory crafted so convincingly. Tonight, however, with the Priory'skeystone offering a verse that pointed directly to this spot, Langdon no longerfelt so smug. A perplexing question had been running through his mind all day:Why would Saunière go to such effort to guide us to so obvious a location?There seemed only one logical answer.There is something about Rosslyn we have yet to understand.\"Robert?\" Sophie was standing outside the car, looking back at him. \"Are youcorning?\" She was holding the rosewood box, which Captain Fache had returned tothem. Inside, both cryptexes had been reassembled and nested as they had beenfound. The papyrus verse was locked safely at its core—minus the shattered vialof vinegar.Making their way up the long gravel path, Langdon and Sophie passed the famouswest wall of the chapel. Casual visitors assumed this oddly protruding wall wasa section of the chapel that had not been finished. The truth, Langdon recalled,was far more intriguing.The west wall of Solomon's Temple.The Knights Templar had designed Rosslyn Chapel as an exact architecturalblueprint of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem—complete with a west wall, a narrowrectangular sanctuary, and a subterranean vault like the Holy of Holies, inwhich the original nine knights had first unearthed their priceless treasure.Langdon had to admit, there existed an intriguing symmetry in the idea of theTemplars building a modern Grail repository that echoed the Grail's originalhiding place.Rosslyn Chapel's entrance was more modest than Langdon expected. The smallwooden door had two iron hinges and a simple, oak sign.ROSLINThis ancient spelling, Langdon explained to Sophie, derived from the Rose Linemeridian on which the chapel sat; or, as Grail academics preferred to believe,from the \"Line of Rose\"—the ancestral lineage of Mary Magdalene.The chapel would be closing soon, and as Langdon pulled open the door, a warmpuff of air escaped, as if the ancient edifice were heaving a weary sigh at theend of a long day. Her entry arches burgeoned with carved cinquefoils.Roses. The womb of the goddess.Entering with Sophie, Langdon felt his eyes reaching across the famous sanctuaryand taking it all in. Although he had read accounts of Rosslyn's arrestinglyintricate stonework, seeing it in person was an overwhelming encounter.Symbology heaven, one of Langdon's colleagues had called it.Every surface in the chapel had been carved with symbols—Christian cruciforms,Jewish stars, Masonic seals, Templar crosses, cornucopias, pyramids,astrological signs, plants, vegetables, pentacles, and roses. The KnightsTemplar had been master stonemasons, erecting Templar churches all over Europe,but Rosslyn was considered their most sublime labor of love and veneration. Themaster masons had left no stone uncarved. Rosslyn Chapel was a shrine to allfaiths... to all traditions... and, above all, to nature and the goddess.The sanctuary was empty except for a handful of visitors listening to a youngman giving the day's last tour. He was leading them in a single-file line alonga well-known route on the floor—an invisible pathway linking six keyarchitectural points within the sanctuary. Generations of visitors had walkedthese straight lines, connecting the points, and their countless footsteps hadengraved an enormous symbol on the floor.Star of David [danbrown/davincicode-7.gif]The Star of David, Langdon thought. No coincidence there. Also known asSolomon's Seal, this hexagram had once been the secret symbol of the stargazingpriests and was later adopted by the Israelite kings—David and Solomon.The docent had seen Langdon and Sophie enter, and although it was closing time,offered a pleasant smile and motioned for them to feel free to look around.Langdon nodded his thanks and began to move deeper into the sanctuary. Sophie,however, stood riveted in the entryway, a puzzled look on her face.\"What is it?\" Langdon asked.Sophie stared out at the chapel. \"I think... I've been here.\"Langdon was surprised. \"But you said you hadn't even heard of Rosslyn.\"\"I hadn't...\" She scanned the sanctuary, looking uncertain. \"My grandfather musthave brought me here when I was very young. I don't know. It feels familiar.\" Asher eyes scanned the room, she began nodding with more certainty. \"Yes.\" Shepointed to the front of the sanctuary. \"Those two pillars... I've seen them.\"Langdon looked at the pair of intricately sculpted columns at the far end of thesanctuary. Their white lacework carvings seemed to smolder with a ruddy glow asthe last of the day's sunlight streamed in through the west window. Thepillars—positioned where the altar would normally stand—were an oddly matchedpair. The pillar on the left was carved with simple, vertical lines, while thepillar on the right was embellished with an ornate, flowering spiral.Sophie was already moving toward them. Langdon hurried after her, and as theyreached the pillars, Sophie was nodding with incredulity. \"Yes, I'm positive Ihave seen these!\"\"I don't doubt you've seen them,\" Langdon said, \"but it wasn't necessarilyhere.\"She turned. \"What do you mean?\"\"These two pillars are the most duplicated architectural structures in history.Replicas exist all over the world.\"\"Replicas of Rosslyn?\" She looked skeptical.\"No. Of the pillars. Do you remember earlier that I mentioned Rosslyn itself isa copy of Solomon's Temple? Those two pillars are exact replicas of the twopillars that stood at the head of Solomon's Temple.\" Langdon pointed to thepillar on the left. \"That's called Boaz—or the Mason's Pillar. The other iscalled Jachin—or the Apprentice Pillar.\" He paused. \"In fact, virtually everyMasonic temple in the world has two pillars like these.\"Langdon had already explained to her about the Templars' powerful historic tiesto the modern Masonic secret societies, whose primary degrees—ApprenticeFreemason, Fellowcraft Freemason, and Master Mason—harked back to early Templardays. Sophie's grandfather's final verse made direct reference to the MasterMasons who adorned Rosslyn with their carved artistic offerings. It also notedRosslyn's central ceiling, which was covered with carvings of stars and planets.\"I've never been in a Masonic temple,\" Sophie said, still eyeing the pillars. \"Iam almost positive I saw these here.\" She turned back into the chapel, as iflooking for something else to jog her memory.The rest of the visitors were now leaving, and the young docent made his wayacross the chapel to them with a pleasant smile. He was a handsome young man inhis late twenties, with a Scottish brogue and strawberry blond hair. \"I'm aboutto close up for the day. May I help you find anything?\"How about the Holy Grail? Langdon wanted to say.\"The code,\" Sophie blurted, in sudden revelation. \"There's a code here!\"The docent looked pleased by her enthusiasm. \"Yes there is, ma'am.\"\"It's on the ceiling,\" she said, turning to the right-hand wall. \"Somewhereover... there.\"He smiled. \"Not your first visit to Rosslyn, I see.\"The code, Langdon thought. He had forgotten that little bit of lore. AmongRosslyn's numerous mysteries was a vaulted archway from which hundreds of stoneblocks protruded, jutting down to form a bizarre multifaceted surface. Eachblock was carved with a symbol, seemingly at random, creating a cipher ofunfathomable proportion. Some people believed the code revealed the entrance tothe vault beneath the chapel.Others believed it told the true Grail legend. Not that itmattered—cryptographers had been trying for centuries to decipher its meaning.To this day the Rosslyn Trust offered a generous reward to anyone who couldunveil the secret meaning, but the code remained a mystery. \"I'd be happy toshow...\" The docent's voice trailed off.My first code, Sophie thought, moving alone, in a trance, toward the encodedarchway. Having handed the rosewood box to Langdon, she could feel herselfmomentarily forgetting all about the Holy Grail, the Priory of Sion, and all themysteries of the past day. When she arrived beneath the encoded ceiling and sawthe symbols above her, the memories came flooding back. She was recalling herfirst visit here, and strangely, the memories conjured an unexpected sadness.She was a little girl... a year or so after her family's death. Her grandfatherhad brought her to Scotland on a short vacation. They had come to see RosslynChapel before going back to Paris. It was late evening, and the chapel wasclosed. But they were still inside.\"Can we go home, Grand-père?\" Sophie begged, feeling tired.\"Soon, dear, very soon.\" His voice was melancholy. \"I have one last thing I needto do here. How about if you wait in the car?\"\"You're doing another big person thing?\"He nodded. \"I'll be fast. I promise.\"\"Can I do the archway code again? That was fun.\"\"I don't know. I have to step outside. You won't be frightened in here alone?\"\"Of course not!\" she said with a huff. \"It's not even dark yet!\"He smiled. \"Very well then.\" He led her over to the elaborate archway he hadshown her earlier.Sophie immediately plopped down on the stone floor, lying on her back andstaring up at the collage of puzzle pieces overhead. \"I'm going to break thiscode before you get back!\"\"It's a race then.\" He bent over, kissed her forehead, and walked to the nearbyside door. \"I'll be right outside. I'll leave the door open. If you need me,just call.\" He exited into the soft evening light.Sophie lay there on the floor, gazing up at the code. Her eyes felt sleepy.After a few minutes, the symbols got fuzzy. And then they disappeared.When Sophie awoke, the floor felt cold.\"Grand-père?\"There was no answer. Standing up, she brushed herself off. The side door wasstill open. The evening was getting darker. She walked outside and could see hergrandfather standing on the porch of a nearby stone house directly behind thechurch. Her grandfather was talking quietly to a person barely visible insidethe screened door.\"Grand-père?\" she called.Her grandfather turned and waved, motioning for her to wait just a moment. Then,slowly, he said some final words to the person inside and blew a kiss toward thescreened door. He came to her with tearful eyes.\"Why are you crying, Grand-père?\"He picked her up and held her close. \"Oh, Sophie, you and I have said good-byeto a lot of people this year. It's hard.\"Sophie thought of the accident, of saying good-bye to her mother and father, hergrandmother and baby brother. \"Were you saying goodbye to another person?\"\"To a dear friend whom I love very much,\" he replied, his voice heavy withemotion. \"And I fear I will not see her again for a very long time.\" Standing with the docent, Langdon had been scanning the chapel walls and feelinga rising wariness that a dead end might be looming. Sophie had wandered off tolook at the code and left Langdon holding the rosewood box, which contained aGrail map that now appeared to be no help at all. Although Saunière's poemclearly indicated Rosslyn, Langdon was not sure what to do now that they hadarrived. The poem made reference to a \"blade and chalice,\" which Langdon sawnowhere. The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits.The blade and chalice guarding o'er Her gates. Again Langdon sensed there remained some facet of this mystery yet to revealitself.\"I hate to pry,\" the docent said, eyeing the rosewood box in Langdon's hands.\"But this box... might I ask where you got it?\"Langdon gave a weary laugh. \"That's an exceptionally long story.\"The young man hesitated, his eyes on the box again. \"It's the strangest thing—mygrandmother has a box exactly like that—a jewelry box. Identical polishedrosewood, same inlaid rose, even the hinges look the same.\"Langdon knew the young man must be mistaken. If ever a box had been one of akind, it was this one—the box custom-made for the Priory keystone. \"The twoboxes may be similar but—\"The side door closed loudly, drawing both of their gazes. Sophie had exitedwithout a word and was now wandering down the bluff toward a fieldstone housenearby. Langdon stared after her. Where is she going? She had been actingstrangely ever since they entered the building. He turned to the docent. \"Do youknow what that house is?\"He nodded, also looking puzzled that Sophie was going down there. \"That's thechapel rectory. The chapel curator lives there. She also happens to be the headof the Rosslyn Trust.\" He paused. \"And my grandmother.\"\"Your grandmother heads the Rosslyn Trust?\"The young man nodded. \"I live with her in the rectory and help keep up thechapel and give tours.\" He shrugged. \"I've lived here my whole life. Mygrandmother raised me in that house.\"Concerned for Sophie, Langdon moved across the chapel toward the door to callout to her. He was only halfway there when he stopped short. Something the youngman said just registered.My grandmother raised me.Langdon looked out at Sophie on the bluff, then down at the rosewood box in hishand. Impossible. Slowly, Langdon turned back to the young man. \"You said yourgrandmother has a box like this one?\"\"Almost identical.\"\"Where did she get it?\"\"My grandfather made it for her. He died when I was a baby, but my grandmotherstill talks about him. She says he was a genius with his hands. He made allkinds of things.\"Langdon glimpsed an unimaginable web of connections emerging. \"You said yourgrandmother raised you. Do you mind my asking what happened to your parents?\"The young man looked surprised. \"They died when I was young.\" He paused. \"Thesame day as my grandfather.\"Langdon's heart pounded. \"In a car accident?\"The docent recoiled, a look of bewilderment in his olive-green eyes. \"Yes. In acar accident. My entire family died that day. I lost my grandfather, my parents,and...\" He hesitated, glancing down at the floor. \"And your sister,\" Langdonsaid. Out on the bluff, the fieldstone house was exactly as Sophie remembered it.Night was falling now, and the house exuded a warm and inviting aura. The smellof bread wafted through the opened screened door, and a golden light shone inthe windows. As Sophie approached, she could hear the quiet sounds of sobbingfrom within.Through the screened door, Sophie saw an elderly woman in the hallway. Her backwas to the door, but Sophie could see she was crying. The woman had long,luxuriant, silver hair that conjured an unexpected wisp of memory. Feelingherself drawn closer, Sophie stepped onto the porch stairs. The woman wasclutching a framed photograph of a man and touching her fingertips to his facewith loving sadness.It was a face Sophie knew well.Grand-père.The woman had obviously heard the sad news of his death last night.A board squeaked beneath Sophie's feet, and the woman turned slowly, her sadeyes finding Sophie's. Sophie wanted to run, but she stood transfixed. Thewoman's fervent gaze never wavered as she set down the photo and approached thescreened door. An eternity seemed to pass as the two women stared at one anotherthrough the thin mesh. Then, like the slowly gathering swell of an ocean wave,the woman's visage transformed from one of uncertainty... to disbelief... tohope... and finally, to cresting joy.Throwing open the door, she came out, reaching with soft hands, cradlingSophie's thunderstruck face. \"Oh, dear child... look at you!\"Although Sophie did not recognize her, she knew who this woman was. She tried tospeak but found she could not even breathe.\"Sophie,\" the woman sobbed, kissing her forehead.Sophie's words were a choked whisper. \"But... Grand-père said you were...\"\"I know.\" The woman placed her tender hands on Sophie's shoulders and gazed ather with familiar eyes. \"Your grandfather and I were forced to say so manythings. We did what we thought was right. I'm so sorry. It was for your ownsafety, princess.\"Sophie heard her final word, and immediately thought of her grandfather, who hadcalled her princess for so many years. The sound of his voice seemed to echo nowin the ancient stones of Rosslyn, settling through the earth and reverberatingin the unknown hollows below.The woman threw her arms around Sophie, the tears flowing faster. \"Yourgrandfather wanted so badly to tell you everything. But things were difficultbetween you two. He tried so hard. There's so much to explain. So very much toexplain.\" She kissed Sophie's forehead once again, then whispered in her ear.\"No more secrets, princess. It's time you learn the truth about our family.\" Sophie and her grandmother were seated on the porch stairs in a tearful hug whenthe young docent dashed across the lawn, his eyes shining with hope anddisbelief.\"Sophie?\"Through her tears, Sophie nodded, standing. She did not know the young man'sface, but as they embraced, she could feel the power of the blood coursingthrough his veins... the blood she now understood they shared. When Langdon walked across the lawn to join them, Sophie could not imagine thatonly yesterday she had felt so alone in the world. And now, somehow, in thisforeign place, in the company of three people she barely knew, she felt at lastthat she was home. CHAPTER 105Night had fallen over Rosslyn.Robert Langdon stood alone on the porch of the fieldstone house enjoying thesounds of laughter and reunion drifting through the screened door behind him.The mug of potent Brazilian coffee in his hand had granted him a hazy reprievefrom his mounting exhaustion, and yet he sensed the reprieve would be fleeting.The fatigue in his body went to the core.\"You slipped out quietly,\" a voice behind him said.He turned. Sophie's grandmother emerged, her silver hair shimmering in thenight. Her name, for the last twenty-eight years at least, was Marie Chauvel.Langdon gave a tired smile. \"I thought I'd give your family some time together.\"Through the window, he could see Sophie talking with her brother.Marie came over and stood beside him. \"Mr. Langdon, when I first heard ofJacques's murder, I was terrified for Sophie's safety. Seeing her standing in mydoorway tonight was the greatest relief of my life. I cannot thank you enough.\"Langdon had no idea how to respond. Although he had offered to give Sophie andher grandmother time to talk in private, Marie had asked him to stay and listen.My husband obviously trusted you, Mr. Langdon, so I do as well.And so Langdon had remained, standing beside Sophie and listening in muteastonishment while Marie told the story of Sophie's late parents. Incredibly,both had been from Merovingian families—direct descendants of Mary Magdalene andJesus Christ. Sophie's parents and ancestors, for protection, had changed theirfamily names of Plantard and Saint-Clair. Their children represented the mostdirect surviving royal bloodline and therefore were carefully guarded by thePriory. When Sophie's parents were killed in a car accident whose cause couldnot be determined, the Priory feared the identity of the royal line had beendiscovered.\"Your grandfather and I,\" Marie had explained in a voice choked with pain, \"hadto make a grave decision the instant we received the phone call. Your parents'car had just been found in the river.\" She dabbed at the tears in her eyes. \"Allsix of us—including you two grandchildren—were supposed to be traveling togetherin that car that very night. Fortunately we changed our plans at the lastmoment, and your parents were alone. Hearing of the accident, Jacques and I hadno way to know what had really happened... or if this was truly an accident.\"Marie looked at Sophie. \"We knew we had to protect our grandchildren, and we didwhat we thought was best. Jacques reported to the police that your brother and Ihad been in the car... our two bodies apparently washed off in the current. Thenyour brother and I went underground with the Priory. Jacques, being a man ofprominence, did not have the luxury of disappearing. It only made sense thatSophie, being the eldest, would stay in Paris to be taught and raised byJacques, close to the heart and protection of the Priory.\" Her voice fell to awhisper. \"Separating the family was the hardest thing we ever had to do. Jacquesand I saw each other only very infrequently, and always in the most secret ofsettings... under the protection of the Priory. There are certain ceremonies towhich the brotherhood always stays faithful.\"Langdon had sensed the story went far deeper, but he also sensed it was not forhim to hear. So he had stepped outside. Now, gazing up at the spires of Rosslyn,Langdon could not escape the hollow gnaw of Rosslyn's unsolved mystery. Is theGrail really here at Rosslyn? And if so, where are the blade and chalice thatSaunière mentioned in his poem?\"I'll take that,\" Marie said, motioning to Langdon's hand.\"Oh, thank you.\" Langdon held out his empty coffee cup.She stared at him. \"I was referring to your other hand, Mr. Langdon.\"Langdon looked down and realized he was holding Saunière's papyrus. He had takenit from the cryptex once again in hopes of seeing something he had missedearlier. \"Of course, I'm sorry.\"Marie looked amused as she took the paper. \"I know of a man at a bank in Pariswho is probably very eager to see the return of this rosewood box. André Vernetwas a dear friend of Jacques, and Jacques trusted him explicitly. André wouldhave done anything to honor Jacques's requests for the care of this box.\"Including shooting me, Langdon recalled, deciding not to mention that he hadprobably broken the poor man's nose. Thinking of Paris, Langdon flashed on thethree sénéchaux who had been killed the night before. \"And the Priory? Whathappens now?\"\"The wheels are already in motion, Mr. Langdon. The brotherhood has endured forcenturies, and it will endure this. There are always those waiting to move upand rebuild.\"All evening Langdon had suspected that Sophie's grandmother was closely tied tothe operations of the Priory. After all, the Priory had always had womenmembers. Four Grand Masters had been women. The sénéchaux were traditionallymen—the guardians—and yet women held far more honored status within the Prioryand could ascend to the highest post from virtually any rank.Langdon thought of Leigh Teabing and Westminster Abbey. It seemed a lifetimeago. \"Was the Church pressuring your husband not to release the Sangrealdocuments at the End of Days?\"\"Heavens no. The End of Days is a legend of paranoid minds. There is nothing inthe Priory doctrine that identifies a date at which the Grail should beunveiled. In fact the Priory has always maintained that the Grail should neverbe unveiled.\"\"Never?\" Langdon was stunned.\"It is the mystery and wonderment that serve our souls, not the Grail itself.The beauty of the Grail lies in her ethereal nature.\" Marie Chauvel gazed up atRosslyn now. \"For some, the Grail is a chalice that will bring them everlastinglife. For others, it is the quest for lost documents and secret history. And formost, I suspect the Holy Grail is simply a grand idea... a glorious unattainabletreasure that somehow, even in today's world of chaos, inspires us.\"\"But if the Sangreal documents remain hidden, the story of Mary Magdalene willbe lost forever,\" Langdon said.\"Will it? Look around you. Her story is being told in art, music, and books.More so every day. The pendulum is swinging. We are starting to sense thedangers of our history... and of our destructive paths. We are beginning tosense the need to restore the sacred feminine.\" She paused. \"You mentioned youare writing a manuscript about the symbols of the sacred feminine, are you not?\"\"I am.\"She smiled. \"Finish it, Mr. Langdon. Sing her song. The world needs moderntroubadours.\"Langdon fell silent, feeling the weight of her message upon him. Across the openspaces, a new moon was rising above the tree line.Turning his eyes toward Rosslyn, Langdon felt a boyish craving to know hersecrets. Don't ask, he told himself. This is not the moment. He glanced at thepapyrus in Marie's hand, and then back at Rosslyn.\"Ask the question, Mr. Langdon,\" Marie said, looking amused. \"You have earnedthe right.\"Langdon felt himself flush.\"You want to know if the Grail is here at Rosslyn.\"\"Can you tell me?\"She sighed in mock exasperation. \"Why is it that men simply cannot let the Grailrest?\" She laughed, obviously enjoying herself. \"Why do you think it's here?\"Langdon motioned to the papyrus in her hand. \"Your husband's poem speaksspecifically of Rosslyn, except it also mentions a blade and chalice watchingover the Grail. I didn't see any symbols of the blade and chalice up there.\"\"The blade and chalice?\" Marie asked. \"What exactly do they look like?\"Langdon sensed she was toying with him, but he played along, quickly describingthe symbols.A look of vague recollection crossed her face. \"Ah, yes, of course. The bladerepresents all that is masculine. I believe it is drawn like this, no?\" Usingher index finger, she traced a shape on her palm.triangle [danbrown/davincicode-8.gif]\"Yes,\" Langdon said. Marie had drawn the less common \"closed\" form of the blade,although Langdon had seen the symbol portrayed both ways.\"And the inverse,\" she said, drawing again on her palm, \"is the chalice, whichrepresents the feminine.\"reverse triangle [danbrown/davincicode-9.gif]\"Correct,\" Langdon said.\"And you are saying that in all the hundreds of symbols we have here in RosslynChapel, these two shapes appear nowhere?\"\"I didn't see them.\"\"And if I show them to you, will you get some sleep?\"Before Langdon could answer, Marie Chauvel had stepped off the porch and washeading toward the chapel. Langdon hurried after her. Entering the ancientbuilding, Marie turned on the lights and pointed to the center of the sanctuaryfloor. \"There you are, Mr. Langdon. The blade and chalice.\"Langdon stared at the scuffed stone floor. It was blank. \"There's nothinghere....\"Marie sighed and began to walk along the famous path worn into the chapel floor,the same path Langdon had seen the visitors walking earlier this evening. As hiseyes adjusted to see the giant symbol, he still felt lost. \"But that's the Starof Dav—\"Langdon stopped short, mute with amazement as it dawned on him.Star of David [danbrown/davincicode-7.gif]The blade and chalice.Fused as one.The Star of David... the perfect union of male and female... Solomon's Seal...marking the Holy of Holies, where the male and female deities—Yahweh andShekinah—were thought to dwell.Langdon needed a minute to find his words. \"The verse does point here toRosslyn. Completely. Perfectly.\"Marie smiled. \"Apparently.\"The implications chilled him. \"So the Holy Grail is in the vault beneath us?\"She laughed. \"Only in spirit. One of the Priory's most ancient charges was oneday to return the Grail to her homeland of France where she could rest foreternity. For centuries, she was dragged across the countryside to keep hersafe. Most undignified. Jacques's charge when he became Grand Master was torestore her honor by returning her to France and building her a resting placefit for a queen.\"\"And he succeeded?\"Now her face grew serious. \"Mr. Langdon, considering what you've done for metonight, and as curator of the Rosslyn Trust, I can tell you for certain thatthe Grail is no longer here.\"Langdon decided to press. \"But the keystone is supposed to point to the placewhere the Holy Grail is hidden now. Why does it point to Rosslyn?\"\"Maybe you're misreading its meaning. Remember, the Grail can be deceptive. Ascould my late husband.\"\"But how much clearer could he be?\" he asked. \"We are standing over anunderground vault marked by the blade and chalice, underneath a ceiling ofstars, surrounded by the art of Master Masons. Everything speaks of Rosslyn.\"\"Very well, let me see this mysterious verse.\" She unrolled the papyrus and readthe poem aloud in a deliberate tone. The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits.The blade and chalice guarding o'er Her gates.Adorned in masters' loving art, She lies.She rests at last beneath the starry skies. When she finished, she was still for several seconds, until a knowing smilecrossed her lips. \"Aah, Jacques.\"Langdon watched her expectantly. \"You understand this?\"\"As you have witnessed on the chapel floor, Mr. Langdon, there are many ways tosee simple things.\"Langdon strained to understand. Everything about Jacques Saunière seemed to havedouble meanings, and yet Langdon could see no further.Marie gave a tired yawn. \"Mr. Langdon, I will make a confession to you. I havenever officially been privy to the present location of the Grail. But, ofcourse, I was married to a person of enormous influence... and my women'sintuition is strong.\" Langdon started to speak but Marie continued. \"I am sorrythat after all your hard work, you will be leaving Rosslyn without any realanswers. And yet, something tells me you will eventually find what you seek. Oneday it will dawn on you.\" She smiled. \"And when it does, I trust that you, ofall people, can keep a secret.\"There was a sound of someone arriving in the doorway. \"Both of you disappeared,\"Sophie said, entering.\"I was just leaving,\" her grandmother replied, walking over to Sophie at thedoor. \"Good night, princess.\" She kissed Sophie's forehead. \"Don't keep Mr.Langdon out too late.\"Langdon and Sophie watched her grandmother walk back toward the fieldstonehouse. When Sophie turned to him, her eyes were awash in deep emotion. \"Notexactly the ending I expected.\"That makes two of us, he thought. Langdon could see she was overwhelmed. Thenews she had received tonight had changed everything in her life. \"Are you okay?It's a lot to take in.\"She smiled quietly. \"I have a family. That's where I'm going to start. Who weare and where we came from will take some time.\"Langdon remained silent.\"Beyond tonight, will you stay with us?\" Sophie asked. \"At least for a fewdays?\"Langdon sighed, wanting nothing more. \"You need some time here with your family,Sophie. I'm going back to Paris in the morning.\"She looked disappointed but seemed to know it was the right thing to do. Neitherof them spoke for a long time. Finally Sophie reached over and, taking his hand,led him out of the chapel. They walked to a small rise on the bluff. From here,the Scottish countryside spread out before them, suffused in a pale moonlightthat sifted through the departing clouds. They stood in silence, holding hands,both of them fighting the descending shroud of exhaustion.The stars were just now appearing, but to the east, a single point of lightglowed brighter than any other. Langdon smiled when he saw it. It was Venus. Theancient Goddess shining down with her steady and patient light.The night was growing cooler, a crisp breeze rolling up from the lowlands. Aftera while, Langdon looked over at Sophie. Her eyes were closed, her lips relaxedin a contented smile. Langdon could feel his own eyes growing heavy.Reluctantly, he squeezed her hand. \"Sophie?\"Slowly, she opened her eyes and turned to him. Her face was beautiful in themoonlight. She gave him a sleepy smile. \"Hi.\"Langdon felt an unexpected sadness to realize he would be returning to Pariswithout her. \"I may be gone before you wake up.\" He paused, a knot growing inhis throat. \"I'm sorry, I'm not very good at—\"Sophie reached out and placed her soft hand on the side of his face. Then,leaning forward, she kissed him tenderly on the cheek. \"When can I see youagain?\"Langdon reeled momentarily, lost in her eyes. \"When?\" He paused, curious if shehad any idea how much he had been wondering the same thing. \"Well, actually,next month I'm lecturing at a conference in Florence. I'll be there a weekwithout much to do.\"\"Is that an invitation?\"\"We'd be living in luxury. They're giving me a room at the Brunelleschi.\"Sophie smiled playfully. \"You presume a lot, Mr. Langdon.\"He cringed at how it had sounded. \"What I meant—\"\"I would love nothing more than to meet you in Florence, Robert. But on onecondition.\" Her tone turned serious. \"No museums, no churches, no tombs, no art,no relics.\"\"In Florence? For a week? There's nothing else to do.\"Sophie leaned forward and kissed him again, now on the lips. Their bodies cametogether, softly at first, and then completely. When she pulled away, her eyeswere full of promise.\"Right,\" Langdon managed. \"It's a date.\" EPILOGUERobert Langdon awoke with a start. He had been dreaming. The bathrobe beside hisbed bore the monogram HOTEL RITZ PARIS. He saw a dim light filtering through theblinds. Is it dusk or dawn? he wondered.Langdon's body felt warm and deeply contented. He had slept the better part ofthe last two days. Sitting up slowly in bed, he now realized what had awokenhim... the strangest thought. For days he had been trying to sort through abarrage of information, but now Langdon found himself fixed on something he'dnot considered before.Could it be?He remained motionless a long moment.Getting out of bed, he walked to the marble shower. Stepping inside, he let thepowerful jets message his shoulders. Still, the thought enthralled him.Impossible.Twenty minutes later, Langdon stepped out of the Hotel Ritz into Place Vendôme.Night was falling. The days of sleep had left him disoriented... and yet hismind felt oddly lucid. He had promised himself he would stop in the hotel lobbyfor a cafe au lait to clear his thoughts, but instead his legs carried himdirectly out the front door into the gathering Paris night.Walking east on Rue des Petits Champs, Langdon felt a growing excitement. Heturned south onto Rue Richelieu, where the air grew sweet with the scent ofblossoming jasmine from the stately gardens of the Palais Royal.He continued south until he saw what he was looking for—the famous royalarcade—a glistening expanse of polished black marble. Moving onto it, Langdonscanned the surface beneath his feet. Within seconds, he found what he knew wasthere—several bronze medallions embedded in the ground in a perfectly straightline. Each disk was five inches in diameter and embossed with the letters N andS.Nord. Sud.He turned due south, letting his eye trace the extended line formed by themedallions. He began moving again, following the trail, watching the pavement ashe walked. As he cut across the corner of the Comédie-Française, another bronzemedallion passed beneath his feet. Yes!The streets of Paris, Langdon had learned years ago, were adorned with 135 ofthese bronze markers, embedded in sidewalks, courtyards, and streets, on anorth-south axis across the city. He had once followed the line fromSacré-Coeur, north across the Seine, and finally to the ancient ParisObservatory. There he discovered the significance of the sacred path it traced.The earth's original prime meridian.The first zero longitude of the world.Paris's ancient Rose Line.Now, as Langdon hurried across Rue de Rivoli, he could feel his destinationwithin reach. Less than a block away. The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits. The revelations were coming now in waves. Saunière's ancient spelling ofRoslin... the blade and chalice... the tomb adorned with masters' art.Is that why Saunière needed to talk with me? Had I unknowingly guessed thetruth?He broke into a jog, feeling the Rose Line beneath his feet, guiding him,pulling him toward his destination. As he entered the long tunnel of PassageRichelieu, the hairs on his neck began to bristle with anticipation. He knewthat at the end of this tunnel stood the most mysterious of Parisianmonuments—conceived and commissioned in the 1980s by the Sphinx himself,François Mitterrand, a man rumored to move in secret circles, a man whose finallegacy to Paris was a place Langdon had visited only days before.Another lifetime.With a final surge of energy, Langdon burst from the passageway into thefamiliar courtyard and came to a stop. Breathless, he raised his eyes, slowly,disbelieving, to the glistening structure in front of him.The Louvre Pyramid.Gleaming in the darkness.He admired it only a moment. He was more interested in what lay to his right.Turning, he felt his feet again tracing the invisible path of the ancient RoseLine, carrying him across the courtyard to the Carrousel du Louvre—the enormouscircle of grass surrounded by a perimeter of neatly trimmed hedges—once the siteof Paris's primeval nature-worshipping festivals... joyous rites to celebratefertility and the Goddess.Langdon felt as if he were crossing into another world as he stepped over thebushes to the grassy area within. This hallowed ground was now marked by one ofthe city's most unusual monuments. There in the center, plunging into the earthlike a crystal chasm, gaped the giant inverted pyramid of glass that he had seena few nights ago when he entered the Louvre's subterranean entresol.La Pyramide Inversée.Tremulous, Langdon walked to the edge and peered down into the Louvre'ssprawling underground complex, aglow with amber light. His eye was trained notjust on the massive inverted pyramid, but on what lay directly beneath it.There, on the floor of the chamber below, stood the tiniest of structures... astructure Langdon had mentioned in his manuscript.Langdon felt himself awaken fully now to the thrill of unthinkable possibility.Raising his eyes again to the Louvre, he sensed the huge wings of the museumenveloping him... hallways that burgeoned with the world's finest art.Da Vinci... Botticelli... Adorned in masters' loving art, She lies. Alive with wonder, he stared once again downward through the glass at the tinystructure below.I must go down there!Stepping out of the circle, he hurried across the courtyard back toward thetowering pyramid entrance of the Louvre. The day's last visitors were tricklingout of the museum.Pushing through the revolving door, Langdon descended the curved staircase intothe pyramid. He could feel the air grow cooler. When he reached the bottom, heentered the long tunnel that stretched beneath the Louvre's courtyard, backtoward La Pyramide Inversée.At the end of the tunnel, he emerged into a large chamber. Directly before him,hanging down from above, gleamed the inverted pyramid—a breathtaking V-shapedcontour of glass.The Chalice.Langdon's eyes traced its narrowing form downward to its tip, suspended only sixfeet above the floor. There, directly beneath it, stood the tiny structure.A miniature pyramid. Only three feet tall. The only structure in this colossalcomplex that had been built on a small scale.Langdon's manuscript, while discussing the Louvre's elaborate collection ofgoddess art, had made passing note of this modest pyramid. \"The miniaturestructure itself protrudes up through the floor as though it were the tip of aniceberg—the apex, of an enormous, pyramidical vault, submerged below like ahidden chamber.\"Illuminated in the soft lights of the deserted entresol, the two pyramidspointed at one another, their bodies perfectly aligned, their tips almosttouching.The Chalice above. The Blade below. The blade and chalice guarding o'er Her gates. Langdon heard Marie Chauvel's words. One day it will dawn on you.He was standing beneath the ancient Rose Line, surrounded by the work ofmasters. What better place for Saunière to keep watch? Now at last, he sensed heunderstood the true meaning of the Grand Master's verse. Raising his eyes toheaven, he gazed upward through the glass to a glorious, star-filled night. She rests at last beneath the starry skies. Like the murmurs of spirits in the darkness, forgotten words echoed. The questfor the Holy Grail is the quest to kneel before the bones of Mary Magdalene. Ajourney to pray at the feet of the outcast one.With a sudden upwelling of reverence, Robert Langdon fell to his knees.For a moment, he thought he heard a woman's voice... the wisdom of the ages...whispering up from the chasms of the earth.
