Since the beginning of time, the secret had always been how to die. The thirty-four-year-old initiate gazed down at the human skull cradled in his palms. The skull was ho llow, like a bowl, filled with bloodred wine. Drink it, he told himself. You have nothing to fear. As was tradition, he had begun this journey adorned in the ritualistic garb of a medieval heretic bein g led to the gallows, his loose-fitting shirt gaping open to reveal his pale chest, his left pant leg rolled up to the knee, and his right sleeve rolled up to the elbow. Around his neck hung a heavy rope noose—a “cable-tow” as the brethren called it. Tonight, however, like the bret hren bearing witness, he was dressed as a master. The assembly of brothers encircling him all were ad orned in their full regalia of lambskin aprons, sas hes, and white gloves. Around their necks hung ceremonial je wels that glistened like ghostly eyes in the muted light. Many of these men held powerful stations in life, a nd yet the initiate knew their worldly ranks meant nothing within these walls. Here all men were equals, sworn brothers sharing a mystical bond. As he surveyed the daunting assembly, the initiate wondered who on the outside would ever believe that this collection of men would assemble in one place . . . much less this place. The room looked like a holy sanctuary from the ancient world. The truth, however, was stranger still. I am just blocks away from the White House. This colossal edifice, located at 1733 Sixteenth St reet NW in Washington, D.C., was a replica of a pre - Christian temple—the temple of King Mausolus, the o riginal mausoleum . . . a place to be taken after death. Outside the main entrance, two seventeen-ton sphinx es guarded the bronze doors. The interior was an or nate labyrinth of ritualistic chambers, halls, sealed va ults, libraries, and even a hollow wall that held t he remains of two human bodies. The initiate had been told eve ry room in this building held a secret, and yet he knew no room held deeper secrets than the gigantic chamber in which he was currently kneeling with a skull cra dled in his palms. The Temple Room. This room was a perfect square. And cavernous. The ceiling soared an astonishing one hundred feet overhead, supported by monolithic columns of green granite. A tiered gallery of dark Russian walnut se ats with hand - tooled pigskin encircled the room. A thirty - three - foot - tall throne dominated the western wall, with"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"a concealed pipe organ opposite it. The walls were a kaleidoscope of ancient symbols . . . Egyptian, H ebraic, astronomical, alchemical, and others yet unknown. Tonight, the Temple Room was lit by a series of pre cisely arranged candles. Their dim glow was aided o nly by a pale shaft of moonlight that filtered down thr ough the expansive oculus in the ceiling and illumi nated the room's most startling feature—an enormous altar hewn from a solid block of polished Belgian black marble, situated dead center of the square chamber. The secret is how to die, the initiate reminded himself. “It is time,” a voice whispered. The initiate let his gaze climb the distinguished w hite-robed figure standing before him. The Supreme Worshipful Master. The man, in his late fifties, was an American icon , well loved, robust, and incalculably wealthy. His once-dark hair was turning silver, and his famous visage reflected a lifetime of power an d a vigorous intellect. “Take the oath,” the Worshipful Master said, his vo ice soft like falling snow. “Complete your journey. ” The initiate's journey, like all such journeys, had begun at the first degree. On that night, in a rit ual similar to this one, the Worshipful Master had blindfolded him with a velvet hoodwink and pressed a ceremonial dagger to his bare chest, demanding: “ Do you seriously declare on your honor, uninfluence d by mercenary or any other unworthy motive, that you freely and volu ntarily offer yourself as a candidate for the myste ries and privileges of this brotherhood?” “I do,” the initiate had lied. “Then let this be a sting to your consciousness,” t he master had warned him, “as well as instant death should you ever betray the secrets to be imparted to you.” At the time, the initiate had felt no fear. They will never know my true purpose here. Tonight, however, he sensed a foreboding solemnity in the Temple Room, and his mind began replaying al l the dire warnings he had been given on his journey, threats of terrible consequences if he ever shared the ancient secrets he was about to learn: Throat cut from ear to ear . . . tongue torn out by its roots . . . bowels taken out and burned . . . scattered to the four wi nds of heaven . . . heart plucked out and given to the beasts of the field— “Brother,” the gray-eyed master said, placing his l eft hand on the initiate's shoulder. “Take the fina l oath.” Steeling himself for the last step of his journey, the initiate shifted his muscular frame and turned his attention back to the skull cradled in his palms. T he crimson wine looked almost black in the dim cand lelight. The chamber had fallen deathly silent, and he could feel all of the witnesses watching him, waiting fo r him to take his final oath and join their elite ranks. Tonight, he thought, something is taking place within these walls that h as never before occurred in the history of this brotherhood. Not once, in centuries . He knew it would be the spark . . . and it would gi ve him unfathomable power. Energized, he drew a bre ath and spoke aloud the same words that countless men h ad spoken before him in countries all over the worl d. “ May this wine I now drink become a deadly poison to me . . . should I ever knowingly or willfully viol ate my oath.” His words echoed in the hollow space. Then all was quiet. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Steadying his hands, the initiate raised the skull to his mouth and felt his lips touch the dry bone. He closed his eyes and tipped the skull toward his mouth, dri nking the wine in long, deep swallows. When the las t drop was gone, he lowered the skull. For an instant, he thought he felt his lungs growin g tight, and his heart began to pound wildly. My God, they know! Then, as quickly as it came, the feeling passed. A pleasant warmth began to stream through his body. The initiate exhaled, smiling inwardly as he gazed up at the unsuspecting gray-eyed man who had foolishly admitted him into this brotherhood's most secretiv e ranks. Soon you will lose everything you hold most dear. CHAPTER 1 The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel T ower was overflowing with tourists. Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed s uit gazed down at the boy beside him. “You look pal e, son. You should have stayed on the ground.” “I’m okay . . .” the boy answered, struggling to co ntrol his anxiety. “I’ll get out on the next level. ” I can’t breathe. The man leaned closer. “I thought by now you would have gotten over this.” He brushed the child’s chee k affectionately. The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear through the ringing in his ear s. I can’ t breathe. I’ve got to get out of this box! The elevator operator was saying something reassuri ng about the lift’s articulated pistons and puddled -iron construction. Far beneath them, the streets of Pari s stretched out in all directions. Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at the unloading platform. Just hold on. As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began to narrow, its massive strut s contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel. “Dad, I don’t think—” Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carr iage jerked, swaying awkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage, thrashin g like snakes. The boy reached out for his father. “Dad!” Their eyes locked for one terrifying second. Then the bottom dropped out. Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather s eat, startling out of the semiconscious daydream. H e was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. In the background, the dual Pratt & Whi tney engines hummed evenly. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"“ Mr. Langdon? ” The intercom crackled overhead. “ We ’ re on final approach. ” Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag. He’d been halfway thr ough reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drift ed. The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by this morning’s unexp ected invitation from Langdon’s longtime mentor, Pe ter Solomon. The other man I never want to disappoint. The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had taken Langdon under his wing nea rly thirty years ago, in many ways filling the void lef t by Langdon’s father’s death. Despite the man’s in fluential family dynasty and massive wealth, Langdon had foun d humility and warmth in Solomon’s soft gray eyes. Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon cou ld still make out the slender silhouette of the wor ld’s largest obelisk, rising on the horizon like the spi re of an ancient gnomon. The 555-foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation’s heart. All around the spire, t he meticulous geometry of streets and monuments rad iated outward. Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almo st mystical power. Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched dow n, he felt a rising excitement about what lay ahead . The jet taxied to a private terminal somewhere in the v ast expanse of Dulles International Airport and cam e to a stop. Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, an d stepped out of the jet’s luxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. The cold January air felt libera ting. Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces. A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation he was stepping into a m arsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac. “Hello! Hello!” a singsong British voice shouted fr om across the tarmac. “Professor Langdon?” Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurrying toward him, waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protrude d from under a stylish knit wool hat. “Welcome to Washington, sir!” Langdon smiled. “Thank you.” “My name is Pam, from passenger services.” The woma n spoke with an exuberance that was almost unsettling. “If you’ll come with me, sir, your car is waiting.” Langdon followed her across the runway toward the S ignature terminal, which was surrounded by glisteni ng private jets. A taxi stand for the rich and famous. “I hate to embarrass you, Professor,” the woman sai d, sounding sheepish, “but you are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren’t you?” Langdon hesitated and then nodded. “I thought so!” she said, beaming. “ My book group read your book about the sacred femin ine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do en joy putting the fox in the henhouse!” Langdon smiled. “Scandal wasn’t really my intention .” The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mo od to discuss his work. “ I ’ m sorry. Listen to me"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"rattling on. I know you probably get tired of being recognized . . . but it ’ s your own fault. ” She playfully motioned to his clothing. “Your uniform gave you aw ay.” My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usual charcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafe rs . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lec ture circuit, author photos, and social events. The woman laughed. “Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You’d look much sharper in a tie!” No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses. Neckties had been required six days a week when Lan gdon attended Phillips Exeter Academy, and despite the headmaster’s romantic claims that the origin of the cravat went back to the silk fascalia worn by Roman orators to warm their vocal cords, Langdon knew tha t, etymologically, cravat actually derived from a ruthless band of “Croat” mercenaries who donned kno tted neckerchiefs before they stormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by mo dern office warriors hoping to intimidate their ene mies in daily boardroom battles. “Thanks for the advice,” Langdon said with a chuckl e. “I’ll consider a tie in the future.” Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark su it got out of a sleek Lincoln Town Car parked near the terminal and held up his finger. “Mr. Langdon? I’m Charles with Beltway Limousine.” He opened the passenger door. “Good evening, sir. Welcome to Wash ington.” Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then cli mbed into the plush interior of the Town Car. The d river showed him the temperature controls, the bottled wa ter, and the basket of hot muffins. Seconds later, Langdon was speeding away on a private access road. So this is how the other half lives. As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passenger manifest and placed a quick call. “This is Beltway Limousine,” the driver said with professional efficiency. “I was asked to confir m once my passenger had landed.” He paused. “Yes, sir. You r guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived, and I will deliv er him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You’re we lcome, sir.” He hung up. Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned . Peter Solomon’s attention to detail was one of hi s most potent assets, allowing him to manage his substantial powe r with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn’t hurt either. Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and clo sed his eyes as the noise of the airport faded behi nd him. The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and he appre ciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Every thing had happened so quickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about the incredible evening that lay ahead. Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect. Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing for Robert Langdon’s arrival. CHAPTER 2 The one who called himself Mal’akh pressed the tip of the needle against his shaved head, sighing with pleasure as the sharp tool plunged in and out of hi s flesh. The soft hum of the electric device was ad dictive . . . as was the bite of the needle sliding deep into h is dermis and depositing its dye."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" I am a masterpiece. The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal wa s change . From the scarified Nubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult o f ancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooed themselves as a way of offerin g up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduring th e physical pain of embellishment and emerging changed beings. Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking of one’s flesh, tattoos had become a rite of passage shared by millions of peop le in the modern age—everyone from clean- cut teenagers to hard-core drug users to suburban housewives. The act of tattooing one’s skin was a transformativ e declaration of power, an announcement to the worl d: I am in control of my own flesh. The intoxicating feeling of control derived from p hysical transformation had addicted millions to flesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding, and steroids . . . even bulimia and transgendering. The human spirit craves mastery over its carnal she ll. A single bell chimed on Mal’akh’s grandfather clock , and he looked up. Six thirty P.M. Leaving his too ls, he wrapped the Kiryu silk robe around his naked, six-f oot-three body and strode down the hall. The air in side this sprawling mansion was heavy with the pungent f ragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from the beeswa x candles he used to sterilize his needles. The tower ing young man moved down the corridor past priceles s Italian antiques—a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola c hair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp. He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring the classical skyline in the dista nce. The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowed with s olemn power against the dark winter sky. This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere. Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew i ts awesome power or the ingenious way in which it h ad been hidden. To this day, it remained this country’ s greatest untold secret. Those few who did know the truth kept it hidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, a nd allegory. Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal’akh thought. Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by Amer ica’s most influential men, Mal’akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of the wor ld’s oldest surviving brotherhood. Despite Mal’akh’ s new rank, the brethren had told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. That was not how it worked. There were circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within br otherhoods. Even if Mal’akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust. Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret. My initiation served its purpose. Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. Throughout his entire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare reco rding of a castrato singing the “Lux Aeterna” from the Verdi Requiem—a reminder of a previous life. Mal’akh touc hed a remote control to bring on the thundering “Di es Irae.” Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, he bounded up the marble stai rcase, his robe billowing as he ascended on sinewy legs. As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. Fo r two days now, Mal’akh had fasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the an cient ways. Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along with your pain. Mal’akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverenc e, locking the door behind him. As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn to the enormous gilded mirror. Unable to resist, h e turned and faced his own reflection. Slowly, as if unwrapp ing a priceless gift, Mal’akh opened his robe to un veil his naked form. The vision awed him."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" I am a masterpiece. His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet, which were tattooed wit h the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, his muscul ar legs were tattooed as carved pillars—his left le g spiraled and his right vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin . His groin and abdomen formed a decorated archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazo ned with the double-headed phoenix . . . each head in profile with its visible eye formed by one of Mal’a kh’s nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head were completely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils. I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon. One mortal man had seen Mal’akh naked, eighteen hou rs earlier. The man had shouted in fear. “Good God, you’re a demon!” “If you perceive me as such,” Mal’ akh had replied, understanding as had the ancients that angels and demons were identical—interchangeable archetypes— all a matter of polarity: the guardian angel who co nquered your enemy in battle was perceived by your enemy as a de mon destroyer. Mal’akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head. There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untat tooed flesh. This carefully guarded canvas was Mal’ akh’s only remaining piece of virgin skin. The sacred spa ce had waited patiently . . . and tonight, it would be filled. Although Mal’akh did not yet possess what he requir ed to complete his masterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching. Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already fee l his power growing. He closed his robe and walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical city befor e him. It is buried out there somewhere. Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal’akh went to his dressing table and carefully applied a base of con cealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until his tatto os had disappeared. Then he donned the special set of clothing and other items he had meticulously prepar ed for this evening. When he finished, he checked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft pal m across his smooth scalp and smiled. It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it. As Mal’akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soon shake the U.S. Capitol Building. He had gone to enormous lengths to arrang e all the pieces for tonight. And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the ga me. CHAPTER 3 Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car’s tires changed pitch on the road beneath him. Langdon glanced up, surprised to see where they were. Memorial Bridge already? He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm wat ers of the Potomac passing beneath him. A heavy mis t hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom h ad always seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation’s capital. Of all the places in the New Worl d, the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside mar sh on which to lay the cornerstone of their utopian socie ty."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully rounded silhouette of the Jefferson Memorial—America’s Pantheon, as many called it. Dir ectly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial ros e with rigid austerity, its orthogonal lines reminisc ent of Athens’s ancient Parthenon. But it was farth er away that Langdon saw the city’s centerpiece— the same spire he had seen from the air. Its archit ectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romans or the Greeks. America ’s Egyptian obelisk. The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loo med dead ahead, illuminated against the sky like th e majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon’s oblique ang le, the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . swaying against the dreary sky as if on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit to Washington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating a quiet Sunday at home . . . and now I’m a few minutes away from the U.S. Capito l. This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunge d into dead-calm water, beginning his day as he alw ays did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted Harvard Po ol. His physique was not quite what it had been in his college days as a water-polo all-American, but he w as still lean and toned, respectable for a man in h is forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdon to keep it that way. When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual of hand-grinding Sumatra coffee bean s and savoring the exotic scent that filled his kitch en. This morning, however, he was surprised to see the blinking red light on his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? He pressed the button and listened to the message. “Good morning, Professor Langdon, I’m terribly sorr y for this early-morning call.” The polite voice wa s noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southern acce nt. “My name is Anthony Jelbart, and I’m Peter Solo mon’s executive assistant. Mr. Solomon told me you’re an early riser . . . he has been trying to reach you t his morning on short notice. As soon as you receive thi s message, would you be so kind as to call Peter di rectly? You probably have his new private line, but if not, it’s 202-329-5746.” Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. P eter Solomon was impeccably well-bred and courteous , and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybre ak on a Sunday unless something was very wrong. Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried towar d his study to return the call. I hope he ’s okay. Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, altho ugh only twelve years Langdon’s senior, a father fi gure to him ever since their first meeting at Princeton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been requir ed to attend an evening guest lecture by the well-known y oung historian and philanthropist. Solomon had spok en with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vi sion of semiotics and archetypal history that had s parked in Langdon what would later become his lifelong pas sion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon’s brilli ance, however, but the humility in his gentle gray eyes t hat had given Langdon the courage to write him a th ank- you letter. The young sophomore had never dreamed t hat Peter Solomon, one of America’s wealthiest and most intriguing young intellectuals, would ever wri te back. But Solomon did. And it had been the begin ning of a truly gratifying friendship. A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, Peter Solomon came from the ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared o n buildings and universities all over the nation. L ike the Rothschilds in Europe, the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty and success. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of his father, and now, at fift y-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in his life. H e currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdon occasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was his diploma from a second-rate university—Yale. Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had received a fax from Peter as we ll. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Peter Solomon OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION Good morning, Robert, I need to speak with you at once. Please call me th is morning as soon as you can at 202-329-5746. Peter Langdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak desk to wait as the call we nt through. “Office of Peter Solomon,” the familiar voice of th e assistant answered. “This is Anthony. May I help y ou?” “Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a messa ge earlier—” “Yes, Professor Langdon!” The young man sounded rel ieved. “Thank you for calling back so quickly. Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him y ou’re on the line. May I put you on hold?” “Of course.” As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, h e gazed down at Peter’s name atop the Smithsonian letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in the Solomon clan. Peter’ s ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthy business magnates, influential pol iticians, and a number of distinguished scientists, some even fellows of London’s Royal Society. Solomon’s o nly living family member, his younger sister, Katherine, had apparently inherited the science gen e, because she was now a leading figure in a new cu tting- edge discipline called Noetic Science. All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine’s unsu ccessful attempt to explain Noetic Science to him at a party at her brother’s home las t year. Langdon had listened carefully and then rep lied, “Sounds more like magic than science.” Katherine winked playfully. “They’re closer than yo u think, Robert.” Now Solomon ’s assistant returned to the phone. “I’m sorry, Mr. Solomon is trying to get off a conference call. Things are a little chaotic here this morning .” “That’s not a problem. I can easily call back.” “Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if you don’t mind?” “Of course not.” The assistant inhaled deeply. “ As you probably know, Professor, every year here in Washington, the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank our m ost generous supporters. Many of the country’s cult ural elite attend.” Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturally elite, but he wondere d if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attend non etheless. “This year, as is customary,” the assistant continu ed, “the dinner will be preceded by a keynote addre ss. We’ve been lucky enough to secure the National Stat uary Hall for that speech.” The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture he had once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall. It was hard to forget f ive hundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc ,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"surrounded by thirty - eight life - size statues, in a room that had once served as the nation ’ s original House of Representatives chamber. “The problem is this,” the man said. “ Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address.” He paused awkwardly. “This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr . Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in.” Langdon did a double take. “Me?” This was not at al l what he had expected. “I’m sure Peter could find a far better substitute.” “You’re Mr. Solomon’s first choice, Professor, and you’re being much too modest. The institution’s gue sts would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomon thought you could give the same lecture you gave o n Bookspan TV a few years back? That way, you wouldn’ t have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involv ed symbolism in the architecture of our nation’s capit al—it sounds absolutely perfect for the venue.” Langdon was not so sure. “If I recall, that lecture had more to do with the Masonic history of the bui lding than—” “Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as a re many of his professional friends who will be in attendance. I’m sure they would love to hear you sp eak on the topic.” I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talk he’d ever given. “I suppose I could consider it. What date is the event?” The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. “Well, actually, sir, it’s tonight. ” Langdon laughed out loud. “Tonight?!” “That’s why it’s so hectic here this morning. The S mithsonian is in a deeply embarrassing predicament . . .” The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. “Mr. Solomo n is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only an hour, and you would be back home before midnight. You’re familiar with the private a ir terminal at Boston’s Logan Airport?” “I am,” Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way. “Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet th ere at say . . . five o’clock?” “You haven’t left me much choice, have you?” Langdo n chuckled. “I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir.” Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing no way out. “All right. Tell him I can do it.” “Outstanding!” the assistant exclaimed, sounding de eply relieved. He gave Langdon the jet’ s tail number and various other information. When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been told no. Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scoope d some additional beans into the grinder. A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It’s going to be a long day. CHAPTER 4"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the National Mall, on a raised plateau that cit y designer Pierre L’Enfant described as “a pedestal w aiting for a monument.” The Capitol’s massive footp rint measures more than 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing more than sixteen acres of floor spac e, it contains an astonishing 541 rooms. The neoclassical architecture is meticulously designed to echo the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals were the ins piration for America’s founders in establishing the laws and culture of the new republic. The new security checkpoint for tourists entering t he Capitol Building is located deep within the rece ntly completed subterranean visitor center, beneath a ma gnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Do me. Newly hired security guard Alfonso Nuñez carefully studied the male visitor now approaching his checkpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been lingering in the lobby, completing a phone call bef ore entering the building. His right arm was in a sling , and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navy surplus coat, which, combined wi th his shaved head, made Nuñez guess military. Thos e who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among the most common visitors to Washington. “Good evening, sir,” Nuñez said, following the secu rity protocol of verbally engaging any male visitor who entered alone. “Hello,” the visitor said, glancing around at the n early deserted entry. “Quiet night.” “NFC play-offs,” Nuñez replied. “Everyone’s watchin g the Redskins tonight.” Nuñez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he’d d rawn the short straw. “Metal objects in the dish, pl ease.” As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his one working hand, Nuñez watched him carefully. Human instinct made special allowances f or the injured and handicapped, but it was an insti nct Nuñez had been trained to override. Nuñez waited while the visitor removed from his poc kets the usual assortment of loose change, keys, an d a couple of cell phones. “Sprain?” Nuñez asked, eyein g the man’ s injured hand, which appeared to be wrapped in a series of thick Ace bandages. The bald man nodded. “Slipped on the ice. A week ag o. Still hurts like hell.” “Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please.” The visitor limped through the detector, and the ma chine buzzed in protest. The visitor frowned. “I was afraid of that. I’m wea ring a ring under these bandages. My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped right over it.” “No problem,” Nuñez said. “I’ll use the wand.” Nuñez ran the metal -detection wand over the visitor’ s wrapped hand. As expected, the only metal he dete cted was a large lump on the man’ s injured ring finger. Nuñez took his time rubbing the metal detector over every inch of the man’ s sling and finger. He knew his supervisor was prob ably monitoring him on the closed circuit in the building’s security center, and Nuñez needed this job. Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man’s sling. The visitor winced in pain. “Sorry.” “It’s okay,” the man said. “You can’t be too carefu l these days.” “Ain’t that the truth.” Nuñez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lot around here. Human instinct was America ’ s first line of defense against terrorism. It was a proven fact that human intuition was a more"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"accurate detector of danger than all the electronic gear in the world — the gift of fear, as one of their security reference books termed it. In this case, Nuñez’s instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. The only oddity that he notic ed, now that they were standing so close, was that this tou gh-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of s elf- tanner or concealer makeup on his face. Whatever . Everyone hates to be pale in the winter. “You’re fine,” Nuñez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand. “Thanks.” The man started collecting his belongings from the tray. As he did, Nuñez noticed that the two fingers protr uding from his bandage each bore a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and the tip of his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days, Nuñez thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots to get them. “Those tats hurt?” The man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled . “Less than you might think.” “Lucky,” Nuñez said. “Mine hurt a lot. I got a merm aid on my back when I was in boot camp.” “A mermaid?” The bald man chuckled. “Yeah,” he said, feeling sheepish. “The mistakes we make in our youth.” “I hear you,” the bald man said. “I made a big mist ake in my youth, too. Now I wake up with her every morning.” They both laughed as the man headed off. Child’s play, Mal’ akh thought as he moved past Nuñez and up the escal ator toward the Capitol Building. The entry had been easier than anticipated. Mal’akh’s s louching posture and padded belly had hidden his tr ue physique, while the makeup on his face and hands ha d hidden the tattoos that covered his body. The tru e genius, however, was the sling, which disguised the potent object Mal’akh was transporting into the bu ilding. A gift for the one man on earth who can help me obt ain what I seek. CHAPTER 5 The world’s largest and most technologically advanced museum i s also one of the world’s best-kept secrets. It houses more pieces than the Hermitage, the Vatic an Museum, and the New York Metropolitan . . . combined. Yet despite its magnificent collection, f ew members of the public are ever invited inside it s heavily guarded walls. Located at 4210 Silver Hill Road just outside of Wa shington, D.C., the museum is a massive zigzag-shap ed edifice constructed of five interconnected pods—eac h pod larger than a football field. The building’s b luish metal exterior barely hints at the strangeness with in—a six-hundred-thousand-square-foot alien world t hat contains a “dead zone,” a “wet pod,” and more than twelve miles of storage cabinets. Tonight, scientist Katherine Solomon was feeling un settled as she drove her white Volvo up to the buil ding’ s main security gate."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" The guard smiled. “Not a football fan, Ms. Solomon? ” He lowered the volume on the Redskins play-off pregame show. Katherine forced a tense smile. “It’s Sunday night. ” “Oh, that’s right. Your meeting.” “Is he here yet?” she asked anxiously. He glanced down at his paperwork. “I don’t see him on the log.” “I’m early.” Katherine gave a friendly wave and con tinued up the winding access road to her usual park ing spot at the bottom of the small, two- tiered lot. She began collecting her things and gav e herself a quick check in the rearview mirror—more out of force of habit t han actual vanity. Katherine Solomon had been blessed with the resilie nt Mediterranean skin of her ancestry, and even at fifty years old she had a smooth olive complexion. She us ed almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair unstyled and down. Like her older brother, Peter, s he had gray eyes and a slender, patrician elegance. You two might as well be twins, people often told them. Their father had succumbed to cancer when Katherine was only seven, and she had little memory of him. Her brother, eight years Katherine’s senior and only fi fteen when their father died, had begun his journey toward becoming the Solomon patriarch much sooner than any one had ever dreamed. As expected, though, Peter ha d grown into the role with the dignity and strength b efitting their family name. To this day, he still w atched over Katherine as though they were just kids. Despite her brother’s occasional prodding, and no s hortage of suitors, Katherine had never married. Sc ience had become her life partner, and her work had prove n more fulfilling and exciting than any man could e ver hope to be. Katherine had no regrets. Her field of choice—Noetic Science—had been virtual ly unknown when she first heard of it, but in recen t years it had started opening new doors of understan ding into the power of the human mind. Our untapped potential is truly shocking. Katherine’s two books on Noetics had established he r as a leader in this obscure field, but her most r ecent discoveries, when published, promised to make Noeti c Science a topic of mainstream conversation around the world. Tonight, however, science was the last thing on her mind. Earlier in the day, she had received some tr uly upsetting information relating to her brother. I still can’t believe it’s true. She’d thought of nothing else all afternoon. A pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield , and Katherine quickly gathered her things to get inside. She was about to step out of her car when her cell phone rang. She checked the caller ID and inhaled deeply. Then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settle d in to take the call. Six miles away, Mal’akh was moving through the corr idors of the U.S. Capitol Building with a cell phon e pressed to his ear. He waited patiently as the line rang. Finally, a woman’s voice answered. “Yes?” “ We need to meet again, ” Mal ’ akh said."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" There was a long pause. “Is everything all right?” “I have new information,” Mal’akh said. “Tell me.” Mal’akh took a deep breath. “That which your brothe r believes is hidden in D.C. . . . ?” “Yes?” “It can be found.” Katherine Solomon sounded stunned. “You’re telling me—it is real ?” Mal’akh smiled to himself. “Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.” CHAPTER 6 Is this as close as you can get?” Robert Langdon felt a su dden wave of anxiety as his driver parked on First Street, a good quarter mile from the Capitol Buildi ng. “Afraid so,” the driver said. “Homeland Security. N o vehicles near landmark buildings anymore. I’m sor ry, sir.” Langdon checked his watch, startled to see it was a lready 6:50. A construction zone around the Nationa l Mall had slowed them down, and his lecture was to begin in ten minutes. “Weather’s turning,” the driver said, hopping out a nd opening Langdon’s door for him. “You’ll want to hurry.” Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the d river, but the man waved him off. “Your host alread y added a very generous tip to the charge.” Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. “Okay, than ks for the ride.” The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon re ached the top of the gracefully arched concourse th at descended to the new “underground” visitors’ entran ce. The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and co ntroversial project. Described as an underground ci ty to rival parts of Disney World, this subterranean spac e reportedly provided over a half-million square fe et of space for exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls. Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, alth ough he hadn’t anticipated quite this long a walk. The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and h e broke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement. I dressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard do wnhill dash through the rain! When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless an d panting. Langdon pushed through the revolving doo r, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath an d brush off the rain. As he did, he raised his eyes to the newly completed space before him. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Okay, I ’ m impressed. The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he h ad expected. Because the space was underground, Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. A childhood accident had left him stranded at the bottom of a deep well overnight, and Langdon now li ved with an almost crippling aversion to enclosed spaces. But this underground space was . . . airy s omehow. Light. Spacious. The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a seri es of dramatic light fixtures that threw a muted gl ow across the pearl-colored interior finishes. Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in h ere to admire the architecture, but with five minut es until showtime, he put his head down and dashed thr ough the main hall toward the security checkpoint a nd escalators. Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you’re on your way. The event won’t sta rt without you. At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatt ed with him while Langdon emptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch. “Mickey Mouse?” the guard said, sounding mildly amu sed. Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The col lector’s edition Mickey Mouse watch had been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. “I wear it to remind me to slow down and take life less seriou sly.” “I don’t think it’s working,” the guard said with a smile. “You look like you’re in a serious hurry.” Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. “Which way to the Statuary Hall?” The guard motioned toward the escalators. “You’ll se e the signs.” “Thanks.” Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor a nd hurried on. As the escalator ascended, Langdon took a deep brea th and tried to gather his thoughts. He gazed up th rough the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainous form of the illuminated Capitol Dome overhead. It w as an astonishing building. High atop her roof, almost th ree hundred feet in the air, the Statue of Freedom peered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel . Langdon always found it ironic that the workers w ho hoisted each piece of the nineteen-and-a-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves—a Capitol se cret that seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes. This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana that included a “killer bathtub” responsible for the pneumonic murder of Vice President Henry Wi lson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which an inordinate number of guests seemed to trip , and a sealed basement chamber in which workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan’s long -deceased stuffed horse. No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghosts that haunted this bui lding. The spirit of city designer Pierre L’Enfant frequen tly was reported wandering the halls, seeking payme nt of his bill, now two hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Dome during construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And, of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in the C apitol basement—an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure’s eerie maze of narrow passageways and cubicles. Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. He hurried down the wide corridor, following the signs toward the Statuary H all and rehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter’s assistant had bee n correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect ma tch for an event hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason. It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic histo ry. The cornerstone of this very building had been laid in a full Masonic ritual by George Washington himself. T his city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons—George Washington, Ben Franklin, and Pierre L’Enfant—powerful minds who adorned their new capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and a rt."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas. Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic foref athers had concealed powerful secrets throughout Washington along with symbolic messages hidden in t he city’s layout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation about the Masons was so c ommonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to have surprisingly warped conceptions abou t the brotherhood. Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Lan gdon’ s classroom with a printout from the Web. It was a street map of D.C. on which certain streets had bee n highlighted to form various shapes— satanic pentacles, a Masonic compass and square, the head of Baphomet—pr oof apparently that the Masons who designed Washington, D.C., were involved in some kind of dar k, mystical conspiracy. “Fun,” Langdon said, “but hardly convincing. If you draw enough intersecting lines on a map, you’re bo und to find all kinds of shapes.” “But this can’t be coincidence!” the kid exclaimed. Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formed on a street map of Det roit. The kid seemed sorely disappointed. “Don’t be disheartened,” Langdon said. “Washington does have some incredible secrets . . . just none on th is street map.” The young man perked up. “Secrets? Like what?” “Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbol s. I talk a lot about D.C. You should take the cour se.” “ Occult symbols!” The freshman looked excited again. “So t here are devil symbols in D.C.!” Langdon smiled. “Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devil worship, actuall y means ‘hidden’ or ‘obscured.’ In times of religious oppre ssion, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to b e kept hidden or ‘occult,’ and because the church felt thr eatened by this, they redefined anything ‘occult’ as evil, and the prejudice survived.” “Oh.” The kid slumped. Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the fresh man seated in the front row as five hundred student s bustled into Harvard’s Sanders Theatre, a hollow ol d lecture hall with creaking wooden benches. “Good morning, everybody,” Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turned on a slide projector, a nd an image materialized behind him. “As you’ re getting settled, how many of you recognize the b uilding in this picture?” “U.S. Capitol!” dozens of voices called out in unis on. “Washington, D.C.!” “ Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in t hat dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ing enuity for the 1850s.” “Awesome!” somebody shouted. Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. “Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington?” A scattering of hands went up. “ So few? ” Langdon feigned surprise. “ And how many of you have been to Rome, Paris, Madri d, or"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"London? ” Almost all the hands in the room went up. As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college k ids was a summer with a Eurorail ticket before the harsh reality of real life set in. “It appears many more of you have visited Europe than have visi ted your own capital. Why do you think that is?” “No drinking age in Europe!” someone in back shoute d. Langdon smiled. “As if the drinking age here stops any of you?” Everyone laughed. It was the first day of school, and the students we re taking longer than usual to get settled, shiftin g and creaking in their wooden pews. Langdon loved teachi ng in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students were simply by listening to how much t hey fidgeted in their pews. “Seriously,” Langdon said, “Washington, D.C., has s ome of the world’s finest architecture, art, and symbolism. Why would you go overseas before visitin g your own capital?” “Ancient stuff is cooler,” someone said. “And by ancient stuff,” Langdon clarified, “I assume you mean castles, crypts, temples, that sort of th ing?” Their heads nodded in unison. “Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C ., has every one of those things? Castles, crypts, pyramids, temples . . . it’s all there.” The creaking diminished. “My friends,” Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of the stage, “in the next hour , you will discover that our nation is overflowing with s ecrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe , all of the best secrets are hidden in plain view.” The wooden pews fell dead silent. Gotcha. Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. “Who can tell me what George Washington is doing here?” The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washi ngton dressed in full Masonic regalia standing befo re an odd-looking contraption—a giant wooden tripod th at supported a rope-and-pulley system from which wa s suspended a massive block of stone. A group of well -dressed onlookers stood around him. “Lifting that big block of stone?” someone ventured . Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student mak e the correction if possible. “Actually,” another student offered, “I think Washin gton is lowering the rock. He’s wearing a Masonic costume. I’ve seen pictures of Masons laying corner stones before. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone.” “Excellent,” Langdon said. “The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using a tripod and pulley to lay the cornerstone of our Capitol Building on Septembe r 18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty. ” Langdon paused, scanning the class. “ Can anyone tell me the significance of that date an d"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"time? ” Silence. “What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons—George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Pierre L’Enfant, the primary architect for D.C.?” More silence. “Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, among other things, the auspicio us Caput Draconis was in Virgo.” Everyone exchanged odd looks. “Hold on,” someone said. “You mean . . . like astrology ?” “Exactly. Although a different astrology than we kn ow today.” A hand went up. “You mean our Founding Fathers beli eved in astrology?” Langdon grinned. “Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city of Washington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any other city in the world— zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at precise astrological dates and times? More than hal f of the framers of our Constitution were Masons, m en who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined, men who paid close attention to the la yout of the heavens as they structured their new world.” “But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while Caput Draconis was in Virgo—who cares? Can’t that just be coincidence?” “An impressive coincidence considering that the cor nerstones of the three structures that make up Fede ral Triangle—the Capitol, the White House, the Washingt on Monument—were all laid in different years but were carefully timed to occur under this exact same astrological condition.” Langdon’s gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dipped down as students began taking notes. A hand in back went up. “Why did they do that?” Langdon chuckled. “The answer to that is an entire semester’s worth of material. If you’re curious, yo u should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don’t t hink you guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer.” “What?” the person shouted. “Try us!” Langdon made a show of considering it and then shoo k his head, toying with them. “Sorry, I can’t do th at. Some of you are only freshmen. I’m afraid it might blow your minds.” “Tell us!” everyone shouted. Langdon shrugged. “Perhaps you should join the Maso ns or Eastern Star and learn about it from the sour ce.” “We can’t get in,” a young man argued. “The Masons are like a supersecret society!” “Supersecret? Really?” Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friend Peter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. “Then why do Masons wear obvious Masonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Why are their mee ting times in the newspaper?” Langdon smiled at all the puzzled faces. “My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a society with secr ets.” "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"“ Same thing, ” someone muttered. “Is it?” Langdon challenged. “Would you consider Co ca-Cola a secret society?” “Of course not,” the student said. “Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked for the recipe for Classic Coke?” “They’d never tell you.” “Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola’s deepest sec ret, you would need to join the company, work for m any years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventually r ise to the upper echelons of the company, where tha t information might be shared with you. Then you woul d be sworn to secrecy.” “So you’re saying Freemasonry is like a corporation ?” “Only insofar as they have a strict hierarchy an d they take secrecy very seriously.” “My uncle is a Mason,” a young woman piped up. “And my aunt hates it because he won’t talk about it wi th her. She says Masonry is some kind of strange relig ion.” “A common misperception.” “It’s not a religion?” “Give it the litmus test,” Langdon said. “Who here has taken Professor Witherspoon’s comparative religi on course?” Several hands went up. “Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to be considered a religion?” “ABC,” one woman offered. “Assure, Believe, Convert .” “Correct,” Langdon said. “Religions assure salvation; religions believe in a precise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers.” He paused. “Masonry, however, is ba tting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; they have no specific theology; and t hey do not seek to convert you. In fact, within Mas onic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited.” “So . . . Masonry is anti religious?” “On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for beco ming a Mason is that you must believe in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality and org anized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition or name on a higher power. Rath er than definitive theological identities like God, Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being or Great Architect of the Unive rse. This enables Masons of different faiths to gather t ogether.” “Sounds a little far-out,” someone said. “Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?” Langdon of fered. “In this age when different cultures are kil ling each other over whose definition of God is better, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance an d open- mindedness is commendable.” Langdon paced the stage . “ Moreover, Masonry is open to men of all races, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual frater nity that does not discriminate in any way.” “Doesn’t discriminate?” A member of the university’ s Women’s Center stood up. “How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?” Langdon showed his palms in surrender. “ A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots, traditiona lly, in the stone"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"masons ’ guilds of Europe and was therefore a man ’ s organization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women’s branch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members .” “Nonetheless,” the woman said, “Masonry is a powerf ul organization from which women are excluded.” Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was not goi ng to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from their being a group of harmless old men who liked t o play dress-up . . . all the way to an underground c abal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt, was somewhere in the middle. “Professor Langdon,” called a young man with curly hair in the back row, “ if Masonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, then what is it?” “Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer t he following definition: Masonry is a system of mor ality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols.” “Sounds to me like a euphemism for ‘freaky cult.’ ” “ Freaky, you say?” “Hell yes!” the kid said, standing up. “I heard wha t they do inside those secret buildings! Weird cand lelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wine out of skulls. Now that’s freaky!” Langdon scanned the class. “Does that sound freaky to anyone else?” “Yes!” they all chimed in. Langdon feigned a sad sigh. “Too bad. If that’s too freaky for you, then I know you’ll never want to j oin my cult.” Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women’s Center looked uneasy. “ You’re in a cult?” Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspirat orial whisper. “Don’t tell anyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of an ancien t instrument of torture and consume ritualistic sym bols of blood and flesh.” The class looked horrified. Langdon shrugged. “ And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harv ard chapel on Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion.” The classroom remained silent. Langdon winked. “Open your minds, my friends. We al l fear what we do not understand.” The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Ca pitol corridors. Seven o’clock. Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing through the House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National S tatuary Hall and headed straight for it. As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant st roll and took several deep breaths. Buttoning his j acket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turned the corner just as the final chime sounded. Showtime. "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the Nationa l Statuary Hall, he raised his eyes and smiled warm ly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stopped dead in his tracks. Something was very, very wrong. CHAPTER 7 Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold ra in, wishing she had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared the bui lding ’s main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifie rs got louder. She barely heard them, her ears still r inging from the phone call she’d just received. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Katherine found the notion almost impossible to bel ieve. She and the caller still had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening. Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always felt upon entering the garga ntuan building. Nobody knows this place is here. The sign on the door announced: SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER (SMSC) The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more th an a dozen massive museums on the National Mall, ha d a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could be on display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to be stored somewhere. And that som ewhere . . . was here . Not surprisingly, this building was home to an asto nishingly diverse array of artifacts —giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea , jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were the building’s natural treasures—plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteor ite collection, a giant squid, even a collection of ele phant skulls brought back from an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt. But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, had introduced his sister to the SM SC three years ago. He had brought her to this place n ot to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that was exactly what Katherine had been doing. Deep within this building, in the darkness of the m ost remote recesses, was a small scientific laborat ory unlike any other in the world. The recent breakthro ughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science had ramifications across every discipline—f rom physics, to history, to philosophy, to religion . Soon everything will change, she thought. As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guar d quickly stashed his radio and yanked the earplugs from his ears. “Ms. Solomon!” He smiled broadly. “ Redskins? ”"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" He blushed, looking guilty. “Pregame.” She smiled. “I won’t tell.” She walked to the metal detector and emptied her pockets. When she slid th e gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usual pa ng of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from h er mother for Katherine’s eighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had died violently . . . passing away in Katherine’s arms. “So, Ms. Solomon?” the guard whispered jokingly. “A re you ever gonna tell anybody what you’re doing back there?” She glanced up. “Someday, Kyle. Not tonight.” “Come on,” he pressed. “A secret lab . . . in a sec ret museum? You must be doing something cool.” Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth was that Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resemble d science. CHAPTER 8 Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statua ry Hall and studied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he remembered it—a balanced semicircle built in the style of a G reek amphitheater. The graceful arched walls of sandston e and Italian plaster were punctuated by columns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation’s statuary collection—life-size statues of thirty-eig ht great Americans standing in a semicircle on a stark expan se of black-and-white marble tile. It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lec ture he had once attended here. Except for one thing. Tonight, the room was empty. No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a ha ndful of tourists milling around aimlessly, oblivio us to Langdon’s grand entrance. Did Peter mean the Rotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could see tourists milling around in th ere, too. The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon wa s now officially late. He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent . “Excuse me, the lecture for the Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?” The docent hesitated. “I’m not sure, sir. When does it start?” “Now!” The man shook his head. “I don’t know about any Smi thsonian event this evening—not here, at least.” Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning the entire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn’t imagine it. He pulled out his cel l phone and the fax page from this morning and dialed Peter’s number. "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside t he enormous building. Finally, it began to ring. The familiar southern accent answered. “Peter Solom on’s office, this is Anthony. May I help you?” “Anthony!” Langdon said with relief. “I’m glad you’ re still there. This is Robert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I’m standing in t he Statuary Hall, but there’s nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to a different room?” “I don’t believe so, sir. Let me check.” His assist ant paused a moment. “Did you confirm with Mr. Solom on directly?” Langdon was confused. “No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!” “Yes, I recall that.” There was a silence on the li ne. “That was a bit careless of you, don’t you thin k, Professor?” Langdon was now fully alert. “I beg your pardon?” “Consider this . . .” the man said. “ You received a fax asking you to call a number, whi ch you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was Peter Solomon’s assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private pl ane to Washington and climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?” Langdon felt a chill race through his body. “Who th e hell is this? Where is Peter?” “I’m afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you’re in Was hington today.” The man’ s southern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluous wh isper. “You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here.” CHAPTER 9 Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell ph one to his ear and paced in a tight circle. “Who the hell are you?” The man’s reply was a silky calm whisper. “Do not b e alarmed, Professor. You have been summoned here for a reason.” “Summoned?” Langdon felt like a caged animal. “Try kidnapped!” “Hardly.” The man’s voice was eerily serene. “ If I wanted to harm you, you would be dead in your Town Car right now.” He let the words hang for a moment. “My intentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you an invitation.” No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon’s unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this one h ad just crossed a very serious line. “Look, I don’t know what the hell is going on here, but I’m hanging up— ” “Unwise,” said the man. “Your window of opportunity is very small if you want to save Peter Solomon’s soul.” Langdon drew a sharp breath. “What did you say?” "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"“ I ’ m sure you heard me. ” The way this man had uttered Peter’s name had stopp ed Langdon cold. “What do you know about Peter?” “At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Sol omon is my guest, and I can be a persuasive host.” This can’t be happening. “You don’t have Peter.” “I answered his private cell phone. That should giv e you pause.” “I’m calling the police.” “No need,” the man said. “The authorities will join you momentarily.” What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon’s tone hardened. “If you have Peter, put hi m on the phone right now.” “ “That’s impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an un fortunate place.” The man paused. “He is in the Ara f.” “Where?” Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tig htly his fingers were going numb. “The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante de voted the canticle immediately following his legendary Inferno ?” The man’s religious and literary references solidif ied Langdon’s suspicion that he was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobody escaped Phillips Exet er Academy without reading Dante. “You’re saying you think Peter Solom on is . . . in purgatory ?” “A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solo mon is in the in-between .” The man’s words hung in Langdon’s ear. “Are you say ing Peter is . . . dead ?” “Not exactly, no.” “Not exactly?!” Langdon yelled, his voice echoing s harply in the hall. A family of tourists looked ove r at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. “ Death is usually an all-or-nothing thing!” “ You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding of the mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between—a world in which Peter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, or he can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now.” Langdon tried to process this. “What do you want fr om me?” “It’s simple. You have been given access to somethi ng quite ancient. And tonight, you will share it wi th me.” “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” “No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secr ets that have been entrusted to you?” Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessi ng what this was probably about. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about his experien ces in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanat ics had followed the media coverage closely, some connectin g the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail—perhaps even its location. “Look,” Langdon said, “if this is about the Holy Gr ail, I can assure you I know nothing more than—” “Don’t insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon,” the ma n snapped. “ I have no interest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind ’ s pathetic debate over whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"over the semantics of faith hold no interest for me . Those are questions answered only through death. ” The stark words left Langdon confused. “Then what t he hell is this about?” The man paused for several seconds. “As you may kno w, there exists within this city an ancient portal. ” An ancient portal? “And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored I contacted you—this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have been ch osen.” And you have lost your mind. “I’m sorry, but you’ve chosen poorly,” Langdon sai d. “I don’t know anything about any ancient portal.” “You don’t understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was Peter Solomon .” “What?” Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper . “Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that only one man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you .” “If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying .” “I think not. He was in a fragile state when he con fessed that fact, and I am inclined to believe him. ” Langdon felt a stab of anger. “I’m warning you, if you hurt Peter in any—” “It’s far too late for that, ” the man said in an amused tone. “I’ve already tak en what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you provide wh at I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggest you find the portal and unlock it. P eter will point the way.” Peter? “I thought you said Peter was in ‘purgatory.’” “As above, so below,” the man said. Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange respon se was an ancient Hermetic adage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven and earth . As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered how everything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. “Look, I don’t know how to find any ancient portal. I’m calling the police.” “It really hasn’t dawned on you yet, has it? Why yo u were chosen?” “No,” Langdon said. “It will, ” he replied, chuckling. “Any moment now.” Then the line went dead. Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what had just happened. Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected s ound. It was coming from the Rotunda. Someone was screaming. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 10 Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but never at a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group of t ourists clustered in the center of the room. A smal l boy was screaming, and his parents were trying to console h im. Others were crowding around, and several securi ty guards were doing their best to restore order. “He pulled it out of his sling,” someone said frant ically, “and just left it there!” As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all the commotion. Admittedly, th e object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presen ce hardly warranted screaming. The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen ma ny times. The Harvard art department had dozens of these—life-size plastic models used by sculptors an d painters to help them render the human body’s mos t complex feature, which, surprisingly, was not the h uman face but rather the human hand. Someone left a mannequin hand in the Rotunda? Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingers enabl ing an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which for soph omoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straight up in the air. This handeq uin, however, had been positioned with its index fi nger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling. As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this ha ndequin was unusual. Its plastic surface was not sm ooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled and sli ghtly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . . Like real skin. Langdon stopped abruptly. Now he saw the blood. My God! The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered on to a spiked wooden base so that it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched clos er, unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb had been decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what held Langdon’s attention. His gaze moved instantly to th e familiar golden ring on the fourth finger. No. Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he rea lized he was looking at the severed right hand of P eter Solomon. CHAPTER 11 Why isn’t Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cell phone. Where is he? For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for their weekly seven P.M. Sunday- night meetings. It was their private family ritual, a way to remain connected before the start of a new week , and for"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Peter to stay up - to - date on Katherine ’ s work at the lab. He ’s never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make matters worse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he did finally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today? Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like a spine through the SMSC. Kn own as “The Street,” the corridor connected the buildin g’s five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory system of orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building—the pulsing sounds o f thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circu lated. Normally, during her nearly quarter -mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmed by the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had her on edge. What she had learned about her brother to day would have troubled anyone, and yet because Peter w as the only family she had in the world, Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping s ecrets from her. As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her o nly once . . . a wonderful secret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, her brother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducin g her to the SMSC by proudly showing off some of the buil ding’s more unusual items—the Mars meteorite ALH- 84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sittin g Bull, a collection of wax-sealed Ball jars contai ning original specimens collected by Charles Darwin. At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherine caught a glimpse of what la y beyond and gasped. “What in the world is that ?!” Her brother chuckled and kept walking. “Pod Three. It’s called Wet Pod. Pretty unusual sight, isn’t it ?” Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was lik e another planet . “What I really want to show you is in Pod Five,” he r brother said, guiding her down the seemingly endl ess corridor. “It’s our newest addition. It was built t o house artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History. That collection is scheduled fo r relocation here in about five years, which means Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment.” Katherine glanced over. “Empty? So why are we looki ng at it?” Her brother’s gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief . “It occurred to me that because nobody is using t he space, maybe you could use it.” “Me?” “Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated la b space—a facility where you can actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you’ve been developi ng for all these years.” Katherine stared at her brother in shock. “But, Pet er, those experiments are theoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible.” “Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this buildin g is perfect for you. The SMSC is not just a wareho use of treasures; it’s one of the world’s most advanced sc ientific research facilities. We’re constantly taki ng pieces from the collection and examining them with the bes t quantitative technologies money can buy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal.” “Peter, the technologies required to run these expe riments are—” “Already in place.” He smiled broadly. “The lab is done.” Katherine stopped short. "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Her brother pointed down the long corridor. “ We ’ re going to see it now. ” Katherine could barely speak. “You . . . you built me a lab?” “It’s my job. The Smithsonian was established to ad vance scientific knowledge. As secretary, I must ta ke that charge seriously. I believe the experiments yo u’ve proposed have the potential to push the bounda ries of science into uncharted territory.” Peter stopped an d looked her squarely in the eyes. “Whether or not y ou were my sister, I would feel obliged to support thi s research. Your ideas are brilliant. The world des erves to see where they lead.” “Peter, I can’t possibly—” “Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody’ s using Pod Five right now. When you’re done with your experiments, you’ll move out. Besides, Pod Fiv e has some unique properties that will be perfect f or your work.” Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty p od might offer that would serve her research, but s he sensed she was about to find out. They had just rea ched a steel door with boldly stenciled letters: POD 5 Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and a n electronic keypad lit up. He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrows in th e same mischievous way he always had as a boy. “You sure you’re ready?” She nodded. My brother, always the showman. “Stand back.” Peter hit the keys. The steel door hissed loudly open. Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moan seemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanatin g from within. It was like staring into the Grand C anyon at night. “Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a flee t of Airbuses,” her brother said, “and you get the basic idea.” Katherine felt herself take a step backward. “The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermally insulated cinder-block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner of t he pod for maximum separation.” Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into the darkness, but it was absolute. “How far back?” “Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you, though, the walk is a little unnerving. It’s exceptionally dark.” Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. “No light switch?” “Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity.” “But . . . then how can a lab function?” He winked. “ Hydrogen fuel cell. ”"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" Katherine’s jaw dropped. “You’re kidding, right?” “Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab e njoys full radio-frequency separation from the rest of the building. What’s more, all pod exteriors are se aled with photo- resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solar radiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment.” Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of her work centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her e xperiments needed to be performed in a location iso lated from any extraneous radiation or “white noise.” Thi s included interference as subtle as “brain radiati on” or “thought emissions” generated by people nearby. For this reason, a university campus or hospital lab wouldn’t work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could not have been more perfect. “Let’s go back and have a look.” Her brother was gr inning as he stepped into the vast darkness. “Just follow me.” Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? She wanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into the abyss. “Peter?” she called. “Leap of faith,” he called back, his voice already fading away. “You’ll find your way. Trust me.” He ’s kidding, right? Katherine’s heart was pounding as she stepped a fe w feet over the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can’t see a thing! Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut be hind her, plunging her into total blackness. Not a speck of l ight anywhere. “Peter?!” Silence. You’ll find your way. Trust me. Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not even see her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but within a matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going? That was three years ago. Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal d oor, she realized how far she had come since that f irst night. Her lab—nicknamed the Cube—had become her ho me, a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted, she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every day since—thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance syst em that her brother had let her discover for hersel f. Far more important, her brother’s other prediction had come true as well: Katherine’s experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in the l ast six months, breakthroughs that would alter enti re paradigms of thinking. Katherine and her brother ha d agreed to keep her results absolutely secret unti l the implications were more fully understood. One day so on, however, Katherine knew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations i n human history. A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into the Pod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN. The steel door hissed open. The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the sam e blast of cold air. As always, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb. Strangest commute on earth . "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as she stepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her i nside. Where is Peter? CHAPTER 12 Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. Capitol Complex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face and red hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, g iving him an air of military authority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough to q uestion the extent of his authority. Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinatin g his small army of police officers from a high-tec h surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol. Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computer readouts, and a telephone switch board that kept him in contact with the many securi ty personnel he commanded. This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had been hoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in his o ffice. The game had just kicked off when his interc om buzzed. “Chief?” Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the televisio n as he pressed the button. “Yeah.” “We’ve got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I’ve got officers arriving now, but I think you’ll want to have a look.” “Right.” Anderson walked into the security nerve ce nter—a compact, neomodern facility packed with computer monitors. “What have you got?” The technician was cueing a digital video clip on h is monitor. “Rotunda east balcony camera. Twenty seconds ago.” He played the clip. Anderson watched over the technician’s shoulder. The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists. Anderson’s trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone and mov ing faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket. Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone. The bald man’s footfalls echoed crisply on the audi o feed until, suddenly, arriving at the exact cente r of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phone call, an d then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instea d of tying a shoe, he pulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up and limpe d briskly toward the east exit. Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had l eft behind. What in the world? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouched clo ser to the screen and squinted. That can’t be what it looks like! As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through t he east portico, a little boy nearby could be heard saying, “Mommy, that man dropped something.” The boy drifted toward the object but suddenly stop ped short. After a long, motionless beat, he pointed and let out a d eafening scream. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the do or, barking orders as he went. “ Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!” Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up t he treads of the well-worn staircase three at a tim e. The security feed had shown the bald man with the sling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shorte st route out of the building would therefore take him throug h the east-west corridor, which was just ahead. I can head him off. As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyed the quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand in hand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook and studying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber. “Excuse me, sir!” Anderson barked, running toward h im. “Have you seen a bald man with a sling on his arm?” The man looked up from his book with a confused exp ression. “A bald man with a sling!” Anderson repeated more f irmly. “Have you seen him?” The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of the hallway. “Uh . . . yes,” he said. “I think he just ran past me . . . to that staircas e over there.” He pointed down the hall. Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. “ All points! The suspect is headed for the southeast exit. Converge!” He stowed the radio and yanked his sidea rm from its holster, running toward the exit. Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east s ide of the Capitol, the powerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air. He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening. Transformation. It had been so easy. Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surplus coat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the bl ue blazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled a blond wig from the pock et and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood up straight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmly from the niche with an elegant gait. Transformation. This is my gift. As Mal’akh’s mortal legs carried him toward his wai ting limousine, he arched his back, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back his shoulde rs. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lun gs. He could feel the wings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide. If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight my transformation will be complete. Mal’akh had played his cards artfully within the Ca pitol Building, showing obeisance to all the ancien t etiquettes. The ancient invitation has been delivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonig ht, soon he would. CHAPTER 13 "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda—like St. Peter's Basilica—alwa ys had a way of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so l arge that the Statue of Liberty could stand comfort ably inside it, but somehow the Rotunda always felt larg er and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if the re were spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was onl y chaos. Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda wh ile attempting to herd distraught tourists away fro m the hand. The little boy was still crying. A bright lig ht flashed—a tourist taking a photo of the hand— and several guards immediately detained the man, taking his cam era and escorting him off. In the confusion, Langdo n felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping t hrough the crowd, inching closer to the hand. Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upr ight, the flat plane of the detached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three of th e fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb an d index finger were fully extended, pointing up toward the soaring dome. “Everyone back!” an officer called. Langdon was close enough now that he could see drie d blood, which had run down from the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed . . . which means Pet er is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved or nauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat. He thought of all the times his dear fr iend had extended this same hand to shake Langdon's or offer a warm embrace. For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank , like an untuned television set broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through was utterl y unexpected. A crown . . . and a star. Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's t humb and index finger. Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooed tiny sy mbols on Peter's fingertips. On the thumb—a crown. On the index finger—a star. This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind, amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. These symbols h ad appeared together many times in history, and alw ays in the same place—on the fingertips of a hand. It w as one of the ancient world's most coveted and secr etive icons. The Hand of the Mysteries. The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout hi story it had symbolized a powerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifa ct now before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand? It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sc ulpted in stone or wood or rendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of t he Hand of the Mysteries being fashioned from actua l flesh. The concept was abhorrent. “Sir?” a guard said behind Langdon. “Please step ba ck.” Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos . Although he could not see the fingertips of the t hree clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips wou ld bear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total. Through the mille nnia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of the Mysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand' s iconic purpose. The hand represents . . . an invitation. Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the word s of the man who had brought him here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime. In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actual ly served as the most coveted invitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elite gr oup —"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of a ll the ages. The invitation not only was a great ho nor, but it signified that a master believed you were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extended to the initiate. “Sir,” the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langd on's shoulder. “I need you to back up right now.” “I know what this means,” Langdon managed. “I can h elp you.” “Now!” the guard said. “My friend is in trouble. We have to—” Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leadi ng him away from the hand. He simply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest. A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someon e was summoning Langdon to unlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries and hidden knowledge. But it was all madness. Delusions of a lunatic. CHAPTER 14 Mal’akh’s stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastward down Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see through the tinted rear windows, hoping to glim pse a VIP. I ’m in front, Mal’akh thought, smiling to himself. Mal’ akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car all alone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight—the guarantee of privacy . Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind of unspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near Capitol Hill were never certain what power broker they might mis takenly pull over in a limousine, and so most simpl y chose not to take the chance. As Mal’akh crossed the Anacostia River into Marylan d, he could feel himself moving closer to Katherine , pulled onward by destiny’s gravity. I am being called to a second task tonight . . . on e I had not imagined. Last night, when Peter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal’akh had learned of the existence of a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracl es—staggering breakthroughs that Mal’akh realized would change the world if they were ever made known . Her work will unveil the true nature of all things. For centuries the “brightest minds” on earth had ig nored the ancient sciences, mocking them as ignoran t superstitions, arming themselves instead with smug skepticism and dazzling new technologies— tools that led them only further from the truth. Every generation’s breakthroughs are proven false b y the next generation’ s technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more man learned, the more he realized he did not know. For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had been prophesied, there was a"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"change coming. After hurtling blindly through histo ry, mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment h ad been predicted long ago, prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by the s tars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival immi nent. It would be preceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity to illuminate th e darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from the abyss and take the path of wisdom. I have come to obscure the light, Mal’akh thought. This is my role. Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs Katherine Solomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of ne w thinking, starting a new Renaissance. Katherine’s revelations, if made public, would become a catalys t that would inspire mankind to rediscover the know ledge he had lost, empowering him beyond all imagination. Katherine ’s destiny is to light this torch. Mine is to extinguish it. CHAPTER 15 In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer d oor of her lab. Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entry ro om. The journey across the void had taken only nine ty seconds, and yet her heart was pounding wildly. After three years, you’d think I’d be used to that . Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step into this clean, well-lit space. The “Cube” was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls and ceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium- coated lead fiber, giving the impression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frosted Plexiglas separated the space i nto different compartments—a laboratory, a control room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library. Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bri ght and sterile work space glistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalogra phs, a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, an d quantum-indeterminate electronic noise REGs, more s imply known as Random Event Generators. Despite Noetic Science’s use of cutting-edge techno logies, the discoveries themselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that wer e producing them. The stuff of magic and myth was f ast becoming reality as the shocking new data poured in , all of it supporting the basic ideology of Noetic Science—the untapped potential of the human mind. The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities. Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noe tic Sciences (IONS) in California and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) had categ orically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability to affect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no “spoon-bending” parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiri es that all produced the same extraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world, wheth er or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomic realm. Mind over matter. In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying even ts of September 11, the field of Noetic Science mad e a quantum leap forward.

The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the a ncient spiritual belief in a “cosmic consciousness” — a vast coalescing of human intention that was actually cap able of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in mass meditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators, fueling the cla im that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggart described it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highly ordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine h ad been fascinated by McTaggart’s book The Intention Experiment, and her global, Web-based study— theintentionexperiment.com—aimed at discovering how human intention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had also piqued Katherin e’s interest. From this foundation, Katherine Solomon’s research had vaulted forward, proving that “focused thought” could affect literally anything —the growth rate of plants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cells divided in a petri dish, the synchro nization of separately automated systems, and the c hemical reactions in one’ s own body. Even the crystalline structure of a new ly forming solid was rendered mutable by one’s mind; Katherine had created beautifully symme trical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass of water as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sent negative, polluting t houghts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic, fractured forms. Human thought can literally transform the physical world. As Katherine’s experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Her work in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that “mind over matter” was not just some New Age self-help mantra . The mind had the ability to alter the state of matt er itself, and, more important, the mind had the po wer to encourage the physical world to move in a specific direction. We are the masters of our own universe. At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that pa rticles themselves came in and out of existence bas ed solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense, her desire to see a p article . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg had hinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamental principle of N oetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: “Living c onsciousness somehow is the influence that turns th e possibility of something into something real . The most essential ingredient in creating our uni verse is the consciousness that observes it.” The most astonishing aspect of Katherine’s work, ho wever, had been the realization that the mind’ s ability to affect the physical world could be augmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation, harnessing the true power of “thought” required practice. More important . . . some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history, there had been those few who had become t rue masters. This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism. Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughts turned back to him, she f elt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab’s research library and peered in. Empty. The library was a small reading room—two Morris cha irs, a wooden table, two floor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundred bo oks. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings on everything from particle ph ysics to ancient mysticism. Their collection had gr own into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting- edge and historical. Most of Katherine’ s books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness, The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother’s bore older, more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters, and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum. “ The key to our scientific future, ” her brother often said, “ is hidden in our past. ” A lifelong scholar of"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been the first to encourage Katherine to boost her universi ty science education with an understanding of early He rmetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years old when Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancient mysticism. “So tell me, Kate,” her brother had asked while she was home on vacation during her sophomore year at Yale. “What are Elis reading these days in theoreti cal physics?” Katherine had stood in her family’s book-filled lib rary and recited her demanding reading list. “Impressive,” her brother replied. “Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are modern geniuses. But are you readi ng anything older?” Katherine scratched her head. “You mean like . . . Newton?” He smiled. “Keep going.” At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name for himself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kind of playful intellectual sparring. Older than Newton? Katherine’s head now filled with distant names lik e Ptolemy, Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore. Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cra cked leather bindings and old dusty tomes. “The sci entific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modern physics is only now beginning to comprehend it all.” “Peter,” she said, “ you already told me that the Egyptians understood l evers and pulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par wit h modern chemistry, but so what? Today’s physics deals with concepts that would have been unimaginable to the ancients.” “Like what?” “Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!” Subatomic research had now proven catego rically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in a sing le unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. “You’re telling me the ancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?” “Absolutely!” Peter said, pushing his long, dark ba ngs out of his eyes. “Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old as history i tself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man’ s oldest spiritual quest was to perceive his own entanglemen t, to sense his own interconnection with all things . He has always wanted to become ‘one’ with the universe . . . to achieve the state of ‘at-one-ment.’ ” Her brother raised his eyebrows. “To this day, Jews and Christi ans still strive for ‘atonement’ . . . although mos t of us have forgotten it is actually ‘at-one-ment’ we’re s eeking.” Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so well versed in history. “ Okay, but you’re talking in generalities. I’m talking specific physics.” “Then be specific.” His keen eyes challenged her now. “Okay, how about something as simple as polarity —the positive/negative balance of the subatomic rea lm. Obviously, the ancients didn’t underst—” “Hold on!” Her brother pulled down a large dusty te xt, which he dropped loudly on the library table. “Modern polarity is nothing but the ‘dual world’ de scribed by Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over t wo thousand years ago. A dozen other books in here, in cluding the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and the opposing forces in nature.” Katherine was skeptical. “Okay, but if we talk abou t modern discoveries in subatomics —the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example—” “Then we must look here, ” Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf and pulling out another text. “The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as the Upan ishads. ” He dropped the tome heavily on the first."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"“ Heisenberg and Schrödinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formul ate some of their theories.” The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on the desk grew taller and t aller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands in frustration . “Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edge theoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Kri shna or Vyasa had much to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmo logical models.” “You’re right. They didn’t.” Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. “If you’re talking superst ring theory . . .” He wandered over to the bookshelf yet again. “Then you’re talking this book here.” He heaved out a colossal leather-bound book and dropped it wi th a crash onto the desk. “Thirteenth-century trans lation of the original medieval Aramaic.” “Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!” Ka therine wasn’t buying it. “Come on!” Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological mod el. Based on the most recent scientific observation s, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made up not of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted like vibrating strings, similar to reson ating violin strings. Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the boo k, ran through the ornately printed table of conten ts, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of the bo ok. “Read this.” He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams. Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translat ion was old-fashioned and very hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearly outl ined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory—a ten- dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, she suddenly gasped and recoiled. “My God, it even describes how six of the dimensions are entangled and act as one ?!” She took a frightened step backward. “What is this book?!” Her brother grinned. “Something I’m hoping you’ll r ead one day.” He flipped back to the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words. The Complete Zohar. Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamental text of early Jewi sh mysticism, once believed so potent that it was rese rved only for the most erudite rabbis. Katherine eyed the book. “You’re saying the early m ystics knew their universe had ten dimensions?” “Absolutely.” He motioned to the page’s illustratio n of ten intertwined circles called Sephiroth. “Obv iously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics is ve ry advanced.” Katherine didn’t know how to respond. “But . . . th en why don’t more people study this?” Her brother smiled. “They will .” “I don’t understand.” “Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Human beings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turning their eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in books like the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Pow erful truth has its own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. The re will come a day when modern science begins in ea rnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . . that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questions that still elude him.” That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her bro ther’s ancient texts and quickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profound scientific wisdom. Today’s science was not so much making “ discoveries ” as it was making “ rediscoveries. ” Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true natur e of the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten. Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine’s mission in life— to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancien ts. It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was her conviction that t he world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever. At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother’s white lab coat hanging on its hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check for messages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memo ry. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend that endu res for centuries . . . endures for a reason. “No,” Katherine said aloud. “It can’t possibly be r eal.” Sometimes a legend was just that—a legend. CHAPTER 16 Security chief Trent Anderson stormed back toward the Capitol Rot unda, fuming at the failure of his security team. One of his men had just found a slin g and an army-surplus jacket in an alcove near the east portico. The goddamn guy walked right out of here! Anderson had already assigned teams to start scanni ng exterior video, but by the time they found anyth ing, this guy would be long gone. Now, as Anderson entered the Rotunda to survey the damage, he saw that the situation had been containe d as well as could be expected. All four entrances to th e Rotunda were closed with as inconspicuous a metho d of crowd control as Security had at its disposal—a vel vet swag, an apologetic guard, and a sign that read THIS ROOM TEMPORARILY CLOSED FOR CLEANING . The dozen or so witnesses were all being herded into a group on the eastern perimeter of the room, where the guards were collecting cell phones and ca meras; the last thing Anderson needed was for one of these people to send a cell-phone snapshot to CNN. One of the detained witnesses, a tall, dark-haired man in a tweed sport coat, was trying to break away from the group to speak to the chief. The man was curren tly in a heated discussion with the guards. “I’ll speak to him in a moment,” Anderson called ov er to the guards. “For now, please hold everyone in the main lobby until we sort this out.” Anderson turned his eyes now to the hand, which sto od at attention in the middle of the room. For the love of God . In fifteen years on security detail for the Capit ol Building, he had seen some strange things. But n othing like this. Forensics had better get here fast and get this thi ng out of my building. Anderson moved closer, seeing that the bloody wrist had been skewered on a spiked wooden base to make the hand stand up. Wood and flesh, he thought. Invisible to metal detectors. The only metal was a large gold ring, which Anderson assumed had either been wanded or casually pulled off the dead finger by the susp ect as if it were his own. "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Anderson crouched down to examine the hand. It look ed as if it had belonged to a man of about sixty. T he ring bore some kind of ornate seal with a two-heade d bird and the number 33. Anderson didn’t recognize it. What really caught his eye were the tiny tattoos on the tips of the thumb and index finger. A goddamn freak show. “Chief?” One of the guards hurried over, holding ou t a phone. “Personal call for you. Security switchbo ard just patched it through. ” Anderson looked at him like he was insane. “I’m in the middle of something here,” he growled. The guard’s face was pale. He covered the mouthpiec e and whispered. “It’s CIA.” Anderson did a double take. CIA heard about this already?! “It’s their Office of Security.” Anderson stiffened. Holy shit. He glanced uneasily at the phone in the guard’s ha nd. In Washington’s vast ocean of intelligence agencies , the CIA’s Office of Security was something of a Bermuda Triangle—a mysterious and treacherous regio n from which all who knew of it steered clear whenever possible. With a seemingly self-destructiv e mandate, the OS had been created by the CIA for o ne strange purpose—to spy on the CIA itself. Like a po werful internal-affairs office, the OS monitored al l CIA employees for illicit behavior: misappropriation of funds, selling of secrets, stealing classified tec hnologies, and use of illegal torture tactics, to name a few. They spy on America’s spies. With investigative carte blanche in all matters of national security, the OS had a long and potent rea ch. Anderson could not fathom why they would be interes ted in this incident at the Capitol, or how they ha d found out so fast. Then again, the OS was rumored t o have eyes everywhere . For all Anderson knew, they had a direct feed of U.S. Capitol security cameras. This incident did not match OS directives in any w ay, although the timing of the call seemed too coincide ntal to Anderson to be about anything other than th is severed hand. “Chief?”The guard was holding the phone out to him like a hot potato. “You need to take this call righ t now. It’s . . .” He paused and silently mouthed two syll ables. “SA-TO.” Anderson squinted hard at the man. You’ve got to be kidding. He felt his palms begin to sweat. Sato is handling this personally? The overlord of the Office of Security—Director Ino ue Sato—was a legend in the intelligence community. Born inside the fences of a Japanese internment cam p in Manzanar, California, in the aftermath of Pear l Harbor, Sato was a toughened survivor who had never forgotten the horrors of war, or the perils of insufficient military intelligence. Now, having ris en to one of the most secretive and potent posts in U.S. intelligence work, Sato had proven an uncompromisin g patriot as well as a terrifying enemy to any who stood in opposition. Seldom seen but universally fe ared, the OS director cruised the deep waters of th e CIA like a leviathan who surfaced only to devour its pr ey. Anderson had met Sato face-to-face only once, and t he memory of looking into those cold black eyes was enough to make him count his blessings that he woul d be having this conversation by telephone. Anderson took the phone and brought it to his lips. “Director Sato,” he said in as friendly a voice as possible. “This is Chief Anderson. How may I—” “There is a man in your building to whom I need to speak immediately.” The OS director’s voice was unmistakable—like gravel grating on a chalkboard. T hroat cancer surgery had left Sato with a profoundl y unnerving intonation and a repulsive neck scar to m atch. “ I want you to find him for me immediately. ”"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" That’s all? You want me to page someone? Anderson felt suddenly hopeful that maybe the timi ng of this call was pure coincidence. “Who are you looking for?” “His name is Robert Langdon. I believe he is inside your building right now.” Langdon? The name sounded vaguely familiar, but Anderson co uldn’t quite place it. He was now wondering if Sato knew about the hand. “I’m in the Rotunda at the moment,” Anderson said, “but we’ve got some tourists here . . . hold on.” He lowered his phone and called out to the group, “Folks, is there anyon e here by the name of Langdon?” After a short silence, a deep voice replied from th e crowd of tourists. “Yes. I’m Robert Langdon.” Sato knows all. Anderson craned his neck, trying to see who had sp oken up. The same man who had been trying to get to him earl ier stepped away from the others. He looked distrau ght . . . but familiar somehow. Anderson raised the phone to his lips. “Yes, Mr. La ngdon is here.” “Put him on,” Sato said coarsely. Anderson exhaled. Better him than me. “Hold on.” He waved Langdon over. As Langdon appro ached, Anderson suddenly realized why the name sounded fam iliar. I just read an article about this guy. What the hell is he doing here? Despite Langdon’s six-foot frame and athletic build , Anderson saw none of the cold, hardened edge he expected from a man famous for surviving an explosi on at the Vatican and a manhunt in Paris. This guy eluded the French police . . . in loafers? He looked more like someone Anderson would expect to find hearthside in some Ivy League library reading Dosto yevsky. “Mr. Langdon?”Anderson said, walking halfway to mee t him. “I’m Chief Anderson. I handle security here. You have a phone call.” “For me ?” Langdon’s blue eyes looked anxious and uncertain . Anderson held out the phone. “It’s the CIA’s Office of Security.” “I’ve never heard of it.” Anderson smiled ominously. “Well, sir, it’s heard of you .” Langdon put the phone to his ear. “Yes?” “Robert Langdon?” Director Sato’s harsh voice blare d in the tiny speaker, loud enough that Anderson co uld hear. “Yes?” Langdon replied. Anderson stepped closer to hear what Sato was sayin g. “This is Director Inoue Sato, Mr. Langdon. I am han dling a crisis at the moment, and I believe you hav e information that can help me.” Langdon looked hopeful. “Is this about Peter Solomo n? Do you know where he is?!” Peter Solomon? Anderson felt entirely out of the loop. "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"“ Professor, ” Sato replied. “ I am asking the questions at the moment. ” “Peter Solomon is in very serious trouble,” Langdon exclaimed. “Some madman just—” “Excuse me,” Sato said, cutting him off. Anderson cringed. Bad move. Interrupting a top CIA official’s line of question ing was a mistake only a civilian would make. I thought Langdon was supposed to be smart. “Listen carefully,” Sato said. “As we speak, this n ation is facing a crisis. I have been advised that you have information that can help me avert it. Now, I am go ing to ask you again. What information do you posse ss?” Langdon looked lost. “Director, I have no idea what you’re talking about. All I’m concerned with is fi nding Peter and—” “No idea?” Sato challenged. Anderson saw Langdon bristle. The professor now too k a more aggressive tone. “No, sir. No damned idea at all.” Anderson winced. Wrong . Wrong. Wrong. Robert Langdon had just made a very costly mistake in dealing with Director Sato. Incredibly, Anderson now realized it was too late. To his astonishment, Director Sato had just appeare d on the far side of the Rotunda, and was approaching fa st behind Langdon. Sato is in the building! Anderson held his breath and braced for impact. Langdon has no idea . The director’s dark form drew closer, phone held to ear, black eyes locked like two lasers on Langdon’ s back. Langdon clutched the police chief’s phone and felt a rising frustration as the OS director pressed him . “I’m sorry, sir,” Langdon said tersely, “but I can’t rea d your mind. What do you want from me?” “What do I want from you?” The OS director’s gratin g voice crackled through Langdon’s phone, scraping and hollow, like that of a dying man with strep thr oat. As the man spoke, Langdon felt a tap on his shoulde r. He turned and his eyes were drawn down . . . dir ectly into the face of a tiny Japanese woman. She had a f ierce expression, a mottled complexion, thinning ha ir, tobacco-stained teeth, and an unsettling white scar that sliced horizontally across her neck. The woma n’s gnarled hand held a cell phone to her ear, and when her lips moved, Langdon heard the familiar raspy v oice through his cell phone. “What do I want from you, Professor?” She calmly cl osed her phone and glared at him. “ For starters, you can stop calling me ‘sir.’ ” Langdon stared, mortified. “Ma’am, I . . . apologiz e. Our connection was poor and—” “Our connection was fine, Professor,” she said. “An d I have an extremely low tolerance for bullshit.” CHAPTER 17 Director Inoue Sato was a fearsome specimen—a bristly tempest of a wom an who stood a mere four feet ten inches. She was bone thin, with jagged features and a dermatological condition known as vitiligo, which"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"gave her complexion the mottled look of coarse gran ite blotched with lichen. Her rumpled blue pantsuit hung on her emaciated frame like a loose sack, the open- necked blouse doing nothing to hide the scar across her neck. It had been noted by her coworkers that Sato’ s only acquiescence to physical vanity appeared to be that of plucking her substantial mustache. For over a decade, Inoue Sato had overseen the CIA’ s Office of Security. She possessed an off-the-char t IQ and chillingly accurate instincts, a combination wh ich girded her with a self-confidence that made her terrifying to anyone who could not perform the impo ssible. Not even a terminal diagnosis of aggressive throat cancer had knocked her from her perch. The b attle had cost her one month of work, half her voic e box, and a third of her body weight, but she returned to the office as if nothing had happened. Inoue Sato appeared to be indestructible. Robert Langdon suspected he was probably not the fi rst to mistake Sato for a man on the phone, but the director was still glaring at him with simmering bl ack eyes. “Again, my apologies, ma’am,” Langdon said. “I’m st ill trying to get my bearings here—the person who claims to have Peter Solomon tricked me into coming to D.C. this evening.” He pulled the fax from his jacket. “This is what he sent me earlier. I wrote down the tail number of the plane he sent, so maybe if you call the FAA and track the—” Sato’s tiny hand shot out and snatched the sheet of paper. She stuck it in her pocket without even ope ning it. “Professor, I am running this investigation, and un til you start telling me what I want to know, I sug gest you not speak unless spoken to.” Sato now spun to the police chief. “Chief Anderson,” she said, stepping entirely too c lose and staring up at him through tiny black eyes, “ would you care to tell me what the hell is going on here? The guard at the east gate told me you found a hum an hand on the floor. Is that true?” Anderson stepped to the side and revealed the objec t in the center of the floor. “Yes, ma’am, only a f ew minutes ago.” She glanced at the hand as if it were nothing more than a misplaced piece of clothing. “And yet you di dn’t mention it to me when I called?” “I . . . I thought you knew.” “Do not lie to me.” Anderson wilted under her gaze, but his voice remai ned confident. “Ma’am, this situation is under cont rol.” “I really doubt that,” Sato said, with equal confid ence. “A forensics team is on the way. Whoever did this m ay have left fingerprints.” Sato looked skeptical. “I think someone clever enou gh to walk through your security checkpoint with a human hand is probably clever enough not to leave f ingerprints.” “That may be true, but I have a responsibility to i nvestigate.” “Actually, I am relieving you of your responsibilit y as of this moment. I’m taking over.” Anderson stiffened. “This is not exactly OS domain, is it?” “Absolutely. This is an issue of national security. ” Peter ’ s hand? Langdon wondered, watching their exchange in a daz e. National security? Langdon was"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"sensing that his own urgent goal of finding Peter w as not Sato ’ s. The OS director seemed to be on another page entirely. Anderson looked puzzled as well. “National security ? With all due respect, ma’am—” “The last I checked,” she interrupted, “I outrank y ou. I suggest you do exactly as I say, and that you do it without question.” Anderson nodded and swallowed hard. “But shouldn’t we at least print the fingers to confirm the hand belongs to Peter Solomon?” “I’ll confirm it,” Langdon said, feeling a sickenin g certainty. “I recognize his ring . . . and his ha nd.” He paused. “The tattoos are new, though. Someone did t hat to him recently.” “I’m sorry?” Sato looked unnerved for the first tim e since arriving. “The hand is tattooed ?” Langdon nodded. “The thumb has a crown. And the ind ex finger a star.” Sato pulled out a pair of glasses and walked toward the hand, circling like a shark. “Also,” Langdon said, “although you can’t see the o ther three fingers, I’m certain they will have tatt oos on the fingertips as well.” Sato looked intrigued by the comment and motioned t o Anderson. “ Chief, can you look at the other fingertips for us, please?” Anderson crouched down beside the hand, being caref ul not to touch it. He put his cheek near the floor and looked up under the clenched fingertips. “He’s righ t, ma’am. All of the fingertips have tattoos, altho ugh I can’t quite see what the other—” “A sun, a lantern, and a key,” Langdon said flatly. Sato turned fully to Langdon now, her small eyes ap praising him. “And how exactly would you know that? ” Langdon stared back. “The image of a human hand, ma rked in this way on the fingertips, is a very old i con. It’s known as ‘the Hand of the Mysteries.’ ” Anderson stood up abruptly. “This thing has a name ?” Langdon nodded. “It’s one of the most secretive ico ns of the ancient world.” Sato cocked her head. “Then might I ask what the he ll it’s doing in the middle of the U.S. Capitol?” Langdon wished he would wake up from this nightmare . “Traditionally, ma’am, it was used as an invitati on.” “An invitation . . . to what?” she demanded. Langdon looked down at the symbols on his friend’s severed hand. “For centuries, the Hand of the Myster ies served as a mystical summons. Basically, it’s an in vitation to receive secret knowledge—protected wisd om known only to an elite few.” Sato folded her thin arms and stared up at him with jet-black eyes. “ Well, Professor, for someone who claims to have no clue why he’s here . . . you’re doing qu ite well so far.” "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 Katherine Solomon donned her white lab coat and began her usual arri val routine—her “rounds” as her brother called them. Like a nervous parent checking on a sleeping baby, Katherine poked her head into the mechanical room. The hydrogen fuel cell was running smoothly, its backup tanks all safely nestled in their racks. Katherine continued down the hall to the data-stora ge room. As always, the two redundant holographic backup units hummed safely within their temperature -controlled vault. All of my research, she thought, gazing in through the three-inch-thick shatterproof glass. Holographic data-storage devices, unlike th eir refrigerator-size ancestors, looked more like sleek stereo components, each perched atop a columnar pedestal. Both of her lab’s holographic drives were synchroni zed and identical—serving as redundant backups to safeguard identical copies of her work. Most backup protocols advocated a secondary backup system off-site in case of earthquake, fire, or theft, but Katherin e and her brother agreed that secrecy was paramount ; once this data left the building to an off-site server, they could no longer be certain it would stay priva te. Content that everything was running smoothly here, she headed back down the hallway. As she rounded th e corner, however, she spotted something unexpected a cross the lab. What in the world? A muted glow was glinting off all the equipment. She hurried in to h ave a look, surprised to see light emanating from b ehind the Plexiglas wall of the control room. He ’s here. Katherine flew across the lab, arriving at the con trol-room door and heaving it open. “Peter!” she said, running in. The plump woman seated at the con trol room’s terminal jumped up. “Oh my God! Katherine! You scared me!” Trish Dunne—the only other person on earth allowed back here—was Katherine’s metasystems analyst and seldom worked weekends. The twenty-six-year-old red head was a genius data modeler and had signed a nondisclosure document worthy of the KGB. Tonight, she was apparently analyzing data on the control room’s plasma wall—a huge flat-screen display that looked like something out of NASA mission control. “Sorry,” Trish said. “I didn’t know you were here y et. I was trying to finish up before you and your b rother arrived.” “Have you spoken to him? He’s late and he’s not ans wering his phone.” Trish shook her head. “I bet he’s still trying to f igure out how to use that new iPhone you gave him.” Katherine appreciated Trish’s good humor, and Trish ’s presence here had just given her an idea. “Actua lly, I’m glad you’re in tonight. You might be able to he lp me with something, if you don’t mind?” “Whatever it is, I’m sure it beats football.” Katherine took a deep breath, calming her mind. “I’ m not sure how to explain this, but earlier today, I heard an unusual story . . .” Trish Dunne didn’t know what story Katherine Solomo n had heard, but clearly it had her on edge. Her bo ss’ s usually calm gray eyes looked anxious, and she had tucked her hair behind her ears three times since e ntering the room—a nervous “tell, ” as Trish called it. Brilliant scientist. Lousy poker player. “To me,” Katherine said, “this story sounds like fic tion . . . an old legend. And yet . . .” She paused, tucking a wisp of hair behind her ears once again. "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"“ And yet? ” Katherine sighed. “And yet I was told today by a tr usted source that the legend is true.” “Okay . . .” Where is she going with this? “I’m going to talk to my brother about it, but it o ccurs to me that maybe you can help me shed some li ght on it before I do. I’d love to know if this legend has ever been corroborated anywhere else in history.” “In all of history?” Katherine nodded. “Anywhere in the world, in any la nguage, at any point in history.” Strange request, Trish thought, but certainly feasible. Ten years ago, the task would have been impossible . Today, however, with the Internet, the World Wide W eb, and the ongoing digitization of the great libra ries and museums in the world, Katherine’s goal could be achieved by using a relatively simple search engin e equipped with an army of translation modules and so me well-chosen keywords. “No problem,” Trish said. Many of the lab’s researc h books contained passages in ancient languages, an d so Trish was often asked to write specialized Optical Character Recognition translation modules to genera te English text from obscure languages. She had to be the only metasystems specialist on earth who had bu ilt OCR translation modules in Old Frisian, Maek, and A kkadian. The modules would help, but the trick to building a n effective search spider was all in choosing the r ight key words . Unique but not overly restrictive. Katherine looked to be a step ahead of Trish and wa s already jotting down possible keywords on a slip of paper. Katherine had written down several when she paused, thought a moment, and then wrote several mo re. “Okay,” she finally said, handing Trish the slip of paper. Trish perused the list of search strings, and her e yes grew wide. What kind of crazy legend is Katherine investigating? “You want me to search for all of these key phrases?” One of the words Trish didn ’t even recognize. Is that even English? “Do you really think we’ll find all of these in on e place? Verbatim?” “I’d like to try.” Trish would have said impossible, but the I-word was banned here. Katherine consider ed it a dangerous mind-set in a field that often transformed preconce ived falsehoods into confirmed truths. Trish Dunne seriously doubted this key-phrase search would fall into that category. “How long for results?” Katherine asked. “A few minutes to write the spider and launch it. A fter that, maybe fifteen for the spider to exhaust itself.” “So fast?” Katherine looked encouraged. Trish nodded. Traditional search engines often requ ired a full day to crawl across the entire online u niverse, find new documents, digest their content, and add i t to their searchable database. But this was not th e kind of search spider Trish would write. “I’ll write a program called a delegator, ” Trish explained. “It’s not entirely kosher, but i t’s fast. Essentially, it’s a program that orders other people’s search en gines to do our work. Most databases have a search function built in—libraries, museums, universities, governments. So I write a spider that finds their search engines, inputs your keywords, and asks them to sea rch. This way, we harness the power of thousands of engines, working in unison.” Katherine looked impressed. “Parallel processing.” "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"A kind of metasystem. “ I ’ ll call you if I get anything. ” “I appreciate it,Trish.” Katherine patted her on th e back and headed for the door. “I’ll be in the libr ary.” Trish settled in to write the program. Coding a sea rch spider was a menial task far below her skill le vel, but Trish Dunne didn’t care. She would do anything for Katherine Solomon. Sometimes Trish still couldn’t believe the good fortune that had brought her here. You’ve come a long way, baby. Just over a year ago, Trish had quit her job as a m etasystems analyst in one of the high-tech industry ’s many cubicle farms. In her off-hours, she did some freel ance programming and started an industry blog—“Futu re Applications in Computational Metasystem Analysis”— although she doubted anyone read it. Then one evening her phone rang. “Trish Dunne?” a woman’s voice asked politely. “Yes, who’s calling, please?” “My name is Katherine Solomon.” Trish almost fainted on the spot. Katherine Solomon? “I just read your book— Noetic Science: Modern Gateway to Ancient Wisdom—and I wrote about it on my blog!” “Yes, I know,” the woman replied graciously. “That’ s why I’m calling.” Of course it is, Trish realized, feeling dumb. Even brilliant scientists Google themselves. “Your blog intrigues me,” Katherine told her. “I was n’t aware metasystems modeling had come so far.” “Yes, ma’am,” Trish managed, starstruck. “Data mode ls are an exploding technology with far-reaching applications.” For several minutes, the two women chatted about Tr ish’s work in metasystems, discussing her experienc e analyzing, modeling, and predicting the flow of mas sive data fields. “Obviously, your book is way over my head,” Trish s aid, “but I understood enough to see an intersectio n with my metasystems work.” “Your blog said you believe metasystems modeling ca n transform the study of Noetics?” “Absolutely. I believe metasystems could turn Noeti cs into real science . ” “ Real science?” Katherine’s tone hardened slightly. “As o pposed to . . . ?” Oh shit, that came out wrong. “Um, what I meant is that Noetics is more . . . es oteric.” Katherine laughed. “Relax, I’m kidding. I get that all the time.” I ’m not surprised, Trish thought . Even the Institute of Noetic Sciences in Californi a described the field in arcane and abstruse language, defining it as the st udy of mankind’s “direct and immediate access to knowledge beyond what is available to our normal se nses and the power of reason.” The word noetic, Trish had learned, derived from the ancient Greek nous —translating roughly to “inner knowledge” or “intuitive consciousness.” “I’m interested in your metasystems work,” Katherin e said, “and how it might relate to a project I’ m working on. Any chance you ’ d be willing to meet? I ’ d love to pick your brain. ”"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" Katherine Solomon wants to pick my brain? It felt like Maria Sharapova had called for tennis tips. The next day a white Volvo pulled into Trish’s driv eway and an attractive, willowy woman in blue jeans got out. Trish immediately felt two feet tall. Great, she groaned. Smart, rich, and thin—and I’m supposed to believe God is good? But Katherine’s unassuming air set Trish instantly at ease. The two of them settled in on Trish’s huge back por ch overlooking an impressive piece of property. “Your house is amazing,” Katherine said. “Thanks. I got lucky in college and licensed some s oftware I’d written.” “Metasystems stuff?” “ A precursor to metasystems. Following 9/11, the gov ernment was intercepting and crunching enormous dat a fields—civilian e-mail, cell phone, fax, text, Web sites—sniffing for keywords associated with terrori st communications. So I wrote a piece of software that let them process their data field in a second way . . . pulling from it an additional intelligence product. ” She smiled. “Essentially, my software let them ta ke America’s temperature.” “I’m sorry?” Trish laughed. “Yeah, sounds crazy, I know. What I mean is that it quantified the nation’s emotional state. It offered a kind of cosmic consciousness barometer, i f you will.” Trish explained how, using a data field of the nation’s communications, one could assess the natio n’s mood based on the “occurrence density” of certain keywords and emotional indicators in the data field . Happier times had happier language, and stressful times vice versa. In the event, for example, of a terrori st attack, the government could use data fields to measure the shift in America’s psyche and better advise the president on the emotional impact of the event. “Fascinating,” Katherine said, stroking her chin. “ So essentially you’re examining a population of individuals . . . as if it were a single organism.” “Exactly. A metasystem . A single entity defined by the sum of its parts. The human body, for example, consists of millions of individual cells, each with different attributes and different purposes, but i t functions as a single entity.” Katherine nodded enthusiastically. “Like a flock of birds or a school of fish moving as one. We call i t convergence or entanglement.” Trish sensed her famous guest was starting to see t he potential of metasystem programming in her own f ield of Noetics. “My software,” Trish explained, “was de signed to help government agencies better evaluate and respond appropriately to wide-scale crises—pandemic diseases, national tragedies, terrorism, that sort of thing.” She paused. “Of course, there’s always the potential that it could be used in other directions . . . perhaps to take a snapshot of the national mind-set and predict the outcome of a national election or the direction the stock market will move at the opening bell.” “Sounds powerful.” Trish motioned to her big house. “The government thought so.” Katherine’s gray eyes focused in on her now. “Trish , might I ask about the ethical dilemma posed by your work?” “What do you mean?” “I mean you created a piece of software that can ea sily be abused. Those who possess it have access to powerful information not available to everyone. You didn ’ t feel any hesitation creating it? ”"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" Trish didn’t blink. “Absolutely not. My software is no different than say . . . a flight simulator pro gram. Some users will practice flying first-aid missions into underdeveloped countries. Some users will prac tice flying passenger jets into skyscrapers. Knowledge i s a tool, and like all tools, its impact is in the hands of the user.” Katherine sat back, looking impressed. “So let me a sk you a hypothetical question.” Trish suddenly sensed their conversation had just t urned into a job interview. Katherine reached down and picked up a tiny speck o f sand off the deck, holding it up for Trish to see . “It occurs to me,” she said, “that your metasystems work essentially lets you calculate the weight of an en tire sandy beach . . . by weighing one grain at a time.” “Yes, basically that’s right.” “As you know, this little grain of sand has mass . A very small mass, but mass nonetheless.” Trish nodded. “And because this grain of sand has mass, it therefore exerts gravity . Again, too small to feel, but there.” “Right.” “Now,” Katherine said, “if we take trillions of thes e sand grains and let them attract one another to f orm . . . say, the moon, then their combined gravity is enough to move enti re oceans and drag the tides back and forth across our planet.” Trish had no idea where this was headed, but she li ked what she was hearing. “So let’s take a hypothetical,” Katherine said, dis carding the sand grain. “What if I told you that a thought . . . any tiny idea that forms in your mind . . . actua lly has mass ? What if I told you that a thought is an actual thing, a measurable entity, with a measurable mass? A min uscule mass, of course, but mass nonetheless. What are the implications?” “Hypothetically speaking ? Well, the obvious implications are . . . if a thou ght has mass, then a thought exerts gravity and can pull things toward it.” Katherine smiled. “You’re good. Now take it a step further. What happens if many people start focusing on the same thought? All the occurrences of that same thought begin to merge into one, and the cumulative mass of this thought begins to grow. And therefore, its gravity grows.” “Okay.” “Meaning . . . if enough people begin thinking the same thing, then the gravitational force of that th ought becomes tangible . . . and it exerts actual force.” Katherine winked. “And it can have a measurable eff ect in our physical world.” CHAPTER 19 Director Inoue Sato stood with her arms folded, her eyes locked skepti cally on Langdon as she processed"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"what he had just told her. “ He said he wants you to unlock an ancient portal? W hat am I supposed to do with that, Professor?” Langdon shrugged weakly. He was feeling ill again a nd tried not to look down at his friend’s severed h and. “That’s exactly what he told me. An ancient portal . . . hidden somewhere in this building. I told him I knew of no portal.” “Then why does he think you can find it?” “Obviously, he’s insane.” He said Peter would point the way. Langdon looked down at Peter’s upstretched finger, again feeling repulsed by his captor’s sadi stic play on words. Peter will point the way. Langdon had already permitted his eyes to follow the pointing f inger up to the dome overhead. A portal? Up there? Insane. “This man who called me,” Langdon told Sato, “was t he only one who knew I was coming to the Capitol tonight, so whoever informed you I was here tonight, that’s your man. I recommend—” “Where I got my information is not your concern,” S ato interrupted, voice sharpening. “ My top priority at the moment is to cooperate with this man, and I have in formation suggesting you are the only one who can give him what he wants.” “And my top priority is to find my friend,” Langdon replie d, frustrated. Sato inhaled deeply, her patience clearly being tes ted. “If we want to find Mr. Solomon, we have one c ourse of action, Professor—to start cooperating with the one person who seems to know where he is.” Sato checked her watch. “Our time is limited. I can assure you i t is imperative we comply with this man’s demands quickly.” “How?” Langdon asked, incredulous. “By locating and unlocking an ancient portal? There is no portal, Director Sato. This guy’s a lunatic.” Sato stepped close, less than a foot from Langdon. “If I may point this out . . . your lunatic deftly manipulated two fairly smart individuals already th is morning.” She stared directly at Langdon and then glanced at Anderson. “In my business, one learns th ere is a fine line between insanity and genius. We would be wise to give this man a little respect.” “He cut off a man’s hand!” “My point exactly. That is hardly the act of an unc ommitted or uncertain individual. More important, Professor, this man obviously believes you can help him. He brought you all the way to Washington— and he must have done it for a reason.” “He said the only reason he thinks I can unlock thi s ‘portal’ is that Peter told him I can unlock it,” Langdon countered. “And why would Peter Solomon say that if it weren’t true?” “I’m sure Peter said no such thing. And if he did, then he did so under duress. He was confused . . . or frightened.” “Yes. It’s called interrogational torture, and it’s quite effective. All the more reason Mr. Solomon w ould tell the truth.” Sato spoke as if she’d had personal exp erience with this technique. “Did he explain why Peter thinks you alone can unlock the portal?” Langdon shook his head. “Professor, if your reputations are correct, then y ou and Peter Solomon both share an interest in this sort of thing — secrets, historical esoterica, mysticism, and so on . In all of your discussions with Peter, he never o nce"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"mentioned to you anything about a secret portal in Washington, D.C.? ” Langdon could scarcely believe he was being asked t his question by a high-ranking officer of the CIA. “I’m certain of it. Peter and I talk about some pretty a rcane things, but believe me, I’d tell him to get h is head examined if he ever told me there was an ancient po rtal hidden anywhere at all. Particularly one that leads to the Ancient Mysteries.” She glanced up. “I’m sorry? The man told you specifically what this portal leads to?” “Yes, but he didn’t have to.” Langdon motioned to t he hand. “The Hand of the Mysteries is a formal invitation to pass through a mystical gateway and a cquire ancient secret knowledge—powerful wisdom known as the Ancient Mysteries . . . or the lost wi sdom of all the ages.” “So you’ve heard of the secret he believes is hidden here.” “A lot of historians have heard of it.” “Then how can you say the portal does not exist?” “With respect, ma’am, we’ve all heard of the Founta in of Youth and Shangri-la, but that does not mean they exist.” The loud squawk of Anderson’s radio interrupted the m. “Chief?” the voice on the radio said. Anderson snatched his radio from his belt. “Anderso n here.” “Sir, we’ve completed a search of the grounds. Ther e’s no one here that fits the description. Any furt her orders, sir?” Anderson shot a quick glance at Sato, clearly expec ting a reprimand, but Director Sato seemed unintere sted. Anderson moved away from Langdon and Sato, speaking quietly into his radio. Sato’s unwavering focus remained on Langdon. “You’re saying the secret he believes is hidden in Washington . . . is a fantasy ?” Langdon nodded. “A very old myth. The secret of the Ancient Mysteries is pre-Christian, actually. Thousands of years old.” “And yet it’s still around?” “As are many equally improbable beliefs.” Langdon o ften reminded his students that most modern religio ns included stories that did not hold up to scientific scrutiny: everything from Moses parting the Red Se a . . . to Joseph Smith using magic eyeglasses to translate th e Book of Mormon from a series of gold plates he fo und buried in upstate New York. Wide acceptance of an idea is not proof of its vali dity. “I see. So what exactly are these . . . Ancient Mysteries?” Langdon exhaled. Have you got a few weeks? “In short, the Ancient Mysteries refer to a body o f secret knowledge that was amassed long ago. One intriguing aspect of this knowledge is that it allegedly enab les its practitioners to access powerful abilities that lie dormant in the human mind. The enlightened Adepts who possessed this knowledge vowed to keep it veiled fr om the masses because it was considered far too pot ent and dangerous for the uninitiated.” “Dangerous in what way?” “ The information was kept hidden for the same reason we keep matches from children. In the correct hand s,"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"fire can provide illumination . . . but in the wron g hands, fire can be highly destructive. ” Sato took off her glasses and studied him. “Tell me , Professor, do you believe such powerful informati on could truly exist?” Langdon was not sure how to respond. The Ancient My steries had always been the greatest paradox of his academic career. Virtually every mystical tradition on earth revolved around the idea that there exist ed arcane knowledge capable of imbuing humans with mys tical, almost godlike, powers: tarot and I Ching gave men the ability to see the future; alchemy gave men immortality through the fabled Philosopher’s Stone ; Wicca permitted advanced practitioners to cast powe rful spells. The list went on and on. As an academic, Langdon could not deny the historic al record of these traditions—troves of documents, artifacts, and artwork that, indeed, clearly sugges ted the ancients had a powerful wisdom that they sh ared only through allegory, myths, and symbols, ensuring that only those properly initiated could access it s power. Nonetheless, as a realist and a skeptic, Langdon re mained unconvinced. “Let’s just say I’m a skeptic,” he told Sato. “I hav e never seen anything in the real world to suggest the Ancient Mysteries are anything other than legend— a recurring mythological archetype. It seems to me that if it were possible for humans to acquire miraculous powers, there wou ld be evidence. And yet, so far, history has given us no men with superhuman powers.” Sato arched her eyebrows. “That’s not entirely true .” Langdon hesitated, realizing that for many religiou s people, there was indeed a precedent for human go ds, Jesus being the most obvious. “Admittedly,” he said , “there are plenty of educated people who believe this empowering wisdom truly exists, but I’m not yet con vinced.” “Is Peter Solomon one of those people?” Sato asked, glancing toward the hand on the floor. Langdon could not bring himself to look at the hand . “Peter comes from a family lineage that has alway s had a passion for all things ancient and mystical.” “Was that a yes?” Sato asked. “I can assure you that even if Peter believes the A ncient Mysteries are real, he does not believe they are accessible through some kind of portal hidden in Wa shington, D.C. He understands metaphorical symbolis m, which is something his captor apparently does not.” Sato nodded. “So you believe this portal is a metaphor .” “Of course,” Langdon said. “In theory, anyway. It’s a very common metaphor—a mystical portal through which one must travel to become enlightened. Portal s and doorways are common symbolic constructs that represent transformative rites of passage. To look for a literal portal would be like trying to locate the actual Gates of Heaven.” Sato seemed to consider this momentarily. “But it s ounds like Mr. Solomon’ s captor believes you can unlock an actual portal.” Langdon exhaled. “He’s made the same error many zea lots make—confusing metaphor with a literal reality .” Similarly, early alchemists had toiled in vain to t ransform lead into gold, never realizing that lead- to-gold was nothing but a metaphor for tapping into true hu man potential—that of taking a dull, ignorant mind and transforming it into a bright, enlightened one. Sato motioned to the hand. “If this man wants you t o locate some kind of portal for him, why wouldn’t he simply tell you how to find it? Why all the dramatics? Why giv e you a tattooed hand?” Langdon had asked himself the same question and the answer was unsettling. “ Well, it seems the man we are dealing with, in addition to being mentally unstabl e, is also highly educated. This hand is proof that he is well"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"versed in the Mysteries as well as their codes of s ecrecy. Not to mention with the history of this roo m. ” “I don’t understand.” “Everything he has done tonight was done in perfect accordance with ancient protocols. Traditionally, the Hand of the Mysteries is a sacred invitation, and t herefore it must be presented in a sacred place.” Sato’s eyes narrowed. “ This is the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol Building, P rofessor, not some sacred shrine to ancient mystical secrets.” “Actually, ma’am,” Langdon said, “I know a great nu mber of historians who would disagree with you.” At that moment, across town, Trish Dunne was seated in the glow of the plasma wall inside the Cube. Sh e finished preparing her search spider and typed in t he five key phrases Katherine had given her. Here goes nothing. Feeling little optimism, she launched the spider, e ffectively commencing a worldwide game of Go Fish. At blinding speed, the phrases were now being compared to texts all over the world . . . looking for a pe rfect match. Trish couldn’t help but wonder what this was all ab out, but she had come to accept that working with t he Solomons meant never quite knowing the entire story . CHAPTER 20 Robert Langdon stole an anxious glance at his wristwatch: 7:58 P. M. The smiling face of Mickey Mouse did little to cheer him up. I’ve got to find Peter. We’re wasting time. Sato had stepped aside for a moment to take a phone call, but now she returned to Langdon. “Professor, am I keeping you from something?” “No, ma’am,” Langdon said, pulling his sleeve down over his watch. “I’m just extremely concerned about Peter.” “I can understand, but I assure you the best thing you can do to help Peter is to help me understand t he mind- set of his captor.” Langdon was not so sure, but he sensed he was not g oing anywhere until the OS director got the informa tion she desired. “A moment ago,” Sato said, “you suggested this Rotun da is somehow sacred to the idea of these Ancient Mysteries?” “Yes, ma’am.” “Explain that to me.” Langdon knew he would have to choose his words spar ingly. He had taught for entire semesters on the mystical symbolism of Washington, D.C., and there w as an almost inexhaustible list of mystical referen ces in this building alone."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" America has a hidden past. Every time Langdon lectured on the symbology of Ame rica, his students were confounded to learn that th e true intentions of our nation’s forefathers had absolut ely nothing to do with what so many politicians now claimed. America ’s intended destiny has been lost to history. The forefathers who founded this capital city first named her “Rome.” They had named her river the Tibe r and erected a classical capital of pantheons and te mples, all adorned with images of history’s great g ods and goddesses—Apollo, Minerva, Venus, Helios, Vulcan, J upiter. In her center, as in many of the great clas sical cities, the founders had erected an enduring tribut e to the ancients— the Egyptian obelisk. This obelisk, larger even than Cairo’s or Alexandria’ s, rose 555 feet into the sky, more than thirty sto ries, proclaiming thanks and honor to the demigod forefather for whom this capit al city took its newer name. Washington. Now, centuries later, despite America ’s separation of church and state, this state-spons ored Rotunda glistened with ancient religious symbolism. There w ere over a dozen different gods in the Rotunda—more than the original Pantheon in Rome. Of course, the Roman Pantheon had been converted to Christianity i n 609 . . . but this pantheon was never converted; vestiges of its true history still remained in plain view. “As you may know,” Langdon said, “this Rotunda was designed as a tribute to one of Rome’ s most venerated mystical shrines. The Temple of Vesta.” “As in the vestal virgins?” Sato looked doubtful th at Rome’s virginal guardians of the flame had anyth ing to do with the U.S. Capitol Building. “The Temple of Vesta in Rome,” Langdon said, “ was circular, with a gaping hole in the floor, thro ugh which the sacred fire of enlightenment could be tended by a sisterhood of virgins whose job it was to ensure the flame never went out.” Sato shrugged. “This Rotunda is a circle, but I see no gaping hole in this floor.” “No, not anymore, but for years the center of this room had a large opening precisely where Peter’s ha nd is now.” Langdon motioned to the floor. “In fact, you c an still see the marks in the floor from the railin g that kept people from falling in.” “What?” Sato demanded, scrutinizing the floor. “I’v e never heard that.” “Looks like he’s right.” Anderson pointed out the c ircle of iron nubs where the posts had once been. “ I’ve seen these before, but I never had any idea why the y were there.” You’re not alone, Langdon thought, imagining the thousands of people every day, including famous lawmakers, who strode across the center of the Rotu nda having no idea there was once a day when they would have plunged down into the Capitol Crypt—the level beneath the Rotunda floor. “The hole in the floor,” Langdon told them, “ was eventually covered, but for a good while, those who visited the Rotunda could see straight down to the fire tha t burned below.” Sato turned. “Fire? In the U.S. Capitol?” “More of a large torch, actually—an eternal flame t hat burned in the crypt directly beneath us. It was supposed to be visible through the hole in the floo r, making this room a modern Temple of Vesta. This building even had its own vestal virgin—a federal e mployee called the Keeper of the Crypt—who successfully kept the flame burning for fifty years , until politics, religion, and smoke damage snuffe d out the idea. ”"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" Both Anderson and Sato looked surprised. Nowadays, the only reminder that a flame once burne d here was the four -pointed star compass embedded in the crypt floor one story below them—a symbol of Am erica’s eternal flame, which once shed illumination toward the four corners of the New World. “So, Professor,” Sato said, “your contention is that the man who left Peter’s hand here knew all this?” “Clearly. And much, much more. There are symbols al l over this room that reflect a belief in the Ancie nt Mysteries.” “Secret wisdom,” Sato said with more than a hint of sarcasm in her voice. “Knowledge that lets men acq uire godlike powers?” “Yes, ma’am.” “That hardly fits with the Christian underpinnings of this country.” “So it would seem, but it’s true. This transformati on of man into God is called apotheosis. Whether or not you’re aware of it, this theme—transforming man int o god—is the core element in this Rotunda’s symbolism.” “Apotheosis?” Anderson spun with a startled look of recognition. “Yes.” Anderson works here. He knows. “The word apotheosis literally means ‘divine transformation’—that of man becoming God. It’s from the ancient Greek: apo —‘to become,’ theos —‘god.’ ” Anderson looked amazed. “ Apotheosis means ‘to become God’? I had no idea.” “What am I missing?” Sato demanded. “Ma’am,” Langdon said, “the largest painting in thi s building is called The Apotheosis of Washington. And it clearly depicts George Washington being transformed into a god.” Sato looked doubtful. “I’ve never seen anything of the sort.” “Actually, I’m sure you have .” Langdon raised his index finger, pointing straig ht up. “It’s directly over your head.” CHAPTER 21 The Apotheosis of Washington —a 4,664-square-foot fresco that covers the canopy of the Capitol Rotunda— was completed in 1865 by Constantino Brumidi. Known as “The Michelangelo of the Capitol,” Brumidi had laid claim to the Capitol Rotunda in the same way Michelangelo had laid claim to the Sistine Chap el, by painting a fresco on the room’s most lofty canvas—the ceiling. Like Michelangelo, Brumidi had done some of his finest work inside the Vatican. Brumidi, however, immigrated to America in 1852, ab andoning God’ s largest shrine in favor of a new shrine, the U.S. Capitol, which now glistened with examples of his mastery—from the trompe l’oeil of the Brumi di Corridors to the frieze ceiling of the Vice Preside nt ’ s Room. And yet it was the enormous image hovering"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"above the Capitol Rotunda that most historians cons idered to be Brumidi ’ s masterwork. Robert Langdon gazed up at the massive fresco that covered the ceiling. He usually enjoyed his student s’ startled reactions to this fresco’s bizarre imagery , but at the moment he simply felt trapped in a nig htmare he had yet to understand. Director Sato was standing next to him with her han ds on her hips, frowning up at the distant ceiling. Langdon sensed she was having the same reaction man y had when they first stopped to examine the painti ng at the core of their nation. Utter confusion. You’re not alone, Langdon thought. For most people, The Apotheosis of Washington got stranger and stranger the longer they looked at it. “That’s Geor ge Washington on the central panel,” Langdon said, pointing 180 feet upward into the middle of the dom e. “As you can see, he’s dressed in white robes, at tended by thirteen maidens, and ascending on a cloud above mortal man. This is the moment of his apotheosis . . . his transformation into a god.” Sato and Anderson said nothing. “Nearby,” Langdon continued, “you can see a strange, anachronistic series of figures: ancient gods presenting our forefathers with advanced knowledge. There’ s Minerva giving technological inspiration to our nation’s great inventors—Ben Franklin, Robert Fulto n, Samuel Morse.” Langdon pointed them out one by one. “And over there is Vulcan helping us build a s team engine. Beside them is Neptune demonstrating h ow to lay the transatlantic cable. Beside that is Cere s, goddess of grain and root of our word cereal; she’s sitting on the McCormick reaper, the farming breakthrough t hat enabled this country to become a world leader i n food production. The painting quite overtly portray s our forefathers receiving great wisdom from the g ods.” He lowered his head, looking at Sato now. “Knowledg e is power, and the right knowledge lets man perform miraculous, almost godlike tasks.” Sato dropped her gaze back down to Langdon and rubb ed her neck. “Laying a phone cable is a far cry fro m being a god.” “Perhaps to a modern man,” Langdon replied. “But if George Washington k new that we had become a race that possessed the power to speak to one another ac ross oceans, fly at the speed of sound, and set foo t on our moon, he would assume that we had become gods, capa ble of miraculous tasks.” He paused. “ In the words of futurist Arthur C. Clarke, ‘Any sufficiently advanc ed technology is indistinguishable from magic.’ ” Sato pursed her lips, apparently deep in thought. S he glanced down at the hand, and then followed the direction of the outstretched index finger up into the dome. “Professor, you were told, ‘Peter will po int the way.’ Is that correct?” “Yes, ma’am, but—” “Chief,” Sato said, turning away from Langdon, “can you get us a closer look at the painting?” Anderson nodded. “There’s a catwalk around the inte rior of the dome.” Langdon looked way, way up to th e tiny railing visible just beneath the painting and felt his body go rigid. “There’s no need to go up t here.” He had experienced that seldom-visited catwalk once be fore, as the guest of a U.S. senator and his wife, and he had almost fainted from the dizzying height and per ilous walkway. “No need?” Sato demanded. “Professor, we have a man who believes this room contains a portal that has the potential to make him a god; we have a ceiling fres co that symbolizes the transformation of a man into a god; and we have a hand pointing straight at that painti ng. It seems everything is urging us upward. ” “Actually,” Anderson interjected, glancing up, “not many people know this, but there is one hexagonal coffer in the dome that actually swings open like a portal , and you can peer down through it and—” "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"“ Wait a second, ” Langdon said, “ you ’ re missing the point. The portal this man is lookin g for is a figurative portal—a gateway that doesn’t exist. When he said, ‘Peter will point the way,’ he was talking in metaphorical terms. This pointing-hand gesture—with its index fi nger and thumb extended upward—is a well-known symbol of the Ancient Mysteries, and it appears all over the world in ancient art. This same gesture a ppears in three of Leonardo da Vinci’s most famous encoded masterpieces— The Last Supper, Adoration of the Magi, and Saint John the Baptist. It’s a symbol of man’s mystical connection to God. ” As above, so below. The madman’s bizarre choice of words was starting t o feel more relevant now. “I’ve never seen it before,” Sato said. Then watch ESPN, Langdon thought, always amused to see professional athletes point skyward in gratitude to God after a touchdown or home run. He wondered h ow many knew they were continuing a pre-Christian mystical tradition of acknowledging the mystical po wer above, which, for one brief moment, had transformed them into a god capable of miraculous f eats. “If it’s of any help,” Langdon said, “Peter’s hand is not the first such hand to make an appearance in this Rotunda.” Sato eyed him like he was insane. “I beg your pardo n?” Langdon motioned to her BlackBerry. “Google ‘George Washington Zeus.’ ” Sato looked uncertain but started typing. Anderson inched toward her, looking over her shoulder intent ly. Langdon said, “This Rotunda was once dominated by a massive sculpture of a bare-chested George Washington . . . depicted as a god. He sat in the s ame exact pose as Zeus in the Pantheon, bare chest exposed, left hand holding a sword, right hand raised with t humb and finger extended.” Sato had apparently found an online image, because Anderson was staring at her BlackBerry in shock. “ Hold on, that’s George Washington?” “Yes,” Langdon said. “Depicted as Zeus.” “Look at his hand,” Anderson said, still peering ove r Sato’s shoulder. “His right hand is in the same e xact position as Mr. Solomon’s.” As I said, Langdon thought, Peter’s hand is not the first to make an appearance in this room. When Horatio Greenough’s statue of a naked George Washington was first unveiled in the Rotunda, many joked that Washington must be reaching skyward in a desperate attempt to find some clothes. As American religious ideals changed, however, the joking criticism turne d to controversy, and the statue was removed, banis hed to a shed in the east garden. Currently, it made its h ome at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of America n History, where those who saw it had no reason to su spect that it was one of the last vestigial links t o a time when the father of the country had watched over the U.S. Capitol as a god . . . like Zeus watching ove r the Pantheon. Sato began dialing a number on her BlackBerry, appa rently seeing this as an opportune moment to check in with her staff. “What have you got?” She listened p atiently. “I see . . .” She glanced directly at Langdon, then at Peter’s hand. “You’re certain?” She listened a m oment longer. “Okay, thanks.” She hung up and turne d back toward Langdon. “My support staff did some res earch and confirms the existence of your so-called Hand of the Mysteries, corroborating everything you said: five fingertip markings— the star, the sun, the key, the crown, and the lantern—as well as the fact that this hand served as an ancient invitation to learn secret wisdom.” “I’m glad,” Langdon said. “Don’t be,” she replied curtly. “It appears we’re n ow at a dead end until you share whatever it is you ’re still not telling me.” "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"“ Ma ’ am? ” Sato stepped toward him. “We’ve come full circle, P rofessor. You’ve told me nothing I could not have learned from my own staff. And so I will ask you on ce more. Why were you brought here tonight? What makes you so special? What is it that you alone know?” “We’ve been through this,” Langdon fired back. “I d on’t know why this guy thinks I know anything at al l!” Langdon was half tempted to demand how the hell Sato knew that he was in the Capitol tonight, but they’ d been through that, too. Sato isn’t talking. “If I knew the next step,” he told her, “I’d tell you. But I don’t. Traditionally, the Hand of the Mysteries is extende d by a teacher to a student. And then, shortly afte rward, the hand is followed up with a set of instructions . . . directions to a temple, the name of the maste r who will teach you— something ! But all this guy left for us is five tattoos! Har dly—” Langdon stopped short. Sato eyed him. “What is it?” Langdon’s eyes shot back to the hand. Five tattoos. He now realized that what he was saying might not be entirely true. “Professor?” Sato pressed. Langdon inched toward the gruesome object. Peter will point the way. “Earlier, it crossed my mind that maybe this guy ha d left an object clenched in Peter’s palm—a map, or a letter, or a set of directions.” “He didn’t,” Anderson said. “As you can see, those three fingers are not clenched tightly.” “You’re right,” Langdon said. “But it occurs to me . . .” He crouched down now, trying to see up under the fingers to the hidden part of Peter’s palm. “Maybe it’s not written on paper.” “Tattooed?” Anderson said. Langdon nodded. “Do you see anything on the palm?” Sato asked. Langdon crouched lower, trying to peer up under the loosely clenched fingers. “The angle is impossible . I can’t—” “Oh, for heaven’s sake,” Sato said, moving toward h im. “Just open the damned thing!” Anderson stepped in front of her. “Ma’am! We should really wait for forensics before we touch—” “I want some answers,” Sato said, pushing past him. She crouched down, edging Langdon away from the hand. Langdon stood up and watched in disbelief as Sato p ulled a pen from her pocket, sliding it carefully u nder the three clenched fingers. Then, one by one, she p ried each finger upward until the hand stood fully open, with its palm visible. She glanced up at Langdon, and a thin smile spread across her face. “Right again, Professor.” "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22 Pacing the library, Katherine Solomon pulled back the sleeve of her lab coat and checked her watch. She was not a woman accustomed to waiting, but at the m oment, she felt as if her whole world were on hold. She was waiting for Trish’s search-spider results, she was waiting for word from her brother, and also, sh e was waiting for a callback from the man who was respons ible for this entire troubling situation. I wish he hadn ’t told me, she thought. Normally, Katherine was extremely car eful about making new acquaintances, and although she had met this man fo r the first time only this afternoon, he had earned her trust in a matter of minutes. Completely . His call had come this afternoon while Katherine wa s at home enjoying her usual Sunday-afternoon pleas ure of catching up on the week’s scientific journals. “Ms. Solomon?” an unusually airy voice had said. “M y name is Dr. Christopher Abaddon. I was hoping I might speak to you for a moment about your brother? ” “I’m sorry, who is this?” she had demanded. And how did you get my private cell-phone number? “Dr. Christopher Abaddon?” Katherine did not recognize the name. The man cleared his throat, as if the situation had just become awkward. “I apologize, Ms. Solomon. I was under the impression your brother had told you abou t me. I’m his doctor. Your cell number was listed a s his emergency contact.” Katherine’s heart skipped. Emergency contact? “Is something wrong?” “No . . . I don’t think so,” the man said. “Your br other missed an appointment this morning, and I can ’ t reach him on any of his numbers. He never misses appointm ents without calling, and I’m just a little worried . I hesitated to phone you, but—” “No, no, not at all, I appreciate the concern.” Kat herine was still trying to place the doctor’s name. “I haven’ t spoken to my brother since yesterday morning, but h e probably just forgot to turn on his cell.” Katheri ne had recently given him a new iPhone, and he still hadn’ t taken the time to figure out how to use it. “You say you’re his doctor ?” she asked. Does Peter have an illness he’s keeping from me? There was a weighty pause on the line. “I’m terribl y sorry, but I’ve obviously just made a rather seri ous professional error by calling you. Your brother tol d me you were aware of his visits to me, but now I see that’s not the case.” My brother lied to his doctor? Katherine’s concern was now growing steadily. “Is he sick?” “I’m sorry, Ms. Solomon, doctor-patient confidentia lity precludes me from discussing your brother’s condition, and I’ve already said too much by admitt ing he is my patient. I’ m going to hang up now, but if you hear from him today, please ask him to call me so I know he’s okay.” “Wait!” Katherine said. “Please tell me what’s wron g with Peter!” Dr. Abaddon exhaled, sounding displeased with his m istake. “Ms. Solomon, I can hear you’re upset, and I don’t blame you. I’m sure your brother is fine. He was in my office just yesterday.” “ Yesterday? And he ’ s scheduled again today ? This sounds urgent. ”"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" The man heaved a sigh. “I suggest we give him a lit tle more time before we—” “I’m coming by your office right now,” Katherine sa id, heading for the door. “Where are you located?” Silence. “Dr. Christopher Abaddon?” Katherine said. “I can l ook up your address myself, or you can simply give it to me. Either way, I’m coming over.” The doctor paused. “If I meet with you, Ms. Solomon , would you please do me the courtesy of saying nothing to your brother until I’ve had a chance to explain my misstep?” “That’s fine.” “Thank you. My office is in Kalorama Heights.” He ga ve her an address. Twenty minutes later, Katherine Solomon was navigat ing the stately streets of Kalorama Heights. She ha d phoned all of her brother’s numbers with no reply. She did not feel overly concerned about her brother ’s whereabouts, and yet, the news that he was secretly seeing a doctor . . . was troubling. When Katherine finally located the address, she sta red up at the building in confusion. This is a doctor’s office? The opulent mansion before her had a wrought-iron s ecurity fence, electronic cameras, and lush grounds . As she slowed to double-check the address, one of the security cameras rotated toward her, and the gate s wung open. Tentatively, Katherine drove up the driveway and parked next to a six-car garage and a stretch l imo. What kind of doctor is this guy? As she got out of her car, the front door of the ma nsion opened, and an elegant figure drifted out ont o the landing. He was handsome, exceptionally tall, and y ounger than she had imagined. Even so, he projected the sophistication and polish of an older man. He was i mpeccably dressed in a dark suit and tie, and his t hick blond hair was immaculately coiffed. “Ms. Solomon, I’m Dr. Christopher Abaddon,” he said, his voice a breathy whisper. When they sho ok hands, his skin felt smooth and well tended. “Katherine Solomon,” she said, trying not to stare at his skin, which was unusually smooth and bronzed . Is he wearing makeup? Katherine felt a growing disquiet as she stepped in to the home’s beautifully appointed foyer. Classica l music played softly in the background, and it smelled as if someone had burned incense. “This is lovely,” sh e said, “although I expected more of . . . an office.” “I’m fortunate to work out of my home.” The man led her into a living room, where there was a cracklin g fire. “Please make yourself comfortable. I’m just s teeping some tea. I’ll bring it out, and we can tal k.” He strode toward the kitchen and disappeared. Katherine Solomon did not sit. Female intuition was a potent instinct that she had learned to trust, a nd something about this place was making her skin craw l. She saw nothing that looked anything like any doctor’s office she had ever seen. The walls of thi s antique-adorned living room were covered with cla ssical art, primarily paintings with strange mythical them es. She paused before a large canvas depicting the Three Graces, whose nude bodies were spectacularly render ed in vivid colors. “That’s the original Michael Parkes oil.” Dr. Abadd on appeared without warning beside her, holding a t ray of steaming tea. “I thought we’d sit by the fire?” He led her over to the living room and offered her a seat. “ There ’ s no reason to be nervous. ”"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" “I’m not nervous,” Katherine said entirely too quic kly. He gave her a reassuring smile. “Actually, it is my business to know when people are nervous.” “I beg your pardon?” “I’m a practicing psychiatrist, Ms. Solomon. That i s my profession. I’ve been seeing your brother for almost a year now. I’m his therapist.” Katherine could only stare. My brother is in therapy? “Patients often choose to keep their therapy to the mselves,” the man said. “I made a mistake by callin g you, although in my defense, your brother did mislead me .” “I . . . I had no idea.” “I apologize if I made you nervous,” he said, sound ing embarrassed. “I noticed you studying my face wh en we met, and yes, I do wear makeup.” He touched his own cheek, looking self-conscious. “I have a dermatological condition, which I prefer to hide. M y wife usually puts the makeup on for me, but when she’ s not here, I have to rely on my own heavy touch.” Katherine nodded, too embarrassed to speak. “And this lovely hair . . .” He touched his lush bl ond mane. “A wig. My skin condition affected my sca lp follicles as well, and all my hair jumped ship.” He shrugged. “I’m afraid my one sin is vanity.” “Apparently mine is rudeness,” Katherine said. “Not at all.” Dr. Abaddon’s smile was disarming. “S hall we start over? Perhaps with some tea?” They sat in front of the fire and Abaddon poured te a. “Your brother got me in the habit of serving tea during our sessions. He said the Solomons are tea drinkers .” “Family tradition,” Katherine said. “Black, please. ” They sipped their tea and made small talk for a few minutes, but Katherine was eager for information a bout her brother. “Why was my brother coming to you?” sh e asked. And why didn’t he tell me? Admittedly, Peter had endured more than his fair share of tragedy in his life—losing his father at a young age, and then , within a span of five years, burying his only son and then his mother. Even so, Peter had always found a way to cope. Dr. Abaddon took a sip of tea. “Your brother came t o me because he trusts me. We have a bond beyond th at of normal patient and doctor.” He motioned to a fra med document near the fireplace. It looked like a diploma, until Katherine spied the double-headed ph oenix. “You’re a Mason?” The highest degree, no less. “Peter and I are brothers of sorts.” “You must have done something important to be invit ed into the thirty-third degree.” “Not really,” he said. “I have family money, and I give a lot of money to Masonic charities.” Katherine now realized why her brother trusted this young doctor. A Mason with family money, interested in philanthropy and ancient mythology? Dr. Abaddon had more in common with her brother tha n she had initially imagined."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" “When I asked why my brother came to you,” she said, “I didn’t mean why did he choose you. I meant, why is he seeking the services of a psychiatrist?” Dr. Abaddon smiled. “Yes, I know. I was trying to s idestep the question politely. It’s really not some thing I should be discussing.” He paused. “Although I must say I’m puzzled that your brother would keep our discussions from you, considering that they relate so directly to your research.” “My research?” Katherine said, taken totally off gu ard. My brother talks about my research? “Recently, your brother came to me looking for a pr ofessional opinion about the psychological impact o f the breakthroughs you are making in your lab.” Katherine almost choked on the tea. “Really? I’m . . . surprised,” she managed. What is Peter thinking? He told his shrink about my work?! Their security protocol involved not discussing wi th anyone what Katherine was working on. Moreover, the confidentiality had b een her brother’s idea. “Certainly you are aware, Ms. Solomon, that your br other is deeply concerned about what will happen wh en your research goes public. He sees the potential fo r a significant philosophical shift in the world . . . and he came here to discuss the possible ramifications . . . from a psychological perspective.” “I see,” Katherine said, her teacup now shaking sli ghtly. “The questions we discuss are challenging ones: Wha t happens to the human condition if the great myste ries of life are finally revealed? What happens when tho se beliefs that we accept on faith . . . are suddenly categorically proven as fact ? Or disproved as myth ? One could argue that there exist certain question s that are best left unanswered.” Katherine could not believe what she was hearing, a nd yet she kept her emotions in check. “I hope you don’t mind, Dr. Abaddon, but I’d prefer not to discuss th e details of my work. I have no immediate plans to make anything public. For the time being, my discoveries will remain safely locked in my lab.” “Interesting.” Abaddon leaned back in his chair, lo st in thought for a moment. “In any event, I asked y our brother to come back today because yesterday he suf fered a bit of a break . When that happens, I like to have clients—” “Break?” Katherine’s heart was pounding. “ As in breakdown?” She couldn’t imagine her brother b reaking down over anything. Abaddon reached out kindly. “Please, I can see I’ve upset you. I’m sorry. Considering these awkward circumstances, I can understand how you might feel entitled to answers.” “Whether I’m entitled or not,” Katherine said, “ my brother is all I have left of my family. Nobody knows him better than I do, so if you tell me what the hell h appened, maybe I can help you. We all want the same thing—what’s best for Peter.” Dr. Abaddon fell silent for several long moments an d then began slowly nodding as if Katherine might h ave a point. Finally, he spoke. “For the record, Ms. So lomon, if I decide to share this information with y ou, I would do so only because I think your insights migh t help me assist your brother.” “Of course.” Abaddon leaned forward, putting his elbows on his k nees. “Ms. Solomon, as long as I’ve been seeing you r brother, I’ve sensed in him a deep struggle with fe elings of guilt. I’ve never pressed him on it becau se that’s not why he comes to me. And yet yesterday, for a nu mber of reasons, I finally asked him about it.” Aba ddon locked eyes with her. “Your brother opened up, rath er dramatically and unexpectedly. He told me things I had not expected to hear . . . including everything that happened the night your mother died.” "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Christmas Eve — almost exactly ten years ago. She died in my arms. “He told me your mother was murdered during a robbe ry attempt at your home? A man broke in looking for something he believed your brother was hiding?” “That’s correct.” Abaddon’s eyes were appraising her. “Your brother s aid he shot the man dead?” “Yes.” Abaddon stroked his chin. “Do you recall what the i ntruder was looking for when he broke into your hom e?” Katherine had tried in vain for ten years to block out the memory. “Yes, his demand was very specific. Unfortunately, none of us knew what he was talking about. His demand never made sense to any of us.” “Well, it made sense to your brother.” “What?” Katherine sat up. “At least according to the story he told me yesterd ay, Peter knew exactly what the intruder was lookin g for. And yet your brother did not want to hand it over, so he pretended not to understand.” “That’s absurd. Peter couldn’t possibly have known what the man wanted. His demands made no sense!” “Interesting.” Dr. Abaddon paused and took a few no tes. “As I mentioned, however, Peter told me he did know. Your brother believes if he had only cooperat ed with the intruder, maybe your mother would be al ive today. This decision is the source of all his guilt .” Katherine shook her head. “That’s crazy . . .” Abaddon slumped, looking troubled. “Ms. Solomon, th is has been useful feedback. As I feared, your brot her seems to have had a little break with reality. I mu st admit, I was afraid this might be the case. That ’s why I asked him to come back today. These delusional epis odes are not uncommon when they relate to traumatic memories.” Katherine shook her head again. “Peter is far from delusional, Dr. Abaddon.” “I would agree, except . . .” “Except what ?” “Except that his recounting of the attack was just the beginning . . . a tiny fraction of the long and far-fetched tale he told me.” Katherine leaned forward in her seat. “What did Pet er tell you?” Abaddon gave a sad smile. “Ms. Solomon, let me ask you this. Has your brother ever discussed with you what he believes is hidden here in Washington, D.C. . . . or the role he believes he plays in protecti ng a great treasure . . . of lost ancient wisdom?” Katherine’s jaw fell open. “What in the world are y ou talking about?” Dr. Abaddon heaved a long sigh. “What I am about to tell you will be a bit shocking, Katherine.” He pa used and locked eyes with her. “But it will be immeasura bly helpful if you can tell me anything you may know about it.” He reached for her cup. “More tea?” "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 23 Another tattoo. Langdon crouched anxiously beside Peter’s open palm and examined the seven tiny symbols that had been hidden beneath the lifeless clenched fingers. “They appear to be numbers,” Langdon said, surprise d. “Although I don’t recognize them.” “The first is a Roman numeral,” Anderson said. “Actually, I don’t think so,” Langdon corrected. “T he Roman numeral I-I-I-X doesn’t exist. It would be written V-I-I.” “How about the rest of it?” Sato asked. “I’m not sure. It looks like eight-eight-five in Ar abic numbers.” “Arabic?” Anderson asked. “They look like normal numbers.” “Our normal numbers are Arabic.” Langdon had become so accustomed to clari fying this point for his students that he’d actually prepared a lecture abou t the scientific advances made by early Middle East ern cultures, one of them being our modern numbering sy stem, whose advantages over Roman numerals included ‘positional notation’ and the invention of the number zero. Of course, Langdon always ended t his lecture with a reminder that Arab culture had also given mankind the word al-kuhl —the favorite beverage of Harvard freshmen—known as alcohol . Langdon scrutinized the tattoo, feeling puzzled. “A nd I’m not even sure about the eight-eight-five. Th e rectilinear writing looks unusual. Those may not be numbers.” “Then what are they? Sato asked. “I’m not sure. The whole tattoo looks almost . . . runic.” “Meaning?” Sato asked. “Runic alphabets are composed solely of straight li nes. Their letters are called runes and were often used for carving in stone because curves were too difficult to chisel.” “If these are runes,” Sato said, “what is their mea ning?” Langdon shook his head. His expertise extended only to the most rudimentary runic alphabet—Futhark—a third-century Teutonic system, and this was not Fut hark. “To be honest, I’m not even sure these are ru nes. You’d need to ask a specialist. There are dozens of different forms—Hälsinge, Manx, the ‘dotted’ Stungnar—” “ Peter Solomon is a Mason, is he not? ”"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" Langdon did a double take. “Yes, but what does that have to do with this?” He stood up now, towering o ver the tiny woman. “ You tell me. You just said that runic alphabets are us ed for stone carvings, and it is my understanding t hat the original Freemasons were stone craftsmen. I men tion this only because when I asked my office to se arch for a connection between the Hand of the Mysteries and Peter Solomon, their search returned one link i n particular.” She paused, as if to emphasize the imp ortance of her finding. “The Masons.” Langdon exhaled, fighting the impulse to tell Sato the same thing he constantly told his students: “Google” is not a synonym for “research.” In these days of massive, worldwide keyword search es, it seemed everything was linked to everything. The world was becoming one big entangled web of information that was getting denser every day. Langdon maintained a patient tone. “I’m not surpris ed the Masons appeared in your staff’s search. Maso ns are a very obvious link between Peter Solomon and a ny number of esoteric topics.” “Yes,” Sato said, “which is another reason I have b een surprised this evening that you have not yet mentioned the Masons. After all, you’ve been talkin g about secret wisdom protected by an enlightened f ew. That sounds very Masonic, does it not?” “It does . . . and it also sounds very Rosicrucian, Kabbalistic, Alumbradian, and any number of other esoteric groups.” “But Peter Solomon is a Mason—a very powerful Mason , at that. It seems the Masons would come to mind if we were talking about secrets. Heaven knows the Masons love their secrets.” Langdon could hear the distrust in her voice, and h e wanted no part of it. “If you want to know anythi ng about the Masons, you would be far better served to ask a Mason.” “Actually,” Sato said, “I’d prefer to ask someone I can trust.” Langdon found the comment both ignorant and offensi ve. “For the record, ma’am, the entire Masonic philosophy is bui lt on honesty and integrity. Masons are among the m ost trustworthy men you could ever hope to meet.” “I have seen persuasive evidence to the contrary.” Langdon was liking Director Sato less and less with each passing moment. He had spent years writing ab out the Masons’ rich tradition of metaphorical iconography and symb ols, and knew that Masons had always been one of the most unfairly maligned and misunderstood organizations in the world. Regularly accused of everything from devil worship to plotting a one-wor ld government, the Masons also had a policy of neve r responding to their critics, which made them an eas y target. “Regardless,” Sato said, her tone biting, “we are a gain at an impasse, Mr. Langdon. It seems to me the re is either something you are missing . . . or something you are not telling me. The man we’re dealing with said that Peter Solomon chose you specifically.” She lev eled a cold stare at Langdon. “I think it’s time we move this conversation to CIA headquarters. Maybe we’ll have more luck there.” Sato’s threat barely registered with Langdon. She h ad just said something that had lodged in his mind. Peter Solomon chose you . The comment, combined with the mention of Masons, had hit Langdon strangely. He looked down at the Masonic ring on Peter’s finger. The ring was one of Peter’s most prized possessions —a Solomon family heirloom that bore the symbol of the double-headed phoenix—the ultimate mystical icon o f Masonic wisdom. The gold glinted in the light, spar king an unexpected memory. Langdon gasped, recalling the eerie whisper of Pete r’s captor: It really hasn’t dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen? "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Now, in one terrifying moment, Langdon ’ s thoughts snapped into focus and the fog lifted. All at once, Langdon’s purpose here was crystal cle ar. Ten miles away, driving south on Suitland Parkway, Mal’akh heard a distinctive vibration on the seat b eside him. It was Peter Solomon’s iPhone, which had prove n a powerful tool today. The visual caller ID now displayed the image of an attractive middle-aged wo man with long black hair. INCOMING CALL—KATHERINE SOLOMON Mal’akh smiled, ignoring the call. Destiny pulls me closer. He had lured Katherine Solomon to his home this aft ernoon for one reason only—to determine if she had information that could assist him . . . perhaps a f amily secret that might help Mal’akh locate what he sought. Clearly, however, Katherine’s brother had told her nothing of what he had been guarding all these year s. Even so, Mal’akh had learned something else from Ka therine. Something that has earned her a few extra hours of life today. Katherine had confirmed for him that all of her re search was in one location, safely locked inside her lab. I must destroy it. Katherine’s research was poised to open a new door of understanding, and once the door was opened even a crack, others would follow. It would just be a matt er of time before everything changed. I cannot let that happen. The world must stay as it is . . . adrift i n ignorant darkness. The iPhone beeped, indicating Katherine had left a voice mail. Mal’akh retrieved it. “Peter, it’s me again.” Katherine’s voice sounded c oncerned. “Where are you? I’m still thinking about my conversation with Dr. Abaddon . . . and I’m worried . Is everything okay? Please call me. I’m at the la b.” The voice mail ended. Mal’akh smiled. Katherine should worry less about her brother, and more about herself. He turned off Suitland Parkway onto Silver Hill Road. Less than a mile later, in the darkness, he spotted the faint outline of the SMSC nestled in the trees off the highway to hi s right. The entire complex was surrounded by a hig h razor-wire fence. A secure building? Mal’akh chuckled to himself. I know someone who will open the door for me. CHAPTER 24 The revelation crashed over Langdon like a wave. I know why I am here. Standing in the center of the Rotunda, Langdon felt a powerful urge to turn and run away . . . from Pe ter’s hand, from the shining gold ring, from the suspicio us eyes of Sato and Anderson. Instead, he stood dea d still, clinging more tightly to the leather daybag that hu ng on his shoulder. I’ve got to get out of here. His jaw clenched as his memory began replaying the scene from that cold morning, years ago in Cambridg e."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"It was six A.M. and Langdon was entering his classr oom as he always did following his ritual morning l aps in the Harvard Pool. The familiar smells of chalk d ust and steam heat greeted him as he crossed the threshold. He took two steps toward his desk but st opped short. A figure was waiting there for him—an elegant gentl eman with an aquiline face and regal gray eyes. “Peter?” Langdon stared in shock. Peter Solomon’s smile flashed white in the dimly li t room. “Good morning, Robert. Surprised to see me? ” His voice was soft, and yet there was power there. Langdon hurried over and warmly shook his friend’s hand. “What in the world is a Yale blue blood doing on the Crimson campus before dawn?” “Covert mission behind enemy lines,” Solomon said, laughing. He motioned to Langdon’s trim waistline. “Laps are paying off. You’re in good shape.” “Just trying to make you feel old,” Langdon said, t oying with him. “It’s great to see you, Peter. What ’s up?” “Short business trip,” the man replied, glancing aro und the deserted classroom. “I’m sorry to drop in o n you like this, Robert, but I have only a few minutes. T here’s something I needed to ask you . . . in perso n. A favor.” That’s a first. Langdon wondered what a simple college professor c ould possibly do for the man who had everything. “Anything at all,” he replied, pleased for any opportunity to do something for someone who had given him so much, especially when Peter’s life of good fortune had also been marred by so much traged y. Solomon lowered his voice. “I was hoping you would consider looking after something for me.” Langdon rolled his eyes. “Not Hercules, I hope.” La ngdon had once agreed to take care of Solomon’s hundred-fifty-pound mastiff, Hercules, during Solom on’s travels. While at Langdon’s home, the dog apparently had become homesick for his favorite lea ther chew toy and had located a worthy substitute i n Langdon’s study—an original vellum, hand-calligraph ed, illuminated Bible from the 1600s. Somehow “bad dog” didn’t quite seem adequate. “You know, I’m still searching for a replacement,” Solomon said, smiling sheepishly. “Forget it. I’m glad Hercules got a taste of religi on.” Solomon chuckled but seemed distracted. “Robert, th e reason I came to see you is I’ d like you to keep an eye on something that is quite valuable to me. I inheri ted it a while back, but I’ m no longer comfortable leaving it in my home or in my office.” Langdon immediately felt uncomfortable. Anything “q uite valuable” in Peter Solomon’s world had to be worth an absolute fortune. “How about a safe-deposi t box?” Doesn’t your family have stock in half the banks in America? “That would involve paperwork and bank employees; I ’d prefer a trusted friend. And I know you can keep secrets.” Solomon reached in his pocket and pulled out a small package, handing it to Langdon. Considering the dramatic preamble, Langdon had expe cted something more impressive. The package was a small cube-shaped box, about three inches square, w rapped in faded brown packing paper and tied with twine. From the package’s heavy weight and size, it felt like its contents must be rock or metal. This is it? Langdon turned the box in his hands, now noticing t he twine had been carefully secured on one side wit h an embossed wax seal, like an ancient edict. The seal bore a double-headed phoenix with the number 33 emblazoned on its chest—the traditional symbol of t he highest degree of Freemasonry. “ Really, Peter, ” Langdon said, a lopsided grin creeping across his f ace. “ You ’ re the Worshipful Master of a"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Masonic lodge, not the pope. Sealing packages with your ring? ” Solomon glanced down at his gold ring and gave a ch uckle. “I didn’t seal this package, Robert. My grea t- grandfather did. Almost a century ago.” Langdon’s head snapped up. “What?!” Solomon held up his ring finger. “This Masonic ring was his. After that, it was my grandfather’s, then my father’s . . . and eventually mine.” Langdon held up the package. “Your great-grandfathe r wrapped this a century ago and nobody has opened it?” “That’s right.” “But . . . why not?” Solomon smiled. “Because it’s not time.” Langdon stared. “Time for what ?” “Robert, I know this will sound odd, but the less y ou know, the better. Just put this package somewher e safe, and please tell no one I gave it to you.” Langdon searched his mentor’s eyes for a glint of p layfulness. Solomon had a propensity for dramatics, and Langdon wondered if he wasn’t being played a bit he re. “Peter, are you sure this isn’t just a clever pl oy to make me think I’ve been entrusted with some kind of ancient Masonic secret so I’ll be curious and deci de to join? ” “The Masons do not recruit, Robert, you know that. Besides, you’ve already told me you’d prefer not to join. ” This was true. Langdon had great respect for Masoni c philosophy and symbolism, and yet he had decided never to be initiated; the order’s vows of secrecy would prevent him from discussing Freemasonry with his students. It had been for this same reason that Soc rates had refused to formally participate in the El eusinian Mysteries. As Langdon now regarded the mysterious little box a nd its Masonic seal, he could not help but ask the obvious question. “Why not entrust this to one of y our Masonic brothers?” “Let’s just say I have an instinct it would be safe r stored outside the brotherhood. And please don’t let the size of this package fool you. If what my father to ld me is correct, then it contains something of sub stantial power.” He paused. “A talisman, of sorts.” Did he say a talisman? By definition, a talisman was an object with magic al powers. Traditionally, talismans were used for bringing luck, warding off evil spiri ts, or aiding in ancient rituals. “Peter, you do realize that talismans went out of vogue in the Middle Ages, rig ht?” Peter laid a patient hand on Langdon’s shoulder. “I know how this sounds, Robert. I’ve known you a lon g time, and your skepticism is one of your greatest s trengths as an academic. It is also your greatest w eakness. I know you well enough to know you’re not a man I can ask to believe . . . only to trust . So now I am asking you to trust me when I tell you this talisman is po werful. I was told it can imbue its possessor with the ability to bring order from chaos.” Langdon could only stare. The idea of “order from c haos” was one of the great Masonic axioms. Ordo ab chao. Even so, the claim that a talisman could impart any power at all was absurd, much less the power to bring order from chaos. "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"“ This talisman, ” Solomon continued, “ would be dangerous in the wrong hands, and unfortun ately, I have reason to believe powerful people want to steal it from me.” His eyes were as serious as Langdon could ever recall. “I would like you to keep it safe for me fo r a while. Can you do that?” That night, Langdon sat alone at his kitchen table with the package and tried to imagine what could po ssibly be inside. In the end, he simply chalked it up to P eter’s eccentricity and locked the package in his l ibrary’s wall safe, eventually forgetting all about it. That was . . . until this morning. The phone call from the man with the southern accen t. “Oh, Professor, I almost forgot!” the assistant had said after giving Langdon the specifics of his tra vel arrangements to D.C. “There is one more thing Mr. S olomon requested.” “Yes?” Langdon replied, his mind already moving to the lecture he had just agreed to give. “Mr. Solomon left a note here for you.” The man beg an reading awkwardly, as if trying to decipher Pete r’s penmanship. “‘Please ask Robert . . . to bring . . . the small, sealed package I gave him many years a go.’ ” The man paused. “Does this make any sense to you?” Langdon felt surprised as he recalled the small box that had been sitting in his wall safe all this ti me. “Actually, yes. I know what Peter means.” “And you can bring it?” “Of course. Tell Peter I’ll bring it.” “Wonderful.” The assistant sounded relieved. “Enjoy your speech tonight. Safe travels.” Before leaving home, Langdon had dutifully retrieve d the wrapped package from the back of his safe and placed it in his shoulder bag. Now he was standing in the U.S. Capitol, feeling ce rtain of only one thing. Peter Solomon would be hor rified to know how badly Langdon had failed him. CHAPTER 25 My God, Katherine was right. As usual. Trish Dunne stared in amazement at the search-spide r results that were materializing on the plasma wal l before her. She had doubted the search would turn u p any results at all, but in fact, she now had over a do zen hits. And they were still coming in. One entry in particular looked quite promising. Trish turned and shouted in the direction of the li brary. “Katherine? I think you’ll want to see this! ” It had been a couple of years since Trish had run a search spider like this, and tonight’ s results astounded her. A few years ago, this search would have been a dead end. Now, however, it seemed that the quantity of searchable digital material in the world had explod ed to the point where someone could find literally"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"anything. Incredibly, one of the keywords was a wor d Trish had never even heard before . . . and the s earch even found that . Katherine rushed through the control-room door. “Wha t have you got?” “A bunch of candidates.” Trish motioned to the plasma wall. “Every one of these documents contains all of your key phrases verbatim.” Katherine tucked her hair behind her ear and scanne d the list. “Before you get too excited,” Trish added, “I can a ssure you that most of these documents are not what you’re looking for. They’re what we call black hole s. Look at the file sizes. Absolutely enormous. The y’re things like compressed archives of millions of e-ma ils, giant unabridged encyclopedia sets, global mes sage boards that have been running for years, and so for th. By virtue of their size and diverse content, th ese files contain so many potential keywords that they suck i n any search engine that comes anywhere near them.” Katherine pointed to one of the entries near the to p of the list. “How about that one?” Trish smiled. Katherine was a step ahead, having fo und the sole file on the list that had a small file size. “Good eyes. Yeah, that’s really our only candidate so far. In fact, that file’s so small it can’t be more than a page or so.” “Open it.” Katherine’s tone was intense. Trish could not imagine a one-page document contain ing all the strange search strings Katherine had provided. Nonetheless, when she clicked and opened the document, the key phrases were there . . . crys tal clear and easy to spot in the text. Katherine strode over, eyes riveted to the plasma w all. “This document is . . . redacted ?” Trish nodded. “Welcome to the world of digitized te xt.” Automatic redaction had become standard practice wh en offering digitized documents. Redaction was a process wherein a server allowed a user to search t he entire text, but then revealed only a small port ion of it—a teaser of sorts—only that text immediately fla nking the requested keywords. By omitting the vast majority of the text, the server avoided copyright infringement and also sent the user an intriguing m essage: I have the information you’re searching for, but if y ou want the rest of it, you’ll have to buy it from me. “As you can see,” Trish said, scrolling through the heavily abridged page, “ the document contains all of your key phrases.” Katherine stared up at the redaction in silence. Trish gave her a minute and then scrolled back to t he top of the page. Each of Katherine’s key phrases was underlined in capital letters and accompanied by a small sample of teaser text—the two words that appe ared on either side of the requested phrase. "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" Trish could not imagine what this document was refe rring to. And what the heck is a “symbolon”? Katherine stepped eagerly toward the screen. “Where did this document come from? Who wrote it?” Trish was already working on it. “Give me a second. I’m trying to chase down the source.” “ I need to know who wrote this, ” Katherine repeated, her voice intense. “ I need to see the rest of it. ”"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" “I’m trying,” Trish said, startled by the edge in K atherine’s tone. Strangely, the file’s location was not displaying a s a traditional Web address but rather as a numeric Internet Protocol address. “I can’t unmask the IP,” Trish sa id. “The domain name’s not coming up. Hold on.” She pulled up her terminal window. “I’ll run a tracerou te.” Trish typed the sequence of commands to ping all th e “hops” between her control room’s machine and whatever machine was storing this document. “Tracing now,” she said, executing the command. Traceroutes were extremely fast, and a long list of network devices appeared almost instantly on the p lasma wall. Trish scanned down . . . down . . . through t he path of routers and switches that connected her machine to . . . What the hell? Her trace had stopped before reaching the document ’s server. Her ping, for some reason, had hit a network device that swallowed it rather than bouncing it back. “It looks like my traceroute got blocked,” Trish said. Is that even possible? “Run it again.” Trish launched another traceroute and got the same result. “Nope. Dead end. It’s like this document is on a server that is untraceable.” She looked at the last few hops before the dead end. “I can tell you, though, it’s located somewhere in the D.C. area.” “You’re kidding.” “Not surprising,” Trish said. “These spider program s spiral out geographically, meaning the first resu lts are always local. Besides, one of your search strings w as ‘Washington, D.C.’ ” “How about a ‘who is’ search?” Katherine prompted. “Wouldn’t that tell you who owns the domain?” A bit lowbrow, but not a bad idea. Trish navigated to the “who is” database and ran a search for the IP, hoping to match the cryptic numbers to an actual do main name. Her frustration was now tempered by risi ng curiosity. Who has this document? The “who is” results appeared quickly, showing no match, and Trish held up her hands in defeat. “It’s like this IP address doesn’t exist. I can’t get any information about it at all.” “Obviously the IP exists . We’ve just searched a document that’s stored ther e!” True. And yet whoever had this document apparently prefe rred not to share his or her identity. “I’m not sur e what to tell you. Systems traces aren’t really my t hing, and unless you want to call in someone with h acking skills, I’m at a loss.” “Do you know someone?” Trish turned and stared at her boss. “Katherine, I was kidding. It’s not exactly a great idea.” “But it is done?” She checked her watch. “Um, yeah . . . all the time. Technically it’s pret ty easy.” “Who do you know?” “Hackers?” Trish laughed nervously. “Like half the guys at my old job.” “Anyone you trust?” "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Is she serious? Trish could see Katherine was dead serious. “ Well, yeah, ” she said hurriedly. “ I know this one guy we could call. He was our systems security specialist—serious computer geek. He wanted to date me, which kind of sucked, but he’s a good guy, and I’d trust him. Also, he does freelance.” “Can he be discreet?” “He’s a hacker. Of course he can be discreet. That’ s what he does. But I’m sure he’ d want at least a thousand bucks to even look—” “Call him. Offer him double for fast results.” Trish was not sure what made her more uncomfortable —helping Katherine Solomon hire a hacker . . . or calling a guy who probably still found it impossibl e to believe a pudgy, redheaded metasystems analyst would rebuff his romantic advances. “You’re sure ab out this?” “Use the phone in the library,” Katherine said. “It ’s got a blocked number. And obviously don’t use my name.” “Right.” Trish headed for the door but paused when she heard Katherine’s iPhone chirp. With luck, the incoming text message might be information that wou ld grant Trish a reprieve from this distasteful tas k. She waited as Katherine fished the iPhone from her lab coat’s pocket and eyed the screen. Katherine Solomon felt a wave of relief to see the name on her iPhone. At last. PETER SOLOMON “It’s a text message from my brother,” she said, gl ancing over at Trish. Trish looked hopeful. “So maybe we should ask him a bout all this . . . before we call a hacker?” Katherine eyed the redacted document on the plasma wall and heard Dr. Abaddon’s voice. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Katherine had no idea what to believe anymore, and this document represented information about the far -fetched ideas with which Peter had apparently beco me obsessed. Katherine shook her head. “I want to know who wrote this and where it’s located. Make the call.” Trish frowned and headed for the door. Whether or not this document would be able to expla in the mystery of what her brother had told Dr. Abaddon, there was at least one mystery that had been solved today. Her brother ha d finally learned how to use the text-messaging feature on the iPhone Kather ine had given him. “And alert the media,” Katherine called after Trish . “The great Peter Solomon just sent his first text message.” In a strip-mall parking lot across the street from the SMSC, Mal’ akh stood beside his limo, stretching his legs and waiting for the phone call he knew would be com ing. The rain had stopped, and a winter moon had started to break through the clouds. It was the sam e moon that had shone down on Mal’akh through the oculus of the House of the Temple three months ago during his initiation. The world looks different tonight. As he waited, his stomach growled again. His two-da y fast, although uncomfortable, was critical to his preparation. Such were the ancient ways. Soon all p hysical discomforts would be inconsequential."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" As Mal’akh stood in the cold night air, he chuckled to see that fate had deposited him, rather ironically, directly in front of a tiny church. Here, nestled b etween Sterling Dental and a minimart, was a tiny s anctuary. LORD’S HOUSE OF GLORY. Mal’akh gazed at the window, which displayed part o f the church’s doctrinal statement: WE BELIEVE THAT JESUS CHRIST WAS BEGOTTEN BY THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY, AND IS BOTH TRUE MAN AND GOD. Mal’akh smiled. Yes, Jesus is indeed both—man and God—but a virgin birth is not the prerequisite for divinity. That is not how it happens. The ring of a cell phone cut the night air, quicken ing his pulse. The phone that was now ringing was Mal’akh’s own —a cheap disposable phone he had purchased yesterda y. The caller ID indicated it was the call he had been anticipating. A local call, Mal’akh mused, gazing out across Silver Hill Road toward the faint moonlit outline of a zigzag roofline over the treetops. Mal’akh flipped open hi s phone. “This is Dr. Abaddon,” he said, tuning his voice de eper. “It’s Katherine,” the woman’s voice said. “I finally heard from my brother.” “Oh, I’m relieved. How is he?” “He’s on his way to my lab right now,” Katherine sa id. “In fact, he suggested you join us.” “I’m sorry?” Mal’akh feigned hesitation. “In your . . . lab?” “He must trust you deeply. He never invites anyone back there.” “I suppose maybe he thinks a visit might help our d iscussions, but I feel like it’s an intrusion.” “If my brother says you’re welcome, then you’re welcome. Besides, he said he has a lot to tell us both, and I’d love to get to the bottom of what’s going on.” “Very well, then. Where exactly is your lab?” “At the Smithsonian Museum Support Center. Do you k now where that is?” “No,” Mal’akh said, staring across the parking lot at the complex. “I’m actually in my car right now, and I have a guidance system. What’s the address?” “Forty-two-ten Silver Hill Road.” “Okay, hold on. I’ll type it in.” Mal’akh waited fo r ten seconds and then said, “Ah, good news, it loo ks like I’m closer than I thought. The GPS says I’m only ab out ten minutes away.” “Great. I’ll phone the security gate and tell them you’re coming through.” “Thank you.” “I’ll see you shortly.” Mal’akh pocketed the disposable phone and looked ou t toward the SMSC. Was I rude to invite myself?

He climbed behind the wheel, put the c ar in gear, and crept forward until he heard the sh arp crack of the iPhone imploding. Mal’akh put the car back in park and stared out at the distant silhouette of the SMSC. Ten minutes. Peter Solomon’s sprawling warehouse housed over thirty mi llion treasures, but Mal’akh had come here tonight to obliterate only the two most valuable. All of Katherine Solomon’s research. And Katherine Solomon herself. CHAPTER 26 Professor Langdon?” Sato said. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost. Are you okay?” Langdon hoisted his daybag higher onto his shoulder and laid his hand on top of it, as if somehow this might better hide the cube-shaped package he was carrying . He could feel his face had gone ashen. “I’m . . . just worried about Peter.” Sato cocked her head, eyeing him askew. Langdon felt a sudden wariness that Sato’s involvem ent tonight might relate to this small package that Solomon had entrusted to him. Peter had warned Lang don: Powerful people want to steal this . It would be dangerous in the wrong hands. Langdon couldn’t imagine why the CIA would want a little box containing a talisman . . . or even what the talisman could be. Ordo ab chao? Sato stepped closer, her black eyes probing. “I sen se you’ve had a revelation?” Langdon felt himself sweating now. “No, not exactly .” “What’s on your mind?” “I just . . .” Langdon hesitated, having no idea wh at to say. He had no intention of revealing the exi stence of the package in his bag, and yet if Sato took him to the CIA, his bag most certainly would be searched on the way in. “Actually . . .” he fibbed, “I have another idea about the numbers on Peter’s hand.” Sato’s expression revealed nothing. “Yes?” She glan ced over at Anderson now, who was just arriving fro m greeting the forensics team that had finally arrive d. "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Langdon swallowed hard and crouched down beside the hand, wondering what he could possibly come up with to tell them. You’re a teacher, Robert—improvise! He took one last look at the seven tiny symbols, hoping for some sort of inspiration. Nothing. Blank. As Langdon’s eidetic memory skimmed through his men tal encyclopedia of symbols, he could find only one possible point to make. It was something that had o ccurred to him initially, but had seemed unlikely. At the moment, however, he had to buy time to think. “Well,” he began, “a symbologist’s first clue that h e’s on the wrong track when deciphering symbols and codes is when he starts interpreting symbols using multiple symbolic languages. For example, when I to ld you this text was Roman and Arabic, that was a poor analysis because I used multiple symbolic systems. The same is true for Roman and runic.” Sato crossed her arms and arched her eyebrows as if to say, “Go on.” “In general, communications are made in one language, not multiple languages, and so a symbolo gist’s first job with any text is to find a single consistent symbolic system that applies to the ent ire text.” “And you see a single system now?” “Well, yes . . . and no.” Langdon’s experience with the rotational symmetry of ambigrams had taught hi m that symbols sometimes had meanings from multiple a ngles. In this case, he realized there was indeed a way to view all seven symbols in a single language. “If we manipulated the hand slightly, the language wil l become consistent.” Eerily, the manipulation Langdo n was about to perform was one that seemed to have been suggested by Peter’s captor already when he sp oke the ancient Hermetic adage. As above, so below. Langdon felt a chill as he reached out and grasped the wooden base on which Peter’s hand was secured. Gently, he turned the base upside down so that Pete r’s extended fingers were now pointing straight dow n. The symbols on the palm instantly transformed thems elves. “From this angle,” Langdon said, “X-I-I-I becomes a valid Roman numeral—thirteen. Moreover, the rest of the characters can be interpreted using the Roman a lphabet—SBB.” Langdon assumed the analysis would elicit blank shrugs, but Anderson’s expression imme diately changed. “SBB?” the chief demanded. Sato turned to Anderson. “If I’m not mistaken, that sounds like a familiar numbering system here in th e Capitol Building.” Anderson looked pale. “It is.” "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Sato gave a grim smile and nodded to Anderson. “ Chief, follow me, please. I ’ d like a word in private. ” As Director Sato led Chief Anderson out of earshot, Langdon stood alone in bewilderment. What the hell is going on here? And what is SBB XIII? Chief Anderson wondered how this night could possib ly get any stranger. The hand says SBB13? He was amazed any outsider had even heard of SBB . . . muc h less SBB13. Peter Solomon’s index finger, it seem ed, was not directing them upward as it had appeared . . . but rather was pointing in quite the opposite d irection. Director Sato led Anderson over to a quiet area nea r the bronze statue of Thomas Jefferson. “Chief,” s he said, “I trust you know exactly where SBB Thirteen is located?” “Of course.” “Do you know what’s inside?” “No, not without looking. I don’t think it’s been u sed in decades.” “Well, you’re going to open it up.” Anderson did not appreciate being told what he woul d do in his own building. “Ma’am, that may be problematic. I’ll have to check the assignment rost er first. As you know, most of the lower levels are private offices or storage, and security protocol regarding private—” “You will unlock SBB Thirteen for me,” Sato said, “ or I will call OS and send in a team with a batteri ng ram.” Anderson stared at her a long moment and then pulle d out his radio, raising it to his lips. “ This is Anderson. I need someone to unlock the SBB. Have someone meet m e there in five minutes.” The voice that replied sounded confused. “Chief, co nfirming you said SBB?” “Correct. SBB. Send someone immediately. And I’ll n eed a flashlight.” He stowed his radio. Anderson’s heart was pounding as Sato stepped closer, lowering her voice even further. “Chief, time is short,” she whispered, “and I want you to get us down to SBB Thirteen as quickly as possible.” “Yes, ma’am.” “I also need something else from you.” In addition to breaking and entering? Anderson was in no position to protest, and yet it had not gone unnoticed by him that Sato had arrived within minut es of Peter’ s hand appearing in the Rotunda, and that she now was using the situation to demand access to pri vate sections of the U.S. Capitol. She seemed so fa r ahead of the curve tonight that she was practically defining it. Sato motioned across the room toward the professor. “The duffel bag on Langdon’s shoulder.” Anderson glanced over. “What about it?” “I assume your staff X-rayed that bag when Langdon entered the building?” “Of course. All bags are scanned.” “I want to see that X-ray. I want to know what’s in his bag.” Anderson looked over at the bag Langdon had been ca rrying all evening. “ But . . . wouldn ’ t it be easier just"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"to ask him? ” “What part of my request was unclear?” Anderson pulled out his radio again and called in h er request. Sato gave Anderson her BlackBerry addre ss and requested that his team e-mail her a digital co py of the X-ray as soon as they had located it. Rel uctantly Anderson complied. Forensics was now collecting the severed hand for t he Capitol Police, but Sato ordered them to deliver it directly to her team at Langley. Anderson was too t ired to protest. He had just been run over by a tin y Japanese steamroller. “And I want that ring,” Sato called over to Forensi cs. The chief technician seemed ready to question her b ut thought better of it. He removed the gold ring f rom Peter’s hand, placed it in a clear specimen bag, an d gave it to Sato. She slipped it into her jacket p ocket, and then turned to Langdon. “We’re leaving, Professor. Bring your things.” “Where are we going?” Langdon replied. “Just follow Mr. Anderson.” Yes, Anderson thought, and follow me closely. The SBB was a section of the Capitol that few ever visited. To reach it, they would pass through a sprawling labyr inth of tiny chambers and tight passages buried ben eath the crypt. Abraham Lincoln’s youngest son, Tad, had once gotten lost down there and almost perished. Anderson was starting to suspect that if Sato had h er way, Robert Langdon might suffer a similar fate. CHAPTER 27 Systems security specialist Mark Zoubianis had always prided himsel f on his ability to multitask. At the moment, he was seated on his futon along with a TV remote, a cordless phone, a laptop, a PDA, and a la rge bowl of Pirate’s Booty. With one eye on the muted R edskins game and one eye on his laptop, Zoubianis w as speaking on his Bluetooth headset with a woman he h ad not heard from in over a year. Leave it to Trish Dunne to call on the night of a p lay -off game. Confirming her social ineptitude yet again, his for mer colleague had chosen the Redskins game as a per fect moment to chat him up and request a favor. After so me brief small talk about the old days and how she missed his great jokes, Trish had gotten to her poi nt: she was trying to unmask a hidden IP address, p robably that of a secure server in the D.C. area. The serve r contained a small text document, and she wanted a ccess to it . . . or at the very least, some information abo ut whose document it was. Right guy, wrong timing, he had told her. Trish then showered him with her finest geek flattery, most of which was true, and before Zoubianis knew it, he wa s typing a strange-looking IP address into his lapt op. Zoubianis took one look at the number and immediate ly felt uneasy. “Trish, this IP has a funky format. It’s written in a protocol that isn’t even publicly avai lable yet. It’s probably gov intel or military.” “ Military? ” Trish laughed. “ Believe me, I just pulled a redacted document off t his server, and it was not"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"military. ” Zoubianis pulled up his terminal window and tried a traceroute. “ You said your traceroute died? ” “Yeah. Twice. Same hop.” “Mine, too.” He pulled up a diagnostic probe and la unched it. “And what’s so interesting about this IP ?” “I ran a delegator that tapped a search engine at t his IP and pulled a redacted document. I need to se e the rest of the document. I’m happy to pay them for it, but I can’t figure out who owns the IP or how to access it.” Zoubianis frowned at his screen. “Are you sure abou t this? I’m running a diagnostic, and this firewall coding looks . . . pretty serious.” “That’s why you get the big bucks.” Zoubianis considered it. They’d offered him a fortu ne for a job this easy. “One question, Trish. Why ar e you so hot on this?” Trish paused. “I’m doing a favor for a friend.” “Must be a special friend.” “She is.” Zoubianis chuckled and held his tongue. I knew it. “Look,” Trish said, sounding impatient. “Are you go od enough to unmask this IP? Yes or no?” “Yes, I’m good enough. And yes, I know you’re playi ng me like a fiddle.” “How long will it take you?” “Not long,” he said, typing as he spoke. “I should be able to get into a machine on their network with in ten minutes or so. Once I’m in and know what I’m lookin g at, I’ll call you back.” “I appreciate it. So, are you doing well?” Now she asks? “Trish, for God’s sake, you called me on the night of a play-off game and now you want to chat? Do you want me to hack this IP or not?” “Thanks, Mark. I appreciate it. I’ll be waiting for your call.” “Fifteen minutes.” Zoubianis hung up, grabbed his b owl of Pirate’s Booty, and unmuted the game. Women. CHAPTER 28 Where are they taking me? As Langdon hurried with Anderson and Sato into the depths of the Capitol, he felt his heart rate incre asing with each downward step. They had begun their journ ey through the west portico of the Rotunda, descend ing"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"a marble staircase and then doubling back through a wide doorway into the famous chamber directly bene ath the Rotunda floor. The Capitol Crypt. The air was heavier here, and Langdon was already f eeling claustrophobic. The crypt’s low ceiling and soft uplighting accentuated the robust girth of the fort y Doric columns required to support the vast stone floor directly overhead. Relax, Robert. “This way,” Anderson said, moving quickly as he angl ed to the left across the wide circular space. Thankfully, this particular crypt contained no bodi es. Instead it contained several statues, a model o f the Capitol, and a low storage area for the wooden cata falque on which coffins were laid for state funeral s. The entourage hurried through, without even a glance at the four-pointed marble compass in the center of t he floor where the Eternal Flame had once burned. Anderson seemed to be in a hurry, and Sato once aga in had her head buried in her BlackBerry. Cellular service, Langdon had heard, was boosted and broadca st to all corners of the Capitol Building to suppor t the hundreds of government phone calls that took place here every day. After diagonally crossing the crypt, the group ente red a dimly lit foyer and began winding through a convoluted series of hallways and dead ends. The wa rren of passages contained numbered doorways, each of which bore an identification number. Langdon read t he doors as they snaked their way around. S154 . . . S153 . . . S152 . . . He had no idea what lay behind these doors, but at least one thing now seemed clear—the meaning of the tattoo on Peter Solomon’s palm. SBB13 appeared to be a numbered doorway somewhere i n the bowels of the U.S. Capitol Building. “What are all these doorways?” Langdon asked, clutc hing his daybag tightly to his ribs and wondering w hat Solomon’s tiny package could possibly have to do wi th a door marked SBB13. “Offices and storage,” Anderson said. “ Private offices and storage,” he added, glancing back at S ato. Sato did not even glance up from her BlackBerry. “They look tiny,” Langdon said. “Glorified closets, most of them, but they’re still some of the most sought-after real estate in D.C. This is the heart of the original Capitol, and the old Senate c hamber is two stories above us.” “And SBB Thirteen?” Langdon asked. “Whose office is that?” “Nobody’s. The SBB is a private storage area, and I must say, I’m puzzled how—” “Chief Anderson,” Sato interrupted without looking up from her BlackBerry. “Just take us there, please .” Anderson clenched his jaw and guided them on in sil ence through what was now feeling like a hybrid sel f- storage facility and epic labyrinth. On almost ever y wall, directional signs pointed back and forth, a pparently attempting to locate specific office blocks in this network of hallways. S142 to S152 . . . ST1 to ST70 . . . H1 to H166 & HT1 to HT67 . . ."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" Langdon doubted he could ever find his way out of h ere alone. This place is a maze. From all he could gather, office numbers began with either an S or an H depending on whether they were on the Senate side of the building or the House side. Areas designated ST and HT were apparently on a level that Anderson ca lled Terrace Level. Still no signs for SBB. Finally they arrived at a heavy steel security door with a key-card entry box. SB Level Langdon sensed they were getting closer. Anderson reached for his key card but hesitated, lo oking uncomfortable with Sato’s demands. “Chief,” Sato prompted. “We don’t have all night.” Anderson reluctantly inserted his key card. The ste el door released. He pushed it open, and they stepp ed through into the foyer beyond. The heavy door click ed shut behind them. Langdon wasn’ t sure what he had hoped to see in this foyer, but the sight in front of him was definitely not it. He was staring at a descending stairway. “Down agai n?” he said, stopping short. “There’s a level under the crypt?” “Yes,” Anderson said. “ SB stands for ‘Senate Basement.’ ” Langdon groaned. Terrific. CHAPTER 29 The headlights winding up the SMSC’s wooded access road were the first the guard had seen in the last hour. Dutifully, he turned down the volume on his p ortable TV set and stashed his snacks beneath the counter. Lousy timing. The Redskins were completing their opening drive, and he didn’t want to miss it. As the car drew closer, the guard checked the name on the notepad in front of him. Dr. Christopher Abaddon. Katherine Solomon had just called to alert Security of this guest’s imminent arrival. The guard had no idea who this doctor might be, but he was apparently ver y good at doctoring; he was arriving in a black str etch limousine. The long, sleek vehicle rolled to a stop beside the guardhouse, and the driver’s tinted win dow lowered silently. “Good evening,” the chauffeur said, doffing his cap . He was a powerfully built man with a shaved head. He was listening to the football game on his radio. “I have Dr. Christopher Abaddon for Ms. Katherine Solomon?” The guard nodded. “Identification, please.” "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The chauffeur looked surprised. “ I ’ m sorry, didn ’ t Ms. Solomon call ahead? ” The guard nodded, stealing a glance at the televisi on. “I’ m still required to scan and log visitor identifica tion. Sorry, regulations. I’ll need to see the doctor’s I D.” “Not a problem.” The chauffeur turned backward in h is seat and spoke in hushed tones through the priva cy screen. As he did, the guard stole another peek at the game. The Redskins were breaking from the huddl e now, and he hoped to get this limo through before t he next play. The chauffeur turned forward again and held out the ID that he’d apparently just received through the privacy screen. The guard took the card and quickly scanned it into his system. The D.C. driver’s license showed one Christopher Abaddon from Kalorama Heights. The phot o depicted a handsome blond gentleman wearing a blue blazer, a necktie, and a satin pocket square. Who the hell wears a pocket square to the DMV? A muffled cheer went up from the television set, an d the guard wheeled just in time to see a Redskins player dancing in the end zone, his finger pointed skyward . “I missed it,” the guard grumbled, returning to th e window. “Okay,” he said, returning the license to the chauf feur. “You’re all set.” As the limo pulled through, the guard returned to h is TV, hoping for a replay. As Mal’akh drove his limo up the winding access roa d, he couldn’t help but smile. Peter Solomon’s secre t museum had been simple to breach. Sweeter still, to night was the second time in twenty-four hours that Mal’akh had broken into one of Solomon’s private sp aces. Last night, a similar visit had been made to Solomon’s home. Although Peter Solomon had a magnificent country es tate in Potomac, he spent much of his time in the c ity at his penthouse apartment at the exclusive Dorches ter Arms. His building, like most that catered to t he super-rich, was a veritable fortress. High walls. G uard gates. Guest lists. Secured underground parkin g. Mal’akh had driven this very limousine up to the bu ilding’s guardhouse, doffed his chauffeur’s cap fro m his shaved head, and proclaimed, “I have Dr. Christophe r Abaddon. He is an invited guest of Mr. Peter Solomon.” Mal’akh spoke the words as if he were ann ouncing the Duke of York. The guard checked a log and then Abaddon’s ID. “Yes, I see Mr. Solomon is expecting Dr. Abaddon.” He pressed a button and the gate opened. “Mr. Solomon is in the penthouse apartment. Have your guest use the last elevator on the right. It goes all the way up.” “Thank you.” Mal’akh tipped his hat and drove throu gh. As he wound deep into the garage, he scanned for se curity cameras. Nothing. Apparently, those who live d here were neither the kind of people who broke into cars nor the kind of people who appreciated being watched. Mal’akh parked in a dark corner near the elevators, lowered the divider between the driver’s compartme nt and the passenger compartment, and slithered throug h the opening into the back of the limo. Once in ba ck, he got rid of his chauffeur’s cap and donned his blond wig. Straightening his jacket and tie, he checked the mirror to make sure he had not smeared his makeup. Mal’akh was not about to take any chances. Not toni ght. I have waited too long for this. Seconds later, Mal’akh was stepping into the privat e elevator. The ride to the top was silent and smoo th. When the door opened, he found himself in an elegan t, private foyer. His host was already waiting. “ Dr. Abaddon, welcome. ”"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" Mal’akh looked into the man’s famous gray eyes and felt his heart begin to race. “Mr. Solomon, I appre ciate your seeing me.” “Please, call me Peter.” The two men shook hands. A s Mal’akh gripped the older man’s palm, he saw the gold Masonic ring on Solomon’s hand . . . the same hand that had once aimed a gun at Mal’akh. A voice whispered from Mal’akh’s distant past. If you pull that trigger, I will haunt you forever. “Please come in,” Solomon said, ushering Mal’akh in to an elegant living room whose expansive windows offered an astonishing view of the Washington skyli ne. “Do I smell tea steeping?” Mal’akh asked as he ente red. Solomon looked impressed. “My parents always greete d guests with tea. I’ve carried on that tradition.” He led Mal’akh into the living room, where a tea servi ce was waiting in front of the fire. “Cream and suga r?” “Black, thank you.” Again Solomon looked impressed. “A purist.” He pour ed them both a cup of black tea. “ You said you needed to discuss something with me that was sensitive in nature and could be discussed only in private.” “Thank you. I appreciate your time.” “You and I are Masonic brothers now. We have a bond . Tell me how I can help you.” “First, I would like to thank you for the honor of the thirty-third degree a few months ago. This is d eeply meaningful to me.” “I’m glad, but please know that those decisions are not mine alone. They are by vote of the Supreme Council.” “Of course.” Mal’akh suspected Peter Solomon had pr obably voted against him, but within the Masons, as with all things, money was power. Mal’akh, after ac hieving the thirty-second degree in his own lodge, had waited only a month before making a multimillion-do llar donation to charity in the name of the Masonic Grand Lodge. The unsolicited act of selflessness, a s Mal’akh anticipated, was enough to earn him a qui ck invitation into the elite thirty-third degree. And yet I have learned no secrets . Despite the age-old whispers—“All is revealed at th e thirty-third degree”—Mal’akh had been told nothin g new, nothing of relevance to his quest. But he had never expected to be told. The inner circle of Freemasonry contained smaller circles still . . . circles Mal’a kh would not see for years, if ever. He didn’t care . His initiation had served its purpose. Something unique had happened within that Temple Room, and it had g iven Mal’akh power over all of them. I no longer play by your rules. “You do realize,” Mal’akh said, sipping his tea, “t hat you and I met many years ago.” Solomon looked surprised. “Really? I don’t recall.” “It was quite a long time ago.” And Christopher Abaddon is not my real name. “I’m so sorry. My mind must be getting old. Remind me how I know you?” Mal’akh smiled one last time at the man he hated mo re than any other man on earth. “It’s unfortunate t hat you don’t recall.” In one fluid motion, Mal’akh pulled a small device from his pocket and extended it outward, driving it hard into the man’s chest. There was a flash of blue lig ht, the sharp sizzle of the stun-gun discharge, and a gasp of pain as one million volts of electricity coursed th rough Peter Solomon’s body. His eyes went wide, and he slumped motionless in his chair. Mal ’ akh stood up now, towering over the man, salivating like a lion about to"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"consume his injured prey. Solomon was gasping, straining to breathe. Mal’akh saw fear in his victim’ s eyes and wondered how many people had ever seen t he great Peter Solomon cower. Mal’akh savored the scene for several long s econds. He took a sip of tea, waiting for the man t o catch his breath. Solomon was twitching, attempting to speak. “Wh-why ?” he finally managed. “Why do you think?” Mal’akh demanded. Solomon looked truly bewildered. “You want . . . mo ney?” Money? Mal’akh laughed and took another sip of tea. “I ga ve the Masons millions of dollars; I have no need of wealth.” I come for wisdom, and he offers me wealth. “Then what . . . do you want?” “You possess a secret. You will share it with me to night.” Solomon struggled to lift his chin so he could look Mal’akh in the eye. “I don’t . . . understand.” “No more lies!” Mal’akh shouted, advancing to withi n inches of the paralyzed man. “I know what is hidd en here in Washington.” Solomon’s gray eyes were defiant. “I have no idea w hat you’re talking about!” Mal’akh took another sip of tea and set the cup on a coaster. “You spoke those same words to me ten yea rs ago, on the night of your mother’s death.” Solomon’s eyes shot wide open. “You . . . ?” “She didn’t have to die. If you had given me what I demanded . . .” The older man’s face contorted in a mask of horrifi ed recognition . . . and disbelief. “I warned you,” Mal’akh said, “if you pulled the tr igger, I would haunt you forever.” “But you’re—” Mal’akh lunged, driving the Taser hard into Solomon ’s chest again. There was another flash of blue lig ht, and Solomon went completely limp. Mal’akh put the Taser back in his pocket and calmly finished his tea. When he was done, he dabbed his lips with a monogrammed linen napkin and peered down at his victim. “Shall we go?” Solomon’s body was motionless, but his eyes were wi de and engaged. Mal’akh got down close and whispered in the man’s e ar. “I’m taking you to a place where only truth remains.” Without another word, Mal’akh wadded up the monogra mmed napkin and stuffed it into Solomon’s mouth. Then he hoisted the limp man onto his broad shoulde rs and headed for the private elevator. On his way out, he picked up Solomon’s iPhone and keys from the hal l table. Tonight you will tell me all your secrets, Mal’akh thought. Including why you left me for dead all those years ago."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 30 SB level. Senate basement. Robert Langdon’s claustrophobia gripped him more ti ghtly with every hastening step of their descent. A s they moved deeper into the building’s original foun dation, the air became heavy, and the ventilation s eemed nonexistent. The walls down here were an uneven ble nd of stone and yellow brick. Director Sato typed on her BlackBerry as they walke d. Langdon sensed a suspicion in her guarded manner , but the feeling was quickly becoming reciprocal. Sa to still hadn’t told him how she knew Langdon was h ere tonight. An issue of national security? He had a hard time understanding any relation betw een ancient mysticism and national security. Then again, he had a hard time understanding much of anything about t his situation. Peter Solomon entrusted me with a talisman . . . a deluded lunatic tricked me into bringing it to the Capitol and wants me to use it to unlock a mystical portal . . . possibly in a room called SBB13. Not exactly a clear picture. As they pressed on, Langdon tried to shake from his mind the horrible image of Peter’s tattooed hand, transformed into the Hand of the Mysteries. The gru esome picture was accompanied by Peter’s voice: The Ancient Mysteries, Robert, have spawned many myths . . . but that does not mean they themselves are fi ction. Despite a career studying mystical symbols and hist ory, Langdon had always struggled intellectually wi th the idea of the Ancient Mysteries and their potent prom ise of apotheosis. Admittedly, the historical record contained indispu table evidence that secret wisdom had been passed d own through the ages, apparently having come out of the Mystery Schools in early Egypt. This knowledge mov ed underground, resurfacing in Renaissance Europe, whe re, according to most accounts, it was entrusted to an elite group of scientists within the walls of Europ e’s premier scientific think tank—the Royal Society of London—enigmatically nicknamed the Invisible Colleg e. This concealed “college” quickly became a brain tru st of the world’s most enlightened minds— those of Isaac Newton, Francis Bacon, Robert Boyle, and even Benja min Franklin. Today, the list of modern “fellows” was no less impressive— Einstein, Hawking, Bohr, and Celsius. These great m inds had all made quantum leaps in human understanding, advances that, according to so me, were the result of their exposure to ancient wi sdom hidden within the Invisible College. Langdon doubte d this was true, although certainly there had been an unusual amount of “mystical work” taking place with in those walls. The discovery of Isaac Newton’s secret papers in 19 36 had stunned the world by revealing Newton’s all- consuming passion for the study of ancient alchemy and mystical wisdom. Newton’s private papers includ ed a handwritten letter to Robert Boyle in which he ex horted Boyle to keep “high silence” regarding the mystical knowledge they had learned. “It cannot be communicated,” Newton wrote, “without immense damage to the world.” The meaning of this strange warning was still being debated today. “ Professor, ” Sato said suddenly, glancing up from her BlackBerry , “ despite your insistence that you have no"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"idea why you ’ re here tonight, perhaps you could shed light on th e meaning of Peter Solomon ’ s ring. ” “I can try,” Langdon said, refocusing. She produced the specimen bag and handed it to Lang don. “Tell me about the symbols on his ring.” Langdon examined the familiar ring as they moved th rough the deserted passageway. Its face bore the im age of a double-headed phoenix holding a banner proclai ming ORDO AB CHAO, and its chest was emblazoned with the number 33. “The double-headed phoenix with the number thirty-three is the emblem of the highe st Masonic degree.” Technically, this prestigious degr ee existed solely within the Scottish Rite. Nonethe less, the rites and degrees of Masonry were a complex hie rarchy that Langdon had no desire to detail for Sat o tonight. “Essentially, the thirty-third degree is a n elite honor reserved for a small group of highly accomplished Masons. All the other degrees can be a ttained by successful completion of the previous de gree, but ascension to the thirty-third degree is control led. It’s by invitation only.” “So you were aware that Peter Solomon was a member of this elite inner circle?” “Of course. Membership is hardly a secret.” “And he is their highest-ranking official?” “Currently, yes. Peter heads the Supreme Council Th irty-third Degree, which is the governing body of t he Scottish Rite in America.” Langdon always loved vis iting their headquarters—the House of the Temple—a classical masterpiece whose symbolic ornamentation rivaled that of Scotland’s Rosslyn Chapel. “Professor, did you notice the engraving on the rin g’s band? It bears the words ‘All is revealed at th e thirty- third degree.’ ” Langdon nodded. “It’s a common theme in Masonic lor e.” “Meaning, I assume, that if a Mason is admitted to this highest thirty-third degree, then something sp ecial is revealed to him?” “Yes, that’s the lore, but probably not the reality . There’s always been conspiratorial conjecture tha t a select few within this highest echelon of Masonry are made privy to some great mystical secret. The truth, I suspect, is probably far less dramatic.” Peter Solomon often made playful allusions to the e xistence of a precious Masonic secret, but Langdon always assumed it was just a mischievous attempt to coax him into joining the brotherhood. Unfortunate ly, tonight’ s events had been anything but playful, and there h ad been nothing mischievous about the seriousness with which Peter had urged Langdon to protect the s ealed package in his daybag. Langdon glanced forlornly at the plastic bag contai ning Peter’s gold ring. “Director,” he asked, “woul d you mind if I held on to this?” She looked over. “Why?” “It’s very valuable to Peter, and I’d like to retur n it to him tonight.” She looked skeptical. “Let’s hope you get that chan ce.” “Thanks.” Langdon pocketed the ring. “Another question,” Sato said as they hastened deep er into the labyrinth. “My staff said that while cr oss- checking the concepts of the ‘thirty-third degree’ and ‘portal’ with Masonry, they turned up literally hundreds of references to a ‘ pyramid ’?” “ That ’ s not surprising, either, ” Langdon said. “ The pyramid builders of Egypt are the forerunners o f the"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"modern stonemasons, and the pyramid, along with Egy ptian themes, is very common in Masonic symbolism.” “Symbolizing what?” “The pyramid essentially represents enlightenment. It’s an architectural symbol emblematic of ancient man’s ability to break free from his earthly plane and as cend upward toward heaven, toward the golden sun, a nd ultimately, toward the supreme source of illuminati on.” She waited a moment. “Nothing else?” Nothing else?! Langdon had just described one of history’s most e legant symbols. The structure through which man elevated himself into the realm of the go ds. “According to my staff,” she said, “it sounds like there is a much more relevant connection tonight. T hey tell me there exists a popular legend about a specific pyramid here in Washington—a pyramid that relates specifically to the Masons and the Ancient Mysterie s?” Langdon now realized what she was referring to, and he tried to dispel the notion before they wasted a ny more time. “I am familiar with the legend, Director, but it’s pure fantasy. The Masonic Pyramid is one of D.C.’s most enduring myths, probably stemming from the pyramid on the Great Seal of the United States. ” “Why didn’t you mention it earlier?” Langdon shrugged. “Because it has no basis in fact. Like I said, it’s a myth. One of many associated w ith the Masons.” “And yet this particular myth relates directly to the Ancient My steries?” “Sure, as do plenty of others. The Ancient Mysterie s are the foundation for countless legends that hav e survived in history—stories about powerful wisdom p rotected by secret guardians like the Templars, the Rosicrucians, the Illuminati, the Alumbrados—the li st goes on and on. They are all based on the Ancient Mysteries . . . and the Masonic Pyramid is just one example.” “I see,” Sato said. “And what does this legend actu ally say?” Langdon considered it for a few steps and then repl ied, “Well, I’m no specialist in conspiracy theory, but I am educated in mythology, and most accounts go some thing like this: The Ancient Mysteries—the lost wisdom of the ages—have long been considered mankin d’s most sacred treasure, and like all great treasu res, they have been carefully protected. The enlightened sages who understood the true power of this wisdom learned to fear its awesome potential. They knew th at if this secret knowledge were to fall into unini tiated hands, the results could be devastating; as we said earlier, powerful tools can be used either for goo d or for evil. So, in order to protect the Ancient Mysteries , and mankind in the process, the early practitione rs formed secret fraternities. Inside these brotherhoods, the y shared their wisdom only with the properly initia ted, passing the wisdom from sage to sage. Many believe we can look back and see the historical remnants of those who mastered the Mysteries . . . in the stori es of sorcerers, magicians, and healers.” “And the Masonic Pyramid?” Sato asked. “How does th at fit in?” “Well,” Langdon said, striding faster now to keep pa ce, “this is where history and myth begin to merge. According to some accounts, by the sixteenth centur y in Europe, almost all of these secret fraternitie s had become extinct, most of them exterminated by a grow ing tide of religious persecution. The Freemasons, it is said, became the last surviving custodians of the A ncient Mysteries. Understandably, they feared that if their own brotherhood one day died off like its predecess ors, the Ancient Mysteries would be lost for all ti me.” “And the pyramid ?” Sato again pressed. Langdon was getting to it. “ The legend of the Masonic Pyramid is quite simple. It states that the Masons, in"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"order to fulfill their responsibility of protecting this great wisdom for future generations, decided to hide it in a great fortress.” Langdon tried to gather his reco llections of the story. “Again, I stress this is al l myth, but allegedly, the Masons transported their secret wisd om from the Old World to the New World—here, to America—a land they hoped would remain free from re ligious tyranny. And here they built an impenetrabl e fortress—a hidden pyramid —designed to protect the Ancient Mysteries until th e time that all of mankind was ready to handle the awesome power that this wis dom could communicate. According to the myth, the Masons crowned their great pyramid with a shining, solid-gold capstone as symbol of the precious treas ure within—the ancient wisdom capable of empowering man kind to his full human potential. Apotheosis.” “Quite a story,” Sato said. “Yes. The Masons fall victim to all kinds of crazy legends.” “Obviously you don’t believe such a pyramid exists. ” “Of course not,” Langdon replied. “There’s no eviden ce whatsoever to suggest that our Masonic forefathe rs built any kind of pyramid in America, much less in D.C . It’ s pretty difficult to hide a pyramid, especially on e large enough to hold all the lost wisdom of the age s.” The legend, as Langdon recalled, never explained ex actly what was supposed to be inside the Masonic Pyramid—whether it was ancient texts, occult writin gs, scientific revelations, or something far more mysterious—but the legend did say that the precious information inside was ingen iously encoded . . . and understandable only to the most enlightened souls. “Anyway,” Langdon said, “this story falls into a ca tegory we symbologists call an ‘archetypal hybrid’— a blend of other classic legends, borrowing so many e lements from popular mythology that it could only b e a fictional construct . . . not historical fact.” When Langdon taught his students about archetypal h ybrids, he used the example of fairy tales, which w ere recounted across generations and exaggerated over t ime, borrowing so heavily from one another that the y evolved into homogenized morality tales with the sa me iconic elements—virginal damsels, handsome princes, impenetrable fortresses, and powerful wiza rds. By way of fairy tales, this primeval battle of “good vs. evil” is ingrained into us as children through our stories: Merlin vs. Morgan le Fay, Saint George vs. the Dragon, David vs. Goliath, Snow White vs. the Witch , and even Luke Skywalker battling Darth Vader. Sato scratched her head as they turned a corner and followed Anderson down a short flight of stairs. “ Tell me this. If I’m not mistaken, pyramids were once consi dered mystical portals through which the deceased pharaohs could ascend to the gods, were they not?” “True.” Sato stopped short and caught Langdon’s arm, glarin g up at him with an expression somewhere between surprise and disbelief. “You’re saying Peter Solomo n’s captor told you to find a hidden portal, and it didn’t occur to you that he was talking about the Masonic Pyramid from this legend?” “By any name, the Masonic Pyramid is a fairy tale. It’s pu rely fantasy.” Sato stepped closer to him now, and Langdon could s mell her cigarette breath. “ I understand your position on that, Professor, but for the sake of my investigati on, the parallel is hard to ignore. A portal leadin g to secret knowledge? To my ear, this sounds a lot like what P eter Solomon’s captor claims you, alone, can unlock .” “Well, I can hardly believe—” “What you believe is not the point. No matter what you belie ve, you must concede that this man might himself believe that the Masonic Pyramid is real.” “The man’ s a lunatic! He may well believe that SBB Thirteen is the entrance to a giant underground pyramid that contains all the lost wisdom of the ancients! ”"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" Sato stood perfectly still, her eyes seething. “The crisis I am facing tonight is not a fairy tale, Professor. It is quite real, I assure you.” A cold silence hung between them. “Ma’am?” Anderson finally said, gesturing to anothe r secure door ten feet away. “We’re almost there, i f you’d like to continue.” Sato finally broke eye con tact with Langdon, motioning for Anderson to move o n. They followed the security chief through the secure doorway, which deposited them in a narrow passage. Langdon looked left and then right. You’ve got to be kidding. He was standing in the longest hallway he had ever seen. CHAPTER 31 Trish Dunne felt the familiar surge of adrenaline as she exite d the bright lights of the Cube and moved into the raw darkness of the void. The SMSC’s front gate had just called to say that Katherine’s guest, Dr. Abaddon, had arrived and required an escort back to Pod 5. Trish had offered to bring him back, mostly out of curiosity. Katherine had said very little about the man who would be visiting them, and Trish was intrigued. The man was apparently someone Peter Sol omon trusted deeply; the Solomons never invited anyone back to the Cube. This was a first. I hope he handles the crossing okay, Trish thought as she moved through the frigid dark ness. The last thing she needed was Katherine’s VIP panicking when he re alized what he had to do to get to the lab. The first time is always the worst. Trish’s first time had been about a year ago. She h ad accepted Katherine’s job offer, signed a nondisc losure, and then come to the SMSC with Katherine to see the lab. The two women had walked the length of “The Street,” arriving at a metal door marked POD 5. Even though Katherine had tried to prepare her by describing the lab’s remote location, Trish was not ready for what she saw when the pod door hissed op en. The void. Katherine stepped over the threshold, walked a few feet into the perfect blackness, and then motioned for Trish to follow. “Trust me. You won’t get lost.” Trish pictured herself wandering in a pitch-black, stadium-size room and broke a sweat at the mere tho ught. “We have a guidance system to keep you on track.” Ka therine pointed to the floor. “Very low-tech.” Trish squinted through the darkness at the rough ce ment floor. It took a moment to see it in the darkn ess, but there was a narrow carpet runner that had been laid down in a straight line. The carpet ran like a roa dway, disappearing into the darkness. “See with your feet,” Katherine said, turning and w alking off. “Just follow right behind me.” As Katherine disappeared into the blackness, Trish swallowed her fear and followed. This is insane! She had taken only a few steps down the carpet when the Pod 5 door swung shut behind her, snuffing out the las t faint hint of light. Pulse racing, Trish turned all of he r attention to the feeling of the carpet beneath he r feet. She"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"had ventured only a handful of steps down the soft runner when she felt the side of her right foot hit hard cement. Startled, she instinctively corrected to th e left, getting both feet back on soft carpet. Katherine’ s voice materialized up ahead in the blackness, her words almost entirely swallowed by the lifeless acoustics of this abyss. “The human body is amazing ,” she said. “If you deprive it of one sensory inpu t, the other senses take over, almost instantly. Right now , the nerves in your feet are literally ‘tuning’ themselves to become more sensitive.” Good thing, Trish thought, correcting course again. They walked in silence for what seemed entirely too long. “How much farther?” Trish finally asked. “We’re about halfway.” Katherine’s voice sounded mo re distant now. Trish sped up, doing her best to stay composed, but the breadth of the darkness felt like it would eng ulf her. I can’t see one millimeter in front of my face! “Katherine? How do you know when to stop walking?” “You’ll know in a moment,” Katherine said. That was a year ago, and now, tonight, Trish was on ce again in the void, heading in the opposite direc tion, out to the lobby to retrieve her boss’s guest. A su dden change in carpet texture beneath her feet aler ted her that she was three yards from the exit. The warning track, as it was called by Peter Solomon, an avid basebal l fan. Trish stopped short, pulled out her key card, and groped in the darkness along the wall until she found the raised slot and inserted her card. The door hissed open. Trish squinted into the welcoming light of the SMSC hallway. Made it . . . again. Moving through the deserted corridors, Trish found herself thinking about the bizarre redacted file th ey had found on a secure network. Ancient portal? Secret location underground? She wondered if Mark Zoubianis was having any luck figuring out where the mysterio us document was located. Inside the control room, Katherine stood in the sof t glow of the plasma wall and gazed up at the enigm atic document they had uncovered. She had isolated her k ey phrases now and felt increasingly certain that t he document was talking about the same far-flung legen d that her brother had apparently shared with Dr. Abaddon. . . . secret location UNDERGROUND where the . . . . . . somewhere in WASHINGTON, D.C. , the coordinates . . . . . . uncovered an ANCIENT PORTAL that led . . . . . . warning the PYRAMID holds dangerous . . . . . . decipher this ENGRAVED SYMBOLON to unveil . . ."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" I need to see the rest of the file, Katherine thought. She stared a moment longer and then flipped the pla sma wall’s power switch. Katherine always turned of f this energy-intensive display so as not to waste th e fuel cell’s liquid hydrogen reserves. She watched as her keywords slowly faded, collapsin g down into a tiny white dot, which hovered in the middle of the wall and then finally twinkled out. She turned and walked back toward her office. Dr. A baddon would be arriving momentarily, and she wante d to make him feel welcome. CHAPTER 32 “Almost there,” Anderson said, guiding Langdon and Sato down the s eemingly endless corridor that ran the entire length of the Capitol’s eastern foundation. “In Lincoln’s day, this passage had a dirt floor an d was filled with rats.” Langdon felt grateful the floor had been tiled; he was not a big fan of rats. The group continued on, their footfalls drumming up an eerie, uneven echo in the long passageway. Doorways lined the long hallway, s ome closed but many ajar. Many of the rooms down on thi s level looked abandoned. Langdon noticed the numbers on the doors were now descending and, after a while, seemed to be running out. SB4 . . . SB3 . . . SB2 . . . SB1 . . . They continued past an unmarked door, but Anderson stopped short when the numbers began ascending again. HB1 . . . HB2 . . . “Sorry,” Anderson said. “Missed it. I almost never come down this deep.” The group backed up a few yards to an old metal doo r, which Langdon now realized was located at the hallway’s central point—the meridian that divided t he Senate Basement (SB) and the House Basement (HB) . As it turned out, the door was indeed marked, but i ts engraving was so faded, it was almost impercepti ble. SBB “Here we are,” Anderson said. “Keys will be arrivin g any moment.” Sato frowned and checked her watch. Langdon eyed the SBB marking and asked Anderson, “W hy is this space associated with the Senate side even though it’s in the middle?” Anderson looked puzzled. “What do you mean?” “It says SBB, which begins with an S, not an H .” "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Anderson shook his head. “ The S in SBB doesn ’ t stand for Senate. It — ” “Chief?” a guard called out in the distance. He cam e jogging up the hallway toward them, holding out a key. “Sorry, sir, it took a few minutes. We couldn’t loc ate the main SBB key. This is a spare from an auxil iary box.” “The original is missing?” Anderson said, sounding surprised. “Probably lost,” the guard replied, arriving out of breath. “Nobody has requested access down here for ages.” Anderson took the key. “No secondary key for SBB Th irteen?” “Sorry, so far we’re not finding keys for any of the rooms in the SBB. MacDonald’s on it now.” T he guard pulled out his radio and spoke into it. “Bob? I’m w ith the chief. Any additional info yet on the key f or SBB Thirteen?” The guard’s radio crackled, and a voice replied, “Ac tually, yeah. It’s strange. I’m seeing no entries s ince we computerized, but the hard logs indicate all the st orage rooms in the SBB were cleaned out and abandon ed more than twenty years ago. They’re now listed as u nused space.” He paused. “All except for SBB Thirte en.” Anderson grabbed the radio. “This is the chief. Wha t do you mean, all except SBB Thirteen?” “Well, sir,” the voice replied, “I’ve got a handwrit ten notation here that designates SBB Thirteen as ‘ private.’ It was a long time ago, but it’s written and initia led by the Architect himself.” The term Architect , Langdon knew, was not a reference to the man who had designed the Capitol, but rather to the man who ran it. Similar to a building manager, the man appoint ed as Architect of the Capitol was in charge of everything including maintenance, restora tion, security, hiring personnel, and assigning off ices. “The strange thing . . .” the voice on the radio sa id, “is that the Architect’s notation indicates tha t this ‘ private space’ was set aside for the use of Peter Solomon.” Langdon, Sato, and Anderson all exchanged startled looks. “I’m guessing, sir,” the voice continued, “that Mr. Solomon has our primary key to the SBB as well as any keys to SBB Thirteen.” Langdon could not believe his ears. Peter has a private room in the basement of the Cap itol? He had always known Peter Solomon had secrets, but this was surpr ising even to Langdon. “Okay,” Anderson said, clearly unamused. “We’ re hoping to get access to SBB Thirteen specificall y, so keep looking for a secondary key.” “Will do, sir. We’re also working on the digital im age that you requested—” “Thank you,” Anderson interrupted, pressing the tal k button and cutting him off. “That will be all. Se nd that file to Director Sato’s BlackBerry as soon as you h ave it.” “Understood, sir.” The radio went silent. Anderson handed the radio back to the guard in fron t of them. The guard pulled out a photocopy of a blueprint and handed it to his chief. “Sir, the SBB is in gray, and we’ve notated with an X which room is SBB Thirteen, so it shouldn’t be har d to find. The area is quite small.” Anderson thanked the guard and turned his focus to the blueprint as the young man hurried off. Langdon looked on, surprised to see the astonishing number of cubicles that made up the bizarre maze beneath t he"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"U.S. Capitol. Anderson studied the blueprint for a moment, nodded , and then stuffed it into his pocket. Turning to t he door marked SBB , he raised the key, but hesitated, looking uneasy about opening it. Langdon felt similar misgivings; he had no idea what was behind this doo r, but he was quite certain that whatever Solomon h ad hidden down here, he wanted to keep private. Very private. Sato cleared her throat, and Anderson got the messa ge. The chief took a deep breath, inserted the key, and tried to turn it. The key didn’t move. For a split second, Langdon felt hopeful the key was wrong. On the second try, though, the lock turned, and Anderson h eaved the door open. As the heavy door creaked outward, damp air rushed out into the corridor. Langdon peered into the darkness but could see noth ing at all. “Professor,” Anderson said, glancing back at Langdo n as he groped blindly for a light switch. “To answ er your question, the S in SBB doesn’t stand for Senate. It stands for sub. ” “Sub?” Langdon asked, puzzled. Anderson nodded and flicked the switch just inside the door. A single bulb illuminated an alarmingly s teep staircase descending into inky blackness. “SBB is t he Capitol’s subbasement.” "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 33 Systems security specialist Mark Zoubianis was sinking deeper into his futon and scowling at the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"information on his laptop screen. W hat the hell kind of address is this? His best hacking tools were entirely ineffective at breaking into the document or at unmasking Trish’s mysterious IP address. Ten minutes had passed, and Zoubianis’s program was still pounding away in vain at the network firewalls. They showed little hope of p enetration. No wonder they’re overpaying me. He was about to retool and try a different approach when h is phone rang. Trish, for Christ’s sake, I said I’d call you. He muted the football game and answered. “Yeah?” “Is this Mark Zoubianis?” a man asked. “At 357 King ston Drive in Washington?” Zoubianis could hear other muffled conversations in the background. A telemarketer during the play-offs? Are they insane? “Let me guess, I won a week in Anguilla?” “No,” the voice replied with no trace of humor. “ This is systems security for the Central Intelligen ce Agency. We would like to know why you are attempting to hac k one of our classified databases?” Three stories above the Capitol Building’s subbasem ent, in the wide-open spaces of the visitor center, security guard Nuñez locked the main entry doors as he did every night at this time. As he headed back across the expansive marble floors, he thought of t he man in the army-surplus jacket with the tattoos. I let him in. Nuñez wondered if he would have a job tomorrow. As he headed toward the escalator, a sudden poundin g on the outside doors caused him to turn. He squin ted back toward the main entrance and saw an elderly Af rican American man outside, rapping on the glass wi th his open palm and motioning to be let in. Nuñez shook his head and pointed to his watch. The man pounded again and stepped into the light. H e was immaculately dressed in a blue suit and had c lose- cropped graying hair. Nuñez’s pulse quickened. Holy shit. Even at a distance, Nuñez now recognized who this man was. He hurried back to the entrance and u nlocked the door. “I’m sorry, sir. Please, please c ome in.” Warren Bellamy—Architect of the Capitol—stepped acr oss the threshold and thanked Nuñez with a polite nod. Bellamy was lithe and slender, with an erect p osture and piercing gaze that exuded the confidence of a man in full control of his surroundings. For the la st twenty-five years, Bellamy had served as the sup ervisor of the U.S. Capitol. “May I help you, sir?” Nuñez asked. “Thank you, yes.” Bellamy enunciated his words with crisp precision. As a northeastern Ivy League graduate, his diction was so exacting he sounded al most British. “I’ve just learned that you had an in cident here this evening.” He looked deeply concerned. “Yes, sir. It was—” “Where’s Chief Anderson?” “Downstairs with Director Sato from the CIA’s Offic e of Security.” Bellamy’s eyes widened with concern. “The CIA is he re?” “Yes, sir. Director Sato arrived almost immediately after the incident.” “Why?” Bellamy demanded. "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Nuñez shrugged. As if I was going to ask ? Bellamy strode directly toward the escalators. “Whe re are they?” “They just went to the lower levels.” Nuñez hastene d after him. Bellamy glanced back with a look of concern. “Downs tairs? Why?” “I don’t really know—I just heard it o n my radio.” Bellamy was moving faster now. “Take me to them rig ht away.” “Yes, sir.” As the two men hurried across the open expanse, Nuñ ez caught a glimpse of a large golden ring on Bellamy’s finger. Nuñez pulled out his radio. “I’ll alert the chief that you’re coming down.” “No.” Bellamy’s eyes flashed dangerously. “I’d pref er to be unannounced.” Nuñez had made some big mistakes tonight, but faili ng to alert Chief Anderson that the Architect was n ow in the building would be his last. “Sir?” he said, une asy. “I think Chief Anderson would prefer—” “You are aware that I employ Mr. Anderson?” Bellamy said. Nuñez nodded. “Then I think he would prefer you obey my wishes.” CHAPTER 34 Trish Dunne entered the SMSC lobby and looked up with surprise . The guest waiting here looked nothing like the usual bookish, flannel-clad doctors who en tered this building— those of anthropology, oceanography, geology, and other scientific fields. Quite to the contrary, Dr. Abaddon looked almost aristocratic in his impeccably tailored suit. He was tall, with a broad torso, well-tanned face, and perfectly combed blon d hair that gave Trish the impression he was more accustom ed to luxuries than to laboratories. “Dr. Abaddon, I presume?” Trish said, extending her hand. The man looked uncertain, but he took Trish’s plump hand in his broad palm. “I’m sorry. And you are?” “Trish Dunne,” she replied. “I’m Katherine’s assist ant. She asked me to escort you back to her lab.” “Oh, I see.” The man smiled now. “Very nice to meet you, Trish. My apologies if I seemed confused. I wa s under the impression Katherine was here alone this evening.” He motioned down the hall. “But I’ m all yours. Lead the way.” Despite the man’s quick recovery, Trish had seen th e flash of disappointment in his eyes. She now susp ected the motive for Katherine’s secrecy earlier about Dr . Abaddon. A budding romance, maybe? Katherine never discussed her social life, but her visitor was attr active and well-groomed, and although younger than Katherine, he clearly came from her world of wealth and privilege. Nonetheless, whatever Dr. Abaddon h ad"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"imagined tonight ’ s visit might entail, Trish ’ s presence did not seem to be part of his plan. At the lobby’s security checkpoint, a lone guard qu ickly pulled off his headphones, and Trish could he ar the Redskins game blaring. The guard put Dr. Abaddon th rough the usual visitor routine of metal detectors and temporary security badges. “Who’s winning?” Dr. Abaddon said affably as he emp tied his pockets of a cell phone, some keys, and a cigarette lighter. “Skins by three,” the guard said, sounding eager to get back. “Helluva game.” “Mr. Solomon will be arriving shortly,” Trish told the guard. “Would you please send him back to the la b once he arrives?” “Will do.” The guard gave an appreciative wink as t hey passed through. “Thanks for the heads-up. I’ll l ook busy.” Trish’s comment had been not only for the benefit o f the guard but also to remind Dr. Abaddon that Tri sh was not the only one intruding on his private eveni ng here with Katherine. “So how do you know Katherine?” Trish asked, glanci ng up at the mysterious guest. Dr. Abaddon chuckled. “Oh, it’s a long story. We’ve been working on something together.” Understood, Trish thought. None of my business. “This is an amazing facility,” Abaddon said, glanci ng around as they moved down the massive corridor. “I’ve never actually been here.” His airy tone was becoming more genial with every s tep, and Trish noticed he was actively taking it al l in. In the bright lights of the hallway, she also noticed that his face looked like he had a fake tan. Odd. Nonetheless, as they navigated the deserted corridors, Trish gav e him a general synopsis of the SMSC’s purpose and function, including the various pods and their cont ents. The visitor looked impressed. “Sounds like this pla ce has a treasure trove of priceless artifacts. I w ould have expected guards posted everywhere.” “No need,” Trish said, motioning to the row of fish -eye lenses lining the ceiling high above. “ Security here is automated. Every inch of this corridor is recorded twenty-four/seven, and this corridor is the spine o f the facility. It’s impossible to access any of the room s off this corridor without a key card and PIN numb er.” “Efficient use of cameras.” “Knock on wood, we’ve never had a theft. Then again , this is not the kind of museum anyone would rob— there’s not much call on the black market for extin ct flowers, Inuit kayaks, or giant squid carcasses. ” Dr. Abaddon chuckled. “I suppose you’re right.” “Our biggest security threat is rodents and insects .” Trish explained how the building prevented insec t infestations by freezing all SMSC refuse and also b y an architectural feature called a “dead zone”—an inhospitable compartment between double walls, whic h surrounded the entire building like a sheath. “Incredible,” Abaddon said. “So, where is Katherine and Peter’s lab?” “Pod Five,” Trish said. “It’s all the way at the end of this hallway.” Abaddon halted suddenly, spinning to his right, tow ard a small window. “My word! Will you look at that !” "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Trish laughed. “ Yeah, that ’ s Pod Three. They call it Wet Pod. ” “Wet?” Abaddon said, face pressed to the glass. “There are over three thousand gallons of liquid et hanol in there. Remember the giant squid carcass I mentioned earlier?” “That’s the squid?!” Dr. Abaddon turned from the wi ndow momentarily, his eyes wide. “It’s huge!” “A female Architeuthis,” Trish said. “She’s over fo rty feet.” Dr. Abaddon, apparently enraptured by the sight of the squid, seemed unable to pull his eyes away from the glass. For a moment, the grown man reminded Trish o f a little boy at a pet-store window, wishing he co uld go in and see a puppy. Five seconds later, he was s till staring longingly through the window. “Okay, okay,” Trish finally said, laughing as she i nserted her key card and typed her PIN number. “ Come on. I’ll show you the squid.” As Mal’akh stepped into the dimly lit world of Pod 3, he scanned the walls for security cameras. Kathe rine’s pudgy little assistant began rattling on about the specimens in this room. Mal’akh tuned her out. He h ad no interest whatsoever in giant squids. His only inter est was in using this dark, private space to solve an unexpected problem. CHAPTER 35 The wooden stairs descending to the Capitol’ s subbasement were as steep and shallow as any stai rs Langdon had ever traversed . His breathing was faster now, and his lungs felt t ight. The air down here was cold and damp, and Langdon couldn’t help but flash on a simi lar set of stairs he had taken a few years back int o the Vatican’s Necropolis. The City of the Dead. Ahead of him, Anderson led the way with his flashli ght. Behind Langdon, Sato followed closely, her tin y hands occasionally pressing into Langdon’s back. I’m going as fast as I can. Langdon inhaled deeply, trying to ignore the cramped walls on either side of him. There was barely room for his shoulders on this sta ircase, and his daybag now scraped down the sidewall. “Maybe you should leave your bag above,” Sato offer ed behind him. “I’m fine,” Langdon replied, having no intention of letting it out of his sight. He pictured Peter’s l ittle package and could not begin to imagine how it might relate to anything in the subbasement of the U.S. Capitol. “Just a few more steps,” Anderson said. “Almost the re.” The group had descended into darkness, moving beyon d the reach of the staircase’s lone lightbulb. When Langdon stepped off the final wooden tread, he coul d feel that the floor beneath his feet was dirt. Journey to the center of the Earth. Sato stepped down behind him. Anderson now raised his beam, examining their surro undings. The subbasement was less of a basement tha n it was an ultranarrow corridor that ran perpendicul ar to the stairs. Anderson shone his light left and then right, and Langdon could see the passage was only a bout fifty feet long and lined on both sides with s mall wooden doors. The doors abutted one another so clos ely that the rooms behind them could not have been"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"more than ten feet wide. ACME Storage meets the Catacombs of Domatilla, Langdon thought as Anderson consulted the blueprin t. The tiny section depicting the subbasement was mark ed with an X to show the location of SBB13. Langdon couldn’t help but notice that the layout was identi cal to a fourteen-tomb mausoleum—seven vaults facin g seven vaults—with one removed to accommodate the st airs they had just descended. Thirteen in all. He suspected America’s “thirteen” conspiracy theori sts would have a field day if they knew there were exactly thirteen storage rooms buried beneath the U.S. Capitol. Som e found it suspicious that the Great Seal of the United States had thirteen stars, thirteen a rrows, thirteen pyramid steps, thirteen shield stri pes, thirteen olive leaves, thirteen olives, thirteen letters in annuit coeptis, thirteen letters in e pluribus unum, and on and on. “It does look abandoned,” Anderson said, shining the beam i nto the chamber directly in front of them. The heavy wooden door was wide open. The shaft of light illuminated a narrow stone chamber—about ten feet wide by some thirty feet deep—like a dead-end hallw ay to nowhere. The chamber contained nothing more than a couple of old collapsed wooden boxes and som e crumpled packing paper. Anderson shone his light on a copper plate mounted on the door. The plate was covered with verdigris, but the old marking was legible: SBB IV “SBB Four,” Anderson said. “Which one is SBB Thirteen?” Sato asked, faint wisp s of steam curling out of her mouth in the cold subterranean air. Anderson turned the beam toward the south end of th e corridor. “Down there.” Langdon peered down the narrow passage and shivered , feeling a light sweat despite the cold. As they moved through the phalanx of doorways, all of the rooms looked the same, doors ajar, apparentl y abandoned long ago. When they reached the end of th e line, Anderson turned to his right, raising the b eam to peer into room SBB13. The flashlight beam, however, was impeded by a heavy wooden door. Unlike the others, the door to SBB13 was closed. This final door looked exactly like the others — heavy hinges, iron handle, and a copper number plat e"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"encrusted with green. The seven characters on the n umber plate were the same characters on Peter ’ s palm upstairs. SBB XIII Please tell me the door is locked, Langdon thought. Sato spoke without hesitation. “Try the door.” The police chief looked uneasy, but he reached out, grasped the heavy iron handle, and pushed down on it. The handle didn’t budge. He shone the light now, il luminating a heavy, old-fashioned lock plate and ke yhole. “Try the master key,” Sato said. Anderson produced the main key from the entry door upstairs, but it was not even close to fitting. “Am I mistaken,” Sato said, her tone sarcastic, “or shouldn’t Security have access to every corner of a building in case of emergency?” Anderson exhaled and looked back at Sato. “Ma’am, m y men are checking for a secondary key, but—” “Shoot the lock,” she said, nodding toward the key plate beneath the lever. Langdon’s pulse leaped. Anderson cleared his throat, sounding uneasy. “Ma’a m, I’m waiting for news on a secondary key. I am no t sure I’m comfortable blasting our way into—” “Perhaps you’d be more comfortable in prison for ob structing a CIA investigation?” Anderson looked incredulous. After a long beat, he reluctantly handed the light to Sato and unsnapped his holster. “Wait!” Langdon said, no longer able to stand idly by. “Think about it. Peter gave up his right hand r ather than reveal whatever might be behind this door. Are you sure we want to do this? Unlocking this door i s essentially complying with the demands of a terrori st.” “Do you want to get Peter Solomon back?” Sato asked . “Of course, but—” “Then I suggest you do exactly what his captor is r equesting.” “Unlock an ancient portal? You think this is the portal?” Sato shone the light in Langdon’s face. “Professor, I have no idea what the hell this is. Whether it’s a storage unit or the secret entrance to an ancient pyramid, I intend to open it. Do I make myself clear?” Langdon squinted into the light and finally nodded. Sato lowered the beam and redirected it at the door ’s antique key plate. “Chief? Go ahead.” Still looking averse to the plan, Anderson extracte d his sidearm very, very slowly, gazing down at it with uncertainty. “Oh, for God’s sake!” Sato’s tiny hands shot out, a nd she grabbed the weapon from him. She stuffed the flashlight into his now empty palm. “ Shine the damned light. ” She handled the gun with the confidence of"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"someone who had trained with weapons, wasting no ti me turning off the pistol ’ s safety, cocking the weapon, and aiming at the lock. “Wait!” Langdon yelled, but he was too late. The gun roared three times. Langdon’s eardrums felt like they had exploded. Is she insane?! The gunshots in the tiny space had been deafening. Anderson also looked shaken, his hand wavering a bi t as he shone the flashlight on the bullet-riddled door. The lock mechanism was now in tatters, the wood sur rounding it entirely pulverized. The lock had relea sed, the door now having fallen ajar. Sato extended the pistol and pressed the tip of the barrel against the door, giving it a push. The doo r swung fully into the blackness beyond. Langdon peered in but could see nothing in the dark ness. What in the world is that smell? An unusual, fetid odor wafted out of the darkness. Anderson stepped into the doorway and shone the lig ht on the floor, tracing carefully down the length of the barren dirt floor. This room was like the others—a long, narrow space. The sidewalls were rugged stone , giving the room the feel of an ancient prison cell. But that smell . . . “There’s nothing here,” Anderson said, moving the b eam farther down the chamber floor. Finally, as the beam reached the end of the floor, he raised it up to illuminate the chamber’s farthest wall. “My God . . . !” Anderson shouted. Everyone saw it and jumped back. Langdon stared in disbelief at the deepest recess o f the chamber. To his horror, something was staring back. CHAPTER 36 “What in God’s name . . . ?” At the threshold of SBB13, And erson fumbled with his light and retreated a step. Langdon also recoiled, as did Sato, who looked star tled for the first time all night. Sato aimed the gun at the back wall and motioned fo r Anderson to shine the light again. Anderson raise d the light. The beam was dim by the time it reached the far wall, but the light was enough to illuminate th e shape of a pallid and ghostly face, staring back at them through lifeless sockets. A human skull. The skull sat atop a rickety wooden desk positioned against the rear wall of the chamber. Two human le g bones sat beside the skull, along with a collection of other items that were meticulously arranged on the desk"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"in shrinelike fashion — an antique hourglass, a crystal flask, a candle, tw o saucers of pale powder, and a sheet of paper. Propped against the wall beside the desk stood the fearsome shape of a long scythe, its curv ed blade as familiar as that of the grim reaper. Sato stepped into the room. “Well, now . . . it app ears Peter Solomon keeps more secrets than I imagin ed.” Anderson nodded, inching after her. “Talk about ske letons in your closet.” He raised the light and sur veyed the rest of the empty chamber. “And that smell ?” he added, crinkling his nose. “What is it?” “Sulfur,” Langdon replied evenly behind them. “Ther e should be two saucers on the desk. The saucer on the right will contain salt. And the other sulfur.” Sato wheeled in disbelief. “How the hell would you know that ?!” “Because, ma’am, there are rooms exactly like this all over the world.” One story above the subbasement, Capitol security g uard Nuñez escorted the Architect of the Capitol, Warren Bellamy, down the long hallway that ran the length of the eastern basement. Nuñez could have sw orn that he had just heard three gunshots down here, mu ffled and underground. There’s no way. “Subbasement door is open,” Bellamy said, squinting down the hallway at a door that stood ajar in the distance. Strange evening indeed, Nuñez thought. Nobody goes down there. “I’ll be glad to find out what’s going on,” he said, reaching for his radio. “Go back to your duties,” Bellamy said. “I’m fine f rom here.” Nuñez shifted uneasily. “You sure?” Warren Bellamy stopped, placing a firm hand on Nuñe z’s shoulder. “Son, I’ve worked here for twenty-fiv e years. I think I can find my way.” CHAPTER 37 Mal’akh had seen some eerie spaces in his life, but few rivale d the unearthly world of Pod 3. Wet Pod. The massive room looked as if a mad scientist had taken over a Walmart and packed every aisle and shelf wi th specimen jars of all shapes and sizes. Lit like a p hotographic darkroom, the space was bathed in a red dish haze of “safelight” that emanated from beneath the shelves, filtering upward and illuminating the etha nol- filled containers. The clinical smell of preservati ve chemicals was nauseating. “This pod houses over twenty thousand species,” the chubby girl was saying. “Fish, rodents, mammals, reptiles.” “All dead, I hope?” Mal’akh asked, making a show of sounding nervous. The girl laughed. “Yes, yes. All very much dead. I’ ll admit, I didn’ t dare come in for at least six months after I started work.” "},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Mal ’ akh could understand why. Everywhere he looked ther e were specimen jars of dead life - forms — salamanders, jellyfish, rats, bugs, birds, and othe r things he could not begin to identify. As if this collection were not unsettling enough on its own, the hazy red safelights that protected these photosensitive spe cimens from long-term light exposure gave the visitor the feeling he was standing inside a giant aquarium, wh ere lifeless creatures were somehow congregating to wat ch from the shadows. “That’s a coelacanth,” the girl said, pointing to a big Plexiglas container that held the ugliest fish Mal’akh had ever seen. “They were thought to be extinct wit h the dinosaurs, but this was caught off Africa a f ew years back and donated to the Smithsonian.” Lucky you, Mal’akh thought, barely listening. He was busy sca nning the walls for security cameras. He saw only one—trained on the entry door—not surprising, considering that entrance was probably the only way in. “And here is what you wanted to see . . .” she said , leading him to the giant tank he had seen from th e window. “Our longest specimen.” She swept her arm o ut over the vile creature like a game-show host displaying a new car. “Architeuthis.” The squid tank looked like a series of glass phone booths had been laid on their sides and fused end t o end. Within the long, clear Plexiglas coffin hovered a s ickeningly pale and amorphous shape. Mal’akh gazed down at the bulbous, saclike head and its basketbal l-size eyes. “Almost makes your coelacanth look handsome,” he said. “Wait till you see her lit.” Trish flipped back the long lid of the tank. Ethano l fumes wafted out as she reached down into the tan k and flipped a switch just above the liquid line. A stri ng of fluorescent lights flickered to life along th e entire base of the tank. Architeuthis was now shining in all he r glory—a colossal head attached to a slithery mass of decaying tentacles and razor-sharp suckers. She began talking about how Architeuthis could beat a sperm whale in a fight. Mal’akh heard only empty prattling. The time had come. Trish Dunne always felt a bit uneasy in Pod 3, but the chill that had just run through her felt differ ent. Visceral. Primal. She tried to ignore it, but it grew quickly now, cl awing deeply at her. Although Trish could not seem to place the source of her anxiety, her gut was clearly tell ing her it was time to leave. “Anyhow, that’s the squid,” she said, reaching into the tank and turning off the display light. “We sh ould probably get back to Katherine’s—” A broad palm clamped hard over her mouth, yanking h er head back. Instantly, a powerful arm was wrapped around her torso, pinning her against a rock-hard c hest. For a split second, Trish went numb with shoc k. Then came the terror. The man groped across her chest, grabbing her key c ard and yanking down hard. The cord burned the back of her neck before snapping. The key card fell on the floor at their feet. She fought, trying to twist aw ay, but she was no match for the man’s size and strength. She t ried to scream, but his hand remained tightly acros s her mouth. He leaned down and placed his mouth next to her ear, whispering, “When I take my hand off your mouth, you will not scream, is that clear?” She nodded vigorously, her lungs burning for air. I can’t breathe! "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The man removed his hand from her mouth, and Trish gasped, inhaling deeply. “Let me go!” she demanded, breathless. “What the he ll are you doing?” “Tell me your PIN number,” the man said. Trish felt totally at a loss. Katherine! Help! Who is this man?! “Security can see you!” she said, knowing full well they were out of range of the cameras. And nobody is watching anyway. “Your PIN number,” the man repeated. “The one that matches your key card.” An icy fear churned in her gut, and Trish spun viol ently, wriggling an arm free and twisting around, c lawing at the man’s eyes. Her fingers hit flesh and raked down one cheek. Four dark gashes opened on his fles h where she scratched him. Then she realized the dark stripes on his flesh were not blood. The man was wearing makeup, which she had just scratched off, r evealing dark tattoos hidden underneath. Who is this monster?! With seemingly superhuman strength, the man spun he r around and hoisted her up, pushing her out over t he open squid tank, her face now over the ethanol. The fumes burned her nostrils. “What is your PIN number?” he repeated. Her eyes burned, and she could see the pale flesh o f the squid submerged beneath her face. “Tell me,” he said, pushing her face closer to the surface. “What is it?” Her throat was burning now. “Zero-eight-zero-four!” she blurted, barely able to breathe. “Let me go! Z ero- eight-zero-four!” “If you’re lying,” he said, pushing down farther, h er hair in the ethanol now. “I’m not lying!” she said, coughing. “August 4! It’ s my birthday!” “Thank you, Trish.” His powerful hands clasped her head tighter, and a crushing force rammed her downward, plunging her fa ce into the tank. Searing pain burned her eyes. The ma n pressed down harder, driving her whole head under the ethanol. Trish felt her face pressing into the fles hy head of the squid. Summoning all of her strength, she bucked violently , arching backward, trying to pull her head out of the tank. But the powerful hands did not budge. I have to breathe! She remained submerged, straining not to open her e yes or mouth. Her lungs burned as she fought the powerful urge to breathe in. No! Don’t! But Trish’s inhalation reflex finally took over. Her mouth flew open, and her lungs expanded violent ly, attempting to suck in the oxygen that her body craved. In a searing rush, a wave of ethanol poured into her mouth. As the chemicals gushed down her t hroat into her lungs, Trish felt a pain like nothing she had ever imagined possible. Mercifully, it lasted o nly a few seconds before her world went black. Mal’akh stood beside the tank, catching his breath and surveying the damage. The lifeless woman lay slumped over the rim of the tank, her face still submerged in ethanol. Seeing h er there, Mal’akh flashed on the only other woman he h ad ever killed. "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Isabel Solomon. Long ago. Another life. Mal’akh gazed down now at the woman’s flaccid corps e. He grabbed her ample hips and lifted with his le gs, hoisting her up, pushing forward, until she began t o slide over the rim of the squid tank. Trish Dunne slithered headfirst down into the ethanol. The rest of her body followed, sloshing down. Gradually, th e ripples subsided, leaving the woman hovering limp o ver the huge sea creature. As her clothing got heav ier, she began to sink, slipping into the darkness. Bit by bit, Trish Dunne’s body settled on top of the gr eat beast. Mal’akh wiped his hands and replaced the Plexiglas lid, sealing the tank. Wet Pod has a new specimen. He retrieved Trish’s key card from the floor and sl ipped it in his pocket: 0804. When Mal’akh had first seen Trish in the lobby, he’ d seen a liability. Then he’d realized her key card and password were his insurance. If Katherine’s data-st orage room was as secure as Peter had implied, then Mal’akh was anticipating some challenges persuading Katherine to unlock it for him. I now have my own set of keys. He was pleased to know he would no longer have to waste time bending Katherine to his will. As Mal’akh stood up straight, he saw his own reflec tion in the window and could tell his makeup was ba dly mangled. It didn’t matter anymore. By the time Kath erine put it all together, it would be too late. CHAPTER 38 “This room is Masonic?” Sato demanded, turning from the skull and staring at Langdon in the darkness. Langdon nodded calmly. “It’s called a Chamber of Re flection. These rooms are designed as cold, austere places in which a Mason can reflect on his own mort ality. By meditating on the inevitability of death, a Mason gains a valuable perspective on the fleeting nature of life.” Sato looked around the eerie space, apparently not convinced. “This is some kind of meditation room?” “Essentially, yes. These chambers always incorporat e the same symbols—skull and crossed bones, scythe, hourglass, sulfur, salt, blank paper, a candle, et cetera. The symbols of death inspire Masons to pond er how better to lead their lives while on this earth.” “It looks like a death shrine,” Anderson said. That’s kind of the point . “Most of my symbology students have the same reac tion at first.” Langdon often assigned them Symbols of Freemasonry by Beresniak, which contained beautiful photos of Chambers of Reflection. “And your students,” Sato demanded, “don’t find it unnerving that Masons meditate with skulls and scythes?” “No more unnerving than Christians praying at the f eet of a man nailed to a cross, or Hindus chanting in front of a four-armed elephant named Ganesh. Misund erstanding a culture’s symbols is a common root of prejudice.” "},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Sato turned away, apparently in no mood for a lectu re. She moved toward the table of artifacts. Anders on tried to light her way with the flashlight, but the beam was beginning to dim. He tapped the heel of t he light and coaxed it to burn a little brighter. As the threesome moved deeper into the narrow space , the pungent tang of sulfur filled Langdon’s nostr ils. The subbasement was damp, and the humidity in the a ir was activating the sulfur in the bowl. Sato arri ved at the table and stared down at the skull and accompan ying objects. Anderson joined her, doing his best to light the de sk with the weakening beam of his flashlight. Sato examined everything on the table and then plac ed her hands on her hips, sighing. “What is all thi s junk? ” The artifacts in this room, Langdon knew, were care fully selected and arranged. “Symbols of transformation,” he told her, feeling confined as h e inched forward and joined them at the table. “The skull, or c aput mortuum, represents man’s final transformation through deca y; it’s a reminder that we all shed our mortal flesh one day. The sulfur and salt are alche mical catalysts that facilitate transformation. The hourglass represents the transformational power of time.” He motioned to the unlit candle. “And this candle repr esents the formative primordial fire and the awakening of man from his ignorant slumber—transformation throug h illumination.” “And . . . that ?” Sato asked, pointing into the corner. Anderson swung his dimming flashlight beam to the g iant scythe that leaned against the back wall. “Not a death symbol, as most assume,” Langdon said. “The scythe is actually a symbol of the transformat ive nourishment of nature—the reaping of nature’s gifts .” Sato and Anderson fell silent, apparently trying to process their bizarre surroundings. Langdon wanted nothing more than to get out of the place. “I realize this room may seem unusual,” he t old them, “but there’s nothing to see here; it’s really quite normal. A lot of Masonic lodges have chamber s exactly like this one.” “But this is not a Masonic lodge!”Anderson declared . “It’s the U.S. Capitol, and I’d like to know what the hell this room is doing in my building.” “Sometimes Masons set aside rooms like this in thei r offices or private homes as meditation spaces. It is not uncommon.” Langdon knew a heart surgeon in Boston w ho had converted a closet in his office into a Masonic Chamber of Reflection so he could ponder mo rtality before going into surgery. Sato looked troubled. “You’re saying Peter Solomon comes down here to reflect on death?” “I really don’t know,” Langdon said sincerely. “May be he created it as a sanctuary for his Masonic bro thers who work in the building, giving them a spiritual s anctuary away from the chaos of the material world . . . a place for a powerful lawmaker to reflect before mak ing decisions that affect his fellow man.” “Lovely sentiment,” Sato said, her tone sarcastic, “ but I have a feeling Americans might have a problem with their leaders praying in closets with scythes and s kulls.” Well, they shouldn’t, Langdon thought, imagining how different a world i t might be if more leaders took time to ponder the finality of death before racing off t o war. Sato pursed her lips and carefully surveyed all fou r corners of the candle lit chamber. “There must be something in here besides human bones and bowls of chemicals , Professor. Someone transported you all the way from your home in Cambridge to be in this preci se room.” Langdon clutched his daybag to his side, still unab le to imagine how the package he carried might rela te to"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"this chamber. “ Ma ’ am, I ’ m sorry, but I don ’ t see anything out of the ordinary here. ” Langdon hoped that now at last they could get to the business of trying to find Peter. Anderson’s light flickered again, and Sato spun on him, her temper starting to show. “For Christ’s sak e, is it too much to ask?” She plunged her hand into her poc ket and yanked out a cigarette lighter. Striking he r thumb on the flint, she held out the flame and lit the desk’s lone candle. The wick sputtered and then caught, spreading a ghostly luminescence throughout the con stricted space. Long shadows raked the stone walls. As the flame grew brighter, an unexpected sight materi alized before them. “Look!” Anderson said, pointing. In the candlelight, they could now see a faded patc h of graffiti—seven capital letters scrawled across the rear wall. VITRIOL “An odd choice of word,” Sato said as the candlelig ht cast a frightening skull-shaped silhouette acros s the letters. “Actually, it’s an acronym,” Langdon said. “It’s wri tten on the rear wall of most chambers like this as a shorthand for the Masonic meditative mantra: Visita interiora terrae, rectificando invenies occu ltum lapidem .” Sato eyed him, looking almost impressed. “Meaning?” “Visit the interior of the earth, and by rectifying , you will find the hidden stone.” Sato’s gaze sharpened. “Does the hidden stone have any connection to a hidden pyramid?” Langdon shrugged, not wanting to encourage the comp arison. “Those who enjoy fantasizing about hidden pyramids in Washington would tell you that occultum lapidem refers to the stone pyramid, yes. Others will tell you it’s a reference to the Philosopher’s Ston e—a substance alchemists believed could bring them everlasting life or turn lead into gold. Others cla im it’s a reference to the Holy of Holies, a hidden stone chamber at the core of the Great Temple. Some say i t’s a Christian reference to the hidden teachings o f Saint Peter—the Rock. Every esoteric tradition interprets ‘the stone’ in its own way, but invariably the occultum lapidem is a source of power and enlightenment.” Anderson cleared his throat. “ Is it possible Solomon lied to this guy? Maybe he t old him there was something down here . . . and there really isn’t.” Langdon was having similar thoughts . Without warning, the candle flame flickered, as if caught by a draft. It dimmed for a moment and then recovered, burning brightly again. “That’s odd,” Anderson said. “I hope no one closed the door upstairs.” He strode out of the chamber in to the darkness of the hallway. “Hello?” Langdon barely noticed him leave. His gaze had been drawn suddenly to the rear wall. What just happened? “Did you see that?” Sato asked, also staring with a larm at the wall. Langdon nodded, his pulse quickening. What did I just see? A moment earlier, the rear wall seemed to have shim mered, as if a ripple of energy had passed through it. "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Anderson now strode back into the room. “ No one ’ s out there. ” As he entered, the wall shimmered again. “Holy shit!” he exclaimed, jumping back. All three stood mute for a long moment, staring in unison at the back wall. Langdon felt another chill run through him as he realized what they were seeing. H e reached out tentatively, until his fingertips tou ched the rear surface of the chamber. “It’s not a wall,” he said. Anderson and Sato stepped closer, peering intently. “It’s a canvas,” Langdon said. “But it billowed,” Sato said quickly. Yes, in a very strange way. Langdon examined the surface more closely. The she en on the canvas had refracted the candlelight in a startling manner bec ause the canvas had just billowed away from the room . . . fluttering backward through the plane of the rear wall. Langdon extended his outstretched fingers very gent ly, pressing the canvas backward. Startled, he yank ed his hand back. There’s an opening! “Pull it aside,” Sato ordered. Langdon’s heart pounded wildly now. He reached up a nd clutched the edge of the canvas banner, slowly pulling the fabric to one side. He stared in disbel ief at what lay hidden behind it. My God. Sato and Anderson stood in stunned silence as they looked through the opening in the rear wall. Finally, Sato spoke. “It appears we’ve just found o ur pyramid.” CHAPTER 39 Robert Langdon stared at the opening in the rear wall of the cham ber. Hidden behind the canvas banner, a perfectly square hole had been hollowed out of the wall. The opening, about three feet across, appeare d to have been created by removing a series of bricks. F or a moment, in the darkness, Langdon thought the h ole was a window to a room beyond. Now he saw it was not. The opening extended only a few feet into the wall before terminating. Like a rough-hewn cubbyhole, th e recessed niche reminded Langdon of a museum alcove designed to hold a statuette. Fittingly, this niche displayed one small object. About nine inches tall, it was a piece of carved, s olid granite. The surface was elegant and smooth wi th four polished sides that shone in the candlelight. Langdon could not fathom what it was doing here. A stone pyramid? “From your look of surprise,” Sato said, sounding s elf-satisfied, “I take it this object is not typical within a Chamber of Reflection?” Langdon shook his head."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" “Then perhaps you would like to reassess your previ ous claims regarding the legend of a Masonic Pyrami d hidden in Washington?” Her tone now was almost smug . “Director,” Langdon replied instantly, “this little pyramid is not the Masonic Pyramid.” “So it is merely coincidence that we found a pyrami d hidden at the heart of the U.S. Capitol in a secr et chamber belonging to a Masonic leader?” Langdon rubbed his eyes and tried to think clearly. “Ma’am, this pyramid doesn’t resemble the myth in any way. The Masonic Pyramid is described as enormous, with a tip forged of solid gold.” Moreover, Langdon knew, this little pyramid—with it s flat top—was not even a true pyramid. Without its tip, this was another symbol entirely. Known as an Unfinished Pyramid, it was a symbolic reminder that man’s ascent to his full human potential was always a work in progress. Though few realized it, this s ymbol was the most widely published symbol on earth. Over twenty billion in print. Adorning every one-dollar bill in circulation, the Unfinished Pyramid waited patie ntly for its shining capstone, which hovered above it as a reminder of America’s yet-unfulfilled destiny and t he work yet to be done, both as a country and as individuals. “Lift it down,” Sato said to Anderson, motioning to the pyramid. “I want a closer look.” She began mak ing room on the desk by shoving the skull and crossed b ones to one side with no reverence whatsoever. Langdon was starting to feel like they were common grave robbers, desecrating a personal shrine. Anderson maneuvered past Langdon, reached into the niche, and clamped his large palms on either side o f the pyramid. Then, barely able to lift at this awkw ard angle, he slid the pyramid toward him and lower ed it with a hard thud onto the wooden desk. He stepped b ack to give Sato room. The director repositioned the candle close to the p yramid and studied its polished surface. Slowly, sh e ran her tiny fingers over it, examining every inch of the f lat top, and then the sides. She wrapped her hands around to feel the back, then frowned in apparent disappointm ent. “Professor, earlier you said the Masonic Pyram id was constructed to protect secret information.” “That’s the legend, yes.” “So, hypothetically speaking, if Peter’s captor bel ieved this was the Masonic Pyramid, he would believe it contained powerful information.” Langdon nodded, exasperated. “Yes, although even if he found this information, he probably would not b e able to read it. According to legend, the contents of the pyram id are encoded, making them indecipherable . . . except to the most worthy.” “I beg your pardon?” Despite Langdon’s growing impatience, he replied wi th an even tone. “Mythological treasures are always protected by tests of worthiness. As you may recall , in the legend of the Sword in the Stone, the ston e refuses to give up the sword except to Arthur, who was spir itually prepared to wield the sword’s awesome power . The Masonic Pyramid is based on the same idea. In this case, the information is the treasure, and it is s aid to be written in an encoded language—a mystical tongue of lost words—legible only to the worthy.” A faint smile crossed Sato’s lips. “That may explai n why you were summoned here tonight.” “I’m sorry?” Calmly, Sato rotated the pyramid in place, turning it a full 180 degrees. The pyramid’ s fourth side now shone in the candlelight. "},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Robert Langdon stared at it with surprise. “It appears,” Sato said, “that someone believes you ’re worthy.” CHAPTER 40 What’s taking Trish so long? Katherine Solomon checked her watch again. She’d fo rgotten to warn Dr. Abaddon about the bizarre commute to her lab, but she couldn’t imagine the da rkness had slowed them down this much. They should have arrived by now. Katherine walked over to the exit and heaved open t he lead-lined door, staring out into the void. She listened for a moment, but heard nothing. “Trish?” she called out, her voice swallowed by the darkness. Silence. Puzzled, she closed the door, took out her cell pho ne, and called the lobby. “This is Katherine. Is Tr ish out there?” “No, ma’am,” the lobby guard said. “She and your gu est headed back about ten minutes ago.” “Really? I don’t think they’re even inside Pod Five yet.” “Hold on. I’ll check.” Katherine could hear the gua rd’s fingers clicking on his computer keyboard. “Yo u’re right. According to Ms. Dunne’s key-card logs, she has not yet opened the Pod Five door. Her last acce ss event was about eight minutes ago . . . at Pod Thre e. I guess she’s giving your guest a little tour on his way in.” Katherine frowned. Apparently . The news was a bit odd, but at least she knew Tri sh wouldn’t be long in Pod 3. The smell in there is terrible. “Thanks. Has my brother arrived yet?” “No, ma’am, not yet.” “Thank you.” As Katherine hung up, she felt an unexpected twinge of trepidation. The uneasy feeling made her pause, but only for a moment. It was the same exact disquiet s he’d felt earlier when she stepped into Dr. Abaddon ’s house. Embarrassingly, her feminine intuition had f ailed her there. Badly. It ’s nothing, Katherine told herself. CHAPTER 41 "},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" Robert Langdon studied the stone pyramid. This isn’t possible. “An ancient encoded language,” Sato said without lo oking up. “Tell me, does this qualify?” On the newly exposed face of the pyramid, a series of sixteen characters was precisely engraved into t he smooth stone. Beside Langdon, Anderson’s mouth now gaped open, mi rroring Langdon’s own shock. The security chief looked like he had just seen some kind of alien key pad. “Professor?” Sato said. “I assume you can read this ?” Langdon turned. “Why would you assume that?” “Because you were brought here, Professor. You were chosen. This inscription appears to be a code of some sort, and considering your reputation, it seems obv ious to me that you were brought here to decipher i t.” Langdon had to admit that after his experiences in Rome and Paris, he’d received a steady flow of requ ests asking for his help deciphering some of history’s g reat unsolved codes—the Phaistos Disk, the Dorabell a Cipher, the mysterious Voynich Manuscript. Sato ran her finger over the inscription. “Can you tell me the meaning of these icons?” They’re not icons, Langdon thought . They’re symbols. The language was one he had recognized immediately—an encrypted cipher language from the s eventeenth century. Langdon knew very well how to break it. “Ma’am,” he said, feeling hesitant, “this pyramid is Peter’s private property.” “Private or not, if this code is indeed the reason you were brought to Washington, I am not giving you a choice in the matter. I want to know what it says.” Sato’ s BlackBerry pinged loudly, and she yanked the devi ce from her pocket, studying the incoming message for several moments. Langdon was amazed that the Ca pitol Building’s internal wireless network provided service this far down. Sato grunted and raised her eyebrows, giving Langdo n an odd look. “Chief Anderson?” she said, turning to him. “A word in private, if I may?” The director motioned for Anderson to join her, and they disappeared into the pitch - black hallway, leaving Langdon alone in the"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"flickering candlelight of Peter ’ s Chamber of Reflection. Chief Anderson wondered when this night would end. A severed hand in my Rotunda? A death shrine in my basement? Bizarre engravings on a stone pyramid? Somehow, the Redskins game no longer felt signific ant. As he followed Sato into the darkness of the hall, Anderson flicked on his flashlight. The beam was we ak but better than nothing. Sato led him down the hall a f ew yards, out of sight of Langdon. “Have a look at this,” she whispered, handing Ander son her BlackBerry. Anderson took the device and squinted at the illumi nated screen. It displayed a black-and-white image— the X-ray of Langdon’s bag that Anderson had requested be sent to Sato. As in all X-rays, the objects of g reatest density appeared in the brightest white. In Langdon ’s bag, a lone item outshone everything else. Obvio usly extremely dense, the object glowed like a dazzling jewel in a murky jumble of other items. Its shape w as unmistakable. He ’s been carrying that all night? Anderson looked over at Sato in surprise. “Why did n’t Langdon mention this?” “Damned good question,” Sato whispered. “The shape . . . it can’t be coincidence.” “No,” Sato said, her tone angry now. “I would say n ot.” A faint rustle in the corridor drew Anderson’s atte ntion. Startled, he pointed his flashlight down the black passageway. The dying beam revealed only a deserted corridor, lined with open doors. “Hello?” Anderson said. “Is somebody there?” Silence. Sato gave him an odd look, apparently having heard nothing. Anderson listened a moment longer and then shook it off. I’ve got to get out of here. Alone in the candlelit chamber, Langdon ran his fin gers over the sharply carved edges of the pyramid’s engraving. He was curious to know what the message said, and yet he was not about to intrude on Peter Solomon’s privacy any more than they already had. And why would this lunatic care about this small pyramid anyway? “We have a problem, Professor,” Sato’s voice declar ed loudly behind him. “I’ve just received a new pie ce of information, and I’ve had enough of your lies.” Langdon turned to see the OS director marching in, BlackBerry in hand and fire in her eyes. Taken abac k, Langdon looked to Anderson for help, but the chief was now standing guard at the door, his expression unsympathetic. Sato arrived in front of Langdon and thrust her BlackBerry in his face. Bewildered, Langdon looked at the screen, which dis played an inverted black-and-white photograph, like a ghostly film negative. The photo looked like a jumb le of objects, and one of them shone very brightly. Though askew and off center, the brightest object w as clearly a little, pointed pyramid. A tiny pyramid? Langdon looked at Sato. “What is this?” The question seemed only to incense Sato further. “ You’re pretending you don’t know?” Langdon’s temper flared. “I’m not pretending anything! I’ve never seen this before in my life!” "},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"“ Bullshit! ” Sato snapped, her voice cutting through the musty a ir. “ You ’ ve been carrying it in your bag all night!” “I—” Langdon stalled midsentence. His eyes moved sl owly down to the daybag on his shoulder. Then he raised them again to the BlackBerry. My God . . . the package. He looked more closely at the image. Now he saw it. A ghostly cube, enclosing the pyramid. Stun ned, Langdon realized he was looking at an X-ray of his bag . . . and also of Peter’s mysterious cube-shape d package. The cube was, in fact, a hollow box . . . a small pyramid. Langdon opened his mouth to speak, but his words fa iled him. He felt the breath go out of his lungs as a new revelation struck him. Simple. Pure. Devastating. My God. He looked back at the truncated stone pyramid on t he desk. Its apex was flat—a small square area— a blank space symbolically awaiting its final piece . . . that piece which would transform it from an Unfinished Pyramid into a True Pyramid. Langdon now realized the tiny pyramid he was carryi ng was not a pyramid at all. It’s a capstone. At that instant, he knew why he alone could unlock the myst eries of this pyramid. I hold the final piece . And it is indeed . . . a talisman . When Peter had told Langdon the package contained a talisman, Langdon had laughed. Now he realized his friend was right. This tiny capstone was a talisman, but not the magic kind . . . the far o lder kind. Long before talisman had magical connotations, it had another meaning—“ completion.” From the Greek telesma , meaning “complete,” a talisman was any object or id ea that completed another and made it whole. The finishing element. A capstone, symbolically speaking, was the ultimat e talisman, transforming the Unfinished Pyramid into a symbol of completed perfection. Langdon now felt an eerie convergence that forced h im to accept one very strange truth: with the excep tion of its size, the stone pyramid in Peter’s Chamber o f Reflection seemed to be transforming itself, bit by bit, into something vaguely resembling the Masonic Pyram id of legend. From the brightness with which the capstone shone o n the X-ray, Langdon suspected it was made of metal . . . a very dense metal . Whether or not it was solid gold, he had no way of knowing, and he was not about to let his mind start playing tricks on him. This pyramid is too small. The code’s too easy to r ead. And . . . it’s a myth, for heaven’s sake! Sato was watching him. “For a bright man, Professor , you’ve made some dumb choices tonight. Lying to a n intelligence director? Intentionally obstructing a CIA investigation?” “I can explain, if you’ll let me.” “You will be explaining at CIA headquarters. As of this moment, I am detaining you.” Langdon’s body went rigid. “You can’t possibly be s erious.” “ Deadly serious. I made it very clear to you that th e stakes tonight were high, and you chose not to co operate. I strongly suggest you start thinking about explain ing the inscription on this pyramid, because when w e arrive at the CIA . . .” She raised her BlackBerry and took a close-up snapshot of the engraving on th e stone pyramid. “My analysts will have had a head start.” Langdon opened his mouth to protest, but Sato was a lready turning to Anderson at the door. “Chief,” sh e said, “put the stone pyramid in Langdon’s bag and c arry it. I’ll handle taking Mr. Langdon into custod y. Your weapon, if I may? ”"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" Anderson was stone-faced as he advanced into the ch amber, unsnapping his shoulder holster as he came. He gave his gun to Sato, who immediately aimed it at L angdon. Langdon watched as if in a dream. This cannot be happening. Anderson now came to Langdon and removed the daybag from his shoulder, carrying it over to the desk an d setting it on the chair. He unzipped the bag, propp ed it open, and then hoisted the heavy stone pyrami d off the desk and into the bag, along with Langdon’s not es and the tiny package. Suddenly there was a rustle of movement in the hall way. A dark outline of a man materialized in the doorway, rushing into the chamber and approaching f ast behind Anderson. The chief never saw him coming . In an instant, the stranger had lowered his shoulde r and crashed into Anderson’s back. The chief launc hed forward, his head cracking into the edge of the sto ne niche. He fell hard, crumpling on the desk, send ing bones and artifacts flying. The hourglass shattered on the floor. The candle toppled to the floor, sti ll burning. Sato reeled amid the chaos, raising the gun, but th e intruder grabbed a femur and lashed out with it, striking her shoulder with the leg bone. Sato let out a cry of pain and fell back, dropping the weapon. The new comer kicked the gun away and then wheeled toward Langdon . The man was tall and slender, an elegant African American whom Langdon had never seen before in his life. “Grab the pyramid!” the man commanded. “Follow me!” CHAPTER 42 The African American man leading Langdon through the Capitol’ s subterranean maze was clearly someone of power. Beyond knowing his way through all the si de corridors and back rooms, the elegant stranger carried a key ring that seemed to unlock every door that blocked their way. Langdon followed, quickly running up an unfamiliar staircase. As they climbed, he felt the leather str ap of his daybag cutting hard into his shoulder. The ston e pyramid was so heavy that Langdon feared the bag’ s strap might break. The past few minutes defied all logic, and now Lang don found himself moving on instinct alone. His gut told him to trust this stranger. Beyond saving Langdon f rom Sato’s arrest, the man had taken dangerous acti on to protect Peter Solomon’s mysterious pyramid. Whatever the pyramid may be. While his motivation remained a mystery, Langdon had glimpsed a telltale shimmer of gold on the man’s hand—a Masonic ring—the double-headed phoenix and the number 33. This man a nd Peter Solomon were more than trusted friends. They were Masonic brothers of the highest degree. Langdon followed him to the top of the stairs, into another corridor, and then through an unmarked doo r into a utilitarian hallway. They ran past supply boxes a nd bags of garbage, veering off suddenly through a service door that deposited them in an utterly unexpected w orld—a plush movie theater of some sort. The older man led the way up the side aisle and out the main door s into the light of a large atrium. Langdon now rea lized they were in the visitor center through which he ha d entered earlier tonight. Unfortunately, so was a Capitol police officer. As they came face-to- face with the officer, all three men stopped, stari ng at one another. Langdon recognized the young Hispanic officer from the X-ray machine e arlier tonight. "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"“ Officer Nuñez, ” the African American man said. “ Not a word. Follow me. ” The guard looked uneasy but obeyed without question . Who is this guy? The three of them hurried toward the southeast corn er of the visitor center, where they arrived at a s mall foyer and a set of heavy doors blocked with orange pylons. The doors were sealed with masking tape, apparently to keep the dust of whatever was happeni ng beyond out of the visitor center. The man reache d up and peeled off the tape on the door. Then he flippe d through his key ring as he spoke to the guard. “O ur friend Chief Anderson is in the subbasement. He may be injured. You’ll want to check on him.” “Yes, sir.” Nuñez looked as baffled as he did alarm ed. “Most important, you did not see us.” The man found a key, took it off the key ring, and used it to turn the heavy dead bolt. He pulled open the steel door and tossed the key to the guard. “Lock this door behind us. Put the tape back on as best as you can. Pocket the key and say nothing. To anyone . Including the chief. Is that clear, Officer Nuñez?” The guard eyed the key as if he’d just been entrust ed with a precious gem. “It is, sir.” The man hurried through the door, and Langdon follo wed. The guard locked the heavy bolt behind them, a nd Langdon could hear him re-applying the masking tape . “Professor Langdon,” the man said as they strode br iskly down a modern- looking corridor that was obviously under construction. “My name is Warren Bellamy. Pet er Solomon is a dear friend of mine.” Langdon shot a startled glance at the stately man. You’re Warren Bellamy? Langdon had never met the Architect of the Capitol, but he certainly knew the man’s name. “Peter speaks very highly of you,” Bellamy said, “a nd I’m sorry we are meeting under these dreadful circumstances.” “Peter is in terrible trouble. His hand . . .” “I know.” Bellamy sounded grim. “That’s not the hal f of it, I’m afraid.” They reached the end of the lit section of corridor , and the passageway took an abrupt left. The remai ning length of corridor, wherever it went, was pitch-bla ck. “Hold on,” Bellamy said, disappearing into a nearby electrical room from which a tangle of heavy-duty orange extension cords snaked out, running away fro m them into the darkness of the corridor. Langdon waited while Bellamy rooted around inside. The Arch itect must have located the switch that sent power to the extension cords, because suddenly the route bef ore them became illuminated. Langdon could only stare. Washington, D.C.—like Rome—was a city laced with se cret passageways and underground tunnels. The passage before them now reminded Langdon of the passetto tunnel connecting the Vatican to Castel Sant’Angelo. Long. Dark. Narrow. Unlike the ancient passetto, however, this passage was modern and not yet complete. It was a slender construction zone th at was so long it seemed to narrow to nothing at it s distant end. The only lighting was a string of intermittent construction bulbs that did little more than accen tuate the tunnel’s impossible length. Bellamy was already heading down the passage. “Foll ow me. Watch your step.” Langdon felt himself fall into step behind Bellamy, wondering where on earth this tunnel led. "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"At that moment, Mal ’ akh stepped out of Pod 3 and strode briskly down th e deserted main corridor of the SMSC toward Pod 5. He clutched Trish’s key card in his hand and quietly whispered, “Zero-eight-zero- four.” Something else was cycling through his mind as well . Mal’akh had just received an urgent message from the Capitol Building. My contact has run into unforeseen difficulties. Even so, the news remained encouraging: Robert Langdon now possessed both the pyramid and the capstone. Despite the unexpect ed way in which it had happened, the crucial pieces were falling into place. It was almost as if destiny itself were guid ing tonight’s events, ensuring Mal’akh’s victory. CHAPTER 43 Langdon hurried to keep pace with Warren Bellamy’s brisk footsteps as they moved without a word down the long tunnel. So far, the Architect of the Capit ol appeared far more intent on putting distance bet ween Sato and this stone pyramid than he did on explaining to Langdon what was going on. Langdon had a growing apprehension that there was far more going on than he could imagine. The CIA? The Architect of the Capitol? Two Thirty-t hird-degree Masons? The shrill sound of Langdon’s cell phone cut the ai r. He pulled his phone from his jacket. Uncertain, he answered. “Hello?” The voice that spoke was an eeri e, familiar whisper. “Professor, I hear you had unexpected company.” Langdon felt an icy chill. “Where the hell is Peter ?!” he demanded, his words reverberating in the enc losed tunnel. Beside him, Warren Bellamy glanced over, lo oking concerned and motioning for Langdon to keep walking. “Don’t worry,” the voice said. “As I told you, Pete r is somewhere safe.” “You cut off his hand, for God’s sake! He needs a d octor!” “He needs a priest,” the man replied. “But you can save him. If you do as I command, Peter will live. I give you my word.” “The word of a madman means nothing to me.” “Madman? Professor, surely you appreciate the rever ence with which I have adhered to the ancient proto cols tonight. The Hand of the Mysteries guided you to a portal—the pyramid that promises to unveil ancient wisdom. I know you now possess it.” “You think this is the Masonic Pyramid?” Langdon demanded. “It’s a chunk of rock.” There was silence on the other end of the line. “Mr . Langdon, you’ re too smart to play dumb. You know very well what you’ve uncovered tonight. A stone pyramid . . . hidden at the core of Washington, D.C. . . . by a powerful Mason?” “You’re chasing a myth ! Whatever Peter told you, he told you in fear. The Legend of the Masonic Pyramid is fiction. The Masons never built any pyramid to protect secr et wisdom. And even if they did, this pyramid is far too small to be what you think it i s.” "},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The man chuckled. “ I see Peter has told you very little. Nonetheless, Mr. Langdon, whether or not you choose to accept what it is you now possess, you will do as I say. I am well aware that the pyramid you are carrying has an encrypted engraving. You will decipher that engraving for me. Then, and only the n, will I return Peter Solomon to you.” “Whatever you believe this engraving reveals,” Lang don said, “it won’t be the Ancient Mysteries.” “Of course not,” he replied. “The mysteries are far too vast to be written on the side of a little ston e pyramid.” The response caught Langdon off guard. “But if this engraving is not the Ancient Mysteries, then this pyramid is not the Masonic Pyramid. Legend clearly states the Mas onic Pyramid was constructed to protect the Ancient Mysteries.” The man’s tone was condescending now. “Mr. Langdon, the Masonic Pyramid was constructed to preserve the Ancient Mysteries, but with a twist you’ve appa rently not yet grasped. Did Peter never tell you? T he power of the Masonic Pyramid is not that it reveals the mysteries themselves . . . but rather that it reveals the secret location where the mysteries are buried.” Langdon did a double take. “Decipher the engraving,” the voice continued, “and it will tell you the hiding place of mankind’s gre atest treasure.” He laughed. “Peter did not entrust you w ith the treasure itself, Professor.” Langdon came to an abrupt halt in the tunnel. “Hold on. You’re saying this pyramid is . . . a map ? ” Bellamy jolted to a stop now, too, his expression one of shock and alarm. Clearly, the caller had ju st hit a raw nerve. The pyramid is a map. “This map,” the voice whispered, “or pyramid, or po rtal, or whatever you choose to call it . . . was c reated long ago to ensure the hiding place of the Ancient Mysteries would never be forgotten . . . that it wo uld never be lost to history.” “A grid of sixteen symbols doesn’t look much like a map.” “Appearances can be deceiving, Professor. But regar dless, you alone have the power to read that inscri ption.” “You’re wrong,” Langdon fired back, picturing the s implistic cipher. “ Anyone could decipher this engraving. It’s not very sophisticated.” “I suspect there is more to the pyramid than meets the eye. Regardless, you alone possess the capstone .” Langdon pictured the little capstone in his bag. Order from chaos? He didn’t know what to believe anymore, but the stone pyramid in his bag seemed to be getti ng heavier with every passing moment. Mal’akh pressed the cell phone to his ear, enjoying the sound of Langdon’s anxious breathing on the ot her end. “Right now, I have business to attend to, Prof essor, and so do you. Call me as soon as you have deciphered the map. We will go together to the hidi ng place and make our trade. Peter’s life . . . for all the wisdom of the ages.” “I will do nothing ,” Langdon declared. “Especially not without proof Peter is alive.” “I suggest you not test me. You are a very small co g in a vast machine. If you disobey me, or attempt to find me, Peter will die. This I swear.” “For all I know, Peter is already dead.” "},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"“ He is very much alive, Professor, but he desperatel y needs your help. ” “What are you really looking for?” Langdon shouted into the phone. Mal’akh paused before answering. “Many people have pursued the Ancient Mysteries and debated their power. Tonight, I will prove the mysteries are real .” Langdon was silent. “I suggest you get to work on the map immediately,” Mal’akh said. “I need this information today .” “Today?! It’s already after nine o’clock!” “Exactly. Tempus fugit. ” CHAPTER 44 New York editor Jonas Faukman was just turning off the ligh ts in his Manhattan office when his phone rang. He had no intention of picking up at this hour—that is, until he glimpsed the caller-ID display. This ought to be good, he thought, reaching for the receiver. “Do we still publish you?” Faukman asked, half seri ous. “Jonas!” Robert Langdon’s voice sounded anxious. “T hank God you’re there. I need your help.” Faukman’s spirits lifted. “You’ve got pages for me t o edit, Robert?” Finally? “No, I need information. Last year, I connected you with a scientist named Katherine Solomon, the sist er of Peter Solomon?” Faukman frowned. No pages. “She was looking for a publisher for a book on Noet ic Science? Do you remember her?” Faukman rolled his eyes. “Sure. I remember. And tha nks a million for that introduction. Not only did she refuse to let me read the results of her research, she didn’t want to publish anything until some magi cal date in the future.” “Jonas, listen to me, I don’t have time. I need Kat herine’s phone number. Right now. Do you have it?” “I’ve got to warn you . . . you’re acting a little desperate. She’s great looking, but you’ re not going to impress her by—” “This is no joke, Jonas, I need her number now.” “All right . . . hold on.” Faukman and Langdon had b een close friends for enough years that Faukman kne w when Langdon was serious. Jonas typed the name Kath erine Solomon into a search window and began scanning the company’s e-mail server. “I’m looking now,” Faukman said. “And for what it’s worth, when you call her, you may not want to call from the Harvard Pool. It sounds like you ’ re in an asylum. ”"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" “I’m not at the pool. I’m in a tunnel under the U.S . Capitol.” Faukman sensed from Langdon’s voice that he was not joking. What is it with this guy? “Robert, why can’t you just stay home and write ?” His computer pinged. “Okay, hold on . . . I got it.” He moused through the old e-mail thread. “It looks like all I have is her cell.” “I’ll take it.” Faukman gave him the number. “Thanks, Jonas,” Langdon said, sounding grateful. “ I owe you one.” “You owe me a manuscript, Robert. Do you have any idea how long—” The line went dead. Faukman stared at the receiver and shook his head. Book publishing would be so much easier without the authors. CHAPTER 45 Katherine Solomon did a double take when she saw the name on her cal ler ID. She had imagined the incoming call was from Trish, checking in to explai n why she and Christopher Abaddon were taking so lo ng. But the caller was not Trish. Far from it. Katherine felt a blushing smile cross her lips. Could tonight get any stranger? She flipped open her phone. “Don’t tell me,” she said playfully. “Bookish bache lor seeking single Noetic Scientist?” “Katherine!” The deep voice belonged to Robert Lang don. “Thank God you’re okay.” “Of course I’m okay,” she replied, puzzled. “Other t han the fact that you never called me after that pa rty at Peter’s house last summer.” “Something has happened tonight. Please listen.” Hi s normally smooth voice sounded ragged. “I’m so sor ry to have to tell you this . . . but Peter is in seri ous trouble.” Katherine’s smile disappeared. “What are you talkin g about?” “Peter . . .” Langdon hesitated as if searching for words. “I don’t know how to say it, but he’s been . . . taken . I’m not sure how or by whom, but—” “Taken?” Katherine demanded. “Robert, you’re scarin g me. Taken . . . where?” “Taken captive.” Langdon’s voice cracked as if he w ere overwhelmed. “It must have happened earlier tod ay or maybe yesterday.” “ This isn ’ t funny, ” she said angrily. “ My brother is fine . I just spoke to him fifteen minutes ago! ”"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" “You did?!” Langdon sounded stunned. “Yes! He just texted me to say he was coming to the lab.” “He texted you . . .” Langdon thought out loud. “But you didn ’t actually hear his voice ?” “No, but—” “Listen to me. The text you received was not from your brother. Someone has Peter’s phone. He’s dangerous. Whoever it is tricked me into coming to Washington tonight.” “Tricked you? You’re not making any sense!” “I know, I’m so sorry.” Langdon seemed uncharacteris tically disorientated. “Katherine, I think you coul d be in danger.” Katherine Solomon was sure that Langdon would never joke about something like this, and yet he sounded like he had lost his mind. “I’m fine,” she said. “I ’m locked inside a secure building!” “Read me the message you got from Peter’s phone. Please .” Bewildered, Katherine pulled up the text message an d read it to Langdon, feeling a chill as she came t o the final part referencing Dr. Abaddon. “‘If available, have Dr. Abaddon join us inside. I trust him fully . . .’ ” “Oh God . . .” Langdon’s voice was laced with fear. “Did you invite this man inside?” “Yes! My assistant just went out to the lobby to ge t him. I expect them back any—” “Katherine, get out!” Langdon yelled. “Now!” At the other side of the SMSC, inside the security room, a phone began ringing, drowning out the Redsk ins game. The guard reluctantly pulled out his earbuds one more time. “Lobby,” he answered. “This is Kyle.” “Kyle, it’s Katherine Solomon!” Her voice sounded a nxious, out of breath. “Ma’am, your brother has not yet—” “Where’s Trish?!” she demanded. “Can you see her on the monitors?” The guard rolled his chair over to look at the scre ens. “She hasn’t gotten back to the Cube yet?” “No!” Katherine shouted, sounding alarmed. The guard now realized that Katherine Solomon was o ut of breath, as if she were running. What’s going on back there? The guard quickly worked the video joystick, skimmi ng through frames of digital video at rapid speed. “Okay, hold on, scrolling through playback . . . I’ ve got Trish with your guest leaving the lobby . . . they move down the Street . . . fast-forwarding . . . ok ay, they’ re going into Wet Pod . . . Trish uses her key card to unlock the door . . . both of them step into Wet Po d . . . fast- forwarding . . . okay, here they are coming out of Wet Pod just a minute ago . . . heading down . . .” He cocked his head, slowing the playback. “ Wait a minute. That’s odd.” “What?” "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"“ The gentleman came out of Wet Pod alone. ” “Trish stayed inside?” “Yes, it looks that way. I’m watching your guest no w . . . he’s in the hall on his own.” “ Where is Trish?” Katherine asked more frantically. “I don’t see her on the video feed,” he replied, an edge of anxiety creeping into his voice. He looked back at the screen and noticed that the man’s jacket sleeve s appeared to be wet . . . all the way up to his el bows. What in the world did he do in Wet Pod? The guard watched as the man began to move purpose fully down the main hallway toward Pod 5, clutching in his han d what looked like . . . a key card. The guard felt the hair on the back of his neck sta nd on end. “Ms. Solomon, we’ve got a serious proble m.” Tonight was a night of firsts for Katherine Solomon . In two years, she had never used her cell phone ins ide the void. Nor had she ever crossed the void at a dead run. At the moment, however, Katherine had a cell p hone pressed to her ear while she was dashing blind ly along the endless length of carpet. Each time she f elt a foot stray from the carpet, she corrected bac k to center, racing on through the sheer darkness. “Where is he now?” Katherine asked the guard, breat hless. “Checking now,” the guard replied. “Fast-forwarding . . . okay, here he is walking down the hall . . . moving toward Pod Five . . .” Katherine ran harder, hoping to reach the exit befo re she got trapped back here. “How long until he ge ts to the Pod Five entrance?” The guard paused. “Ma’am, you don’t understand. I’m still fast-forwarding. This is recorded playback. This already happened.” He paused. “Hold on, let me check the e ntry event monitor.” He paused and then said, “Ma’am, Ms. Dunne’s key card shows a Pod Five entry event about a minute ago.” Katherine slammed on the brakes, sliding to a halt in the middle of the abyss. “He already unlocked Po d Five?” she whispered into the phone. The guard was typing frantically. “Yes, it looks li ke he entered . . . ninety seconds ago.” Katherine’s body went rigid. She stopped breathing. The darkness felt suddenly alive all around her. He ’s in here with me. In an instant, Katherine realized that the only lig ht in the entire space was coming from her cell pho ne, illuminating the side of her face. “Send help,” she whispered to the guard. “And get to Wet Pod to hel p Trish.” Then she quietly closed her phone, extingui shing the light. Absolute darkness settled around her. She stood stock-still and breathed as quietly as po ssible. After a few seconds, the pungent scent of e thanol wafted out of the darkness in front of her. The sme ll got stronger. She could sense a presence, only a few feet in front of her on the carpet. In the silence, the pounding of Katherine’ s heart seemed loud enough to give her away. Silently, she stepped out of her shoes and in ched to her left, sidestepping off the carpet. The cement felt cold under her feet. She took one more step to clear the carpet. One of her toes cracked. It sounded like a gunshot in the stillness."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" Only a few yards away, a rustle of clothing suddenl y came at her out of the darkness. Katherine bolted an instant too late and a powerful arm snagged her, gr oping in the darkness, hands violently attempting t o gain purchase. She spun away as a viselike grip caught h er lab coat, yanking her backward, reeling her in. Katherine threw her arms backward, slithering out o f her lab coat and slipping free. Suddenly, with no idea anymore which way was out, Katherine Solomon found herself dashing, dead blind, across an endless blac k abyss. CHAPTER 46 Despite containing what many have called “the most beautiful room in the world,” the Library of Congress is known less for its breathtaking splendor than fo r its vast collections. With over five hundred mile s of shelves—enough to stretch from Washington, D.C., to Boston—it easily claims the title of largest libra ry on earth. And yet still it expands, at a rate of over ten thousand items p er day. As an early repository for Thomas Jefferson’s perso nal collection of books on science and philosophy, the library stood as a symbol of America’s commitment t o the dissemination of knowledge. One of the first buildings in Washington to have electric lights, it literally shone like a beacon in the darkness of t he New World. As its name implies, the Library of Congress was es tablished to serve Congress, whose venerated member s worked across the street in the Capitol Building. T his age-old bond between library and Capitol had be en fortified recently by the construction of a physica l connection—a long tunnel beneath Independence Ave nue that linked the two buildings. Tonight, inside this dimly lit tunnel, Robert Langd on followed Warren Bellamy through a construction z one, trying to quell his own deepening concern for Kathe rine. This lunatic is at her lab?! Langdon didn’t even want to imagine why. When he had called to warn her , Langdon had told Katherine exactly where to meet him before they hung up. How much longer is this damned tunnel? His head ached now, a roiling torrent of interconnected thoughts: Katherine, Peter, the Maso ns, Bellamy, pyramids, ancient prophecy . . . and a map. Langdon shook it all off and pressed on. Bellamy promised me answers. When the two men finally reached the end of the pas sage, Bellamy guided Langdon through a set of doubl e doors that were still under construction. Finding n o way to lock the unfinished doors behind them, Bel lamy improvised, grabbing an aluminum ladder from the co nstruction supplies and leaning it precariously aga inst the outside of the door. Then he balanced a metal bucket on top. If anyone opened the door, the bucket would crash loudly to the floor. That’s our alarm system? Langdon eyed the perched bucket, hoping Bellamy ha d a more comprehensive plan for their safety tonight. Everything had happened s o fast, and Langdon was only now starting to proces s the repercussions of his fleeing with Bellamy. I’m a fugitive from the CIA. Bellamy led the way around a corner, where the two men began ascending a wide staircase that was cordoned off with orange pylons. Langdon’s daybag w eighed him down as he climbed. “The stone pyramid,” he said, “I still don’t understand—” “Not here,” Bellamy interrupted. “We’ll examine it in the light. I know a safe place.” Langdon doubted such a place existed for anyone who had just physically assaulted the director of the CIA ’ s"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Office of Security. As the two men reached the top of the stairs, they entered a wide hallway of Italian marble, stucco, a nd gold leaf. The hall was lined with eight pairs of statue s—all depicting the goddess Minerva. Bellamy presse d on, leading Langdon eastward, through a vaulted archway , into a far grander space. Even in the dim, after-hours lighting, the library’ s great hall shone with the classical grandeur of a n opulent European palace. Seventy-five feet overhead, staine d-glass skylights glistened between paneled beams adorned with rare “aluminum leaf”—a metal that was considered to be more precious than gold at one tim e. Beneath that, a stately course of paired pillars li ned the second-floor balcony, accessible by two mag nificent curling staircases whose newel posts supported gian t bronze female figures raising torches of enlighte nment. In a bizarre attempt to reflect this theme of moder n enlightenment and yet stay within the decorative register of Renaissance architecture, the stairway banisters had been carved with cupidlike putti portrayed as modern scientists. An angelic electrician holding a telephone? A cheru bic entomologist with a specimen box? Langdon wondered what Bernini would have thought. “We’ll talk over here,” Bellamy said, leading Langd on past the bulletproof display cases that containe d the library’s two most valuable books—the Giant Bible o f Mainz, handwritten in the 1450s, and America’s co py of the Gutenberg Bible, one of only three perfect v ellum copies in the world. Fittingly, the vaulted c eiling overhead bore John White Alexander’s six-panel pain ting titled The Evolution of the Book. Bellamy strode directly to a pair of elegant double doors at the center rear of the east-corridor wall . Langdon knew what room lay beyond those doors, but it seeme d a strange choice for a conversation. Notwithstand ing the irony of talking in a space filled with “Silenc e Please” signs, this room hardly seemed like a “sa fe place.” Located dead center of the library’s cruciform-shap ed floor plan, this chamber served as the heart of the building. Hiding in here was like breaking into a c athedral and hiding on the altar. Nonetheless, Bellamy unlocked the doors, stepped in to the darkness beyond, and groped for the lights. When he flipped the switch, one of America’s great archi tectural masterpieces seemed to materialize out of thin air. The famous reading room was a feast for the senses. A voluminous octagon rose 160 feet at its center, its eight sides finished in chocolate-brown Tennessee m arble, cream-colored Siena marble, and apple-red Algerian marble. Because it was lit from eight angl es, no shadows fell anywhere, creating the effect t hat the room itself was glowing. “Some say it’s the most striking room in Washington ,” Bellamy said, ushering Langdon inside. Maybe in the whole world, Langdon thought as he stepped across the threshold . As always, his gaze first ascended straight up to the towering central collar , where rays of arabesque coffers curled down the d ome to an upper balcony. Encircling the room, sixteen bron ze “portrait” statues peered down from the balustra de. Beneath them, a stunning arcade of archways formed a lower balcony. Down at floor level, three concent ric circles of burnished wood desks radiated out from t he massive octagonal circulation desk. Langdon returned his focus to Bellamy, who was now propping the room’s double doors wide open. “I thought we were hiding ,” Langdon said, confused. “If anyone enters the building,” Bellamy said, “I w ant to hear them coming.” “But won’t they find us instantly in here?” “No matter where we hide, they’ll find us. But if anyone corners us in this building, you’ll be very glad I chose this room.” Langdon had no idea why, but Bellamy apparently was n’t looking to discuss it. He was already on the mo ve toward the center of the room, where he selected on e of the available reading desks, pulled up two cha irs, and flipped on the reading light. Then he motioned to L angdon’s bag. "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"“ Okay, Professor, let ’ s have a closer look. ” Not wanting to risk scratching its polished surface with a rough piece of granite, Langdon hoisted his entire bag onto the desk and unzipped it, folding the side s all the way down to reveal the pyramid inside. Wa rren Bellamy adjusted the reading lamp and studied the p yramid carefully. He ran his fingers over the unusu al engraving. “I assume you recognize this language?” Bellamy ask ed. “Of course,” Langdon replied, eyeing the sixteen sy mbols. Known as the Freemason’s Cipher, this encoded langu age had been used for private communication among early Masonic brothers. The encryption method had b een abandoned long ago for one simple reason—it was much too easy to break. Most of the students in Lan gdon’s senior symbology seminar could break this co de in about five minutes. Langdon, with a pencil and p aper, could do it in under sixty seconds. The notorious breakability of this centuries-old en cryption scheme now presented a couple of paradoxes . First, the claim that Langdon was the only person o n earth who could break it was absurd. Second, for Sato to suggest that a Masonic cipher was an issue of na tional security was like her suggesting our nuclear launch codes were encrypted with a Cracker Jack decoder ri ng. Langdon was still struggling to believe any of it. This pyramid is a map ? Pointing to the lost wisdom of the ages? “Robert,” Bellamy said, his tone grave. “Did Direct or Sato tell you why she is so interested in this?” Langdon shook his head. “Not specifically. She just kept saying it was an issue of national security. I assume she’s lying.” “Perhaps,” Bellamy said, rubbing the back of his ne ck. He seemed to be struggling with something. “But there is a far more troubling possibility.” He turn ed to look Langdon in the eye. “It’s possible that Director Sato has discovered this pyramid’s true potential.” CHAPTER 47 "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" The blackness engulfing Katherine Solomon felt absolute. Having fled the familiar safety of the carpet, she was now groping blindly forward, her outstretched h ands touching only empty space as she staggered deeper i nto the desolate void. Beneath her stockinged feet, the endless expanse of cold cement felt like a frozen l ake . . . a hostile environment from which she now needed to escape. No longer smelling ethanol, she stopped and waited in darkness. Standing dead still, she listened, wil ling her heart to stop pounding so loudly. The heavy footste ps behind her seemed to have stopped. Did I lose him? Katherine closed her eyes and tried to imagine wher e she was. Which direction did I run? Where is the door? It was no use. She was so turned around now that th e exit could be anywhere. Fear, Katherine had once heard, acted as a stimulan t, sharpening the mind’s ability to think. Right no w, however, her fear had turned her mind into a tumbli ng torrent of panic and confusion. Even if I find the exit, I can’t get out. Her key card had been lost when she’d shed her lab coat. Her only hope seemed to be that she was now a needle in a haystack—a single point on a thirty-thousand-square-foot grid. Despite the overwhelming urge to flee, Katherine’s analytical m ind told her instead to make the only logical move— no move at all. Stay still. Don’t make a sound. The security guard was on his way, and for some un known reason, her attacker smelled strongly of ethanol. If he gets too close, I’ll know it. As Katherine stood in silence, her mind raced over what Langdon had said. Your brother . . . he’s been taken. She felt a bead of cold sweat materialize on her ar m and trickle down, toward the cell phone still cle nched in her right hand. It was a danger she had forgotten t o consider. If the phone rang, it would give away h er position, and she could not turn it off without ope ning it and illuminating the display. Set down the phone . . . and move away from it. But it was too late. The smell of ethanol approache d on her right. And now it grew stronger. Katherine struggled to stay calm, forcing herself to override the instinct to run. Carefully, slowly, sh e took one step to her left. The faint rustle of he r clothing was apparently all her attacker needed. She heard h im lunge, and the smell of ethanol washed over her as a powerful hand grabbed at her shoulder. She twisted away, raw terror gripping her. Mathematical probabi lity went out the window, and Katherine broke into a bli nd sprint. She veered hard to the left, changing co urse, dashing blindly now into the void. The wall materialized out of nowhere. Katherine hit it hard, knocking the wind from her l ungs. Pain blossomed in her arm and shoulder, but s he managed to stay on her feet. The oblique angle at w hich she had collided with the wall had spared her the full force of the blow, but it was little comfort now. T he sound had echoed everywhere. He knows where I am. Doubled over in pain, she turned her head and stare d out into the blackness of the pod and sensed him staring back at her. Change your location. Now! Still struggling to catch her breath, she began mov ing down the wall, touching her left hand quietly t o each exposed steel stud as she passed. Stay along the wall. Slip past him before he corner s you. In her right hand, Katherine still clutched her cell phone, ready to h url it as a projectile if need be. Katherine was in no way prepared for the sound she heard next—the clear rustle of clothing directly in front of her . . . against the wall. She froze, stock-sti ll, and stopped breathing. How could he be on the wall already? She felt a faint puff of air, laced with the stenc h of ethanol. He’s moving down the wall toward me! Katherine backed up several steps. Then, turning si lently 180 degrees, she began moving quickly in the opposite direction down the wall. She moved twenty feet or so when the impossible happened. Once again , directly in front of her, along the wall, she heard the rustling sound of clothing. Then came the same puff of air and the smell of ethanol. Katherine Solomon fro ze in place."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" My God, he ’s everywhere! Bare-chested, Mal’akh stared into the darkness. The smell of ethanol on his sleeves had proven a li ability, and so he had transformed it into an asset , stripping off his shirt and jacket and using them t o help corner his prey. Throwing his jacket against the wall to the right, he had heard Katherine stop short and change direction. Now, having thrown his shirt ahe ad to the left, Mal’akh had heard her stop again. He had effectively corralled Katherine against the wall by establishing points beyond which she dared not pass . Now he waited, ears straining in the silence. She has only one direction she can move—directly to ward me. Even so, Mal’akh heard nothing. Either Katherine wa s paralyzed with fear, or she had decided to stand still and wait for help to enter Pod 5. Either way she loses. Nobody would be entering Pod 5 anytime soon; Mal’akh had disabled the outer keypad with a very c rude, yet very effective, technique. After using Tr ish’s key card, he had rammed a single dime deep into the key-card slot to prevent any other key-card use wi thout first dismantling the entire mechanism. You and I are alone, Katherine . . . for as long as this takes. Mal’akh inched silently forward, listening for any movement. Katherine Solomon would die tonight in th e darkness of her brother’s museum. A poetic end. Mal ’akh looked forward to sharing the news of Katherin e’s death with her brother. The old man’s anguish would be long-awaited revenge. Suddenly in the darkness, to Mal’akh’s great surpri se, he saw a tiny glow in the distance and realized Katherine had just made a deadly error in judgment. She’s phoning for help?! The electronic display that had just flickered to life was hovering waist high, abo ut twenty yards ahead, like a shining beacon on a v ast ocean of black. Mal’akh had been prepared to wait K atherine out, but now he wouldn’t have to. Mal’akh sprang into motion, racing toward the hover ing light, knowing he had to reach her before she c ould complete her call for help. He was there in a matte r of seconds, and he lunged, arms outstretched on e ither side of her glowing cell phone, preparing to engulf her. Mal’akh’s fingers jammed into a solid wall, bending backward and almost breaking. His head collided ne xt, crashing into a steel beam. He cried out in pain as he crumpled beside the wall. Cursing, he clambered back to his feet, pulling himself up by the waist-high, horizontal strut on which Katherine Solomon had cle verly placed her open cell phone. Katherine was running again, this time with no conc ern for the noise her hand was making as it bounced rhythmically off the evenly spaced metal studs of P od 5. Run! If she followed the wall all the way around the pod, she knew that sooner or later she would feel t he exit door. Where the hell is the guard? The even spacing of the studs continued as she ran with her left hand on the sidewall and her right ou t in front of her for protection. When will I reach the corner? The sidewall seemed to go on and on, but suddenly the rhythm of the studs was broken. Her left hand h it empty space for several long strides, and then t he studs began again. Katherine slammed on the brakes and ba cked up, feeling her way across the smooth metal panel. Why are there no studs here? She could hear her attacker lumbering loudly after her now, groping his way down the wall in her direc tion. Even so, it was a different sound that scared Kathe rine even more—the distant rhythmic banging of a security guard pounding his flashlight against the Pod 5 door. The guard can’t get in? While the thought was terrifying, the location of his banging—diagonally to her right—instantly o riented Katherine. She could now picture where in Pod 5 she was located. The visual flash brought with it an"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"unexpected realization. She now knew what this flat panel on the wall was. Every pod was equipped with a specimen bay—a giant movable wall that could be retracted for transporti ng oversize specimens in and out of the pods. Like tho se of an airplane hangar, this door was mammoth, an d Katherine in her wildest dreams had never imagined needing to open it. At the moment, though, it seeme d like her only hope. Is it even operable? Katherine fumbled blindly in the blackness, searchi ng the bay door until she found the large metal han dle. Grasping it, she threw her weight backward, trying to slide open the door. Nothing. She tried again. I t didn’t budge. She could hear her attacker closing faster now, hom ing in on the sounds of her efforts. The bay door is locked! Wild with panic, she slid her hands all over the d oor, feeling the surface for any latch or lever. Sh e suddenly hit what felt like a vertical pole. She fo llowed it down to the floor, crouching, and could f eel it was inserted into a hole in the cement. A security rod! She stood up, grabbed the pole, and, lifting with her legs, slid the rod up and out of the hole. He ’s almost here! Katherine groped now for the handle, found it again , and heaved back on it with all her might. The mas sive panel seemed barely to move, and yet a sliver of mo onlight now sliced into Pod 5. Katherine pulled aga in. The shaft of light from outside the building grew w ider. A little more! She pulled one last time, sensing her attacker was now only a few feet away. Leaping toward the light, Katherine wriggled her sl ender body sideways into the opening. A hand materialized in the darkness, clawing at her, tryin g to pull her back inside. She heaved herself throu gh the opening, pursued by a massive bare arm that was cov ered with tattooed scales. The terrifying arm writh ed like an angry snake trying to seize her. Katherine spun and fled down the long, pale outer w all of Pod 5. The bed of loose stones that surround ed the entire perimeter of the SMSC cut into her stockinge d feet as she ran, but she pressed on, heading for the main entrance. The night was dark, but with her eyes ful ly dilated from the utter blackness of Pod 5, she c ould see perfectly—almost as if it were daylight. Behind her , the heavy bay door ground open, and she heard hea vy footsteps accelerating in pursuit down the side of the building. The footsteps seemed impossibly fast. I ’ll never outrun him to the main entrance. She knew her Volvo was closer, but even that would be too far. I ’m not going to make it. Then Katherine realized she had one final card to p lay. As she neared the corner of Pod 5, she could hear h is footsteps quickly overtaking her in the darkness . Now or never. Instead of rounding the corner, Katherine suddenly cut hard to her left, away from the building, out onto the grass. As she did so, she closed her eyes tightly, placed both hands over her face, and began running totally blind across the lawn. The motion-activated security lighting that blazed to life around Pod 5 transformed night into day ins tantly. Katherine heard a scream of pain behind her as the brilliant floodlights seared into her assailant’s h yper dilated pupils with over twenty-five- million candlepower of light. She could hear him st umbling on the loose stones. Katherine kept her eyes tightly closed, trusting he rself on the open lawn. When she sensed she was far enough away from the building and the lights, she o pened her eyes, corrected her course, and ran like hell through the dark. Her Volvo’s keys were exactly where she always left them, in the center console. Breathless, she seize d the keys in her trembling hands and found the ignition. The engine roared to life, and her headlights flip ped on,"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"illuminating a terrifying sight. A hideous form raced toward her. Katherine froze for an instant. The creature caught in her headlights was a bald an d bare-chested animal, its skin covered with tattoo ed scales, symbols, and text. He bellowed as he ran in to the glare, raising his hands before his eyes lik e a cave- dwelling beast seeing sunlight for the first time. She reached for the gearshift but suddenly he was t here, hurling his elbow through her side window, sending a shower of safety glass into her lap. A massive scale-covered arm burst through her windo w, groping half blind, finding her neck. She threw the car in reverse, but her attacker had latched on to her throat, squeezing with unimaginable force. She turned her head in an attempt to escape his grasp, and sud denly she was staring at his face. Three dark strip es, like fingernail scratches, had torn through his face mak eup to reveal the tattoos beneath. His eyes were wi ld and ruthless. “I should have killed you ten years ago,” he growle d. “The night I killed your mother.” As his words registered, Katherine was seized by a horrifying memory: that feral look in his eyes—she had seen it before. It’s him. She would have screamed had it not been for the vi selike grip around her neck. She smashed her foot onto the accelerator, and the car lurched backward, almost snapping her neck as h e was dragged beside her car. The Volvo careened up an in clined median, and Katherine could feel her neck ab out to give way beneath his weight. Suddenly tree branc hes were scraping the side of her car, slapping thr ough the side windows, and the weight was gone. The car burst through the evergreens and out into t he upper parking lot, where Katherine slammed on th e brakes. Below her, the half-naked man clambered to his feet, staring into her headlights. With a terri fying calm, he raised a menacing scale-covered arm and po inted directly at her. Katherine’s blood coursed with raw fear and hatred as she spun the wheel and hit the gas. Seconds late r, she was fishtailing out onto Silver Hill Road. CHAPTER 48 In the heat of the moment, Capitol police officer Nuñez h ad seen no option but to help the Capitol Architect and Robert Langdon escape. Now, however, back in th e basement police headquarters, Nuñez could see the storm clouds gathering fast. Chief Trent Anderson was holding an ice pack to his head while another officer was tending to Sato’s bruises. Both of them were standing with the video surveillance team, reviewing digital playback files in an attempt to locate Langdon and Bellamy. “Check the playback on every hallway and exit,” Sat o demanded. “I want to know where they went!” Nuñez felt ill as he looked on. He knew it would be only a matter of minutes before they found the rig ht video clip and learned the truth. I helped them escape. Making matters worse was the arrival of a four-man CIA field team that was now staging nearby, preppin g to go after Langdon and Bellamy. These guys looke d nothing like the Capitol Police. These guys were de ad-serious soldiers . . . black camouflage, night v ision, futuristic - looking handguns."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" Nuñez felt like he would throw up. Making up his mi nd, he motioned discreetly to Chief Anderson. “ A word, Chief?” “What is it?” Anderson followed Nuñez into the hall . “Chief, I made a bad mistake,” Nuñez said, breaking a sweat. “I’m sorry, and I’m resigning.” You’ll fire me in a few minutes anyway. “I beg your pardon?” Nuñez swallowed hard. “Earlier, I saw Langdon and Architect Bellamy in th e visitor center on their way out of the building.” “What?!” Anderson bellowed. “Why didn’t you say som ething?!” “The Architect told me not to say a word.” “You work for me, goddamm it!” Anderson’s voice echoed down the corr idor. “Bellamy smashed my head into a wall, for Christ’s sake!” Nuñez handed Anderson the key that the Architect ha d given him. “What is this?” Anderson demanded. “A key to the new tunnel under Independence Avenue. Architect Bellamy had it. That’s how they escaped. ” Anderson stared down at the key, speechless. Sato poked her head out into the hallway, eyes prob ing. “What’s going on out here?” Nuñez felt himself go pale. Anderson was still hold ing the key, and Sato clearly had seen it. As the h ideous little woman drew near, Nuñez improvised as best as he could, hoping to protect his chief. “I found a key on the floor in the subbasement. I was just asking Chi ef Anderson if he knew what it might go to.” Sato arrived, eyeing the key. “And does the chief k now?” Nuñez glanced up at Anderson, who was clearly weigh ing all his options before speaking. Finally, the c hief shook his head. “Not offhand. I’d have to check the —” “Don’t bother,” Sato said. “This key unlocks a tunn el off the visitor center.” “Really?” Anderson said. “How do you know that?” “We just found the surveillance clip. Officer Nuñez here helped Langdon and Bellamy escape and then relocked that tunnel door behind them. Bellamy gave Nuñez that key.” Anderson turned to Nuñez with a flare of anger. “Is this true?!” Nuñez nodded vigorously, doing his best to play alo ng. “I’m sorry, sir. The Architect told me not to tell a soul!” “I don’t give a damn what the Architect told you!” Anderson yelled. “I expec t—” “Shut up, Trent,” Sato snapped. “You’re both lousy liars. Save it for your CIA inquisition.” She snatc hed the Architect’s tunnel key from Anderson. “You’re done h ere.” "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 49 Robert Langdon hung up his cell phone, feeling increasingly worri ed. Katherine’s not answering her cell? Katherine had promised to call him as soon as she w as safely out of the lab and on her way to meet him here, but she had never done so. Bellamy sat beside Langdon at the reading-room desk . He, too, had just made a call, his to an individu al he claimed could offer them sanctuary—a safe place to hide. Unfortunately, this person was not answering either, and so Bellamy had left an urgent message, telling him to call Langdon’s cell phone right away . “I’ll keep trying,” he said to Langdon, “but for th e moment, we’ re on our own. And we need to discuss a plan for this pyramid.” The pyramid. For Langdon, the spectacular backdrop of the readi ng room had all but disappeared, his world constricting now to include only what was directly in front of him—a stone pyramid, a sealed package containing a capstone, and an elegant African Ameri can man who had materialized out of the darkness an d rescued him from the certainty of a CIA interrogati on. Langdon had expected a modicum of sanity from the A rchitect of the Capitol, but now it seemed Warren Bellamy was no more rational than the madman claimi ng Peter was in purgatory. Bellamy was insisting th is stone pyramid was, in fact, the Masonic Pyramid of legend. An ancient map? That guides us to powerful wisdom? “Mr. Bellamy,” Langdon said politely, “this idea th at there exists some kind of ancient knowledge that can imbue men with great power . . . I simply can’t tak e it seriously.” Bellamy’s eyes looked both disappointed and earnest , making Langdon’s skepticism all the more awkward. “Yes, Professor, I had imagined you might feel this way, but I suppose I should not be surprised. You are an outsider looking in. There exist certain Masonic re alities that you will perceive as myth because you are not properly initiated and prepared to understand them. ” Now Langdon felt patronized. I wasn’t a member of Odysseus’s crew, but I’m certa in the Cyclops is a myth. “Mr. Bellamy, even if the legend is true . . . this pyramid cannot possibly be the Masonic Pyramid.” “No?” Bellamy ran a finger across the Masonic ciphe r on the stone. “It looks to me like it fits the de scription perfectly. A stone pyramid with a shining metal cap stone, which, according to Sato’s X-ray, is exactly what Peter entrusted to you.” Bellamy picked up the litt le cube-shaped package, weighing it in his hand. “This stone pyramid is less than a foot tall,” Lang don countered. “Every version of the story I’ve eve r heard describes the Masonic Pyramid as enormous.” Bellamy had clearly anticipated this point. “As you know, the legend speaks of a pyramid rising so hig h that God Himself can reach out and touch it.” “Exactly.” “I can see your dilemma, Professor. However, both t he Ancient Mysteries and Masonic philosophy celebra te the potentiality of God within each of us. Symbolic ally speaking, one could claim that anything within reach of an enlightened man . . . is within reach of God. ” Langdon felt unswayed by the wordplay. "},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"“ Even the Bible concurs, ” Bellamy said. “ If we accept, as Genesis tells us, that ‘ God created man in his own image,’ then we also must accept what this implies—that mankind was not created inferior to God. In Luke 17:20 we are told, ‘The kingdom of God is within yo u.’ ” “I’m sorry, but I don’t know any Christians who con sider themselves God’s equal .” “Of course not,” Bellamy said, his tone hardening. “ Because most Christians want it both ways. They wan t to be able to proudly declare they are believers in th e Bible and yet simply ignore those parts they find too difficult or too inconvenient to believe.” Langdon made no response. “Anyhow,” Bellamy said, “the Masonic Pyramid’s age-o ld description as being tall enough to be touched b y God . . . this has long led to misinterpretations a bout its size. Conveniently, it keeps academics lik e yourself insisting the pyramid is a legend, and nobody searc hes for it.” Langdon looked down at the stone pyramid. “I apolog ize that I’m frustrating you,” he said. “I’ve simpl y always thought of the Masonic Pyramid as a myth.” “Does it not seem perfectly fitting to you that a m ap created by stonemasons would be carved in stone? Throughout history, our most important guideposts h ave always been carved in stone—including the table ts God gave Moses—Ten Commandments to guide our human conduct.” “I understand, and yet it is always referred to as the Legend of the Masonic Pyramid. Legend implies it is mythical.” “Yes, legend .” Bellamy chuckled. “I’m afraid you’re suffering f rom the same problem Moses had.” “I’m sorry?” Bellamy looked almost amused as he turned in his se at, glancing up at the second- tier balcony, where sixteen bronze statues peered down at them. “Do you see Mos es?” Langdon gazed up at the library’s celebrated statue of Moses. “Yes.” “He has horns.” “I’m aware of that.” “But do you know why he has horns?” Like most teachers, Langdon did not enjoy being lec tured to. The Moses above them had horns for the sa me reason thousands of Christian images of Moses had horns—a mistransl ation of the book of Exodus. The original Hebrew text described Moses as having “karan ’ohr panav” —“facial skin that glowed with rays of light”— but when the Roman Catholic Church created the offi cial Latin translation of the Bible, the translator bungled Moses’s description, rendering it as “cornuta esset facies sua,” meaning “his face was horned.” From that moment on, artists and sculptors, fearing reprisals if they were not true to the Gospels, be gan depicting Moses with horns. “It was a simple mistake,” Langdon replied. “A mist ranslation by Saint Jerome around four hundred A.D. ” Bellamy looked impressed. “Exactly. A mistranslatio n. And the result is . . . poor Moses is now missha pen for all history.” “Misshapen” was a nice way to put it. Langdon, as a child, had been terrified when he saw Michelangelo ’s diabolical “horned Moses”—the centerpiece of Rome’s Basilica of St. Peter in Chains. “I mention the horned Moses,” Bellamy now said, “to illustrate how a single word, misunderstood, can rewrite history. ”"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" You’re preaching to the choir, Langdon thought, having learned the lesson firstha nd in Paris a number of years back. SanGreal: Holy Grail. SangReal: Royal Blood. “In the case of the Masonic Pyramid,” Bellamy conti nued, “people heard whispers about a ‘legend.’ And the idea stuck. The Legend of the Masonic Pyramid sounded like a myth. But th e word legend was referring to something else. It had been misconstrued. Much like the word talisman. ” He smiled. “Language can be very adept at hiding the truth.” “That’s true, but you’re losing me here.” “Robert, the Masonic Pyramid is a map . And like every map, it has a legend —a key that tells you how to read it.” Bellamy took the cube-shaped package and held it up. “Don’t you see? This capstone is the legend to the pyramid. It is the key that tells you how to read the most powerful artifact on earth . . . a m ap that unveils the hiding place of mankind’s greatest trea sure—the lost wisdom of the ages.” Langdon fell silent. “I humbly submit,” Bellamy said, “that your towerin g Masonic Pyramid is only this . . . a modest stone whose golden capstone reaches high enough to be tou ched by God. High enough that an enlightened man ca n reach down and touch it.” Silence hung between the two men for several second s. Langdon felt an unexpected pulse of excitement as h e looked down at the pyramid, seeing it in a new li ght. His eyes moved again to the Masonic cipher. “But th is code . . . it seems so . . .” “Simple?” Langdon nodded. “Almost anyone could decipher this.” Bellamy smiled and retrieved a pencil and paper for Langdon. “Then perhaps you should enlighten us?” Langdon felt uneasy about reading the code, and yet considering the circumstances, it seemed a minor betrayal of Peter’s trust. Moreover, whatever the e ngraving said, he could not imagine that it unveile d a secret hiding place of anything at all . . . much l ess that of one of history’s greatest treasures. Langdon accepted the pencil from Bellamy and tapped it on his chin as he studied the cipher. The code was so simple that he barely needed pencil and paper. E ven so, he wanted to ensure he made no mistakes, an d so he dutifully put pencil to paper and wrote down the most common decryption key for a Masonic cipher. T he key consisted of four grids—two plain and two dotte d—with the alphabet running through them in order. Each letter of the alphabet was now positioned insi de a uniquely shaped “enclosure” or “pen.” The shap e of each letter’s enclosure became the symbol for that letter. The scheme was so simple, it was almost infantile. "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" Langdon double- checked his handiwork. Feeling confident the decryp tion key was correct, he now turned his attention back to the code inscribed on the pyramid . To decipher it, all he had to do was to find the matching shape on his decryption key and write down the lett er inside it. The first character on the pyramid looked like a do wn arrow or a chalice. Langdon quickly found the ch alice- shaped segment on the decryption key. It was locate d in the lower left-hand corner and enclosed the le tter S . Langdon wrote down S . The next symbol on the pyramid was a dotted square missing its right side. That shape on the decryptio n grid enclosed the letter O . He wrote down O . "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The third symbol was a simple square, which enclose d the letter E . Langdon wrote down E . S O E . . . He continued, picking up speed until he had complet ed the entire grid. Now, as he gazed down at his finished translation, Langdon let out a puzzled sigh. Hardly what I’d call a eureka moment. Bellamy’s face showed the hint of a smile. “ As you know, Professor, the Ancient Mysteries are r eserved only for the truly enlightened.” “Right,” Langdon said, frowning. Apparently, I don’t qualify. CHAPTER 50 In a basement office deep inside CIA headquarters in Langley, Vi rginia, the same sixteen- character Masonic cipher glowed brightly on a high-definition compute r monitor. Senior OS analyst Nola Kaye sat alone an d studied the image that had been e-mailed to her ten minutes ago by her boss, Director Inoue Sato. Is this some kind of joke? Nola knew it was not, of course; Director Sato had no sense of humor, and the events of tonight were anything but a joking matter . Nola’s high-level clearance within the CIA’s all- seeing Office of Security had opened her eyes to the shado w worlds of power. But what Nola had witnessed in t he last twenty-four hours had changed her impressions forever of the secrets that powerful men kept. “Yes, Director,” Nola now said, cradling the phone on her shoulder as she talked to Sato. “The engravi ng is indeed the Masonic cipher. However, the cleartext i s meaningless. It appears to be a grid of random le tters.” She gazed down at her decryption. “It must say something, ” Sato insisted. "},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"“ Not unless it has a second layer of encryption that I ’ m not aware of. ” “Any guesses?” Sato asked. “It’s a grid-based matrix, so I could run the usual —Vigenère, grilles, trellises, and so forth— but no promises, especially if it’s a onetime pad.” “Do what you can. And do it fast. How about the X-r ay?” Nola swiveled her chair to a second system, which d isplayed a standard security X-ray of someone’s bag. Sato had requested information on what appeared to be a small pyramid inside a cube-shaped box. Normally, a two-inch-tall object would not be an issue of national security unless it was made of enriched plutonium. This one was not . It was made of something almost equally startling . “Image-density analysis was conclusive,” Nola said. “Nineteen-point-three grams per cubic centimeter. It’s pure gold. Very, very valuable.” “Anything else?” “Actually, yes. The density scan picked up minor ir regularities on the surface of the gold pyramid. It turns out the gold is engraved with text.” “Really?” Sato sounded hopeful. “What does it say?” “I can’t tell yet. The inscription is extremely fai nt. I’ m trying to enhance with filters, but the resolutio n on the X-ray is not great.” “Okay, keep trying. Call me when you have something .” “Yes, ma’am.” “And, Nola?” Sato’s tone turned ominous. “As with e verything you have learned in the last twenty-four hours, the images of the stone pyramid and gold cap stone are classified at the highest levels of secur ity. You are to consult no one. You report to me directly. I want to make sure that is clear.” “Of course, ma’am.” “Good. Keep me posted.” Sato hung up. Nola rubbed her eyes and looked blearily back at he r computer screens. She had not slept in over thirt y -six hours, and she knew damn well she would not sleep a gain until this crisis had reached its conclusion. Whatever that may be. Back at the Capitol Visitor Center, four black-clad CIA field-op specialists stood at the entrance to the tunnel, peering hungrily down the dimly lit shaft l ike a pack of dogs eager for the hunt. Sato approached, having just hung up from a call. “ Gentlemen,” she said, still holding the Architect’s key, “are your mission parameters clear?” “Affirmative,” the lead agent replied. “We have two targets. The first is an engraved stone pyramid, approximately one foot tall. The second is a smalle r, cube-shaped package, approximately two inches ta ll. Both were last seen in Robert Langdon’s shoulder ba g.” “Correct,” Sato said. “These two items must be retr ieved quickly and intact. Do you have any questions ?” “Parameters for use of force?” "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Sato ’ s shoulder was still throbbing from where Bellamy h ad struck her with a bone. “ As I said, it is of critical importance that these items be retrieved.” “Understood.” The four men turned and headed into t he darkness of the tunnel. Sato lit a cigarette and watched them disappear. CHAPTER 51 Katherine Solomon had always been a prudent driver, but now she was pushing her Volvo at over ninety as she fled blindly up the Suitland Parkway. Her tremb ling foot had been lodged on the accelerator for a full mile before her panic began to lift. She now realiz ed her uncontrollable shivering was no longer solel y from fear. I ’m freezing. The wintry night air was gushing through her shatte red window, buffeting her body like an arctic wind. Her stockinged feet were numb, and she reached down for her spare pair of shoes, which she kept beneath th e passenger seat. As she did, she felt a stab of pain from the bruise on her throat, where the powerful hand had latched on to her neck. The man who had smashed through her window bore no resemblance to the blond-haired gentleman whom Katherine knew as Dr. Christopher Abaddon. His thic k hair and smooth, tanned complexion had disappeare d. His shaved head, bare chest, and makeup-smeared fac e had been unveiled as a terrifying tapestry of tat toos. She heard his voice again, whispering to her in the howl of wind outside her broken window. Katherine, I should have killed you years ago . . . the night I killed your mother. Katherine shivered, feeling no doubt. That was him. She had never forgotten the look of fiendish viole nce in his eyes. Nor had she ever forgotten the sound of h er brother’s single gunshot, which had killed this man, propelling him off a high ledge into the frozen riv er below, where he plummeted through the ice and ne ver resurfaced. Investigators had searched for weeks, n ever finding his body, and finally decided it had b een washed away by the current out to the Chesapeake Ba y. They were wrong, she now knew. He is still alive. And he ’s back. Katherine felt angst-ridden as the memories flooded back. It was almost exactly ten years ago. Christm as Day. Katherine, Peter, and their mother—her entire family—were gathered at their sprawling stone mansi on in Potomac, nestled on a two-hundred-acre wooded es tate with its own river running through it. As was tradition, their mother worked diligently in the kitchen, rejoicing in the holiday custom of co oking for her two children. Even at seventy-five years of age, Isabel Solomon was an exuberant cook, and ton ight the mouthwatering smells of roast venison, parsnip gravy, and garlic mashed potatoes wafted through th e house. While Mother prepared the feast, Katherine a nd her brother relaxed in the conservatory, discuss ing Katherine’s latest fascination—a new field called N oetic Science. An unlikely fusion of modern particl e physics and ancient mysticism, Noetics had absolute ly captivated Katherine’s imagination. Physics meets philosophy. "},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Katherine told Peter about some of the experiments she was dreaming up, and she could see in his eyes that he was intrigued. Katherine felt particularly pleas ed to give her brother something positive to think about this Christmas, since the holiday had also become a pain ful reminder of a terrible tragedy. Peter ’s son, Zachary. Katherine’s nephew’s twenty-first birthday had been his last. The family had been through a nightmare, and it seemed that her brother was only now finally lea rning how to laugh again. Zachary had been a late bloomer, frail and awkward, a rebellious and angry teenager. Despite his deepl y loving and privileged upbringing, the boy seemed de termined to detach himself from the Solomon “establishment.” He was kicked out of prep school, partied hard with the “celebrati,” and shunned his parents’ exhaustive attempts to provide him firm an d loving guidance. He broke Peter ’s heart . Shortly before Zachary’s eighteenth birthday, Kathe rine had sat down with her mother and brother and listened to them debating whether or not to withhol d Zachary’s inheritance until he was more mature. T he Solomon inheritance—a centuries-old tradition in th e family—bequeathed a staggeringly generous piece o f the Solomon wealth to every Solomon child on his or her eighteenth birthday. The Solomons believed that an inheritance was more helpful at the beginning of someone’s life than at the end. Moreover, placi ng large pieces of the Solomon fortune in the hands of eager young descendants had been the key to growing the family’s dynastic wealth. In this case, however, Katherine’s mother argued th at it was dangerous to give Peter’s troubled son su ch a large sum of money. Peter disagreed. “The Solomon inheritance,” her brother had said, “i s a family tradition that should not be broken. Thi s money may well force Zachary to be more responsible .” Sadly, her brother had been wrong. The moment Zachary received the money, he broke fro m the family, disappearing from the house without taking any of his belongings. He surfaced a few mon ths later in the tabloids: TRUST FUND PLAYBOY LIVING EUROPEAN HIGH LIFE . The tabloids took joy in documenting Zachary’s spoi led life of debauchery. The photos of wild parties on yachts and drunken disco stupors were hard for the Solomons to take, but the photos of their wayward t een turned from tragic to frightening when the papers r eported Zachary had been caught carrying cocaine ac ross a border in Eastern Europe: SOLOMON MILLIONAIRE IN TURKISH PRISON . The prison, they learned, was called Soganlik—a bru tal F-class detention center located in the Kartal district outside of Istanbul. Peter Solomon, fearing for his son’s safety, flew to Turkey to retrieve him. Kath erine’s distraught brother returned empty-handed, having be en forbidden even to visit with Zachary. The only promising news was that Solomon’s influential conta cts at the U.S. State Department were working on getting him extradited as quickly as possible. Two days later, however, Peter received a horrifyin g international phone call. The next morning, headl ines blared: SOLOMON HEIR MURDERED IN PRISON . The prison photos were horrific, and the media call ously aired them all, even long after the Solomons’ private burial ceremony. Peter’s wife never forgave him for failing to free Zachary, and their marriag e came to an end six months later. Peter had been alone ev er since. It was years later that Katherine, Peter, and their mother, Isabel, were gathered quietly for Christma s. The pain was still a presence in their family, but merc ifully it was fading with each passing year. The pl easant rattle of pots and pans now echoed from the kitchen as their mother prepared the traditional feast. Ou t in the conservatory, Peter and Katherine were enjoying a b aked Brie and relaxed holiday conversation."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" Then came an utterly unexpected sound. “Hello, Solomons,” an airy voice said behind them. Startled, Katherine and her brother spun to see an enormous muscular figure stepping into the conserva tory. He wore a black ski mask that covered all of his fa ce except his eyes, which shone with feral ferocity . Peter was on his feet in an instant. “Who are you?! How did you get in here?!” “I knew your little boy, Zachary, in prison. He tol d me where this key was hidden.” The stranger held u p an old key and grinned like a beast. “Right before I b ludgeoned him to death.” Peter’s mouth fell open. A pistol appeared, aimed directly at Peter’s chest. “Sit.” Peter fell back into his chair. As the man moved into the room, Katherine was froze n in place. Behind his mask, the man’s eyes were wi ld like those of a rabid animal. “Hey!” Peter yelled, as if trying to warn their mot her in the kitchen. “Whoever you are, take what you want, and get out!” The man leveled his gun at Peter’s chest. “And what is it you think I want?” “Just tell me how much,” Solomon said. “We don’t hav e money in the house, but I can—” The monster laughed. “Do not insult me. I have not come for money. I have come tonight for Zachary’ s other birthright.” He grinned. “He told me about the pyra mid.” Pyramid? Katherine thought in bewildered terror. What pyramid? Her brother was defiant. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” “Don’t play dumb with me! Zachary told me what you keep in your study vault. I want it. Now.” “Whatever Zachary told you, he was confused,” Peter said. “I don’t know what you’re talking about!” “No?” The intruder turned and aimed the gun at Kath erine’s face. “How about now?” Peter’s eyes filled with terror. “You must believe me! I don’t know what it is you want!” “Lie to me one more time,” he said, still aiming at Katherine, “and I swear I will take her from you.” He smiled. “And from what Zachary said, your little si ster is more precious to you than all your—” “What’s going on?!” Katherine’s mother shouted, mar ching into the room with Peter’s Browning Citori shotgun—which she aimed directly at the man’s chest . The intruder spun toward her, and the feisty seve nty- five-year- old woman wasted no time. She fired a deafening bla st of pellets. The intruder staggered backward, firing his handgun wildly in all directions, shatte ring windows as he fell and crashed through the gla ss doorway, dropping the pistol as he fell. Peter was instantly in motion, diving on the loose handgun. Katherine had fallen, and Mrs. Solomon hur ried to her side, kneeling beside her. “My God, are you hurt?!” Katherine shook her head, mute with shock. Outside the shattered glass door, the masked man had clambe red to his feet and was running into the woods, clutchi ng his side as he ran. Peter Solomon glanced back t o make"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"sure his mother and sister were safe, and seeing th ey were fine, he held the pistol and raced out the door after the intruder. Katherine’s mother held her hand, trembling. “Thank heavens you’re okay.” Then suddenly her mother pulled away. “Katherine? You’re bleeding! There’s b lood! You’re hurt!” Katherine saw the blood. A lot of blood. It was all over her. But she felt no pain. Her mother frantically searched Katherine’s body fo r a wound. “Where does it hurt!” “Mom, I don’t know, I don’t feel anything!” Then Katherine saw the source of the blood, and she went cold. “Mom, it’s not me . . .” She pointed to the side of her mother’s white satin blouse, where bloo d was running freely, and a small tattered hole was visible. Her mother glanced down, looking more conf used than anything else. She winced and shrank back , as if the pain had just hit her. “Katherine?” Her voice was calm, but suddenly it ca rried the weight of her seventy-five years. “ I need you to call an ambulance.” Katherine ran to the hall phone and called for help . When she got back to the conservatory, she found her mother lying motionless in a pool of blood. She ran to her, crouching down, cradling her mother’s body in her arms. Katherine had no idea how much time had passed when she heard the distant gunshot in the woods. Finall y, the conservatory door burst open, and her brother, Peter, rushed in, eyes wild, gun still in his hand. When he saw Katherine sobbing, holding their lifeless mothe r in her arms, his face contorted in anguish. The s cream that echoed through the conservatory was a sound Ka therine Solomon would never forget. CHAPTER 52 Mal’akh could feel the tattooed muscles on his back rippling as he sprinted back around the building toward the open bay door of Pod 5. I must gain access to her lab. Katherine’s escape had been unanticipated . . . and problematic. Not only did she know where Mal’ akh lived, she now knew his true identity . . . and that he wa s the one who had invaded their home a decade earli er. Mal’akh had not forgotten that night either. He had come within inches of possessing the pyramid, but destiny had obstructed him. I was not yet ready. But he was ready now. More powerful. More influent ial. Having endured unthinkable hardship in preparation for his return, Mal’akh was poised tonight to fulfi ll his destiny at last. He felt certain that before the ni ght was over, he would indeed be staring into the d ying eyes of Katherine Solomon. As Mal’akh reached the bay door, he reassured himse lf that Katherine had not truly escaped; she had on ly prolonged the inevitable. He slid through the openi ng and strode confidently across the darkness until his feet hit the carpet. Then he took a right turn and heade d for the Cube. The banging on the door of Pod 5 ha d stopped, and Mal’akh suspected the guard was now tr ying to remove the dime Mal’akh had jammed into the key panel to render it useless. "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"When Mal ’ akh reached the door that led into the Cube, he loc ated the outer keypad and inserted Trish ’ s key card. The panel lit up. He entered Trish’s PIN and went inside. The lights were all ablaze, and as he moved into the sterile space, he squinted in amazement at the dazzling array of equipment. Mal’akh was no st ranger to the power of technology; he performed his own br eed of science in the basement of his home, and las t night some of that science had borne fruit. The Truth. Peter Solomon’s unique confinement—trapped alone in the in-between—had laid bare all of the man’s secrets. I can see his soul. Mal’akh had learned certain secrets he anticipated , and others he had not, including the news about Katherine’s lab and her sh ocking discoveries. Science is getting close, Mal’akh had realized. And I will not allow it to light the way for the un worthy. Katherine’s work here had begun using modern scienc e to answer ancient philosophical questions. Does anyone hear our prayers? Is there life after death? Do humans have souls? Incredibly, Katherine had answered all of these questions, and more. Scientif ically. Conclusively. The methods she used were irrefutable. Even the most skeptical of people woul d be persuaded by the results of her experiments. I f this information were published and made known, a fundam ental shift would begin in the consciousness of man . They will start to find their way . Mal’akh’ s last task tonight, before his transformation, was to ensure that this did not happen. As he moved through the lab, Mal’akh located the da ta room that Peter had told him about. He peered through the heavy glass walls at the two holographi c data-storage units. Exactly as he said they would be . Mal’akh found it hard to imagine that the contents of these little boxes could change the course of hu man development, and yet Truth had always been the most potent of all the catalysts. Eyeing the holographic storage units, Mal’akh produ ced Trish’s key card and inserted it in the door’s security panel. To his surprise, the panel did not light up. Apparently, access to this room was not a trust extended to Trish Dunne. He now reached for the key card he had found in Katherine’s lab-coat pocket. When he inserted this one, the panel lit up. Mal’akh had a problem. I never got Katherine’s PIN. He tried Trish’s PIN, but it didn’t work. Stroking his chin, he stepped back and examined the three-inch-th ick Plexiglas door. Even with an ax, he knew he wou ld be unable to break through and obtain the drives he needed to destroy. Mal’akh had planned for this contingency, however. Inside the power-supply room, exactly as Peter had described, Mal’akh located the rack holding several metal cylinders resembling large scuba tanks. The c ylinders bore the letters LH, the number 2, and the universal symbol for combustible. One of the canist ers was connected to the lab’s hydrogen fuel cell . Mal’akh left one canister connected and carefully h eaved one of the reserve cylinders down onto a doll y beside the rack. Then he rolled the cylinder out of the power-supply room, across the lab, to the Plex iglas door of the data-storage room. Although this locati on would certainly be plenty close enough, he had n oticed one weakness in the heavy Plexiglas door—the small space between the bottom and the jamb. At the threshold, he carefully laid the canister on its side and slid the flexible rubber tube beneath the door. It took him a moment to remove the safety seals and ac cess the cylinder’s valve, but once he did, ever so gently, he uncocked the valve. Through the Plexigla s, he could see the clear, bubbling liquid begin dr aining out of the tube onto the floor inside the storage r oom. Mal’akh watched the puddle expand, oozing acro ss the floor, steaming and bubbling as it grew. Hydrogen r emained in liquid form only when it was cold, and a s it warmed up, it would start to boil off. The resultin g gas, conveniently, was even more flammable than t he liquid. Remember the Hindenburg. Mal’akh hurried now into the lab and retrieved the Pyrex jug of Bunsen-burner fuel—a viscous, highly flammable, yet noncombustible oil. He carried it to the Plexiglas door, pleased to see the liquid hydr ogen"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"canister was still draining, the puddle of boiling liquid inside the data - storage room now covering the entire floor, encircling the pedestals that supported the holographic storage units. A whitish mist now rose from the boiling puddle as the liquid hydrogen began turning to gas . . . filling the small space. Mal’akh raised the jug of Bunsen-burner fuel and sq uirted a healthy amount on the hydrogen canister, t he tubing, and into the small opening beneath the door . Then, very carefully, he began backing out of the lab, leaving an unbroken stream of oil on the floor as h e went. The dispatch operator handling 911 calls for Washin gton, D.C., had been unusually busy tonight. Football, beer, and a full moon, she thought as yet another emergency call appeared on her screen, this one from a gas- station pay phone on the Suitland Parkway in Anacos tia. A car accident probably. “Nine-one-one,” she answered. “What is your emergen cy?” “I was just attacked at the Smithsonian Museum Supp ort Center,” a panicked woman’s voice said. “Please send the police! Forty-two-ten Silver Hill Road!” “Okay, slow down,” the operator said. “You need to— ” “I need you to send officers also to a mansion in K alorama Heights where I think my brother may be hel d captive!” The operator sighed. Full moon. CHAPTER 53 As I tried to tell you,” Bellamy was saying to Langdon, “ther e is more to this pyramid than meets the eye.” Apparently so. Langdon had to admit that the stone pyramid sittin g in his unzipped daybag looked much more mysterious to him now. His decryption of the M asonic cipher had rendered a seemingly meaningless grid of letters. Chaos . "},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" For a long while, Langdon examined the grid, search ing for any hint of meaning within the letters—hidd en words, anagrams, clues of any sort—but he found not hing. “The Masonic Pyramid,” Bellamy explained, “is said to guard its secrets behind many veils. Each time y ou pull back a curtain, you face another. You have unv eiled these letters, and yet they tell you nothing until you peel back another layer. Of course, the way to do t hat is known only to the one who holds the capstone . The capstone, I suspect, has an inscription as well, which tells you how to decipher the pyramid.” Langdon glanced at the cube-shaped package on the d esk. From what Bellamy had said, Langdon now understood that the capstone and pyramid were a “se gmented cipher”—a code broken into pieces. Modern cryptologists used segmented ciphers all the time, although the security scheme had been invented in a ncient Greece. The Greeks, when they wanted to store secre t information, inscribed it on a clay tablet and th en shattered the tablet into pieces, storing each piec e in a separate location. Only when all the pieces were gathered together could the secrets be read. This k ind of inscribed clay tablet—called a symbolon—was in fact the origin of the modern word symbol . “Robert,” Bellamy said, “this pyramid and capstone have been kept apart for generations, ensuring the secret’s safety.” His tone turned rueful. “Tonight, however, the pieces have come dangerously close. I ’ m sure I don’t have to say this . . . but it is our duty t o ensure this pyramid is not assembled.” Langdon found Bellamy’s sense of drama to be somewh at overwrought. Is he describing the capstone and pyramid . . . or a detonator and nuclear bomb? He still couldn’t quite accept Bellamy’s claims, bu t it hardly seemed to matter. “Even if this is the Masonic Pyramid, and even if this inscription does somehow reveal the location of ancient knowledge, how could that knowl edge possibly impart the kind of power it is said t o impart?” “Peter always told me you were a hard man to convin ce—an academic who prefers proof to speculation.” “You’re saying you do believe that?” Langdon demanded, feeling impatient now. “ Respectfully . . . you are a modern, educated man. How could you believe such a thing?” Bellamy gave a patient smile. “The craft of Freemas onry has given me a deep respect for that which transcends human understanding. I’ve learned never to close my mind to an idea simply because it seem s miraculous.” CHAPTER 54 Frantically, the SMSC perimeter patrolman dashed down the grave l pathway that ran along the outside of the building. He’d just received a call from an off icer inside saying that the keypad to Pod 5 had bee n sabotaged, and that a security light indicated that Pod 5’s specimen bay door was now open. What the hell is going on?! As he arrived at the specimen bay, sure enough he f ound the door open a couple of feet. Bizarre, he thought. This can only be unlocked from the inside. He took the flashlight off his belt and shone it i nto the inky blackness of the pod. Nothing. Having no desire to step into the unknown, he moved only as far as the threshold and then stuck the flashlight through the opening, swinging it to the left, and then to the— Powerful hands seized his wrist and yanked him into the blackness. The guard felt himself being spun a round by an invisible force. He smelled ethanol. The flas hlight flew out of his hand, and before he could ev en"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"process what was happening, a rock - hard fist collided with his sternum. The guard crum pled to the cement floor . . . groaning in pain as a large black form stepped away from him. The guard lay on his side, gasping and wheezing for breath. His flashlight lay nearby, its beam spilli ng across the floor and illuminating what appeared to be a me tal can of some sort. The can’s label said it was f uel oil for a Bunsen burner. A cigarette lighter sparked, and the orange flame i lluminated a vision that hardly seemed human. Jesus Christ! The guard barely had time to process what he was s eeing before the bare- chested creature knelt down and touched the flame to the floor. Instantly, a strip of fire materialized, leaping aw ay from them, racing into the void. Bewildered, the guard looked back, but the creature was already slipping out the open bay door into the night. The guard managed to sit up, wincing in pain as his eyes followed the thin ribbon of fire. What the hell?! The flame looked too small to be truly dangerous, and yet now he saw something utterly ter rifying. The fire was no longer illuminating only t he darkened void. It had traveled all the way to the b ack wall, where it was now illuminating a massive c inder- block structure. The guard had never been permitted inside Pod 5, but he knew very well what this stru cture must be. The Cube. Katherine Solomon ’s lab. The flame raced in a straight line directly to the lab’s outer door. The guard clambered to his feet, knowing full well that the ribbon of oil probably continued beneath the lab door . . . and would soon start a fire inside. But as he turned to run for help, he felt an unexpe cted puff of air sucking past him. For a brief instant, all of Pod 5 was bathed in lig ht. The guard never saw the hydrogen fireball erupting skyward, ripping the roof off Pod 5 and billowing hundreds of feet into the air. Nor did he see the s ky raining fragments of titanium mesh, electronic equipment, and droplets of melted silicon from the lab’s holographic storage units. Katherine Solomon was driving north when she saw th e sudden flash of light in her rearview mirror. A d eep rumble thundered through the night air, startling h er. Fireworks? she wondered. Do the Redskins have a halftime show? She refocused on the road, her thoughts still on th e 911 call she’d placed from the deserted gas stati on’s pay phone. Katherine had successfully convinced the 911 dispat cher to send the police to the SMSC to investigate a tattooed intruder and, Katherine prayed, to find he r assistant, Trish. In addition, she urged the disp atcher to check Dr. Abaddon’s address in Kalorama Heights, wh ere she thought Peter was being held hostage. Unfortunately, Katherine had been unable to obtain Robert Langdon’s unlisted cell-phone number. So now , seeing no other option, she was speeding toward the Library of Congress, where Langdon had told her he was headed. The terrifying revelation of Dr. Abaddon’s true ide ntity had changed everything. Katherine had no idea what to believe anymore. All she knew for certain was th at the same man who had killed her mother and nephe w all those years ago had now captured her brother an d had come to kill her. Who is this madman? What does he want? The only answer she could come up with made no sen se. A pyramid? Equally confusing was why this man had come to her lab tonight. If he wanted to hurt her, why hadn’t he done so in the privacy o f his own home earlier today? Why go to the trouble of se nding a text message and risk breaking into her lab ? "},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Unexpectedly, the fireworks in her rearview mirror grew brighter, the initial flash followed by an une xpected sight—a blazing orange fireball that Katherine coul d see rising above the tree line. What in the world?! The fireball was accompanied by dark black smoke . . . and it was nowhere near the Redskins’ FedEx Field. Bewildered, she tried to determine what industry mi ght be located on the other side of those trees . . . just southeast of the parkway. Then, like an oncoming truck, it hit her. CHAPTER 55 Warren Bellamy stabbed urgently at the buttons on his cell phone, trying again to make contact with someone who could help them, whoever that might be. Langdon watched Bellamy, but his mind was with Pete r, trying to figure out how best to find him. Decipher the engraving, Peter’s captor had commanded, and it will tell you the hiding place of mankind’s greatest treasure . . . We will go together . . . and make our trade. Bellamy hung up, frowning. Still no answer. “Here’s what I don’t understand,” Langdon said. “Ev en if I could somehow accept that this hidden wisdo m exists . . . and that this pyramid somehow points t o its underground location . . . what am I looking for? A vault? A bunker?” Bellamy sat quietly for a long moment. Then he gave a reluctant sigh and spoke guardedly. “Robert, according to what I’ve heard through the years, the pyramid leads to the entrance of a spiral staircas e.” “A staircase ?” “That’s right. A staircase that leads down into the earth . . . many hundreds of feet.” Langdon could not believe what he was hearing. He l eaned closer. “I’ve heard it said that the ancient wisdom is buri ed at the bottom.” Robert Langdon stood up and began pacing. A spiral staircase descending hundreds of feet into the earth . . . in Washington, D.C. “ And nobody has ever seen this staircase?” “Allegedly the entrance has been covered with an en ormous stone.” Langdon sighed. The idea of a tomb covered with an enormous stone was right out of the biblical accoun ts of Jesus’ tomb. This archetypal hybrid was the grandfa ther of them all. “Warren, do you believe this secret mystical staircase into the earth exists?” “I’ve never seen it personally, but a few of the ol der Masons swear it exists. I was trying to call on e of them just now. ” Langdon continued pacing, uncertain what to say nex t. “Robert, you leave me a difficult task with respect to this pyramid.” Warren Bellamy’s gaze hardened i n the soft glow of the reading lamp. “I know of no way to force a man to believe what he does not want to believe. And yet I hope you understand your duty to Peter So lomon. ”"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" Yes, I have a duty to help him, Langdon thought. “I don’t need you to believe in the power this pyra mid can unveil. Nor do I need you to believe in the staircase it supposedly leads to. But I do need you to believe that you are morally obliged t o protect this secret . . . whatever it may be.” Bellamy motioned to the little cube-shaped package. “Peter entrusted the capstone to you because he had faith you would obey his wishes and keep it secret. And now you must do exactly that, even if it means sacrificing Peter’s life.” Langdon stopped short and wheeled around. “What?!” Bellamy remained seated, his expression pained but resolute. “It’s what he would want. You need to for get Peter. He’s gone. Peter did his job, doing the best he could to protect the pyramid. Now it is our job to make sure his efforts were not in vain.” “I can’t believe you’re saying this!” Langdon excla imed, temper flaring. “Even if this pyramid is ever ything you say it is, Peter is your Masonic brother. You’r e sworn to protect him above all else, even your co untry!” “No, Robert. A Mason must protect a fellow Mason ab ove all things . . . except one—the great secret ou r brotherhood protects for all mankind. Whether or no t I believe this lost wisdom has the potential that history suggests, I have taken a vow to keep it out of the hands of the unworthy. And I would not give it over to anyone . . . even in exchange for Peter Solomon’s l ife.” “I know plenty of Masons,” Langdon said angrily, “i ncluding the most advanced, and I’m damned sure the se men are not sworn to sacrifice their lives for the sake of a stone pyramid. And I’m also damned sure n one of them believes in a secret staircase that descends t o a treasure buried deep in the earth.” “There are circles within circles, Robert. Not every one knows every thing .” Langdon exhaled, trying to control his emotions. He , like everyone, had heard the rumors of elite circ les within the Masons. Whether or not it was true seeme d irrelevant in the face of this situation. “Warren , if this pyramid and capstone truly reveal the ultimate Maso nic secret, then why would Peter involve me ? I’m not even a brother . . . much less part of any inner ci rcle.” “I know, and I suspect that is precisely why Peter chose you to guard it. This pyramid has been targeted in the past, even by those who infiltrated our brotherhood with unworthy motives. Peter’s choice to store it outside the brotherhood was a clever one.” “Were you aware I had the capstone?” Langdon asked. “No. And if Peter told anyone at all, it would have been only one man.” Bellamy pulled out his cell ph one and hit redial. “And so far, I’ve been unable to re ach him.” He got a voice-mail greeting and hung up. “Well, Robert, it looks like you and I are on our own for the moment. And we have a decision to make.” Langdon looked at his Mickey Mouse watch. 9:42 P.M. “You do realize that Peter’s captor is waiting for me to decipher this pyramid tonight and tell him what it says.” Bellamy frowned. “Great men throughout history have made deep personal sacrifices to protect the Ancie nt Mysteries. You and I must do the same.” He stood up now. “We should keep moving. Sooner or later Sato will figure out where we are.” “What about Katherine?!” Langdon demanded, not want ing to leave. “I can’t reach her, and she never called.” “Obviously, something happened.” “But we can’t just abandon her!” "},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"“ Forget Katherine! ” Bellamy said, his voice commanding now. “ Forget Peter! Forget everyone! Don ’ t you understand, Robert, that you’ve been entrusted with a duty that is bigger than all of us—you, Peter, Katherine, myself?” He locked eyes with Langdon. “W e need to find a safe place to hide this pyramid an d capstone far from—” A loud metallic crash echoed in the direction of th e great hall. Bellamy wheeled, eyes filling with fear. “That was fast.” Langdon turned toward the door. The sound apparentl y had come from the metal bucket that Bellamy had placed on the ladder blocking the tunnel doors. They’re coming for us. Then, quite unexpectedly, the crash echoed again. And again. And again. The homeless man on the bench in front of the Libra ry of Congress rubbed his eyes and watched the stra nge scene unfolding before him. A white Volvo had just jumped the curb, lurched acr oss the deserted pedestrian walkway, and screeched to a halt at the foot of the library’s main entrance. An attractive, dark-haired woman had leaped out, anxi ously surveyed the area, and, spotting the homeless man, had shouted, “Do you have a phone?” Lady, I don ’t have a left shoe. Apparently realizing as much, the woman dashed up t he staircase toward the library’s main doors. Arriv ing at the top of the stairs, she grabbed the handle an d tried desperately to open each of the three giant doors. The library’s closed, lady. But the woman didn’t seem to care. She seized one o f the heavy ring-shaped handles, heaved it backward , and let it fall with a loud crash against the door. Then she did it again. And again. And again. Wow, the homeless man thought, she must really need a book. CHAPTER 56 When Katherine Solomon finally saw the massive bronze doors of the librar y swing open before her, she felt as if an emotional floodgate had burst. All th e fear and confusion she had bottled up tonight cam e pouring through. The figure in the library doorway was Warren Bellam y, a friend and confidant of her brother’ s. But it was the man behind Bellamy in the shadows whom Katherine fe lt happiest to see. The feeling was apparently mutu al. Robert Langdon’s eyes filled with relief as she rus hed through the doorway . . . directly into his arm s. As Katherine lost herself in the comforting embrace of an old friend, Bellamy closed the front door. S he heard the heavy lock click into place, and at last she felt safe. Tears came unexpectedly, but she fou ght them back. "},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Langdon held her. “ It ’ s okay, ” he whispered. “ You ’ re okay. ” Because you saved me, Katherine wanted to tell him. He destroyed my lab . . . all my work. Years of research . . . up in smoke. She wanted to tell him everything, but she could b arely breathe. “We’ll find Peter.” Langdon’s deep voice resonated against her chest, comforting her somehow. “I promi se.” I know who did this! Katherine wanted to yell. The same man who killed my mother and nephew! Before she could explain herself, an unexpected sound broke th e silence of the library. The loud crash echoed up from beneath them in a ves tibule stairwell—as if a large metal object had fal len on a tile floor. Katherine felt Langdon’s muscles stif fen instantly. Bellamy stepped forward, his expression dire. “We’r e leaving. Now .” Bewildered, Katherine followed as the Architect and Langdon hurried across the great hall toward the library’s famed reading room, which was ablaze with light. Bellamy quickly locked the two sets of door s behind them, first the outer, then the inner. Katherine followed in a daze as Bellamy hustled the m both toward the center of the room. The threesome arrived at a reading desk where a leather bag sat b eneath a light. Beside the bag, there was a tiny cu be- shaped package, which Bellamy scooped up and placed inside the bag, alongside a— Katherine stopped short. A pyramid? Although she had never seen this engraved stone pyr amid, she felt her entire body recoil in recognitio n. Somehow her gut knew the truth. Katherine Solomon h ad just come face-to-face with the object that had so deeply damaged her life. The pyramid. Bellamy zipped up the bag and handed it to Langdon. “Don’t let this out of your sight.” A sudden explosion rocked the room’s outer doors. T he tinkling of shattered glass followed. “This way!” Bellamy spun, looking scared now as he rushed them over to the central circulation desk—ei ght counters around a massive octagonal cabinet. He gui ded them in behind the counters and then pointed to an opening in the cabinet. “Get in there!” “In there ?” Langdon demanded. “They’ll find us for sure!” “Trust me,” Bellamy said. “It’s not what you think.” CHAPTER 57 Mal’akh gunned his limousine north toward Kalorama Heights. The e xplosion in Katherine’s lab had been bigger than he had anticipated, and he had been luc ky to escape unscathed. Conveniently, the ensuing c haos had enabled him to slip out without opposition, pow ering his limousine past a distracted gate guard wh o was busy yelling into a telephone. I ’ve got to get off the road, he thought. If Katherine hadn’t yet phoned the pol ice, the explosion would certainly draw their attention. And a shirtless man driving a limousine would be ha rd to miss. "},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"After years of preparation, Mal ’ akh could scarcely believe the night was now upon h im. The journey to this moment had been a long, difficult one. What began years ago in misery . . . will end tonig ht in glory. On the night it all began, he had not had the name Mal’akh. In fact, on the night it all began, he had not had any name at all. Inmate 37 . Like most of the prisoners at the brutal Soganlik Prison outside of Istanbul, Inmate 37 was here because of drugs. He had been lying on his bunk in a cement cell, hun gry and cold in the darkness, wondering how long he would be incarcerated. His new cellmate, whom he’d met only twenty-four hours ago, was sleeping in the bunk above him. The prison administrator, an obese alcoholic who hated his job and took it out on the inmates, had just killed all the lights for the nig ht. It was almost ten o’clock when Inmate 37 heard the conversation filtering in through the ventilation s haft. The first voice was unmistakably clear—the piercing , belligerent accent of the prison administrator, w ho clearly did not appreciate being woken up by a late -night visitor. “Yes, yes, you’ve come a long way,” he was saying, “but there are no visitors for the first month. Sta te regulations. No exceptions.” The voice that replied was soft and refined, filled with pain. “Is my son safe?” “He is a drug addict.” “Is he being treated well?” “Well enough,” the administrator said. “This is not a hotel.” There was a pained pause. “You do realize the U.S. State Department will request extradition.” “Yes, yes, they always do. It will be granted, alth ough the paperwork might take us a couple of weeks . . . or even a month . . . depending.” “Depending on what?” “Well,” the administrator said, “we are understaffed .” He paused. “Of course, sometimes concerned parties like yourself make donations to the prison staff to help us push things through more quickly.” The visitor did not reply. “Mr. Solomon,” the administrator continued, lowering his voice, “for a man like yourself, for whom mone y is no object, there are always options. I know peop le in government. If you and I work together, we ma y be able to get your son out of here . . . tomorrow, with all the charges dropped. He would not even ha ve to face prosecution at home.” The response was immediate. “ Forgetting the legal ramifications of your suggesti on, I refuse to teach my son that money solves all problems or that there is no accountability in life, especially in a serious mat ter like this.” “You’d like to leave him here?” “I’d like to speak to him. Right now.” “As I said, we have rules. Your son is unavailable to you . . . unless you would like to negotiate his immediate release.” A cold silence hung for several moments. “The State Department will be contacting you. Keep Zachary sa fe. I expect him on a plane home within the week. Good night.” "},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The door slammed. Inmate 37 could not believe his ears. What kind of father leaves his son in this hellhole in order to teach him a lesson? Peter Solomon had even rejected an offer to clear Zachary’s record. It was later that night, lying awake in his bunk, t hat Inmate 37 had realized how he would free himsel f. If money was the only thing separating a prisoner from freedom, then Inmate 37 was as good as free. Peter Solomon might not be willing to part with money, bu t as anyone who read the tabloids knew, his son, Zachary, had plenty of money, too. The next day, In mate 37 spoke privately to the administrator and suggested a plan—a bold, ingenious scheme that woul d give them both exactly what they wanted. “Zachary Solomon would have to die for this to work ,” explained Inmate 37. “But we could both disappear immediately. You could retire to the Greek Islands. You would never see this place again.” After some discussion, the two men shook hands. Soon Zachary Solomon will be dead, Inmate 37 thought, smiling to think how easy it would be. It was two days later that the State Department con tacted the Solomon family with the horrific news. T he prison snapshots showed their son’s brutally bludge oned body, lying curled and lifeless on the floor o f his prison cell. His head had been bashed in by a steel bar, and the rest of him was battered and twisted beyond what was humanly imaginable. He appeared to have be en tortured and finally killed. The prime suspect w as the prison administrator himself, who had disappear ed, probably with all of the murdered boy’s money. Zachary had signed papers moving his vast fortune i nto a private numbered account, which had been empt ied immediately following his death. There was no telli ng where the money was now. Peter Solomon flew to Turkey on a private jet and r eturned with their son’s casket, which they buried in the Solomon family cemetery. The prison administrator w as never found. Nor would he be, Inmate 37 knew. The Turk’s rotund body was now resting at the bottom of the Sea of Marmara, feeding the blue manna crabs t hat migrated in through the Bosporus Strait. The vast f ortune belonging to Zachary Solomon had all been mo ved to an untraceable numbered account. Inmate 37 was a free man again—a free man with a massive fortune. The Greek Islands were like heaven. The light. The water. The women. There was nothing money couldn’t buy—new identities , new passports, new hope. He chose a Greek name— Andros Dareios— Andros meaning “warrior,” and Dareios meaning “wealthy.” The dark nights in prison had frightened him, and Andros vowed never to go back. He shaved off his shaggy hair and shunned the drug world entirely. He began life anew—exploring never- before-imagined sensual pleasures. The serenity of sailing alone on the ink-blue Aegean Sea became his new heroin trance; the sensuality of sucking moist arni souvlakia right off the skewer became his new Ecstasy; and t he rush of cliff diving into the foam-filled ravines of Mykonos became his new cocaine. I am reborn. Andros bought a sprawling villa on the island of Sy ros and settled in among the bella gente in the exclusive town of Possidonia. This new world was a community not only of wealth, but of culture and physical perfection. His neighbors took great pride in their bodies and minds, and it was contagious. The newco mer suddenly found himself jogging on the beach, tannin g his pale body, and reading books. Andros read Homer’s Odyssey, captivated by the images of powerful bronze men do ing battle on these islands. The next day, he began lifting weights, and was amazed to se e how quickly his chest and arms grew larger. Gradu ally, he began to feel women’ s eyes on him, and the admiration was intoxicating. He longed to grow stronger still. And he did. With the help of aggressive cycles of s teroids intermixed with black-market growth hormone s and endless hours of weight lifting, Andros transfo rmed himself into something he had never imagined h e could be—a perfect male specimen. He grew in both h eight and musculature, developing flawless pectoral s and massive, sinewy legs, which he kept perfectly t anned. Everyone was looking now. As Andros had been warned, the heavy steroids and h ormones changed not only his body, but also his voi ce"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"box, giving him an eerie, breathy whisper, which ma de him feel more mysterious. The soft, enigmatic vo ice, combined with his new body, his wealth, and his ref usal to speak about his mysterious past, served as catnip for the women who met him. They gave themselves wil lingly, and he satisfied them all—from fashion models visiting his island on photo shoots, to nubi le American college girls on vacation, to the lonel y wives of his neighbors, to the occasional young man. They could not get enough. I am a masterpiece. As the years passed, however, Andros’s sexual adven tures began to lose their thrill. As did everything . The island’ s sumptuous cuisine lost its taste, books no longer held his interest, and even the dazzling sunsets f rom his villa looked dull. How could this be? He was only in his midtwenties, and yet he felt ol d. What more is there to life? He had sculpted his body into a masterpiece; he ha d educated himself and nourished his mind with culture; he had made his home in paradise; and he had the love of anyone he desired. And yet, incredibly, he felt as empty as he had in that Turkish prison. What is it I am missing? The answer had come to him several months later. An dros was sitting alone in his villa, absently surfi ng channels in the middle of the night, when he stumbl ed across a program about the secrets of Freemasonr y. The show was poorly done, posing more questions tha n answers, and yet he found himself intrigued by th e plethora of conspiracy theories surrounding the bro therhood. The narrator described legend after legen d. Freemasons and the New World Order . . . The Great Masonic Seal of the United States . . . The P2 Masonic Lodge . . . The Lost Secret of Freemasonry . . . The Masonic Pyramid . . . Andros sat up, startled. Pyramid . The narrator began recounting the story of a myst erious stone pyramid whose encrypted engraving promised to lead to lost wisdom and unfathomable power. The story, though seemingly implausible, sparked in him a distant mem ory . . . a faint recollection from a much darker t ime. Andros remembered what Zachary Solomon had heard fr om his father about a mysterious pyramid. Could it be? Andros strained to recall the details. When the show ended, he stepped out onto the balcon y, letting the cool air clear his mind. He remember ed more now, and as it all came back, he began to sens e there might be some truth to this legend after al l. And if so, then Zachary Solomon—although long dead—still h ad something to offer. What do I have to lose? Three weeks later, his timing carefully planned, An dros stood in the frigid cold outside the conservat ory of the Solomons’ Potomac estate. Through the glass, he could see Pet er Solomon chatting and laughing with his sister, Katherine. It looks like they’ve had no trouble forgetting Zac hary, he thought. Before he pulled the ski mask over his face, Andros took a hit of cocaine, his first in ages. He felt the familiar rush of fearlessness. He pulled out a handgun, used an old key to unlock the door, and stepped inside. “ Hello, Solomons.” Unfortunately, the night had not gone as Andros had planned. Rather than obtaining the pyramid for whi ch he had come, he found himself riddled with bird sho t and fleeing across the snow-covered lawn toward t he dense woods. To his surprise, behind him, Peter Sol omon was giving chase, pistol glinting in his hand. Andros dashed into the woods, running down a trail along the edge of a deep ravine. Far below, the sou nds of"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"a waterfall echoed up through the crisp winter air. He passed a stand of oak trees and rounded a corne r to his left. Seconds later, he was skidding to a stop on t he icy path, narrowly escaping death. My God! Only feet in front of him, the path ended, plunging straight down into an icy river far below. The lar ge boulder at the side of the path had been carved by the unskilled hand of a child: On the far side of the ravine, the path continued o n. So where’s the bridge?! The cocaine was no longer working. I’m trapped! Panicking now, Andros turned to flee back up the p ath, but he found himself facing Peter Solomon, who stood breathless before him, pis tol in hand. Andros looked at the gun and took a step backward. The drop behind him was at least fifty feet to an i ce- covered river. The mist from the waterfall upstream billowed around them, chilling him to the bone. “Zach’s bridge rotted out long ago,” Solomon said, panting. “He was the only one who ever came down th is far.” Solomon held the gun remarkably steady. “Why d id you kill my son?” “He was nothing,” Andros replied. “A drug addict. I did him a favor.” Solomon moved closer, gun aimed directly at Andros’ s chest. “Perhaps I should do you the same favor.” His tone was surprisingly fierce. “You bludgeoned my son to death. How does a man do such a thing?” “Men do the unthinkable when pushed to the brink.” “You killed my son!” “No,” Andros replied, hotly now. “ You killed your son. What kind of man leaves his son i n a prison when he has the option to get him out! You killed your son! Not me.” “You know nothing !” Solomon yelled, his voice filled with pain. You’re wrong, Andros thought. I know everything. Peter Solomon drew closer, only five yards away now , gun leveled. Andros’s chest was burning, and he could tell he was bleeding badly. The warmth ran do wn over his stomach. He looked over his shoulder at the drop. Impossible. He turned back to Solomon. “I kno w more about you than you think,” he whispered. “I know you are not the kind of man who kills in cold blood.” Solomon stepped closer, taking dead aim. “I’m warning you,” Andros said, “if you pull that t rigger, I will haunt you forever.” “You already will.” And with that, Solomon fired. As he raced his black limousine back toward Kaloram a Heights, the one who now called himself Mal’akh reflected on the miraculous events that had deliver ed him from certain death atop that icy ravine. He had been transformed forever. The gunshot had echoed on ly for an instant, and yet its effects had reverber ated across decades. His body, once tanned and perfect, was now marred by scars from that night . . . scars he kept"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"hidden beneath the tattooed symbols of his new iden tity. I am Mal ’akh. This was my destiny all along. He had walked through fire, been reduced to ashes, and then emerged again . . . transformed once more. Tonight would be the final step of his long and mag nificent journey. CHAPTER 58 The coyly nicknamed explosive Key4 had been developed by Spe cial Forces specifically for opening locked doors with minimal collateral damage. Consisting pr imarily of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine with a diethylhexyl plasticizer, it was essentially a piec e of C-4 rolled into paper-thin sheets for insertio n into doorjambs. In the case of the library’s reading roo m, the explosive had worked perfectly. Operation leader Agent Turner Simkins stepped over the wreckage of the doors and scanned the massive octagonal room for any signs of movement. Nothing. “Kill the lights,” Simkins said. A second agent found the wall panel, threw the swit ches, and plunged the room into darkness. In unison , all four men reached up and yanked down their night-vis ion headgear, adjusting the goggles over their eyes . They stood motionless, surveying the reading room, which now materialized in shades of luminescent gre en inside their goggles. The scene remained unchanged. Nobody made a dash for it in the dark. The fugitives were probably unarmed, and yet the fi eld team entered the room with weapons raised. In t he darkness, their firearms projected four menacing ro ds of laser light. The men washed the beams in all directions, across the floor, up the far walls, int o the balconies, probing the darkness. Oftentimes, a mere glimpse of a laser-sighted weapon in a darkened roo m was enough to induce instant surrender. Apparently not tonight. Still no movement. Agent Simkins raised his hand, motioning his team i nto the space. Silently, the men fanned out. Moving cautiously up the center aisle, Simkins reached up and flipped a switch on his goggles, activating the newest addition to the CIA’s arsenal. Thermal imaging had been around for years, but recent advances in miniaturization, differential sensitivity, and dual - source integration had facilitated a new generation of vision enhancing equipment that gave field agents eyesight that bordered on superhuman. We see in the dark. We see through walls. And now . . . we see back in time. Thermal-imaging equipment had become so sensitive t o heat differentials that it could detect not only a person’s location . . . but their previous locations. The ability to see into the past often proved the most valuable asset of all. And tonight, once again, it proved its worth. Agent Simkins now spied a thermal signature at one of the reading desks. The two wood en chairs luminesced in his goggles, registering a"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"reddish - purple color, indicating those chairs were warmer t han the other chairs in the room. The desk lamp ’ s bulb glowed orange. Obviously the two men had been sitting at the desk, but the question now was in wh ich direction they had gone. He found his answer on the central counter that sur rounded the large wooden console in the middle of t he room. A ghostly handprint, glowing crimson. Weapon raised, Simkins moved toward the octagonal c abinet, training his laser sight across the surface . He circled until he saw an opening in the side of the console. Did they really corner themselves in a cabinet? The agent scanned the trim around the opening and s aw another glowing handprint on it. Clearly someone had grabbed the doorjamb as he ducked inside the co nsole. The time for silence was over. “Thermal signature!” Simkins shouted, pointing at t he opening. “Flanks converge!” His two flanks moved in from opposite sides, effect ively surrounding the octagonal console. Simkins moved toward the opening. Still ten feet aw ay, he could see a light source within. “Light insi de the console!” he shouted, hoping the sound of his voice might convince Mr. Bellamy and Mr. Langdon to exit the cabinet with their hands up. Nothing happened. Fine, we ’ll do this the other way. As Simkins drew closer to the opening, he could hea r an unexpected hum rumbling from within. It sounde d like machinery. He paused, trying to imagine what c ould be making such a noise in such a small space. He inched closer, now hearing voices over the sound of machinery. Then, just as he arrived at the opening , the lights inside went out. Thank you, he thought, adjusting his night vision. Advantage, us. Standing at the threshold, he peered through the op ening. What lay beyond was unexpected. The console was less of a cabinet than a raised ceiling over a stee p set of stairs that descended into a room below. T he agent aimed his weapon down the stairs and began descendi ng. The hum of machinery grew louder with every step. What the hell is this place? The room beneath the reading room was a small, indu strial-looking space. The hum he heard was indeed machinery, although he was not sure whether it was running because Bellamy and Langdon had activated i t, or because it ran around the clock. Either way, it clearly made no difference. The fugitives had left their telltale heat signatures on the room’s lone exit—a heavy steel door whose keypad showed four clear fingerprints glowing on the numbers. Around the doo r, slivers of glowing orange shone beneath the doorjamb, indicating that lights were illuminated o n the other side. “Blow the door,” Simkins said. “This was their esca pe route.” It took eight seconds to insert and detonate a shee t of Key4. When the smoke cleared, the field-team a gents found themselves peering into a strange underground world known here as “the stacks.” The Library of Congress had miles and miles of book shelves, most of them underground. The endless rows of shelves looked like some kind of “infinity” opti cal illusion created with mirrors. A sign announced TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Keep this door closed at all times. Simkins pushed through the mangled doors and felt c ool air beyond. He couldn’t help but smile. Could this get any easier? Heat signatures in controlled environments showed up like solar flares, and already his goggles revealed a glowing red smear on a banister up ahead, which Bellamy or Langdon had grabbed on t o while running past. “You can run,” he whispered to himself, “but you can ’t hide.” As Simkins and his team advanced into the maze of s tacks, he realized the playing field was tipped so heavily in his favor that he would not even need hi s goggles to track his prey . Under normal circumstances, this maze of stacks would have been a respectable h iding place, but the Library of Congress used motio n- activated lights to save energy, and the fugitives’ escape route was now lit up like a runway. A narro w strip of illumination stretched into the distance, dodgin g and weaving as it went. All the men ripped off their goggles. Surging ahead on well-trained legs, the field team followed the trail of lights, zigging and zagging through a seemingly endless labyrinth of books. Soon Simkins began seeing lights flickering on in the darkness u p ahead. We’re gaining. He pushed harder, faster, until he heard footsteps and labored breathing ahead. Then he saw a target. “I’ve got visual!” he yelled. The lanky form of Warren Bellamy was apparently bri nging up the rear. The primly dressed African American staggered through the stacks, obviously ou t of breath. It’s no use, old man. “Stop right there, Mr. Bellamy!” Simkins yelled. Bellamy kept running, turning sharp corners, weavin g through the rows of books. At every turn, the lig hts kept coming on over his head. As the team drew within twenty yards, they shouted again to stop, but Bellamy ran on. “Take him down!” Simkins commanded. The agent carrying the team’s nonlethal rifle raise d it and fired. The projectile that launched down t he aisle and wrapped itself around Bellamy’s legs was nickna med Silly String, but there was nothing silly about it. A military technology invented at Sandia National Lab oratories, this nonlethal “incapacitant” was a thre ad of gooey polyurethane that turned rock hard on contact , creating a rigid web of plastic across the back o f the fugitive’s knees. The effect on a running target wa s that of jamming a stick into the spokes of a movi ng bike. The man’s legs seized midstride, and he pitched for ward, crashing to the floor. Bellamy slid another t en feet down a darkened aisle before coming to a stop, the lights above him flickering unceremoniously to life . “I’ll deal with Bellamy,” Simkins shouted. “You kee p going after Langdon! He must be up ahead some—” The team leader stopped, now seeing that the librar y stacks ahead of Bellamy were all pitch-black. Obviously, there was no one else running in front o f Bellamy. He’s alone? Bellamy was still on his chest, breathing heavily, his legs and ankles all tangled with hardened plast ic. The agent walked over and used his foot to roll the old man over onto his back. “Where is he?!” the agent demanded. Bellamy’s lip was bleeding from the fall. “Where is who ?” Agent Simkins lifted his foot and placed his boot s quarely on Bellamy’s pristine silk tie. Then he lea ned in, applying some pressure. “Believe me, Mr. Bellamy, y ou do not want to play this game with me.” "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 59 Robert Langdon felt like a corpse. He lay supine, hands folded on his chest, in total darkness, trapped in the most confined of spaces. A lthough Katherine lay nearby in a similar position near his head, Langdon could not see her. He had his eyes c losed to prevent himself from catching even a fleeting glimp se of his frightening predicament. The space around him was small. Very small. Sixty seconds ago, with the double doors of the rea ding room crashing down, he and Katherine had follo wed Bellamy into the octagonal console, down a steep se t of stairs, and into the unexpected space below. Langdon had realized at once where they were. The heart of the library’s circulation system. Resembling a small airport baggage distribution center, the circ ulation room had numerous conveyor belts that angle d off in different directions. Because the Library of Con gress was housed in three separate buildings, books requested in the reading room often had to be trans ported great distances by a system of conveyors thr ough a web of underground tunnels. Bellamy immediately crossed the room to a steel doo r, where he inserted his key card, typed a sequence of buttons, and pushed open the door. The space beyond was dark, but as the door opened, a span of motion - sensor lights flickered to life. When Langdon saw what lay beyond, he realized he wa s looking at something few people ever saw. The Library of Congress stacks. He felt encouraged by Bellamy’s plan. What better place to hide than in a giant labyrinth? Bellamy did not guide them into the stacks, however . Instead, he propped the door open with a book and turned back to face them. “I had hoped to be able t o explain a lot more to you, but we have no time.” He gave Langdon his key card. “You’ll need this.” “You’re not coming with us?” Langdon asked. Bellamy shook his head. “You’ll never make it unles s we split up. The most important thing is to keep that pyramid and capstone in safe hands.” Langdon saw no other way out except the stairs back up to the reading room. “And where are you going?” “I’ll coax them into the stacks away from you,” Bel lamy said. “It’s all I can do to help you escape.” Before Langdon could ask where he and Katherine wer e supposed to go, Bellamy was heaving a large crate of books off one of the conveyors. “Lie on the belt ,” Bellamy said. “Keep your hands in.” Langdon stared. You cannot be serious! The conveyor belt extended a short distance then d isappeared into a dark hole in the wall. The opening looked large eno ugh to permit passage of a crate of books, but not much more. Langdon glanced back longingly at the stacks. “Forget it,” Bellamy said. “The motion-sensor light s will make it impossible to hide.” "},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"“ Thermal signature! ” a voice upstairs shouted. “ Flanks converge! ” Katherine apparently had heard all she needed to he ar. She climbed onto the conveyor belt with her hea d only a few feet from the opening in the wall. She c rossed her hands over her chest like a mummy in a sarcophagus. Langdon stood frozen. “Robert,” Bellamy urged, “if you won’t do this for me, do it for Peter.” The voices upstairs sounded closer now. As if in a dream, Langdon moved to the conveyor. He slung his daybag onto the belt and then climbed on , placing his head at Katherine’s feet. The hard rubb er conveyor felt cold against his back. He stared a t the ceiling and felt like a hospital patient preparing for insertion headfirst into an MRI machine. “Keep your phone on,” Bellamy said. “Someone will c all soon . . . and offer help. Trust him.” Someone will call? Langdon knew that Bellamy had been trying to reach someone with no luck and had left a message earlier. And only moments ago, as they hurr ied down the spiral staircase, Bellamy had tried on e last time and gotten through, speaking very briefly in h ushed tones and then hanging up. “Follow the conveyor to the end,” Bellamy said. “An d jump off quickly before you circle back. Use my k ey card to get out.” “Get out of where ?!” Langdon demanded. But Bellamy was already pulling levers. All the dif ferent conveyors in the room hummed to life. Langdo n felt himself jolt into motion, and the ceiling bega n moving overhead. God save me. As Langdon approached the opening in the wall, he l ooked back and saw Warren Bellamy race through the doorway into the stacks, closing the door behind hi m. An instant later, Langdon slid into the darkness , swallowed up by the library . . . just as a glowing red laser dot came dancing down the stairs. CHAPTER 60 The underpaid female security guard from Preferred Security doub le- checked the Kalorama Heights address on her call sheet. This is it? The gated driveway before her belonged to one of t he neighborhood’ s largest and quietest estates, and so it seemed odd that 911 had just received an urgent call about it. As usual with unconfirmed call-ins, 911 had contact ed the local alarm company before bothering the pol ice. The guard often thought the alarm company’s motto—“ Your first line of defense”—could just as easily ha ve been “False alarms, pranks, lost pets, and complain ts from wacky neighbors.” Tonight, as usual, the guard had arrived with no de tails about the specific concern. Above my pay grade. Her job was simply to show up with her yellow bubble li ght spinning, assess the property, and report anyth ing unusual. Normally, something innocuous had tripped the house alarm, and she would use her override key s to reset it. This house, however, was silent. No alarm. From the roa d, everything looked dark and peaceful. "},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The guard buzzed the intercom at the gate, but got no answer. She typed her override code to open the gate and pulled into the driveway. Leaving her engine ru nning and her bubble light spinning, she walked up to the front door and rang the bell. No answer. She saw no lights and no movement. Reluctantly following procedure, she flicked on her flashlight to begin her trek around the house to c heck the doors and windows for signs of break-in. As she rou nded the corner, a black stretch limousine drove pa st the house, slowing for a moment before continuing on. Rubbernecking neighbors. Bit by bit, she made her way around the house, but saw nothing out of place. The house was bigger than she had imagined, and by the time she reached the backy ard, she was shivering from the cold. Obviously the re was nobody home. “Dispatch?” she called in on her radio. “I’m on the Kalorama Heights call? Owners aren’t home. No sign s of trouble. Finished the perimeter check. No indicatio n of an intruder. False alarm.” “Roger that,” the dispatcher replied. “Have a good n ight.” The guard put her radio back on her belt and began retracing her steps, eager to get back to the warmt h of her vehicle. As she did so, however, she spotted someth ing she had missed earlier—a tiny speck of bluish l ight on the back of the house. Puzzled, she walked over to it, now seeing the sour ce—a low transom window, apparently to the home’s basement. The glass of the window had been blacked out, coated on the inside with an opaque paint. Some kind of darkroom maybe? The bluish glow she had seen was emanating through a tiny spot on the window where the black paint had started to peel. She crouched down, trying to peer through, but she couldn’t see much through the tiny opening. She tap ped on the glass, wondering if maybe someone was workin g down there. “Hello?” she shouted. There was no answer, but as she knocked on the wind ow, the paint chip suddenly detached and fell off, affording her a more complete view. She leaned in, nearly pressing her face to the window as she scann ed the basement. Instantly, she wished she hadn’t. What in the name of God?! Transfixed, she remained crouched there for a momen t, staring in abject horror at the scene before her . Finally, trembling, the guard groped for the radio on her belt. She never found it. A sizzling pair of Taser prongs slammed into the ba ck of her neck, and a searing pain shot through her body. Her muscles seized, and she pitched forward, unable even to close her eyes before her face hit the col d ground. CHAPTER 61 Tonight was not the first time Warren Bellamy had been blindfo lded. Like all of his Masonic brothers, he had worn the ritual “hoodwink” during his ascent to the upper echelons of Masonry. That, however, had taken place among trusted friends. Tonight was diff erent. These rough - handed men had bound him, placed a"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"bag on his head, and were now marching him through the library stacks. The agents had physically threatened Bellamy and de manded to know the whereabouts of Robert Langdon. Knowing his aging body couldn’t take much punishmen t, Bellamy had told his lie quickly. “Langdon never came down here with me!” he had said , gasping for air. “I told him to go up to the balc ony and hide behind the Moses statue, but I don’t know where he is now!” The story apparently had been convincing, because two of the agents had run off i n pursuit. Now the remaining two agents were marchi ng him in silence through the stacks. Bellamy’s only solace was in knowing Langdon and Ka therine were whisking the pyramid off to safety. Soon Langdon would be contacted by a man who could offer sanctuary. Trust him. The man Bellamy had called knew a great deal about the Masonic Pyramid and the secret it held—the location of a hidden spi ral staircase that led down into the earth to the hidin g place of potent ancient wisdom buried long ago. B ellamy had finally gotten through to the man as they were escaping the reading room, and he felt confident th at his short message would be understood perfectly. Now, as he moved in total darkness, Bellamy picture d the stone pyramid and golden capstone in Langdon ’s bag. It has been many years since those two pieces were in the same room. Bellamy would never forget that painful night. The first of many for Peter. Bellamy had been asked to come to the Solomon estate in Potomac for Zachary Solomo n’s eighteenth birthday. Zachary, despite being a rebellious child, was a Solomon, which meant tonigh t, following family tradition, he would receive his inheritance. Bellamy was one of Peter’s dearest fri ends and a trusted Masonic brother, and therefore w as asked to attend as a witness. But it was not only t he transference of money that Bellamy had been aske d to witness. There was far more than money at stake ton ight. Bellamy had arrived early and waited, as requested, in Peter’ s private study. The wonderful old room smelled of leather, wood fires, and loose-leaf tea. Warren was seated when Peter led his son, Zachary, into th e room. When the scrawny eighteen-year-old saw Bellamy, he frowned. “What are you doing here?” “Bearing witness,” Bellamy offered. “Happy birthday , Zachary.” The boy mumbled and looked away. “Sit down, Zach,” Peter said. Zachary sat in the solitary chair facing his father ’s huge wooden desk. Solomon bolted the study door. Bellamy took a seat off to one side. Solomon addressed Zachary in a serious tone. “Do yo u know why you’re here?” “I think so,” Zachary said. Solomon sighed deeply. “I know you and I have not s een eye to eye for quite some time, Zach. I’ve done my best to be a good father and to prepare you for thi s moment.” Zachary said nothing. “As you know, every Solomon child, upon reaching ad ulthood, is presented with his or her birthright—a share of the Solomon fortune—which is intended to b e a seed . . . a seed for you to nurture, make grow, and use to help nourish mankind.” Solomon walked to a vault in the wall, unlocked it, and removed a large black folder. “Son, this portf olio contains everything you need to legally transfer yo ur financial inheritance into your own name.” He laid it on the desk. “The aim is that you use this money to bu ild a life of productivity, prosperity, and philant hropy.” Zachary reached for the folder. “ Thanks. ”"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" “Hold on,” his father said, putting his hand on the portfolio. “There’s something else I need to expla in.” Zachary shot his father a contemptuous look and slu mped back down. “There are aspects of the Solomon inheritance of wh ich you are not yet aware.” His father was staring straight into Zachary’s eyes now. “You are my first born, Zachary, which means you are entitled to a ch oice.” The teenager sat up, looking intrigued. “It is a choice that may well determine the directi on of your future, and so I urge you to ponder it c arefully.” “What choice?” His father took a deep breath. “It is the choice . . . between wealth or wisdom.” Zachary gave him a blank stare. “Wealth or wisdom? I don’t get it.” Solomon stood, walking again to the vault, where he pulled out a heavy stone pyramid with Masonic symbols carved into it. Peter heaved the stone onto the desk beside the portfolio. “This pyramid was c reated long ago and has been entrusted to our family for g enerations.” “A pyramid?” Zachary didn’t look very excited. “Son, this pyramid is a map . . . a map that reveal s the location of one of humankind’s greatest lost treasures. This map was created so that the treasure could one day be rediscovered.” Peter’s voice swelled now wi th pride. “And tonight, following tradition, I am able to offer it to you . . . under certain conditions. ” Zachary eyed the pyramid suspiciously. “What’s the treasure?” Bellamy could tell that this coarse question was no t what Peter had hoped for. Nonetheless, his demean or remained steady. “Zachary, it’s hard to explain without a lot of bac kground. But this treasure . . . in essence . . . i s something we call the Ancient Mysteries.” Zachary laughed, apparently thinking his father was joking. Bellamy could see the melancholy growing now in Pet er’s eyes. “ This is very difficult for me to describe, Zach. Tr aditionally, by the time a Solomon is eighteen year s of age, he is about to embark on his years of higher educat ion in—” “I told you!” Zachary fired back. “I’m not interest ed in college!” “I don’t mean college, ” his father said, his voice still calm and quiet. “I’m talking about the brotherhood of Freemasonry. I’m talking about an education in the enduring mysteries of human science. If you had pla ns to join me within their ranks, you would be on the ver ge of receiving the education necessary to understa nd the importance of your decision tonight.” Zachary rolled his eyes. “Spare me the Masonic lect ure again. I know I’m the first Solomon who doesn’t want to join. But so what? Don’t you get it? I have no interest in playing dress-up with a bunch of ol d men!” His father was silent for a long time, and Bellamy noticed the fine age lines that had started to appe ar around Peter’s still-youthful eyes. “Yes, I get it,” Peter finally said. “Times are dif ferent now. I understand that Masonry probably appe ars strange to you, or maybe even boring. But I want yo u to know, that doorway will always be open for you"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"should you change your mind. ” “Don’t hold your breath,” Zach grumbled. “That’s enough!” Peter snapped, standing up. “I rea lize life has been a struggle for you, Zachary, but I am not your only guidepost. There are good men waiting for you, men who will welcome you within the Masonic fold and show you your true potential.” Zachary chuckled and glanced over at Bellamy. “Is t hat why you’re here, Mr. Bellamy? So you Masons can gang up on me?” Bellamy said nothing, instead directing a respectfu l gaze back at Peter Solomon—a reminder to Zachary of who held the power in this room. Zachary turned back to his father. “Zach,” Peter said, “we’re getting nowhere . . . so let me just tell you this. Whether or not you comp rehend the responsibility being offered to you tonight, it is my family obligation to present it.” He motione d to the pyramid. “It is a rare privilege to guard this pyra mid. I urge you to consider this opportunity for a few days before making your decision.” “Opportunity?” Zachary said. “Babysitting a rock?” “There are great mysteries in this world, Zach,” Pe ter said with a sigh. “Secrets that transcend your wildest imagination. This pyramid protects those secrets. A nd even more important, there will come a time, pro bably within your lifetime, when this pyramid will at las t be deciphered and its secrets unearthed. It will be a moment of great human transformation . . . and you have a chance to play a role in that moment. I want you to consider it very carefully. Wealth is commonplac e, but wisdom is rare.” He motioned to the portfoli o and then to the pyramid. “I beg you to remember that we alth without wisdom can often end in disaster.” Zachary looked like he thought his father was insan e. “Whatever you say, Dad, but there’s no way I’ m giving up my inheritance for this.” He gestured to the pyr amid. Peter folded his hands before him. “ If you choose to accept the responsibility, I will hold your money and the pyramid for you until you have successfully complet ed your education within the Masons. This will take years, but you will emerge with the maturity to rec eive both your money and this pyramid. Wealth and wisdom. A potent combination.” Zachary shot up. “Jesus, Dad! You don’t give up, do you? Can’t you see that I don’t give a damn about the Masons or stone pyramids and ancient mysteries?” He reached down and scooped up the black portfolio, waving it in front of his father’s face. “ This is my birthright! The same birthright of the Solomo ns who came before me! I can’t believe you’ d try to trick me out of my inheritance with lame s tories about ancient treasure maps!” He tucked the portfolio under his arm and ma rched past Bellamy to the study’s patio door. “Zachary, wait!” His father rushed after him as Zac hary stalked out into the night. “Whatever you do, you can never speak of the pyramid you have seen!” Pete r Solomon’s voice cracked. “Not to anyone ! Ever!” But Zachary ignored him, disappearing into the nigh t. Peter Solomon’ s gray eyes were filled with pain as he returned to his desk and sat heavily in his leather chair. After a long silence, he looked up at Bellamy and f orced a sad smile. “That went well.” Bellamy sighed, sharing in Solomon’s pain. “Peter, I don’t mean to sound insensitive . . . but . . . d o you trust him?” Solomon stared blankly into space. “ I mean . . . ” Bellamy pressed, “ not to say anything about the pyramid? ”"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" Solomon’s face was blank. “I really don’t know what to say, Warren. I’m not sure I even know him anymore.” Bellamy rose and walked slowly back and forth befor e the large desk. “Peter, you have followed your fa mily duty, but now, considering what just happened, I th ink we need to take precautions. I should return th e capstone to you so you can find a new home for it. Someone else should watch over it.” “Why?” Solomon asked. “If Zachary tells anyone about the pyramid . . . an d mentions my being present tonight . . .” “He knows nothing of the capstone, and he’s too immature to know the pyramid has any significance. We don’t need a new home for it. I’ll keep the pyramid in my vault. And you will keep the capstone wherev er you keep it. As we always have.” It was six years later, on Christmas Day, with the family still healing from Zachary’s death, that the enormous man claiming to have killed him in prison broke into the Solomon estate. The intruder had com e for the pyramid, but he had taken with him only Isa bel Solomon’s life. Days later, Peter summoned Bellamy to his office. H e locked the door and took the pyramid out of his v ault, setting it on the desk between them. “I should have listened to you.” Bellamy knew Peter was racked with guilt over this. “It wouldn’t have mattered.” Solomon drew a tired breath. “Did you bring the cap stone?” Bellamy pulled a small cube-shaped package from his pocket. The faded brown paper was tied with twine and bore a wax seal of Solomon’s ring. Bellamy laid the package on the desk, knowing the two halves of the Masonic Pyramid were closer together tonight than t hey should be. “Find someone else to watch this. Do n’t tell me who it is.” Solomon nodded. “And I know where you can hide the pyramid,” Bellam y said. He told Solomon about the Capitol Building subbasement. “There’s no place in Washington more s ecure.” Bellamy recalled Solomon liking the idea right away because it felt symbolically apt to hide the pyram id in the symbolic heart of our nation. Typical Solomon, Bellamy had thought. The idealist even in a crisis. Now, ten years later, as Bellamy was being shoved b lindly through the Library of Congress, he knew the crisis tonight was far from over. He also now knew whom Solomon had chosen to guard the capstone . . . and he prayed to God that Robert Langdon was up to the job. CHAPTER 62 I’m under Second Street. Langdon’s eyes remained tightly shut as the conveyo r rumbled through the darkness toward the Adams Building. He did his best not to picture the tons o f earth overhead and the narrow tube through which he was now traveling. He could hear Katherine breathing se veral yards ahead of him, but so far, she had not u ttered a"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"word. She’s in shock. Langdon was not looking forward to telling her abo ut her brother’s severed hand. You have to, Robert. She needs to know. “Katherine?” Langdon finally said, without opening his eyes. “Are you okay?” A tremulous, disembodied voice replied somewhere up ahead. “Robert, the pyramid you’re carrying. It’s Peter’s, isn’t it?” “Yes,” Langdon replied. A long silence followed. “I think . . . that pyrami d is why my mother was murdered.” Langdon was well aware that Isabel Solomon had been murdered ten years ago, but he didn’t know the details, and Peter had never mentioned anything abo ut a pyramid. “What are you talking about?” Katherine’s voice filled with emotion as she recoun ted the harrowing events of that night, how the tat tooed man had broken into their estate. “It was a long ti me ago, but I’ll never forget that he demanded a py ramid. He said he heard about the pyramid in prison, from my nephew, Zachary . . . right before he killed him .” Langdon listened in amazement. The tragedy within t he Solomon family was almost beyond belief. Katherine continued, telling Langdon that she had a lways believed the intruder was killed that night . . . that is, until this same man had resurfaced today, posin g as Peter’s psychiatrist and luring Katherine to h is home. “He knew private things about my brother, my mother ’s death, and even my work, ” she said anxiously, “things he could only have learned from my brother. And so I trusted him . . . and that’s how he got i nside the Smithsonian Museum Support Center.” Katherine to ok a deep breath and told Langdon she was nearly certain the man had destroyed her lab tonight. Langdon listened in utter shock. For several moment s, the two of them lay together in silence on the m oving conveyor. Langdon knew he had an obligation to shar e with Katherine the rest of tonight’s terrible new s. He began slowly, and as gently as he possibly could he told her how her brother had entrusted him with a small package years earlier, how Langdon had been tricked into bringing this package to Washington tonight, and finally, about her brother’s hand having been found in the Rotunda of the Capitol Building. Katherine’s reaction was deafening silence. Langdon could tell she was reeling, and he wished h e could reach out and comfort her, but lying end to end in the narrow blackness made it impossible. “Peter’ s okay,” he whispered. “He’s alive, and we’ll get h im back.” Langdon tried to give her hope. “Katherine, his captor promised me your brother would be returned alive . . . as long as I decipher the pyramid for h im.” Still Katherine said nothing. Langdon kept talking. He told her about the stone p yramid, its Masonic cipher, the sealed capstone, an d, of course, about Bellamy’s claims that this pyramid wa s in fact the Masonic Pyramid of legend . . . a map that revealed the hiding place of a long spiral staircas e that led deep into the earth . . . down hundreds of feet to a mystical ancient treasure that had been buried in W ashington long ago. Katherine finally spoke, but her voice was flat and emotionless. “Robert, open your eyes.” Open my eyes? Langdon had no desire to have even the slightest g limpse of how cramped this space really was. “Robert!” Katherine demanded, urgently now. “Open y our eyes! We’re here!” Langdon’s eyes flew open as his body emerged throug h an opening similar to the one it had entered at t he other end. Katherine was already climbing off the c onveyor belt. She lifted his daybag off the belt as"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Langdon swung his legs over the edge and jumped dow n onto the tile floor just in time, before the conv eyor turned the corner and headed back the way it came. The space around them was a circulation room much l ike the one they had come from in the other building. A small sign read ADAMS BUILDING: CIRCULATION ROOM 3. Langdon felt like he had just emerged from some kin d of subterranean birth canal. Born again. He turned immediately to Katherine. “Are you okay? ” Her eyes were red, and she had obviously been cryin g, but she nodded with a resolute stoicism. She pic ked up Langdon’s daybag and carried it across the room without a word, setting it on a cluttered desk. She lit the desk’s halogen clamp lamp, unzipped the bag, folded down the sides, and peered inside. The granite pyramid looked almost austere in the cl ean halogen light. Katherine ran her fingers over t he engraved Masonic cipher, and Langdon sensed deep em otion churning within her. Slowly, she reached into the daybag and pulled out the cube-shaped package. She held it under the light, examining it closely. “As you can see,” Langdon quietly said, “the wax se al is embossed with Peter’s Masonic ring. He said t his ring was used to seal the package more than a centu ry ago.” Katherine said nothing. “When your brother entrusted the package to me,” Lan gdon told her, “he said it would give me the power to create order out of chaos. I’m not entirely sure wh at that means, but I’ve got to assume the capstone reveals something important, because Peter was insistent th at it not fall into the wrong hands. Mr. Bellamy ju st told me the same thing, urging me to hide the pyramid an d not let anyone open the package.” Katherine turned now, looking angry. “Bellamy told you not to open the package?” “Yes. He was adamant.” Katherine looked incredulous. “But you said this ca pstone is the only way we can decipher the pyramid, right?” “Probably, yes.” Katherine’s voice was rising now. “And you said dec iphering the pyramid is what you were told to do. I t’s the only way we can get Peter back, right?” Langdon nodded. “Then, Robert, why wouldn’t we open the package and decipher this thing right now?!” Langdon didn’t know how to respond. “Katherine, I h ad the same exact reaction, and yet Bellamy told me that keeping this pyramid’s secret intact was more important than anything . . . including your brothe r’s life.” Katherine’s pretty features hardened, and she tucke d a wisp of hair behind her ears. When she spoke, h er voice was resolved. “This stone pyramid, whatever it is, has cost me my entire fami ly. First my nephew, Zachary, then my mother, and n ow my brother.And let’s face it, Robert, if you hadn’t called tonight to warn me . . .” Langdon could feel himself trapped between Katherin e’s logic and Bellamy’s steadfast urging. “I may be a scientist,” she said, “but I also come from a family of well-known Masons. Believe me, I’v e heard all the stories about the Masonic Pyramid and its promise of some great treasure that will enlig hten mankind. Honestly, I find it hard to imagine such a thing exists. However, if it does exist . . . perhaps it’s time to unveil it.” Katherine slid a finger beneath the old twine on the package. Langdon jumped. “ Katherine, no! Wait! ”"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" She paused, but her finger remained beneath the str ing. “Robert, I’m not going to let my brother die f or this. Whatever this capstone says . . . whatever lost tre asures this engraving might reveal . . . those secr ets end tonight.” With that, Katherine yanked defiantly on the twine, and the brittle wax seal exploded. CHAPTER 63 In a quiet neighborhood just west of Embassy Row in Washingto n, there exists a medieval-style walled garden whose roses, it is said, spring from twelfth -century plants. The garden’s Carderock gazebo—know n as Shadow House—sits elegantly amid meandering path ways of stones dug from George Washington’s private quarry. Tonight the silence of the gardens was broken by a young man who rushed through the wooden gate, shouting as he came. “Hello?” he called out, straining to see in the moo nlight. “Are you in here?” The voice that replied was frail, barely audible. “ In the gazebo . . . just taking some air.” The young man found his withered superior seated on the stone bench beneath a blanket. The hunched old man was tiny, with elfin features. The years had be nt him in two and stolen his eyesight, but his soul remained a force to be reckoned with. Catching his breath, the young man told him, “I jus t . . . took a call . . . from your friend . . . Wa rren Bellamy.” “Oh?” The old man perked up. “About what?” “He didn’t say, but he sounded like he was in a big hurry. He told me he left you a message on your vo ice mail, which you need to listen to right away.” “That’s all he said?” “Not quite.” The young man paused. “He told me to a sk you a question.” A very strange question. “He said he needed your response right away.” The old man leaned closer. “What question?” As the young man spoke Mr. Bellamy’s question, the pall that crossed the old man’s face was visible ev en in the moonlight. Immediately, he threw off his blanke t and began struggling to his feet. “Please help me inside. Right away.” CHAPTER 64"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" No more secrets, thought Katherine Solomon. On the table in front of her, the wax seal that had been intact for generations now lay in pieces. She finished removing the faded brown paper from her brother’ s precious package. Beside her, Langdon looked deci dedly uneasy. From within the paper, Katherine extracted a small box made of gray stone. Resembling a polished grani te cube, the box had no hinges, no latch, and no appar ent way inside. It reminded Katherine of a Chinese puzzle box. “It looks like a solid block,” she said, running he r fingers over the edges. “Are you sure the X-ray sh owed it was hollow? With a capstone inside?” “It did,” Langdon said, moving next to Katherine an d scrutinizing the mysterious box. He and Katherine peered at the box from different angles, attempting to find a way in. “Got it,” Katherine said as her fingernail located the hidden slit along one of the box’s top edges. S he set the box down on the desk and then carefully pried open the lid, which rose smoothly, like the top of a fin e jewelry box. When the lid fell back, Langdon and Katherine both drew audible breaths. The interior of the box seeme d to be glowing. The inside was shining with an almost s upernatural effulgence. Katherine had never seen a piece of gold this large, and it took her an instant to r ealize that the precious metal was simply reflectin g the radiance of the desk lamp. “It’s spectacular,” she whispered. Despite being se aled in a dark stone cube for over a century, the c apstone had not faded or tarnished in any way. Gold resists the entropic laws of decay; that’s one of the reasons the ancients considered it magical. Katherine felt her pulse quicken as she leaned for ward, peering down over the small golden point. “There’s an inscription.” Langdon moved closer, their shoulders now touching. His blue eyes flashed with curiosity. He had told Katherine about the ancient Greek practice of creat ing a symbolon—a code broken into parts—and how thi s capstone, long separated from the pyramid itself, w ould hold the key to deciphering the pyramid. Alleg edly, this inscription, whatever it said, would bring ord er from this chaos. Katherine held the little box up to the light and p eered straight down over the capstone. Though small, the inscription was perfectly visible —a small bit of elegantly engraved text on the face of one side. Katherine read the six simple words. Then she read them again. “No!” she declared. “That can’t be what it says!” Across the street, Director Sato hurried up the lon g walkway outside the Capitol Building toward her rendezvous point on First Street. The update from h er field team had been unacceptable. No Langdon. No pyramid. No capstone. Bellamy was in custody, but h e was not telling them the truth. At least not yet. I ’ll make him talk. She glanced back over her shoulder at one of Washin gton’s newest vistas—the Capitol Dome framed above the new visitor center. The illuminated dome only a ccentuated the significance of what was truly at st ake tonight. Dangerous times. Sato was relieved to hear her cell phone ring and s ee her analyst’s ID on the screen. "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"“ Nola, ” Sato answered. “ What have you got? ” Nola Kaye gave her the bad news. The X -ray of the capstone’s inscription was too faint to read, and the image-enhancing filters had not helped. Shit . Sato chewed at her lip. “How about the sixteen-let ter grid?” “I’m still trying,” Nola said, “but so far I’ve fou nd no secondary encryption scheme that’s applicable . I’ve got a computer reshuffling the letters in the grid and looking for anything identifiable, but there ar e over twenty trillion possibilities.” “Stay on it. Let me know.” Sato hung up, scowling. Her hopes of deciphering the pyramid using only a photograph and X-ray were fading fast. I need that pyramid and capstone . . . and I’m runn ing out of time. Sato arrived at First Street just as a black Escala de SUV with dark windows roared across the double y ellow and skidded to a stop in front of her at their rend ezvous point. A lone agent got out. “Any word yet on Langdon?” Sato demanded. “Confidence is high,” the man said, emotionless. “B ackup just arrived. All library exits are surrounde d. We even have air support coming in. We’ll flush him wi th tear gas, and he’ll have nowhere to run.” “And Bellamy?” “Tied up in the backseat.” Good. Her shoulder was still smarting. The agent handed Sato a plastic Ziploc bag containi ng cell phone, keys, and wallet. “Bellamy’s effects .” “Nothing else?” “No, ma’am. The pyramid and package must still be w ith Langdon.” “Okay,” Sato said. “Bellamy knows plenty he’s not t elling. I’d like to question him personally.” “Yes, ma’am. To Langley, then?” Sato took a deep breath and paced a moment beside t he SUV. Strict protocols governed the interrogation of U.S. civilians, and questioning Bellamy was highly illegal unless it was done at Langley on video with witnesses, attorneys, blah, blah, blah . . . “Not L angley,” she said, trying to think of somewhere clo ser. And more private. The agent said nothing, standing at attention besid e the idling SUV, waiting for orders. Sato lit a cigarette, took a long drag, and gazed d own at the Ziploc bag of Bellamy’s items. His key r ing, she had noticed, included an electronic fob adorned wit h four letters— USBG. Sato knew, of course, which government building this fob accessed. The building was very close and, at this hour, very private. She smiled and pocketed the fob. Perfect. When she told the agent where she wanted to take Be llamy, she expected the man to look surprised, but he simply nodded and opened the passenger door for her , his cold stare revealing nothing. Sato loved professionals. Langdon stood in the basement of the Adams Building and stared in disbelief at the elegantly inscribed words on the face of the golden capstone. That ’ s all it says?"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" Beside him, Katherine held the capstone under the l ight and shook her head. “There’s got to be more,” s he insisted, sounding cheated. “ This is what my brother has been protecting all these y ears?” Langdon had to admit he was mystified. According to Peter and Bellamy, this capstone was supposed to h elp them decipher the stone pyramid. In light of those claims, Langdon had expected something illuminating and helpful. More like obvious and useless. Once again, he read the six words delicately inscr ibed on the face of the capstone. The secret hides within The Order The secret hides within The Order? At first glance, the inscription appeared to be sta ting the obvious—that the letters on the pyramid we re out of “order” and that their secret lay in finding their proper sequence. This reading, however, in addition to being self-evident, seemed unlikely for another reason. “ The words the and order are capitalized,” Langdon said. Katherine nodded blankly. “I saw that.” The secret hides within The Order. Langdon could think of only one logical implicatio n. “ ‘The Order’ must be referencing the Masonic Order. ” “I agree,” Katherine said, “but it’s still no help. It tells us nothing.” Langdon had to concur. After all, the entire story of the Masonic Pyramid revolved around a secret hid den within the Masonic Order. “Robert, didn’t my brother tell you this capstone w ould give you power to see order where others saw only chaos ?” He nodded in frustration. For the second time tonig ht, Robert Langdon was feeling unworthy. CHAPTER 65 Once Mal’akh had finished dealing with his unexpected visitor—a female security guard from Preferred Security—he fixed the paint on the window through w hich she had glimpsed his sacred work space. Now, ascending out of the soft blue haze of the bas ement, he emerged through a hidden doorway into his living room. Inside, he paused, admiring his specta cular painting of the Three Graces and savoring the familiar smells and sounds of his home. Soon I will be leaving forever. Mal’akh knew that after tonight he would be unable to return to this place. After tonight, he thought, smiling, I will have no need for this place. He wondered if Robert Langdon yet understood the tr ue power of the pyramid . . . or the importance of the"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"role for which fate had chosen him. Langdon has yet to call me, Mal ’ akh thought, after double - checking for messages on his disposable phone. It was now 10:02 P.M. He has less than two hours. Mal’akh went upstairs to his Italian-marble bathroo m and turned on the steam shower to let it heat up. Methodically, he stripped off his clothes, eager to begin his cleansing ritual. He drank two glasses of water to calm his starving stomach. Then he walked to the full-length mirror a nd studied his naked body. His two days of fasting had accentuated his musculature, and he could not help but admire that which he had become. By dawn, I will be so much more. CHAPTER 66 “We should get out of here,” Langdon said to Katherine. “It’s only a matter of time before they figure out where we are.” He hoped Bellamy had managed to esca pe. Katherine still seemed fixated on the gold capstone , looking incredulous that the inscription was so unhelpful. She had taken the capstone out of the bo x, examined every side, and was now carefully putti ng it back in the box. The secret hides within The Order, Langdon thought. Big help. Langdon found himself wondering now if perhaps Pete r had been misinformed about the contents of the bo x. This pyramid and capstone had been created long bef ore Peter was born, and Peter was simply doing as h is forefathers had told him, keeping a secret that was probably as much a mystery to him as it was to Lan gdon and Katherine. What did I expect? Langdon wondered. The more he learned tonight abou t the Legend of the Masonic Pyramid, the less plausible it all seemed. I’m searching for a hidden spiral staircase covered by a huge stone? Something told Langdon he was chasing shadows. Non etheless, deciphering this pyramid seemed his best chance at saving Peter. “Robert, does the year 1514 mean anything to you?” Fifteen -fourteen? The question seemed apropos of nothing. Langdon sh rugged. “No. Why?” Katherine handed him the stone box. “Look. The box is dated. Have a look under the light.” Langdon took a seat at the desk and studied the cub e-shaped box beneath the light. Katherine put a sof t hand on his shoulder, leaning in to point out the tiny t ext she had found carved on the exterior of the box , near the bottom corner of one side. “Fifteen-fourteen A.D.,” she said, pointing into th e box. Sure enough, the carving depicted the number 1514, followed by an unusual stylization of the letters A and D. "},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" “This date,” Katherine was saying, sounding suddenly hopeful, “maybe it’s the link we’re missing? This dated cube looks a lot like a Masonic cornerstone, so maybe it’s pointing to a real cornerstone? Maybe to a building built in 1514 A.D.?” Langdon barely heard her. Fifteen -fourteen A.D. is not a date. The symbol , as any scholar of medieval art would r ecognize, was a well-known symbature—a symbol used in place of a signature. Many of the early phi losophers, artists, and authors signed their work w ith their own unique symbol or monogram rather than their nam e. This practice added a mysterious allure to their work and also protected them from persecution shoul d their writings or artwork be deemed counterestablishment. In the case of this symbature, the letters A.D. did not stand for Anno Domini . . . they were German for something else entirely. Langdon instantly saw all the pieces fall into plac e. Within seconds, he was certain he knew exactly h ow to decipher the pyramid. “Katherine, you did it,” he sa id, packing up. “That’s all we needed. Let’s go. I’ ll explain on the way.” Katherine looked amazed. “The date 1514 A.D. actual ly means something to you?” Langdon winked at her and headed for the door. “A.D . isn’t a date, Katherine. It’s a person. ” CHAPTER 67 West of Embassy Row, all was silent again inside the walle d garden with its twelfth-century roses and Shadow House gazebo. On the other side of an entry road, the young man was helping his hunched superio r walk across an expansive lawn. He ’s letting me guide him? Normally, the blind old man refused help, preferrin g to navigate by memory alone while on the grounds of his sanctuary. Tonight, however, he was apparently in a hurry to get inside and return Warren Bellamy’ s phone call. “Thank you,” the old man said as they entered the b uilding that held his private study. “I can find my way from here.” “Sir, I would be happy to stay and help—” “That’s all for tonight,” he said, letting go of hi s helper’s arm and shuffling hurriedly off into the darkness. “Good night.” The young man exited the building and walked back a cross the great lawn to his modest dwelling on the grounds. By the time he entered his flat, he could feel his curiosity gnawing at him. The old man clea rly had been upset by the question posed by Mr. Bellamy . . . and yet the question had seemed strange, almost meaningless."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" Is there no help for the widow ’s son? In his wildest imagination, he could not guess what this could mean. Puzzled, he went to his computer and typed in a search for this precise phrase. To his great surprise, page after page of reference s appeared, all citing this exact question. He read the information in wonderment. It seemed Warren Bellamy was not the first person in history to ask this st range question. These same words had been uttered centuri es ago . . . by King Solomon as he mourned a murder ed friend. The question was allegedly still spoken tod ay by Masons, who used it as a kind of encoded cry for help. Warren Bellamy, it seemed, was sending a dist ress call to a fellow Mason. CHAPTER 68 Albrecht Dürer? Katherine was trying to put the pieces together as she hurried with Langdon through the basement of th e Adams Building. A.D. stands for Albrecht Dürer? The famous sixteenth-century German engraver and painter was one of her brother’s favorite artists, and Katherine was vaguely familiar with his work. E ven so, she could not imagine how Dürer would be any help t o them in this case. For one thing, he’ s been dead more than four hundred years. “Dürer is symbolically perfect,” Langdon was saying as they followed the trail of illuminated EXIT signs. “He was the ultimate Renaissance mind—artist, philo sopher, alchemist, and a lifelong student of the Ancient Mysteries. To this day, nobody fully understands th e messages hidden in Dürer’s art.” “That may be true,” she said. “But how does ‘1514 A lbrecht Dürer’ explain how to decipher the pyramid? ” They reached a locked door, and Langdon used Bellam y’s key card to get through. “The number 1514,” Langdon said as they hurried up the stairs, “is pointing us to a very specific piec e of Dürer’s work.” They came into a huge corridor. Langd on glanced around and then pointed left. “This way. ” They moved quickly again. “Albrecht Dürer actually hid the number 1514 in his most mysterious piece of art— Melencolia I —which he completed in the year 1514. It’s consider ed the seminal work of the Northern European Renaissance.” Peter had once shown Katherine Melencolia I in an old book on ancient mysticism, but she didn’ t recall any hidden number 1514. “As you may know,” Langdon said, sounding excited, “ Melencolia I depicts mankind’s struggle to comprehend the Ancient Mysteries. The symbolism in Melencolia I is so complex it makes Leonardo da Vinci look overt.” Katherine stopped abruptly and looked at Langdon. “ Robert, Melencolia I is here in Washington. It hangs in the National Gallery.” “Yes,” he said with a smile, “and something tells m e that’s not a coincidence. The gallery is closed at this hour, but I know the curator and—” “Forget it, Robert, I know what happens when you go to museums.” Katherine headed off into a nearby alcove, where she saw a desk with a computer. "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Langdon followed, looking unhappy. “Let’s do this the easier way.” It seemed Professor Langdon, the art connoisseur, was having an ethica l dilemma about using the Internet when an original w as so nearby. Katherine stepped behind the desk and powered up the computer. When the machine finally c ame to life, she realized she had another problem. “There’s no icon for a browser.” “It’s an internal library network.” Langdon pointed to an icon on the desktop. “Try that.” Katherine clicked on the icon marked DIGITAL COLLECTIONS . The computer accessed a new screen, and Langdon pointed again. Katherine clicked on his choice of icon: FINE PRINTS COLLECTION . The screen refreshed. FINE PRINTS: SEARCH . “Type in ‘Albrecht Dürer.’ ” Katherine entered the name and then clicked the sea rch key. Within seconds, the screen began displayin g a series of thumbnail images. All of the images looke d to be similar in style—intricate black-and-white engravings. Dürer had apparently done dozens of sim ilar engravings. Katherine scanned the alphabetical list of his artw ork. Adam and Eve Betrayal of Christ Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Great Passion Last Supper Seeing all the biblical titles, Katherine recalled that Dürer practiced something called Mystic Christ ianity—a fusion of early Christianity, alchemy, astrology, a nd science. Science . . . The image of her lab in flames rushed through her m ind. She could barely process the long-term ramifications, but for the moment, her thoughts tur ned to her assistant, Trish. I hope she made it out. Langdon was saying something about Dürer’ s version of the Last Supper, but Katherine was bar ely listening. She had just seen the link for Melencolia I. She clicked the mouse, and the page refreshed with general information. Melencolia I, 1514 Albrecht Dürer (engraving on laid paper) Rosenwald Collection National Gallery of Art Washington, D.C. When she scrolled down, a high-res digital image of Dürer’s masterpiece appeared in all its glory. Katherine stared in bewilderment, having forgotten just how strange it was. "},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Langdon gave an understanding chuckle. “ As I said, it ’ s cryptic. ” Melencolia I consisted of a brooding figure with giant wings, s eated in front of a stone building, surrounded by the most disparate and bizarre collection of obj ects imaginable—measuring scales, an emaciated dog, carpenter’s tools, an hourglass, various geometric solids, a hanging bell, a putto , a blade, a ladder. Katherine vaguely recalled her brother telling her that the winged figure was a representation of “hum an genius”—a great thinker with chin in hand, looking depressed, still unable to achieve enlightenment. T he genius is surrounded with all of the symbols of his human intellect—objects of science, math, philosop hy, nature, geometry, even carpentry—and yet is still u nable to climb the ladder to true enlightenment. Even the human genius has difficulty comprehending the Ancie nt Mysteries. “Symbolically,” Langdon said, “this represents mank ind’s failed attempt to transform human intellect into god like power. In alchemical terms, it represents our inability to turn lead into gold.” “Not a particularly encouraging message,” Katherine agreed. “So how does it help us?” She did not see t he hidden number 1514 that Langdon was talking about. “Order from chaos,” Langdon said, flashing a lopsid ed grin. “Just as your brother promised.” He reache d in his pocket and pulled out the grid of letters he ha d written earlier from the Masonic cipher. “Right n ow, this grid is meaningless.” He spread the paper out on th e desk. Katherine eyed the grid. Definitely meaningless. “But Dürer will transform it.” “And how might he do that?” “Linguistic alchemy.” Langdon motioned to the compu ter screen. “Look carefully. Hidden in this masterpiece is something that will make sense of ou r sixteen letters.” He waited. “Do you see it yet? Look for the number 1514.” Katherine was in no mood to play classroom. “Robert , I see nothing— an orb, a ladder, a knife, a polyhedron, a scale? I give up.” “Look! There in the background. Carved into that bu ilding behind the angel? Beneath the bell? Dürer engraved a square that is full of numbers.” "},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Katherine now saw the square that contained numbers , among them 1514. “Katherine, that square is the key to deciphering t he pyramid!” She shot him a surprised look. “That’s not just any square,” Langdon said, grinning. “That, Ms. Solomon, is a magic square.” CHAPTER 69 Where the hell are they taking me? Bellamy was still blindfolded in the back of an SUV . After a short stop somewhere close to the Library of Congress, the vehicle had continued on . . . but on ly for a minute. Now the SUV had stopped again, hav ing again traveled only about a block. Bellamy heard muffled voices talking. “Sorry . . . impossible . . .” an authoritative voi ce was saying. “ . . . closed at this hour . . .” The man driving the SUV replied with equal authorit y. “CIA investigation . . . national security . . . ” Apparently the exchange of words and IDs was persua sive, because the tone shifted immediately. “Yes, of course . . . service entrance . . .” There was the loud grinding of what sounded like a garag e door, and as it opened, the voice added, “Shall I accompa ny you? Once you’re inside, you won’t be able to ge t through—” “No. We have access already.” If the guard was surprised, it was too late. The SU V was moving again. It advanced about fifty yards a nd then came to a stop. The heavy door rumbled closed again behind them. Silence. Bellamy realized he was trembling. With a bang, the SUV’s rear hatch flew open. Bellam y felt a sharp pain in his shoulders as someone dra gged him out by his arms, then lifted him to his feet. W ithout a word, a powerful force led him across a wi de expanse of pavement. There was a strange, earthy sm ell here that he could not place. There were footst eps of someone else walking with them, but whoever it was had yet to speak. They stopped at a door, and Bellamy heard an electr onic ping. The door clicked open. Bellamy was manhandled through several corridors and could not help but notice that the air was warmer and more hu mid. An indoor pool, maybe? No. The smell in the air was not chlorine . . . it was far more earthy and primal. Where the hell are we?! Bellamy knew he could not be more than a block or two from the Capitol Building. Again they stopped, and again he heard the electron ic beep of a security door. This one slid open with a hiss. As they pushed him through, the smell that hit him was unmistakable. Bellamy now realized where they were. My God! He came here often, although never through the ser vice entrance. This magnificent glass building was only three hundred yards from the Capitol Building and w as"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"technically part of the Capitol Complex. I run this place! Bellamy now realized it was his own key fob that was giving them access. Powerful arms pushed him through the doorway, leadi ng him down a familiar, winding walkway. The heavy, damp warmth of this place usually felt comforting t o him. Tonight, he was sweating. What are we doing here?! Bellamy was halted suddenly and seated on a bench. The man with the muscles unhooked his handcuffs onl y long enough to reaffix them to the bench behind his back. “What do you want from me?” Bellamy demanded, heart pounding wildly. The only response he received was the sound of boot s walking off and the glass door sliding shut. Then silence. Dead silence. They’re just going to leave me here? Bellamy was sweating more heavily now as he strugg led to release his hands. I can’t even take off my blindfold? “Help!” he shouted. “Anybody!” Even as he called out in panic, Bellamy knew nobody was going to hear him. This massive glass room— known as the Jungle—was entirely airtight when the doors were closed. They left me in the Jungle, he thought. Nobody will find me until morning. Then he heard it. The sound was barely audible, but it terrified Bell amy like no sound he had ever heard in his life. Something breathing. Very close. He was not alone on the bench. The sudden hiss of a sulfur match sizzled so close to his face that he could feel the heat. Bellamy re coiled, instinctively yanking hard at his chains. Then, without warning, a hand was on his face, remo ving his blindfold. The flame before him reflected in the black eyes of Inoue Sato as she pressed the match against the ci garette dangling from her lips, only inches away from Bella my’s face. She glared at him in the moonlight that filtered do wn through the glass ceiling. She looked pleased to see his fear. “So, Mr. Bellamy,” Sato said, shaking out the match . “Where shall we begin?” CHAPTER 70 "},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"A magic square. Katherine nodded as she eyed the numbered square i n Dürer ’ s engraving. Most people would have thought Langdon had lost his mind, but K atherine had quickly realized he was right. The term magic square referred not to something mystical but to somethin g mathematical—it was the name given to a grid of consecutive numbers arranged in such a way that all the rows, columns, and diagonal s added up to the same thing. Created some four thous and years ago by mathematicians in Egypt and India, magic squares were still believed by some to hold m agical powers. Katherine had read that even nowaday s devout Indians drew special three-by-three magic sq uares called the Kubera Kolam on their pooja altars . Primarily, though, modern man had relegated magic s quares to the category of “recreational mathematics ,” some people still deriving pleasure from the quest to discover new “magical” configurations.

Katherine quickly analyzed Dürer’s square, adding u p the numbers in several rows and columns. “Thirty-four,” she said. “Every direction adds up t o thirty-four.” “Exactly,” Langdon said. “But did you know that this magic square is famous because Dürer accomplished the seemingly impossible?” He quickly showed Kather ine that in addition to making the rows, columns, a nd diagonals add up to thirty-four, Dürer had also fou nd a way to make the four quadrants, the four cente r squares, and even the four corner squares add up to that number. “Most amazing, though, was Dürer’s ab ility to position the numbers 15 and 14 together in the b ottom row as an indication of the year in which he accomplished this incredible feat!” Katherine scanned the numbers, amazed by all the co mbinations. Langdon’s tone grew more excited now. “Extraordinar ily, Melencolia I represents the very first time in history that a magic square appeared in European art. Some historians believe this was Dürer’s enco ded way of indicating that the Ancient Mysteries had travel ed outside the Egyptian Mystery Schools and were no w held by the European secret societies.” Langdon pau sed. “Which brings us back to . . . this .” He motioned to the slip of paper bearing the grid o f letters from the stone pyramid. "},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" “I assume the layout looks familiar now?” Langdon a sked. “Four-by-four square.” Langdon picked up the pencil and carefully transcri bed Dürer’s numbered magic square onto the slip of paper, directly beside the lettered square. Katheri ne was now seeing just how easy this was going to b e. He stood poised, pencil in hand, and yet . . . strange ly, after all this enthusiasm, he seemed to hesitat e. “Robert?” He turned to her, his expression one of trepidation . “Are you sure we want to do this? Peter expressly—” “Robert, if you don’t want to decipher this engraving, then I will.” She held out her hand for the pencil. Langdon could tell there would be no deterring her and so he acquiesced, turning his attention back to the pyramid. Carefully, he superimposed the magic squar e over the pyramid’s grid of letters and assigned e ach letter a number. Then he created a new grid, placin g the Masonic cipher’s letters in the new order as defined by the sequence in Dürer’s magic square. When Langdon was finished, they both examined the r esult. "},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Katherine immediately felt confused. “ It ’ s still gibberish. ” Langdon remained silent a long moment. “Actually, K atherine, it’s not gibberish.” His eyes brightened again with the thrill of discovery. “It’s . . . Latin.” In a long, dark corridor, an old blind man shuffled as quickly as he could toward his office. When he finally arrived, he collapsed in his desk chair, his old bo nes grateful for the reprieve. His answering machin e was beeping. He pressed the button and listened. “It’s Warren Bellamy,” said the hushed whisper of h is friend and Masonic brother. “I’m afraid I have alarming news . . .” Katherine Solomon’s eyes shot back to the grid of l etters, reexamining the text. Sure enough, a Latin word now materialized before her eyes. Jeova. Katherine had not studied Latin, but this word was familiar from her reading of ancient Hebrew texts. Jeova. Jehovah. As her eyes continued to trace downward, reading t he grid like a book, she was surprised to realize she could read the entire text of the pyramid. Jeova Sanctus Unus. She knew its meaning at once. This phrase was ubiqu itous in modern translations of Hebrew scripture. I n the Torah, the God of the Hebrews was known by many nam es— Jeova, Jehovah, Jeshua, Yahweh, the Source, the Elohim— but many Roman translations had consolidated the co nfusing nomenclature into a single Latin phrase: Jeova Sanctus Unus. “One true God?” she whispered to herself. The phras e certainly did not seem like something that would help them find her brother. “That’s this pyramid’s secre t message? One true God? I thought this was a map.” Langdon looked equally perplexed, the excitement in his eyes evaporating. “This decryption obviously i s correct, but . . .” “The man who has my brother wants to know a location .” She tucked her hair behind her ear. “This is not going to make him very happy.” “Katherine,” Langdon said, heaving a sigh. “I’ve bee n afraid of this. All night, I’ve had a feeling we’ re treating as reality a collection of myths and alleg ories. Maybe this inscription is pointing to a metaphorical location—telling us that the true potential of man can be accessed only through the one true God.” “ But that makes no sense ! ” Katherine replied, her jaw now clenched in frustrat ion. “ My family protected this"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"pyramid for generations! One true God? That ’ s the secret? And the CIA considers this an issue of national security? Either they’re lying or we’re missing som ething!” Langdon shrugged in accord. Just then, his phone began to ring. In a cluttered office lined with old books, the old man hunched over his desk, clutching a phone recei ver in his arthritic hand. The line rang and rang. At last, a tentative voice answered. “Hello?” The v oice was deep but uncertain. The old man whispered, “I was told you require sanc tuary.” The man on the line seemed startled. “Who is this? Did Warren Bell—” “No names, please,” the old man said. “Tell me, hav e you successfully protected the map that was entru sted to you?” A startled pause. “Yes . . . but I don’t think it m atters. It doesn’t say much. If it is a map, it see ms to be more metaphorical than—” “No, the map is quite real, I assure you. And it po ints to a very real location. You must keep it safe. I cannot impress upon you enough how important this is. You are being pursued, but if you can travel unseen to my location, I will provide sanctuary . . . and answer s.” The man hesitated, apparently uncertain. “My friend,” the old man began, choosing his words carefully. “There is a refuge in Rome, north of the Tiber, which contains ten stones from Mount Sinai, one from heaven itself, and one with the visage of Luke’ s dark father. Do you know my location?” There was a long pause on the line, and then the ma n replied, “Yes, I do.” The old man smiled . I thought you might, Professor. “ Come at once. Make sure you’re not followed.” CHAPTER 71 Mal’akh stood naked in the billowing warmth of his steam shower. He felt pure again, having washed off the last remaining scent of ethanol. As the eucalyp tus-infused vapors permeated his skin, he could fee l his pores opening to the heat. Then he began his ritual . First, he rubbed depilatory chemicals across his ta ttooed body and scalp, removing any traces of body hair. Hairless were the gods of the seven islands of Heli ades. Then he massaged Abramelin oil into his softened and receptive flesh. Abramelin is the sacred oil of the great Magi. Then he turned his shower lever hard to the left, and the water turned ice cold. He stood b eneath the frigid water for a full minute to close his pores and trap the heat and energy within his core. The c old served as a reminder of the icy river in which this transformation had begun. "},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"When he stepped from the shower, he was shivering, but within seconds, his core heat emanated up throu gh his layers of flesh and warmed him. Mal’akh’s insid es felt like a furnace. He stood naked before the m irror and admired his form . . . perhaps the last time he would see himself as a mere mortal. His feet were the talons of a hawk. His legs—Boaz a nd Jachin—were the ancient pillars of wisdom. His h ips and abdomen were the archways of mystical power. Ha nging beneath the archway, his massive sex organ bore the tattooed symbols of his destiny. In anothe r life, this heavy shaft of flesh had been his sour ce of carnal pleasure. But no longer. I have been purified. Like the mystical eunuch monks of Katharoi, Mal’akh had removed his testicles. He had sacrificed his physical potency for a more worthy one. Gods have no gender. Having shed the human imperfection of gender along with the earthly pull of sexual tempta tion, Mal’akh had become like Ouranos, Attis, Sporu s, and the great castrati magicians of Arthurian legen d. Every spiritual metamorphosis is preceded by a physical one. Such was the lesson of all the great gods . . . fr om Osiris, to Tammuz, to Jesus, to Shiva, to the Buddha himself. I must shed the man who clothes me. Abruptly, Mal’akh drew his gaze upward, past the do uble-headed phoenix on his chest, past the collage of ancient sigils adorning his face, and directly to t he top of his head. He tipped his head toward the m irror, barely able to see the circle of bare flesh that wa ited there. This location on the body was sacred. K nown as the fontanel, it was the one area of the human skul l that remained open at birth. An oculus to the brain. Although this physiological portal closes within a matter of months, it remains a symbolic vestige of the lost connection between the outer and inner worlds. Mal’akh studied the sacred patch of virginal skin, which was enclosed by the crownlike circle of an ouroboros —a mystical snake devouring its own tail. The bare flesh seemed to stare back at him . . . bright with promise. Robert Langdon soon would uncover the great treasur e that Mal’akh required. Once Mal’akh possessed it, the void on top of his head would be filled, and he would at last be prepared for his final transforma tion. Mal’akh padded across his bedroom and took from his bottom drawer a long strip of white silk. As he ha d done many times before, he wrapped it around his gr oin and buttocks. Then he went downstairs. In his office, his computer had received an e-mail message. It was from his contact: WHAT YOU REQUIRE IS NOW WITHIN REACH. I WILL CONTACT YOU WITHIN THE HOUR. PATIENCE. Mal’akh smiled. It was time to make final preparati ons. CHAPTER 72 The CIA field agent was in a foul mood as he descended fro m the reading-room balcony. Bellamy lied to us. The agent had seen no heat signatures whatsoever up stairs near the Moses statue, nor anywhere else ups tairs"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"for that matter. So where the hell did Langdon go? The agent retraced his steps now to the only place they’d spotted any heat signatures at all—the libra ry’s distribution hub. He descended the stairs again, mo ving beneath the octagonal console. The noise of th e rumbling conveyors was grating. Advancing into the space, he flipped down his thermal goggles and scan ned the room. Nothing. He looked toward the stacks, whe re the mangled door still showed hot from the explosion. Other than that, he saw no— Holy shit! The agent jumped back as an unexpected luminescence drifted into his field of vision. Like a pair of g hosts, the dimly glowing imprints of two humanoids had jus t emerged from the wall on a conveyor belt. Heat signatures. Stunned, the agent watched as the two apparitions c ircled the room on the conveyor loop and then disappeared headfirst into a narrow hole in the wal l . They rode the conveyor out? That’s insanity. In addition to realizing they had just lost Robert Langdon through a hole in the wall, the field agent was now aware that he had another problem. Langdon’s not alone? He was just about to switch on his transceiver and call the team leader, but the team leader beat him to it. “All points, we’ve got an abandoned Volvo on the pl aza in front of the library. Registered to one Kath erine Solomon. Eyewitness says she entered the library no t long ago. We suspect she’s with Robert Langdon. Director Sato has ordered that we find them both im mediately.” “I’ve got heat signatures for both of them!” shouted the field agent in the distribution room. H e explained the situation. “For Christ’s sake!” the team leader replied. “Where the hell does the conveyor go?” The field agent was already consulting the employee reference schematic on the bulletin board. “Adams Building,” he replied. “One block from here.” “All points. Redirect to the Adams Building! NOW!” CHAPTER 73 Sanctuary. Answers. The words echoed in Langdon’s mind as he and Kather ine burst through a side door of the Adams Building and out into the cold winter night. The mysterious caller had conveyed his location cryptically, but L angdon had understood. Katherine’s reaction to their desti nation had been surprisingly sanguine: Where better to find One True God? Now the question was how to get there. Langdon spun in place, trying to get his bearings. It was dark, but thankfully the weather had cleared . They were standing in a small courtyard. In the distance , the Capitol Dome looked startlingly far away, and"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Langdon realized this was the first moment he had s tepped outside since arriving at the Capitol severa l hours ago. So much for my lecture. “Robert, look.” Katherine pointed toward the silhou ette of the Jefferson Building. Langdon’s first reaction on seeing the building was astonishment that they had traveled so far undergr ound on a conveyor belt. His second reaction, however, w as alarm. The Jefferson Building was now abuzz with activity—trucks and cars pulling in, men shouting. Is that a searchlight? Langdon grabbed Katherine’s hand. “Come on.” They ran northeast across the courtyard, quickly di sappearing from view behind an elegant U-shaped building, which Langdon realized was the Folger Sha kespeare Library. This particular building seemed appropriate camouflage for them tonight, as it hous ed the original Latin manuscript of Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis, the utopian vision on which the American forefathe rs had allegedly modeled a new world based on ancient knowledge. Even so, Langdon would not be st opping. We need a cab. They arrived at the corner of Third Street and East Capitol. The traffic was sparse, and Langdon felt fading hope as he scanned for taxis. He and Katherine hurr ied northward on Third Street, putting distance bet ween themselves and the Library of Congress. It was not until they had gone an entire block that Langdon fi nally spotted a cab rounding the corner. He flagged it do wn, and the cab pulled over. Middle Eastern music played on his radio, and the y oung Arab driver gave them a friendly smile. “Where to?” the driver asked as they jumped into the car. “We need to go to—” “Northwest!” Katherine interjected, pointing up Thi rd Street away from the Jefferson Building. “Drive toward Union Station, then left on Massachusetts Av enue. We’ll tell you when to stop.” The driver shrugged, closed the Plexiglas divider, and turned his music back on. Katherine shot Langdon an admonishing look as if to say: “Leave no trail . ” She pointed out the window, directing Langdon’s attention to a black helicopter that was skimming in low, approaching the area. Shit. Sato was apparently dead serious about recovering S olomon’s pyramid. As they watched the helicopter land between the Jef ferson and Adams buildings, Katherine turned to him , looking increasingly worried. “Can I see your cell phone for a second?” Langdon handed her his phone. “Peter told me you have an eidetic memory?” she sai d, rolling down her window. “And that you remember every phone number you’ve ever dialed?” “That’s true, but—” Katherine hurled his phone out into the night. Lang don spun in his seat and watched as his cell phone cartwheeled and splintered into pieces on the pavem ent behind them. “Why did you do that!” “Off the grid,” Katherine said, her eyes grave. “Th is pyramid is our only hope of finding my brother, and I have no intention of letting the CIA steal it from us.” In the front seat, Omar Amirana bobbed his head and hummed along with his music. Tonight had been slow , and he felt blessed to finally have a fare. His cab was just passing Stanton Park, when the familiar v oice of"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"his company dispatcher crackled over the radio. “This is Dispatch. All vehicles in the area of the National Mall. We have just received a bulletin fro m government authorities regarding two fugitives in t he area of the Adams Building . . .” Omar listened in amazement as Dispatch described th e precise couple in his cab. He stole an uneasy glance in his rearvi ew mirror. Omar had to admit, the tall guy did look familiar somehow. Did I see him on America’s Most Wanted ? Gingerly, Omar reached for his radio handset. “Disp atch?” he said, speaking quietly into the transceiv er. “This is cab one-three-four. The two people you ask ed about—they are in my cab . . . right now.” Dispatch immediately advised Omar what to do. Omar’ s hands were trembling as he called the phone number Dispatch had given him. The voice that answe red was tight and efficient, like that of a soldier . “This is Agent Turner Simkins, CIA field ops. Who i s this?” “Um . . . I’m the taxi driver?” Omar said. “I was t old to call about the two—” “Are the fugitives currently in your vehicle? Answe r only yes or no.” “Yes.” “Can they hear this conversation? Yes or no?” “No. The slider is—” “Where are you taking them?” “Northwest on Massachusetts.” “Specific destination?” “They didn’t say.” The agent hesitated. “Is the male passenger carryin g a leather bag?” Omar glanced in the rearview mirror, and his eyes w ent wide. “Yes! That bag doesn’t have explosives or anything in—” “Listen carefully,” the agent said. “You are in no danger so long as you follow my directions exactly. Is that clear?” “Yes, sir.” “What is your name?” “Omar,” he said, breaking a sweat. “Listen, Omar,” the man said calmly. “You’re doing great. I want you to drive as slowly as possible wh ile I get my team out in front of you. Do you understand? ” “Yes, sir.” “Also, is your cab equipped with an intercom system so you can communicate with them in the backseat?” “Yes, sir.” "},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"“ Good. Here ’ s what I want you to do. ” CHAPTER 74 The Jungle, as it is known, is the centerpiece of the U.S. Bot anic Garden (USBG)—America’s living museum—located adjacent to the U.S. Capitol Buildin g. Technically a rain forest, the Jungle is housed in a towering greenhouse, complete with soaring rubber t rees, strangler figs, and a canopy catwalk for more daring tourists. Normally, Warren Bellamy felt nurtured by the Jungl e ’s earthy smells and the sunlight glinting through the mist that filtered down from the vapor nozzles in t he glass ceiling. Tonight, however, lit only by moo nlight, the Jungle terrified him. He was sweating profusely , writhing against the cramps that now stabbed at h is arms, still pinned painfully behind him. Director Sato paced before him, puffing calmly on h er cigarette—the equivalent of ecoterrorism in this carefully calibrated environment. Her face looked a lmost demonic in the smoke-filled moonlight that streamed down through the glass ceiling overhead. “So then,” Sato continued, “when you arrived at the Capitol tonight, and you discovered that I was alr eady there . . . you made a decision. Rather than making your presence known to me, you descended quietly i nto the SBB, where, at great risk to yourself, you atta cked Chief Anderson and myself, and you helped Lang don escape with the pyramid and capstone.” She rubbed h er shoulder. “An interesting choice.” A choice I would make again, Bellamy thought. “Where is Peter?” he demanded angr ily. “How would I know?” Sato said. “You seem to know everything else!” Bellamy fired back at her, making no attempt to hid e his suspicion that she was somehow behind all this. “You knew to go to the Capitol Building. You knew to find Robert Langdon. And you even knew to X-ray Langdon’s bag t o find the capstone. Obviously, someone is giving you a lot of inside information.” Sato laughed coldly and stepped closer to him. “Mr. Bellamy, is that why you attacked me? Do you think I’ m the enemy ? Do you think I’m trying to steal your little pyra mid?” Sato took a drag on her cigarette and blew the smoke out of her nostrils. “Listen carefully. N o one understands better than I do the importance o f keeping secrets. I believe, as you do, that there i s certain information to which the masses should no t be privy. Tonight, however, there are forces at work t hat I fear you have not yet grasped. The man who kidnapped Peter Solomon holds enormous power . . . a power that you apparently have yet to realize. Be lieve me, he is a walking time bomb . . . capable of init iating a series of events that will profoundly chan ge the world as you know it.” “I don’t understand.” Bellamy shifted on the bench, his arms aching in his handcuffs. “You don’t need to understand. You need to obey. Right now, my onl y hope of averting a major disaster is to cooperate with this man . . . and to give him exact ly what he wants. Which means, you are going to cal l Mr. Langdon and tell him to turn himself in, along with the pyramid and capstone. Once Langdon is in my custody, he will decrypt the pyramid’s inscription, obtain whatever information this man is demanding, and provide him with exactly what he wants.” The location of the spiral staircase that leads to the Ancient Mysteries? “I can’t do that. I’ve taken vows of secrecy. ”"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" Sato erupted. “I don’t give a damn what you’ve vowed, I will throw you in prison so fast—” “Threaten me all you like,” Bellamy said defiantly. “I will not help you.” Sato took a deep breath and spoke now in a fearsome whisper. “Mr. Bellamy, you have no idea what’s rea lly going on tonight, do you?” The tense silence hung for several seconds, finally broken by the sound of Sato’s phone. She plunged h er hand into her pocket and eagerly snatched it out. “ Talk to me,” she answered, listening carefully to t he reply. “Where is their taxi now? How long? Okay, good. Bri ng them to the U.S. Botanic Garden. Service entranc e. And make sure you get me that god-damn pyramid and capstone.” Sato hung up and turned back to Bellamy with a smug smile. “Well then . . . it seems you’re fast outli ving your usefulness.” CHAPTER 75 Robert Langdon stared blankly into space, feeling too tired to ur ge the slow-moving taxi driver to pick up the pace. Beside him, Katherine had fallen silent, too, looking frustrated by their lack of understand ing of what made the pyramid so special. They had again be en through everything they knew about the pyramid, the capstone, and the evening’s strange events; the y still had no ideas as to how this pyramid could p ossibly be considered a map to anything at all. Jeova Sanctus Unus? The secret hides within The Ord er? Their mysterious contact had promised them answers if they could meet him at a specific place. A refuge in Rome, north of the Tiber. Langdon knew the forefathers’ “new Rome” had been renamed Washington early in her history, and yet vestiges of their original dream remained: the Tiber’s waters still flowed int o the Potomac; senators still convened beneath a replica of St. Peter’ s dome; and Vulcan and Minerva still watched over the Rotunda’s long-extinguished flame. The answers sought by Langdon and Katherine were ap parently waiting for them just a few miles ahead. Northwest on Massachusetts Avenue. Their destination was indeed a refuge . . . north of Washington’s Tiber Creek. Langdon wished the driver would speed up. Abruptly, Katherine jolted upright in her seat, as if she had made a sudden realization. “Oh my God, R obert!” She turned to him, her face going white. She hesita ted a moment and then spoke emphatically. “We’re go ing the wrong way!” “No, this is right,” Langdon countered. “It’s north west on Massachu—” “No! I mean we’re going to the wrong place !” Langdon was mystified. He had already told Katherin e how he knew what location was being described by the mysterious caller. It contains ten stones from Mount Sinai, one from h eaven itself, and one with the visage of Luke’s dark father. Only one building on earth could make those claims . And that was exactly where this taxi was headed. “Katherine, I’m certain the location is correct.” "},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"“ No! ” she shouted. “ We don ’ t need to go there anymore. I figured out the pyramid and capstone! I know what this is all about!” Langdon was amazed. “You understand it?” “Yes! We have to go to Freedom Plaza instead!” Now Langdon was lost. Freedom Plaza, although nearb y, seemed totally irrelevant. “Jeova Sanctus Unus!” Katherine said. “The One True God of the Hebrews. The sacred symbol of the Hebrews is the Jewish star—the Seal of Solomon—an importan t symbol to the Masons!” She fished a dollar bill out of her pocket. “Give me your pen.” Bewildered, Langdon pulled a pen from his jacket. “Look.” She spread the bill out on her thigh and to ok his pen, pointing to the Great Seal on the back. “If you superimpose Solomon’s seal on the Great Seal of the United States . . .” She drew the symbol of a Jewish star precisely over the pyramid. “Look what you get!” Langdon looked down at the bill and then back at Ka therine as if she were mad. “Robert, look more closely! Don’t you see what I’m pointing at?” He glanced back at the drawing. What in the world is she getting at? Langdon had seen this image before. It was popular among conspiracy theorists as “proof” that the Masons held secret in fluence over our early nation. When the six-pointed star was laid perfectly over the Great Seal of the Unite d States, the star’ s top vertex fit perfectly over the Masonic all-seeing eye . . . and, quite eerily, the other f ive vertices clearly pointed to the letters M-A-S-O-N. “ Katherine, that ’ s just a coincidence, and I still don ’ t see how it has anything to do with Freedom Plaza. ”"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" “Look again!” she said, sounding almost angry now. “You’re not looking where I am pointing ! Right there. Don’t you see it?” An instant later, Langdon saw it. CIA field-operations leader Turner Simkins stood ou tside the Adams Building and pressed his cell phone tightly to his ear, straining to hear the conversat ion now taking place in the back of the taxi. Something just happened. His team was about to board the modified Sikorsky UH- 60 helicopter to head northwest and set up a roadblock, but now it seemed the situation had su ddenly changed. Seconds ago, Katherine Solomon had begun insisting they were going to the wrong destination. Her explanation—something about the dollar bill and Jew ish stars—made no sense to the team leader, nor, apparently, to Robert Langdon. At least at first. N ow, however, Langdon seemed to have grasped her meaning. “My God, you’re right!” Langdon blurted. “I didn’t s ee it earlier!” Suddenly Simkins could hear someone banging on the driver’s divider, and then it slid open. “Change of plans,” Katherine shouted to the driver. “Take us t o Freedom Plaza!” “Freedom Plaza?” the cabbie said, sounding nervous. “Not northwest on Massachusetts?” “Forget that!” Katherine shouted. “Freedom Plaza! G o left here! Here! HERE!” Agent Simkins heard the cab screeching around a cor ner. Katherine was talking excitedly again to Langd on, saying something about the famous bronze cast of th e Great Seal embedded in the plaza. “Ma’am, just to confirm,” the cabbie’s voice interj ected, sounding tense. “We’re going to Freedom Plaz a— on the corner of Pennsylvania and Thirteenth?” “Yes!” Katherine said. “Hurry!” “It’s very close. Two minutes.” Simkins smiled. Nicely done, Omar. As he dashed toward the idling helicopter, he shou ted to his team. “We’ve got them! Freedom Plaza! Move!” CHAPTER 76 Freedom Plaza is a map. Located at the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and Th irteenth Street, the plaza’s vast surface of inlaid stone depicts the streets of Washington as they were orig inally envisioned by Pierre L’Enfant. The plaza is a popular tourist destination not only because the gi ant map is fun to walk on, but also because Martin Luther King Jr., for whom Freedom Plaza is named, wrote mu ch of his “I Have a Dream” speech in the nearby Willard Hotel. D.C. cabdriver Omar Amirana brought tourists to Fre edom Plaza all the time, but tonight, his two passe ngers were obviously no ordinary sightseers. The CIA is chasing them? Omar had barely come to a stop at the curb before the man and woman had jumped out."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" “Stay right here!” the man in the tweed coat told O mar. “We’ll be right back!” Omar watched the two people dash out onto the wide- open spaces of the enormous map, pointing and shouting as they scanned the geometry of intersecti ng streets. Omar grabbed his cell phone off the das hboard. “Sir, are you still there?” “Yes, Omar!” a voice shouted, barely audible over a thundering noise on his end of the line. “Where ar e they now?” “Out on the map. It seems like they’re looking for something.” “Do not let them out of your sight,” the agent shou ted. “I’m almost there!” Omar watched as the two fugitives quickly found the plaza’s famous Great Seal—one of the largest bronz e medallions ever cast. They stood over it a moment a nd quickly began pointing to the southwest. Then th e man in tweed came racing back toward the cab. Omar quickly set his phone down on the dashboard as the man arrived, breathless. “Which direction is Alexandria, Virginia?” he deman ded. “Alexandria?” Omar pointed southwest, the exact sam e direction the man and woman had just pointed toward. “I knew it!” the man whispered beneath his breath. He spun and shouted back to the woman. “You’re right ! Alexandria!” The woman now pointed across the plaza to an illumi nated “Metro” sign nearby. “The Blue Line goes directly there. We want King Street Station!” Omar felt a surge of panic. Oh no. The man turned back to Omar and handed him entirely too many bills for the fare. “Thanks. We’re all se t.” He hoisted his leather bag and ran off. “Wait! I can drive you! I go there all the time!” But it was too late. The man and woman were already dashing across the plaza. They disappeared down th e stairs into the Metro Center subway station. Omar grabbed his cell phone. “Sir! They ran down in to the subway! I couldn’t stop them! They’re taking the Blue Line to Alexandria!” “Stay right there!” the agent shouted. “I’ll be the re in fifteen seconds!” Omar looked down at the wad of bills the man had gi ven him. The bill on top was apparently the one the y had been writing on. It had a Jewish star on top of the Great Seal of the United States. Sure enough, the star’ s points fell on letters that spelled MASON . Without warning, Omar felt a deafening vibration al l around him, as if a tractor trailer were about to collide with his cab. He looked up, but the street was dese rted. The noise increased, and suddenly a sleek bla ck helicopter dropped down out of the night and landed hard in the middle of the plaza map. A group of black-clad men jumped out. Most ran towa rd the subway station, but one came dashing toward Omar’s cab. He yanked open the passenger door. “Oma r? Is that you?” Omar nodded, speechless. "},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"“ Did they say where they were headed? ” the agent demanded. “Alexandria! King Street Station,” Omar blurted. “I offered to drive, but—” “Did they say where in Alexandria they were going?” “ No! They looked at the medallion of the Great Seal on the plaza, then they asked about Alexandria, and they paid me with this .” He handed the agent the dollar bill with the bizarr e diagram. As the agent studied the bill, Omar suddenly put it all together. The Masons! Alexandria! One of the most famous Masonic buildings in America was in Alexandria. “That’s it!” he blurted. “The George Washington Masonic Memorial! It’s directly across from King Street Station!” “That it is,” the agent said, apparently having jus t come to the same realization as the rest of the a gents came sprinting back from the station. “We missed them!” one of the men yelled. “Blue Line just left! They’re not down there!” Agent Simkins checked his watch and turned back to Omar. “How long does the subway take to Alexandria?” “Ten minutes at least. Probably more.” “Omar, you’ve done an excellent job. Thank you.” “Sure. What’s this all about?!” But Agent Simkins was already running back to the c hopper, shouting as he went. “King Street Station! We’ll get there before they do!” Bewildered, Omar watched the great black bird lift off. It banked hard to the south across Pennsylvani a Avenue, and then thundered off into the night. Underneath the cabbie’s feet, a subway train was pi cking up speed as it headed away from Freedom Plaza . On board, Robert Langdon and Katherine Solomon sat breathless, neither one saying a word as the train whisked them toward their destination. CHAPTER 77 The memory always began the same way. He was falling . . . plummeting backward toward an ice-covered river at the bottom of a deep ravine. A bove him, the merciless gray eyes of Peter Solomon stare d down over the barrel of Andros’s handgun. As he f ell, the world above him receded, everything disappearin g as he was enveloped by the cloud of billowing mis t from the waterfall upstream. For an instant, everything was white, like heaven. Then he hit the ice. Cold. Black. Pain.

His lungs ached for air, and yet his chest muscles had contracted so violently i n the cold that he was unable even to inhale. I ’m under the ice. The ice near the waterfall was apparently thin on a ccount of the turbulent water, and Andros had broke n directly through it. Now he was being washed downst ream, trapped beneath a transparent ceiling. He cla wed at the underside of the ice, trying to break out, b ut he had no leverage. The searing pain from the bu llet hole in his shoulder was evaporating, as was the sting o f the bird shot; both were blotted out now by the c rippling throb of his body going numb. The current was accelerating, slingshotting him aro und a bend in the river. His body screamed for oxyg en. Suddenly he was tangled in branches, lodged against a tree that had fallen into the water. Think! He groped wildly at the branch, working his way toward the su rface, finding the spot where the branch pierced up through the ice. His fingertips found the tiny spac e of open water surrounding the branch, and he pull ed at the edges, trying to break the hole wider; once, tw ice, the opening was growing, now several inches ac ross. Propping himself against the branch, he tipped his head back and pressed his mouth against the small opening. The winter air that poured into his lungs felt warm. The sudden burst of oxygen fueled his ho pe. He planted his feet on the tree trunk and pressed his back and shoulders forcefully upward. The ice aroun d the fallen tree, perforated by branches and debris, was weakened already, and as he drove his powerful leg s into the trunk, his head and shoulders broke through the ice, crashing up into the winter night. Air poured into his lungs. Still mostly submerged, he wriggled desperat ely upward, pushing with his legs, pulling with his arms, until finally he was out of the water, lying breath less on the bare ice. Andros tore off his soaked ski mask and pocketed it , glancing back upstream for Peter Solomon. The ben d in the river obscured his view. His chest was burning again. Quietly, he dragged a small branch over the hole in the ice in order to hide it. The hole would be froz en again by morning. As Andros staggered into the woods, it began to sno w. He had no idea how far he had run when he stumbl ed out of the woods onto an embankment beside a small highway. He was delirious and hypothermic. The snow was falling harder now, and a single set of headlig hts approached in the distance. Andros waved wildly , and the lone pickup truck immediately pulled over. It h ad Vermont plates. An old man in a red plaid shirt jumped out. Andros staggered toward him, holding his bleeding c hest. “A hunter . . . shot me! I need a . . . hospi tal!” Without hesitation, the old man helped Andros up in to the passenger seat of the truck and turned up th e heater. “Where’s the nearest hospital?!” Andros had no idea, but he pointed south. “Next exi t.” We’re not going to a hospital. The old man from Vermont was reported missing the n ext day, but nobody had any idea where on his journey from Vermont he might have disappeared in t he blinding snowstorm. Nor did anyone link his disappearance to the other news story that dominate d the headlines the next day—the shocking murder of Isabel Solomon. When Andros awoke, he was lying in a desolate bedro om of a cheap motel that had been boarded up for th e season. He recalled breaking in and binding his wou nds with torn bedsheets, and then burrowing into a flimsy bed beneath a pile of musty blankets. He was famished. He limped to the bathroom and saw the pile of blood y bird-shot pellets in the sink. He vaguely recalle d prying them out of his chest. Raising his eyes to t he dirty mirror, he reluctantly unwrapped his blood y bandages to survey the damage. The hard muscles of his chest and abdomen had stopped the bird shot fro m penetrating too deep, and yet his body, once perfec t, was now ruined with wounds. The single bullet fi red by Peter Solomon had apparently gone cleanly through h is shoulder, leaving a bloody crater. "},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Making matters worse, Andros had failed to obtain t hat for which he had traveled all this distance. The pyramid. His stomach growled, and he limped outside to the man’s truck, hoping maybe to find food. The pickup was now covered with heavy snow, and Andros wondered how long he had been sleeping in this old motel. Thank God I woke up. Andros found no food anywhere in the front seat, b ut he did find some arthritis painkillers in the glove compartment. He took a han dful, washing them down with several mouthfuls of snow. I need food. A few hours later, the pickup that pulled out from behind the old motel looked nothing like the truck that had pulled in two days earlier. The cab cap was missing , as were the hubcaps, bumper stickers, and all of the trim. The Vermont plates were gone, replaced by tho se from an old maintenance truck Andros had found parked by the motel Dumpster, into which he had thr own all the bloody sheets, bird shot, and other evi dence that he had ever been at the motel. Andros had not given up on the pyramid, but for the moment it would have to wait. He needed to hide, h eal, and above all, eat . He found a roadside diner where he gorged himself on eggs, bacon, hash browns, and three glasses of orange juice. When he was done, he ordered more food to go. Back on the road, Andros listened to the truck’s old radio. He had not seen a television or newspaper since his ordeal, and whe n he finally heard a local news station, the report stun ned him. “FBI investigators,” a news announcer said, “contin ue their search for the armed intruder who murdered Isabel Solomon in her Potomac home two days ago. Th e murderer is believed to have fallen through the i ce and been washed out to sea.” Andros froze. Murdered Isabel Solomon? He drove on in bewildered silence, listening to th e full report. It was time to get far, far away from this place. The Upper West Side apartment offered breathtaking views of Central Park. Andros had chosen it because the sea of green outside his window reminded him of his lost view of the Adriatic. Although he knew he should be happy to be alive, he was not. The emptin ess had never left him, and he found himself fixate d on his failed attempt to steal Peter Solomon’s pyramid . Andros had spent long hours researching the Legend of the Masonic Pyramid, and although nobody seemed to agree on whether or not the pyramid was real, th ey all concurred on its famous promise of vast wisd om and power. The Masonic Pyramid is real, Andros told himself. My inside information is irrefutable. Fate had placed the pyramid within Andros’s reach, and he knew that ignoring it was like holding a win ning lottery ticket and never cashing it in. I am the only non-Mason alive who knows the pyramid is real . . . as well as the identity of the man who guards it. Months had passed, and although his body had healed , Andros was no longer the cocky specimen he had been in Greece. He had stopped working out, and he had stopped admiring himself naked in the mirror. H e felt as if his body were beginning to show signs of age. His once-perfect skin was a patchwork of scar s, and this only depressed him further. He still relied on the painkillers that had nursed him through his re covery, and he felt himself slipping back to the lifestyle that had put him in Soganlik Prison. He didn’t care . The body craves what the body craves. One night, he was in Greenwich Village buying drugs from a man whose forearm had been tattooed with a long, jagged lightning bolt. Andros asked him about it, and the man told him the tattoo was covering a long scar he had gotten in a car accident. “Seeing the s car every day reminded me of the accident,” the dealer said, “and so I tattooed over it with a symbol of persona l power. I took back control.” That night, high on his new stash of drugs, Andros staggered into a local tattoo parlor and took off h is shirt. “I want to hide these scars,” he announced. I want to take back control. “ Hide them? ” The tattoo artist eyed his chest. “ With what ? ”"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" “Tattoos.” “Yes . . . I mean tattoos of what ?” Andros shrugged, wanting nothing more than to hide the ugly reminders of his past. “I don’t know. You choose.” The artist shook his head and handed Andros a pamph let on the ancient and sacred tradition of tattooin g. “Come back when you’re ready.” Andros discovered that the New York Public Library had in its collection fifty-three books on tattooin g, and within a few weeks, he had read them all. Having re discovered his passion for reading, he began carryi ng entire backpacks of books back and forth between th e library and his apartment, where he voraciously devoured them while overlooking Central Park. These books on tattoos had opened a door to a stran ge world Andros had never known existed—a world of symbols, mystici sm, mythology, and the magical arts. The more he read, the more he realized how blind he had been. H e began keeping notebooks of his ideas, his sketche s, and his strange dreams. When he could no longer find wh at he wanted at the library, he paid rare-book deal ers to purchase for him some of the most esoteric texts on earth. De Praestigiis Daemonum . . . Lemegeton . . . Ars A lmadel . . . Grimorium Verum . . . Ars Notoria . . . and on and on. He read them all, becoming more and more ce rtain that the world still had many treasures yet t o offer him. There are secrets out there that transcend human un derstanding. Then he discovered the writings of Aleister Crowley —a visionary mystic from the early 1900s—whom the church had deemed “the most evil man who ever lived .” Great minds are always feared by lesser minds. Andros learned about the power of ritual and incant ation. He learned that sacred words, if properly spoken, functioned like keys that opened gateways to other worlds. There is a shadow universe beyond this one . . . a world from which I can draw power. And although Andros longed to harness that power, he knew there were rules and tasks to be completed beforehand. Become something holy, Crowley wrote. Make yourself sacred. The ancient rite of “sacred making” had once been t he law of the land. From the early Hebrews who made burnt offerings at the Temple, to the Mayans who be headed humans atop the pyramids of Chichén Itzá, to Jesus Christ, who offered his body on the cross, th e ancients understood God’s requirement for sacrifice . Sacrifice was the original ritual by which humans d rew favor from the gods and made themselves holy. Sacra— sacred . Face — make . Even though the rite of sacrifice had been abandone d eons ago, its power remained. There had been a ha ndful of modern mystics, including Aleister Crowley, who practiced the Art, perfecting it over time, and transforming themselves gradually into something mo re. Andros craved to transform himself as they had. And yet he knew he would have to cross a dangerous bridge to do so. Blood is all that separates the light from the dark . One night, a crow flew through Andros’s open bathro om window and got trapped in his apartment. Andros watched the bird flutter around for a while and the n finally stop, apparently accepting its inability to escape. Andros had learned enough to recognize a sign. I am being urged onward. Clutching the bird in one hand, he stood at the mak eshift altar in his kitchen and raised a sharp knife, speaking aloud th e incantation he had memorized. "},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"“ Camiach, Eomiahe, Emial, Macbal, Emoii, Zazean . . . by the most holy names of the angels in the Book of Assamaian, I conjure thee that thou assist me in th is operation by the power of the One True God. ” Andros now lowered the knife and carefully pierced the large vein on the right wing of the panicked bi rd. The crow began to bleed. As he watched the stream o f red liquid flowing down into the metal cup he had placed as a receptacle, he felt an unexpected chill in the air. Nonetheless, he continued. “Almighty Adonai, Arathron, Ashai, Elohim, Elohi, E lion, Asher Eheieh, Shaddai . . . be my aid, so tha t this blood may have power and efficacy in all wherein I shall wish, and in all that I shall demand.” That night, he dreamed of birds . . . of a giant ph oenix rising from a billowing fire. The next mornin g, he awoke with an energy he had not felt since childhoo d. He went running in the park, faster and farther than he’d imagined possible. When he could run no longer , he stopped to do pushups and sit-ups. Countless repetitions. Still he had energy. That night, again, he dreamed of the phoenix. Autumn had fallen again on Central Park, and the wi ldlife were scurrying about searching for food for winter. Andros despised the cold, and yet his caref ully hidden traps were now overflowing with live ra ts and squirrels. He took them home in his backpack, perfo rming rituals of increasing complexity. Emanual, Massiach, Yod, He, Vaud . . . please find me worthy. The blood rituals fueled his vitality. Andros felt younger every day. He continued to read day and nig ht— ancient mystical texts, epic medieval poems, the ea rly philosophers—and the more he learned about the true nature of things, the more he realized that all hop e for mankind was lost. They are blind . . . wandering aimlessly in a world they will never understand. Andros was still a man, but he sensed he was evolvi ng into something else. Something greater. Something sacred . His massive physique had emerged from dormancy, m ore powerful now than ever before. He finally understood its true purpose. My body is but a vessel for my most potent treasure . . . my mind. Andros knew his true potential had not yet been rea lized, and he delved deeper. What is my destiny? All the ancient texts spoke of good and evil . . . and of man’s need to choose between them . I made my choice long ago, he knew, and yet he felt no remorse. What is evil, if not a natural law? Darkness followed light. Chaos followed order. Ent ropy was fundamental. Everything decayed. The perfectly orde red crystal eventually turned into random particles of dust. There are those who create . . . and those who dest roy. It was not until Andros read John Milton’s Paradise Lost that he saw his destiny materialize before him. He read of the great fallen angel . . . the warrior de mon who fought against the light . . . the valiant one . . . the angel called Moloch. Moloch walked the earth as a god . The angel’s name, Andros later learned, when tran slated to the ancient tongue, became Mal’akh. And so shall I. Like all great transformations, this one had to beg in with a sacrifice . . . but not of rats, nor bird s. No, this transformation required a true sacrifice. There is but one worthy sacrifice. Suddenly he had a sense of clarity unlike anything he had ever experienced in his life. His entire des tiny had materialized. For three straight days he sketched o n an enormous sheet of paper. When he was done, he had created a blueprint of what he would become."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" He hung the life-size sketch on his wall and gazed into it as if into a mirror. I am a masterpiece. The next day, he took his drawing to the tattoo par lor. He was ready. CHAPTER 78 The George Washington Masonic Memorial stands atop Shuter’ s Hill in Alexandria, Virginia. Built in three distinct tiers of increasing architectural complexi ty from bottom to top—Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian— the structure stands as a physical symbol of man’s inte llectual ascent. Inspired by the ancient Pharos lig hthouse of Alexandria, Egypt, this soaring tower is capped by an Egyptian pyramid with a flamelike finial. Inside the spectacular marble foyer sits a massive bronze of George Washington in full Masonic regalia , along with the actual trowel he used to lay the cor nerstone of the Capitol Building. Above the foyer, nine different levels bear names like the Grotto, the Cr ypt Room, and the Knights Templar Chapel. Among the treasures housed within these spaces are over twent y thousand volumes of Masonic writings, a dazzling replica of the Ark of the Covenant, and even a scal e model of the throne room in King Solomon’s Temple . CIA agent Simkins checked his watch as the modified UH-60 chopper skimmed in low over the Potomac. Six minutes until their train arrives. He exhaled and gazed out the window at the shining Masonic Memorial on the horizon. He had to admit, the brilliantly shini ng tower was as impressive as any building on the N ational Mall. Simkins had never been inside the memorial, a nd tonight would be no different. If all went accor ding to plan, Robert Langdon and Katherine Solomon would never make it out of the subway station. “Over there!” Simkins shouted to the pilot, pointin g down at the King Street subway station across fro m the memorial. The pilot banked the helicopter and set i t down on a grassy area at the foot of Shuter’s Hil l. Pedestrians looked up in surprise as Simkins and hi s team piled out, dashed across the street, and ran down into King Street Station. In the stairwell, several departing passengers leaped out of the way, plaste ring themselves to the walls as the phalanx of armed men in black thundered past them. The King Street Station was larger than Simkins had anticipated, apparently serving several different lines— Blue, Yellow, and Amtrak. He raced over to the Metr o map on the wall, found Freedom Plaza and the dire ct line to this location. “Blue Line, southbound platform!” Simkins shouted. “Get down there and clear everyone out!” His team dashed off. Simkins rushed over to the ticket booth, flashed hi s identification, and shouted to the woman inside. “The next train from Metro Center—what time is it due?!” The woman inside looked frightened. “I’m not sure. Blue Line arrives every eleven minutes. There’s no set schedule.” “How long since the last train?” “ Five . . . six minutes, maybe? No more than that. ”"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" Turner did the math. Perfect . The next train had to be Langdon’s. Inside a fast-moving subway car, Katherine Solomon shifted uncomfortably on the hard plastic seat. The bright fluorescent lights overhead hurt her eyes, a nd she fought the impulse to let her eyelids close, even for a second. Langdon sat beside her in the empty car, st aring blankly down at the leather bag at his feet. His eyelids looked heavy, too, as if the rhythmic sway of the moving car were lulling him into a trance. Katherine pictured the strange contents of Langdon’ s bag. Why does the CIA want this pyramid? Bellamy had said that Sato might be pursuing the pyramid be cause she knew its true potential. But even if this pyramid somehow did reveal the hiding place of ancient secrets, Kather ine found it hard to believe that its promise of primeval mystical wisdom would interest the CIA. Then again, she reminded herself, the CIA had been caught several times running parapsychological or p si programs that bordered on ancient magic and mystici sm. In 1995, the “Stargate/Scannate” scandal had exposed a classified CIA technology called remote v iewing—a kind of telepathic mind travel that enable d a “viewer” to transport his mind’s eye to any locatio n on earth and spy there, without being physically present. Of course, the technology was nothing new. Mystics called it astral projection, and yogis called it ou t-of- body experience. Unfortunately, horrified American taxpayers called it absurd, and the program had been scuttled. At least publicly. Ironically, Katherine saw remarkable connections be tween the CIA’s failed programs and her own breakthroughs in Noetic Science. Katherine felt eager to call the police and find ou t if they had discovered anything in Kalorama Heigh ts, but she and Langdon were phoneless now, and making cont act with the authorities would probably be a mistak e anyway; there was no telling how far Sato’s reach e xtended. Patience, Katherine. Within minutes, they would be in a safe hiding pla ce, guests of a man who had assured them he could provide answers. Katherine hoped his answers, whatever they might be, would help her sav e her brother. “Robert?” she whispered, glancing up at the subway map. “Next stop is ours.” Langdon emerged slowly from his daydream. “Right, t hanks.” As the train rumbled toward the station, he collected his daybag and gave Katherine an uncertai n glance. “Let’s just hope our arrival is uneventfu l.” By the time Turner Simkins dashed down to join his men, the subway platform had been entirely cleared, and his team was fanning out, taking up positions behin d the support pillars that ran the length of the pl atform. A distant rumble echoed in the tunnel at the other en d of the platform, and as it grew louder, Simkins f elt the push of stale warm air billowing around him. No escape, Mr. Langdon. Simkins turned to the two agents he had told to joi n him on the platform. “Identification and weapons out. These trains are automated, but they all have a con ductor who opens the doors. Find him.” The train’s headlamp now appeared down the tunnel, and the sound of squealing brakes pierced the air. As the train burst into the station and began slowing down, Simkins and his two agents leaned out over th e track, waving CIA identification badges and straining to m ake eye contact with the conductor before he could open the doors. The train was closing fast. In the third car, Simki ns finally saw the startled face of the conductor, who was apparently trying to figure out why three men in bl ack were all waving identification badges at him. S imkins jogged toward the train, which was now nearing a fu ll stop. “CIA!” Simkins shouted, holding up his ID. “Do NOT open the doors!” As the train glided slowly past hi m, he went toward the conductor ’ s car, shouting in at him. “ Do not open your doors! Do you understand?! Do"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"NOT open your doors! ” The train came to a full stop, its wide-eyed conduc tor nodding repeatedly. “What’s wrong?!” the man demanded through his side window. “Don’t let this train move,” Simkins said. “And don ’t open the doors.” “Okay.” “Can you let us into the first car?” The conductor nodded. Looking fearful, he stepped o ut of the train, closing the door behind him. He es corted Simkins and his men to the first car, where he manu ally opened the door. “Lock it behind us,” Simkins said, pulling his weap on. Simkins and his men stepped quickly into the st ark light of the first car. The conductor locked the do or behind them. The first car contained only four passengers—three teenage boys and an old woman—all of whom looked understandably startled to see three armed men ente ring. Simkins held up his ID. “Everything’s fine. J ust stay seated.” Simkins and his men now began their sweep, pushing toward the back of the sealed train one car at a ti me— “squeezing toothpaste,” as it was called during his training at the Farm. Very few passengers were on this train, and halfway to the back, the agents still ha d seen nobody even remotely resembling the descript ion of Robert Langdon and Katherine Solomon. Nonetheless, Simkins remained confident. There was absolutely no place to hide on a subway car. No bathrooms, no sto rage, and no alternative exits. Even if the targets had seen them board the train and fled to the back, the re was no way out. Prying open a door was almost impossible, and Simkins had men watching the platfo rm and both sides of the train anyway. Patience. By the time Simkins reached the second-to-last car, however, he was feeling edgy. This penultimate car had only one passenger—a Chinese man. Simkins and his a gents moved through, scanning for any place to hide . There was none. “Last car,” Simkins said, raising his weapon as the threesome moved toward the threshold of the train’s final section. As they stepped into the last car, all thr ee of them immediately stopped and stared. What the . . . ?! Simkins raced to the rear of the deserted cabin, s earching behind all the seats. He spun back to his men, blood boiling. “Where the hell did they go?!” CHAPTER 79 Eight miles due north of Alexandria, Virginia, Robert Langdon and Katherine Solomon strode calmly across a wide expanse of frost-covered lawn. “You should be an actress,” Langdon said, still imp ressed by Katherine’s quick thinking and improvisat ional skills. “You weren’t half bad yourself.” She gave him a smi le. "},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"At first, Langdon had been mystified by Katherine ’ s abrupt antics in the taxi. Without warning, she h ad suddenly demanded they go to Freedom Plaza based on some revelation about a Jewish star and the Great Seal of the United States. She drew a well-known co nspiracy-theory image on a dollar bill and then ins isted Langdon look closely where she was pointing . Finally, Langdon realized that Katherine was pointi ng not at the dollar bill but at a tiny indicator bulb on the back of the driver’s seat. The bulb was so covered with grime that he had not even noticed it. As he l eaned forward, however, he could see that the bulb was il luminated, emitting a dull red glow. He could also see the two faint words directly beneath the lit bulb. — INTERCOM ON — Startled, Langdon glanced back at Katherine, whose frantic eyes were urging him to look into the front seat. He obeyed, stealing a discreet glance through the d ivider. The cabby’s cell phone was on the dash, wid e open, illuminated, facing the intercom speaker. An instant later, Langdon understood Katherine’s actio ns. They know we’re in this cab . . . they’ve been list ening to us. Langdon had no idea how much time he and Katherine had until their taxi was stopped and surrounded, bu t he knew they had to act fast. Instantly, he’d begun playing along, realizing that Katherine’s desire t o go to Freedom Plaza had nothing to do with the pyramid bu t rather with its being a large subway station—Metr o Center—from which they could take the Red, Blue, or Orange lines in any of six different directions. They jumped out of the taxi at Freedom Plaza, and L angdon took over, doing some improvising of his own , leaving a trail to the Masonic Memorial in Alexandr ia before he and Katherine ran down into the subway station, dashing past the Blue Line platforms and c ontinuing on to the Red Line, where they caught a t rain in the opposite direction. Traveling six stops northbound to Tenleytown, they emerged all alone into a quiet, upscale neighborhoo d. Their destination, the tallest structure for miles, was immediately visible on the horizon, just off Massachusetts Avenue on a vast expanse of manicured lawn. Now “off the grid,” as Katherine called it, the two of them walked across the damp grass. On their right w as a medieval-style garden, famous for its ancient ros ebushes and Shadow House gazebo. They moved past th e garden, directly toward the magnificent building to which they had been summoned. A refuge containing ten stones from Mount Sinai, one from heaven itself, an d one with the visage of Luke’s dark father . “I’ve never been here at night,” Katherine said, ga zing up at the brightly lit towers. “It’s spectacul ar.” Langdon agreed, having forgotten how impressive thi s place truly was. This neo-Gothic masterpiece stoo d at the north end of Embassy Row. He hadn’t been here f or years, not since writing a piece about it for a kids’ magazine in hopes of generating some excitement amo ng young Americans to come see this amazing landmark. His article—“Moses, Moon Rocks, and Star Wars ”—had been part of the tourist literature for years. Washington National Cathedral, Langdon thought, feeling an unexpected anticipatio n at being back after all these years. Where better to ask about One True God? “This cathedral really has ten stones from Mount Sinai?” Katherine asked, gazing up at the twin bell towers. Langdon nodded. “Near the main altar. They symboliz e the Ten Commandments given to Moses on Mount Sinai.” “And there’s a lunar rock?” A rock from heaven itself. “Yes. One of the stained-glass windows is called t he Space Window and has a fragment of moon rock embedded in it.” "},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"“ Okay, but you can ’ t be serious about the last thing. ” Katherine glanced over, her pretty eyes flashing skepticism. “A statue of . . . Darth Vader?” Langdon chuckled. “Luke Skywalker’s dark father? Ab solutely. Vader is one of the National Cathedral’s most popular grotesques.” He pointed high into the west towers. “Tough to see him at night, but he’s t here.” “What in the world is Darth Vader doing on Washingt on National Cathedral?” “A contest for kids to carve a gargoyle that depict ed the face of evil. Darth won.” They reached the grand staircase to the main entran ce, which was set back in an eighty- foot archway beneath a breathtaking rose window. As they began climbing, Langdon’ s mind shifted to the mysterious stranger who had called him. No names, please . . . Tell me, have you successful ly protected the map that was entrusted to you? Langdon’s shoulder ached from carrying the heavy s tone pyramid, and he was looking forward to setting it down. Sanctuary and answers. As they approached the top of the stairs, they were met with an imposing pair of wooden doors. “Do we just knock?” Katherine asked. Langdon had been wondering the same thing, except t hat now one of the doors was creaking open. “Who’s there?” a frail voice said. The face of a wi thered old man appeared in the doorway. He wore pri est’s robes and a blank stare. His eyes were opaque and w hite, clouded with cataracts. “My name is Robert Langdon,” he replied. “Katherine Solomon and I are seeking sanctuary.” The blind man exhaled in relief. “Thank God. I’ve b een expecting you.” CHAPTER 80 Warren Bellamy felt a sudden ray of hope. Inside the Jungle, Director Sato had just received a phone call from a field agent and had immediately flown into a tirade. “Well, you damn well better find them!” she shouted into her phone. “We’re run ning out of time!” She had hung up and was now stalking back an d forth in front of Bellamy as if trying to decide what to do next. Finally, she stopped directly in front of him and t urned. “Mr. Bellamy, I’m going to ask you this once , and only once.” She stared deep into his eyes. “Yes or no—do you have any idea where Robert Langdon might have gone?” Bellamy had more than a good idea, but he shook his head. “No.” Sato’s piercing gaze had never left his eyes. “Unfo rtunately, part of my job is to know when people ar e lying.” Bellamy averted his eyes. “Sorry, I can’t help you. ” “Architect Bellamy,” Sato said, “ tonight just after seven P.M., you were having dinn er in a restaurant outside the city when you received a phone call from a man who told you he had kidnapped Peter Solomon.” "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Bellamy felt an instant chill and returned his eyes to hers. How could you possibly know that?! “The man,” Sato continued, “told you that he had se nt Robert Langdon to the Capitol Building and given Langdon a task to complete . . . a task that requir ed your help. He warned that if Langdon failed in this tas k, your friend Peter Solomon would die. Panicked, you called all of Peter’s numbers but failed to reach h im. Understandably, you then raced to the Capitol.” Bellamy could not imagine how Sato knew about this phone call. “As you fled the Capitol,” Sato said behind the smo ldering tip of her cigarette, “you sent a text mess age to Solomon’s kidnapper, assuring him that you and Lang don had been successful in obtaining the Masonic Pyramid.” Where is she getting her information? Bellamy wondered . Not even Langdon knows I sent that text message. Immediately after entering the tunnel to the Library of Congress, Bellamy had stepped int o the electrical room to plug in the construction l ighting. In the privacy of that moment, he had decided to se nd a quick text message to Solomon’s captor, tellin g him about Sato’s involvement, but reassuring him that h e—Bellamy—and Langdon had obtained the Masonic Pyramid and would indeed cooperate with his demands . It was a lie, of course, but Bellamy hoped the reassurance might buy time, both for Peter Solomon and also to hide the pyramid. “Who told you I sent a text?” Bellamy demanded. Sato tossed Bellamy’s cell phone on the bench next to him. “Hardly rocket science.” Bellamy now remembered his phone and keys had been taken from him by the agents who captured him. “As for the rest of my inside information,” Sato sa id, “ the Patriot Act gives me the right to place a wiret ap on the phone of anyone I consider a viable threat to n ational security. I consider Peter Solomon to be su ch a threat, and last night I took action.” Bellamy could barely get his mind around what she w as telling him. “You’re tapping Peter Solomon’s phone?” “Yes. This is how I knew the kidnapper called you a t the restaurant. You called Peter’ s cell phone and left an anxious message explaining what had just happened.” Bellamy realized she was right. “We had also intercepted a call from Robert Langdon , who was in the Capitol Building, deeply confused to learn he had been tricked into coming there. I went to the Capitol at once, arriving before you becaus e I was closer. As for how I knew to check the X-ray of Lan gdon’s bag . . . in light of my realization that La ngdon was involved in all of this, I had my staff reexami ne a seemingly innocuous early-morning call between Langdon and Peter Solomon’s cell phone, in which th e kidnapper, posing as Solomon’s assistant, persuad ed Langdon to come for a lecture and also to bring a s mall package that Peter had entrusted to him. When Langdon was not forthcoming with me about the packa ge he was carrying, I requested the X-ray of his ba g.” Bellamy could barely think. Admittedly, everything Sato was saying was feasible, and yet something was not adding up. “But . . . how could you possibly think Peter Solomon is a threat to national security?” “Believe me, Peter Solomon is a serious national-security threat,” she snapped. “And frankly, Mr. Bellamy, so are you .” Bellamy sat bolt upright, the handcuffs chafing aga inst his wrists. “I beg your pardon?!” She forced a smile. “You Masons play a risky game. You keep a very, very dangerous secret.” Is she talking about the Ancient Mysteries?"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" “Thankfully, you’ve always done a good job of keepi ng your secrets hidden. Unfortunately, recently you ’ve been careless, and tonight, your most dangerous sec ret is about to be unveiled to the world. And unles s we can stop that from happening, I assure you the resu lts will be catastrophic.” Bellamy stared in bewilderment. “If you had not attacked me,” Sato said, “you would have realized that you and I are on the same team.” The same team. The words sparked in Bellamy an idea that seemed a lmost impossible to fathom. Is Sato a member of Eastern Star? The Order of the Eastern Star—often considered a s ister organization to the Masons—embraced a similar mystical philosophy of be nevolence, secret wisdom, and spiritual open- mindedness. The same team? I’m in handcuffs! She’s tapping Pete r’s phone! “You will help me stop this man,” Sato said. “ He has the potential to bring about a cataclysm fro m which this country might not recover.” Her face was like stone . “Then why aren’t you tracking him?” Sato looked incredulous. “Do you think I’m not trying ? My trace on Solomon’s cell phone went dead before we got a location. His other number appears to be a disposable phone—which is almost impossible to tra ck. The private-jet company told us that Langdon’s flig ht was booked by Solomon’s assistant, on Solomon’ s cell phone, with Solomon’s Marquis Jet card. There is no trail. Not that it matters anyway. Even if we find out exactly where he is, I can’t possibly risk moving i n and trying to grab him.” “Why not?!” “I’d prefer not to share that, as the information i s classified,” Sato said, patience clearly waning. “ I am asking you to trust me on this.” “Well, I don’t!” Sato’s eyes were like ice. She turned suddenly and shouted across the Jungle. “Agent Hartmann! The briefcase, please.” Bellamy heard the hiss of the electronic door, and an agent strode into the Jungle. He was carrying a sleek titanium briefcase, which he set on the ground besi de the OS director. “Leave us,” Sato said. As the agent departed, the door hissed again, and t hen everything fell silent. Sato picked up the metal case, laid it across her l ap, and popped the clasps. Then she raised her eyes slowly to Bellamy. “I did not want to do this, but our tim e is running out, and you’ve left me no choice.” Bellamy eyed the strange briefcase and felt a swell of fear. Is she going to torture me? He strained at his cuffs again. “What’s in that case?!” Sato smiled grimly. “Something that will persuade y ou to see things my way. I guarantee it.” CHAPTER 81 "},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" The subterranean space in which Mal’akh performed the Art was ingen iously hidden. His home’s basement, to those who entered, appeared quite norm al—a typical cellar with boiler, fuse box, woodpile , and a hodgepodge of storage. This visible cellar, howev er, was only a portion of Mal’akh’ s underground space. A sizable area had been walled off for his clandestin e practices. Mal’akh’s private work space was a suite of small r ooms, each with a specialized purpose. The area’s s ole entrance was a steep ramp secretly accessible throu gh his living room, making the area’s discovery vir tually impossible. Tonight, as Mal’akh descended the ramp, the tattooe d sigils and signs on his flesh seemed to come aliv e in the cerulean glow of his basement’ s specialized lighting. Moving into the bluish haze , he walked past several closed doors and headed directly for the largest ro om at the end of the corridor. The “sanctum sanctorum,” as Mal’akh liked to call i t, was a perfect twelve-foot square. Twelve are the signs of the zodiac. Twelve are the hours of the day. Twe lve are the gates of heaven. In the center of the chamber was a stone table, a seven-by-seven square. Seven are the seals of Revelation. Seven are the st eps of the Temple. Centered over the table hung a carefully calibrate d light source that cycled through a spectrum of preordained colors, completing its cycle every six hours in accordance with the sacred Table of Planet ary Hours. The hour of Yanor is blue. The hour of Nasnia is re d. The hour of Salam is white. Now was the hour of Caerra, meaning the light in th e room had modulated to a soft purplish hue. Wearin g only a silken loincloth wrapped around his buttocks and neutered sex organ, Mal’akh began his preparat ions. He carefully combined the suffumigation chemicals t hat he would later ignite to sanctify the air. Then he folded the virgin silk robe that he would eventuall y don in place of his loincloth. And finally, he pu rified a flask of water for the anointing of his offering. When he wa s done, he placed all of these prepared ingredients on a side table. Next he went to a shelf and retrieved a small ivory box, which he carried to the side table and placed with the other items. Although he was not yet ready to use i t, he could not resist opening the lid and admiring this treasure. The knife. Inside the ivory box, nestled in a cradle of black velvet, shone the sacrificial knife that Mal’akh ha d been saving for tonight. He had purchased it for $1.6 mi llion on the Middle Eastern antiquities black marke t last year. The most famous knife in history. Unimaginably old and believed lost, this precious b lade was made of iron, attached to a bone handle. O ver the ages, it had been in the possession of countles s powerful individuals. In recent decades, however, it had disappeared, languishing in a secret private collec tion. Mal’akh had gone to enormous lengths to obtai n it. The knife, he suspected, had not drawn blood for de cades . . . possibly centuries. Tonight, this blade would again taste the power of the sacrifice for which it was honed. Mal’akh gently lifted the knife from its cushioned compartment and reverently polished the blade with a silk cloth soaked in purified water. His skills had prog ressed greatly since his first rudimentary experime nts in New York. The dark Art that Mal ’akh practiced had been known by many names in many languages, but by any name, it was a precise science. This primeval t echnology had once held the key to the portals of p ower, but it had been banished long ago, relegated to the shadows of occultism and magic. Those few who stil l practiced this Art were considered madmen, but Mal’ akh knew better. This is not work for those with dull faculties. The ancient dark Art, like modern science, was a d iscipline involving precise formulas, specific ingredients, and meticulous timing. This Art was not the impotent black magic of today, often practiced halfheartedly by curious souls. Th is Art, like nuclear physics, had the potential to unleash enormous power. The warnings were dire: The unskilled"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"practitioner runs the risk of being struck by a ref lux current and destroyed. Mal’akh finished admiring the sacred blade and turn ed his attention to a lone sheet of thick vellum ly ing on the table before him. He had made this vellum himse lf from the skin of a baby lamb. As was the protoco l, the lamb was pure, having not yet reached sexual maturi ty. Beside the vellum was a quill pen he had made f rom the feather of a crow, a silver saucer, and three g limmering candles arranged around a solid-brass bow l. The bowl contained one inch of thick crimson liquid. The liquid was Peter Solomon’s blood. Blood is the tincture of eternity. Mal’akh picked up the quill pen, placed his left ha nd on the vellum, and dipping the quill tip in the blood, he carefully traced the outline of his open palm. When he was done, he added the five symbols of the Anci ent Mysteries, one on each fingertip of the drawing. The crown . . . to represent the king I shall becom e. The star . . . to represent the heavens which have ordained my destiny. The sun . . . to represent the illumination of my s oul. The lantern . . . to represent the feeble light of human understanding. And the key . . . to represent the missing piece, t hat which tonight I shall at last possess. Mal’akh completed his blood tracing and held up the vellum, admiring his work in the light of the thre e candles. He waited until the blood was dry and then folded the thick vellum three times. While chantin g an ethereal ancient incantation, Mal’akh touched the v ellum to the third candle, and it burst into flames . He set the flaming vellum on the silver saucer and let it burn. As it did, the carbon in the animal skin diss olved to a powdery black char. When the flame went out, Mal’ak h carefully tapped the ashes into the brass bowl of blood. Then he stirred the mixture with the crow’s feather. The liquid turned a deeper crimson, nearly black. Holding the bowl in both palms, Mal’akh raised it o ver his head and gave thanks, intoning the blood eukharistos of the ancients. Then he carefully poured the blac kened mixture into a glass vial and corked it. This would be the ink with which Mal’akh would insc ribe the untattooed flesh atop his head and complet e his masterpiece. CHAPTER 82 Washington National Cathedral is the sixth-largest cathedral in the wo rld and soars higher than a thirty- story skyscraper. Embellished with over two hundred stained-glass windows, a fifty-three- bell carillon, and a 10,647-pipe organ, this Gothic masterpiece can acco mmodate more than three thousand worshippers. Tonight, however, the great cathedral was deserted. Reverend Colin Galloway—dean of the cathedral—looke d like he had been alive forever. Stooped and withered, he wore a simple black cassock and shuffl ed blindly ahead without a word. Langdon and Kather ine followed in silence through the darkness of the fou r - hundred - foot - long nave ’ s central aisle, which was"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"curved ever so slightly to the left to create a sof tening optical illusion. When they reached the Grea t Crossing, the dean guided them through the rood scr een—the symbolic divider between the public area an d the sanctuary beyond. The scent of frankincense hung in the air of the ch ancel. This sacred space was dark, illuminated only by indirect reflections in the foliated vaults overhea d. Flags of the fifty states hung above the quire, which was ornately appointed with several carved reredos depi cting biblical events. Dean Galloway continued on, apparently knowing this walk by heart. For a moment , Langdon thought they were headed straight for the high altar, where the ten stones from Mount Sinai w ere embedded, but the old dean finally turned left and groped his way through a discreetly hidden door tha t led into an administrative annex. They moved down a short hallway to an office door b earing a brass nameplate: THE REVEREND DR. COLIN GALLOWAY CATHEDRAL DEAN Galloway opened the door and turned on the lights, apparently accustomed to remembering this courtesy for his guests. He ushered them in and closed the door. The dean’s office was small but elegant, with high bookshelves, a desk, a carved armoire, and a privat e bathroom. On the walls hung sixteenth-century tapes tries and several religious paintings. The old dean motioned to the two leather chairs directly opposit e his desk. Langdon sat with Katherine and felt gra teful finally to set his heavy shoulder bag on the floor at his feet. Sanctuary and answers, Langdon thought, settling into the comfortable cha ir. The aged man shuffled around behind his desk and ea sed himself down into his high-backed chair. Then, with a weary sigh, he raised his head, staring blan kly out at them through clouded eyes. When he spoke , his voice was unexpectedly clear and strong. “I realize we have never met,” the old man said, “an d yet I feel I know you both.” He took out a handkerchief and dabbed his mouth. “Professor Langdon, I am fami liar with your writings, including the clever piece you did on the symbolism of this cathedral. And, Ms. So lomon, your brother, Peter, and I have been Masonic brothers for many years now.” “Peter is in terrible trouble,” Katherine said. “So I have been told.” The old man sighed. “And I w ill do everything in my power to help you.” Langdon saw no Masonic ring on the dean’s finger, a nd yet he knew many Masons, especially those within the clergy, chose not to advertise their affiliatio n. As they began to talk, it became clear that Dean Ga lloway already knew some of the night’s events from Warren Bellamy’ s phone message. As Langdon and Katherine filled hi m in on the rest, the dean looked more and more troubled. “And this man who has taken our beloved Peter,” the dean said, “he is insisting you decipher the pyram id in exchange for Peter’s life?” “Yes,” Langdon said. “He thinks it’s a map that wil l lead him to the hiding place of the Ancient Myste ries.” The dean turned his eerie, opaque eyes toward Langd on. “My ears tell me you do not believe in such thi ngs.” Langdon did not want to waste time going down this road. “It doesn’t matter what I believe. We need to help Peter. Unfortunately, when we deciphered the pyrami d, it pointed nowhere.” The old man sat straighter. “ You ’ ve deciphered the pyramid? ”"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" Katherine interceded now, quickly explaining that d espite Bellamy’s warnings and her brother’s request that Langdon not unwrap the package, she had done so, fe eling her first priority was to help her brother ho wever she could. She told the dean about the golden capst one, Albrecht Dürer’ s magic square, and how it decrypted the sixteen-letter Masonic cipher into the phrase Jeova Sanctus Unus. “That’s all it says?” the dean asked. “One True God ?” “Yes, sir,” Langdon replied. “Apparently the pyrami d is more of a metaphorical map than a geographic one.” The dean held out his hands. “Let me feel it.” Langdon unzipped his bag and pulled out the pyramid , which he carefully hoisted up on the desk, settin g it directly in front of the reverend. Langdon and Katherine watched as the old man’s frai l hands examined every inch of the stone—the engraved side, the smooth base, and the truncated t op. When he was finished, he held out his hands aga in. “And the capstone?” Langdon retrieved the small stone box, set it on th e desk, and opened the lid. Then he removed the cap stone and placed it into the old man’s waiting hands. The dean performed a similar examination, feeling ever y inch, pausing on the capstone’s engraving, apparent ly having some trouble reading the small, elegantly inscribed text. “‘The secret hides within The Order,’” Langdon offe red. “And the words the and order are capitalized.” The old man’s face was expressionless as he positio ned the capstone on top of the pyramid and aligned it by sense of touch. He seemed to pause a moment, as if in prayer, and reverently ran his palms over the co mplete pyramid several times. Then he reached out and loca ted the cube- shaped box, taking it in his hands, feeling it carefully, his fingers probing inside and out. When he was done, he set down the box and leaned ba ck in his chair. “So tell me,” he demanded, his voi ce suddenly stern. “Why have you come to me?” The question took Langdon off guard. “We came, sir, because you told us to. And Mr. Bellamy said we should trust you.” “And yet you did not trust him ?” “I’m sorry?” The dean’s white eyes stared directly through Langd on. “The package containing the capstone was sealed . Mr. Bellamy told you not to open it, and yet you did. In addition, Peter Solomon himself told you not to open it. And yet you did.” “Sir,” Katherine intervened, “we were trying to hel p my brother. The man who has him demanded we decipher—” “I can appreciate that,” the dean declared, “and ye t what have you achieved by opening the package? Nothing. Peter ’s captor is looking for a location, and he will not be satisfied with the answer of Jeova Sanctus Unus. ” “I agree,” Langdon said, “but unfortunately that’s all the pyramid says. As I mentioned, the map seems to be more figurative than—” “You’re mistaken, Professor,” the dean said. “The M asonic Pyramid is a real map. It points to a real location. You do not understand that, because you h ave not yet deciphered the pyramid fully. Not even close. ”"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":" Langdon and Katherine exchanged startled looks. The dean laid his hands back on the pyramid, almost caressing it. “This map, like the Ancient Mysterie s themselves, has many layers of meaning. Its true se cret remains veiled from you.” “Dean Galloway,” Langdon said, “we’ve been over eve ry inch of the pyramid and capstone, and there’s nothing else to see.” “Not in its current state, no. But objects change.” “Sir?” “Professor, as you know, the promise of this pyrami d is one of miraculous transformative power. Legend holds that this pyramid can change its shape . . . alter its physical form to reveal its secrets. Like the famed stone that released Excalibur into the hands of Kin g Arthur, the Masonic Pyramid can transform itself if it so chooses . . . and reveal its secret to the worthy.” Langdon now sensed that the old man’s advanced year s had perhaps robbed him of his faculties. “I’m sor ry, sir. Are you saying this pyramid can undergo a literal physical transformation?” “ Professor, if I were to reach out with my hand and transform this pyramid right before your eyes, woul d you believe what you had witnessed?” Langdon had no idea how to respond. “I suppose I wo uld have no choice.” “Very well, then. In a moment, I shall do exactly t hat.” He dabbed his mouth again. “Let me remind you that there was an era when even the brightest minds perc eived the earth as flat. For if the earth were roun d, then surely the oceans would spill off. Imagine how they would have mocked you if you proclaimed, ‘Not only is the world a sphere, but there is an invisible, myst ical force that holds everything to its surface’!” “There’s a difference,” Langdon said, “between the existence of gravity . . . and the ability to trans form objects with a touch of your hand.” “Is there? Is it not possible that we are still liv ing in the Dark Ages, still mocking the suggestion of ‘mystical’ forces that we cannot see or comprehend. History, i f it has taught us anything at all, has taught us t hat the strange ideas we deride today will one day be our c elebrated truths. I claim I can transform this pyra mid with a touch of my finger, and you question my sanity. I would expect more from an historian. History is re plete with great minds who have all proclaimed the same thing . . . great minds who have all insisted that man possesses mystical abilities of which he is unaware .” Langdon knew the dean was correct. The famous Herme tic aphorism— Know ye not that ye are gods?— was one of the pillars of the Ancient Mysteries. As above, so below . . . Man created in God’s image . . . Apotheosis. This persistent message of man’s own divinity—of h is hidden potential—was the recurring theme in the ancient texts of countless traditions. Even the Holy Bible cried out in Psalms 82:6: Ye are gods! “Professor,” the old man said, “I realize that you, like many educated people, live trapped between wo rlds— one foot in the spiritual, one foot in the physical . Your heart yearns to believe . . . but your intel lect refuses to permit it. As an academic, you would be wise to lea rn from the great minds of history.” He paused and cleared his throat. “If I’m remembering correctly, one of the greatest minds ever to live proclaimed: ‘That which is impenetrable to us really exists. Behind t he secrets of nature remains something subtle, inta ngible, and inexplicable. Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion.’ ” “Who said that?” Langdon said. “Gandhi?” “No,” Katherine interjected. “Albert Einstein.” Katherine Solomon had read every word Einstein had ever written and was struck by his profound respect for"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"the mystical, as well as his predictions that the m asses would one day feel the same. The religion of the future, Einstein had predicted, will be a cosmic religion. It will transcend person al God and avoid dogma and theology. Robert Langdon appeared to be struggling with the i dea. Katherine could sense his rising frustration w ith the old Episcopal priest, and she understood. After all , they had traveled here for answers, and they had found instead a blind man who claimed he could transform objects with a touch of his hands. Even so, the old man’s overt passion for mystical forces reminded Ka therine of her brother. “Father Galloway,” Katherine said, “Peter is in tro uble. The CIA is chasing us. And Warren Bellamy sen t us to you for help. I don’t know what this pyramid say s or where it points, but if deciphering it means t hat we can help Peter, we need to do that. Mr. Bellamy may have preferred to sacrifice my brother’s life to h ide this pyramid, but my family has experienced nothing but pain because of it. Whatever secret it may hold, it ends tonight.” “You are correct,” the old man replied, his tone di re. “It will all end tonight. You’ve guaranteed that.” He sighed. “Ms. Solomon, when you broke the seal on th at box, you set in motion a series of events from w hich there will be no return. There are forces at work t onight that you do not yet comprehend. There is no turning back.” Katherine stared dumbfounded at the reverend. There was something apocalyptic about his tone, as if he were referring to the Seven Seals of Revelation or Pandora’s box. “Respectfully, sir,” Langdon interceded, “I can’t im agine how a stone pyramid could set in motion anything at all.” “Of course you can’t, Professor.” The old man stare d blindly through him. “You do not yet have eyes to see.” CHAPTER 83 In the moist air of the Jungle, the Architect of the Capi tol could feel the sweat now rolling down his back. His handcuffed wrists ached, but all of his attenti on remained riveted on the ominous titanium briefca se that Sato had just opened on the bench between them. The contents of this case, Sato had told him, will persuade you to see things my way. I guarantee it. The tiny Asian woman had unclasped the metal case away from Bellamy’ s line of sight, and he had yet to see its contents, but his imagination was running wild. Sato’s hands were doing something inside the case, and Bellamy half expected her to extract a series of gl istening, razor-sharp tools. Suddenly a light source flickered inside the case, growing brighter, illuminating Sato’s face from ben eath. Her hands kept moving inside, and the light changed hue. After a few moments, she removed her hands, grasped the entire case, and turned it toward Bella my so he could see inside. Bellamy found himself squinting into the glow of wh at appeared to be some kind of futuristic laptop wi th a handheld phone receiver, two antennae, and a double keyboard. His initial surge of relief turned quick ly to confusion. The screen bore the CIA logo and the text: SECURE LOG - IN"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" USER: INOUE SATO SECURITY CLEARANCE: LEVEL 5 Beneath the laptop’s log-in window, a progress icon was spinning: ONE MOMENT PLEASE . . . DECRYPTING FILE . . . Bellamy’s gaze shot back up to Sato, whose eyes wer e locked on his. “I had not wanted to show you this ,” she said. “But you’ve left me no choice.” The screen flickered again, and Bellamy glanced bac k down as the file opened, its contents filling the entire LCD. For several moments, Bellamy stared at the screen, trying to make sense of what he was looking at. Gradually, as it began to dawn on him, he felt the blood draining from his face. He stared in horror, unable to look away. “But this is . . . impossible !” he exclaimed. “How . . . could this be!” Sato’s face was grim. “You tell me, Mr. Bellamy. You tell me.” As the Architect of the Capitol began to fully comp rehend the ramifications of what he was seeing, he could feel his entire world teetering precariously on the brink of disaster. My God . . . I ’ve made a terrible, terrible mistake! CHAPTER 84 Dean Galloway felt alive. Like all mortals, he knew the time was coming when he would shed his mortal shell, but tonight was not the night. His corporeal heart was beating strong and f ast . . . and his mind felt sharp. There is work to be done. As he ran his arthritic hands across the pyramid’s smooth surfaces, he could scarcely believe what he was feeling. I never imagined I would live to witness this momen t. For generations, the pieces of the symbolon map had been kept safely apart from one another. No w they were united at last. Galloway wondered if th is was the foretold time. Strangely, fate had selected two non-Masons to asse mble the pyramid. Somehow, this seemed fitting. The Mysteries are moving out of the inner circles . . . out of darkness . . . into the light. “Professor,” he said, turning his head in the direc tion of Langdon’s breathing. “Did Peter tell you why he wanted you to watch over the little package?” “He said powerful people wanted to steal it from hi m,” Langdon replied. The dean nodded. “Yes, Peter told me the same thing .” “ He did? ” Katherine said suddenly on his left. “ You and my brother spoke about this pyramid? ”"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" “Of course,” Galloway said. “Your brother and I hav e spoken on many things. I was once the Worshipful Master at the House of the Temple, and he comes to me for guidance at times. It was about a year ago t hat he came to me, deeply troubled. He sat exactly where y ou are now, and he asked me if I believed in supern atural premonitions.” “Premonitions?” Katherine sounded concerned. “You me an like . . . visions ?” “Not exactly. It was more visceral. Peter said he w as feeling the growing presence of a dark force in his life. He sensed something was watching him . . . waiting . . . intending to do him great harm.” “Obviously he was right,” Katherine said, “consider ing that the same man who killed our mother and Pet er’s son had come to Washington and become one of Peter’ s own Masonic brothers.” “True,” Langdon said, “but it doesn’t explain the i nvolvement of the CIA.” Galloway was not so sure. “Men in power are always interested in greater power.” “But . . . the CIA?” Langdon challenged. “And mysti cal secrets? Something doesn’t add up.” “Sure it does,” Katherine said. “ The CIA thrives on technological advancement and ha s always experimented with the mystical sciences—ESP, remote viewing, sen sory deprivation, pharmacologically induced highly mentalized states. It’s all the same thing—tapping the unseen potential of the human mind. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from Peter, it’s this: Science a nd mysticism are very closely related, distinguisha ble only by their approaches. They have identical goals . . . but different methods.” “Peter tells me,” Galloway said, “that your field o f study is a kind of modern mystical science?” “Noetics,” Katherine said, nodding. “And it’s provi ng man has powers unlike anything we can imagine.” She motioned to a stained-glass window depicting the fa miliar image of the “Luminous Jesus,” that of Christ with rays of light flowing from his head and hands. “In fact, I just used a supercooled charge-coupled devi ce to photograph the hands of a faith healer at work. The photos looked a lot like the image of Jesus in you r stained-glass window . . . streams of energy pourin g through the healer’s fingertips.” The well-trained mind, Galloway thought, hiding a smile. How do you think Jesus healed the sick? “I realize,” Katherine said, “ that modern medicine ridicules healers and shamans, but I saw this with my own eyes. My CCD cameras clearly photographed this man transmitting a massive energy field from his fingertips . . . and literally changing the cellula r makeup of his patient. If that’s not godlike power, then I don’t know what is.” Dean Galloway let himself smile. Katherine had the same fiery passion as her brother. “Peter once comp ared Noetic Scientists to the early explorers who were m ocked for embracing the heretical notion of a spherical earth. Almost overnight, these explorers went from fools to heroes, discovering uncharted worlds and expanding the horizons of everyone on the planet. P eter thinks you will do this as well. He has very high hopes for your work. After all, every great philoso phical shift in history began with a single bold id ea.” Galloway knew, of course, that one needn’t go to a lab to witness proof of this bold new idea, this pro posal of man’s untapped potential. This very cathedral he ld healing prayer circles for the sick, and repeate dly had witnessed truly miraculous results, medically docum ented physical transformations. The question was no t whether God had imbued man with great powers . . . but rather how we liberate those powers. The old dean placed his hands reverently around the sides of the Masonic Pyramid and spoke very quietl y. “My friends, I do not know exactly where this pyramid points . . . but I do know this . There is a great spiritual treasure buried out there somewhere . . . a treasure that has waited patiently in darkness f or generations. I believe it is a catalyst that has th e power to transform this world.” He now touched th e golden tip of the capstone. “And now that this pyramid is assembled . . . the time is fast approaching. And w hy shouldn ’ t it? The promise of a great transformational enlig htenment has been prophesied forever. ”"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" “Father,” Langdon said, his tone challenging, “we’r e all familiar with the Revelation of Saint John an d the literal meaning of the Apocalypse, but biblical pro phecy hardly seems—” “Oh, heavens, the Book of Revelation is a mess!” th e dean said. “Nobody knows how to read that. I’m talking about clear minds writing in clear language—the predictions of Saint Augustine, Sir Francis Bacon, Newton, Einstein, the list goes on and on, all anti cipating a transformative moment of enlightenment. Even Jesus himself said, ‘Nothing is hidden that will no t be made known, nor secret that will not come to l ight.’” “It’s a safe prediction to make,” Langdon said. “Kno wledge grows exponentially. The more we know, the greater our ability to learn, and the faster we expand our knowledge base.” “Yes,” Katherine added. “We see this in science all the time. Each new technology we invent becomes a tool with which to invent new technologies . . . and it snowballs. That’s why science has advanced more in the last five years than in the previous five thousand . Exponential growth. Mathematically, as time passe s, the exponential curve of progress becomes almost vertic al, and new development occurs incredibly fast.” Silence fell in the dean’s office, and Galloway sen sed that his two guests still had no idea how this pyramid could possibly help them reveal anything further. That is why fate brought you to me, he thought. I have a role to play. For many years, the Reverend Colin Galloway, along with his Masonic brothers, had played the role of gatekeeper. Now it was all changing. I am no longer a gatekeeper . . . I am a guide. “Professor Langdon?” Galloway said, reaching out ac ross his desk. “Take my hand if you will.” Robert Langdon felt uncertain as he stared across a t Dean Galloway’s outstretched palm. Are we going to pray? Politely, Langdon reached out and placed his right hand in the dean’s withered hand. The old man grasp ed it firmly but did not begin to pray. Instead, he found Langdon’s index finger and guided it downward into the stone box that had once housed the golden capstone. “Your eyes have blinded you,” the dean said. “If yo u saw with your fingertips as I do, you would reali ze this box has something left to teach you.” Dutifully, Langdon worked his fingertip around the inside of the box, but he felt nothing. The inside was perfectly smooth. “Keep looking,” Galloway prompted. Finally, Langdon’s fingertip felt something—a tiny raised circle— a minuscule dot in the center of the base of the box. He removed his hand and peered inside. The little circle was virtually invisible to the naked eye. What is that? “Do you recognize that symbol?” Galloway asked. “Symbol?” Langdon replied. “I can barely see anythi ng at all.” “Push down on it.” Langdon did as he asked, pressing his fingertip dow n onto the spot. What does he think will happen? “Hold your finger down,” the dean said. “Apply pres sure.” "},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Langdon glanced over at Katherine, who looked puzzl ed as she tucked a wisp of hair behind her ears. A few seconds later, the old dean finally nodded. “ Okay, remove your hand. The alchemy is complete.” Alchemy? Robert Langdon removed his hand from the stone box and sat in bewildered silence. Nothing had changed at all. The box just sat there on the desk. “Nothing,” Langdon said. “Look at your fingertip,” the dean replied. “You sh ould see a transformation.” Langdon looked at his finger, but the only transfor mation he could see was that he now had an indentat ion on his skin made by the circular nubbin—a tiny circle with a dot in the middle. “ Now do you recognize this symbol?” the dean asked. Although Langdon recognized the symbol, he was more impressed that the dean had been able to feel the detail of it. Seeing with one’s fingertips was appa rently a learned skill. “It’s alchemical,” Katherine said, sliding her chai r closer and examining Langdon’s finger. “It’s the ancient symbol for gold .” “Indeed it is.” The dean smiled and patted the box. “Professor, congratulations. You have just achieved what every alchemist in history has strived for. From a worthless substance, you’ve created gold.” Langdon frowned, unimpressed. The little parlor tri ck seemed to be no help at all. “An interesting ide a, sir, but I’m afraid this symbol—a circle with a round do t in the middle—has dozens of meanings. It’s called a circumpunct, and it’s one of the most widely used symbols in hi story.” “What are you talking about?” the dean asked, sound ing skeptical. Langdon was stunned that a Mason was not more famil iar with the spiritual importance of this symbol. “ Sir, the circumpunct has countless meanings. In ancient Egypt, it was the symbol for Ra—the sun god—and modern astronomy still uses it as the solar symbol. In Eastern philosophy, it represents the spiritual insight of the Third Eye, the divine rose, and the sign of ill umination. The Kabbalists use it to symbolize the K ether— the highest Sephiroth and ‘the most hidden of all h idden things.’ Early mystics called it the Eye of G od and it’s the origin of the All- Seeing Eye on the Great Seal. The Pythagoreans used the circumpunct as the symbol of the Monad—the Divine Truth, the Prisca Sapientia , the at-one-ment of mind and soul, and the—” “Enough!” Dean Galloway was chuckling now. “Profess or, thank you. You are correct, of course.” Langdon now realized he had just been played. He knew all that. “The circumpunct,” Galloway said, still smiling to himself, “is essentially the symbol of the Ancient Mysteries. For this reason, I would suggest that it s presence in this box is not mere coincidence. Leg end holds that the secrets of this map are hidden in th e smallest of details. ”"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" “Fine,” Katherine said, “but even if this symbol wa s inscribed there intentionally, it doesn’t bring u s any closer to deciphering the map, does it?” “You mentioned earlier that the wax seal you broke was embossed with Peter’s ring?” “That’s correct.” “And you said you have that ring with you?” “I do.” Langdon reached into his pocket, found the r ing, took it out of the plastic bag, and placed it on the desk in front of the dean. Galloway picked up the ring and began feeling its s urfaces. “ This unique ring was created at the same time as the Masonic Pyramid, and traditionally, it is worn by the Mason in charge of protecting the pyramid. Tonight, when I felt the tiny circumpunct on the bo ttom of the stone box, I realized that the ring is, in fact, part of the symbolon.” “It is?” “I’m certain of it. Peter is my closest friend, and he wore this ring for many years. I am quite famil iar with it.” He handed the ring to Langdon. “See for yourse lf.” Langdon took the ring and examined it, running his fingers over the double-headed phoenix, the number 33, the words ORDO AB CHAO , and also the words All is revealed at the thirty-third degree . He felt nothing helpful. Then, as his fingers traced down around th e outside of the band, he stopped short. Startled, he turned the ring over and eyed the very bottom of its band. “Did you find it?” Galloway said. “I think so, yes!” Langdon said. Katherine slid her chair closer. “What?” “The degree sign on the band,” Langdon said, showin g her. “ It’s so small that you don’t really notice it with your eyes, but if you feel it, you can tell it’s ac tually indented—like a tiny circular incision.” The degree sign was centered on the bottom of the band . . . and ad mittedly looked to be the same size as the raised n ubbin in the bottom of the cube. “Is it the same size?” Katherine moved closer still , sounding excited now. “There’s one way to find out.” He took the ring and lowered it into the box, aligning the two tiny cir cles. As he pushed down, the raised circle on the box slid i nto the ring’s opening, and there was a faint but d ecisive click. They all jumped. Langdon waited, but nothing happened. “What was that?!” the priest said. “Nothing,” Katherine replied. “The ring locked into place . . . but nothing else happened.” “No great transformation?” Galloway looked puzzled. We’re not done, Langdon realized, gazing down at the ring’s emboss ed insignia—a double-headed phoenix and the number 33. All is revealed at the thirty-third degree. His mind filled with thoughts of Pythagoras, sacred geometry, and angles; he wondered if perhaps degrees had a mathematical meaning."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" Slowly, heart beating faster now, he reached down a nd grasped the ring, which was affixed to the base of the cube. Then, slowly, he began turning the ring to th e right. All is revealed at the thirty-third degree. He turned the ring ten degrees . . . twenty degrees . . . thirty degrees— What happened next, Langdon never saw coming. CHAPTER 85 Transformation. Dean Galloway heard it happen, and so he didn’t need to see it. Across the desk from him, Langdon and Katherine wer e dead silent, no doubt staring in mute astonishmen t at the stone cube, which had just transformed itself l oudly before their very eyes. Galloway couldn’t help but smile. He had anticipate d the result, and although he still had no idea how this development would ultimately help them solve the ri ddle of the pyramid, he was enjoying the rare chanc e to teach a Harvard symbologist something about symbols . “Professor,” the dean said, “few people realize tha t the Masons venerate the shape of the cube—or ashlar, as we call it—because it is a three-dimensional repres entation of another symbol . . . a much older, two- dimensional symbol.” Galloway didn’t need to ask if the professor recognized the ancient symbol now ly ing before them on the desk. It was one of the most fam ous symbols in the world. Robert Langdon’s thoughts churned as he stared at t he transformed box on the desk in front of him. I had no idea . . . Moments ago, he had reached into the stone box, gra sped the Masonic ring, and gently turned it. As he rotated the ring through thirty-three degrees, the cube had suddenly changed before his eyes. The squa re panels that made up the sides of the box fell away from one another as their hidden hinges released. T he box collapsed all at once, its side panels and lid fall ing outward, slapping loudly on the desk. The cube becomes a cross, Langdon thought. Symbolic alchemy. "},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Katherine looked bewildered by the sight of the col lapsed cube. “ The Masonic Pyramid relates to . . . Christianity?” For a moment, Langdon had wondered the same thing. After all, the Christian crucifix was a respected symbol within the Masons, and certainly there were plenty of Christian Masons. However, Masons were al so Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, and those who had no name for their God. The presence of an exclusiv ely Christian symbol seemed restrictive. Then the true meaning of this symbol had dawned on him. “It’s not a crucifix,” Langdon said, standing up no w. “The cross with the circumpunct in the middle is a binary symbol— two symbols fused to create one .” “What are you saying?” Katherine’s eyes followed hi m as he paced the room. “The cross,” Langdon said, “was not a Christian sym bol until the fourth century. Long before that, it was used by the Egyptians to represent the intersection of two dimensions—the human and the celestial. As above, so below. It was a visual representation of the juncture where man and God become one.” “Okay.” “The circumpunct,” Langdon said, “we already know h as many meanings— one of its most esoteric being the rose, the alchemical symbol for perfection. But, when yo u place a rose on the center of a cross, you create another symbol entirely—the Rose Cross.” Galloway reclined in his chair, smiling. “My, my. N ow you’re cooking.” Katherine stood now, too. “What am I missing?” “The Rose Cross,” Langdon explained, “is a common sy mbol in Freemasonry. In fact, one of the degrees of the Scottish Rite is called ‘Knights of the Rose Cr oss’ and honors the early Rosicrucians, who contrib uted to Masonic mystical philosophy. Peter may have mention ed the Rosicrucians to you. Dozens of great scienti sts were members—John Dee, Elias Ashmole, Robert Fludd— ” “Absolutely,” Katherine said. “I’ve read all of the Rosicrucian manifestos in my research.” Every scientist should, Langdon thought. The Order of the Rose Cross—or mo re formally the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis—had an enigmatic histor y that had greatly influenced science and closely paralleled the legend of the Ancient Mysteries . . . early sages possessing secret wisdom that was pas sed down through the ages and studied by only the brigh test minds. Admittedly, history’s list of famous Rosicrucians was a who’s who of European Renaissanc e luminaries: Paracelsus, Bacon, Fludd, Descartes, Pascal, Spinoza, Newton, Leibniz. According to Rosicrucian doctrine, the order was “b uilt on esoteric truths of the ancient past,” truths which had to be “concealed from the average man” and whic h promised great insight into “the spiritual realm. ” The brotherhood’s symbol had blossomed over the years i nto a flowering rose on an ornate cross, but it had begun as a more modest dotted circle on an unadorne d cross—the simplest manifestation of the rose on t he simplest manifestation of the cross. “Peter and I often discuss Rosicrucian philosophy,” Galloway told Katherine. As the dean began outlining the interrelationship b etween Masonry and Rosicrucianism, Langdon felt his attention drawn back to the same nagging thought he ’d had all night. Jeova Sanctus Unus. This phrase is linked to alchemy somehow. He still could not remember exactly what Peter had told him about the phrase, but for some reason, the mention of Rosicrucianism seemed to have rekindled the thought. Think, Robert! “The Rosicrucian founder,” Galloway was saying, “wa s allegedly a German mystic who went by the name Christian Rosenkreuz—a pseudonym obviously, perhaps even for Francis Bacon, who some historians believe founded the group himself, although there i s no proof of—” "},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"“ A pseudonym! ” Langdon declared suddenly, startling even himself. “ That ’ s it! Jeova Sanctus Unus! It ’ s a pseudonym!” “What are you talking about?” Katherine demanded. Langdon’s pulse had quickened now. “All night, I’ve been trying to remember what Peter told me about Jeova Sanctus Unus and its relationship to alchemy. Finally I remembe red! It’s not about alchemy so much as about an alchemist ! A very famous alchemist!” Galloway chuckled. “It’s about time, Professor. I m entioned his name twice and also the word pseudonym .” Langdon stared at the old dean. “You knew ?” “Well, I had my suspicions when you told me the eng raving said Jeova Sanctus Unus and had been decrypted using Dürer’s alchemical magic square, bu t when you found the Rose Cross, I was certain. As you probably know, the personal papers of the scientist in question included a very heavily annotated copy of the Rosicrucian manifestos.” “Who?” Katherine asked. “One of the world’s greatest scientists!” Langdon r eplied. “He was an alchemist, a member of the Royal Society of London, a Rosicrucian, and he signed some of his most secretive science paper s with a pseudonym— ‘Jeova Sanctus Unus’ !” “One True God?” Katherine said. “Modest guy.” “Brilliant guy, actually,” Galloway corrected. “ He signed his name that way because, like the ancie nt Adepts, he understood himself as divine. In addition, because the sixteen letter s in Jeova Sanctus Unus could be rearranged to spell his name in Latin, making it a perfect pseudonym.” Katherine now looked puzzled. “ Jeova Sanctus Unus is an anagram of a famous alchemist’s name in Lati n?” Langdon grabbed a piece of paper and pencil off the dean’s desk, writing as he talked. “Latin intercha nges the letters J for I and the letter V for U, which means Jeova Sanctus Unus can actually be perfectly rearranged to spell this man’s name.” Langdon wrote down sixteen letters: Isaacus Neutonuus. He handed the slip of paper to Katherine and said, “I think you’ve heard of him.” “Isaac Newton?” Katherine demanded, looking at the paper. “That’s what the engraving on the pyramid was trying to tell us!” For a moment, Langdon was back in Westminster Abbey , standing at Newton’s pyramidical tomb, where he had experienced a similar epiphany. And tonight, the great scientist surfaces again. It was no coincidence, of course . . . the pyramids, mysteries, science, hidd en knowledge . . . it was all intertwined. Newton’ s name had always been a recurring guidepost for those seeking secret knowledge. “Isaac Newton,” Galloway said, “must have something to do with how to decipher the meaning of the pyramid. I can’t imagine what it would be, but—” “Genius!” Katherine exclaimed, her eyes going wide. “That’s how we transform the pyramid!” “You understand?” Langdon said. “Yes!” she said. “I can’t believe we didn’t see it! It has been staring us right in the face. A simple alchemical process. I can transform this pyramid using basic s cience! Newtonian science!” "},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Langdon strained to understand. “Dean Galloway,” Katherine said. “If you read the r ing, it says—” “Stop!” The old dean suddenly raised his finger in the air and motioned for silence. Gently, he cocked his head to the side, as if he were listening to someth ing. After a moment, he stood up abruptly. “ My friends, this pyramid obviously has secrets left to reveal. I don ’t know what Ms. Solomon is getting at, but if she knows your next step, then I have played my role. Pack up your things and say no more to me. Leave me in dar kness for the moment. I would prefer to have no informati on to share should our visitors try to force me.” “Visitors?” Katherine said, listening. “I don’t hea r anyone.” “You will, ” Galloway said, heading for the door. “Hurry.” Across town, a cell tower was attempting to contact a phone that lay in pieces on Massachusetts Avenue . Finding no signal, it redirected the call to voice mail. “Robert!” Warren Bellamy’s panicked voice shouted. “Where are you?! Call me! Something terrible is happening!” CHAPTER 86 In the cerulean glow of his basement lights, Mal’akh stoo d at the stone table and continued his preparations . As he worked, his empty stomach growled. He paid no heed. His days of servitude to the whims of his fl esh were behind him. Transformation requires sacrifice. Like many of history’s most spiritually evolved men , Mal’akh had committed to his path by making the noblest of flesh sacrifices. Castration had been le ss painful than he had imagined. And, he had learne d, far more common. Every year, thousands of men underwent surgical gelding—orchiectomy, as the process was known—their motivations ranging from transgender is sues, to curbing sexual addictions, to deep-seated spiritual beliefs. For Mal’akh, the reasons were of the highest nature. Like the mythological self-cas trated Attis, Mal’akh knew that achieving immortality requ ired a clean break with the material world of male and female. The androgyne is one. Nowadays, eunuchs were shunned, although the ancien ts understood the inherent power of this transmutational sacrifice. Even the early Christian s had heard Jesus Himself extol its virtues in Matt hew 19:12: “There are those who have made themselves eunuchs f or the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it.” Peter Solomon had made a flesh sacrifice, although a single hand was a small price in the grand scheme . By night’s end, however, Solomon would be sacrificing much, much more. In order to create, I must destroy. Such was the nature of polarity. Peter Solomon, of course, deserved the fate that aw aited him tonight. It would be a fitting end. Long ago, he"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"had played the pivotal role in Mal ’ akh ’ s mortal life path. For this reason, Peter had been chosen to play the pivotal role in Mal’akh’s great transformation. Thi s man had earned all the horror and pain he was abo ut to endure. Peter Solomon was not the man the world bel ieved he was. He sacrificed his own son. Peter Solomon had once presented his son, Zachary, with an impossible choice—wealth or wisdom. Zachary chose poorly. The boy’ s decision had begun a chain of events that eventua lly dragged the young man into the depths of hell. Soganlik Prison. Zachary Solomon had died in that Turkish prison. T he whole world knew the story . . . but what they didn’t know was that Pete r Solomon could have saved his son. I was there, Mal’akh thought. I heard it all. Mal’akh had never forgotten that night. Solomon’s b rutal decision had meant the end of his son, Zach, but it had been the birth of Mal’akh. Some must die that others may live. As the light over Mal’akh’ s head began changing color again, he realized the hour was late. He completed his preparations and headed back up the ramp. It was ti me to attend to matters of the mortal world. CHAPTER 87 All is revealed at the thirty-third degree, Katherine thought as she ran. I know how to transform the pyramid! The answer had been right in front of them all nigh t. Katherine and Langdon were alone now, dashing throu gh the cathedral’s annex, following signs for “The Garth.” Now, exactly as the dean had promised, they burst out of the cathedral into a massive, walled- in courtyard. The cathedral garth was a cloistered, pentagonal ga rden with a bronze postmodern fountain. Katherine w as amazed how loudly the fountain’s flowing water seem ed to be reverberating in the courtyard. Then she realized it was not the fountain she was hearing. “Helicopter!” she shouted as a beam of light pierce d the night sky above them. “Get under that portico !” The dazzling glare of a searchlight flooded the gar th just as Langdon and Katherine reached the other side, slipping beneath a Gothic arch into a tunnel that l ed to the outside lawn. They waited, huddled in the tunnel, as the helicopter passed overhead and began circlin g the cathedral in wide arcs. “I guess Galloway was right about hearing visitors, ” Katherine said, impressed. Bad eyes make for great ears. Her own ears now pounded rhythmically with her rac ing pulse. “This way,” Langdon said, clutching his daybag and m oving through the passage. Dean Galloway had given them a single key and a cle ar set of directions. Unfortunately, when they reac hed the end of the short tunnel, they found themselves separated from their destination by a wide- open expanse of lawn, currently flooded with light from the helicop ter overhead. “We can’t get across,” Katherine said. "},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"“ Hold on . . . look. ” Langdon pointed to a black shadow that was material izing on the lawn to their left. The shadow began as an amorphous blob, but it was growi ng quickly, moving in their direction, becoming mor e defined, rushing at them faster and faster, stretch ing, and finally transforming itself into a massive black rectangle crowned by two impossibly tall spires. “The cathedral facade is blocking the searchlight,” Langdon said. “They’re landing out in front!” Langdon grabbed Katherine’s hand. “Run! Now!” Inside the cathedral, Dean Galloway felt a lightnes s in his step that he had not felt in years. He mov ed through the Great Crossing, down the nave toward th e narthex and the front doors. He could hear the helicopter hovering in front of t he cathedral now, and he imagined its lights coming through the rose window in front of him, throwing s pectacular colors all over the sanctuary. He recall ed the days when he could see color. Ironically, the light less void that had become his world had illuminated many things for him. I see more clearly now than ever. Galloway had been called to God as a young man and over his lifetime had loved the church as much as a ny man could. Like many of his colleagues who had give n their lives in earnest to God, Galloway was weary . He had spent his life straining to be heard above t he din of ignorance. What did I expect? From the Crusades, to the Inquisition, to American politics—the name Jesus had been hijacked as an all y in all kinds of power struggles. Since the beginning o f time, the ignorant had always screamed the loudes t, herding the unsuspecting masses and forcing them to do their bidding. They defended their worldly desi res by citing Scripture they did not understand. They c elebrated their intolerance as proof of their convi ctions. Now, after all these years, mankind had finally man aged to utterly erode everything that had once been so beautiful about Jesus. Tonight, encountering the symbol of the Rose Cross had fueled him with great hope, reminding him of th e prophecies written in the Rosicrucian manifestos, w hich Galloway had read countless times in the past and could still recall. Chapter One: Jehova will redeem humanity by revealing those secr ets which he previously reserved only for the elect. Chapter Four: The whole world shall become as one book and all th e contradictions of science and theology shall be reconciled. Chapter Seven: Before the end of the world, God shall create a gre at flood of spiritual light to alleviate the suffering of humankind. Chapter Eight: Before this revelation is possible, the world must sleep away the intoxication of her poisoned chalice, which was filled with the false life of th e theological vine. Galloway knew the church had long ago lost her way, and he had dedicated his life to righting her cour se. Now, he realized, the moment was fast approaching. It is always darkest before the dawn. CIA field agent Turner Simkins was perched on the s trut of the Sikorsky helicopter as it touched down on the frosty grass. He leaped off, joined by his men, and immediately waved the chopper back up into the air to keep an eye on all the exits. Nobody leaves this building."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" As the chopper rose back into the night sky, Simkin s and his team ran up the stairs to the cathedral’s main entrance. Before he could decide which of the six d oors to pound on, one of them swung open. “Yes?” a calm voice said from the shadows. Simkins could barely make out the hunched figure in priest’s robes. “Are you Dean Colin Galloway?” “I am,” the old man replied. “I’m looking for Robert Langdon. Have you seen him? ” The old man stepped forward now, staring past Simki ns with eerie blank eyes. “Now, wouldn’t that be a miracle.” CHAPTER 88 Time is running out. Security analyst Nola Kaye was already on edge, and the third mug of coffee she was now drinking had begun coursing through her like an electric current . No word yet from Sato. Finally, her phone rang, and Nola leaped on it. “OS ,” she answered. “Nola here.” “Nola, it’s Rick Parrish in systems security.” Nola slumped. No Sato. “Hi, Rick. What can I do for you?” “I wanted to give you a heads-up—our department may have information relevant to what you’ re working on tonight.” Nola set down her coffee. How the hell do you know what I’m working on tonight? “I beg your pardon?” “Sorry, it’s the new CI program we’re beta-testing, ” Parrish said. “It keeps flagging your workstation number.” Nola now realized what he was talking about. The Ag ency was currently running a new piece of “collaborative integration” software designed to pr ovide real-time alerts to disparate CIA departments when they happened to be processing related data fields. In an era of time-sensitive terrorist threats, the key to thwarting disaster was often as simple as a heads-u p telling you that the guy down the hall was analyz ing the very data you needed. As far as Nola was concerned, this CI software had proven more of a distraction than any real help— constant interruption software, she called it. “Right, I forgot,” Nola said. “What have you got?” She was positive that nobody else in the building knew about this crisis, much less could be working on it . The only computer work Nola had done tonight was historical research for Sato on esoteric Masonic to pics . Nonetheless, she was obliged to play the game. “Well, it’s probably nothing,” Parrish said, “but w e stopped a hacker tonight, and the CI program keep s suggesting I share the information with you. ”"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" A hacker? Nola sipped her coffee. “I’m listening.” “About an hour ago,” Parrish said, “we snagged a gu y named Zoubianis trying to access a file on one of our internal databases. This guy claims it was a job fo r hire and that he has no idea why he was being paid to access this particular file or even that it was on a CIA server.” “Okay.” “We finished questioning him, and he’s clean. But h ere’s the weird thing—the same file he was targeting had been flagged earlier tonight by an internal search engine. It looks like someone piggybacked into our system, ran a specific keyword search, and generated a reda ction. The thing is, the keywords they used are really strange. And there’s one in particular that the CI flagged as a high-priority match—one that’s unique to both of our data sets.” He paused. “Do you know the word . . . symbolon ?” Nola jolted upright, spilling coffee on her desk. “The other keywords are just as unusual,” Parrish c ontinued. “Pyramid, portal—” “Get down here,” Nola commanded, mopping up her des k. “And bring everything you’ve got!” “These words actually mean something to you?” “NOW!” CHAPTER 89 Cathedral College is an elegant, castlelike edifice located adjacent to the National Cathedral. The College of Preachers, as it was originally envisioned by the f irst Episcopal bishop of Washington, was founded to provide ongoing education for clergy after their or dination. Today, the college offers a wide variety of programs on theology, global justice, healing, and spirituality. Langdon and Katherine had made the dash across the lawn and used Galloway’s key to slip inside just as the helicopter rose back over the cathedral, its floodl ights turning night back into day. Now, standing br eathless inside the foyer, they surveyed their surroundings. The windows provided sufficient illumination, and Langdon saw no reason to turn the lights on and tak e a chance of broadcasting their whereabouts to the helicopter overhead. As they moved down the central hallway, they passed a series of conference halls, classrooms, and sitting areas. The interior reminde d Langdon of the neo-Gothic buildings of Yale University—breathtaking on the outside, and yet sur prisingly utilitarian on the inside, their period e legance having been retrofitted to endure heavy foot traffi c. “Down here,” Katherine said, motioning toward the f ar end of the hall. Katherine had yet to share with Langdon her new rev elation regarding the pyramid, but apparently the reference to Isaacus Neutonuus had sparked it. All she had said as they crossed the lawn was that the pyramid could be transformed using simple science. Everythi ng she needed, she believed, could probably be foun d in this building. Langdon had no idea what she needed or how Katherine intended to transform a solid piec e of granite or gold, but considering he had just witnes sed a cube metamorphose into a Rosicrucian cross, h e was willing to have faith. They reached the end of the hall and Katherine frow ned, apparently not seeing what she wanted. “ You said"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"this building has dormitory facilities? ” “Yes, for residential conferences.” “So they must have a kitchen in here somewhere, right?” “You’re hungry?” She frowned back at him. “No, I need a lab.” Of course you do. Langdon spotted a descending staircase that bore a promising symbol. America’s favorite pictogram. The basement kitchen was industrial looking—lots of stainless steel and big bowls— clearly designed to cook for large groups. The kitchen had no windows. Kathe rine closed the door and flipped on the lights. The exhaust fans came on automatically. She began rooting around in the cupboards for whate ver it was she needed. “Robert,” she directed, “put the pyramid out on the island, if you would.” Feeling like the novice sous chef taking orders fro m Daniel Boulud, Langdon did as he was told, removi ng the pyramid from his bag and placing the gold capst one on top of it. When he finished, Katherine was b usy filling an enormous pot with hot tap water. “Would you please lift this to the stove for me?” Langdon heaved the sloshing pot onto the stove as K atherine turned on the gas burner and cranked up th e flame. “Are we doing lobsters?” he asked hopefully. “Very funny. No, we’re doing alchemy. And for the r ecord, this is a pasta pot, not a lobster pot.” She pointed to the perforated strainer insert that she had remo ved from the pot and placed on the island beside th e pyramid. Silly me. “And boiling pasta is going to help us decipher th e pyramid?” Katherine ignored the comment, her tone turning ser ious. “As I’m sure you know, there is a historical and symbolic reason the Masons chose thirty-three as their highest deg ree.” “Of course,” Langdon said. In the days of Pythagora s, six centuries before Christ, the tradition of numerology hailed the number 33 as the highest of all the Mast er Numbers. It was the most sacred figure, symboliz ing Divine Truth. The tradition lived on within the Mas ons . . . and elsewhere. It was no coincidence that Christians were taught that Jesus was crucified at age thirty-three, despite no real historical eviden ce to that effect. Nor was it coincidence that Joseph was said to have been thirty-three when he married the Virgin Mary, or th at Jesus accomplished thirty-three miracles, or tha t God’s name was mentioned thirty-three times in Genesis, o r that, in Islam, all the dwellers of heaven were permanently thirty - three years old."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" “Thirty-three,” Katherine said, “is a sacred number in many mystical traditions.” “Correct.” Langdon still had no idea what this had to do with a pasta pot. “So it should come as no surprise to you that an ea rly alchemist, Rosicrucian, and mystic like Isaac N ewton also considered the number thirty-three special.” “I’m sure he did,” Langdon replied. “Newton was dee p into numerology, prophecy, and astrology, but wha t does—” “All is revealed at the thirty-third degree.” Langdon pulled Peter’s ring from his pocket and rea d the inscription. Then he glanced back at the pot of water. “Sorry, you lost me.” “Robert, earlier tonight, we all assumed ‘thirty-th ird degree’ referred to the Masonic degree, and yet when we rotated that ring thirty-three degrees, the cube transformed and revealed a cross. At that moment, we realized the word degree was being used in another sense.” “Yes. Degrees of arc.” “Exactly. But degree has a third meaning as well.” Langdon eyed the pot of water on the stove. “Temper ature.” “Exactly!” she said. “It was right in front of us al l night. ‘All is revealed at the thirty-third degre e.’ If we bring this pyramid’s temperature to thirty-three de grees . . . it may just reveal something.” Langdon knew Katherine Solomon was exceptionally br ight, and yet she seemed to be missing a rather obvious point. “If I’m not mistaken, thirty-three d egrees is almost freezing. Shouldn’t we be putting the pyramid in the freezer?” Katherine smiled. “Not if we want to follow the rec ipe written by the great alchemist and Rosicrucian mystic who signed his papers Jeova Sanctus Unus. ” Isaacus Neutonuus wrote recipes? “Robert, temperature is the fundamental alchemical catalyst, and it was not always measured in Fahrenheit and Celsius. There are far older temperature scales, one of them invented by Isaac— ” “The Newton Scale!” Langdon said, realizing she was right. “Yes! Isaac Newton invented an entire system of qua ntifying temperature based entirely on natural phenomena. The temperature of melting ice was Newton’s base point, and he called it ‘the zeroth degree.’ ” She paused. “I suppose you can gu ess what degree he assigned the temperature of boiling water—the king of all alchemical processes?” “Thirty-three.” “Yes, thirty-three! The thirty-third degree. On the Newton Scale, the temperature of boiling water is thirty- three degrees. I remember asking my brother once wh y Newton chose that number. I mean, it seemed so random. Boiling water is the most fundamental alche mical process, and he chose thirty-three? Why not a hundred? Why not something more elegant? Peter expl ained that, to a mystic like Isaac Newton, there wa s no number more elegant than thirty-three.” All is revealed at the thirty -third degree. Langdon glanced at the pot of water and then over at the pyramid. “ Katherine, the pyramid is made out of solid granite and solid gold. Do you really think boiling water is hot"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"enough to transform it? ” The smile on her face told Langdon that Katherine k new something he did not know. Confidently, she walked over to the island, lifted the gold-capped, granite pyramid, and set it in the strainer. Then s he carefully lowered it into the bubbling water. “Let’ s find out, shall we?” High above the National Cathedral, the CIA pilot lo cked the helicopter in auto-hover mode and surveyed the perimeter of the building and the grounds. No movement. His thermal imaging couldn’t penetrate the cathedral stone, and so he couldn’t tell what the t eam was doing inside, but if anyone tried to slip o ut, the thermal would pick it up. It was sixty seconds later that a thermal sensor pi nged. Working on the same principle as home-securit y systems, the detector had identified a strong tempe rature differential. Usually this meant a human for m moving through a cool space, but what appeared on t he monitor was more of a thermal cloud, a patch of hot air drifting across the lawn. The pilot found the s ource, an active vent on the side of Cathedral Coll ege. Probably nothing, he thought. He saw these kinds of gradients all th e time. Someone cooking or doing laundry. As he was about to turn away, though, he realized something odd. There were no cars in the parking lot and no lights on anywhere in the building. He studied the UH-60’s imaging system for a long mo ment. Then he radioed down to his team leader. “Simkins, it’s probably nothing, but . . .” “Incandescent temperature indicator!” Langdon had t o admit, it was clever. “It’s simple science,” Katherine said. “Different s ubstances incandesce at different temperatures. We call them thermal markers. Science uses these markers al l the time.” Langdon gazed down at the submerged pyramid and cap stone. Wisps of steam were beginning to curl over the bubbling water, although he was not feeling hop eful. He glanced at his watch, and his heart rate accelerated: 11:45 P.M. “You believe something here will luminesce as it heats up?” “Not luminesce, Robert. Incandesce . There’s a big difference. Incandescence is caused by heat, and it occurs at a specific temperature. For example, when steel manufacturers temper beams, they spray a grid on th em with a transparent coating that incandesces at a sp ecific target temperature so they know when the bea ms are done. Think of a mood ring. Just put it on your fin ger, and it changes color from body heat.” “Katherine, this pyramid was built in the 1800s! I can understand a craftsman making hidden release hi nges in a stone box, but applying some kind of transpare nt thermal coating?” “Perfectly feasible,” she said, glancing hopefully at the submerged pyramid. “The early alchemists used organic phosphors all the time as thermal markers. The Chinese made colored fireworks, and even the Egyptians—” Katherine stopped midsentence, staring intently into the roiling water. “What?” Langdon followed her gaze into the turbulen t water but saw nothing at all. Katherine leaned in, staring more intently into the water. Suddenly she turned and ran across the kitc hen toward the door. “Where are you going?” Langdon shouted. She slid to a stop at the kitchen light switch, fli pped it off. The lights and exhaust fan went off, p lunging the room into total darkness and silence. Langdon turne d back to the pyramid and peered through the steam at the capstone beneath the water. By the time Katheri ne made it back to his side, his mouth had fallen o pen in disbelief. Exactly as Katherine had predicted, a small section of the metal capstone was starting to glow beneath the water. Letters were starting to appear, and they we re getting brighter as the water heated up."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" “Text!” Katherine whispered. Langdon nodded, dumbstruck. The glowing words were materializing just beneath the engraved inscription on the capstone. It looked like only three words, a nd although Langdon could not yet read what the wor ds said, he wondered if they would unveil everything t hey had been looking for tonight. The pyramid is a real map, Galloway had told them, and it points to a real location. As the letters shone brighter, Katherine turned off the gas, and the water slowly stopped churning. Th e capstone now came into focus beneath the water’s ca lm surface. Three shining words were clearly legible. CHAPTER 90 In the dim light of the Cathedral College kitchen, Langdo n and Katherine stood over the pot of water and stared at the transformed capstone beneath the surf ace. On the side of the golden capstone, an incande scent message was glowing. Langdon read the shining text, scarcely able to bel ieve his eyes. He knew the pyramid was rumored to r eveal a specific location . . . but he had never imagined that the location would be quite this specific. Eight Franklin Square “A street address,” he whispered, stunned. Katherine looked equally amazed. “I don’t know what ’s there, do you?” Langdon shook his head. He knew Franklin Square was one of the older sections of Washington, but he wasn’t familiar with the address. He looked at the tip of the capstone, and read downward, taking in t he entire text. The secret hides within The Order Eight Franklin Square Is there some kind of Order on Franklin Square? Is there a building that hides the opening to a dee p spiral staircase ? Whether or not there was actually something buried at that address, Langdon had no idea. The importan t issue at this point was that he and Katherine had d eciphered the pyramid and now possessed the informa tion required to negotiate Peter’s release. And not a moment too soon. "},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The glowing arms on Langdon ’ s Mickey Mouse watch indicated that they had less t han ten minutes to spare. “Make the call,” Katherine said, motioning to a pho ne on the wall in the kitchen. “Now!” The sudden arrival of this moment startled Langdon, and he found himself hesitating. “Are we sure about this?” “I most certainly am.” “I’m not telling him anything until we know Peter i s safe.” “Of course not. You remember the number, right?” Langdon nodded and made his way over to the kitchen phone. He lifted the receiver and dialed the man’s cell-phone number. Katherine came over and placed h er head next to his so she could listen in. As the line began to ring, Langdon prepared himself for the eer ie whisper of the man who had tricked him earlier tonight. Finally, the call connected. There was no greeting, though. No voice. Only the s ound of breathing at the other end. Langdon waited and then finally spoke. “I have the information you want, but if you want it, you’ll ha ve to give us Peter.” “Who is this?” a woman’s voice replied. Langdon jumped. “Robert Langdon,” he said reflexive ly. “Who are you ?” For an instant he thought he must have dialed incorrectly. “Your name is Langdon?” The woman sounded surprised. “There’s someone here asking for you.” What? “I’m sorry, who is this?” “Officer Paige Montgomery with Preferred Security.” Her voice seemed shaky. “ Maybe you can help us with this. About an hour ago, my partner responded to a 911 call in Kalorama Heights . . . a possible hosta ge situation. I lost all contact with her, and so I ca lled backup and came to check the residence. We fou nd my partner dead in the backyard. The home owner was go ne, and so we broke in. A cell phone was ringing on the hall table, and I—” “You’re inside?” Langdon demanded. “Yes, and the 911 tip . . . was a good one,” the wo man stammered. “Sorry if I sound rattled, but my pa rtner’s dead, and we found a man being held here against hi s will. He’s in bad shape, and we’re working on him now. He’s been asking for two people—one named Lang don and one named Katherine.” “That’s my brother!” Katherine blurted into the rec eiver, pressing her head closer to Langdon’s. “I mad e the 911 call! Is he okay?!” “Actually, ma’am, he’s . . .” The woman’s voice cra cked. “He’s in bad shape. He’s missing his right ha nd . . .” “Please,” Katherine urged. “I want to talk to him!” “They’re working on him at the moment. He’s in and out of consciousness. If you’re anywhere in the are a, you should get over here. He obviously wants to see you.” "},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"“ We ’ re about six minutes away! ” Katherine said. “Then I suggest you hurry.” There was a muffled noi se in the background, and the woman then returned t o the line. “Sorry, it looks like I’m needed. I’ll sp eak to you when you arrive.” The line went dead. CHAPTER 91 Inside Cathedral College, Langdon and Katherine bounded up the base ment stairs and hurried down a darkened hallway looking for a front exit. No longe r did they hear the sounds of helicopter blades ove rhead, and Langdon felt hopeful they could slip out unseen and find their way up to Kalorama Heights to see P eter. They found him. He’s alive. Thirty seconds earlier, when they’d hung up with th e female security guard, Katherine had hurriedly ho isted the steaming pyramid and capstone out of the water. The pyramid was still dripping when she lowered it into Langdon’s leather bag. Now he could feel the heat r adiating through the leather. Excitement over Peter’s discovery had temporarily t rumped any further reflection on the capstone’s glo wing message— Eight Franklin Square— but there would be time for that once they got to Peter. As they rounded the corner at the top of the stairs , Katherine stopped short and pointed into a sittin g room across the hall. Through the bay window, Langdon co uld see a sleek black helicopter sitting silent on the lawn. A lone pilot stood beside it, facing away fro m them and talking on his radio. There was also a b lack Escalade with tinted windows parked nearby. Staying in the shadows, Langdon and Katherine moved into the sitting room, and peered out the window t o see if they could see the rest of the field team. T hankfully, the huge lawn outside the National Cathe dral was empty. “They must be inside the cathedral,” Langdon said. “They’re not,” a deep voice said behind them. Langdon and Katherine wheeled around to see who had spoken. In the doorway of the sitting room, two black-clad figures aimed laser-sighted rifles at th em. Langdon could see a glowing red dot dancing on his chest. “Nice to see you again, Professor,” said a familiar raspy voice. The agents parted, and the tiny form of Director Sato sliced effortlessly through, crossing the sitting room and stopping directly in front of Langdon. “You’ve made some exceedingly poor choices tonight. ” “The police found Peter Solomon,” Langdon declared forcefully. “He’s in bad shape, but he’ll live. It’s over.” If Sato was surprised Peter had been found, she did not show it. Her eyes were unflinching as she walk ed to Langdon and stopped only inches away. “Professor, I can assure you, this is nowhere near over. And if the police are now involved, it has only become more se rious. As I told you earlier this evening, this is an extremely delicate situation. You never should have run away with that pyramid.” "},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"“ Ma ’ am, ” Katherine blurted, “ I need to see my brother. You can have the pyramid, but you must let — ” “I must ?” Sato demanded, spinning to Katherine. “Ms. Solom on, I assume?” She stared at Katherine with fire in her eyes and then turned back to Langdon. “Put t he leather bag on the table.” Langdon glanced down at the pair of laser sights on his chest. He set the leather bag on the coffee ta ble. An agent approached cautiously, unzipped the bag, and pulled the two sides apart. A little puff of trappe d steam billowed up out of the bag. He aimed his light insi de, stared for a long, puzzled moment, and then nod ded to Sato. Sato walked over and peered into the bag. The wet p yramid and capstone glistened in the beam of the flashlight. Sato crouched down, looking very closel y at the golden capstone, which Langdon realized sh e had only seen in X-ray. “The inscription,” Sato demanded. “Does it mean any thing to you? ‘The secret hides within The Order’?” “We’re not sure, ma’am.” “Why is the pyramid steaming hot?” “We submerged it in boiling water,” Katherine said without hesitation. “It was part of the process of deciphering the code. We’ll tell you everything, bu t please let us go see my brother. He’s been throug h—” “You boiled the pyramid?” Sato demanded. “Turn off the flashlight,” Katherine said. “Look at the capstone. You can probably still see.” The agent flicked off his light, and Sato knelt dow n before the capstone. Even from where Langdon was standing, he could see that the text on the capston e was still glowing slightly. “Eight Franklin Square?” Sato said, sounding amazed . “Yes, ma’am. That text was written with an incandes cent lacquer or something. The thirty-third degree was actually—” “And the address?” Sato demanded. “Is this what this guy wants?” “Yes,” Langdon said. “He believes the pyramid is a map that will tell him the location of a great trea sure— the key to unlocking the Ancient Mysteries.” Sato looked again at the capstone, her expression o ne of disbelief. “Tell me,” she said, fear creeping into her voice, “have you contacted this man yet? Have you a lready given him this address?” “We tried.” Langdon explained what had happened whe n they called the man’s cell phone. Sato listened, running her tongue over her yellow t eeth as he spoke. Despite looking ready to erupt wi th anger over the situation, she turned to one of her agents and spoke in a restrained whisper. “Send him in. He’s in the SUV.” The agent nodded and spoke into his transceiver. “Send who in?” Langdon said. “The only person who has any hope of fixing the god damn mess you made!” “What mess?” Langdon fired back. “Now that Peter is safe, everything is—” “ For Christ ’ s sake! ” Sato exploded. “ This is not about Peter! I tried to tell you that at the Capitol Bui lding,"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Professor, but you chose to work against me rather than with me! Now you ’ ve made an ungodly mess! When you destroyed your cell phone, which, by the way, w e were tracking, you cut off your communication with this man. And this address you uncovered—whatever t he hell it is—this address was our one chance to catch this lunatic. I needed you to play his game, to provide him with this address so we would know where the hell to catch him!” Before Langdon could reply, Sato directed the remai nder of her wrath at Katherine. “And you, Ms. Solomon! You knew where this maniac lived? Why didn’t you tell me? Y ou sent a rent-a-cop to this man’s house? Don’t you see you’ve ruined an y chance we had of catching him there? I’m glad you r brother is safe, but let me tell you this, we are f acing a crisis tonight whose ramifications far outr each your family. They will be felt all around the world. The man who took your brother has enormous power, and we need to catch him immediately.” As she finished her tirade, the tall, elegant silho uette of Warren Bellamy emerged from the shadows an d stepped into the sitting room. He looked rumpled, b ruised, and shaken . . . like he’d been through hel l. “Warren!” Langdon stood up. “Are you okay?” “No,” he replied. “Not really.” “Did you hear? Peter is safe!” Bellamy nodded, looking dazed, as if nothing matter ed anymore. “Yes, I just heard your conversation. I ’m glad.” “Warren, what the hell is going on?” Sato intervened. “You boys can catch up in a minute . Right now, Mr. Bellamy is going to reach out to t his lunatic and communicate with him. Just like he’s be en doing all night.” Langdon felt lost. “Bellamy hasn’t been communicating with this guy tonight! This guy doesn’t even know Bellamy is involved!” Sato turned to Bellamy and raised her eyebrows. Bellamy sighed. “Robert, I’m afraid I haven’t been entirely honest with you this evening.” Langdon cou ld only stare. “I thought I was doing the right thing . . .” Bellamy said, looking frightened. “Well,” Sato said, “ now you will do the right thing . . . and we’d all bet ter pray to God it works.” As if to substantiate Sato’s portentous tone, the mantel clo ck began chiming the hour. Sato took out a Ziploc b ag of items and tossed it to Bellamy. “Here’s your stuff. Does your cell phone take photos?” “Yes, ma’am.” “Good. Hold up the capstone.” The message Mal’akh had just received was from his contact—Warren Bellamy—the Mason he had sent to the Capitol Building earlier tonight to assist Robe rt Langdon. Bellamy, like Langdon, wanted Peter Sol omon back alive and had assured Mal’akh he would help La ngdon acquire and decipher the pyramid. All night, Mal’akh had been receiving e-mail updates, which ha d been automatically forwarded to his cell phone. This should be interesting, Mal’akh thought, opening the message. From: Warren Bellamy got separated from langdon "},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"but finally have info you demanded. proof attached. call for missing piece. —wb — one attachment (jpeg)— Call for missing piece? Mal’akh wondered, opening the attachment. The attachment was a photo. When Mal’ akh saw it, he gasped out loud, and he could feel h is heart start pounding with excitement. He was looking at a close-up of a tiny golden pyramid. The legendary capstone! The ornate engraving on the face carried a promising message: The secret hides within The Order. Beneath the inscription, Mal’akh now saw something that stunned him. The capstone seemed to be glowing . In disbelief, he stared at the faintly radiant text and realized that the legend was literally true: The Masonic Pyramid transforms itself to reveal its secret to t he worthy. How this magical transformation had occurred, Mal’a kh had no idea, and he didn’t care. The glowing tex t was clearly pointing to a specific location in D.C. , exactly as prophesied. Franklin Square. Unfortunately, the photo of the capstone also included Warren Bellamy’ s index finger, which was strategically positioned on the capstone to block out a critical piece of informati on. The secret hides within The Order Franklin Square Call for missing piece. Mal’akh now understood Bellamy’s meaning. The Architect of the Capitol had been cooperative a ll night, but now he had chosen to play a very dang erous game. CHAPTER 92 Beneath the watchful gaze of several armed CIA agents, Langdon , Katherine, and Bellamy waited with Sato in the Cathedral College sitting room. On the coffe e table before them, Langdon’s leather bag was stil l open, the golden capstone peeking out the top. The words Eight Franklin Square had now faded away, leaving no evidence that they had ever existed. Katherine had pleaded with Sato to let her go see h er brother, but Sato had simply shaken her head, ey es fixed on Bellamy’s cell phone. It sat on the coffee table and had yet to ring. Why didn’t Bellamy just tell me the truth? Langdon wondered. Apparently, the Architect had be en in contact with Peter ’ s captor all night, reassuring him that Langdon was making progress deciphering the pyramid. It"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"was a bluff, an attempt to buy time for Peter. In f act, Bellamy was doing all he could to interfere wi th anyone who threatened to unveil the pyramid’ s secret. Now, however, it seemed that Bellamy had switched sides. He and Sato were now prepared to risk the pyramid’s se cret in hopes of catching this man. “Take your hands off me!” shouted an elderly voice in the hall. “I’m blind, not inept! I know my way through the college!” Dean Galloway was still prote sting loudly as a CIA agent manhandled him into the sitting room and forced him into one of the chairs. “Who’s here?” Galloway demanded, his blank eyes sta ring dead ahead. “It sounds like a lot of you. How many do you need to detain an old man? Really now!” “There are seven of us,” Sato declared. “Including Robert Langdon, Katherine Solomon, and your Masonic brother Warren Bellamy.” Galloway slumped, all his bluster gone. “We’re okay,” Langdon said. “And we just heard that Peter is safe. He’ s in bad shape, but the police are with him.” “Thank heavens,” Galloway said. “And the—” A loud rattling caused everyone in the room to jump . It was Bellamy’ s cell phone vibrating against the coffee table. Everyone fell silent. “Okay, Mr. Bellamy,” Sato said. “Don’t blow it. You know the stakes.” Bellamy took a deep breath and exhaled. Then he rea ched down and pressed the speakerphone button to connect the call. “Bellamy here,” he said, speaking loudly toward the phone on the coffee table. The voice that crackled back through the speaker wa s familiar, an airy whisper. It sounded like he was calling from a hands-free speakerphone inside a car . “It’s past midnight, Mr. Bellamy. I was about to put Peter out of his misery.” There was an uneasy silence in the room. “Let me ta lk to him.” “Impossible,” the man replied. “We’re driving. He’s tied up in the trunk.” Langdon and Katherine exchanged looks and then bega n shaking their heads at everyone. He’s bluffing! He no longer has Peter! Sato motioned for Bellamy to keep pressing. “I want proof that Peter’s alive,” Bellamy said. “I’m not giving you the rest of—” “Your Worshipful Master needs a doctor. Don’t waste time with negotiations. Tell me the street number on Franklin Square, and I’ll bring Peter to you there. ” “I told you, I want—” “Now!” the man exploded. “Or I will pull over and P eter Solomon dies this instant!” “You listen to me,” Bellamy said forcefully. “If yo u want the rest of the address, you’ll play by my rules. Meet me at Franklin Square. Once you deliver Peter alive, I’ll tell you the number of the building.” “How do I know you won’t bring the authorities?” "},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"“ Because I can ’ t risk double - crossing you. Peter ’ s life is not the only card you hold. I know what ’ s really at stake tonight.” “You do realize,” the man on the phone said, “that if I sense so much as a hint of anyone other than you at Franklin Square, I will keep driving, and you will never find even a trace of Peter Solomon. And of co urse . . . that will be the least of your worries.” “I’ll come alone,” Bellamy replied somberly. “When y ou turn over Peter, I’ll give you everything you ne ed.” “Center of the square,” the man said. “It will take me at least twenty minutes to get there. I suggest you wait for me as long as it takes.” The line went dead. Instantly, the room sprang to life. Sato began shou ting orders. Several field agents grabbed their rad ios and headed for the door. “Move! Move!” In the chaos, Langdon looked to Bellamy for some ki nd of explanation as to what was actually going on tonight, but the older man was already being hurrie d out the door. “I need to see my brother!” Katherine shouted. “You have to let us go!” Sato walked over to Katherine. “I don’t have to do anything, Ms. Solomon. Is that clear?” Katherine stood her ground and looked desperately i nto Sato’s small eyes. “Ms. Solomon, my top priority is apprehending the m an at Franklin Square, and you will sit here with o ne of my men until I accomplish that task. Then, and only then, will we deal with your brother.” “You’re missing the point,” Katherine said. “I know exactly where this man lives! It’s literally five minutes up the road in Kalorama Heights, and there will be evidence there that will help you! Besides, you sai d you want to keep this quiet. Who knows what Peter will start telling the authorities once he’s stabilized. ” Sato pursed her lips, apparently registering Kather ine’ s point. Outside, the chopper blades began winding up. Sato frowned and then turned to one of her men. “Ha rtmann, you take the Escalade. Transport Ms. Solomo n and Mr. Langdon to Kalorama Heights. Peter Solomon is not to speak to anyone . Is that understood?” “Yes, ma’am,” the agent said. “Call me when you get there. Tell me what you find. And don’t let these two out of your sight.” Agent Hartmann gave a quick nod, pulled out the Esc alade keys, and headed for the door. Katherine was right behind him. Sato turned to Langdon. “I’ll see you shortly, Prof essor. I know you think I’m the enemy, but I can as sure you that’s not the case. Get to Peter at once. This isn’t over yet.” Off to one side of Langdon, Dean Galloway was sitti ng quietly at the coffee table. His hands had found the stone pyramid, which was still sitting in Langdon’s open leather bag on the table in front of him. The old man was running his hands over the stone’s warm sur face. Langdon said, “Father, are you coming to see Peter? ” “I’d just slow you down.” Galloway removed his hand s from the bag and zipped it up around the pyramid. “I’ll stay right here and pray for Peter’s recovery . We can all speak later. But when you show Peter t he pyramid, would you please tell him something for me ?” "},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"“ Of course. ” Langdon hoisted the bag onto his shoulder. “Tell him this.” Galloway cleared his throat. “The Masonic Pyramid has always kept her secret . . . sincerely .” “I don’t understand.” The old man winked. “Just tell Peter that. He will understand.” With that, Dean Galloway bowed his head and began p raying. Perplexed, Langdon left him there and hurried outsi de. Katherine was already in the front seat of the SUV giving the agent directions. Langdon climbed in bac k and had barely closed the door before the giant v ehicle was rocketing across the lawn, racing northward to Kalorama Heights. CHAPTER 93 Franklin Square is located in the northwest quadrant of downtown W ashington, bordered by K and Thirteenth streets. It is home to many historic bui ldings, most notably the Franklin School, from whic h Alexander Graham Bell sent the world’s first wirele ss message in 1880. High above the square, a fast-moving UH-60 helicopt er approached from the west, having completed its journey from the National Cathedral in a matter of minutes. Plenty of time, Sato thought, peering down at the square below. She knew it was critical that her men got into position undetected before their target a rrived. He said he wouldn ’t be here for at least twenty minutes. On Sato’s command, the pilot performed a “touch-hov er” on the roof of the tallest building around—the renowned One Franklin Square—a towering and prestig ious office building with two gold spires on top. T he maneuver was illegal, of course, but the chopper wa s there only a few seconds, and its skids barely to uched the gravel rooftop. Once everyone had jumped out, t he pilot immediately lifted off, banking to the eas t, where he would climb to “silent altitude” and provi de invisible support from above. Sato waited as her field team collected their thing s and prepared Bellamy for his task. The Architect was still looking dazed from having seen the file on Sato’s s ecure laptop. As I said . . . an issue of national security. Bellamy had quickly understood Sato’s meaning and w as now fully cooperative. “All set, ma’am,” Agent Simkins said. On Sato’s command, the agents ushered Bellamy acros s the rooftop and disappeared down a stairwell, heading for ground level to take up their positions . Sato walked to the edge of the building and gazed d own. The rectangular wooded park below filled the e ntire block. Plenty of cover. Sato’s team fully understood the importance of mak ing an undetected intercept. If their target sensed a presence here and decided jus t to slip away . . . the director didn’t even want to think about it. The wind up here was gusty and cold. Sato wrapped h er arms around herself, and planted her feet firmly to avoid getting blown over the edge. From this high v antage point, Franklin Square looked smaller than s he recalled, with fewer buildings. She wondered which building was Eight Franklin Square. This was information she had requested from her analyst Nola , from whom she expected word at any moment. "},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Bellamy and the agents now appeared, looking like a nts fanning out into the darkness of the wooded are a. Simkins positioned Bellamy in a clearing near the c enter of the deserted park. Then Simkins and his te am melted into the natural cover, disappearing from vi ew. Within seconds, Bellamy was alone, pacing and shivering in the light of a streetlamp near the cen ter of the park. Sato felt no pity. She lit a cigarette and took a long drag, savoring the warmth as it permeated her lungs. Satisfied tha t everything below was in order, she stepped back fro m the edge to await her two phone calls—one from he r analyst Nola and one from Agent Hartmann, whom she had sent to Kalorama Heights. CHAPTER 94 Slow down! Langdon gripped the backseat of the Escalade as it flew around a corner, threatening to tip up on two tires. CIA agent Hartmann was either eager to s how off his driving skills to Katherine, or he had orders to get to Peter Solomon before Solomon recuperated enough to say anything he shouldn’t say to the loca l authorities. The high-speed game of beat-the-red- light on Embassy Row had been worrisome enough, but now they were racing through the winding residential neighborhood of Kalorama Heights. Katherine shouted directions as they went, having been to this man’s house earlier that afternoon. With every turn, the leather bag at Langdon’s feet rocked back and forth, and Langdon could hear the c lank of the capstone, which had clearly been jarred from the top of the pyramid and was now bouncing around in the bottom of his bag. Fearing it might get damaged , he fished around inside until he found it. It was still warm, but the glowing text had now faded and disapp eared, returning to its original engraving: The secret hides within The Order. As Langdon was about to place the capstone in a sid e pocket, he noticed its elegant surface was covere d with tiny white gobs of something. Puzzled, he tried to wipe them off, but they were stuck on and hard to t he touch . . . like plastic. What in the world? He could now see that the surface of the stone pyr amid itself was also covered with the little white dots. Langdon us ed his fingernail and picked one off, rolling it be tween his fingers. “Wax?” he blurted. Katherine glanced over her shoulder. “What?” “There are bits of wax all over the pyramid and cap stone. I don’t understand it. Where could that poss ibly have come from?” “Something in your bag, maybe?” “I don’t think so.” As they rounded a corner, Katherine pointed through the windshield and turned to Agent Hartmann. “That ’s it! We’re here.” Langdon glanced up and saw the spinning lights of a security vehicle parked in a driveway up ahead. Th e driveway gate was pulled aside and the agent gunned the SUV inside the compound."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" The house was a spectacular mansion. Every light in side was ablaze, and the front door was wide open. A half- dozen vehicles were parked haphazardly in the drive way and on the lawn, apparently having arrived in a hurry. Some of the cars were still running and had their headlights shining, most on the house, but on e askew, practically blinding them as they drove in. Agent Hartmann skidded to a stop on the lawn beside a white sedan with a brightly colored decal: PREFERRED SECURITY . The spinning lights and the high beams in their f ace made it hard to see. Katherine immediately jumped out and raced for the house. Langdon heaved his bag onto his shoulder without taking the time to zip it up. He followed K atherine at a jog across the lawn toward the open f ront door. The sounds of voices echoed within. Behind La ngdon, the SUV chirped as Agent Hartmann locked the vehicle and hurried after them. Katherine bounded up the porch stairs, through the main door, and disappeared into the entryway. Langd on crossed the threshold behind her and could see Kath erine was already moving across the foyer and down the main hallway toward the sound of voices. Beyond her , visible at the end of the hall, was a dining-room table where a woman in a security uniform was sitting wit h her back to them. “Officer!” Katherine shouted as she ran. “Where is Peter Solomon?” Langdon rushed after her, but as he did so, an unex pected movement caught his eye. To his left, throug h the living-room window, he could see the driveway gate was now swinging shut. Odd . Something else caught his eye . . . something that had been hidden from him b y the glare of the spinning lights and the blinding high beams when they drove in. The half-dozen cars parke d haphazardly in the driveway looked nothing like t he police cars and emergency vehicles Langdon had imag ined they were. A Mercedes? . . . a Hummer? . . . a Tesla Roadster? In that instant, Langdon also realized the voices h e heard in the house were nothing but a television blaring in the direction of the dining room. Wheeling in slow motion, Langdon shouted down the h allway. “Katherine, wait!” But as he turned, he could see that Katherine Solom on was no longer running. She was airborne. CHAPTER 95 Katherine Solomon knew she was falling . . . but she couldn’t figure out why. She had been running down the hall toward the secur ity guard in the dining room when suddenly her feet had become entangled in an invisible obstacle, and her entire body had lurched forward, sailing through th e air. Now she was returning to earth . . . in this case, a hardwood floor. Katherine crashed down on her stomach, the wind dri ven violently from her lungs. Above her, a heavy co at tree teetered precariously and then toppled over, b arely missing her on the floor. She raised her head , still gasping for breath, puzzled to see that the female security guard in the chair had not moved a muscle. Stranger still, the toppled coat tree appeared to h ave a thin wire attached to the bottom, which had b een"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"stretched across the hallway. Why in the world would someone . . . ? “Katherine!” Langdon was shouting to her, and as Katherine rolle d onto her side and looked back at him, she felt her blood turn to ice. Robert! Behind you! She tried to scream, but she was still gasping for breath. All she could do was watch in terrifying slow motion as Langdon rushed down the hall to help her, complete ly unaware that behind him, Agent Hartmann was stagger ing across the threshold and clutching his throat. Blood sprayed through Hartmann’s hands as he groped at the handle of a long screwdriver that protruded from his neck. As the agent pitched forward, his attacker came int o full view. My God . . . no! Naked except for a strange undergarment that looked like a loincloth, the massive man had apparently b een hiding in the foyer. His muscular body was covered from head to toe with strange tattoos. The front do or was swinging closed, and he was rushing down the hall a fter Langdon. Agent Hartmann hit the floor just as the front door slammed shut. Langdon looked startled and whirled around, but the tattooed man was already on him, th rusting some kind of device into his back. There wa s a flash of light and a sharp electrical sizzle, and K atherine saw Langdon go rigid. Eyes frozen wide, La ngdon lurched forward, collapsing down in a paralyzed hea p. He fell hard on top of his leather bag, the pyra mid tumbling out onto the floor. Without so much as a glance down at his victim, the tattooed man stepped over Langdon and headed direc tly for Katherine. She was already crawling backward in to the dining room, where she collided with a chair . The female security guard, who had been propped in that chair, now wobbled and dropped to the floor in a h eap beside her. The woman’s lifeless expression was one of terror. Her mouth was stuffed with a rag. The enormous man had reached her before Katherine h ad time to react. He seized her by the shoulders wi th impossible strength. His face, no longer covered by makeup, was an utterly terrifying sight. His muscl es flexed, and she felt herself being flipped over ont o her stomach like a rag doll. A heavy knee ground into her back, and for a moment, she thought she would break in two. He grabbed her arms and pulled them backward. With her head now turned to one side and her cheek pressed into the carpet, Katherine could see Langdo n, his body still jerking, facing away from her. Beyon d that, Agent Hartmann lay motionless in the foyer. Cold metal pinched Katherine’ s wrists, and she realized she was being bound with wire. In terror, she tried to pull away, but doing so sent searing pain into her hands. “This wire will cut you if you move,” the man said, finishing with her wrists and moving down to her ankles with frightening efficiency. Katherine kicked at him, and he threw a powerful fi st into the back of her right thigh, crippling her leg. Within seconds, her ankles were bound. “Robert!” she now managed to call out. Langdon was groaning on the floor in the hallway. H e lay crumpled on his leather bag with the stone pyramid lying on its side near his head. Katherine realized the pyramid was her last hope. “We deciphered the pyramid!” she told her attacker. “I’ll tell you everything!” “Yes, you will.” With that, he pulled the cloth fro m the dead woman’s mouth and firmly stuffed it into Katherine’s. "},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"It tasted like death. Robert Langdon’s body was not his own. He lay, numb and immobile, his cheek pressed against the hardwood floor. He had heard enough about stun guns to know they crippled their victims by temporarily overloading the nervous system. Their action—someth ing called electromuscular disruption—might as well have been a bolt of lightning. The excruciating jol t of pain seemed to penetrate every molecule of his body. Now, despite his mind ’s focused intention, his muscles refused to obey t he command he was sending them. Get up! Facedown, paralyzed on the floor, Langdon was gulpi ng shallow breaths, scarcely able to inhale. He had yet to lay eyes on the man who had attacked him, but he could see Agent Hartmann lying in an expanding poo l of blood. Langdon had heard Katherine struggling an d arguing, but moments ago her voice had become muffled, as if the man had stuffed something in her mouth. Get up, Robert! You’ve got to help her! Langdon’s legs were tingling now, a fiery and painf ul recovery of feeling, but still they refused to c ooperate. Move! His arms twitched as sensation started to come bac k, along with feeling in his face and neck. With great effort, he managed to rotate his head, draggi ng his cheek roughly across the hardwood floor as h e turned his head to look down into the dining room. Langdon’s sight line was impeded—by the stone pyram id, which had toppled out of his bag and was lying sideways on the floor, its base inches from his fac e. For an instant, Langdon didn’t understand what he w as looking at. The square of stone before him was obviously the base of the pyramid, and yet it looke d somehow different. Very different. It was still s quare, and still stone . . . but it was no longer flat and smooth. The base of the pyramid was covered with e ngraved markings. How is this possible? He stared for several seconds, wondering if he was hallucinating. I looked at the base of this pyramid a dozen times . . . and th ere were no markings! Langdon now realized why. His breathing reflex kick-started, and he drew a su dden gasp of air, realizing that the Masonic Pyrami d had secrets yet to share. I have witnessed another transformation. In a flash, Langdon understood the meaning of Gallo way’s last request. Tell Peter this: The Masonic Pyramid has always kept her secret . . . sincerely. The words had seemed strange at the time, but now Langdon understood that Dean Galloway was sending P eter a code. Ironically, this same code had been a plot twist in a mediocre thriller Langdon had read years ago. Sin-cere. Since the days of Michelangelo, sculptors had been hiding the flaws in their work by smearing hot wax into the cracks and then dabbing the wax with stone dust. The method wa s considered cheating, and therefore, any sculpture “ without wax”—literally sine cera —was considered a “sincere” piece of art. The phrase stuck. To this d ay we still sign our letters “sincerely” as a promi se that we have written “without wax” and that our words are t rue. The engravings on the base of this pyramid had been concealed by the same method. When Katherine followed the capstone’s directions and boiled the pyramid, the wax melted away, revealing the wr iting on the base. Galloway had run his hands over the pyramid i n the sitting room, apparently feeling the markings exposed on the bottom. Now, if only for an instant, Langdon had forgotten all the danger he and Katherine faced. He stared at the incredible array of symbols on the base of the pyra mid. He had no idea what they meant . . . or what t hey would ultimately reveal, but one thing was for cert ain. The Masonic Pyramid has secrets left to tell. Eight Franklin Square is not the final answer."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":" Whether it was this adrenaline-filled revelation or simply the extra few seconds lying there, Langdon did not know, but he suddenly felt control returning to his body. Painfully, he swept an arm to one side, pushing the leather bag out of the way to clear his sight line into the dining room. To his horror, he saw that Katherine had been tied up, and a large rag had been stuffed deep into her mouth. Langdon flexed his muscles, trying to climb to his knees, but a moment later, he froze in utter disbel ief. The dining-room doorway had just filled with a chilling sight—a human form unlike anything Langdon had eve r seen. What in the name of God . . . ?! Langdon rolled, kicking with his legs, trying to ba ck away, but the huge tattooed man grabbed him, fli pping him onto his back and straddling his chest. He plac ed his knees on Langdon’s biceps, pinning Langdon p ain fully to the floor. The man’s chest bore a rippling double-headed phoenix. His neck, face, and shaved head were covered with a dazzling array of unusually int ricate symbols—sigils, Langdon knew— which were used in the rituals of dark ceremonial magic. Before Langdon could process anything more, the hug e man clasped Langdon’s ears between his palms, lifted his head up off the floor, and, with incredi ble force, smashed it back down onto the hardwood. Everything went black. CHAPTER 96 Mal’akh stood in his hallway and surveyed the carnage around him . His home looked like a battlefield. Robert Langdon lay unconscious at his feet. Katherine Solomon was bound and gagged on the dinin g-room floor. The corpse of a female security guard lay crumpled nearby, having toppled off the chair where she was propped. This female guard, eager to save her own l ife, had done exactly as Mal’akh commanded. With a knife to her throat, she had answered Mal’akh’s cel l phone and told the lie that had coaxed Langdon an d Katherine to come racing out here. She had no partner, and Peter Solomon was certainly not okay. As soon as the woman had given her performance, Mal’akh had quietly strangled her. To complete the illusion that Mal’akh was not home, he had phoned Bellamy using the hands-free speaker in one of his cars. I’m on the road, he had told Bellamy and whoever else had been list ening. Peter is in my trunk. In fact, Mal’akh was driving only between his gara ge and his front yard, where he had left several of his myriad cars parked askew with the headlights on and the engines running. The deception had worked perfectly. Almost. The only wrinkle was the bloody black-clad heap in the foyer with a screwdriver protruding from his ne ck. Mal’akh searched the corpse and had to chuckle when he found a high-tech transceiver and cell phone wi th a CIA logo. It seems even they are aware of my power. He removed the batteries and crushed both devices"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"with a heavy bronze doorstop. Mal’akh knew he had to move quickly now, especially if the CIA was involved. He strode back over to Langdon. The professor was out cold and would be fo r a while. Mal’akh’s eyes moved with trepidation no w to the stone pyramid on the floor beside the profes sor’s open bag. His breath caught, and his heart po unded. I have waited for years . . . His hands trembled slightly as he reached down and picked up the Masonic Pyramid. As he ran his finger s slowly across the engravings, he felt awed by their promise. Before he became too entranced, he put th e pyramid back in Langdon’s bag with the capstone and zipped it up. I will assemble the pyramid soon . . . in a much sa fer location. He threw Langdon’s bag over his shoulder and then t ried to hoist Langdon himself, but the professor’s toned physique weighed much more than anticipated. Mal’ak h settled on grabbing him beneath the armpits and dragging him across the floor. He’s not going to like where he ends up, Mal’akh thought. As he dragged Langdon off, the television in the ki tchen blared. The sound of voices from the TV had b een part of the deception, and Mal’akh had yet to turn it off. The station was now broadcasting a televang elist leading his congregation in the Lord’s Prayer. Mal’ akh wondered if any of his hypnotized viewers had a ny idea where this prayer really came from. “ . . . On earth as it is in heaven . . .” the grou p intoned. Yes, Mal’akh thought. As above, so below. “ . . . And lead us not into temptation . . .” Help us master the weakness of our flesh. “ . . . Deliver us from evil . . .” they all beseec hed. Mal’akh smiled. That could be difficult. The darkness is growing. Even so, he had to give them credit for trying. Humans who spoke to invisible forces and re quested help were a dying breed in this modern worl d. Mal’akh was dragging Langdon across the living room when the congregation declared, “Amen!” Amon, Mal’akh corrected. Egypt is the cradle of your religion. The god Amon was the prototype for Zeus . . . for Jupiter . . . and for every modern face of God. To this day, every religion on earth shouted out a variation of his name. Amen! Amin! Aum! The televangelist began quoting verses from the Bib le describing hierarchies of angels, demons, and sp irits that ruled in heaven and hell. “Protect your souls from evil forces!” he warned them. “Lift your heart s in prayer! God and his angels will hear you!” He ’s right, Mal’akh knew. But so will the demons. Mal’akh had learned long ago that through proper ap plication of the Art, a practitioner could open a p ortal to the spiritual realm. The invisible forces that exis ted there, much like man himself, came in many form s, both good and evil. Those of Light healed, protected, an d sought to bring order to the universe. Those of D ark functioned oppositely . . . bringing destruction an d chaos. If properly summoned, the invisible forces could be persuaded to do a practitioner’ s bidding on earth . . . thus instilling him with seemingly supernatural power. I n exchange for helping the summoner, these forces required offerings—prayers and praise for those of Light . . . and the spilling of blood for those of Dark. The greater the sacrifice, the greater the power th at is transferred. Mal ’ akh had begun his practice with the"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"blood of inconsequential animals. Over time, howeve r, his choices for sacrifice had become more bold. Tonight, I take the final step. “Beware!” the preacher shouted, warning of the comi ng Apocalypse. “The final battle for the souls of m an will soon be fought!” Indeed, Mal’akh thought. And I shall become its greatest warrior. This battle, of course, had begun long, long ago. I n ancient Egypt, those who perfected the Art had be come the great Adepts of history, evolving beyond the ma sses to become true practitioners of Light. They mo ved as gods on earth. They built great temples of initi ation to which neophytes traveled from around the w orld to partake of the wisdom. There arose a race of golden men. For a brief span of time, mankind seemed pois ed to elevate himself and transcend his earthly bonds. The golden age of the Ancient Mysteries. And yet man, being of the flesh, was susceptible to the sins of hubris, hatred, impatience, and greed. Over time, there were those who corrupted the Art, perve rting it and abusing its power for personal gain. T hey began using this perverted version to summon dark f orces. A different Art evolved . . . a more potent, immediate, and intoxicating influence. Such is my Art. Such is my Great Work. The illuminated Adepts and their esoteric fraternit ies witnessed the rising evil and saw that man was not using his newfound knowledge for the good of his sp ecies. And so they hid their wisdom to keep it from the eyes of the unworthy. Eventually, it was lost to hi story. With this came the Great Fall of Man. And a lasting darkness. To this day, the noble descendants of the Adepts so ldiered on, grasping blindly for the Light, trying to recapture the lost power of their past, trying to k eep the darkness at bay. They were the priests and priestesses of the churches, temples, and shrines o f all the religions on earth. Time had erased the m emories . . . detached them from their past. They no longer k new the Source from which their potent wisdom had o nce flowed. When they were asked about the divine myste ries of their forebears, the new custodians of fait h vociferously disowned them, condemning them as here sy. Have they truly forgotten ? Mal’akh wondered. Echoes of the ancient Art still resonated in every corner of the globe, from the mystical Kabbalists o f Judaism to the esoteric Sufis of Islam. Vestiges re mained in the arcane rituals of Christianity, in it s god- eating rites of Holy Communion, its hierarchies of saints, angels, and demons, its chanting and incant ation, its holy calendar’s astrological underpinnings, its consecrated robes, and in its promise of everlasti ng life. Even now, its priests dispelled evil spirits by swi nging smoke-filled censers, ringing sacred bells, a nd sprinkling holy water. Christians still practiced t he supernatural craft of exorcism—an early practice of their faith that required the ability not only to cast ou t demons but to summon them. And yet they cannot see their past? Nowhere was the church ’s mystical past more evident than at her epicenter . In Vatican City, at the heart of St. Peter’s Square, stood the great Egyptian obelis k. Carved thirteen hundred years before Jesus took his first breath— this numinous monolith had no relevance there, no l ink to modern Christianity. And yet there it was. At the core of Christ’s church. A stone beacon, scr eaming to be heard. A reminder to those few sages w ho remembered where it all began. This church, born of the womb of the Ancient Mysteries, still bore her rites and symbols."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":" One symbol above all. Adorning her altars, vestments, spires, and Scriptu re was the singular image of Christianity—that of a precious, sacrificed human being. Christianity, mor e than any other faith, understood the transformati ve power of sacrifice. Even now, to honor the sacrific e made by Jesus, his followers proffered their own feeble gestures of personal sacrifice . . . fasting, Lente n renunciation, tithing. All of those offerings are impotent, of course. Wit hout blood . . . there is no true sacrifice. The powers of darkness had long embraced blood sacr ifice, and in doing so, they had grown so strong th at the powers of goodness now struggled to keep them i n check. Soon the Light would be entirely consumed, and the practitioners of darkness would move freely through the minds of men. CHAPTER 97 “Eight Franklin Square must exist,” Sato insisted. “Look it up again!” Nola Kaye sat at her desk and adjusted her headset. “Ma’am, I’ve checked everywhere . . . that address doesn’t exist in D.C.” “But I’m on the roof of One Franklin Square,” Sato said. “There has to be an Eight !” Director Sato ’s on a roof? “Hold on.” Nola began running a new search. She wa s considering telling the OS director about the hacker, but Sato seemed fixated on Eight Franklin Square at the moment. Besides, No la still didn’t have all the information. Where’s that damned sys-sec, anyway? “Okay,” Nola said, eyeing her screen, “I see the pr oblem. One Franklin Square is the name of the building . . . not the address. The address is actually 1301 K S treet.” The news seemed to confound the director. “Nola, I don’t have time to explain—the pyramid clearly poin ts to the address Eight Franklin Square.” Nola sat bolt upright. The pyramid points to a specific location? “The inscription,” Sato continued, “reads: ‘The sec ret hides within The Order—Eight Franklin Square.’” Nola could scarcely imagine. “An order like . . . a Masonic or fraternal order?” “I assume so,” Sato replied. Nola thought a moment, and then began typing again. “Ma’am, maybe the street numbers on the square changed over the years? I mean, if this pyramid is as old as legend claims, maybe the numbers on Frank lin Square were different when the pyramid was built? I ’m now running a search without the number eight . . . for . . . ‘the order’ . . . ‘Franklin Square’ . . . and ‘Washington, D.C.’ . . . and this way, we might get some idea if there’s—” She stalled midsentence as the se arch results appeared. “What have you got?” Sato demanded. Nola stared at the first result on the list —a spectacular image of the Great Pyramid of Egypt— which served as the thematic backdrop for the"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"home page dedicated to a building on Franklin Squar e. The building was unlike any other building on th e square. Or in the entire city, for that matter. What stopped Nola cold was not the building’s bizar re architecture, but rather the description of its purpose . According to the Web site, this unusual edifice was built as a sacred mystical shrine, designed by . . . and designed for . . . an ancient secret order. CHAPTER 98 Robert Langdon regained consciousness with a crippling headache. Where am I? Wherever he was, it was dark. Deep-cave dark, and d eathly silent. He was lying on his back with his arms at his side. Confused, he tried moving his fingers and toes, re lieved to find they moved freely with no pain. What happened? With the exception of his headache and the profoun d darkness, everything seemed more or less normal. Almost everything. Langdon realized he was lying on a hard floor that felt unusually smooth, like a sheet of glass. Stran ger still, he could feel that the slick surface was in direct contact with his bare flesh . . . shoulders, back, buttocks, thighs, calves. Am I naked? Puzzled, he ran his hands over his body. Jesus! Where the hell are my clothes? In the darkness, the cobwebs began to lift, and Lan gdon saw flashes of memory . . . frightening snapsh ots . . . a dead CIA agent . . . the face of a tattooed beast . . . Langdon’s head smashing into the floor. The images came faster . . . and now he recalled the sickening image of Katherine Solomon bound and gagged on the dining-room floor. My God! Langdon sat bolt upright, and as he did, his forehe ad smashed into something suspended only inches abo ve him. Pain exploded through his skull and he fell ba ck, teetering near unconsciousness. Groggy, he reac hed up with his hands, groping in the darkness to find the obstacle. What he found made no sense to him. It s eemed this room’s ceiling was less than a foot above him. What in the world? As he spread his arms to his sides in an attempt to roll over, both of his hands hit side walls. The truth now dawned on him. Robert Langdon was not in a room at all. I ’m in a box! In the darkness of his small, coffinlike container, Langdon began pounding wildly with his fist. He sh outed over and over for help. The terror that gripped him deepened with each passing instant until it was intolerable. I have been buried alive."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":" The lid of Langdon’s strange coffin refused to budg e, even with the full force of his arms and legs pu shing upward in wild panic. The box, from all he could te ll, was made of heavy fiberglass. Airtight. Soundpr oof. Lightproof. Escape-proof. I am going to suffocate alone in this box. He thought of the deep well into which he had falle n as a young boy, and of the terrifying night he sp ent treading water alone in the darkness of a bottomles s pit. That trauma had scarred Langdon’s psyche, burdening him with an overwhelming phobia of enclos ed spaces. Tonight, buried alive, Robert Langdon was living hi s ultimate nightmare. Katherine Solomon trembled in silence on the floor of Mal’akh’s dining room. The sharp wire around her wrists and ankles had already cut into her, and the slightest movements seemed only to tighten her bon ds. The tattooed man had brutally knocked Langdon uncon scious and dragged his limp body across the floor along with his leather bag and the stone pyramid. W here they had gone, Katherine had no idea. The agen t who had accompanied them was dead. She had not hear d a sound in many minutes, and she wondered if the tattooed man and Langdon were still inside the hous e. She had been trying to scream for help, but with each attempt, the rag in her mouth crept back dangerousl y closer to her windpipe. Now she felt approaching footsteps on the floor, an d she turned her head, hoping against hope that som eone was coming to help. The massive silhouette of her c aptor materialized in the hallway. Katherine recoil ed as she flashed on the image of him standing in her fam ily home ten years earlier. He killed my family. Now he strode toward her. Langdon was nowhere to be seen. The man crouched down and gripped her around the waist, hoisting her roughly onto his sho ulder. The wire sliced into her wrists, and the rag muffled her muted cries of pain. He carried her down the ha llway toward the living room, where, earlier today, the two of them had calmly sipped tea together. Where is he taking me?! He carried Katherine across the living room and sto pped directly in front of the large oil painting of the Three Graces that she had admired this afternoon. “You mentioned you liked this painting,” the man wh ispered, his lips practically touching her ear. “I’m glad. It may be the last thing of beauty you see.” With that, he reached out and pressed his palm into the right side of the enormous frame. To Katherine ’s shock, the painting rotated into the wall, turning on a central pivot like a revolving door. A hidden doorway. Katherine tried to wriggle free, but the man held h er firmly, carrying her through the opening behind the canvas. As the Three Graces pivoted shut behind the m, she could see heavy insulation on the back of th e canvas. Whatever sounds were made back here were ap parently not meant to be heard by the outside world . The space behind the painting was cramped, more lik e a hallway than a room. The man carried her to the far side and opened a heavy door, carrying her through it onto a small landing. Katherine found herself lo oking down a narrow ramp into a deep basement. She drew a breath to scream, but the rag was choking her. The incline was steep and narrow. The walls on eith er side were made of cement, awash in a bluish ligh t that seemed to emanate from below. The air that wafted u p was warm and pungent, laden with an eerie blend o f smells . . . the sharp bite of chemicals, the smoot h calm of incense, the earthy musk of human sweat, and, pervading it all, a distinct aura of visceral, anim al fear. “ Your science impressed me, ” the man whispered as they reached the bottom of the ramp. “ I hope mine"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"impresses you. ” CHAPTER 99 CIA field agent Turner Simkins crouched in the darkness of Frankli n Park and kept his steady gaze on Warren Bellamy . Nobody had taken the bait yet, but it was still ea rly. Simkins’s transceiver beeped, and he activated it, hoping one of his men had spotted something. But it was Sato. She had new information. Simkins listened and agreed with her concern. “Hold on,” he said. “I’ll see if I can get a visual.” He crawled through the bushes in which he was hiding and peere d back in the direction from which he had entered t he square. After some maneuvering, he finally opened a sight line. Holy shit. He was staring at a building that looked like an Ol d World mosque. Nestled between two much larger buildings, the Moorish facade was made of gleaming terra-cotta tile laid in intricate multicolored des igns. Above the three massive doors, two tiers of lancet windows looked as if Arabian archers might appear a nd open fire if anyone approached uninvited. “I see it,” Simkins said. “Any activity?” “Nothing.” “Good. I need you to reposition and watch it very c arefully. It’s called the Almas Shrine Temple, and it’s the headquarters of a mystical order.” Simkins had worked in the D.C. area for a long time but was not familiar with this temple or any ancie nt mystical order headquartered on Franklin Square. “This building,” Sato said, “belongs to a group cal led the Ancient Arabic Order of Nobles of the Mysti c Shrine.” “Never heard of them.” “I think you have, ” Sato said. “They’re an appendant body of the Maso ns, more commonly known as the Shriners.” Simkins shot a dubious glance at the ornate buildin g. The Shriners? The guys who build hospitals for kids ? He could imagine no “order” less ominous sounding th an a fraternity of philanthropists who wore little red fezzes and marched in parades. Even so, Sato’s concerns were valid. “Ma’am, if our target realizes that this building is in fact ‘The Order’ on Franklin Square, he won’t need the address. He’ ll simply bypass the rendezvous and go directly to the correct location.” “My thoughts exactly. Keep an eye on the entrance.” "},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"“ Yes, ma ’ am. ” “Any word from Agent Hartmann in Kalorama Heights?” “No, ma’am. You asked him to phone you directly.” “Well, he hasn’t.” Odd, Simkins thought, checking his watch. He’s overdue. CHAPTER 100 Robert Langdon lay shivering, naked and alone in total blackness. Paralyzed by fear, he was no longer pounding or shouting. Instead, he had closed his ey es and was doing his best to control his hammering heart and his panicked breathing. You are lying beneath a vast, nighttime sky, he tried to convince himself. There is nothing above you but miles of wide-open space. This calming visualization had been the only way he had managed to survive a recent stint in an enclos ed MRI machine . . . that and a triple dose of Valium. Tonight, however, the visualization was having no effect whatsoever. The rag in Katherine Solomon’s mouth had shifted ba ckward and was all but choking her. Her captor had carried her down a narrow ramp and into a dark base ment corridor. At the far end of the hall, she had glimpsed a room lit with an eerie reddish-purple li ght, but they’ d never made it that far. The man had stopped instead at a small side room, carried her inside, a nd placed her on a wooden chair. He had set her dow n with her bound wrists behind the chair back so she could not move. Now Katherine could feel the wire on her wrists sli cing deeper into her flesh. The pain barely registe red next to the rising panic she was feeling over being unab le to breathe. The cloth in her mouth was slipping deeper into her throat, and she felt herself gagging refle xively. Her vision started to tunnel. Behind her, the tattooed man closed the room’s lone door and flipped on the light. Katherine’s eyes we re watering profusely now, and she could no longer dif ferentiate objects in her immediate surroundings. Everything had become a blur. A distorted vision of colorful flesh appeared befor e her, and Katherine felt her eyes starting to flut ter as she teetered on the brink of unconsciousness. A scale-c overed arm reached out and yanked the rag from her mouth. Katherine gasped, inhaling deep breaths, coughing a nd choking as her lungs flooded with precious air. Slowly, her vision began to clear, and she found he rself looking into the demon’ s face. The visage was barely human. Blanketing his neck, face, and shaved head w as an astounding pattern of bizarre tattooed symbol s. With the exception of a small circle on top of his head, every inch of his body appeared to be decorat ed. A massive double-headed phoenix on his chest glared a t her through nipple eyes like some kind of ravenou s vulture, patiently waiting for her death. “Open your mouth,” the man whispered. Katherine stared at the monster with total revulsio n. What?"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":" “Open your mouth,” the man repeated. “Or the cloth goes back in.” Trembling, Katherine opened her mouth. The man exte nded his thick, tattooed index finger, inserting it between her lips. When he touched her tongue, Kathe rine thought she would vomit. He extracted his wet finger and raised it to the top of his shaved head. Closing his eyes, he massaged her saliva into his small circular patch of untattooed flesh. Repulsed, Katherine looked away. The room in which she was sitting appeared to be a boiler room of some sort—pipes on the walls, gurgli ng sounds, fluorescent lights. Before she could take i n her surroundings, though, her gaze stopped dead o n something beside her on the floor. A pile of clothi ng—turtleneck, tweed sport coat, loafers, Mickey Mo use watch. “My God!” She wheeled back to the tattooed animal b efore her. “What have you done with Robert?!” “Shh,” the man whispered. “Or he’ll hear you.” He s tepped to one side and motioned behind him. Langdon was not there. All Katherine saw was a huge black fiberglass box. Its shape bore an unsettling resemblance to the heavy crates in which corpses we re shipped back from war. Two massive clasps firmly locked the box shut. “He’s inside ?!” Katherine blurted. “But . . . he’ll suffocate!” “No, he won’t,” the man said, pointing to a series of transparent pipes that ran along the wall into t he bottom of the crate. “He’ll only wish he could.” In total darkness, Langdon listened intently to the muffled vibrations he now heard from the outside w orld. Voices? He began pounding on the box and shouting at the t op of his lungs. “Help! Can anyone hear me?!” Far off, a muted voice called out. “Robert! My God, no! NO!” He knew the voice. It was Katherine, and she sounde d terrified. Even so, it was a welcome sound. Langd on drew a breath to call out to her, but he stopped sh ort, feeling an unexpected sensation at the back of his neck. A faint breeze seemed to be emanating from the bott om of the box. How is that possible? He lay very still, taking stock. Yes, definitely. He could feel the tiny hairs on the back of his ne ck being tickled by air movement. Instinctively, Langdon began feeling along the floo r of the box, searching for the source of the air. It took only a moment to locate. There’s a tiny vent! The small perforated opening felt similar to a dra in plate on a sink or tub, except that a soft, steady breeze was now coming up through it. He ’s pumping air in for me. He doesn’t want me to suf focate. Langdon’s relief was short-lived. A terrifying soun d was now emanating up through the holes in the ven t. It was the unmistakable gurgle of flowing liquid . . . coming his way. Katherine stared in disbelief at the clear shaft of liquid that was progressing down one of the pipes toward Langdon’s crate. The scene looked like some kind of twisted stage magician’s act. He ’s pumping water into the crate?! Katherine strained at her bonds, ignoring the deep bite of the wires around her wrists. All she could do was look on in panic. She could hear Langdon pounding i n desperation, but as the water reached the undersi de of the container, the pounding stopped. There was a mo ment of terrified silence. Then the pounding starte d again with renewed desperation. "},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"“ Let him out! ” Katherine begged. “ Please! You can ’ t do this! ” “Drowning is a terrible death, you know.” The man s poke calmly as he paced around her in circles. “You r assistant, Trish, could tell you that.” Katherine heard his words, but she could barely pro cess them. “You may remember that I almost drowned once,” the m an whispered. “It was on your family’s estate in Potomac. Your brother shot me, and I fell through t he ice, out at Zach’s bridge.” Katherine glared at him, filled with loathing. The night you killed my mother. “The gods protected me that night,” he said. “And t hey showed me the way . . . to become one of them.” The water gurgling into the box behind Langdon’s he ad felt warm . . . body temperature. The fluid was already several inches deep and had completely swallowed the back of his naked body. As it began creeping up his rib cage, Langdon felt a stark reality closing in fast. I ’m going to die. With renewed panic, he raised his arms and began po unding wildly again. CHAPTER 101 “You’ve got to let him out!” Katherine begged, crying now. “We’ll do whatever you want!” She could hear Langdon pounding more frantically as the water flow ed into his container. The tattooed man just smiled. “You’re easier than y our brother. The things I had to do to get Peter to tell me his secrets . . .” “Where is he?!” she demanded. “Where is Peter?! Tel l me! We did exactly what you wanted! We solved the pyramid and—” “No, you did not solve the pyramid. You played a game. You withheld information and brought a government agent to my home. Hardly behavior I inte nd to reward.” “We didn’t have a choice,” she replied, choking bac k the tears. “The CIA is looking for you. They made us travel with an agent. I’ll tell you everything. Jus t let Robert out!” Katherine could hear Langdon shouting and pounding in the crate, and she could see the water flowing through the pipe. She knew he didn’t have a lot of time. In front of her, the tattooed man spoke calmly, str oking his chin. “I assume there are agents waiting for me at Franklin Square?” Katherine said nothing, and the man placed his mass ive palms on her shoulders, slowly pulling her forw ard. With her arms still wire-bound be hind the chair ba ck, her shoulders strained, burning with pain, thre atening to dislocate. “Yes!” Katherine said. “There are agents at Franklin Square!” "},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"He pulled harder. “ What is the address on the capstone? ” The pain in her wrists and shoulders grew unbearabl e, but Katherine said nothing. “You can tell me now, Katherine, or I’ll break your arms and ask you again.” “Eight!” she gasped in pain. “The missing number is eight ! The capstone says: ‘The secret hides within The Order—Eight Franklin Square!’ I swear it. I don’t k now what else to tell you! It’s Eight Franklin Square!” The man still did not release her shoulders. “That’s all I know!” Katherine said. “That’s the ad dress! Let go of me! Let Robert out of that tank!” “I would . . . ” the man said, “but there’s one problem. I can’t g o to Eight Franklin Square without being caught. Tell me, what’s at that address?” “I don’t know!” “And the symbols on the base of the pyramid? On the underside? Do you know their meaning?” “ What symbols on the base?” Katherine had no idea what h e was talking about. “ The bottom has no symbols. It’s smooth, blank stone!” Apparently immune to the muffled cries for help ema nating from the coffinlike crate, the tattooed man calmly padded over to Langdon’s day-bag and retriev ed the stone pyramid. Then he returned to Katherine and held it up before her eyes so she could see the base. When Katherine saw the engraved symbols, she gasped in bewilderment. But . . . that ’s impossible! The bottom of the pyramid was entirely covered with intricate carvings. There was nothing there before! I’m sure of it! She had no idea what these symbols could possibly mean. They seemed to span every mystical tradition, including many she could not even place."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":" Total chaos. “I . . . have no idea what this means,” she said. “Nor do I,” her captor said. “Fortunately, we have a specialist at our disposal.” He glanced at the cra te. “Let’ s ask him, shall we?” He carried the pyramid toward t he crate. For a brief instant of hope, Katherine thought he w as going to unclasp the lid. Instead, he sat calmly on top of the box, reached down, and slid a small panel to on e side, revealing a Plexiglas window in the top of the tank. Light! Langdon covered his eyes, squinting into the ray of light that now streamed in from above. As his eyes adjusted, hope turned to confusion. He was looking up through what appeared to be a window in the top of his crate. Through the window, he saw a white ceili ng and a fluorescent light. Without warning, the tattooed face appeared above h im, peering down. “Where is Katherine?!” Langdon shouted. “Let me out !” The man smiled. “Your friend Katherine is here with me,” the man said. “I have the power to spare her life. Your life as well. But your time is short, so I sug gest you listen carefully.” Langdon could barely hear him through the glass, an d the water had risen higher, creeping across his c hest. “Are you aware,” the man asked, “that there are sym bols on the base of the pyramid?” “Yes!” Langdon shouted, having seen the extensive a rray of symbols when the pyramid had lain on the fl oor upstairs. “But I have no idea what they mean! You n eed to go to Eight Franklin Square! The answer is t here! That’s what the capstone—” “Professor, you and I both know the CIA is waiting for me there. I have no intention of walking into a trap. Besides, I didn’t need the street number. There is only one building on that square that could possibly be relevant—the Almas Shrine Temple.” He paused, stari ng down at Langdon. “The Ancient Arabic Order of Nobles of the Mystic Shrine. ” Langdon was confused. He was familiar with the Alma s Temple, but he had forgotten it was on Franklin Square. The Shriners are . . . “The Order”? Their temple si ts atop a secret staircase? It made no historical sense whatsoever, but Langdon was in no position at the moment to debate history. “Yes!” he shouted. “ That must be it! The secret hides within The Order!” “You’re familiar with the building?” “Absolutely!” Langdon raised his throbbing head to keep his ears above the quickly rising liquid. “I c an help you! Let me out!” “So you believe you can tell me what this temple ha s to do with the symbols on the base of the pyramid ?” “Yes! Let me just look at the symbols!” “Very well, then. Let’s see what you come up with.” Hurry! With the warm liquid rising around him, Langdon pu shed up on the lid, willing the man to unclasp it. Please! Hurry! But the lid never opened. Instead, the base of the pyramid suddenly appeared, hovering above the Plexiglas window. "},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Langdon stared up in panic. “I trust this view is close enough for you?”The man held the pyramid in his tattooed hands. “Think fas t, Professor. I’m guessing you have less than sixty se conds.” CHAPTER 102 Robert Langdon had often heard it said that an animal, when corne red, was capable of miraculous feats of strength. Nonetheless, when he threw his full force into the underside of his crate, nothing budged at all. Around him, the liquid continued rising steadily. W ith no more than six inches of breathing room left, Langdon had lifted his head into the pocket of air that remained. He was now face-to-face with the Ple xiglas window, his eyes only inches away from the undersid e of the stone pyramid whose baffling engraving hovered above him. I have no idea what this means. Concealed for over a century beneath a hardened mix ture of wax and stone dust, the Masonic Pyramid’ s final inscription was now laid bare. The engraving was a perfectly square grid of symbols from every traditi on imaginable—alchemical, astrological, heraldic, ange lic, magical, numeric, sigilic, Greek, Latin. As a totality, this was symbolic anarchy—a bowl of alphabet soup w hose letters came from dozens of different language s, cultures, and time periods. Total chaos. Symbologist Robert Langdon, in his wildest academic interpretations, could not fathom how this grid of symbols could be deciphered to mean anything at all . Order from this chaos? Impossible . "},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"The liquid was now creeping over his Adam ’ s apple, and Langdon could feel his level of terror rising along with it. He continued banging on the tank. The pyra mid stared back at him tauntingly. In frantic desperation, Langdon focused every bit o f his mental energy on the chessboard of symbols. What could they possibly mean? Unfortunately, the assortment seemed so disparate that he could not even imagine where to begin. They’re not even from the same eras in history! Outside the tank, her voice muffled but audible, Ka therine could be heard tearfully begging for Langdo n’s release. Despite his failure to see a solution, the prospect of death seemed to motivate every cell in his body to find one. He felt a strange clarity of mind, unl ike anything he had ever experienced. Think! He scanned the grid intensely, searching for some clue—a pattern, a hidden word, a special icon, anything at all—but he saw only a grid of unrelated symbols. Chaos. With each passing second, Langdon had begun to feel an eerie numbness overtaking his body. It was as i f his very flesh were preparing to shield his mind from t he pain of death. The water was now threatening to pour into his ears, and he lifted his head as far as he could, pushing it against the top of the crate. Fri ghtening images began flashing before his eyes. A boy in New England treading water at the bottom of a dark wel l. A man in Rome trapped beneath a skeleton in an overtu rned coffin. Katherine’s shouts were growing more frantic. From all Langdon could hear, she was trying to reason with a madman—insisting that Langdon could not be expected to decipher the pyramid without going to visit the Almas Temple. “That building obviously holds the mi ssing piece to this puzzle! How can Robert decipher the pyramid without all the information?!” Langdon appreciated her efforts, and yet he felt ce rtain that “Eight Franklin Square” was not pointing to the Almas Temple. The time line is all wrong! According to legend, the Masonic Pyramid was creat ed in the mid-1800s, decades before the Shriners even existed . In fact, Langdon realized, it was probably before the square was even called Franklin Square. The capston e could not possibly have been pointing to an unbui lt building at a nonexistent address. Whatever “Eight Franklin Square” was pointing to . . . it had to exist in 1850. Unfortunately, Langdon was drawing a total blank. He probed his memory banks for anything that could possibly fit the time line. Eight Franklin Square? Something that was in existe nce in 1850? Langdon came up with nothing. The liquid was trickling into his ears now. Fightin g his terror, he stared up at the grid of symbols o n the glass. I don’t understand the connection! In a petrified frenzy, his mind began spewing all the far-flung parallels it could generate. Eight Franklin Square . . . squares . . . this grid of symbols is a square . . . the square and the co mpass are Masonic symbols . . . Masonic altars are square . . . squares have ninety -degree angles. The water kept rising, but Langdon blocked it out. Eight Franklin . . . eight . . . this grid is eight -by-eight . . . Franklin has eight letters . . . “The Order” has eight letters . . . 8 is the rotated symbol for infinity . . . eight is the number of destruction in numerology . . . Langdon had no idea. Outside the tank, Katherine was still pleading, but Langdon’s hearing was now intermittent as the wate r was sloshing around his head. “ . . . impossible without knowing . . . capstone’s message clearly . . . the secret hides within—” Then she was gone. Water poured into Langdon’s ears, blotting out the last of Katherine’s voice. A sudden womblike silenc e engulfed him, and Langdon realized he truly was goi ng to die. The secret hides within —"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":" Katherine’s final words echoed through the hush of his tomb. The secret hides within . . . Strangely, Langdon realized he had heard these exac t words many times before. The secret hides . . . within. Even now, it seemed, the Ancient Mysteries were tau nting him. “The secret hides within” was the core t enet of the mysteries, urging man kind to seek God not in the heavens above . . . but rather within himse lf. The secret hides within. It was the message of all the great mystical teach ers. The kingdom of God is within you, said Jesus Christ. Know thyself, said Pythagoras. Know ye not that ye are gods, said Hermes Trismegistus. The list went on and on . . . All the mystical teachings of the ages had attempte d to convey this one idea. The secret hides within. Even so, mankind continued looking to the heavens for th e face of God. This realization, for Langdon, now became an ultima te irony. Right now, with his eyes facing the heavens like all the blind men who preceded him, Robert Langdon suddenly saw the light. It hit him like a bolt from above. The secret hides within The Order Eight Franklin Square In a flash he understood. The message on the capstone was suddenly crystal cl ear. Its meaning had been staring him in the face a ll night. The text on the capstone, like the Masonic P yramid itself, was a symbolon—a code in pieces—a message written in parts. The capstone’s meaning wa s camouflaged in so simple a manner that Langdon could scarcely believe he and Katherine had not spo tted it. More astonishing still, Langdon now realized that t he message on the capstone did indeed reveal exactly how to decipher the grid of symbols on the base of the pyramid. It was so very simple. Exactly as Peter So lomon had promised, the golden capstone was a potent tali sman with the power to bring order from chaos. Langdon began pounding on the lid and shouting, “I know! I know!” Above him, the stone pyramid lifted off and hovered away. In its place, the tattooed face reappeared, its chilling visage staring down through the small wind ow. “I solved it!” Langdon shouted. “Let me out!” "},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"When the tattooed man spoke, Langdon ’ s submerged ears heard nothing. His eyes, however, saw the lips speak two words. “Tell me.” “I will!” Langdon screamed, the water almost to his eyes. “Let me out! I’ll explain everything!” It’s so simple. The man’s lips moved again. “Tell me now . . . or die.” With the water rising through the final inch of air space, Langdon tipped his head back to keep his mo uth above the waterline. As he did so, warm liquid pour ed into his eyes, blurring his vision. Arching his back, he pressed his mouth against the Plexiglas window. Then, with his last few seconds of air, Robert Lang don shared the secret of how to decipher the Masoni c Pyramid. As he finished speaking, the liquid rose around his lips. Instinctively, Langdon drew a final breath a nd clamped his mouth shut. A moment later, the fluid c overed him entirely, reaching the top of his tomb a nd spreading out across the Plexiglas. He did it, Mal’akh realized. Langdon figured out how to solve the pyramid. The answer was so simple. So obvious. Beneath the window, the submerged face of Robert La ngdon stared up at him with desperate and beseechin g eyes. Mal’akh shook his head at him and slowly mouthed th e words: “Thank you, Professor. Enjoy the afterlife .” CHAPTER 103 As a serious swimmer, Robert Langdon had often wondered what it would feel like to drown. He now knew he was going to learn firsthand. Although he could hold his breath longer than most people, he could a lready feel his body reacting to the absence of air. Carbo n dioxide was accumulating in his blood, bringing w ith it the instinctual urge to inhale. Do not breathe! The reflex to inhale was increasing in intensity w ith each passing moment. Langdon knew very soon he would rea ch what was called the breath-hold breakpoint—that critical moment at which a person could no longer v oluntarily hold his breath. Open the lid! Langdon’s instinct was to pound and struggle, but he knew better than to waste valuable oxygen. All he could do was stare up through the bl ur of water above him and hope. The world outside w as now only a hazy patch of light above the Plexiglas window. His core muscles had begun burning, and he knew hypoxia was setting in. Suddenly a beautiful and ghostly face appeared, gaz ing down at him. It was Katherine, her soft feature s looking almost ethereal through the veil of liquid. Their eyes met through the Plexiglas window, and f or an instant, Langdon thought he was saved. Katherine! Then he heard her muted cries of horror and realiz ed she was being held there by their captor. The tattooed monster was forcing her to bear witness to what was about to happen. Katherine, I ’m sorry . . . In this strange, dark place, trapped underwater, La ngdon strained to comprehend that these would be his final"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"moments of life. Soon he would cease to exist . . . everything he was . . . or had ever been . . . or would ever be . . . was ending. When his brain died, all of th e memories held in his gray matter, along with all of the knowledge he had acquired, would simply evaporate i n a flood of chemical reactions. In this moment, Robert Langdon realized his true in significance in the universe. It was as lonely and humbling a feeling as he had ever experienced. Almost thankfully, he could feel the b reath-hold breakpoint arriving. The moment was upon him. Langdon’ s lungs forced out their spent contents, collapsing in eager preparation to inhale. Still he held out an instant longer. His final second. Then, like a man no longer able to hold his hand to a burning stove, he gave himself over to fate. Reflex overruled reason. His lips parted. His lungs expanded. And the liquid came pouring in. The pain that filled his chest was greater than Lan gdon had ever imagined. The liquid burned as it pou red into his lungs. Instantly, the pain shot upward int o his skull, and he felt like his head was being cr ushed in a vise. There was great thundering in his ears, and t hrough it all, Katherine Solomon was screaming. There was a blinding flash of light. And then blackness. Robert Langdon was gone. CHAPTER 104 It’s over. Katherine Solomon had stopped screaming. The drowni ng she had just witnessed had left her catatonic, virtually paralyzed with shock and despair. Beneath the Plexiglas window, Langdon’s dead eyes s tared past her into empty space. His frozen express ion was one of pain and regret. The last tiny air bubbl es trickled out of his lifeless mouth, and then, as if consenting to give up his ghost, the Harvard profes sor slowly began sinking to the bottom of the tank . . . where he disappeared into the shadows. He ’s gone. Katherine felt numb. The tattooed man reached down, and with pitiless fi nality, he slid the small viewing window closed, se aling Langdon’s corpse inside. Then he smiled at her. “Shall we?” "},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Before Katherine could respond, he hoisted her grie f - stricken body onto his shoulder, turned out the lig ht, and carried her out of the room. With a few powerfu l strides, he transported her to the end of the hal l, into a large space that seemed to be bathed in a reddish-p urple light. The room smelled like incense. He carr ied her to a square table in the center of the room and dro pped her hard on her back, knocking the wind out of her. The surface felt rough and cold. Is this stone? Katherine had hardly gotten her bearings before the man had removed the wire from her wrists and ankle s. Instinctively, she attempted to fight him off, but her cramped arms and legs barely responded. He now began strapping her to the table with heavy leather bands , cinching one strap across her knees and then buck ling a second across her hips, pinning her arms at her sid es. Then he placed a final strap across her sternum , just above her breasts. It had all taken only moments, and Katherine was ag ain immobilized. Her wrists and ankles throbbed now as the circulation returned to her limbs. “Open your mouth,” the man whispered, licking his o wn tattooed lips. Katherine clenched her teeth in revulsion. The man again reached out with his index finger and ran it slowly around her lips, making her skin cra wl. She clenched her teeth tighter. The tattooed man ch uckled and, using his other hand, found a pressure point on her neck and squeezed. Katherine’s jaw instantly dropped open. She could feel his finger entering h er mouth and running along her tongue. She gagged and tried to bite it, but the finger was already gone. Still grinning, he raised his moist fingertip before her eyes. Then he closed his eyes and, once again, rubb ed her saliva into the bare circle of flesh on his head. The man sighed and slowly opened his eyes. Then, wi th an eerie calm, he turned and left the room. In the sudden silence, Katherine could feel her hea rt pounding. Directly over her, an unusual series o f lights seemed to be modulating from purple red to a deep c rimson, illuminating the room’s low ceiling. When s he saw the ceiling, all she could do was stare. Every inch was covered with drawings. The mind-boggling collage above her appeared to depict the celestial sky. Stars, planets, and constellations mingled wit h astrological symbols, charts, and formulas. There w ere arrows predicting elliptical orbits, geometric symbols indicating angles of ascension, and zodiacal creatu res peering down at her. It looked like a mad scien tist had gotten loose in the Sistine Chapel. Turning her head, Katherine looked away, but the wa ll to her left was no better. A series of candles o n medieval floor stands shed a flickering glow on a w all that was completely hidden beneath pages of tex t, photos, and drawings. Some of the pages looked like papyrus or vellum torn from ancient books; others were obviously from newer texts; mixed in were photograp hs, drawings, maps, and schematics; all of them appeared to have been glued to the wall with meticu lous care. A spiderweb of strings had been thumbtac ked across them, interconnecting them in limitless chao tic possibilities. Katherine again looked away, turning her head in th e other direction. Unfortunately, this provided the most terrifying vi ew of all. Adjacent to the stone slab on which she was strappe d, there stood a small side counter that instantly reminded her of an instrument table from a hospital operating room. On the counter was arranged a seri es of objects—among them a syringe, a vial of dark liquid . . . and a large knife with a bone handle and a b lade hewn of iron burnished to an unusually high shine.

I was trying to see what document was being targeted, so I traced the file path.” Parrish paused, clearing his throat. “This d ocument turns out to be on a partition personally a ssigned to . . . the CIA director himself.” Nola wheeled, staring in disbelief. Sato’s boss has a file about the Masonic Pyramid? She knew that the current director, along with many other top CIA exe cutives, was a high-ranking Mason, but Nola could n ot imagine any of them keeping Masonic secrets on a CI A computer. Then again, considering what she had witnessed in t he last twenty-four hours, anything was possible. Agent Simkins was lying on his stomach, ensconced i n the bushes of Franklin Square. His eyes were trai ned on the columned entry of the Almas Temple. Nothing . No lights had come on inside, and no one had approached the door. He turned his head and checked on Bellamy. The man was pacing alone in the middle of the park, looking cold. Really cold. Simkins could see him shaking and shivering. His phone vibrated. It was Sato. “How overdue is our target?” she demanded. Simkins checked his chronograph. “Target said twent y minutes. It’s been almost forty. Something’s wron g.” “He’s not coming,” Sato said. “It’s over.” Simkins knew she was right. “Any word from Hartmann ?” “No, he never checked in from Kalorama Heights.

I need to prepare quickly. He glanced over at the dead CIA agent in the foyer . This home is no longer safe. Carrying the stone pyramid in one hand, Mal’akh str ode directly to his first-floor study and sat down at his laptop computer. As he logged in, he pictured Langd on downstairs and wondered how many days or even weeks would pass before the submerged corpse was di scovered in the secret basement. It made no differe nce. Mal’akh would be long gone by then. Langdon has served his role . . . brilliantly. Not only had Langdon reunited the pieces of the Mas onic Pyramid, he had figured out how to solve the arcane grid of symbols on the base. At first glance , the symbols seemed indecipherable . . . and yet t he answer was simple . . . staring them in the face. Mal’akh’s laptop sprang to life, the screen display ing the same e-mail he had received earlier—a photo graph of a glowing capstone, partially blocked by Warren Bellamy’s finger. The secret hides within The Order. Franklin Square. Eight . . . Franklin Square, Katherine had told Mal’akh. She had also admitted that CIA agents were staking out Franklin Square, hoping to capture Mal’akh and also figure out what order was being referenced by the capstone. The Masons? The Shriners? The Rosicrucian s? None of these, Mal’akh now knew. Langdon saw the truth. Ten minutes earlier, with liquid rising around his face, the Harvard professor had figured out the key to solving the pyramid. “The Order Eight Franklin Squa re!” he had shouted, terror in his eyes. “ The secret hides within The Order Eight Franklin Square!” At first, Mal’akh failed to understand his meaning. “It’s not an address!” Langdon yelled, his mouth pr essed to the Plexiglas window. “ The Order Eight Franklin Square! It’s a magic square!” Then he said something about Albrecht Dür er . . . and how the pyramid’s first code was a clue to breaking this final one. "},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Mal ’ akh was familiar with magic squares — kameas, as the early mystics called them. The ancient text De Occulta Philosophia described in detail the mystical power of magic sq uares and the methods for designing powerful sigils based on magical grids of numbers. Now Langdon was telling him that a magic square hel d the key to deciphering the base of the pyramid? “You need an eight-by-eight magic square!” the prof essor had been yelling, his lips the only part of h is body above the liquid. “Magic squares are categorized in orders ! A three-by-three square is an ‘order three’! A four-by-four square is an ‘order four’! You need an ‘order eight’!” The liquid had been about to engulf Langdon entirel y, and the professor drew one last desperate breath and shouted out something about a famous Mason . . . an American forefather . . . a scientist, mystic, mathematician, inventor . . . as well as the creato r of the mystical kamea that bore his name to this day. Franklin. In a flash, Mal’akh knew Langdon was right. Now, breathless with anticipation, Mal ’akh sat upstairs at his laptop. He ran a quick Web search, received dozens of hits, chose one, and began reading. THE ORDER EIGHT FRANKLIN SQUARE One of history’s best-known magic squares is the or der- eight square published in 1769 by American scientis t Benjamin Franklin, and which became famous for its inclusion of never-before-seen “bent diagonal summations.” Franklin’s obsession with this mystica l art form most likely stemmed from his personal associations with the prominent alchemists and myst ics of his day, as well as his own belief in astrol ogy, which were the underpinnings for the predictions ma de in his Poor Richard’s Almanack. Mal’akh studied Franklin’s famous creation—a unique arrangement of the numbers 1 through 64—in which every row, column, and diagonal added up to the sam e magical constant.

Trembling with excitement, he grabbed t he stone pyramid and flipped it over, examining the base. These sixty-four symbols needed to be reorganized a nd arranged in a different order, their sequence de fined by the numbers in Franklin’s magic square. Although Mal’akh could not imagine how this chaotic grid of symbols would suddenly make sense in a different or der, he had faith in the ancient promise. Ordo ab chao. Heart racing, he took out a sheet of paper and quic kly drew an empty eight-by-eight grid. Then he bega n inserting the symbols, one by one, in their newly d efined positions.

CHAPTER 107"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" The stone table felt cold beneath Katherine Solomon’s back. Horrifying images of Robert’ s death continued to swirl through her mind, along with thoughts of her brother. Is Peter dead, too? The strange knife on the nearby table kept bringin g flashes of what might lie in store for her as well . Is this really the end? Oddly, her thoughts turned abruptly to her research . . . to Noetic Science . . . and to her recent breakthroughs. All of it lost . . . up in smoke. She would never be able to share with the world ev erything she had learned. Her most shocking discovery had taken place only a few months ago, and the results had th e potential to redefine the way humans thought about death. Strangely, thinking now of that experiment . . . was bringing her an unexpected solace. As a young girl, Katherine Solomon had often wonder ed if there was life after death. Does heaven exist? What happens when we die? As she grew older, her studies in science quickly erased any fanciful notions of heaven, hell, or the afterlife. The concept of “lif e after death,” she came to accept, was a human construct . . . a fairy tale designed to soften the horrifying trut h that was our mortality. Or so I believed . . . A year ago, Katherine and her brother had been disc ussing one of philosophy’s most enduring questions— the existence of the human soul—specifically the issue of whether or not humans possessed some kind of consciousness capable of survival outside of the body. They both sensed that such a human soul probably did exist. Most ancient philosophies concurred. Buddhi st and Brahminical wisdom endorsed metempsychosis—the transmigration of the soul into a new body after death; Platonists defined the body as a “prison” fr om which the soul escaped; and the Stoics called th e soul apospasma tou theu —“a particle of God”—and believed it was recalled b y God upon death. The existence of the human soul, Katherine noted wi th some frustration, was probably a concept that would neve r be scientifically proven. Confirming that a consciousness survived outside the human body after death was akin to exhaling a puff of smoke and hop ing to find it years later. After their discussion, Katherine had a strange not ion. Her brother had mentioned the Book of Genesis and its description of the soul as Neshemah —a kind of spiritual “intelligence” that was separa te from the body. It occurred to Katherine that the word intelligence suggested the presence of thought . Noetic Science clearly suggested that thoughts had mass, and so it stood to reason, then, that th e human soul might therefore also have mass. Can I weigh a human soul? The notion was impossible, of course . . . foolish even to ponder. It was three days later that Katherine suddenly wok e up from a dead sleep and sat bolt upright in bed. She jumped up, drove to her lab, and immediately began work designing an experiment that was both startlin gly simple . . . and frighteningly bold. She had no idea if it would work, and she decided n ot to tell Peter about her idea until her work was complete. It took four months, but finally Katherin e brought her brother into the lab. She wheeled out a large piece of gear that she had been keeping hidden in t he back storage room. “I designed and built it myself,” she said, showing Peter her invention. “Any guesses?” Her brother stared at the strange machine. “ An incubator? ”"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":" Katherine laughed and shook her head, although it w as a reasonable guess. The machine did look a bit like the transparent incubators for premature babies one saw in hospitals. This machine, however, was adult size—a long, airtight, clear plastic capsule, like some kind of futuristic sleeping pod. It sat atop a large piece of electronic gear. “See if this helps you guess,” Katherine said, plugging the con traption into a power source. A digital display lit up on the machine, its numbers jumping around a s she carefully calibrated some dials. When she was done, the display read: 0.0000000000 kg “A scale?” Peter asked, looking puzzled. “Not just any scale.” Katherine took a tiny scrap o f paper off a nearby counter and laid it gently on top of the capsule. The numbers on the display jumped around a gain and then settled on a new reading. .0008194325 kg “High-precision microbalance,” she said. “Resolutio n down to a few micrograms.” Peter still looked puzzled. “You built a precise sc ale for . . . a person?” “Exactly.” She lifted the transparent lid on the ma chine. “If I place a person inside this capsule and close the lid, the individual is in an entirely sealed system. Nothing gets in or out. No gas, no liquid, no dust particles. Nothing can escape —not the person’s breath exhalations, evaporating s weat, body fluids, nothing.” Peter ran a hand through his thick head of silver h air, a nervous mannerism shared by Katherine. “Hmm . . . obviously a person would die in there pretty quickl y.” She nodded. “Six minutes or so, depending on their breathing rate.” He turned to her. “I don’t get it.” She smiled. “You will .” Leaving the machine behind, Katherine led Peter int o the Cube’s control room and sat him down in front of the plasma wall. She began typing and accessed a se ries of video files stored on the holographic drive s. When the plasma wall flickered to life, the image b efore them looked like home-video footage. The camera panned across a modest bedroom with an u nmade bed, medication bottles, a respirator, and a heart monitor. Peter looked baffled as the camera k ept panning and finally revealed, near the center o f the bedroom, Katherine’s scale contraption. Peter’s eyes widened. “What the . . . ?” The capsule’s transparent lid was open, and a very old man in an oxygen mask lay inside. His elderly w ife and a hospice worker stood beside the pod. The man’ s breathing was labored, and his eyes were closed. “The man in the capsule was a science teacher of mi ne at Yale,” Katherine said. “ He and I have kept in touch over the years. He ’ s been very ill. He always said he wanted to donate his body to science, so when I"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"explained my idea for this experiment, he immediate ly wanted to be a part of it. ” Peter was apparently mute with shock as he stared a t the scene unfolding before them. The hospice worker now turned to the man’s wife. “I t’s time. He’s ready.” The old woman dabbed her tearful eyes and nodded wi th a resolute calm. “Okay.” Very gently, the hospice worker reached into the po d and removed the man’s oxygen mask. The man stirred slightly, but hi s eyes remained closed. Now the worker wheeled the respirator and other equipment off to the side, lea ving the old man in the capsule totally isolated in the center of the room. The dying man’s wife now approached the pod, leaned down, and gently kissed her husband’s forehead. Th e old man did not open his eyes, but his lips moved, ever so slightly, into a faint, loving smile. Without his oxygen mask, the man’s breathing was qu ickly becoming more labored. The end was obviously near. With an admirable strength and calm, the man’ s wife slowly lowered the transparent lid of the ca psule and sealed it shut, exactly as Katherine had taught her. Peter recoiled in alarm. “Katherine, what in the na me of God?!” “It’s okay,” Katherine whispered. “There’s plenty o f air in the capsule.” She had seen this video doze ns of times now, but it still made her pulse race. She po inted to the scale beneath the dying man’s sealed p od. The digital numbers read: 51.4534644 kg “That’s his body weight,” Katherine said. The old man’s breathing became more shallow, and Pe ter inched forward, transfixed. “This is what he wanted,” Katherine whispered. “Wat ch what happens.” The man’s wife had stepped back and was now seated on the bed, silently looking on with the hospice worker. Over the course of the next sixty seconds, the man’ s shallow breathing grew faster, until all at once, as if the man himself had chosen the moment, he simply took h is last breath. Everything stopped. It was over. The wife and hospice worker quietly comforted each other. Nothing else happened. After a few seconds, Peter glanced over at Katherin e in apparent confusion. Wait for it, she thought, redirecting Peter’s gaze to the capsu le’s digital display, which still quietly glowed, showing the dead man’s weight. Then it happened. When Peter saw it, he jolted backward, almost falli ng out of his chair. “But . . . that’s . . .” He co vered his mouth in shock. “I can’t . . .” "},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"It was seldom that the great Peter Solomon was spee chless. Katherine ’ s reaction had been similar the first few times she saw what had happened. Moments after the man’s death, the numbers on the s cale had decreased suddenly. The man had become lighter immediately after his death. The weight change was minuscule, but it was measurable . . . and the implications were utterly mind-boggling. Katherine recalled writing in her lab notes with a trembling hand: “There seems to exist an invisible ‘material’ that exits the human body at the moment of death. It has quantifiable mass which is unimped ed by physical barriers. I must assume it moves in a dime nsion I cannot yet perceive.” From the expression of shock on her brother’s face, Katherine knew he understood the implications. “Katherine . . .” he stammered, blinking his gray ey es as if to make sure he was not dreaming. “I think you just weighed the human soul. ” There was a long silence between them. Katherine sensed that her brother was attempting to process all the stark and wondrous ramifications. It will take time. If what they had just witnessed was indeed what it seemed to be—that is, evidence that a soul or consciousness or life force could move outside the realm of the body—then a startling new light h ad just been shed on countless mystical questions: transmig ration, cosmic consciousness, near-death experience s, astral projection, remote viewing, lucid dreaming, and on and on. Medical journals were filled with st ories of patients who had died on the operating table, viewe d their bodies from above, and then been brought ba ck to life. Peter was silent, and Katherine now saw he had tear s in his eyes. She understood. She had cried, too. Peter and Katherine had lost loved ones, and for anyone i n that position, the faintest hint of the human spi rit continuing after death brought a glimmer of hope. He ’s thinking of Zachary, Katherine thought, recognizing the deep melancholy in her brother’s eyes. For years Peter had carried the burden of responsibilit y for his son’s death. He had told Katherine many t imes that leaving Zachary in prison had been the worst m istake of his life, and that he would never find a way to forgive himself. A slamming door drew Katherine’s attention, and sud denly she was back in the basement, lying on a cold stone table. The metal door at the top of the ramp had closed loudly, and the tattooed man was coming back down. She could hear him entering one of the rooms down the hall, doing something inside, and then continuing along the hall toward the room she was i n. As he entered, she could see that he was pushing something in front of him. Something heavy . . . on wheels. As he stepped into the light, she stared i n disbelief. The tattooed man was pushing a person in a wheelchair. Intellectually, Katherine’s brain recognized the ma n in the chair. Emotionally, her mind could barely accept what she was looking at. Peter? She didn’t know whether to be overjoyed that her br other was alive . . . or utterly horrified. Peter’s body had been shaved smooth. His mane of thick silver hair w as all gone, as were his eyebrows, and his smooth s kin glistened as if it had been oiled. He wore a black silk gown. Where his right hand should have been, h e had only a stump, wrapped in a clean, fresh bandage. He r brother’s pain-laden eyes reached out to hers, fi lled with regret and sorrow. “Peter!” Her voice cracked. Her brother tried to speak but made only muffled, g uttural noises. Katherine now realized he was bound to the wheelchair and had been gagged. The tattooed man reached down and gently stroked Pe ter ’ s shaved scalp. “ I ’ ve prepared your brother for a"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"great honor. He has a role to play tonight. ” Katherine’s entire body went rigid. No . . . “Peter and I will be leaving in a moment, but I tho ught you’d want to say good-bye.” “Where are you taking him?” she said weakly. He smiled. “Peter and I must journey to the sacred mountain. That is where the treasure lies. The Maso nic Pyramid has revealed the location. Your friend Robe rt Langdon was most helpful.” Katherine looked into her brother’s eyes. “He kille d . . . Robert.” Her brother’s expression contorted in agony, and he shook his head violently, as if unable to bear any more pain. “Now, now, Peter,” the man said, again stroking Pet er’s scalp. “Don’t let this ruin the moment. Say go od- bye to your little sister. This is your final family re union.” Katherine felt her mind welling with desperation. “ Why are you doing this?!” she shouted at him. “What have we ever done to you?! Why do you hate my famil y so much?!” The tattooed man came over and placed his mouth rig ht next to her ear. “I have my reasons, Katherine.” Then he walked to the side table and picked up the strange knife. He brought it over to her and ran th e burnished blade across her cheek. “This is arguably the most famous knife in history.” Katherine knew of no famous knives, but it looked f oreboding and ancient. The blade felt razor sharp. “Don’t worry,” he said. “I have no intention of was ting its power on you. I’m saving it for a more worthy sacrifice . . . in a more sacred place.” He turned to her brother. “Pet er, you recognize this knife, don’t you?” Her brother’s eyes were wide with a mixture of fear and disbelief. “Yes, Peter, this ancient artifact still exists. I obtained it at great expense . . . and I have been saving it for you. At long last, you and I can end our painful jo urney together.” With that, he wrapped the knife carefully in a clot h with all of his other items— incense, vials of liquid, white satin cloths, and other ceremonial objects. He then placed the wrapped items inside Robert Langdon’ s leather bag along with the Masonic Pyramid and capstone. Ka therine looked on helplessly as the man zipped up Langdon’s daybag and turned to her brother. “Carry this, Peter, would you?” He set the heavy ba g on Peter’s lap. Next, the man walked over to a drawer and began roo ting around. She could hear small metal objects clinking. When he returned, he took her right arm, steadying it. Katherine couldn’t see what he was do ing, but Peter apparently could, and he again started bu cking wildly. Katherine felt a sudden, sharp pinch in the crook o f her right elbow, and an eerie warmth ran down aro und it. Peter was making anguished, strangled sounds and tr ying in vain to get out of the heavy chair. Katheri ne felt a cold numbness spreading through her forearm and f ingertips below the elbow. When the man stepped aside, Katherine saw why her b rother was so horrified. The tattooed man had inser ted a medical needle into her vein, as if she were givi ng blood. The needle, however, was not attached to a tube. Instead, her blood was now flowing freely out of it . . . running down her elbow, forearm, and onto th e stone table. "},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"“ A human hourglass, ” the man said, turning to Peter. “ In a short while, when I ask you to play your role, I want you to picture Katherine . . . dying alone her e in the dark.” Peter’s expression was one of total torment. “She will stay alive,” the man said, “for about an hour or so. If you cooperate with me quickly, I wil l have enough time to save her. Of course, if you resist m e at all . . . your sister will die here alone in t he dark.” Peter bellowed unintelligibly through his gag. “I know, I know,” the tattooed man said, placing a hand on Peter’s shoulder, “this is hard for you. Bu t it shouldn’t be. After all, this is not the first time you will abandon a family member.” He paused, bending over and whispering in Peter’s ear. “I’m thinking, of co urse, of your son, Zachary, in Soganlik prison.” Peter pulled against his restraints and let out ano ther muffled scream through the cloth in his mouth. “Stop it!” Katherine shouted. “I remember that night well,” the man taunted as he finished packing. “I heard the whole thing. The wa rden offered to let your son go, but you chose to teach Zachary a lesson . . . by abandoning him. Your boy learned his lesson, all right, didn’t he?” The man smiled. “His loss . . . was my gain.” The man now retrieved a linen cloth and stuffed it deep into Katherine’s mouth. “Death,” he whispered t o her, “should be a quiet thing.” Peter struggled violently. Without another word, th e tattooed man slowly backed Peter’s wheelchair out of the room, giving Peter a long, last look at his sis ter. Katherine and Peter locked eyes one final time. Then he was gone. Katherine could hear them going up the ramp and thr ough the metal door. As they exited, she heard the tattooed man lock the metal door behind him and con tinue on through the painting of the Three Graces. A few minutes later, she heard a car start. Then the mansion fell silent. All alone in the dark, Katherine lay bleeding. CHAPTER 108 Robert Langdon’s mind hovered in an endless abyss. No light. No sound. No feeling. Only an infinite and silent void. Softness. Weightlessness."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" His body had released him. He was untethered. The physical world had ceased to exist. Time had ce ased to exist. He was pure consciousness now . . . a fleshless sen tience suspended in the emptiness of a vast univers e. CHAPTER 109 The modified UH-60 skimmed in low over the expansive rooftops o f Kalorama Heights, thundering toward the coordinates given to them by the support team. Agent Simkins was the first to spot the black Escal ade parked haphazardly on a lawn in front of one of the mansions. The driveway gate was closed, and the ho use was dark and quiet. Sato gave the signal to touch down. The aircraft landed hard on the front lawn amid sev eral other vehicles . . . one of them a security se dan with a bubble light on top. Simkins and his team jumped out, drew their weapons , and dashed up onto the porch. Finding the front d oor locked, Simkins cupped his hands and peered through a window. The foyer was dark, but Simkins could make out the faint shadow of a body on the floor. “Shit,” he whispered. “It’s Hartmann.” One of his agents grabbed a chair off the porch and heaved it through the bay window. The sound of shattering glass was barely audible over the roar o f the helicopter behind them. Seconds later, they w ere all inside. Simkins rushed to the foyer and knelt over Hartmann to check his pulse. Nothing. There was blo od everywhere. Then he saw the screwdriver in Hartmann ’s throat. Jesus . He stood up and motioned to his men to begin a fu ll search. The agents fanned out across the first floor, their laser sights probing the darkness of the luxurious house. They found nothing in the living room or study, but in the dining room, to their surprise, they discov ered a strangled female security guard. Simkins was fast l osing hope that Robert Langdon and Katherine Solomo n were alive. This brutal killer clearly had set a tr ap, and if he had managed to kill a CIA agent and a n armed security guard, then it seemed a professor and a sc ientist had no chance. Once the first floor was secure, Simkins sent two a gents to search upstairs. Meanwhile, he found a set of basement stairs off the kitchen and descended. At t he bottom of the stairs, he threw on the lights. Th e basement was spacious and spotless, as if it were h ardly ever used. Boilers, bare cement walls, a few boxes. Nothing here at all. Simkins headed back up to the kitchen just as his men were coming down from the second floor. Everyone shook their heads. The house was deserted. No one home. And no more bodies. Simkins radioed Sato with the all-clear and the gri m update. When he got to the foyer, Sato was already climbing the stairs onto the porch. Warren Bellamy was visi ble"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"behind her, sitting dazed and alone in the helicopt er with Sato ’ s titanium briefcase at his feet. The OS director’s secure laptop provided her with worldwid e access to CIA computer systems via encrypted sate llite uplinks. Earlier tonight, she had used this compute r to share with Bellamy some kind of information th at had stunned the man into cooperating fully. Simkins had no idea what Bellamy had seen, but whatever it was , the Architect had been visibly shell-shocked ever since . As Sato entered the foyer, she paused a moment, bow ing her head over Hartmann’s body. A moment later, she raised her eyes and fixed them on Simkins. “No sign of Langdon or Katherine? Or Peter Solomon?” Simkins shook his head. “If they’re still alive, he took them with him.” “Did you see a computer in the house?” “Yes, ma’am. In the office.” “Show me.” Simkins led Sato out of the foyer and into the livi ng room. The plush carpet was covered with broken g lass from the shattered bay window. They walked past a f ireplace, a large painting, and several bookshelves to an office door. The office was wood paneled, with an a ntique desk and a large computer monitor. Sato walk ed around behind the desk and eyed the screen, immedia tely scowling. “Damn it,” she said under her breath. Simkins circled around and looked at the screen. It was blank. “What’s wrong?” Sato pointed to an empty docking station on the des k. “He uses a laptop. He took it with him.” Simkins didn’t follow. “Does he have information yo u want to see?” “No,” Sato replied, her tone grave. “He has informa tion I want nobody to see.” Downstairs in the hidden basement, Katherine Solomo n had heard the sounds of helicopter blades followe d by breaking glass and heavy boots on the floor abov e her. She tried to cry out for help, but the gag i n her mouth made it impossible. She could barely make a s ound. The harder she tried, the faster the blood be gan flowing from her elbow. She was feeling short of breath and a little dizzy. Katherine knew she needed to calm down. Use your mind, Katherine. With all of her intention, she coaxed herself into a meditative state. Robert Langdon’s mind floated through the emptiness of space. He peered into the infinite void, search ing for any points of reference. He found nothing. Total darkness. Total silence. Total peace. There was not even the pull of gravity to tell him which way was up. His body was gone. This must be death. Time seemed to be telescoping, stretching and compr essing, as if it had no bearings in this place. He had lost all track of how much time had passed. Ten seconds? Ten minutes? Ten days? "},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Suddenly, however, like distant fiery explosions in far - off galaxies, memories began to materialize, billow ing toward Langdon like shock waves across a vast nothi ngness. All at once, Robert Langdon began to remember. The images tore through him . . . vivid and disturbing. He was staring up at a face that was covered with tatt oos. A pair of powerful hands lifted his head and s mashed it into the floor. Pain erupted . . . and then darkness. Gray light. Throbbing. Wisps of memory. Langdon was being dragged, half co nscious, down, down, down. His captor was chanting something. Verbum significatium . . . Verbum omnificum . . . V erbum perdo . . . CHAPTER 110 Director Sato stood alone in the study, waiting while the CIA sa tellite-imaging division processed her request. One of the luxuries of working in the D.C. area was the satellite coverage. With luck, one of them might have been properly positioned to get photos o f this home tonight . . . possibly capturing a vehi cle leaving the place in the last half hour. “Sorry, ma’am,” the satellite technician said. “No coverage of those coordinates tonight. Do you want to make a reposition request?” “No thanks. Too late.” She hung up. Sato exhaled, now having no idea how they would fig ure out where their target had gone. She walked out to the foyer, where her men had bagged Agent Hartmann’ s body and were carrying it toward the chopper. Sat o had ordered Agent Simkins to gather his men and pre pare for the return to Langley, but Simkins was in the living room on his hands and knees. He looked like he was ill. “You okay?” He glanced up, an odd look on his face. “Did you se e this?” He pointed at the living-room floor. Sato came over and looked down at the plush carpet. She shook her head, seeing nothing. “Crouch down,” Simkins said. “Look at the nap of th e carpet.” She did. After a moment, she saw it. The fibers of the carpet looked like they had been mashed down . . . depressed along two straight lines as if the wheels of something heavy had been rolled across the room . “The strange thing,” Simkins said, “is where the tracks go.” He pointed. Sato’s gaze followed the faint parallel lines acros s the living-room carpet. The tracks seemed to disa ppear beneath a large floor-to-ceiling painting that hung beside the fireplace. What in the world? "},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Simkins walked over to the painting and tried to li ft it down from the wall. It didn ’ t budge. “ It ’ s fixed, ” he said, now running his fingers around the edges. “Ho ld on, there’s something underneath . . .” His fing er hit a small lever beneath the bottom edge, and something clicked. Sato stepped forward as Simkins pushed the frame an d the entire painting rotated slowly on its center, like a revolving door. He raised his flashlight and shined it into the dar k space beyond. Sato’s eyes narrowed. Here we go. At the end of a short corridor stood a heavy metal door. The memories that had billowed through the blacknes s of Langdon’ s mind had come and gone. In their wake, a trail of red-hot sparks was swirling, along with the same eerie, distant whisper. Verbum significatium . . . Verbum omnificum . . . V erbum perdo. The chanting continued like the drone of voices in a medieval canticle. Verbum significatium . . . Verbum omnificum. The words now tumbled through the empty void, fres h voices echoing all around him. Apocalypsis . . . Franklin . . . Apocalypsis . . . Verbum . . . Apocalypsis . . . Without warning, a mournful bell began tolling some where in the distance. The bell rang on and on, gro wing louder. It tolled more urgently now, as if hoping L angdon would understand, as if urging his mind to f ollow. CHAPTER 111 The tolling bell in the clock tower rang for three full minutes, ra ttling the crystal chandelier that hung above Langdon’s head. Decades ago, he had attended lectur es in this well-loved assembly hall at Phillips Exe ter Academy. Today, however, he was here to listen to a dear friend address the student body. As the light s dimmed, Langdon took a seat against the back wall, beneath a pantheon of headmaster portraits. A hush fell across the crowd. In total darkness, a tall, shadowy figure crossed t he stage and took the podium. “Good morning,” the faceless voice whispered into the microphone. Everyone sat up, straining to see who was addressin g them. A slide projector flashed to life, revealing a fade d sepia photograph—a dramatic castle with a red san dstone facade, high square towers, and Gothic embellishmen ts. The shadow spoke again. “Who can tell me where this is?” “England!” a girl declared in the darkness. “This f acade is a blend of early Gothic and late Romanesqu e, making this the quintessential Norman castle and placing it in England at about the twel fth century.” “ Wow, ” the faceless voice replied. “ Someone knows her architecture. ”"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" Quiet groans all around. “Unfortunately,” the shadow added, “you missed by t hree thousand miles and half a millennium.” The room perked up. The projector now flashed a full-color, modern phot o of the same castle from a different angle. The ca stle’s Seneca Creek sandstone towers dominated the foregro und, but in the background, startlingly close, stoo d the majestic, white, columned dome of the U.S. Capitol Building. “Hold on!” the girl exclaimed. “There’s a Norman ca stle in D.C.?!” “Since 1855,” the voice replied. “Which is when thi s next photo was taken.” A new slide appeared—a black-and-white interior sho t, depicting a massive vaulted ballroom, furnished with animal skeletons, scientific display cases, glass j ars with biological samples, archaeological artifac ts, and plaster casts of prehistoric reptiles. “This wondrous castle,” the voice said, “was Americ a’s first real science museum. It was a gift to Ame rica from a wealthy British scientist who, like our fore fathers, believed our fledgling country could becom e the land of enlightenment. He bequeathed to our forefat hers a massive fortune and asked them to build at t he core of our nation ‘an establishment for the increa se and diffusion of knowledge.’ ” He paused a long moment. “Who can tell me the name of this generous scientist?” A timid voice in front ventured, “James Smithson ?” A whisper of recognition rippled through the crowd. “Smithson indeed,” the man on stage replied. Peter S olomon now stepped into the light, his gray eyes flashing playfully. “Good morning. My name is Peter Solomon, and I am secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.” The students broke into wild applause. In the shadows, Langdon watched with admiration as Peter captivated the young minds with a photographi c tour of the Smithsonian Institution’s early history . The show began with Smithsonian Castle, its basem ent science labs, corridors lined with exhibits, a salo n full of mollusks, scientists who called themselve s “the curators of crustaceans,” and even an old photo of the castle’s two most popular residents—a pair of n ow- deceased owls named Diffusion and Increase. The hal f-hour slide show ended with an impressive satellit e photo of the National Mall, now lined with enormous Smithsonian museums. “As I said when I began,” Solomon stated in conclus ion, “ James Smithson and our forefathers envisioned our great country to be a land of enlightenment. I beli eve today they would be proud. Their great Smithson ian Institution stands as a symbol of science and knowl edge at the very core of America. It is a living, b reathing, working tribute to our forefathers’ dream for Ameri ca—a country founded on the principles of knowledge , wisdom, and science.” Solomon clicked off the slides to an energetic roun d of applause. The houselights came up, along with dozens of eager hands with questions. Solomon called on a small red-haired boy in the mid dle. “Mr. Solomon?” the boy said, sounding puzzled. “You said our forefathers fled the religious oppression of Europe to establish a country on the principles of scientific advancement.” “That’s correct.” "},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"“ But . . . I was under the impression our forefather s were devoutly religious men who founded America a s a Christian nation.” Solomon smiled. “My friends, don’t get me wrong, ou r forefathers were deeply religious men, but they w ere Deists—men who believed in God, but in a universal and open-minded way. The only religious ideal they put forth was religious freedom .” He pulled the microphone from the podium and str ode out to the edge of the stage. “America’s forefathers had a vision of a spiritually enlightened utopia, in which freedom o f thought, education of the masses, and scientific ad vancement would replace the darkness of outdated religious superstition.” A blond girl in back raised her hand. “Yes?” “Sir,” the girl said, holding up her cell phone, “I ’ve been researching you online, and Wikipedia says you’re a prominent Freemason.” Solomon held up his Masonic ring. “I could have sav ed you the data charges.” The students laughed. “Yes, well,” the girl continued, hesitating, “you j ust mentioned ‘outdated religious superstition,’ and it seems to me that if anyone is responsible for propagating outdated superstiti ons . . . it would be the Masons.” Solomon seemed unfazed. “Oh? How so?” “Well, I’ve read a lot about Masonry, and I know yo u’ve got a lot of strange ancient rituals and belie fs. This article online even says that Masons believe in the power of some kind of ancient magical wisdom . . . which can elevate man to the realm of the gods?” Everyone turned and stared at the girl as if she we re nuts. “Actually,” Solomon said, “she’s right.” The kids all spun around and faced front, eyes wide ning. Solomon suppressed a smile and asked the girl, “Doe s it offer any other Wiki-wisdom about this magical knowledge?” The girl looked uneasy now, but she began to read f rom the Web site. “‘To ensure this powerful wisdom could not be used by the unworthy, the early adepts wrote down their knowledge in code . . . cloaking its potent truth in a metaphorical language of symbols, myth, and allegory. To this day, this encrypted wi sdom is all around us . . . encoded in our mythology, our a rt, and the occult texts of the ages. Unfortunately , modern man has lost the ability to decipher this complex n etwork of symbolism . . . and the great truth has b een lost.’” Solomon waited. “That’s all?” The girl shifted in her seat. “Actually, there is a little bit more.” “I should hope so. Please . . . tell us.” The girl looked hesitant, but she cleared her throa t and continued. “‘According to legend, the sages w ho encrypted the Ancient Mysteries long ago left behin d a key of sorts . . . a password that could be used to unlock the encrypted secrets. This magical password —known as the verbum significatium —is said to hold the power to lift the darkness and unlock the Ancie nt Mysteries, opening them to all human understandi ng.’ ” Solomon smiled wistfully. “ Ah, yes . . . the verbum significatium. ” He stared into space for a moment and"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"then lowered his eyes again to the blond girl. “ And where is this wonderful word now? ” The girl looked apprehensive, clearly wishing she h ad not challenged their guest speaker. She finished reading. “ ‘Legend holds that the verbum significatium is buried deep underground, where it waits patient ly for a pivotal moment in history . . . a moment when mankind can no longer survive without the truth, knowledge, and wisdom of the ages. At this dark cro ssroads, mankind will at last unearth the Word and herald in a wondrous new age of enlightenment.’ ” The girl turned off her phone and shrank down in he r seat. After a long silence, another student raised his ha nd. “Mr. Solomon, you don’t actually believe that, right?” Solomon smiled. “Why not? Our mythologies have a lo ng tradition of magic words that provide insight an d godlike powers. To this day, children still shout ‘ abracadabra’ in hopes of creating something out of nothing. Of course, we’ve all forgotten that this word is no t a toy; it has roots in ancient Aramaic mysticism— Avrah KaDabra —meaning ‘I create as I speak.’ ” Silence. “But, sir,” the student now pressed, “surely you don ’t believe that a single word . . . this verbum significatium . . . whatever it is . . . has the power to unlock ancient wisdom . . . and bring about a worldwide enlightenment?” Peter Solomon’s face revealed nothing. “My own beli efs should not concern you. What should concern you is that this prophecy of a coming enlightenment is echoed in virtually every faith and philosophical t radition on earth. Hindus call it the Krita Age, astrologers call it the Age of Aquarius, the Jews describe the coming of the Messiah, theosophists call it the New Age, c osmologists call it Harmonic Convergence and predic t the actual date.” “December 21, 2012!” someone called. “Yes, unnervingly soon . . . if you’re a believer in Mayan math.” Langdon chuckled, recalling how Solomon, ten years ago, had correctly predicted the current spate of television specials predicting that the year 2012 w ould mark the End of the World. “Timing aside,” Solomon said, “I find it wondrous t o note that throughout history, all of mankind’s di sparate philosophies have all concurred on one thing—that a great enlightenment is coming. In eve ry culture, in every era, in every corner of the world, the human dream has focused on the same exact concept—the coming apotheosis of man . . . the impending transf ormation of our human minds into their true potenti ality.” He smiled. “What could possibly explain such a sync hronicity of beliefs?” “Truth,” said a quiet voice in the crowd. Solomon wheeled. “Who said that?” The hand that went up belonged to a tiny Asian boy whose soft features suggested he might be Nepalese or Tibetan. “Maybe there is a universal truth embedded in everyone’s soul. Maybe we all have the same story hiding inside, like a shared constant in our DNA. M aybe this collective truth is responsible for the similarity in all of our stories.” Solomon was beaming as he pressed his hands togethe r and bowed reverently to the boy. “Thank you.” Everyone was quiet. “Truth,” Solomon said, addressing the room. “Truth has power. And if we all gravitate toward similar i deas, maybe we do so because those ideas are true . . . written deep within us. And when we hear the truth, even if we don ’ t understand it, we feel that truth resonate within us . . . vibrating with our unconscious wisdom."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Perhaps the truth is not learned by us, but rather, the truth is re - called . . . re - membered . . . re - cognized . . . as that which is already inside us.” The silence in the hall was complete. Solomon let it sit for a long moment, then quietly said, “ In closing, I should warn you that unveiling the tr uth is never easy. Throughout history, every period of enlightenment has been accompanied by darkness, pushing in opposition. Such are the laws of nature and balance. And if we look at the darkness growing in the world today, we have to realize that this means the re is equal light growing. We are on the verge of a truly great period of illumination, and all of us—all of you —are profoundly blessed to be living through this pivotal moment of history. Of all the people who ha ve ever lived, in all the eras in history . . . we are in that narrow window of time during which we will bear wit ness to our ultimate renaissance. After millennia o f darkness, we will see our sciences, our minds, and even our religions unveil the truth.” Solomon was about to get a hearty round of applause when he held up his hand for silence. “Miss?” He pointed directly to the contentious blond girl in b ack with the cell phone. “I know you and I didn’t a gree on much, but I want to thank you. Your passion is an i mportant catalyst in the coming changes. Darkness f eeds on apathy . . . and conviction is our most potent a ntidote. Keep studying your faith. Study the Bible. ” He smiled. “Especially the final pages.” “The Apocalypse?” she said. “Absolutely. The Book of Revelation is a vibrant ex ample of our shared truth . The last book of the Bible tells the identical story as countless other traditions. They all predict the coming unveiling of great wisd om.” Someone else said, “But isn’t the Apocalypse about the end of the world? You know, the Antichrist, Armageddon, the final battle between good and evil? ” Solomon chuckled. “Who here studies Greek?” Several hands went up. “What does the word apocalypse literally mean?” “It means,” one student began, and then paused as i f surprised. “ Apocalypse means ‘to unveil’ . . . or ‘to reveal.’ ” Solomon gave the boy a nod of approval. “Exactly. T he Apocalypse is literally a reveal-ation. The Book of Reveal-ation in the Bible predicts an unveiling of great truth and unimaginable wisdom. The Apocalypse is not the end of the world, but rather it is the end of the world as we know it. The prophecy of the Apocalypse is just one of the Bible’s beautiful messages that has been distorted.” Solomon stepped to the front o f the stage. “Believe me, the Apocalypse is coming . . . and it will be nothing like what we w ere taught.” High over his head, the bell began to toll. The students erupted into bewildered and thunderous applause. CHAPTER 112 Katherine Solomon was teetering on the edge of consciousness when sh e was jolted by the shock wave of a deafening explosion."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" Moments later, she smelled smoke. Her ears were ringing. There were muffled voices. Distant. Shouting. Foots teps. Suddenly she was breathing more clearly. The cloth had been pulled from her mouth. “You’re safe,” a man’s voice whispered. “Just hold on.” She expected the man to pull the needle out of her arm but instead he was yelling orders. “Bring the m edical kit . . . attach an IV to the needle . . . infuse l actated Ringer’s solution . . . get me a blood pres sure.” As the man began checking her vital signs, he said, “Ms. S olomon, the person who did this to you . . . where did he go?” Katherine tried to speak, but she could not. “Ms. Solomon?” the voice repeated. “Where did he go ?” Katherine tried to pry her eyes open, but she felt herself fading. “We need to know where he went,” the man urged. Katherine whispered three words in response, althou gh she knew they made no sense. “The . . . sacred . . . mountain.” Director Sato stepped over the mangled steel door a nd descended a wooden ramp into the hidden basement . One of her agents met her at the bottom. “Director, I think you’ll want to see this.” Sato followed the agent into a small room off the n arrow hallway. The room was brightly lit and barren , except for a pile of clothing on the floor. She rec ognized Robert Langdon’s tweed coat and loafers. Her agent pointed toward the far wall at a large, c asketlike container. What in the world? Sato moved toward the container, seeing now that it was fed by a clear plastic pipe that ran through t he wall. Warily, she approached the tank. Now she could see that it had a small slider on top . She reached down and slid the covering to one sid e, revealing a small portal-like window. Sato recoiled. Beneath the Plexiglas . . . floated the submerged, vacant face of Professor Robert Langdon. Light! The endless void in which Langdon hovered was sudde nly filled by a blinding sun. Rays of white-hot lig ht streamed across the blackness of space, burning int o his mind. The light was everywhere. Suddenly, within the radiant cloud before him, a be autiful silhouette appeared. It was a face . . . bl urry and indistinct . . . two eyes staring at him across the void. Streams of light surrounded the face, and La ngdon wondered if he was looking into the face of God."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":" Sato stared down into the tank, wondering if Profes sor Langdon had any idea what had happened. She doubted it. After all, disorientation was the entir e purpose of this technology. Sensory- deprivation tanks had been around since the fifties and were still a popular getaway for wealthy New Age experimenters. “Floating,” as it was called, of fered a transcendental back-to-the-womb experience . . . a kind of meditative aid that quieted brain activity by removing all sensory input—light, sound, touch, and even the pull of gravity. In traditional tanks, the person would float on his back in a hyperbuoyant s aline solution that kept his face above the water so he c ould breathe. In recent years, however, these tanks had taken a q uantum leap. Oxygenated perfluorocarbons. This new technology—known as Total Liquid Ventilati on (TLV)—was so counterintuitive that few believed it existed. Breathable liquid. Liquid breathing had been a reality since 1966, whe n Leland C. Clark successfully kept alive a mouse t hat had been submerged for several hours in an oxygenat ed perfluorocarbon. In 1989, TLV technology made a dramatic appearance in the movie The Abyss , although few viewers realized that they were watc hing real science. Total Liquid Ventilation had been born of modern me dicine’s attempts to help premature babies breathe by returning them to the liquid-filled state of the wo mb. Human lungs, having spent nine months in utero, were no strangers to a liquid-filled state. Perfluorocar bons had once been too viscous to be fully breathab le, but modern breakthroughs had made breathable liquids al most the consistency of water. The CIA’s Directorate of Science and Technology—“th e Wizards of Langley,” as they were known within the intelligence community—had worked extensively w ith oxygenated perfluorocarbons to develop technologies for the U.S. military. The navy’s elit e deep- ocean diving teams found that breathing oxygenated liquid, rather than the usual heliox or trimix, gav e them the ability to dive to much greater depths w ithout risk of pressure sickness. Similarly, NASA and the air f orce had learned that pilots equipped with a liquid breathing apparatus rather than a traditional oxyge n tank could withstand far higher g-forces than usu al because liquid spread the g-force more evenly throu ghout the internal organs than gas did. Sato had heard that there were now “extreme experie nce labs” where one could try these Total Liquid Ventilation tanks—“Meditation Machines,” as they wer e called. This particular tank had probably been installed for its owner’s private experimentation, although the addition of heavy, lockable latches le ft little doubt in Sato’s mind that this tank had also been used for darker applications . . . an interrogation technique with which the CIA was familiar. The infamous interrogation technique of water board ing was highly effective because the victim truly believed he was drowning. Sato knew of several classified o perations in which sensory- deprivation tanks like these had been used to enhance that illusion to ter rifying new levels. A victim submerged in breathabl e liquid could literally be “drowned.” The panic associated with the drowning experience usually made the victi m unaware that the liquid he was breathing was slight ly more viscous than water. When the liquid poured into his lungs, he would often black out from fear, and then awaken in the ultimate “solitary confinement.” Topical numbing agents, paralysis drugs, and halluc inogens were mixed with the warm oxygenated liquid to give the prisoner the sense he was entirely separat ed from his body. When his mind sent commands to mo ve his limbs, nothing happened. The state of being “de ad” was terrifying on its own, but the true disorie ntation came from the “rebirthing” process, which, with the aid of bright lights, cold air, and deafening nois e, could be extremely traumatic and painful. After a handful of rebirths and subsequent drownings, the prisoner became so disorientated that he had no idea if he w as alive or dead . . . and he would tell the interr ogator absolutely anything. "},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Sato wondered if she should wait for a medical team to extract Langdon, but she knew she didn ’ t have time. I need to know what he knows. “Turn out the lights,” she said. “And find me some blankets.” The blinding sun had vanished. The face had also disappeared. The blackness had returned, but Langdon could now h ear distant whispers echoing across the light-years of emptiness. Muffled voices . . . unintelligible word s. There were vibrations now . . . as if the world were about to shake apart. Then it happened. Without warning, the universe was ripped in two. An enormous chasm opened in the void . . . as if spac e itself had ruptured at the seams. A grayish mist po ured through the opening, and Langdon saw a terrify ing sight. Disembodied hands were suddenly reaching for him, grabbing his body, trying to yank him out of his world. No! He tried to fight them off, but he had no arms . . . no fists. Or did he? Suddenly he felt his body materializing around his mind. His flesh had return ed and it was being seized by powerful hands that w ere dragging him upward. No! Please! But it was too late. Pain racked his chest as the hands heaved him throu gh the opening. His lungs felt like they were fille d with sand. I can’t breathe! He was suddenly on his back on the coldest, hardes t surface he could imagine. Something was pressing on his chest, over and over, hard and painful. He was spewing out the warmth. I want to go back. He felt like he was a child being born from a womb. He was convulsing, coughing up liquid. He felt pain in his chest and neck. Excruciating pain. His thro at was on fire. People were talking, trying to whisper, bu t it was deafening. His vision was blurred, and all he could see was muted shapes. His skin felt numb, like dead leather. His chest felt heavier now . . . pressure. I can’t breathe! He was coughing up more liquid. An overwhelming gag reflex seized him, and he gasped inward. Cold air poured into his lungs, and he felt like a newborn t aking his first breath on earth. This world was exc ruciating. All Langdon wanted was to return to the womb. Robert Langdon had no idea how much time had passed . He could feel now that he was lying on his side, wrapped in towels and blankets on a hard floor. A f amiliar face was gazing down at him . . . but the s treams of glorious light were gone. The echoes of distant chanting still hung in his mind. Verbum significatium . . . Verbum omnificum . . . “Professor Langdon,” someone whispered. “Do you kno w where you are?” Langdon nodded weakly, still coughing. More important, he had begun to realize what was go ing on tonight. "},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 113 Wrapped in wool blankets, Langdon stood on wobbly legs and st ared down at the open tank of liquid. His body had returned to him, although he wished it had not. His throat and lungs burned. This world felt hard and cruel. Sato had just explained the sensory-deprivation tan k . . . adding that if she had not pulled him out, he would have died of starvation, or worse. Langdon had litt le doubt that Peter had endured a similar experienc e. Peter is in the in-between, the tattooed man had told him earlier tonight. He is in purgatory . . . Hamistagan. If Peter had endured more than one of those birthing p rocesses, Langdon would not have been surprised if Peter had told his captor anything he had wanted to know. Sato motioned for Langdon to follow her, and he did , trudging slowly down a narrow hall, deeper into t his bizarre lair that he was now seeing for the first t ime. They entered a square room with a stone table and eerie- colored lighting. Katherine was here, and Langdon h eaved a sigh of relief. Even so, the scene was worrisome. Katherine was lying on her back on a stone table. B lood-soaked towels lay on the floor. A CIA agent wa s holding an IV bag above her, the tube connected to her arm. She was sobbing quietly. “Katherine?” Langdon croaked, barely able to speak. She turned her head, looking disorientated and conf used. “Robert?!” Her eyes widened with disbelief an d then joy. “But I . . . saw you drown!” He moved toward the stone table. Katherine pulled herself to a seated position, igno ring her IV tube and the medical objections of the agent. Langdon reached the table, and Katherine reached ou t, wrapping her arms around his blanket-clad body, holding him close. “Thank God,” she whispered, kiss ing his cheek. Then she kissed him again, squeezing him as though she didn’t believe he was real. “I do n’t understand . . . how . . .” Sato began saying something about sensory-deprivati on tanks and oxygenated perfluorocarbons, but Katherine clearly wasn’t listening. She just held L angdon close. “Robert,” she said, “Peter’s alive.” Her voice wave red as she recounted her horrifying reunion with Pe ter. She described his physical condition—the wheelchair , the strange knife, the allusions to some kind of “sacrifice,” and how she had been left bleeding as a human hourglass to persuade Peter to cooperate qu ickly. Langdon could barely speak. “Do you . . . have any idea where . . . they went?!” “He said he was taking Peter to the sacred mountain .” Langdon pulled away and stared at her. Katherine had tears in her eyes. “He said he had de ciphered the grid on the bottom of the pyramid, and that the pyramid told him to go to the sacred mountain.” “Professor,” Sato pressed, “does that mean anything to you?” Langdon shook his head. “ Not at all. ” Still, he felt a surge of hope. “ But if he got the information off the"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"bottom of the pyramid, we can get it, too. ” I told him how to solve it. Sato shook her head. “The pyramid’s gone. We’ve loo ked. He took it with him.” Langdon remained silent a moment, closing his eyes and trying to recall what he had seen on the base o f the pyramid. The grid of symbols had been one of the la st images he had seen before drowning, and trauma h ad a way of burning memories deeper into the mind. He co uld recall some of the grid, definitely not all of it, but maybe enough? He turned to Sato and said hurriedly, “I may be abl e to remember enough, but I need you to look up something on the Internet.” She pulled out her BlackBerry. “Run a search for ‘The Order Eight Franklin Square. ’ ” Sato gave him a startled look but began typing with out questions. Langdon’s vision was still blurry, and he was only now starting to process his strange surroundings. H e realized that the stone table on which they were le aning was covered with old bloodstains, and the wal l to his right was entirely plastered with pages of text, ph otos, drawings, maps, and a giant web of strings interconnecting them. My God. Langdon moved toward the strange collage, still clu tching the blankets around his body. Tacked on the wall was an utterly bizarre collection of information—pa ges from ancient texts ranging from black magic to Christian Scripture, drawings of symbols and sigils , pages of conspiracy-theory Web sites, and satelli te photos of Washington, D.C., scrawled with notes and question marks. One of the sheets was a long list of words in many languages. He recognized some of them as sacred Masonic words, others as ancient magic words, and others from ceremonial incantations. Is that what he ’s looking for? A word? Is it that simple? Langdon’s long-standing skepticism about the Masoni c Pyramid was based largely on what it allegedly revealed—the location of the Ancient Mysteries. Thi s discovery would have to involve an enormous vault filled with thousands upon thousands of volumes tha t had somehow survived the long- lost ancient libraries in which they had once been stored. It all seemed impo ssible. A vault that big? Beneath D.C.? Now, however, his recollection of Peter’s lecture at Phillips Exe ter, combined with these lists of magic words, had opened another startling possibility . Langdon most definitely did not believe in the power of magic words . . . and yet it seemed pretty clear that the tattooed man did. His pulse quickened as he aga in scanned the scrawled notes, the maps, the texts, the printouts, and all the interconnected strings and s ticky notes. Sure enough, there was one recurring theme. My God, he’s looking for the verbum significatium . . . the Lost Word. Langdon let the thought take shape, recalling fragments of Peter’s lecture. The Lost Word is what he’s looking for! That’s what he believes is buried here in Washington. Sato arrived beside him. “Is this what you asked fo r?” She handed him her BlackBerry. Langdon looked at the eight - by - eight grid of numbers on the screen. “ Exactly. ” He grabbed a piece of scrap"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"paper. “ I ’ ll need a pen. ” Sato handed him one from her pocket. “Please hurry. ” Inside the basement office of the Directorate of Sc ience and Technology, Nola Kaye was once again stud ying the redacted document brought to her by sys-sec Ric k Parrish. What the hell is the CIA director doing with a file about ancient pyramids and secret underground locations? She grabbed the phone and dialed. Sato answered instantly, sounding tense. “Nola, I w as just about to call you.” “I have new information,” Nola said. “I’m not sure how this fits, but I’ve discovered there’s a redact ed—” “Forget it, whatever it is,” Sato interrupted. “We’ re out of time. We failed to apprehend the target, and I have every reason to believe he’s about to carry out his threat.” Nola felt a chill. “The good news is we know exactly where he’s going. ” Sato took a deep breath. “The bad news is that he ’s carrying a laptop with him.” CHAPTER 114 Less than ten miles away, Mal’akh tucked the blanket around Peter Solomon and wheeled him across a moonlit parking lot into the shadow of an enormous building. The structure had exactly thirty-three ou ter columns . . . each precisely thirty-three feet tall . The mountainous structure was deserted at this ho ur, and nobody would ever see them back here. Not that it m attered. From a distance, no one would think twice about a tall, kindly-looking man in a long black co at taking a bald invalid for an evening stroll. When they reached the rear entrance, Mal’akh wheele d Peter up close to the security keypad. Peter star ed at it defiantly, clearly having no intention of enteri ng the code. Mal’akh laughed. “You think you’re here to let me i n? Have you forgotten so soon that I am one of your brethren?” He reached out and typed the access code that he had been given after his initiation to the thirty- third degree. The heavy door clicked open. Peter groaned and began struggling in the wheelchai r. “Peter, Peter,” Mal’akh cooed. “ Picture Katherine. Be cooperative, and she will liv e. You can save her. I give you my word.” Mal’akh wheeled his captive inside and relocked the door behind them, his heart racing now with anticipation. He pushed Peter through some hallways to an elevator and pressed the call button. The do ors opened, and Mal’akh backed in, pulling the wheelcha ir along with him. Then, making sure Peter could se e what he was doing, he reached out and pressed the u ppermost button. A look of deepening dread crossed Peter’s tortured face. "},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"“ Shh . . . ” Mal ’ akh whispered, gently stroking Peter ’ s shaved head as the elevator doors closed. “ As you well know . . . the secret is how to die.” I can ’t remember all the symbols! Langdon closed his eyes, doing his best to recall t he precise locations of the symbols on the bottom o f the stone pyramid, but even his eidetic memory did not have that degree of recall. He wrote down the few symbols he could remember, placing each one in the location indicated by Franklin’s magic square. So far, however, he saw nothing that made any sense . “Look!” Katherine urged. “You must be on the right track. The first row is all Greek letters—the same kinds of symbols are being arranged together!” Langdon had noticed this, too, but he could not thi nk of any Greek word that fit that configuration of letters and spaces. I need the first letter. He glanced again at the magic square, trying to re call the letter that had been in the number one spot near the lower left cor ner. Think! He closed his eyes, trying to picture the base of the pyramid. The bottom row . . . next to the left-hand corner . . . what letter was there? For an instant, Langdon was back in the tank, racke d with terror, staring up through the Plexiglas at the bottom of the pyramid. Now, suddenly, he saw it. He opened his eyes, breat hing heavily. “The first letter is H !” Langdon turned back to the grid and wrote in the fi rst letter. The word was still incomplete, but he h ad seen enough. Suddenly he realized what the word might be . μ ! Pulse pounding, Langdon typed a new search into the BlackBerry. He entered the English equivalent of t his well-known Greek word. The first hit that appeared was an encyclopedia entry. He read it and knew it h ad to be right. HEREDOM n. a significant word in “ high degree ” Freemasonry, from French Rose Croix rituals, where it"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"refers to a mythical mountain in Scotland, the lege ndary site of the first such Chapter. From the Gree k μ originating from Hieros-domos, Greek for Holy House . “That’s it!” Langdon exclaimed, incredulous. “That’ s where they went!” Sato had been reading over his shoulder and looked lost. “To a mythical mountain in Scotland?!” Langdon shook his head. “No, to a building in Washi ngton whose code name is Heredom.” CHAPTER 115 The House of the Temple—known among its brethren as Heredom— had always been the crown jewel of the Masonic Scottish Rite in America. With its steeply sloped, pyramidical roof, the building was named fo r an imaginary Scottish mountain. Mal’akh knew, however, there was nothing imaginary about the treasure hidden here. This is the place, he knew. The Masonic Pyramid has shown the way. As the old elevator slowly made its way to the thir d floor, Mal’akh took out the piece of paper on whi ch he had reorganized the grid of symbols using the Frank lin Square. All the Greek letters had now shifted t o the first row . . . along with one simple symbol. The message could not have been more clear. Beneath the House of the Temple. Heredom The Lost Word is here . . . somewhere. Although Mal’akh did not know precisely how to loca te it, he was confident that the answer lay in the remaining symbols on the grid. Conveniently, when i t came to unlocking the secrets of the Masonic Pyra mid and of this building, no one was more qualified to help than Peter Solomon. The Worshipful Master himself. Peter continued to struggle in the wheelchair, maki ng muffled sounds through his gag. “I know you’re worried about Katherine,” Mal’akh sa id. “But it’s almost over.” For Mal’akh, the end felt like it had arrived very suddenly. After all the years of pain and planning, waiting and searching . . . the moment had now arrived. The elevator began to slow, and he felt a rush of e xcitement. The carriage jolted to a stop."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":" The bronze doors slid open, and Mal’ akh gazed out at the glorious chamber before them. The massive square room was adorned with symbols and bathed in moonlig ht, which shone down through the oculus at the pinnacle of the ceiling high above. I have come full circle, Mal’akh thought. The Temple Room was the same place in which Peter S olomon and his brethren had so foolishly initiated Mal’akh as one of their own. Now the Masons’ most s ublime secret— something that most of the brethren did not even believe existed—was about to be unearthed. “He won’t find anything,” Langdon said, still feeli ng groggy and disorientated as he followed Sato and the others up the wooden ramp out of the basement. “The re is no actual Word . It’s all a metaphor—a symbol of the Ancient Mysteries.” Katherine followed, with two agents assisting her w eakened body up the ramp. As the group moved gingerly through the wreckage of the steel door, through the rotating painting, and into the living room, Langdon explained to Sato that the Lost Word was one of Freemasonry’s most enduring symbols—a single word, written in an arcane languag e that man could no longer decipher. The Word, like the Mysteries themselves, promised to unveil its hi dden power only to those enlightened enough to decr ypt it. “It is said,” Langdon concluded, “that if you can p ossess and understand the Lost Word . . . then the Ancient Mysteries will become clear to you.” Sato glanced over. “So you believe this man is look ing for a word ?” Langdon had to admit it sounded absurd at face valu e, and yet it answered a lot of questions. “Look, I ’m no specialist in ceremonial magic,” he said, “but from the documents on his basement walls . . . and from Katherine’s description of the untattooed flesh on his head . . . I’d say he’s hoping to find the Lost Word and inscribe it on his body.” Sato moved the group toward the dining room. Outsid e, the helicopter was warming up, its blades thunde ring louder and louder. Langdon kept talking, thinking aloud. “If this guy truly believes he is about to unlock the power of t he Ancient Mysteries, no symbol would be more potent i n his mind than the Lost Word. If he could find it and inscribe it on the top of his head—a sacred locatio n in itself—then he would no doubt consider himself perfectly adorned and ritualistically prepared to . . .” He paused, seeing Katherine blanch at the tho ught of Peter’s impending fate. “But, Robert,” she said weakly, her voice barely au dible over the helicopter blades. “This is good news , right? If he wants to inscribe the Lost Word on the top of his head before he sacrifices Peter, then w e have time. He won’t kill Peter until he finds the Word. And, if there is no Word . . .” Langdon tried to look hopeful as the agents helped Katherine into a chair. “Unfortunately, Peter still thinks you’re bleeding to death. He thinks the only way to save you is to cooperate with this lunatic . . .pr obably to help him find the Lost Word.” “So what?” she insisted. “If the Word doesn’t exist —” “Katherine,” Langdon said, staring deeply into her e yes. “If I believed you were dying, and if someone promised me I could save you by finding the Lost Wo rd, then I would find this man a word— any word— and then I’d pray to God he kept his promise.” “Director Sato!” an agent shouted from the next roo m. “You’d better see this!” Sato hurried out of the dining room and saw one of her agents coming down the stairs from the bedroom. He was carrying a blond wig. What the hell?"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":" “Man’s hairpiece,” he said, handing it to her. “Fou nd it in the dressing room. Have a close look.” The blond wig was much heavier than Sato expected. The skullcap seemed to be molded of a thick gel. Strangely, the underside of the wig had a wire prot ruding from it. “Gel-pack battery that molds to your scalp,” the ag ent said. “Powers a fiber-optic pinpoint camera hid den in the hair.” “What?” Sato felt around with her fingers until she found the tiny camera lens nestled invisibly withi n the blond bangs. “This thing’s a hidden camera?” “ Video camera,” the agent said. “Stores footage on this t iny solid-state card.” He pointed to a stamp-size square of silicon embedded in the skullcap. “Probab ly motion activated.” Jesus, she thought. So that’s how he did it. This sleek version of the “flower in the lapel” sec ret camera had played a key role in the crisis the OS director was facing tonight. She glared at it a mom ent longer and then handed it back to the agent. “Keep searching the house,” she said. “ I want every bit of information you can find on thi s guy. We know his laptop is missing, and I want to know exactly how he plans to connect it to the outside world while he’s on the move. Search his study for manuals, cables, any thing at all that might give us a clue about his ha rdware.” “Yes, ma’am.” The agent hurried off. Time to move out. Sato could hear the whine of the helicopter blades at full pitch. She hurried back to the dining room, where Simkins had now ushered Warren B ellamy in from the helicopter and was gathering int el from him about the building to which they believed their target had gone. House of the Temple. “The front doors are sealed from within,” Bellamy w as saying, still wrapped in a foil blanket and shiv ering visibly from his time outside in Franklin Square. “ The building’s rear entrance is your only way in. I t’s got a keypad with an access PIN known only to the brother s.” “What’s the PIN?” Simkins demanded, taking notes. Bellamy sat down, looking too feeble to stand. Thro ugh chattering teeth, he recited his access code an d then added, “The address is 1733 Sixteenth, but you’ll w ant the access drive and parking area, behind the building. Kind of tricky to find, but—” “I know exactly where it is,” Langdon said. “I’ll s how you when we get there.” Simkins shook his head. “You’re not coming, Profess or. This is a military—” “The hell I’m not!” Langdon fired back. “Peter’s in there! And that building’s a labyrinth! Without so meone to lead you in, you’ll take ten minutes to find you r way up to the Temple Room!” “He’s right,” Bellamy said. “It’s a maze. There is an elevator, but it’s old and loud and opens in fu ll view of the Temple Room. If you hope to move in quietly, yo u’ll need to ascend on foot.” “You’ll never find your way,” Langdon warned. “From that rear entrance, you’ re navigating through the Hall of Regalia, the Hall of Honor, the middle landing, the Atrium, the Grand Stair—” “Enough,” Sato said. “Langdon’s coming.” "},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 116 The energy was growing. Mal’akh could feel it pulsing within him, moving up and down his body as he wheeled Peter Solomon toward the altar. I will exit this building infinitely more powerful than when I entered. All that remained now was to locate the final ingredient. “Verbum significatium,” he whispered to himself. “Verbum omnificum.” Mal’akh parked Peter’s wheelchair beside the altar and then circled around and unzipped the heavy dayb ag that sat on Peter’s lap. Reaching inside, he lifted out the stone pyramid and held it up in the moonli ght, directly in front of Peter’s eyes, showing him the grid of symbols engraved on the bottom. “All these years,” he taunted, “and you never knew how the pyramid kep t her secrets.” Mal’akh set the pyramid carefully o n the corner of the altar and returned to the bag. “A nd this talisman,” he continued, extracting the gol den capstone, “did indeed bring order from chaos, exact ly as promised.” He placed the metal capstone caref ully atop the stone pyramid, and then stepped back to gi ve Peter a clear view. “Behold, your symbolon is complete.” Peter’s face contorted, and he tried in vain to spe ak. “Good. I can see you have something you’d like to t ell me.” Mal’akh roughly yanked out the gag. Peter Solomon coughed and gasped for several second s before he finally managed to speak. “Katherine . . .” “Katherine’s time is short. If you want to save her , I suggest you do exactly as I say.” Mal’akh suspe cted she was probably already dead, or if not, very close. I t made no difference. She was lucky to have lived l ong enough to say good-bye to her brother. “Please,” Peter begged, his voice ragged. “Send an ambulance for her . . .” “I will do exactly that. But first you must tell me how to access the secret staircase.” Peter’s expression turned to one of disbelief. “Wha t?!” “The staircase. Masonic legend speaks of stairs tha t descend hundreds of feet to the secret location w here the Lost Word is buried.” Peter now looked panicked. “You know the legend,” Mal’akh baited. “A secret st aircase hidden beneath a stone.” He pointed to the central altar—a huge block of granite with a gilded inscription in Hebrew: GOD SAID , “ LET THERE BE LIGHT ” AND THERE WAS LIGHT . “Obviously, this is the right place. The entrance to the staircase must be hidden on one of the floors beneath us.” “There is no secret staircase in this building!” Pe ter shouted. Mal’akh smiled patiently and motioned upward. “This building is shaped like a pyramid.” He pointed to the four-sided vaulted ceiling that angled up to the sq uare oculus in the center. “Yes, the House of the Temple is a pyramid, but wha t does—” "},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"“ Peter, I have all night. ” Mal ’ akh smoothed his white silk robe over his perfect b ody. “ Katherine, however, does not . If you want her to live, you will tell me how to access the staircase.” “I already told you,” he declared, “there is no secret staircase in this building!” “No?” Mal’akh calmly produced the sheet of paper on which he had reorganized the grid of symbols from the base of the pyramid. “This is the Masonic Pyram id’s final message. Your friend Robert Langdon help ed me decipher it.” Mal’akh raised the paper and held it in front of Pe ter’ s eyes. The Worshipful Master inhaled sharply when he saw it. Not only had the sixty-four symbols been or ganized into clearly meaningful groups . . . but an actual image had materialized out of the chaos. An image of a staircase . . . beneath a pyramid. Peter Solomon stared in disbelief at the grid of sy mbols before him. The Masonic Pyramid had kept its secret for generations. Now, suddenly, it was being unveil ed, and he felt a cold sense of foreboding in the p it of his stomach. The pyramid’s final code. At a glance, the true meaning of these symbols rema ined a mystery to Peter, and yet he could immediate ly understand why the tattooed man believed what he be lieved. He thinks there is a hidden staircase beneath the p yramid called Heredom. He misunderstands these symbols. “Where is it?” the tattooed man demanded. “Tell me how to find the staircase, and I will save Katherin e.” I wish I could do that, Peter thought. But the staircase is not real. The myth of the staircase was purely symbolic . . . part of the great allegories of Maso nry. The Winding Staircase, as it was known, appear ed on the second - degree tracing boards. It represented man ’ s intellectual climb toward the Divine Truth. Like"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Jacob ’ s ladder, the Winding Staircase was a symbol of the pathway to heaven . . . the journey of man toward God . . . the connection between the earthly and sp iritual realms. Its steps represented the many virt ues of the mind. He should know that, Peter thought. He endured all the initiations. Every Masonic initiate learned of the symbolic stai rcase that he could ascend, enabling him “to partic ipate in the mysteries of human science.” Freemasonry, like Noetic Science and the Ancient Mysteries, revered t he untapped potential of the human mind, and many of M asonry’s symbols related to human physiology. The mind sits like a golden capstone atop the physi cal body. The Philosopher’s Stone. Through the stai rcase of the spine, energy ascends and descends, circulat ing, connecting the heavenly mind to the physical b ody. Peter knew it was no coincidence that the spine was made up of exactly thirty-three vertebrae. Thirty-three are the degrees of Masonry. The base of the spine, or sacrum, literally meant “sacred bone.” The body is indeed a temple. The human science that Masons revered was the anci ent understanding of how to use that temple for its most potent and noble purpose. Unfortunately, explaining the truth to this man was not going to help Katherine at all. Peter gazed do wn at the grid of symbols and gave a defeated sigh. “You’ re right,” he lied. “There is indeed a secret stair case beneath this building. And as soon as you send help to Katherine, I’ll take you to it.” The man with the tattoos simply stared at him. Solomon glared back, eyes defiant. “Either save my sister and learn the truth . . . or kill us both an d remain ignorant forever!” The man quietly lowered the paper and shook his hea d. “I’m not happy with you, Peter. You failed your test. You still take me for a fool. Do you truly believe I don’t understand what it is I seek? Do you think I have not yet grasped my true potential?” With that, the man turned his back and slipped off his robe. As the white silk fluttered to the floor, Peter saw for the first time the long tattoo running up the m an’s spine. Dear God . . . Winding up from the man’s white loincloth, an elega nt spiral staircase ascended the middle of his musc ular back. Each stair was positioned on a different vert ebra. Speechless, Peter let his eyes ascend the sta ircase, all the way up to the base of the man’s skull. Peter could only stare. The tattooed man now tipped his shaved head backwar d, revealing the circle of bare flesh on the pinnac le of his skull. The virgin skin was bordered by a single snake, looped in a circle, consuming itself. At -one-ment. Slowly now, the man lowered his head and turned to face Peter. The massive double-headed phoenix on hi s chest stared out through dead eyes. “I am looking for the Lost Word,” the man said. “Ar e you going to help me . . . or are you and your si ster going to die?” You know how to find it, Mal’akh thought. You know something you’re not telling me. Peter Solomon had revealed things under interrogati on that he probably didn’t even recall now. The rep eated sessions in and out of the deprivation tank had lef t him delirious and compliant. Incredibly, when he spilled his guts, everything he told Mal ’ akh had been consistent with the legend of the Lost Word."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":" The Lost Word is not a metaphor . . . it is real. T he Word is written in an ancient language . . . and has been hidden for ages. The Word is capable of bringing un fathomable power to anyone who grasps its true meaning. The Word remains hidden to this day . . . and the Masonic Pyramid has the power to unveil it. “Peter,” Mal’akh now said, staring into his captive ’s eyes, “when you looked at that grid of symbols . . . you saw something. You had a revelation. This grid means something to you. Tell me.” “I will tell you nothing until you send help to Kat herine!” Mal’akh smiled at him. “Believe me, the prospect of losing your sister is the least of your worries ri ght now.” Without another word, he turned to Langdon’s daybag and started removing the items he had packed in hi s basement. Then he began meticulously arranging them on the sacrificial altar. A folded silk cloth. Pure white. A silver censer. Egyptian myrrh. A vial of Peter’s blood. Mixed with ash. A black crow’s feather. His sacred stylus. The sacrificial knife. Forged of iron from a meteor ite in the desert of Canaan. “You think I am afraid to die?” Peter shouted, his voice racked with anguish. “If Katherine is gone, I have nothing left! You’ve murdered my entire family! You ’ve taken everything from me!” “Not everything ,” Mal’akh replied. “Not yet.” He reached into the day- bag and pulled out the laptop from his study. He turned it on and looked over at his capti ve. “I’m afraid you have not yet grasped the true n ature of your predicament.” CHAPTER 117 Langdon felt his stomach drop as the CIA helicopter leaped off the lawn, banked hard, and accelerated faster than he ever imagined a helicopter could move. Kath erine had stayed behind to recuperate with Bellamy while one of the CIA agents searched the mansion an d waited for a backup team. Before Langdon left, she had kissed him on the chee k and whispered, “Be safe, Robert.” Now Langdon was holding on for dear life as the mil itary helicopter finally leveled out and raced towa rd the House of the Temple. Seated beside him, Sato was yelling up to the pilot . “Head for Dupont Circle!” she shouted over the deafening noise. “We’ll set down there!” Startled, Langdon turned to her. “Dupont?! That’s blocks from the House of the Temple! We can land in the Temple parking lot!” Sato shook her head. “We need to enter the building quietly . If our target hears us coming—” “ We don ’ t have time! ” Langdon argued. “ This lunatic is about to murder Peter! Maybe the so und of the"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"helicopter will scare him and make him stop! ” Sato stared at him with ice-cold eyes. “As I have t old you, Peter Solomon’s safety is not my primary objective. I believe I’ve made that clear.” Langdon was in no mood for another national-securit y lecture. “Look, I’m the only one on board who knows his way through that building—” “Careful, Professor,” the director warned. “You are here as a member of my team, and I will have your complete cooperation.” She paused a moment and then added, “ In fact, it might be wise if I now apprised you fully of the severity of our crisis tonight.” Sato reached under her seat and pulled out a sleek titanium briefcase, which she opened to reveal an unusually complicated-looking computer. When she tu rned it on, a CIA logo materialized along with a lo g- in prompt. As Sato logged in, she asked, “Professor, do you re member the blond hairpiece we found in the man’s home?” “Yes.” “Well, hidden within that wig was a tiny fiber-opti c camera . . . concealed in the bangs.” “A hidden camera? I don’t understand.” Sato looked grim. “You will.” She launched a file o n the laptop. ONE MOMENT PLEASE . . . DECRYPTING FILE . . . A video window popped up, filling the entire screen . Sato lifted the briefcase and set it on Langdon’s thighs, giving him a front-row seat. An unusual image materialized on the screen. Langdon recoiled in surprise. What the hell?! Murky and dark, the video was of a blindfolded man. He was dressed in the garb of a medieval heretic b eing led to the gallows—noose around his neck, left pant leg rolled up to the knee, right sleeve rolled up to the elbow, and his shirt gaping open to reveal his bare chest. Langdon stared in disbelief. He had read enough abo ut Masonic rituals to recognize exactly what he was looking at. A Masonic initiate . . . preparing to enter the fir st degree. The man was very muscular and tall, with a familiar blond hairpiece and deeply tanned skin. Langdon recognized his features at once. The man’s tattoos had obviously been concealed beneath bronzing makeu p. He was standing before a full-length mirror videota ping his reflection through the camera concealed in his wig. But . . . why? The screen faded to black. New footage appeared. A small, dimly lit, rectangul ar chamber. A dramatic chessboard floor of black -and- white tile. A low wooden altar, flanked on three si des by pillars, atop which burned flickering candle s."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":" Langdon felt a sudden apprehension. Oh my God. Filming in the erratic style of an amateur home vid eo, the camera now panned up to the periphery of th e room to reveal a small group of men observing the i nitiate. The men were dressed in ritual Masonic reg alia. In the darkness, Langdon could not make out their f aces, but he had no doubt where this ritual was taking place. The traditional layout of this Lodge Room could hav e been anywhere in the world, but the powder-blue triangular pediment above the master’s chair reveal ed it as the oldest Masonic lodge in D.C.—Potomac Lodge No. 5—home of George Washington and the Mason ic forefathers who laid the cornerstone for the White House and the Capitol Building. The lodge was still active today. Peter Solomon, in addition to overseeing the House of the Temple, was the master of his local lodge. A nd it was at lodges like this one that a Masonic initiate ’s journey always began . . . where he underwent th e first three degrees of Freemasonry. “Brethren,” Peter’s familiar voice declared, “in th e name of the Great Architect of the Universe, I op en this lodge for the practice of Masonry in the first degr ee!” A gavel rapped loudly. Langdon watched in utter disbelief as the video pro gressed through a quick series of dissolves featuri ng Peter Solomon performing some of the ritual’s starker mom ents. Pressing a shining dagger to the initiate ’s bare chest . . . threatening impalement should t he initiate “inappropriately reveal the Mysteries of Masonry” . . . describing the black-and-white floor as repres enting “the living and the dead” . . . outlining punishmen ts that included “having one’s throat cut across, o ne’s tongue torn out by its roots, and one’s body buried in the rough sands of the sea . . .” Langdon stared. Am I really witnessing this? Masonic initiation rites had remained shrouded in secrecy for centuries. The only descriptions that had ever been leaked were written by a handful of estranged brot hers. Langdon had read those accounts, of course, and yet to see an initiation with his own eyes . . . this was a much different story. Especially edited this way. Langdon could already tell that the video was an u nfair piece of propaganda, omitting all the noblest aspects of the initiation and highlighting only the most disconcerting. If th is video were released, Langdon knew it would become an Inte rnet sensation over night. The anti-Masonic conspiracy theorists would feed on this like sharks . The Masonic organization, and especially Peter Sol omon, would find themselves embroiled in a firestorm of c ontroversy and a desperate effort at damage control . . . even though the ritual was innocuous and purely sym bolic. Eerily, the video included a biblical reference to human sacrifice . . . “the submission of Abraham to the Supreme Being by proffering Isaac, his firstborn so n.” Langdon thought of Peter and willed the helicopter to fly faster. The video footage shifted now. Same room. Different night. A larger group of Mason s looking on. Peter Solomon was observing from the master’s chair. This was the second degree. More in tense now. Kneeling at the altar . . . vowing to “forever conceal the enigmas existing within Freemasonry” . . . consenting to the penalty of “having one’s ches t cavity ripped open and pulsing heart cast upon the surface of the earth as offal for the ravenous beas ts” . . . Langdon ’ s own heart was pulsing wildly now as the video shi fted yet again. Another night. A much larger"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"crowd. A coffin - shaped “ tracing board ” on the floor. The third degree . This was the death ritual—the most rigorous of all the degrees—the moment in which the initiate was fo rced “to face the final challenge of personal extinction .” This grueling interrogation was in fact the sour ce of the common phrase to give someone the third degree. And although Langdon was very familiar with academ ic accounts of it, he was in no way prepared for what he now saw. The murder. In violent, rapid intercuts, the video displayed a chilling, victim’s point-of-view account of the ini tiate’s brutal murder. There were simulated blows to his he ad, including one with a Mason’s stone maul. All th e while, a deacon mournfully told the story of “the w idow’s son”—Hiram Abiff— the master Architect of King Solomon’s temple, who chose to die rather than reve al the secret wisdom he possessed. The attack was mimed, of course, and yet its effect on camera was bloodcurdling. After the deathblow, the initiate—now “dead to his former self”—was lowered into his symbolic coffin, where his eyes were shut and his arms were crossed like those of a corpse. The M asonic brothers rose and mournfully circled his dea d body while a pipe organ played a march of the dead. The macabre scene was deeply disturbing. And it only got worse. As the men gathered around their slain brother, the hidden camera clearly displayed their faces. Langd on now realized that Solomon was not the only famous m an in the room. One of the men peering down at the initiate in his coffin was on television almost dai ly. A prominent U.S. senator. Oh God . . . The scene changed yet again. Outside now . . . nighttime . . . the same jumpy vi deo footage . . . the man was walking down a city street . . . strands of blond h air blowing in front of the camera . . . turning a corner . . .the camera angle lowering to something in the man’ s hand . . . a dollar bill . . . a close-up focusin g on the Great Seal . . . the all-seeing eye . . . the unfin ished pyramid . . . and then, abruptly, pulling awa y to reveal a similar shape in the distance . . . a massive pyram idical building . . . with sloping sides rising to a truncated top. The House of the Temple. A soul-deep dread swelled within him. The video kept moving . . . the man hurrying toward the building now . . . up t he multitiered staircase . . . toward the giant bronze doors . . . between the two seventeen-ton sphinx guardians. A neophyte entering the pyramid of initiation. Darkness now. A powerful pipe organ played in the distance . . . and a new image materialized. The Temple Room. Langdon swallowed hard. On - screen, the cavernous space was alive with electric ity. Beneath the oculus, the black marble altar sho ne in"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"the moonlight. Assembled around it, seated on hand - tooled pigskin chairs, awaited a somber council of distinguished thirty-third-degree Masons, present t o bear witness. The video now panned across their f aces with slow and deliberate intention. Langdon stared in horror. Although he had not seen this coming, what he was l ooking at made perfect sense. A gathering of the mo st decorated and accomplished Masons in the most power ful city on earth would logically include many influential and well-known individuals. Sure enough , seated around the altar, adorned in their long si lk gloves, Masonic aprons, and glistening jewels, were some of the country’s most powerful men. Two Supreme Court justices . . . The secretary of defense . . . The speaker of the House . . . Langdon felt ill as the video continued panning acr oss the faces of those in attendance. Three prominent senators . . . including the majori ty leader . . . The secretary of homeland security . . . And . . . The director of the CIA . . . Langdon wanted only to look away, but he could not. The scene was utterly mesmerizing, alarming even t o him. In an instant, he had come to understand the s ource of Sato’s anxiety and concern. Now, on -screen, the shot dissolved into a single shocking image. A human skull . . . filled with dark crimson liquid . The famed caput mortuum was being offered forth to the initiate by the slender hands of Peter Solomon, who se gold Masonic ring glinted in the candlelight. Th e red liquid was wine . . . and yet it shimmered like blo od. The visual effect was frightful. The Fifth Libation, Langdon realized, having read firsthand accounts o f this sacrament in John Quincy Adams’s Letters on the Masonic Institution . Even so, to see it happen . . . to see it calmly witnessed by America’s most powerful men . . . this was as arres ting an image as any Langdon had ever seen. The initiate took the skull in his hands . . . his face reflected in the calm surface of the wine. “ May this wine I now drink become a deadly poison to me,” he declared, “should I ever knowingly or willfully violate my oath.” Obviously, this initiate had intended to violate hi s oath beyond all imagination. Langdon could barely get his mind around what would happen if this video were made public. No one would understand. The government would be thrown into upheaval. The airwaves would be filled with the voices of anti-Masonic groups, fundamentalists, and conspirac y theorists spewing hatred and fear, launching a Pu ritan witch hunt all over again. The truth will be twisted, Langdon knew. As it always is with the Masons. The truth was that the brotherhood’s focus on death was in f act a bold celebration of life . Masonic ritual was designed to awaken the slumbering man inside, lifti ng him from his dark coffin of ignorance, raising h im into the light, and giving him eyes to see. Only through the death experience could man fully understand his life experience. Only through the realization that his d ays on earth were finite could he grasp the importa nce of living those days with honor, integrity, and servic e to his fellow man."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":" Masonic initiations were startling because they wer e meant to be transformative. Masonic vows were unforgiving because they were meant to be reminders that man’s honor and his “word” were all he could take from this world. Masonic teachings were arcane beca use they were meant to be universal . . . taught through a common language of symbols and metaphors that tra nscended religions, cultures, and races . . . creat ing a unified “worldwide consciousness” of brotherly love . For a brief instant, Langdon felt a glimmer of hope . He tried to assure himself that if this video wer e to leak out, the public would be open-minded and tolerant, realizing that all spiritual rituals included aspects that would seem frightening if taken out of context—cruc ifixion reenactments, Jewish circumcision rites, Mormon baptisms of the dead, Catholic exorcisms, Is lamic niqab, shamanic trance healing, the Jewish Kaparot ceremony, even the eating of the figurative body and blood of Christ. I ’m dreaming, Langdon knew. This video will create chaos. He could imagine what would happen if the prominent leaders of Russia or the Islamic world we re seen in a video, pressing knives to bare chests, swearing violent oaths, performing mock murders, ly ing in symbolic coffins, and drinking wine from a human skull. The global outcry would be instantaneo us and overwhelming. God help us . . . On-screen now, the initiate was raising the skull t o his lips. He tipped it backward . . . draining th e blood-red wine . . . sealing his oath. Then he lowered the sk ull and gazed out at the assembly around him. Ameri ca’s most powerful and trusted men gave contented nods o f acceptance. “Welcome, brother,” Peter Solomon said. As the image faded to black, Langdon realized he ha d stopped breathing. Without a word, Sato reached over, closed the brief case, and lifted it off his lap. Langdon turned to her trying to speak, but he could find no words. It didn’t mat ter. Understanding was written all over his face. S ato was right. Tonight was a national-security crisis . . . of unimaginable proportions. CHAPTER 118 Dressed in his loincloth, Mal’akh padded back and forth in fr ont of Peter Solomon’s wheelchair. “Peter,” he whispered, enjoying every moment of his captive’s h orror, “you forgot you have a second family . . . your Masonic brothers. And I will destroy them, too . . . unless you help me.” Solomon looked almost catatonic in the glow of the laptop sitting atop his thighs. “Please,” he finall y stammered, glancing up. “If this video gets out . . .” “If?” Mal’akh laughed. “ If it gets out?” He motioned to the small cellular modem plugged int o the side of his laptop. “I’m connected to the world.” “You wouldn’t . . .” I will, Mal’akh thought, enjoying Solomon’s horror. “You h ave the power to stop me,” he said. “And to save your sister. But you have to tell me what I want to know. The Lost Word is hidden somewhere, Peter, an d I know this grid reveals exactly where to find it.” Peter glanced at the grid of symbols again, his eye s revealing nothing."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":" “Perhaps this will help to inspire you.” Mal’akh re ached over Peter’s shoulders and hit a few keys on the laptop. An e-mail program launched on the screen, a nd Peter stiffened visibly.

Mal’akh smiled. “I think it’s time we share, don’t you?” “Don’t!” Mal’akh reached down and clicked the send button on the program. Peter jerked against his bonds, tryin g unsuccessfully to knock the laptop to the floor. “Relax, Peter,” Mal’akh whispered. “It’s a massive file.

I believe you know how to read it.” Mal’akh glanced over at the laptop. SENDING MESSAGE: 8% COMPLETE Mal’akh returned his eyes to Peter. Solomon was sta ring at him, his gray eyes blazing now with hatred. Hate me, Mal’akh thought. The greater the emotion, the more potent the energy that will be released when the ritual is completed. At Langley, Nola Kaye pressed the phone to her ear, barely able to hear Sato over the noise of the hel icopter. “They said it’s impossible to stop the file transfe r!” Nola shouted. “To shut down local ISPs would ta ke at least an hour, and if he’s got access to a wireless provider, killing the ground-based Internet won’t stop him from sending it anyway.” Nowadays, stopping the flow of digital information had become nearly impossible. There were too many access routes to the Internet. Between hard lines, Wi-Fi hot spots, cellular modems, SAT phones, superphones, and e-mail-equipped PDAs, the only way to isolate a potential data leak was by destroying the source machine. “I pulled the spec sheet on the UH-60 you’re flying ,” Nola said, “and it looks like you’re equipped wit h EMP.” Electromagnetic - pulse or EMP guns were now commonplace among law en forcement agencies, which used"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"them primarily to stop car chases from a safe dista nce. By firing a highly concentrated pulse of electromagnetic radiation, an EMP gun could effecti vely fry the electronics of any device it targeted— cars, cell phones, computers. According to Nola’s spec sh eet, the UH-60 had a chassis-mounted, laser-sighted , six- gigahertz magnetron with a fifty-dB-gain horn that yielded a ten-gigawatt pulse. Discharged directly a t a laptop, the pulse would fry the computer’s motherbo ard and instantly erase the hard drive. “EMP will be useless,” Sato yelled back. “Target is inside a stone building. No sight lines and thick EM shielding. Do you have any indication yet if the vi deo has gone out?” Nola glanced at a second monitor, which was running a continuous search for breaking news stories abou t the Masons. “Not yet, ma’am. But if it goes public, we’ll know within seconds.” “Keep me posted.” Sato signed off. Langdon held his breath as the helicopter dropped f rom the sky toward Dupont Circle. A handful of pedestrians scattered as the aircraft descended thr ough an opening in the trees and landed hard on the lawn just south of the famous two -tiered fountain designed by the same two men who c reated the Lincoln Memorial. Thirty seconds later, Langdon was riding shotgun in a commandeered Lexus SUV, tearing up New Hampshire Avenue toward the House of the Temple. Peter Solomon was desperately trying to figure out what to do. All he could see in his mind were the i mages of Katherine bleeding in the basement . . . and of the video he had just witnessed. He turned his head slowly toward the laptop on the pigskin chair several yard s away. The progress bar was almost a third of the way filled. SENDING MESSAGE: 29% COMPLETE The tattooed man was now walking slow circles aroun d the square altar, swinging a lit censer and chant ing to himself. Thick puffs of white smoke swirled up towa rd the skylight. The man’s eyes were wide now, and he seemed to be in a demonic trance. Peter turned his gaze to the ancient knife that sat waiting on the w hite silk cloth spread across the altar. Peter Solomon had no doubt that he would die in thi s temple tonight. The question was how to die. Woul d he find a way to save his sister and his brotherhood . . . or would his death be entirely in vain? He glanced down at the grid of symbols. When he had first laid eyes on the grid, the shock of the mome nt had blinded him . . . preventing his vision from pi ercing the veil of chaos . . . to glimpse the start ling truth. Now, however, the real significance of these symbol s had become crystal clear to him. He had seen the grid in an entirely new light. Peter Solomon knew exactly what he needed to do. Taking a deep breath, he gazed up at the moon throu gh the oculus above. Then he began to speak. All great truths are simple. Mal’akh had learned that long ago. The solution that Peter Solomon was now explaining was so graceful and pure that Mal’akh was sure that it could only be true. Incredibly, the solution to the pyramid’s final code was far simpler than he had e ver imagined. The Lost Word was right before my eyes. "},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"In an instant, a bright ray of light pierced the mu rkiness of the history and myth surrounding the Los t Word.

Standing now in this initiation chamber atop the gr eat pyramid of Heredom, Mal’ akh gazed upon the treasure he had sought all these years, and he knew he could not have prepared himself more perfectly. Soon I am complete. The Lost Word is found. In Kalorama Heights, a lone CIA agent stood amid a sea of garbage that he had dumped out of the trash bins that had been found in the garage. “Ms. Kaye?” he said, speaking to Sato’s analyst on the phone. “ Good thinking to search his garbage. I think I just found something. ” Inside the house, Katherine Solomon was feeling str onger with every passing moment. The infusion of lactated Ringer’s solution had successfully raised her blood pressure and quelled her throbbing headac he. She was resting now, seated in the dining room, wit h explicit instructions to remain still. Her nerves felt frayed, and she was increasingly anxious for news a bout her brother. Where is everybody? The CIA’ s forensics team had not yet arrived, and the agent who had stayed behind was still off searching the premises. Bellamy had been sitting with her in the dining room, still wrapped in a foil blanket, but he, too, had wandered off to look for any information that might help the CIA save Peter. Unable to sit idly, Katherine pulled herself to her feet, teetered, and then inched slowly toward the living room. She found Bellamy in the study. The Architect was standing at an open drawer, his back to her, apparently too engrossed in its contents to hear he r enter. She walked up behind him. “Warren?” The old man lurched and turned, quickly shutting th e drawer with his hip. His face was lined with shoc k and grief, his cheeks streaked with tears. “What’s wrong?!” She glanced down at the drawer. “W hat is it?” Bellamy seemed unable to speak. He had the look of a man who had just seen something he deeply wished he had not. “What’s in the drawer?” she demanded. Bellamy’s tear-filled eyes held hers for a long, so rrowful moment. Finally he spoke. “You and I wonder ed why . . . why this man seemed to hate your family.” Katherine’s brow furrowed. “Yes?” “Well . . .” Bellamy’s voice caught. “I just found t he answer.” CHAPTER 119 "},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":" In the chamber at the top of the House of the Temple, the one who called himself Mal’akh stood before the great altar and gently massaged the virgin skin ato p his head. Verbum significatium, he chanted in preparation. Verbum omnificum . The final ingredient had been found at last. The most precious treasures are often the simplest. Above the altar, wisps of fragrant smoke now swirle d, billowing up from the censer. The suffumigations ascended through the shaft of moonlight, clearing a channel skyward through which a liberated soul cou ld travel freely. The time had come. Mal’akh retrieved the vial of Peter’s darkened bloo d and uncorked it. With his captive looking on, he dipped the nib of the crow’s feather into the crimson tinc ture and raised it to the sacred circle of flesh at op his head. He paused a moment . . . thinking of how long he ha d waited for this night. His great transformation w as finally at hand. When the Lost Word is written on the mind of man, h e is then ready to receive unimaginable power. Such was the ancient promise of apotheosis. So far , mankind had been unable to realize that promise, and Mal’akh had done what he could to keep it that way. With a steady hand, Mal’akh touched the nib of the feather to his skin. He needed no mirror, no assist ance, only his sense of touch, and his mind’s eye. Slowly , meticulously, he began inscribing the Lost Word i nside the circular ouroboros on his scalp. Peter Solomon looked on with an expression of horro r. When Mal’akh finished, he closed his eyes, set down the feather, and let the air out of his lungs enti rely. For the first time in his life, he felt a sensation he had never known. I am complete. I am at one. Mal’akh had worked for years on the artifact that w as his body, and now, as he neared his moment of fin al transformation, he could feel every line that had e ver been inscribed on his flesh. I am a true masterpiece. Perfect and complete. “I gave you what you asked for.” Peter’s voice intr uded. “Send help to Katherine. And stop that file.” Mal’akh opened his eyes and smiled. “You and I are not quite finished.” He turned to the altar and pic ked up the sacrificial knife, running his finger across th e sleek iron blade. “This ancient knife was commiss ioned by God,” he said, “for use in a human sacrifice. You r ecognized it earlier, no?” Solomon’s gray eyes were like stone. “It is unique, and I’ve heard the legend.” “Legend? The account appears in Holy Scripture. You don’t believe it’s true?” Peter just stared. Mal’akh had spent a fortune locating and obtaining this artifact. Known as the Akedah knife, it had be en crafted over three thousand years ago from an iron meteorite that had fallen to earth. Iron from heaven, as the early mystics called it. It was believed to be the exact knife used by Abra ham at the Akedah—the near sacrifice of his son Isaac on Mount Moriah—as depic ted in Genesis. The knife’s astounding history incl uded possession by popes, Nazi mystics, European alchemi sts, and private collectors. They protected and admired it, Mal’akh thought, but none dared unleash its true power by using it f or its real purpose. Tonight, the Akedah knife would fulfill its destin y. "},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"The Akedah had always been sacred in Masonic ritual . In the very first degree, Masons celebrated “ the most august gift ever offered to God . . . the submissio n of Abraham to the volitions of the supreme being by proffering Isaac, his firstborn . . . ” The weight of the blade felt exhilarating in Mal’ak h’s hand as he crouched down and used the freshly sharpened knife to sever the ropes binding Peter to his wheelchair. The bonds fell to the floor. Peter Solomon winced in pain as he attempted to shi ft his cramped limbs. “Why are you doing this to me ? What do you think this will accomplish?” “ You of all people should understand,” Mal’akh replied. “You study the ancient ways. You know that the power of the mysteries relies on sacrifice . . . on releasing a human soul from its body. It has been this way since the beginning.” “You know nothing of sacrifice,” Peter said, his vo ice seething with pain and loathing. Excellent, Mal’akh thought. Feed your hatred. It will only make this easier. Mal’akh’s empty stomach growled as he paced before his captive. “ There is enormous power in the shedding of human blood. Everyone understood that, from the early Egyptians, to the Celtic Druids, to the Chine se, to the Aztecs. There is magic in human sacrifice, but modern man has become weak, too fearful to make tru e offerings, too frail to give the life that is requi red for spiritual transformation. The ancient texts are clear, though. Only by offering what is most sacred can ma n access the ultimate power.” “You consider me a sacred offering?” Mal’akh now laughed out loud. “You really don’t und erstand yet, do you?” Peter gave him an odd look. “Do you know why I have a deprivation tank in my ho me?” Mal’akh placed his hands on his hips and flexe d his elaborately decorated body, which was still cov ered only by a loincloth. “I have been practicing . . . preparing . . . anticipating the moment when I am o nly mind . . . when I am released from this mortal shell . . . when I have offered up this beautiful body to the gods in sacrifice. I am the precious one! I am the pure white lamb!” Peter’s mouth fell open but no words came out. “Yes, Peter, a man must offer to the gods that whic h he holds most dear. His purest white dove . . . h is most precious and worthy offering. You are not precious to me. You are not a worthy offering.” Mal’akh glared at him. “Don’t you see? You are not the sacrifice, Peter . . . I am. Mine is the flesh that is the offering. I am the gift. Look at me. I have prepared, made myself wort hy for my final journey. I am the gift! ” Peter remained speechless. “The secret is how to die,” Mal’akh now said. “Masons understand that .” He pointed to the altar. “ You revere the ancient truths, and yet you are cowards. You un derstand the power of sacrifice and yet you keep a safe distance from death, performing your mock murders a nd bloodless death rituals. Tonight, your symbolic altar will bear witness to its true power . . . and its a ctual purpose.” Mal’akh reached down and grasped Peter Solomon’s le ft hand, pressing the handle of the Akedah knife in to his palm. The left hand serves the darkness. This, too, had been planned. Peter would have no c hoice in the matter. Mal’ akh could fathom no sacrifice more potent and symbo lic than one performed on this altar, by this man, with this knife, plunged into the heart of an offering whose mortal flesh was wrapped like a gift in a shroud of mystical symbols. With this offering of self, Mal’akh would establish his rank in the hierarchy of demons. Darkness and blood were where the true power lay. The ancients knew th is, the Adepts choosing sides consistent with their"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"individual natures. Mal ’ akh had chosen sides wisely. Chaos was the natural law of the universe. Indifference was the engine of entropy. Man’s apathy was the fer tile ground in which the dark spirits tended their seeds. I have served them, and they will receive me as a g od. Peter did not move. He simply stared down at the an cient knife gripped in his hand. “I will you,” Mal’akh taunted. “I am a willing sacr ifice. Your final role has been written. You will t ransform me. You will liberate me from my body. You will do this, or you will lose your sister and your brother hood. You will truly be all alone.” He paused, smiling do wn at his captive. “Consider this your final punish ment.” Peter’s eyes rose slowly to meet Mal’akh’s. “Killin g you ? A punishment ? Do you think I will hesitate? You murdered my son. My mother. My entire family.” “No!” Mal’akh exploded with a force that startled e ven himself. “You are wrong! I did not murder your family! You did! It was you who made the choice to leave Zachary in prison! An d from there, the wheels were in motion! You killed your family, Peter, not me!” Peter’s knuckles turned white, his fingers clenchin g the knife in rage. “You know nothing of why I lef t Zachary in prison.” “I know everything!” Mal’akh fired back. “I was the re. You claimed you were trying to help him. Were you trying to help him when you offered him the choice between wealth or wisdom? Were you trying to help him when you gave him the ultimatum to join the Masons? What kind of father gives a child the choice betwe en ‘wealth or wisdom’ and expects him to know how to h andle it! What kind of father leaves his own son in a prison instead of flying him home to safety!” Mal’a kh now moved in front of Peter and crouched down, placing his tattooed face only inches from his face . “But most important . . . what kind of father can look his own son in the eyes . . . even after all these year s . . . and not even recognize him!” Mal’akh’s words echoed for several seconds in the s tone chamber. Then silence. In the abrupt stillness, Peter Solomon seemed to ha ve been jolted from his trance. His face clouded no w with a visage of total incredulity. Yes, Father. It’s me. Mal’akh had waited years for this moment . . . to take revenge on the man who had abandoned him . . . to stare into those gray eyes a nd speak the truth that had been buried all these y ears. Now the moment was here, and he spoke slowly, longing t o watch the full weight of his words gradually crus h Peter Solomon’s soul. “You should be happy, Father. Your prodigal son has returned.” Peter’s face was now as pale as death. Mal’akh savored every moment. “My own father made t he decision to leave me in prison . . . and in that instant, I vowed that he had rejected me for the la st time. I was no longer his son. Zachary Solomon c eased to exist.” Two glistening teardrops welled suddenly in his fat her’s eyes, and Mal’akh thought they were the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. Peter choked back tears, staring up at Mal’akh’s fa ce as if seeing him for the very first time. “All the warden wanted was money,” Mal’akh said, “b ut you refused. It never occurred to you, though, t hat my money was just as green as yours. The warden did n ot care who paid him, only that he was paid. When I offered to pay him handsomely, he selected a sickly inmate about my size, dressed him in my clothes, a nd beat him beyond all recognition. The photos you saw . . . and the sealed casket you buried . . . they were not mine. They belonged to a stranger.” "},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Peter ’ s tear - streaked face contorted now with anguish and disbel ief. “ Oh my God . . . Zachary. ” “Not anymore. When Zachary walked out of prison, he was transformed.” His adolescent physique and childlike face had dras tically mutated when he flooded his young body with experimental growth hormones and steroids. Even his vocal cords had been ravaged, transforming his boy ish voice into a permanent whisper. Zachary became Andros. Andros became Mal ’akh. And tonight . . . Mal ’akh will become his greatest incarnation of all. At that moment in Kalorama Heights, Katherine Solom on stood over the open desk drawer and gazed down at what could be described only as a fetishist’s co llection of old newspaper articles and photographs. “I don’t understand,” she said, turning to Bellamy. “This lunatic was obviously obsessed with my famil y, but—” “Keep going . . .” urged Bellamy, taking a seat and still looking deeply shaken. Katherine dug deeper into the newspaper articles, e very one of which related to the Solomon family—Pet er’ s many successes, Katherine’s research, their mother Isabel’s terrible murder, Zachary Solomon’s widely publicized drug use, incarceration, and brutal murd er in a Turkish prison. The fixation this man had on the Solomon family was beyond fanatical, and yet Katherine saw nothing ye t to suggest why . It was then that she saw the photographs. The first showed Zachary standing knee-deep in azure water o n a beach dotted with whitewashed houses. Greece? The photo, she assumed, could have been taken only during Zach’s freewheeling drug days in Europe. Strangely, though, Zach looked healthier than he did in the paparazzi shots of an emaciated kid partying with t he drug crowd. He looked more fit, stronger somehow , more mature. Katherine never recalled him looking s o healthy. Puzzled, she checked the date stamp on the photo. But that ’s . . . impossible. The date was almost a full year after Zachary had died in prison. Suddenly Katherine was flipping desperately through the stack. All of the photos were of Zachary Solom on . . . gradually getting older. The collection appeare d to be some kind of pictorial autobiography, chron icling a slow transformation. As the pictures progressed, Ka therine saw a sudden and dramatic change. She looke d on in horror as Zachary’s body began mutating, his mus cles bulging, and his facial features morphing from the obvious heavy use of steroids. His frame seemed to double in mass, and a haunting fierceness crept int o his eyes. I don ’t even recognize this man! He looked nothing like Katherine’s memories of her young nephew. When she reached a picture of him with a shaved hea d, she felt her knees begin to buckle. Then she saw a photo of his bare body . . . adorned with the first traces of tattoos. Her heart almost stopped. “Oh my God . . .” "},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 120 “Right turn!” Langdon shouted from the backseat of the commandee red Lexus SUV. Simkins swerved onto S Street and gunned the vehicl e through a tree- lined residential neighborhood. As they neared the corner of Sixteenth Street, the House of the Temple rose like a mountain on the right. Simkins stared up at the massive structure. It look ed like someone had built a pyramid on top of Rome’ s Pantheon. He prepared to turn right on Sixteenth to ward the front of the building. “Don’t turn!” Langdon ordered. “Go straight! Stay o n S!” Simkins obeyed, driving alongside the east side of the building. “At Fifteenth,” Langdon said, “turn right!” Simkins followed his navigator, and moments later, Langdon had pointed out a nearly invisible, unpaved access road that bisected the gardens behind the Ho use of the Temple. Simkins turned in to the drive a nd gunned the Lexus toward the rear of the building. “Look!” Langdon said, pointing to the lone vehicle parked near the rear entrance. It was a large van. “They’re here.” Simkins parked the SUV and killed the engine. Quiet ly, everyone got out and prepared to move in. Simki ns stared up at the monolithic structure. “You say the Temple Room is at the top ?” Langdon nodded, pointing all the way to the pinnacl e of the building. “That flat area on top of the py ramid is actually a skylight.” Simkins spun back to Langdon. “The Temple Room has a skylight ?” Langdon gave him an odd look. “Of course. An oculus to heaven . . . directly above the altar.” The UH-60 sat idling at Dupont Circle. In the passenger seat, Sato gnawed at her fingernai ls, awaiting news from her team.

Peter Solomon now had his answers. The massive tattooed creature before him had begun life as a tiny, precious infant . . . baby Zach cur led up in a wicker bassinette . . . taking his first fumbling steps across Peter’s study . . . learning to speak his first words. The fact that evil could spring from an inno cent child in a loving family remained one of the paradoxes of the human soul. Peter had been forced to accept early on that although his own blood flow ed in his son’s veins, the heart pumping that blood was h is son’s own. Unique and singular . . . as if rando mly chosen from the universe. My son . . . he killed my mother, my friend Robert Langdon, and possibly my sister. An icy numbness flooded Peter’s heart as he searche d his son’s eyes for any connection . . . anything familiar. The man’s eyes, however, although gray li ke Peter’s, were those of a total stranger, filled with a hatred and a vengefulness that were almost otherwor ldly. “Are you strong enough?” his son taunted, glancing at the Akedah knife gripped in Peter’s hand. “Can y ou finish what you started all those years ago?” “Son . . .” Solomon barely recognized his own voice . “I . . . I loved . . . you.” “Twice you tried to kill me. You abandoned me in pr ison. You shot me on Zach’s bridge. Now finish it!” For an instant, Solomon felt like he was floating o utside his own body. He no longer recognized himsel f. He was missing a hand, was totally bald, dressed in a black robe, sitting in a wheelchair, and clutching an ancient knife. “Finish it!” the man shouted again, the tattoos on his naked chest rippling. “Killing me is the only wa y you can save Katherine . . . the only way to save your brotherhood!” Solomon felt his gaze move to the laptop and cellul ar modem on the pigskin chair.

And although Peter Solomon did not believe his own words, he knew he had to make a choice. He was out of time. Find the Grand Staircase! Robert Langdon dashed through darkened hallways, wi nding his way toward the center of the building. Turner Simkins remained close on his heels. As Lang don had hoped, he burst out into the building’s mai n atrium. Dominated by eight Doric columns of green granite, the atrium looked like a hybrid sepulcher—Greco- Roman-Egyptian—with black marble statues, chandelie r fire bowls, Teutonic crosses, double-headed phoenix medallions, and sconces bearing the head of Hermes. Langdon turned and ran toward the sweeping marble s taircase at the far end of the atrium. “This leads directly to the Temple Room,” he whispered as the t wo men ascended as quickly and quietly as possible. On the first landing, Langdon came face-to-face wit h a bronze bust of Masonic luminary Albert Pike, al ong with the engraving of his most famous quote: WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR OURSELVES ALONE DIES WITH US; WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR OTHERS AND THE WORLD REMAINS AND IS IMMORTAL . Mal’akh had sensed a palpable shift in the atmosphe re of the Temple Room, as if all the frustration an d pain Peter Solomon had ever felt was now boiling to the surface . . . focusing itself like a laser on Mal’a kh. Yes . . . it is time. Peter Solomon had risen from his wheelchair and was standing now, facing the altar, gripping the knife . “Save Katherine,” Mal’akh coaxed, luring him toward the altar, backing up, and finally laying his own body down on the white shroud he had prepared. “Do what you need to do.” As if moving through a nightmare, Peter inched forw ard. Mal’akh reclined fully now onto his back, gazing up through the oculus at the wintry moon. The secret is how to die. This moment could not be any more perfect. Adorned with the Lost Word of the ages, I offer myself by the left hand of my father. Mal’akh drew a deep breath. Receive me, demons, for this is my body, which is o ffered for you. Standing over Mal’akh, Peter Solomon was trembling. His tear-soaked eyes shone with desperation, indecision, anguish. He looked one last time toward the modem and laptop across the room. “Make the choice,” Mal’akh whispered. “Release me f rom my flesh. God wants this . You want this.” He laid his arms at his side and arched his chest forward, offering up his magnificent double-headed phoenix. Help me shed the body that clothes my soul.

It was Peter’s voice. L angdon was certain. Peter’s cry was one of absolute agony. I ’m too late! Ignoring Simkins, Langdon seized the handles and ya nked open the doors. The horrific scene before him confirmed his worst fears. There, in the center of the dimly lit chamber, the silhouette of a man with a shaved head stood at the great altar. He wore a black robe , and his hand was clutching a large blade. Before Langdon could move, the man was driving the knife down toward the body that lay outstretched on the altar. Mal’akh had closed his eyes. So beautiful. So perfect. The ancient blade of the Akedah knife had glinted i n the moonlight as it arched over him. Scented wisp s of smoke had spiraled upward above him, preparing a pa thway for his soon-to-be-liberated soul. His killer ’s lone scream of torment and desperation still rang t hrough the sacred space as the knife came down. I am besmeared with the blood of human sacrifice an d parents ’ tears. Mal’akh braced for the glorious impact. His moment of transformation had arrived. Incredibly, he felt no pain. A thunderous vibration filled his body, deafening a nd deep. The room began shaking, and a brilliant wh ite light blinded him from above. The heavens roared. And Mal’akh knew it had happened. Exactly as he had planned. Langdon did not remember sprinting toward the altar as the helicopter appeared overhead. Nor did he remember leaping with his arms out-stretched . . . soaring toward the man in the black robe . . . tryi ng desperately to tackle him before he could plunge th e knife down a second time. Their bodies collided, and Langdon saw a bright lig ht sweep down through the oculus and illuminate the altar. He expected to see the bloody body of Peter Solomon on the altar, but the naked chest that shon e in the light had no blood on it at all . . . only a tapest ry of tattoos. The knife lay broken beside him, app arently having been driven into the stone altar rather than into flesh. As he and the man in the black robe crashed togethe r onto the hard stone floor, Langdon saw the bandag ed nub on the end of the man’s right arm, and he reali zed to his bewilderment that he had just tackled Pe ter Solomon.

This mysterious language, Peter had revealed, was in fact the oldest languag e on earth. The language of symbols. In the idiom of symbology, there was one symbol that reigned supreme above all others.

He was not sure why, but he felt as if a ghostly shadow had evaporated . . . as if a weight had been lifted . . . far away and yet right here. Alone at his desk, he was deep in thought. He was n ot sure how many minutes had passed when his phone rang. It was Warren Bellamy. “Peter’s alive,” his Masonic brother said. “I just heard the news. I knew you’d want to know immediate ly. He’s going to be okay.” “Thank God.” Galloway exhaled. “Where is he?” Galloway listened as Bellamy recounted the extraord inary tale of what had transpired after they had le ft Cathedral College. “But all of you are okay?” “Recuperating, yes,” Bellamy said. “There is one th ing, though.” He paused. “Yes?” “The Masonic Pyramid . . . I think Langdon may have solved it.” Galloway had to smile. Somehow he was not surprised . “And tell me, did Langdon discover whether or not the pyramid kept its promise? Whether or not it rev ealed what legend always claimed it would reveal?” “I don’t know yet.” It will, Galloway thought. “You need to rest.” “As do you.” No, I need to pray.

Katherine Solomon’s legs still felt rubbery as she hurried in to find her brother. The air in this eno rmous chamber was cold and smelled of incense. The scene that greeted her stopped her in her tracks. In the center of this magnificent room, on a low st one altar, lay a bloody, tattooed corpse, a body pe rforated by spears of broken glass. High above, a gaping hol e in the ceiling opened to the heavens. My God. Katherine immediately looked away, her eyes scanni ng for Peter. She found her brother sitting on the other side of the room, being tended to by a me dic while talking with Langdon and Director Sato. “Peter!” Katherine called, running over. “Peter!” Her brother glanced up, his expression filling with relief. He was on his feet at once, moving toward her. He was wearing a simple white shirt and dark slacks, w hich someone had probably gotten for him from his office downstairs. His right arm was in a sling, an d their gentle embrace was awkward, but Katherine b arely noticed. A familiar comfort surrounded her like a c ocoon, as it always had, even in childhood, when he r protective older brother embraced her. They held each other in silence. Finally Katherine whispered, “Are you okay? I mean . . . really?” She released him, looking down at the sling and bandage where his right hand used to be. Tears welled again in her eyes. “I’m so . . . so sorry.” Peter shrugged as if it were nothing of consequence . “Mortal flesh. Bodies don’t last forever. The imp ortant thing is that you’re okay.” Peter’s lighthearted response tore at her emotions, reminding her of all the reasons she loved him. Sh e stroked his head, feeling the unbreakable bonds of family . . . the shared blood that flowed in their veins. Tragically, she knew there was a third Solomon in the room tonight. The corpse on the alt ar drew her gaze, and Katherine shuddered deeply, trying to block out the photos she had seen. She looked away, her eyes now finding Robert Langdo n’ s. There was compassion there, deep and perceptive, as if Langdon somehow knew exactly what she was thi nking. Peter knows. Raw emotion gripped Katherine—relief, sympathy, despair. She felt her b rother’s body begin trembling like a child’s. It wa s something she had never witnessed in her entire lif e. “Just let it go,” she whispered. “It’s okay. Just l et it go.” Peter’s trembling grew deeper. She held him again, stroking the back of his head. “Peter, you’ve always been the strong one . . . you’ve always been there for me. But I’m here for you now. It’s okay. I’m right here.” Katherine eased his head gently onto her shoulder . . . and the great Peter Solomon collapsed sobbing in her arms. Director Sato stepped away to take an incoming call . It was Nola Kaye. Her news, for a change, was good. “ Still no signs of distribution, ma ’ am. ” She sounded hopeful. “ I ’ m confident we would have seen something"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"by now. It looks like you contained it. ” Thanks to you, Nola, Sato thought, glancing down at the laptop, which L angdon had seen complete its transmission. A very close call. At Nola’s suggestion, the agent searching the mansi on had checked the garbage cans, discovering packag ing for a newly purchased cellular modem. With the exac t model number, Nola had been able to cross-referen ce compatible carriers, bandwidths, and service grids, isolating the laptop’s most likely access node—a s mall transmitter on the corner of Sixteenth and Corcoran —three blocks from the Temple. Nola quickly relayed the information to Sato in the helicopter. On approach toward the House of the Te mple, the pilot had performed a low-altitude flyover and pulsed the relay node with a blast of electromagnet ic radiation, knocking it off-line only seconds before the laptop completed its transfer. “Great work tonight,” Sato said. “Now get some slee p. You’ve earned it.” “Thank you, ma’am.” Nola hesitated. “Was there something else?” Nola was silent a long moment, apparently consideri ng whether or not to speak. “Nothing that can’t wait till morning, ma’am. Have a good night.” CHAPTER 125 In the silence of an elegant bathroom on the ground floor of the House of the Temple, Robert Langdon ran warm water into a tile sink and eyed himself in the mirror. Even in the muted light, he looked like he felt . . . utterly spent. His daybag was on his shoulder again, much lighter now . . . empty except for his personal items and s ome crumpled lecture notes. He had to chuckle. His visi t to D.C. tonight to give a lecture had turned out a bit more grueling than he’d anticipated. Even so, Langdon had a lot to be grateful for. Peter is alive. And the video was contained. As Langdon scooped handfuls of warm water onto his face, he gradually felt himself coming back to life . Everything was still a blur, but the adrenaline in his body was finally dissipating . . . and he was f eeling like himself again. After drying his hands, he checked h is Mickey Mouse watch. My God, it ’s late. Langdon exited the bathroom and wound his way along the curved wall of the Hall of Honor—a gracefully arched passageway, lined with portraits of accompli shed Masons . . . U.S. presidents, philanthropists, luminaries, and other influential Americans. He pau sed at an oil painting of Harry S. Truman and tried to imagine the man undergoing the rites, rituals, and studies required to become a Mason. There is a hidden world behind the one we all see . For all of us."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":" “You slipped away,” a voice said down the hall. Langdon turned. It was Katherine. She’d been through hell tonight, and yet she looked suddenly radiant . . . rejuvenat ed somehow. Langdon gave a tired smile. “How’s he doing?” Katherine walked up and embraced him warmly. “How c an I ever thank you?” He laughed. “You know I didn’t do anything, right?” Katherine held him for a long time. “Peter’s going to be fine . . .” She let go and looked deep into L angdon’s eyes. “And he just told me something incredible . . . something w onderful .” Her voice trembled with anticipation. “I need to go see it for myself. I’ll be back in a bit.” “What? Where are you going?” “I won’t be long. Right now, Peter wants to speak w ith you . . . alone . He’s waiting in the library.” “Did he say why?” Katherine chuckled and shook her head. “You know Pe ter and his secrets.” “But—” “I’ll see you in a bit.” Then she was gone. Langdon sighed heavily. He felt like he’d had enoug h secrets for one night. There were unanswered questions, of course—the Masonic Pyramid and the Lo st Word among them— but he sensed that the answers, if they even existed, were not for him. Not as a non-Mason. Mustering the last of his energy, Langdon made his way to the Masonic library. When he arrived, Peter was sitting all alone at a table with the stone pyramid before him. “Robert?” Peter smiled and waved him in. “I’d like a word.” Langdon managed a grin. “Yes, I hear you lost one.” CHAPTER 126 The library in the House of the Temple was D.C.’s oldest publi c reading room. Its elegant stacks burgeoned with over a quarter of a million volumes, including a rare copy of the Ahiman Rezon, The Secrets of a Prepared Brother. In addition, the library displayed precious Masoni c jewels, ritual artifacts, and even a rare volume that had been hand-printed by Benjamin Frank lin. Langdon ’ s favorite library treasure, however, was one few e ver noticed."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":" The illusion. Solomon had shown him long ago that from the proper vantage point, the library’s reading desk and gold en table lamp created an unmistakable optical illusion . . . that of a pyramid and shining golden capston e. Solomon said he always considered the illusion a si lent reminder that the mysteries of Freemasonry wer e perfectly visible to anyone and everyone if they we re seen from the proper perspective. Tonight, however, the mysteries of Freemasonry had materialized front and center. Langdon now sat opposite the Worshipful Master Peter Solomon and th e Masonic Pyramid. Peter was smiling. “The ‘word’ you refer to, Robert , is not a legend. It is a reality .” Langdon stared across the table and finally spoke. “But . . . I don’t understand. How is that possible ?” “What is so difficult to accept?” All of it! Langdon wanted to say, searching his old friend’s eyes for any hint of common sense. “You’re saying you believe the Lost Word is real . . . and that it has actual power ?” “Enormous power,” Peter said. “It has the power to transform human kind by unlocking the Ancient Mysteries.” “A word ?” Langdon challenged. “Peter, I can’t possibly bel ieve a word—” “You will believe,” Peter stated calmly. Langdon stared in silence. “As you know,” Solomon continued, standing now and p acing around the table, “it has long been prophesied that there will come a day when the Lost Word will be rediscovered . . . a day when it will be unearth ed . . . and mankind will once again have access to its forg otten power.” Langdon flashed on Peter’s lecture about the Apocal ypse. Although many people erroneously interpreted apocalypse as a cataclysmic end of the world, the word litera lly signified an “unveiling,” predicted by the ancients to be that of great wisdom. The coming age of enlightenment. Even so, Langdon could not imagine such a vast change being ushered in by . . . a word . Peter motioned to the stone pyramid, which sat on t he table beside its golden capstone. “The Masonic Pyramid,” he said. “The legendary symbolon. Tonight it stands unified . . . and complete.” Reverently, he lifted the golden capstone and set it atop the pyra mid. The heavy gold piece clicked softly into place . “Tonight, my friend, you have done what has never b een done before. You have assembled the Masonic Pyramid, deciphered all of its codes, and in the en d, unveiled . . . this .” Solomon produced a sheet of paper and laid it on th e table. Langdon recognized the grid of symbols tha t had been reorganized using the Order Eight Franklin Squ are. He had studied it briefly in the Temple Room. Peter said, “I am curious to know if you can read this array of symbols. After all, you are the spec ialist.” Langdon eyed the grid. Heredom, circumpunct, pyramid, staircase . . . "},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":" Langdon sighed. “Well, Peter, as you can probably s ee, this is an allegorical pictogram. Clearly its l anguage is metaphorical and symbolic rather than literal.” Solomon chuckled. “Ask a symbologist a simple quest ion . . . Okay, tell me what you see.” Peter really wants to hear this? Langdon pulled the page toward him. “Well, I looke d at it earlier, and, in simple terms, I see that this grid is a picture . . . depicting heaven and earth.” Peter arched his eyebrows, looking surprised. “Oh?” “Sure. At the top of the image, we have the word Heredom —the ‘Holy House’—which I interpret as the House of God . . . or heaven .” “Okay.” “The downward-facing arrow after Heredom signifies that the rest of the pictogram clearly lies in the realm beneath heaven . . . that being . . . earth .” Langdon’s eyes glided now to the bottom of the g rid. “The lowest two rows, those beneath the pyramid, represent the earth itself—terra firm a—the lowest of all the realms. Fittingly, these lower realms contain the twelve an cient astrological signs, which represent the primordial religion of those first human souls who looked to t he heavens and saw the hand of God in the movement of the stars and planets.” Solomon slid his chair closer and studied the grid. “Okay, what else?” “On a foundation of astrology,” Langdon continued, “the great pyramid rises from the earth . . . stret ching toward heaven . . . the enduring symbol of lost wis dom. It is filled with history’s great philosophies and religions . . . Egyptian, Pythagorean, Buddhist, Hi ndu, Islamic, Judeo-Christian, and on and on . . . all flowing upward, merging together, funneling themsel ves up through the transformative gateway of the pyramid . . . where they finally fuse into a single , unified human philosophy.” He paused. “ A single universal consciousness . . . a shared global vision of God . . . represented by the ancient symbol that hovers over the capstone.” “The circumpunct,” Peter said. “A universal symbol for God.” "},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"“ Right. Throughout history, the circumpunct has been all things to all people — it is the sun god Ra, alchemical gold, the all-seeing eye, the singularit y point before the Big Bang, the—” “The Great Architect of the Universe.” Langdon nodded, sensing this was probably the same argument Peter had used in the Temple Room to sell the idea of the circumpunct as the Lost Word. “And finally?” Peter asked. “What about the stairca se?” Langdon glanced down at the image of the stairs ben eath the pyramid. “Peter, I’m sure you know as well as anyone, this symbolizes the Winding Staircase of Fr eemasonry . . . leading upward out of the earthly darkness into the light . . . like Jacob’s ladder c limbing to heaven . . . or the tiered human spine t hat connects man’s mortal body to his eternal mind.” He paused. “As for the rest of the symbols, they appear to be a blend of celestial, Masonic, and scientific, all lending support to the Ancient Mysteries.” Solomon stroked his chin. “An elegant interpretatio n, Professor. I agree, of course, that this grid ca n be read as allegory, and yet . . .” His eyes flashed with d eepening mystery. “This collection of symbols tells another story as well. A story that is far more revealing.” “Oh?” Solomon began pacing again, circling the table. “Ea rlier tonight, inside the Temple Room, when I belie ved I was going to die, I looked at this grid, and someho w I saw past the metaphor, past the allegory, into the very heart of what these symbols are telling us.” He pau sed, turning abruptly to Langdon. “This grid reveal s the exact location where the Lost Word is buried.” “Come again?” Langdon shifted uneasily in his chair, suddenly fea ring that the trauma of the evening had left Peter disorientated and confused. “Robert, legend has always described the Masonic Pyramid as a map—a very specific map—a map that could guide the worthy to the secret location of th e Lost Word.” Solomon tapped the grid of symbols in front of Langdon. “I guarantee you, these symbols are exa ctly what legend says they are . . . a map . A specific diagram that reveals exactly where we will find the staircase that leads down to the Lost Word.” Langdon gave an uneasy laugh, treading carefully no w. “Even if I believed the Legend of the Masonic Pyramid, this grid of symbols can’t possibly be a m ap. Look at it. It looks nothing like a map.” Solomon smiled. “Sometimes all it takes is a tiny s hift of perspective to see something familiar in a totally new light.” Langdon looked again but saw nothing new. “Let me ask you a question,” Peter said. “When Maso ns lay cornerstones, do you know why we lay them in the northeast corner of a building?” “Sure, because the northeast corner receives the fi rst rays of morning light. It is symbolic of the po wer of architecture to climb out of the earth into the lig ht.” “Right,” Peter said. “So perhaps you should look there for the first rays of light.” He motioned to the g rid. “In the northeast corner.” Langdon returned his eyes to the page, moving his g aze to the upper right or northeast corner. The sym bol in that corner was . “A downward-pointing arrow,” Langdon said, trying t o grasp Solomon’s point. “Which means . . . beneath Heredom.” "},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"“ No, Robert, not beneath, ” Solomon replied. “ Think. This grid is not a metaphorical maze. It ’ s a map . And on a map, a directional arrow that points down means—” “South,” Langdon exclaimed, startled. “Exactly!” Solomon replied, grinning now with excit ement. “Due south! On a map, down is south. Moreover, on a map, the word Heredom would not be a metaphor for heaven, it would be th e name of a geographic location.” “The House of the Temple? You’re saying this map is pointing . . . due south of this building?” “Praise God!” Solomon said, laughing. “Light dawns at last.” Langdon studied the grid. “But, Peter . . . even if you’re right, due south of this building could be anywhere on a longitude that’s over twenty-four thousand mil es long.” “No, Robert. You are ignoring the legend, which cla ims the Lost Word is buried in D.C. That shortens t he line substantially. In addition, legend also claims that a large stone sits atop the opening of the staircase . . . and that this stone is engraved with a message in a n ancient language . . . as a kind of marker so the worthy can find it.” Langdon was having trouble taking any of this serio usly, and while he didn’t know D.C. well enough to picture what was due south of their current locatio n, he was pretty certain there was no huge engraved stone atop a buried staircase. “The message inscribed on the stone,” Peter said, “ is right here before our eyes.” He tapped the third row of the grid before Langdon. “ This is the inscription, Robert! You’ve solved the puzz le!” Dumbfounded, Langdon studied the seven symbols. Solved? Langdon had no idea whatsoever what these seven di sparate symbols could possibly mean, and he was damned sure they were not engraved anywhere in the nation’s capital . . . pa rticularly on a giant stone over a staircase. “Peter,” he said, “I don’ t see how this sheds any light at all. I know of no stone in D.C. engraved with this . . . message.” Solomon patted him on the shoulder. “You have walke d past it and never seen it. We all have. It is sitting in plain view, like the mysteries themselves. And toni ght, when I saw these seven symbols, I realized in an instant that the legend was true. The Lost Word is buried in D.C. . . . and it does rest at the bottom of a long staircase beneath an enormous engraved stone.” Mystified, Langdon remained silent. “Robert, tonight I believe you have earned the righ t to know the truth.” Langdon stared at Peter, trying to process what he had just heard. “You’re going to tell me where the Lost Word is buried?” “ No, ” Solomon said, standing up with a smile. “ I ’ m going to show you. ”"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":" Five minutes later, Langdon was buckling himself in to the backseat of the Escalade beside Peter Solomo n. Simkins climbed in behind the wheel as Sato approac hed across the parking lot. “Mr. Solomon?” the director said, lighting a cigare tte as she arrived. “I’ve just made the call you re quested.” “And?” Peter asked through his open window. “I ordered them to give you access. Briefly.” “Thank you.” Sato studied him, looking curious. “I must say, it’ s a most unusual request.” Solomon gave an enigmatic shrug. Sato let it go, circling around to Langdon’s window and rapping with her knuckles. Langdon lowered the window. “Professor,” she said, with no hint of warmth. “You r assistance tonight, while reluctant, was critical to our success . . . and for that, I thank you.” She took a long drag on her cigarette and blew it sideways. “ However, one final bit of advice. The next time a senior adm inistrator of the CIA tells you she has a national- security crisis . . .” Her eyes flashed black. “Leave the bu llshit in Cambridge.” Langdon opened his mouth to speak, but Director Ino ue Sato had already turned and was headed off acros s the parking lot toward a waiting helicopter. Simkins glanced over his shoulder, stone-faced. “Ar e you gentlemen ready?” “Actually,” Solomon said, “just one moment.” He produced a small, folded piece of dark fabric an d handed it to Langdon. “Robert, I’d like you to put this on be fore we go anywhere.” Puzzled, Langdon examined the cloth. It was black v elvet. As he unfolded it, he realized he was holdin g a Masonic hoodwink—the traditional blindfold of a fir st-degree initiate. What the hell? Peter said, “I’d prefer you not see where we’re goi ng.” Langdon turned to Peter. “You want to blindfold me for the journey?” Solomon grinned. “My secret. My rules.” CHAPTER 127 The breeze felt cold outside CIA headquarters in Langley. Nol a Kaye was shivering as she followed sys-sec Rick Parrish across the agency’s moonlit central co urtyard. Where is Rick taking me? The crisis of the Masonic video had been averted, t hank God, but Nola still felt uneasy. The redacted file on the CIA director ’ s partition remained a mystery, and it was nagging at her. She and Sato would debrief in the"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"morning, and Nola wanted all the facts. Finally, sh e had called Rick Parrish and demanded his help. Now, as she followed Rick to some unknown location outside, Nola could not push the bizarre phrases fr om her memory: Secret location underground where the . . . somewhere in Washington, D.C., the coordinates . . . uncovered an ancient portal that led . . . warning the pyramid holds dangerous . . . decipher this engraved symbolon to unveil . . . “You and I agree,” Parrish said as they walked, “tha t the hacker who spidered those keywords was defini tely searching for information about the Masonic Pyramid .” Obviously, Nola thought. “It turns out, though, the hacker stumbled onto a f acet of the Masonic mystery I don’t think he expect ed.” “What do you mean?” “ Nola, you know how the CIA director sponsors an int ernal discussion forum for Agency employees to shar e their ideas about all kinds of things?” “Of course.” The forums provided Agency personnel a safe place to chat online about various topics and gave the director a kind of virtual gateway to his staff. “The director’s forums are hosted on his private pa rtition, and yet in order to provide access to empl oyees of all clearance levels, they’re located outside the director’s classified firewall.” “What are you getting at?” she demanded as they rou nded a corner near the Agency cafeteria. “In a word . . .” Parrish pointed into the darkness. “That.” Nola glanced up. Across the plaza in front of them was a massive metal sculpture glimmering in the moonlight. In an agency that boasted over five hundred pieces of original art, this sculpture—titled Kryptos —was by far the most famous. Greek for “hidden,” Kryptos was the work of American artist James Sanborn and had become something of a legend here at the CIA. The work consisted of a massive S-shaped panel of c opper, set on its edge like a curling metal wall. Engraved into the expansive surface of the wall wer e nearly two thousand letters . . . organized into a baffling code. As if this were not enigmatic enough, positio ned carefully in the area around the encrypted S- wall were numerous other sculptural elements—granite slabs at odd angles, a compass rose, a magnetic lodestone, and even a message in Morse code that referenced “lucid memory” and “shadow forces.” Most fans believed tha t these pieces were clues that would reveal how to de cipher the sculpture. Kryptos was art . . . but it was also an enigma. Attempting to decipher its encoded secret had becom e an obsession for cryptologists both inside and ou tside the CIA. Finally, a few years back, a portion of th e code had been broken, and it became national news . Although much of Kryptos ’s code remained unsolved to this day, the sections that had been deciphered were so bizarre that they made the sculpture only more m ysterious. It referenced secret underground locatio ns, portals that led into ancient tombs, longitudes and latitudes . . . Nola could still recall bits and pieces of the deci phered sections: The information was gathered and transmitted underground to an unknown location . . . It was totally invisible . . . hows that possible . . . they used the earths magnetic field . . . Nola had never paid much attention to the sculpture or cared if it was ever fully deciphered. At the m oment,"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"however, she wanted answers. “ Why are you showing me Kryptos ? ” Parrish gave her a conspiratorial smile and dramati cally extracted a folded sheet of paper from his po cket. “Voilà, the mysterious redacted document you were s o concerned about. I accessed the complete text.” Nola jumped. “You snooped the director’s classified partition?” “No. That’s what I was getting at earlier. Have a l ook.” He handed her the file. Nola seized the page and unfolded it. When she saw the standard Agency headers at the top of the page, she cocked her head in surprise. This document was not classified. Not even close. EMPLOYEE DISCUSSION BOARD: KRYPTOS COMPRESSED STORAGE: THREAD #2456282.5 Nola found herself looking at a series of postings that had been compressed into a single page for mor e efficient storage. “Your keyword document,” Rick said, “is some cipher -punks rambling about Kryptos .” Nola scanned down the document until she spotted a sentence containing a familiar set of keywords. Jim, the sculpture says it was transmitted to a secret location UNDERGROUND where the info was hidden. “This text is from the director’s online Kryptos forum,” Rick explained. “The forum’s been going fo r years. There are literally thousands of postings. I’m not surprised one of them happened to contain all the keywords.” Nola kept scanning down until she spotted another p osting containing keywords. Even though Mark said the code’s lat/long headings point somewhere in WASHINGTON, D.C., the coordinates he used were off by one degree--Kryptos basically points back to itself. Parrish walked over to the statue and ran his palm across the cryptic sea of letters. “A lot of this c ode has yet to be deciphered, and there are plenty of people wh o think the message might actually relate to ancien t Masonic secrets.” Nola now recalled murmurs of a Masonic/ Kryptos link, but she tended to ignore the lunatic fringe. Then again, looking around at the various pieces of the sculpture arranged around the plaza, she realized t hat it was a code in pieces—a symbolon—just like the Masonic P yramid. Odd. For a moment, Nola could almost see Kryptos as a modern Masonic Pyramid—a code in many pieces, made of different materials, each playing a role. “Do yo u think there’s any way Kryptos and the Masonic Pyramid might be hiding the same secret?” “Who knows?” Parrish shot Kryptos a frustrated look. “I doubt we’ll ever know the whole message. That is, unless someone can convince the director to unlock his safe and sneak a peek at the solution.” Nola nodded. It was all coming back to her now. Whe n Kryptos was installed, it arrived with a sealed"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"envelope containing a complete decryption of the sc ulpture ’ s codes. The sealed solution was entrusted to then–CIA director William Webster, who locked it in his office safe. The document was allegedly still there, having been transferred from director to director o ver the years. Strangely, Nola’s thoughts of William Webster spark ed her memory, bringing back yet another portion of Kryptos ’s deciphered text: IT’S BURIED OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. WHO KNOWS THE EXACT LOCATION? ONLY WW. Although nobody knew exactly what was buried out there, most people believed the WW was a reference to William Webster. Nola had heard whispers once that it referred in fact to a man named William Whiston— a Royal Society theologian—although she had never bot hered to give it much thought. Rick was talking again. “I’ve got to admit, I’m not really into artists, but I think this guy Sanborn’ s a serious genius. I was just looking online at his Cyrillic Projector project? It shines giant Russian letters from a KG B document on mind control. Freaky.” Nola was no longer listening. She was examining the paper, where she had found the third key phrase in another posting. Right, that whole section is verbatim from some fam ous archaeologist’s diary, telling about the moment he dug down and uncovered an ANCIENT PORTAL that led to the tomb of Tutankhamen. The archaeologist who was quoted on Kryptos, Nola knew, was in fact famed Egyptologist Howard C arter. The next posting referenced him by name. I just skimmed the rest of Carter’s field notes onl ine, and it sounds like he found a clay tablet warn ing the PYRAMID holds dangerous consequences for anyone who disturbs the peace of the pharaoh. A curse! Should we be worried? :) Nola scowled. “Rick, for God’s sake, this idiot’s pyramid referen ce isn’t even right. Tutankhamen wasn’t buried in a pyramid . He was buried in the Valley of the Kings. Don’t c ryptologists watch the Discovery Channel?” Parrish shrugged. “Techies.” Nola now saw the final key phrase. Guys, you know I’m not a conspiracy theorist, but J im and Dave had better decipher this ENGRAVED SYMBOLON to unveil its final secret before the worl d ends in 2012 . . . Ciao. “Anyhow,” Parrish said, “I figured you’d want to kno w about the Kryptos forum before you accused the CIA director of harboring classified documentation abou t an ancient Masonic legend. Somehow, I doubt a man as powerful as the CIA director has time for that sort of thing.” Nola pictured the Masonic video and its images of a ll the influential men participating in an ancient rite. If Rick had any idea . . . In the end, she knew, whatever Kryptos ultimately revealed, the message definitely had my stical undertones. She gazed up at the gleaming piece of art—a three-d imensional code standing silently at the heart of o ne of the nation’s premier intelligence agencies—and she wondered if it would ever give up its final secret. "},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"As she and Rick headed back inside, Nola had to smi le. It ’s buried out there somewhere. CHAPTER 128 This is crazy. Blindfolded, Robert Langdon could see nothing as th e Escalade sped southward along the deserted street s. On the seat beside him, Peter Solomon remained sile nt. Where is he taking me? Langdon’s curiosity was a mix of intrigue and appre hension, his imagination in overdrive as it tried desperately to put the pieces together. Peter had n ot wavered from his claim. The Lost Word? Buried at the bottom of a staircase that’s covered by a massive, engraved stone? It all seemed impossible. The stone’s alleged engraving was still lodged in L angdon’ s memory . . . and yet the seven symbols, as far as he could tell, made no sense together at all. The Stonemason’s Square: the symbol of honesty and being “true.” The letters Au: the scientific abbreviation for the element gold. The Sigma: the Greek letter S, the mathematical symbol for the sum of all parts. The Pyramid: the Egyptian symbol of man reaching he avenward. The Delta: the Greek letter D, the mathematical symbol for change. Mercury: as depicted by its most ancient alchemical symbol. The Ouroboros: the symbol of wholeness and at-one-m ent. Solomon still insisted these seven symbols were a “ message.” But if this was true, then it was a messa ge Langdon had no idea how to read. The Escalade slowed suddenly and turned sharply rig ht, onto a different surface, as if into a driveway or access road. Langdon perked up, listening intently for clues as to their whereabouts. They’d been driv ing for less than ten minutes, and although Langdon had tri ed to follow in his mind, he had lost his bearings quickly. For all he knew, they were now pulling back into th e House of the Temple. The Escalade came to a stop, and Langdon heard the window roll down. "},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"“ Agent Simkins, CIA, ” their driver announced. “ I believe you ’ re expecting us. ” “Yes, sir,” a sharp military voice replied. “Direct or Sato phoned ahead. One moment while I move the security barricade.” Langdon listened with rising confusion, now sensing they were entering a military base. As the car beg an moving again, along an unusually smooth stretch of pavement, he turned his head blindly toward Solomon . “Where are we, Peter?” he demanded. “Do not remove your blindfold.” Peter’s voice was stern. The vehicle continued a short distance and again sl owed to a stop. Simkins killed the engine. More voi ces. Military. Someone asked for Simkins’s identificatio n. The agent got out and spoke to the men in hushed tones. Langdon’s door was suddenly being opened, and power ful hands assisted him out of the car. The air felt cold. It was windy. Solomon was beside him. “Robert, just let Agent Sim kins lead you inside.” Langdon heard metal keys in a lock . . . and then t he creak of a heavy iron door swinging open. It sou nded like an ancient bulkhead. Where the hell are they taking me?! Simkins’s hands guided Langdon in the direction of the metal door. They stepped over a threshold. “Str aight ahead, Professor.” It was suddenly quiet. Dead. Deserted. The air insi de smelled sterile and processed. Simkins and Solomon flanked Langdon now, guiding hi m blindly down a reverberating corridor. The floor felt like stone beneath his loafers. Behind them, the metal door slammed loudly, and Lan gdon jumped. The locks turned. He was sweating now beneath his blindfold. He wanted only to tear it of f. They stopped walking now. Simkins let go of Langdon’s arm, and there was a se ries of electronic beeps followed by an unexpected rumble in front of them, which Langdon imagined had to be a security door sliding open automatically. “Mr. Solomon, you and Mr. Langdon continue on alone . I’ll wait for you here,” Simkins said. “Take my flashlight.” “Thank you,” Solomon said. “We won’t be long.” Flashlight?! Langdon’s heart was pounding wildly now. Peter took Langdon’s arm in his own and inched forw ard. “Walk with me, Robert.” They moved slowly together across another threshold , and the security door rumbled shut behind them. Peter stopped short. “Is something wrong?” Langdon was suddenly feeling queasy and off balance . “I think I just need to take off this blindfold.” “Not yet, we’re almost there.” “Almost where ?” Langdon felt a growing heaviness in the pit of h is stomach. "},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"“ I told you — I ’ m taking you to see the staircase that descends to the Lost Word. ” “Peter, this isn’t funny!” “It’s not meant to be. It’s meant to open your mind, Robert. It’s meant to remind you that there are mysteries in this world that even you have yet to lay eyes upon. And before I take one m ore step with you, I want you to do something for me. I want you to believe . . . just for an instant . . . believe in the legend. Believe that you are about to peer down a winding staircase that plunges hundreds of feet to one of humankind’s gre atest lost treasures.” Langdon felt dizzy. As much as he wanted to believe his dear friend, he could not. “Is it much farther ?” His velvet hoodwink was drenched in sweat. “No. Only a few more steps, actually. Through one l ast door. I’ll open it now.” Solomon let go of him for a moment, and as he did s o, Langdon swayed, feeling light-headed. Unsteady, he reached out for stability, and Peter was quickly ba ck at his side. The sound of a heavy automatic door rumbled in front of them. Peter took Langdon’s arm and they moved forward again. “This way.” They inched across another threshold, and the door slid closed behind them. Silence. Cold. Langdon immediately sensed that this place, whateve r it was, had nothing to do with the world on the o ther side of the security doors. The air was dank and ch illy, like a tomb. The acoustics felt dull and cram ped. He felt an irrational bout of claustrophobia settling in. “A few more steps.” Solomon guided him blindly arou nd a corner and positioned him precisely. Finally, he said, “Take off your blindfold.” Langdon seized the velvet hoodwink and tore it from his face. He looked all around to find out where h e was, but he was still blind. He rubbed his eyes. Nothing . “Peter, it’s pitch-black!” “Yes, I know. Reach in front of you. There’s a rail ing. Grasp it.” Langdon groped in the darkness and found an iron ra iling. “Now watch.” He could hear Peter fumbling with somet hing, and suddenly a blazing flashlight beam pierce d the darkness. It was pointed at the floor, and befo re Langdon could take in his surroundings, Solomon directed the flashlight out over the railing and po inted the beam straight down. Langdon was suddenly staring into a bottomless shaf t . . . an endless winding staircase that plunged d eep into the earth. My God! His knees nearly buckled, and he gripped the raili ng for support. The staircase was a traditional square spiral, and he could see at leas t thirty landings descending into the earth before the flashlight faded to nothing. I can’t even see the bottom! “Peter . . .” he stammered. “What is this place!” “I’ll take you to the bottom of the staircase in a moment, but before I do, you need to see something else.” Too overwhelmed to protest, Langdon let Peter guide him away from the stairwell and across the strange little chamber. Peter kept the flashlight trained o n the worn stone floor beneath their feet, and Lang don could get no real sense of the space around them . . . ex cept that it was small. A tiny stone chamber. "},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"They arrived quickly at the room ’ s opposite wall, in which was embedded a rectangle of glass. Langdon thought it might be a window into a room beyond, an d yet from where he stood, he saw only darkness on the other side. “Go ahead,” Peter said. “Have a look.” “What’s in there?” Langdon flashed for an instant o n the Chamber of Reflection beneath the Capitol Building, and how he had believed, for a moment, th at it might contain a portal to some giant undergro und cavern. “Just look, Robert.” Solomon inched him forward. “A nd brace yourself, because the sight will shock you.” Having no idea what to expect, Langdon moved toward the glass. As he neared the portal, Peter turned o ut the flashlight, plunging the tiny chamber into tota l darkness. As his eyes adjusted, Langdon groped in front of hi m, his hands finding the wall, finding the glass, h is face moving closer to the transparent portal. Still only darkness beyond. He leaned closer . . . pressing his face to the gla ss. Then he saw it. The wave of shock and disorientation that tore thro ugh Langdon’s body reached down inside and spun his internal compass upside down. He nearly fell backwa rd as his mind strained to accept the utterly unanticipated sight that was before him. In his wil dest dreams, Robert Langdon would never have guesse d what lay on the other side of this glass. The vision was a glorious sight. There in the darkness, a brilliant white light shon e like a gleaming jewel. Langdon now understood it all—the barricade on the access road . . . the guards at the main entrance . . . the heavy metal door outside . . . the automatic doors that rumbled open and closed . . . the heaviness in his stomach . . . the lightness in his head . . . and n ow this tiny stone chamber. “Robert,” Peter whispered behind him, “sometimes a change of perspective is all it takes to see the li ght.” Speechless, Langdon stared out through the window. His gaze traveled into the darkness of the night, traversing more than a mile of empty space, droppin g lower . . . lower . . . through the darkness . . . until it came to rest atop the brilliantly illuminated, star k white dome of the U.S. Capitol Building. Langdon had never seen the Capitol from this perspe ctive—hovering 555 feet in the air atop America’s g reat Egyptian obelisk. Tonight, for the first time in hi s life, he had ridden the elevator up to the tiny v iewing chamber . . . at the pinnacle of the Washington Mon ument. CHAPTER 129 Robert Langdon stood mesmerized at the glass portal, absorbing th e power of the landscape below him. Having ascended unknowingly hundreds of feet into t he air, he was now admiring one of the most"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"spectacular vistas he had ever seen. The shining dome of the U.S. Capitol rose like a mo untain at the east end of the National Mall. On eit her side of the building, two parallel lines of light stretc hed toward him . . . the illuminated facades of the Smithsonian museums . . . beacons of art, history, science, culture. Langdon now realized to his astonishment that much of what Peter had declared to be true . . . was in fact true. There is indeed a winding staircase . . . descendin g hundreds of feet beneath a massive stone. The huge capstone of this obelisk sat directly over his head , and Langdon now recalled a forgotten bit of trivi a that seemed to have eerie relevance: the capstone of the Washington Monument weighed precisely thirty-three hundred pounds. Again, the number 33. More startling, however, was the knowledge that thi s capstone’ s ultimate peak, the zenith of this obelisk, was crowned by a tiny, polished tip of aluminum—a metal as precious as gold in its day. The shining apex o f the Washington Monument was only about a foot tall, the same size as the Masonic Pyramid. Incredibly, this small metal pyramid bore a famous engraving— Laus Deo— and Langdon suddenly understood. This is the true message of the base of the stone pyramid. The seven symbols are a transliteration! The simplest of ciphers. The symbols are letters. The stonemason’s square—L The element gold—AU The Greek Sigma—S The Greek Delta—D Alchemical mercury—E The Ouroboros — O"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":" “Laus Deo,” Langdon whispered. The well-known Latin phrase—mea ning “praise God”—was inscribed on the tip of the Washington Monument in script letter s only one inch tall. On full display . . . and yet invisible to all. Laus Deo. “Praise God,” Peter said behind him, flipping on th e soft lighting in the chamber. “The Masonic Pyramid ’s final code.” Langdon turned. His friend was grinning broadly, an d Langdon recalled that Peter had actually spoken the words “praise God” earlier inside the Masonic libra ry. And I still missed it. Langdon felt a chill to realize how apt it was that the legendary Masonic Pyramid had guided him here . . . to America’s great obelisk—the symbol of ancient mysti cal wisdom—rising toward the heavens at the heart o f a nation. In a state of wonder, Langdon began moving counterc lockwise around the perimeter of the tiny square ro om, arriving now at another viewing window. North. Through this northward-facing window, Langdon gazed down at the familiar silhouette of the White House directly in front of him. He raised his eyes to the horizon, where the straight line of Sixteenth Stre et ran due north toward the House of the Temple. I am due south of Heredom. He continued around the perimeter to the next windo w. Looking west, Langdon’s eyes traced the long rectangle of the reflecting pool to the Lincoln Mem orial, its classical Greek architecture inspired by the Parthenon in Athens, Temple to Athena—goddess of he roic undertakings. Annuit coeptis, Langdon thought. God favors our undertaking. Continuing to the final window, Langdon gazed south ward across the dark waters of the Tidal Basin, whe re the Jefferson Memorial shone brightly in the night. The gently sloping cupola, Langdon knew, was model ed after the Pantheon, the original home to the great Roman gods of mythology. Having looked in all four directions, Langdon now t hought about the aerial photos he had seen of the National Mall — her four arms outstretched from the Washington Monu ment toward the cardinal points of the compass. I am standing at the crossroads of America. Langdon continued back around to where Peter was st anding. His mentor was beaming. “ Well, Robert, this is it. The Lost Word. This is where it’s buried. The Masonic Pyramid led us here .” Langdon did a double take. He had all but forgotten about the Lost Word. “ Robert, I know of nobody more trustworthy than you. And after a night like tonight, I believe you dese rve to know what this is all about. As promised in legend, the Lost Word is indeed buried at the bottom of a winding staircase.” He motioned to the mouth of the monument’s long stairwell. Langdon had finally started to get his feet back un der him, but now he was puzzled. Peter quickly reached into his pocket and pulled ou t a small object. “Do you remember this?” Langdon took the cube-shaped box that Peter had ent rusted to him long ago. “Yes . . . but I’m afraid I didn’t do a very good job of protecting it. ”"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":" Solomon chuckled. “Perhaps the time had come for it to see the light of day.” Langdon eyed the stone cube, wondering why Peter ha d just handed it to him. “What does this look like to you?” Peter asked. Langdon eyed the 1514 and recalled his first impre ssion when Katherine had unwrapped the package. “A cornerstone.” “Exactly,” Peter replied. “Now, there are a few thi ngs you might not know about cornerstones. First, t he concept of laying a cornerstone comes from the Old Testame nt.” Langdon nodded. “The Book of Psalms.” “Correct. And a true cornerstone is always buried beneath the ground—symbolizing the building’s init ial step upward out of the earth toward the heavenly li ght.” Langdon glanced out at the Capitol, recalling that its cornerstone was buried so deep in the foundatio n that, to this day, excavations had been unable to find it . “And finally,” Solomon said, “like the stone box in your hand, many cornerstones are little vaults . . . and have hollow cavities so that they can hold buried t reasures . . . talismans, if you will—symbols of ho pe for the future of the building about to be erected.” Langdon was well aware of this tradition, too. Even today, Masons laid cornerstones in which they seal ed meaningful objects—time capsules, photos, proclamat ions, even the ashes of important people. “My purpose in telling you this,” Solomon said, gla ncing over at the stairwell, “should be clear.” “You think the Lost Word is buried in the cornerstone of the Washington Monument?” “I don’t think , Robert. I know . The Lost Word was buried in the cornerstone of th is monument on July 4, 1848, in a full Masonic ritual.” Langdon stared at him. “Our Masonic forefathers bur ied a word ?!” Peter nodded. “They did indeed. They understood the true power of what they were burying.” All night, Langdon had been trying to wrap his mind around sprawling, ethereal concepts . . . the Anci ent Mysteries, the Lost Word, the Secrets of the Ages. He wanted something solid, and despite Peter’s clai ms that the key to it all was buried in a cornerstone 555 feet beneath him, Langdon was having a hard tim e accepting it. People study the mysteries for entire lifetimes and are still unable to access the power allegedly hidden there. Langdon flashed on Dürer’s Melencolia I —the image of the dejected Adept, surrounded by the tools of his failed efforts to unveil the mystical secrets of alchemy. If the secrets can actually be unlocked, they will not be found in one place! Any answer, Langdon had always believed, was spread across the world in thousands of volumes . . . encoded into writings of Pythagoras, Hermes, Heracl itus, Paracelsus, and hundreds of others. The answe r was found in dusty, forgotten tomes on alchemy, mys ticism, magic, and philosophy. The answer was hidde n in the ancient library of Alexandria, the clay tabl ets of Sumer, and the hieroglyphs of Egypt. “Peter, I’m sorry,” Langdon said quietly, shaking hi s head. “To understand the Ancient Mysteries is a lifelong process. I can’t imagine how the key could possibly rest within a single word.” Peter placed a hand on Langdon’s shoulder. “Robert, the Lost Word is not a ‘word.’” He gave a sage smi le. “ We only call it the ‘ Word ’ because that ’ s what the ancients called it . . . in the beginnin g. ”"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 130 In the beginning was the Word. Dean Galloway knelt at the Great Crossing of the Na tional Cathedral and prayed for America. He prayed that his beloved country would soon come to grasp the tr ue power of the Word—the recorded collection of the written wisdom of all the ancient masters—the spiri tual truths taught by the great sages. History had blessed mankind with the wisest of teac hers, profoundly enlightened souls whose understand ing of the spiritual and mental mysteries exceeded all understanding. The precious words of these Adepts— Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, Zoroaster, and countless o thers—had been transmitted through history in the oldest and most precious of vessels. Books. Every culture on earth had its own sacred book—its own Word—each one different and yet each one the same. For Christians, the Word was the Bible, for M uslims the Koran, for Jews the Torah, for Hindus th e Vedas, and on and on it went. The Word shall light the way. For America’s Masonic forefathers, the Word had bee n the Bible. And yet few people in history have understood its true message. Tonight, as Galloway knelt alone within the great c athedral, he placed his hands upon the Word—a well- worn copy of his own Masonic Bible. This treasured book, like all Masonic Bibles, contained the Old Testament, the New Testament, and a treasure trove of Masonic philosophical writings. Although Galloway’s eyes could no longer read the t ext, he knew the preface by heart. Its glorious mes sage had been read by millions of his brethren in countl ess languages around the world. The text read: TIME IS A RIVER . . . AND BOOKS ARE BOATS. MANY VOL UMES START DOWN THAT STREAM, ONLY TO BE WRECKED AND LOST BEYOND RECALL I N ITS SANDS. ONLY A FEW, A VERY FEW, ENDURE THE TESTINGS OF TIME AND LIVE TO B LESS THE AGES FOLLOWING. There is a reason these volumes survived, while oth ers vanished. As a scholar of faith, Dean Galloway had always found it astonishing that the ancient spirit ual texts—the most studied books on earth—were, in fact, the least understood. Concealed within those pages, there hides a wondrou s secret. One day soon the light would dawn, and mankind woul d finally begin to grasp the simple, transformative truth of the ancient teachings . . . and take a qua ntum leap forward in understanding his own magnific ent nature. "},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 131 The winding staircase that descends the spine of the Washingto n Monument consists of 896 stone steps that spiral around an open elevator shaft. Langdon and S olomon were making their way down, Langdon still grappling with the startling fact that Peter had sh ared with him only moments ago: Robert, buried within the hollow cornerstone of this monument, our forefather s placed a single copy of the Word—the Bible—which waits in darkness at the foot of this staircase. As they descended, Peter suddenly stopped on a land ing and swung his flashlight beam to illuminate a l arge stone medallion embedded in the wall. What in the world?! Langdon jumped when he saw the carving. The medallion depicted a frightening cloaked figure holding a scythe and kneeling beside an hourglass. The figure’s arm was raised, and his index finger was e xtended, pointing directly at a large open Bible, a s if to say: “The answer is in there!” Langdon stared at the carving and then turned to Pe ter. His mentor’s eyes shone with mystery. “I’d like you to consider something, Robert.” His voice echoed d own the empty stairwell. “ Why do you think the Bible has survived thousands of y ears of tumultuous history? Why is it still here? Is it because its stories are such compelling reading? Of course not . . . but t here is a reason. There is a reason Christian monks spend lifetimes attempting to deci pher the Bible. There is a reason that Jewish mystics and Kabbalists pore over the Ol d Testament. And that reason , Robert, is that there exist powerful secrets hidden in the pages of this ancien t book . . . a vast collection of untapped wisdom w aiting to be unveiled.” Langdon was no stranger to the theory that the Scri ptures contained a hidden layer of meaning, a conce aled message that was veiled in allegory, symbolism, and parable. “The prophets warn us,” Peter continued, “that the language used to share their secret mysteries is a cryptic one. The Gospel of Mark tells us, ‘Unto you is give n to know the mystery . . . but it will be told in parable.’ Proverbs cautions that the sayings of the wise are ‘riddles,’ while Corinthians talks of ‘hidden wisdo m.’ The Gospel of John forewarns: ‘I will speak to you in p arable . . . and use dark sayings.’ ” Dark sayings, Langdon mused, knowing this strange phrase made nu merous odd appearances in Proverbs as well as in Psalm 78. I will open my mouth in a parable and utter dark sa yings of old. The concept of a “dark saying,” Langdon had learned, did not mean that the saying was “evil” but rather that its true meaning was shadowed or obscured from the light. “And if you have any doubts,” Peter added, “Corinth ians overtly tells us that the parables have two la yers of meaning: ‘milk for babes and meat for men’—where th e milk is a watered-down reading for infantile minds, and the meat is the true message, accessible only to mature min ds.” Peter raised the flashlight, again illuminating the carving of the cloaked figure pointing intently at the Bible. “I know you are a skeptic, Robert, but consider thi s. If the Bible does not contain hidden meaning, then why have so many of history’s finest minds—including br illiant scientists at the Royal Society—become so obsessed with studying it? Sir Isaac Newton wrote m ore than a million words attempting to decipher the true meaning of the Scripture, including a 1704 manuscri pt that claimed he had extracted hidden scientific information from the Bible!” Langdon knew this was true. “ And Sir Francis Bacon, ” Peter continued, “ the luminary hired by King James to literally create the"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"authorized King James Bible, became so utterly conv inced that the Bible contained cryptic meaning that he wrote in his own codes, which are still studied today! Of course, a s you know, Bacon was a Rosicrucian and penned The Wisdom of the Ancients .” Peter smiled. “ Even the iconoclastic poet William Blake hinted tha t we should read between the lines.” Langdon was familiar with the verse: BOTH READ THE BIBLE DAY AND NIGHT, BUT THOU READ BLACK WHERE I READ WHITE. “And it wasn’t just the European luminaries,” Peter continued, descending faster now. “It was here , Robert, at the very core of this young American nation, tha t our brightest forefathers—John Adams, Ben Frankli n, Thomas Paine—all warned of the profound dangers of interpreting the Bible literally . In fact, Thomas Jefferson was so convinced the Bible’s true message was hidden that he literally cut up the pages and reedited the book, attempting, in his words, ‘ to do away with the artificial scaffolding and rest ore the genuine doctrines.’ ” Langdon was well aware of this strange fact. The Je ffersonian Bible was still in print today and inclu ded many of his controversial revisions, among them the removal of the virgin birth and the resurrection. Incredibly, the Jeffersonian Bible had been present ed to every incoming member of Congress during the first half of the nineteenth century. “Peter, you know I find this topic fascinating, and I can understand that it might be tempting for bright minds to imagine the Scriptures contain hidden meaning, b ut it makes no logical sense to me. Any skilled pro fessor will tell you that teaching is never done in code.” “I’m sorry?” “Teachers teach , Peter. We speak openly . Why would the prophets—the greatest teachers in h istory— obscure their language? If they hoped to change the world, why would they speak in code? Why not speak plainly so the world could understand?” Peter glanced back over his shoulder as he descende d, looking surprised by the question. “Robert, the Bible does not talk openly for the same reason the Ancient Mystery Schools we re kept hidden . . . for the same reason the neophytes had to be initiated before lea rning the secret teachings of the ages . . . for th e same reason the scientists in the Invisible College refu sed to share their knowledge with others. This info rmation is powerful , Robert. The Ancient Mysteries cannot be shouted f rom the rooftops. The mysteries are a flaming torch, which, in the hands of a master, can light t he way, but which, in the hands of a madman, can sc orch the earth.” Langdon stopped short. What is he saying? “Peter, I’m talking about the Bible. Why are you talking about the Ancient Mysteries ?” Peter turned. “Robert, don’t you see? The Ancient M ysteries and the Bible are the same thing.” Langdon stared in bewilderment. Peter was silent for several seconds, waiting for t he concept to soak in. “The Bible is one of the boo ks through which the mysteries have been passed down t hrough history. Its pages are desperately trying to tell us the secret. Don’t you understand? The ‘dark sayi ngs’ in the Bible are the whispers of the ancients, quietly sharing with us all of their secret wisdom.” Langdon said nothing. The Ancient Mysteries, as he understood them, were a kind of instruction manual for harnessing the latent power of the human mind . . . a recipe for personal apotheosis. He had never bee n able to accept the power of the mysteries, and certainly the notion that the Bible was somehow hiding a key to"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"these mysteries was an impossible stretch. “Peter, the Bible and the Ancient Mysteries are tot al opposites. The mysteries are all about the god within you . . . man as god. The Bible is all about the Go d above you . . . and man as a powerless sinner.” “Yes! Exactly! You’ve put your finger on the precis e problem! The moment mankind separated himself from God, the true meaning of the Word was lost. Th e voices of the ancient masters have now been drown ed out, lost in the chaotic din of self-proclaimed pra ctitioners shouting that they alone understand the Word . . . that the Word is written in their language and none other.” Peter continued down the stairs. “Robert, you and I both know that the ancients woul d be horrified if they saw how their teachings have been perverted . . . how religion has established itself as a tollbooth to heaven . . . how warriors march into battle believing God favors their cause. We’ve lost the Wo rd, and yet its true meaning is still within reach, right before our eyes. It exists in all the enduring text s, from the Bible to the Bhagavad Gita to the Koran and beyond. All of these texts are revered upon the altars of Free masonry because Masons understand what the world seems to have forgotten . . . that each of th ese texts, in its own way, is quietly whispering th e exact same message.” Peter’s voice welled with emotion. “ ‘Kn ow ye not that ye are gods?’” Langdon was struck by the way this famous ancient s aying kept surfacing tonight. He had reflected on i t while talking to Galloway and also at the Capitol B uilding while trying to explain The Apotheosis of Washington. Peter lowered his voice to a whisper. “The Buddha s aid, ‘You are God yourself.’ Jesus taught that ‘the kingdom of God is within you’ and even promised us, ‘The works I do, you can do . . . and greater.’ Even the first antipope—Hippolytus of Rome—quoted the same m essage, first uttered by the gnostic teacher Monoimus: ‘Abandon the search for God . . . instead, take yourself as the starti ng place.’ ” Langdon flashed on the House of the Temple, where t he Masonic Tyler’s chair bore two words of guidance carved across its back: KNOW THYSELF . “A wise man once told me,” Peter said, his voice fa int now, “ the only difference between you and God is that you have forgotten you are divine.” “Peter, I hear you—I do . And I’d love to believe we are gods, but I see no gods walking our earth. I see no superhumans.You can point to the alleged miracles o f the Bible, or any other religious text, but they are nothing but old stories fabricated by man and then exaggerated over time.” “Perhaps,” Peter said. “Or perhaps we simply need o ur science to catch up with the wisdom of the ancie nts.” He paused. “Funny thing is . . . I believe Katherin e’s research may be poised to do just that.” Langdon suddenly remembered that Katherine had dash ed off from the House of the Temple earlier. “Hey, where did she go, anyway?” “She’ll be here shortly,” Peter said, grinning. “Sh e went to confirm a wonderful bit of good fortune.” Outside, at the base of the monument, Peter Solomon felt invigorated as he inhaled the cold night air. He watched in amusement as Langdon stared intently at the ground, scratching his head and looking around at the foot of the obelisk. “Professor,” Peter joked, “the cornerstone that con tains the Bible is underground. You can’t actually access the book, but I assure you it’s there.” “I believe you,” Langdon said, appearing lost in th ought. “It’s just . . . I noticed something.” Langdon stepped back now and surveyed the giant pla za on which the Washington Monument stood. The circular concourse was made entirely of white stone . . . except for two decorative courses of dark st one,"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"which formed two concentric circles around the monu ment. “A circle within a circle,” Langdon said. “I never r ealized the Washington Monument stands at the cente r of a circle within a circle.” Peter had to laugh. He misses nothing . “Yes, the great circumpunct . . . the universal s ymbol for God . . . at the crossroads of America.” He gave a coy shrug. “I’ m sure it’s just a coincidence.” Langdon seemed far off, gazing skyward now, his eye s ascending the illuminated spire, which shone star k white against the black winter sky. Peter sensed Langdon was beginning to see this crea tion for what it truly was . . . a silent reminder of ancient wisdom . . . an icon of enlightened man at the hear t of a great nation. Even though Peter could not see the tiny aluminum tip at the top, he knew it was there, man’s enlightened mind straining toward heaven. Laus Deo . “Peter?” Langdon approached, looking like a man who ’d endured some kind of mystical initiation. “I alm ost forgot,” he said, reaching into his pocket and prod ucing Peter’s gold Masonic ring. “I’ve been wanting to return this to you all night.” “Thank you, Robert.” Peter held out his left hand a nd took the ring, admiring it. “You know, all the s ecrecy and mystery surrounding this ring and the Masonic Pyramid . . . it had an enormous ef fect on my life. When I was a young man, the pyramid was given to me with t he promise that it hid mystical secrets. Its mere existence made me believe there were great mysteries in the world. It piqued my curiosity, fueled my sense of wonder, and inspired me to open my mind to the A ncient Mysteries.” He smiled quietly and slipped th e ring into his pocket. “I now realize that the Mason ic Pyramid’s true purpose was not to reveal the ans wers, but rather to inspire a fascination with them.” The two men stood in silence for a long while at th e foot of the monument. When Langdon finally spoke, his tone was serious. “ I need to ask you a favor, Peter . . . as a friend. ” “Of course. Anything.” Langdon made his request . . . firmly. Solomon nodded, knowing he was right. “I will.” “Right away,” Langdon added, motioning to the waitin g Escalade. “Okay . . . but one caveat.” Langdon rolled his eyes, chuckling. “Somehow you al ways get the last word.” “Yes, and there is one final thing I want you and Katherine to see.” “At this hour?” Langdon checked his watch. Solomon smiled warmly at his old friend. “It is Was hington’s most spectacular treasure . . . and somet hing very, very few people have ever seen.” CHAPTER 132"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":" Katherine Solomon’s heart felt light as she hurried up the hill toward the base of the Washington Monument. She had endured great shock and tragedy t onight, and yet her thoughts were refocused now, if only temporarily, on the wonderful news Peter had s hared with her earlier . . . news she had just conf irmed with her very own eyes. My research is safe. All of it. Her lab’s holographic data drives had been destroye d tonight, but earlier, at the House of the Temple, Peter had informed her that he had been secretly keeping backups of all her Noetic research in the SMSC exec utive offices. You know I’m utterly fascinated with your work , he had explained, and I wanted to follow your progress without disturbing you. “Katherine?” a deep voice called out. She looked up. A lone figure stood in silhouette at the base of th e illuminated monument. “Robert!” She hurried over and hugged him. “I heard the good news,” Langdon whispered. “You mu st be relieved.” Her voice cracked with emotion. “Incredibly.” The r esearch Peter had saved was a scientific tour de fo rce— a massive collection of experiments that proved human thought was a real and measurable force in the wor ld. Katherine’s experiments demonstrated the effect of human thought on everything from ice crystals t o random-event generators to the movement of subatomi c particles. The results were conclusive and irrefutable, with the potential to transform skepti cs into believers and affect global consciousness o n a massive scale. “Everything is going to change, Robe rt. Everything .” “Peter certainly thinks so.” Katherine glanced around for her brother. “Hospital,” Langdon said. “I insisted he go as a fa vor to me.” Katherine exhaled, relieved. “Thank you.” “He told me to wait for you here.” Katherine nodded, her gaze climbing the glowing whi te obelisk. “He said he was bringing you here. Something about ‘Laus Deo’ ? He didn’t elaborate.” Langdon gave a tired chuckle. “I’m not sure I entir ely understand it myself.” He glanced up at the top of the monument. “Your brother said quite a few things ton ight that I couldn’t get my mind around.” “Let me guess,” Katherine said. “Ancient Mysteries, science, and the Holy Scriptures?” “Bingo.” “Welcome to my world.” She winked. “Peter initiated me into this l ong ago. It fueled a lot of my research.” “Intuitively, some of what he said made sense.” Lan gdon shook his head. “But intellectually . . .” Katherine smiled and put her arm around him. “You k now, Robert, I may be able to help you with that.” Deep inside the Capitol Building, Architect Warren Bellamy was walking down a deserted hallway."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":" Only one thing left to do tonight, he thought. When he arrived at his office, he retrieved a very old key from his desk drawer. The key was black iro n, long and slender, with faded markings. He slid it into h is pocket and then prepared himself to welcome his guests. Robert Langdon and Katherine Solomon were on their way to the Capitol. At Peter’ s request, Bellamy was to provide them with a very rare opportunity—the chanc e to lay eyes upon this building’s most magnificent secret . . . something that could be revealed only by the Architect. CHAPTER 133 High above the floor of the Capitol Rotunda, Robert Langdon i nched nervously around the circular catwalk that extended just beneath the ceiling of the dome. He peered tentatively over the railing, dizzied by the height, still unable to believe it had been less th an ten hours since Peter’s hand had appeared in the middle of the floor below. On that same floor, the Architect of the Capitol wa s now a tiny speck some hundred and eighty feet bel ow, moving steadily across the Rotunda and then disappe aring. Bellamy had escorted Langdon and Katherine u p to this balcony, leaving them here with very specif ic instructions. Peter ’s instructions. Langdon eyed the old iron key that Bellamy had hand ed to him. Then he glanced over at a cramped stairw ell that ascended from this level . . . climbing higher still. God help me. These narrow stairs, according to the Architect, led up to a small metal door that could be unlocked with the iron key in Langdon’s hand. Beyond the door lay something that Peter insisted L angdon and Katherine see. Peter had not elaborated, but rather had left strict instructions regarding the p recise hour at which the door was to be opened. We have to wait to open the door? Why? Langdon checked his watch again and groaned. Slipping the key into his pocket, he gazed across t he gaping void before him at the far side of the ba lcony. Katherine had walked fearlessly ahead, apparently u nfazed by the height. She was now halfway around th e circumference, admiring every inch of Brumidi’s The Apotheosis of Washington, which loomed directly over their heads. From this rare vantage point, the fift een-foot-tall figures that adorned the nearly five thousand square feet of the Capitol Dome were visible in ast onishing detail. Langdon turned his back to Katherine, faced the out er wall, and whispered very quietly, “Katherine, th is is your conscience speaking. Why did you abandon Rober t?” Katherine was apparently familiar with the dome’s s tartling acoustical properties . . . because the wa ll whispered back. “Because Robert is being a chicken. He should come over here with me. We have plenty o f time before we’re allowed to open that door.” Langdon knew she was right and reluctantly made his way around the balcony, hugging the wall as he wen t. “This ceiling is absolutely amazing,” Katherine mar veled, her neck craned to take in the enormous sple ndor of the Apotheosis overhead. “Mythical gods all mixed in with scienti fic inventors and their creations? And to think this is the image at the center of our Capitol. ”"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":" Langdon turned his eyes upward to the sprawling for ms of Franklin, Fulton, and Morse with their technological inventions. A shining rainbow arched away from these figures, guiding his eye to George Washington ascending to heaven on a cloud. The great promise of man becoming God. Katherine said, “It’s as if the entire essence of t he Ancient Mysteries is hovering over the Rotunda.” Langdon had to admit, not many frescoes in the worl d fused scientific inventions with mythical gods an d human apotheosis. This ceiling’s spectacular collec tion of images was indeed a message of the Ancient Mysteries, and it was here for a reason. The foundi ng fathers had envisioned America as a blank canvas , a fertile field on which the seeds of the mysteries c ould be sown. Today, this soaring icon—the father o f our country ascending to heaven—hung silently above our lawmakers, leaders, and presidents . . . a bold reminder, a map to the future, a promise of a time when man would evolve to complete spiritual maturit y. “Robert,” Katherine whispered, her gaze still fixat ed on the massive figures of America’s great invent ors accompanied by Minerva. “It’s prophetic, really. To day, man’s most advanced inventions are being used to study man’s most ancient ideas. The science of Noet ics may be new, but it’s actually the oldest science on earth—the study of human thought.” She turned to hi m now, her eyes filled with wonder. “And we’re learning that the ancients actually understood thought more profoundly than we do today.” “Makes sense,” Langdon replied. “The human mind was the only technology the ancients had at their disposal. The early philosophers studied it relentl essly.” “Yes! The ancient texts are obsessed with the power of the human mind. The Vedas describe the flow of mind energy. The Pistis Sophia describes universal consciousness. The Zohar explores the nature of mind spirit. The Shamanic texts predict Einstein’s ‘remo te influence’ in terms of healing at a distance. It ’s all there! And don’t even get me started about the Bibl e.” “You, too?” Langdon said, chuckling. “Your brother tried to convince me that the Bible is encoded with scientific information.” “It certainly is ,” she said. “And if you don’t believe Peter, read s ome of Newton’s esoteric texts on the Bible. When you start to understand the cryptic parables i n the Bible, Robert, you realize it’s a study of th e human mind.” Langdon shrugged. “I guess I’d better go back and r ead it again.” “Let me ask you something,” she said, clearly not a ppreciating his skepticism. “When the Bible tells u s to ‘go build our temple’ . . . a temple that we must ‘ build with no tools and making no noise,’ what temple do you think it’s talking about?” “Well, the text does say your body is a temple.” “Yes, Corinthians 3:16. You are the temple of God.” She smiled at him. “And th e Gospel of John says the exact same thing. Robert, the Scriptures are well a ware of the power latent within us, and they are ur ging us to harness that power . . . urging us to build the temples of our minds .” “Unfortunately, I think much of the religious world is waiting for a real temple to be rebuilt. It’s part of the Messianic Prophecy.” “Yes, but that overlooks an important point. The Se cond Coming is the coming of man —the moment when mankind finally builds the temple of his mind.” “I don’t know,” Langdon said, rubbing his chin. “I’ m no Bible scholar, but I’m pretty sure the Scriptu res describe in detail a physical temple that needs to be built. The structure is de scribed as being in two parts— an outer temple called the Holy Place and an inner sanctuary called the Holy of Holies. The two parts are separated from each other by a thin veil.” "},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Katherine grinned. “ Pretty good recall for a Bible skeptic. By the way, have you ever seen an actual human brain? It’s built in two parts— an outer part called the dura mater and an inner pa rt called the pia mater. These two parts are separated by the arachnoid—a veil of weblike tissue.” Langdon cocked his head in surprise. Gently, she reached up and touched Langdon’s temple . “There’s a reason they call this your temple , Robert.” As Langdon tried to process what Katherine had said , he flashed unexpectedly on the gnostic Gospel of Mary: Where the mind is, there is the treasure. “Perhaps you’ve heard,” Katherine said, softly now, “about the brain scans taken of yogis while they meditate? The human brain, in advanced states of fo cus, will physically create a waxlike substance from the pineal gland. This brain secretion is unlike anythi ng else in the body. It has an incredible healing e ffect, can literally regenerate cells, and may be one of the r easons yogis live so long. This is real science , Robert. This substance has inconceivable properties and can be c reated only by a mind that is highly tuned to a deeply focused state.” “I remember reading about that a few years back.” “Yes, and on that topic, you’re familiar with the B ible’s account of ‘manna from heaven’?” Langdon saw no connection. “You mean the magical su bstance that fell from heaven to nourish the hungry ?” “Exactly. The substance was said to heal the sick, provide everlasting life, and, strangely, cause no waste in those who consumed it.” Katherine paused, as if wai ting for him to understand. “Robert?” she prodded. “A kind of nourishment that fell from heaven? ” She tapped her temple. “Magically heals the body? Creates no waste? Don’t you see? These are code words , Robert! Temple is code for ‘body.’ Heaven is code for ‘mind.’ Jacob ’s ladder is your spine. And manna is this rare brain secretion. When you see these c ode words in Scripture, pay attention. They are often markers for a more profound meaning concealed beneath the surface.” Katherine’s words were coming out in rapid-fire suc cession now, explaining how this same magical substance appeared throughout the Ancient Mysteries: Nectar of the Gods, Elixir of Life, Fountain of Youth, Philosopher’s Stone, ambrosia, dew, ojas, soma. Then she launched into an explanation about the brain’s pineal gland representing the all-seeing eye of God . “According to Matthew 6:22,” she said excitedly, “ ‘when your eye is single, your body fills with light.’ This concept is also represented by the Ajna chakra and the dot on a Hindu’s forehead, which—” Katherine stopped short, looking sheepish. “Sorry . . . I know I’ m rambling. I just find this all so exhilarating. For years I’ve studied the ancients’ claims of man’ s awesome mental power, and now science is showing us that accessing that power is an actual physical process. Our brai ns, if used correctly, can call forth powers that are quite literally superhuman. The Bible, lik e many ancient texts, is a detailed exposition of t he most sophisticated machine ever created . . . the human mind.” She sighed. “Incredibly, science has yet to scratc h the surface of the mind’s full promise.” “It sounds like your work in Noetics will be a quan tum leap forward.” “Or backward, ” she said. “The ancients already knew many of the scientific truths we’re now rediscovering. Within a matter of years, modern man will be forced to accept what is now unthinkable: our minds can generate energy capable of transforming physical matter.” She paused. “Particles react to our thoughts . . . which means our thoughts have the power to change the world.” Langdon smiled softly. “What my research has brought me to believe is this ,” Katherine said. “God is very real—a mental energ y that pervades everything. And we, as human beings, have been created in that image—” "},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"“ I ’ m sorry? ” Langdon interrupted. “ Created in the image of . . . mental energy? ” “Exactly. Our physical bodies have evolved over the ages, but it was our minds that were created in the image of God. We’ve been reading the Bible too lite rally. We learn that God created us in his image, b ut it’s not our physical bodies that resemble God, it’s our minds .” Langdon was silent now, fully engrossed. “ This is the great gift, Robert, and God is waiting for us to understand it. All around the world, we a re gazing skyward, waiting for God . . . never realizing that God is waiting for us .” Katherine paused, letting her words soak in. “We are creators, and yet we naively play the role of ‘the created .’ We see ourselves as helpless sheep buffeted around by the God who made us. We kn eel like frightened children, begging for help, for forgiveness, for good luck. But once we realize tha t we are truly created in the Creator’s image, we w ill start to understand that we, too, must be Creators. When we understand this fact, th e doors will burst wide open for human potential.” Langdon recalled a passage that had always stuck wi th him from the work of the philosopher Manly P. Ha ll: If the infinite had not desired man to be wise, he would not have bestowed upon him the faculty of kno wing. Langdon gazed up again at the image of The Apotheosis of Washington —the symbolic ascent of man to deity. The created . . . becoming the Creator. “The most amazing part,” Katherine said, “is that a s soon as we humans begin to harness our true power , we will have enormous control over our world. We will be able to design reality rather than merely react to it.” Langdon lowered his gaze. “That sounds . . . danger ous.” Katherine looked startled . . . and impressed. “Yes , exactly! If thoughts affect the world, then we must be very careful how we think. Destructive thoughts have influence, too , and we all know it’s far easier to destroy than it is to create.” Langdon thought of all the lore about needing to pr otect the ancient wisdom from the unworthy and shar e it only with the enlightened. He thought of the Invisi ble College, and the great scientist Isaac Newton’s request to Robert Boyle to keep “high silence” about their secret research. It cannot be communicated, Newton wrote in 1676, without immense damage to the world. “There’s an interesting twist here,” Katherine said . “The great irony is that all the religions of the world, for centuries, have been urging their followers to embr ace the concepts of faith and belief . Now science, which for centuries has derided religion as superstition, must admit that its next big frontier is quite lit erally the science of faith and belief . . . the power of focused conviction and intentio n. The same science that eroded our faith in the miraculous is now building a bridg e back across the chasm it created.” Langdon considered her words for a long time. Slowl y he raised his eyes again to the Apotheosis. “I have a question,” he said, looking back at Katherine. “Eve n if I could accept, just for an instant, that I ha ve the power to change physical matter with my mind, and l iterally manifest all that I desire . . . I’m afrai d I see nothing in my life to make me believe I have such p ower.” She shrugged. “Then you’re not looking hard enough. ” “Come on, I want a real answer. That’s the answer o f a priest . I want the answer of a scientist .” “You want a real answer? Here it is. If I hand you a violin and say you have the capability to use it to make incredible music, I am not lying. You do have the capability, but you’ll need enormous amou nts of practice to manifest it. This is no different from learning to use your mind, Robert. Well-directed thought is a learned skill. To manifest an intention requires laserlike focus, full sensory visualization, and a profound b elief. We have proven this in a lab. And just like playing a violin, there are people who exhibit greater natura l ability than others. Look to history. Look to the stories o f those enlightened minds who performed miraculous feats.” "},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"“ Katherine, please don ’ t tell me you actually believe in the miracles. I mean, seriously . . . turning w ater into wine, healing the sick with the touch of a hand?” Katherine took a long breath and blew it out slowly . “I have witnessed people transform cancer cells i nto healthy cells simply by thinking about them. I have witnessed human minds affecting the physical world in myriad ways. And once you see that happen, Robert, once this becomes part of your reality, then some o f the miracles you read about become simply a matter of d egree.” Langdon was pensive. “It’s an inspiring way to see the world, Katherine, but for me, it just feels lik e an impossible leap of faith. And as you know, faith ha s never come easily for me.” “Then don’t think of it as faith . Think of it simply as changing your perspective, accepting that the world is not precisely as you imagine. Historically, every m ajor scientific breakthrough began with a simple id ea that threatened to overturn all of our beliefs. The simp le statement ‘the earth is round’ was mocked as utt erly impossible because most people believed the oceans would flow off the planet. Heliocentricity was call ed heresy. Small minds have always lashed out at what they don’t understand. There are those who create . . . and those who tear down. That dynamic has existed f or all time. But eventually the creators find belie vers, and the number of believers reaches a critical mass , and suddenly the world becomes round, or the sola r system becomes heliocentric. Perception is transfor med, and a new reality is born.” Langdon nodded, his thoughts drifting now. “You have a funny look on your face,” she said. “Oh, I don’t know. For some reason I was just remem bering how I used to canoe out into the middle of t he lake late at night, lie down under the stars, and t hink about stuff like this.” She nodded knowingly. “I think we all have a simila r memory. Something about lying on our backs starin g up at the heavens . . . opens the mind.” She glance d up at the ceiling and then said, “Give me your ja cket.” “What?” He took it off and gave it to her. She folded it twice and laid it down on the catwalk like a long pillow. “Lie down.” Langdon lay on his back, and Katherine positioned h is head on half of the folded jacket. Then she lay down beside him—two kids, shoulder to shoulder on the na rrow catwalk, staring up at Brumidi’s enormous fres co. “Okay,” she whispered. “Put yourself in that same mi nd-set . . . a kid lying out in a canoe . . . looki ng up at the stars . . . his mind open and full of wonder.” Langdon tried to obey, although at the moment, pron e and comfortable, he was feeling a sudden wave of exhaustion. As his vision blurred, he perceived a m uted shape overhead that immediately woke him. Is that possible? He could not believe he hadn’t noticed it before, but the figures in The Apotheosis of Washington were clearly arranged in two concentric rings—a cir cle within a circle. The Apotheosis is also a circumpunct? Langdon wondered what else he had missed tonight. “There’s something important I want to tell you, Ro bert. There’s another piece to all this . . . a pie ce that I believe is the single most astonishing aspect of my research.” There’s more? Katherine propped herself on her elbow. “And I prom ise . . . if we as humans can honestly grasp this one simple truth . . . the world will change overnight. ” She now had his full attention. “I should preface this,” she said, “by reminding you of the Masonic mantras to ‘gather what is scattere d’ . . . to bring ‘ order from chaos ’ . . . to find ‘ at - one - ment. ’ ”"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":" “Go on.” Langdon was intrigued. Katherine smiled down at him. “We have scientifical ly proven that the power of human thought grows exponentially with the number of minds that share that thought.” Langdon remained silent, wondering where she was go ing with this idea. “What I’m saying is this . . . two heads are better than one . . . and yet two heads are not twice better, they are many, many times better. Multiple minds working in unison mag nify a thought’s effect . . . exponentially . This is the inherent power of prayer groups, healin g circles, singing in unison, and worshipping en ma sse. The idea of universal consciousness is no ethereal New Age concept. It’s a hard-core s cientific reality . . . and harnessing it has the potential to transform ou r world. This is the underlying discovery of Noetic Science. What’s more, it’s happening right now. You can feel it all around you. Technology is linking us in ways we never imagined possible: Twitter, Google, W ikipedia, and others—all blend to create a web of interconnected minds.” She laughed. “And I guarante e you, as soon as I publish my work, the Twitterati will all be sending tweets that say, ‘ learning about Noetics, ’ and interest in this science will explode exponentially.” Langdon’s eyelids felt impossibly heavy. “You know, I still haven’t learned how to send a twitter.” “A tweet ,” she corrected, laughing. “I’m sorry?” “Never mind. Close your eyes. I’ll wake you when it ’s time.” Langdon realized he had all but forgotten the old k ey the Architect had given them . . . and why they had come up here. As a new wave of exhaustion engulfed him, Langdon shut his eyes. In the darkness of his mind, he found himself thinking about universal consciousness . . . about Plato’s writings on “ the mind of the world” and “gathering God” . . . Jung’s “collective unconscious.” The notion was as simple as it was startling. God is found in the collection of Many . . . rather than in the One. “Elohim,” Langdon said suddenly, his eyes flying ope n again as he made an unexpected connection. “I’m sorry?” Katherine was still gazing down at him . “Elohim,” he repeated. “The Hebrew word for God in t he Old Testament! I’ve always wondered about it.” Katherine gave a knowing smile. “Yes. The word is plural .” Exactly! Langdon had never understood why the very first pa ssages of the Bible referred to God as a plural being. Elohim . The Almighty God in Genesis was described not as One . . . but as Many. “God is plural,” Katherine whispered, “because the minds of man are plural.” Langdon’s thoughts were spiraling now . . . dreams, memories, hopes, fears, revelations . . . all swir ling above him in the Rotunda dome. As his eyes began to close again, he found himself staring at three wor ds in Latin, painted within the Apotheosis. E PLURIBUS UNUM. “Out of many, one,” he thought, slipping off into sleep. "},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":" Epilogue Robert Langdon awoke slowly. Faces gazed down at him. Where am I? A moment later, he recalled where he was. He sat up slowly beneath the Apotheosis . His back felt stiff from lying on the hard catwalk. Where’s Katherine? Langdon checked his Mickey Mouse watch. It’s almost time. He pulled himself to his feet, peering cautiously over the banister into the gaping space below. “Katherine?” he called out. The word echoed back in the silence of the deserted Rotunda. Retrieving his tweed jacket from the floor, he brus hed it off and put it back on. He checked his pocke ts. The iron key the Architect had given him was gone. Making his way back around the walkway, Langdon hea ded for the opening the Architect had shown them . . . steep metal stairs ascending into cramped darknes s. He began to climb. Higher and higher he ascended . Gradually the stairway became more narrow and more inclined. Still Langdon pushed on. Just a little farther. The steps had become almost ladderlike now, the pas sage frighteningly constricted. Finally, the stairs ended, and Langdon stepped up onto a small landing. Before him was a heavy metal door. The iron key was in th e lock, and the door hung slightly ajar. He pushed, a nd the door creaked open. The air beyond felt cold. As Langdon stepped across the threshold into murky dar kness, he realized he was now outside. “I was just coming to get you,” Katherine said, smi ling at him. “It’s almost time.” When Langdon recognized his surroundings, he drew a startled breath. He was standing on a tiny skywalk that encircled the pinnacle of the U.S. Capitol Dom e. Directly above him, the bronze Statue of Freedom gazed out over the sleeping capital city. She faced the east, where the first crimson splashes of dawn had begun to paint the horizon. Katherine guided Langdon around the balcony until t hey were facing west, perfectly aligned with the National Mall. In the distance, the silhouette of t he Washington Monument stood in the early -morning light. From this vantage point, the towering obelisk looke d even more impressive than it had before. “When it was built,” Katherine whispered, “it was t he tallest structure on the entire planet.” Langdon pictured the old sepia photographs of stone masons on scaffolding, more than five hundred feet in the air, laying each block by hand, one by one. We are builders, he thought. We are creators. Since the beginning of time, man had sensed there w as something special about himself . . . something more. He had longed for powers he did not possess. He had dreamed of flying, of healing, and of transforming his world in every way imaginable."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":" And he had done just that. Today, the shrines to man’s accomplishments adorned the National Mall. The Smithsonian museums burgeoned with our inventions, our art, our science , and the ideas of our great thinkers. They told th e history of man as creator—from the stone tools in the Nativ e American History Museum to the jets and rockets i n the National Air and Space Museum. If our ancestors could see us today, surely they wo uld think us gods. As Langdon peered through the predawn mist at the s prawling geometry of museums and monuments before him, his eyes returned to the Washington Monument . He pictured the lone Bible in the buried cornersto ne and thought of how the Word of God was really the w ord of man . He thought about the great circumpunct, and how it had been embedded in the circular plaza beneath the monument at the crossroads of America. Langdon thou ght suddenly of the little stone box Peter had entr usted to him. The cube, he now realized, had unhinged and opened to form the same exact geometrical form—a cross with a circumpunct at its center. Langdon had to laugh. Even that little box was hinting at this crossroads. “Robert, look!” Katherine pointed to the top of the monument. Langdon lifted his gaze but saw nothing. Then, staring more intently, he glimpsed it. Across the Mall, a tiny speck of golden sunlight wa s glinting off the highest tip of the towering obel isk. The shining pinpoint grew quickly brighter, more radian t, gleaming on the capstone’s aluminum peak. Langdo n watched in wonder as the light transformed into a b eacon that hovered above the shadowed city. He pict ured the tiny engraving on the east-facing side of the a luminum tip and realized to his amazement that the first ray of sunlight to hit the nation’s capital, every sing le day, did so by illuminating two words: Laus Deo. “Robert,” Katherine whispered. “Nobody ever gets to come up here at sunrise. This is what Peter wanted us to witness.” Langdon could feel his pulse quickening as the glow atop the monument intensified. “He said he believes this is why the forefathers bu ilt the monument so tall. I don’t know if that’s tr ue, but I do know this —there’s a very old law decreeing that nothing tall er can be built in our capital city. Ever .” The light inched farther down the capstone as the s un crept over the horizon behind them. As Langdon watched, he could almost sense, all around him, the celestial spheres tracing their eternal orbits thr ough the void of space. He thought of the Great Architect of the Universe and how Peter had said specifically t hat the treasure he wanted to show Langdon could be unveile d only by the Architect. Langdon had assumed this meant Warren Bellamy. Wrong Architect . As the rays of sunlight strengthened, the golden gl ow engulfed the entirety of the thirty-three-hundre d-pound capstone. The mind of man . . . receiving enlightenment. The light then began inching down the monument, commencing the same descent it performed every morn ing. Heaven moving toward earth . . . God connecting to man. This process, Langdon realized, would reverse come evening. The sun would dip in the west, and the light would climb again from earth back to heaven . . . preparing for a new day. Beside him, Katherine shivered and inched closer. L angdon put his arm around her. As the two of them s tood side by side in silence, Langdon thought about all he had learned tonight. He thought of Katherine’s b elief that everything was about to change. He thought of Peter’s faith that an age of enlightenment was immi nent. And he thought of the words of a great prophet who had boldly declared: Nothing is hidden that will not be"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"made known; nothing is secret that will not come to light. As the sun rose over Washington, Langdon looked to the heavens, where the last of the nighttime stars were fading out. He thought about science, about faith, about man. He thought about how every culture, in e very country, in every time, had always shared one thing . We all had the Creator. We used different names, different faces, and different prayers, but God was the universal constant for man. God was the symbol we all shared . . . the symbol of all the mysteries of lif e that we could not understand. The ancients had pr aised God as a symbol of our limitless human potential, but t hat ancient symbol had been lost over time. Until n ow. In that moment, standing atop the Capitol, with the warmth of the sun streaming down all around him, R obert Langdon felt a powerful upwelling deep within himse lf. It was an emotion he had never felt this profou ndly in his entire life. Hope.
