Antimatter is identical to physical matter except thatit is composed of particles whose electric charges are opposite to those foundin normal matter.Antimatter is the most powerful energy source known to man. It releases energywith 100 percent efficiency (nuclear fission is 1.5 percent efficient).Antimatter creates no pollution or radiation, and a droplet could power New YorkCity for a full day.There is, however, one catch…Antimatter is highly unstable. It ignites when it comes in contact withabsolutely anything… even air. A single gram of antimatter contains the energyof a 20-kiloton nuclear bomb-the size of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.Until recently antimatter has been created only in very small amounts (a fewatoms at a time). But CERN has now broken ground on its new AntiprotonDecelerator-an advanced antimatter production facility that promises to createantimatter in much larger quantities.One question looms: Will this highly volatile substance save the world, or willit be used to create the most deadly weapon ever made?AUTHOR’S NOTER eferences to all works of art, tombs, tunnels, and architecture in Rome areentirely factual (as are their exact locations). They can still be seen today.The brotherhood of the Illuminati is also factual.PROLOGUEPhysicist Leonardo Vetra smelled burning flesh, and he knew it was his own. Hestared up in terror at the dark figure looming over him. “What do you want!”“La chiave,” the raspy voice replied. “The password.”“But… I don’t-”The intruder pressed down again, grinding the white hot object deeper intoVetra’s chest. There was the hiss of broiling flesh.Vetra cried out in agony. “There is no password!” He felt himself driftingtoward unconsciousness.The figure glared. “Ne avevo paura. I was afraid of that.”Vetra fought to keep his senses, but the darkness was closing in. His onlysolace was in knowing his attacker would never obtain what he had come for. Amoment later, however, the figure produced a blade and brought it to Vetra’sface. The blade hovered. Carefully. Surgically.“For the love of God!” Vetra screamed. But it was too late."},{"pageContent":"1High atop the steps of the Pyramid of Giza a young woman laughed and called downto him. “Robert, hurry up! I knew I should have married a younger man!” Hersmile was magic.He struggled to keep up, but his legs felt like stone. “Wait,” he begged.“Please…”As he climbed, his vision began to blur. There was a thundering in his ears. Imust reach her! But when he looked up again, the woman had disappeared. In herplace stood an old man with rotting teeth. The man stared down, curling his lipsinto a lonely grimace. Then he let out a scream of anguish that resounded acrossthe desert.Robert Langdon awoke with a start from his nightmare. The phone beside his bedwas ringing. Dazed, he picked up the receiver.“Hello?”“I’m looking for Robert Langdon,” a man’s voice said.Langdon sat up in his empty bed and tried to clear his mind. “This… is RobertLangdon.” He squinted at his digital clock. It was 5:18 A.M.“I must see you immediately.”“Who is this?”“My name is Maximilian Kohler. I’m a discrete particle physicist.”“A what?” Langdon could barely focus. “Are you sure you’ve got the rightLangdon?”“You’re a professor of religious iconology at Harvard University. You’ve writtenthree books on symbology and-”“Do you know what time it is?”“I apologize. I have something you need to see. I can’t discuss it on thephone.”A knowing groan escaped Langdon’s lips. This had happened before. One of theperils of writing books about religious symbology was the calls from religiouszealots who wanted him to confirm their latest sign from God. Last month astripper from Oklahoma had promised Langdon the best sex of his life if he wouldfly down and verify the authenticity of a cruciform that had magically appearedon her bed sheets. The Shroud of Tulsa, Langdon had called it.“How did you get my number?” Langdon tried to be polite, despite the hour.“On the Worldwide Web. The site for your book.”Langdon frowned. He was damn sure his book’s site did not include his home phonenumber. The man was obviously lying.“I need to see you,” the caller insisted. “I’ll pay you well.”Now Langdon was getting mad. “I’m sorry, but I really-”“If you leave immediately, you can be here by-”“I’m not going anywhere! It’s five o’clock in the morning!” Langdon hung up andcollapsed back in bed. He closed his eyes and tried to fall back asleep. It wasno use. The dream was emblazoned in his mind. Reluctantly, he put on his robeand went downstairs.Robert Langdon wandered barefoot through his deserted Massachusetts Victorianhome and nursed his ritual insomnia remedy-a mug of steaming Nestlй‘s Quik. TheApril moon filtered through the bay windows and played on the oriental carpets.Langdon’s colleagues often joked that his place looked more like an anthropologymuseum than a home. His shelves were packed with religious artifacts from aroundthe world-an ekuaba from Ghana, a gold cross from Spain, a cycladic idol fromthe Aegean, and even a rare woven boccus from Borneo, a young warrior’s symbolof perpetual youth.As Langdon sat on his brass Maharishi’s chest and savored the warmth of thechocolate, the bay window caught his reflection. The image was distorted andpale… like a ghost. An aging ghost, he thought, cruelly reminded that hisyouthful spirit was living in a mortal shell.Although not overly handsome in a classical sense, the forty-five-year-oldLangdon had what his female colleagues referred to as an “erudite” appeal-wispsof gray in his thick brown hair, probing blue eyes, an arrestingly deep voice,and the strong, carefree smile of a collegiate athlete. A varsity diver in prepschool and college, Langdon still had the body of a swimmer, a toned, six-footphysique that he vigilantly maintained with fifty laps a day in the universitypool.Langdon’s friends had always viewed him as a bit of an enigma-a man caughtbetween centuries. On weekends he could be seen lounging on the quad in bluejeans, discussing computer graphics or religious history with students; othertimes he could be spotted in his Harris tweed and paisley vest, photographed inthe pages of upscale art magazines at museum openings where he had been asked tolecture.Although a tough teacher and strict disciplinarian, Langdon was the first toembrace what he hailed as the “lost art of good clean fun.” He relishedrecreation with an infectious fanaticism that had earned him a fraternalacceptance among his students. His campus nickname-“The Dolphin”-was a referenceboth to his affable nature and his legendary ability to dive into a pool andoutmaneuver the entire opposing squad in a water polo match.As Langdon sat alone, absently gazing into the darkness, the silence of his homewas shattered again, this time by the ring of his fax machine. Too exhausted tobe annoyed, Langdon forced a tired chuckle.God’s people, he thought. Two thousand years of waiting for their Messiah, andthey’re still persistent as hell.Wearily, he returned his empty mug to the kitchen and walked slowly to hisoak-paneled study. The incoming fax lay in the tray. Sighing, he scooped up thepaper and looked at it.Instantly, a wave of nausea hit him.The image on the page was that of a human corpse. The body had been strippednaked, and its head had been twisted, facing completely backward. On thevictim’s chest was a terrible burn. The man had been branded… imprinted with asingle word. It was a word Langdon knew well. Very well. He stared at the ornatelettering in disbelief.[images/00003.jpg]“Illuminati,” he stammered, his heart pounding. It can’t be…In slow motion, afraid of what he was about to witness, Langdon rotated the fax180 degrees. He looked at the word upside down.Instantly, the breath went out of him. It was like he had been hit by a truck.Barely able to believe his eyes, he rotated the fax again, reading the brandright-side up and then upside down.“Illuminati,” he whispered.Stunned, Langdon collapsed in a chair. He sat a moment in utter bewilderment.Gradually, his eyes were drawn to the blinking red light on his fax machine.Whoever had sent this fax was still on the line… waiting to talk. Langdon gazedat the blinking light a long time.Then, trembling, he picked up the receiver."},{"pageContent":"2Do I have your attention now?“ the man’s voice said when Langdon finallyanswered the line.“Yes, sir, you damn well do. You want to explain yourself?”“I tried to tell you before.” The voice was rigid, mechanical. “I’m a physicist.I run a research facility. We’ve had a murder. You saw the body.”“How did you find me?” Langdon could barely focus. His mind was racing from theimage on the fax.“I already told you. The Worldwide Web. The site for your book, The Art of theIlluminati.”Langdon tried to gather his thoughts. His book was virtually unknown inmainstream literary circles, but it had developed quite a following on-line.Nonetheless, the caller’s claim still made no sense. “That page has no contactinformation,” Langdon challenged. “I’m certain of it.”“I have people here at the lab very adept at extracting user information fromthe Web.”Langdon was skeptical. “Sounds like your lab knows a lot about the Web.”“We should,” the man fired back. “We invented it.”Something in the man’s voice told Langdon he was not joking.“I must see you,” the caller insisted. “This is not a matter we can discuss onthe phone. My lab is only an hour’s flight from Boston.”Langdon stood in the dim light of his study and analyzed the fax in his hand.The image was overpowering, possibly representing the epigraphical find of thecentury, a decade of his research confirmed in a single symbol.“It’s urgent,” the voice pressured.Langdon’s eyes were locked on the brand. Illuminati, he read over and over. Hiswork had always been based on the symbolic equivalent of fossils-ancientdocuments and historical hearsay-but this image before him was today. Presenttense. He felt like a paleontologist coming face to face with a living dinosaur.“I’ve taken the liberty of sending a plane for you,” the voice said. “It will bein Boston in twenty minutes.”Langdon felt his mouth go dry. An hour’s flight…“Please forgive my presumption,” the voice said. “I need you here.”Langdon looked again at the fax-an ancient myth confirmed in black and white.The implications were frightening. He gazed absently through the bay window. Thefirst hint of dawn was sifting through the birch trees in his backyard, but theview looked somehow different this morning. As an odd combination of fear andexhilaration settled over him, Langdon knew he had no choice.“You win,” he said. “Tell me where to meet the plane.”"},{"pageContent":"3Thousands of miles away, two men were meeting. The chamber was dark. Medieval.Stone.“Benvenuto,” the man in charge said. He was seated in the shadows, out of sight.“Were you successful?”“Si,” the dark figure replied. “Perfectamente.” His words were as hard as therock walls.“And there will be no doubt who is responsible?”“None.”“Superb. Do you have what I asked for?”The killer’s eyes glistened, black like oil. He produced a heavy electronicdevice and set it on the table.The man in the shadows seemed pleased. “You have done well.”“Serving the brotherhood is an honor,” the killer said.“Phase two begins shortly. Get some rest. Tonight we change the world.”"},{"pageContent":"4Robert Langdon’s Saab 900S tore out of the Callahan Tunnel and emerged on theeast side of Boston Harbor near the entrance to Logan Airport. Checking hisdirections Langdon found Aviation Road and turned left past the old EasternAirlines Building. Three hundred yards down the access road a hangar loomed inthe darkness. A large number “4”was painted on it. He pulled into the parkinglot and got out of his car.A round-faced man in a blue flight suit emerged from behind the building.“Robert Langdon?” he called. The man’s voice was friendly. He had an accentLangdon couldn’t place.“That’s me,” Langdon said, locking his car.“Perfect timing,” the man said. “I’ve just landed. Follow me, please.”As they circled the building, Langdon felt tense. He was not accustomed tocryptic phone calls and secret rendezvous with strangers. Not knowing what toexpect he had donned his usual classroom attire-a pair of chinos, a turtleneck,and a Harris tweed suit jacket. As they walked, he thought about the fax in hisjacket pocket, still unable to believe the image it depicted.The pilot seemed to sense Langdon’s anxiety. “Flying’s not a problem for you, isit, sir?”“Not at all,” Langdon replied. Branded corpses are a problem for me. Flying Ican handle.The man led Langdon the length of the hangar. They rounded the corner onto therunway.Langdon stopped dead in his tracks and gaped at the aircraft parked on thetarmac. “We’re riding in that?”The man grinned. “Like it?”Langdon stared a long moment. “Like it? What the hell is it?”The craft before them was enormous. It was vaguely reminiscent of the spaceshuttle except that the top had been shaved off, leaving it perfectly flat.Parked there on the runway, it resembled a colossal wedge. Langdon’s firstimpression was that he must be dreaming. The vehicle looked as airworthy as aBuick. The wings were practically nonexistent-just two stubby fins on the rearof the fuselage. A pair of dorsal guiders rose out of the aft section. The restof the plane was hull-about 200 feet from front to back-no windows, nothing buthull.“Two hundred fifty thousand kilos fully fueled,” the pilot offered, like afather bragging about his newborn. “Runs on slush hydrogen. The shell’s atitanium matrix with silicon carbide fibers. She packs a 20:1 thrust/weightratio; most jets run at 7:1. The director must be in one helluva a hurry to seeyou. He doesn’t usually send the big boy.”“This thing flies?” Langdon said.The pilot smiled. “Oh yeah.” He led Langdon across the tarmac toward the plane.“Looks kind of startling, I know, but you better get used to it. In five years,all you’ll see are these babies-HSCT’s-High Speed Civil Transports. Our lab’sone of the first to own one.”Must be one hell of a lab, Langdon thought.“This one’s a prototype of the Boeing X-33,” the pilot continued, “but there aredozens of others-the National Aero Space Plane, the Russians have Scramjet, theBrits have HOTOL. The future’s here, it’s just taking some time to get to thepublic sector. You can kiss conventional jets good-bye.”Langdon looked up warily at the craft. “I think I’d prefer a conventional jet.”The pilot motioned up the gangplank. “This way, please, Mr. Langdon. Watch yourstep.”Minutes later, Langdon was seated inside the empty cabin. The pilot buckled himinto the front row and disappeared toward the front of the aircraft.The cabin itself looked surprisingly like a wide-body commercial airliner. Theonly exception was that it had no windows, which made Langdon uneasy. He hadbeen haunted his whole life by a mild case of claustrophobia-the vestige of achildhood incident he had never quite overcome.Langdon’s aversion to closed spaces was by no means debilitating, but it hadalways frustrated him. It manifested itself in subtle ways. He avoided enclosedsports like racquetball or squash, and he had gladly paid a small fortune forhis airy, high-ceilinged Victorian home even though economical faculty housingwas readily available. Langdon had often suspected his attraction to the artworld as a young boy sprang from his love of museums’ wide open spaces.The engines roared to life beneath him, sending a deep shudder through the hull.Langdon swallowed hard and waited. He felt the plane start taxiing. Piped-incountry music began playing quietly overhead.A phone on the wall beside him beeped twice. Langdon lifted the receiver.“Hello?”“Comfortable, Mr. Langdon?”“Not at all.”“Just relax. We’ll be there in an hour.”“And where exactly is there?” Langdon asked, realizing he had no idea where hewas headed.“Geneva,” the pilot replied, revving the engines. “The lab’s in Geneva.”“Geneva,” Langdon repeated, feeling a little better. “Upstate New York. I’veactually got family near Seneca Lake. I wasn’t aware Geneva had a physics lab.”The pilot laughed. “Not Geneva, New York, Mr. Langdon. Geneva, Switzerland.”The word took a long moment to register. “Switzerland?” Langdon felt his pulsesurge. “I thought you said the lab was only an hour away!”“It is, Mr. Langdon.” The pilot chuckled. “This plane goes Mach fifteen.”"},{"pageContent":"5On a busy European street, the killer serpentined through a crowd. He was apowerful man. Dark and potent. Deceptively agile. His muscles still felt hardfrom the thrill of his meeting.It went well, he told himself. Although his employer had never revealed hisface, the killer felt honored to be in his presence. Had it really been onlyfifteen days since his employer had first made contact? The killer stillremembered every word of that call…“My name is Janus,” the caller had said. “We are kinsmen of a sort. We share anenemy. I hear your skills are for hire.”“It depends whom you represent,” the killer replied.The caller told him.“Is this your idea of a joke?”“You have heard our name, I see,” the caller replied.“Of course. The brotherhood is legendary.”“And yet you find yourself doubting I am genuine.”“Everyone knows the brothers have faded to dust.”“A devious ploy. The most dangerous enemy is that which no one fears.”The killer was skeptical. “The brotherhood endures?”“Deeper underground than ever before. Our roots infiltrate everything you see…even the sacred fortress of our most sworn enemy.”“Impossible. They are invulnerable.”“Our reach is far.”“No one’s reach is that far.”“Very soon, you will believe. An irrefutable demonstration of the brotherhood’spower has already transpired. A single act of treachery and proof.”“What have you done?”The caller told him.The killer’s eyes went wide. “An impossible task.”The next day, newspapers around the globe carried the same headline. The killerbecame a believer.Now, fifteen days later, the killer’s faith had solidified beyond the shadow ofa doubt. The brotherhood endures, he thought. Tonight they will surface toreveal their power.As he made his way through the streets, his black eyes gleamed with foreboding.One of the most covert and feared fraternities ever to walk the earth had calledon him for service. They have chosen wisely, he thought. His reputation forsecrecy was exceeded only by that of his deadliness.So far, he had served them nobly. He had made his kill and delivered the item toJanus as requested. Now, it was up to Janus to use his power to ensure theitem’s placement.The placement…The killer wondered how Janus could possibly handle such a staggering task. Theman obviously had connections on the inside. The brotherhood’s dominion seemedlimitless.Janus, the killer thought. A code name, obviously. Was it a reference, hewondered, to the Roman two-faced god… or to the moon of Saturn? Not that it madeany difference. Janus wielded unfathomable power. He had proven that beyond adoubt.As the killer walked, he imagined his ancestors smiling down on him. Today hewas fighting their battle, he was fighting the same enemy they had fought forages, as far back as the eleventh century… when the enemy’s crusading armies hadfirst pillaged his land, raping and killing his people, declaring them unclean,defiling their temples and gods.His ancestors had formed a small but deadly army to defend themselves. The armybecame famous across the land as protectors-skilled executioners who wanderedthe countryside slaughtering any of the enemy they could find. They wererenowned not only for their brutal killings, but also for celebrating theirslayings by plunging themselves into drug-induced stupors. Their drug of choicewas a potent intoxicant they called hashish.As their notoriety spread, these lethal men became known by a singleword-Hassassin-literally “the followers of hashish.” The name Hassassin becamesynonymous with death in almost every language on earth. The word was still usedtoday, even in modern English… but like the craft of killing, the word hadevolved.It was now pronounced assassin."},{"pageContent":"6Sixty-four minutes had passed when an incredulous and slightly air-sick RobertLangdon stepped down the gangplank onto the sun-drenched runway. A crisp breezerustled the lapels of his tweed jacket. The open space felt wonderful. Hesquinted out at the lush green valley rising to snowcapped peaks all aroundthem.I’m dreaming, he told himself. Any minute now I’ll be waking up.“Welcome to Switzerland,” the pilot said, yelling over the roar of the X-33’smisted-fuel HEDM engines winding down behind them.Langdon checked his watch. It read 7:07 A.M.“You just crossed six time zones,” the pilot offered. “It’s a little past 1 P.M.here.”Langdon reset his watch.“How do you feel?”He rubbed his stomach. “Like I’ve been eating Styrofoam.”The pilot nodded. “Altitude sickness. We were at sixty thousand feet. You’rethirty percent lighter up there. Lucky we only did a puddle jump. If we’d goneto Tokyo I’d have taken her all the way up-a hundred miles. Now that’ll get yourinsides rolling.”Langdon gave a wan nod and counted himself lucky. All things considered, theflight had been remarkably ordinary. Aside from a bone-crushing accelerationduring take off, the plane’s motion had been fairly typical-occasional minorturbulence, a few pressure changes as they’d climbed, but nothing at all tosuggest they had been hurtling through space at the mind-numbing speed of 11,000miles per hour.A handful of technicians scurried onto the runway to tend to the X-33. The pilotescorted Langdon to a black Peugeot sedan in a parking area beside the controltower. Moments later they were speeding down a paved road that stretched outacross the valley floor. A faint cluster of buildings rose in the distance.Outside, the grassy plains tore by in a blur.Langdon watched in disbelief as the pilot pushed the speedometer up around 170kilometers an hour-over 100 miles per hour. What is it with this guy and speed?he wondered.“Five kilometers to the lab,” the pilot said. “I’ll have you there in twominutes.”Langdon searched in vain for a seat belt. Why not make it three and get us therealive?The car raced on.“Do you like Reba?” the pilot asked, jamming a cassette into the tape deck.A woman started singing. “It’s just the fear of being alone… ”No fear here, Langdon thought absently. His female colleagues often ribbed himthat his collection of museum-quality artifacts was nothing more than atransparent attempt to fill an empty home, a home they insisted would benefitgreatly from the presence of a woman. Langdon always laughed it off, remindingthem he already had three loves in his life-symbology, water polo, andbachelorhood-the latter being a freedom that enabled him to travel the world,sleep as late as he wanted, and enjoy quiet nights at home with a brandy and agood book.“We’re like a small city,” the pilot said, pulling Langdon from his daydream.“Not just labs. We’ve got supermarkets, a hospital, even a cinema.”Langdon nodded blankly and looked out at the sprawling expanse of buildingsrising before them.“In fact,” the pilot added, “we possess the largest machine on earth.”“Really?” Langdon scanned the countryside.“You won’t see it out there, sir.” The pilot smiled. “It’s buried six storiesbelow the earth.”Langdon didn’t have time to ask. Without warning the pilot jammed on the brakes.The car skidded to a stop outside a reinforced sentry booth.Langdon read the sign before them. SECURITE. ARRETEZ. He suddenly felt a wave ofpanic, realizing where he was. “My God! I didn’t bring my passport!”“Passports are unnecessary,” the driver assured. “We have a standing arrangementwith the Swiss government.”Langdon watched dumbfounded as his driver gave the guard an ID. The sentry ranit through an electronic authentication device. The machine flashed green.“Passenger name?”“Robert Langdon,” the driver replied.“Guest of?”“The director.”The sentry arched his eyebrows. He turned and checked a computer printout,verifying it against the data on his computer screen. Then he returned to thewindow. “Enjoy your stay, Mr. Langdon.”The car shot off again, accelerating another 200 yards around a sweeping rotarythat led to the facility’s main entrance. Looming before them was a rectangular,ultramodern structure of glass and steel. Langdon was amazed by the building’sstriking transparent design. He had always had a fond love of architecture.“The Glass Cathedral,” the escort offered.“A church?”“Hell, no. A church is the one thing we don’t have. Physics is the religionaround here. Use the Lord’s name in vain all you like,” he laughed, “just don’tslander any quarks or mesons.”Langdon sat bewildered as the driver swung the car around and brought it to astop in front of the glass building. Quarks and mesons? No border control? Mach15 jets? Who the hell ARE these guys? The engraved granite slab in front of thebuilding bore the answer:(CERN) Conseil Europйen pour la Recherche Nuclйaire“Nuclear Research?” Langdon asked, fairly certain his translation was correct.The driver did not answer. He was leaning forward, busily adjusting the car’scassette player. “This is your stop. The director will meet you at thisentrance.”Langdon noted a man in a wheelchair exiting the building. He looked to be in hisearly sixties. Gaunt and totally bald with a sternly set jaw, he wore a whitelab coat and dress shoes propped firmly on the wheelchair’s footrest. Even at adistance his eyes looked lifeless-like two gray stones.“Is that him?” Langdon asked.The driver looked up. “Well, I’ll be.” He turned and gave Langdon an ominoussmile. “Speak of the devil.”Uncertain what to expect, Langdon stepped from the vehicle.The man in the wheelchair accelerated toward Langdon and offered a clammy hand.“Mr. Langdon? We spoke on the phone. My name is Maximilian Kohler.”"},{"pageContent":"7Maximilian Kohler, director general of CERN, was known behind his back asKцnig-King. It was a title more of fear than reverence for the figure who ruledover his dominion from a wheelchair throne. Although few knew him personally,the horrific story of how he had been crippled was lore at CERN, and there werefew there who blamed him for his bitterness… nor for his sworn dedication topure science.Langdon had only been in Kohler’s presence a few moments and already sensed thedirector was a man who kept his distance. Langdon found himself practicallyjogging to keep up with Kohler’s electric wheelchair as it sped silently towardthe main entrance. The wheelchair was like none Langdon had ever seen-equippedwith a bank of electronics including a multiline phone, a paging system,computer screen, even a small, detachable video camera. King Kohler’s mobilecommand center.Langdon followed through a mechanical door into CERN’s voluminous main lobby.The Glass Cathedral, Langdon mused, gazing upward toward heaven.Overhead, the bluish glass roof shimmered in the afternoon sun, casting rays ofgeometric patterns in the air and giving the room a sense of grandeur. Angularshadows fell like veins across the white tiled walls and down to the marblefloors. The air smelled clean, sterile. A handful of scientists moved brisklyabout, their footsteps echoing in the resonant space.“This way, please, Mr. Langdon.” His voice sounded almost computerized. Hisaccent was rigid and precise, like his stern features. Kohler coughed and wipedhis mouth on a white handkerchief as he fixed his dead gray eyes on Langdon.“Please hurry.” His wheelchair seemed to leap across the tiled floor.Langdon followed past what seemed to be countless hallways branching off themain atrium. Every hallway was alive with activity. The scientists who sawKohler seemed to stare in surprise, eyeing Langdon as if wondering who he mustbe to command such company.“I’m embarrassed to admit,” Langdon ventured, trying to make conversation, “thatI’ve never heard of CERN.”“Not surprising,” Kohler replied, his clipped response sounding harshlyefficient. “Most Americans do not see Europe as the world leader in scientificresearch. They see us as nothing but a quaint shopping district-an oddperception if you consider the nationalities of men like Einstein, Galileo, andNewton.”Langdon was unsure how to respond. He pulled the fax from his pocket. “This manin the photograph, can you-”Kohler cut him off with a wave of his hand. “Please. Not here. I am taking youto him now.” He held out his hand. “Perhaps I should take that.”Langdon handed over the fax and fell silently into step.Kohler took a sharp left and entered a wide hallway adorned with awards andcommendations. A particularly large plaque dominated the entry. Langdon slowedto read the engraved bronze as they passed.ARS ELECTRONICA AWARDFor Cultural Innovation in the Digital Age Awarded to Tim Berners Lee and CERNfor the invention of the WORLDWIDE WEBWell I’ll be damned, Langdon thought, reading the text. This guy wasn’t kidding.Langdon had always thought of the Web as an American invention. Then again, hisknowledge was limited to the site for his own book and the occasional on-lineexploration of the Louvre or El Prado on his old Macintosh.“The Web,” Kohler said, coughing again and wiping his mouth, “began here as anetwork of in-house computer sites. It enabled scientists from differentdepartments to share daily findings with one another. Of course, the entireworld is under the impression the Web is U.S. technology.”Langdon followed down the hall. “Why not set the record straight?”Kohler shrugged, apparently disinterested. “A petty misconception over a pettytechnology. CERN is far greater than a global connection of computers. Ourscientists produce miracles almost daily.”Langdon gave Kohler a questioning look. “Miracles?” The word “miracle” wascertainly not part of the vocabulary around Harvard’s Fairchild ScienceBuilding. Miracles were left for the School of Divinity.“You sound skeptical,” Kohler said. “I thought you were a religious symbologist.Do you not believe in miracles?”“I’m undecided on miracles,” Langdon said. Particularly those that take place inscience labs.“Perhaps miracle is the wrong word. I was simply trying to speak your language.”“My language?” Langdon was suddenly uncomfortable. “Not to disappoint you, sir,but I study religious symbology-I’m an academic, not a priest.”Kohler slowed suddenly and turned, his gaze softening a bit. “Of course. Howsimple of me. One does not need to have cancer to analyze its symptoms.”Langdon had never heard it put quite that way.As they moved down the hallway, Kohler gave an accepting nod. “I suspect you andI will understand each other perfectly, Mr. Langdon.”Somehow Langdon doubted it.As the pair hurried on, Langdon began to sense a deep rumbling up ahead. Thenoise got more and more pronounced with every step, reverberating through thewalls. It seemed to be coming from the end of the hallway in front of them.“What’s that?” Langdon finally asked, having to yell. He felt like they wereapproaching an active volcano.“Free Fall Tube,” Kohler replied, his hollow voice cutting the air effortlessly.He offered no other explanation.Langdon didn’t ask. He was exhausted, and Maximilian Kohler seemed disinterestedin winning any hospitality awards. Langdon reminded himself why he was here.Illuminati. He assumed somewhere in this colossal facility was a body… a bodybranded with a symbol he had just flown 3,000 miles to see.As they approached the end of the hall, the rumble became almost deafening,vibrating up through Langdon’s soles. They rounded the bend, and a viewinggallery appeared on the right. Four thick-paned portals were embedded in acurved wall, like windows in a submarine. Langdon stopped and looked through oneof the holes.Professor Robert Langdon had seen some strange things in his life, but this wasthe strangest. He blinked a few times, wondering if he was hallucinating. He wasstaring into an enormous circular chamber. Inside the chamber, floating asthough weightless, were people. Three of them. One waved and did a somersault inmidair.My God, he thought. I’m in the land of Oz.The floor of the room was a mesh grid, like a giant sheet of chicken wire.Visible beneath the grid was the metallic blur of a huge propeller.“Free fall tube,” Kohler said, stopping to wait for him. “Indoor skydiving. Forstress relief. It’s a vertical wind tunnel.”Langdon looked on in amazement. One of the free fallers, an obese woman,maneuvered toward the window. She was being buffeted by the air currents butgrinned and flashed Langdon the thumbs-up sign. Langdon smiled weakly andreturned the gesture, wondering if she knew it was the ancient phallic symbolfor masculine virility.The heavyset woman, Langdon noticed, was the only one wearing what appeared tobe a miniature parachute. The swathe of fabric billowed over her like a toy.“What’s her little chute for?” Langdon asked Kohler. “It can’t be more than ayard in diameter.”“Friction,” Kohler said. “Decreases her aerodynamics so the fan can lift her.”He started down the corridor again. “One square yard of drag will slow a fallingbody almost twenty percent.”Langdon nodded blankly.He never suspected that later that night, in a country hundreds of miles away,the information would save his life."},{"pageContent":"8When Kohler and Langdon emerged from the rear of CERN’s main complex into thestark Swiss sunlight, Langdon felt as if he’d been transported home. The scenebefore him looked like an Ivy League campus.A grassy slope cascaded downward onto an expansive lowlands where clusters ofsugar maples dotted quadrangles bordered by brick dormitories and footpaths.Scholarly looking individuals with stacks of books hustled in and out ofbuildings. As if to accentuate the collegiate atmosphere, two longhaired hippieshurled a Frisbee back and forth while enjoying Mahler’s Fourth Symphony blaringfrom a dorm window.“These are our residential dorms,” Kohler explained as he accelerated hiswheelchair down the path toward the buildings. “We have over three thousandphysicists here. CERN single-handedly employs more than half of the world’sparticle physicists-the brightest minds on earth-Germans, Japanese, Italians,Dutch, you name it. Our physicists represent over five hundred universities andsixty nationalities.”Langdon was amazed. “How do they all communicate?”“English, of course. The universal language of science.”Langdon had always heard math was the universal language of science, but he wastoo tired to argue. He dutifully followed Kohler down the path.Halfway to the bottom, a young man jogged by. His T-shirt proclaimed themessage: NO GUT, NO GLORY!Langdon looked after him, mystified. “Gut?”“General Unified Theory.” Kohler quipped. “The theory of everything.”“I see,” Langdon said, not seeing at all.“Are you familiar with particle physics, Mr. Langdon?”Langdon shrugged. “I’m familiar with general physics-falling bodies, that sortof thing.” His years of high-diving experience had given him a profound respectfor the awesome power of gravitational acceleration. “Particle physics is thestudy of atoms, isn’t it?”Kohler shook his head. “Atoms look like planets compared to what we deal with.Our interests lie with an atom’s nucleus-a mere ten-thousandth the size of thewhole.” He coughed again, sounding sick. “The men and women of CERN are here tofind answers to the same questions man has been asking since the beginning oftime. Where did we come from? What are we made of?”“And these answers are in a physics lab?”“You sound surprised.”“I am. The questions seem spiritual.”“Mr. Langdon, all questions were once spiritual. Since the beginning of time,spirituality and religion have been called on to fill in the gaps that sciencedid not understand. The rising and setting of the sun was once attributed toHelios and a flaming chariot. Earthquakes and tidal waves were the wrath ofPoseidon. Science has now proven those gods to be false idols. Soon all Godswill be proven to be false idols. Science has now provided answers to almostevery question man can ask. There are only a few questions left, and they arethe esoteric ones. Where do we come from? What are we doing here? What is themeaning of life and the universe?”Langdon was amazed. “And these are questions CERN is trying to answer?”“Correction. These are questions we are answering.”Langdon fell silent as the two men wound through the residential quadrangles. Asthey walked, a Frisbee sailed overhead and skidded to a stop directly in frontof them. Kohler ignored it and kept going.A voice called out from across the quad. “S’il vous plaоt!”Langdon looked over. An elderly white-haired man in a COLLEGE PARIS sweatshirtwaved to him. Langdon picked up the Frisbee and expertly threw it back. The oldman caught it on one finger and bounced it a few times before whipping it overhis shoulder to his partner. “Merci!” he called to Langdon.“Congratulations,” Kohler said when Langdon finally caught up. “You just playedtoss with a Noble prize-winner, Georges Charpak, inventor of the multiwireproportional chamber.”Langdon nodded. My lucky day.It took Langdon and Kohler three more minutes to reach their destination-alarge, well-kept dormitory sitting in a grove of aspens. Compared to the otherdorms, this structure seemed luxurious. The carved stone sign in front readBUILDING C.Imaginative title, Langdon thought.But despite its sterile name, Building C appealed to Langdon’s sense ofarchitectural style-conservative and solid. It had a red brick facade, an ornatebalustrade, and sat framed by sculpted symmetrical hedges. As the two menascended the stone path toward the entry, they passed under a gateway formed bya pair of marble columns. Someone had put a sticky-note on one of them.THIS COLUMN IS IONICPhysicist graffiti? Langdon mused, eyeing the column and chuckling to himself.“I’m relieved to see that even brilliant physicists make mistakes.”Kohler looked over. “What do you mean?”“Whoever wrote that note made a mistake. That column isn’t Ionic. Ionic columnsare uniform in width. That one’s tapered. It’s Doric-the Greek counterpart. Acommon mistake.”Kohler did not smile. “The author meant it as a joke, Mr. Langdon. Ionic meanscontaining ions-electrically charged particles. Most objects contain them.”Langdon looked back at the column and groaned.Langdon was still feeling stupid when he stepped from the elevator on the topfloor of Building C. He followed Kohler down a well-appointed corridor. Thedecor was unexpected-traditional colonial French-a cherry divan, porcelain floorvase, and scrolled woodwork.“We like to keep our tenured scientists comfortable,” Kohler explained.Evidently, Langdon thought. “So the man in the fax lived up here? One of yourupper-level employees?”“Quite,” Kohler said. “He missed a meeting with me this morning and did notanswer his page. I came up here to locate him and found him dead in his livingroom.”Langdon felt a sudden chill realizing that he was about to see a dead body. Hisstomach had never been particularly stalwart. It was a weakness he’d discoveredas an art student when the teacher informed the class that Leonardo da Vinci hadgained his expertise in the human form by exhuming corpses and dissecting theirmusculature.Kohler led the way to the far end of the hallway. There was a single door. “ThePenthouse, as you would say,” Kohler announced, dabbing a bead of perspirationfrom his forehead.Langdon eyed the lone oak door before them. The name plate read:LEONARDO VETRA“Leonardo Vetra,” Kohler said, “would have been fifty-eight next week. He wasone of the most brilliant scientists of our time. His death is a profound lossfor science.”For an instant Langdon thought he sensed emotion in Kohler’s hardened face. Butas quickly as it had come, it was gone. Kohler reached in his pocket and begansifting through a large key ring.An odd thought suddenly occurred to Langdon. The building seemed deserted.“Where is everyone?” he asked. The lack of activity was hardly what he expectedconsidering they were about to enter a murder scene.“The residents are in their labs,” Kohler replied, finding the key.“I mean the police,” Langdon clarified. “Have they left already?”Kohler paused, his key halfway into the lock. “Police?”Langdon’s eyes met the director’s. “Police. You sent me a fax of a homicide. Youmust have called the police.”“I most certainly have not.”“What?”Kohler’s gray eyes sharpened. “The situation is complex, Mr. Langdon.”Langdon felt a wave of apprehension. “But… certainly someone else knows aboutthis!”“Yes. Leonardo’s adopted daughter. She is also a physicist here at CERN. She andher father share a lab. They are partners. Ms. Vetra has been away this weekdoing field research. I have notified her of her father’s death, and she isreturning as we speak.”“But a man has been murd-”“A formal investigation,” Kohler said, his voice firm, “will take place.However, it will most certainly involve a search of Vetra’s lab, a space he andhis daughter hold most private. Therefore, it will wait until Ms. Vetra hasarrived. I feel I owe her at least that modicum of discretion.”Kohler turned the key.As the door swung open, a blast of icy air hissed into the hall and hit Langdonin the face. He fell back in bewilderment. He was gazing across the threshold ofan alien world. The flat before him was immersed in a thick, white fog. The mistswirled in smoky vortexes around the furniture and shrouded the room in opaquehaze.“What the… ?” Langdon stammered.“Freon cooling system,” Kohler replied. “I chilled the flat to preserve thebody.”Langdon buttoned his tweed jacket against the cold. I’m in Oz, he thought. And Iforgot my magic slippers."},{"pageContent":"9The corpse on the floor before Langdon was hideous. The late Leonardo Vetra layon his back, stripped naked, his skin bluish-gray. His neck bones were juttingout where they had been broken, and his head was twisted completely backward,pointing the wrong way. His face was out of view, pressed against the floor. Theman lay in a frozen puddle of his own urine, the hair around his shriveledgenitals spidered with frost.Fighting a wave of nausea, Langdon let his eyes fall to the victim’s chest.Although Langdon had stared at the symmetrical wound a dozen times on the fax,the burn was infinitely more commanding in real life. The raised, broiled fleshwas perfectly delineated… the symbol flawlessly formed.Langdon wondered if the intense chill now raking through his body was theair-conditioning or his utter amazement with the significance of what he was nowstaring at.[images/00009.jpg]His heart pounded as he circled the body, reading the word upside down,reaffirming the genius of the symmetry. The symbol seemed even less conceivablenow that he was staring at it.“Mr. Langdon?”Langdon did not hear. He was in another world… his world, his element, a worldwhere history, myth, and fact collided, flooding his senses. The gears turned.“Mr. Langdon?” Kohler’s eyes probed expectantly.Langdon did not look up. His disposition now intensified, his focus total. “Howmuch do you already know?”“Only what I had time to read on your website. The word Illuminati means ‘theenlightened ones.’ It is the name of some sort of ancient brotherhood.”Langdon nodded. “Had you heard the name before?”“Not until I saw it branded on Mr. Vetra.”“So you ran a web search for it?”“Yes.”“And the word returned hundreds of references, no doubt.”“Thousands,” Kohler said. “Yours, however, contained references to Harvard,Oxford, a reputable publisher, as well as a list of related publications. As ascientist I have come to learn that information is only as valuable as itssource. Your credentials seemed authentic.”Langdon’s eyes were still riveted on the body.Kohler said nothing more. He simply stared, apparently waiting for Langdon toshed some light on the scene before them.Langdon looked up, glancing around the frozen flat. “Perhaps we should discussthis in a warmer place?”“This room is fine.” Kohler seemed oblivious to the cold. “We’ll talk here.”Langdon frowned. The Illuminati history was by no means a simple one. I’llfreeze to death trying to explain it. He gazed again at the brand, feeling arenewed sense of awe.Although accounts of the Illuminati emblem were legendary in modern symbology,no academic had ever actually seen it. Ancient documents described the symbol asan ambigram-ambi meaning “both”-signifying it was legible both ways. Andalthough ambigrams were common in symbology-swastikas, yin yang, Jewish stars,simple crosses-the idea that a word could be crafted into an ambigram seemedutterly impossible. Modern symbologists had tried for years to forge the word“Illuminati” into a perfectly symmetrical style, but they had failed miserably.Most academics had now decided the symbol’s existence was a myth.“So who are the Illuminati?” Kohler demanded.Yes, Langdon thought, who indeed? He began his tale.“Since the beginning of history,” Langdon explained, “a deep rift has existedbetween science and religion. Outspoken scientists like Copernicus-”“Were murdered,” Kohler interjected. “Murdered by the church for revealingscientific truths. Religion has always persecuted science.”“Yes. But in the 1500s, a group of men in Rome fought back against the church.Some of Italy’s most enlightened men-physicists, mathematicians,astronomers-began meeting secretly to share their concerns about the church’sinaccurate teachings. They feared that the church’s monopoly on ‘truth’threatened academic enlightenment around the world. They founded the world’sfirst scientific think tank, calling themselves ‘the enlightened ones.’ ”“The Illuminati.”“Yes,” Langdon said. “Europe’s most learned minds… dedicated to the quest forscientific truth.”Kohler fell silent.“Of course, the Illuminati were hunted ruthlessly by the Catholic Church. Onlythrough rites of extreme secrecy did the scientists remain safe. Word spreadthrough the academic underground, and the Illuminati brotherhood grew to includeacademics from all over Europe. The scientists met regularly in Rome at anultrasecret lair they called the Church of Illumination.”Kohler coughed and shifted in his chair.“Many of the Illuminati,” Langdon continued, “wanted to combat the church’styranny with acts of violence, but their most revered member persuaded themagainst it. He was a pacifist, as well as one of history’s most famousscientists.”Langdon was certain Kohler would recognize the name. Even nonscientists werefamiliar with the ill-fated astronomer who had been arrested and almost executedby the church for proclaiming that the sun, and not the earth, was the center ofthe solar system. Although his data were incontrovertible, the astronomer wasseverely punished for implying that God had placed mankind somewhere other thanat the center of His universe.“His name was Galileo Galilei,” Langdon said.Kohler looked up. “Galileo?”“Yes. Galileo was an Illuminatus. And he was also a devout Catholic. He tried tosoften the church’s position on science by proclaiming that science did notundermine the existence of God, but rather reinforced it. He wrote once thatwhen he looked through his telescope at the spinning planets, he could hearGod’s voice in the music of the spheres. He held that science and religion werenot enemies, but rather allies-two different languages telling the same story, astory of symmetry and balance… heaven and hell, night and day, hot and cold, Godand Satan. Both science and religion rejoiced in God’s symmetry… the endlesscontest of light and dark.” Langdon paused, stamping his feet to stay warm.Kohler simply sat in his wheelchair and stared.“Unfortunately,” Langdon added, “the unification of science and religion was notwhat the church wanted.”“Of course not,” Kohler interrupted. “The union would have nullified thechurch’s claim as the sole vessel through which man could understand God. So thechurch tried Galileo as a heretic, found him guilty, and put him under permanenthouse arrest. I am quite aware of scientific history, Mr. Langdon. But this wasall centuries ago. What does it have to do with Leonardo Vetra?”The million dollar question. Langdon cut to the chase. “Galileo’s arrest threwthe Illuminati into upheaval. Mistakes were made, and the church discovered theidentities of four members, whom they captured and interrogated. But the fourscientists revealed nothing… even under torture.”“Torture?”Langdon nodded. “They were branded alive. On the chest. With the symbol of across.”Kohler’s eyes widened, and he shot an uneasy glance at Vetra’s body.“Then the scientists were brutally murdered, their dead bodies dropped in thestreets of Rome as a warning to others thinking of joining the Illuminati. Withthe church closing in, the remaining Illuminati fled Italy.”Langdon paused to make his point. He looked directly into Kohler’s dead eyes.“The Illuminati went deep underground, where they began mixing with otherrefugee groups fleeing the Catholic purges-mystics, alchemists, occultists,Muslims, Jews. Over the years, the Illuminati began absorbing new members. A newIlluminati emerged. A darker Illuminati. A deeply anti-Christian Illuminati.They grew very powerful, employing mysterious rites, deadly secrecy, vowingsomeday to rise again and take revenge on the Catholic Church. Their power grewto the point where the church considered them the single most dangerousanti-Christian force on earth. The Vatican denounced the brotherhood asShaitan.”“Shaitan?”“It’s Islamic. It means ‘adversary’… God’s adversary. The church chose Islam forthe name because it was a language they considered dirty.” Langdon hesitated.“Shaitan is the root of an English word…Satan.”An uneasiness crossed Kohler’s face.Langdon’s voice was grim. “Mr. Kohler, I do not know how this marking appearedon this man’s chest… or why… but you are looking at the long-lost symbol of theworld’s oldest and most powerful satanic cult.”"},{"pageContent":"10The alley was narrow and deserted. The Hassassin strode quickly now, his blackeyes filling with anticipation. As he approached his destination, Janus’sparting words echoed in his mind. Phase two begins shortly. Get some rest.The Hassassin smirked. He had been awake all night, but sleep was the last thingon his mind. Sleep was for the weak. He was a warrior like his ancestors beforehim, and his people never slept once a battle had begun. This battle had mostdefinitely begun, and he had been given the honor of spilling first blood. Nowhe had two hours to celebrate his glory before going back to work.Sleep? There are far better ways to relax…An appetite for hedonistic pleasure was something bred into him by hisancestors. His ascendants had indulged in hashish, but he preferred a differentkind of gratification. He took pride in his body-a well-tuned, lethal machine,which, despite his heritage, he refused to pollute with narcotics. He haddeveloped a more nourishing addiction than drugs… a far more healthy andsatisfying reward.Feeling a familiar anticipation swelling within him, the Hassassin moved fasterdown the alley. He arrived at the nondescript door and rang the bell. A viewslit in the door opened, and two soft brown eyes studied him appraisingly. Thenthe door swung open.“Welcome,” the well-dressed woman said. She ushered him into an impeccablyfurnished sitting room where the lights were low. The air was laced withexpensive perfume and musk. “Whenever you are ready.” She handed him a book ofphotographs. “Ring me when you have made your choice.” Then she disappeared.The Hassassin smiled.As he sat on the plush divan and positioned the photo album on his lap, he felta carnal hunger stir. Although his people did not celebrate Christmas, heimagined that this is what it must feel like to be a Christian child, sittingbefore a stack of Christmas presents, about to discover the miracles inside. Heopened the album and examined the photos. A lifetime of sexual fantasies staredback at him.Marisa. An Italian goddess. Fiery. A young Sophia Loren.Sachiko. A Japanese geisha. Lithe. No doubt skilled.Kanara. A stunning black vision. Muscular. Exotic.He examined the entire album twice and made his choice. He pressed a button onthe table beside him. A minute later the woman who had greeted him reappeared.He indicated his selection. She smiled. “Follow me.”After handling the financial arrangements, the woman made a hushed phone call.She waited a few minutes and then led him up a winding marble staircase to aluxurious hallway. “It’s the gold door on the end,” she said. “You haveexpensive taste.”I should, he thought. I am a connoisseur.The Hassassin padded the length of the hallway like a panther anticipating along overdue meal. When he reached the doorway he smiled to himself. It wasalready ajar… welcoming him in. He pushed, and the door swung noiselessly open.When he saw his selection, he knew he had chosen well. She was exactly as he hadrequested… nude, lying on her back, her arms tied to the bedposts with thickvelvet cords.He crossed the room and ran a dark finger across her ivory abdomen. I killedlast night, he thought. You are my reward."},{"pageContent":"11Satanic?“ Kohler wiped his mouth and shifted uncomfortably. ”This is the symbolof a satanic cult?“Langdon paced the frozen room to keep warm. “The Illuminati were satanic. Butnot in the modern sense.”Langdon quickly explained how most people pictured satanic cults asdevil-worshiping fiends, and yet Satanists historically were educated men whostood as adversaries to the church. Shaitan. The rumors of satanic black-magicanimal sacrifices and the pentagram ritual were nothing but lies spread by thechurch as a smear campaign against their adversaries. Over time, opponents ofthe church, wanting to emulate the Illuminati, began believing the lies andacting them out. Thus, modern Satanism was born.Kohler grunted abruptly. “This is all ancient history. I want to know how thissymbol got here.”Langdon took a deep breath. “The symbol itself was created by an anonymoussixteenth-century Illuminati artist as a tribute to Galileo’s love of symmetry-akind of sacred Illuminati logo. The brotherhood kept the design secret,allegedly planning to reveal it only when they had amassed enough power toresurface and carry out their final goal.”Kohler looked unsettled. “So this symbol means the Illuminati brotherhood isresurfacing?”Langdon frowned. “That would be impossible. There is one chapter of Illuminatihistory that I have not yet explained.”Kohler’s voice intensified. “Enlighten me.”Langdon rubbed his palms together, mentally sorting through the hundreds ofdocuments he’d read or written on the Illuminati. “The Illuminati weresurvivors,” he explained. “When they fled Rome, they traveled across Europelooking for a safe place to regroup. They were taken in by another secretsociety… a brotherhood of wealthy Bavarian stone craftsmen called theFreemasons.”Kohler looked startled. “The Masons?”Langdon nodded, not at all surprised that Kohler had heard of the group. Thebrotherhood of the Masons currently had over five million members worldwide,half of them residing in the United States, and over one million of them inEurope.“Certainly the Masons are not satanic,” Kohler declared, sounding suddenlyskeptical.“Absolutely not. The Masons fell victim of their own benevolence. Afterharboring the fleeing scientists in the 1700s, the Masons unknowingly became afront for the Illuminati. The Illuminati grew within their ranks, graduallytaking over positions of power within the lodges. They quietly reestablishedtheir scientific brotherhood deep within the Masons-a kind of secret societywithin a secret society. Then the Illuminati used the worldwide connection ofMasonic lodges to spread their influence.”Langdon drew a cold breath before racing on. “Obliteration of Catholicism wasthe Illuminati’s central covenant. The brotherhood held that the superstitiousdogma spewed forth by the church was mankind’s greatest enemy. They feared thatif religion continued to promote pious myth as absolute fact, scientificprogress would halt, and mankind would be doomed to an ignorant future ofsenseless holy wars.”“Much like we see today.”Langdon frowned. Kohler was right. Holy wars were still making headlines. My Godis better than your God. It seemed there was always close correlation betweentrue believers and high body counts.“Go on,” Kohler said.Langdon gathered his thoughts and continued. “The Illuminati grew more powerfulin Europe and set their sights on America, a fledgling government many of whoseleaders were Masons-George Washington, Ben Franklin-honest, God-fearing men whowere unaware of the Illuminati stronghold on the Masons. The Illuminati tookadvantage of the infiltration and helped found banks, universities, and industryto finance their ultimate quest.” Langdon paused. “The creation of a singleunified world state-a kind of secular New World Order.”Kohler did not move.“A New World Order,” Langdon repeated, “based on scientific enlightenment. Theycalled it their Luciferian Doctrine. The church claimed Lucifer was a referenceto the devil, but the brotherhood insisted Lucifer was intended in its literalLatin meaning-bringer of light. Or Illuminator.”Kohler sighed, and his voice grew suddenly solemn. “Mr. Langdon, please sitdown.”Langdon sat tentatively on a frost-covered chair.Kohler moved his wheelchair closer. “I am not sure I understand everything youhave just told me, but I do understand this. Leonardo Vetra was one of CERN’sgreatest assets. He was also a friend. I need you to help me locate theIlluminati.”Langdon didn’t know how to respond. “Locate the Illuminati?” He’s kidding,right? “I’m afraid, sir, that will be utterly impossible.”Kohler’s brow creased. “What do you mean? You won’t-”“Mr. Kohler.” Langdon leaned toward his host, uncertain how to make himunderstand what he was about to say. “I did not finish my story. Despiteappearances, it is extremely unlikely that this brand was put here by theIlluminati. There has been no evidence of their existence for over half acentury, and most scholars agree the Illuminati have been defunct for manyyears.”The words hit silence. Kohler stared through the fog with a look somewherebetween stupefaction and anger. “How the hell can you tell me this group isextinct when their name is seared into this man!”Langdon had been asking himself that question all morning. The appearance of theIlluminati ambigram was astonishing. Symbologists worldwide would be dazzled.And yet, the academic in Langdon understood that the brand’s reemergence provedabsolutely nothing about the Illuminati.“Symbols,” Langdon said, “in no way confirm the presence of their originalcreators.”“What is that supposed to mean?”“It means that when organized philosophies like the Illuminati go out ofexistence, their symbols remain… available for adoption by other groups. It’scalled transference. It’s very common in symbology. The Nazis took the swastikafrom the Hindus, the Christians adopted the cruciform from the Egyptians, the-”“This morning,” Kohler challenged, “when I typed the word ‘Illuminati’ into thecomputer, it returned thousands of current references. Apparently a lot ofpeople think this group is still active.”“Conspiracy buffs,” Langdon replied. He had always been annoyed by the plethoraof conspiracy theories that circulated in modern pop culture. The media cravedapocalyptic headlines, and self-proclaimed “cult specialists” were still cashingin on millennium hype with fabricated stories that the Illuminati were alive andwell and organizing their New World Order. Recently the New York Times hadreported the eerie Masonic ties of countless famous men-Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,the Duke of Kent, Peter Sellers, Irving Berlin, Prince Philip, Louis Armstrong,as well as a pantheon of well-known modern-day industrialists and bankingmagnates.Kohler pointed angrily at Vetra’s body. “Considering the evidence, I would sayperhaps the conspiracy buffs are correct.”“I realize how it appears,” Langdon said as diplomatically as he could. “And yeta far more plausible explanation is that some other organization has takencontrol of the Illuminati brand and is using it for their own purposes.”“What purposes? What does this murder prove?”Good question, Langdon thought. He also was having trouble imagining whereanyone could have turned up the Illuminati brand after 400 years. “All I cantell you is that even if the Illuminati were still active today, which I amvirtually positive they are not, they would never be involved in LeonardoVetra’s death.”“No?”“No. The Illuminati may have believed in the abolition of Christianity, but theywielded their power through political and financial means, not throughterrorists acts. Furthermore, the Illuminati had a strict code of moralityregarding who they saw as enemies. They held men of science in the highestregard. There is no way they would have murdered a fellow scientist likeLeonardo Vetra.”Kohler’s eyes turned to ice. “Perhaps I failed to mention that Leonardo Vetrawas anything but an ordinary scientist.”Langdon exhaled patiently. “Mr. Kohler, I’m sure Leonardo Vetra was brilliant inmany ways, but the fact remains-”Without warning, Kohler spun in his wheelchair and accelerated out of the livingroom, leaving a wake of swirling mist as he disappeared down a hallway.For the love of God, Langdon groaned. He followed. Kohler was waiting for him ina small alcove at the end of the hallway.“This is Leonardo’s study,” Kohler said, motioning to the sliding door. “Perhapswhen you see it you’ll understand things differently.” With an awkward grunt,Kohler heaved, and the door slid open.Langdon peered into the study and immediately felt his skin crawl. Holy motherof Jesus, he said to himself."},{"pageContent":"12In another country, a young guard sat patiently before an expansive bank ofvideo monitors. He watched as images flashed before him-live feeds from hundredsof wireless video cameras that surveyed the sprawling complex. The images wentby in an endless procession.An ornate hallway.A private office.An industrial-size kitchen.As the pictures went by, the guard fought off a daydream. He was nearing the endof his shift, and yet he was still vigilant. Service was an honor. Someday hewould be granted his ultimate reward.As his thoughts drifted, an image before him registered alarm. Suddenly, with areflexive jerk that startled even himself, his hand shot out and hit a button onthe control panel. The picture before him froze.His nerves tingling, he leaned toward the screen for a closer look. The readingon the monitor told him the image was being transmitted from camera #86-a camerathat was supposed to be overlooking a hallway.But the image before him was most definitely not a hallway."},{"pageContent":"13Langdon stared in bewilderment at the study before him. “What is this place?”Despite the welcome blast of warm air on his face, he stepped through the doorwith trepidation.Kohler said nothing as he followed Langdon inside.Langdon scanned the room, not having the slightest idea what to make of it. Itcontained the most peculiar mix of artifacts he had ever seen. On the far wall,dominating the decor, was an enormous wooden crucifix, which Langdon placed asfourteenth-century Spanish. Above the cruciform, suspended from the ceiling, wasa metallic mobile of the orbiting planets. To the left was an oil painting ofthe Virgin Mary, and beside that was a laminated periodic table of elements. Onthe side wall, two additional brass cruciforms flanked a poster of AlbertEinstein, his famous quote reading, GOD DOES NOT PLAY DICE WITH THE UNIVERSE.Langdon moved into the room, looking around in astonishment. A leather-boundBible sat on Vetra’s desk beside a plastic Bohr model of an atom and a miniaturereplica of Michelangelo’s Moses.Talk about eclectic, Langdon thought. The warmth felt good, but something aboutthe decor sent a new set of chills through his body. He felt like he waswitnessing the clash of two philosophical titans… an unsettling blur of opposingforces. He scanned the titles on the bookshelf:The God Particle The Tao of Physics God: The EvidenceOne of the bookends was etched with a quote:TRUE SCIENCE DISCOVERS GOD WAITING BEHIND EVERY DOOR. -POPE PIUS XII“Leonardo was a Catholic priest,” Kohler said.Langdon turned. “A priest? I thought you said he was a physicist.”“He was both. Men of science and religion are not unprecedented in history.Leonardo was one of them. He considered physics ‘God’s natural law.’ He claimedGod’s handwriting was visible in the natural order all around us. Throughscience he hoped to prove God’s existence to the doubting masses. He consideredhimself a theo-physicist.”Theo-physicist? Langdon thought it sounded impossibly oxymoronic.“The field of particle physics,” Kohler said, “has made some shockingdiscoveries lately-discoveries quite spiritual in implication. Leonardo wasresponsible for many of them.”Langdon studied CERN’s director, still trying to process the bizarresurroundings. “Spirituality and physics?” Langdon had spent his career studyingreligious history, and if there was one recurring theme, it was that science andreligion had been oil and water since day one… archenemies… unmixable.“Vetra was on the cutting edge of particle physics,” Kohler said. “He wasstarting to fuse science and religion… showing that they complement each otherin most unanticipated ways. He called the field New Physics.” Kohler pulled abook from the shelf and handed it to Langdon.Langdon studied the cover. God, Miracles, and the New Physics-by Leonardo Vetra.“The field is small,” Kohler said, “but it’s bringing fresh answers to some oldquestions-questions about the origin of the universe and the forces that bind usall. Leonardo believed his research had the potential to convert millions to amore spiritual life. Last year he categorically proved the existence of anenergy force that unites us all. He actually demonstrated that we are allphysically connected… that the molecules in your body are intertwined with themolecules in mine… that there is a single force moving within all of us.”Langdon felt disconcerted. And the power of God shall unite us all. “Mr. Vetraactually found a way to demonstrate that particles are connected?”“Conclusive evidence. A recent Scientific American article hailed New Physics asa surer path to God than religion itself.”The comment hit home. Langdon suddenly found himself thinking of theantireligious Illuminati. Reluctantly, he forced himself to permit a momentaryintellectual foray into the impossible. If the Illuminati were indeed stillactive, would they have killed Leonardo to stop him from bringing his religiousmessage to the masses? Langdon shook off the thought. Absurd! The Illuminati areancient history! All academics know that!“Vetra had plenty of enemies in the scientific world,” Kohler went on. “Manyscientific purists despised him. Even here at CERN. They felt that usinganalytical physics to support religious principles was a treason againstscience.”“But aren’t scientists today a bit less defensive about the church?”Kohler grunted in disgust. “Why should we be? The church may not be burningscientists at the stake anymore, but if you think they’ve released their reignover science, ask yourself why half the schools in your country are not allowedto teach evolution. Ask yourself why the U.S. Christian Coalition is the mostinfluential lobby against scientific progress in the world. The battle betweenscience and religion is still raging, Mr. Langdon. It has moved from thebattlefields to the boardrooms, but it is still raging.”Langdon realized Kohler was right. Just last week the Harvard School of Divinityhad marched on the Biology Building, protesting the genetic engineering takingplace in the graduate program. The chairman of the Bio Department, famedornithologist Richard Aaronian, defended his curriculum by hanging a huge bannerfrom his office window. The banner depicted the Christian “fish” modified withfour little feet-a tribute, Aaronian claimed, to the African lungfishes ‘evolution onto dry land. Beneath the fish, instead of the word “Jesus,” was theproclamation “DARWIN!”A sharp beeping sound cut the air, and Langdon looked up. Kohler reached downinto the array of electronics on his wheelchair. He slipped a beeper out of itsholder and read the incoming message.“Good. That is Leonardo’s daughter. Ms. Vetra is arriving at the helipad rightnow. We will meet her there. I think it best she not come up here and see herfather this way.”Langdon agreed. It would be a shock no child deserved.“I will ask Ms. Vetra to explain the project she and her father have beenworking on… perhaps shedding light on why he was murdered.”“You think Vetra’s work is why he was killed?”“Quite possibly. Leonardo told me he was working on something groundbreaking.That is all he said. He had become very secretive about the project. He had aprivate lab and demanded seclusion, which I gladly afforded him on account ofhis brilliance. His work had been consuming huge amounts of electric powerlately, but I refrained from questioning him.” Kohler rotated toward the studydoor. “There is, however, one more thing you need to know before we leave thisflat.”Langdon was not sure he wanted to hear it.“An item was stolen from Vetra by his murderer.”“An item?”“Follow me.”The director propelled his wheelchair back into the fog-filled living room.Langdon followed, not knowing what to expect. Kohler maneuvered to within inchesof Vetra’s body and stopped. He ushered Langdon to join him. Reluctantly,Langdon came close, bile rising in his throat at the smell of the victim’sfrozen urine.“Look at his face,” Kohler said.Look at his face? Langdon frowned. I thought you said something was stolen.Hesitantly, Langdon knelt down. He tried to see Vetra’s face, but the head wastwisted 180 degrees backward, his face pressed into the carpet.Struggling against his handicap Kohler reached down and carefully twistedVetra’s frozen head. Cracking loudly, the corpse’s face rotated into view,contorted in agony. Kohler held it there a moment.“Sweet Jesus!” Langdon cried, stumbling back in horror. Vetra’s face was coveredin blood. A single hazel eye stared lifelessly back at him. The other socket wastattered and empty. “They stole his eye? ”"},{"pageContent":"14Langdon stepped out of Building C into the open air, grateful to be outsideVetra’s flat. The sun helped dissolve the image of the empty eye socketemblazoned into his mind.“This way, please,” Kohler said, veering up a steep path. The electricwheelchair seemed to accelerate effortlessly. “Ms. Vetra will be arriving anymoment.”Langdon hurried to keep up.“So,” Kohler asked. “Do you still doubt the Illuminati’s involvement?”Langdon had no idea what to think anymore. Vetra’s religious affiliations weredefinitely troubling, and yet Langdon could not bring himself to abandon everyshred of academic evidence he had ever researched. Besides, there was the eye…“I still maintain,” Langdon said, more forcefully than he intended. “that theIlluminati are not responsible for this murder. The missing eye is proof.”“What?”“Random mutilation,” Langdon explained, “is very… un-Illuminati. Cultspecialists see desultory defacement from inexperienced fringe sects-zealots whocommit random acts of terrorism-but the Illuminati have always been moredeliberate.”“Deliberate? Surgically removing someone’s eyeball is not deliberate?”“It sends no clear message. It serves no higher purpose.”Kohler’s wheelchair stopped short at the top of the hill. He turned. “Mr.Langdon, believe me, that missing eye does indeed serve a higher purpose… a muchhigher purpose.”As the two men crossed the grassy rise, the beating of helicopter blades becameaudible to the west. A chopper appeared, arching across the open valley towardthem. It banked sharply, then slowed to a hover over a helipad painted on thegrass.Langdon watched, detached, his mind churning circles like the blades, wonderingif a full night’s sleep would make his current disorientation any clearer.Somehow, he doubted it.As the skids touched down, a pilot jumped out and started unloading gear. Therewas a lot of it-duffels, vinyl wet bags, scuba tanks, and crates of whatappeared to be high-tech diving equipment.Langdon was confused. “Is that Ms. Vetra’s gear?” he yelled to Kohler over theroar of the engines.Kohler nodded and yelled back, “She was doing biological research in theBalearic Sea.”“I thought you said she was a physicist! ”“She is. She’s a Bio Entanglement Physicist. She studies the interconnectivityof life systems. Her work ties closely with her father’s work in particlephysics. Recently she disproved one of Einstein’s fundamental theories by usingatomically synchronized cameras to observe a school of tuna fish.”Langdon searched his host’s face for any glint of humor. Einstein and tuna fish?He was starting to wonder if the X-33 space plane had mistakenly dropped him offon the wrong planet.A moment later, Vittoria Vetra emerged from the fuselage. Robert Langdonrealized today was going to be a day of endless surprises. Descending from thechopper in her khaki shorts and white sleeveless top, Vittoria Vetra lookednothing like the bookish physicist he had expected. Lithe and graceful, she wastall with chestnut skin and long black hair that swirled in the backwind of therotors. Her face was unmistakably Italian-not overly beautiful, but possessingfull, earthy features that even at twenty yards seemed to exude a rawsensuality. As the air currents buffeted her body, her clothes clung,accentuating her slender torso and small breasts.“Ms. Vetra is a woman of tremendous personal strength,” Kohler said, seeming tosense Langdon’s captivation. “She spends months at a time working in dangerousecological systems. She is a strict vegetarian and CERN’s resident guru of Hathayoga.”Hatha yoga? Langdon mused. The ancient Buddhist art of meditative stretchingseemed an odd proficiency for the physicist daughter of a Catholic priest.Langdon watched Vittoria approach. She had obviously been crying, her deep sableeyes filled with emotions Langdon could not place. Still, she moved toward themwith fire and command. Her limbs were strong and toned, radiating the healthyluminescence of Mediterranean flesh that had enjoyed long hours in the sun.“Vittoria,” Kohler said as she approached. “My deepest condolences. It’s aterrible loss for science… for all of us here at CERN.”Vittoria nodded gratefully. When she spoke, her voice was smooth-a throaty,accented English. “Do you know who is responsible yet?”“We’re still working on it.”She turned to Langdon, holding out a slender hand. “My name is Vittoria Vetra.You’re from Interpol, I assume?”Langdon took her hand, momentarily spellbound by the depth of her watery gaze.“Robert Langdon.” He was unsure what else to say.“Mr. Langdon is not with the authorities,” Kohler explained. “He is a specialistfrom the U.S. He’s here to help us locate who is responsible for thissituation.”Vittoria looked uncertain. “And the police?”Kohler exhaled but said nothing.“Where is his body?” she demanded.“Being attended to.”The white lie surprised Langdon.“I want to see him,” Vittoria said.“Vittoria,” Kohler urged, “your father was brutally murdered. You would bebetter to remember him as he was.”Vittoria began to speak but was interrupted.“Hey, Vittoria!” voices called from the distance. “Welcome home!”She turned. A group of scientists passing near the helipad waved happily.“Disprove any more of Einstein’s theories?” one shouted.Another added, “Your dad must be proud!”Vittoria gave the men an awkward wave as they passed. Then she turned to Kohler,her face now clouded with confusion. “Nobody knows yet?”“I decided discretion was paramount.”“You haven’t told the staff my father was murdered? ” Her mystified tone was nowlaced with anger.Kohler’s tone hardened instantly. “Perhaps you forget, Ms. Vetra, as soon as Ireport your father’s murder, there will be an investigation of CERN. Including athorough examination of his lab. I have always tried to respect your father’sprivacy. Your father has told me only two things about your current project.One, that it has the potential to bring CERN millions of francs in licensingcontracts in the next decade. And two, that it is not ready for publicdisclosure because it is still hazardous technology. Considering these twofacts, I would prefer strangers not poke around inside his lab and either stealhis work or kill themselves in the process and hold CERN liable. Do I makemyself clear?”Vittoria stared, saying nothing. Langdon sensed in her a reluctant respect andacceptance of Kohler’s logic.“Before we report anything to the authorities,” Kohler said, “I need to knowwhat you two were working on. I need you to take us to your lab.”“The lab is irrelevant,” Vittoria said. “Nobody knew what my father and I weredoing. The experiment could not possibly have anything to do with my father’smurder.”Kohler exhaled a raspy, ailing breath. “Evidence suggests otherwise.”“Evidence? What evidence?”Langdon was wondering the same thing.Kohler was dabbing his mouth again. “You’ll just have to trust me.”It was clear, from Vittoria’s smoldering gaze, that she did not."},{"pageContent":"15Langdon strode silently behind Vittoria and Kohler as they moved back into themain atrium where Langdon’s bizarre visit had begun. Vittoria’s legs drove influid efficiency-like an Olympic diver-a potency, Langdon figured, no doubt bornfrom the flexibility and control of yoga. He could hear her breathing slowly anddeliberately, as if somehow trying to filter her grief.Langdon wanted to say something to her, offer his sympathy. He too had once feltthe abrupt hollowness of unexpectedly losing a parent. He remembered the funeralmostly, rainy and gray. Two days after his twelfth birthday. The house wasfilled with gray-suited men from the office, men who squeezed his hand too hardwhen they shook it. They were all mumbling words like cardiac and stress. Hismother joked through teary eyes that she’d always been able to follow the stockmarket simply by holding her husband’s hand… his pulse her own private tickertape.Once, when his father was alive, Langdon had heard his mom begging his father to“stop and smell the roses.” That year, Langdon bought his father a tinyblown-glass rose for Christmas. It was the most beautiful thing Langdon had everseen… the way the sun caught it, throwing a rainbow of colors on the wall. “It’slovely,” his father had said when he opened it, kissing Robert on the forehead.“Let’s find a safe spot for it.” Then his father had carefully placed the roseon a high dusty shelf in the darkest corner of the living room. A few dayslater, Langdon got a stool, retrieved the rose, and took it back to the store.His father never noticed it was gone.The ping of an elevator pulled Langdon back to the present. Vittoria and Kohlerwere in front of him, boarding the lift. Langdon hesitated outside the opendoors.“Is something wrong?” Kohler asked, sounding more impatient than concerned.“Not at all,” Langdon said, forcing himself toward the cramped carriage. He onlyused elevators when absolutely necessary. He preferred the more open spaces ofstairwells.“Dr. Vetra’s lab is subterranean,” Kohler said.Wonderful, Langdon thought as he stepped across the cleft, feeling an icy windchurn up from the depths of the shaft. The doors closed, and the car began todescend.“Six stories,” Kohler said blankly, like an analytical engine.Langdon pictured the darkness of the empty shaft below them. He tried to blockit out by staring at the numbered display of changing floors. Oddly, theelevator showed only two stops. GROUND LEVEL and LHC.“What’s LHC stand for?” Langdon asked, trying not to sound nervous.“Large Hadron Collider,” Kohler said. “A particle accelerator.”Particle accelerator? Langdon was vaguely familiar with the term. He had firstheard it over dinner with some colleagues at Dunster House in Cambridge. Aphysicist friend of theirs, Bob Brownell, had arrived for dinner one night in arage.“The bastards canceled it!” Brownell cursed.“Canceled what?” they all asked.“The SSC!”“The what?”“The Superconducting Super Collider!”Someone shrugged. “I didn’t know Harvard was building one.”“Not Harvard!” he exclaimed. “The U.S.! It was going to be the world’s mostpowerful particle accelerator! One of the most important scientific projects ofthe century! Two billion dollars into it and the Senate sacks the project! DamnBible-Belt lobbyists!”When Brownell finally calmed down, he explained that a particle accelerator wasa large, circular tube through which subatomic particles were accelerated.Magnets in the tube turned on and off in rapid succession to “push” particlesaround and around until they reached tremendous velocities. Fully acceleratedparticles circled the tube at over 180,000 miles per second.“But that’s almost the speed of light,” one of the professors exclaimed.“Damn right,” Brownell said. He went on to say that by accelerating twoparticles in opposite directions around the tube and then colliding them,scientists could shatter the particles into their constituent parts and get aglimpse of nature’s most fundamental components. “Particle accelerators,”Brownell declared, “are critical to the future of science. Colliding particlesis the key to understanding the building blocks of the universe.”Harvard’s Poet in Residence, a quiet man named Charles Pratt, did not lookimpressed. “It sounds to me,” he said, “like a rather Neanderthal approach toscience… akin to smashing clocks together to discern their internal workings.”Brownell dropped his fork and stormed out of the room.So CERN has a particle accelerator? Langdon thought, as the elevator dropped. Acircular tube for smashing particles. He wondered why they had buried itunderground.When the elevator thumped to a stop, Langdon was relieved to feel terra firmabeneath his feet. But when the doors slid open, his relief evaporated. RobertLangdon found himself standing once again in a totally alien world.The passageway stretched out indefinitely in both directions, left and right. Itwas a smooth cement tunnel, wide enough to allow passage of an eighteen wheeler.Brightly lit where they stood, the corridor turned pitch black farther down. Adamp wind rustled out of the darkness-an unsettling reminder that they were nowdeep in the earth. Langdon could almost sense the weight of the dirt and stonenow hanging above his head. For an instant he was nine years old… the darknessforcing him back… back to the five hours of crushing blackness that haunted himstill. Clenching his fists, he fought it off.Vittoria remained hushed as she exited the elevator and strode off withouthesitation into the darkness without them. Overhead the flourescents flickeredon to light her path. The effect was unsettling, Langdon thought, as if thetunnel were alive… anticipating her every move. Langdon and Kohler followed,trailing a distance behind. The lights extinguished automatically behind them.“This particle accelerator,” Langdon said quietly. “It’s down this tunnelsomeplace?”“That’s it there.” Kohler motioned to his left where a polished, chrome tube ranalong the tunnel’s inner wall.Langdon eyed the tube, confused. “That’s the accelerator?” The device lookednothing like he had imagined. It was perfectly straight, about three feet indiameter, and extended horizontally the visible length of the tunnel beforedisappearing into the darkness. Looks more like a high-tech sewer, Langdonthought. “I thought particle accelerators were circular.”“This accelerator is a circle,” Kohler said. “It appears straight, but that isan optical illusion. The circumference of this tunnel is so large that the curveis imperceptible-like that of the earth.”Langdon was flabbergasted. This is a circle? “But… it must be enormous!”“The LHC is the largest machine in the world.”Langdon did a double take. He remembered the CERN driver saying something abouta huge machine buried in the earth. But-“It is over eight kilometers in diameter… and twenty-seven kilometers long.”Langdon’s head whipped around. “Twenty-seven kilometers?” He stared at thedirector and then turned and looked into the darkened tunnel before him. “Thistunnel is twenty-seven kilometers long? That’s… that’s over sixteen miles!”Kohler nodded. “Bored in a perfect circle. It extends all the way into Francebefore curving back here to this spot. Fully accelerated particles will circlethe tube more than ten thousand times in a single second before they collide.”Langdon’s legs felt rubbery as he stared down the gaping tunnel. “You’re tellingme that CERN dug out millions of tons of earth just to smash tiny particles?”Kohler shrugged. “Sometimes to find truth, one must move mountains.”"},{"pageContent":"16Hundreds of miles from CERN, a voice crackled through a walkie-talkie. “Okay,I’m in the hallway.”The technician monitoring the video screens pressed the button on histransmitter. “You’re looking for camera #86. It’s supposed to be at the farend.”There was a long silence on the radio. The waiting technician broke a lightsweat. Finally his radio clicked.“The camera isn’t here,” the voice said. “I can see where it was mounted,though. Somebody must have removed it.”The technician exhaled heavily. “Thanks. Hold on a second, will you?”Sighing, he redirected his attention to the bank of video screens in front ofhim. Huge portions of the complex were open to the public, and wireless camerashad gone missing before, usually stolen by visiting pranksters looking forsouvenirs. But as soon as a camera left the facility and was out of range, thesignal was lost, and the screen went blank. Perplexed, the technician gazed upat the monitor. A crystal clear image was still coming from camera #86.If the camera was stolen, he wondered, why are we still getting a signal? Heknew, of course, there was only one explanation. The camera was still inside thecomplex, and someone had simply moved it. But who? And why?He studied the monitor a long moment. Finally he picked up his walkie-talkie.“Are there any closets in that stairwell? Any cupboards or dark alcoves?”The voice replying sounded confused. “No. Why?”The technician frowned. “Never mind. Thanks for your help.” He turned off hiswalkie-talkie and pursed his lips.Considering the small size of the video camera and the fact that it waswireless, the technician knew that camera #86 could be transmitting from justabout anywhere within the heavily guarded compound-a densely packed collectionof thirty-two separate buildings covering a half-mile radius. The only clue wasthat the camera seemed to have been placed somewhere dark. Of course, thatwasn’t much help. The complex contained endless dark locations-maintenanceclosets, heating ducts, gardening sheds, bedroom wardrobes, even a labyrinth ofunderground tunnels. Camera #86 could take weeks to locate.But that’s the least of my problems, he thought.Despite the dilemma posed by the camera’s relocation, there was another far moreunsettling matter at hand. The technician gazed up at the image the lost camerawas transmitting. It was a stationary object. A modern-looking device likenothing the technician had ever seen. He studied the blinking electronic displayat its base.Although the guard had undergone rigorous training preparing him for tensesituations, he still sensed his pulse rising. He told himself not to panic.There had to be an explanation. The object appeared too small to be ofsignificant danger. Then again, its presence inside the complex was troubling.Very troubling, indeed.Today of all days, he thought.Security was always a top priority for his employer, but today, more than anyother day in the past twelve years, security was of the utmost importance. Thetechnician stared at the object for a long time and sensed the rumblings of adistant gathering storm.Then, sweating, he dialed his superior."},{"pageContent":"17Not many children could say they remembered the day they met their father, butVittoria Vetra could. She was eight years old, living where she always had,Orfanotrofio di Siena, a Catholic orphanage near Florence, deserted by parentsshe never knew. It was raining that day. The nuns had called for her twice tocome to dinner, but as always she pretended not to hear. She lay outside in thecourtyard, staring up at the raindrops… feeling them hit her body… trying toguess where one would land next. The nuns called again, threatening thatpneumonia might make an insufferably headstrong child a lot less curious aboutnature.I can’t hear you, Vittoria thought.She was soaked to the bone when the young priest came out to get her. She didn’tknow him. He was new there. Vittoria waited for him to grab her and drag herback inside. But he didn’t. Instead, to her wonder, he lay down beside her,soaking his robes in a puddle.“They say you ask a lot of questions,” the young man said.Vittoria scowled. “Are questions bad?”He laughed. “Guess they were right.”“What are you doing out here?”“Same thing you’re doing… wondering why raindrops fall.”“I’m not wondering why they fall! I already know!”The priest gave her an astonished look. “You do?”“Sister Francisca says raindrops are angels’ tears coming down to wash away oursins.”“Wow!” he said, sounding amazed. “So that explains it.”“No it doesn’t!” the girl fired back. “Raindrops fall because everything falls!Everything falls! Not just rain!”The priest scratched his head, looking perplexed. “You know, young lady, you’reright. Everything does fall. It must be gravity.”“It must be what?”He gave her an astonished look. “You haven’t heard of gravity?”“No.”The priest shrugged sadly. “Too bad. Gravity answers a lot of questions.”Vittoria sat up. “What’s gravity?” she demanded. “Tell me!”The priest gave her a wink. “What do you say I tell you over dinner.”The young priest was Leonardo Vetra. Although he had been an award-winningphysics student while in university, he’d heard another call and gone into theseminary. Leonardo and Vittoria became unlikely best friends in the lonely worldof nuns and regulations. Vittoria made Leonardo laugh, and he took her under hiswing, teaching her that beautiful things like rainbows and the rivers had manyexplanations. He told her about light, planets, stars, and all of nature throughthe eyes of both God and science. Vittoria’s innate intellect and curiosity madeher a captivating student. Leonardo protected her like a daughter.Vittoria was happy too. She had never known the joy of having a father. Whenevery other adult answered her questions with a slap on the wrist, Leonardospent hours showing her books. He even asked what her ideas were. Vittoriaprayed Leonardo would stay with her forever. Then one day, her worst nightmarecame true. Father Leonardo told her he was leaving the orphanage.“I’m moving to Switzerland,” Leonardo said. “I have a grant to study physics atthe University of Geneva.”“Physics?” Vittoria cried. “I thought you loved God!”“I do, very much. Which is why I want to study his divine rules. The laws ofphysics are the canvas God laid down on which to paint his masterpiece.”Vittoria was devastated. But Father Leonardo had some other news. He toldVittoria he had spoken to his superiors, and they said it was okay if FatherLeonardo adopted her.“Would you like me to adopt you?” Leonardo asked.“What’s adopt mean?” Vittoria said.Father Leonardo told her.Vittoria hugged him for five minutes, crying tears of joy. “Oh yes! Yes!”Leonardo told her he had to leave for a while and get their new home settled inSwitzerland, but he promised to send for her in six months. It was the longestwait of Vittoria’s life, but Leonardo kept his word. Five days before her ninthbirthday, Vittoria moved to Geneva. She attended Geneva International Schoolduring the day and learned from her father at night.Three years later Leonardo Vetra was hired by CERN. Vittoria and Leonardorelocated to a wonderland the likes of which the young Vittoria had neverimagined.Vittoria Vetra’s body felt numb as she strode down the LHC tunnel. She saw hermuted reflection in the LHC and sensed her father’s absence. Normally sheexisted in a state of deep calm, in harmony with the world around her. But now,very suddenly, nothing made sense. The last three hours had been a blur.It had been 10 A.M. in the Balearic Islands when Kohler’s call came through.Your father has been murdered. Come home immediately. Despite the swelteringheat on the deck of the dive boat, the words had chilled her to the bone,Kohler’s emotionless tone hurting as much as the news.Now she had returned home. But home to what? CERN, her world since she wastwelve, seemed suddenly foreign. Her father, the man who had made it magical,was gone.Deep breaths, she told herself, but she couldn’t calm her mind. The questionscircled faster and faster. Who killed her father? And why? Who was this American“specialist”? Why was Kohler insisting on seeing the lab?Kohler had said there was evidence that her father’s murder was related to thecurrent project. What evidence? Nobody knew what we were working on! And even ifsomeone found out, why would they kill him?As she moved down the LHC tunnel toward her father’s lab, Vittoria realized shewas about to unveil her father’s greatest achievement without him there. She hadpictured this moment much differently. She had imagined her father callingCERN’s top scientists to his lab, showing them his discovery, watching theirawestruck faces. Then he would beam with fatherly pride as he explained to themhow it had been one of Vittoria’s ideas that had helped him make the project areality… that his daughter had been integral in his breakthrough. Vittoria felta lump in her throat. My father and I were supposed to share this momenttogether. But here she was alone. No colleagues. No happy faces. Just anAmerican stranger and Maximilian Kohler.Maximilian Kohler. Der Kцnig.Even as a child, Vittoria had disliked the man. Although she eventually came torespect his potent intellect, his icy demeanor always seemed inhuman, the exactantithesis of her father’s warmth. Kohler pursued science for its immaculatelogic… her father for its spiritual wonder. And yet oddly there had alwaysseemed to be an unspoken respect between the two men. Genius, someone had onceexplained to her, accepts genius unconditionally.Genius, she thought. My father… Dad. Dead.The entry to Leonardo Vetra’s lab was a long sterile hallway paved entirely inwhite tile. Langdon felt like he was entering some kind of underground insaneasylum. Lining the corridor were dozens of framed, black-and-white images.Although Langdon had made a career of studying images, these were entirely aliento him. They looked like chaotic negatives of random streaks and spirals. Modernart? he mused. Jackson Pollock on amphetamines?“Scatter plots,” Vittoria said, apparently noting Langdon’s interest. “Computerrepresentations of particle collisions. That’s the Z-particle,” she said,pointing to a faint track that was almost invisible in the confusion. “My fatherdiscovered it five years ago. Pure energy-no mass at all. It may well be thesmallest building block in nature. Matter is nothing but trapped energy.”Matter is energy? Langdon cocked his head. Sounds pretty Zen. He gazed at thetiny streak in the photograph and wondered what his buddies in the Harvardphysics department would say when he told them he’d spent the weekend hangingout in a Large Hadron Collider admiring Z-particles.“Vittoria,” Kohler said, as they approached the lab’s imposing steel door, “Ishould mention that I came down here this morning looking for your father.”Vittoria flushed slightly. “You did?”“Yes. And imagine my surprise when I discovered he had replaced CERN’s standardkeypad security with something else.” Kohler motioned to an intricate electronicdevice mounted beside the door.“I apologize,” she said. “You know how he was about privacy. He didn’t wantanyone but the two of us to have access.”Kohler said, “Fine. Open the door.”Vittoria stood a long moment. Then, pulling a deep breath, she walked to themechanism on the wall.Langdon was in no way prepared for what happened next.Vittoria stepped up to the device and carefully aligned her right eye with aprotruding lens that looked like a telescope. Then she pressed a button. Insidethe machine, something clicked. A shaft of light oscillated back and forth,scanning her eyeball like a copy machine.“It’s a retina scan,” she said. “Infallible security. Authorized for two retinapatterns only. Mine and my father’s.”Robert Langdon stood in horrified revelation. The image of Leonardo Vetra cameback in grisly detail-the bloody face, the solitary hazel eye staring back, andthe empty eye socket. He tried to reject the obvious truth, but then he saw it…beneath the scanner on the white tile floor… faint droplets of crimson. Driedblood.Vittoria, thankfully, did not notice.The steel door slid open and she walked through.Kohler fixed Langdon with an adamant stare. His message was clear: As I toldyou… the missing eye serves a higher purpose."},{"pageContent":"18The woman’s hands were tied, her wrists now purple and swollen from chafing. Themahogany-skinned Hassassin lay beside her, spent, admiring his naked prize. Hewondered if her current slumber was just a deception, a pathetic attempt toavoid further service to him.He did not care. He had reaped sufficient reward. Sated, he sat up in bed.In his country women were possessions. Weak. Tools of pleasure. Chattel to betraded like livestock. And they understood their place. But here, in Europe,women feigned a strength and independence that both amused and excited him.Forcing them into physical submission was a gratification he always enjoyed.Now, despite the contentment in his loins, the Hassassin sensed another appetitegrowing within him. He had killed last night, killed and mutilated, and for himkilling was like heroin… each encounter satisfying only temporarily beforeincreasing his longing for more. The exhilaration had worn off. The craving hadreturned.He studied the sleeping woman beside him. Running his palm across her neck, hefelt aroused with the knowledge that he could end her life in an instant. Whatwould it matter? She was subhuman, a vehicle only of pleasure and service. Hisstrong fingers encircled her throat, savoring her delicate pulse. Then, fightingdesire, he removed his hand. There was work to do. Service to a higher causethan his own desire.As he got out of bed, he reveled in the honor of the job before him. He stillcould not fathom the influence of this man named Janus and the ancientbrotherhood he commanded. Wondrously, the brotherhood had chosen him.

Their assassin and their messenger. The one his people knew asMalak al-haq-the Angel of Truth."},{"pageContent":"19Vetra’s lab was wildly futuristic.Stark white and bounded on all sides by computers and specialized electronicequipment, it looked like some sort of operating room. Langdon wondered whatsecrets this place could possibly hold to justify cutting out someone’s eye togain entrance.Kohler looked uneasy as they entered, his eyes seeming to dart about for signsof an intruder. But the lab was deserted. Vittoria moved slowly too… as if thelab felt unknown without her father there.Langdon’s gaze landed immediately in the center of the room, where a series ofshort pillars rose from the floor. Like a miniature Stonehenge, a dozen or socolumns of polished steel stood in a circle in the middle of the room. Thepillars were about three feet tall, reminding Langdon of museum displays forvaluable gems. These pillars, however, were clearly not for precious stones.Each supported a thick, transparent canister about the size of a tennis ballcan. They appeared empty.Kohler eyed the canisters, looking puzzled. He apparently decided to ignore themfor the time being. He turned to Vittoria. “Has anything been stolen?”“Stolen? How?” she argued. “The retina scan only allows entry to us.”“Just look around.”Vittoria sighed and surveyed the room for a few moments. She shrugged.“Everything looks as my father always leaves it. Ordered chaos.”Langdon sensed Kohler weighing his options, as if wondering how far to pushVittoria… how much to tell her. Apparently he decided to leave it for themoment. Moving his wheelchair toward the center of the room, he surveyed themysterious cluster of seemingly empty canisters.“Secrets,” Kohler finally said, “are a luxury we can no longer afford.”Vittoria nodded in acquiescence, looking suddenly emotional, as if being herebrought with it a torrent of memories.Give her a minute, Langdon thought.As though preparing for what she was about to reveal, Vittoria closed her eyesand breathed. Then she breathed again. And again. And again…Langdon watched her, suddenly concerned. Is she okay? He glanced at Kohler, whoappeared unfazed, apparently having seen this ritual before. Ten seconds passedbefore Vittoria opened her eyes.Langdon could not believe the metamorphosis. Vittoria Vetra had beentransformed. Her full lips were lax, her shoulders down, and her eyes soft andassenting. It was as though she had realigned every muscle in her body to acceptthe situation. The resentful fire and personal anguish had been quelled somehowbeneath a deeper, watery cool.“Where to begin…” she said, her accent unruffled.“At the beginning,” Kohler said. “Tell us about your father’s experiment.”“Rectifying science with religion has been my father’s life dream,” Vittoriasaid. “He hoped to prove that science and religion are two totally compatiblefields-two different approaches to finding the same truth.” She paused as ifunable to believe what she was about to say. “And recently… he conceived of away to do that.”Kohler said nothing.“He devised an experiment, one he hoped would settle one of the most bitterconflicts in the history of science and religion.”Langdon wondered which conflict she could mean. There were so many.“Creationism,” Vittoria declared. “The battle over how the universe came to be.”Oh, Langdon thought. THE debate.“The Bible, of course, states that God created the universe,” she explained.“God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and everything we see appeared out of a vastemptiness. Unfortunately, one of the fundamental laws of physics states thatmatter cannot be created out of nothing.”Langdon had read about this stalemate. The idea that God allegedly created“something from nothing” was totally contrary to accepted laws of modern physicsand therefore, scientists claimed, Genesis was scientifically absurd.“Mr. Langdon,” Vittoria said, turning, “I assume you are familiar with the BigBang Theory?”Langdon shrugged. “More or less.” The Big Bang, he knew, was the scientificallyaccepted model for the creation of the universe. He didn’t really understand it,but according to the theory, a single point of intensely focused energy eruptedin a cataclysmic explosion, expanding outward to form the universe. Or somethinglike that.Vittoria continued. “When the Catholic Church first proposed the Big Bang Theoryin 1927, the-”“I’m sorry?” Langdon interrupted, before he could stop himself. “You say the BigBang was a Catholic idea?”Vittoria looked surprised by his question “Of course. Proposed by a Catholicmonk, Georges Lemaоtre in 1927.”“But, I thought…” he hesitated. “Wasn’t the Big Bang proposed by Harvardastronomer Edwin Hubble?”Kohler glowered. “Again, American scientific arrogance. Hubble published in1929, two years after Lemaоtre.”Langdon scowled. It’s called the Hubble Telescope, sir-I’ve never heard of anyLemaоtre Telescope!“Mr. Kohler is right,” Vittoria said, “the idea belonged to Lemaоtre. Hubbleonly confirmed it by gathering the hard evidence that proved the Big Bang wasscientifically probable.”“Oh,” Langdon said, wondering if the Hubble-fanatics in the Harvard AstronomyDepartment ever mentioned Lemaоtre in their lectures.“When Lemaоtre first proposed the Big Bang Theory,” Vittoria continued,“scientists claimed it was utterly ridiculous. Matter, science said, could notbe created out of nothing. So, when Hubble shocked the world by scientificallyproving the Big Bang was accurate, the church claimed victory, heralding this asproof that the Bible was scientifically accurate. The divine truth.”Langdon nodded, focusing intently now.“Of course scientists did not appreciate having their discoveries used by thechurch to promote religion, so they immediately mathematicized the Big BangTheory, removed all religious overtones, and claimed it as their own.Unfortunately for science, however, their equations, even today, have oneserious deficiency that the church likes to point out.”Kohler grunted. “The singularity.” He spoke the word as if it were the bane ofhis existence.“Yes, the singularity,” Vittoria said. “The exact moment of creation. Timezero.” She looked at Langdon. “Even today, science cannot grasp the initialmoment of creation. Our equations explain the early universe quite effectively,but as we move back in time, approaching time zero, suddenly our mathematicsdisintegrates, and everything becomes meaningless.”“Correct,” Kohler said, his voice edgy, “and the church holds up this deficiencyas proof of God’s miraculous involvement. Come to your point.”Vittoria’s expression became distant. “My point is that my father had alwaysbelieved in God’s involvement in the Big Bang. Even though science was unable tocomprehend the divine moment of creation, he believed someday it would.” Shemotioned sadly to a laser-printed memo tacked over her father’s work area. “Mydad used to wave that in my face every time I had doubts.”Langdon read the message:SCIENCE AND RELIGION ARE NOT AT ODDS. SCIENCE IS SIMPLY TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND.“My dad wanted to bring science to a higher level,” Vittoria said, “wherescience supported the concept of God.” She ran a hand through her long hair,looking melancholy. “He set out to do something no scientist had ever thought todo. Something that no one has ever had the technology to do.” She paused, asthough uncertain how to speak the next words. “He designed an experiment toprove Genesis was possible.”Prove Genesis? Langdon wondered. Let there be light? Matter from nothing?Kohler’s dead gaze bore across the room. “I beg your pardon?”“My father created a universe… from nothing at all.”Kohler snapped his head around. “What!”“Better said, he recreated the Big Bang.”Kohler looked ready to jump to his feet.Langdon was officially lost. Creating a universe? Recreating the Big Bang?“It was done on a much smaller scale, of course,” Vittoria said, talking fasternow. “The process was remarkably simple. He accelerated two ultrathin particlebeams in opposite directions around the accelerator tube. The two beams collidedhead-on at enormous speeds, driving into one another and compressing all theirenergy into a single pinpoint. He achieved extreme energy densities.” Shestarted rattling off a stream of units, and the director’s eyes grew wider.Langdon tried to keep up. So Leonardo Vetra was simulating the compressed pointof energy from which the universe supposedly sprang.“The result,” Vittoria said, “was nothing short of wondrous. When it ispublished, it will shake the very foundation of modern physics.” She spokeslowly now, as though savoring the immensity of her news. “Without warning,inside the accelerator tube, at this point of highly focused energy, particlesof matter began appearing out of nowhere.”Kohler made no reaction. He simply stared.“Matter,” Vittoria repeated. “Blossoming out of nothing. An incredible displayof subatomic fireworks. A miniature universe springing to life. He proved notonly that matter can be created from nothing, but that the Big Bang and Genesiscan be explained simply by accepting the presence of an enormous source ofenergy.”“You mean God?” Kohler demanded.“God, Buddha, The Force, Yahweh, the singularity, the unicity point-call itwhatever you like-the result is the same. Science and religion support the sametruth-pure energy is the father of creation.”When Kohler finally spoke, his voice was somber. “Vittoria, you have me at aloss. It sounds like you’re telling me your father created matter… out ofnothing?”“Yes.” Vittoria motioned to the canisters. “And there is the proof. In thosecanisters are specimens of the matter he created.”Kohler coughed and moved toward the canisters like a wary animal circlingsomething he instinctively sensed was wrong. “I’ve obviously missed something,”he said. “How do you expect anyone to believe these canisters contain particlesof matter your father actually created? They could be particles from anywhere atall.”“Actually,” Vittoria said, sounding confident, “they couldn’t. These particlesare unique. They are a type of matter that does not exist anywhere on earth…hence they had to be created.”Kohler’s expression darkened. “Vittoria, what do you mean a certain type ofmatter? There is only one type of matter, and it-” Kohler stopped short.Vittoria’s expression was triumphant. “You’ve lectured on it yourself, director.The universe contains two kinds of matter. Scientific fact.” Vittoria turned toLangdon. “Mr. Langdon, what does the Bible say about the Creation? What did Godcreate?”Langdon felt awkward, not sure what this had to do with anything. “Um, Godcreated… light and dark, heaven and hell-”“Exactly,” Vittoria said. “He created everything in opposites. Symmetry. Perfectbalance.” She turned back to Kohler. “Director, science claims the same thing asreligion, that the Big Bang created everything in the universe with anopposite.”“Including matter itself,” Kohler whispered, as if to himself.Vittoria nodded. “And when my father ran his experiment, sure enough, two kindsof matter appeared.”Langdon wondered what this meant. Leonardo Vetra created matter’s opposite?Kohler looked angry. “The substance you’re referring to only exists elsewhere inthe universe. Certainly not on earth. And possibly not even in our galaxy!”“Exactly,” Vittoria replied, “which is proof that the particles in thesecanisters had to be created.”Kohler’s face hardened. “Vittoria, surely you can’t be saying those canisterscontain actual specimens?”“I am.” She gazed proudly at the canisters. “Director, you are looking at theworld’s first specimens of antimatter.”"},{"pageContent":"20Phase two, the Hassassin thought, striding into the darkened tunnel.The torch in his hand was overkill.

He felt suddenly dumb. “Yes. Well… sort of.”A faint smile crossed her lips. “You watch Star Trek.”Langdon flushed. “Well, my students enjoy…” He frowned. “Isn’t antimatter whatfuels the U.S.S. Enterprise?”She nodded. “Good science fiction has its roots in good science.”“So antimatter is real?”“A fact of nature. Everything has an opposite. Protons have electrons. Up-quarkshave down-quarks. There is a cosmic symmetry at the subatomic level. Antimatteris yin to matter’s yang. It balances the physical equation.”Langdon thought of Galileo’s belief of duality.“Scientists have known since 1918,” Vittoria said, “that two kinds of matterwere created in the Big Bang. One matter is the kind we see here on earth,making up rocks, trees, people. The other is its inverse-identical to matter inall respects except that the charges of its particles are reversed.”Kohler spoke as though emerging from a fog. His voice sounded suddenlyprecarious. “But there are enormous technological barriers to actually storingantimatter. What about neutralization?”“My father built a reverse polarity vacuum to pull the antimatter positrons outof the accelerator before they could decay.”Kohler scowled. “But a vacuum would pull out the matter also. There would be noway to separate the particles.”“He applied a magnetic field. Matter arced right, and antimatter arced left.They are polar opposites.”At that instant, Kohler’s wall of doubt seemed to crack. He looked up atVittoria in clear astonishment and then without warning was overcome by a fit ofcoughing. “Incred… ible…” he said, wiping his mouth, “and yet…” It seemed hislogic was still resisting. “Yet even if the vacuum worked, these canisters aremade of matter. Antimatter cannot be stored inside canisters made out of matter.The antimatter would instantly react with-”“The specimen is not touching the canister,” Vittoria said, apparently expectingthe question. “The antimatter is suspended. The canisters are called ‘antimattertraps’ because they literally trap the antimatter in the center of the canister,suspending it at a safe distance from the sides and bottom.”“Suspended? But… how?”“Between two intersecting magnetic fields. Here, have a look.”Vittoria walked across the room and retrieved a large electronic apparatus. Thecontraption reminded Langdon of some sort of cartoon ray gun-a wide cannonlikebarrel with a sighting scope on top and a tangle of electronics dangling below.Vittoria aligned the scope with one of the canisters, peered into the eyepiece,and calibrated some knobs. Then she stepped away, offering Kohler a look.Kohler looked nonplussed. “You collected visible amounts?”“Five thousand nanograms,” Vittoria said. “A liquid plasma containing millionsof positrons.”“Millions? But a few particles is all anyone has ever detected… anywhere.”“Xenon,” Vittoria said flatly. “He accelerated the particle beam through a jetof xenon, stripping away the electrons. He insisted on keeping the exactprocedure a secret, but it involved simultaneously injecting raw electrons intothe accelerator.”Langdon felt lost, wondering if their conversation was still in English.Kohler paused, the lines in his brow deepening. Suddenly he drew a short breath.He slumped like he’d been hit with a bullet. “Technically that would leave…”Vittoria nodded. “Yes. Lots of it.”Kohler returned his gaze to the canister before him. With a look of uncertainty,he hoisted himself in his chair and placed his eye to the viewer, peeringinside. He stared a long time without saying anything. When he finally sat down,his forehead was covered with sweat. The lines on his face had disappeared. Hisvoice was a whisper. “My God… you really did it.”Vittoria nodded. “My father did it.”“I… I don’t know what to say.”Vittoria turned to Langdon. “Would you like a look?” She motioned to the viewingdevice.Uncertain what to expect, Langdon moved forward. From two feet away, thecanister appeared empty. Whatever was inside was infinitesimal. Langdon placedhis eye to the viewer. It took a moment for the image before him to come intofocus.Then he saw it.The object was not on the bottom of the container as he expected, but rather itwas floating in the center-suspended in midair-a shimmering globule ofmercurylike liquid. Hovering as if by magic, the liquid tumbled in space.Metallic wavelets rippled across the droplet’s surface. The suspended fluidreminded Langdon of a video he had once seen of a water droplet in zero G.Although he knew the globule was microscopic, he could see every changing gorgeand undulation as the ball of plasma rolled slowly in suspension.“It’s… floating,” he said.“It had better be,” Vittoria replied. “Antimatter is highly unstable.Energetically speaking, antimatter is the mirror image of matter, so the twoinstantly cancel each other out if they come in contact. Keeping antimatterisolated from matter is a challenge, of course, because everything on earth ismade of matter. The samples have to be stored without ever touching anything atall-even air.”Langdon was amazed. Talk about working in a vacuum.“These antimatter traps?” Kohler interrupted, looking amazed as he ran a pallidfinger around one’s base. “They are your father’s design?”“Actually,” she said, “they are mine.”Kohler looked up.Vittoria’s voice was unassuming. “My father produced the first particles ofantimatter but was stymied by how to store them. I suggested these. Airtightnanocomposite shells with opposing electromagnets at each end.”“It seems your father’s genius has rubbed off.”“Not really. I borrowed the idea from nature. Portuguese man-o‘-wars trap fishbetween their tentacles using nematocystic charges. Same principle here. Eachcanister has two electromagnets, one at each end. Their opposing magnetic fieldsintersect in the center of the canister and hold the antimatter there, suspendedin midvacuum.”Langdon looked again at the canister. Antimatter floating in a vacuum, nottouching anything at all. Kohler was right. It was genius.“Where’s the power source for the magnets?” Kohler asked.Vittoria pointed. “In the pillar beneath the trap. The canisters are screwedinto a docking port that continuously recharges them so the magnets never fail.”“And if the field fails?”“The obvious. The antimatter falls out of suspension, hits the bottom of thetrap, and we see an annihilation.”Langdon’s ears pricked up. “Annihilation?” He didn’t like the sound of it.Vittoria looked unconcerned. “Yes. If antimatter and matter make contact, bothare destroyed instantly. Physicists call the process ‘annihilation.’ ”Langdon nodded. “Oh.”“It is nature’s simplest reaction. A particle of matter and a particle ofantimatter combine to release two new particles-called photons. A photon iseffectively a tiny puff of light.”Langdon had read about photons-light particles-the purest form of energy. Hedecided to refrain from asking about Captain Kirk’s use of photon torpedoesagainst the Klingons. “So if the antimatter falls, we see a tiny puff of light?”Vittoria shrugged. “Depends what you call tiny. Here, let me demonstrate.” Shereached for the canister and started to unscrew it from its charging podium.Without warning, Kohler let out a cry of terror and lunged forward, knocking herhands away. “Vittoria! Are you insane!”"},{"pageContent":"22Kohler, incredibly, was standing for a moment, teetering on two withered legs.His face was white with fear. “Vittoria! You can’t remove that trap!”Langdon watched, bewildered by the director’s sudden panic.“Five hundred nanograms!” Kohler said. “If you break the magnetic field-”“Director,” Vittoria assured, “it’s perfectly safe. Every trap has a failsafe-aback-up battery in case it is removed from its recharger. The specimen remainssuspended even if I remove the canister.”Kohler looked uncertain. Then, hesitantly, he settled back into his chair.“The batteries activate automatically,” Vittoria said, “when the trap is movedfrom the recharger. They work for twenty-four hours. Like a reserve tank ofgas.” She turned to Langdon, as if sensing his discomfort. “Antimatter has someastonishing characteristics, Mr. Langdon, which make it quite dangerous. A tenmilligram sample-the volume of a grain of sand-is hypothesized to hold as muchenergy as about two hundred metric tons of conventional rocket fuel.”Langdon’s head was spinning again.“It is the energy source of tomorrow. A thousand times more powerful thannuclear energy. One hundred percent efficient. No byproducts. No radiation. Nopollution. A few grams could power a major city for a week.”Grams? Langdon stepped uneasily back from the podium.“Don’t worry,” Vittoria said. “These samples are minuscule fractions of agram-millionths. Relatively harmless.” She reached for the canister again andtwisted it from its docking platform.Kohler twitched but did not interfere. As the trap came free, there was a sharpbeep, and a small LED display activated near the base of the trap. The reddigits blinked, counting down from twenty-four hours.24:00:00…23:59:59…23:59:58…Langdon studied the descending counter and decided it looked unsettlingly like atime bomb.“The battery,” Vittoria explained, “will run for the full twenty-four hoursbefore dying. It can be recharged by placing the trap back on the podium. It’sdesigned as a safety measure, but it’s also convenient for transport.”“Transport?” Kohler looked thunderstruck. “You take this stuff out of the lab?”“Of course not,” Vittoria said. “But the mobility allows us to study it.”Vittoria led Langdon and Kohler to the far end of the room. She pulled a curtainaside to reveal a window, beyond which was a large room. The walls, floors, andceiling were entirely plated in steel. The room reminded Langdon of the holdingtank of an oil freighter he had once taken to Papua New Guinea to study Hantabody graffiti.“It’s an annihilation tank,” Vittoria declared.Kohler looked up. “You actually observe annihilations?”“My father was fascinated with the physics of the Big Bang-large amounts ofenergy from minuscule kernels of matter.” Vittoria pulled open a steel drawerbeneath the window. She placed the trap inside the drawer and closed it. Thenshe pulled a lever beside the drawer. A moment later, the trap appeared on theother side of the glass, rolling smoothly in a wide arc across the metal flooruntil it came to a stop near the center of the room.Vittoria gave a tight smile. “You’re about to witness your firstantimatter-matter annihilation. A few millionths of a gram. A relativelyminuscule specimen.”Langdon looked out at the antimatter trap sitting alone on the floor of theenormous tank. Kohler also turned toward the window, looking uncertain.“Normally,” Vittoria explained, “we’d have to wait the full twenty-four hoursuntil the batteries died, but this chamber contains magnets beneath the floorthat can override the trap, pulling the antimatter out of suspension. And whenthe matter and antimatter touch…”“Annihilation,” Kohler whispered.“One more thing,” Vittoria said. “Antimatter releases pure energy. A one hundredpercent conversion of mass to photons. So don’t look directly at the sample.Shield your eyes.”Langdon was wary, but he now sensed Vittoria was being overly dramatic. Don’tlook directly at the canister? The device was more than thirty yards away,behind an ultrathick wall of tinted Plexiglas. Moreover, the speck in thecanister was invisible, microscopic. Shield my eyes? Langdon thought. How muchenergy could that speck possibly-Vittoria pressed the button.Instantly, Langdon was blinded. A brilliant point of light shone in the canisterand then exploded outward in a shock wave of light that radiated in alldirections, erupting against the window before him with thunderous force. Hestumbled back as the detonation rocked the vault. The light burned bright for amoment, searing, and then, after an instant, it rushed back inward, absorbing inon itself, and collapsing into a tiny speck that disappeared to nothing. Langdonblinked in pain, slowly recovering his eyesight. He squinted into the smolderingchamber. The canister on the floor had entirely disappeared. Vaporized. Not atrace.He stared in wonder. “G… God.”Vittoria nodded sadly. “That’s precisely what my father said.”"},{"pageContent":"23Kohler was staring into the annihilation chamber with a look of utter amazementat the spectacle he had just seen. Robert Langdon was beside him, looking evenmore dazed.“I want to see my father,” Vittoria demanded. “I showed you the lab. Now I wantto see my father.”Kohler turned slowly, apparently not hearing her. “Why did you wait so long,Vittoria? You and your father should have told me about this discoveryimmediately.”Vittoria stared at him. How many reasons do you want? “Director, we can argueabout this later. Right now, I want to see my father.”“Do you know what this technology implies?”“Sure,” Vittoria shot back. “Revenue for CERN. A lot of it. Now I want-”“Is that why you kept it secret?” Kohler demanded, clearly baiting her. “Becauseyou feared the board and I would vote to license it out?”“It should be licensed,” Vittoria fired back, feeling herself dragged into theargument. “Antimatter is important technology. But it’s also dangerous. Myfather and I wanted time to refine the procedures and make it safe.”“In other words, you didn’t trust the board of directors to place prudentscience before financial greed.”Vittoria was surprised with the indifference in Kohler’s tone. “There were otherissues as well,” she said. “My father wanted time to present antimatter in theappropriate light.”“Meaning?”What do you think I mean? “Matter from energy? Something from nothing? It’spractically proof that Genesis is a scientific possibility.”“So he didn’t want the religious implications of his discovery lost in anonslaught of commercialism?”“In a manner of speaking.”“And you?”Vittoria’s concerns, ironically, were somewhat the opposite. Commercialism wascritical for the success of any new energy source. Although antimattertechnology had staggering potential as an efficient and nonpolluting energysource-if unveiled prematurely, antimatter ran the risk of being vilified by thepolitics and PR fiascoes that had killed nuclear and solar power. Nuclear hadproliferated before it was safe, and there were accidents. Solar hadproliferated before it was efficient, and people lost money. Both technologiesgot bad reputations and withered on the vine.“My interests,” Vittoria said, “were a bit less lofty than uniting science andreligion.”“The environment,” Kohler ventured assuredly.“Limitless energy. No strip mining. No pollution. No radiation. Antimattertechnology could save the planet.”“Or destroy it,” Kohler quipped. “Depending on who uses it for what.” Vittoriafelt a chill emanating from Kohler’s crippled form. “Who else knew about this?”he asked.“No one,” Vittoria said. “I told you that.”“Then why do you think your father was killed?”Vittoria’s muscles tightened. “I have no idea. He had enemies here at CERN, youknow that, but it couldn’t have had anything to do with antimatter. We swore toeach other to keep it between us for another few months, until we were ready.”“And you’re certain your father kept his vow of silence?”Now Vittoria was getting mad. “My father has kept tougher vows than that!”“And you told no one?”“Of course not!”Kohler exhaled. He paused, as though choosing his next words carefully. “Supposesomeone did find out. And suppose someone gained access to this lab. What do youimagine they would be after? Did your father have notes down here? Documentationof his processes?”“Director, I’ve been patient. I need some answers now. You keep talking about abreak-in, but you saw the retina scan. My father has been vigilant about secrecyand security.”“Humor me,” Kohler snapped, startling her. “What would be missing?”“I have no idea.” Vittoria angrily scanned the lab. All the antimatter specimenswere accounted for. Her father’s work area looked in order. “Nobody came inhere,” she declared. “Everything up here looks fine.”Kohler looked surprised. “Up here?”Vittoria had said it instinctively. “Yes, here in the upper lab.”“You’re using the lower lab too?”“For storage.”Kohler rolled toward her, coughing again. “You’re using the Haz-Mat chamber forstorage? Storage of what?”Hazardous material, what else! Vittoria was losing her patience. “Antimatter.”Kohler lifted himself on the arms of his chair. “There are other specimens? Whythe hell didn’t you tell me!”“I just did,” Vittoria fired back. “And you’ve barely given me a chance!”“We need to check those specimens,” Kohler said. “Now.”“Specimen,” Vittoria corrected. “Singular. And it’s fine. Nobody could ever-”“Only one?” Kohler hesitated. “Why isn’t it up here?”“My father wanted it below the bedrock as a precaution. It’s larger than theothers.”The look of alarm that shot between Kohler and Langdon was not lost on Vittoria.Kohler rolled toward her again. “You created a specimen larger than five hundrednanograms?”“A necessity,” Vittoria defended. “We had to prove the input/yield thresholdcould be safely crossed.” The question with new fuel sources, she knew, wasalways one of input vs. yield-how much money one had to expend to harvest thefuel. Building an oil rig to yield a single barrel of oil was a losing endeavor.However, if that same rig, with minimal added expense, could deliver millions ofbarrels, then you were in business. Antimatter was the same way. Firing upsixteen miles of electromagnets to create a tiny specimen of antimatter expendedmore energy than the resulting antimatter contained. In order to proveantimatter efficient and viable, one had to create specimens of a largermagnitude.Although Vittoria’s father had been hesitant to create a large specimen,Vittoria had pushed him hard. She argued that in order for antimatter to betaken seriously, she and her father had to prove two things. First, thatcost-effective amounts could be produced. And second, that the specimens couldbe safely stored. In the end she had won, and her father had acquiesced againsthis better judgment. Not, however, without some firm guidelines regardingsecrecy and access. The antimatter, her father had insisted, would be stored inHaz-Mat-a small granite hollow, an additional seventy-five feet below ground.The specimen would be their secret. And only the two of them would have access.“Vittoria?” Kohler insisted, his voice tense. “How large a specimen did you andyour father create?”Vittoria felt a wry pleasure inside. She knew the amount would stun even thegreat Maximilian Kohler. She pictured the antimatter below. An incredible sight.Suspended inside the trap, perfectly visible to the naked eye, danced a tinysphere of antimatter. This was no microscopic speck. This was a droplet the sizeof a BB.Vittoria took a deep breath. “A full quarter of a gram.”The blood drained from Kohler’s face. “What!” He broke into a fit of coughing.“A quarter of a gram? That converts to… almost five kilotons!”Kilotons. Vittoria hated the word. It was one she and her father never used. Akiloton was equal to 1,000 metric tons of TNT. Kilotons were for weaponry.Payload. Destructive power. She and her father spoke in electron volts andjoules-constructive energy output.“That much antimatter could literally liquidate everything in a half-mileradius!” Kohler exclaimed.“Yes, if annihilated all at once,” Vittoria shot back, “which nobody would everdo!”“Except someone who didn’t know better. Or if your power source failed!” Kohlerwas already heading for the elevator.“Which is why my father kept it in Haz-Mat under a fail-safe power and aredundant security system.”Kohler turned, looking hopeful. “You have additional security on Haz-Mat?”“Yes. A second retina-scan.”Kohler spoke only two words. “Downstairs. Now.”The freight elevator dropped like a rock.Another seventy-five feet into the earth.Vittoria was certain she sensed fear in both men as the elevator fell deeper.Kohler’s usually emotionless face was taut. I know, Vittoria thought, the sampleis enormous, but the precautions we’ve taken are-They reached the bottom.The elevator opened, and Vittoria led the way down the dimly lit corridor. Upahead the corridor dead-ended at a huge steel door. HAZ-MAT. The retina scandevice beside the door was identical to the one upstairs. She approached.Carefully, she aligned her eye with the lens.She pulled back. Something was wrong. The usually spotless lens was spattered…smeared with something that looked like… blood? Confused she turned to the twomen, but her gaze met waxen faces. Both Kohler and Langdon were white, theireyes fixed on the floor at her feet.Vittoria followed their line of sight… down.“No!” Langdon yelled, reaching for her. But it was too late.Vittoria’s vision locked on the object on the floor. It was both utterly foreignand intimately familiar to her.It took only an instant.Then, with a reeling horror, she knew. Staring up at her from the floor,discarded like a piece of trash, was an eyeball. She would have recognized thatshade of hazel anywhere."},{"pageContent":"24The security technician held his breath as his commander leaned over hisshoulder, studying the bank of security monitors before them. A minute passed.The commander’s silence was to be expected, the technician told himself. Thecommander was a man of rigid protocol. He had not risen to command one of theworld’s most elite security forces by talking first and thinking second.But what is he thinking?The object they were pondering on the monitor was a canister of some sort-acanister with transparent sides. That much was easy. It was the rest that wasdifficult.Inside the container, as if by some special effect, a small droplet of metallicliquid seemed to be floating in midair. The droplet appeared and disappeared inthe robotic red blinking of a digital LED descending resolutely, making thetechnician’s skin crawl.“Can you lighten the contrast?” the commander asked, startling the technician.The technician heeded the instruction, and the image lightened somewhat. Thecommander leaned forward, squinting closer at something that had just comevisible on the base of the container.The technician followed his commander’s gaze.

She sensedthe American rushing to help her, holding her, supporting her weight. On thefloor at her feet, her father’s eyeball stared up. She felt the air crushed fromher lungs. They cut out his eye! Her world twisted. Kohler pressed close behind,speaking. Langdon guided her. As if in a dream, she found herself gazing intothe retina scan. The mechanism beeped.The door slid open.Even with the terror of her father’s eye boring into her soul, Vittoria sensedan additional horror awaited inside. When she leveled her blurry gaze into theroom, she confirmed the next chapter of the nightmare. Before her, the solitaryrecharging podium was empty.The canister was gone. They had cut out her father’s eye to steal it. Theimplications came too fast for her to fully comprehend. Everything hadbackfired. The specimen that was supposed to prove antimatter was a safe andviable energy source had been stolen. But nobody knew this specimen evenexisted! The truth, however, was undeniable. Someone had found out. Vittoriacould not imagine who. Even Kohler, whom they said knew everything at CERN,clearly had no idea about the project.Her father was dead. Murdered for his genius.As the grief strafed her heart, a new emotion surged into Vittoria’s conscious.This one was far worse. Crushing. Stabbing at her. The emotion was guilt.Uncontrollable, relentless guilt. Vittoria knew it had been she who convincedher father to create the specimen. Against his better judgment. And he had beenkilled for it.A quarter of a gram…Like any technology-fire, gunpowder, the combustion engine-in the wrong hands,antimatter could be deadly. Very deadly. Antimatter was a lethal weapon. Potent,and unstoppable. Once removed from its recharging platform at CERN, the canisterwould count down inexorably. A runaway train.And when time ran out…A blinding light. The roar of thunder. Spontaneous incineration. Just the flash…and an empty crater. A big empty crater.The image of her father’s quiet genius being used as a tool of destruction waslike poison in her blood. Antimatter was the ultimate terrorist weapon. It hadno metallic parts to trip metal detectors, no chemical signature for dogs totrace, no fuse to deactivate if the authorities located the canister. Thecountdown had begun…Langdon didn’t know what else to do. He took his handkerchief and lay it on thefloor over Leonardo Vetra’s eyeball. Vittoria was standing now in the doorway ofthe empty Haz-Mat chamber, her expression wrought with grief and panic. Langdonmoved toward her again, instinctively, but Kohler intervened.“Mr. Langdon?” Kohler’s face was expressionless. He motioned Langdon out ofearshot. Langdon reluctantly followed, leaving Vittoria to fend for herself.“You’re the specialist,” Kohler said, his whisper intense. “I want to know whatthese Illuminati bastards intend to do with this antimatter.”Langdon tried to focus. Despite the madness around him, his first reaction waslogical. Academic rejection. Kohler was still making assumptions. Impossibleassumptions. “The Illuminati are defunct, Mr. Kohler. I stand by that. Thiscrime could be anything-maybe even another CERN employee who found out about Mr.Vetra’s breakthrough and thought the project was too dangerous to continue.”Kohler looked stunned. “You think this is a crime of conscience, Mr. Langdon?Absurd. Whoever killed Leonardo wanted one thing-the antimatter specimen. And nodoubt they have plans for it.”“You mean terrorism.”“Plainly.”“But the Illuminati were not terrorists.”“Tell that to Leonardo Vetra.”Langdon felt a pang of truth in the statement. Leonardo Vetra had indeed beenbranded with the Illuminati symbol. Where had it come from? The sacred brandseemed too difficult a hoax for someone trying to cover his tracks by castingsuspicion elsewhere. There had to be another explanation.Again, Langdon forced himself to consider the implausible. If the Illuminatiwere still active, and if they stole the antimatter, what would be theirintention? What would be their target? The answer furnished by his brain wasinstantaneous. Langdon dismissed it just as fast. True, the Illuminati had anobvious enemy, but a wide-scale terrorist attack against that enemy wasinconceivable. It was entirely out of character. Yes, the Illuminati had killedpeople, but individuals, carefully conscripted targets. Mass destruction wassomehow heavy-handed. Langdon paused. Then again, he thought, there would be arather majestic eloquence to it-antimatter, the ultimate scientific achievement,being used to vaporize-He refused to accept the preposterous thought. “There is,” he said suddenly, “alogical explanation other than terrorism.”Kohler stared, obviously waiting.Langdon tried to sort out the thought. The Illuminati had always wieldedtremendous power through financial means. They controlled banks. They owned goldbullion. They were even rumored to possess the single most valuable gem onearth-the Illuminati Diamond, a flawless diamond of enormous proportions.“Money,” Langdon said. “The antimatter could have been stolen for financialgain.”Kohler looked incredulous. “Financial gain? Where does one sell a droplet ofantimatter?”“Not the specimen,” Langdon countered. “The technology. Antimatter technologymust be worth a mint. Maybe someone stole the specimen to do analysis and R andD.”“Industrial espionage? But that canister has twenty-four hours before thebatteries die. The researchers would blow themselves up before they learnedanything at all.”“They could recharge it before it explodes. They could build a compatiblerecharging podium like the ones here at CERN.”“In twenty-four hours?” Kohler challenged. “Even if they stole the schematics, arecharger like that would take months to engineer, not hours!”“He’s right.” Vittoria’s voice was frail.Both men turned. Vittoria was moving toward them, her gait as tremulous as herwords.“He’s right. Nobody could reverse engineer a recharger in time. The interfacealone would take weeks. Flux filters, servo-coils, power conditioning alloys,all calibrated to the specific energy grade of the locale.”Langdon frowned. The point was taken. An antimatter trap was not something onecould simply plug into a wall socket. Once removed from CERN, the canister wason a one-way, twenty-four-hour trip to oblivion.Which left only one, very disturbing, conclusion.“We need to call Interpol,” Vittoria said. Even to herself, her voice soundeddistant. “We need to call the proper authorities. Immediately.”Kohler shook his head. “Absolutely not.”The words stunned her. “No? What do you mean?”“You and your father have put me in a very difficult position here.”“Director, we need help. We need to find that trap and get it back here beforesomeone gets hurt. We have a responsibility!”“We have a responsibility to think,” Kohler said, his tone hardening. “Thissituation could have very, very serious repercussions for CERN.”“You’re worried about CERN’s reputation? Do you know what that canister could doto an urban area? It has a blast radius of a half mile! Nine city blocks!”“Perhaps you and your father should have considered that before you created thespecimen.”Vittoria felt like she’d been stabbed. “But… we took every precaution.”“Apparently, it was not enough.”“But nobody knew about the antimatter.” She realized, of course, it was anabsurd argument. Of course somebody knew. Someone had found out.Vittoria had told no one. That left only two explanations. Either her father hadtaken someone into his confidence without telling her, which made no sensebecause it was her father who had sworn them both to secrecy, or she and herfather had been monitored. The cell phone maybe? She knew they had spoken a fewtimes while Vittoria was traveling. Had they said too much? It was possible.There was also their E-mail. But they had been discreet, hadn’t they? CERN’ssecurity system? Had they been monitored somehow without their knowledge? Sheknew none of that mattered anymore. What was done, was done. My father is dead.The thought spurred her to action. She pulled her cell phone from her shortspocket.Kohler accelerated toward her, coughing violently, eyes flashing anger. “Who…are you calling?”“CERN’s switchboard. They can connect us to Interpol.”“Think!” Kohler choked, screeching to a halt in front of her. “Are you really sonaпve? That canister could be anywhere in the world by now. No intelligenceagency on earth could possibly mobilize to find it in time.”“So we do nothing?” Vittoria felt compunction challenging a man in such frailhealth, but the director was so far out of line she didn’t even know himanymore.“We do what is smart,” Kohler said. “We don’t risk CERN’s reputation byinvolving authorities who cannot help anyway. Not yet. Not without thinking.”Vittoria knew there was logic somewhere in Kohler’s argument, but she also knewthat logic, by definition, was bereft of moral responsibility. Her father hadlived for moral responsibility-careful science, accountability, faith in man’sinherent goodness. Vittoria believed in those things too, but she saw them interms of karma. Turning away from Kohler, she snapped open her phone.“You can’t do that,” he said.“Just try and stop me.”Kohler did not move.An instant later, Vittoria realized why. This far underground, her cell phonehad no dial tone.Fuming, she headed for the elevator."},{"pageContent":"26The Hassassin stood at the end of the stone tunnel. His torch still burnedbright, the smoke mixing with the smell of moss and stale air. Silencesurrounded him.

He would have waited all night at that door to carryout his task, but he sensed it would not be necessary. He was working fordetermined men.Minutes later, exactly at the appointed hour, there was a loud clank of heavykeys on the other side of the door. Metal scraped on metal as multiple locksdisengaged. One by one, three huge deadbolts ground open. The locks creaked asif they had not been used in centuries. Finally all three were open.Then there was silence.The Hassassin waited patiently, five minutes, exactly as he had been told. Then,with electricity in his blood, he pushed. The great door swung open."},{"pageContent":"27Vittoria, I will not allow it!“ Kohler’s breath was labored and getting worse asthe Haz-Mat elevator ascended.Vittoria blocked him out. She craved sanctuary, something familiar in this placethat no longer felt like home. She knew it was not to be. Right now, she had toswallow the pain and act. Get to a phone.Robert Langdon was beside her, silent as usual. Vittoria had given up wonderingwho the man was. A specialist? Could Kohler be any less specific? Mr. Langdoncan help us find your father’s killer. Langdon was being no help at all. Hiswarmth and kindness seemed genuine, but he was clearly hiding something. Theyboth were.Kohler was at her again. “As director of CERN, I have a responsibility to thefuture of science. If you amplify this into an international incident and CERNsuffers-”“Future of science?” Vittoria turned on him. “Do you really plan to escapeaccountability by never admitting this antimatter came from CERN? Do you plan toignore the people’s lives we’ve put in danger?”“Not we,” Kohler countered. “You. You and your father.”Vittoria looked away.“And as far as endangering lives,” Kohler said, “life is exactly what this isabout. You know antimatter technology has enormous implications for life on thisplanet. If CERN goes bankrupt, destroyed by scandal, everybody loses. Man’sfuture is in the hands of places like CERN, scientists like you and your father,working to solve tomorrow’s problems.”Vittoria had heard Kohler’s Science-as-God lecture before, and she never boughtit. Science itself caused half the problems it was trying to solve. “Progress”was Mother Earth’s ultimate malignancy.“Scientific advancement carries risk,” Kohler argued. “It always has. Spaceprograms, genetic research, medicine-they all make mistakes. Science needs tosurvive its own blunders, at any cost. For everyone‘s sake.”Vittoria was amazed at Kohler’s ability to weigh moral issues with scientificdetachment. His intellect seemed to be the product of an icy divorce from hisinner spirit. “You think CERN is so critical to the earth’s future that weshould be immune from moral responsibility?”“Do not argue morals with me. You crossed a line when you made that specimen,and you have put this entire facility at risk. I’m trying to protect not onlythe jobs of the three thousand scientists who work here, but also your father’sreputation. Think about him. A man like your father does not deserve to beremembered as the creator of a weapon of mass destruction.”Vittoria felt his spear hit home. I am the one who convinced my father to createthat specimen. This is my fault!When the door opened, Kohler was still talking. Vittoria stepped out of theelevator, pulled out her phone, and tried again.Still no dial tone. Damn! She headed for the door.“Vittoria, stop.” The director sounded asthmatic now, as he accelerated afterher. “Slow down. We need to talk.”“Basta di parlare!”“Think of your father,” Kohler urged. “What would he do?”She kept going.“Vittoria, I haven’t been totally honest with you.”Vittoria felt her legs slow.“I don’t know what I was thinking,” Kohler said. “I was just trying to protectyou. Just tell me what you want. We need to work together here.”Vittoria came to a full stop halfway across the lab, but she did not turn. “Iwant to find the antimatter. And I want to know who killed my father.” Shewaited.Kohler sighed. “Vittoria, we already know who killed your father. I’m sorry.”Now Vittoria turned. “You what?”“I didn’t know how to tell you. It’s a difficult-”“You know who killed my father?”“We have a very good idea, yes. The killer left somewhat of a calling card.That’s the reason I called Mr. Langdon. The group claiming responsibility is hisspecialty.”“The group? A terrorist group?”“Vittoria, they stole a quarter gram of antimatter.”Vittoria looked at Robert Langdon standing there across the room. Everythingbegan falling into place. That explains some of the secrecy. She was amazed ithadn’t occurred to her earlier. Kohler had called the authorities after all. Theauthorities. Now it seemed obvious. Robert Langdon was American, clean-cut,conservative, obviously very sharp. Who else could it be? Vittoria should haveguessed from the start. She felt a newfound hope as she turned to him.“Mr. Langdon, I want to know who killed my father. And I want to know if youragency can find the antimatter.”Langdon looked flustered. “My agency?”“You’re with U.S. Intelligence, I assume.”“Actually… no.”Kohler intervened. “Mr. Langdon is a professor of art history at HarvardUniversity.”Vittoria felt like she had been doused with ice water. “An art teacher?”“He is a specialist in cult symbology.” Kohler sighed. “Vittoria, we believeyour father was killed by a satanic cult.”Vittoria heard the words in her mind, but she was unable to process them. Asatanic cult.“The group claiming responsibility calls themselves the Illuminati.”Vittoria looked at Kohler and then at Langdon, wondering if this was some kindof perverse joke. “The Illuminati?” she demanded. “As in the BavarianIlluminati?”Kohler looked stunned. “You’ve heard of them?”Vittoria felt the tears of frustration welling right below the surface.“Bavarian Illuminati: New World Order. Steve Jackson computer games. Half thetechies here play it on the Internet.” Her voice cracked. “But I don’tunderstand…”Kohler shot Langdon a confused look.Langdon nodded. “Popular game. Ancient brotherhood takes over the world.Semihistorical. I didn’t know it was in Europe too.”Vittoria was bewildered. “What are you talking about? The Illuminati? It’s acomputer game!”“Vittoria,” Kohler said, “the Illuminati is the group claiming responsibilityfor your father’s death.”Vittoria mustered every bit of courage she could find to fight the tears. Sheforced herself to hold on and assess the situation logically. But the harder shefocused, the less she understood. Her father had been murdered. CERN hadsuffered a major breach of security. There was a bomb counting down somewherethat she was responsible for. And the director had nominated an art teacher tohelp them find a mythical fraternity of Satanists.Vittoria felt suddenly all alone. She turned to go, but Kohler cut her off. Hereached for something in his pocket. He produced a crumpled piece of fax paperand handed it to her.Vittoria swayed in horror as her eyes hit the image.“They branded him,” Kohler said. “They branded his goddamn chest.”"},{"pageContent":"28Secretary Sylvie Baudeloque was now in a panic. She paced outside the director’sempty office. Where the hell is he? What do I do?It had been a bizarre day. Of course, any day working for Maximilian Kohler hadthe potential to be strange, but Kohler had been in rare form today.“Find me Leonardo Vetra!” he had demanded when Sylvie arrived this morning.Dutifully, Sylvie paged, phoned, and E-mailed Leonardo Vetra.Nothing.So Kohler had left in a huff, apparently to go find Vetra himself. When herolled back in a few hours later, Kohler looked decidedly not well… not that heever actually looked well, but he looked worse than usual. He locked himself inhis office, and she could hear him on his modem, his phone, faxing, talking.Then Kohler rolled out again. He hadn’t been back since.Sylvie had decided to ignore the antics as yet another Kohlerian melodrama, butshe began to get concerned when Kohler failed to return at the proper time forhis daily injections; the director’s physical condition required regulartreatment, and when he decided to push his luck, the results were neverpretty-respiratory shock, coughing fits, and a mad dash by the infirmarypersonnel. Sometimes Sylvie thought Maximilian Kohler had a death wish.She considered paging him to remind him, but she’d learned charity was somethingKohlers’s pride despised. Last week, he had become so enraged with a visitingscientist who had shown him undue pity that Kohler clambered to his feet andthrew a clipboard at the man’s head. King Kohler could be surprisingly agilewhen he was pissй.At the moment, however, Sylvie’s concern for the director’s health was taking aback burner… replaced by a much more pressing dilemma. The CERN switchboard hadphoned five minutes ago in a frenzy to say they had an urgent call for thedirector.“He’s not available,” Sylvie had said.Then the CERN operator told her who was calling.Sylvie half laughed aloud. “You’re kidding, right?” She listened, and her faceclouded with disbelief. “And your caller ID confirms-” Sylvie was frowning. “Isee. Okay. Can you ask what the-” She sighed. “No. That’s fine. Tell him tohold. I’ll locate the director right away. Yes, I understand. I’ll hurry.”But Sylvie had not been able to find the director. She had called his cell linethree times and each time gotten the same message: “The mobile customer you aretrying to reach is out of range.” Out of range? How far could he go? So Sylviehad dialed Kohler’s beeper. Twice. No response. Most unlike him. She’d evenE-mailed his mobile computer. Nothing. It was like the man had disappeared offthe face of the earth.So what do I do? she now wondered.Short of searching CERN’s entire complex herself, Sylvie knew there was only oneother way to get the director’s attention. He would not be pleased, but the manon the phone was not someone the director should keep waiting. Nor did it soundlike the caller was in any mood to be told the director was unavailable.Startled with her own boldness, Sylvie made her decision. She walked intoKohler’s office and went to the metal box on his wall behind his desk. Sheopened the cover, stared at the controls, and found the correct button.Then she took a deep breath and grabbed the microphone."},{"pageContent":"29Vittoria did not remember how they had gotten to the main elevator, but theywere there. Ascending. Kohler was behind her, his breathing labored now.Langdon’s concerned gaze passed through her like a ghost. He had taken the faxfrom her hand and slipped it in his jacket pocket away from her sight, but theimage was still burned into her memory.As the elevator climbed, Vittoria’s world swirled into darkness. Papa! In hermind she reached for him. For just a moment, in the oasis of her memory,Vittoria was with him. She was nine years old, rolling down hills of edelweissflowers, the Swiss sky spinning overhead.Papa! Papa!Leonardo Vetra was laughing beside her, beaming. “What is it, angel?”“Papa!” she giggled, nuzzling close to him. “Ask me what’s the matter!”“But you look happy, sweetie. Why would I ask you what’s the matter?”“Just ask me.”He shrugged. “What’s the matter?”She immediately started laughing. “What’s the matter? Everything is the matter!Rocks! Trees! Atoms! Even anteaters! Everything is the matter!”He laughed. “Did you make that up?”“Pretty smart, huh?”“My little Einstein.”She frowned. “He has stupid hair. I saw his picture.”“He’s got a smart head, though. I told you what he proved, right?”Her eyes widened with dread. “Dad! No! You promised!”“E=MC2!” He tickled her playfully. “E=MC2!”“No math! I told you! I hate it!”“I’m glad you hate it. Because girls aren’t even allowed to do math.”Vittoria stopped short. “They aren’t?”“Of course not. Everyone knows that. Girls play with dollies. Boys do math. Nomath for girls. I’m not even permitted to talk to little girls about math.”“What! But that’s not fair!”“Rules are rules. Absolutely no math for little girls.”Vittoria looked horrified. “But dolls are boring!”“I’m sorry,” her father said. “I could tell you about math, but if I gotcaught…” He looked nervously around the deserted hills.Vittoria followed his gaze. “Okay,” she whispered, “just tell me quietly.”The motion of the elevator startled her. Vittoria opened her eyes. He was gone.Reality rushed in, wrapping a frosty grip around her. She looked to Langdon. Theearnest concern in his gaze felt like the warmth of a guardian angel, especiallyin the aura of Kohler’s chill.A single sentient thought began pounding at Vittoria with unrelenting force.Where is the antimatter?The horrifying answer was only a moment away."},{"pageContent":"30Maximilian Kohler. Kindly call your office immediately.“Blazing sunbeams flooded Langdon’s eyes as the elevator doors opened into themain atrium. Before the echo of the announcement on the intercom overhead faded,every electronic device on Kohler’s wheelchair started beeping and buzzingsimultaneously. His pager. His phone. His E-mail. Kohler glanced down at theblinking lights in apparent bewilderment. The director had resurfaced, and hewas back in range.“Director Kohler. Please call your office.”The sound of his name on the PA seemed to startle Kohler.He glanced up, looking angered and then almost immediately concerned. Langdon’seyes met his, and Vittoria’s too. The three of them were motionless a moment, asif all the tension between them had been erased and replaced by a single,unifying foreboding.Kohler took his cell phone from the armrest. He dialed an extension and foughtoff another coughing fit. Vittoria and Langdon waited.“This is… Director Kohler,” he said, wheezing. “Yes? I was subterranean, out ofrange.” He listened, his gray eyes widening. “Who? Yes, patch it through.” Therewas a pause. “Hello? This is Maximilian Kohler. I am the director of CERN. Withwhom am I speaking?”Vittoria and Langdon watched in silence as Kohler listened.“It would be unwise,” Kohler finally said, “to speak of this by phone. I will bethere immediately.” He was coughing again. “Meet me… at Leonardo da VinciAirport. Forty minutes.” Kohler’s breath seemed to be failing him now. Hedescended into a fit of coughing and barely managed to choke out the words,“Locate the canister immediately… I am coming.” Then he clicked off his phone.Vittoria ran to Kohler’s side, but Kohler could no longer speak. Langdon watchedas Vittoria pulled out her cell phone and paged CERN’s infirmary. Langdon feltlike a ship on the periphery of a storm… tossed but detached.Meet me at Leonardo da Vinci Airport. Kohler’s words echoed.The uncertain shadows that had fogged Langdon’s mind all morning, in a singleinstant, solidified into a vivid image. As he stood there in the swirl ofconfusion, he felt a door inside him open… as if some mystic threshold had justbeen breached. The ambigram. The murdered priest/scientist. The antimatter. Andnow… the target. Leonardo da Vinci Airport could only mean one thing. In amoment of stark realization, Langdon knew he had just crossed over. He hadbecome a believer.Five kilotons. Let there be light.Two paramedics materialized, racing across the atrium in white smocks. Theyknelt by Kohler, putting an oxygen mask on his face. Scientists in the hallstopped and stood back.Kohler took two long pulls, pushed the mask aside, and still gasping for air,looked up at Vittoria and Langdon. “Rome.”“Rome?” Vittoria demanded. “The antimatter is in Rome? Who called?”Kohler’s face was twisted, his gray eyes watering. “The Swiss…” He choked on thewords, and the paramedics put the mask back over his face. As they prepared totake him away, Kohler reached up and grabbed Langdon’s arm.Langdon nodded. He knew.“Go…” Kohler wheezed beneath his mask. “Go… call me…” Then the paramedics wererolling him away.Vittoria stood riveted to the floor, watching him go. Then she turned toLangdon. “Rome? But… what was that about the Swiss?”Langdon put a hand on her shoulder, barely whispering the words. “The SwissGuard,” he said. “The sworn sentinels of Vatican City.”"},{"pageContent":"31The X-33 space plane roared into the sky and arched south toward Rome. On board,Langdon sat in silence. The last fifteen minutes had been a blur. Now that hehad finished briefing Vittoria on the Illuminati and their covenant against theVatican, the scope of this situation was starting to sink in.What the hell am I doing? Langdon wondered. I should have gone home when I hadthe chance! Deep down, though, he knew he’d never had the chance.Langdon’s better judgment had screamed at him to return to Boston. Nonetheless,academic astonishment had somehow vetoed prudence. Everything he had everbelieved about the demise of the Illuminati was suddenly looking like abrilliant sham. Part of him craved proof. Confirmation. There was also aquestion of conscience. With Kohler ailing and Vittoria on her own, Langdon knewthat if his knowledge of the Illuminati could assist in any way, he had a moralobligation to be here.There was more, though. Although Langdon was ashamed to admit it, his initialhorror on hearing about the antimatter’s location was not only the danger tohuman life in Vatican City, but for something else as well.Art.The world’s largest art collection was now sitting on a time bomb. The VaticanMuseum housed over 60,000 priceless pieces in 1,407 rooms-Michelangelo, daVinci, Bernini, Botticelli. Langdon wondered if all of the art could possibly beevacuated if necessary. He knew it was impossible. Many of the pieces weresculptures weighing tons. Not to mention, the greatest treasures werearchitectural-the Sistine Chapel, St. Peter’s Basilica, Michelangelo’s famedspiral staircase leading to the Musиo Vaticano-priceless testaments to man’screative genius. Langdon wondered how much time was left on the canister.“Thanks for coming,” Vittoria said, her voice quiet.Langdon emerged from his daydream and looked up. Vittoria was sitting across theaisle. Even in the stark fluorescent light of the cabin, there was an aura ofcomposure about her-an almost magnetic radiance of wholeness. Her breathingseemed deeper now, as if a spark of self-preservation had ignited within her… acraving for justice and retribution, fueled by a daughter’s love.Vittoria had not had time to change from her shorts and sleeveless top, and hertawny legs were now goose-bumped in the cold of the plane. Instinctively Langdonremoved his jacket and offered it to her.“American chivalry?” She accepted, her eyes thanking him silently.The plane jostled across some turbulence, and Langdon felt a surge of danger.The windowless cabin felt cramped again, and he tried to imagine himself in anopen field. The notion, he realized, was ironic. He had been in an open fieldwhen it had happened. Crushing darkness. He pushed the memory from his mind.Ancient history.Vittoria was watching him. “Do you believe in God, Mr. Langdon?”The question startled him. The earnestness in Vittoria’s voice was even moredisarming than the inquiry. Do I believe in God? He had hoped for a lightertopic of conversation to pass the trip.A spiritual conundrum, Langdon thought. That’s what my friends call me. Althoughhe studied religion for years, Langdon was not a religious man. He respected thepower of faith, the benevolence of churches, the strength religion gave so manypeople… and yet, for him, the intellectual suspension of disbelief that wasimperative if one were truly going to “believe” had always proved too big anobstacle for his academic mind. “I want to believe,” he heard himself say.Vittoria’s reply carried no judgment or challenge. “So why don’t you?”He chuckled. “Well, it’s not that easy. Having faith requires leaps of faith,cerebral acceptance of miracles-immaculate conceptions and divine interventions.And then there are the codes of conduct. The Bible, the Koran, Buddhistscripture… they all carry similar requirements-and similar penalties. They claimthat if I don’t live by a specific code I will go to hell. I can’t imagine a Godwho would rule that way.”“I hope you don’t let your students dodge questions that shamelessly.”The comment caught him off guard. “What?”“Mr. Langdon, I did not ask if you believe what man says about God. I asked ifyou believed in God. There is a difference. Holy scripture is stories… legendsand history of man’s quest to understand his own need for meaning. I am notasking you to pass judgment on literature. I am asking if you believe in God.When you lie out under the stars, do you sense the divine? Do you feel in yourgut that you are staring up at the work of God’s hand?”Langdon took a long moment to consider it.“I’m prying,” Vittoria apologized.“No, I just…”“Certainly you must debate issues of faith with your classes.”“Endlessly.”“And you play devil’s advocate, I imagine. Always fueling the debate.”Langdon smiled. “You must be a teacher too.”“No, but I learned from a master. My father could argue two sides of a MцbiusStrip.”Langdon laughed, picturing the artful crafting of a Mцbius Strip-a twisted ringof paper, which technically possessed only one side. Langdon had first seen thesingle-sided shape in the artwork of M. C. Escher. “May I ask you a question,Ms. Vetra?”“Call me Vittoria. Ms. Vetra makes me feel old.”He sighed inwardly, suddenly sensing his own age. “Vittoria, I’m Robert.”“You had a question.”“Yes. As a scientist and the daughter of a Catholic priest, what do you think ofreligion?”Vittoria paused, brushing a lock of hair from her eyes. “Religion is likelanguage or dress. We gravitate toward the practices with which we were raised.In the end, though, we are all proclaiming the same thing. That life hasmeaning. That we are grateful for the power that created us.”Langdon was intrigued. “So you’re saying that whether you are a Christian or aMuslim simply depends on where you were born?”“Isn’t it obvious? Look at the diffusion of religion around the globe.”“So faith is random?”“Hardly. Faith is universal. Our specific methods for understanding it arearbitrary. Some of us pray to Jesus, some of us go to Mecca, some of us studysubatomic particles. In the end we are all just searching for truth, that whichis greater than ourselves.”Langdon wished his students could express themselves so clearly. Hell, he wishedhe could express himself so clearly. “And God?” he asked. “Do you believe inGod?”Vittoria was silent for a long time. “Science tells me God must exist. My mindtells me I will never understand God. And my heart tells me I am not meant to.”How’s that for concise, he thought. “So you believe God is fact, but we willnever understand Him.”“Her,” she said with a smile. “Your Native Americans had it right.”Langdon chuckled. “Mother Earth.”“Gaea. The planet is an organism. All of us are cells with different purposes.And yet we are intertwined. Serving each other. Serving the whole.”Looking at her, Langdon felt something stir within him that he had not felt in along time. There was a bewitching clarity in her eyes… a purity in her voice. Hefelt drawn.“Mr. Langdon, let me ask you another question.”“Robert,” he said. Mr. Langdon makes me feel old. I am old!“If you don’t mind my asking, Robert, how did you get involved with theIlluminati?”Langdon thought back. “Actually, it was money.”Vittoria looked disappointed. “Money? Consulting, you mean?”Langdon laughed, realizing how it must have sounded. “No. Money as in currency.”He reached in his pants pocket and pulled out some money. He found a one-dollarbill. “I became fascinated with the cult when I first learned that U.S. currencyis covered with Illuminati symbology.”Vittoria’s eyes narrowed, apparently not knowing whether or not to take himseriously.Langdon handed her the bill. “Look at the back. See the Great Seal on the left?”Vittoria turned the one-dollar bill over. “You mean the pyramid?”“The pyramid. Do you know what pyramids have to do with U.S. history?”Vittoria shrugged.“Exactly,” Langdon said. “Absolutely nothing.”Vittoria frowned. “So why is it the central symbol of your Great Seal?”“An eerie bit of history,” Langdon said. “The pyramid is an occult symbolrepresenting a convergence upward, toward the ultimate source of Illumination.See what’s above it?”Vittoria studied the bill. “An eye inside a triangle.”“It’s called the trinacria. Have you ever seen that eye in a triangle anywhereelse?”Vittoria was silent a moment. “Actually, yes, but I’m not sure…”“It’s emblazoned on Masonic lodges around the world.”“The symbol is Masonic?”“Actually, no. It’s Illuminati. They called it their ‘shining delta.’ A call forenlightened change. The eye signifies the Illuminati’s ability to infiltrate andwatch all things. The shining triangle represents enlightenment. And thetriangle is also the Greek letter delta, which is the mathematical symbol for-”“Change. Transition.”Langdon smiled. “I forgot I was talking to a scientist.”“So you’re saying the U.S. Great Seal is a call for enlightened, all-seeingchange?”“Some would call it a New World Order.”Vittoria seemed startled. She glanced down at the bill again. “The writing underthe pyramid says Novus… Ordo…”“Novus Ordo Seculorum,” Langdon said. “It means New Secular Order.”“Secular as in nonreligious?”“Nonreligious. The phrase not only clearly states the Illuminati objective, butit also blatantly contradicts the phrase beside it. In God We Trust.”Vittoria seemed troubled. “But how could all this symbology end up on the mostpowerful currency in the world?”“Most academics believe it was through Vice President Henry Wallace. He was anupper echelon Mason and certainly had ties to the Illuminati. Whether it was asa member or innocently under their influence, nobody knows. But it was Wallacewho sold the design of the Great Seal to the president.”“How? Why would the president have agreed to-”“The president was Franklin D. Roosevelt. Wallace simply told him Novus OrdoSeculorum meant New Deal.”Vittoria seemed skeptical. “And Roosevelt didn’t have anyone else look at thesymbol before telling the Treasury to print it?”“No need. He and Wallace were like brothers.”“Brothers?”“Check your history books,” Langdon said with a smile. “Franklin D. Rooseveltwas a well-known Mason.”"},{"pageContent":"32Langdon held his breath as the X-33 spiraled into Rome’s Leonardo da VinciInternational Airport. Vittoria sat across from him, eyes closed as if trying towill the situation into control. The craft touched down and taxied to a privatehangar.“Sorry for the slow flight,” the pilot apologized, emerging from the cockpit.“Had to trim her back. Noise regulations over populated areas.”Langdon checked his watch. They had been airborne thirty-seven minutes.The pilot popped the outer door. “Anybody want to tell me what’s going on?”Neither Vittoria nor Langdon responded.“Fine,” he said, stretching. “I’ll be in the cockpit with the air-conditioningand my music. Just me and Garth.”The late-afternoon sun blazed outside the hangar. Langdon carried his tweedjacket over his shoulder. Vittoria turned her face skyward and inhaled deeply,as if the sun’s rays somehow transferred to her some mystical replenishingenergy.Mediterraneans, Langdon mused, already sweating.“Little old for cartoons, aren’t you?” Vittoria asked, without opening her eyes.“I’m sorry?”“Your wristwatch. I saw it on the plane.”Langdon flushed slightly. He was accustomed to having to defend his timepiece.The collector’s edition Mickey Mouse watch had been a childhood gift from hisparents. Despite the contorted foolishness of Mickey’s outstretched armsdesignating the hour, it was the only watch Langdon had ever worn. Waterproofand glow-in-the-dark, it was perfect for swimming laps or walking unlit collegepaths at night. When Langdon’s students questioned his fashion sense, he toldthem he wore Mickey as a daily reminder to stay young at heart.“It’s six o’clock,” he said.Vittoria nodded, eyes still closed. “I think our ride’s here.”Langdon heard the distant whine, looked up, and felt a sinking feeling.Approaching from the north was a helicopter, slicing low across the runway.Langdon had been on a helicopter once in the Andean Palpa Valley looking at theNazca sand drawings and had not enjoyed it one bit. A flying shoebox. After amorning of space plane rides, Langdon had hoped the Vatican would send a car.Apparently not.The chopper slowed overhead, hovered a moment, and dropped toward the runway infront of them. The craft was white and carried a coat of arms emblazoned on theside-two skeleton keys crossing a shield and papal crown. He knew the symbolwell. It was the traditional seal of the Vatican-the sacred symbol of the HolySee or “holy seat” of government, the seat being literally the ancient throne ofSt. Peter.The Holy Chopper, Langdon groaned, watching the craft land. He’d forgotten theVatican owned one of these things, used for transporting the Pope to theairport, to meetings, or to his summer palace in Gandolfo. Langdon definitelywould have preferred a car.The pilot jumped from the cockpit and strode toward them across the tarmac.Now it was Vittoria who looked uneasy. “That’s our pilot?”Langdon shared her concern. “To fly, or not to fly. That is the question.”The pilot looked like he was festooned for a Shakespearean melodrama. His puffytunic was vertically striped in brilliant blue and gold. He wore matchingpantaloons and spats. On his feet were black flats that looked like slippers. Ontop of it all, he wore a black felt beret.“Traditional Swiss Guard uniforms,” Langdon explained. “Designed by Michelangelohimself.” As the man drew closer, Langdon winced. “I admit, not one ofMichelangelo’s better efforts.”Despite the man’s garish attire, Langdon could tell the pilot meant business. Hemoved toward them with all the rigidity and dignity of a U.S. Marine. Langdonhad read many times about the rigorous requirements for becoming one of theelite Swiss Guard. Recruited from one of Switzerland’s four Catholic cantons,applicants had to be Swiss males between nineteen and thirty years old, at least5 feet 6 inches, trained by the Swiss Army, and unmarried. This imperial corpswas envied by world governments as the most allegiant and deadly security forcein the world.“You are from CERN?” the guard asked, arriving before them. His voice wassteely.“Yes, sir,” Langdon replied.“You made remarkable time,” he said, giving the X-33 a mystified stare. Heturned to Vittoria. “Ma’am, do you have any other clothing?”“I beg your pardon?”He motioned to her legs. “Short pants are not permitted inside Vatican City.”Langdon glanced down at Vittoria’s legs and frowned. He had forgotten. VaticanCity had a strict ban on visible legs above the knee-both male and female. Theregulation was a way of showing respect for the sanctity of God’s city.“This is all I have,” she said. “We came in a hurry.”The guard nodded, clearly displeased. He turned next to Langdon. “Are youcarrying any weapons?”Weapons? Langdon thought. I’m not even carrying a change of underwear! He shookhis head.The officer crouched at Langdon’s feet and began patting him down, starting athis socks. Trusting guy, Langdon thought. The guard’s strong hands moved upLangdon’s legs, coming uncomfortably close to his groin. Finally they moved upto his chest and shoulders. Apparently content Langdon was clean, the guardturned to Vittoria. He ran his eyes up her legs and torso.Vittoria glared. “Don’t even think about it.”The guard fixed Vittoria with a gaze clearly intended to intimidate. Vittoriadid not flinch.“What’s that?” the guard said, pointing to a faint square bulge in the frontpocket of her shorts.Vittoria removed an ultrathin cell phone. The guard took it, clicked it on,waited for a dial tone, and then, apparently satisfied that it was indeednothing more than a phone, returned it to her. Vittoria slid it back into herpocket.“Turn around, please,” the guard said.Vittoria obliged, holding her arms out and rotating a full 360 degrees.The guard carefully studied her. Langdon had already decided that Vittoria’sform-fitting shorts and blouse were not bulging anywhere they shouldn’t havebeen. Apparently the guard came to the same conclusion.“Thank you. This way please.”The Swiss Guard chopper churned in neutral as Langdon and Vittoria approached.Vittoria boarded first, like a seasoned pro, barely even stooping as she passedbeneath the whirling rotors. Langdon held back a moment.“No chance of a car?” he yelled, half-joking to the Swiss Guard, who wasclimbing in the pilot’s seat.The man did not answer.Langdon knew that with Rome’s maniacal drivers, flying was probably saferanyway. He took a deep breath and boarded, stooping cautiously as he passedbeneath the spinning rotors.As the guard fired up the engines, Vittoria called out, “Have you located thecanister?”The guard glanced over his shoulder, looking confused. “The what?”“The canister. You called CERN about a canister?”The man shrugged. “No idea what you’re talking about. We’ve been very busytoday. My commander told me to pick you up. That’s all I know.”Vittoria gave Langdon an unsettled look.“Buckle up, please,” the pilot said as the engine revved.Langdon reached for his seat belt and strapped himself in. The tiny fuselageseemed to shrink around him. Then with a roar, the craft shot up and bankedsharply north toward Rome.Rome… the caput mundi, where Caesar once ruled, where St. Peter was crucified.The cradle of modern civilization. And at its core… a ticking bomb."},{"pageContent":"33Rome from the air is a labyrinth-an indecipherable maze of ancient roadwayswinding around buildings, fountains, and crumbling ruins.The Vatican chopper stayed low in the sky as it sliced northwest through thepermanent smog layer coughed up by the congestion below. Langdon gazed down atthe mopeds, sight-seeing buses, and armies of miniature Fiat sedans buzzingaround rotaries in all directions. Koyaanisqatsi, he thought, recalling the Hopiterm for “life out of balance.”Vittoria sat in silent determination in the seat beside him.The chopper banked hard.His stomach dropping, Langdon gazed farther into the distance. His eyes foundthe crumbling ruins of the Roman Coliseum. The Coliseum, Langdon had alwaysthought, was one of history’s greatest ironies. Now a dignified symbol for therise of human culture and civilization, the stadium had been built to hostcenturies of barbaric events-hungry lions shredding prisoners, armies of slavesbattling to the death, gang rapes of exotic women captured from far-off lands,as well as public beheadings and castrations. It was ironic, Langdon thought, orperhaps fitting, that the Coliseum had served as the architectural blueprint forHarvard’s Soldier Field-the football stadium where the ancient traditions ofsavagery were reenacted every fall… crazed fans screaming for bloodshed asHarvard battled Yale.As the chopper headed north, Langdon spied the Roman Forum-the heart ofpre-Christian Rome. The decaying columns looked like toppled gravestones in acemetery that had somehow avoided being swallowed by the metropolis surroundingit.To the west the wide basin of the Tiber River wound enormous arcs across thecity. Even from the air Langdon could tell the water was deep. The churningcurrents were brown, filled with silt and foam from heavy rains.“Straight ahead,” the pilot said, climbing higher.Langdon and Vittoria looked out and saw it. Like a mountain parting the morningfog, the colossal dome rose out of the haze before them: St. Peter’s Basilica.“Now that,” Langdon said to Vittoria, “is something Michelangelo got right.”Langdon had never seen St. Peter’s from the air. The marble faзade blazed likefire in the afternoon sun. Adorned with 140 statues of saints, martyrs, andangels, the Herculean edifice stretched two football fields wide and astaggering six long. The cavernous interior of the basilica had room for over60,000 worshipers… over one hundred times the population of Vatican City, thesmallest country in the world.Incredibly, though, not even a citadel of this magnitude could dwarf the piazzabefore it. A sprawling expanse of granite, St. Peter’s Square was a staggeringopen space in the congestion of Rome, like a classical Central Park. In front ofthe basilica, bordering the vast oval common, 284 columns swept outward in fourconcentric arcs of diminishing size… an architectural trompe de l’oiel used toheighten the piazza’s sense of grandeur.As he stared at the magnificent shrine before him, Langdon wondered what St.Peter would think if he were here now. The Saint had died a gruesome death,crucified upside down on this very spot. Now he rested in the most sacred oftombs, buried five stories down, directly beneath the central cupola of thebasilica.“Vatican City,” the pilot said, sounding anything but welcoming.Langdon looked out at the towering stone bastions that loomed ahead-impenetrablefortifications surrounding the complex… a strangely earthly defense for aspiritual world of secrets, power, and mystery.“Look!” Vittoria said suddenly, grabbing Langdon’s arm. She motioned franticallydownward toward St. Peter’s Square directly beneath them. Langdon put his faceto the window and looked.“Over there,” she said, pointing.Langdon looked. The rear of the piazza looked like a parking lot crowded with adozen or so trailer trucks. Huge satellite dishes pointed skyward from the roofof every truck. The dishes were emblazoned with familiar names:TELEVISOR EUROPEA VIDEO ITALIA BBC UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONALLangdon felt suddenly confused, wondering if the news of the antimatter hadalready leaked out.Vittoria seemed suddenly tense. “Why is the press here? What’s going on?”The pilot turned and gave her an odd look over his shoulder. “What’s going on?You don’t know?”“No,” she fired back, her accent husky and strong.“Il Conclavo,” he said. “It is to be sealed in about an hour. The whole world iswatching.”Il Conclavo.The word rang a long moment in Langdon’s ears before dropping like a brick tothe pit of his stomach. Il Conclavo. The Vatican Conclave. How could he haveforgotten? It had been in the news recently.Fifteen days ago, the Pope, after a tremendously popular twelve-year reign, hadpassed away. Every paper in the world had carried the story about the Pope’sfatal stroke while sleeping-a sudden and unexpected death many whispered wassuspicious. But now, in keeping with the sacred tradition, fifteen days afterthe death of a Pope, the Vatican was holding Il Conclavo-the sacred ceremony inwhich the 165 cardinals of the world-the most powerful men inChristendom-gathered in Vatican City to elect the new Pope.Every cardinal on the planet is here today, Langdon thought as the chopperpassed over St. Peter’s Basilica. The expansive inner world of Vatican Cityspread out beneath him. The entire power structure of the Roman Catholic Churchis sitting on a time bomb."},{"pageContent":"34Cardinal Mortati gazed up at the lavish ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and triedto find a moment of quiet reflection. The frescoed walls echoed with the voicesof cardinals from nations around the globe. The men jostled in the candlelittabernacle, whispering excitedly and consulting with one another in numerouslanguages, the universal tongues being English, Italian, and Spanish.The light in the chapel was usually sublime-long rays of tinted sun slicingthrough the darkness like rays from heaven-but not today. As was the custom, allof the chapel’s windows had been covered in black velvet in the name of secrecy.This ensured that no one on the inside could send signals or communicate in anyway with the outside world. The result was a profound darkness lit only bycandles… a shimmering radiance that seemed to purify everyone it touched, makingthem all ghostly… like saints.What privilege, Mortati thought, that I am to oversee this sanctified event.Cardinals over eighty years of age were too old to be eligible for election anddid not attend conclave, but at seventy-nine years old, Mortati was the mostsenior cardinal here and had been appointed to oversee the proceedings.Following tradition, the cardinals gathered here two hours before conclave tocatch up with friends and engage in last-minute discussion. At 7 P.M., the latePope’s chamberlain would arrive, give opening prayer, and then leave. Then theSwiss Guard would seal the doors and lock all the cardinals inside. It was thenthat the oldest and most secretive political ritual in the world would begin.The cardinals would not be released until they decided who among them would bethe next Pope.Conclave. Even the name was secretive. “Con clave” literally meant “locked witha key.” The cardinals were permitted no contact whatsoever with the outsideworld. No phone calls. No messages. No whispers through doorways. Conclave was avacuum, not to be influenced by anything in the outside world. This would ensurethat the cardinals kept Solum Dum prae oculis… only God before their eyes.Outside the walls of the chapel, of course, the media watched and waited,speculating as to which of the cardinals would become the ruler of one billionCatholics worldwide. Conclaves created an intense, politically chargedatmosphere, and over the centuries they had turned deadly; poisonings, fistfights, and even murder had erupted within the sacred walls. Ancient history,Mortati thought. Tonight’s conclave will be unified, blissful, and above all…brief.Or at least that had been his speculation.Now, however, an unexpected development had emerged. Mystifyingly, fourcardinals were absent from the chapel. Mortati knew that all the exits toVatican City were guarded, and the missing cardinals could not have gone far,but still, with less than an hour before opening prayer, he was feelingdisconcerted. After all, the four missing men were no ordinary cardinals. Theywere the cardinals.The chosen four.As overseer of the conclave, Mortati had already sent word through the properchannels to the Swiss Guard alerting them to the cardinals’ absence. He had yetto hear back. Other cardinals had now noticed the puzzling absence. The anxiouswhispers had begun. Of all cardinals, these four should be on time! CardinalMortati was starting to fear it might be a long evening after all.He had no idea."},{"pageContent":"35The Vatican’s helipad, for reasons of safety and noise control, is located inthe northwest tip of Vatican City, as far from St. Peter’s Basilica as possible.“Terra firma,” the pilot announced as they touched down. He exited and openedthe sliding door for Langdon and Vittoria.Langdon descended from the craft and turned to help Vittoria, but she hadalready dropped effortlessly to the ground. Every muscle in her body seemedtuned to one objective-finding the antimatter before it left a horrific legacy.After stretching a reflective sun tarp across the cockpit window, the pilotushered them to an oversized electric golf cart waiting near the helipad. Thecart whisked them silently alongside the country’s western border-afifty-foot-tall cement bulwark thick enough to ward off attacks even by tanks.Lining the interior of the wall, posted at fifty-meter intervals, Swiss Guardsstood at attention, surveying the interior of the grounds. The cart turnedsharply right onto Via della Osservatorio. Signs pointed in all directions:PALAZZIO GOVERNATORIO COLLEGIO ETHIOPIANA BASILICA SAN PIETRO CAPELLA SISTINAThey accelerated up the manicured road past a squat building marked RADIOVATICANA. This, Langdon realized to his amazement, was the hub of the world’smost listened-to radio programming-Radio Vaticana-spreading the word of God tomillions of listeners around the globe.“Attenzione,” the pilot said, turning sharply into a rotary.As the cart wound round, Langdon could barely believe the sight now coming intoview. Giardini Vaticani, he thought. The heart of Vatican City. Directly aheadrose the rear of St. Peter’s Basilica, a view, Langdon realized, most peoplenever saw. To the right loomed the Palace of the Tribunal, the lush papalresidence rivaled only by Versailles in its baroque embellishment. Thesevere-looking Governatorato building was now behind them, housing VaticanCity’s administration. And up ahead on the left, the massive rectangular edificeof the Vatican Museum. Langdon knew there would be no time for a museum visitthis trip.“Where is everyone?” Vittoria asked, surveying the deserted lawns and walkways.The guard checked his black, military-style chronograph-an odd anachronismbeneath his puffy sleeve. “The cardinals are convened in the Sistine Chapel.Conclave begins in a little under an hour.”Langdon nodded, vaguely recalling that before conclave the cardinals spent twohours inside the Sistine Chapel in quiet reflection and visitations with theirfellow cardinals from around the globe. The time was meant to renew oldfriendships among the cardinals and facilitate a less heated election process.“And the rest of the residents and staff?”“Banned from the city for secrecy and security until the conclave concludes.”“And when does it conclude?”The guard shrugged. “God only knows.” The words sounded oddly literal.After parking the cart on the wide lawn directly behind St. Peter’s Basilica,the guard escorted Langdon and Vittoria up a stone escarpment to a marble plazaoff the back of the basilica. Crossing the plaza, they approached the rear wallof the basilica and followed it through a triangular courtyard, across ViaBelvedere, and into a series of buildings closely huddled together. Langdon’sart history had taught him enough Italian to pick out signs for the VaticanPrinting Office, the Tapestry Restoration Lab, Post Office Management, and theChurch of St. Ann. They crossed another small square and arrived at theirdestination.The Office of the Swiss Guard is housed adjacent to Il Corpo di Vigilanza,directly northeast of St. Peter’s Basilica. The office is a squat, stonebuilding. On either side of the entrance, like two stone statues, stood a pairof guards.Langdon had to admit, these guards did not look quite so comical. Although theyalso wore the blue and gold uniform, each wielded the traditional “Vatican longsword”-an eight-foot spear with a razor-sharp scythe-rumored to have decapitatedcountless Muslims while defending the Christian crusaders in the fifteenthcentury.As Langdon and Vittoria approached, the two guards stepped forward, crossingtheir long swords, blocking the entrance. One looked up at the pilot inconfusion. “I pantaloni,” he said, motioning to Vittoria’s shorts.The pilot waved them off. “Il comandante vuole vederli subito.”The guards frowned. Reluctantly they stepped aside.Inside, the air was cool. It looked nothing like the administrative securityoffices Langdon would have imagined. Ornate and impeccably furnished, thehallways contained paintings Langdon was certain any museum worldwide wouldgladly have featured in its main gallery.The pilot pointed down a steep set of stairs. “Down, please.”Langdon and Vittoria followed the white marble treads as they descended betweena gauntlet of nude male sculptures. Each statue wore a fig leaf that was lighterin color than the rest of the body.The Great Castration, Langdon thought.It was one of the most horrific tragedies in Renaissance art. In 1857, Pope PiusIX decided that the accurate representation of the male form might incite lustinside the Vatican. So he got a chisel and mallet and hacked off the genitaliaof every single male statue inside Vatican City. He defaced works byMichelangelo, Bramante, and Bernini. Plaster fig leaves were used to patch thedamage. Hundreds of sculptures had been emasculated. Langdon had often wonderedif there was a huge crate of stone penises someplace.“Here,” the guard announced.They reached the bottom of the stairs and dead-ended at a heavy, steel door. Theguard typed an entry code, and the door slid open. Langdon and Vittoria entered.Beyond the threshold was absolute mayhem."},{"pageContent":"36The Office of the Swiss Guard.Langdon stood in the doorway, surveying the collision of centuries before them.Mixed media. The room was a lushly adorned Renaissance library complete withinlaid bookshelves, oriental carpets, and colorful tapestries… and yet the roombristled with high-tech gear-banks of computers, faxes, electronic maps of theVatican complex, and televisions tuned to CNN. Men in colorful pantaloons typedfeverishly on computers and listened intently in futuristic headphones.“Wait here,” the guard said.Langdon and Vittoria waited as the guard crossed the room to an exceptionallytall, wiry man in a dark blue military uniform. He was talking on a cellularphone and stood so straight he was almost bent backward. The guard saidsomething to him, and the man shot a glance over at Langdon and Vittoria. Henodded, then turned his back on them and continued his phone call.The guard returned. “Commander Olivetti will be with you in a moment.”“Thank you.”The guard left and headed back up the stairs.Langdon studied Commander Olivetti across the room, realizing he was actuallythe Commander in Chief of the armed forces of an entire country. Vittoria andLangdon waited, observing the action before them. Brightly dressed guardsbustled about yelling orders in Italian.“Continua cercando!” one yelled into a telephone.“Probasti il museo?”another asked.Langdon did not need fluent Italian to discern that the security center wascurrently in intense search mode. This was the good news. The bad news was thatthey obviously had not yet found the antimatter.“You okay?” Langdon asked Vittoria.She shrugged, offering a tired smile.When the commander finally clicked off his phone and approached across the room,he seemed to grow with each step. Langdon was tall himself and not accustomed tolooking up at many people, but Commander Olivetti demanded it. Langdon sensedimmediately that the commander was a man who had weathered tempests, his facehale and steeled. His dark hair was cropped in a military buzz cut, and his eyesburned with the kind of hardened determination only attainable through years ofintense training. He moved with ramrod exactness, the earpiece hidden discreetlybehind one ear making him look more like U.S. Secret Service than Swiss Guard.The commander addressed them in accented English. His voice was startlinglyquiet for such a large man, barely a whisper. It bit with a tight, militaryefficiency. “Good afternoon,” he said. “I am Commander Olivetti-ComandantePrincipale of the Swiss Guard. I’m the one who called your director.”Vittoria gazed upward. “Thank you for seeing us, sir.”The commander did not respond. He motioned for them to follow and led themthrough the tangle of electronics to a door in the side wall of the chamber.“Enter,” he said, holding the door for them.Langdon and Vittoria walked through and found themselves in a darkened controlroom where a wall of video monitors was cycling lazily through a series ofblack-and-white images of the complex. A young guard sat watching the imagesintently.“Fuori,” Olivetti said.The guard packed up and left.Olivetti walked over to one of the screens and pointed to it. Then he turnedtoward his guests. “This image is from a remote camera hidden somewhere insideVatican City. I’d like an explanation.”Langdon and Vittoria looked at the screen and inhaled in unison. The image wasabsolute. No doubt. It was CERN’s antimatter canister. Inside, a shimmeringdroplet of metallic liquid hung ominously in the air, lit by the rhythmicblinking of the LED digital clock. Eerily, the area around the canister wasalmost entirely dark, as if the antimatter were in a closet or darkened room. Atthe top of the monitor flashed superimposed text: LIVE FEED-CAMERA #86.Vittoria looked at the time remaining on the flashing indicator on the canister.“Under six hours,” she whispered to Langdon, her face tense.Langdon checked his watch. “So we have until…” He stopped, a knot tightening inhis stomach.“Midnight,” Vittoria said, with a withering look.Midnight, Langdon thought. A flair for the dramatic. Apparently whoever stolethe canister last night had timed it perfectly. A stark foreboding set in as herealized he was currently sitting at ground zero.Olivetti’s whisper now sounded more like a hiss. “Does this object belong toyour facility?”Vittoria nodded. “Yes, sir. It was stolen from us. It contains an extremelycombustible substance called antimatter.”Olivetti looked unmoved. “I am quite familiar with incendiaries, Ms. Vetra. Ihave not heard of antimatter.”“It’s new technology. We need to locate it immediately or evacuate VaticanCity.”Olivetti closed his eyes slowly and reopened them, as if refocusing on Vittoriamight change what he just heard. “Evacuate? Are you aware what is going on herethis evening?”“Yes, sir. And the lives of your cardinals are in danger. We have about sixhours. Have you made any headway locating the canister?”Olivetti shook his head. “We haven’t started looking.”Vittoria choked. “What? But we expressly heard your guards talking aboutsearching the-”“Searching, yes,” Olivetti said, “but not for your canister. My men are lookingfor something else that does not concern you.”Vittoria’s voice cracked. “You haven’t even begun looking for this canister?”Olivetti’s pupils seemed to recede into his head. He had the passionless look ofan insect. “Ms. Vetra, is it? Let me explain something to you. The director ofyour facility refused to share any details about this object with me over thephone except to say that I needed to find it immediately. We are exceptionallybusy, and I do not have the luxury of dedicating manpower to a situation until Iget some facts.”“There is only one relevant fact at this moment, sir,” Vittoria said, “thatbeing that in six hours that device is going to vaporize this entire complex.”Olivetti stood motionless. “Ms. Vetra, there is something you need to know.” Histone hinted at patronizing. “Despite the archaic appearance of Vatican City,every single entrance, both public and private, is equipped with the mostadvanced sensing equipment known to man. If someone tried to enter with any sortof incendiary device it would be detected instantly. We have radioactive isotopescanners, olfactory filters designed by the American DEA to detect the faintestchemical signatures of combustibles and toxins. We also use the most advancedmetal detectors and X-ray scanners available.”“Very impressive,” Vittoria said, matching Olivetti’s cool. “Unfortunately,antimatter is nonradioactive, its chemical signature is that of pure hydrogen,and the canister is plastic. None of those devices would have detected it.”“But the device has an energy source,” Olivetti said, motioning to the blinkingLED. “Even the smallest trace of nickel-cadmium would register as-”“The batteries are also plastic.”Olivetti’s patience was clearly starting to wane. “Plastic batteries?”“Polymer gel electrolyte with Teflon.”Olivetti leaned toward her, as if to accentuate his height advantage.“Signorina, the Vatican is the target of dozens of bomb threats a month. Ipersonally train every Swiss Guard in modern explosive technology. I am wellaware that there is no substance on earth powerful enough to do what you aredescribing unless you are talking about a nuclear warhead with a fuel core thesize of a baseball.”Vittoria framed him with a fervent stare. “Nature has many mysteries yet tounveil.”Olivetti leaned closer. “Might I ask exactly who you are? What is your positionat CERN?”“I am a senior member of the research staff and appointed liaison to the Vaticanfor this crisis.”“Excuse me for being rude, but if this is indeed a crisis, why am I dealing withyou and not your director? And what disrespect do you intend by coming intoVatican City in short pants?”Langdon groaned. He couldn’t believe that under the circumstances the man wasbeing a stickler for dress code. Then again, he realized, if stone penises couldinduce lustful thoughts in Vatican residents, Vittoria Vetra in shorts couldcertainly be a threat to national security.“Commander Olivetti,” Langdon intervened, trying to diffuse what looked like asecond bomb about to explode. “My name is Robert Langdon. I’m a professor ofreligious studies in the U.S. and unaffiliated with CERN. I have seen anantimatter demonstration and will vouch for Ms. Vetra’s claim that it isexceptionally dangerous. We have reason to believe it was placed inside yourcomplex by an antireligious cult hoping to disrupt your conclave.”Olivetti turned, peering down at Langdon. “I have a woman in shorts telling methat a droplet of liquid is going to blow up Vatican City, and I have anAmerican professor telling me we are being targeted by some antireligious cult.What exactly is it you expect me to do?”“Find the canister,” Vittoria said. “Right away.”“Impossible. That device could be anywhere. Vatican City is enormous.”“Your cameras don’t have GPS locators on them?”“They are not generally stolen. This missing camera will take days to locate.”“We don’t have days,” Vittoria said adamantly. “We have six hours.”“Six hours until what, Ms. Vetra?” Olivetti’s voice grew louder suddenly. Hepointed to the image on the screen. “Until these numbers count down? UntilVatican City disappears? Believe me, I do not take kindly to people tamperingwith my security system. Nor do I like mechanical contraptions appearingmysteriously inside my walls. I am concerned. It is my job to be concerned. Butwhat you have told me here is unacceptable.”Langdon spoke before he could stop himself. “Have you heard of the Illuminati?”The commander’s icy exterior cracked. His eyes went white, like a shark about toattack. “I am warning you. I do not have time for this.”“So you have heard of the Illuminati?”Olivetti’s eyes stabbed like bayonets. “I am a sworn defendant of the CatholicChurch. Of course I have heard of the Illuminati. They have been dead fordecades.”Langdon reached in his pocket and pulled out the fax image of Leonardo Vetra’sbranded body. He handed it to Olivetti.“I am an Illuminati scholar,” Langdon said as Olivetti studied the picture. “Iam having a difficult time accepting that the Illuminati are still active, andyet the appearance of this brand combined with the fact that the Illuminati havea well-known covenant against Vatican City has changed my mind.”“A computer-generated hoax.” Olivetti handed the fax back to Langdon.Langdon stared, incredulous. “Hoax? Look at the symmetry! You of all peopleshould realize the authenticity of-”“Authenticity is precisely what you lack. Perhaps Ms. Vetra has not informedyou, but CERN scientists have been criticizing Vatican policies for decades.They regularly petition us for retraction of Creationist theory, formalapologies for Galileo and Copernicus, repeal of our criticism against dangerousor immoral research. What scenario seems more likely to you-that afour-hundred-year-old satanic cult has resurfaced with an advanced weapon ofmass destruction, or that some prankster at CERN is trying to disrupt a sacredVatican event with a well-executed fraud?”“That photo,” Vittoria said, her voice like boiling lava, “is of my father.Murdered. You think this is my idea of a joke?”“I don’t know, Ms. Vetra. But I do know until I get some answers that makesense, there is no way I will raise any sort of alarm. Vigilance and discretionare my duty… such that spiritual matters can take place here with clarity ofmind. Today of all days.”Langdon said, “At least postpone the event.”“Postpone?” Olivetti’s jaw dropped. “Such arrogance! A conclave is not someAmerican baseball game you call on account of rain. This is a sacred event witha strict code and process. Never mind that one billion Catholics in the worldare waiting for a leader. Never mind that the world media is outside. Theprotocols for this event are holy-not subject to modification. Since 1179,conclaves have survived earthquakes, famines, and even the plague. Believe me,it is not about to be canceled on account of a murdered scientist and a dropletof God knows what.”“Take me to the person in charge,” Vittoria demanded.Olivetti glared. “You’ve got him.”“No,” she said. “Someone in the clergy.”The veins on Olivetti’s brow began to show. “The clergy has gone. With theexception of the Swiss Guard, the only ones present in Vatican City at this timeare the College of Cardinals. And they are inside the Sistine Chapel.”“How about the chamberlain?” Langdon stated flatly.“Who?”“The late Pope’s chamberlain.” Langdon repeated the word self-assuredly, prayinghis memory served him. He recalled reading once about the curious arrangement ofVatican authority following the death of a Pope. If Langdon was correct, duringthe interim between Popes, complete autonomous power shifted temporarily to thelate Pope’s personal assistant-his chamberlain-a secretarial underling whooversaw conclave until the cardinals chose the new Holy Father. “I believe thechamberlain is the man in charge at the moment.”“Il camerlegno?” Olivetti scowled. “The camerlegno is only a priest here. He isnot even canonized. He is the late Pope’s hand servant.”“But he is here. And you answer to him.”Olivetti crossed his arms. “Mr. Langdon, it is true that Vatican rule dictatesthe camerlegno assume chief executive office during conclave, but it is onlybecause his lack of eligibility for the papacy ensures an unbiased election. Itis as if your president died, and one of his aides temporarily sat in the ovaloffice. The camerlegno is young, and his understanding of security, or anythingelse for that matter, is extremely limited. For all intents and purposes, I amin charge here.”“Take us to him,” Vittoria said.“Impossible. Conclave begins in forty minutes. The camerlegno is in the Officeof the Pope preparing. I have no intention of disturbing him with matters ofsecurity.”Vittoria opened her mouth to respond but was interrupted by a knocking at thedoor. Olivetti opened it.A guard in full regalia stood outside, pointing to his watch. “ЙЙ l’ora,comandante.”Olivetti checked his own watch and nodded. He turned back to Langdon andVittoria like a judge pondering their fate. “Follow me.” He led them out of themonitoring room across the security center to a small clear cubicle against therear wall. “My office.” Olivetti ushered them inside. The room was unspecial-acluttered desk, file cabinets, folding chairs, a water cooler. “I will be backin ten minutes. I suggest you use the time to decide how you would like toproceed.”Vittoria wheeled. “You can’t just leave! That canister is-”“I do not have time for this,” Olivetti seethed. “Perhaps I should detain youuntil after the conclave when I do have time.”“Signore,” the guard urged, pointing to his watch again. “Spazzare di capella.”Olivetti nodded and started to leave.“Spazzare di capella?” Vittoria demanded. “You’re leaving to sweep the chapel?”Olivetti turned, his eyes boring through her. “We sweep for electronic bugs,Miss Vetra-a matter of discretion.” He motioned to her legs. “Not something Iwould expect you to understand.”With that he slammed the door, rattling the heavy glass. In one fluid motion heproduced a key, inserted it, and twisted. A heavy deadbolt slid into place.“Idiтta!” Vittoria yelled. “You can’t keep us in here!”Through the glass, Langdon could see Olivetti say something to the guard. Thesentinel nodded. As Olivetti strode out of the room, the guard spun and facedthem on the other side of the glass, arms crossed, a large sidearm visible onhis hip.Perfect, Langdon thought. Just bloody perfect."},{"pageContent":"37Vittoria glared at the Swiss Guard standing outside Olivetti’s locked door. Thesentinel glared back, his colorful costume belying his decidedly ominous air.“Che fiasco,” Vittoria thought. Held hostage by an armed man in pajamas.Langdon had fallen silent, and Vittoria hoped he was using that Harvard brain ofhis to think them out of this. She sensed, however, from the look on his face,that he was more in shock than in thought. She regretted getting him soinvolved.Vittoria’s first instinct was to pull out her cell phone and call Kohler, butshe knew it was foolish. First, the guard would probably walk in and take herphone. Second, if Kohler’s episode ran its usual course, he was probably stillincapacitated. Not that it mattered… Olivetti seemed unlikely to take anybody’sword on anything at the moment.Remember! she told herself. Remember the solution to this test!Remembrance was a Buddhist philosopher’s trick. Rather than asking her mind tosearch for a solution to a potentially impossible challenge, Vittoria asked hermind simply to remember it. The presupposition that one once knew the answercreated the mindset that the answer must exist… thus eliminating the cripplingconception of hopelessness. Vittoria often used the process to solve scientificquandaries… those that most people thought had no solution.At the moment, however, her remembrance trick was drawing a major blank. So shemeasured her options… her needs. She needed to warn someone. Someone at theVatican needed to take her seriously. But who? The camerlegno? How? She was in aglass box with one exit.Tools, she told herself. There are always tools. Reevaluate your environment.Instinctively she lowered her shoulders, relaxed her eyes, and took three deepbreaths into her lungs. She sensed her heart rate slow and her muscles soften.The chaotic panic in her mind dissolved. Okay, she thought, let your mind befree. What makes this situation positive? What are my assets?The analytical mind of Vittoria Vetra, once calmed, was a powerful force. Withinseconds she realized their incarceration was actually their key to escape.“I’m making a phone call,” she said suddenly.Langdon looked up. “I was about to suggest you call Kohler, but-”“Not Kohler. Someone else.”“Who?”“The camerlegno.”Langdon looked totally lost. “You’re calling the chamberlain? How?”“Olivetti said the camerlegno was in the Pope’s office.”“Okay. You know the Pope’s private number?”“No. But I’m not calling on my phone.” She nodded to a high-tech phone system onOlivetti’s desk. It was riddled with speed dial buttons. “The head of securitymust have a direct line to the Pope’s office.”“He also has a weight lifter with a gun planted six feet away.”“And we’re locked in.”“I was actually aware of that.”“I mean the guard is locked out. This is Olivetti’s private office. I doubtanyone else has a key.”Langdon looked out at the guard. “This is pretty thin glass, and that’s a prettybig gun.”“What’s he going to do, shoot me for using the phone?”“Who the hell knows! This is a pretty strange place, and the way things aregoing-”“Either that,” Vittoria said, “or we can spend the next five hours andforty-eight minutes in Vatican Prison. At least we’ll have a front-row seat whenthe antimatter goes off.”Langdon paled. “But the guard will get Olivetti the second you pick up thatphone. Besides, there are twenty buttons on there. And I don’t see anyidentification. You going to try them all and hope to get lucky?”“Nope,” she said, striding to the phone. “Just one.” Vittoria picked up thephone and pressed the top button. “Number one. I bet you one of those IlluminatiU.S. dollars you have in your pocket that this is the Pope’s office. What elsewould take primary importance for a Swiss Guard commander?”Langdon did not have time to respond. The guard outside the door started rappingon the glass with the butt of his gun. He motioned for her to set down thephone.Vittoria winked at him. The guard seemed to inflate with rage.Langdon moved away from the door and turned back to Vittoria. “You damn wellbetter be right, ‘cause this guy does not look amused!”“Damn!” she said, listening to the receiver. “A recording.”“Recording?” Langdon demanded. “The Pope has an answering machine?”“It wasn’t the Pope’s office,” Vittoria said, hanging up. “It was the damnweekly menu for the Vatican commissary.”Langdon offered a weak smile to the guard outside who was now glaring angrilythough the glass while he hailed Olivetti on his walkie-talkie."},{"pageContent":"38The Vatican switchboard is located in the Ufficio di Communicazione behind theVatican post office. It is a relatively small room containing an eight-lineCorelco 141 switchboard. The office handles over 2,000 calls a day, most routedautomatically to the recording information system.Tonight, the sole communications operator on duty sat quietly sipping a cup ofcaffeinated tea. He felt proud to be one of only a handful of employees stillallowed inside Vatican City tonight. Of course the honor was tainted somewhat bythe presence of the Swiss Guards hovering outside his door. An escort to thebathroom, the operator thought. Ah, the indignities we endure in the name ofHoly Conclave.Fortunately, the calls this evening had been light. Or maybe it was not sofortunate, he thought. World interest in Vatican events seemed to have dwindledin the last few years. The number of press calls had thinned, and even thecrazies weren’t calling as often. The press office had hoped tonight’s eventwould have more of a festive buzz about it. Sadly, though, despite St. Peter’sSquare being filled with press trucks, the vans looked to be mostly standardItalian and Euro press. Only a handful of global cover-all networks were there…no doubt having sent their giornalisti secundari.The operator gripped his mug and wondered how long tonight would last. Midnightor so, he guessed. Nowadays, most insiders already knew who was favored tobecome Pope well before conclave convened, so the process was more of a three-or four-hour ritual than an actual election. Of course, last-minute dissensionin the ranks could prolong the ceremony through dawn… or beyond. The conclave of1831 had lasted fifty-four days. Not tonight, he told himself; rumor was thisconclave would be a “smoke-watch.”The operator’s thoughts evaporated with the buzz of an inside line on hisswitchboard. He looked at the blinking red light and scratched his head. That’sodd, he thought. The zero-line. Who on the inside would be calling operatorinformation tonight? Who is even inside?“Cittа del Vaticano, prego?” he said, picking up the phone.The voice on the line spoke in rapid Italian. The operator vaguely recognizedthe accent as that common to Swiss Guards-fluent Italian tainted by theFranco-Swiss influence. This caller, however, was most definitely not SwissGuard.On hearing the woman’s voice, the operator stood suddenly, almost spilling histea. He shot a look back down at the line. He had not been mistaken. An internalextension. The call was from the inside. There must be some mistake! he thought.A woman inside Vatican City? Tonight?The woman was speaking fast and furiously. The operator had spent enough yearson the phones to know when he was dealing with a pazzo. This woman did not soundcrazy. She was urgent but rational. Calm and efficient. He listened to herrequest, bewildered.“Il camerlegno?” the operator said, still trying to figure out where the hellthe call was coming from. “I cannot possibly connect… yes, I am aware he is inthe Pope’s office but… who are you again?… and you want to warn him of…” Helistened, more and more unnerved. Everyone is in danger? How? And where are youcalling from? “Perhaps I should contact the Swiss…” The operator stopped short.“You say you’re where? Where?”He listened in shock, then made a decision. “Hold, please,” he said, putting thewoman on hold before she could respond. Then he called Commander Olivetti’sdirect line. There is no way that woman is really-The line picked up instantly.“Per l’amore di Dio!” a familiar woman’s voice shouted at him. “Place the damncall!”The door of the Swiss Guards’ security center hissed open. The guards parted asCommander Olivetti entered the room like a rocket. Turning the corner to hisoffice, Olivetti confirmed what his guard on the walkie-talkie had just toldhim; Vittoria Vetra was standing at his desk talking on the commander’s privatetelephone.Che coglioni che ha questa! he thought. The balls on this one!Livid, he strode to the door and rammed the key into the lock. He pulled openthe door and demanded, “What are you doing!”Vittoria ignored him. “Yes,” she was saying into the phone. “And I must warn-”Olivetti ripped the receiver from her hand, and raised it to his ear. “Who thehell is this!”For the tiniest of an instant, Olivetti’s inelastic posture slumped. “Yes,camerlegno…” he said. “Correct, signore… but questions of security demand… ofcourse not… I am holding her here for… certainly, but…” He listened. “Yes, sir,”he said finally. “I will bring them up immediately.”"},{"pageContent":"39The Apostolic Palace is a conglomeration of buildings located near the SistineChapel in the northeast corner of Vatican City. With a commanding view of St.Peter’s Square, the palace houses both the Papal Apartments and the Office ofthe Pope.Vittoria and Langdon followed in silence as Commander Olivetti led them down along rococo corridor, the muscles in his neck pulsing with rage. After climbingthree sets of stairs, they entered a wide, dimly lit hallway.Langdon could not believe the artwork on the walls-mint-condition busts,tapestries, friezes-works worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Two-thirds ofthe way down the hall they passed an alabaster fountain. Olivetti turned leftinto an alcove and strode to one of the largest doors Langdon had ever seen.“Ufficio di Papa,” the commander declared, giving Vittoria an acrimonious scowl.Vittoria didn’t flinch. She reached over Olivetti and knocked loudly on thedoor.Office of the Pope, Langdon thought, having difficulty fathoming that he wasstanding outside one of the most sacred rooms in all of world religion.“Avanti!” someone called from within.When the door opened, Langdon had to shield his eyes. The sunlight was blinding.Slowly, the image before him came into focus.The Office of the Pope seemed more of a ballroom than an office. Red marblefloors sprawled out in all directions to walls adorned with vivid frescoes. Acolossal chandelier hung overhead, beyond which a bank of arched windows offereda stunning panorama of the sun-drenched St. Peter’s Square.My God, Langdon thought. This is a room with a view.At the far end of the hall, at a carved desk, a man sat writing furiously.“Avanti,” he called out again, setting down his pen and waving them over.Olivetti led the way, his gait military. “Signore,” he said apologetically. “Noho potuto-”The man cut him off. He stood and studied his two visitors.The camerlegno was nothing like the images of frail, beatific old men Langdonusually imagined roaming the Vatican. He wore no rosary beads or pendants. Noheavy robes. He was dressed instead in a simple black cassock that seemed toamplify the solidity of his substantial frame. He looked to be in hislate-thirties, indeed a child by Vatican standards. He had a surprisinglyhandsome face, a swirl of coarse brown hair, and almost radiant green eyes thatshone as if they were somehow fueled by the mysteries of the universe. As theman drew nearer, though, Langdon saw in his eyes a profound exhaustion-like asoul who had been through the toughest fifteen days of his life.“I am Carlo Ventresca,” he said, his English perfect. “The late Pope’scamerlegno.” His voice was unpretentious and kind, with only the slightest hintof Italian inflection.“Vittoria Vetra,” she said, stepping forward and offering her hand. “Thank youfor seeing us.”Olivetti twitched as the camerlegno shook Vittoria’s hand.“This is Robert Langdon,” Vittoria said. “A religious historian from HarvardUniversity.”“Padre,” Langdon said, in his best Italian accent. He bowed his head as heextended his hand.“No, no,” the camerlegno insisted, lifting Langdon back up. “His Holiness’soffice does not make me holy. I am merely a priest-a chamberlain serving in atime of need.”Langdon stood upright.“Please,” the camerlegno said, “everyone sit.” He arranged some chairs aroundhis desk. Langdon and Vittoria sat. Olivetti apparently preferred to stand.The camerlegno seated himself at the desk, folded his hands, sighed, and eyedhis visitors.“Signore,” Olivetti said. “The woman’s attire is my fault. I-”“Her attire is not what concerns me,” the camerlegno replied, sounding tooexhausted to be bothered. “When the Vatican operator calls me a half hour beforeI begin conclave to tell me a woman is calling from your private office to warnme of some sort of major security threat of which I have not been informed, thatconcerns me.”Olivetti stood rigid, his back arched like a soldier under intense inspection.Langdon felt hypnotized by the camerlegno’s presence. Young and wearied as hewas, the priest had the air of some mythical hero-radiating charisma andauthority.“Signore,” Olivetti said, his tone apologetic but still unyielding. “You shouldnot concern yourself with matters of security. You have other responsibilities.”“I am well aware of my other responsibilities. I am also aware that as direttoreintermediario, I have a responsibility for the safety and well-being of everyoneat this conclave. What is going on here?”“I have the situation under control.”“Apparently not.”“Father,” Langdon interrupted, taking out the crumpled fax and handing it to thecamerlegno, “please.”Commander Olivetti stepped forward, trying to intervene. “Father, please do nottrouble your thoughts with-”The camerlegno took the fax, ignoring Olivetti for a long moment. He looked atthe image of the murdered Leonardo Vetra and drew a startled breath. “What isthis?”“That is my father,” Vittoria said, her voice wavering. “He was a priest and aman of science. He was murdered last night.”The camerlegno’s face softened instantly. He looked up at her. “My dear child.I’m so sorry.” He crossed himself and looked again at the fax, his eyes seemingto pool with waves of abhorrence. “Who would… and this burn on his…” Thecamerlegno paused, squinting closer at the image.“It says Illuminati,” Langdon said. “No doubt you are familiar with the name.”An odd look came across the camerlegno’s face. “I have heard the name, yes,but…”“The Illuminati murdered Leonardo Vetra so they could steal a new technology hewas-”“Signore,” Olivetti interjected. “This is absurd. The Illuminati? This isclearly some sort of elaborate hoax.”The camerlegno seemed to ponder Olivetti’s words. Then he turned andcontemplated Langdon so fully that Langdon felt the air leave his lungs. “Mr.Langdon, I have spent my life in the Catholic Church. I am familiar with theIlluminati lore… and the legend of the brandings. And yet I must warn you, I ama man of the present tense. Christianity has enough real enemies withoutresurrecting ghosts.”“The symbol is authentic,” Langdon said, a little too defensively he thought. Hereached over and rotated the fax for the camerlegno.The camerlegno fell silent when he saw the symmetry.“Even modern computers,” Langdon added, “have been unable to forge a symmetricalambigram of this word.”The camerlegno folded his hands and said nothing for a long time. “TheIlluminati are dead,” he finally said. “Long ago. That is historical fact.”Langdon nodded. “Yesterday, I would have agreed with you.”“Yesterday?”“Before today’s chain of events. I believe the Illuminati have resurfaced tomake good on an ancient pact.”“Forgive me. My history is rusty. What ancient pact is this?”Langdon took a deep breath. “The destruction of Vatican City.”“Destroy Vatican City?” The camerlegno looked less frightened than confused.“But that would be impossible.”Vittoria shook her head. “I’m afraid we have some more bad news.”"},{"pageContent":"40Is this true?“ the camerlegno demanded, looking amazed as he turned fromVittoria to Olivetti.“Signore,” Olivetti assured, “I’ll admit there is some sort of device here. Itis visible on one of our security monitors, but as for Ms. Vetra’s claims as tothe power of this substance, I cannot possibly-”“Wait a minute,” the camerlegno said. “You can see this thing?”“Yes, signore. On wireless camera #86.”“Then why haven’t you recovered it?” The camerlegno’s voice echoed anger now.“Very difficult, signore.” Olivetti stood straight as he explained thesituation.The camerlegno listened, and Vittoria sensed his growing concern. “Are youcertain it is inside Vatican City?” the camerlegno asked. “Maybe someone tookthe camera out and is transmitting from somewhere else.”“Impossible,” Olivetti said. “Our external walls are shielded electronically toprotect our internal communications. This signal can only be coming from theinside or we would not be receiving it.”“And I assume,” he said, “that you are now looking for this missing camera withall available resources?”Olivetti shook his head. “No, signore. Locating that camera could take hundredsof man hours. We have a number of other security concerns at the moment, andwith all due respect to Ms. Vetra, this droplet she talks about is very small.It could not possibly be as explosive as she claims.”Vittoria’s patience evaporated. “That droplet is enough to level Vatican City!Did you even listen to a word I told you?”“Ma’am,” Olivetti said, his voice like steel, “my experience with explosives isextensive.”“Your experience is obsolete,” she fired back, equally tough. “Despite myattire, which I realize you find troublesome, I am a senior level physicist atthe world’s most advanced subatomic research facility. I personally designed theantimatter trap that is keeping that sample from annihilating right now. And Iam warning you that unless you find that canister in the next six hours, yourguards will have nothing to protect for the next century but a big hole in theground.”Olivetti wheeled to the camerlegno, his insect eyes flashing rage. “Signore, Icannot in good conscience allow this to go any further. Your time is beingwasted by pranksters. The Illuminati? A droplet that will destroy us all?”“Basta,” the camerlegno declared. He spoke the word quietly and yet it seemed toecho across the chamber. Then there was silence. He continued in a whisper.“Dangerous or not, Illuminati or no Illuminati, whatever this thing is, it mostcertainly should not be inside Vatican City… no less on the eve of the conclave.I want it found and removed. Organize a search immediately.”Olivetti persisted. “Signore, even if we used all the guards to search thecomplex, it could take days to find this camera. Also, after speaking to Ms.Vetra, I had one of my guards consult our most advanced ballistics guide for anymention of this substance called antimatter. I found no mention of it anywhere.Nothing.”Pompous ass, Vittoria thought. A ballistics guide? Did you try an encyclopedia?Under A!Olivetti was still talking. “Signore, if you are suggesting we make a naked-eyesearch of the entirety of Vatican City then I must object.”“Commander.” The camerlegno’s voice simmered with rage. “May I remind you thatwhen you address me, you are addressing this office. I realize you do not takemy position seriously-nonetheless, by law, I am in charge. If I am not mistaken,the cardinals are now safely within the Sistine Chapel, and your securityconcerns are at a minimum until the conclave breaks. I do not understand why youare hesitant to look for this device. If I did not know better it would appearthat you are causing this conclave intentional danger.”Olivetti looked scornful. “How dare you! I have served your Pope for twelveyears! And the Pope before that for fourteen years! Since 1438 the Swiss Guardhave-”The walkie-talkie on Olivetti’s belt squawked loudly, cutting him off.“Comandante?”Olivetti snatched it up and pressed the transmitter. “Sto ocupato! Cosa voi!!”“Scusi,” the Swiss Guard on the radio said. “Communications here. I thought youwould want to be informed that we have received a bomb threat.”Olivetti could not have looked less interested. “So handle it! Run the usualtrace, and write it up.”“We did, sir, but the caller…” The guard paused. “I would not trouble you,commander, except that he mentioned the substance you just asked me to research.Antimatter.”Everyone in the room exchanged stunned looks.“He mentioned what?” Olivetti stammered.“Antimatter, sir. While we were trying to run a trace, I did some additionalresearch on his claim. The information on antimatter is… well, frankly, it’squite troubling.”“I thought you said the ballistics guide showed no mention of it.”“I found it on-line.”Alleluia, Vittoria thought.“The substance appears to be quite explosive,” the guard said. “It’s hard toimagine this information is accurate but it says here that pound for poundantimatter carries about a hundred times more payload than a nuclear warhead.”Olivetti slumped. It was like watching a mountain crumble. Vittoria’s feeling oftriumph was erased by the look of horror on the camerlegno’s face.“Did you trace the call?” Olivetti stammered.“No luck. Cellular with heavy encryption. The SAT lines are interfused, sotriangulation is out. The IF signature suggests he’s somewhere in Rome, butthere’s really no way to trace him.”“Did he make demands?” Olivetti said, his voice quiet.“No, sir. Just warned us that there is antimatter hidden inside the complex. Heseemed surprised I didn’t know. Asked me if I’d seen it yet. You’d asked meabout antimatter, so I decided to advise you.”“You did the right thing,” Olivetti said. “I’ll be down in a minute. Alert meimmediately if he calls back.”There was a moment of silence on the walkie-talkie. “The caller is still on theline, sir.”Olivetti looked like he’d just been electrocuted. “The line is open?”“Yes, sir. We’ve been trying to trace him for ten minutes, getting nothing butsplayed ferreting. He must know we can’t touch him because he refuses to hang upuntil he speaks to the camerlegno.”“Patch him through,” the camerlegno commanded. “Now!”Olivetti wheeled. “Father, no. A trained Swiss Guard negotiator is much bettersuited to handle this.”“Now!”Olivetti gave the order.A moment later, the phone on Camerlegno Ventresca’s desk began to ring. Thecamerlegno rammed his finger down on the speaker-phone button. “Who in the nameof God do you think you are?”"},{"pageContent":"41The voice emanating from the camerlegno’s speaker phone was metallic and cold,laced with arrogance. Everyone in the room listened.Langdon tried to place the accent. Middle Eastern, perhaps?“I am a messenger of an ancient brotherhood,” the voice announced in an aliencadence. “A brotherhood you have wronged for centuries. I am a messenger of theIlluminati.”Langdon felt his muscles tighten, the last shreds of doubt withering away. Foran instant he felt the familiar collision of thrill, privilege, and dead fearthat he had experienced when he first saw the ambigram this morning.“What do you want?” the camerlegno demanded.“I represent men of science. Men who like yourselves are searching for theanswers. Answers to man’s destiny, his purpose, his creator.”“Whoever you are,” the camerlegno said, “I-”“Silenzio. You will do better to listen. For two millennia your church hasdominated the quest for truth. You have crushed your opposition with lies andprophesies of doom. You have manipulated the truth to serve your needs,murdering those whose discoveries did not serve your politics. Are you surprisedyou are the target of enlightened men from around the globe?”“Enlightened men do not resort to blackmail to further their causes.”“Blackmail?” The caller laughed. “This is not blackmail. We have no demands. Theabolition of the Vatican is nonnegotiable. We have waited four hundred years forthis day. At midnight, your city will be destroyed. There is nothing you cando.”Olivetti stormed toward the speaker phone. “Access to this city is impossible!You could not possibly have planted explosives in here!”“You speak with the ignorant devotion of a Swiss Guard. Perhaps even an officer?Surely you are aware that for centuries the Illuminati have infiltrated elitistorganizations across the globe. Do you really believe the Vatican is immune?”Jesus, Langdon thought, they’ve got someone on the inside. It was no secret thatinfiltration was the Illuminati trademark of power. They had infiltrated theMasons, major banking networks, government bodies. In fact, Churchill had oncetold reporters that if English spies had infiltrated the Nazis to the degree theIlluminati had infiltrated English Parliament, the war would have been over inone month.“A transparent bluff,” Olivetti snapped. “Your influence cannot possibly extendso far.”“Why? Because your Swiss Guards are vigilant? Because they watch every corner ofyour private world? How about the Swiss Guards themselves? Are they not men? Doyou truly believe they stake their lives on a fable about a man who walks onwater? Ask yourself how else the canister could have entered your city. Or howfour of your most precious assets could have disappeared this afternoon.”“Our assets?” Olivetti scowled. “What do you mean?”“One, two, three, four. You haven’t missed them by now?”“What the hell are you talk-” Olivetti stopped short, his eyes rocketing wide asthough he’d just been punched in the gut.“Light dawns,” the caller said. “Shall I read their names?”“What’s going on?” the camerlegno said, looking bewildered.The caller laughed. “Your officer has not yet informed you? How sinful. Nosurprise. Such pride. I imagine the disgrace of telling you the truth… that fourcardinals he had sworn to protect seem to have disappeared…”Olivetti erupted. “Where did you get this information!”“Camerlegno,” the caller gloated, “ask your commander if all your cardinals arepresent in the Sistine Chapel.”The camerlegno turned to Olivetti, his green eyes demanding an explanation.“Signore,” Olivetti whispered in the camerlegno’s ear, “it is true that four ofour cardinals have not yet reported to the Sistine Chapel, but there is no needfor alarm. Every one of them checked into the residence hall this morning, so weknow they are safely inside Vatican City. You yourself had tea with them onlyhours ago. They are simply late for the fellowship preceding conclave. We aresearching, but I’m sure they just lost track of time and are still out enjoyingthe grounds.”“Enjoying the grounds?” The calm departed from the camerlegno’s voice. “Theywere due in the chapel over an hour ago!”Langdon shot Vittoria a look of amazement. Missing cardinals? So that’s whatthey were looking for downstairs?“Our inventory,” the caller said, “you will find quite convincing. There isCardinal Lamassй from Paris, Cardinal Guidera from Barcelona, Cardinal Ebnerfrom Frankfurt…”Olivetti seemed to shrink smaller and smaller after each name was read.The caller paused, as though taking special pleasure in the final name. “Andfrom Italy… Cardinal Baggia.”The camerlegno loosened like a tall ship that had just run sheets first into adead calm. His frock billowed, and he collapsed in his chair. “I preferiti,” hewhispered. “The four favorites… including Baggia… the most likely successor asSupreme Pontiff… how is it possible?”Langdon had read enough about modern papal elections to understand the look ofdesperation on the camerlegno’s face. Although technically any cardinal undereighty years old could become Pope, only a very few had the respect necessary tocommand a two-thirds majority in the ferociously partisan balloting procedure.They were known as the preferiti. And they were all gone.Sweat dripped from the camerlegno’s brow. “What do you intend with these men?”“What do you think I intend? I am a descendant of the Hassassin.”Langdon felt a shiver. He knew the name well. The church had made some deadlyenemies through the years-the Hassassin, the Knights Templar, armies that hadbeen either hunted by the Vatican or betrayed by them.“Let the cardinals go,” the camerlegno said. “Isn’t threatening to destroy theCity of God enough?”“Forget your four cardinals. They are lost to you. Be assured their deaths willbe remembered though… by millions. Every martyr’s dream. I will make them medialuminaries. One by one. By midnight the Illuminati will have everyone’sattention. Why change the world if the world is not watching? Public killingshave an intoxicating horror about them, don’t they? You proved that long ago…the inquisition, the torture of the Knights Templar, the Crusades.” He paused.“And of course, la purga.”The camerlegno was silent.“Do you not recall la purga?” the caller asked. “Of course not, you are a child.Priests are poor historians, anyway. Perhaps because their history shames them?”“La purga,” Langdon heard himself say. “Sixteen sixty-eight. The church brandedfour Illuminati scientists with the symbol of the cross. To purge their sins.”“Who is speaking?” the voice demanded, sounding more intrigued than concerned.“Who else is there?”Langdon felt shaky. “My name is not important,” he said, trying to keep hisvoice from wavering. Speaking to a living Illuminatus was disorienting for him…like speaking to George Washington. “I am an academic who has studied thehistory of your brotherhood.”“Superb,” the voice replied. “I am pleased there are still those alive whoremember the crimes against us.”“Most of us think you are dead.”“A misconception the brotherhood has worked hard to promote. What else do youknow of la purga?”Langdon hesitated. What else do I know? That this whole situation is insanity,that’s what I know! “After the brandings, the scientists were murdered, andtheir bodies were dropped in public locations around Rome as a warning to otherscientists not to join the Illuminati.”“Yes. So we shall do the same. Quid pro quo. Consider it symbolic retributionfor our slain brothers. Your four cardinals will die, one every hour starting ateight. By midnight the whole world will be enthralled.”Langdon moved toward the phone. “You actually intend to brand and kill thesefour men?”“History repeats itself, does it not? Of course, we will be more elegant andbold than the church was. They killed privately, dropping bodies when no one waslooking. It seems so cowardly.”“What are you saying?” Langdon asked. “That you are going to brand and killthese men in public?”“Very good. Although it depends what you consider public. I realize not manypeople go to church anymore.”Langdon did a double take. “You’re going to kill them in churches?”“A gesture of kindness. Enabling God to command their souls to heaven moreexpeditiously. It seems only right. Of course the press will enjoy it too, Iimagine.”“You’re bluffing,” Olivetti said, the cool back in his voice. “You cannot kill aman in a church and expect to get away with it.”“Bluffing? We move among your Swiss Guard like ghosts, remove four of yourcardinals from within your walls, plant a deadly explosive at the heart of yourmost sacred shrine, and you think this is a bluff? As the killings occur and thevictims are found, the media will swarm. By midnight the world will know theIlluminati cause.”“And if we stake guards in every church?” Olivetti said.The caller laughed. “I fear the prolific nature of your religion will make thata trying task. Have you not counted lately? There are over four hundred Catholicchurches in Rome. Cathedrals, chapels, tabernacles, abbeys, monasteries,convents, parochial schools…”Olivetti’s face remained hard.“In ninety minutes it begins,” the caller said with a note of finality. “One anhour. A mathematical progression of death. Now I must go.”“Wait!” Langdon demanded. “Tell me about the brands you intend to use on thesemen.”The killer sounded amused. “I suspect you know what the brands will be already.Or perhaps you are a skeptic? You will see them soon enough. Proof the ancientlegends are true.”Langdon felt light-headed. He knew exactly what the man was claiming. Langdonpictured the brand on Leonardo Vetra’s chest. Illuminati folklore spoke of fivebrands in all. Four brands are left, Langdon thought, and four missingcardinals.“I am sworn,” the camerlegno said, “to bring a new Pope tonight. Sworn by God.”“Camerlegno,” the caller said, “the world does not need a new Pope. Aftermidnight he will have nothing to rule over but a pile of rubble. The CatholicChurch is finished. Your run on earth is done.”Silence hung.The camerlegno looked sincerely sad. “You are misguided. A church is more thanmortar and stone. You cannot simply erase two thousand years of faith… anyfaith. You cannot crush faith simply by removing its earthly manifestations. TheCatholic Church will continue with or without Vatican City.”“A noble lie. But a lie all the same. We both know the truth. Tell me, why isVatican City a walled citadel?”“Men of God live in a dangerous world,” the camerlegno said.“How young are you? The Vatican is a fortress because the Catholic Church holdshalf of its equity inside its walls-rare paintings, sculpture, devalued jewels,priceless books… then there is the gold bullion and the real estate deeds insidethe Vatican Bank vaults. Inside estimates put the raw value of Vatican City at48.5 billion dollars. Quite a nest egg you’re sitting on. Tomorrow it will beash. Liquidated assets as it were. You will be bankrupt. Not even men of clothcan work for nothing.”The accuracy of the statement seemed to be reflected in Olivetti’s and thecamerlegno’s shell-shocked looks. Langdon wasn’t sure what was more amazing,that the Catholic Church had that kind of money, or that the Illuminati somehowknew about it.The camerlegno sighed heavily. “Faith, not money, is the backbone of thischurch.”“More lies,” the caller said. “Last year you spent 183 million dollars trying tosupport your struggling dioceses worldwide. Church attendance is at an all-timelow-down forty-six percent in the last decade. Donations are half what they wereonly seven years ago. Fewer and fewer men are entering the seminary. Althoughyou will not admit it, your church is dying. Consider this a chance to go outwith a bang.”Olivetti stepped forward. He seemed less combative now, as if he now sensed thereality facing him. He looked like a man searching for an out. Any out. “Andwhat if some of that bullion went to fund your cause?”“Do not insult us both.”“We have money.”“As do we. More than you can fathom.”Langdon flashed on the alleged Illuminati fortunes, the ancient wealth of theBavarian stone masons, the Rothschilds, the Bilderbergers, the legendaryIlluminati Diamond.“I preferiti,” the camerlegno said, changing the subject. His voice waspleading. “Spare them. They are old. They-”“They are virgin sacrifices.” The caller laughed. “Tell me, do you think theyare really virgins? Will the little lambs squeal when they die? Sacrificivergini nell‘ altare di scienza.”The camerlegno was silent for a long time. “They are men of faith,” he finallysaid. “They do not fear death.”The caller sneered. “Leonardo Vetra was a man of faith, and yet I saw fear inhis eyes last night. A fear I removed.”Vittoria, who had been silent, was suddenly airborne, her body taut with hatred.“Asino! He was my father!”A cackle echoed from the speaker. “Your father? What is this? Vetra has adaughter? You should know your father whimpered like a child at the end. Pitifulreally. A pathetic man.”Vittoria reeled as if knocked backward by the words. Langdon reached for her,but she regained her balance and fixed her dark eyes on the phone. “I swear onmy life, before this night is over, I will find you.” Her voice sharpened like alaser. “And when I do…”The caller laughed coarsely. “A woman of spirit. I am aroused. Perhaps beforethis night is over, I will find you. And when I do…”The words hung like a blade. Then he was gone."},{"pageContent":"42Cardinal Mortati was sweating now in his black robe. Not only was the SistineChapel starting to feel like a sauna, but conclave was scheduled to begin intwenty minutes, and there was still no word on the four missing cardinals. Intheir absence, the initial whispers of confusion among the other cardinals hadturned to outspoken anxiety.Mortati could not imagine where the truant men could be. With the camerlegnoperhaps? He knew the camerlegno had held the traditional private tea for thefour preferiti earlier that afternoon, but that had been hours ago. Were theyill? Something they ate? Mortati doubted it. Even on the verge of death thepreferiti would be here. It was once in a lifetime, usually never, that acardinal had the chance to be elected Supreme Pontiff, and by Vatican Law thecardinal had to be inside the Sistine Chapel when the vote took place.Otherwise, he was ineligible.Although there were four preferiti, few cardinals had any doubt who the nextPope would be. The past fifteen days had seen a blizzard of faxes and phonecalls discussing potential candidates. As was the custom, four names had beenchosen as preferiti, each of them fulfilling the unspoken requisites forbecoming Pope:Multilingual in Italian, Spanish, and English. No skeletons in his closet.Between sixty-five and eighty years old.As usual, one of the preferiti had risen above the others as the man the collegeproposed to elect. Tonight that man was Cardinal Aldo Baggia from Milan.Baggia’s untainted record of service, combined with unparalleled language skillsand the ability to communicate the essence of spirituality, had made him theclear favorite.So where the devil is he? Mortati wondered.Mortati was particularly unnerved by the missing cardinals because the task ofsupervising this conclave had fallen to him. A week ago, the College ofCardinals had unanimously chosen Mortati for the office known as The GreatElector-the conclave’s internal master of ceremonies. Even though the camerlegnowas the church’s ranking official, the camerlegno was only a priest and hadlittle familiarity with the complex election process, so one cardinal wasselected to oversee the ceremony from within the Sistine Chapel.Cardinals often joked that being appointed The Great Elector was the cruelesthonor in Christendom. The appointment made one ineligible as a candidate duringthe election, and it also required one spend many days prior to conclave poringover the pages of the Universi Dominici Gregis reviewing the subtleties ofconclave’s arcane rituals to ensure the election was properly administered.Mortati held no grudge, though. He knew he was the logical choice. Not only washe the senior cardinal, but he had also been a confidant of the late Pope, afact that elevated his esteem. Although Mortati was technically still within thelegal age window for election, he was getting a bit old to be a seriouscandidate. At seventy-nine years old he had crossed the unspoken thresholdbeyond which the college no longer trusted one’s health to withstand therigorous schedule of the papacy. A Pope usually worked fourteen-hour days, sevendays a week, and died of exhaustion in an average of 6.3 years. The inside jokewas that accepting the papacy was a cardinal’s “fastest route to heaven.”Mortati, many believed, could have been Pope in his younger days had he not beenso broad-minded. When it came to pursuing the papacy, there was a HolyTrinity-Conservative. Conservative. Conservative.Mortati had always found it pleasantly ironic that the late Pope, God rest hissoul, had revealed himself as surprisingly liberal once he had taken office.Perhaps sensing the modern world progressing away from the church, the Pope hadmade overtures, softening the church’s position on the sciences, even donatingmoney to selective scientific causes. Sadly, it had been political suicide.Conservative Catholics declared the Pope “senile,” while scientific puristsaccused him of trying to spread the church’s influence where it did not belong.“So where are they?”Mortati turned.One of the cardinals was tapping him nervously on the shoulder. “You know wherethey are, don’t you?”Mortati tried not to show too much concern. “Perhaps still with the camerlegno.”“At this hour? That would be highly unorthodox!” The cardinal frownedmistrustingly. “Perhaps the camerlegno lost track of time?”Mortati sincerely doubted it, but he said nothing. He was well aware that mostcardinals did not much care for the camerlegno, feeling he was too young toserve the Pope so closely. Mortati suspected much of the cardinals’ dislike wasjealousy, and Mortati actually admired the young man, secretly applauding thelate Pope’s selection for chamberlain. Mortati saw only conviction when helooked in the camerlegno’s eyes, and unlike many of the cardinals, thecamerlegno put church and faith before petty politics. He was truly a man ofGod.Throughout his tenure, the camerlegno’s steadfast devotion had become legendary.Many attributed it to the miraculous event in his childhood… an event that wouldhave left a permanent impression on any man’s heart. The miracle and wonder ofit, Mortati thought, often wishing his own childhood had presented an event thatfostered that kind of doubtless faith.Unfortunately for the church, Mortati knew, the camerlegno would never becomePope in his elder years. Attaining the papacy required a certain amount ofpolitical ambition, something the young camerlegno apparently lacked; he hadrefused his Pope’s offers for higher clerical stations many times, saying hepreferred to serve the church as a simple man.“What next?” The cardinal tapped Mortati, waiting.Mortati looked up. “I’m sorry?”“They’re late! What shall we do!”“What can we do?” Mortati replied. “We wait. And have faith.”Looking entirely unsatisfied with Mortati’s response, the cardinal shrunk backinto the shadows.Mortati stood a moment, dabbing his temples and trying to clear his mind.Indeed, what shall we do? He gazed past the altar up to Michelangelo’s renownedfresco, “The Last Judgment.” The painting did nothing to soothe his anxiety. Itwas a horrifying, fifty-foot-tall depiction of Jesus Christ separating mankindinto the righteous and sinners, casting the sinners into hell. There was flayedflesh, burning bodies, and even one of Michelangelo’s rivals sitting in hellwearing ass’s ears. Guy de Maupassant had once written that the painting lookedlike something painted for a carnival wrestling booth by an ignorant coalheaver.Cardinal Mortati had to agree."},{"pageContent":"43Langdon stood motionless at the Pope’s bulletproof window and gazed down at thebustle of media trailers in St. Peter’s Square. The eerie phone conversation hadleft him feeling turgid… distended somehow. Not himself.The Illuminati, like a serpent from the forgotten depths of history, had risenand wrapped themselves around an ancient foe. No demands. No negotiation. Justretribution. Demonically simple. Squeezing. A revenge 400 years in the making.It seemed that after centuries of persecution, science had bitten back.The camerlegno stood at his desk, staring blankly at the phone. Olivetti was thefirst to break the silence. “Carlo,” he said, using the camerlegno’s first nameand sounding more like a weary friend than an officer. “For twenty-six years, Ihave sworn my life to the protection of this office. It seems tonight I amdishonored.”The camerlegno shook his head. “You and I serve God in different capacities, butservice always brings honor.”“These events… I can’t imagine how… this situation…” Olivetti lookedoverwhelmed.“You realize we have only one possible course of action. I have a responsibilityfor the safety of the College of Cardinals.”“I fear that responsibility was mine, signore.”“Then your men will oversee the immediate evacuation.”“Signore?”“Other options can be exercised later-a search for this device, a manhunt forthe missing cardinals and their captors. But first the cardinals must be takento safety. The sanctity of human life weighs above all. Those men are thefoundation of this church.”“You suggest we cancel conclave right now?”“Do I have a choice?”“What about your charge to bring a new Pope?”The young chamberlain sighed and turned to the window, his eyes drifting outonto the sprawl of Rome below. “His Holiness once told me that a Pope is a mantorn between two worlds… the real world and the divine. He warned that anychurch that ignored reality would not survive to enjoy the divine.” His voicesounded suddenly wise for its years. “The real world is upon us tonight. Wewould be vain to ignore it. Pride and precedent cannot overshadow reason.”Olivetti nodded, looking impressed. “I have underestimated you, signore.”The camerlegno did not seem to hear. His gaze was distant on the window.“I will speak openly, signore. The real world is my world. I immerse myself inits ugliness every day such that others are unencumbered to seek something morepure. Let me advise you on the present situation. It is what I am trained for.Your instincts, though worthy… could be disastrous.”The camerlegno turned.Olivetti sighed. “The evacuation of the College of Cardinals from the SistineChapel is the worst possible thing you could do right now.”The camerlegno did not look indignant, only at a loss. “What do you suggest?”“Say nothing to the cardinals. Seal conclave. It will buy us time to try otheroptions.”The camerlegno looked troubled. “Are you suggesting I lock the entire College ofCardinals on top of a time bomb?”“Yes, signore. For now. Later, if need be, we can arrange evacuation.”The camerlegno shook his head. “Postponing the ceremony before it starts isgrounds alone for an inquiry, but after the doors are sealed nothing intervenes.Conclave procedure obligates-”“Real world, signore. You’re in it tonight. Listen closely.” Olivetti spoke nowwith the efficient rattle of a field officer. “Marching one hundred sixty-fivecardinals unprepared and unprotected into Rome would be reckless. It would causeconfusion and panic in some very old men, and frankly, one fatal stroke thismonth is enough.”One fatal stroke. The commander’s words recalled the headlines Langdon had readover dinner with some students in the Harvard Commons: POPE SUFFERS STROKE. DIESIN SLEEP.“In addition,” Olivetti said, “the Sistine Chapel is a fortress. Although wedon’t advertise the fact, the structure is heavily reinforced and can repel anyattack short of missiles. As preparation we searched every inch of the chapelthis afternoon, scanning for bugs and other surveillance equipment. The chapelis clean, a safe haven, and I am confident the antimatter is not inside. Thereis no safer place those men can be right now. We can always discuss emergencyevacuation later if it comes to that.”Langdon was impressed. Olivetti’s cold, smart logic reminded him of Kohler.“Commander,” Vittoria said, her voice tense, “there are other concerns. Nobodyhas ever created this much antimatter. The blast radius, I can only estimate.Some of surrounding Rome may be in danger. If the canister is in one of yourcentral buildings or underground, the effect outside these walls may be minimal,but if the canister is near the perimeter… in this building for example…” Sheglanced warily out the window at the crowd in St. Peter’s Square.“I am well aware of my responsibilities to the outside world,” Olivetti replied,“and it makes this situation no more grave. The protection of this sanctuary hasbeen my sole charge for over two decades. I have no intention of allowing thisweapon to detonate.”Camerlegno Ventresca looked up. “You think you can find it?”“Let me discuss our options with some of my surveillance specialists. There is apossibility, if we kill power to Vatican City, that we can eliminate thebackground RF and create a clean enough environment to get a reading on thatcanister’s magnetic field.”Vittoria looked surprised, and then impressed. “You want to black out VaticanCity?”“Possibly. I don’t yet know if it’s possible, but it is one option I want toexplore.”“The cardinals would certainly wonder what happened,” Vittoria remarked.Olivetti shook his head. “Conclaves are held by candlelight. The cardinals wouldnever know. After conclave is sealed, I could pull all except a few of myperimeter guards and begin a search. A hundred men could cover a lot of groundin five hours.”“Four hours,” Vittoria corrected. “I need to fly the canister back to CERN.Detonation is unavoidable without recharging the batteries.”“There’s no way to recharge here?”Vittoria shook her head. “The interface is complex. I’d have brought it if Icould.”“Four hours then,” Olivetti said, frowning. “Still time enough. Panic serves noone. Signore, you have ten minutes. Go to the chapel, seal conclave. Give my mensome time to do their job. As we get closer to the critical hour, we will makethe critical decisions.”Langdon wondered how close to “the critical hour” Olivetti would let things get.The camerlegno looked troubled. “But the college will ask about the preferiti…especially about Baggia… where they are.”“Then you will have to think of something, signore. Tell them you served thefour cardinals something at tea that disagreed with them.”The camerlegno looked riled. “Stand on the altar of the Sistine Chapel and lieto the College of Cardinals?”“For their own safety. Una bugia veniale. A white lie. Your job will be to keepthe peace.” Olivetti headed for the door. “Now if you will excuse me, I need toget started.”“Comandante,” the camerlegno urged, “we cannot simply turn our backs on missingcardinals.”Olivetti stopped in the doorway. “Baggia and the others are currently outsideour sphere of influence. We must let them go… for the good of the whole. Themilitary calls it triage.”“Don’t you mean abandonment?”His voice hardened. “If there were any way, signore… any way in heaven to locatethose four cardinals, I would lay down my life to do it. And yet…” He pointedacross the room at the window where the early evening sun glinted off an endlesssea of Roman rooftops. “Searching a city of five million is not within my power.I will not waste precious time to appease my conscience in a futile exercise.I’m sorry.”Vittoria spoke suddenly. “But if we caught the killer, couldn’t you make himtalk?”Olivetti frowned at her. “Soldiers cannot afford to be saints, Ms. Vetra.Believe me, I empathize with your personal incentive to catch this man.”“It’s not only personal,” she said. “The killer knows where the antimatter is…and the missing cardinals. If we could somehow find him…”“Play into their hands?” Olivetti said. “Believe me, removing all protectionfrom Vatican City in order to stake out hundreds of churches is what theIlluminati hope we will do… wasting precious time and manpower when we should besearching… or worse yet, leaving the Vatican Bank totally unprotected. Not tomention the remaining cardinals.”The point hit home.“How about the Roman Police?” the camerlegno asked. “We could alert citywideenforcement of the crisis. Enlist their help in finding the cardinals’ captor.”“Another mistake,” Olivetti said. “You know how the Roman Carbonieri feel aboutus. We’d get a half-hearted effort of a few men in exchange for their sellingour crisis to the global media. Exactly what our enemies want. We’ll have todeal with the media soon enough as it is.”I will make your cardinals media luminaries, Langdon thought, recalling thekiller’s words. The first cardinal’s body appears at eight o’clock. Then oneevery hour. The press will love it.The camerlegno was talking again, a trace of anger in his voice. “Commander, wecannot in good conscience do nothing about the missing cardinals!”Olivetti looked the camerlegno dead in the eye. “The prayer of St. Francis,signore. Do you recall it?”The young priest spoke the single line with pain in his voice. “God, grant mestrength to accept those things I cannot change.”“Trust me,” Olivetti said. “This is one of those things.” Then he was gone."},{"pageContent":"44The central office of the British Broadcast Corporation (BBC) is in London justwest of Piccadilly Circus. The switchboard phone rang, and a junior contenteditor picked up.“BBC,” she said, stubbing out her Dunhill cigarette.The voice on the line was raspy, with a Mid-East accent. “I have a breakingstory your network might be interested in.”The editor took out a pen and a standard Lead Sheet. “Regarding?”“The papal election.”She frowned wearily. The BBC had run a preliminary story yesterday to mediocreresponse. The public, it seemed, had little interest in Vatican City. “What’sthe angle?”“Do you have a TV reporter in Rome covering the election?”“I believe so.”“I need to speak to him directly.”“I’m sorry, but I cannot give you that number without some idea-”“There is a threat to the conclave. That is all I can tell you.”The editor took notes. “Your name?”“My name is immaterial.”The editor was not surprised. “And you have proof of this claim?”“I do.”“I would be happy to take the information, but it is not our policy to give outour reporters’ numbers unless-”“I understand. I will call another network. Thank you for your time. Good-b-”“Just a moment,” she said. “Can you hold?”The editor put the caller on hold and stretched her neck. The art of screeningout potential crank calls was by no means a perfect science, but this caller hadjust passed the BBC’s two tacit tests for authenticity of a phone source. He hadrefused to give his name, and he was eager to get off the phone. Hacks and gloryhounds usually whined and pleaded.Fortunately for her, reporters lived in eternal fear of missing the big story,so they seldom chastised her for passing along the occasional delusionalpsychotic. Wasting five minutes of a reporter’s time was forgivable. Missing aheadline was not.Yawning, she looked at her computer and typed in the keywords “Vatican City.”When she saw the name of the field reporter covering the papal election, shechuckled to herself. He was a new guy the BBC had just brought up from sometrashy London tabloid to handle some of the BBC’s more mundane coverage.Editorial had obviously started him at the bottom rung.He was probably bored out of his mind, waiting all night to record his liveten-second video spot. He would most likely be grateful for a break in themonotony.The BBC content editor copied down the reporter’s satellite extension in VaticanCity. Then, lighting another cigarette, she gave the anonymous caller thereporter’s number."},{"pageContent":"45It won’t work,“ Vittoria said, pacing the Pope’s office. She looked up at thecamerlegno. ”Even if a Swiss Guard team can filter electronic interference, theywill have to be practically on top of the canister before they detect anysignal. And that’s if the canister is even accessible… unenclosed by otherbarriers. What if it’s buried in a metal box somewhere on your grounds? Or up ina metal ventilating duct. There’s no way they’ll trace it. And what if the SwissGuards have been infiltrated? Who’s to say the search will be clean?“The camerlegno looked drained. “What are you proposing, Ms. Vetra?”Vittoria felt flustered. Isn’t it obvious! “I am proposing, sir, that you takeother precautions immediately. We can hope against all hope that the commander’ssearch is successful. At the same time, look out the window. Do you see thosepeople? Those buildings across the piazza? Those media vans? The tourists? Theyare quite possibly within range of the blast. You need to act now.”The camerlegno nodded vacantly.Vittoria felt frustrated. Olivetti had convinced everyone there was plenty oftime. But Vittoria knew if news of the Vatican predicament leaked out, theentire area could fill with onlookers in a matter of minutes. She had seen itonce outside the Swiss Parliament building. During a hostage situation involvinga bomb, thousands had congregated outside the building to witness the outcome.Despite police warnings that they were in danger, the crowd packed in closer andcloser. Nothing captured human interest like human tragedy.“Signore,” Vittoria urged, “the man who killed my father is out there somewhere.Every cell in this body wants to run from here and hunt him down. But I amstanding in your office… because I have a responsibility to you. To you andothers. Lives are in danger, signore. Do you hear me?”The camerlegno did not answer.Vittoria could hear her own heart racing. Why couldn’t the Swiss Guard tracethat damn caller? The Illuminati assassin is the key! He knows where theantimatter is… hell, he knows where the cardinals are! Catch the killer, andeverything is solved.Vittoria sensed she was starting to come unhinged, an alien distress sherecalled only faintly from childhood, the orphanage years, frustration with notools to handle it. You have tools, she told herself, you always have tools. Butit was no use. Her thoughts intruded, strangling her. She was a researcher andproblem solver. But this was a problem with no solution. What data do yourequire? What do you want? She told herself to breathe deeply, but for the firsttime in her life, she could not. She was suffocating.Langdon’s head ached, and he felt like he was skirting the edges of rationality.He watched Vittoria and the camerlegno, but his vision was blurred by hideousimages: explosions, press swarming, cameras rolling, four branded humans.Shaitan… Lucifer… Bringer of light… Satan…He shook the fiendish images from his mind. Calculated terrorism, he remindedhimself, grasping at reality. Planned chaos. He thought back to a Radcliffeseminar he had once audited while researching praetorian symbolism. He had neverseen terrorists the same way since.“Terrorism,” the professor had lectured, “has a singular goal. What is it?”“Killing innocent people?” a student ventured.“Incorrect. Death is only a byproduct of terrorism.”“A show of strength?”“No. A weaker persuasion does not exist.”“To cause terror?”“Concisely put. Quite simply, the goal of terrorism is to create terror andfear. Fear undermines faith in the establishment. It weakens the enemy fromwithin… causing unrest in the masses. Write this down. Terrorism is not anexpression of rage. Terrorism is a political weapon. Remove a government’sfaзade of infallibility, and you remove its people’s faith.”Loss of faith…Is that what this was all about? Langdon wondered how Christians of the worldwould react to cardinals being laid out like mutilated dogs. If the faith of acanonized priest did not protect him from the evils of Satan, what hope wasthere for the rest of us? Langdon’s head was pounding louder now… tiny voicesplaying tug of war.Faith does not protect you. Medicine and airbags… those are things that protectyou. God does not protect you. Intelligence protects you. Enlightenment. Putyour faith in something with tangible results. How long has it been sincesomeone walked on water? Modern miracles belong to science… computers, vaccines,space stations… even the divine miracle of creation. Matter from nothing… in alab. Who needs God? No! Science is God.The killer’s voice resonated in Langdon’s mind. Midnight… mathematicalprogression of death… sacrifici vergini nell‘ altare di scienza.“Then suddenly, like a crowd dispersed by a single gunshot, the voices were gone.Robert Langdon bolted to his feet. His chair fell backward and crashed on themarble floor.Vittoria and the camerlegno jumped.“I missed it,” Langdon whispered, spellbound. “It was right in front of me…”“Missed what?” Vittoria demanded.Langdon turned to the priest. “Father, for three years I have petitioned thisoffice for access to the Vatican Archives. I have been denied seven times.”“Mr. Langdon, I am sorry, but this hardly seems the moment to raise suchcomplaints.”“I need access immediately. The four missing cardinals. I may be able to figureout where they’re going to be killed.”Vittoria stared, looking certain she had misunderstood.The camerlegno looked troubled, as if he were the brunt of a cruel joke. “Youexpect me to believe this information is in our archives?”“I can’t promise I can locate it in time, but if you let me in…”“Mr. Langdon, I am due in the Sistine Chapel in four minutes. The archives areacross Vatican City.”“You’re serious aren’t you?” Vittoria interrupted, staring deep into Langdon’seyes, seeming to sense his earnestness.“Hardly a joking time,” Langdon said.“Father,” Vittoria said, turning to the camerlegno, “if there’s a chance… any atall of finding where these killings are going to happen, we could stake out thelocations and-”“But the archives?” the camerlegno insisted. “How could they possibly containany clue?”“Explaining it,” Langdon said, “will take longer than you’ve got. But if I’mright, we can use the information to catch the Hassassin.”The camerlegno looked as though he wanted to believe but somehow could not.“Christianity’s most sacred codices are in that archive. Treasures I myself amnot privileged enough to see.”“I am aware of that.”“Access is permitted only by written decree of the curator and the Board ofVatican Librarians.”“Or,” Langdon declared, “by papal mandate. It says so in every rejection letteryour curator ever sent me.”The camerlegno nodded.“Not to be rude,” Langdon urged, “but if I’m not mistaken a papal mandate comesfrom this office. As far as I can tell, tonight you hold the trust of hisstation. Considering the circumstances…”The camerlegno pulled a pocket watch from his cassock and looked at it. “Mr.Langdon, I am prepared to give my life tonight, quite literally, to save thischurch.”Langdon sensed nothing but truth in the man’s eyes.“This document,” the camerlegno said, “do you truly believe it is here? And thatit can help us locate these four churches?”“I would not have made countless solicitations for access if I were notconvinced. Italy is a bit far to come on a lark when you make a teacher’ssalary. The document you have is an ancient-”“Please,” the camerlegno interrupted. “Forgive me. My mind cannot process anymore details at the moment. Do you know where the secret archives are located?”Langdon felt a rush of excitement. “Just behind the Santa Ana Gate.”“Impressive. Most scholars believe it is through the secret door behind St.Peter’s Throne.”“No. That would be the Archivio della Reverenda di Fabbrica di S. Pietro. Acommon misconception.”“A librarian docent accompanies every entrant at all times. Tonight, the docentsare gone. What you are requesting is carte blanche access. Not even ourcardinals enter alone.”“I will treat your treasures with the utmost respect and care. Your librarianswill find not a trace that I was there.”Overhead the bells of St. Peter’s began to toll. The camerlegno checked hispocket watch. “I must go.” He paused a taut moment and looked up at Langdon. “Iwill have a Swiss Guard meet you at the archives. I am giving you my trust, Mr.Langdon. Go now.”Langdon was speechless.The young priest now seemed to possess an eerie poise. Reaching over, hesqueezed Langdon’s shoulder with surprising strength. “I want you to find whatyou are looking for. And find it quickly.”"},{"pageContent":"46The Secret Vatican Archives are located at the far end of the Borgia Courtyarddirectly up a hill from the Gate of Santa Ana. They contain over 20,000 volumesand are rumored to hold such treasures as Leonardo da Vinci’s missing diariesand even unpublished books of the Holy Bible.Langdon strode powerfully up the deserted Via della Fondamenta toward thearchives, his mind barely able to accept that he was about to be granted access.Vittoria was at his side, keeping pace effortlessly. Her almond-scented hairtossed lightly in the breeze, and Langdon breathed it in. He felt his thoughtsstraying and reeled himself back.Vittoria said, “You going to tell me what we’re looking for?”“A little book written by a guy named Galileo.”She sounded surprised. “You don’t mess around. What’s in it?”“It is supposed to contain something called il segno.”“The sign?”“Sign, clue, signal… depends on your translation.”“Sign to what?”Langdon picked up the pace. “A secret location. Galileo’s Illuminati needed toprotect themselves from the Vatican, so they founded an ultrasecret Illuminatimeeting place here in Rome. They called it The Church of Illumination.”“Pretty bold calling a satanic lair a church.”Langdon shook his head. “Galileo’s Illuminati were not the least bit satanic.They were scientists who revered enlightenment. Their meeting place was simplywhere they could safely congregate and discuss topics forbidden by the Vatican.Although we know the secret lair existed, to this day nobody has ever locatedit.”“Sounds like the Illuminati know how to keep a secret.”“Absolutely. In fact, they never revealed the location of their hideaway toanyone outside the brotherhood. This secrecy protected them, but it also posed aproblem when it came to recruiting new members.”“They couldn’t grow if they couldn’t advertise,” Vittoria said, her legs andmind keeping perfect pace.“Exactly. Word of Galileo’s brotherhood started to spread in the 1630s, andscientists from around the world made secret pilgrimages to Rome hoping to jointhe Illuminati… eager for a chance to look through Galileo’s telescope and hearthe master’s ideas. Unfortunately, though, because of the Illuminati’s secrecy,scientists arriving in Rome never knew where to go for the meetings or to whomthey could safely speak. The Illuminati wanted new blood, but they could notafford to risk their secrecy by making their whereabouts known.”Vittoria frowned. “Sounds like a situazione senza soluzione.”“Exactly. A catch-22, as we would say.”“So what did they do?”“They were scientists. They examined the problem and found a solution. Abrilliant one, actually. The Illuminati created a kind of ingenious mapdirecting scientists to their sanctuary.”Vittoria looked suddenly skeptical and slowed. “A map? Sounds careless. If acopy fell into the wrong hands…”“It couldn’t,” Langdon said. “No copies existed anywhere. It was not the kind ofmap that fit on paper. It was enormous. A blazed trail of sorts across thecity.”Vittoria slowed even further. “Arrows painted on sidewalks?”“In a sense, yes, but much more subtle. The map consisted of a series ofcarefully concealed symbolic markers placed in public locations around the city.One marker led to the next… and the next… a trail… eventually leading to theIlluminati lair.”Vittoria eyed him askance. “Sounds like a treasure hunt.”Langdon chuckled. “In a manner of speaking, it is. The Illuminati called theirstring of markers ‘The Path of Illumination,’ and anyone who wanted to join thebrotherhood had to follow it all the way to the end. A kind of test.”“But if the Vatican wanted to find the Illuminati,” Vittoria argued, “couldn’tthey simply follow the markers?”“No. The path was hidden. A puzzle, constructed in such a way that only certainpeople would have the ability to track the markers and figure out where theIlluminati church was hidden. The Illuminati intended it as a kind ofinitiation, functioning not only as a security measure but also as a screeningprocess to ensure that only the brightest scientists arrived at their door.”“I don’t buy it. In the 1600s the clergy were some of the most educated men inthe world. If these markers were in public locations, certainly there existedmembers of the Vatican who could have figured it out.”“Sure,” Langdon said, “if they had known about the markers. But they didn’t. Andthey never noticed them because the Illuminati designed them in such a way thatclerics would never suspect what they were. They used a method known insymbology as dissimulation.”“Camouflage.”Langdon was impressed. “You know the term.”“Dissimulacione,” she said. “Nature’s best defense. Try spotting a trumpet fishfloating vertically in seagrass.”“Okay,” Langdon said. “The Illuminati used the same concept. They createdmarkers that faded into the backdrop of ancient Rome. They couldn’t useambigrams or scientific symbology because it would be far too conspicuous, sothey called on an Illuminati artist-the same anonymous prodigy who had createdtheir ambigrammatic symbol ‘Illuminati’-and they commissioned him to carve foursculptures.”“Illuminati sculptures?”“Yes, sculptures with two strict guidelines. First, the sculptures had to looklike the rest of the artwork in Rome… artwork that the Vatican would neversuspect belonged to the Illuminati.”“Religious art.”Langdon nodded, feeling a tinge of excitement, talking faster now. “And thesecond guideline was that the four sculptures had to have very specific themes.Each piece needed to be a subtle tribute to one of the four elements ofscience.”“Four elements?” Vittoria said. “There are over a hundred.”“Not in the 1600s,” Langdon reminded her. “Early alchemists believed the entireuniverse was made up of only four substances: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.”The early cross, Langdon knew, was the most common symbol of the fourelements-four arms representing Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. Beyond that,though, there existed literally dozens of symbolic occurrences of Earth, Air,Fire, and Water throughout history-the Pythagorean cycles of life, the ChineseHong-Fan, the Jungian male and female rudiments, the quadrants of the Zodiac,even the Muslims revered the four ancient elements… although in Islam they wereknown as “squares, clouds, lightning, and waves.” For Langdon, though, it was amore modern usage that always gave him chills-the Mason’s four mystic grades ofAbsolute Initiation: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.Vittoria seemed mystified. “So this Illuminati artist created four pieces of artthat looked religious, but were actually tributes to Earth, Air, Fire, andWater?”“Exactly,” Langdon said, quickly turning up Via Sentinel toward the archives.“The pieces blended into the sea of religious artwork all over Rome. By donatingthe artwork anonymously to specific churches and then using their politicalinfluence, the brotherhood facilitated placement of these four pieces incarefully chosen churches in Rome. Each piece of course was a marker… subtlypointing to the next church… where the next marker awaited. It functioned as atrail of clues disguised as religious art. If an Illuminati candidate could findthe first church and the marker for Earth, he could follow it to Air… and thento Fire… and then to Water… and finally to the Church of Illumination.”Vittoria was looking less and less clear. “And this has something to do withcatching the Illuminati assassin?”Langdon smiled as he played his ace. “Oh, yes. The Illuminati called these fourchurches by a very special name. The Altars of Science.”Vittoria frowned. “I’m sorry, that means noth-” She stopped short. “L’altare discienza?” she exclaimed. “The Illuminati assassin. He warned that the cardinalswould be virgin sacrifices on the altars of science!”Langdon gave her a smile. “Four cardinals. Four churches. The four altars ofscience.”She looked stunned. “You’re saying the four churches where the cardinals will besacrificed are the same four churches that mark the ancient Path ofIllumination?”“I believe so, yes.”“But why would the killer have given us that clue?”“Why not?” Langdon replied. “Very few historians know about these sculptures.Even fewer believe they exist. And their locations have remained secret for fourhundred years. No doubt the Illuminati trusted the secret for another fivehours. Besides, the Illuminati don’t need their Path of Illumination anymore.Their secret lair is probably long gone anyway. They live in the modern world.They meet in bank boardrooms, eating clubs, private golf courses. Tonight theywant to make their secrets public. This is their moment. Their grand unveiling.”Langdon feared the Illuminati unveiling would have a special symmetry to it thathe had not yet mentioned. The four brands. The killer had sworn each cardinalwould be branded with a different symbol. Proof the ancient legends are true,the killer had said. The legend of the four ambigrammatic brands was as old asthe Illuminati itself: earth, air, fire, water-four words crafted in perfectsymmetry. Just like the word Illuminati. Each cardinal was to be branded withone of the ancient elements of science. The rumor that the four brands were inEnglish rather than Italian remained a point of debate among historians. Englishseemed a random deviation from their natural tongue… and the Illuminati didnothing randomly.Langdon turned up the brick pathway before the archive building. Ghastly imagesthrashed in his mind. The overall Illuminati plot was starting to reveal itspatient grandeur. The brotherhood had vowed to stay silent as long as it took,amassing enough influence and power that they could resurface without fear, maketheir stand, fight their cause in broad daylight. The Illuminati were no longerabout hiding. They were about flaunting their power, confirming theconspiratorial myths as fact. Tonight was a global publicity stunt.Vittoria said, “Here comes our escort.” Langdon looked up to see a Swiss Guardhurrying across an adjacent lawn toward the front door.When the guard saw them, he stopped in his tracks. He stared at them, as thoughhe thought he was hallucinating. Without a word he turned away and pulled outhis walkie-talkie. Apparently incredulous at what he was being asked to do, theguard spoke urgently to the person on the other end. The angry bark coming backwas indecipherable to Langdon, but its message was clear. The guard slumped, putaway the walkie-talkie, and turned to them with a look of discontent.Not a word was spoken as the guard guided them into the building. They passedthrough four steel doors, two passkey entries, down a long stairwell, and into afoyer with two combination keypads. Passing through a high-tech series ofelectronic gates, they arrived at the end of a long hallway outside a set ofwide oak double doors. The guard stopped, looked them over again and, mumblingunder his breath, walked to a metal box on the wall. He unlocked it, reachedinside, and pressed a code. The doors before them buzzed, and the deadbolt fellopen.The guard turned, speaking to them for the first time. “The archives are beyondthat door. I have been instructed to escort you this far and return for briefingon another matter.”“You’re leaving?” Vittoria demanded.“Swiss Guards are not cleared for access to the Secret Archives. You are hereonly because my commander received a direct order from the camerlegno.”“But how do we get out?”“Monodirectional security. You will have no difficulties.” That being theentirety of the conversation, the guard spun on his heel and marched off downthe hall.Vittoria made some comment, but Langdon did not hear. His mind was fixed on thedouble doors before him, wondering what mysteries lay beyond."},{"pageContent":"47Although he knew time was short, Camerlegno Carlo Ventresca walked slowly. Heneeded the time alone to gather his thoughts before facing opening prayer. Somuch was happening. As he moved in dim solitude down the Northern Wing, thechallenge of the past fifteen days weighed heavy in his bones.He had followed his holy duties to the letter.As was Vatican tradition, following the Pope’s death the camerlegno hadpersonally confirmed expiration by placing his fingers on the Pope’s carotidartery, listening for breath, and then calling the Pope’s name three times. Bylaw there was no autopsy. Then he had sealed the Pope’s bedroom, destroyed thepapal fisherman’s ring, shattered the die used to make lead seals, and arrangedfor the funeral. That done, he began preparations for the conclave.Conclave, he thought. The final hurdle. It was one of the oldest traditions inChristendom. Nowadays, because the outcome of conclave was usually known beforeit began, the process was criticized as obsolete-more of a burlesque than anelection. The camerlegno knew, however, this was only a lack of understanding.Conclave was not an election. It was an ancient, mystic transference of power.The tradition was timeless… the secrecy, the folded slips of paper, the burningof the ballots, the mixing of ancient chemicals, the smoke signals.As the camerlegno approached through the Loggias of Gregory XIII, he wondered ifCardinal Mortati was in a panic yet. Certainly Mortati had noticed the preferitiwere missing. Without them, the voting would go on all night. Mortati’sappointment as the Great Elector, the camerlegno assured himself, was a goodone. The man was a freethinker and could speak his mind. The conclave would needa leader tonight more than ever.As the camerlegno arrived at the top of the Royal Staircase, he felt as thoughhe were standing on the precipice of his life. Even from up here he could hearthe rumble of activity in the Sistine Chapel below-the uneasy chatter of 165cardinals.One hundred sixty-one cardinals, he corrected.For an instant the camerlegno was falling, plummeting toward hell, peoplescreaming, flames engulfing him, stones and blood raining from the sky.And then silence.When the child awoke, he was in heaven. Everything around him was white. Thelight was blinding and pure. Although some would say a ten year old could notpossibly understand heaven, the young Carlo Ventresca understood heaven verywell. He was in heaven right now. Where else would he be? Even in his shortdecade on earth Carlo had felt the majesty of God-the thundering pipe organs,the towering domes, the voices raised in song, the stained glass, shimmeringbronze and gold. Carlo’s mother, Maria, brought him to Mass every day. Thechurch was Carlo’s home.“Why do we come to Mass every single day?” Carlo asked, not that he minded atall.“Because I promised God I would,” she replied. “And a promise to God is the mostimportant promise of all. Never break a promise to God.”Carlo promised her he would never break a promise to God. He loved his mothermore than anything in the world. She was his holy angel. Sometimes he called herMaria benedetta-the Blessed Mary-although she did not like that at all. He kneltwith her as she prayed, smelling the sweet scent of her flesh and listening tothe murmur of her voice as she counted the rosary. Hail Mary, Mother of God…pray for us sinners… now and at the hour of our death.“Where is my father?” Carlo asked, already knowing his father had died before hewas born.“God is your father, now,” she would always reply. “You are a child of thechurch.”Carlo loved that.“Whenever you feel frightened,” she said, “remember that God is your father now.He will watch over you and protect you forever. God has big plans for you,Carlo.” The boy knew she was right. He could already feel God in his blood.Blood…Blood raining from the sky!Silence. Then heaven.His heaven, Carlo learned as the blinding lights were turned off, was actuallythe Intensive Care Unit in Santa Clara Hospital outside of Palermo. Carlo hadbeen the sole survivor of a terrorist bombing that had collapsed a chapel wherehe and his mother had been attending Mass while on vacation. Thirty-seven peoplehad died, including Carlo’s mother. The papers called Carlo’s survival TheMiracle of St. Francis. Carlo had, for some unknown reason, only moments beforethe blast, left his mother’s side and ventured into a protected alcove to pondera tapestry depicting the story of St. Francis.God called me there, he decided. He wanted to save me.Carlo was delirious with pain. He could still see his mother, kneeling at thepew, blowing him a kiss, and then with a concussive roar, her sweet-smellingflesh was torn apart. He could still taste man’s evil. Blood showered down. Hismother’s blood! The blessed Maria!God will watch over you and protect you forever, his mother had told him.But where was God now!Then, like a worldly manifestation of his mother’s truth, a clergyman had cometo the hospital. He was not any clergyman. He was a bishop. He prayed overCarlo. The Miracle of St. Francis. When Carlo recovered, the bishop arranged forhim to live in a small monastery attached to the cathedral over which the bishoppresided. Carlo lived and tutored with the monks. He even became an altar boyfor his new protector. The bishop suggested Carlo enter public school, but Carlorefused. He could not have been more happy with his new home. He now truly livedin the house of God.Every night Carlo prayed for his mother.God saved me for a reason, he thought. What is the reason?When Carlo turned sixteen, he was obliged by Italian law to serve two years ofreserve military training. The bishop told Carlo that if he entered seminary hewould be exempt from this duty. Carlo told the priest that he planned to enterseminary but that first he needed to understand evil.The bishop did not understand.Carlo told him that if he was going to spend his life in the church fightingevil, first he had to understand it. He could not think of any better place tounderstand evil than in the army. The army used guns and bombs. A bomb killed myBlessed mother!The bishop tried to dissuade him, but Carlo’s mind was made up.“Be careful, my son,” the bishop had said. “And remember the church awaits youwhen you return.”Carlo’s two years of military service had been dreadful. Carlo’s youth had beenone of silence and reflection. But in the army there was no quiet forreflection. Endless noise. Huge machines everywhere. Not a moment of peace.Although the soldiers went to Mass once a week at the barracks, Carlo did notsense God’s presence in any of his fellow soldiers. Their minds were too filledwith chaos to see God.Carlo hated his new life and wanted to go home. But he was determined to stickit out. He had yet to understand evil. He refused to fire a gun, so the militarytaught him how to fly a medical helicopter. Carlo hated the noise and the smell,but at least it let him fly up in the sky and be closer to his mother in heaven.When he was informed his pilot’s training included learning how to parachute,Carlo was terrified. Still, he had no choice.God will protect me, he told himself.Carlo’s first parachute jump was the most exhilarating physical experience ofhis life. It was like flying with God. Carlo could not get enough… the silence…the floating… seeing his mother’s face in the billowing white clouds as hesoared to earth. God has plans for you, Carlo. When he returned from themilitary, Carlo entered the seminary.That had been twenty-three years ago.Now, as Camerlegno Carlo Ventresca descended the Royal Staircase, he tried tocomprehend the chain of events that had delivered him to this extraordinarycrossroads.Abandon all fear, he told himself, and give this night over to God.He could see the great bronze door of the Sistine Chapel now, dutifullyprotected by four Swiss Guards. The guards unbolted the door and pulled it open.Inside, every head turned. The camerlegno gazed out at the black robes and redsashes before him. He understood what God’s plans for him were. The fate of thechurch had been placed in his hands.The camerlegno crossed himself and stepped over the threshold."},{"pageContent":"48BBC journalist Gunther Glick sat sweating in the BBC network van parked on theeastern edge of St. Peter’s Square and cursed his assignment editor. AlthoughGlick’s first monthly review had come back filled with superlatives-resourceful,sharp, dependable-here he was in Vatican City on “Pope-Watch.” He remindedhimself that reporting for the BBC carried a hell of a lot more credibility thanfabricating fodder for the British Tattler, but still, this was not his idea ofreporting.Glick’s assignment was simple. Insultingly simple. He was to sit here waitingfor a bunch of old farts to elect their next chief old fart, then he was to stepoutside and record a fifteen-second “live” spot with the Vatican as a backdrop.Brilliant.Glick couldn’t believe the BBC still sent reporters into the field to cover thisschlock. You don’t see the American networks here tonight. Hell no! That wasbecause the big boys did it right. They watched CNN, synopsized it, and thenfilmed their “live” report in front of a blue screen, superimposing stock videofor a realistic backdrop. MSNBC even used in-studio wind and rain machines togive that on-the-scene authenticity. Viewers didn’t want truth anymore; theywanted entertainment.Glick gazed out through the windshield and felt more and more depressed by theminute. The imperial mountain of Vatican City rose before him as a dismalreminder of what men could accomplish when they put their minds to it.“What have I accomplished in my life?” he wondered aloud. “Nothing.”“So give up,” a woman’s voice said from behind him.Glick jumped. He had almost forgotten he was not alone. He turned to the backseat, where his camerawoman, Chinita Macri, sat silently polishing her glasses.She was always polishing her glasses. Chinita was black, although she preferredAfrican American, a little heavy, and smart as hell. She wouldn’t let you forgetit either. She was an odd bird, but Glick liked her. And Glick could sure ashell use the company.“What’s the problem, Gunth?” Chinita asked.“What are we doing here?”She kept polishing. “Witnessing an exciting event.”“Old men locked in the dark is exciting?”“You do know you’re going to hell, don’t you?”“Already there.”“Talk to me.” She sounded like his mother.“I just feel like I want to leave my mark.”“You wrote for the British Tattler.”“Yeah, but nothing with any resonance.”“Oh, come on, I heard you did a groundbreaking article on the queen’s secret sexlife with aliens.”“Thanks.”“Hey, things are looking up. Tonight you make your first fifteen seconds of TVhistory.”Glick groaned. He could hear the news anchor already. “Thanks Gunther, greatreport.” Then the anchor would roll his eyes and move on to the weather. “Ishould have tried for an anchor spot.”Macri laughed. “With no experience? And that beard? Forget it.”Glick ran his hands through the reddish gob of hair on his chin. “I think itmakes me look clever.”The van’s cell phone rang, mercifully interrupting yet another one of Glick’sfailures. “Maybe that’s editorial,” he said, suddenly hopeful. “You think theywant a live update?”“On this story?” Macri laughed. “You keep dreaming.”Glick answered the phone in his best anchorman voice. “Gunther Glick, BBC, Livein Vatican City.”The man on the line had a thick Arabic accent. “Listen carefully,” he said. “Iam about to change your life.”"},{"pageContent":"49Langdon and Vittoria stood alone now outside the double doors that led to theinner sanctum of the Secret Archives. The decor in the colonnade was anincongruous mix of wall-to-wall carpets over marble floors and wireless securitycameras gazing down from beside carved cherubs in the ceiling. Langdon dubbed itSterile Renaissance. Beside the arched ingress hung a small bronze plaque.ARCHIVIO VATICANOCuratore, Padre Jaqui TomasoFather Jaqui Tomaso. Langdon recognized the curator’s name from the rejectionletters at home in his desk. Dear Mr. Langdon, It is with regret that I amwriting to deny…Regret. Bullshit. Since Jaqui Tomaso’s reign had begun, Langdon had never met asingle non-Catholic American scholar who had been given access to the SecretVatican Archives. Il gaurdiano, historians called him. Jaqui Tomaso was thetoughest librarian on earth.As Langdon pushed the doors open and stepped through the vaulted portal into theinner sanctum, he half expected to see Father Jaqui in full military fatiguesand helmet standing guard with a bazooka. The space, however, was deserted.Silence. Soft lighting.Archivio Vaticano. One of his life dreams.As Langdon’s eyes took in the sacred chamber, his first reaction was one ofembarrassment. He realized what a callow romantic he was. The images he had heldfor so many years of this room could not have been more inaccurate. He hadimagined dusty bookshelves piled high with tattered volumes, priests catalogingby the light of candles and stained-glass windows, monks poring over scrolls…Not even close.At first glance the room appeared to be a darkened airline hangar in whichsomeone had built a dozen free-standing racquetball courts. Langdon knew ofcourse what the glass-walled enclosures were. He was not surprised to see them;humidity and heat eroded ancient vellums and parchments, and proper preservationrequired hermitic vaults like these-airtight cubicles that kept out humidity andnatural acids in the air. Langdon had been inside hermetic vaults many times,but it was always an unsettling experience… something about entering an airtightcontainer where the oxygen was regulated by a reference librarian.The vaults were dark, ghostly even, faintly outlined by tiny dome lights at theend of each stack. In the blackness of each cell, Langdon sensed the phantomgiants, row upon row of towering stacks, laden with history. This was one hellof a collection.Vittoria also seemed dazzled. She stood beside him staring mutely at the gianttransparent cubes.Time was short, and Langdon wasted none of it scanning the dimly lit room for abook catalog-a bound encyclopedia that cataloged the library’s collection. Allhe saw was the glow of a handful of computer terminals dotting the room. “Lookslike they’ve got a Biblion. Their index is computerized.”Vittoria looked hopeful. “That should speed things up.”Langdon wished he shared her enthusiasm, but he sensed this was bad news. Hewalked to a terminal and began typing. His fears were instantly confirmed. “Theold-fashioned method would have been better.”“Why?”He stepped back from the monitor. “Because real books don’t have passwordprotection. I don’t suppose physicists are natural born hackers?”Vittoria shook her head. “I can open oysters, that’s about it.”Langdon took a deep breath and turned to face the eerie collection of diaphanousvaults. He walked to the nearest one and squinted into the dim interior. Insidethe glass were amorphous shapes Langdon recognized as the usual bookshelves,parchment bins, and examination tables. He looked up at the indicator tabsglowing at the end of each stack. As in all libraries, the tabs indicated thecontents of that row. He read the headings as he moved down the transparentbarrier.PIETRO IL ERIMITO… LE CROCIATE… URBANO II… LEVANT…“They’re labeled,” he said, still walking. “But it’s not alpha-author.” Hewasn’t surprised. Ancient archives were almost never cataloged alphabeticallybecause so many of the authors were unknown. Titles didn’t work either becausemany historical documents were untitled letters or parchment fragments. Mostcataloging was done chronologically. Disconcertingly, however, this arrangementdid not appear to be chronological.Langdon felt precious time already slipping away. “Looks like the Vatican hasits own system.”“What a surprise.”He examined the labels again. The documents spanned centuries, but all thekeywords, he realized, were interrelated. “I think it’s a thematicclassification.”“Thematic?” Vittoria said, sounding like a disapproving scientist. “Soundsinefficient.”Actually… Langdon thought, considering it more closely. This may be theshrewdest cataloging I’ve ever seen. He had always urged his students tounderstand the overall tones and motifs of an artistic period rather thangetting lost in the minutia of dates and specific works. The Vatican Archives,it seemed, were cataloged on a similar philosophy. Broad strokes…“Everything in this vault,” Langdon said, feeling more confident now, “centuriesof material, has to do with the Crusades. That’s this vault’s theme.” It was allhere, he realized. Historical accounts, letters, artwork, socio-political data,modern analyses. All in one place… encouraging a deeper understanding of atopic. Brilliant.Vittoria frowned. “But data can relate to multiple themes simultaneously.”“Which is why they cross-reference with proxy markers.” Langdon pointed throughthe glass to the colorful plastic tabs inserted among the documents. “Thoseindicate secondary documents located elsewhere with their primary themes.”“Sure,” she said, apparently letting it go. She put her hands on her hips andsurveyed the enormous space. Then she looked at Langdon. “So, Professor, what’sthe name of this Galileo thing we’re looking for?”Langdon couldn’t help but smile. He still couldn’t fathom that he was standingin this room. It’s in here, he thought. Somewhere in the dark, it’s waiting.“Follow me,” Langdon said. He started briskly down the first aisle, examiningthe indicator tabs of each vault. “Remember how I told you about the Path ofIllumination? How the Illuminati recruited new members using an elaborate test?”“The treasure hunt,” Vittoria said, following closely.“The challenge the Illuminati had was that after they placed the markers, theyneeded some way to tell the scientific community the path existed.”“Logical,” Vittoria said. “Otherwise nobody would know to look for it.”“Yes, and even if they knew the path existed, scientists would have no way ofknowing where the path began. Rome is huge.”“Okay.”Langdon proceeded down the next aisle, scanning the tabs as he talked. “Aboutfifteen years ago, some historians at the Sorbonne and I uncovered a series ofIlluminati letters filled with references to the segno.”“The sign. The announcement about the path and where it began.”“Yes. And since then, plenty of Illuminati academics, myself included, haveuncovered other references to the segno. It is accepted theory now that the clueexists and that Galileo mass distributed it to the scientific community withoutthe Vatican ever knowing.”“How?”“We’re not sure, but most likely printed publications. He published many booksand newsletters over the years.”“That the Vatican no doubt saw. Sounds dangerous.”“True. Nonetheless the segno was distributed.”“But nobody has ever actually found it?”“No. Oddly though, wherever allusions to the segno appear-Masonic diaries,ancient scientific journals, Illuminati letters-it is often referred to by anumber.”“666?”Langdon smiled. “Actually it’s 503.”“Meaning?”“None of us could ever figure it out. I became fascinated with 503, tryingeverything to find meaning in the number-numerology, map references, latitudes.”Langdon reached the end of the aisle, turned the corner, and hurried to scan thenext row of tabs as he spoke. “For many years the only clue seemed to be that503 began with the number five… one of the sacred Illuminati digits.” He paused.“Something tells me you recently figured it out, and that’s why we’re here.”“Correct,” Langdon said, allowing himself a rare moment of pride in his work.“Are you familiar with a book by Galileo called Diаlogo?”“Of course. Famous among scientists as the ultimate scientific sellout.”Sellout wasn’t quite the word Langdon would have used, but he knew what Vittoriameant. In the early 1630s, Galileo had wanted to publish a book endorsing theCopernican heliocentric model of the solar system, but the Vatican would notpermit the book’s release unless Galileo included equally persuasive evidencefor the church’s geocentric model-a model Galileo knew to be dead wrong. Galileohad no choice but to acquiesce to the church’s demands and publish a book givingequal time to both the accurate and inaccurate models.“As you probably know,” Langdon said, “despite Galileo’s compromise, Diаlogo wasstill seen as heretical, and the Vatican placed him under house arrest.”“No good deed goes unpunished.”Langdon smiled. “So true. And yet Galileo was persistent. While under housearrest, he secretly wrote a lesser-known manuscript that scholars often confusewith Diаlogo. That book is called Discorsi.”Vittoria nodded. “I’ve heard of it. Discourses on the Tides.”Langdon stopped short, amazed she had heard of the obscure publication aboutplanetary motion and its effect on the tides.“Hey,” she said, “you’re talking to an Italian marine physicist whose fatherworshiped Galileo.”Langdon laughed. Discorsi however was not what they were looking for. Langdonexplained that Discorsi had not been Galileo’s only work while under housearrest. Historians believed he had also written an obscure booklet calledDiagramma.“Diagramma della Veritа,” Langdon said. “Diagram of Truth.”“Never heard of it.”“I’m not surprised. Diagramma was Galileo’s most secretive work-supposedly somesort of treatise on scientific facts he held to be true but was not allowed toshare. Like some of Galileo’s previous manuscripts, Diagramma was smuggled outof Rome by a friend and quietly published in Holland. The booklet became wildlypopular in the European scientific underground. Then the Vatican caught wind ofit and went on a book-burning campaign.”Vittoria now looked intrigued. “And you think Diagramma contained the clue? Thesegno. The information about the Path of Illumination.”“Diagramma is how Galileo got the word out. That I’m sure of.” Langdon enteredthe third row of vaults and continued surveying the indicator tabs. “Archivistshave been looking for a copy of Diagramma for years. But between the Vaticanburnings and the booklet’s low permanence rating, the booklet has disappearedoff the face of the earth.”“Permanence rating?”“Durability. Archivists rate documents one through ten for their structuralintegrity. Diagramma was printed on sedge papyrus. It’s like tissue paper. Lifespan of no more than a century.”“Why not something stronger?”“Galileo’s behest. To protect his followers. This way any scientists caught witha copy could simply drop it in water and the booklet would dissolve. It wasgreat for destruction of evidence, but terrible for archivists. It is believedthat only one copy of Diagramma survived beyond the eighteenth century.”“One?” Vittoria looked momentarily starstruck as she glanced around the room.“And it’s here?”“Confiscated from the Netherlands by the Vatican shortly after Galileo’s death.I’ve been petitioning to see it for years now. Ever since I realized what was init.”As if reading Langdon’s mind, Vittoria moved across the aisle and began scanningthe adjacent bay of vaults, doubling their pace.“Thanks,” he said. “Look for reference tabs that have anything to do withGalileo, science, scientists. You’ll know it when you see it.”“Okay, but you still haven’t told me how you figured out Diagramma contained theclue. It had something to do with the number you kept seeing in Illuminatiletters? 503?”Langdon smiled. “Yes. It took some time, but I finally figured out that 503 is asimple code. It clearly points to Diagramma.”For an instant Langdon relived his moment of unexpected revelation: August 16.Two years ago. He was standing lakeside at the wedding of the son of acolleague. Bagpipes droned on the water as the wedding party made their uniqueentrance… across the lake on a barge. The craft was festooned with flowers andwreaths. It carried a Roman numeral painted proudly on the hull-DCII.Puzzled by the marking Langdon asked the father of the bride, “What’s with 602?”“602?”Langdon pointed to the barge. “DCII is the Roman numeral for 602.”The man laughed. “That’s not a Roman numeral. That’s the name of the barge.”“The DCII?”The man nodded. “The Dick and Connie II.”Langdon felt sheepish. Dick and Connie were the wedding couple. The bargeobviously had been named in their honor. “What happened to the DCI?”The man groaned. “It sank yesterday during the rehearsal luncheon.”Langdon laughed. “Sorry to hear that.” He looked back out at the barge. TheDCII, he thought. Like a miniature QEII. A second later, it had hit him.Now Langdon turned to Vittoria. “503,” he said, “as I mentioned, is a code. It’san Illuminati trick for concealing what was actually intended as a Romannumeral. The number 503 in Roman numerals is-”“DIII.”Langdon glanced up. “That was fast. Please don’t tell me you’re an Illuminata.”She laughed. “I use Roman numerals to codify pelagic strata.”Of course, Langdon thought. Don’t we all.Vittoria looked over. “So what is the meaning of DIII?”“DI and DII and DIII are very old abbreviations. They were used by ancientscientists to distinguish between the three Galilean documents most commonlyconfused.Vittoria drew a quick breath. “Diаlogo… Discorsi… Diagramma.”“D-one. D-two. D-three. All scientific. All controversial. 503 is DIII.Diagramma. The third of his books.”Vittoria looked troubled. “But one thing still doesn’t make sense. If thissegno, this clue, this advertisement about the Path of Illumination was reallyin Galileo’s Diagramma, why didn’t the Vatican see it when they repossessed allthe copies?”“They may have seen it and not noticed. Remember the Illuminati markers? Hidingthings in plain view? Dissimulation? The segno apparently was hidden the sameway-in plain view. Invisible to those who were not looking for it. And alsoinvisible to those who didn’t understand it.”“Meaning?”“Meaning Galileo hid it well. According to historic record, the segno wasrevealed in a mode the Illuminati called lingua pura.”“The pure language?”“Yes.”“Mathematics?”“That’s my guess. Seems pretty obvious. Galileo was a scientist after all, andhe was writing for scientists. Math would be a logical language in which to layout the clue. The booklet is called Diagramma, so mathematical diagrams may alsobe part of the code.”Vittoria sounded only slightly more hopeful. “I suppose Galileo could havecreated some sort of mathematical code that went unnoticed by the clergy.”“You don’t sound sold,” Langdon said, moving down the row.“I’m not. Mainly because you aren’t. If you were so sure about DIII, why didn’tyou publish? Then someone who did have access to the Vatican Archives could havecome in here and checked out Diagramma a long time ago.”“I didn’t want to publish,” Langdon said. “I had worked hard to find theinformation and-” He stopped himself, embarrassed.“You wanted the glory.”Langdon felt himself flush. “In a manner of speaking. It’s just that-”“Don’t look so embarrassed. You’re talking to a scientist. Publish or perish. AtCERN we call it ‘Substantiate or suffocate.’ ”“It wasn’t only wanting to be the first. I was also concerned that if the wrongpeople found out about the information in Diagramma, it might disappear.”“The wrong people being the Vatican?”“Not that they are wrong, per se, but the church has always downplayed theIlluminati threat. In the early 1900s the Vatican went so far as to say theIlluminati were a figment of overactive imaginations. The clergy felt, andperhaps rightly so, that the last thing Christians needed to know was that therewas a very powerful anti-Christian movement infiltrating their banks, politics,and universities.” Present tense, Robert, he reminded himself. There IS apowerful anti-Christian force infiltrating their banks, politics, anduniversities.“So you think the Vatican would have buried any evidence corroborating theIlluminati threat?”“Quite possibly. Any threat, real or imagined, weakens faith in the church’spower.”“One more question.” Vittoria stopped short and looked at him like he was analien. “Are you serious?”Langdon stopped. “What do you mean?”“I mean is this really your plan to save the day?”Langdon wasn’t sure whether he saw amused pity or sheer terror in her eyes. “Youmean finding Diagramma?”“No, I mean finding Diagramma, locating a four-hundred-year-old segno,deciphering some mathematical code, and following an ancient trail of art thatonly the most brilliant scientists in history have ever been able to follow… allin the next four hours.”Langdon shrugged. “I’m open to other suggestions.”"},{"pageContent":"50Robert Langdon stood outside Archive Vault 9 and read the labels on the stacks.BRAHE… CLAVIUS… COPERNICUS… KEPLER… NEWTON…As he read the names again, he felt a sudden uneasiness. Here are thescientists… but where is Galileo?He turned to Vittoria, who was checking the contents of a nearby vault. “I foundthe right theme, but Galileo’s missing.”“No he isn’t,” she said, frowning as she motioned to the next vault. “He’s overhere. But I hope you brought your reading glasses, because this entire vault ishis.”Langdon ran over. Vittoria was right. Every indictor tab in Vault 10 carried thesame keyword.IL PROCESO GALILEANOLangdon let out a low whistle, now realizing why Galileo had his own vault. “TheGalileo Affair,” he marveled, peering through the glass at the dark outlines ofthe stacks. “The longest and most expensive legal proceeding in Vatican history.Fourteen years and six hundred million lire. It’s all here.”“Have a few legal documents.”“I guess lawyers haven’t evolved much over the centuries.”“Neither have sharks.”Langdon strode to a large yellow button on the side of the vault. He pressed it,and a bank of overhead lights hummed on inside. The lights were deep red,turning the cube into a glowing crimson cell… a maze of towering shelves.“My God,” Vittoria said, looking spooked. “Are we tanning or working?”“Parchment and vellum fades, so vault lighting is always done with dark lights.”“You could go mad in here.”Or worse, Langdon thought, moving toward the vault’s sole entrance. “A quickword of warning. Oxygen is an oxidant, so hermetic vaults contain very little ofit. It’s a partial vacuum inside. Your breathing will feel strained.”“Hey, if old cardinals can survive it.”True, Langdon thought. May we be as lucky.The vault entrance was a single electronic revolving door. Langdon noted thecommon arrangement of four access buttons on the door’s inner shaft, oneaccessible from each compartment. When a button was pressed, the motorized doorwould kick into gear and make the conventional half rotation before grinding toa halt-a standard procedure to preserve the integrity of the inner atmosphere.“After I’m in,” Langdon said, “just press the button and follow me through.There’s only eight percent humidity inside, so be prepared to feel some drymouth.”Langdon stepped into the rotating compartment and pressed the button. The doorbuzzed loudly and began to rotate. As he followed its motion, Langdon preparedhis body for the physical shock that always accompanied the first few seconds ina hermetic vault. Entering a sealed archive was like going from sea level to20,000 feet in an instant. Nausea and light-headedness were not uncommon. Doublevision, double over, he reminded himself, quoting the archivist’s mantra.Langdon felt his ears pop. There was a hiss of air, and the door spun to a stop.He was in.Langdon’s first realization was that the air inside was thinner than he hadanticipated. The Vatican, it seemed, took their archives a bit more seriouslythan most. Langdon fought the gag reflex and relaxed his chest while hispulmonary capillaries dilated. The tightness passed quickly. Enter the Dolphin,he mused, gratified his fifty laps a day were good for something. Breathing morenormally now, he looked around the vault. Despite the transparent outer walls,he felt a familiar anxiety. I’m in a box, he thought. A blood red box.The door buzzed behind him, and Langdon turned to watch Vittoria enter. When shearrived inside, her eyes immediately began watering, and she started breathingheavily.“Give it a minute,” Langdon said. “If you get light-headed, bend over.”“I… feel…” Vittoria choked, “like I’m… scuba diving… with the wrong… mixture.”Langdon waited for her to acclimatize. He knew she would be fine. Vittoria Vetrawas obviously in terrific shape, nothing like the doddering ancient Radcliffealumnae Langdon had once squired through Widener Library’s hermetic vault. Thetour had ended with Langdon giving mouth-to-mouth to an old woman who’d almostaspirated her false teeth.“Feeling better?” he asked.Vittoria nodded.“I rode your damn space plane, so I thought I owed you.”This brought a smile. “Touchй.”Langdon reached into the box beside the door and extracted some white cottongloves.“Formal affair?” Vittoria asked.“Finger acid. We can’t handle the documents without them. You’ll need a pair.”Vittoria donned some gloves. “How long do we have?”Langdon checked his Mickey Mouse watch. “It’s just past seven.”“We have to find this thing within the hour.”“Actually,” Langdon said, “we don’t have that kind of time.” He pointed overheadto a filtered duct. “Normally the curator would turn on a reoxygenation systemwhen someone is inside the vault. Not today. Twenty minutes, we’ll both besucking wind.”Vittoria blanched noticeably in the reddish glow.Langdon smiled and smoothed his gloves. “Substantiate or suffocate, Ms. Vetra.Mickey’s ticking.”"},{"pageContent":"51BBC reporter Gunther Glick stared at the cell phone in his hand for ten secondsbefore he finally hung up.Chinita Macri studied him from the back of the van. “What happened? Who wasthat?”Glick turned, feeling like a child who had just received a Christmas gift hefeared was not really for him. “I just got a tip. Something’s going on insidethe Vatican.”“It’s called conclave,” Chinita said. “Helluva tip.”“No, something else.” Something big. He wondered if the story the caller hadjust told him could possibly be true. Glick felt ashamed when he realized he waspraying it was. “What if I told you four cardinals have been kidnapped and aregoing to be murdered at different churches tonight.”“I’d say you’re being hazed by someone at the office with a sick sense ofhumor.”“What if I told you we were going to be given the exact location of the firstmurder?”“I’d want to know who the hell you just talked to.”“He didn’t say.”“Perhaps because he’s full of shit?”Glick had come to expect Macri’s cynicism, but what she was forgetting was thatliars and lunatics had been Glick’s business for almost a decade at the BritishTattler. This caller had been neither. This man had been coldly sane. Logical. Iwill call you just before eight, the man had said, and tell you where the firstkilling will occur. The images you record will make you famous. When Glick haddemanded why the caller was giving him this information, the answer had been asicy as the man’s Mideastern accent. The media is the right arm of anarchy.“He told me something else too,” Glick said.“What? That Elvis Presley was just elected Pope?”“Dial into the BBC database, will you?” Glick’s adrenaline was pumping now. “Iwant to see what other stories we’ve run on these guys.”“What guys?”“Indulge me.”Macri sighed and pulled up the connection to the BBC database. “This’ll take aminute.”Glick’s mind was swimming. “The caller was very intent to know if I had acameraman.”“Videographer.”“And if we could transmit live.”“One point five three seven megahertz. What is this about?” The database beeped.“Okay, we’re in. Who is it you’re looking for?”Glick gave her the keyword.Macri turned and stared. “I sure as hell hope you’re kidding.”"},{"pageContent":"52The internal organization of Archival Vault 10 was not as intuitive as Langdonhad hoped, and the Diagramma manuscript did not appear to be located with othersimilar Galilean publications. Without access to the computerized Biblion and areference locator, Langdon and Vittoria were stuck.“You’re sure Diagramma is in here?” Vittoria asked.“Positive. It’s a confirmed listing in both the Uficcio della Propaganda delleFede-”“Fine. As long as you’re sure.” She headed left, while he went right.Langdon began his manual search. He needed every bit of self-restraint not tostop and read every treasure he passed. The collection was staggering. TheAssayer… The Starry Messenger… The Sunspot Letters… Letter to the Grand DuchessChristina… Apologia pro Galileo… On and on.It was Vittoria who finally struck gold near the back of the vault. Her throatyvoice called out, “Diagramma della Veritа!”Langdon dashed through the crimson haze to join her. “Where?”Vittoria pointed, and Langdon immediately realized why they had not found itearlier. The manuscript was in a folio bin, not on the shelves. Folio bins werea common means of storing unbound pages. The label on the front of the containerleft no doubt about the contents.DIAGRAMMA DELLA VERITAGalileo Galilei, 1639Langdon dropped to his knees, his heart pounding. “Diagramma.” He gave her agrin. “Nice work. Help me pull out this bin.”Vittoria knelt beside him, and they heaved. The metal tray on which the bin wassitting rolled toward them on castors, revealing the top of the container.“No lock?” Vittoria said, sounding surprised at the simple latch.“Never. Documents sometimes need to be evacuated quickly. Floods and fires.”“So open it.”Langdon didn’t need any encouragement. With his academic life’s dream right infront of him and the thinning air in the chamber, he was in no mood to dawdle.He unsnapped the latch and lifted the lid. Inside, flat on the floor of the bin,lay a black, duck-cloth pouch. The cloth’s breathability was critical to thepreservation of its contents. Reaching in with both hands and keeping the pouchhorizontal, Langdon lifted it out of the bin.“I expected a treasure chest,” Vittoria said. “Looks more like a pillowcase.”“Follow me,” he said. Holding the bag before him like a sacred offering, Langdonwalked to the center of the vault where he found the customary glass-toppedarchival exam table. Although the central location was intended to minimizein-vault travel of documents, researchers appreciated the privacy thesurrounding stacks afforded. Career-making discoveries were uncovered in the topvaults of the world, and most academics did not like rivals peering through theglass as they worked.Langdon lay the pouch on the table and unbuttoned the opening. Vittoria stoodby. Rummaging through a tray of archivist tools, Langdon found the felt-padpincers archivists called finger cymbals-oversized tweezers with flattened diskson each arm. As his excitement mounted, Langdon feared at any moment he mightawake back in Cambridge with a pile of test papers to grade. Inhaling deeply, heopened the bag. Fingers trembling in their cotton gloves, he reached in with histongs.“Relax,” Vittoria said. “It’s paper, not plutonium.”Langdon slid the tongs around the stack of documents inside and was careful toapply even pressure. Then, rather than pulling out the documents, he held themin place while he slid off the bag-an archivist’s procedure for minimizingtorque on the artifact. Not until the bag was removed and Langdon had turned onthe exam darklight beneath the table did he begin breathing again.Vittoria looked like a specter now, lit from below by the lamp beneath theglass. “Small sheets,” she said, her voice reverent.Langdon nodded. The stack of folios before them looked like loose pages from asmall paperback novel. Langdon could see that the top sheet was an ornate penand ink cover sheet with the title, the date, and Galileo’s name in his ownhand.In that instant, Langdon forgot the cramped quarters, forgot his exhaustion,forgot the horrifying situation that had brought him here. He simply stared inwonder. Close encounters with history always left Langdon numbed with reverence…like seeing the brushstrokes on the Mona Lisa.The muted, yellow papyrus left no doubt in Langdon’s mind as to its age andauthenticity, but excluding the inevitable fading, the document was in superbcondition. Slight bleaching of the pigment. Minor sundering and cohesion of thepapyrus. But all in all… in damn fine condition. He studied the ornate handetching of the cover, his vision blurring in the lack of humidity. Vittoria wassilent.“Hand me a spatula, please.” Langdon motioned beside Vittoria to a tray filledwith stainless-steel archival tools. She handed it to him. Langdon took the toolin his hand. It was a good one. He ran his fingers across the face to remove anystatic charge and then, ever so carefully, slid the blade beneath the cover.Then, lifting the spatula, he turned over the cover sheet.The first page was written in longhand, the tiny, stylized calligraphy almostimpossible to read. Langdon immediately noticed that there were no diagrams ornumbers on the page. It was an essay.“Heliocentricity,” Vittoria said, translating the heading on folio one. Shescanned the text. “Looks like Galileo renouncing the geocentric model once andfor all. Ancient Italian, though, so no promises on the translation.”“Forget it,” Langdon said. “We’re looking for math. The pure language.” He usedthe spatula tool to flip the next page. Another essay. No math or diagrams.Langdon’s hands began to sweat inside his gloves.“Movement of the Planets,” Vittoria said, translating the title.Langdon frowned. On any other day, he would have been fascinated to read it;incredibly NASA’s current model of planetary orbits, observed throughhigh-powered telescopes, was supposedly almost identical to Galileo’s originalpredictions.“No math,” Vittoria said. “He’s talking about retrograde motions and ellipticalorbits or something.”Elliptical orbits. Langdon recalled that much of Galileo’s legal trouble hadbegun when he described planetary motion as elliptical. The Vatican exalted theperfection of the circle and insisted heavenly motion must be only circular.Galileo’s Illuminati, however, saw perfection in the ellipse as well, reveringthe mathematical duality of its twin foci. The Illuminati’s ellipse wasprominent even today in modern Masonic tracing boards and footing inlays.“Next,” Vittoria said.Langdon flipped.“Lunar phases and tidal motion,” she said. “No numbers. No diagrams.”Langdon flipped again. Nothing. He kept flipping through a dozen or so pages.Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.“I thought this guy was a mathematician,” Vittoria said. “This is all text.”Langdon felt the air in his lungs beginning to thin. His hopes were thinningtoo. The pile was waning.“Nothing here,” Vittoria said. “No math. A few dates, a few standard figures,but nothing that looks like it could be a clue.”Langdon flipped over the last folio and sighed. It, too, was an essay.“Short book,” Vittoria said, frowning.Langdon nodded.“Merda, as we say in Rome.”Shit is right, Langdon thought. His reflection in the glass seemed mocking, likethe image staring back at him this morning from his bay window. An aging ghost.“There’s got to be something,” he said, the hoarse desperation in his voicesurprising him. “The segno is here somewhere. I know it!”“Maybe you were wrong about DIII?”Langdon turned and stared at her.“Okay,” she agreed, “DIII makes perfect sense. But maybe the clue isn’tmathematical?”“Lingua pura. What else would it be?”“Art?”“Except there are no diagrams or pictures in the book.”“All I know is that lingua pura refers to something other than Italian. Mathjust seems logical.”“I agree.”Langdon refused to accept defeat so quickly. “The numbers must be writtenlonghand. The math must be in words rather than equations.”“It’ll take some time to read all the pages.”“Time’s something we don’t have. We’ll have to split the work.” Langdon flippedthe stack back over to the beginning. “I know enough Italian to spot numbers.”Using his spatula, he cut the stack like a deck of cards and lay the firsthalf-dozen pages in front of Vittoria. “It’s in here somewhere. I’m sure.”Vittoria reached down and flipped her first page by hand.“Spatula!” Langdon said, grabbing her an extra tool from the tray. “Use thespatula.”“I’m wearing gloves,” she grumbled. “How much damage could I cause?”“Just use it.”Vittoria picked up the spatula. “You feeling what I’m feeling?”“Tense?”“No. Short of breath.”Langdon was definitely starting to feel it too. The air was thinning faster thanhe had imagined. He knew they had to hurry. Archival conundrums were nothing newfor him, but usually he had more than a few minutes to work them out. Withoutanother word, Langdon bowed his head and began translating the first page in hisstack.Show yourself, damn it! Show yourself!"},{"pageContent":"53S omewhere beneath Rome the dark figure prowled down a stone ramp into theunderground tunnel. The ancient passageway was lit only by torches, making theair hot and thick. Up ahead the frightened voices of grown men called out invain, echoing in the cramped spaces.As he rounded the corner he saw them, exactly as he had left them-four old men,terrified, sealed behind rusted iron bars in a stone cubicle.“Qui кtes-vous?” one of the men demanded in French. “What do you want with us?”“Hilfe!” another said in German. “Let us go!”“Are you aware who we are?” one asked in English, his accent Spanish.“Silence,” the raspy voice commanded.

Mille… centi… uno, duo, tre… cincuanta. I need anumerical reference! Anything, damnit!When he reached the end of his current folio, he lifted the spatula to flip thepage. As he aligned the blade with the next page, he fumbled, having difficultyholding the tool steady. Minutes later, he looked down and realized he hadabandoned his spatula and was turning pages by hand. Oops, he thought, feelingvaguely criminal. The lack of oxygen was affecting his inhibitions. Looks likeI’ll burn in archivist’s hell.“About damn time,” Vittoria choked when she saw Langdon turning pages by hand.She dropped her spatula and followed suit.“Any luck?”Vittoria shook her head. “Nothing that looks purely mathematical. I’m skimming…but none of this reads like a clue.”Langdon continued translating his folios with increasing difficulty. His Italianskills were rocky at best, and the tiny penmanship and archaic language wasmaking it slow going. Vittoria reached the end of her stack before Langdon andlooked disheartened as she flipped the pages back over. She hunkered down foranother more intense inspection.When Langdon finished his final page, he cursed under his breath and looked overat Vittoria. She was scowling, squinting at something on one of her folios.“What is it?” he asked.Vittoria did not look up. “Did you have any footnotes on your pages?”“Not that I noticed. Why?”“This page has a footnote. It’s obscured in a crease.”Langdon tried to see what she was looking at, but all he could make out was thepage number in the upper right-hand corner of the sheet. Folio 5. It took amoment for the coincidence to register, and even when it did the connectionseemed vague. Folio Five. Five, Pythagoras, pentagrams, Illuminati. Langdonwondered if the Illuminati would have chosen page five on which to hide theirclue. Through the reddish fog surrounding them, Langdon sensed a tiny ray ofhope. “Is the footnote mathematical?”Vittoria shook her head. “Text. One line. Very small printing. Almostillegible.”His hopes faded. “It’s supposed to be math. Lingua pura.”“Yeah, I know.” She hesitated. “I think you’ll want to hear this, though.”Langdon sensed excitement in her voice.“Go ahead.”Squinting at the folio, Vittoria read the line. “The path of light is laid, thesacred test.”The words were nothing like what Langdon had imagined. “I’m sorry?”Vittoria repeated the line. “The path of light is laid, the sacred test.”“Path of light?” Langdon felt his posture straightening.“That’s what it says. Path of light.”As the words sank in, Langdon felt his delirium pierced by an instant ofclarity. The path of light is laid, the sacred test. He had no idea how ithelped them, but the line was as direct a reference to the Path of Illuminationas he could imagine. Path of light. Sacred test. His head felt like an enginerevving on bad fuel. “Are you sure of the translation?”Vittoria hesitated. “Actually…” She glanced over at him with a strange look.“It’s not technically a translation. The line is written in English.”For an instant, Langdon thought the acoustics in the chamber had affected hishearing. “English?”Vittoria pushed the document over to him, and Langdon read the minusculeprinting at the bottom of the page. “The path of light is laid, the sacred test.English? What is English doing in an Italian book?”Vittoria shrugged. She too was looking tipsy. “Maybe English is what they meantby the lingua pura? It’s considered the international language of science. It’sall we speak at CERN.”“But this was in the 1600s,” Langdon argued. “Nobody spoke English in Italy, noteven-” He stopped short, realizing what he was about to say. “Not even… theclergy.” Langdon’s academic mind hummed in high gear. “In the 1600s,” he said,talking faster now, “English was one language the Vatican had not yet embraced.They dealt in Italian, Latin, German, even Spanish and French, but English wastotally foreign inside the Vatican. They considered English a polluted,free-thinkers language for profane men like Chaucer and Shakespeare.” Langdonflashed suddenly on the Illuminati brands of Earth, Air, Fire, Water. The legendthat the brands were in English now made a bizarre kind of sense.“So you’re saying maybe Galileo considered English la lingua pura because it wasthe one language the Vatican did not control?”“Yes. Or maybe by putting the clue in English, Galileo was subtly restrictingthe readership away from the Vatican.”“But it’s not even a clue,” Vittoria argued. “The path of light is laid, thesacred test? What the hell does that mean?”She’s right, Langdon thought. The line didn’t help in any way. But as he spokethe phrase again in his mind, a strange fact hit him. Now that’s odd, hethought. What are the chances of that?“We need to get out of here,” Vittoria said, sounding hoarse.Langdon wasn’t listening. The path of light is laid, the sacred test. “It’s adamn line of iambic pentameter,” he said suddenly, counting the syllables again.“Five couplets of alternating stressed and unstressed syllables.”Vittoria looked lost. “Iambic who?”For an instant Langdon was back at Phillips Exeter Academy sitting in a Saturdaymorning English class. Hell on earth. The school baseball star, Peter Greer, washaving trouble remembering the number of couplets necessary for a line ofShakespearean iambic pentameter. Their professor, an animated schoolmaster namedBissell, leapt onto the table and bellowed, “Penta-meter, Greer! Think of homeplate! A penta-gon! Five sides! Penta! Penta! Penta! Jeeeesh!”Five couplets, Langdon thought. Each couplet, by definition, having twosyllables. He could not believe in his entire career he had never made theconnection. Iambic pentameter was a symmetrical meter based on the sacredIlluminati numbers of 5 and 2!You’re reaching! Langdon told himself, trying to push it from his mind. Ameaningless coincidence! But the thought stuck. Five… for Pythagoras and thepentagram. Two… for the duality of all things.A moment later, another realization sent a numbing sensation down his legs.Iambic pentameter, on account of its simplicity, was often called “pure verse”or “pure meter.” La lingua pura? Could this have been the pure language theIlluminati had been referring to? The path of light is laid, the sacred test…“Uh oh,” Vittoria said.Langdon wheeled to see her rotating the folio upside down. He felt a knot in hisgut. Not again. “There’s no way that line is an ambigram!”“No, it’s not an ambigram… but it’s…” She kept turning the document, 90 degreesat every turn.“It’s what?”Vittoria looked up. “It’s not the only line.”“There’s another?”“There’s a different line on every margin. Top, bottom, left, and right. I thinkit’s a poem.”“Four lines?” Langdon bristled with excitement. Galileo was a poet? “Let mesee!”Vittoria did not relinquish the page. She kept turning the page in quarterturns. “I didn’t see the lines before because they’re on the edges.” She cockedher head over the last line. “Huh. You know what? Galileo didn’t even writethis.”“What!”“The poem is signed John Milton.”“John Milton?” The influential English poet who wrote Paradise Lost was acontemporary of Galileo’s and a savant who conspiracy buffs put at the top oftheir list of Illuminati suspects. Milton’s alleged affiliation with Galileo’sIlluminati was one legend Langdon suspected was true. Not only had Milton made awell-documented 1638 pilgrimage to Rome to “commune with enlightened men,” buthe had held meetings with Galileo during the scientist’s house arrest, meetingsportrayed in many Renaissance paintings, including Annibale Gatti’s famousGalileo and Milton, which hung even now in the IMSS Museum in Florence.“Milton knew Galileo, didn’t he?” Vittoria said, finally pushing the folio overto Langdon. “Maybe he wrote the poem as a favor?”Langdon clenched his teeth as he took the sheathed document. Leaving it flat onthe table, he read the line at the top. Then he rotated the page 90 degrees,reading the line in the right margin. Another twist, and he read the bottom.Another twist, the left. A final twist completed the circle. There were fourlines in all. The first line Vittoria had found was actually the third line ofthe poem. Utterly agape, he read the four lines again, clockwise in sequence:top, right, bottom, left. When he was done, he exhaled. There was no doubt inhis mind. “You found it, Ms. Vetra.”She smiled tightly. “Good, now can we get the hell out of here?”“I have to copy these lines down. I need to find a pencil and paper.”Vittoria shook her head. “Forget it, professor. No time to play scribe. Mickey’sticking.” She took the page from him and headed for the door.Langdon stood up. “You can’t take that outside! It’s a-”But Vittoria was already gone."},{"pageContent":"55Langdon and Vittoria exploded onto the courtyard outside the Secret Archives.The fresh air felt like a drug as it flowed into Langdon’s lungs. The purplespots in his vision quickly faded. The guilt, however, did not. He had just beenaccomplice to stealing a priceless relic from the world’s most private vault.The camerlegno had said, I am giving you my trust.“Hurry,” Vittoria said, still holding the folio in her hand and striding at ahalf-jog across Via Borgia in the direction of Olivetti’s office.“If any water gets on that papyrus-”“Calm down. When we decipher this thing, we can return their sacred Folio 5.”Langdon accelerated to keep up. Beyond feeling like a criminal, he was stilldazed over the document’s spellbinding implications. John Milton was anIlluminatus. He composed the poem for Galileo to publish in Folio 5… far fromthe eyes of the Vatican.As they left the courtyard, Vittoria held out the folio for Langdon. “You thinkyou can decipher this thing? Or did we just kill all those brain cells forkicks?”Langdon took the document carefully in his hands. Without hesitation he slippedit into one of the breast pockets of his tweed jacket, out of the sunlight anddangers of moisture. “I deciphered it already.”Vittoria stopped short. “You what?”Langdon kept moving.Vittoria hustled to catch up. “You read it once! I thought it was supposed to behard!”Langdon knew she was right, and yet he had deciphered the segno in a singlereading. A perfect stanza of iambic pentameter, and the first altar of sciencehad revealed itself in pristine clarity. Admittedly, the ease with which he hadaccomplished the task left him with a nagging disquietude. He was a child of thePuritan work ethic. He could still hear his father speaking the old New Englandaphorism: If it wasn’t painfully difficult, you did it wrong. Langdon hoped thesaying was false. “I deciphered it,” he said, moving faster now. “I know wherethe first killing is going to happen. We need to warn Olivetti.”Vittoria closed in on him. “How could you already know? Let me see that thingagain.” With the sleight of a boxer, she slipped a lissome hand into his pocketand pulled out the folio again.“Careful!” Langdon said. “You can’t-”Vittoria ignored him. Folio in hand, she floated beside him, holding thedocument up to the evening light, examining the margins. As she began readingaloud, Langdon moved to retrieve the folio but instead found himself bewitchedby Vittoria’s accented alto speaking the syllables in perfect rhythm with hergait.For a moment, hearing the verse aloud, Langdon felt transported in time… asthough he were one of Galileo’s contemporaries, listening to the poem for thefirst time… knowing it was a test, a map, a clue unveiling the four altars ofscience… the four markers that blazed a secret path across Rome. The verseflowed from Vittoria’s lips like a song.From Santi’s earthly tomb with demon’s hole,‘Cross Rome the mystic elements unfold.The path of light is laid, the sacred test,Let angels guide you on your lofty quest.Vittoria read it twice and then fell silent, as if letting the ancient wordsresonate on their own.From Santi’s earthly tomb, Langdon repeated in his mind. The poem was crystalclear about that. The Path of Illumination began at Santi’s tomb. From there,across Rome, the markers blazed the trail.From Santi’s earthly tomb with demon’s hole,‘Cross Rome the mystic elements unfold.Mystic elements. Also clear. Earth, Air, Fire, Water. Elements of science, thefour Illuminati markers disguised as religious sculpture.“The first marker,” Vittoria said, “sounds like it’s at Santi’s tomb.”Langdon smiled. “I told you it wasn’t that tough.”“So who is Santi?” she asked, sounding suddenly excited. “And where’s his tomb?”Langdon chuckled to himself. He was amazed how few people knew Santi, the lastname of one of the most famous Renaissance artists ever to live. His first namewas world renowned… the child prodigy who at the age of twenty-five was alreadydoing commissions for Pope Julius II, and when he died at only thirty-eight,left behind the greatest collection of frescoes the world had ever seen. Santiwas a behemoth in the art world, and being known solely by one’s first name wasa level of fame achieved only by an elite few… people like Napoleon, Galileo,and Jesus… and, of course, the demigods Langdon now heard blaring from Harvarddormitories-Sting, Madonna, Jewel, and the artist formerly known as Prince, whohad changed his name to the symbol [images/00004.jpg], causing Langdon to dubhim “The Tau Cross With Intersecting Hermaphroditic Ankh.”“Santi,” Langdon said, “is the last name of the great Renaissance master,Raphael.”Vittoria looked surprised. “Raphael? As in the Raphael?”“The one and only.” Langdon pushed on toward the Office of the Swiss Guard.“So the path starts at Raphael’s tomb?”“It actually makes perfect sense,” Langdon said as they rushed on. “TheIlluminati often considered great artists and sculptors honorary brothers inenlightenment. The Illuminati could have chosen Raphael’s tomb as a kind oftribute.” Langdon also knew that Raphael, like many other religious artists, wasa suspected closet atheist.Vittoria slipped the folio carefully back in Langdon’s pocket. “So where is heburied?”Langdon took a deep breath. “Believe it or not, Raphael’s buried in thePantheon.”Vittoria looked skeptical. “The Pantheon?”“The Raphael at the Pantheon.” Langdon had to admit, the Pantheon was not whathe had expected for the placement of the first marker. He would have guessed thefirst altar of science to be at some quiet, out of the way church, somethingsubtle. Even in the 1600s, the Pantheon, with its tremendous, holed dome, wasone of the best known sites in Rome.“Is the Pantheon even a church?” Vittoria asked.“Oldest Catholic church in Rome.”Vittoria shook her head. “But do you really think the first cardinal could bekilled at the Pantheon? That’s got to be one of the busiest tourist spots inRome.”Langdon shrugged. “The Illuminati said they wanted the whole world watching.Killing a cardinal at the Pantheon would certainly open some eyes.”“But how does this guy expect to kill someone at the Pantheon and get awayunnoticed? It would be impossible.”“As impossible as kidnapping four cardinals from Vatican City? The poem isprecise.”“And you’re certain Raphael is buried inside the Pantheon?”“I’ve seen his tomb many times.”Vittoria nodded, still looking troubled. “What time is it?”Langdon checked. “Seven-thirty.”“Is the Pantheon far?”“A mile maybe. We’ve got time.”“The poem said Santi’s earthly tomb. Does that mean anything to you?”Langdon hastened diagonally across the Courtyard of the Sentinel. “Earthly?Actually, there’s probably no more earthly place in Rome than the Pantheon. Itgot its name from the original religion practiced there-Pantheism-the worship ofall gods, specifically the pagan gods of Mother Earth.”As a student of architecture, Langdon had been amazed to learn that thedimensions of the Pantheon’s main chamber were a tribute to Gaea-the goddess ofthe Earth. The proportions were so exact that a giant spherical globe could fitperfectly inside the building with less than a millimeter to spare.“Okay,” Vittoria said, sounding more convinced. “And demon’s hole? From Santi’searthly tomb with demon’s hole?”Langdon was not quite as sure about this. “Demon’s hole must mean the oculus,”he said, making a logical guess. “The famous circular opening in the Pantheon’sroof.”“But it’s a church,” Vittoria said, moving effortlessly beside him. “Why wouldthey call the opening a demon’s hole?”Langdon had actually been wondering that himself. He had never heard the term“demon’s hole,” but he did recall a famous sixth-century critique of thePantheon whose words seemed oddly appropriate now. The Venerable Bede had oncewritten that the hole in the Pantheon’s roof had been bored by demons trying toescape the building when it was consecrated by Boniface IV.“And why,” Vittoria added as they entered a smaller courtyard, “why would theIlluminati use the name Santi if he was really known as Raphael?”“You ask a lot of questions.”“My dad used to say that.”“Two possible reasons. One, the word Raphael has too many syllables. It wouldhave destroyed the poem’s iambic pentameter.”“Sounds like a stretch.”Langdon agreed. “Okay, then maybe using ‘Santi’ was to make the clue moreobscure, so only very enlightened men would recognize the reference to Raphael.”Vittoria didn’t appear to buy this either. “I’m sure Raphael’s last name wasvery well known when he was alive.”“Surprisingly not. Single name recognition was a status symbol. Raphael shunnedhis last name much like pop stars do today. Take Madonna, for example. She neveruses her surname, Ciccone.”Vittoria looked amused. “You know Madonna’s last name?”Langdon regretted the example. It was amazing the kind of garbage a mind pickedup living with 10,000 adolescents.As he and Vittoria passed the final gate toward the Office of the Swiss Guard,their progress was halted without warning.“Para!” a voice bellowed behind them.Langdon and Vittoria wheeled to find themselves looking into the barrel of arifle.“Attento!” Vittoria exclaimed, jumping back. “Watch it with-”“Non sportarti!” the guard snapped, cocking the weapon.“Soldato!” a voice commanded from across the courtyard. Olivetti was emergingfrom the security center. “Let them go!”The guard looked bewildered. “Ma, signore, и una donna-”“Inside!” he yelled at the guard.“Signore, non posso-”“Now! You have new orders. Captain Rocher will be briefing the corps in twominutes. We will be organizing a search.”Looking bewildered, the guard hurried into the security center. Olivetti marchedtoward Langdon, rigid and steaming. “Our most secret archives? I’ll want anexplanation.”“We have good news,” Langdon said.Olivetti’s eyes narrowed. “It better be damn good.”"},{"pageContent":"56The four unmarked Alpha Romeo 155 T-Sparks roared down Via dei Coronari likefighter jets off a runway. The vehicles carried twelve plainclothed Swiss Guardsarmed with Cherchi-Pardini semiautomatics, local-radius nerve gas canisters, andlong-range stun guns. The three sharpshooters carried laser-sighted rifles.Sitting in the passenger seat of the lead car, Olivetti turned backward towardLangdon and Vittoria. His eyes were filled with rage. “You assured me a soundexplanation, and this is what I get?”Langdon felt cramped in the small car. “I understand your-”“No, you don’t understand!” Olivetti never raised his voice, but his intensitytripled. “I have just removed a dozen of my best men from Vatican City on theeve of conclave. And I have done this to stake out the Pantheon based on thetestimony of some American I have never met who has just interpreted afour-hundred-year-old poem. I have also just left the search for this antimatterweapon in the hands of secondary officers.”Langdon resisted the urge to pull Folio 5 from his pocket and wave it inOlivetti’s face. “All I know is that the information we found refers toRaphael’s tomb, and Raphael’s tomb is inside the Pantheon.”The officer behind the wheel nodded. “He’s right, commander. My wife and I-”“Drive,” Olivetti snapped. He turned back to Langdon. “How could a killeraccomplish an assassination in such a crowded place and escape unseen?”“I don’t know,” Langdon said. “But the Illuminati are obviously highlyresourceful. They’ve broken into both CERN and Vatican City. It’s only by luckthat we know where the first kill zone is. The Pantheon is your one chance tocatch this guy.”“More contradictions,” Olivetti said. “One chance? I thought you said there wassome sort of pathway. A series of markers. If the Pantheon is the right spot, wecan follow the pathway to the other markers. We will have four chances to catchthis guy.”“I had hoped so,” Langdon said. “And we would have… a century ago.”Langdon’s realization that the Pantheon was the first altar of science had beena bittersweet moment. History had a way of playing cruel tricks on those whochased it. It was a long shot that the Path of Illumination would be intactafter all of these years, with all of its statues in place, but part of Langdonhad fantasized about following the path all the way to the end and coming faceto face with the sacred Illuminati lair. Alas, he realized, it was not to be.“The Vatican had all the statues in the Pantheon removed and destroyed in thelate 1800s.”Vittoria looked shocked. “Why?”“The statues were pagan Olympian Gods. Unfortunately, that means the firstmarker is gone… and with it-”“Any hope,” Vittoria said, “of finding the Path of Illumination and additionalmarkers?”Langdon shook his head. “We have one shot. The Pantheon. After that, the pathdisappears.”Olivetti stared at them both a long moment and then turned and faced front.“Pull over,” he barked to the driver.The driver swerved the car toward the curb and put on the brakes. Three otherAlpha Romeos skidded in behind them. The Swiss Guard convoy screeched to a halt.“What are you doing!” Vittoria demanded.“My job,” Olivetti said, turning in his seat, his voice like stone. “Mr.Langdon, when you told me you would explain the situation en route, I assumed Iwould be approaching the Pantheon with a clear idea of why my men are here. Thatis not the case. Because I am abandoning critical duties by being here, andbecause I have found very little that makes sense in this theory of yours aboutvirgin sacrifices and ancient poetry, I cannot in good conscience continue. I amrecalling this mission immediately.” He pulled out his walkie-talkie and clickedit on.Vittoria reached across the seat and grabbed his arm. “You can’t!”Olivetti slammed down the walkie-talkie and fixed her with a red-hot stare.“Have you been to the Pantheon, Ms. Vetra?”“No, but I-”“Let me tell you something about it. The Pantheon is a single room. A circularcell made of stone and cement. It has one entrance. No windows. One narrowentrance. That entrance is flanked at all times by no less than four armed Romanpolicemen who protect this shrine from art defacers, anti-Christian terrorists,and gypsy tourist scams.”“Your point?” she said coolly.“My point?” Olivetti’s knuckles gripped the seat. “My point is that what youhave just told me is going to happen is utterly impossible! Can you give me oneplausible scenario of how someone could kill a cardinal inside the Pantheon? Howdoes one even get a hostage past the guards into the Pantheon in the firstplace? Much less actually kill him and get away?” Olivetti leaned over the seat,his coffee breath now in Langdon’s face. “How, Mr. Langdon? One plausiblescenario.”Langdon felt the tiny car shrink around him. I have no idea! I’m not anassassin! I don’t know how he will do it! I only know-“One scenario?” Vittoria quipped, her voice unruffled. “How about this? Thekiller flies over in a helicopter and drops a screaming, branded cardinal downthrough the hole in the roof. The cardinal hits the marble floor and dies.”Everyone in the car turned and stared at Vittoria. Langdon didn’t know what tothink. You’ve got one sick imagination, lady, but you are quick.Olivetti frowned. “Possible, I admit… but hardly-”“Or the killer drugs the cardinal,” Vittoria said, “brings him to the Pantheonin a wheelchair like some old tourist. He wheels him inside, quietly slits histhroat, and then walks out.”This seemed to wake up Olivetti a bit.Not bad! Langdon thought.“Or,” she said, “the killer could-”“I heard you,” Olivetti said. “Enough.” He took a deep breath and blew it out.Someone rapped sharply on the window, and everyone jumped. It was a soldier fromone of the other cars. Olivetti rolled down the window.“Everything all right, commander?” The soldier was dressed in street clothes. Hepulled back the sleeve of his denim shirt to reveal a black chronograph militarywatch. “Seven-forty, commander. We’ll need time to get in position.”Olivetti nodded vaguely but said nothing for many moments. He ran a finger backand forth across the dash, making a line in the dust. He studied Langdon in theside-view mirror, and Langdon felt himself being measured and weighed. FinallyOlivetti turned back to the guard. There was reluctance in his voice. “I’ll wantseparate approaches. Cars to Piazza della Rotunda, Via delgi Orfani, PiazzaSant’Ignacio, and Sant’Eustachio. No closer than two blocks. Once you’re parked,gear up and await my orders. Three minutes.”“Very good, sir.” The soldier returned to his car.Langdon gave Vittoria an impressed nod. She smiled back, and for an instantLangdon felt an unexpected connection… a thread of magnetism between them.The commander turned in his seat and locked eyes with Langdon. “Mr. Langdon,this had better not blow up in our faces.”Langdon smiled uneasily. How could it?"},{"pageContent":"57The director of CERN, Maximilian Kohler, opened his eyes to the cool rush ofcromolyn and leukotriene in his body, dilating his bronchial tubes and pulmonarycapillaries. He was breathing normally again. He found himself lying in aprivate room in the CERN infirmary, his wheelchair beside the bed.He took stock, examining the paper robe they had put him in. His clothing wasfolded on the chair beside the bed. Outside he could hear a nurse making therounds. He lay there a long minute listening. Then, as quietly as possible, hepulled himself to the edge of the bed and retrieved his clothing. Strugglingwith his dead legs, he dressed himself. Then he dragged his body onto hiswheelchair.Muffling a cough, he wheeled himself to the door. He moved manually, careful notto engage the motor. When he arrived at the door he peered out. The hall wasempty.Silently, Maximilian Kohler slipped out of the infirmary."},{"pageContent":"58Seven-forty-six and thirty… mark.“ Even speaking into his walkie-talkie,Olivetti’s voice never seemed to rise above a whisper.Langdon felt himself sweating now in his Harris tweed in the backseat of theAlpha Romeo, which was idling in Piazza de la Concorde, three blocks from thePantheon. Vittoria sat beside him, looking engrossed by Olivetti, who wastransmitting his final orders.“Deployment will be an eight-point hem,” the commander said. “Full perimeterwith a bias on the entry. Target may know you visually, so you will bepas-visible. Nonmortal force only. We’ll need someone to spot the roof. Targetis primary. Asset secondary.”Jesus, Langdon thought, chilled by the efficiency with which Olivetti had justtold his men the cardinal was expendable. Asset secondary.“I repeat. Nonmortal procurement. We need the target alive. Go.” Olivettisnapped off his walkie-talkie.Vittoria looked stunned, almost angry. “Commander, isn’t anyone going inside?”Olivetti turned. “Inside?”“Inside the Pantheon! Where this is supposed to happen?”“Attento,” Olivetti said, his eyes fossilizing. “If my ranks have beeninfiltrated, my men may be known by sight. Your colleague has just finishedwarning me that this will be our sole chance to catch the target. I have nointention of scaring anyone off by marching my men inside.”“But what if the killer is already inside?”Olivetti checked his watch. “The target was specific. Eight o’clock. We havefifteen minutes.”“He said he would kill the cardinal at eight o’clock. But he may already havegotten the victim inside somehow. What if your men see the target come out butdon’t know who he is? Someone needs to make sure the inside is clean.”“Too risky at this point.”“Not if the person going in was unrecognizable.”“Disguising operatives is time consuming and-”“I meant me,” Vittoria said.Langdon turned and stared at her.Olivetti shook his head. “Absolutely not.”“He killed my father.”“Exactly, so he may know who you are.”“You heard him on the phone. He had no idea Leonardo Vetra even had a daughter.He sure as hell doesn’t know what I look like. I could walk in like a tourist.If I see anything suspicious, I could walk into the square and signal your mento move in.”“I’m sorry, I cannot allow that.”“Comandante?” Olivetti’s receiver crackled. “We’ve got a situation from thenorth point. The fountain is blocking our line of sight. We can’t see theentrance unless we move into plain view on the piazza. What’s your call? Do youwant us blind or vulnerable?”Vittoria apparently had endured enough. “That’s it. I’m going.” She opened herdoor and got out.Olivetti dropped his walkie-talkie and jumped out of the car, circling in frontof Vittoria.Langdon got out too. What the hell is she doing!Olivetti blocked Vittoria’s way. “Ms. Vetra, your instincts are good, but Icannot let a civilian interfere.”“Interfere? You’re flying blind. Let me help.”“I would love to have a recon point inside, but…”“But what?” Vittoria demanded. “But I’m a woman?”Olivetti said nothing.“That had better not be what you were going to say, Commander, because you knowdamn well this is a good idea, and if you let some archaic macho bullshit-”“Let us do our job.”“Let me help.”“Too dangerous. We would have no lines of communication with you. I can’t letyou carry a walkie-talkie, it would give you away.”Vittoria reached in her shirt pocket and produced her cell phone. “Plenty oftourists carry phones.”Olivetti frowned.Vittoria unsnapped the phone and mimicked a call. “Hi, honey, I’m standing inthe Pantheon. You should see this place!” She snapped the phone shut and glaredat Olivetti. “Who the hell is going to know? It is a no-risk situation. Let mebe your eyes!” She motioned to the cell phone on Olivetti’s belt. “What’s yournumber?”Olivetti did not reply.The driver had been looking on and seemed to have some thoughts of his own. Hegot out of the car and took the commander aside. They spoke in hushed tones forten seconds. Finally Olivetti nodded and returned. “Program this number.” Hebegan dictating digits.Vittoria programmed her phone.“Now call the number.”Vittoria pressed the auto dial. The phone on Olivetti’s belt began ringing. Hepicked it up and spoke into the receiver. “Go into the building, Ms. Vetra, lookaround, exit the building, then call and tell me what you see.”Vittoria snapped the phone shut. “Thank you, sir.”Langdon felt a sudden, unexpected surge of protective instinct. “Wait a minute,”he said to Olivetti. “You’re sending her in there alone.”Vittoria scowled at him. “Robert, I’ll be fine.”The Swiss Guard driver was talking to Olivetti again.“It’s dangerous,” Langdon said to Vittoria.“He’s right,” Olivetti said. “Even my best men don’t work alone. My lieutenanthas just pointed out that the masquerade will be more convincing with both ofyou anyway.”Both of us? Langdon hesitated. Actually, what I meant-“Both of you entering together,” Olivetti said, “will look like a couple onholiday. You can also back each other up. I’m more comfortable with that.”Vittoria shrugged. “Fine, but we’ll need to go fast.”Langdon groaned. Nice move, cowboy.Olivetti pointed down the street. “First street you hit will be Via degliOrfani. Go left. It takes you directly to the Pantheon. Two-minute walk, tops.I’ll be here, directing my men and waiting for your call. I’d like you to haveprotection.” He pulled out his pistol. “Do either of you know how to use a gun?”Langdon’s heart skipped. We don’t need a gun!Vittoria held her hand out. “I can tag a breaching porpoise from forty metersoff the bow of a rocking ship.”“Good.” Olivetti handed the gun to her. “You’ll have to conceal it.”Vittoria glanced down at her shorts. Then she looked at Langdon.Oh no you don’t! Langdon thought, but Vittoria was too fast. She opened hisjacket, and inserted the weapon into one of his breast pockets. It felt like arock dropping into his coat, his only consolation being that Diagramma was inthe other pocket.“We look harmless,” Vittoria said. “We’re leaving.” She took Langdon’s arm andheaded down the street.The driver called out, “Arm in arm is good. Remember, you’re tourists. Newlywedseven. Perhaps if you held hands?”As they turned the corner Langdon could have sworn he saw on Vittoria’s face thehint of a smile."},{"pageContent":"59The Swiss Guard “staging room” is located adjacent to the Corpo di Vigilanzabarracks and is used primarily for planning the security surrounding papalappearances and public Vatican events. Today, however, it was being used forsomething else.The man addressing the assembled task force was the second-in-command of theSwiss Guard, Captain Elias Rocher. Rocher was a barrel-chested man with soft,puttylike features. He wore the traditional blue captain’s uniform with his ownpersonal flair-a red beret cocked sideways on his head. His voice wassurprisingly crystalline for such a large man, and when he spoke, his tone hadthe clarity of a musical instrument. Despite the precision of his inflection,Rocher’s eyes were cloudy like those of some nocturnal mammal. His men calledhim “orso”-grizzly bear. They sometimes joked that Rocher was “the bear whowalked in the viper’s shadow.” Commander Olivetti was the viper. Rocher was justas deadly as the viper, but at least you could see him coming.Rocher’s men stood at sharp attention, nobody moving a muscle, although theinformation they had just received had increased their aggregate blood pressureby a few thousand points.Rookie Lieutenant Chartrand stood in the back of the room wishing he had beenamong the 99 percent of applicants who had not qualified to be here. At twentyyears old, Chartrand was the youngest guard on the force. He had been in VaticanCity only three months. Like every man there, Chartrand was Swiss Army trainedand had endured two years of additional ausbilding in Bern before qualifying forthe grueling Vatican prтva held in a secret barracks outside of Rome. Nothing inhis training, however, had prepared him for a crisis like this.At first Chartrand thought the briefing was some sort of bizarre trainingexercise. Futuristic weapons? Ancient cults? Kidnapped cardinals? Then Rocherhad shown them the live video feed of the weapon in question. Apparently thiswas no exercise.“We will be killing power in selected areas,” Rocher was saying, “to eradicateextraneous magnetic interference. We will move in teams of four. We will wearinfrared goggles for vision. Reconnaissance will be done with traditional bugsweepers, recalibrated for sub-three-ohm flux fields. Any questions?”None.Chartrand’s mind was on overload. “What if we don’t find it in time?” he asked,immediately wishing he had not.The grizzly bear gazed out at him from beneath his red beret. Then he dismissedthe group with a somber salute. “Godspeed, men.”"},{"pageContent":"60Two blocks from the Pantheon, Langdon and Vittoria approached on foot past aline of taxis, their drivers sleeping in the front seats. Nap time was eternalin the Eternal City-the ubiquitous public dozing a perfected extension of theafternoon siestas born of ancient Spain.Langdon fought to focus his thoughts, but the situation was too bizarre to grasprationally. Six hours ago he had been sound asleep in Cambridge. Now he was inEurope, caught up in a surreal battle of ancient titans, packing a semiautomaticin his Harris tweed, and holding hands with a woman he had only just met.He looked at Vittoria. She was focused straight ahead. There was a strength inher grasp-that of an independent and determined woman. Her fingers wrappedaround his with the comfort of innate acceptance. No hesitation. Langdon felt agrowing attraction. Get real, he told himself.Vittoria seemed to sense his uneasiness. “Relax,” she said, without turning herhead. “We’re supposed to look like newlyweds.”“I’m relaxed.”“You’re crushing my hand.”Langdon flushed and loosened up.“Breathe through your eyes,” she said.“I’m sorry?”“It relaxes the muscles. It’s called pranayama.”“Piranha?”“Not the fish. Pranayama. Never mind.”As they rounded the corner into Piazza della Rotunda, the Pantheon rose beforethem. Langdon admired it, as always, with awe. The Pantheon. Temple to all gods.Pagan gods. Gods of Nature and Earth. The structure seemed boxier from theoutside than he remembered. The vertical pillars and triangular pronaus all butobscured the circular dome behind it. Still, the bold and immodest inscriptionover the entrance assured him they were in the right spot. M AGRIPPA L F COSTERTIUM FECIT. Langdon translated it, as always, with amusement. Marcus Agrippa,Consul for the third time, built this.So much for humility, he thought, turning his eyes to the surrounding area. Ascattering of tourists with video cameras wandered the area. Others sat enjoyingRome’s best iced coffee at La Tazza di Oro’s outdoor cafe. Outside the entranceto the Pantheon, four armed Roman policemen stood at attention just as Olivettihad predicted.“Looks pretty quiet,” Vittoria said.Langdon nodded, but he felt troubled. Now that he was standing here in person,the whole scenario seemed surreal. Despite Vittoria’s apparent faith that he wasright, Langdon realized he had put everyone on the line here. The Illuminatipoem lingered. From Santi’s earthly tomb with demon’s hole. YES, he toldhimself. This was the spot. Santi’s tomb. He had been here many times beneaththe Pantheon’s oculus and stood before the grave of the great Raphael.“What time is it?” Vittoria asked.Langdon checked his watch. “Seven-fifty. Ten minutes till show time.”“Hope these guys are good,” Vittoria said, eyeing the scattered touristsentering the Pantheon. “If anything happens inside that dome, we’ll all be inthe crossfire.”Langdon exhaled heavily as they moved toward the entrance. The gun felt heavy inhis pocket. He wondered what would happen if the policemen frisked him and foundthe weapon, but the officers did not give them a second look. Apparently thedisguise was convincing.Langdon whispered to Vittoria. “Ever fire anything other than a tranquilizergun?”“Don’t you trust me?”“Trust you? I barely know you.”Vittoria frowned. “And here I thought we were newlyweds.”"},{"pageContent":"61The air inside the Pantheon was cool and damp, heavy with history. The sprawlingceiling hovered overhead as though weightless-the 141-foot unsupported spanlarger even than the cupola at St. Peter’s. As always, Langdon felt a chill ashe entered the cavernous room. It was a remarkable fusion of engineering andart. Above them the famous circular hole in the roof glowed with a narrow shaftof evening sun. The oculus, Langdon thought. The demon’s hole.They had arrived.Langdon’s eyes traced the arch of the ceiling sloping outward to the columnedwalls and finally down to the polished marble floor beneath their feet. Thefaint echo of footfalls and tourist murmurs reverberated around the dome.Langdon scanned the dozen or so tourists wandering aimlessly in the shadows. Areyou here?“Looks pretty quiet,” Vittoria said, still holding his hand.Langdon nodded.“Where’s Raphael’s tomb?”Langdon thought for a moment, trying to get his bearings. He surveyed thecircumference of the room. Tombs. Altars. Pillars. Niches. He motioned to aparticularly ornate funerary across the dome and to the left. “I think that’sRaphael’s over there.”Vittoria scanned the rest of the room. “I don’t see anyone who looks like anassassin about to kill a cardinal. Shall we look around?”Langdon nodded. “There’s only one spot in here where anyone could be hiding. Webetter check the rientranze.”“The recesses?”“Yes.” Langdon pointed. “The recesses in the wall.”Around the perimeter, interspersed with the tombs, a series of semicircularniches were hewn in the wall. The niches, although not enormous, were big enoughto hide someone in the shadows. Sadly, Langdon knew they once contained statuesof the Olympian gods, but the pagan sculptures had been destroyed when theVatican converted the Pantheon to a Christian church. He felt a pang offrustration to know he was standing at the first altar of science, and themarker was gone. He wondered which statue it had been, and where it had pointed.Langdon could imagine no greater thrill than finding an Illuminati marker-astatue that surreptitiously pointed the way down the Path of Illumination. Againhe wondered who the anonymous Illuminati sculptor had been.“I’ll take the left arc,” Vittoria said, indicating the left half of thecircumference. “You go right. See you in a hundred and eighty degrees.”Langdon smiled grimly.As Vittoria moved off, Langdon felt the eerie horror of the situation seepingback into his mind. As he turned and made his way to the right, the killer’svoice seemed to whisper in the dead space around him. Eight o’clock. Virginsacrifices on the altars of science. A mathematical progression of death. Eight,nine, ten, eleven… and at midnight. Langdon checked his watch: 7:52. Eightminutes.As Langdon moved toward the first recess, he passed the tomb of one of Italy’sCatholic kings. The sarcophagus, like many in Rome, was askew with the wall,positioned awkwardly. A group of visitors seemed confused by this. Langdon didnot stop to explain. Formal Christian tombs were often misaligned with thearchitecture so they could lie facing east. It was an ancient superstition thatLangdon’s Symbology 212 class had discussed just last month.“That’s totally incongruous!” a female student in the front had blurted whenLangdon explained the reason for east-facing tombs. “Why would Christians wanttheir tombs to face the rising sun? We’re talking about Christianity… not sunworship!”Langdon smiled, pacing before the blackboard, chewing an apple. “Mr. Hitzrot!”he shouted.A young man dozing in back sat up with a start. “What! Me?”Langdon pointed to a Renaissance art poster on the wall. “Who is that mankneeling before God?”“Um… some saint?”“Brilliant. And how do you know he’s a saint?”“He’s got a halo?”“Excellent, and does that golden halo remind you of anything?”Hitzrot broke into a smile. “Yeah! Those Egyptian things we studied last term.Those… um… sun disks!”“Thank you, Hitzrot. Go back to sleep.” Langdon turned back to the class.“Halos, like much of Christian symbology, were borrowed from the ancientEgyptian religion of sun worship. Christianity is filled with examples of sunworship.”“Excuse me?” the girl in front said. “I go to church all the time, and I don’tsee much sun worshiping going on!”“Really? What do you celebrate on December twenty-fifth?”“Christmas. The birth of Jesus Christ.”“And yet according to the Bible, Christ was born in March, so what are we doingcelebrating in late December?”Silence.Langdon smiled. “December twenty-fifth, my friends, is the ancient pagan holidayof sol invictus-Unconquered Sun-coinciding with the winter solstice. It’s thatwonderful time of year when the sun returns, and the days start getting longer.”Langdon took another bite of apple.“Conquering religions,” he continued, “often adopt existing holidays to makeconversion less shocking. It’s called transmutation. It helps people acclimatizeto the new faith. Worshipers keep the same holy dates, pray in the same sacredlocations, use a similar symbology… and they simply substitute a different god.”Now the girl in front looked furious. “You’re implying Christianity is just somekind of… repackaged sun worship!”“Not at all. Christianity did not borrow only from sun worship. The ritual ofChristian canonization is taken from the ancient ‘god-making’ rite of Euhemerus.The practice of ‘god-eating’-that is, Holy Communion-was borrowed from theAztecs. Even the concept of Christ dying for our sins is arguably notexclusively Christian; the self-sacrifice of a young man to absolve the sins ofhis people appears in the earliest tradition of the Quetzalcoatl.”The girl glared. “So, is anything in Christianity original?”“Very little in any organized faith is truly original. Religions are not bornfrom scratch. They grow from one another. Modern religion is a collage… anassimilated historical record of man’s quest to understand the divine.”“Um… hold on,” Hitzrot ventured, sounding awake now. “I know something Christianthat’s original. How about our image of God? Christian art never portrays God asthe hawk sun god, or as an Aztec, or as anything weird. It always shows God asan old man with a white beard. So our image of God is original, right?”Langdon smiled. “When the early Christian converts abandoned their formerdeities-pagan gods, Roman gods, Greek, sun, Mithraic, whatever-they asked thechurch what their new Christian God looked like. Wisely, the church chose themost feared, powerful… and familiar face in all of recorded history.”Hitzrot looked skeptical. “An old man with a white, flowing beard?”Langdon pointed to a hierarchy of ancient gods on the wall. At the top sat anold man with a white, flowing beard. “Does Zeus look familiar?”The class ended right on cue.“Good evening,” a man’s voice said.Langdon jumped. He was back in the Pantheon. He turned to face an elderly man ina blue cape with a red cross on the chest. The man gave him a gray-toothedsmile.“You’re English, right?” The man’s accent was thick Tuscan.Langdon blinked, confused. “Actually, no. I’m American.”The man looked embarrassed. “Oh heavens, forgive me. You were so nicely dressed,I just figured… my apologies.”“Can I help you?” Langdon asked, his heart beating wildly.“Actually I thought perhaps I could help you. I am the cicerone here.” The manpointed proudly to his city-issued badge. “It is my job to make your visit toRome more interesting.”More interesting? Langdon was certain this particular visit to Rome was plentyinteresting.“You look like a man of distinction,” the guide fawned, “no doubt moreinterested in culture than most. Perhaps I can give you some history on thisfascinating building.”Langdon smiled politely. “Kind of you, but I’m actually an art historian myself,and-”“Superb!” The man’s eyes lit up like he’d hit the jackpot. “Then you will nodoubt find this delightful!”“I think I’d prefer to-”“The Pantheon,” the man declared, launching into his memorized spiel, “was builtby Marcus Agrippa in 27 B.C.”“Yes,” Langdon interjected, “and rebuilt by Hadrian in 119 A.D.”“It was the world’s largest free-standing dome until 1960 when it was eclipsedby the Superdome in New Orleans!”Langdon groaned. The man was unstoppable.“And a fifth-century theologian once called the Pantheon the House of the Devil,warning that the hole in the roof was an entrance for demons!”Langdon blocked him out. His eyes climbed skyward to the oculus, and the memoryof Vittoria’s suggested plot flashed a bone-numbing image in his mind… a brandedcardinal falling through the hole and hitting the marble floor. Now that wouldbe a media event. Langdon found himself scanning the Pantheon for reporters.None. He inhaled deeply. It was an absurd idea. The logistics of pulling off astunt like that would be ridiculous.As Langdon moved off to continue his inspection, the babbling docent followedlike a love-starved puppy. Remind me, Langdon thought to himself, there’snothing worse than a gung ho art historian.Across the room, Vittoria was immersed in her own search. Standing all alone forthe first time since she had heard the news of her father, she felt the starkreality of the last eight hours closing in around her. Her father had beenmurdered-cruelly and abruptly. Almost equally painful was that her father’screation had been corrupted-now a tool of terrorists. Vittoria was plagued withguilt to think that it was her invention that had enabled the antimatter to betransported… her canister that was now counting down inside the Vatican. In aneffort to serve her father’s quest for the simplicity of truth… she had become aconspirator of chaos.Oddly, the only thing that felt right in her life at the moment was the presenceof a total stranger. Robert Langdon. She found an inexplicable refuge in hiseyes… like the harmony of the oceans she had left behind early that morning. Shewas glad he was there. Not only had he been a source of strength and hope forher, Langdon had used his quick mind to render this one chance to catch herfather’s killer.Vittoria breathed deeply as she continued her search, moving around theperimeter. She was overwhelmed by the unexpected images of personal revenge thathad dominated her thoughts all day. Even as a sworn lover of all life… shewanted this executioner dead. No amount of good karma could make her turn theother cheek today. Alarmed and electrified, she sensed something coursingthrough her Italian blood that she had never felt before… the whispers ofSicilian ancestors defending family honor with brutal justice. Vendetta,Vittoria thought, and for the first time in her life understood.Visions of reprisal spurred her on. She approached the tomb of Raphael Santi.Even from a distance she could tell this guy was special. His casket, unlike theothers, was protected by a Plexiglas shield and recessed into the wall. Throughthe barrier she could see the front of the sarcophagus.RAPHAEL SANTI, 1483-1520Vittoria studied the grave and then read the one-sentence descriptive plaquebeside Raphael’s tomb.Then she read it again.Then… she read it again.A moment later, she was dashing in horror across the floor. “Robert! Robert!”"},{"pageContent":"62Langdon’s progress around his side of the Pantheon was being hampered somewhatby the guide on his heels, now continuing his tireless narration as Langdonprepared to check the final alcove.“You certainly seem to be enjoying those niches!” the docent said, lookingdelighted. “Were you aware that the tapering thickness of the walls is thereason the dome appears weightless?”Langdon nodded, not hearing a word as he prepared to examine another niche.Suddenly someone grabbed him from behind. It was Vittoria. She was breathlessand tugging at his arm. From the look of terror on her face, Langdon could onlyimagine one thing. She found a body. He felt an upswelling of dread.“Ah, your wife!” the docent exclaimed, clearly thrilled to have another guest.He motioned to her short pants and hiking boots. “Now you I can tell areAmerican!”Vittoria’s eyes narrowed. “I’m Italian.”The guide’s smile dimmed. “Oh, dear.”“Robert,” Vittoria whispered, trying to turn her back on the guide. “Galileo’sDiagramma. I need to see it.”“Diagramma?” the docent said, wheedling back in. “My! You two certainly knowyour history! Unfortunately that document is not viewable. It is under secretpreservation in the Vatican Arc-”“Could you excuse us?” Langdon said. He was confused by Vittoria’s panic. Hetook her aside and reached in his pocket, carefully extracting the Diagrammafolio. “What’s going on?”“What’s the date on this thing?” Vittoria demanded, scanning the sheet.The docent was on them again, staring at the folio, mouth agape. “That’s not…really…”“Tourist reproduction,” Langdon quipped. “Thank you for your help. Please, mywife and I would like a moment alone.”The docent backed off, eyes never leaving the paper.“Date,” Vittoria repeated to Langdon. “When did Galileo publish…”Langdon pointed to the Roman numeral in the lower liner. “That’s the pub date.What’s going on?”Vittoria deciphered the number. “1639?”“Yes. What’s wrong?”Vittoria’s eyes filled with foreboding. “We’re in trouble, Robert. Big trouble.The dates don’t match.”“What dates don’t match?”“Raphael’s tomb. He wasn’t buried here until 1759. A century after Diagramma waspublished.”Langdon stared at her, trying to make sense of the words. “No,” he replied.“Raphael died in 1520, long before Diagramma.”“Yes, but he wasn’t buried here until much later.”Langdon was lost. “What are you talking about?”“I just read it. Raphael’s body was relocated to the Pantheon in 1758. It waspart of some historic tribute to eminent Italians.”As the words settled in, Langdon felt like a rug had just been yanked out fromunder him.“When that poem was written,” Vittoria declared, “Raphael’s tomb was somewhereelse. Back then, the Pantheon had nothing at all to do with Raphael!”Langdon could not breathe. “But that… means…”“Yes! It means we’re in the wrong place!”Langdon felt himself sway. Impossible… I was certain…Vittoria ran over and grabbed the docent, pulling him back. “Signore, excuse us.Where was Raphael’s body in the 1600s?”“Urb… Urbino,” he stammered, now looking bewildered. “His birthplace.”“Impossible!” Langdon cursed to himself. “The Illuminati altars of science werehere in Rome. I’m certain of it!”“Illuminati?” The docent gasped, looking again at the document in Langdon’shand. “Who are you people?”Vittoria took charge. “We’re looking for something called Santi’s earthly tomb.In Rome. Can you tell us what that might be?”The docent looked unsettled. “This was Raphael’s only tomb in Rome.”Langdon tried to think, but his mind refused to engage. If Raphael’s tomb wasn’tin Rome in 1655, then what was the poem referring to? Santi’s earthly tomb withdemon’s hole? What the hell is it? Think!“Was there another artist called Santi?” Vittoria asked.The docent shrugged. “Not that I know of.”“How about anyone famous at all? Maybe a scientist or a poet or an astronomernamed Santi?”The docent now looked like he wanted to leave. “No, ma’am. The only Santi I’veever heard of is Raphael the architect.”“Architect?” Vittoria said. “I thought he was a painter!”“He was both, of course. They all were. Michelangelo, da Vinci, Raphael.”Langdon didn’t know whether it was the docent’s words or the ornate tombs aroundthem that brought the revelation to mind, but it didn’t matter. The thoughtoccurred. Santi was an architect. From there the progression of thoughts felllike dominoes. Renaissance architects lived for only two reasons-to glorify Godwith big churches, and to glorify dignitaries with lavish tombs. Santi’s tomb.Could it be? The images came faster now…da Vinci’s Mona Lisa.Monet’s Water Lilies.Michelangelo’s David.Santi’s earthly tomb…“Santi designed the tomb,” Langdon said.Vittoria turned. “What?”“It’s not a reference to where Raphael is buried, it’s referring to a tomb hedesigned.”“What are you talking about?”“I misunderstood the clue. It’s not Raphael’s burial site we’re looking for,it’s a tomb Raphael designed for someone else. I can’t believe I missed it. Halfof the sculpting done in Renaissance and Baroque Rome was for the funeraries.”Langdon smiled with the revelation. “Raphael must have designed hundreds oftombs!”Vittoria did not look happy. “Hundreds?”Langdon’s smile faded. “Oh.”“Any of them earthly, professor?”Langdon felt suddenly inadequate. He knew embarrassingly little about Raphael’swork. Michelangelo he could have helped with, but Raphael’s work had nevercaptivated him. Langdon could only name a couple of Raphael’s more famous tombs,but he wasn’t sure what they looked like.Apparently sensing Langdon’s stymie, Vittoria turned to the docent, who was nowinching away. She grabbed his arm and reeled him in. “I need a tomb. Designed byRaphael. A tomb that could be considered earthly.”The docent now looked distressed. “A tomb of Raphael’s? I don’t know. Hedesigned so many. And you probably would mean a chapel by Raphael, not a tomb.Architects always designed the chapels in conjunction with the tomb.”Langdon realized the man was right.“Are any of Raphael’s tombs or chapels considered earthly?”The man shrugged. “I’m sorry. I don’t know what you mean. Earthly really doesn’tdescribe anything I know of. I should be going.”Vittoria held his arm and read from the top line of the folio. “From Santi’searthly tomb with demon’s hole. Does that mean anything to you?”“Not a thing.”Langdon looked up suddenly. He had momentarily forgotten the second part of theline. Demon’s hole? “Yes!” he said to the docent. “That’s it! Do any ofRaphael’s chapels have an oculus in them?”The docent shook his head. “To my knowledge the Pantheon is unique.” He paused.“But…”“But what!” Vittoria and Langdon said in unison.Now the docent cocked his head, stepping toward them again. “A demon’s hole?” Hemuttered to himself and picked at his teeth. “Demon’s hole… that is… bucodiаvolo?”Vittoria nodded. “Literally, yes.”The docent smiled faintly. “Now there’s a term I have not heard in a while. IfI’m not mistaken, a buco diаvolo refers to an undercroft.”“An undercroft?” Langdon asked. “As in a crypt?”“Yes, but a specific kind of crypt. I believe a demon’s hole is an ancient termfor a massive burial cavity located in a chapel… underneath another tomb.”“An ossuary annex?” Langdon demanded, immediately recognizing what the man wasdescribing.The docent looked impressed. “Yes! That is the term I was looking for!”Langdon considered it. Ossuary annexes were a cheap ecclesiastic fix to anawkward dilemma. When churches honored their most distinguished members withornate tombs inside the sanctuary, surviving family members often demanded thefamily be buried together… thus ensuring they too would have a coveted burialspot inside the church. However, if the church did not have space or funds tocreate tombs for an entire family, they sometimes dug an ossuary annex-a hole inthe floor near the tomb where they buried the less worthy family members. Thehole was then covered with the Renaissance equivalent of a manhole cover.Although convenient, the ossuary annex went out of style quickly because of thestench that often wafted up into the cathedral. Demon’s hole, Langdon thought.He had never heard the term. It seemed eerily fitting.Langdon’s heart was now pounding fiercely. From Santi’s earthly tomb withdemon’s hole. There seemed to be only one question left to ask. “Did Raphaeldesign any tombs that had one of these demon’s holes?”The docent scratched his head. “Actually. I’m sorry… I can only think of one.”Only one? Langdon could not have dreamed of a better response.“Where!” Vittoria almost shouted.The docent eyed them strangely. “It’s called the Chigi Chapel. Tomb of AgostinoChigi and his brother, wealthy patrons of the arts and sciences.”“Sciences?” Langdon said, exchanging looks with Vittoria.“Where?” Vittoria asked again.The docent ignored the question, seeming enthusiastic again to be of service.“As for whether or not the tomb is earthly, I don’t know, but certainly it is…shall we say differйnte.”“Different?” Langdon said. “How?”“Incoherent with the architecture. Raphael was only the architect. Some othersculptor did the interior adornments. I can’t remember who.”Langdon was now all ears. The anonymous Illuminati master, perhaps?“Whoever did the interior monuments lacked taste,” the docent said. “Dio mio!Atrocitаs! Who would want to be buried beneath pirбmides?”Langdon could scarcely believe his ears. “Pyramids? The chapel containspyramids?”“I know,” the docent scoffed. “Terrible, isn’t it?”Vittoria grabbed the docent’s arm. “Signore, where is this Chigi Chapel?”“About a mile north. In the church of Santa Maria del Popolo.”Vittoria exhaled. “Thank you. Let’s-”“Hey,” the docent said, “I just thought of something. What a fool I am.”Vittoria stopped short. “Please don’t tell me you made a mistake.”He shook his head. “No, but it should have dawned on me earlier. The ChigiChapel was not always known as the Chigi. It used to be called Capella dellaTerra.”“Chapel of the Land?” Langdon asked.“No,” Vittoria said, heading for the door. “Chapel of the Earth.”Vittoria Vetra whipped out her cell phone as she dashed into Piazza dellaRotunda. “Commander Olivetti,” she said. “This is the wrong place!”Olivetti sounded bewildered. “Wrong? What do you mean?”“The first altar of science is at the Chigi Chapel!”“Where?” Now Olivetti sounded angry. “But Mr. Langdon said-”“Santa Maria del Popolo! One mile north. Get your men over there now! We’ve gotfour minutes!”“But my men are in position here! I can’t possibly-”“Move!” Vittoria snapped the phone shut.Behind her, Langdon emerged from the Pantheon, dazed.She grabbed his hand and pulled him toward the queue of seemingly driverlesstaxis waiting by the curb. She pounded on the hood of the first car in line. Thesleeping driver bolted upright with a startled yelp. Vittoria yanked open therear door and pushed Langdon inside. Then she jumped in behind him.“Santa Maria del Popolo,” she ordered. “Presto!”Looking delirious and half terrified, the driver hit the accelerator, peelingout down the street."},{"pageContent":"63Gunther Glick had assumed control of the computer from Chinita Macri, who nowstood hunched in the back of the cramped BBC van staring in confusion overGlick’s shoulder.“I told you,” Glick said, typing some more keys. “The British Tattler isn’t theonly paper that runs stories on these guys.”Macri peered closer. Glick was right. The BBC database showed theirdistinguished network as having picked up and run six stories in the past tenyears on the brotherhood called the Illuminati. Well, paint me purple, shethought. “Who are the journalists who ran the stories,” Macri asked. “Schlockjocks?”“BBC doesn’t hire schlock jocks.”“They hired you.”Glick scowled. “I don’t know why you’re such a skeptic. The Illuminati are welldocumented throughout history.”“So are witches, UFOs, and the Loch Ness Monster.”Glick read the list of stories. “You ever heard of a guy called WinstonChurchill?”“Rings a bell.”“BBC did a historical a while back on Churchill’s life. Staunch Catholic by theway. Did you know that in 1920 Churchill published a statement condemning theIlluminati and warning Brits of a worldwide conspiracy against morality?”Macri was dubious. “Where did it run? In the British Tattler?”Glick smiled. “London Herald. February 8, 1920.”“No way.”“Feast your eyes.”Macri looked closer at the clip. London Herald. Feb. 8, 1920. I had no idea.“Well, Churchill was a paranoid.”“He wasn’t alone,” Glick said, reading further. “Looks like Woodrow Wilson gavethree radio broadcasts in 1921 warning of growing Illuminati control over theU.S. banking system. You want a direct quote from the radio transcript?”“Not really.”Glick gave her one anyway. “He said, ‘There is a power so organized, so subtle,so complete, so pervasive, that none had better speak above their breath whenthey speak in condemnation of it.’ ”“I’ve never heard anything about this.”“Maybe because in 1921 you were just a kid.”“Charming.” Macri took the jab in stride. She knew her years were showing. Atforty-three, her bushy black curls were streaked with gray. She was too proudfor dye. Her mom, a Southern Baptist, had taught Chinita contentedness andself-respect. When you’re a black woman, her mother said, ain’t no hiding whatyou are. Day you try, is the day you die. Stand tall, smile bright, and let ‘emwonder what secret’s making you laugh.“Ever heard of Cecil Rhodes?” Glick asked.Macri looked up. “The British financier?”“Yeah. Founded the Rhodes Scholarships.”“Don’t tell me-”“Illuminatus.”“BS.”“BBC, actually. November 16, 1984.”“We wrote that Cecil Rhodes was Illuminati?”“Sure did. And according to our network, the Rhodes Scholarships were funds setup centuries ago to recruit the world’s brightest young minds into theIlluminati.”“That’s ridiculous! My uncle was a Rhodes Scholar!”Glick winked. “So was Bill Clinton.”Macri was getting mad now. She had never had tolerance for shoddy, alarmistreporting. Still, she knew enough about the BBC to know that every story theyran was carefully researched and confirmed.“Here’s one you’ll remember,” Glick said. “BBC, March 5, 1998. ParliamentCommittee Chair, Chris Mullin, required all members of British Parliament whowere Masons to declare their affiliation.”Macri remembered it. The decree had eventually extended to include policemen andjudges as well. “Why was it again?”Glick read. “… concern that secret factions within the Masons exertedconsiderable control over political and financial systems.”“That’s right.”“Caused quite a bustle. The Masons in parliament were furious. Had a right tobe. The vast majority turned out to be innocent men who joined the Masons fornetworking and charity work. They had no clue about the brotherhood’s pastaffiliations.”“Alleged affiliations.”“Whatever.” Glick scanned the articles. “Look at this stuff. Accounts tracingthe Illuminati back to Galileo, the Guerenets of France, the Alumbrados ofSpain. Even Karl Marx and the Russian Revolution.”“History has a way of rewriting itself.”“Fine, you want something current? Have a look at this. Here’s an Illuminatireference from a recent Wall Street Journal.”This caught Macri’s ear. “The Journal?”“Guess what the most popular Internet computer game in America is right now?”“Pin the tail on Pamela Anderson.”“Close. It’s called, Illuminati: New World Order.”Macri looked over his shoulder at the blurb. “Steve Jackson Games has a runawayhit… a quasi-historical adventure in which an ancient satanic brotherhood fromBavaria sets out to take over the world. You can find them on-line at…” Macrilooked up, feeling ill. “What do these Illuminati guys have againstChristianity?”“Not just Christianity,” Glick said. “Religion in general.” Glick cocked hishead and grinned. “Although from the phone call we just got, it appears they dohave a special spot in their hearts for the Vatican.”“Oh, come on. You don’t really think that guy who called is who he claims to be,do you?”“A messenger of the Illuminati? Preparing to kill four cardinals?” Glick smiled.“I sure hope so.”"},{"pageContent":"64Langdon and Vittoria’s taxi completed the one-mile sprint up the wide Via dellaScrofa in just over a minute. They skidded to a stop on the south side of thePiazza del Popolo just before eight. Not having any lire, Langdon overpaid thedriver in U.S. dollars. He and Vittoria jumped out. The piazza was quiet exceptfor the laughter of a handful of locals seated outside the popular Rosati Cafй-ahot spot of the Italian literati. The breeze smelled of espresso and pastry.Langdon was still in shock over his mistake at the Pantheon. With a cursoryglance at this square, however, his sixth sense was already tingling. The piazzaseemed subtly filled with Illuminati significance. Not only was it laid out in aperfectly elliptical shape, but dead center stood a towering Egyptian obelisk-asquare pillar of stone with a distinctively pyramidal tip. Spoils of Rome’simperial plundering, obelisks were scattered across Rome and referred to bysymbologists as “Lofty Pyramids”-skyward extensions of the sacred pyramidalform.As Langdon’s eyes moved up the monolith, though, his sight was suddenly drawn tosomething else in the background. Something even more remarkable.“We’re in the right place,” he said quietly, feeling a sudden exposed wariness.“Have a look at that.” Langdon pointed to the imposing Porta del Popolo-the highstone archway at the far end of the piazza. The vaulted structure had beenoverlooking the piazza for centuries. Dead center of the archway’s highest pointwas a symbolic engraving. “Look familiar?”Vittoria looked up at the huge carving. “A shining star over a triangular pileof stones?”Langdon shook his head. “A source of Illumination over a pyramid.”Vittoria turned, her eyes suddenly wide. “Like… the Great Seal of the UnitedStates?”“Exactly. The Masonic symbol on the one-dollar bill.”Vittoria took a deep breath and scanned the piazza. “So where’s this damnchurch?”The Church of Santa Maria del Popolo stood out like a misplaced battleship,askew at the base of a hill on the southeast corner of the piazza. Theeleventh-century stone aerie was made even more clumsy by the tower ofscaffolding covering the faзade.Langdon’s thoughts were a blur as they raced toward the edifice. He stared up atthe church in wonder. Could a murder really be about to take place inside? Hewished Olivetti would hurry. The gun felt awkward in his pocket.The church’s front stairs were ventaglio-a welcoming, curved fan-ironic in thiscase because they were blocked with scaffolding, construction equipment, and asign warning: CONSTRUZZIONE. NON ENTRARE.Langdon realized that a church closed for renovation meant total privacy for akiller. Not like the Pantheon. No fancy tricks needed here. Only to find a wayin.Vittoria slipped without hesitation between the sawhorses and headed up thestaircase.“Vittoria,” Langdon cautioned. “If he’s still in there…”Vittoria did not seem to hear. She ascended the main portico to the church’ssole wooden door. Langdon hurried up the stairs behind her. Before he could saya word she had grasped the handle and pulled. Langdon held his breath. The doordid not budge.“There must be another entrance,” Vittoria said.“Probably,” Langdon said, exhaling, “but Olivetti will be here in a minute. It’stoo dangerous to go in. We should cover the church from out here until-”Vittoria turned, her eyes blazing. “If there’s another way in, there’s anotherway out. If this guy disappears, we’re fungito.”Langdon knew enough Italian to know she was right.The alley on the right side of the church was pinched and dark, with high wallson both sides. It smelled of urine-a common aroma in a city where barsoutnumbered public rest rooms twenty to one.Langdon and Vittoria hurried into the fetid dimness. They had gone about fifteenyards down when Vittoria tugged Langdon’s arm and pointed.Langdon saw it too. Up ahead was an unassuming wooden door with heavy hinges.Langdon recognized it as the standard porta sacra-a private entrance for clergy.Most of these entrances had gone out of use years ago as encroaching buildingsand limited real estate relegated side entrances to inconvenient alleyways.Vittoria hurried to the door. She arrived and stared down at the doorknob,apparently perplexed. Langdon arrived behind her and eyed the peculiardonut-shaped hoop hanging where the doorknob should have been.“An annulus,” he whispered. Langdon reached out and quietly lifted the ring inhis hand. He pulled the ring toward him. The fixture clicked. Vittoria shifted,looking suddenly uneasy. Quietly, Langdon twisted the ring clockwise. It spunloosely 360 degrees, not engaging. Langdon frowned and tried the other directionwith the same result.Vittoria looked down the remainder of the alley. “You think there’s anotherentrance?”Langdon doubted it. Most Renaissance cathedrals were designed as makeshiftfortresses in the event a city was stormed. They had as few entrances aspossible. “If there is another way in,” he said, “it’s probably recessed in therear bastion-more of an escape route than an entrance.”Vittoria was already on the move.Langdon followed deeper into the alley. The walls shot skyward on both sides ofhim. Somewhere a bell began ringing eight o’clock…Robert Langdon did not hear Vittoria the first time she called to him. He hadslowed at a stained-glass window covered with bars and was trying to peer insidethe church.“Robert!” Her voice was a loud whisper.Langdon looked up. Vittoria was at the end of the alley. She was pointing aroundthe back of the church and waving to him. Langdon jogged reluctantly toward her.At the base of the rear wall, a stone bulwark jutted out concealing a narrowgrotto-a kind of compressed passageway cutting directly into the foundation ofthe church.“An entrance?” Vittoria asked.Langdon nodded. Actually an exit, but we won’t get technical.Vittoria knelt and peered into the tunnel. “Let’s check the door. See if it’sopen.”Langdon opened his mouth to object, but Vittoria took his hand and pulled himinto the opening.“Wait,” Langdon said.She turned impatiently toward him.Langdon sighed. “I’ll go first.”Vittoria looked surprised. “More chivalry?”“Age before beauty.”“Was that a compliment?”Langdon smiled and moved past her into the dark. “Careful on the stairs.”He inched slowly into the darkness, keeping one hand on the wall. The stone feltsharp on his fingertips. For an instant Langdon recalled the ancient myth ofDaedelus, how the boy kept one hand on the wall as he moved through theMinotaur’s labyrinth, knowing he was guaranteed to find the end if he neverbroke contact with the wall. Langdon moved forward, not entirely certain hewanted to find the end.The tunnel narrowed slightly, and Langdon slowed his pace. He sensed Vittoriaclose behind him. As the wall curved left, the tunnel opened into a semicircularalcove. Oddly, there was faint light here. In the dimness Langdon saw theoutline of a heavy wooden door.“Uh oh,” he said.“Locked?”“It was.”“Was?” Vittoria arrived at his side.Langdon pointed. Lit by a shaft of light coming from within, the door hung ajar…its hinges splintered by a wrecking bar still lodged in the wood.They stood a moment in silence. Then, in the dark, Langdon felt Vittoria’s handson his chest, groping, sliding beneath his jacket.“Relax, professor,” she said. “I’m just getting the gun.”At that moment, inside the Vatican Museums, a task force of Swiss Guards spreadout in all directions. The museum was dark, and the guards wore U.S. Marineissue infrared goggles. The goggles made everything appear an eerie shade ofgreen. Every guard wore headphones connected to an antennalike detector that hewaved rhythmically in front of him-the same devices they used twice a week tosweep for electronic bugs inside the Vatican. They moved methodically, checkingbehind statues, inside niches, closets, under furniture. The antennae wouldsound if they detected even the tiniest magnetic field.Tonight, however, they were getting no readings at all."},{"pageContent":"65The interior of Santa Maria del Popolo was a murky cave in the dimming light. Itlooked more like a half-finished subway station than a cathedral. The mainsanctuary was an obstacle course of torn-up flooring, brick pallets, mounds ofdirt, wheelbarrows, and even a rusty backhoe. Mammoth columns rose through thefloor, supporting a vaulted roof. In the air, silt drifted lazily in the mutedglow of the stained glass. Langdon stood with Vittoria beneath a sprawlingPinturicchio fresco and scanned the gutted shrine.Nothing moved. Dead silence.Vittoria held the gun out in front of her with both hands. Langdon checked hiswatch: 8:04 P.M. We’re crazy to be in here, he thought. It’s too dangerous.Still he knew if the killer were inside, the man could leave through any door hewanted, making a one-gun outside stakeout totally fruitless. Catching him insidewas the only way… that was, if he was even still here. Langdon felt guilt-riddenover the blunder that had cost everyone their chance at the Pantheon. He was inno position to insist on precaution now; he was the one who had backed them intothis corner.Vittoria looked harrowed as she scanned the church. “So,” she whispered. “Whereis this Chigi Chapel?”Langdon gazed through the dusky ghostliness toward the back of the cathedral andstudied the outer walls. Contrary to common perception, Renaissance cathedralsinvariably contained multiple chapels, huge cathedrals like Notre Dame havingdozens. Chapels were less rooms than they were hollows-semicircular nichesholding tombs around a church’s perimeter wall.Bad news, Langdon thought, seeing the four recesses on each side wall. Therewere eight chapels in all. Although eight was not a particularly overwhelmingnumber, all eight openings were covered with huge sheets of clear polyurethanedue to the construction, the translucent curtains apparently intended to keepdust off the tombs inside the alcoves.“It could be any of those draped recesses,” Langdon said. “No way to know whichis the Chigi without looking inside every one. Could be a good reason to waitfor Oliv-”“Which is the secondary left apse?” she asked.Langdon studied her, surprised by her command of architectural terminology.“Secondary left apse?”Vittoria pointed at the wall behind him. A decorative tile was embedded in thestone. It was engraved with the same symbol they had seen outside-a pyramidbeneath a shining star. The grime-covered plaque beside it read:COAT OF ARMS OF ALEXANDER CHIGIWHOSE TOMB IS LOCATED IN THESECONDARY LEFT APSE OF THIS CATHEDRALLangdon nodded. Chigi’s coat of arms was a pyramid and star? He suddenly foundhimself wondering if the wealthy patron Chigi had been an Illuminatus. He noddedto Vittoria. “Nice work, Nancy Drew.”“What?”“Never mind. I-”A piece of metal clattered to the floor only yards away. The clang echoedthrough the entire church. Langdon pulled Vittoria behind a pillar as shewhipped the gun toward the sound and held it there. Silence. They waited. Againthere was sound, this time a rustling. Langdon held his breath. I never shouldhave let us come in here! The sound moved closer, an intermittent scuffling,like a man with a limp. Suddenly around the base of the pillar, an object cameinto view.“Figlio di puttana!” Vittoria cursed under her breath, jumping back. Langdonfell back with her.Beside the pillar, dragging a half-eaten sandwich in paper, was an enormous rat.The creature paused when it saw them, staring a long moment down the barrel ofVittoria’s weapon, and then, apparently unmoved, continued dragging its prizeoff to the recesses of the church.“Son of a…” Langdon gasped, his heart racing.Vittoria lowered the gun, quickly regaining her composure. Langdon peered aroundthe side of the column to see a workman’s lunchbox splayed on the floor,apparently knocked off a sawhorse by the resourceful rodent.Langdon scanned the basilica for movement and whispered, “If this guy’s here, hesure as hell heard that. You sure you don’t want to wait for Olivetti?”“Secondary left apse,” Vittoria repeated. “Where is it?”Reluctantly Langdon turned and tried to get his bearings. Cathedral terminologywas like stage directions-totally counterintuitive. He faced the main altar.Stage center. Then he pointed with his thumb backward over his shoulder.They both turned and looked where he was pointing.It seemed the Chigi Chapel was located in the third of four recessed alcoves totheir right. The good news was that Langdon and Vittoria were on the correctside of the church. The bad news was that they were at the wrong end. They wouldhave to traverse the length of the cathedral, passing three other chapels, eachof them, like the Chigi Chapel, covered with translucent plastic shrouds.“Wait,” Langdon said. “I’ll go first.”“Forget it.”“I’m the one who screwed up at the Pantheon.”She turned. “But I’m the one with the gun.”In her eyes Langdon could see what she was really thinking… I’m the one who lostmy father. I’m the one who helped build a weapon of mass destruction. This guy’skneecaps are mine…Langdon sensed the futility and let her go. He moved beside her, cautiously,down the east side of the basilica. As they passed the first shrouded alcove,Langdon felt taut, like a contestant on some surreal game show. I’ll takecurtain number three, he thought.The church was quiet, the thick stone walls blocking out all hints of theoutside world. As they hurried past one chapel after the other, pale humanoidforms wavered like ghosts behind the rustling plastic. Carved marble, Langdontold himself, hoping he was right. It was 8:06 P.M. Had the killer been punctualand slipped out before Langdon and Vittoria had entered? Or was he still here?Langdon was unsure which scenario he preferred.They passed the second apse, ominous in the slowly darkening cathedral. Nightseemed to be falling quickly now, accentuated by the musty tint of thestained-glass windows. As they pressed on, the plastic curtain beside thembillowed suddenly, as if caught in a draft. Langdon wondered if someonesomewhere had opened a door.Vittoria slowed as the third niche loomed before them. She held the gun beforeher, motioning with her head to the stele beside the apse. Carved in the graniteblock were two words:CAPELLA CHIGILangdon nodded. Without a sound they moved to the corner of the opening,positioning themselves behind a wide pillar. Vittoria leveled the gun around acorner at the plastic. Then she signaled for Langdon to pull back the shroud.A good time to start praying, he thought. Reluctantly, he reached over hershoulder. As carefully as possible, he began to pull the plastic aside. It movedan inch and then crinkled loudly. They both froze. Silence. After a moment,moving in slow motion, Vittoria leaned forward and peered through the narrowslit. Langdon looked over her shoulder.For a moment, neither one of them breathed.“Empty,” Vittoria finally said, lowering the gun. “We’re too late.”Langdon did not hear. He was in awe, transported for an instant to anotherworld. In his life, he had never imagined a chapel that looked like this.Finished entirely in chestnut marble, the Chigi Chapel was breathtaking.Langdon’s trained eye devoured it in gulps. It was as earthly a chapel asLangdon could fathom, almost as if Galileo and the Illuminati had designed itthemselves.Overhead, the domed cupola shone with a field of illuminated stars and the sevenastronomical planets. Below that the twelve signs of the zodiac-pagan, earthlysymbols rooted in astronomy. The zodiac was also tied directly to Earth, Air,Fire, Water… the quadrants representing power, intellect, ardor, emotion. Earthis for power, Langdon recalled.Farther down the wall, Langdon saw tributes to the Earth’s four temporalseasons-primavera, estate, autunno, invйrno. But far more incredible than any ofthis were the two huge structures dominating the room. Langdon stared at them insilent wonder.It can’t be, he thought. It just can’t be! But it was. On eitherside of the chapel, in perfect symmetry, were two ten-foot-high marble pyramids.“I don’t see a cardinal,” Vittoria whispered. “Or an assassin.” She pulled asidethe plastic and stepped in.Langdon’s eyes were transfixed on the pyramids. What are pyramids doing inside aChristian chapel? And incredibly, there was more. Dead center of each pyramid,embedded in their anterior faзades, were gold medallions… medallions like fewLangdon had ever seen… perfect ellipses. The burnished disks glimmered in thesetting sun as it sifted through the cupola. Galileo’s ellipses? Pyramids? Acupola of stars? The room had more Illuminati significance than any room Langdoncould have fabricated in his mind.“Robert,” Vittoria blurted, her voice cracking. “Look!”Langdon wheeled, reality returning as his eyes dropped to where she waspointing. “Bloody hell!” he shouted, jumping backward.Sneering up at them from the floor was the image of a skeleton-an intricatelydetailed, marble mosaic depicting “death in flight.” The skeleton was carrying atablet portraying the same pyramid and stars they had seen outside. It was notthe image, however, that had turned Langdon’s blood cold. It was the fact thatthe mosaic was mounted on a circular stone-a cupermento-that had been lifted outof the floor like a manhole cover and was now sitting off to one side of a darkopening in the floor.“Demon’s hole,” Langdon gasped. He had been so taken with the ceiling he had noteven seen it. Tentatively he moved toward the pit. The stench coming up wasoverwhelming.Vittoria put a hand over her mouth. “Che puzzo.”“Effluvium,” Langdon said. “Vapors from decaying bone.” He breathed through hissleeve as he leaned out over the hole, peering down. Blackness. “I can’t see athing.”“You think anybody’s down there?”“No way to know.”Vittoria motioned to the far side of the hole where a rotting, wooden ladderdescended into the depths.Langdon shook his head. “Like hell.”“Maybe there’s a flashlight outside in those tools.” She sounded eager for anexcuse to escape the smell. “I’ll look.”“Careful!” Langdon warned. “We don’t know for sure that the Hassassin-”But Vittoria was already gone.One strong-willed woman, Langdon thought.As he turned back to the pit, he felt light-headed from the fumes. Holding hisbreath, he dropped his head below the rim and peered deep into the darkness.Slowly, as his eyes adjusted, he began to see faint shapes below. The pitappeared to open into a small chamber. Demon’s hole. He wondered how manygenerations of Chigis had been unceremoniously dumped in. Langdon closed hiseyes and waited, forcing his pupils to dilate so he could see better in thedark. When he opened his eyes again, a pale muted figure hovered below in thedarkness. Langdon shivered but fought the instinct to pull out. Am I seeingthings? Is that a body? The figure faded. Langdon closed his eyes again andwaited, longer this time, so his eyes would pick up the faintest light.Dizziness started to set in, and his thoughts wandered in the blackness. Just afew more seconds. He wasn’t sure if it was breathing the fumes or holding hishead at a low inclination, but Langdon was definitely starting to feelsqueamish. When he finally opened his eyes again, the image before him wastotally inexplicable.He was now staring at a crypt bathed in an eerie bluish light. A faint hissingsound reverberated in his ears. Light flickered on the steep walls of the shaft.Suddenly, a long shadow materialized over him. Startled, Langdon scrambled up.“Look out!” someone exclaimed behind him.Before Langdon could turn, he felt a sharp pain on the back of his neck. He spunto see Vittoria twisting a lit blowtorch away from him, the hissing flamethrowing blue light around the chapel.Langdon grabbed his neck. “What the hell are you doing?”“I was giving you some light,” she said. “You backed right into me.”Langdon glared at the portable blowtorch in her hand.“Best I could do,” she said. “No flashlights.”Langdon rubbed his neck. “I didn’t hear you come in.”Vittoria handed him the torch, wincing again at the stench of the crypt. “Youthink those fumes are combustible?”“Let’s hope not.”He took the torch and moved slowly toward the hole. Cautiously, he advanced tothe rim and pointed the flame down into the hole, lighting the side wall. As hedirected the light, his eyes traced the outline of the wall downward. The cryptwas circular and about twenty feet across. Thirty feet down, the glow found thefloor. The ground was dark and mottled. Earthy. Then Langdon saw the body.His instinct was to recoil. “He’s here,” Langdon said, forcing himself not toturn away. The figure was a pallid outline against the earthen floor. “I thinkhe’s been stripped naked.” Langdon flashed on the nude corpse of Leonardo Vetra.“Is it one of the cardinals?”Langdon had no idea, but he couldn’t imagine who the hell else it would be. Hestared down at the pale blob. Unmoving. Lifeless. And yet… Langdon hesitated.There was something very strange about the way the figure was positioned. Heseemed to be…Langdon called out. “Hello?”“You think he’s alive?”There was no response from below.“He’s not moving,” Langdon said. “But he looks…” No, impossible.“He looks what?” Vittoria was peering over the edge now too.Langdon squinted into the darkness. “He looks like he’s standing up.”Vittoria held her breath and lowered her face over the edge for a better look.After a moment, she pulled back. “You’re right. He’s standing up! Maybe he’salive and needs help!” She called into the hole. “Hello?! Mi puу sentire?”There was no echo off the mossy interior. Only silence.Vittoria headed for the rickety ladder. “I’m going down.”Langdon caught her arm. “No. It’s dangerous. I’ll go.”This time Vittoria didn’t argue."},{"pageContent":"66Chinita Macri was mad. She sat in the passenger’s seat of the BBC van as itidled at a corner on Via Tomacelli. Gunther Glick was checking his map of Rome,apparently lost. As she had feared, his mystery caller had phoned back, thistime with information.“Piazza del Popolo,” Glick insisted. “That’s what we’re looking for. There’s achurch there. And inside is proof.”“Proof.” Chinita stopped polishing the lens in her hand and turned to him.“Proof that a cardinal has been murdered?”“That’s what he said.”“You believe everything you hear?” Chinita wished, as she often did, that shewas the one in charge. Videographers, however, were at the whim of the crazyreporters for whom they shot footage. If Gunther Glick wanted to follow a feeblephone tip, Macri was his dog on a leash.She looked at him, sitting there in the driver’s seat, his jaw set intently. Theman’s parents, she decided, must have been frustrated comedians to have givenhim a name like Gunther Glick. No wonder the guy felt like he had something toprove. Nonetheless, despite his unfortunate appellative and annoying eagernessto make a mark, Glick was sweet… charming in a pasty, Briddish, unstrung sort ofway. Like Hugh Grant on lithium.“Shouldn’t we be back at St. Peter’s?” Macri said as patiently as possible. “Wecan check this mystery church out later. Conclave started an hour ago. What ifthe cardinals come to a decision while we’re gone?”Glick did not seem to hear. “I think we go to the right, here.” He tilted themap and studied it again. “Yes, if I take a right… and then an immediate left.”He began to pull out onto the narrow street before them.“Look out!” Macri yelled. She was a video technician, and her eyes were sharp.Fortunately, Glick was pretty fast too. He slammed on the brakes and avoidedentering the intersection just as a line of four Alpha Romeos appeared out ofnowhere and tore by in a blur. Once past, the cars skidded, decelerating, andcut sharply left one block ahead, taking the exact route Glick had intended totake.“Maniacs!” Macri shouted.Glick looked shaken. “Did you see that?”“Yeah, I saw that! They almost killed us!”“No, I mean the cars,” Glick said, his voice suddenly excited. “They were allthe same.”“So they were maniacs with no imagination.”“The cars were also full.”“So what?”“Four identical cars, all with four passengers?”“You ever heard of carpooling?”“In Italy?” Glick checked the intersection. “They haven’t even heard of unleadedgas.” He hit the accelerator and peeled out after the cars.Macri was thrown back in her seat. “What the hell are you doing?”Glick accelerated down the street and hung a left after the Alpha Romeos.“Something tells me you and I are not the only ones going to church right now.”"},{"pageContent":"67The descent was slow.Langdon dropped rung by rung down the creaking ladder… deeper and deeper beneaththe floor of the Chigi Chapel. Into the Demon’s hole, he thought. He was facingthe side wall, his back to the chamber, and he wondered how many more dark,cramped spaces one day could provide. The ladder groaned with every step, andthe pungent smell of rotting flesh and dampness was almost asphyxiating. Langdonwondered where the hell Olivetti was.Vittoria’s outline was still visible above, holding the blowtorch inside thehole, lighting Langdon’s way. As he lowered himself deeper into the darkness,the bluish glow from above got fainter. The only thing that got stronger was thestench.Twelve rungs down, it happened. Langdon’s foot hit a spot that was slippery withdecay, and he faltered. Lunging forward, he caught the ladder with his forearmsto avoid plummeting to the bottom. Cursing the bruises now throbbing on hisarms, he dragged his body back onto the ladder and began his descent again.Three rungs deeper, he almost fell again, but this time it was not a rung thatcaused the mishap. It was a bolt of fear. He had descended past a hollowed nichein the wall before him and suddenly found himself face to face with a collectionof skulls. As he caught his breath and looked around him, he realized the wallat this level was honeycombed with shelflike openings-burial niches-all filledwith skeletons. In the phosphorescent light, it made for an eerie collage ofempty sockets and decaying rib cages flickering around him.Skeletons by firelight, he grimaced wryly, realizing he had quite coincidentallyendured a similar evening just last month. An evening of bones and flames. TheNew York Museum of Archeology’s candlelight benefit dinner-salmon flambй in theshadow of a brontosaurus skeleton. He had attended at the invitation of RebeccaStrauss-one-time fashion model now art critic from the Times, a whirlwind ofblack velvet, cigarettes, and not-so-subtly enhanced breasts. She’d called himtwice since. Langdon had not returned her calls. Most ungentlemanly, he chided,wondering how long Rebecca Strauss would last in a stink-pit like this.Langdon was relieved to feel the final rung give way to the spongy earth at thebottom. The ground beneath his shoes felt damp. Assuring himself the walls werenot going to close in on him, he turned into the crypt. It was circular, abouttwenty feet across. Breathing through his sleeve again, Langdon turned his eyesto the body. In the gloom, the image was hazy. A white, fleshy outline. Facingthe other direction. Motionless. Silent.Advancing through the murkiness of the crypt, Langdon tried to make sense ofwhat he was looking at. The man had his back to Langdon, and Langdon could notsee his face, but he did indeed seem to be standing.“Hello?” Langdon choked through his sleeve. Nothing. As he drew nearer, herealized the man was very short. Too short…“What’s happening?” Vittoria called from above, shifting the light.Langdon did not answer. He was now close enough to see it all. With a tremor ofrepulsion, he understood. The chamber seemed to contract around him. Emerginglike a demon from the earthen floor was an old man… or at least half of him. Hewas buried up to his waist in the earth. Standing upright with half of him belowground. Stripped naked. His hands tied behind his back with a red cardinal’ssash. He was propped limply upward, spine arched backward like some sort ofhideous punching bag. The man’s head lay backward, eyes toward the heavens as ifpleading for help from God himself.“Is he dead?” Vittoria called.Langdon moved toward the body. I hope so, for his sake. As he drew to within afew feet, he looked down at the upturned eyes. They bulged outward, blue andbloodshot. Langdon leaned down to listen for breath but immediately recoiled.“For Christ’s sake!”“What!”Langdon almost gagged. “He’s dead all right. I just saw the cause of death.” Thesight was gruesome. The man’s mouth had been jammed open and packed solid withdirt. “Somebody stuffed a fistful of dirt down his throat. He suffocated.”“Dirt?” Vittoria said. “As in… earth?”Langdon did a double take. Earth. He had almost forgotten. The brands. Earth,Air, Fire, Water. The killer had threatened to brand each victim with one of theancient elements of science. The first element was Earth. From Santi’s earthlytomb. Dizzy from the fumes, Langdon circled to the front of the body. As he did,the symbologist within him loudly reasserted the artistic challenge of creatingthe mythical ambigram. Earth? How? And yet, an instant later, it was before him.Centuries of Illuminati legend whirled in his mind. The marking on thecardinal’s chest was charred and oozing. The flesh was seared black. La linguapura…Langdon stared at the brand as the room began to spin.[images/00010.jpg]“Earth,” he whispered, tilting his head to see the symbol upside down. “Earth.”Then, in a wave of horror, he had one final cognition. There are three more."},{"pageContent":"68Despite the soft glow of candlelight in the Sistine Chapel, Cardinal Mortati wason edge. Conclave had officially begun. And it had begun in a most inauspiciousfashion.Half an hour ago, at the appointed hour, Camerlegno Carlo Ventresca had enteredthe chapel. He walked to the front altar and gave opening prayer. Then, heunfolded his hands and spoke to them in a tone as direct as anything Mortati hadever heard from the altar of the Sistine.“You are well aware,” the camerlegno said, “that our four preferiti are notpresent in conclave at this moment. I ask, in the name of his late Holiness,that you proceed as you must… with faith and purpose. May you have only Godbefore your eyes.” Then he turned to go.“But,” one cardinal blurted out, “where are they?”The camerlegno paused. “That I cannot honestly say.”“When will they return?”“That I cannot honestly say.”“Are they okay?”“That I cannot honestly say.”“Will they return?”There was a long pause.“Have faith,” the camerlegno said. Then he walked out of the room.The doors to the Sistine Chapel had been sealed, as was the custom, with twoheavy chains on the outside. Four Swiss Guards stood watch in the hallwaybeyond. Mortati knew the only way the doors could be opened now, prior toelecting a Pope, was if someone inside fell deathly ill, or if the preferitiarrived. Mortati prayed it would be the latter, although from the knot in hisstomach he was not so sure.Proceed as we must, Mortati decided, taking his lead from the resolve in thecamerlegno’s voice. So he had called for a vote. What else could he do?It had taken thirty minutes to complete the preparatory rituals leading up tothis first vote. Mortati had waited patiently at the main altar as eachcardinal, in order of seniority, had approached and performed the specificballoting procedure.Now, at last, the final cardinal had arrived at the altar and was kneelingbefore him.“I call as my witness,” the cardinal declared, exactly as those before him,“Christ the Lord, who will be my judge that my vote is given to the one whobefore God I think should be elected.”The cardinal stood up. He held his ballot high over his head for everyone tosee. Then he lowered the ballot to the altar, where a plate sat atop a largechalice. He placed the ballot on the plate. Next he picked up the plate and usedit to drop the ballot into the chalice. Use of the plate was to ensure no onesecretly dropped multiple ballots.After he had submitted his ballot, he replaced the plate over the chalice, bowedto the cross, and returned to his seat.The final ballot had been cast.Now it was time for Mortati to go to work.Leaving the plate on top of the chalice, Mortati shook the ballots to mix them.Then he removed the plate and extracted a ballot at random. He unfolded it. Theballot was exactly two inches wide. He read aloud for everyone to hear.“Eligo in summum pontificem…” he declared, reading the text that was embossed atthe top of every ballot. I elect as Supreme Pontiff… Then he announced thenominee’s name that had been written beneath it. After he read the name, heraised a threaded needle and pierced the ballot through the word Eligo,carefully sliding the ballot onto the thread. Then he made note of the vote in alogbook.Next, he repeated the entire procedure. He chose a ballot from the chalice, readit aloud, threaded it onto the line, and made note in his log. Almostimmediately, Mortati sensed this first vote would be failed. No consensus. Afteronly seven ballots, already seven different cardinals had been named. As wasnormal, the handwriting on each ballot was disguised by block printing orflamboyant script. The concealment was ironic in this case because the cardinalswere obviously submitting votes for themselves. This apparent conceit, Mortatiknew, had nothing to do with self-centered ambition. It was a holding pattern. Adefensive maneuver. A stall tactic to ensure no cardinal received enough votesto win… and another vote would be forced.The cardinals were waiting for their preferiti…When the last of the ballots had been tallied, Mortati declared the vote“failed.”He took the thread carrying all the ballots and tied the ends together to createa ring. Then he lay the ring of ballots on a silver tray. He added the properchemicals and carried the tray to a small chimney behind him. Here he lit theballots. As the ballots burned, the chemicals he’d added created black smoke.The smoke flowed up a pipe to a hole in the roof where it rose above the chapelfor all to see. Cardinal Mortati had just sent his first communication to theoutside world.One balloting. No Pope."},{"pageContent":"69Nearly asphyxiated by fumes, Langdon struggled up the ladder toward the light atthe top of the pit. Above him he heard voices, but nothing was making sense. Hishead was spinning with images of the branded cardinal.Earth… Earth…As he pushed upward, his vision narrowed and he feared consciousness would slipaway. Two rungs from the top, his balance faltered. He lunged upward trying tofind the lip, but it was too far. He lost his grip on the ladder and almosttumbled backward into the dark. There was a sharp pain under his arms, andsuddenly Langdon was airborne, legs swinging wildly out over the chasm.The strong hands of two Swiss Guards hooked him under the armpits and draggedhim skyward. A moment later Langdon’s head emerged from the Demon’s hole,choking and gasping for air. The guards dragged him over the lip of the opening,across the floor, and lay him down, back against the cold marble floor.For a moment, Langdon was unsure where he was. Overhead he saw stars… orbitingplanets. Hazy figures raced past him. People were shouting. He tried to sit up.He was lying at the base of a stone pyramid. The familiar bite of an angrytongue echoed inside the chapel, and then Langdon knew.Olivetti was screaming at Vittoria. “Why the hell didn’t you figure that out inthe first place!”Vittoria was trying to explain the situation.Olivetti cut her off midsentence and turned to bark orders to his men. “Get thatbody out of there! Search the rest of the building!”Langdon tried to sit up. The Chigi Chapel was packed with Swiss Guards. Theplastic curtain over the chapel opening had been torn off the entryway, andfresh air filled Langdon’s lungs. As his senses slowly returned, Langdon sawVittoria coming toward him. She knelt down, her face like an angel.“You okay?” Vittoria took his arm and felt his pulse. Her hands were tender onhis skin.“Thanks.” Langdon sat up fully. “Olivetti’s mad.”Vittoria nodded. “He has a right to be. We blew it.”“You mean I blew it.”“So redeem yourself. Get him next time.”Next time? Langdon thought it was a cruel comment. There is no next time! Wemissed our shot!Vittoria checked Langdon’s watch. “Mickey says we’ve got forty minutes. Get yourhead together and help me find the next marker.”“I told you, Vittoria, the sculptures are gone. The Path of Illumination is-”Langdon halted.Vittoria smiled softly.Suddenly Langdon was staggering to his feet. He turned dizzying circles, staringat the artwork around him. Pyramids, stars, planets, ellipses. Suddenlyeverything came back. This is the first altar of science! Not the Pantheon! Itdawned on him now how perfectly Illuminati the chapel was, far more subtle andselective than the world famous Pantheon. The Chigi was an out of the wayalcove, a literal hole-in-the-wall, a tribute to a great patron of science,decorated with earthly symbology. Perfect.Langdon steadied himself against the wall and gazed up at the enormous pyramidsculptures. Vittoria was dead right. If this chapel was the first altar ofscience, it might still contain the Illuminati sculpture that served as thefirst marker. Langdon felt an electrifying rush of hope to realize there wasstill a chance. If the marker were indeed here, and they could follow it to thenext altar of science, they might have another chance to catch the killer.Vittoria moved closer. “I found out who the unknown Illuminati sculptor was.”Langdon’s head whipped around. “You what?”“Now we just need to figure out which sculpture in here is the-”“Wait a minute! You know who the Illuminati sculptor was?” He had spent yearstrying to find that information.Vittoria smiled. “It was Bernini.” She paused. “The Bernini.”Langdon immediately knew she was mistaken. Bernini was an impossibility.Gianlorenzo Bernini was the second most famous sculptor of all time, his fameeclipsed only by Michelangelo himself. During the 1600s Bernini created moresculptures than any other artist. Unfortunately, the man they were looking forwas supposedly an unknown, a nobody.Vittoria frowned. “You don’t look excited.”“Bernini is impossible.”“Why? Bernini was a contemporary of Galileo. He was a brilliant sculptor.”“He was a very famous man and a Catholic.”“Yes,” Vittoria said. “Exactly like Galileo.”“No,” Langdon argued. “Nothing like Galileo. Galileo was a thorn in theVatican’s side. Bernini was the Vatican’s wonder boy. The church loved Bernini.He was elected the Vatican’s overall artistic authority. He practically livedinside Vatican City his entire life!”“A perfect cover. Illuminati infiltration.”Langdon felt flustered. “Vittoria, the Illuminati members referred to theirsecret artist as il maestro ignoto-the unknown master.”“Yes, unknown to them. Think of the secrecy of the Masons-only the upper-echelonmembers knew the whole truth. Galileo could have kept Bernini’s true identitysecret from most members… for Bernini’s own safety. That way, the Vatican wouldnever find out.”Langdon was unconvinced but had to admit Vittoria’s logic made strange sense.The Illuminati were famous for keeping secret information compartmentalized,only revealing the truth to upper-level members. It was the cornerstone of theirability to stay secret… very few knew the whole story.“And Bernini’s affiliation with the Illuminati,” Vittoria added with a smile,“explains why he designed those two pyramids.”Langdon turned to the huge sculpted pyramids and shook his head. “Bernini was areligious sculptor. There’s no way he carved those pyramids.”Vittoria shrugged. “Tell that to the sign behind you.”Langdon turned to the plaque:ART OF THE CHIGI CHAPELWhile the architecture is Raphael’s, all interior adornments are those ofGianlorenzo Bernini.Langdon read the plaque twice, and still he was not convinced. GianlorenzoBernini was celebrated for his intricate, holy sculptures of the Virgin Mary,angels, prophets, Popes. What was he doing carving pyramids?Langdon looked up at the towering monuments and felt totally disoriented. Twopyramids, each with a shining, elliptical medallion. They were about asun-Christian as sculpture could get. The pyramids, the stars above, the signs ofthe Zodiac. All interior adornments are those of Gianlorenzo Bernini. If thatwere true, Langdon realized, it meant Vittoria had to be right. By default,Bernini was the Illuminati’s unknown master; nobody else had contributed artworkto this chapel! The implications came almost too fast for Langdon to process.Bernini was an Illuminatus.Bernini designed the Illuminati ambigrams.Bernini laid out the path of Illumination.Langdon could barely speak. Could it be that here in this tiny Chigi Chapel, theworld-renowned Bernini had placed a sculpture that pointed across Rome towardthe next altar of science?“Bernini,” he said. “I never would have guessed.”“Who other than a famous Vatican artist would have had the clout to put hisartwork in specific Catholic chapels around Rome and create the Path ofIllumination? Certainly not an unknown.”Langdon considered it. He looked at the pyramids, wondering if one of them couldsomehow be the marker. Maybe both of them? “The pyramids face oppositedirections,” Langdon said, not sure what to make of them. “They are alsoidentical, so I don’t know which…”“I don’t think the pyramids are what we’re looking for.”“But they’re the only sculptures here.”Vittoria cut him off by pointing toward Olivetti and some of his guards who weregathered near the demon’s hole.Langdon followed the line of her hand to the far wall. At first he saw nothing.Then someone moved and he caught a glimpse. White marble. An arm. A torso. Andthen a sculpted face. Partially hidden in its niche. Two life-size human figuresintertwined. Langdon’s pulse accelerated. He had been so taken with the pyramidsand demon’s hole, he had not even seen this sculpture. He moved across the room,through the crowd. As he drew near, Langdon recognized the work was pureBernini-the intensity of the artistic composition, the intricate faces andflowing clothing, all from the purest white marble Vatican money could buy. Itwas not until he was almost directly in front of it that Langdon recognized thesculpture itself. He stared up at the two faces and gasped.“Who are they?” Vittoria urged, arriving behind him.Langdon stood astonished. “Habakkuk and the Angel,” he said, his voice almostinaudible. The piece was a fairly well-known Bernini work that was included insome art history texts. Langdon had forgotten it was here.“Habakkuk?”“Yes. The prophet who predicted the annihilation of the earth.”Vittoria looked uneasy. “You think this is the marker?”Langdon nodded in amazement. Never in his life had he been so sure of anything.This was the first Illuminati marker. No doubt. Although Langdon had fullyexpected the sculpture to somehow “point” to the next altar of science, he didnot expect it to be literal. Both the angel and Habakkuk had their armsoutstretched and were pointing into the distance.Langdon found himself suddenly smiling. “Not too subtle, is it?”Vittoria looked excited but confused. “I see them pointing, but they arecontradicting each other. The angel is pointing one way, and the prophet theother.”Langdon chuckled. It was true. Although both figures were pointing into thedistance, they were pointing in totally opposite directions. Langdon, however,had already solved that problem. With a burst of energy he headed for the door.“Where are you going?” Vittoria called.“Outside the building!” Langdon’s legs felt light again as he ran toward thedoor. “I need to see what direction that sculpture is pointing!”“Wait! How do you know which finger to follow?”“The poem,” he called over his shoulder. “The last line!”“ ‘Let angels guide you on your lofty quest?’ ” She gazed upward at theoutstretched finger of the angel. Her eyes misted unexpectedly. “Well I’ll bedamned!”"},{"pageContent":"70Gunther Glick and Chinita Macri sat parked in the BBC van in the shadows at thefar end of Piazza del Popolo. They had arrived shortly after the four AlphaRomeos, just in time to witness an inconceivable chain of events. Chinita stillhad no idea what it all meant, but she’d made sure the camera was rolling.As soon as they’d arrived, Chinita and Glick had seen a veritable army of youngmen pour out of the Alpha Romeos and surround the church. Some had weaponsdrawn. One of them, a stiff older man, led a team up the front steps of thechurch. The soldiers drew guns and blew the locks off the front doors. Macriheard nothing and figured they must have had silencers. Then the soldiersentered.Chinita had recommended they sit tight and film from the shadows. After all,guns were guns, and they had a clear view of the action from the van. Glick hadnot argued. Now, across the piazza, men moved in and out of the church. Theyyelled to each other. Chinita adjusted her camera to follow a team as theysearched the surrounding area. All of them, though dressed in civilian clothes,seemed to move with military precision. “Who do you think they are?” she asked.“Hell if I know.” Glick looked riveted. “You getting all this?”“Every frame.”Glick sounded smug. “Still think we should go back to Pope-Watch?”Chinita wasn’t sure what to say. There was obviously something going on here,but she had been in journalism long enough to know that there was often a verydull explanation for interesting events. “This could be nothing,” she said.“These guys could have gotten the same tip you got and are just checking it out.Could be a false alarm.”Glick grabbed her arm. “Over there! Focus.” He pointed back to the church.Chinita swung the camera back to the top of the stairs. “Hello there,” she said,training on the man now emerging from the church.“Who’s the dapper?”Chinita moved in for a close-up. “Haven’t seen him before.” She tightened in onthe man’s face and smiled. “But I wouldn’t mind seeing him again.”Robert Langdon dashed down the stairs outside the church and into the middle ofthe piazza. It was getting dark now, the springtime sun setting late in southernRome. The sun had dropped below the surrounding buildings, and shadows streakedthe square.“Okay, Bernini,” he said aloud to himself. “Where the hell is your angelpointing?”He turned and examined the orientation of the church from which he had justcome. He pictured the Chigi Chapel inside, and the sculpture of the angel insidethat. Without hesitation he turned due west, into the glow of the impendingsunset. Time was evaporating.“Southwest,” he said, scowling at the shops and apartments blocking his view.“The next marker is out there.”Racking his brain, Langdon pictured page after page of Italian art history.Although very familiar with Bernini’s work, Langdon knew the sculptor had beenfar too prolific for any nonspecialist to know all of it. Still, considering therelative fame of the first marker-Habakkuk and the Angel-Langdon hoped thesecond marker was a work he might know from memory.Earth, Air, Fire, Water, he thought. Earth they had found-inside the Chapel ofthe Earth-Habakkuk, the prophet who predicted the earth’s annihilation.Air is next. Langdon urged himself to think. A Bernini sculpture that hassomething to do with Air! He was drawing a total blank. Still he felt energized.I’m on the path of Illumination! It is still intact!Looking southwest, Langdon strained to see a spire or cathedral tower jutting upover the obstacles. He saw nothing. He needed a map. If they could figure outwhat churches were southwest of here, maybe one of them would spark Langdon’smemory. Air, he pressed. Air. Bernini. Sculpture. Air. Think!Langdon turned and headed back up the cathedral stairs. He was met beneath thescaffolding by Vittoria and Olivetti.“Southwest,” Langdon said, panting. “The next church is southwest of here.”Olivetti’s whisper was cold. “You sure this time?”Langdon didn’t bite. “We need a map. One that shows all the churches in Rome.”The commander studied him a moment, his expression never changing.Langdon checked his watch. “We only have half an hour.”Olivetti moved past Langdon down the stairs toward his car, parked directly infront of the cathedral. Langdon hoped he was going for a map.Vittoria looked excited. “So the angel’s pointing southwest? No idea whichchurches are southwest?”“I can’t see past the damn buildings.” Langdon turned and faced the squareagain. “And I don’t know Rome’s churches well enou-” He stopped.Vittoria looked startled. “What?”Langdon looked out at the piazza again. Having ascended the church stairs, hewas now higher, and his view was better. He still couldn’t see anything, but herealized he was moving in the right direction. His eyes climbed the tower ofrickety scaffolding above him. It rose six stories, almost to the top of thechurch’s rose window, far higher than the other buildings in the square. He knewin an instant where he was headed.Across the square, Chinita Macri and Gunther Glick sat glued to the windshieldof the BBC van.“You getting this?” Gunther asked.Macri tightened her shot on the man now climbing the scaffolding. “He’s a littlewell dressed to be playing Spiderman if you ask me.”“And who’s Ms. Spidey?”Chinita glanced at the attractive woman beneath the scaffolding. “Bet you’d liketo find out.”“Think I should call editorial?”“Not yet. Let’s watch. Better to have something in the can before we admit weabandoned conclave.”“You think somebody really killed one of the old farts in there?”Chinita clucked. “You’re definitely going to hell.”“And I’ll be taking the Pulitzer with me.”"},{"pageContent":"71The scaffolding seemed less stable the higher Langdon climbed. His view of Rome,however, got better with every step. He continued upward.He was breathing harder than he expected when he reached the upper tier. Hepulled himself onto the last platform, brushed off the plaster, and stood up.The height did not bother him at all. In fact, it was invigorating.The view was staggering. Like an ocean on fire, the red-tiled rooftops of Romespread out before him, glowing in the scarlet sunset. From that spot, for thefirst time in his life, Langdon saw beyond the pollution and traffic of Rome toits ancient roots-Cittа di Dio-The city of God.Squinting into the sunset, Langdon scanned the rooftops for a church steeple orbell tower. But as he looked farther and farther toward the horizon, he sawnothing. There are hundreds of churches in Rome, he thought. There must be onesouthwest of here! If the church is even visible, he reminded himself. Hell, ifthe church is even still standing!Forcing his eyes to trace the line slowly, he attempted the search again. Heknew, of course, that not all churches would have visible spires, especiallysmaller, out-of-the-way sanctuaries. Not to mention, Rome had changeddramatically since the 1600s when churches were by law the tallest buildingsallowed. Now, as Langdon looked out, he saw apartment buildings, high-rises, TVtowers.For the second time, Langdon’s eye reached the horizon without seeing anything.Not one single spire. In the distance, on the very edge of Rome, Michelangelo’smassive dome blotted the setting sun. St. Peter’s Basilica. Vatican City.Langdon found himself wondering how the cardinals were faring, and if the SwissGuards’ search had turned up the antimatter. Something told him it hadn’t… andwouldn’t.The poem was rattling through his head again. He considered it, carefully, lineby line. From Santi’s earthly tomb with demon’s hole. They had found Santi’stomb. ‘Cross Rome the mystic elements unfold. The mystic elements were Earth,Air, Fire, Water. The path of light is laid, the sacred test. The path ofIllumination formed by Bernini’s sculptures. Let angels guide you on your loftyquest.The angel was pointing southwest…“Front stairs!” Glick exclaimed, pointing wildly through the windshield of theBBC van. “Something’s going on!”Macri dropped her shot back down to the main entrance. Something was definitelygoing on. At the bottom of the stairs, the military-looking man had pulled oneof the Alpha Romeos close to the stairs and opened the trunk. Now he wasscanning the square as if checking for onlookers. For a moment, Macri thoughtthe man had spotted them, but his eyes kept moving. Apparently satisfied, hepulled out a walkie-talkie and spoke into it.Almost instantly, it seemed an army emerged from the church. Like an Americanfootball team breaking from a huddle, the soldiers formed a straight line acrossthe top of the stairs. Moving like a human wall, they began to descend. Behindthem, almost entirely hidden by the wall, four soldiers seemed to be carryingsomething. Something heavy. Awkward.Glick leaned forward on the dashboard. “Are they stealing something from thechurch?”Chinita tightened her shot even more, using the telephoto to probe the wall ofmen, looking for an opening. One split second, she willed. A single frame.That’s all I need. But the men moved as one. Come on! Macri stayed with them,and it paid off. When the soldiers tried to lift the object into the trunk,Macri found her opening. Ironically, it was the older man who faltered. Only foran instant, but long enough. Macri had her frame. Actually, it was more like tenframes.“Call editorial,” Chinita said. “We’ve got a dead body.”Far away, at CERN, Maximilian Kohler maneuvered his wheelchair into LeonardoVetra’s study. With mechanical efficiency, he began sifting through Vetra’sfiles. Not finding what he was after, Kohler moved to Vetra’s bedroom. The topdrawer of his bedside table was locked. Kohler pried it open with a knife fromthe kitchen.Inside Kohler found exactly what he was looking for."},{"pageContent":"72Langdon swung off the scaffolding and dropped back to the ground. He brushed theplaster dust from his clothes. Vittoria was there to greet him.“No luck?” she said.He shook his head.“They put the cardinal in the trunk.”Langdon looked over to the parked car where Olivetti and a group of soldiers nowhad a map spread out on the hood. “Are they looking southwest?”She nodded. “No churches. From here the first one you hit is St. Peter’s.”Langdon grunted. At least they were in agreement. He moved toward Olivetti. Thesoldiers parted to let him through.Olivetti looked up. “Nothing. But this doesn’t show every last church. Just thebig ones. About fifty of them.”“Where are we?” Langdon asked.Olivetti pointed to Piazza del Popolo and traced a straight line exactlysouthwest. The line missed, by a substantial margin, the cluster of blacksquares indicating Rome’s major churches. Unfortunately, Rome’s major churcheswere also Rome’s older churches… those that would have been around in the 1600s.“I’ve got some decisions to make,” Olivetti said. “Are you certain of thedirection?”Langdon pictured the angel’s outstretched finger, the urgency rising in himagain. “Yes, sir. Positive.”Olivetti shrugged and traced the straight line again. The path intersected theMargherita Bridge, Via Cola di Riezo, and passed through Piazza delRisorgimento, hitting no churches at all until it dead-ended abruptly at thecenter of St. Peter’s Square.“What’s wrong with St. Peter’s?” one of the soldiers said. He had a deep scarunder his left eye. “It’s a church.”Langdon shook his head. “Needs to be a public place. Hardly seems public at themoment.”“But the line goes through St. Peter’s Square,” Vittoria added, looking overLangdon’s shoulder. “The square is public.”Langdon had already considered it. “No statues, though.”“Isn’t there a monolith in the middle?”She was right. There was an Egyptian monolith in St. Peter’s Square. Langdonlooked out at the monolith in the piazza in front of them. The lofty pyramid. Anodd coincidence, he thought. He shook it off. “The Vatican’s monolith is not byBernini. It was brought in by Caligula. And it has nothing to do with Air.”There was another problem as well. “Besides, the poem says the elements arespread across Rome. St. Peter’s Square is in Vatican City. Not Rome.”“Depends who you ask,” a guard interjected.Langdon looked up. “What?”“Always a bone of contention. Most maps show St. Peter’s Square as part ofVatican City, but because it’s outside the walled city, Roman officials forcenturies have claimed it as part of Rome.”“You’re kidding,” Langdon said. He had never known that.“I only mention it,” the guard continued, “because Commander Olivetti and Ms.Vetra were asking about a sculpture that had to do with Air.”Langdon was wide-eyed. “And you know of one in St. Peter’s Square?”“Not exactly. It’s not really a sculpture. Probably not relevant.”“Let’s hear it,” Olivetti pressed.The guard shrugged. “The only reason I know about it is because I’m usually onpiazza duty. I know every corner of St. Peter’s Square.”“The sculpture,” Langdon urged. “What does it look like?” Langdon was startingto wonder if the Illuminati could really have been gutsy enough to positiontheir second marker right outside St. Peter’s Church.“I patrol past it every day,” the guard said. “It’s in the center, directlywhere that line is pointing. That’s what made me think of it. As I said, it’snot really a sculpture. It’s more of a… block.”Olivetti looked mad. “A block?”“Yes, sir. A marble block embedded in the square. At the base of the monolith.But the block is not a rectangle. It’s an ellipse. And the block is carved withthe image of a billowing gust of wind.” He paused. “Air, I suppose, if youwanted to get scientific about it.”Langdon stared at the young soldier in amazement. “A relief!” he exclaimedsuddenly.Everyone looked at him.“Relief,” Langdon said, “is the other half of sculpture!” Sculpture is the artof shaping figures in the round and also in relief. He had written thedefinition on chalkboards for years. Reliefs were essentially two-dimensionalsculptures, like Abraham Lincoln’s profile on the penny. Bernini’s Chigi Chapelmedallions were another perfect example.“Bassorelievo?” the guard asked, using the Italian art term.“Yes! Bas-relief!” Langdon rapped his knuckles on the hood. “I wasn’t thinkingin those terms! That tile you’re talking about in St. Peter’s Square is calledthe West Ponente-the West Wind. It’s also known as Respiro di Dio.”“Breath of God?”“Yes! Air! And it was carved and put there by the original architect!”Vittoria looked confused. “But I thought Michelangelo designed St. Peter’s.”“Yes, the basilica!” Langdon exclaimed, triumph in his voice. “But St. Peter’sSquare was designed by Bernini!”As the caravan of Alpha Romeos tore out of Piazza del Popolo, everyone was intoo much of a hurry to notice the BBC van pulling out behind them."},{"pageContent":"73Gunther Glick floored the BBC van’s accelerator and swerved through traffic ashe tailed the four speeding Alpha Romeos across the Tiber River on PonteMargherita. Normally Glick would have made an effort to maintain aninconspicuous distance, but today he could barely keep up. These guys wereflying.Macri sat in her work area in the back of the van finishing a phone call withLondon. She hung up and yelled to Glick over the sound of the traffic. “You wantthe good news or bad news?”Glick frowned. Nothing was ever simple when dealing with the home office. “Badnews.”“Editorial is burned we abandoned our post.”“Surprise.”“They also think your tipster is a fraud.”“Of course.”“And the boss just warned me that you’re a few crumpets short of a proper tea.”Glick scowled. “Great. And the good news?”“They agreed to look at the footage we just shot.”Glick felt his scowl soften into a grin. I guess we’ll see who’s short a fewcrumpets. “So fire it off.”“Can’t transmit until we stop and get a fixed cell read.”Glick gunned the van onto Via Cola di Rienzo. “Can’t stop now.” He tailed theAlpha Romeos through a hard left swerve around Piazza Risorgimento.Macri held on to her computer gear in back as everything slid. “Break mytransmitter,” she warned, “and we’ll have to walk this footage to London.”“Sit tight, love. Something tells me we’re almost there.”Macri looked up. “Where?”Glick gazed out at the familiar dome now looming directly in front of them. Hesmiled. “Right back where we started.”The four Alpha Romeos slipped deftly into traffic surrounding St. Peter’sSquare. They split up and spread out along the piazza perimeter, quietlyunloading men at select points. The debarking guards moved into the throng oftourists and media vans on the edge of the square and instantly becameinvisible. Some of the guards entered the forest of pillars encompassing thecolonnade. They too seemed to evaporate into the surroundings. As Langdonwatched through the windshield, he sensed a noose tightening around St. Peter’s.In addition to the men Olivetti had just dispatched, the commander had radioedahead to the Vatican and sent additional undercover guards to the center whereBernini’s West Ponente was located. As Langdon looked out at the wide-openspaces of St. Peter’s Square, a familiar question nagged. How does theIlluminati assassin plan to get away with this? How will he get a cardinalthrough all these people and kill him in plain view? Langdon checked his MickeyMouse watch. It was 8:54 P.M. Six minutes.In the front seat, Olivetti turned and faced Langdon and Vittoria. “I want youtwo right on top of this Bernini brick or block or whatever the hell it is. Samedrill. You’re tourists. Use the phone if you see anything.”Before Langdon could respond, Vittoria had his hand and was pulling him out ofthe car.The springtime sun was setting behind St. Peter’s Basilica, and a massive shadowspread, engulfing the piazza. Langdon felt an ominous chill as he and Vittoriamoved into the cool, black umbra. Snaking through the crowd, Langdon foundhimself searching every face they passed, wondering if the killer was amongthem. Vittoria’s hand felt warm.As they crossed the open expanse of St. Peter’s Square, Langdon sensed Bernini’ssprawling piazza having the exact effect the artist had been commissioned tocreate-that of “humbling all those who entered.” Langdon certainly felt humbledat the moment. Humbled and hungry, he realized, surprised such a mundane thoughtcould enter his head at a moment like this.“To the obelisk?” Vittoria asked.Langdon nodded, arching left across the piazza.“Time?” Vittoria asked, walking briskly, but casually.“Five of.”Vittoria said nothing, but Langdon felt her grip tighten. He was still carryingthe gun. He hoped Vittoria would not decide she needed it. He could not imagineher whipping out a weapon in St. Peter’s Square and blowing away the kneecaps ofsome killer while the global media looked on. Then again, an incident like thatwould be nothing compared to the branding and murder of a cardinal out here.Air, Langdon thought. The second element of science. He tried to picture thebrand. The method of murder. Again he scanned the sprawling expanse of granitebeneath his feet-St. Peter’s Square-an open desert surrounded by Swiss Guard. Ifthe Hassassin really dared attempt this, Langdon could not imagine how he wouldescape.In the center of the piazza rose Caligula’s 350-ton Egyptian obelisk. Itstretched eighty-one feet skyward to the pyramidal apex onto which was affixed ahollow iron cross. Sufficiently high to catch the last of the evening sun, thecross shone as if magic… purportedly containing relics of the cross on whichChrist was crucified.Two fountains flanked the obelisk in perfect symmetry. Art historians knew thefountains marked the exact geometric focal points of Bernini’s ellipticalpiazza, but it was an architectural oddity Langdon had never really considereduntil today. It seemed Rome was suddenly filled with ellipses, pyramids, andstartling geometry.As they neared the obelisk, Vittoria slowed. She exhaled heavily, as if coaxingLangdon to relax along with her. Langdon made the effort, lowering his shouldersand loosening his clenched jaw.Somewhere around the obelisk, boldly positioned outside the largest church inthe world, was the second altar of science-Bernini’s West Ponente-an ellipticalblock in St. Peter’s Square.Gunther Glick watched from the shadows of the pillars surrounding St. Peter’sSquare. On any other day the man in the tweed jacket and the woman in khakishorts would not have interested him in the least. They appeared to be nothingbut tourists enjoying the square. But today was not any other day. Today hadbeen a day of phone tips, corpses, unmarked cars racing through Rome, and men intweed jackets climbing scaffolding in search of God only knew what. Glick wouldstay with them.He looked out across the square and saw Macri. She was exactly where he had toldher to go, on the far side of the couple, hovering on their flank. Macri carriedher video camera casually, but despite her imitation of a bored member of thepress, she stood out more than Glick would have liked. No other reporters werein this far corner of the square, and the acronym “BBC” stenciled on her camerawas drawing some looks from tourists.The tape Macri had shot earlier of the naked body dumped in the trunk wasplaying at this very moment on the VCR transmitter back in the van. Glick knewthe images were sailing over his head right now en route to London. He wonderedwhat editorial would say.He wished he and Macri had reached the body sooner, before the army ofplainclothed soldiers had intervened. The same army, he knew, had now fanned outand surrounded this piazza. Something big was about to happen.The media is the right arm of anarchy, the killer had said. Glick wondered if hehad missed his chance for a big scoop. He looked out at the other media vans inthe distance and watched Macri tailing the mysterious couple across the piazza.Something told Glick he was still in the game…"},{"pageContent":"74Langdon saw what he was looking for a good ten yards before they reached it.Through the scattered tourists, the white marble ellipse of Bernini’s WestPonente stood out against the gray granite cubes that made up the rest of thepiazza. Vittoria apparently saw it too. Her hand tensed.“Relax,” Langdon whispered. “Do your piranha thing.”Vittoria loosened her grip.As they drew nearer, everything seemed forbiddingly normal. Tourists wandered,nuns chatted along the perimeter of the piazza, a girl fed pigeons at the baseof the obelisk.Langdon refrained from checking his watch. He knew it was almost time.The elliptical stone arrived beneath their feet, and Langdon and Vittoria slowedto a stop-not overeagerly-just two tourists pausing dutifully at a point of mildinterest.“West Ponente,” Vittoria said, reading the inscription on the stone.Langdon gazed down at the marble relief and felt suddenly naпve. Not in his artbooks, not in his numerous trips to Rome, not ever had West Ponente‘ssignificance jumped out at him.Not until now.The relief was elliptical, about three feet long, and carved with a rudimentaryface-a depiction of the West Wind as an angel-like countenance. Gusting from theangel’s mouth, Bernini had drawn a powerful breath of air blowing outward awayfrom the Vatican… the breath of God. This was Bernini’s tribute to the secondelement… Air… an ethereal zephyr blown from angel’s lips. As Langdon stared, herealized the significance of the relief went deeper still. Bernini had carvedthe air in five distinct gusts… five! What was more, flanking the medallion weretwo shining stars. Langdon thought of Galileo. Two stars, five gusts, ellipses,symmetry… He felt hollow. His head hurt.Vittoria began walking again almost immediately, leading Langdon away from therelief. “I think someone’s following us,” she said.Langdon looked up. “Where?”Vittoria moved a good thirty yards before speaking. She pointed up at theVatican as if showing Langdon something on the dome. “The same person has beenbehind us all the way across the square.” Casually, Vittoria glanced over hershoulder. “Still on us. Keep moving.”“You think it’s the Hassassin?”Vittoria shook her head. “Not unless the Illuminati hires women with BBCcameras.”When the bells of St. Peter’s began their deafening clamor, both Langdon andVittoria jumped. It was time. They had circled away from West Ponente in anattempt to lose the reporter but were now moving back toward the relief.Despite the clanging bells, the area seemed perfectly calm. Tourists wandered. Ahomeless drunk dozed awkwardly at the base of the obelisk. A little girl fedpigeons. Langdon wondered if the reporter had scared the killer off. Doubtful,he decided, recalling the killer’s promise. I will make your cardinals medialuminaries.As the echo of the ninth bell faded away, a peaceful silence descended acrossthe square.Then… the little girl began to scream."},{"pageContent":"75Langdon was the first to reach the screaming girl.The terrified youngster stood frozen, pointing at the base of the obelisk wherea shabby, decrepit drunk sat slumped on the stairs. The man was a miserablesight… apparently one of Rome’s homeless. His gray hair hung in greasy strandsin front of his face, and his entire body was wrapped in some sort of dirtycloth. The girl kept screaming as she scampered off into the crowd.Langdon felt an upsurge of dread as he dashed toward the invalid. There was adark, widening stain spreading across the man’s rags. Fresh, flowing blood.Then, it was as if everything happened at once.The old man seemed to crumple in the middle, tottering forward. Langdon lunged,but he was too late. The man pitched forward, toppled off the stairs, and hitthe pavement facedown. Motionless.Langdon dropped to his knees. Vittoria arrived beside him. A crowd wasgathering.Vittoria put her fingers on the man’s throat from behind. “There’s a pulse,” shedeclared. “Roll him.”Langdon was already in motion. Grasping the man’s shoulders, he rolled the body.As he did, the loose rags seemed to slough away like dead flesh. The man floppedlimp onto his back. Dead center of his naked chest was a wide area of charredflesh.Vittoria gasped and pulled back.Langdon felt paralyzed, pinned somewhere between nausea and awe. The symbol hada terrifying simplicity to it.[images/00005.jpg]“Air,” Vittoria choked. “It’s… him.”Swiss Guards appeared from out of nowhere, shouting orders, racing after anunseen assassin.Nearby, a tourist explained that only minutes ago, a dark-skinned man had beenkind enough to help this poor, wheezing, homeless man across the square… evensitting a moment on the stairs with the invalid before disappearing back intothe crowd.Vittoria ripped the rest of the rags off the man’s abdomen. He had two deeppuncture wounds, one on either side of the brand, just below his rib cage. Shecocked the man’s head back and began to administer mouth to mouth. Langdon wasnot prepared for what happened next. As Vittoria blew, the wounds on either sideof the man’s midsection hissed and sprayed blood into the air like blowholes ona whale. The salty liquid hit Langdon in the face.Vittoria stopped short, looking horrified. “His lungs…” she stammered. “They’re…punctured.”Langdon wiped his eyes as he looked down at the two perforations. The holesgurgled. The cardinal’s lungs were destroyed. He was gone.Vittoria covered the body as the Swiss Guards moved in.Langdon stood, disoriented. As he did, he saw her. The woman who had beenfollowing them earlier was crouched nearby. Her BBC video camera was shouldered,aimed, and running. She and Langdon locked eyes, and he knew she’d gotten itall. Then, like a cat, she bolted."},{"pageContent":"76Chinita Macri was on the run. She had the story of her life.Her video camera felt like an anchor as she lumbered across St. Peter’s Square,pushing through the gathering crowd. Everyone seemed to be moving in theopposite direction than her… toward the commotion. Macri was trying to get asfar away as possible. The man in the tweed jacket had seen her, and now shesensed others were after her, men she could not see, closing in from all sides.Macri was still aghast from the images she had just recorded. She wondered ifthe dead man was really who she feared he was. Glick’s mysterious phone contactsuddenly seemed a little less crazy.As she hurried in the direction of the BBC van, a young man with a decidedlymilitaristic air emerged from the crowd before her. Their eyes met, and theyboth stopped. Like lightning, he raised a walkie-talkie and spoke into it. Thenhe moved toward her. Macri wheeled and doubled back into the crowd, her heartpounding.As she stumbled through the mass of arms and legs, she removed the spent videocassette from her camera. Cellulose gold, she thought, tucking the tape underher belt flush to her backside and letting her coat tails cover it. For once shewas glad she carried some extra weight. Glick, where the hell are you!Another soldier appeared to her left, closing in. Macri knew she had littletime. She banked into the crowd again. Yanking a blank cartridge from her case,she slapped it into the camera. Then she prayed.She was thirty yards from the BBC van when the two men materialized directly infront of her, arms folded. She was going nowhere.“Film,” one snapped. “Now.”Macri recoiled, wrapping her arms protectively around her camera. “No chance.”One of the men pulled aside his jacket, revealing a sidearm.“So shoot me,” Macri said, amazed by the boldness of her voice.“Film,” the first one repeated.Where the devil is Glick? Macri stamped her foot and yelled as loudly aspossible, “I am a professional videographer with the BBC! By Article 12 of theFree Press Act, this film is property of the British Broadcast Corporation!”The men did not flinch. The one with the gun took a step toward her. “I am alieutenant with the Swiss Guard, and by the Holy Doctrine governing the propertyon which you are now standing, you are subject to search and seizure.”A crowd had started to gather now around them.Macri yelled, “I will not under any circumstances give you the film in thiscamera without speaking to my editor in London. I suggest you-”The guards ended it. One yanked the camera out of her hands. The other forciblygrabbed her by the arm and twisted her in the direction of the Vatican.“Grazie,” he said, leading her through a jostling crowd.Macri prayed they would not search her and find the tape. If she could somehowprotect the film long enough to-Suddenly, the unthinkable happened. Someone in the crowd was groping under hercoat. Macri felt the video yanked away from her. She wheeled, but swallowed herwords. Behind her, a breathless Gunther Glick gave her a wink and dissolved backinto the crowd."},{"pageContent":"77Robert Langdon staggered into the private bathroom adjoining the Office of thePope. He dabbed the blood from his face and lips. The blood was not his own. Itwas that of Cardinal Lamassй, who had just died horribly in the crowded squareoutside the Vatican. Virgin sacrifices on the altars of science. So far, theHassassin had made good on his threat.Langdon felt powerless as he gazed into the mirror. His eyes were drawn, andstubble had begun to darken his cheeks. The room around him was immaculate andlavish-black marble with gold fixtures, cotton towels, and scented hand soaps.Langdon tried to rid his mind of the bloody brand he had just seen. Air. Theimage stuck. He had witnessed three ambigrams since waking up this morning… andhe knew there were two more coming.Outside the door, it sounded as if Olivetti, the camerlegno, and Captain Rocherwere debating what to do next. Apparently, the antimatter search had turned upnothing so far. Either the guards had missed the canister, or the intruder hadgotten deeper inside the Vatican than Commander Olivetti had been willing toentertain.Langdon dried his hands and face. Then he turned and looked for a urinal. Nourinal. Just a bowl. He lifted the lid.As he stood there, tension ebbing from his body, a giddy wave of exhaustionshuddered through his core. The emotions knotting his chest were so many, soincongruous. He was fatigued, running on no food or sleep, walking the Path ofIllumination, traumatized by two brutal murders. Langdon felt a deepening horrorover the possible outcome of this drama.Think, he told himself. His mind was blank.As he flushed, an unexpected realization hit him. This is the Pope’s toilet, hethought. I just took a leak in the Pope’s toilet. He had to chuckle. The HolyThrone."},{"pageContent":"In London, a BBC technician ejected a video cassette from a satellite receiverunit and dashed across the control room floor. She burst into the office of theeditor-in-chief, slammed the video into his VCR, and pressed play.As the tape rolled, she told him about the conversation she had just had withGunther Glick in Vatican City. In addition, BBC photo archives had just givenher a positive ID on the victim in St. Peter’s Square.When the editor-in-chief emerged from his office, he was ringing a cowbell.Everything in editorial stopped.“Live in five!” the man boomed. “On-air talent to prep! Media coordinators, Iwant your contacts on line! We’ve got a story we’re selling! And we’ve gotfilm!”The market coordinators grabbed their Rolodexes.“Film specs!” one of them yelled.“Thirty-second trim,” the chief replied.“Content?”“Live homicide.”The coordinators looked encouraged. “Usage and licensing price?”“A million U.S. per.”Heads shot up. “What!”“You heard me! I want top of the food chain. CNN, MSNBC, then the big three!Offer a dial-in preview. Give them five minutes to piggyback before BBC runsit.”“What the hell happened?” someone demanded. “The prime minister get skinnedalive?”The chief shook his head. “Better.”At that exact instant, somewhere in Rome, the Hassassin enjoyed a fleetingmoment of repose in a comfortable chair. He admired the legendary chamber aroundhim. I am sitting in the Church of Illumination, he thought. The Illuminatilair. He could not believe it was still here after all of these centuries.Dutifully, he dialed the BBC reporter to whom he had spoken earlier. It wastime. The world had yet to hear the most shocking news of all."},{"pageContent":"79Vittoria Vetra sipped a glass of water and nibbled absently at some tea sconesjust set out by one of the Swiss Guards. She knew she should eat, but she had noappetite. The Office of the Pope was bustling now, echoing with tenseconversations. Captain Rocher, Commander Olivetti, and half a dozen guardsassessed the damage and debated the next move.Robert Langdon stood nearby staring out at St. Peter’s Square. He lookeddejected. Vittoria walked over. “Ideas?”He shook his head.“Scone?”His mood seemed to brighten at the sight of food. “Hell yes. Thanks.” He atevoraciously.The conversation behind them went quiet suddenly when two Swiss Guards escortedCamerlegno Ventresca through the door. If the chamberlain had looked drainedbefore, Vittoria thought, now he looked empty.“What happened?” the camerlegno said to Olivetti. From the look on thecamerlegno’s face, he appeared to have already been told the worst of it.Olivetti’s official update sounded like a battlefield casualty report. He gavethe facts with flat efficacy. “Cardinal Ebner was found dead in the church ofSanta Maria del Popolo just after eight o’clock. He had been suffocated andbranded with the ambigrammatic word ‘Earth.’ Cardinal Lamassй was murdered inSt. Peter’s Square ten minutes ago. He died of perforations to the chest. He wasbranded with the word ‘Air,’ also ambigrammatic. The killer escaped in bothinstances.”The camerlegno crossed the room and sat heavily behind the Pope’s desk. He bowedhis head.“Cardinals Guidera and Baggia, however, are still alive.”The camerlegno’s head shot up, his expression pained. “This is our consolation?Two cardinals have been murdered, commander. And the other two will obviouslynot be alive much longer unless you find them.”“We will find them,” Olivetti assured. “I am encouraged.”“Encouraged? We’ve had nothing but failure.”“Untrue. We’ve lost two battles, signore, but we’re winning the war. TheIlluminati had intended to turn this evening into a media circus. So far we havethwarted their plan. Both cardinals’ bodies have been recovered withoutincident. In addition,” Olivetti continued, “Captain Rocher tells me he ismaking excellent headway on the antimatter search.”Captain Rocher stepped forward in his red beret. Vittoria thought he looked morehuman somehow than the other guards-stern but not so rigid. Rocher’s voice wasemotional and crystalline, like a violin. “I am hopeful we will have thecanister for you within an hour, signore.”“Captain,” the camerlegno said, “excuse me if I seem less than hopeful, but Iwas under the impression that a search of Vatican City would take far more timethan we have.”“A full search, yes. However, after assessing the situation, I am confident theantimatter canister is located in one of our white zones-those Vatican sectorsaccessible to public tours-the museums and St. Peter’s Basilica, for example. Wehave already killed power in those zones and are conducting our scan.”“You intend to search only a small percentage of Vatican City?”“Yes, signore. It is highly unlikely that an intruder gained access to the innerzones of Vatican City. The fact that the missing security camera was stolen froma public access area-a stairwell in one of the museums-clearly implies that theintruder had limited access. Therefore he would only have been able to relocatethe camera and antimatter in another public access area. It is these areas onwhich we are focusing our search.”“But the intruder kidnapped four cardinals. That certainly implies deeperinfiltration than we thought.”“Not necessarily. We must remember that the cardinals spent much of today in theVatican museums and St. Peter’s Basilica, enjoying those areas without thecrowds. It is probable that the missing cardinals were taken in one of theseareas.”“But how were they removed from our walls?”“We are still assessing that.”“I see.” The camerlegno exhaled and stood up. He walked over to Olivetti.“Commander, I would like to hear your contingency plan for evacuation.”“We are still formalizing that, signore. In the meantime, I am faithful CaptainRocher will find the canister.”Rocher clicked his boots as if in appreciation of the vote of confidence. “Mymen have already scanned two-thirds of the white zones. Confidence is high.”The camerlegno did not appear to share that confidence.At that moment the guard with a scar beneath one eye came through the doorcarrying a clipboard and a map. He strode toward Langdon. “Mr. Langdon? I havethe information you requested on the West Ponente.”Langdon swallowed his scone. “Good. Let’s have a look.”The others kept talking while Vittoria joined Robert and the guard as theyspread out the map on the Pope’s desk.The soldier pointed to St. Peter’s Square. “This is where we are. The centralline of West Ponente‘s breath points due east, directly away from Vatican City.”The guard traced a line with his finger from St. Peter’s Square across the TiberRiver and up into the heart of old Rome. “As you can see, the line passesthrough almost all of Rome. There are about twenty Catholic churches that fallnear this line.”Langdon slumped. “Twenty?”“Maybe more.”“Do any of the churches fall directly on the line?”“Some look closer than others,” the guard said, “but translating the exactbearing of the West Ponente onto a map leaves margin for error.”Langdon looked out at St. Peter’s Square a moment. Then he scowled, stroking hischin. “How about fire? Any of them have Bernini artwork that has to do withfire?”Silence.“How about obelisks?” he demanded. “Are any of the churches located nearobelisks?”The guard began checking the map.Vittoria saw a glimmer of hope in Langdon’s eyes and realized what he wasthinking. He’s right! The first two markers had been located on or near piazzasthat contained obelisks! Maybe obelisks were a theme? Soaring pyramids markingthe Illuminati path? The more Vittoria thought about it, the more perfect itseemed… four towering beacons rising over Rome to mark the altars of science.“It’s a long shot,” Langdon said, “but I know that many of Rome’s obelisks wereerected or moved during Bernini’s reign. He was no doubt involved in theirplacement.”“Or,” Vittoria added, “Bernini could have placed his markers near existingobelisks.”Langdon nodded. “True.”“Bad news,” the guard said. “No obelisks on the line.” He traced his fingeracross the map. “None even remotely close. Nothing.”Langdon sighed.Vittoria’s shoulders slumped. She’d thought it was a promising idea. Apparently,this was not going to be as easy as they’d hoped. She tried to stay positive.“Robert, think. You must know of a Bernini statue relating to fire. Anything atall.”“Believe me, I’ve been thinking. Bernini was incredibly prolific. Hundreds ofworks. I was hoping West Ponente would point to a single church. Something thatwould ring a bell.”“Fuтco,” she pressed. “Fire. No Bernini titles jump out?”Langdon shrugged. “There’s his famous sketches of Fireworks, but they’re notsculpture, and they’re in Leipzig, Germany.”Vittoria frowned. “And you’re sure the breath is what indicates the direction?”“You saw the relief, Vittoria. The design was totally symmetrical. The onlyindication of bearing was the breath.”Vittoria knew he was right.“Not to mention,” he added, “because the West Ponente signifies Air, followingthe breath seems symbolically appropriate.”Vittoria nodded. So we follow the breath. But where?Olivetti came over. “What have you got?”“Too many churches,” the soldier said. “Two dozen or so. I suppose we could putfour men on each church-”“Forget it,” Olivetti said. “We missed this guy twice when we knew exactly wherehe was going to be. A mass stakeout means leaving Vatican City unprotected andcanceling the search.”“We need a reference book,” Vittoria said. “An index of Bernini’s work. If wecan scan titles, maybe something will jump out.”“I don’t know,” Langdon said. “If it’s a work Bernini created specifically forthe Illuminati, it may be very obscure. It probably won’t be listed in a book.”Vittoria refused to believe it. “The other two sculptures were fairlywell-known. You’d heard of them both.”Langdon shrugged. “Yeah.”“If we scan titles for references to the word ‘fire,’ maybe we’ll find a statuethat’s listed as being in the right direction.”Langdon seemed convinced it was worth a shot. He turned to Olivetti. “I need alist of all Bernini’s work. You guys probably don’t have a coffee-table Berninibook around here, do you?”“Coffee-table book?” Olivetti seemed unfamiliar with the term.“Never mind. Any list. How about the Vatican Museum? They must have Berninireferences.”The guard with the scar frowned. “Power in the museum is out, and the recordsroom is enormous. Without the staff there to help-”“The Bernini work in question,” Olivetti interrupted. “Would it have beencreated while Bernini was employed here at the Vatican?”“Almost definitely,” Langdon said. “He was here almost his entire career. Andcertainly during the time period of the Galileo conflict.”Olivetti nodded. “Then there’s another reference.”Vittoria felt a flicker of optimism. “Where?”The commander did not reply. He took his guard aside and spoke in hushed tones.The guard seemed uncertain but nodded obediently. When Olivetti was finishedtalking, the guard turned to Langdon.“This way please, Mr. Langdon. It’s nine-fifteen. We’ll have to hurry.”Langdon and the guard headed for the door.Vittoria started after them. “I’ll help.”Olivetti caught her by the arm. “No, Ms. Vetra. I need a word with you.” Hisgrasp was authoritative.Langdon and the guard left. Olivetti’s face was wooden as he took Vittoriaaside. But whatever it was Olivetti had intended to say to her, he never got thechance. His walkie-talkie crackled loudly. “Commandante?”Everyone in the room turned.The voice on the transmitter was grim. “I think you better turn on thetelevision.”"},{"pageContent":"80When Langdon had left the Vatican Secret Archives only two hours ago, he hadnever imagined he would see them again. Now, winded from having jogged theentire way with his Swiss Guard escort, Langdon found himself back at thearchives once again.His escort, the guard with the scar, now led Langdon through the rows oftranslucent cubicles. The silence of the archives felt somehow more forbiddingnow, and Langdon was thankful when the guard broke it.“Over here, I think,” he said, escorting Langdon to the back of the chamberwhere a series of smaller vaults lined the wall. The guard scanned the titles onthe vaults and motioned to one of them. “Yes, here it is. Right where thecommander said it would be.”Langdon read the title. ATTIVI VATICANI. Vatican assets? He scanned the list ofcontents. Real estate… currency… Vatican Bank… antiquities… The list went on.“Paperwork of all Vatican assets,” the guard said.Langdon looked at the cubicle. Jesus. Even in the dark, he could tell it waspacked.“My commander said that whatever Bernini created while under Vatican patronagewould be listed here as an asset.”Langdon nodded, realizing the commander’s instincts just might pay off. InBernini’s day, everything an artist created while under the patronage of thePope became, by law, property of the Vatican. It was more like feudalism thanpatronage, but top artists lived well and seldom complained. “Including worksplaced in churches outside Vatican City?”The soldier gave him an odd look. “Of course. All Catholic churches in Rome areproperty of the Vatican.”Langdon looked at the list in his hand. It contained the names of the twenty orso churches that were located on a direct line with West Ponente‘s breath. Thethird altar of science was one of them, and Langdon hoped he had time to figureout which it was. Under other circumstances, he would gladly have explored eachchurch in person. Today, however, he had about twenty minutes to find what hewas looking for-the one church containing a Bernini tribute to fire.Langdon walked to the vault’s electronic revolving door. The guard did notfollow. Langdon sensed an uncertain hesitation. He smiled. “The air’s fine.Thin, but breathable.”“My orders are to escort you here and then return immediately to the securitycenter.”“You’re leaving?”“Yes. The Swiss Guard are not allowed inside the archives. I am breachingprotocol by escorting you this far. The commander reminded me of that.”“Breaching protocol?” Do you have any idea what is going on here tonight? “Whoseside is your damn commander on!”All friendliness disappeared from the guard’s face. The scar under his eyetwitched. The guard stared, looking suddenly a lot like Olivetti himself.“I apologize,” Langdon said, regretting the comment. “It’s just… I could usesome help.”The guard did not blink. “I am trained to follow orders. Not debate them. Whenyou find what you are looking for, contact the commander immediately.”Langdon was flustered. “But where will he be?”The guard removed his walkie-talkie and set it on a nearby table. “Channel one.”Then he disappeared into the dark."},{"pageContent":"81The television in the Office of the Pope was an oversized Hitachi hidden in arecessed cabinet opposite his desk. The doors to the cabinet were now open, andeveryone gathered around. Vittoria moved in close. As the screen warmed up, ayoung female reporter came into view. She was a doe-eyed brunette.“For MSNBC news,” she announced, “this is Kelly Horan-Jones, live from VaticanCity.” The image behind her was a night shot of St. Peter’s Basilica with allits lights blazing.“You’re not live,” Rocher snapped. “That’s stock footage! The lights in thebasilica are out.”Olivetti silenced him with a hiss.The reporter continued, sounding tense. “Shocking developments in the Vaticanelections this evening. We have reports that two members of the College ofCardinals have been brutally murdered in Rome.”Olivetti swore under his breath.As the reporter continued, a guard appeared at the door, breathless. “Commander,the central switchboard reports every line lit. They’re requesting our officialposition on-”“Disconnect it,” Olivetti said, never taking his eyes from the TV.The guard looked uncertain. “But, commander-”“Go!”The guard ran off.Vittoria sensed the camerlegno had wanted to say something but had stoppedhimself. Instead, the man stared long and hard at Olivetti before turning backto the television.MSNBC was now running tape. The Swiss Guards carried the body of Cardinal Ebnerdown the stairs outside Santa Maria del Popolo and lifted him into an AlphaRomeo. The tape froze and zoomed in as the cardinal’s naked body became visiblejust before they deposited him in the trunk of the car.“Who the hell shot this footage?” Olivetti demanded.The MSNBC reporter kept talking. “This is believed to be the body of CardinalEbner of Frankfurt, Germany. The men removing his body from the church arebelieved to be Vatican Swiss Guard.” The reporter looked like she was makingevery effort to appear appropriately moved. They closed in on her face, and shebecame even more somber. “At this time, MSNBC would like to issue our viewers adiscretionary warning. The images we are about to show are exceptionally vividand may not be suitable for all audiences.”Vittoria grunted at the station’s feigned concern for viewer sensibility,recognizing the warning as exactly what it was-the ultimate media “teaser line.”Nobody ever changed channels after a promise like that.The reporter drove it home. “Again, this footage may be shocking to someviewers.”“What footage?” Olivetti demanded. “You just showed-”The shot that filled the screen was of a couple in St. Peter’s Square, movingthrough the crowd. Vittoria instantly recognized the two people as Robert andherself. In the corner of the screen was a text overlay: COURTESY OF THE BBC. Abell was tolling.“Oh, no,” Vittoria said aloud. “Oh… no.”The camerlegno looked confused. He turned to Olivetti. “I thought you said youconfiscated this tape!”Suddenly, on television, a child was screaming. The image panned to find alittle girl pointing at what appeared to be a bloody homeless man. RobertLangdon entered abruptly into the frame, trying to help the little girl. Theshot tightened.Everyone in the Pope’s office stared in horrified silence as the drama unfoldedbefore them. The cardinal’s body fell face first onto the pavement. Vittoriaappeared and called orders. There was blood. A brand. A ghastly, failed attemptto administer CPR.“This astonishing footage,” the reporter was saying, “was shot only minutes agooutside the Vatican. Our sources tell us this is the body of Cardinal Lamassйfrom France. How he came to be dressed this way and why he was not in conclaveremain a mystery. So far, the Vatican has refused to comment.” The tape began toroll again.“Refused comment?” Rocher said. “Give us a damn minute!”The reporter was still talking, her eyebrows furrowing with intensity. “AlthoughMSNBC has yet to confirm a motive for the attack, our sources tell us thatresponsibility for the murders has been claimed by a group calling themselvesthe Illuminati.”Olivetti exploded. “What!”“… find out more about the Illuminati by visiting our website at-”“Non й posibile!” Olivetti declared. He switched channels.This station had a Hispanic male reporter. “-a satanic cult known as theIlluminati, who some historians believe-”Olivetti began pressing the remote wildly. Every channel was in the middle of alive update. Most were in English.“-Swiss Guards removing a body from a church earlier this evening. The body isbelieved to be that of Cardinal-”“-lights in the basilica and museums are extinguished leaving speculation-”“-will be speaking with conspiracy theorist Tyler Tingley, about this shockingresurgence-”“-rumors of two more assassinations planned for later this evening-”“-questioning now whether papal hopeful Cardinal Baggia is among the missing-”Vittoria turned away. Everything was happening so fast. Outside the window, inthe settling dark, the raw magnetism of human tragedy seemed to be suckingpeople toward Vatican City. The crowd in the square thickened almost by theinstant. Pedestrians streamed toward them while a new batch of media personnelunloaded vans and staked their claim in St. Peter’s Square.Olivetti set down the remote control and turned to the camerlegno. “Signore, Icannot imagine how this could happen. We took the tape that was in that camera!”The camerlegno looked momentarily too stunned to speak.Nobody said a word. The Swiss Guards stood rigid at attention.“It appears,” the camerlegno said finally, sounding too devastated to be angry,“that we have not contained this crisis as well as I was led to believe.” Helooked out the window at the gathering masses. “I need to make an address.”Olivetti shook his head. “No, signore. That is exactly what the Illuminati wantyou to do-confirm them, empower them. We must remain silent.”“And these people?” The camerlegno pointed out the window. “There will be tensof thousands shortly. Then hundreds of thousands. Continuing this charade onlyputs them in danger. I need to warn them. Then we need to evacuate our Collegeof Cardinals.”“There is still time. Let Captain Rocher find the antimatter.”The camerlegno turned. “Are you attempting to give me an order?”“No, I am giving you advice. If you are concerned about the people outside, wecan announce a gas leak and clear the area, but admitting we are hostage isdangerous.”“Commander, I will only say this once. I will not use this office as a pulpit tolie to the world. If I announce anything at all, it will be the truth.”“The truth? That Vatican City is threatened to be destroyed by satanicterrorists? It only weakens our position.”The camerlegno glared. “How much weaker could our position be?”Rocher shouted suddenly, grabbing the remote and increasing the volume on thetelevision. Everyone turned.On air, the woman from MSNBC now looked genuinely unnerved. Superimposed besideher was a photo of the late Pope. “… breaking information. This just in from theBBC…” She glanced off camera as if to confirm she was really supposed to makethis announcement. Apparently getting confirmation, she turned and grimly facedthe viewers. “The Illuminati have just claimed responsibility for…” Shehesitated. “They have claimed responsibility for the death of the Pope fifteendays ago.”The camerlegno’s jaw fell.Rocher dropped the remote control.Vittoria could barely process the information.“By Vatican law,” the woman continued, “no formal autopsy is ever performed on aPope, so the Illuminati claim of murder cannot be confirmed. Nonetheless, theIlluminati hold that the cause of the late Pope’s death was not a stroke as theVatican reported, but poisoning.”The room went totally silent again.Olivetti erupted. “Madness! A bold-faced lie!”Rocher began flipping channels again. The bulletin seemed to spread like aplague from station to station. Everyone had the same story. Headlines competedfor optimal sensationalism.MURDER AT THE VATICANPOPE POISONEDSATAN TOUCHES HOUSE OF GODThe camerlegno looked away. “God help us.”As Rocher flipped, he passed a BBC station. “-tipped me off about the killing atSanta Maria de Popolo-”“Wait!” the camerlegno said. “Back.”Rocher went back. On screen, a prim-looking man sat at a BBC news desk.Superimposed over his shoulder was a still snapshot of an odd-looking man with ared beard. Underneath his photo, it said: GUNTHER GLICK-LIVE IN VATICAN CITY.Reporter Glick was apparently reporting by phone, the connection scratchy. “… myvideographer got the footage of the cardinal being removed from the ChigiChapel.”“Let me reiterate for our viewers,” the anchorman in London was saying, “BBCreporter Gunther Glick is the man who first broke this story. He has been inphone contact twice now with the alleged Illuminati assassin. Gunther, you saythe assassin phoned only moments ago to pass along a message from theIlluminati?”“He did.”“And their message was that the Illuminati were somehow responsible for thePope’s death?” The anchorman sounded incredulous.“Correct. The caller told me that the Pope’s death was not a stroke, as theVatican had thought, but rather that the Pope had been poisoned by theIlluminati.”Everyone in the Pope’s office froze.“Poisoned?” the anchorman demanded. “But… but how!”“They gave no specifics,” Glick replied, “except to say that they killed himwith a drug known as…”-there was a rustling of papers on the line-“somethingknown as Heparin.”The camerlegno, Olivetti, and Rocher all exchanged confused looks.“Heparin?” Rocher demanded, looking unnerved. “But isn’t that… ?”The camerlegno blanched. “The Pope’s medication.”Vittoria was stunned. “The Pope was on Heparin?”“He had thrombophlebitis,” the camerlegno said. “He took an injection once aday.”Rocher looked flabbergasted. “But Heparin isn’t a poison. Why would theIlluminati claim-”“Heparin is lethal in the wrong dosages,” Vittoria offered. “It’s a powerfulanticoagulant. An overdose would cause massive internal bleeding and brainhemorrhages.”Olivetti eyed her suspiciously. “How would you know that?”“Marine biologists use it on sea mammals in captivity to prevent blood clottingfrom decreased activity. Animals have died from improper administration of thedrug.” She paused. “A Heparin overdose in a human would cause symptoms easilymistaken for a stroke… especially in the absence of a proper autopsy.”The camerlegno now looked deeply troubled.“Signore,” Olivetti said, “this is obviously an Illuminati ploy for publicity.Someone overdosing the Pope would be impossible. Nobody had access. And even ifwe take the bait and try to refute their claim, how could we? Papal lawprohibits autopsy. Even with an autopsy, we would learn nothing. We would findtraces of Heparin in his body from his daily injections.”“True.” The camerlegno’s voice sharpened. “And yet something else troubles me.No one on the outside knew His Holiness was taking this medication.”There was a silence.“If he overdosed with Heparin,” Vittoria said, “his body would show signs.”Olivetti spun toward her. “Ms. Vetra, in case you didn’t hear me, papalautopsies are prohibited by Vatican Law. We are not about to defile HisHoliness’s body by cutting him open just because an enemy makes a tauntingclaim!”Vittoria felt shamed. “I was not implying…” She had not meant to seemdisrespectful. “I certainly was not suggesting you exhume the Pope…” Shehesitated, though. Something Robert told her in the Chigi passed like a ghostthrough her mind. He had mentioned that papal sarcophagi were above ground andnever cemented shut, a throwback to the days of the pharaohs when sealing andburying a casket was believed to trap the deceased’s soul inside. Gravity hadbecome the mortar of choice, with coffin lids often weighing hundreds of pounds.Technically, she realized, it would be possible to-“What sort of signs?” the camerlegno said suddenly.Vittoria felt her heart flutter with fear. “Overdoses can cause bleeding of theoral mucosa.”“Oral what?”“The victim’s gums would bleed. Post mortem, the blood congeals and turns theinside of the mouth black.” Vittoria had once seen a photo taken at an aquariumin London where a pair of killer whales had been mistakenly overdosed by theirtrainer. The whales floated lifeless in the tank, their mouths hanging open andtheir tongues black as soot.The camerlegno made no reply. He turned and stared out the window.Rocher’s voice had lost its optimism. “Signore, if this claim about poisoning istrue…”“It’s not true,” Olivetti declared. “Access to the Pope by an outsider isutterly impossible.”“If this claim is true,” Rocher repeated, “and our Holy Father was poisoned,then that has profound implications for our antimatter search. The allegedassassination implies a much deeper infiltration of Vatican City than we hadimagined. Searching the white zones may be inadequate. If we are compromised tosuch a deep extent, we may not find the canister in time.”Olivetti leveled his captain with a cold stare. “Captain, I will tell you whatis going to happen.”“No,” the camerlegno said, turning suddenly. “I will tell you what is going tohappen.” He looked directly at Olivetti. “This has gone far enough. In twentyminutes I will be making a decision whether or not to cancel conclave andevacuate Vatican City. My decision will be final. Is that clear?”Olivetti did not blink. Nor did he respond.The camerlegno spoke forcefully now, as though tapping a hidden reserve ofpower. “Captain Rocher, you will complete your search of the white zones andreport directly to me when you are finished.”Rocher nodded, throwing Olivetti an uneasy glance.The camerlegno then singled out two guards. “I want the BBC reporter, Mr. Glick,in this office immediately. If the Illuminati have been communicating with him,he may be able to help us. Go.”The two soldiers disappeared.Now the camerlegno turned and addressed the remaining guards. “Gentlemen, I willnot permit any more loss of life this evening. By ten o’clock you will locatethe remaining two cardinals and capture the monster responsible for thesemurders. Do I make myself understood?”“But, signore,” Olivetti argued, “we have no idea where-”“Mr. Langdon is working on that. He seems capable. I have faith.”With that, the camerlegno strode for the door, a new determination in his step.On his way out, he pointed to three guards. “You three, come with me. Now.”The guards followed.In the doorway, the camerlegno stopped. He turned to Vittoria. “Ms. Vetra. Youtoo. Please come with me.”Vittoria hesitated. “Where are we going?”He headed out the door. “To see an old friend.”"},{"pageContent":"82At CERN, secretary Sylvie Baudeloque was hungry, wishing she could go home. Toher dismay, Kohler had apparently survived his trip to the infirmary; he hadphoned and demanded-not asked, demanded-that Sylvie stay late this evening. Noexplanation.Over the years, Sylvie had programmed herself to ignore Kohler’s bizarre moodswings and eccentricities-his silent treatments, his unnerving propensity tosecretly film meetings with his wheelchair’s porta-video. She secretly hoped oneday he would shoot himself during his weekly visit to CERN’s recreational pistolrange, but apparently he was a pretty good shot.Now, sitting alone at her desk, Sylvie heard her stomach growling. Kohler hadnot yet returned, nor had he given her any additional work for the evening. Tohell with sitting here bored and starving, she decided. She left Kohler a noteand headed for the staff dining commons to grab a quick bite.She never made it.As she passed CERN’s recreational “suites de loisir”- a long hallway of loungeswith televisions-she noticed the rooms were overflowing with employees who hadapparently abandoned dinner to watch the news. Something big was going on.Sylvie entered the first suite. It was packed with byte-heads-wild youngcomputer programmers. When she saw the headlines on the TV, she gasped.TERROR AT THE VATICANSylvie listened to the report, unable to believe her ears. Some ancientbrotherhood killing cardinals? What did that prove? Their hatred? Theirdominance? Their ignorance?And yet, incredibly, the mood in this suite seemed anything but somber.Two young techies ran by waving T-shirts that bore a picture of Bill Gates andthe message: AND THE GEEK SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH!“Illuminati!” one shouted. “I told you these guys were real!”“Incredible! I thought it was just a game!”“They killed the Pope, man! The Pope!”“Jeez! I wonder how many points you get for that?”They ran off laughing.Sylvie stood in stunned amazement. As a Catholic working among scientists, sheoccasionally endured the antireligious whisperings, but the party these kidsseemed to be having was all-out euphoria over the church’s loss. How could theybe so callous? Why the hatred?For Sylvie, the church had always been an innocuous entity… a place offellowship and introspection… sometimes just a place to sing out loud withoutpeople staring at her. The church recorded the benchmarks of her life-funerals,weddings, baptisms, holidays-and it asked for nothing in return. Even themonetary dues were voluntary. Her children emerged from Sunday School every weekuplifted, filled with ideas about helping others and being kinder. What couldpossibly be wrong with that?It never ceased to amaze her that so many of CERN’s so-called “brilliant minds”failed to comprehend the importance of the church. Did they really believequarks and mesons inspired the average human being? Or that equations couldreplace someone’s need for faith in the divine?Dazed, Sylvie moved down the hallway past the other lounges. All the TV roomswere packed. She began wondering now about the call Kohler had gotten from theVatican earlier. Coincidence? Perhaps. The Vatican called CERN from time to timeas a “courtesy” before issuing scathing statements condemning CERN’sresearch-most recently for CERN’s breakthroughs in nanotechnology, a field thechurch denounced because of its implications for genetic engineering. CERN nevercared. Invariably, within minutes after a Vatican salvo, Kohler’s phone wouldring off the hook with tech-investment companies wanting to license the newdiscovery. “No such thing as bad press,” Kohler would always say.Sylvie wondered if she should page Kohler, wherever the hell he was, and tellhim to turn on the news. Did he care? Had he heard? Of course, he’d heard. Hewas probably videotaping the entire report with his freaky little camcorder,smiling for the first time in a year.As Sylvie continued down the hall, she finally found a lounge where the mood wassubdued… almost melancholy. Here the scientists watching the report were some ofCERN’s oldest and most respected. They did not even look up as Sylvie slipped inand took a seat.On the other side of CERN, in Leonardo Vetra’s frigid apartment, MaximilianKohler had finished reading the leather-bound journal he’d taken from Vetra’sbedside table. Now he was watching the television reports. After a few minutes,he replaced Vetra’s journal, turned off the television, and left the apartment.Far away, in Vatican City, Cardinal Mortati carried another tray of ballots tothe Sistine Chapel chimney. He burned them, and the smoke was black.Two ballotings. No Pope."},{"pageContent":"83Flashlights were no match for the voluminous blackness of St. Peter’s Basilica.The void overhead pressed down like a starless night, and Vittoria felt theemptiness spread out around her like a desolate ocean. She stayed close as theSwiss Guards and the camerlegno pushed on. High above, a dove cooed andfluttered away.As if sensing her discomfort, the camerlegno dropped back and lay a hand on hershoulder. A tangible strength transferred in the touch, as if the man weremagically infusing her with the calm she needed to do what they were about todo.What are we about to do? she thought. This is madness!And yet, Vittoria knew, for all its impiety and inevitable horror, the task athand was inescapable. The grave decisions facing the camerlegno requiredinformation… information entombed in a sarcophagus in the Vatican Grottoes. Shewondered what they would find. Did the Illuminati murder the Pope? Did theirpower really reach so far? Am I really about to perform the first papal autopsy?Vittoria found it ironic that she felt more apprehensive in this unlit churchthan she would swimming at night with barracuda. Nature was her refuge. Sheunderstood nature. But it was matters of man and spirit that left her mystified.Killer fish gathering in the dark conjured images of the press gatheringoutside. TV footage of branded bodies reminded her of her father’s corpse… andthe killer’s harsh laugh. The killer was out there somewhere. Vittoria felt theanger drowning her fear.As they circled past a pillar-thicker in girth than any redwood she couldimagine-Vittoria saw an orange glow up ahead. The light seemed to emanate frombeneath the floor in the center of the basilica. As they came closer, sherealized what she was seeing. It was the famous sunken sanctuary beneath themain altar-the sumptuous underground chamber that held the Vatican’s most sacredrelics. As they drew even with the gate surrounding the hollow, Vittoria gazeddown at the golden coffer surrounded by scores of glowing oil lamps.“St. Peter’s bones?” she asked, knowing full well that they were. Everyone whocame to St. Peter’s knew what was in the golden casket.“Actually, no,” the camerlegno said. “A common misconception. That’s not areliquary. The box holds palliums-woven sashes that the Pope gives to newlyelected cardinals.”“But I thought-”“As does everyone. The guidebooks label this as St. Peter’s tomb, but his truegrave is two stories beneath us, buried in the earth. The Vatican excavated itin the forties. Nobody is allowed down there.”Vittoria was shocked. As they moved away from the glowing recession into thedarkness again, she thought of the stories she’d heard of pilgrims travelingthousands of miles to look at that golden box, thinking they were in thepresence of St. Peter. “Shouldn’t the Vatican tell people?”“We all benefit from a sense of contact with divinity… even if it is onlyimagined.”Vittoria, as a scientist, could not argue the logic. She had read countlessstudies of the placebo effect-aspirins curing cancer in people who believed theywere using a miracle drug. What was faith, after all?“Change,” the camerlegno said, “is not something we do well within Vatican City.Admitting our past faults, modernization, are things we historically eschew. HisHoliness was trying to change that.” He paused. “Reaching to the modern world.Searching for new paths to God.”Vittoria nodded in the dark. “Like science?”“To be honest, science seems irrelevant.”“Irrelevant?” Vittoria could think of a lot of words to describe science, but inthe modern world “irrelevant” did not seem like one of them.“Science can heal, or science can kill. It depends on the soul of the man usingthe science. It is the soul that interests me.”“When did you hear your call?”“Before I was born.”Vittoria looked at him.“I’m sorry, that always seems like a strange question. What I mean is that I’vealways known I would serve God. From the moment I could first think. It wasn’tuntil I was a young man, though, in the military, that I truly understood mypurpose.”Vittoria was surprised. “You were in the military?”“Two years. I refused to fire a weapon, so they made me fly instead. Medevachelicopters. In fact, I still fly from time to time.”Vittoria tried to picture the young priest flying a helicopter. Oddly, she couldsee him perfectly behind the controls. Camerlegno Ventresca possessed a gritthat seemed to accentuate his conviction rather than cloud it. “Did you ever flythe Pope?”“Heavens no. We left that precious cargo to the professionals. His Holiness letme take the helicopter to our retreat in Gandolfo sometimes.” He paused, lookingat her. “Ms. Vetra, thank you for your help here today. I am very sorry aboutyour father. Truly.”“Thank you.”“I never knew my father. He died before I was born. I lost my mother when I wasten.”Vittoria looked up. “You were orphaned?” She felt a sudden kinship.“I survived an accident. An accident that took my mother.”“Who took care of you?”“God,” the camerlegno said. “He quite literally sent me another father. A bishopfrom Palermo appeared at my hospital bed and took me in. At the time I was notsurprised. I had sensed God’s watchful hand over me even as a boy. The bishop’sappearance simply confirmed what I had already suspected, that God had somehowchosen me to serve him.”“You believed God chose you?”“I did. And I do.” There was no trace of conceit in the camerlegno’s voice, onlygratitude. “I worked under the bishop’s tutelage for many years. He eventuallybecame a cardinal. Still, he never forgot me. He is the father I remember.” Abeam of a flashlight caught the camerlegno’s face, and Vittoria sensed aloneliness in his eyes.The group arrived beneath a towering pillar, and their lights converged on anopening in the floor. Vittoria looked down at the staircase descending into thevoid and suddenly wanted to turn back. The guards were already helping thecamerlegno onto the stairs. They helped her next.“What became of him?” she asked, descending, trying to keep her voice steady.“The cardinal who took you in?”“He left the College of Cardinals for another position.”Vittoria was surprised.“And then, I’m sorry to say, he passed on.”“Le mie condoglianze,” Vittoria said. “Recently?”The camerlegno turned, shadows accentuating the pain on his face. “Exactlyfifteen days ago. We are going to see him right now.”"},{"pageContent":"84The dark lights glowed hot inside the archival vault. This vault was muchsmaller than the previous one Langdon had been in. Less air. Less time. Hewished he’d asked Olivetti to turn on the recirculating fans.Langdon quickly located the section of assets containing the ledgers catalogingBelle Arti. The section was impossible to miss. It occupied almost eight fullstacks. The Catholic church owned millions of individual pieces worldwide.Langdon scanned the shelves searching for Gianlorenzo Bernini. He began hissearch about midway down the first stack, at about the spot he thought the B‘swould begin. After a moment of panic fearing the ledger was missing, herealized, to his greater dismay, that the ledgers were not arrangedalphabetically. Why am I not surprised?It was not until Langdon circled back to the beginning of the collection andclimbed a rolling ladder to the top shelf that he understood the vault’sorganization. Perched precariously on the upper stacks he found the fattestledgers of all-those belonging to the masters of the Renaissance-Michelangelo,Raphael, da Vinci, Botticelli. Langdon now realized, appropriate to a vaultcalled “Vatican Assets,” the ledgers were arranged by the overall monetary valueof each artist’s collection. Sandwiched between Raphael and Michelangelo,Langdon found the ledger marked Bernini. It was over five inches thick.Already short of breath and struggling with the cumbersome volume, Langdondescended the ladder. Then, like a kid with a comic book, he spread himself outon the floor and opened the cover.The book was cloth-bound and very solid. The ledger was handwritten in Italian.Each page cataloged a single work, including a short description, date,location, cost of materials, and sometimes a rough sketch of the piece. Langdonfanned through the pages… over eight hundred in all. Bernini had been a busyman.As a young student of art, Langdon had wondered how single artists could createso much work in their lifetimes. Later he learned, much to his disappointment,that famous artists actually created very little of their own work. They ranstudios where they trained young artists to carry out their designs. Sculptorslike Bernini created miniatures in clay and hired others to enlarge them intomarble. Langdon knew that if Bernini had been required to personally completeall of his commissions, he would still be working today.“Index,” he said aloud, trying to ward off the mental cobwebs. He flipped to theback of the book, intending to look under the letter F for titles containing theword fuтco-fire-but the F‘s were not together. Langdon swore under his breath.What the hell do these people have against alphabetizing?The entries had apparently been logged chronologically, one by one, as Berninicreated each new work. Everything was listed by date. No help at all.As Langdon stared at the list, another disheartening thought occurred to him.The title of the sculpture he was looking for might not even contain the wordFire. The previous two works-Habakkuk and the Angel and West Ponente-had notcontained specific references to Earth or Air.He spent a minute or two flipping randomly through the ledger in hopes that anillustration might jump out at him. Nothing did. He saw dozens of obscure workshe had never heard of, but he also saw plenty he recognized… Daniel and theLion, Apollo and Daphne, as well as a half dozen fountains. When he saw thefountains, his thoughts skipped momentarily ahead. Water. He wondered if thefourth altar of science was a fountain. A fountain seemed a perfect tribute towater. Langdon hoped they could catch the killer before he had to considerWater-Bernini had carved dozens of fountains in Rome, most of them in front ofchurches.Langdon turned back to the matter at hand. Fire. As he looked through the book,Vittoria’s words encouraged him. You were familiar with the first twosculptures… you probably know this one too. As he turned to the index again, hescanned for titles he knew. Some were familiar, but none jumped out. Langdon nowrealized he would never complete his search before passing out, so he decided,against his better judgment, that he would have to take the book outside thevault. It’s only a ledger, he told himself. It’s not like I’m removing anoriginal Galilean folio. Langdon recalled the folio in his breast pocket andreminded himself to return it before leaving.Hurrying now, he reached down to lift the volume, but as he did, he sawsomething that gave him pause. Although there were numerous notations throughoutthe index, the one that had just caught his eye seemed odd.The note indicated that the famous Bernini sculpture, The Ecstasy of St. Teresa,shortly after its unveiling, had been moved from its original location insidethe Vatican. This in itself was not what had caught Langdon’s eye. He wasalready familiar with the sculpture’s checkered past. Though some thought it amasterpiece, Pope Urban VIII had rejected The Ecstasy of St. Teresa as toosexually explicit for the Vatican. He had banished it to some obscure chapelacross town. What had caught Langdon’s eye was that the work had apparently beenplaced in one of the five churches on his list. What was more, the noteindicated it had been moved there per suggerimento del artista.By suggestion of the artist? Langdon was confused. It made no sense that Berninihad suggested his masterpiece be hidden in some obscure location. All artistswanted their work displayed prominently, not in some remote-Langdon hesitated. Unless…He was fearful even to entertain the notion. Was it possible? Had Berniniintentionally created a work so explicit that it forced the Vatican to hide itin some out-of-the-way spot? A location perhaps that Bernini himself couldsuggest? Maybe a remote church on a direct line with West Ponente‘s breath?As Langdon’s excitement mounted, his vague familiarity with the statueintervened, insisting the work had nothing to do with fire. The sculpture, asanyone who had seen it could attest, was anything but scientific-pornographicmaybe, but certainly not scientific. An English critic had once condemned TheEcstasy of St. Teresa as “the most unfit ornament ever to be placed in aChristian Church.” Langdon certainly understood the controversy. Thoughbrilliantly rendered, the statue depicted St. Teresa on her back in the throesof a toe-curling orgasm. Hardly Vatican fare.Langdon hurriedly flipped to the ledger’s description of the work. When he sawthe sketch, he felt an instantaneous and unexpected tingle of hope. In thesketch, St. Teresa did indeed appear to be enjoying herself, but there wasanother figure in the statue who Langdon had forgotten was there.An angel.The sordid legend suddenly came back…St. Teresa was a nun sainted after she claimed an angel had paid her a blissfulvisit in her sleep. Critics later decided her encounter had probably been moresexual than spiritual. Scrawled at the bottom of the ledger, Langdon saw afamiliar excerpt. St. Teresa’s own words left little to the imagination:… his great golden spear… filled with fire… plunged into me several times…penetrated to my entrails… a sweetness so extreme that one could not possiblywish it to stop.Langdon smiled. If that’s not a metaphor for some serious sex, I don’t know whatis. He was smiling also because of the ledger’s description of the work.Although the paragraph was in Italian, the word fuтco appeared a half dozentimes:… angel’s spear tipped with point of fire…… angel’s head emanating rays of fire…… woman inflamed by passion’s fire…Langdon was not entirely convinced until he glanced up at the sketch again. Theangel’s fiery spear was raised like a beacon, pointing the way. Let angels guideyou on your lofty quest. Even the type of angel Bernini had selected seemedsignificant. It’s a seraphim, Langdon realized. Seraphim literally means “thefiery one.”Robert Langdon was not a man who had ever looked for confirmation from above,but when he read the name of the church where the sculpture now resided, hedecided he might become a believer after all.Santa Maria della Vittoria.Vittoria, he thought, grinning. Perfect.Staggering to his feet, Langdon felt a rush of dizziness. He glanced up theladder, wondering if he should replace the book. The hell with it, he thought.Father Jaqui can do it. He closed the book and left it neatly at the bottom ofthe shelf.As he made his way toward the glowing button on the vault’s electronic exit, hewas breathing in shallow gasps. Nonetheless, he felt rejuvenated by his goodfortune.His good fortune, however, ran out before he reached the exit.Without warning, the vault let out a pained sigh. The lights dimmed, and theexit button went dead. Then, like an enormous expiring beast, the archivalcomplex went totally black. Someone had just killed power."},{"pageContent":"85The Holy Vatican Grottoes are located beneath the main floor of St. Peter’sBasilica. They are the burial place of deceased Popes.Vittoria reached the bottom of the spiral staircase and entered the grotto. Thedarkened tunnel reminded her of CERN’s Large Hadron Collider-black and cold. Litnow only by the flashlights of the Swiss Guards, the tunnel carried a distinctlyincorporeal feel. On both sides, hollow niches lined the walls. Recessed in thealcoves, as far as the lights let them see, the hulking shadows of sarcophagiloomed.An iciness raked her flesh. It’s the cold, she told herself, knowing that wasonly partially true. She had the sense they were being watched, not by anyone inthe flesh, but by specters in the dark. On top of each tomb, in full papalvestments, lay life-sized semblances of each Pope, shown in death, arms foldedacross their chests. The prostrate bodies seemed to emerge from within thetombs, pressing upward against the marble lids as if trying to escape theirmortal restraints. The flashlight procession moved on, and the papal silhouettesrose and fell against the walls, stretching and vanishing in a macabre shadowboxdance.A silence had fallen across the group, and Vittoria couldn’t tell whether it wasone of respect or apprehension. She sensed both. The camerlegno moved with hiseyes closed, as if he knew every step by heart. Vittoria suspected he had madethis eerie promenade many times since the Pope’s death… perhaps to pray at histomb for guidance.I worked under the cardinal’s tutelage for many years, the camerlegno had said.He was like a father to me. Vittoria recalled the camerlegno speaking thosewords in reference to the cardinal who had “saved” him from the army. Now,however, Vittoria understood the rest of the story. That very cardinal who hadtaken the camerlegno under his wing had apparently later risen to the papacy andbrought with him his young protйgй to serve as chamberlain.That explains a lot, Vittoria thought. She had always possessed a well-tunedperception for others’ inner emotions, and something about the camerlegno hadbeen nagging her all day. Since meeting him, she had sensed an anguish moresoulful and private than the overwhelming crisis he now faced. Behind his piouscalm, she saw a man tormented by personal demons. Now she knew her instincts hadbeen correct. Not only was he facing the most devastating threat in Vaticanhistory, but he was doing it without his mentor and friend… flying solo.The guards slowed now, as if unsure where exactly in the darkness the mostrecent Pope was buried. The camerlegno continued assuredly and stopped before amarble tomb that seemed to glisten brighter than the others. Lying atop was acarved figure of the late Pope. When Vittoria recognized his face fromtelevision, a shot of fear gripped her. What are we doing?“I realize we do not have much time,” the camerlegno said. “I still ask we takea moment of prayer.”The Swiss Guard all bowed their heads where they were standing. Vittoriafollowed suit, her heart pounding in the silence. The camerlegno knelt beforethe tomb and prayed in Italian. As Vittoria listened to his words, an unexpectedgrief surfaced as tears… tears for her own mentor… her own holy father. Thecamerlegno’s words seemed as appropriate for her father as they did for thePope.“Supreme father, counselor, friend.” The camerlegno’s voice echoed dully aroundthe ring. “You told me when I was young that the voice in my heart was that ofGod. You told me I must follow it no matter what painful places it leads. I hearthat voice now, asking of me impossible tasks. Give me strength. Bestow on meforgiveness. What I do… I do in the name of everything you believe. Amen.”“Amen,” the guards whispered.Amen, Father. Vittoria wiped her eyes.The camerlegno stood slowly and stepped away from the tomb. “Push the coveringaside.”The Swiss Guards hesitated. “Signore,” one said, “by law we are at yourcommand.” He paused. “We will do as you say…”The camerlegno seemed to read the young man’s mind. “Someday I will ask yourforgiveness for placing you in this position. Today I ask for your obedience.Vatican laws are established to protect this church. It is in that very spiritthat I command you to break them now.”There was a moment of silence and then the lead guard gave the order. The threemen set down their flashlights on the floor, and their shadows leapt overhead.Lit now from beneath, the men advanced toward the tomb. Bracing their handsagainst the marble covering near the head of the tomb, they planted their feetand prepared to push. On signal, they all thrust, straining against the enormousslab. When the lid did not move at all, Vittoria found herself almost hoping itwas too heavy. She was suddenly fearful of what they would find inside.The men pushed harder, and still the stone did not move.“Ancora,” the camerlegno said, rolling up the sleeves of his cassock andpreparing to push along with them. “Ora!” Everyone heaved.Vittoria was about to offer her own help, but just then, the lid began to slide.The men dug in again, and with an almost primal growl of stone on stone, the lidrotated off the top of the tomb and came to rest at an angle-the Pope’s carvedhead now pushed back into the niche and his feet extended out into the hallway.Everyone stepped back.Tentatively, a guard bent and retrieved his flashlight. Then he aimed it intothe tomb. The beam seemed to tremble a moment, and then the guard held itsteady. The other guards gathered one by one. Even in the darkness Vittoriasensed them recoil. In succession, they crossed themselves.The camerlegno shuddered when he looked into the tomb, his shoulders droppinglike weights. He stood a long moment before turning away.Vittoria had feared the corpse’s mouth might be clenched tight with rigor mortisand that she would have to suggest breaking the jaw to see the tongue. She nowsaw it would be unnecessary. The cheeks had collapsed, and the Pope’s mouthgaped wide.His tongue was black as death."},{"pageContent":"86No light. No sound.The Secret Archives were black.Fear, Langdon now realized, was an intense motivator. Short of breath, hefumbled through the blackness toward the revolving door. He found the button onthe wall and rammed his palm against it. Nothing happened. He tried again. Thedoor was dead.Spinning blind, he called out, but his voice emerged strangled. The peril of hispredicament suddenly closed in around him. His lungs strained for oxygen as theadrenaline doubled his heart rate. He felt like someone had just punched him inthe gut.When he threw his weight into the door, for an instant he thought he felt thedoor start to turn. He pushed again, seeing stars. Now he realized it was theentire room turning, not the door. Staggering away, Langdon tripped over thebase of a rolling ladder and fell hard. He tore his knee against the edge of abook stack. Swearing, he got up and groped for the ladder.He found it. He had hoped it would be heavy wood or iron, but it was aluminum.He grabbed the ladder and held it like a battering ram. Then he ran through thedark at the glass wall. It was closer than he thought. The ladder hit head-on,bouncing off. From the feeble sound of the collision, Langdon knew he was goingto need a hell of a lot more than an aluminum ladder to break this glass.When he flashed on the semiautomatic, his hopes surged and then instantly fell.The weapon was gone. Olivetti had relieved him of it in the Pope’s office,saying he did not want loaded weapons around with the camerlegno present. Itmade sense at the time.Langdon called out again, making less sound than the last time.Next he remembered the walkie-talkie the guard had left on the table outside thevault. Why the hell didn’t I bring it in! As the purple stars began to dancebefore his eyes, Langdon forced himself to think. You’ve been trapped before, hetold himself. You survived worse. You were just a kid and you figured it out.The crushing darkness came flooding in. Think!Langdon lowered himself onto the floor. He rolled over on his back and laid hishands at his sides. The first step was to gain control.Relax. Conserve.No longer fighting gravity to pump blood, Langdon’s heart began to slow. It wasa trick swimmers used to re-oxygenate their blood between tightly scheduledraces.There is plenty of air in here, he told himself. Plenty. Now think. He waited,half-expecting the lights to come back on at any moment. They did not. As he laythere, able to breathe better now, an eerie resignation came across him. He feltpeaceful. He fought it.You will move, damn it! But where…On Langdon’s wrist, Mickey Mouse glowed happily as if enjoying the dark: 9:33P.M. Half an hour until Fire. Langdon thought it felt a whole hell of a lotlater. His mind, instead of coming up with a plan for escape, was suddenlydemanding an explanation. Who turned off the power? Was Rocher expanding hissearch? Wouldn’t Olivetti have warned Rocher that I’m in here! Langdon knew atthis point it made no difference.Opening his mouth wide and tipping back his head, Langdon pulled the deepestbreaths he could manage. Each breath burned a little less than the last. Hishead cleared. He reeled his thoughts in and forced the gears into motion.Glass walls, he told himself. But damn thick glass.He wondered if any of the books in here were stored in heavy, steel, fireprooffile cabinets. Langdon had seen them from time to time in other archives but hadseen none here. Besides, finding one in the dark could prove time-consuming. Notthat he could lift one anyway, particularly in his present state.How about the examination table? Langdon knew this vault, like the other, had anexamination table in the center of the stacks. So what! He knew he couldn’t liftit. Not to mention, even if he could drag it, he wouldn’t get it far. The stackswere closely packed, the aisles between them far too narrow.The aisles are too narrow…Suddenly, Langdon knew.With a burst of confidence, he jumped to his feet far too fast. Swaying in thefog of a head rush, he reached out in the dark for support. His hand found astack. Waiting a moment, he forced himself to conserve. He would need all of hisstrength to do this.Positioning himself against the book stack like a football player against atraining sled, he planted his feet and pushed. If I can somehow tip the shelf.But it barely moved. He realigned and pushed again. His feet slipped backward onthe floor. The stack creaked but did not move.He needed leverage.Finding the glass wall again, he placed one hand on it to guide him as he racedin the dark toward the far end of the vault. The back wall loomed suddenly, andhe collided with it, crushing his shoulder. Cursing, Langdon circled the shelfand grabbed the stack at about eye level. Then, propping one leg on the glassbehind him and another on the lower shelves, he started to climb. Books fellaround him, fluttering into the darkness. He didn’t care. Instinct for survivalhad long since overridden archival decorum. He sensed his equilibrium washampered by the total darkness and closed his eyes, coaxing his brain to ignorevisual input. He moved faster now. The air felt leaner the higher he went. Hescrambled toward the upper shelves, stepping on books, trying to gain purchase,heaving himself upward. Then, like a rock climber conquering a rock face,Langdon grasped the top shelf. Stretching his legs out behind him, he walked hisfeet up the glass wall until he was almost horizontal.Now or never, Robert, a voice urged. Just like the leg press in the Harvard gym.With dizzying exertion, he planted his feet against the wall behind him, bracedhis arms and chest against the stack, and pushed. Nothing happened.Fighting for air, he repositioned and tried again, extending his legs. Ever soslightly, the stack moved. He pushed again, and the stack rocked forward an inchor so and then back. Langdon took advantage of the motion, inhaling what feltlike an oxygenless breath and heaving again. The shelf rocked farther.Like a swing set, he told himself. Keep the rhythm. A little more.Langdon rocked the shelf, extending his legs farther with each push. Hisquadriceps burned now, and he blocked the pain. The pendulum was in motion.Three more pushes, he urged himself.It only took two.There was an instant of weightless uncertainty. Then, with a thundering of bookssliding off the shelves, Langdon and the shelf were falling forward.Halfway to the ground, the shelf hit the stack next to it. Langdon hung on,throwing his weight forward, urging the second shelf to topple. There was amoment of motionless panic, and then, creaking under the weight, the secondstack began to tip. Langdon was falling again.Like enormous dominoes, the stacks began to topple, one after another. Metal onmetal, books tumbling everywhere. Langdon held on as his inclined stack bounceddownward like a ratchet on a jack. He wondered how many stacks there were inall. How much would they weigh? The glass at the far end was thick…Langdon’s stack had fallen almost to the horizontal when he heard what he waswaiting for-a different kind of collision. Far off. At the end of the vault. Thesharp smack of metal on glass. The vault around him shook, and Langdon knew thefinal stack, weighted down by the others, had hit the glass hard. The sound thatfollowed was the most unwelcome sound Langdon had ever heard.Silence.There was no crashing of glass, only the resounding thud as the wall acceptedthe weight of the stacks now propped against it. He lay wide-eyed on the pile ofbooks. Somewhere in the distance there was a creaking. Langdon would have heldhis breath to listen, but he had none left to hold.One second. Two…Then, as he teetered on the brink of unconsciousness, Langdon heard a distantyielding… a ripple spidering outward through the glass. Suddenly, like a cannon,the glass exploded. The stack beneath Langdon collapsed to the floor.Like welcome rain on a desert, shards of glass tinkled downward in the dark.With a great sucking hiss, the air gushed in.Thirty seconds later, in the Vatican Grottoes, Vittoria was standing before acorpse when the electronic squawk of a walkie-talkie broke the silence. Thevoice blaring out sounded short of breath. “This is Robert Langdon! Can anyonehear me?”Vittoria looked up. Robert! She could not believe how much she suddenly wishedhe were there.The guards exchanged puzzled looks. One took a radio off his belt. “Mr. Langdon?You are on channel three. The commander is waiting to hear from you on channelone.”“I know he’s on channel one, damn it! I don’t want to speak to him. I want thecamerlegno. Now! Somebody find him for me.”In the obscurity of the Secret Archives, Langdon stood amidst shattered glassand tried to catch his breath. He felt a warm liquid on his left hand and knewhe was bleeding. The camerlegno’s voice spoke at once, startling Langdon.“This is Camerlegno Ventresca. What’s going on?”Langdon pressed the button, his heart still pounding. “I think somebody justtried to kill me!”There was a silence on the line.Langdon tried to calm himself. “I also know where the next killing is going tobe.”The voice that came back was not the camerlegno’s. It was Commander Olivetti’s:“Mr. Langdon. Do not speak another word.”"},{"pageContent":"87Langdon’s watch, now smeared with blood, read 9:41 P.M. as he ran across theCourtyard of the Belvedere and approached the fountain outside the Swiss Guardsecurity center. His hand had stopped bleeding and now felt worse than itlooked. As he arrived, it seemed everyone convened at once-Olivetti, Rocher, thecamerlegno, Vittoria, and a handful of guards.Vittoria hurried toward him immediately. “Robert, you’re hurt.”Before Langdon could answer, Olivetti was before him. “Mr. Langdon, I’m relievedyou’re okay. I’m sorry about the crossed signals in the archives.”“Crossed signals?” Langdon demanded. “You knew damn well-”“It was my fault,” Rocher said, stepping forward, sounding contrite. “I had noidea you were in the archives. Portions of our white zones are cross-wired withthat building. We were extending our search. I’m the one who killed power. If Ihad known…”“Robert,” Vittoria said, taking his wounded hand in hers and looking it over,“the Pope was poisoned. The Illuminati killed him.”Langdon heard the words, but they barely registered. He was saturated. All hecould feel was the warmth of Vittoria’s hands.The camerlegno pulled a silk handkerchief from his cassock and handed it toLangdon so he could clean himself. The man said nothing. His green eyes seemedfilled with a new fire.“Robert,” Vittoria pressed, “you said you found where the next cardinal is goingto be killed?”Langdon felt flighty. “I do, it’s at the-”“No,” Olivetti interrupted. “Mr. Langdon, when I asked you not to speak anotherword on the walkie-talkie, it was for a reason.” He turned to the handful ofassembled Swiss Guards. “Excuse us, gentlemen.”The soldiers disappeared into the security center. No indignity. Onlycompliance.Olivetti turned back to the remaining group. “As much as it pains me to saythis, the murder of our Pope is an act that could only have been accomplishedwith help from within these walls. For the good of all, we can trust no one.Including our guards.” He seemed to be suffering as he spoke the words.Rocher looked anxious. “Inside collusion implies-”“Yes,” Olivetti said. “The integrity of your search is compromised. And yet itis a gamble we must take. Keep looking.”Rocher looked like he was about to say something, thought better of it, andleft.The camerlegno inhaled deeply. He had not said a word yet, and Langdon sensed anew rigor in the man, as if a turning point had been reached.“Commander?” The camerlegno’s tone was impermeable. “I am going to breakconclave.”Olivetti pursed his lips, looking dour. “I advise against it. We still have twohours and twenty minutes.”“A heartbeat.”Olivetti’s tone was now challenging “What do you intend to do? Evacuate thecardinals single-handedly?”“I intend to save this church with whatever power God has given me. How Iproceed is no longer your concern.”Olivetti straightened. “Whatever you intend to do…” He paused. “I do not havethe authority to restrain you. Particularly in light of my apparent failure ashead of security. I ask only that you wait. Wait twenty minutes… until after teno’clock. If Mr. Langdon’s information is correct, I may still have a chance tocatch this assassin. There is still a chance to preserve protocol and decorum.”“Decorum?” The camerlegno let out a choked laugh. “We have long since passedpropriety, commander. In case you hadn’t noticed, this is war.”A guard emerged from the security center and called out to the camerlegno,“Signore, I just got word we have detained the BBC reporter, Mr. Glick.”The camerlegno nodded. “Have both he and his camerawoman meet me outside theSistine Chapel.”Olivetti’s eyes widened. “What are you doing?”“Twenty minutes, commander. That’s all I’m giving you.” Then he was gone.When Olivetti’s Alpha Romeo tore out of Vatican City, this time there was noline of unmarked cars following him. In the back seat, Vittoria bandagedLangdon’s hand with a first-aid kit she’d found in the glove box.Olivetti stared straight ahead. “Okay, Mr. Langdon. Where are we going?”"},{"pageContent":"88Even with its siren now affixed and blaring, Olivetti’s Alpha Romeo seemed to gounnoticed as it rocketed across the bridge into the heart of old Rome. All thetraffic was moving in the other direction, toward the Vatican, as if the HolySee had suddenly become the hottest entertainment in Rome.Langdon sat in the backseat, the questions whipping through his mind. Hewondered about the killer, if they would catch him this time, if he would tellthem what they needed to know, if it was already too late. How long before thecamerlegno told the crowd in St. Peter’s Square they were in danger? Theincident in the vault still nagged. A mistake.Olivetti never touched the brakes as he snaked the howling Alpha Romeo towardthe Church of Santa Maria della Vittoria. Langdon knew on any other day hisknuckles would have been white. At the moment, however, he felt anesthetized.Only the throbbing in his hand reminded him where he was.Overhead, the siren wailed. Nothing like telling him we’re coming, Langdonthought. And yet they were making incredible time. He guessed Olivetti wouldkill the siren as they drew nearer.Now with a moment to sit and reflect, Langdon felt a tinge of amazement as thenews of the Pope’s murder finally registered in his mind. The thought wasinconceivable, and yet somehow it seemed a perfectly logical event. Infiltrationhad always been the Illuminati powerbase-rearrangements of power from within.And it was not as if Popes had never been murdered. Countless rumors oftreachery abounded, although with no autopsy, none was ever confirmed. Untilrecently. Academics not long ago had gotten permission to X-ray the tomb of PopeCelestine V, who had allegedly died at the hands of his overeager successor,Boniface VIII. The researchers had hoped the X-ray might reveal some small hintof foul play-a broken bone perhaps. Incredibly, the X-ray had revealed aten-inch nail driven into the Pope’s skull.Langdon now recalled a series of news clippings fellow Illuminati buffs had senthim years ago. At first he had thought the clippings were a prank, so he’d goneto the Harvard microfiche collection to confirm the articles were authentic.Incredibly, they were. He now kept them on his bulletin board as examples of howeven respectable news organizations sometimes got carried away with Illuminatiparanoia. Suddenly, the media’s suspicions seemed a lot less paranoid. Langdoncould see the articles clearly in his mind…THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATIONJune 14, 1998Pope John Paul I, who died in 1978, fell victim to a plot by the P2 MasonicLodge… The secret society P2 decided to murder John Paul I when it saw he wasdetermined to dismiss the American Archbishop Paul Marcinkus as President of theVatican Bank.

Thequestions don’t stop there. No medical investigations were made. Cardinal Villotforbade an autopsy on the grounds that no Pope was ever given a postmortem. AndJohn Paul’s medicines mysteriously vanished from his bedside, as did hisglasses, slippers and his last will and testament.LONDON DAILY MAILAugust 27, 1998… a plot including a powerful, ruthless and illegal Masonic lodge with tentaclesstretching into the Vatican.The cellular in Vittoria’s pocket rang, thankfully erasing the memories fromLangdon’s mind.Vittoria answered, looking confused as to who might be calling her. Even from afew feet away, Langdon recognized the laserlike voice on the phone.“Vittoria? This is Maximilian Kohler. Have you found the antimatter yet?”“Max? You’re okay?”“I saw the news. There was no mention of CERN or the antimatter. This is good.What is happening?”“We haven’t located the canister yet. The situation is complex. Robert Langdonhas been quite an asset. We have a lead on catching the man assassinatingcardinals. Right now we are headed-”“Ms. Vetra,” Olivetti interrupted. “You’ve said enough.”She covered the receiver, clearly annoyed. “Commander, this is the president ofCERN. Certainly he has a right to-”“He has a right,” Olivetti snapped, “to be here handling this situation. You’reon an open cellular line. You’ve said enough.”Vittoria took a deep breath. “Max?”“I may have some information for you,” Max said. “About your father… I may knowwho he told about the antimatter.”Vittoria’s expression clouded. “Max, my father said he told no one.”“I’m afraid, Vittoria, your father did tell someone. I need to check somesecurity records. I will be in touch soon.” The line went dead.Vittoria looked waxen as she returned the phone to her pocket.“You okay?” Langdon asked.Vittoria nodded, her trembling fingers revealing the lie.“The church is on Piazza Barberini,” Olivetti said, killing the siren andchecking his watch. “We have nine minutes.”When Langdon had first realized the location of the third marker, the positionof the church had rung some distant bell for him. Piazza Barberini. Somethingabout the name was familiar… something he could not place. Now Langdon realizedwhat it was. The piazza was the sight of a controversial subway stop. Twentyyears ago, construction of the subway terminal had created a stir among arthistorians who feared digging beneath Piazza Barberini might topple the multitonobelisk that stood in the center. City planners had removed the obelisk andreplaced it with a small fountain called the Triton.In Bernini’s day, Langdon now realized, Piazza Barberini had contained anobelisk! Whatever doubts Langdon had felt that this was the location of thethird marker now totally evaporated.A block from the piazza, Olivetti turned into an alley, gunned the car halfwaydown, and skidded to a stop. He pulled off his suit jacket, rolled up hissleeves, and loaded his weapon.“We can’t risk your being recognized,” he said. “You two were on television. Iwant you across the piazza, out of sight, watching the front entrance. I’m goingin the back.” He produced a familiar pistol and handed it to Langdon. “Just incase.”Langdon frowned. It was the second time today he had been handed the gun. Heslid it into his breast pocket. As he did, he realized he was still carrying thefolio from Diagramma. He couldn’t believe he had forgotten to leave it behind.He pictured the Vatican Curator collapsing in spasms of outrage at the thoughtof this priceless artifact being packed around Rome like some tourist map. ThenLangdon thought of the mess of shattered glass and strewn documents that he’dleft behind in the archives. The curator had other problems. If the archiveseven survive the night…Olivetti got out of the car and motioned back up the alley. “The piazza is thatway. Keep your eyes open and don’t let yourselves be seen.” He tapped the phoneon his belt. “Ms. Vetra, let’s retest our auto dial.”Vittoria removed her phone and hit the auto dial number she and Olivetti hadprogrammed at the Pantheon. Olivetti’s phone vibrated in silent-ring mode on hisbelt.The commander nodded. “Good. If you see anything, I want to know.” He cocked hisweapon. “I’ll be inside waiting. This heathen is mine.”At that moment, very nearby, another cellular phone was ringing.The Hassassin answered. “Speak.”“It is I,” the voice said. “Janus.”The Hassassin smiled. “Hello, master.”“Your position may be known. Someone is coming to stop you.”“They are too late. I have already made the arrangements here.”“Good. Make sure you escape alive. There is work yet to be done.”“Those who stand in my way will die.”“Those who stand in your way are knowledgeable.”“You speak of an American scholar?”“You are aware of him?”The Hassassin chuckled. “Cool-tempered but naпve. He spoke to me on the phoneearlier. He is with a female who seems quite the opposite.” The killer felt astirring of arousal as he recalled the fiery temperament of Leonardo Vetra’sdaughter.There was a momentary silence on the line, the first hesitation the Hassassinhad ever sensed from his Illuminati master. Finally, Janus spoke. “Eliminatethem if need be.”The killer smiled. “Consider it done.” He felt a warm anticipation spreadingthrough his body. Although the woman I may keep as a prize."},{"pageContent":"89War had broken out in St. Peter’s Square.The piazza had exploded into a frenzy of aggression. Media trucks skidded intoplace like assault vehicles claiming beachheads. Reporters unfurled high-techelectronics like soldiers arming for battle. All around the perimeter of thesquare, networks jockeyed for position as they raced to erect the newest weaponin media wars-flat-screen displays.Flat-screen displays were enormous video screens that could be assembled on topof trucks or portable scaffolding. The screens served as a kind of billboardadvertisement for the network, broadcasting that network’s coverage andcorporate logo like a drive-in movie. If a screen were well-situated-in front ofthe action, for example-a competing network could not shoot the story withoutincluding an advertisement for their competitor.The square was quickly becoming not only a multimedia extravaganza, but afrenzied public vigil. Onlookers poured in from all directions. Open space inthe usually limitless square was fast becoming a valuable commodity. Peopleclustered around the towering flat-screen displays, listening to live reports instunned excitement.Only a hundred yards away, inside the thick walls of St. Peter’s Basilica, theworld was serene. Lieutenant Chartrand and three other guards moved through thedarkness. Wearing their infrared goggles, they fanned out across the nave,swinging their detectors before them. The search of Vatican City’s public accessareas so far had yielded nothing.“Better remove your goggles up here,” the senior guard said.Chartrand was already doing it. They were nearing the Niche of the Palliums-thesunken area in the center of the basilica. It was lit by ninety-nine oil lamps,and the amplified infrared would have seared their eyes.Chartrand enjoyed being out of the heavy goggles, and he stretched his neck asthey descended into the sunken niche to scan the area. The room was beautiful…golden and glowing. He had not been down here yet.It seemed every day since Chartrand had arrived in Vatican City he had learnedsome new Vatican mystery. These oil lamps were one of them. There were exactlyninety-nine lamps burning at all times. It was tradition. The clergy vigilantlyrefilled the lamps with sacred oils such that no lamp ever burned out. It wassaid they would burn until the end of time.Or at least until midnight, Chartrand thought, feeling his mouth go dry again.Chartrand swung his detector over the oil lamps. Nothing hidden in here. He wasnot surprised; the canister, according to the video feed, was hidden in a darkarea.As he moved across the niche, he came to a bulkhead grate covering a hole in thefloor. The hole led to a steep and narrow stairway that went straight down. Hehad heard stories about what lay down there. Thankfully, they would not have todescend. Rocher’s orders were clear. Search only the public access areas; ignorethe white zones.“What’s that smell?” he asked, turning away from the grate. The niche smelledintoxicatingly sweet.“Fumes from the lamps,” one of them replied.Chartrand was surprised. “Smells more like cologne than kerosene.”“It’s not kerosene. These lamps are close to the papal altar, so they take aspecial, ambiental mixture-ethanol, sugar, butane, and perfume.”“Butane?” Chartrand eyed the lamps uneasily.The guard nodded. “Don’t spill any. Smells like heaven, but burns like hell.”The guards had completed searching the Niche of the Palliums and were movingacross the basilica again when their walkie-talkies went off.It was an update. The guards listened in shock.Apparently there were troubling new developments, which could not be sharedon-air, but the camerlegno had decided to break tradition and enter conclave toaddress the cardinals. Never before in history had this been done. Then again,Chartrand realized, never before in history had the Vatican been sitting on whatamounted to some sort of neoteric nuclear warhead.Chartrand felt comforted to know the camerlegno was taking control. Thecamerlegno was the person inside Vatican City for whom Chartrand held the mostrespect. Some of the guards thought of the camerlegno as a beato-a religiouszealot whose love of God bordered on obsession-but even they agreed… when itcame to fighting the enemies of God, the camerlegno was the one man who wouldstand up and play hardball.The Swiss Guards had seen a lot of the camerlegno this week in preparation forconclave, and everyone had commented that the man seemed a bit rough around theedges, his verdant eyes a bit more intense than usual. Not surprisingly, theyhad all commented; not only was the camerlegno responsible for planning thesacred conclave, but he had to do it immediately on the heels of the loss of hismentor, the Pope.Chartrand had only been at the Vatican a few months when he heard the story ofthe bomb that blew up the camerlegno’s mother before the kid’s very eyes. A bombin church… and now it’s happening all over again. Sadly, the authorities nevercaught the bastards who planted the bomb… probably some anti-Christian hategroup they said, and the case faded away. No wonder the camerlegno despisedapathy.A couple months back, on a peaceful afternoon inside Vatican City, Chartrand hadbumped into the camerlegno coming across the grounds. The camerlegno hadapparently recognized Chartrand as a new guard and invited him to accompany himon a stroll. They had talked about nothing in particular, and the camerlegnomade Chartrand feel immediately at home.“Father,” Chartrand said, “may I ask you a strange question?”The camerlegno smiled. “Only if I may give you a strange answer.”Chartrand laughed. “I have asked every priest I know, and I still don’tunderstand.”“What troubles you?” The camerlegno led the way in short, quick strides, hisfrock kicking out in front of him as he walked. His black, crepe-sole shoessseemed befitting, Chartrand thought, like reflections of the man’s essence…modern but humble, and showing signs of wear.Chartrand took a deep breath. “I don’t understand this omnipotent-benevolentthing.”The camerlegno smiled. “You’ve been reading Scripture.”“I try.”“You are confused because the Bible describes God as an omnipotent andbenevolent deity.”“Exactly.”“Omnipotent-benevolent simply means that God is all-powerful and well-meaning.”“I understand the concept. It’s just… there seems to be a contradiction.”“Yes. The contradiction is pain. Man’s starvation, war, sickness…”“Exactly!” Chartrand knew the camerlegno would understand. “Terrible thingshappen in this world. Human tragedy seems like proof that God could not possiblybe both all-powerful and well-meaning. If He loves us and has the power tochange our situation, He would prevent our pain, wouldn’t He?”The camerlegno frowned. “Would He?”Chartrand felt uneasy. Had he overstepped his bounds? Was this one of thosereligious questions you just didn’t ask? “Well… if God loves us, and He canprotect us, He would have to. It seems He is either omnipotent and uncaring, orbenevolent and powerless to help.”“Do you have children, Lieutenant?”Chartrand flushed. “No, signore.”“Imagine you had an eight-year-old son… would you love him?”“Of course.”“Would you do everything in your power to prevent pain in his life?”“Of course.”“Would you let him skateboard?”Chartrand did a double take. The camerlegno always seemed oddly “in touch” for aclergyman. “Yeah, I guess,” Chartrand said. “Sure, I’d let him skateboard, butI’d tell him to be careful.”“So as this child’s father, you would give him some basic, good advice and thenlet him go off and make his own mistakes?”“I wouldn’t run behind him and mollycoddle him if that’s what you mean.”“But what if he fell and skinned his knee?”“He would learn to be more careful.”The camerlegno smiled. “So although you have the power to interfere and preventyour child’s pain, you would choose to show your love by letting him learn hisown lessons?”“Of course. Pain is part of growing up. It’s how we learn.”The camerlegno nodded. “Exactly.”"},{"pageContent":"90Langdon and Vittoria observed Piazza Barberini from the shadows of a smallalleyway on the western corner. The church was opposite them, a hazy cupolaemerging from a faint cluster of buildings across the square. The night hadbrought with it a welcome cool, and Langdon was surprised to find the squaredeserted. Above them, through open windows, blaring televisions reminded Langdonwhere everyone had disappeared to.“… no comment yet from the Vatican… Illuminati murders of two cardinals… satanicpresence in Rome… speculation about further infiltration…”The news had spread like Nero’s fire. Rome sat riveted, as did the rest of theworld. Langdon wondered if they would really be able to stop this runaway train.As he scanned the piazza and waited, Langdon realized that despite theencroachment of modern buildings, the piazza still looked remarkably elliptical.High above, like some sort of modern shrine to a bygone hero, an enormous neonsign blinked on the roof of a luxurious hotel. Vittoria had already pointed itout to Langdon. The sign seemed eerily befitting.HOTEL BERNINI“Five of ten,” Vittoria said, cat eyes darting around the square. No sooner hadshe spoken the words than she grabbed Langdon’s arm and pulled him back into theshadows. She motioned into the center of the square.Langdon followed her gaze. When he saw it, he stiffened.Crossing in front of them, beneath a street lamp, two dark figures appeared.Both were cloaked, their heads covered with dark mantles, the traditional blackcovering of Catholic widows. Langdon would have guessed they were women, but hecouldn’t be sure in the dark. One looked elderly and moved as if in pain,hunched over. The other, larger and stronger, was helping.“Give me the gun,” Vittoria said.“You can’t just-”Fluid as a cat, Vittoria was in and out of his pocket once again. The gunglinted in her hand. Then, in absolute silence, as if her feet never touched thecobblestone, she was circling left in the shadows, arching across the square toapproach the couple from the rear. Langdon stood transfixed as Vittoriadisappeared. Then, swearing to himself, he hurried after her.The couple was moving slowly, and it was only a matter of half a minute beforeLangdon and Vittoria were positioned behind them, closing in from the rear.Vittoria concealed the gun beneath casually crossed arms in front of her, out ofsight but accessible in a flash. She seemed to float faster and faster as thegap lessened, and Langdon battled to keep up. When his shoes scuffed a stone andsent it skittering, Vittoria shot him a sideways glare. But the couple did notseem to hear. They were talking.At thirty feet, Langdon could start to hear voices. No words. Just faintmurmurings. Beside him, Vittoria moved faster with every step. Her arms loosenedbefore her, the gun starting to peek out. Twenty feet. The voices wereclearer-one much louder than the other. Angry. Ranting. Langdon sensed it wasthe voice of an old woman. Gruff. Androgynous. He strained to hear what she wassaying, but another voice cut the night.“Mi scusi!” Vittoria’s friendly tone lit the square like a torch.Langdon tensed as the cloaked couple stopped short and began to turn. Vittoriakept striding toward them, even faster now, on a collision course. They wouldhave no time to react. Langdon realized his own feet had stopped moving. Frombehind, he saw Vittoria’s arms loosening, her hand coming free, the gun swingingforward. Then, over her shoulder, he saw a face, lit now in the street lamp. Thepanic surged to his legs, and he lunged forward. “Vittoria, no!”Vittoria, however, seemed to exist a split second ahead of him. In a motion asswift as it was casual, Vittoria’s arms were raised again, the gun disappearingas she clutched herself like a woman on a chilly night. Langdon stumbled to herside, almost colliding with the cloaked couple before them.“Buona sera,” Vittoria blurted, her voice startled with retreat.Langdon exhaled in relief. Two elderly women stood before them scowling out frombeneath their mantles. One was so old she could barely stand. The other washelping her. Both clutched rosaries. They seemed confused by the suddeninterruption.Vittoria smiled, although she looked shaken. “Dov‘и la chiesa Santa Maria dellaVittoria? Where is the Church of-”The two women motioned in unison to a bulky silhouette of a building on aninclined street from the direction they had come. “И lа.”“Grazie,” Langdon said, putting his hands on Vittoria’s shoulders and gentlypulling her back. He couldn’t believe they’d almost attacked a pair of oldladies.“Non si puу entrare,” one woman warned. “И chiusa temprano.”“Closed early?” Vittoria looked surprised. “Perchи?”Both women explained at once. They sounded irate. Langdon understood only partsof the grumbling Italian. Apparently, the women had been inside the churchfifteen minutes ago praying for the Vatican in its time of need, when some manhad appeared and told them the church was closing early.“Hanno conosciuto l’uomo?” Vittoria demanded, sounding tense. “Did you know theman?”The women shook their heads. The man was a straniero crudo, they explained, andhe had forcibly made everyone inside leave, even the young priest and janitor,who said they were calling the police. But the intruder had only laughed,telling them to be sure the police brought cameras.Cameras? Langdon wondered.The women clucked angrily and called the man a bar-аrabo. Then, grumbling, theycontinued on their way.“Bar-аrabo?”Langdon asked Vittoria. “A barbarian?”Vittoria looked suddenly taut. “Not quite. Bar-аrabo is derogatory wordplay. Itmeans Аrabo… Arab.”Langdon felt a shiver and turned toward the outline of the church. As he did,his eyes glimpsed something in the church’s stained-glass windows. The imageshot dread through his body.Unaware, Vittoria removed her cell phone and pressed the auto dial. “I’m warningOlivetti.”Speechless, Langdon reached out and touched her arm. With a tremulous hand, hepointed to the church.Vittoria let out a gasp.Inside the building, glowing like evil eyes through the stained-glass windows…shone the growing flash of flames."},{"pageContent":"91Langdon and Vittoria dashed to the main entrance of the church of Santa Mariadella Vittoria and found the wooden door locked. Vittoria fired three shots fromOlivetti’s semi-automatic into the ancient bolt, and it shattered.The church had no anteroom, so the entirety of the sanctuary spread out in onegasping sweep as Langdon and Vittoria threw open the main door. The scene beforethem was so unexpected, so bizarre, that Langdon had to close his eyes andreopen them before his mind could take it all in.The church was lavish baroque… gilded walls and altars. Dead center of thesanctuary, beneath the main cupola, wooden pews had been stacked high and werenow ablaze in some sort of epic funeral pyre. A bonfire shooting high into thedome. As Langdon’s eyes followed the inferno upward, the true horror of thescene descended like a bird of prey.High overhead, from the left and right sides of the ceiling, hung two incensorcables-lines used for swinging frankincense vessels above the congregation.These lines, however, carried no incensors now. Nor were they swinging. They hadbeen used for something else…Suspended from the cables was a human being. A naked man. Each wrist had beenconnected to an opposing cable, and he had been hoisted almost to the point ofbeing torn apart. His arms were outstretched in a spread-eagle as if he werenailed to some sort of invisible crucifix hovering within the house of God.Langdon felt paralyzed as he stared upward. A moment later, he witnessed thefinal abomination. The old man was alive, and he raised his head. A pair ofterrified eyes gazed down in a silent plea for help. On the man’s chest was ascorched emblem. He had been branded. Langdon could not see it clearly, but hehad little doubt what the marking said. As the flames climbed higher, lapping atthe man’s feet, the victim let out a cry of pain, his body trembling.As if ignited by some unseen force, Langdon felt his body suddenly in motion,dashing down the main aisle toward the conflagration. His lungs filled withsmoke as he closed in. Ten feet from the inferno, at a full sprint, Langdon hita wall of heat. The skin on his face singed, and he fell back, shielding hiseyes and landing hard on the marble floor. Staggering upright, he pressedforward again, hands raised in protection.Instantly he knew. The fire was far too hot.Moving back again, he scanned the chapel walls. A heavy tapestry, he thought. IfI can somehow smother the… But he knew a tapestry was not to be found. This is abaroque chapel, Robert, not some damn German castle! Think! He forced his eyesback to the suspended man.High above, smoke and flames swirled in the cupola. The incensor cablesstretched outward from the man’s wrists, rising to the ceiling where they passedthrough pulleys, and descended again to metal cleats on either side of thechurch. Langdon looked over at one of the cleats. It was high on the wall, buthe knew if he could get to it and loosen one of the lines, the tension wouldslacken and the man would swing wide of the fire.A sudden surge of flames crackled higher, and Langdon heard a piercing screamfrom above. The skin on the man’s feet was starting to blister. The cardinal wasbeing roasted alive. Langdon fixed his sights on the cleat and ran for it.In the rear of the church, Vittoria clutched the back of a pew, trying to gatherher senses. The image overhead was horrid. She forced her eyes away. Dosomething! She wondered where Olivetti was. Had he seen the Hassassin? Had hecaught him? Where were they now? Vittoria moved forward to help Langdon, but asshe did, a sound stopped her.The crackling of the flames was getting louder by the instant, but a secondsound also cut the air. A metallic vibration. Nearby. The repetitive pulseseemed to emanate from the end of the pews to her left. It was a stark rattle,like the ringing of a phone, but stony and hard. She clutched the gun firmly andmoved down the row of pews. The sound grew louder. On. Off. A recurrentvibration.As she approached the end of the aisle, she sensed the sound was coming from thefloor just around the corner at the end of the pews. As she moved forward, gunoutstretched in her right hand, she realized she was also holding something inher left hand-her cell phone. In her panic she had forgotten that outside shehad used it to dial the commander… setting off his phone’s silent vibrationfeature as a warning. Vittoria raised her phone to her ear. It was stillringing. The commander had never answered. Suddenly, with rising fear, Vittoriasensed she knew what was making the sound. She stepped forward, trembling.The entire church seemed to sink beneath her feet as her eyes met the lifelessform on the floor. No stream of liquid flowed from the body. No signs ofviolence tattooed the flesh. There was only the fearful geometry of thecommander’s head… torqued backward, twisted 180 degrees in the wrong direction.Vittoria fought the images of her own father’s mangled body.The phone on the commander’s belt lay against the floor, vibrating over and overagainst the cold marble. Vittoria hung up her own phone, and the ringingstopped. In the silence, Vittoria heard a new sound. A breathing in the darkdirectly behind her.She started to spin, gun raised, but she knew she was too late. A laser beam ofheat screamed from the top of her skull to the soles of her feet as the killer’selbow crashed down on the back of her neck.“Now you are mine,” a voice said.Then, everything went black.Across the sanctuary, on the left lateral wall, Langdon balanced atop a pew andscraped upward on the wall trying to reach the cleat. The cable was still sixfeet above his head. Cleats like these were common in churches and were placedhigh to prevent tampering. Langdon knew priests used wooden ladders calledpiuтli to access the cleats. The killer had obviously used the church’s ladderto hoist his victim. So where the hell is the ladder now! Langdon looked down,searching the floor around him. He had a faint recollection of seeing a ladderin here somewhere. But where? A moment later his heart sank. He realized wherehe had seen it. He turned toward the raging fire. Sure enough, the ladder washigh atop the blaze, engulfed in flames.Filled now with desperation, Langdon scanned the entire church from his raisedplatform, looking for anything at all that could help him reach the cleat. Ashis eyes probed the church, he had a sudden realization.Where the hell is Vittoria? She had disappeared. Did she go for help? Langdonscreamed out her name, but there was no response. And where is Olivetti!There was a howl of pain from above, and Langdon sensed he was already too late.As his eyes went skyward again and saw the slowly roasting victim, Langdon hadthoughts for only one thing. Water. Lots of it. Put out the fire. At least lowerthe flames. “I need water, damn it!” he yelled out loud.“That’s next,” a voice growled from the back of the church.Langdon wheeled, almost falling off the pews.Striding up the side aisle directly toward him came a dark monster of a man.Even in the glow of the fire, his eyes burned black. Langdon recognized the gunin his hand as the one from his own jacket pocket… the one Vittoria had beencarrying when they came in.The sudden wave of panic that rose in Langdon was a frenzy of disjunct fears.His initial instinct was for Vittoria. What had this animal done to her? Was shehurt? Or worse? In the same instant, Langdon realized the man overhead wasscreaming louder. The cardinal would die. Helping him now was impossible. Then,as the Hassassin leveled the gun at Langdon’s chest, Langdon’s panic turnedinward, his senses on overload. He reacted on instinct as the shot went off.Launching off the bench, Langdon sailed arms first over the sea of church pews.When he hit the pews, he hit harder than he had imagined, immediately rolling tothe floor. The marble cushioned his fall with all the grace of cold steel.Footsteps closed to his right. Langdon turned his body toward the front of thechurch and began scrambling for his life beneath the pews.High above the chapel floor, Cardinal Guidera endured his last torturous momentsof consciousness. As he looked down the length of his naked body, he saw theskin on his legs begin to blister and peel away. I am in hell, he decided. God,why hast thou forsaken me? He knew this must be hell because he was looking atthe brand on his chest upside down… and yet, as if by the devil’s magic, theword made perfect sense.[images/00001.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"92Three ballotings. No Pope.Inside the Sistine Chapel, Cardinal Mortati had begun praying for a miracle.Send us the candidates! The delay had gone long enough. A single missingcandidate, Mortati could understand. But all four? It left no options. Underthese conditions, achieving a two-thirds majority would take an act of GodHimself.When the bolts on the outer door began to grind open, Mortati and the entireCollege of Cardinals wheeled in unison toward the entrance. Mortati knew thisunsealing could mean only one thing. By law, the chapel door could only beunsealed for two reasons-to remove the very ill, or to admit late cardinals.The preferiti are coming!Mortati’s heart soared. Conclave had been saved.But when the door opened, the gasp that echoed through the chapel was not one ofjoy. Mortati stared in incredulous shock as the man walked in. For the firsttime in Vatican history, a camerlegno had just crossed the sacred threshold ofconclave after sealing the doors.What is he thinking!The camerlegno strode to the altar and turned to address the thunderstruckaudience. “Signori,” he said, “I have waited as long as I can. There issomething you have a right to know.”"},{"pageContent":"93Langdon had no idea where he was going. Reflex was his only compass, driving himaway from danger. His elbows and knees burned as he clambered beneath the pews.Still he clawed on. Somewhere a voice was telling him to move left. If you canget to the main aisle, you can dash for the exit. He knew it was impossible.There’s a wall of flames blocking the main aisle! His mind hunting for options,Langdon scrambled blindly on. The footsteps closed faster now to his right.When it happened, Langdon was unprepared. He had guessed he had another ten feetof pews until he reached the front of the church. He had guessed wrong. Withoutwarning, the cover above him ran out. He froze for an instant, half exposed atthe front of the church. Rising in the recess to his left, gargantuan from thisvantage point, was the very thing that had brought him here. He had entirelyforgotten. Bernini’s Ecstasy of St. Teresa rose up like some sort ofpornographic still life… the saint on her back, arched in pleasure, mouth openin a moan, and over her, an angel pointing his spear of fire.A bullet exploded in the pew over Langdon’s head. He felt his body rise like asprinter out of a gate. Fueled only by adrenaline, and barely conscious of hisactions, he was suddenly running, hunched, head down, pounding across the frontof the church to his right. As the bullets erupted behind him, Langdon dove yetagain, sliding out of control across the marble floor before crashing in a heapagainst the railing of a niche on the right-hand wall.It was then that he saw her. A crumpled heap near the back of the church.Vittoria! Her bare legs were twisted beneath her, but Langdon sensed somehowthat she was breathing. He had no time to help her.Immediately, the killer rounded the pews on the far left of the church and borerelentlessly down. Langdon knew in a heartbeat it was over. The killer raisedthe weapon, and Langdon did the only thing he could do. He rolled his body overthe banister into the niche. As he hit the floor on the other side, the marblecolumns of the balustrade exploded in a storm of bullets.Langdon felt like a cornered animal as he scrambled deeper into the semicircularniche. Rising before him, the niche’s sole contents seemed ironically apropos-asingle sarcophagus. Mine perhaps, Langdon thought. Even the casket itself seemedfitting. It was a scаtola-a small, unadorned, marble box. Burial on a budget.The casket was raised off the floor on two marble blocks, and Langdon eyed theopening beneath it, wondering if he could slide through.Footsteps echoed behind him.With no other option in sight, Langdon pressed himself to the floor andslithered toward the casket. Grabbing the two marble supports, one with eachhand, he pulled like a breaststroker, dragging his torso into the openingbeneath the tomb. The gun went off.Accompanying the roar of the gun, Langdon felt a sensation he had never felt inhis life… a bullet sailing past his flesh. There was a hiss of wind, like thebacklash of a whip, as the bullet just missed him and exploded in the marblewith a puff of dust. Blood surging, Langdon heaved his body the rest of the waybeneath the casket. Scrambling across the marble floor, he pulled himself outfrom beneath the casket and to the other side.Dead end.Langdon was now face to face with the rear wall of the niche. He had no doubtthat this tiny space behind the tomb would become his grave. And soon, herealized, as he saw the barrel of the gun appear in the opening beneath thesarcophagus. The Hassassin held the weapon parallel with the floor, pointingdirectly at Langdon’s midsection.Impossible to miss.Langdon felt a trace of self-preservation grip his unconscious mind. He twistedhis body onto his stomach, parallel with the casket. Facedown, he planted hishands flat on the floor, the glass cut from the archives pinching open with astab. Ignoring the pain, he pushed. Driving his body upward in an awkwardpush-up, Langdon arched his stomach off the floor just as the gun went off. Hecould feel the shock wave of the bullets as they sailed beneath him andpulverized the porous travertine behind. Closing his eyes and straining againstexhaustion, Langdon prayed for the thunder to stop.And then it did.The roar of gunfire was replaced with the cold click of an empty chamber.Langdon opened his eyes slowly, almost fearful his eyelids would make a sound.Fighting the trembling pain, he held his position, arched like a cat. He didn’teven dare breathe. His eardrums numbed by gunfire, Langdon listened for any hintof the killer’s departure. Silence. He thought of Vittoria and ached to helpher.The sound that followed was deafening. Barely human. A guttural bellow ofexertion.The sarcophagus over Langdon’s head suddenly seemed to rise on its side. Langdoncollapsed on the floor as hundreds of pounds teetered toward him. Gravityovercame friction, and the lid was the first to go, sliding off the tomb andcrashing to the floor beside him. The casket came next, rolling off its supportsand toppling upside down toward Langdon.As the box rolled, Langdon knew he would either be entombed in the hollowbeneath it or crushed by one of the edges. Pulling in his legs and head, Langdoncompacted his body and yanked his arms to his sides. Then he closed his eyes andawaited the sickening crush.When it came, the entire floor shook beneath him. The upper rim landed onlymillimeters from the top of his head, rattling his teeth in their sockets. Hisright arm, which Langdon had been certain would be crushed, miraculously stillfelt intact. He opened his eyes to see a shaft of light. The right rim of thecasket had not fallen all the way to the floor and was still propped partiallyon its supports. Directly overhead, though, Langdon found himself staring quiteliterally into the face of death.The original occupant of the tomb was suspended above him, having adhered, asdecaying bodies often did, to the bottom of the casket. The skeleton hovered amoment, like a tentative lover, and then with a sticky crackling, it succumbedto gravity and peeled away. The carcass rushed down to embrace him, rainingputrid bones and dust into Langdon’s eyes and mouth.Before Langdon could react, a blind arm was slithering through the openingbeneath the casket, sifting through the carcass like a hungry python. It gropeduntil it found Langdon’s neck and clamped down. Langdon tried to fight backagainst the iron fist now crushing his larynx, but he found his left sleevepinched beneath the edge of the coffin. He had only one arm free, and the fightwas a losing battle.Langdon’s legs bent in the only open space he had, his feet searching for thecasket floor above him. He found it. Coiling, he planted his feet. Then, as thehand around his neck squeezed tighter, Langdon closed his eyes and extended hislegs like a ram. The casket shifted, ever so slightly, but enough.With a raw grinding, the sarcophagus slid off the supports and landed on thefloor. The casket rim crashed onto the killer’s arm, and there was a muffledscream of pain. The hand released Langdon’s neck, twisting and jerking away intothe dark. When the killer finally pulled his arm free, the casket fell with aconclusive thud against the flat marble floor.Complete darkness. Again.And silence.There was no frustrated pounding outside the overturned sarcophagus. No pryingto get in. Nothing. As Langdon lay in the dark amidst a pile of bones, he foughtthe closing darkness and turned his thoughts to her.Vittoria. Are you alive?If Langdon had known the truth-the horror to which Vittoria would soon awake-hewould have wished for her sake that she were dead."},{"pageContent":"94Sitting in the Sistine Chapel among his stunned colleagues, Cardinal Mortatitried to comprehend the words he was hearing. Before him, lit only by thecandlelight, the camerlegno had just told a tale of such hatred and treacherythat Mortati found himself trembling. The camerlegno spoke of kidnappedcardinals, branded cardinals, murdered cardinals. He spoke of the ancientIlluminati-a name that dredged up forgotten fears-and of their resurgence andvow of revenge against the church. With pain in his voice, the camerlegno spokeof his late Pope… the victim of an Illuminati poisoning. And finally, his wordsalmost a whisper, he spoke of a deadly new technology, antimatter, which in lessthan two hours threatened to destroy all of Vatican City.When he was through, it was as if Satan himself had sucked the air from theroom. Nobody could move. The camerlegno’s words hung in the darkness.The only sound Mortati could now hear was the anomalous hum of a televisioncamera in back-an electronic presence no conclave in history had everendured-but a presence demanded by the camerlegno. To the utter astonishment ofthe cardinals, the camerlegno had entered the Sistine Chapel with two BBCreporters-a man and a woman-and announced that they would be transmitting hissolemn statement, live to the world.Now, speaking directly to the camera, the camerlegno stepped forward. “To theIlluminati,” he said, his voice deepening, “and to those of science, let me saythis.” He paused. “You have won the war.”The silence spread now to the deepest corners of the chapel. Mortati could hearthe desperate thumping of his own heart.“The wheels have been in motion for a long time,” the camerlegno said. “Yourvictory has been inevitable. Never before has it been as obvious as it is atthis moment. Science is the new God.”What is he saying! Mortati thought. Has he gone mad? The entire world is hearingthis!“Medicine, electronic communications, space travel, genetic manipulation… theseare the miracles about which we now tell our children. These are the miracles weherald as proof that science will bring us the answers. The ancient stories ofimmaculate conceptions, burning bushes, and parting seas are no longer relevant.God has become obsolete. Science has won the battle. We concede.”A rustle of confusion and bewilderment swept through the chapel.“But science’s victory,” the camerlegno added, his voice intensifying, “has costevery one of us. And it has cost us deeply.”Silence.“Science may have alleviated the miseries of disease and drudgery and providedan array of gadgetry for our entertainment and convenience, but it has left usin a world without wonder. Our sunsets have been reduced to wavelengths andfrequencies. The complexities of the universe have been shredded intomathematical equations. Even our self-worth as human beings has been destroyed.Science proclaims that Planet Earth and its inhabitants are a meaningless speckin the grand scheme. A cosmic accident.” He paused. “Even the technology thatpromises to unite us, divides us. Each of us is now electronically connected tothe globe, and yet we feel utterly alone. We are bombarded with violence,division, fracture, and betrayal. Skepticism has become a virtue. Cynicism anddemand for proof has become enlightened thought. Is it any wonder that humansnow feel more depressed and defeated than they have at any point in humanhistory? Does science hold anything sacred? Science looks for answers by probingour unborn fetuses. Science even presumes to rearrange our own DNA. It shattersGod’s world into smaller and smaller pieces in quest of meaning… and all itfinds is more questions.”Mortati watched in awe. The camerlegno was almost hypnotic now. He had aphysical strength in his movements and voice that Mortati had never witnessed ona Vatican altar. The man’s voice was wrought with conviction and sadness.“The ancient war between science and religion is over,” the camerlegno said.“You have won. But you have not won fairly. You have not won by providinganswers. You have won by so radically reorienting our society that the truths weonce saw as signposts now seem inapplicable. Religion cannot keep up. Scientificgrowth is exponential. It feeds on itself like a virus. Every new breakthroughopens doors for new breakthroughs. Mankind took thousands of years to progressfrom the wheel to the car. Yet only decades from the car into space. Now wemeasure scientific progress in weeks. We are spinning out of control. The riftbetween us grows deeper and deeper, and as religion is left behind, people findthemselves in a spiritual void. We cry out for meaning. And believe me, we docry out. We see UFOs, engage in channeling, spirit contact, out-of-bodyexperiences, mindquests-all these eccentric ideas have a scientific veneer, butthey are unashamedly irrational. They are the desperate cry of the modern soul,lonely and tormented, crippled by its own enlightenment and its inability toaccept meaning in anything removed from technology.”Mortati could feel himself leaning forward in his seat. He and the othercardinals and people around the world were hanging on this priest’s everyutterance. The camerlegno spoke with no rhetoric or vitriol. No references toscripture or Jesus Christ. He spoke in modern terms, unadorned and pure.Somehow, as though the words were flowing from God himself, he spoke the modernlanguage… delivering the ancient message. In that moment, Mortati saw one of thereasons the late Pope held this young man so dear. In a world of apathy,cynicism, and technological deification, men like the camerlegno, realists whocould speak to our souls like this man just had, were the church’s only hope.The camerlegno was talking more forcefully now. “Science, you say, will save us.Science, I say, has destroyed us. Since the days of Galileo, the church hastried to slow the relentless march of science, sometimes with misguided means,but always with benevolent intention. Even so, the temptations are too great forman to resist. I warn you, look around yourselves. The promises of science havenot been kept. Promises of efficiency and simplicity have bred nothing butpollution and chaos. We are a fractured and frantic species… moving down a pathof destruction.”The camerlegno paused a long moment and then sharpened his eyes on the camera.“Who is this God science? Who is the God who offers his people power but nomoral framework to tell you how to use that power? What kind of God gives achild fire but does not warn the child of its dangers? The language of sciencecomes with no signposts about good and bad. Science textbooks tell us how tocreate a nuclear reaction, and yet they contain no chapter asking us if it is agood or a bad idea.“To science, I say this. The church is tired. We are exhausted from trying to beyour signposts. Our resources are drying up from our campaign to be the voice ofbalance as you plow blindly on in your quest for smaller chips and largerprofits. We ask not why you will not govern yourselves, but how can you? Yourworld moves so fast that if you stop even for an instant to consider theimplications of your actions, someone more efficient will whip past you in ablur. So you move on. You proliferate weapons of mass destruction, but it is thePope who travels the world beseeching leaders to use restraint. You clone livingcreatures, but it is the church reminding us to consider the moral implicationsof our actions. You encourage people to interact on phones, video screens, andcomputers, but it is the church who opens its doors and reminds us to commune inperson as we were meant to do. You even murder unborn babies in the name ofresearch that will save lives. Again, it is the church who points out thefallacy of this reasoning.“And all the while, you proclaim the church is ignorant. But who is moreignorant? The man who cannot define lightning, or the man who does not respectits awesome power? This church is reaching out to you. Reaching out to everyone.And yet the more we reach, the more you push us away. Show me proof there is aGod, you say. I say use your telescopes to look to the heavens, and tell me howthere could not be a God!” The camerlegno had tears in his eyes now. “You askwhat does God look like. I say, where did that question come from? The answersare one and the same. Do you not see God in your science? How can you miss Him!You proclaim that even the slightest change in the force of gravity or theweight of an atom would have rendered our universe a lifeless mist rather thanour magnificent sea of heavenly bodies, and yet you fail to see God’s hand inthis? Is it really so much easier to believe that we simply chose the right cardfrom a deck of billions? Have we become so spiritually bankrupt that we wouldrather believe in mathematical impossibility than in a power greater than us?“Whether or not you believe in God,” the camerlegno said, his voice deepeningwith deliberation, “you must believe this. When we as a species abandon ourtrust in the power greater than us, we abandon our sense of accountability.Faith… all faiths… are admonitions that there is something we cannot understand,something to which we are accountable… With faith we are accountable to eachother, to ourselves, and to a higher truth. Religion is flawed, but only becauseman is flawed. If the outside world could see this church as I do… lookingbeyond the ritual of these walls… they would see a modern miracle… a brotherhoodof imperfect, simple souls wanting only to be a voice of compassion in a worldspinning out of control.”The camerlegno motioned out over the College of Cardinals, and the BBCcamerawoman instinctively followed, panning the crowd.“Are we obsolete?” the camerlegno asked. “Are these men dino-saurs? Am I? Doesthe world really need a voice for the poor, the weak, the oppressed, the unbornchild? Do we really need souls like these who, though imperfect, spend theirlives imploring each of us to read the signposts of morality and not lose ourway?”Mortati now realized that the camerlegno, whether consciously or not, was makinga brilliant move. By showing the cardinals, he was personalizing the church.Vatican City was no longer a building, it was people-people like the camerlegnowho had spent their lives in the service of goodness.“Tonight we are perched on a precipice,” the camerlegno said. “None of us canafford to be apathetic. Whether you see this evil as Satan, corruption, orimmorality… the dark force is alive and growing every day. Do not ignore it.”The camerlegno lowered his voice to a whisper, and the camera moved in. “Theforce, though mighty, is not invincible. Goodness can prevail. Listen to yourhearts. Listen to God. Together we can step back from this abyss.”Now Mortati understood. This was the reason. Conclave had been violated, butthis was the only way. It was a dramatic and desperate plea for help. Thecamerlegno was speaking to both his enemy and his friends now. He was entreatinganyone, friend or foe, to see the light and stop this madness. Certainly someonelistening would realize the insanity of this plot and come forward.The camerlegno knelt at the altar. “Pray with me.”The College of Cardinals dropped to their knees to join him in prayer. Outsidein St. Peter’s Square and around the globe… a stunned world knelt with them."},{"pageContent":"95The Hassassin lay his unconscious trophy in the rear of the van and took amoment to admire her sprawled body. She was not as beautiful as the women hebought, and yet she had an animal strength that excited him. Her body wasradiant, dewy with perspiration. She smelled of musk.As the Hassasin stood there savoring his prize, he ignored the throb in his arm.The bruise from the falling sarcophagus, although painful, was insignificant…well worth the compensation that lay before him. He took consolation in knowingthe American who had done this to him was probably dead by now.Gazing down at his incapacitated prisoner, the Hassassin visualized what layahead. He ran a palm up beneath her shirt. Her breasts felt perfect beneath herbra. Yes, he smiled. You are more than worthy. Fighting the urge to take herright there, he closed the door and drove off into the night.There was no need to alert the press about this killing… the flames would dothat for him.At CERN, Sylvie sat stunned by the camerlegno’s address. Never before had shefelt so proud to be a Catholic and so ashamed to work at CERN. As she left therecreational wing, the mood in every single viewing room was dazed and somber.When she got back to Kohler’s office, all seven phone lines were ringing. Mediainquiries were never routed to Kohler’s office, so the incoming calls could onlybe one thing.Geld. Money calls.Antimatter technology already had some takers.Inside the Vatican, Gunther Glick was walking on air as he followed thecamerlegno from the Sistine Chapel. Glick and Macri had just made the livetransmission of the decade. And what a transmission it had been. The camerlegnohad been spellbinding.Now out in the hallway, the camerlegno turned to Glick and Macri. “I have askedthe Swiss Guard to assemble photos for you-photos of the branded cardinals aswell as one of His late Holiness. I must warn you, these are not pleasantpictures. Ghastly burns. Blackened tongues. But I would like you to broadcastthem to the world.”Glick decided it must be perpetual Christmas inside Vatican City. He wants me tobroadcast an exclusive photo of the dead Pope? “Are you sure?” Glick asked,trying to keep the excitement from his voice.The camerlegno nodded. “The Swiss Guard will also provide you a live video feedof the antimatter canister as it counts down.”Glick stared. Christmas. Christmas. Christmas!“The Illuminati are about to find out,” the camerlegno declared, “that they havegrossly overplayed their hand.”"},{"pageContent":"96Like a recurring theme in some demonic symphony, the suffocating darkness hadreturned.No light. No air. No exit.Langdon lay trapped beneath the overturned sarcophagus and felt his mindcareening dangerously close to the brink. Trying to drive his thoughts in anydirection other than the crushing space around him, Langdon urged his mindtoward some logical process… mathematics, music, anything. But there was no roomfor calming thoughts. I can’t move! I can’t breathe!The pinched sleeve of his jacket had thankfully come free when the casket fell,leaving Langdon now with two mobile arms. Even so, as he pressed upward on theceiling of his tiny cell, he found it immovable. Oddly, he wished his sleevewere still caught. At least it might create a crack for some air.As Langdon pushed against the roof above, his sleeve fell back to reveal thefaint glow of an old friend. Mickey. The greenish cartoon face seemed mockingnow.Langdon probed the blackness for any other sign of light, but the casket rim wasflush against the floor. Goddamn Italian perfectionists, he cursed, nowimperiled by the same artistic excellence he taught his students to revere…impeccable edges, faultless parallels, and of course, use only of the mostseamless and resilient Carrara marble.Precision can be suffocating.“Lift the damn thing,” he said aloud, pressing harder through the tangle ofbones. The box shifted slightly. Setting his jaw, he heaved again. The box feltlike a boulder, but this time it raised a quarter of an inch. A fleeting glimmerof light surrounded him, and then the casket thudded back down. Langdon laypanting in the dark. He tried to use his legs to lift as he had before, but nowthat the sarcophagus had fallen flat, there was no room even to straighten hisknees.As the claustrophobic panic closed in, Langdon was overcome by images of thesarcophagus shrinking around him. Squeezed by delirium, he fought the illusionwith every logical shred of intellect he had.“Sarcophagus,” he stated aloud, with as much academic sterility as he couldmuster. But even erudition seemed to be his enemy today. Sarcophagus is from theGreek “sarx”meaning “flesh,” and “phagein” meaning “to eat.” I’m trapped in abox literally designed to “eat flesh.”Images of flesh eaten from bone only served as a grim reminder that Langdon laycovered in human remains. The notion brought nausea and chills. But it alsobrought an idea.Fumbling blindly around the coffin, Langdon found a shard of bone. A rib maybe?He didn’t care. All he wanted was a wedge. If he could lift the box, even acrack, and slide the bone fragment beneath the rim, then maybe enough air could…Reaching across his body and wedging the tapered end of the bone into the crackbetween the floor and the coffin, Langdon reached up with his other hand andheaved skyward. The box did not move. Not even slightly. He tried again. For amoment, it seemed to tremble slightly, but that was all.With the fetid stench and lack of oxygen choking the strength from his body,Langdon realized he only had time for one more effort. He also knew he wouldneed both arms.Regrouping, he placed the tapered edge of the bone against the crack, andshifting his body, he wedged the bone against his shoulder, pinning it in place.Careful not to dislodge it, he raised both hands above him. As the stiflingconfine began to smother him, he felt a welling of intensified panic. It was thesecond time today he had been trapped with no air. Hollering aloud, Langdonthrust upward in one explosive motion. The casket jostled off the floor for aninstant. But long enough. The bone shard he had braced against his shoulderslipped outward into the widening crack. When the casket fell again, the boneshattered. But this time Langdon could see the casket was propped up. A tinyslit of light showed beneath the rim.Exhausted, Langdon collapsed. Hoping the strangling sensation in his throatwould pass, he waited. But it only worsened as the seconds passed. Whatever airwas coming through the slit seemed imperceptible. Langdon wondered if it wouldbe enough to keep him alive. And if so, for how long? If he passed out, whowould know he was even in there?With arms like lead, Langdon raised his watch again: 10:12 P.M. Fightingtrembling fingers, he fumbled with the watch and made his final play. He twistedone of the tiny dials and pressed a button.As consciousness faded, and the walls squeezed closer, Langdon felt the oldfears sweep over him. He tried to imagine, as he had so many times, that he wasin an open field. The image he conjured, however, was no help. The nightmarethat had haunted him since his youth came crashing back…The flowers here are like paintings, the child thought, laughing as he ranacross the meadow. He wished his parents had come along. But his parents werebusy pitching camp.“Don’t explore too far,” his mother had said.He had pretended not to hear as he bounded off into the woods.Now, traversing this glorious field, the boy came across a pile of fieldstones.He figured it must be the foundation of an old homestead. He would not go nearit. He knew better. Besides, his eyes had been drawn to something else-abrilliant lady’s slipper-the rarest and most beautiful flower in New Hampshire.He had only ever seen them in books.Excited, the boy moved toward the flower. He knelt down. The ground beneath himfelt mulchy and hollow. He realized his flower had found an extra-fertile spot.It was growing from a patch of rotting wood.Thrilled by the thought of taking home his prize, the boy reached out… fingersextending toward the stem.He never reached it.With a sickening crack, the earth gave way.In the three seconds of dizzying terror as he fell, the boy knew he would die.Plummeting downward, he braced for the bone-crushing collision. When it came,there was no pain. Only softness.And cold.He hit the deep liquid face first, plunging into a narrow blackness. Spinningdisoriented somersaults, he groped the sheer walls that enclosed him on allsides. Somehow, as if by instinct, he sputtered to the surface.Light.Faint. Above him. Miles above him, it seemed.His arms clawed at the water, searching the walls of the hollow for something tograb onto. Only smooth stone. He had fallen through an abandoned well covering.He screamed for help, but his cries reverberated in the tight shaft. He calledout again and again. Above him, the tattered hole grew dim.Night fell.Time seemed to contort in the darkness. Numbness set in as he treaded water inthe depths of the chasm, calling, crying out. He was tormented by visions of thewalls collapsing in, burying him alive. His arms ached with fatigue. A few timeshe thought he heard voices. He shouted out, but his own voice was muted… like adream.As the night wore on, the shaft deepened. The walls inched quietly inward. Theboy pressed out against the enclosure, pushing it away. Exhausted, he wanted togive up. And yet he felt the water buoy him, cooling his burning fears until hewas numb.When the rescue team arrived, they found the boy barely conscious. He had beentreading water for five hours. Two days later, the Boston Globe ran a front-pagestory called “The Little Swimmer That Could.”"},{"pageContent":"97The Hassassin smiled as he pulled his van into the mammoth stone structureoverlooking the Tiber River. He carried his prize up and up… spiraling higher inthe stone tunnel, grateful his load was slender.He arrived at the door.The Church of Illumination, he gloated. The ancient Illuminati meeting room. Whowould have imagined it to be here?Inside, he lay her on a plush divan. Then he expertly bound her arms behind herback and tied her feet. He knew that what he longed for would have to wait untilhis final task was finished. Water.Still, he thought, he had a moment for indulgence. Kneeling beside her, he ranhis hand along her thigh. It was smooth. Higher. His dark fingers snaked beneaththe cuff of her shorts. Higher.He stopped. Patience, he told himself, feeling aroused. There is work to bedone.He walked for a moment out onto the chamber’s high stone balcony. The eveningbreeze slowly cooled his ardor. Far below the Tiber raged. He raised his eyes tothe dome of St. Peter’s, three quarters of a mile away, naked under the glare ofhundreds of press lights.“Your final hour,” he said aloud, picturing the thousands of Muslims slaughteredduring the Crusades. “At midnight you will meet your God.”Behind him, the woman stirred. The Hassassin turned. He considered letting herwake up. Seeing terror in a woman’s eyes was his ultimate aphrodisiac.He opted for prudence. It would be better if she remained unconscious while hewas gone. Although she was tied and would never escape, the Hassassin did notwant to return and find her exhausted from struggling. I want your strengthpreserved… for me.Lifting her head slightly, he placed his palm beneath her neck and found thehollow directly beneath her skull. The crown/meridian pressure point was one hehad used countless times. With crushing force, he drove his thumb into the softcartilage and felt it depress. The woman slumped instantly.Twenty minutes, hethought. She would be a tantalizing end to a perfect day. After she had servedhim and died doing it, he would stand on the balcony and watch the midnightVatican fireworks.Leaving his prize unconscious on the couch, the Hassassin went downstairs into atorchlit dungeon. The final task. He walked to the table and revered the sacred,metal forms that had been left there for him.Water. It was his last.Removing a torch from the wall as he had done three times already, he beganheating the end. When the end of the object was white hot, he carried it to thecell.Inside, a single man stood in silence. Old and alone.“Cardinal Baggia,” the killer hissed. “Have you prayed yet?”The Italian’s eyes were fearless. “Only for your soul.”"},{"pageContent":"98The six pompieri firemen who responded to the fire at the Church of Santa MariaDella Vittoria extinguished the bonfire with blasts of Halon gas. Water wascheaper, but the steam it created would have ruined the frescoes in the chapel,and the Vatican paid Roman pompieri a healthy stipend for swift and prudentservice in all Vatican-owned buildings.Pompieri, by the nature of their work, witnessed tragedy almost daily, but theexecution in this church was something none of them would ever forget. Partcrucifixion, part hanging, part burning at the stake, the scene was somethingdredged from a Gothic nightmare.Unfortunately, the press, as usual, had arrived before the fire department.They’d shot plenty of video before the pompieri cleared the church. When thefiremen finally cut the victim down and lay him on the floor, there was no doubtwho the man was.“Cardinale Guidera,” one whispered. “Di Barcellona.”The victim was nude. The lower half of his body was crimson-black, blood oozingthrough gaping cracks in his thighs. His shinbones were exposed. One firemanvomited. Another went outside to breathe.The true horror, though, was the symbol seared on the cardinal’s chest. Thesquad chief circled the corpse in awestruck dread. Lavoro del diavolo, he saidto himself. Satan himself did this. He crossed himself for the first time sincechildhood.“Un‘ altro corpo!” someone yelled. One of the firemen had found another body.The second victim was a man the chief recognized immediately. The austerecommander of the Swiss Guard was a man for whom few public law enforcementofficials had any affection. The chief called the Vatican, but all the circuitswere busy. He knew it didn’t matter. The Swiss Guard would hear about this ontelevision in a matter of minutes.As the chief surveyed the damage, trying to recreate what possibly could havegone on here, he saw a niche riddled with bullet holes. A coffin had been rolledoff its supports and fallen upside down in an apparent struggle. It was a mess.That’s for the police and Holy See to deal with, the chief thought, turningaway.As he turned, though, he stopped. Coming from the coffin he heard a sound. Itwas not a sound any fireman ever liked to hear.“Bomba!” he cried out. “Tutti fuori!”When the bomb squad rolled the coffin over, they discovered the source of theelectronic beeping. They stared, confused.“Mиdico!” one finally screamed. “Mиdico!”"},{"pageContent":"99Any word from Olivetti?“ the camerlegno asked, looking drained as Rocherescorted him back from the Sistine Chapel to the Pope’s office.“No, signore. I am fearing the worst.”When they reached the Pope’s office, the camerlegno’s voice was heavy. “Captain,there is nothing more I can do here tonight. I fear I have done too muchalready. I am going into this office to pray. I do not wish to be disturbed. Therest is in God’s hands.”“Yes, signore.”“The hour is late, Captain. Find that canister.”“Our search continues.” Rocher hesitated. “The weapon proves to be too wellhidden.”The camerlegno winced, as if he could not think of it. “Yes. At exactly 11:15P.M., if the church is still in peril, I want you to evacuate the cardinals. Iam putting their safety in your hands. I ask only one thing. Let these menproceed from this place with dignity. Let them exit into St. Peter’s Square andstand side by side with the rest of the world. I do not want the last image ofthis church to be frightened old men sneaking out a back door.”“Very good, signore. And you? Shall I come for you at 11:15 as well?”“There will be no need.”“Signore?”“I will leave when the spirit moves me.”Rocher wondered if the camerlegno intended to go down with the ship.The camerlegno opened the door to the Pope’s office and entered. “Actually…” hesaid, turning. “There is one thing.”“Signore?”“There seems to be a chill in this office tonight. I am trembling.”“The electric heat is out. Let me lay you a fire.”The camerlegno smiled tiredly. “Thank you. Thank you, very much.”Rocher exited the Pope’s office where he had left the camerlegno praying byfirelight in front of a small statue of the Blessed Mother Mary. It was an eeriesight. A black shadow kneeling in the flickering glow. As Rocher headed down thehall, a guard appeared, running toward him. Even by candlelight Rocherrecognized Lieutenant Chartrand. Young, green, and eager.“Captain,” Chartrand called, holding out a cellular phone. “I think thecamerlegno’s address may have worked. We’ve got a caller here who says he hasinformation that can help us. He phoned on one of the Vatican’s privateextensions. I have no idea how he got the number.”Rocher stopped. “What?”“He will only speak to the ranking officer.”“Any word from Olivetti?”“No, sir.”He took the receiver. “This is Captain Rocher. I am ranking officer here.”“Rocher,” the voice said. “I will explain to you who I am. Then I will tell youwhat you are going to do next.”When the caller stopped talking and hung up, Rocher stood stunned. He now knewfrom whom he was taking orders.Back at CERN, Sylvie Baudeloque was frantically trying to keep track of all thelicensing inquiries coming in on Kohler’s voice mail. When the private line onthe director’s desk began to ring, Sylvie jumped. Nobody had that number. Sheanswered.“Yes?”“Ms. Baudeloque? This is Director Kohler. Contact my pilot. My jet is to beready in five minutes.”"},{"pageContent":"100Robert Langdon had no idea where he was or how long he had been unconscious whenhe opened his eyes and found himself staring up at the underside of a baroque,frescoed cupola. Smoke drifted overhead. Something was covering his mouth. Anoxygen mask. He pulled it off. There was a terrible smell in the room-likeburning flesh.Langdon winced at the pounding in his head. He tried to sit up. A man in whitewas kneeling beside him.“Riposati!” the man said, easing Langdon onto his back again. “Sono ilparamйdico.”Langdon succumbed, his head spiraling like the smoke overhead. What the hellhappened? Wispy feelings of panic sifted through his mind.“Sуrcio salvatore,” the paramedic said. “Mouse… savior.”Langdon felt even more lost. Mouse savior?The man motioned to the Mickey Mouse watch on Langdon’s wrist. Langdon’sthoughts began to clear. He remembered setting the alarm. As he stared absentlyat the watch face, Langdon also noted the hour. 10:28 P.M.He sat bolt upright.Then, it all came back.Langdon stood near the main altar with the fire chief and a few of his men. Theyhad been rattling him with questions. Langdon wasn’t listening. He had questionsof his own. His whole body ached, but he knew he needed to act immediately.A pompiero approached Langdon across the church. “I checked again, sir. The onlybodies we found are Cardinal Guidera and the Swiss Guard commander. There’s nosign of a woman here.”“Grazie,” Langdon said, unsure whether he was relieved or horrified. He knew hehad seen Vittoria unconscious on the floor. Now she was gone. The onlyexplanation he came up with was not a comforting one. The killer had not beensubtle on the phone. A woman of spirit. I am aroused. Perhaps before this nightis over, I will find you. And when I do…“Langdon looked around. “Where is the Swiss Guard?”“Still no contact. Vatican lines are jammed.”Langdon felt overwhelmed and alone. Olivetti was dead. The cardinal was dead.Vittoria was missing. A half hour of his life had disappeared in a blink.Outside, Langdon could hear the press swarming. He suspected footage of thethird cardinal’s horrific death would no doubt air soon, if it hadn’t already.Langdon hoped the camerlegno had long since assumed the worst and taken action.Evacuate the damn Vatican! Enough games! We lose!Langdon suddenly realized that all of the catalysts that had been drivinghim-helping to save Vatican City, rescuing the four cardinals, coming face toface with the brotherhood he had studied for years-all of these things hadevaporated from his mind. The war was lost. A new compulsion had ignited withinhim. It was simple. Stark. Primal.Find Vittoria.He felt an unexpected emptiness inside. Langdon had often heard that intensesituations could unite two people in ways that decades together often did not.He now believed it. In Vittoria’s absence he felt something he had not felt inyears. Loneliness. The pain gave him strength.Pushing all else from his mind, Langdon mustered his concentration. He prayedthat the Hassassin would take care of business before pleasure. Otherwise,Langdon knew he was already too late. No, he told himself, you have time.Vittoria’s captor still had work to do. He had to surface one last time beforedisappearing forever.The last altar of science, Langdon thought. The killer had one final task.Earth. Air. Fire. Water.He looked at his watch. Thirty minutes. Langdon moved past the firemen towardBernini’s Ecstasy of St. Teresa. This time, as he stared at Bernini’s marker,Langdon had no doubt what he was looking for.Let angels guide you on your lofty quest…Directly over the recumbent saint, against a backdrop of gilded flame, hoveredBernini’s angel. The angel’s hand clutched a pointed spear of fire. Langdon’seyes followed the direction of the shaft, arching toward the right side of thechurch. His eyes hit the wall. He scanned the spot where the spear was pointing.There was nothing there. Langdon knew, of course, the spear was pointing farbeyond the wall, into the night, somewhere across Rome.“What direction is that?” Langdon asked, turning and addressing the chief with anewfound determination.“Direction?” The chief glanced where Langdon was pointing. He sounded confused.“I don’t know… west, I think.”“What churches are in that direction?”The chief’s puzzlement seemed to deepen. “Dozens. Why?”Langdon frowned. Of course there were dozens. “I need a city map. Right away.”The chief sent someone running out to the fire truck for a map. Langdon turnedback to the statue. Earth… Air… Fire… VITTORIA.The final marker is Water, he told himself. Bernini’s Water. It was in a churchout there somewhere. A needle in a haystack. He spurred his mind through all theBernini works he could recall. I need a tribute to Water!Langdon flashed on Bernini’s statue of Triton-the Greek God of the sea. Then herealized it was located in the square outside this very church, in entirely thewrong direction. He forced himself to think. What figure would Bernini havecarved as a glorification of water? Neptune and Apollo? Unfortunately thatstatue was in London’s Victoria & Albert Museum.“Signore?” A fireman ran in with a map.Langdon thanked him and spread it out on the altar. He immediately realized hehad asked the right people; the fire department’s map of Rome was as detailed asany Langdon had ever seen. “Where are we now?”The man pointed. “Next to Piazza Barberini.”Langdon looked at the angel’s spear again to get his bearings. The chief hadestimated correctly. According to the map, the spear was pointing west. Langdontraced a line from his current location west across the map. Almost instantlyhis hopes began to sink. It seemed that with every inch his finger traveled, hepassed yet another building marked by a tiny black cross. Churches. The city wasriddled with them. Finally, Langdon’s finger ran out of churches and trailed offinto the suburbs of Rome. He exhaled and stepped back from the map. Damn.Surveying the whole of Rome, Langdon’s eyes touched down on the three churcheswhere the first three cardinals had been killed. The Chigi Chapel… St. Peter’s…here…Seeing them all laid out before him now, Langdon noted an oddity in theirlocations. Somehow he had imagined the churches would be scattered randomlyacross Rome. But they most definitely were not. Improbably, the three churchesseemed to be separated systematically, in an enormous city-wide triangle.Langdon double-checked. He was not imagining things. “Penna,” he said suddenly,without looking up.Someone handed him a ballpoint pen.Langdon circled the three churches. His pulse quickened. He triple-checked hismarkings. A symmetrical triangle!Langdon’s first thought was for the Great Seal on the one-dollar bill-thetriangle containing the all-seeing eye. But it didn’t make sense. He had markedonly three points. There were supposed to be four in all.So where the hell is Water? Langdon knew that anywhere he placed the fourthpoint, the triangle would be destroyed. The only option to retain the symmetrywas to place the fourth marker inside the triangle, at the center. He looked atthe spot on the map. Nothing. The idea bothered him anyway. The four elements ofscience were considered equal. Water was not special; Water would not be at thecenter of the others.Still, his instinct told him the systematic arrangement could not possibly beaccidental. I’m not yet seeing the whole picture. There was only onealternative. The four points did not make a triangle; they made some othershape.Langdon looked at the map. A square, perhaps? Although a square made no symbolicsense, squares were symmetrical at least. Langdon put his finger on the map atone of the points that would turn the triangle into a square. He saw immediatelythat a perfect square was impossible. The angles of the original triangle wereoblique and created more of a distorted quadrilateral.As he studied the other possible points around the triangle, somethingunexpected happened. He noticed that the line he had drawn earlier to indicatethe direction of the angel’s spear passed perfectly through one of thepossibilities. Stupefied, Langdon circled that point. He was now looking at fourink marks on the map, arranged in somewhat of an awkward, kitelike diamond.He frowned. Diamonds were not an Illuminati symbol either. He paused. Thenagain…For an instant Langdon flashed on the famed Illuminati Diamond. The thought, ofcourse, was ridiculous. He dismissed it. Besides, this diamond was oblong-like akite-hardly an example of the flawless symmetry for which the Illuminati Diamondwas revered.When he leaned in to examine where he had placed the final mark, Langdon wassurprised to find that the fourth point lay dead center of Rome’s famed PiazzaNavona. He knew the piazza contained a major church, but he had already tracedhis finger through that piazza and considered the church there. To the best ofhis knowledge it contained no Bernini works. The church was called Saint Agnesin Agony, named for St. Agnes, a ravishing teenage virgin banished to a life ofsexual slavery for refusing to renounce her faith.There must be something in that church! Langdon racked his brain, picturing theinside of the church. He could think of no Bernini works at all inside, muchless anything to do with water. The arrangement on the map was bothering himtoo. A diamond. It was far too accurate to be coincidence, but it was notaccurate enough to make any sense. A kite? Langdon wondered if he had chosen thewrong point. What am I missing!The answer took another thirty seconds to hit him, but when it did, Langdon feltan exhilaration like nothing he had ever experienced in his academic career.The Illuminati genius, it seemed, would never cease.The shape he was looking at was not intended as a diamond at all. The fourpoints only formed a diamond because Langdon had connected adjacent points. TheIlluminati believe in opposites! Connecting opposite vertices with his pen,Langdon’s fingers were trembling. There before him on the map was a giantcruciform. It’s a cross! The four elements of science unfolded before his eyes…sprawled across Rome in an enormous, city-wide cross.As he stared in wonder, a line of poetry rang in his mind… like an old friendwith a new face.‘Cross Rome the mystic elements unfold…‘Cross Rome…The fog began to clear. Langdon saw that the answer had been in front of him allnight! The Illuminati poem had been telling him how the altars were laid out. Across!‘Cross Rome the mystic elements unfold!It was cunning wordplay. Langdon had originally read the word ‘Cross as anabbreviation of Across. He assumed it was poetic license intended to retain themeter of the poem. But it was so much more than that! Another hidden clue.The cruciform on the map, Langdon realized, was the ultimate Illuminati duality.It was a religious symbol formed by elements of science. Galileo’s path ofIllumination was a tribute to both science and God!The rest of the puzzle fell into place almost immediately.Piazza Navona.Dead center of Piazza Navona, outside the church of St. Agnes in Agony, Berninihad forged one of his most celebrated sculptures. Everyone who came to Rome wentto see it.The Fountain of the Four Rivers!A flawless tribute to water, Bernini’s Fountain of the Four Rivers glorified thefour major rivers of the Old World-The Nile, Ganges, Danube, and Rio Plata.Water, Langdon thought. The final marker. It was perfect.And even more perfect, Langdon realized, the cherry on the cake, was that highatop Bernini’s fountain stood a towering obelisk.Leaving confused firemen in his wake, Langdon ran across the church in thedirection of Olivetti’s lifeless body.10:31 P.M., he thought. Plenty of time. It was the first instant all day thatLangdon felt ahead of the game.Kneeling beside Olivetti, out of sight behind some pews, Langdon discreetly tookpossession of the commander’s semiautomatic and walkie-talkie. Langdon knew hewould call for help, but this was not the place to do it. The final altar ofscience needed to remain a secret for now. The media and fire department racingwith sirens blaring to Piazza Navona would be no help at all.Without a word, Langdon slipped out the door and skirted the press, who were nowentering the church in droves. He crossed Piazza Barberini. In the shadows heturned on the walkie-talkie. He tried to hail Vatican City but heard nothing butstatic. He was either out of range or the transmitter needed some kind ofauthorization code. Langdon adjusted the complex dials and buttons to no avail.Abruptly, he realized his plan to get help was not going to work. He spun,looking for a pay phone. None. Vatican circuits were jammed anyway.He was alone.Feeling his initial surge of confidence decay, Langdon stood a moment and tookstock of his pitiful state-covered in bone dust, cut, deliriously exhausted, andhungry.Langdon glanced back at the church. Smoke spiraled over the cupola, lit by themedia lights and fire trucks. He wondered if he should go back and get help.Instinct warned him however that extra help, especially untrained help, would benothing but a liability. If the Hassassin sees us coming… He thought of Vittoriaand knew this would be his final chance to face her captor.Piazza Navona, he thought, knowing he could get there in plenty of time andstake it out. He scanned the area for a taxi, but the streets were almostentirely deserted. Even the taxi drivers, it seemed, had dropped everything tofind a television. Piazza Navona was only about a mile away, but Langdon had nointention of wasting precious energy on foot. He glanced back at the church,wondering if he could borrow a vehicle from someone.A fire truck? A press van? Be serious.Sensing options and minutes slipping away, Langdon made his decision. Pullingthe gun from his pocket, he committed an act so out of character that hesuspected his soul must now be possessed. Running over to a lone Citroлn sedanidling at a stoplight, Langdon pointed the weapon through the driver’s openwindow. “Fuori!” he yelled.The trembling man got out.Langdon jumped behind the wheel and hit the gas."},{"pageContent":"101Gunther Glick sat on a bench in a holding tank inside the office of the SwissGuard. He prayed to every god he could think of. Please let this NOT be a dream.It had been the scoop of his life. The scoop of anyone’s life. Every reporter onearth wished he were Glick right now. You are awake, he told himself. And youare a star. Dan Rather is crying right now.Macri was beside him, looking a little bit stunned. Glick didn’t blame her. Inaddition to exclusively broadcasting the camerlegno’s address, she and Glick hadprovided the world with gruesome photos of the cardinals and of the Pope-thattongue!-as well as a live video feed of the antimatter canister counting down.Incredible!Of course, all of that had all been at the camerlegno’s behest, so that was notthe reason Glick and Macri were now locked in a Swiss Guard holding tank. It hadbeen Glick’s daring addendum to their coverage that the guards had notappreciated. Glick knew the conversation on which he had just reported was notintended for his ears, but this was his moment in the sun. Another Glick scoop!“The 11th Hour Samaritan?” Macri groaned on the bench beside him, clearlyunimpressed.Glick smiled. “Brilliant, wasn’t it?”“Brilliantly dumb.”She’s just jealous, Glick knew. Shortly after the camerlegno’s address, Glickhad again, by chance, been in the right place at the right time. He’d overheardRocher giving new orders to his men. Apparently Rocher had received a phone callfrom a mysterious individual who Rocher claimed had critical informationregarding the current crisis. Rocher was talking as if this man could help themand was advising his guards to prepare for the guest’s arrival.Although the information was clearly private, Glick had acted as any dedicatedreporter would-without honor. He’d found a dark corner, ordered Macri to fire upher remote camera, and he’d reported the news.“Shocking new developments in God’s city,” he had announced, squinting his eyesfor added intensity. Then he’d gone on to say that a mystery guest was coming toVatican City to save the day. The 11th Hour Samaritan, Glick had called him-aperfect name for the faceless man appearing at the last moment to do a gooddeed. The other networks had picked up the catchy sound bite, and Glick was yetagain immortalized.I’m brilliant, he mused. Peter Jennings just jumped off a bridge.Of course Glick had not stopped there. While he had the world’s attention, hehad thrown in a little of his own conspiracy theory for good measure.Brilliant. Utterly brilliant.“You screwed us,” Macri said. “You totally blew it.”“What do you mean? I was great!”Macri stared disbelievingly. “Former President George Bush? An Illuminatus?”Glick smiled. How much more obvious could it be? George Bush was awell-documented, 33rd-degree Mason, and he was the head of the CIA when theagency closed their Illuminati investigation for lack of evidence. And all thosespeeches about “a thousand points of light” and a “New World Order”… Bush wasobviously Illuminati.“And that bit about CERN?” Macri chided. “You are going to have a very big lineof lawyers outside your door tomorrow.”“CERN? Oh come on! It’s so obvious! Think about it! The Illuminati disappear offthe face of the earth in the 1950s at about the same time CERN is founded. CERNis a haven for the most enlightened people on earth. Tons of private funding.They build a weapon that can destroy the church, and oops!… they lose it!”“So you tell the world that CERN is the new home base of the Illuminati?”“Obviously! Brotherhoods don’t just disappear. The Illuminati had to gosomewhere. CERN is a perfect place for them to hide. I’m not saying everyone atCERN is Illuminati. It’s probably like a huge Masonic lodge, where most peopleare innocent, but the upper echelons-”“Have you ever heard of slander, Glick? Liability?”“Have you ever heard of real journalism!”“Journalism? You were pulling bullshit out of thin air! I should have turned offthe camera! And what the hell was that crap about CERN’s corporate logo? Satanicsymbology? Have you lost your mind?”Glick smiled. Macri’s jealousy was definitely showing. The CERN logo had beenthe most brilliant coup of all. Ever since the camerlegno’s address, all thenetworks were talking about CERN and antimatter. Some stations were showing theCERN corporate logo as a backdrop. The logo seemed standard enough-twointersecting circles representing two particle accelerators, and five tangentiallines representing particle injection tubes. The whole world was staring at thislogo, but it had been Glick, a bit of a symbologist himself, who had first seenthe Illuminati symbology hidden in it.“You’re not a symbologist,” Macri chided, “you’re just one lucky-ass reporter.You should have left the symbology to the Harvard guy.”“The Harvard guy missed it,” Glick said.The Illuminati significance in this logo is so obvious!He was beaming inside. Although CERN had lots of accelerators, their logo showedonly two. Two is the Illuminati number of duality. Although most acceleratorshad only one injection tube, the logo showed five. Five is the number of theIlluminati pentagram. Then had come the coup-the most brilliant point of all.Glick pointed out that the logo contained a large numeral “6-clearly formed byone of the lines and circles-and when the logo was rotated, another sixappeared… and then another. The logo contained three sixes! 666! The devil’snumber! The mark of the beast!Glick was a genius.Macri looked ready to slug him.The jealousy would pass, Glick knew, his mind now wandering to another thought.If CERN was Illuminati headquarters, was CERN where the Illuminati kept theirinfamous Illuminati Diamond? Glick had read about it on the Internet-“a flawlessdiamond, born of the ancient elements with such perfection that all those whosaw it could only stand in wonder.”Glick wondered if the secret whereabouts of the Illuminati Diamond might be yetanother mystery he could unveil tonight."},{"pageContent":"102Piazza Navona. Fountain of the Four Rivers.Nights in Rome, like those in the desert, can be surprisingly cool, even after awarm day. Langdon was huddled now on the fringes of Piazza Navona, pulling hisjacket around him. Like the distant white noise of traffic, a cacophony of newsreports echoed across the city. He checked his watch. Fifteen minutes. He wasgrateful for a few moments of rest.The piazza was deserted. Bernini’s masterful fountain sizzled before him with afearful sorcery. The foaming pool sent a magical mist upward, lit from beneathby underwater floodlights. Langdon sensed a cool electricity in the air.The fountain’s most arresting quality was its height. The central core alone wasover twenty feet tall-a rugged mountain of travertine marble riddled with cavesand grottoes through which the water churned. The entire mound was draped withpagan figures. Atop this stood an obelisk that climbed another forty feet.Langdon let his eyes climb. On the obelisk’s tip, a faint shadow blotted thesky, a lone pigeon perched silently.A cross, Langdon thought, still amazed by the arrangement of the markers acrossRome. Bernini’s Fountain of the Four Rivers was the last altar of science. Onlyhours ago Langdon had been standing in the Pantheon convinced the Path ofIllumination had been broken and he would never get this far. It had been afoolish blunder. In fact, the entire path was intact. Earth, Air, Fire, Water.And Langdon had followed it… from beginning to end.Not quite to the end, he reminded himself. The path had five stops, not four.This fourth marker fountain somehow pointed to the ultimate destiny-theIlluminati’s sacred lair-the Church of Illumination. Langdon wondered if thelair were still standing. He wondered if that was where the Hassassin had takenVittoria.Langdon found his eyes probing the figures in the fountain, looking for any clueas to the direction of the lair. Let angels guide you on your lofty quest.Almost immediately, though, he was overcome by an unsettling awareness. Thisfountain contained no angels whatsoever. It certainly contained none Langdoncould see from where he was standing… and none he had ever seen in the past. TheFountain of the Four Rivers was a pagan work. The carvings were allprofane-humans, animals, even an awkward armadillo. An angel here would stickout like a sore thumb.Is this the wrong place? He considered the cruciform arrangement of the fourobelisks. He clenched his fists. This fountain is perfect.It was only 10:46 P.M. when a black van emerged from the alleyway on the farside of the piazza. Langdon would not have given it a second look except thatthe van drove with no headlights. Like a shark patrolling a moonlit bay, thevehicle circled the perimeter of the piazza.Langdon hunkered lower, crouched in the shadows beside the huge stairway leadingup to the Church of St. Agnes in Agony. He gazed out at the piazza, his pulseclimbing.After making two complete circuits, the van banked inward toward Bernini’sfountain. It pulled abreast of the basin, moving laterally along the rim untilits side was flush with the fountain. Then it parked, its sliding doorpositioned only inches above the churning water.Mist billowed.Langdon felt an uneasy premonition. Had the Hassassin arrived early? Had he comein a van? Langdon had imagined the killer escorting his last victim across thepiazza on foot, like he had at St. Peter’s, giving Langdon an open shot. But ifthe Hassassin had arrived in a van, the rules had just changed.Suddenly, the van’s side door slid open.On the floor of the van, contorted in agony, lay a naked man. The man waswrapped in yards of heavy chains. He thrashed against the iron links, but thechains were too heavy. One of the links bisected the man’s mouth like a horse’sbit, stifling his cries for help. It was then that Langdon saw the secondfigure, moving around behind the prisoner in the dark, as though making finalpreparations.Langdon knew he had only seconds to act.Taking the gun, he slipped off his jacket and dropped it on the ground. Hedidn’t want the added encumbrance of a tweed jacket, nor did he have anyintention of taking Galileo’s Diagramma anywhere near the water. The documentwould stay here where it was safe and dry.Langdon scrambled to his right. Circling the perimeter of the fountain, hepositioned himself directly opposite the van. The fountain’s massive centerpieceobscured his view. Standing, he ran directly toward the basin. He hoped thethundering water was drowning his footsteps. When he reached the fountain, heclimbed over the rim and dropped into the foaming pool.The water was waist deep and like ice. Langdon grit his teeth and plowed throughthe water. The bottom was slippery, made doubly treacherous by a stratum ofcoins thrown for good luck. Langdon sensed he would need more than good luck. Asthe mist rose all around him, he wondered if it was the cold or the fear thatwas causing the gun in his hand to shake.He reached the interior of the fountain and circled back to his left. He wadedhard, clinging to the cover of the marble forms. Hiding himself behind the hugecarved form of a horse, Langdon peered out. The van was only fifteen feet away.The Hassassin was crouched on the floor of the van, hands planted on thecardinal’s chain-clad body, preparing to roll him out the open door into thefountain.Waist-deep in water, Robert Langdon raised his gun and stepped out of the mist,feeling like some sort of aquatic cowboy making a final stand. “Don’t move.” Hisvoice was steadier than the gun.The Hassassin looked up. For a moment he seemed confused, as though he had seena ghost. Then his lips curled into an evil smile. He raised his arms insubmission. “And so it goes.”“Get out of the van.”“You look wet.”“You’re early.”“I am eager to return to my prize.”Langdon leveled the gun. “I won’t hesitate to shoot.”“You’ve already hesitated.”Langdon felt his finger tighten on the trigger. The cardinal lay motionless now.He looked exhausted, moribund. “Untie him.”“Forget him. You’ve come for the woman. Do not pretend otherwise.”Langdon fought the urge to end it right there. “Where is she?”“Somewhere safe. Awaiting my return.”She’s alive. Langdon felt a ray of hope. “At the Church of Illumination?”The killer smiled. “You will never find its location.”Langdon was incredulous. The lair is still standing. He aimed the gun. “Where?”“The location has remained secret for centuries. Even to me it was only revealedrecently. I would die before I break that trust.”“I can find it without you.”“An arrogant thought.”Langdon motioned to the fountain. “I’ve come this far.”“So have many. The final step is the hardest.”Langdon stepped closer, his footing tentative beneath the water. The Hassassinlooked remarkably calm, squatting there in the back of the van with his armsraised over his head. Langdon aimed at his chest, wondering if he should simplyshoot and be done with it. No. He knows where Vittoria is. He knows where theantimatter is. I need information!From the darkness of the van the Hassassin gazed out at his aggressor andcouldn’t help but feel an amused pity. The American was brave, that he hadproven. But he was also untrained. That he had also proven. Valor withoutexpertise was suicide. There were rules of survival. Ancient rules. And theAmerican was breaking all of them.You had the advantage-the element of surprise. You squandered it.The American was indecisive… hoping for backup most likely… or perhaps a slip ofthe tongue that would reveal critical information.Never interrogate before you disable your prey. A cornered enemy is a deadlyenemy.The American was talking again. Probing. Maneuvering.The killer almost laughed aloud. This is not one of your Hollywood movies… therewill be no long discussions at gunpoint before the final shoot-out. This is theend. Now.Without breaking eye contact, the killer inched his hands across the ceiling ofthe van until he found what he was looking for. Staring dead ahead, he graspedit.Then he made his play.The motion was utterly unexpected. For an instant, Langdon thought the laws ofphysics had ceased to exist. The killer seemed to hang weightless in the air ashis legs shot out from beneath him, his boots driving into the cardinal’s sideand launching the chain-laden body out the door. The cardinal splashed down,sending up a sheet of spray.Water dousing his face, Langdon realized too late what had happened. The killerhad grasped one of the van’s roll bars and used it to swing outward. Now theHassassin was sailing toward him, feet-first through the spray.Langdon pulled the trigger, and the silencer spat. The bullet exploded throughthe toe of the Hassassin’s left boot. Instantly Langdon felt the soles of theHassassin’s boots connect with his chest, driving him back with a crushing kick.The two men splashed down in a spray of blood and water.As the icy liquid engulfed Langdon’s body, his first cognition was pain.Survival instinct came next. He realized he was no longer holding his weapon. Ithad been knocked away. Diving deep, he groped along the slimy bottom. His handgripped metal. A handful of coins. He dropped them. Opening his eyes, Langdonscanned the glowing basin. The water churned around him like a frigid Jacuzzi.Despite the instinct to breathe, fear kept him on the bottom. Always moving. Hedid not know from where the next assault would come. He needed to find the gun!His hands groped desperately in front of him.You have the advantage, he told himself. You are in your element. Even in asoaked turtleneck Langdon was an agile swimmer. Water is your element.When Langdon’s fingers found metal a second time, he was certain his luck hadchanged. The object in his hand was no handful of coins. He gripped it and triedto pull it toward him, but when he did, he found himself gliding through thewater. The object was stationary.Langdon realized even before he coasted over the cardinal’s writhing body thathe had grasped part of the metal chain that was weighing the man down. Langdonhovered a moment, immobilized by the sight of the terrified face staring up athim from the floor of the fountain.Jolted by the life in the man’s eyes, Langdon reached down and grabbed thechains, trying to heave him toward the surface. The body came slowly… like ananchor. Langdon pulled harder. When the cardinal’s head broke the surface, theold man gasped a few sucking, desperate breaths. Then, violently, his bodyrolled, causing Langdon to lose his grip on the slippery chains. Like a stone,Baggia went down again and disappeared beneath the foaming water.Langdon dove, eyes wide in the liquid murkiness. He found the cardinal. Thistime, when Langdon grabbed on, the chains across Baggia’s chest shifted… partingto reveal a further wickedness… a word stamped in seared flesh.[images/00006.jpg]An instant later, two boots strode into view. One was gushing blood."},{"pageContent":"103As a water polo player, Robert Langdon had endured more than his fair share ofunderwater battles. The competitive savagery that raged beneath the surface of awater polo pool, away from the eyes of the referees, could rival even theugliest wrestling match. Langdon had been kicked, scratched, held, and evenbitten once by a frustrated defenseman from whom Langdon had continuouslytwisted away.Now, though, thrashing in the frigid water of Bernini’s fountain, Langdon knewhe was a long way from the Harvard pool. He was fighting not for a game, but forhis life. This was the second time they had battled. No referees here. Norematches. The arms driving his face toward the bottom of the basin thrust witha force that left no doubt that it intended to kill.Langdon instinctively spun like a torpedo. Break the hold! But the grip torquedhim back, his attacker enjoying an advantage no water polo defenseman everhad-two feet on solid ground. Langdon contorted, trying to get his own feetbeneath him. The Hassassin seemed to be favoring one arm… but nonetheless, hisgrip held firm.It was then that Langdon knew he was not coming up. He did the only thing hecould think of to do. He stopped trying to surface. If you can’t go north, goeast. Marshalling the last of his strength, Langdon dolphin-kicked his legs andpulled his arms beneath him in an awkward butterfly stroke. His body lurchedforward.The sudden switch in direction seemed to take the Hassassin off guard. Langdon’slateral motion dragged his captor’s arms sideways, compromising his balance. Theman’s grip faltered, and Langdon kicked again. The sensation felt like a towlinehad snapped. Suddenly Langdon was free. Blowing the stale air from his lungs,Langdon clawed for the surface. A single breath was all he got. With crashingforce the Hassassin was on top of him again, palms on his shoulders, all of hisweight bearing down. Langdon scrambled to plant his feet beneath him but theHassassin’s leg swung out, cutting Langdon down.He went under again.Langdon’s muscles burned as he twisted beneath the water. This time hismaneuvers were in vain. Through the bubbling water, Langdon scanned the bottom,looking for the gun. Everything was blurred. The bubbles were denser here. Ablinding light flashed in his face as the killer wrestled him deeper, toward asubmerged spotlight bolted on the floor of the fountain. Langdon reached out,grabbing the canister. It was hot. Langdon tried to pull himself free, but thecontraption was mounted on hinges and pivoted in his hand. His leverage wasinstantly lost.The Hassassin drove him deeper still.It was then Langdon saw it. Poking out from under the coins directly beneath hisface. A narrow, black cylinder. The silencer of Olivetti’s gun! Langdon reachedout, but as his fingers wrapped around the cylinder, he did not feel metal, hefelt plastic. When he pulled, the flexible rubber hose came flopping toward himlike a flimsy snake. It was about two feet long with a jet of bubbles surgingfrom the end. Langdon had not found the gun at all. It was one of the fountain’smany harmless spumanti… bubble makers.Only a few feet away, Cardinal Baggia felt his soul straining to leave his body.Although he had prepared for this moment his entire life, he had never imaginedthe end would be like this. His physical shell was in agony… burned, bruised,and held underwater by an immovable weight. He reminded himself that thissuffering was nothing compared to what Jesus had endured.He died for my sins…Baggia could hear the thrashing of a battle raging nearby. He could not bear thethought of it. His captor was about to extinguish yet another life… the man withkind eyes, the man who had tried to help.As the pain mounted, Baggia lay on his back and stared up through the water atthe black sky above him. For a moment he thought he saw stars.It was time.Releasing all fear and doubt, Baggia opened his mouth and expelled what he knewwould be his final breath. He watched his spirit gurgle heavenward in a burst oftransparent bubbles. Then, reflexively, he gasped. The water poured in like icydaggers to his sides. The pain lasted only a few seconds.Then… peace.The Hassassin ignored the burning in his foot and focused on the drowningAmerican, whom he now held pinned beneath him in the churning water. Finish itfully. He tightened his grip, knowing this time Robert Langdon would notsurvive. As he predicted, his victim’s struggling became weaker and weaker.Suddenly Langdon’s body went rigid. He began to shake wildly.Yes, the Hassassin mused. The rigors. When the water first hits the lungs. Therigors, he knew, would last about five seconds.They lasted six.Then, exactly as the Hassassin expected, his victim went suddenly flaccid. Likea great deflating balloon, Robert Langdon fell limp. It was over. The Hassassinheld him down for another thirty seconds to let the water flood all of hispulmonary tissue. Gradually, he felt Langdon’s body sink, on its own accord, tothe bottom. Finally, the Hassassin let go. The media would find a doublesurprise in the Fountain of the Four Rivers.“Tabban!” the Hassassin swore, clambering out of the fountain and looking at hisbleeding toe. The tip of his boot was shredded, and the front of his big toe hadbeen sheared off. Angry at his own carelessness, he tore the cuff from his pantleg and rammed the fabric into the toe of his boot. Pain shot up his leg. “Ibnal-kalb!” He clenched his fists and rammed the cloth deeper. The bleeding sloweduntil it was only a trickle.Turning his thoughts from pain to pleasure, the Hassassin got into his van. Hiswork in Rome was done. He knew exactly what would soothe his discomfort.Vittoria Vetra was bound and waiting. The Hassassin, even cold and wet, felthimself stiffen.I have earned my reward.Across town Vittoria awoke in pain. She was on her back. All of her muscles feltlike stone. Tight. Brittle. Her arms hurt. When she tried to move, she feltspasms in her shoulders. It took her a moment to comprehend her hands were tiedbehind her back. Her initial reaction was confusion. Am I dreaming? But when shetried to lift her head, the pain at the base of her skull informed her of herwakefulness.Confusion transforming to fear, she scanned her surroundings. She was in acrude, stone room-large and well-furnished, lit by torches. Some kind of ancientmeeting hall. Old-fashioned benches sat in a circle nearby.Vittoria felt a breeze, cold now on her skin. Nearby, a set of double doorsstood open, beyond them a balcony. Through the slits in the balustrade, Vittoriacould have sworn she saw the Vatican."},{"pageContent":"104Robert Langdon lay on a bed of coins at the bottom of the Fountain of the FourRivers. His mouth was still wrapped around the plastic hose. The air beingpumped through the spumanti tube to froth the fountain had been polluted by thepump, and his throat burned. He was not complaining, though. He was alive.He was not sure how accurate his imitation of a drowning man had been, buthaving been around water his entire life, Langdon had certainly heard accounts.He had done his best. Near the end, he had even blown all the air from his lungsand stopped breathing so that his muscle mass would carry his body to the floor.Thankfully, the Hassassin had bought it and let go.Now, resting on the bottom of the fountain, Langdon had waited as long as hecould wait. He was about to start choking. He wondered if the Hassassin wasstill out there. Taking an acrid breath from the tube, Langdon let go and swamacross the bottom of the fountain until he found the smooth swell of the centralcore. Silently, he followed it upward, surfacing out of sight, in the shadowsbeneath the huge marble figures.The van was gone.That was all Langdon needed to see. Pulling a long breath of fresh air back intohis lungs, he scrambled back toward where Cardinal Baggia had gone down. Langdonknew the man would be unconscious now, and chances of revival were slim, but hehad to try. When Langdon found the body, he planted his feet on either side,reached down, and grabbed the chains wrapped around the cardinal. Then Langdonpulled. When the cardinal broke water, Langdon could see the eyes were alreadyrolled upward, bulging. Not a good sign. There was no breath or pulse.Knowing he could never get the body up and over the fountain rim, Langdon luggedCardinal Baggia through the water and into the hollow beneath the central moundof marble. Here the water became shallow, and there was an inclined ledge.Langdon dragged the naked body up onto the ledge as far as he could. Not far.Then he went to work. Compressing the cardinal’s chain-clad chest, Langdonpumped the water from his lungs. Then he began CPR. Counting carefully.Deliberately. Resisting the instinct to blow too hard and too fast. For threeminutes Langdon tried to revive the old man. After five minutes, Langdon knew itwas over.Il preferito. The man who would be Pope. Lying dead before him.Somehow, even now, prostrate in the shadows on the semisubmerged ledge, CardinalBaggia retained an air of quiet dignity. The water lapped softly across hischest, seeming almost remorseful… as if asking forgiveness for being the man’sultimate killer… as if trying to cleanse the scalded wound that bore its name.Gently, Langdon ran a hand across the man’s face and closed his upturned eyes.As he did, he felt an exhausted shudder of tears well from within. It startledhim. Then, for the first time in years, Langdon cried."},{"pageContent":"105The fog of weary emotion lifted slowly as Langdon waded away from the deadcardinal, back into deep water. Depleted and alone in the fountain, Langdonhalf-expected to collapse. But instead, he felt a new compulsion rising withinhim. Undeniable. Frantic. He sensed his muscles hardening with an unexpectedgrit. His mind, as though ignoring the pain in his heart, forced aside the pastand brought into focus the single, desperate task ahead.Find the Illuminati lair. Help Vittoria.Turning now to the mountainous core of Bernini’s fountain, Langdon summoned hopeand launched himself into his quest for the final Illuminati marker. He knewsomewhere on this gnarled mass of figures was a clue that pointed to the lair.As Langdon scanned the fountain, though, his hope withered quickly. The words ofthe segno seemed to gurgle mockingly all around him. Let angels guide you onyour lofty quest. Langdon glared at the carved forms before him. The fountain ispagan! It has no damn angels anywhere!When Langdon completed his fruitless search of the core, his eyes instinctivelyclimbed the towering stone pillar. Four markers, he thought, spread across Romein a giant cross.Scanning the hieroglyphics covering the obelisk, he wondered if perhaps therewere a clue hidden in the Egyptian symbology. He immediately dismissed the idea.The hieroglyphs predated Bernini by centuries, and hieroglyphs had not even beendecipherable until the Rosetta Stone was discovered. Still, Langdon ventured,maybe Bernini had carved an additional symbol? One that would go unnoticed amongall the hieroglyphs?Feeling a shimmer of hope, Langdon circumnavigated the fountain one more timeand studied all four faзades of the obelisk. It took him two minutes, and whenhe reached the end of the final face, his hopes sank. Nothing in the hieroglyphsstood out as any kind of addition. Certainly no angels.Langdon checked his watch. It was eleven on the dot. He couldn’t tell whethertime was flying or crawling. Images of Vittoria and the Hassassin started toswirl hauntingly as Langdon clambered his way around the fountain, thefrustration mounting as he frantically completed yet another fruitless circle.Beaten and exhausted, Langdon felt ready to collapse. He threw back his head toscream into the night.The sound jammed in his throat.Langdon was staring straight up the obelisk. The object perched at the very topwas one he had seen earlier and ignored. Now, however, it stopped him short. Itwas not an angel. Far from it. In fact, he had not even perceived it as part ofBernini’s fountain. He thought it was a living creature, another one of thecity’s scavengers perched on a lofty tower.A pigeon.Langdon squinted skyward at the object, his vision blurred by the glowing mistaround him. It was a pigeon, wasn’t it? He could clearly see the head and beaksilhouetted against a cluster of stars. And yet the bird had not budged sinceLangdon’s arrival, even with the battle below. The bird sat now exactly as ithad been when Langdon entered the square. It was perched high atop the obelisk,gazing calmly westward.Langdon stared at it a moment and then plunged his hand into the fountain andgrabbed a fistful of coins. He hurled the coins skyward. They clattered acrossthe upper levels of the granite obelisk. The bird did not budge. He tried again.This time, one of the coins hit the mark. A faint sound of metal on metalclanged across the square.The damned pigeon was bronze.You’re looking for an angel, not a pigeon, a voice reminded him. But it was toolate. Langdon had made the connection. He realized the bird was not a pigeon atall.It was a dove.Barely aware of his own actions, Langdon splashed toward the center of thefountain and began scrambling up the travertine mountain, clambering over hugearms and heads, pulling himself higher. Halfway to the base of the obelisk, heemerged from the mist and could see the head of the bird more clearly.There was no doubt. It was a dove. The bird’s deceptively dark color was theresult of Rome’s pollution tarnishing the original bronze. Then the significancehit him. He had seen a pair of doves earlier today at the Pantheon. A pair ofdoves carried no meaning. This dove, however, was alone.The lone dove is the pagan symbol for the Angel of Peace.The truth almost lifted Langdon the rest of the way to the obelisk. Bernini hadchosen the pagan symbol for the angel so he could disguise it in a paganfountain. Let angels guide you on your lofty quest. The dove is the angel!Langdon could think of no more lofty perch for the Illuminati’s final markerthan atop this obelisk.The bird was looking west. Langdon tried to follow its gaze, but he could notsee over the buildings. He climbed higher. A quote from St. Gregory of Nyssaemerged from his memory most unexpectedly. As the soul becomes enlightened… ittakes the beautiful shape of the dove.Langdon rose heavenward. Toward the dove. He was almost flying now. He reachedthe platform from which the obelisk rose and could climb no higher. With onelook around, though, he knew he didn’t have to. All of Rome spread out beforehim. The view was stunning.To his left, the chaotic media lights surrounding St. Peter’s. To his right, thesmoking cupola of Santa Maria della Vittoria. In front of him in the distance,Piazza del Popolo. Beneath him, the fourth and final point. A giant cross ofobelisks.Trembling, Langdon looked to the dove overhead. He turned and faced the properdirection, and then he lowered his eyes to the skyline.In an instant he saw it.So obvious. So clear. So deviously simple.Staring at it now, Langdon could not believe the Illuminati lair had stayedhidden for so many years. The entire city seemed to fade away as he looked outat the monstrous stone structure across the river in front of him. The buildingwas as famous as any in Rome. It stood on the banks of the Tiber Riverdiagonally adjacent to the Vatican. The building’s geometry was stark-a circularcastle, within a square fortress, and then, outside its walls, surrounding theentire structure, a park in the shape of a pentagram.The ancient stone ramparts before him were dramatically lit by soft floodlights.High atop the castle stood the mammoth bronze angel. The angel pointed his sworddownward at the exact center of the castle. And as if that were not enough,leading solely and directly to the castle’s main entrance stood the famousBridge of Angels… a dramatic approachway adorned by twelve towering angelscarved by none other than Bernini himself.In a final breathtaking revelation, Langdon realized Bernini’s city-wide crossof obelisks marked the fortress in perfect Illuminati fashion; the cross’scentral arm passed directly through the center of the castle’s bridge, dividingit into two equal halves.Langdon retrieved his tweed coat, holding it away from his dripping body. Thenhe jumped into the stolen sedan and rammed his soggy shoe into the accelerator,speeding off into the night."},{"pageContent":"106It was 11:07 P.M. Langdon’s car raced through the Roman night. Speeding downLungotevere Tor Di Nona, parallel with the river, Langdon could now see hisdestination rising like a mountain to his right.Castel Sant‘ Angelo. Castle of the Angel.Without warning, the turnoff to the narrow Bridge of Angels-Ponte Sant‘Angelo-appeared suddenly. Langdon slammed on his brakes and swerved. He turnedin time, but the bridge was barricaded. He skidded ten feet and collided with aseries of short cement pillars blocking his way. Langdon lurched forward as thevehicle stalled, wheezing and shuddering. He had forgotten the Bridge of Angels,in order to preserve it, was now zoned pedestrians only.Shaken, Langdon staggered from the crumpled car, wishing now he had chosen oneof the other routes. He felt chilled, shivering from the fountain. He donned hisHarris tweed over his damp shirt, grateful for Harris’s trademark double lining.The Diagramma folio would remain dry. Before him, across the bridge, the stonefortress rose like a mountain. Aching and depleted, Langdon broke into a lopingrun.On both sides of him now, like a gauntlet of escorts, a procession of Berniniangels whipped past, funneling him toward his final destination. Let angelsguide you on your lofty quest. The castle seemed to rise as he advanced, anunscalable peak, more intimidating to him even than St. Peter’s. He sprintedtoward the bastion, running on fumes, gazing upward at the citadel’s circularcore as it shot skyward to a gargantuan, sword-wielding angel.The castle appeared deserted.Langdon knew through the centuries the building had been used by the Vatican asa tomb, a fortress, a papal hideout, a prison for enemies of the church, and amuseum. Apparently, the castle had other tenants as well-the Illuminati. Somehowit made eerie sense. Although the castle was property of the Vatican, it wasused only sporadically, and Bernini had made numerous renovations to it over theyears. The building was now rumored to be honeycombed with secret entries,passageways, and hidden chambers. Langdon had little doubt that the angel andsurrounding pentagonal park were Bernini’s doing as well.Arriving at the castle’s elephantine double doors, Langdon shoved them hard. Notsurprisingly, they were immovable. Two iron knockers hung at eye level. Langdondidn’t bother. He stepped back, his eyes climbing the sheer outer wall. Theseramparts had fended off armies of Berbers, heathens, and Moors. Somehow hesensed his chances of breaking in were slim.Vittoria, Langdon thought. Are you in there?Langdon hurried around the outer wall. There must be another entrance!Rounding the second bulwark to the west, Langdon arrived breathless in a smallparking area off Lungotere Angelo. On this wall he found a second castleentrance, a drawbridge-type ingress, raised and sealed shut. Langdon gazedupward again.The only lights on the castle were exterior floods illuminating the faзade. Allthe tiny windows inside seemed black. Langdon’s eyes climbed higher. At the verypeak of the central tower, a hundred feet above, directly beneath the angel’ssword, a single balcony protruded. The marble parapet seemed to shimmerslightly, as if the room beyond it were aglow with torchlight. Langdon paused,his soaked body shivering suddenly. A shadow? He waited, straining. Then he sawit again. His spine prickled. Someone is up there!“Vittoria!” he called out, unable to help himself, but his voice was swallowedby the raging Tiber behind him. He wheeled in circles, wondering where the hellthe Swiss Guard were. Had they even heard his transmission?Across the lot a large media truck was parked. Langdon ran toward it. A paunchyman in headphones sat in the cabin adjusting levers. Langdon rapped on the sideof the truck. The man jumped, saw Langdon’s dripping clothes, and yanked off hisheadset.“What’s the worry, mate?” His accent was Australian.“I need your phone.” Langdon was frenzied.The man shrugged. “No dial tone. Been trying all night. Circuits are packed.”Langdon swore aloud. “Have you seen anyone go in there?” He pointed to thedrawbridge.“Actually, yeah. A black van’s been going in and out all night.”Langdon felt a brick hit the bottom of his stomach.“Lucky bastard,” the Aussie said, gazing up at the tower, and then frowning athis obstructed view of the Vatican. “I bet the view from up there is perfect. Icouldn’t get through the traffic in St. Peter’s, so I’m shooting from here.”Langdon wasn’t listening. He was looking for options.“What do you say?” the Australian said. “This 11th Hour Samaritan for real?”Langdon turned. “The what?”“You didn’t hear? The Captain of the Swiss Guard got a call from somebody whoclaims to have some primo info. The guy’s flying in right now. All I know is ifhe saves the day… there go the ratings!” The man laughed.Langdon was suddenly confused. A good Samaritan flying in to help? Did theperson somehow know where the antimatter was? Then why didn’t he just tell theSwiss Guard? Why was he coming in person? Something was odd, but Langdon didn’thave time to figure out what.“Hey,” the Aussie said, studying Langdon more closely. “Ain’t you that guy I sawon TV? Trying to save that cardinal in St. Peter’s Square?”Langdon did not answer. His eyes had suddenly locked on a contraption attachedto the top of the truck-a satellite dish on a collapsible appendage. Langdonlooked at the castle again. The outer rampart was fifty feet tall. The innerfortress climbed farther still. A shelled defense. The top was impossibly highfrom here, but maybe if he could clear the first wall…Langdon spun to the newsman and pointed to the satellite arm. “How high doesthat go?”“Huh?” The man looked confused. “Fifteen meters. Why?”“Move the truck. Park next to the wall. I need help.”“What are you talking about?”Langdon explained.The Aussie’s eyes went wide. “Are you insane? That’s a two-hundred-thousand-dollar telescoping extension. Not a ladder!““You want ratings? I’ve got information that will make your day.” Langdon wasdesperate.“Information worth two hundred grand?”Langdon told him what he would reveal in exchange for the favor.Ninety seconds later, Robert Langdon was gripping the top of the satellite armwavering in the breeze fifty feet off the ground. Leaning out, he grabbed thetop of the first bulwark, dragged himself onto the wall, and dropped onto thecastle’s lower bastion.“Now keep your bargain!” the Aussie called up. “Where is he?”Langdon felt guilt-ridden for revealing this information, but a deal was a deal.Besides, the Hassassin would probably call the press anyway. “Piazza Navona,”Langdon shouted. “He’s in the fountain.”The Aussie lowered his satellite dish and peeled out after the scoop of hiscareer.In a stone chamber high above the city, the Hassassin removed his soaking bootsand bandaged his wounded toe. There was pain, but not so much that he couldn’tenjoy himself.He turned to his prize.She was in the corner of the room, on her back on a rudimentary divan, handstied behind her, mouth gagged. The Hassassin moved toward her. She was awakenow. This pleased him. Surprisingly, in her eyes, he saw fire instead of fear.The fear will come."},{"pageContent":"107Robert Langdon dashed around the outer bulwark of the castle, grateful for theglow of the floodlights. As he circled the wall, the courtyard beneath himlooked like a museum of ancient warfare-catapults, stacks of marble cannonballs,and an arsenal of fearful contraptions. Parts of the castle were open totourists during the day, and the courtyard had been partially restored to itsoriginal state.Langdon’s eyes crossed the courtyard to the central core of the fortress. Thecircular citadel shot skyward 107 feet to the bronze angel above. The balcony atthe top still glowed from within. Langdon wanted to call out but knew better. Hewould have to find a way in.He checked his watch.11:12 P.M.Dashing down the stone ramp that hugged the inside of the wall, Langdondescended to the courtyard. Back on ground level, he ran through shadows,clockwise around the fort. He passed three porticos, but all of them werepermanently sealed. How did the Hassassin get in? Langdon pushed on. He passedtwo modern entrances, but they were padlocked from the outside. Not here. Hekept running.Langdon had circled almost the entire building when he saw a gravel drivecutting across the courtyard in front of him. At one end, on the outer wall ofthe castle, he saw the back of the gated drawbridge leading back outside. At theother end, the drive disappeared into the fortress. The drive seemed to enter akind of tunnel-a gaping entry in the central core. Il traforo! Langdon had readabout this castle’s traforo, a giant spiral ramp that circled up inside thefort, used by commanders on horseback to ride from top to bottom rapidly. TheHassassin drove up! The gate blocking the tunnel was raised, ushering Langdonin. He felt almost exuberant as he ran toward the tunnel. But as he reached theopening, his excitement disappeared.The tunnel spiraled down.The wrong way. This section of the traforo apparently descended to the dungeons,not to the top.Standing at the mouth of a dark bore that seemed to twist endlessly deeper intothe earth, Langdon hesitated, looking up again at the balcony. He could swear hesaw motion up there. Decide! With no other options, he dashed down into thetunnel.High overhead, the Hassassin stood over his prey. He ran a hand across her arm.Her skin was like cream. The anticipation of exploring her bodily treasures wasinebriating. How many ways could he violate her?The Hassassin knew he deserved this woman. He had served Janus well. She was aspoil of war, and when he was finished with her, he would pull her from thedivan and force her to her knees. She would service him again. The ultimatesubmission. Then, at the moment of his own climax, he would slit her throat.Ghayat assa’adah, they called it. The ultimate pleasure.Afterward, basking in his glory, he would stand on the balcony and savor theculmination of the Illuminati triumph… a revenge desired by so many for so long.The tunnel grew darker. Langdon descended.After one complete turn into the earth, the light was all but gone. The tunnelleveled out, and Langdon slowed, sensing by the echo of his footfalls that hehad just entered a larger chamber. Before him in the murkiness, he thought hesaw glimmers of light… fuzzy reflections in the ambient gleam. He moved forward,reaching out his hand. He found smooth surfaces. Chrome and glass. It was avehicle. He groped the surface, found a door, and opened it.The vehicle’s interior dome-light flashed on. He stepped back and recognized theblack van immediately. Feeling a surge of loathing, he stared a moment, then hedove in, rooting around in hopes of finding a weapon to replace the one he’dlost in the fountain. He found none. He did, however, find Vittoria’s cellphone. It was shattered and useless. The sight of it filled Langdon with fear.He prayed he was not too late.He reached up and turned on the van’s headlights. The room around him blazedinto existence, harsh shadows in a simple chamber. Langdon guessed the room wasonce used for horses and ammunition. It was also a dead end.No exit. I came the wrong way!At the end of his rope, Langdon jumped from the van and scanned the walls aroundhim. No doorways. No gates. He thought of the angel over the tunnel entrance andwondered if it had been a coincidence. No! He thought of the killer’s words atthe fountain. She is in the Church of Illumination… awaiting my return. Langdonhad come too far to fail now. His heart was pounding. Frustration and hatredwere starting to cripple his senses.When he saw the blood on the floor, Langdon’s first thought was for Vittoria.But as his eyes followed the stains, he realized they were bloody footprints.The strides were long. The splotches of blood were only on the left foot. TheHassassin!Langdon followed the footprints toward the corner of the room, his sprawlingshadow growing fainter. He felt more and more puzzled with every step. Thebloody prints looked as though they walked directly into the corner of the roomand then disappeared.When Langdon arrived in the corner, he could not believe his eyes. The graniteblock in the floor here was not a square like the others. He was looking atanother signpost. The block was carved into a perfect pentagram, arranged withthe tip pointing into the corner. Ingeniously concealed by overlapping walls, anarrow slit in the stone served as an exit. Langdon slid through. He was in apassage. In front of him were the remains of a wooden barrier that had once beenblocking this tunnel.Beyond it there was light.Langdon was running now. He clambered over the wood and headed for the light.The passage quickly opened into another, larger chamber. Here a single torchflickered on the wall. Langdon was in a section of the castle that had noelectricity… a section no tourists would ever see. The room would have beenfrightful in daylight, but the torch made it even more gruesome.Il prigione.There were a dozen tiny jail cells, the iron bars on most eroded away. One ofthe larger cells, however, remained intact, and on the floor Langdon sawsomething that almost stopped his heart. Black robes and red sashes on thefloor. This is where he held the cardinals!Near the cell was an iron doorway in the wall. The door was ajar and beyond itLangdon could see some sort of passage. He ran toward it. But Langdon stoppedbefore he got there. The trail of blood did not enter the passage. When Langdonsaw the words carved over the archway, he knew why.Il Passetto.He was stunned. He had heard of this tunnel many times, never knowing whereexactly the entrance was. Il Passetto-The Little Passage-was a slender,three-quarter-mile tunnel built between Castle St. Angelo and the Vatican. Ithad been used by various Popes to escape to safety during sieges of the Vatican…as well as by a few less pious Popes to secretly visit mistresses or oversee thetorture of their enemies. Nowadays both ends of the tunnel were supposedlysealed with impenetrable locks whose keys were kept in some Vatican vault.Langdon suddenly feared he knew how the Illuminati had been moving in and out ofthe Vatican. He found himself wondering who on the inside had betrayed thechurch and coughed up the keys. Olivetti? One of the Swiss Guard? None of itmattered anymore.The blood on the floor led to the opposite end of the prison. Langdon followed.Here, a rusty gate hung draped with chains. The lock had been removed and thegate stood ajar. Beyond the gate was a steep ascension of spiral stairs. Thefloor here was also marked with a pentagramal block. Langdon stared at theblock, trembling, wondering if Bernini himself had held the chisel that hadshaped these chunks. Overhead, the archway was adorned with a tiny carvedcherub. This was it.The trail of blood curved up the stairs.Before ascending, Langdon knew he needed a weapon, any weapon. He found afour-foot section of iron bar near one of the cells. It had a sharp, splinteredend. Although absurdly heavy, it was the best he could do. He hoped the elementof surprise, combined with the Hassassin’s wound, would be enough to tip thescales in his advantage. Most of all, though, he hoped he was not too late.The staircase’s spiral treads were worn and twisted steeply upward. Langdonascended, listening for sounds. None. As he climbed, the light from the prisonarea faded away. He ascended into the total darkness, keeping one hand on thewall. Higher. In the blackness, Langdon sensed the ghost of Galileo, climbingthese very stairs, eager to share his visions of heaven with other men ofscience and faith.Langdon was still in a state of shock over the location of the lair. TheIlluminati meeting hall was in a building owned by the Vatican. No doubt whilethe Vatican guards were out searching basements and homes of well-knownscientists, the Illuminati were meeting here… right under the Vatican’s nose. Itsuddenly seemed so perfect. Bernini, as head architect of renovations here,would have had unlimited access to this structure… remodeling it to his ownspecifications with no questions asked. How many secret entries had Berniniadded? How many subtle embellishments pointing the way?The Church of Illumination. Langdon knew he was close.As the stairs began narrowing, Langdon felt the passage closing around him. Theshadows of history were whispering in the dark, but he moved on. When he saw thehorizontal shaft of light before him, he realized he was standing a few stepsbeneath a landing, where the glow of torchlight spilled out beneath thethreshold of a door in front of him. Silently he moved up.Langdon had no idea where in the castle he was right now, but he knew he hadclimbed far enough to be near the peak. He pictured the mammoth angel atop thecastle and suspected it was directly overhead.Watch over me, angel, he thought, gripping the bar. Then, silently, he reachedfor the door.On the divan, Vittoria’s arms ached. When she had first awoken to find them tiedbehind her back, she’d thought she might be able to relax and work her handsfree. But time had run out. The beast had returned. Now he was standing overher, his chest bare and powerful, scarred from battles he had endured. His eyeslooked like two black slits as he stared down at her body. Vittoria sensed hewas imagining the deeds he was about to perform. Slowly, as if to taunt her, theHassassin removed his soaking belt and dropped it on the floor.Vittoria felt a loathing horror. She closed her eyes. When she opened themagain, the Hassassin had produced a switchblade knife. He snapped it opendirectly in front of her face.Vittoria saw her own terrified reflection in the steel.The Hassassin turned the blade over and ran the back of it across her belly. Theicy metal gave her chills. With a contemptuous stare, he slipped the blade belowthe waistline of her shorts. She inhaled. He moved back and forth, slowly,dangerously… lower. Then he leaned forward, his hot breath whispering in herear.“This blade cut out your father’s eye.”Vittoria knew in that instant that she was capable of killing.The Hassassin turned the blade again and began sawing upward through the fabricof her khaki shorts. Suddenly, he stopped, looking up. Someone was in the room.“Get away from her,” a deep voice growled from the doorway.Vittoria could not see who had spoken, but she recognized the voice. Robert!He’s alive!The Hassassin looked as if he had seen a ghost. “Mr. Langdon, you must have aguardian angel.”"},{"pageContent":"108In the split second it took Langdon to take in his surroundings, he realized hewas in a sacred place. The embellishments in the oblong room, though old andfaded, were replete with familiar symbology. Pentagram tiles. Planet frescoes.Doves. Pyramids.The Church of Illumination. Simple and pure. He had arrived.Directly in front of him, framed in the opening of the balcony, stood theHassassin. He was bare chested, standing over Vittoria, who lay bound but verymuch alive. Langdon felt a wave of relief to see her. For an instant, their eyesmet, and a torrent of emotions flowed-gratitude, desperation, and regret.“So we meet yet again,” the Hassassin said. He looked at the bar in Langdon’shand and laughed out loud. “And this time you come for me with that?”“Untie her.”The Hassassin put the knife to Vittoria’s throat. “I will kill her.”Langdon had no doubt the Hassassin was capable of such an act. He forced a calminto his voice. “I imagine she would welcome it… considering the alternative.”The Hassassin smiled at the insult. “You’re right. She has much to offer. Itwould be a waste.”Langdon stepped forward, grasping the rusted bar, and aimed the splintered enddirectly at the Hassassin. The cut on his hand bit sharply. “Let her go.”The Hassassin seemed for a moment to be considering it. Exhaling, he dropped hisshoulders. It was a clear motion of surrender, and yet at that exact instant theHassassin’s arm seemed to accelerate unexpectedly. There was a blur of darkmuscle, and a blade suddenly came tearing through the air toward Langdon’schest.Whether it was instinct or exhaustion that buckled Langdon’s knees at thatmoment, he didn’t know, but the knife sailed past his left ear and clattered tothe floor behind him. The Hassassin seemed unfazed. He smiled at Langdon, whowas kneeling now, holding the metal bar. The killer stepped away from Vittoriaand moved toward Langdon like a stalking lion.As Langdon scrambled to his feet, lifting the bar again, his wet turtleneck andpants felt suddenly more restrictive. The Hassassin, half-clothed, seemed tomove much faster, the wound on his foot apparently not slowing him at all.Langdon sensed this was a man accustomed to pain. For the first time in hislife, Langdon wished he were holding a very big gun.The Hassassin circled slowly, as if enjoying himself, always just out of reach,moving toward the knife on the floor. Langdon cut him off. Then the killer movedback toward Vittoria. Again Langdon cut him off.“There’s still time,” Langdon ventured. “Tell me where the canister is. TheVatican will pay more than the Illuminati ever could.”“You are naпve.”Langdon jabbed with the bar. The Hassassin dodged. He navigated around a bench,holding the weapon in front of him, trying to corner the Hassassin in the ovalroom. This damn room has no corners! Oddly, the Hassassin did not seeminterested in attacking or fleeing. He was simply playing Langdon’s game. Coollywaiting.Waiting for what? The killer kept circling, a master at positioning himself. Itwas like an endless game of chess. The weapon in Langdon’s hand was gettingheavy, and he suddenly sensed he knew what the Hassassin was waiting for. He’stiring me out. It was working, too. Langdon was hit by a surge of weariness, theadrenaline alone no longer enough to keep him alert. He knew he had to make amove.The Hassassin seemed to read Langdon’s mind, shifting again, as if intentionallyleading Langdon toward a table in the middle of the room. Langdon could tellthere was something on the table. Something glinted in the torchlight. A weapon?Langdon kept his eyes focused on the Hassassin and maneuvered himself closer tothe table. When the Hassassin cast a long, guileless glance at the table,Langdon tried to fight the obvious bait. But instinct overruled. He stole aglance. The damage was done.It was not a weapon at all. The sight momentarily riveted him.On the table lay a rudimentary copper chest, crusted with ancient patina. Thechest was a pentagon. The lid lay open. Arranged inside in five paddedcompartments were five brands. The brands were forged of iron-large embossingtools with stout handles of wood. Langdon had no doubt what they said.ILLUMINATI, EARTH, AIR, FIRE, WATER.Langdon snapped his head back up, fearing the Hassassin would lunge. He did not.The killer was waiting, almost as if he were refreshed by the game. Langdonfought to recover his focus, locking eyes again with his quarry, thrusting withthe pipe. But the image of the box hung in his mind. Although the brandsthemselves were mesmerizing-artifacts few Illuminati scholars even believedexisted-Langdon suddenly realized there had been something else about the boxthat had ignited a wave of foreboding within. As the Hassassin maneuvered again,Langdon stole another glance downward.My God!In the chest, the five brands sat in compartments around the outer edge. But inthe center, there was another compartment. This partition was empty, but itclearly was intended to hold another brand… a brand much larger than the others,and perfectly square.The attack was a blur.The Hassassin swooped toward him like a bird of prey. Langdon, his concentrationhaving been masterfully diverted, tried to counter, but the pipe felt like atree trunk in his hands. His parry was too slow. The Hassassin dodged. AsLangdon tried to retract the bar, the Hassassin’s hands shot out and grabbed it.The man’s grip was strong, his injured arm seeming no longer to affect him.Violently, the two men struggled. Langdon felt the bar ripped away, and asearing pain shot through his palm. An instant later, Langdon was staring intothe splintered point of the weapon. The hunter had become the hunted.Langdon felt like he’d been hit by a cyclone. The Hassassin circled, smilingnow, backing Langdon against the wall. “What is your American adаgio?” hechided. “Something about curiosity and the cat?”Langdon could barely focus. He cursed his carelessness as the Hassassin movedin. Nothing was making sense. A sixth Illuminati brand? In frustration heblurted, “I’ve never read anything about a sixth Illuminati brand!”“I think you probably have.” The killer chuckled as he herded Langdon around theoval wall.Langdon was lost. He most certainly had not. There were five Illuminati brands.He backed up, searching the room for any weapon at all.“A perfect union of the ancient elements,” the Hassassin said. “The final brandis the most brilliant of all. I’m afraid you will never see it, though.”Langdon sensed he would not be seeing much of anything in a moment. He keptbacking up, searching the room for an option. “And you’ve seen this finalbrand?” Langdon demanded, trying to buy time.“Someday perhaps they will honor me. As I prove myself.” He jabbed at Langdon,as if enjoying a game.Langdon slid backward again. He had the feeling the Hassassin was directing himaround the wall toward some unseen destination. Where? Langdon could not affordto look behind him. “The brand?” he demanded. “Where is it?”“Not here. Janus is apparently the only one who holds it.”“Janus?” Langdon did not recognize the name.“The Illuminati leader. He is arriving shortly.”“The Illuminati leader is coming here?”“To perform the final branding.”Langdon shot a frightened glance to Vittoria. She looked strangely calm, hereyes closed to the world around her, her lungs pulling slowly… deeply. Was shethe final victim? Was he?“Such conceit,” the Hassassin sneered, watching Langdon’s eyes. “The two of youare nothing. You will die, of course, that is for certain. But the final victimof whom I speak is a truly dangerous enemy.”Langdon tried to make sense of the Hassassin’s words. A dangerous enemy? The topcardinals were all dead. The Pope was dead. The Illuminati had wiped them allout. Langdon found the answer in the vacuum of the Hassassin’s eyes.The camerlegno.Camerlegno Ventresca was the one man who had been a beacon of hope for the worldthrough this entire tribulation. The camerlegno had done more to condemn theIlluminati tonight than decades of conspiracy theorists. Apparently he would paythe price. He was the Illuminati’s final target.“You’ll never get to him,” Langdon challenged.“Not I,” the Hassassin replied, forcing Langdon farther back around the wall.“That honor is reserved for Janus himself.”“The Illuminati leader himself intends to brand the camerlegno?”“Power has its privileges.”“But no one could possibly get into Vatican City right now!”The Hassassin looked smug. “Not unless he had an appointment.”Langdon was confused. The only person expected at the Vatican right now was theperson the press was calling the 11th Hour Samaritan-the person Rocher said hadinformation that could save-Langdon stopped short. Good God!The Hassassin smirked, clearly enjoying Langdon’s sickening cognition. “I toowondered how Janus would gain entrance. Then in the van I heard the radio-areport about an 11th hour Samaritan.” He smiled. “The Vatican will welcome Januswith open arms.”Langdon almost stumbled backward. Janus is the Samaritan! It was an unthinkabledeception. The Illuminati leader would get a royal escort directly to thecamerlegno’s chambers. But how did Janus fool Rocher? Or was Rocher somehowinvolved? Langdon felt a chill. Ever since he had almost suffocated in thesecret archives, Langdon had not entirely trusted Rocher.The Hassassin jabbed suddenly, nicking Langdon in the side.Langdon jumped back, his temper flaring. “Janus will never get out alive!”The Hassassin shrugged. “Some causes are worth dying for.”Langdon sensed the killer was serious. Janus coming to Vatican City on a suicidemission? A question of honor? For an instant, Langdon’s mind took in the entireterrifying cycle. The Illuminati plot had come full circle. The priest whom theIlluminati had inadvertently brought to power by killing the Pope had emerged asa worthy adversary. In a final act of defiance, the Illuminati leader woulddestroy him.Suddenly, Langdon felt the wall behind him disappear. There was a rush of coolair, and he staggered backward into the night. The balcony! He now realized whatthe Hassassin had in mind.Langdon immediately sensed the precipice behind him-a hundred-foot drop to thecourtyard below. He had seen it on his way in. The Hassassin wasted no time.With a violent surge, he lunged. The spear sliced toward Langdon’s midsection.Langdon skidded back, and the point came up short, catching only his shirt.Again the point came at him. Langdon slid farther back, feeling the banisterright behind him. Certain the next jab would kill him, Langdon attempted theabsurd. Spinning to one side, he reached out and grabbed the shaft, sending ajolt of pain through his palm. Langdon held on.The Hassassin seemed unfazed. They strained for a moment against one another,face to face, the Hassassin’s breath fetid in Langdon’s nostrils. The bar beganto slip. The Hassassin was too strong. In a final act of desperation, Langdonstretched out his leg, dangerously off balance as he tried to ram his foot downon the Hassassin’s injured toe. But the man was a professional and adjusted toprotect his weakness.Langdon had just played his final card. And he knew he had lost the hand.The Hassassin’s arms exploded upward, driving Langdon back against the railing.Langdon sensed nothing but empty space behind him as the railing hit justbeneath his buttocks. The Hassassin held the bar crosswise and drove it intoLangdon’s chest. Langdon’s back arched over the chasm.“Ma’assalamah,” the Hassassin sneered. “Good-bye.”With a merciless glare, the Hassassin gave a final shove. Langdon’s center ofgravity shifted, and his feet swung up off the floor. With only one hope ofsurvival, Langdon grabbed on to the railing as he went over. His left handslipped, but his right hand held on. He ended up hanging upside down by his legsand one hand… straining to hold on.Looming over him, the Hassassin raised the bar overhead, preparing to bring itcrashing down. As the bar began to accelerate, Langdon saw a vision. Perhaps itwas the imminence of death or simply blind fear, but in that moment, he sensed asudden aura surrounding the Hassassin. A glowing effulgence seemed to swell outof nothing behind him… like an incoming fireball.Halfway through his swing, the Hassassin dropped the bar and screamed in agony.The iron bar clattered past Langdon out into the night. The Hassassin spun awayfrom him, and Langdon saw a blistering torch burn on the killer’s back. Langdonpulled himself up to see Vittoria, eyes flaring, now facing the Hassassin.Vittoria waved a torch in front of her, the vengeance in her face resplendent inthe flames. How she had escaped, Langdon did not know or care. He beganscrambling back up over the banister.The battle would be short. The Hassassin was a deadly match. Screaming withrage, the killer lunged for her. She tried to dodge, but the man was on her,holding the torch and about to wrestle it away. Langdon did not wait. Leapingoff the banister, Langdon jabbed his clenched fist into the blistered burn onthe Hassassin’s back.The scream seemed to echo all the way to the Vatican.The Hassassin froze a moment, his back arched in anguish. He let go of thetorch, and Vittoria thrust it hard into his face. There was a hiss of flesh ashis left eye sizzled. He screamed again, raising his hands to his face.“Eye for an eye,” Vittoria hissed. This time she swung the torch like a bat, andwhen it connected, the Hassassin stumbled back against the railing. Langdon andVittoria went for him at the same instant, both heaving and pushing. TheHassassin’s body sailed backward over the banister into the night. There was noscream. The only sound was the crack of his spine as he landed spread-eagle on apile of cannonballs far below.Langdon turned and stared at Vittoria in bewilderment. Slackened ropes hung offher midsection and shoulders. Her eyes blazed like an inferno.“Houdini knew yoga.”"},{"pageContent":"109Meanwhile, in St. Peter’s Square, the wall of Swiss Guards yelled orders andfanned outward, trying to push the crowds back to a safer distance. It was nouse. The crowd was too dense and seemed far more interested in the Vatican’simpending doom than in their own safety. The towering media screens in thesquare were now transmitting a live countdown of the antimatter canister-adirect feed from the Swiss Guard security monitor-compliments of the camerlegno.Unfortunately, the image of the canister counting down was doing nothing torepel the crowds. The people in the square apparently looked at the tiny dropletof liquid suspended in the canister and decided it was not as menacing as theyhad thought. They could also see the countdown clock now-a little underforty-five minutes until detonation. Plenty of time to stay and watch.Nonetheless, the Swiss Guards unanimously agreed that the camerlegno’s bolddecision to address the world with the truth and then provide the media withactual visuals of Illuminati treachery had been a savvy maneuver. The Illuminatihad no doubt expected the Vatican to be their usual reticent selves in the faceof adversity. Not tonight. Camerlegno Carlo Ventresca had proven himself acommanding foe.Inside the Sistine Chapel, Cardinal Mortati was getting restless. It was past11:15 P.M. Many of the cardinals were continuing to pray, but others hadclustered around the exit, clearly unsettled by the hour. Some of the cardinalsbegan pounding on the door with their fists.Outside the door Lieutenant Chartrand heard the pounding and didn’t know what todo. He checked his watch. It was time. Captain Rocher had given strict ordersthat the cardinals were not to be let out until he gave the word. The poundingon the door became more intense, and Chartrand felt uneasy. He wondered if thecaptain had simply forgotten. The captain had been acting very erratic since hismysterious phone call.Chartrand pulled out his walkie-talkie. “Captain? Chartrand here. It is pasttime. Should I open the Sistine?”“That door stays shut. I believe I already gave you that order.”“Yes, sir, I just-”“Our guest is arriving shortly. Take a few men upstairs, and guard the door ofthe Pope’s office. The camerlegno is not to go anywhere.”“I’m sorry, sir?”“What is it that you don’t understand, Lieutenant?”“Nothing, sir. I am on my way.”Upstairs in the Office of the Pope, the camerlegno stared in quiet meditation atthe fire. Give me strength, God. Bring us a miracle. He poked at the coals,wondering if he would survive the night."},{"pageContent":"110Eleven-twenty-three P.M.Vittoria stood trembling on the balcony of Castle St. Angelo, staring out acrossRome, her eyes moist with tears. She wanted badly to embrace Robert Langdon, butshe could not. Her body felt anesthetized. Readjusting. Taking stock. The manwho had killed her father lay far below, dead, and she had almost been a victimas well.When Langdon’s hand touched her shoulder, the infusion of warmth seemed tomagically shatter the ice. Her body shuddered back to life. The fog lifted, andshe turned. Robert looked like hell-wet and matted-he had obviously been throughpurgatory to come rescue her.“Thank you…” she whispered.Langdon gave an exhausted smile and reminded her that it was she who deservedthanks-her ability to practically dislocate her shoulders had just saved themboth. Vittoria wiped her eyes. She could have stood there forever with him, butthe reprieve was short-lived.“We need to get out of here,” Langdon said.Vittoria’s mind was elsewhere. She was staring out toward the Vatican. Theworld’s smallest country looked unsettlingly close, glowing white under abarrage of media lights. To her shock, much of St. Peter’s Square was stillpacked with people! The Swiss Guard had apparently been able to clear only abouta hundred and fifty feet back-the area directly in front of the basilica-lessthan one-third of the square. The shell of congestion encompassing the squarewas compacted now, those at the safer distances pressing for a closer look,trapping the others inside. They are too close! Vittoria thought. Much tooclose!“I’m going back in,” Langdon said flatly.Vittoria turned, incredulous. “Into the Vatican?”Langdon told her about the Samaritan, and how it was a ploy. The Illuminatileader, a man named Janus, was actually coming himself to brand the camerlegno.A final Illuminati act of domination.“Nobody in Vatican City knows,” Langdon said. “I have no way to contact them,and this guy is arriving any minute. I have to warn the guards before they lethim in.”“But you’ll never get through the crowd!”Langdon’s voice was confident. “There’s a way. Trust me.”Vittoria sensed once again that the historian knew something she did not. “I’mcoming.”“No. Why risk both-”“I have to find a way to get those people out of there! They’re in incredibledange-”Just then, the balcony they were standing on began to shake. A deafening rumbleshook the whole castle. Then a white light from the direction of St. Peter’sblinded them. Vittoria had only one thought. Oh my God! The antimatterannihilated early!But instead of an explosion, a huge cheer went up from the crowd. Vittoriasquinted into the light. It was a barrage of media lights from the square, nowtrained, it seemed, on them! Everyone was turned their way, hollering andpointing. The rumble grew louder. The air in the square seemed suddenly joyous.Langdon looked baffled. “What the devil-”The sky overhead roared.Emerging from behind the tower, without warning, came the papal helicopter. Itthundered fifty feet above them, on a beeline for Vatican City. As it passedoverhead, radiant in the media lights, the castle trembled. The lights followedthe helicopter as it passed by, and Langdon and Vittoria were suddenly again inthe dark.Vittoria had the uneasy feeling they were too late as they watched the mammothmachine slow to a stop over St. Peter’s Square. Kicking up a cloud of dust, thechopper dropped onto the open portion of the square between the crowd and thebasilica, touching down at the bottom of the basilica’s staircase.“Talk about an entrance,” Vittoria said. Against the white marble, she could seea tiny speck of a person emerge from the Vatican and move toward the chopper.She would never have recognized the figure except for the bright red beret onhis head. “Red carpet greeting. That’s Rocher.”Langdon pounded his fist on the banister. “Somebody’s got to warn them!” Heturned to go.Vittoria caught his arm. “Wait!” She had just seen something else, something hereyes refused to believe. Fingers trembling, she pointed toward the chopper. Evenfrom this distance, there was no mistaking. Descending the gangplank was anotherfigure… a figure who moved so uniquely that it could only be one man. Althoughthe figure was seated, he accelerated across the open square with effortlesscontrol and startling speed.A king on an electric throne.It was Maximilian Kohler."},{"pageContent":"111Kohler was sickened by the opulence of the Hallway of the Belvedere. The goldleaf in the ceiling alone probably could have funded a year’s worth of cancerresearch. Rocher led Kohler up a handicapped ramp on a circuitous route into theApostolic Palace.“No elevator?” Kohler demanded.“No power.” Rocher motioned to the candles burning around them in the darkenedbuilding. “Part of our search tactic.”“Tactics which no doubt failed.”Rocher nodded.Kohler broke into another coughing fit and knew it might be one of his last. Itwas not an entirely unwelcome thought.When they reached the top floor and started down the hallway toward the Pope’soffice, four Swiss Guards ran toward them, looking troubled. “Captain, what areyou doing up here? I thought this man had information that-”“He will only speak to the camerlegno.”The guards recoiled, looking suspicious.“Tell the camerlegno,” Rocher said forcefully, “that the director of CERN,Maximilian Kohler, is here to see him. Immediately.”“Yes, sir!” One of the guards ran off in the direction of the camerlegno’soffice. The others stood their ground. They studied Rocher, looking uneasy.“Just one moment, captain. We will announce your guest.”Kohler, however, did not stop. He turned sharply and maneuvered his chair aroundthe sentinels.The guards spun and broke into a jog beside him. “Fermati! Sir! Stop!”Kohler felt repugnance for them. Not even the most elite security force in theworld was immune to the pity everyone felt for cripples. Had Kohler been ahealthy man, the guards would have tackled him. Cripples are powerless, Kohlerthought. Or so the world believes.Kohler knew he had very little time to accomplish what he had come for. He alsoknew he might die here tonight. He was surprised how little he cared. Death wasa price he was ready to pay. He had endured too much in his life to have hiswork destroyed by someone like Camerlegno Ventresca.“Signore!” the guards shouted, running ahead and forming a line across thehallway. “You must stop!” One of them pulled a sidearm and aimed it at Kohler.Kohler stopped.Rocher stepped in, looking contrite. “Mr. Kohler, please. It will only be amoment. No one enters the Office of the Pope unannounced.”Kohler could see in Rocher’s eyes that he had no choice but to wait. Fine,Kohler thought. We wait.The guards, cruelly it seemed, had stopped Kohler next to a full-length gildedmirror. The sight of his own twisted form repulsed Kohler. The ancient ragebrimmed yet again to the surface. It empowered him. He was among the enemy now.These were the people who had robbed him of his dignity. These were the people.Because of them he had never felt the touch of a woman… had never stood tall toaccept an award. What truth do these people possess? What proof, damn it! A bookof ancient fables? Promises of miracles to come? Science creates miracles everyday!Kohler stared a moment into his own stony eyes. Tonight I may die at the handsof religion, he thought. But it will not be the first time.For a moment, he was eleven years old again, lying in his bed in his parents’Frankfurt mansion. The sheets beneath him were Europe’s finest linen, but theywere soaked with sweat. Young Max felt like he was on fire, the pain wrackinghis body unimaginable. Kneeling beside his bed, where they had been for twodays, were his mother and father. They were praying.In the shadows stood three of Frankfurt’s best doctors.“I urge you to reconsider!” one of the doctors said. “Look at the boy! His feveris increasing. He is in terrible pain. And danger!”But Max knew his mother’s reply before she even said it. “Gott wird ihnbeschuetzen.”Yes, Max thought. God will protect me. The conviction in his mother’s voice gavehim strength. God will protect me.An hour later, Max felt like his whole body was being crushed beneath a car. Hecould not even breathe to cry.“Your son is in great suffering,” another doctor said. “Let me at least ease hispain. I have in my bag a simple injection of-”“Ruhe, bitte!” Max’s father silenced the doctor without ever opening his eyes.He simply kept praying.“Father, please!” Max wanted to scream. “Let them stop the pain!” But his wordswere lost in a spasm of coughing.An hour later, the pain had worsened.“Your son could become paralyzed,” one of the doctors scolded. “Or even die! Wehave medicines that will help!”Frau and Herr Kohler would not allow it. They did not believe in medicine. Whowere they to interfere with God’s master plan? They prayed harder. After all,God had blessed them with this boy, why would God take the child away? Hismother whispered to Max to be strong. She explained that God was testing him…like the Bible story of Abraham… a test of his faith.Max tried to have faith, but the pain was excruciating.“I cannot watch this!” one of the doctors finally said, running from the room.By dawn, Max was barely conscious. Every muscle in his body spasmed in agony.Where is Jesus? he wondered. Doesn’t he love me? Max felt the life slipping fromhis body.His mother had fallen asleep at the bedside, her hands still clasped over him.Max’s father stood across the room at the window staring out at the dawn. Heseemed to be in a trance. Max could hear the low mumble of his ceaseless prayersfor mercy.It was then that Max sensed the figure hovering over him. An angel? Max couldbarely see. His eyes were swollen shut. The figure whispered in his ear, but itwas not the voice of an angel. Max recognized it as one of the doctors… the onewho had sat in the corner for two days, never leaving, begging Max’s parents tolet him administer some new drug from England.“I will never forgive myself,” the doctor whispered, “if I do not do this.” Thenthe doctor gently took Max’s frail arm. “I wish I had done it sooner.”Max felt a tiny prick in his arm-barely discernible through the pain.Then the doctor quietly packed his things. Before he left, he put a hand onMax’s forehead. “This will save your life. I have great faith in the power ofmedicine.”Within minutes, Max felt as if some sort of magic spirit were flowing throughhis veins. The warmth spread through his body numbing his pain. Finally, for thefirst time in days, Max slept.When the fever broke, his mother and father proclaimed a miracle of God. Butwhen it became evident that their son was crippled, they became despondent. Theywheeled their son into the church and begged the priest for counseling.“It was only by the grace of God,” the priest told them, “that this boysurvived.”Max listened, saying nothing.“But our son cannot walk!” Frau Kohler was weeping.The priest nodded sadly. “Yes. It seems God has punished him for not havingenough faith.”“Mr. Kohler?” It was the Swiss Guard who had run ahead. “The camerlegno says hewill grant you audience.”Kohler grunted, accelerating again down the hall.“He is surprised by your visit,” the guard said.“I’m sure.” Kohler rolled on. “I would like to see him alone.”“Impossible,” the guard said. “No one-”“Lieutenant,” Rocher barked. “The meeting will be as Mr. Kohler wishes.”The guard stared in obvious disbelief.Outside the door to the Pope’s office, Rocher allowed his guards to takestandard precautions before letting Kohler in. Their handheld metal detector wasrendered worthless by the myriad of electronic devices on Kohler’s wheelchair.The guards frisked him but were obviously too ashamed of his disability to do itproperly. They never found the revolver affixed beneath his chair. Nor did theyrelieve him of the other object… the one that Kohler knew would bringunforgettable closure to this evening’s chain of events.When Kohler entered the Pope’s office, Camerlegno Ventresca was alone, kneelingin prayer beside a dying fire. He did not open his eyes.“Mr. Kohler,” the camerlegno said. “Have you come to make me a martyr?”"},{"pageContent":"112All the while, the narrow tunnel called Il Passetto stretched out before Langdonand Vittoria as they dashed toward Vatican City. The torch in Langdon’s handthrew only enough light to see a few yards ahead. The walls were close on eitherside, and the ceiling low. The air smelled dank. Langdon raced on into thedarkness with Vittoria close at his heels.The tunnel inclined steeply as it left the Castle St. Angelo, proceeding upwardinto the underside of a stone bastion that looked like a Roman aqueduct. There,the tunnel leveled out and began its secret course toward Vatican City.As Langdon ran, his thoughts turned over and over in a kaleidoscope ofconfounding images-Kohler, Janus, the Hassassin, Rocher… a sixth brand? I’m sureyou’ve heard about the sixth brand, the killer had said. The most brilliant ofall. Langdon was quite certain he had not. Even in conspiracy theory lore,Langdon could think of no references to any sixth brand. Real or imagined. Therewere rumors of a gold bullion and a flawless Illuminati Diamond but never anymention of a sixth brand.“Kohler can’t be Janus!” Vittoria declared as they ran down the interior of thedike. “It’s impossible!”Impossible was one word Langdon had stopped using tonight. “I don’t know,”Langdon yelled as they ran. “Kohler has a serious grudge, and he also has someserious influence.”“This crisis has made CERN look like monsters! Max would never do anything todamage CERN’s reputation!”On one count, Langdon knew CERN had taken a public beating tonight, all becauseof the Illuminati’s insistence on making this a public spectacle. And yet, hewondered how much CERN had really been damaged. Criticism from the church wasnothing new for CERN. In fact, the more Langdon thought about it, the more hewondered if this crisis might actually benefit CERN. If publicity were the game,then antimatter was the jackpot winner tonight. The entire planet was talkingabout it.“You know what promoter P. T. Barnum said,” Langdon called over his shoulder. “‘I don’t care what you say about me, just spell my name right!’ I bet people arealready secretly lining up to license antimatter technology. And after they seeits true power at midnight tonight…”“Illogical,” Vittoria said. “Publicizing scientific breakthroughs is not aboutshowing destructive power! This is terrible for antimatter, trust me!”Langdon’s torch was fading now. “Then maybe it’s all much simpler than that.Maybe Kohler gambled that the Vatican would keep the antimatter asecret-refusing to empower the Illuminati by confirming the weapon’s existence.Kohler expected the Vatican to be their usual tight-lipped selves about thethreat, but the camerlegno changed the rules.”Vittoria was silent as they dashed down the tunnel.Suddenly the scenario was making more sense to Langdon. “Yes! Kohler nevercounted on the camerlegno’s reaction. The camerlegno broke the Vatican traditionof secrecy and went public about the crisis. He was dead honest. He put theantimatter on TV, for God’s sake. It was a brilliant response, and Kohler neverexpected it. And the irony of the whole thing is that the Illuminati attackbackfired. It inadvertently produced a new church leader in the camerlegno. Andnow Kohler is coming to kill him!”“Max is a bastard,” Vittoria declared, “but he is not a murderer. And he wouldnever have been involved in my father’s assassination.”In Langdon’s mind, it was Kohler’s voice that answered. Leonardo was considereddangerous by many purists at CERN.Fusing science and God is the ultimatescientific blasphemy. “Maybe Kohler found out about the antimatter project weeksago and didn’t like the religious implications.”“So he killed my father over it? Ridiculous! Besides, Max Kohler would neverhave known the project existed.”“While you were gone, maybe your father broke down and consulted Kohler, askingfor guidance. You yourself said your father was concerned about the moralimplications of creating such a deadly substance.”“Asking moral guidance from Maximilian Kohler?” Vittoria snorted. “I don’t thinkso!”The tunnel banked slightly westward. The faster they ran, the dimmer Langdon’storch became. He began to fear what the place would look like if the light wentout. Black.“Besides,” Vittoria argued, “why would Kohler have bothered to call you in thismorning and ask for help if he is behind the whole thing?”Langdon had already considered it. “By calling me, Kohler covered his bases. Hemade sure no one would accuse him of nonaction in the face of crisis. Heprobably never expected us to get this far.”The thought of being used by Kohler incensed Langdon. Langdon’s involvement hadgiven the Illuminati a level of credibility. His credentials and publicationshad been quoted all night by the media, and as ridiculous as it was, thepresence of a Harvard professor in Vatican City had somehow raised the wholeemergency beyond the scope of paranoid delusion and convinced skeptics aroundthe world that the Illuminati brotherhood was not only a historical fact, but aforce to be reckoned with.“That BBC reporter,” Langdon said, “thinks CERN is the new Illuminati lair.”“What!” Vittoria stumbled behind him. She pulled herself up and ran on. “He saidthat!?”“On air. He likened CERN to the Masonic lodges-an innocent organizationunknowingly harboring the Illuminati brotherhood within.”“My God, this is going to destroy CERN.”Langdon was not so sure. Either way, the theory suddenly seemed lessfar-fetched. CERN was the ultimate scientific haven. It was home to scientistsfrom over a dozen countries. They seemed to have endless private funding. AndMaximilian Kohler was their director.Kohler is Janus.“If Kohler’s not involved,” Langdon challenged, “then what is he doing here?”“Probably trying to stop this madness. Show support. Maybe he really is actingas the Samaritan! He could have found out who knew about the antimatter projectand has come to share information.”“The killer said he was coming to brand the camerlegno.”“Listen to yourself! It would be a suicide mission. Max would never get outalive.”Langdon considered it. Maybe that was the point.The outline of a steel gate loomed ahead, blocking their progress down thetunnel. Langdon’s heart almost stopped. When they approached, however, theyfound the ancient lock hanging open. The gate swung freely.Langdon breathed a sigh of relief, realizing as he had suspected, that theancient tunnel was in use. Recently. As in today. He now had little doubt thatfour terrified cardinals had been secreted through here earlier.They ran on. Langdon could now hear the sounds of chaos to his left. It was St.Peter’s Square. They were getting close.They hit another gate, this one heavier. It too was unlocked. The sound of St.Peter’s Square faded behind them now, and Langdon sensed they had passed throughthe outer wall of Vatican City. He wondered where inside the Vatican thisancient passage would conclude. In the gardens? In the basilica? In the papalresidence?Then, without warning, the tunnel ended.The cumbrous door blocking their way was a thick wall of riveted iron. Even bythe last flickers of his torch, Langdon could see that the portal was perfectlysmooth-no handles, no knobs, no keyholes, no hinges. No entry.He felt a surge of panic. In architect-speak, this rare kind of door was calleda senza chiave-a one-way portal, used for security, and only operable from oneside-the other side. Langdon’s hope dimmed to black… along with the torch in hishand.He looked at his watch. Mickey glowed.11:29 P.M.With a scream of frustration, Langdon swung the torch and started pounding onthe door."},{"pageContent":"113Something was wrong.Lieutenant Chartrand stood outside the Pope’s office and sensed in the uneasystance of the soldier standing with him that they shared the same anxiety. Theprivate meeting they were shielding, Rocher had said, could save the Vaticanfrom destruction. So Chartrand wondered why his protective instincts weretingling. And why was Rocher acting so strangely?Something definitely was awry.Captain Rocher stood to Chartrand’s right, staring dead ahead, his sharp gazeuncharacteristically distant. Chartrand barely recognized the captain. Rocherhad not been himself in the last hour. His decisions made no sense.Someone should be present inside this meeting! Chartrand thought. He had heardMaximilian Kohler bolt the door after he entered. Why had Rocher permitted this?But there was so much more bothering Chartrand. The cardinals. The cardinalswere still locked in the Sistine Chapel. This was absolute insanity. Thecamerlegno had wanted them evacuated fifteen minutes ago! Rocher had overruledthe decision and not informed the camerlegno. Chartrand had expressed concern,and Rocher had almost taken off his head. Chain of command was never questionedin the Swiss Guard, and Rocher was now top dog.Half an hour, Rocher thought, discreetly checking his Swiss chronometer in thedim light of the candelabra lighting the hall. Please hurry.Chartrand wished he could hear what was happening on the other side of thedoors. Still, he knew there was no one he would rather have handling this crisisthan the camerlegno. The man had been tested beyond reason tonight, and he hadnot flinched. He had confronted the problem head-on… truthful, candid, shininglike an example to all. Chartrand felt proud right now to be a Catholic. TheIlluminati had made a mistake when they challenged Camerlegno Ventresca.At that moment, however, Chartrand’s thoughts were jolted by an unexpectedsound. A banging. It was coming from down the hall. The pounding was distant andmuffled, but incessant. Rocher looked up. The captain turned to Chartrand andmotioned down the hall. Chartrand understood. He turned on his flashlight andtook off to investigate.The banging was more desperate now. Chartrand ran thirty yards down the corridorto an intersection. The noise seemed to be coming from around the corner, beyondthe Sala Clementina. Chartrand felt perplexed. There was only one room backthere-the Pope’s private library. His Holiness’s private library had been lockedsince the Pope’s death. Nobody could possibly be in there!Chartrand hurried down the second corridor, turned another corner, and rushed tothe library door. The wooden portico was diminutive, but it stood in the darklike a dour sentinel. The banging was coming from somewhere inside. Chartrandhesitated. He had never been inside the private library. Few had. No one wasallowed in without an escort by the Pope himself.Tentatively, Chartrand reached for the doorknob and turned. As he had imagined,the door was locked. He put his ear to the door. The banging was louder. Then heheard something else. Voices! Someone calling out!He could not make out the words, but he could hear the panic in their shouts.Was someone trapped in the library? Had the Swiss Guard not properly evacuatedthe building? Chartrand hesitated, wondering if he should go back and consultRocher. The hell with that. Chartrand had been trained to make decisions, and hewould make one now. He pulled out his side arm and fired a single shot into thedoor latch. The wood exploded, and the door swung open.Beyond the threshold Chartrand saw nothing but blackness. He shone hisflashlight. The room was rectangular-oriental carpets, high oak shelves packedwith books, a stitched leather couch, and a marble fireplace. Chartrand hadheard stories of this place-three thousand ancient volumes side by side withhundreds of current magazines and periodicals, anything His Holiness requested.The coffee table was covered with journals of science and politics.The banging was clearer now. Chartrand shone his light across the room towardthe sound. On the far wall, beyond the sitting area, was a huge door made ofiron. It looked impenetrable as a vault. It had four mammoth locks. The tinyetched letters dead center of the door took Chartrand’s breath away.IL PASSETTOChartrand stared. The Pope’s secret escape route! Chartrand had certainly heardof Il Passetto, and he had even heard rumors that it had once had an entrancehere in the library, but the tunnel had not been used in ages! Who could bebanging on the other side?Chartrand took his flashlight and rapped on the door. There was a muffledexultation from the other side. The banging stopped, and the voices yelledlouder. Chartrand could barely make out their words through the barricade.“… Kohler… lie… camerlegno…”“Who is that?” Chartrand yelled.“… ert Langdon… Vittoria Ve…”Chartrand understood enough to be confused. I thought you were dead!“… the door,” the voices yelled. “Open… !”Chartrand looked at the iron barrier and knew he would need dynamite to getthrough there. “Impossible!” he yelled. “Too thick!”“… meeting… stop… erlegno… danger…”Despite his training on the hazards of panic, Chartrand felt a sudden rush offear at the last few words. Had he understood correctly? Heart pounding, heturned to run back to the office. As he turned, though, he stalled. His gaze hadfallen to something on the door… something more shocking even than the messagecoming from beyond it. Emerging from the keyholes of each of the door’s massivelocks were keys. Chartrand stared. The keys were here? He blinked in disbelief.The keys to this door were supposed to be in a vault someplace! This passage wasnever used-not for centuries!Chartrand dropped his flashlight on the floor. He grabbed the first key andturned. The mechanism was rusted and stiff, but it still worked. Someone hadopened it recently. Chartrand worked the next lock. And the next. When the lastbolt slid aside, Chartrand pulled. The slab of iron creaked open. He grabbed hislight and shone it into the passage.Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra looked like apparitions as they staggered intothe library. Both were ragged and tired, but they were very much alive.“What is this!” Chartrand demanded. “What’s going on! Where did you come from?”“Where’s Max Kohler?” Langdon demanded.Chartrand pointed. “In a private meeting with the camer-”Langdon and Vittoria pushed past him and ran down the darkened hall. Chartrandturned, instinctively raising his gun at their backs. He quickly lowered it andran after them. Rocher apparently heard them coming, because as they arrivedoutside the Pope’s office, Rocher had spread his legs in a protective stance andwas leveling his gun at them. “Alt!”“The camerlegno is in danger!” Langdon yelled, raising his arms in surrender ashe slid to a stop. “Open the door! Max Kohler is going to kill the camerlegno!”Rocher looked angry.“Open the door!” Vittoria said. “Hurry!”But it was too late.From inside the Pope’s office came a bloodcurdling scream. It was thecamerlegno."},{"pageContent":"114The confrontation lasted only seconds.Camerlegno Ventresca was still screaming when Chartrand stepped past Rocher andblew open the door of the Pope’s office. The guards dashed in. Langdon andVittoria ran in behind them.The scene before them was staggering.The chamber was lit only by candlelight and a dying fire. Kohler was near thefireplace, standing awkwardly in front of his wheelchair. He brandished apistol, aimed at the camerlegno, who lay on the floor at his feet, writhing inagony. The camerlegno’s cassock was torn open, and his bare chest was searedblack. Langdon could not make out the symbol from across the room, but a large,square brand lay on the floor near Kohler. The metal still glowed red.Two of the Swiss Guards acted without hesitation. They opened fire. The bulletssmashed into Kohler’s chest, driving him backward. Kohler collapsed into hiswheelchair, his chest gurgling blood. His gun went skittering across the floor.Langdon stood stunned in the doorway.Vittoria seemed paralyzed. “Max…” she whispered.The camerlegno, still twisting on the floor, rolled toward Rocher, and with thetrancelike terror of the early witch hunts, pointed his index finger at Rocherand yelled a single word. “ILLUMINATUS!”“You bastard,” Rocher said, running at him. “You sanctimonious bas-”This time it was Chartrand who reacted on instinct, putting three bullets inRocher’s back. The captain fell face first on the tile floor and slid lifelessthrough his own blood. Chartrand and the guards dashed immediately to thecamerlegno, who lay clutching himself, convulsing in pain.Both guards let out exclamations of horror when they saw the symbol seared onthe camerlegno’s chest. The second guard saw the brand upside down andimmediately staggered backward with fear in his eyes. Chartrand, looking equallyoverwhelmed by the symbol, pulled the camerlegno’s torn cassock up over theburn, shielding it from view.Langdon felt delirious as he moved across the room. Through a mist of insanityand violence, he tried to make sense of what he was seeing. A crippledscientist, in a final act of symbolic dominance, had flown into Vatican City andbranded the church’s highest official. Some things are worth dying for, theHassassin had said. Langdon wondered how a handicapped man could possibly haveoverpowered the camerlegno. Then again, Kohler had a gun. It doesn’t matter howhe did it! Kohler accomplished his mission!Langdon moved toward the gruesome scene. The camerlegno was being attended, andLangdon felt himself drawn toward the smoking brand on the floor near Kohler’swheelchair. The sixth brand? The closer Langdon got, the more confused hebecame. The brand seemed to be a perfect square, quite large, and had obviouslycome from the sacred center compartment of the chest in the Illuminati Lair. Asixth and final brand, the Hassassin had said. The most brilliant of all.Langdon knelt beside Kohler and reached for the object. The metal still radiatedheat. Grasping the wooden handle, Langdon picked it up. He was not sure what heexpected to see, but it most certainly was not this.[images/00002.jpg]Langdon stared a long, confused moment. Nothing was making sense. Why had theguards cried out in horror when they saw this? It was a square of meaninglesssquiggles. The most brilliant of all? It was symmetrical, Langdon could tell ashe rotated it in his hand, but it was gibberish.When he felt a hand on his shoulder, Langdon looked up, expecting Vittoria. Thehand, however, was covered with blood. It belonged to Maximilian Kohler, who wasreaching out from his wheelchair.Langdon dropped the brand and staggered to his feet. Kohler’s still alive!Slumped in his wheelchair, the dying director was still breathing, albeitbarely, sucking in sputtering gasps. Kohler’s eyes met Langdon’s, and it was thesame stony gaze that had greeted Langdon at CERN earlier that day. The eyeslooked even harder in death, the loathing and enmity rising to the surface.The scientist’s body quivered, and Langdon sensed he was trying to move.Everyone else in the room was focused on the camerlegno, and Langdon wanted tocall out, but he could not react. He was transfixed by the intensity radiatingfrom Kohler in these final seconds of his life. The director, with tremulouseffort, lifted his arm and pulled a small device off the arm of his wheelchair.It was the size of a matchbox. He held it out, quivering. For an instant,Langdon feared Kohler had a weapon. But it was something else.“G-give…” Kohler’s final words were a gurgling whisper. “G-give this… to them-media.” Kohler collapsed motionless, and the device fell in his lap.Shocked, Langdon stared at the device. It was electronic. The words SONY RUVIwere printed across the front. Langdon recognized it as one of those newultraminiature, palm-held camcorders. The balls on this guy! he thought. Kohlerhad apparently recorded some sort of final suicide message he wanted the mediato broadcast… no doubt some sermon about the importance of science and the evilsof religion. Langdon decided he had done enough for this man’s cause tonight.Before Chartrand saw Kohler’s camcorder, Langdon slipped it into his deepestjacket pocket. Kohler’s final message can rot in hell!It was the voice of the camerlegno that broke the silence. He was trying to situp. “The cardinals,” he gasped to Chartrand.“Still in the Sistine Chapel!” Chartrand exclaimed. “Captain Rocher ordered-”“Evacuate… now. Everyone.”Chartrand sent one of the other guards running off to let the cardinals out.The camerlegno grimaced in pain. “Helicopter… out front… get me to a hospital.”"},{"pageContent":"115In St. Peter’s Square, the Swiss Guard pilot sat in the cockpit of the parkedVatican helicopter and rubbed his temples. The chaos in the square around himwas so loud that it drowned out the sound of his idling rotors. This was nosolemn candlelight vigil. He was amazed a riot had not broken out yet.With less than twenty-five minutes left until midnight, the people were stillpacked together, some praying, some weeping for the church, others screamingobscenities and proclaiming that this was what the church deserved, still otherschanting apocalyptic Bible verses.The pilot’s head pounded as the media lights glinted off his windshield. Hesquinted out at the clamorous masses. Banners waved over the crowd.ANTIMATTER IS THE ANTICHRIST!SCIENTIST=SATANISTWHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?The pilot groaned, his headache worsening. He half considered grabbing thewindshield’s vinyl covering and putting it up so he wouldn’t have to watch, buthe knew he would be airborne in a matter of minutes. Lieutenant Chartrand hadjust radioed with terrible news. The camerlegno had been attacked by MaximilianKohler and seriously injured. Chartrand, the American, and the woman werecarrying the camerlegno out now so he could be evacuated to a hospital.The pilot felt personally responsible for the attack. He reprimanded himself fornot acting on his gut. Earlier, when he had picked up Kohler at the airport, hehad sensed something in the scientist’s dead eyes. He couldn’t place it, but hedidn’t like it. Not that it mattered. Rocher was running the show, and Rocherinsisted this was the guy. Rocher had apparently been wrong.A new clamor arose from the crowd, and the pilot looked over to see a line ofcardinals processing solemnly out of the Vatican onto St. Peter’s Square. Thecardinals’ relief to be leaving ground zero seemed to be quickly overcome bylooks of bewilderment at the spectacle now going on outside the church.The crowd noise intensified yet again. The pilot’s head pounded. He needed anaspirin. Maybe three. He didn’t like to fly on medication, but a few aspirinwould certainly be less debilitating than this raging headache. He reached forthe first-aid kit, kept with assorted maps and manuals in a cargo box boltedbetween the two front seats. When he tried to open the box, though, he found itlocked. He looked around for the key and then finally gave up. Tonight wasclearly not his lucky night. He went back to massaging his temples.Inside the darkened basilica, Langdon, Vittoria, and the two guards strainedbreathlessly toward the main exit. Unable to find anything more suitable, thefour of them were transporting the wounded camerlegno on a narrow table,balancing the inert body between them as though on a stretcher. Outside thedoors, the faint roar of human chaos was now audible. The camerlegno teetered onthe brink of unconsciousness.Time was running out."},{"pageContent":"116It was 11:39 P.M. when Langdon stepped with the others from St. Peter’sBasilica. The glare that hit his eyes was searing. The media lights shone offthe white marble like sunlight off a snowy tundra. Langdon squinted, trying tofind refuge behind the faзade’s enormous columns, but the light came from alldirections. In front of him, a collage of massive video screens rose above thecrowd.Standing there atop the magnificent stairs that spilled down to the piazzabelow, Langdon felt like a reluctant player on the world’s biggest stage.Somewhere beyond the glaring lights, Langdon heard an idling helicopter and theroar of a hundred thousand voices. To their left, a procession of cardinals wasnow evacuating onto the square. They all stopped in apparent distress to see thescene now unfolding on the staircase.“Careful now,” Chartrand urged, sounding focused as the group began descendingthe stairs toward the helicopter.Langdon felt like they were moving underwater. His arms ached from the weight ofthe camerlegno and the table. He wondered how the moment could get much lessdignified. Then he saw the answer. The two BBC reporters had apparently beencrossing the open square on their way back to the press area. But now, with theroar of the crowd, they had turned. Glick and Macri were now running back towardthem. Macri’s camera was raised and rolling. Here come the vultures, Langdonthought.“Alt!” Chartrand yelled. “Get back!”But the reporters kept coming. Langdon guessed the other networks would takeabout six seconds to pick up this live BBC feed again. He was wrong. They tooktwo. As if connected by some sort of universal consciousness, every last mediascreen in the piazza cut away from their countdown clocks and their Vaticanexperts and began transmitting the same picture-a jiggling action footageswooping up the Vatican stairs. Now, everywhere Langdon looked, he saw thecamerlegno’s limp body in a Technicolor close-up.This is wrong! Langdon thought. He wanted to run down the stairs and interfere,but he could not. It wouldn’t have helped anyway. Whether it was the roar of thecrowd or the cool night air that caused it, Langdon would never know, but atthat moment, the inconceivable occurred.Like a man awakening from a nightmare, the camerlegno’s eyes shot open and hesat bolt upright. Taken entirely by surprise, Langdon and the others fumbledwith the shifting weight. The front of the table dipped. The camerlegno began toslide. They tried to recover by setting the table down, but it was too late. Thecamerlegno slid off the front. Incredibly, he did not fall. His feet hit themarble, and he swayed upright. He stood a moment, looking disoriented, and then,before anyone could stop him, he lurched forward, staggering down the stairstoward Macri.“No!” Langdon screamed.Chartrand rushed forward, trying to reign in the camerlegno. But the camerlegnoturned on him, wild-eyed, crazed. “Leave me!”Chartrand jumped back.The scene went from bad to worse. The camerlegno’s torn cassock, having beenonly laid over his chest by Chartrand, began to slip lower. For a moment,Langdon thought the garment might hold, but that moment passed. The cassock letgo, sliding off his shoulders down around his waist.The gasp that went up from the crowd seemed to travel around the globe and backin an instant. Cameras rolled, flashbulbs exploded. On media screens everywhere,the image of the camerlegno’s branded chest was projected, towering and ingrisly detail. Some screens were even freezing the image and rotating it 180degrees.The ultimate Illuminati victory.Langdon stared at the brand on the screens. Although it was the imprint of thesquare brand he had held earlier, the symbol now made sense. Perfect sense. Themarking’s awesome power hit Langdon like a train.Orientation. Langdon had forgotten the first rule of symbology. When is a squarenot a square? He had also forgotten that iron brands, just like rubber stamps,never looked like their imprints. They were in reverse. Langdon had been lookingat the brand’s negative!As the chaos grew, an old Illuminati quote echoed with new meaning: “A flawlessdiamond, born of the ancient elements with such perfection that all those whosaw it could only stare in wonder.”Langdon knew now the myth was true.Earth, Air, Fire, Water.The Illuminati Diamond.[images/00007.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"117Robert Langdon had little doubt that the chaos and hysteria coursing through St.Peter’s Square at this very instant exceeded anything Vatican Hill had everwitnessed. No battle, no crucifixion, no pilgrimage, no mystical vision… nothingin the shrine’s 2,000-year history could possibly match the scope and drama ofthis very moment.As the tragedy unfolded, Langdon felt oddly separate, as if hovering therebeside Vittoria at the top of the stairs. The action seemed to distend, as if ina time warp, all the insanity slowing to a crawl…The branded camerlegno… raving for the world to see…The Illuminati Diamond… unveiled in its diabolical genius…The countdown clock registering the final twenty minutes of Vatican history…The drama, however, had only just begun.The camerlegno, as if in some sort of post-traumatic trance, seemed suddenlypuissant, possessed by demons. He began babbling, whispering to unseen spirits,looking up at the sky and raising his arms to God.“Speak!” the camerlegno yelled to the heavens. “Yes, I hear you!”In that moment, Langdon understood. His heart dropped like a rock.Vittoria apparently understood too. She went white. “He’s in shock,” she said.“He’s hallucinating. He thinks he’s talking to God!”Somebody’s got to stop this, Langdon thought. It was a wretched and embarrassingend. Get this man to a hospital!Below them on the stairs, Chinita Macri was poised and filming, apparentlyhaving located her ideal vantage point. The images she filmed appeared instantlyacross the square behind her on media screens… like endless drive-in movies allplaying the same grisly tragedy.The whole scene felt epic. The camerlegno, in his torn cassock, with thescorched brand on his chest, looked like some sort of battered champion who hadovercome the rings of hell for this one moment of revelation. He bellowed to theheavens.“Ti sento, Dio! I hear you, God!”Chartrand backed off, a look of awe on his face.The hush that fell across the crowd was instant and absolute. For a moment itwas as if the silence had fallen across the entire planet… everyone in front oftheir TVs rigid, a communal holding of breath.The camerlegno stood on the stairs, before the world, and held out his arms. Helooked almost Christlike, bare and wounded before the world. He raised his armsto the heavens and, looking up, exclaimed, “Grazie! Grazie, Dio!”The silence of the masses never broke.“Grazie, Dio!” the camerlegno cried out again. Like the sun breaking through astormy sky, a look of joy spread across his face. “Grazie, Dio!”Thank you, God? Langdon stared in wonder.The camerlegno was radiant now, his eerie transformation complete. He looked upat the sky, still nodding furiously. He shouted to the heavens, “Upon this rockI will build my church!”Langdon knew the words, but he had no idea why the camerlegno could possibly beshouting them.The camerlegno turned back to the crowd and bellowed again into the night. “Uponthis rock I will build my church!” Then he raised his hands to the sky andlaughed out loud. “Grazie, Dio! Grazie!”The man had clearly gone mad.The world watched, spellbound.The culmination, however, was something no one expected.With a final joyous exultation, the camerlegno turned and dashed back into St.Peter’s Basilica."},{"pageContent":"118Eleven-forty-two P.M.The frenzied convoy that plunged back into the basilica to retrieve thecamerlegno was not one Langdon had ever imagined he would be part of… much lessleading. But he had been closest to the door and had acted on instinct.He’ll die in here, Langdon thought, sprinting over the threshold into thedarkened void. “Camerlegno! Stop!”The wall of blackness that hit Langdon was absolute. His pupils were contractedfrom the glare outside, and his field of vision now extended no farther than afew feet before his face. He skidded to a stop. Somewhere in the blacknessahead, he heard the camerlegno’s cassock rustle as the priest ran blindly intothe abyss.Vittoria and the guards arrived immediately. Flashlights came on, but the lightswere almost dead now and did not even begin to probe the depths of the basilicabefore them. The beams swept back and forth, revealing only columns and barefloor. The camerlegno was nowhere to be seen.“Camerlegno!” Chartrand yelled, fear in his voice. “Wait! Signore!”A commotion in the doorway behind them caused everyone to turn. Chinita Macri’slarge frame lurched through the entry. Her camera was shouldered, and theglowing red light on top revealed that it was still transmitting. Glick wasrunning behind her, microphone in hand, yelling for her to slow down.Langdon could not believe these two. This is not the time!“Out!” Chartrand snapped. “This is not for your eyes!”But Macri and Glick kept coming.“Chinita!” Glick sounded fearful now. “This is suicide! I’m not coming!”Macri ignored him. She threw a switch on her camera. The spotlight on top glaredto life, blinding everyone.Langdon shielded his face and turned away in pain. Damn it! When he looked up,though, the church around them was illuminated for thirty yards.At that moment the camerlegno’s voice echoed somewhere in the distance. “Uponthis rock I will build my church!”Macri wheeled her camera toward the sound. Far off, in the grayness at the endof the spotlight’s reach, black fabric billowed, revealing a familiar formrunning down the main aisle of the basilica.There was a fleeting instant of hesitation as everyone’s eyes took in thebizarre image. Then the dam broke. Chartrand pushed past Langdon and sprintedafter the camerlegno. Langdon took off next. Then the guards and Vittoria.Macri brought up the rear, lighting everyone’s way and transmitting thesepulchral chase to the world. An unwilling Glick cursed aloud as he taggedalong, fumbling through a terrified blow-by-blow commentary.The main aisle of St. Peter’s Basilica, Lieutenant Chartrand had once figuredout, was longer than an Olympic soccer field. Tonight, however, it felt liketwice that. As the guard sprinted after the camerlegno, he wondered where theman was headed. The camerlegno was clearly in shock, delirious no doubt from hisphysical trauma and bearing witness to the horrific massacre in the Pope’soffice.Somewhere up ahead, beyond the reach of the BBC spotlight, the camerlegno’svoice rang out joyously. “Upon this rock I will build my church!”Chartrand knew the man was shouting Scripture-Matthew 16:18, if Chartrandrecalled correctly. Upon this rock I will build my church. It was an almostcruelly inapt inspiration-the church was about to be destroyed. Surely thecamerlegno had gone mad.Or had he?For a fleeting instant, Chartrand’s soul fluttered. Holy visions and divinemessages had always seemed like wishful delusions to him-the product ofoverzealous minds hearing what they wanted to hear-God did not interactdirectly!A moment later, though, as if the Holy Spirit Himself had descended to persuadeChartrand of His power, Chartrand had a vision.Fifty yards ahead, in the center of the church, a ghost appeared… a diaphanous,glowing outline. The pale shape was that of the half-naked camerlegno. Thespecter seemed transparent, radiating light. Chartrand staggered to a stop,feeling a knot tighten in his chest. The camerlegno is glowing! The body seemedto shine brighter now. Then, it began to sink… deeper and deeper, until itdisappeared as if by magic into the blackness of the floor.Langdon had seen the phantom also. For a moment, he too thought he had witnesseda magical vision. But as he passed the stunned Chartrand and ran toward the spotwhere the camerlegno had disappeared, he realized what had just happened. Thecamerlegno had arrived at the Niche of the Palliums-the sunken chamber lit byninety-nine oil lamps. The lamps in the niche shone up from beneath,illuminating him like a ghost. Then, as the camerlegno descended the stairs intothe light, he had seemed to disappear beneath the floor.Langdon arrived breathless at the rim overlooking the sunken room. He peereddown the stairs. At the bottom, lit by the golden glow of oil lamps, thecamerlegno dashed across the marble chamber toward the set of glass doors thatled to the room holding the famous golden box.What is he doing? Langdon wondered. Certainly he can’t think the golden box-The camerlegno yanked open the doors and ran inside. Oddly though, he totallyignored the golden box, rushing right past it. Five feet beyond the box, hedropped to his knees and began struggling to lift an iron grate embedded in thefloor.Langdon watched in horror, now realizing where the camerlegno was headed. GoodGod, no! He dashed down the stairs after him. “Father! Don’t!”As Langdon opened the glass doors and ran toward the camerlegno, he saw thecamerlegno heave on the grate. The hinged, iron bulkhead fell open with adeafening crash, revealing a narrow shaft and a steep stairway that dropped intonothingness. As the camerlegno moved toward the hole, Langdon grabbed his bareshoulders and pulled him back. The man’s skin was slippery with sweat, butLangdon held on.The camerlegno wheeled, obviously startled. “What are you doing!”Langdon was surprised when their eyes met. The camerlegno no longer had theglazed look of a man in a trance. His eyes were keen, glistening with a luciddetermination. The brand on his chest looked excruciating.“Father,” Langdon urged, as calmly as possible, “you can’t go down there. Weneed to evacuate.”“My son,” the camerlegno said, his voice eerily sane. “I have just had amessage. I know-”“Camerlegno!” It was Chartrand and the others. They came dashing down the stairsinto the room, lit by Macri’s camera.When Chartrand saw the open grate in the floor, his eyes filled with dread. Hecrossed himself and shot Langdon a thankful look for having stopped thecamerlegno. Langdon understood; had read enough about Vatican architecture toknow what lay beneath that grate. It was the most sacred place in all ofChristendom. Terra Santa. Holy Ground. Some called it the Necropolis. Somecalled it the Catacombs. According to accounts from the select few clergy whohad descended over the years, the Necropolis was a dark maze of subterraneancrypts that could swallow a visitor whole if he lost his way. It was not thekind of place through which they wanted to be chasing the camerlegno.“Signore,” Chartrand pleaded. “You’re in shock. We need to leave this place. Youcannot go down there. It’s suicide.”The camerlegno seemed suddenly stoic. He reached out and put a quiet hand onChartrand’s shoulder. “Thank you for your concern and service. I cannot tell youhow. I cannot tell you I understand. But I have had a revelation. I know wherethe antimatter is.”Everyone stared.The camerlegno turned to the group. “Upon this rock I will build my church. Thatwas the message. The meaning is clear.”Langdon was still unable to comprehend the camerlegno’s conviction that he hadspoken to God, much less that he had deciphered the message. Upon this rock Iwill build my church? They were the words spoken by Jesus when he chose Peter ashis first apostle. What did they have to do with anything?Macri moved in for a closer shot. Glick was mute, as if shell-shocked.The camerlegno spoke quickly now. “The Illuminati have placed their tool ofdestruction on the very cornerstone of this church. At the foundation.” Hemotioned down the stairs. “On the very rock upon which this church was built.And I know where that rock is.”Langdon was certain the time had come to overpower the camerlegno and carry himoff. As lucid as he seemed, the priest was talking nonsense. A rock? Thecornerstone in the foundation? The stairway before them didn’t lead to thefoundation, it led to the necropolis! “The quote is a metaphor, Father! There isno actual rock!”The camerlegno looked strangely sad. “There is a rock, my son.” He pointed intothe hole. “Pietro и la pietra.”Langdon froze. In an instant it all came clear.The austere simplicity of it gave him chills. As Langdon stood there with theothers, staring down the long staircase, he realized that there was indeed arock buried in the darkness beneath this church.Pietro и la pietra. Peter is the rock.Peter’s faith in God was so steadfast that Jesus called Peter “the rock”-theunwavering disciple on whose shoulders Jesus would build his church. On thisvery location, Langdon realized-Vatican Hill-Peter had been crucified andburied. The early Christians built a small shrine over his tomb. As Christianityspread, the shrine got bigger, layer upon layer, culminating in this colossalbasilica. The entire Catholic faith had been built, quite literally, upon St.Peter. The rock.“The antimatter is on St. Peter’s tomb,” the camerlegno said, his voicecrystalline.Despite the seemingly supernatural origin of the information, Langdon sensed astark logic in it. Placing the antimatter on St. Peter’s tomb seemed painfullyobvious now. The Illuminati, in an act of symbolic defiance, had located theantimatter at the core of Christendom, both literally and figuratively. Theultimate infiltration.“And if you all need worldly proof,” the camerlegno said, sounding impatientnow, “I just found that grate unlocked.” He pointed to the open bulkhead in thefloor. “It is never unlocked. Someone has been down there… recently.”Everyone stared into the hole.An instant later, with deceptive agility, the camerlegno spun, grabbed an oillamp, and headed for the opening."},{"pageContent":"119The stone steps declined steeply into the earth.I’m going to die down here, Vittoria thought, gripping the heavy rope banisteras she bounded down the cramped passageway behind the others. Although Langdonhad made a move to stop the camerlegno from entering the shaft, Chartrand hadintervened, grabbing Langdon and holding on. Apparently, the young guard was nowconvinced the camerlegno knew what he was doing.After a brief scuffle, Langdon had freed himself and pursued the camerlegno withChartrand close on his heels. Instinctively, Vittoria had dashed after them.Now she was racing headlong down a precipitous grade where any misplaced stepcould mean a deadly fall. Far below, she could see the golden glow of thecamerlegno’s oil lamp. Behind her, Vittoria could hear the BBC reportershurrying to keep up. The camera spotlight threw gnarled shadows beyond her downthe shaft, illuminating Chartrand and Langdon. Vittoria could scarcely believethe world was bearing witness to this insanity. Turn off the damn camera! Thenagain, she knew the light was the only reason any of them could see where theywere going.As the bizarre chase continued, Vittoria’s thoughts whipped like a tempest. Whatcould the camerlegno possibly do down here? Even if he found the antimatter?There was no time!Vittoria was surprised to find her intuition now telling her the camerlegno wasprobably right. Placing the antimatter three stories beneath the earth seemed analmost noble and merciful choice. Deep underground-much as in Z-lab-anantimatter annihilation would be partially contained. There would be no heatblast, no flying shrapnel to injure onlookers, just a biblical opening of theearth and a towering basilica crumbling into a crater.Was this Kohler’s one act of decency? Sparing lives? Vittoria still could notfathom the director’s involvement. She could accept his hatred of religion… butthis awesome conspiracy seemed beyond him. Was Kohler’s loathing really thisprofound? Destruction of the Vatican? Hiring an assassin? The murders of herfather, the Pope, and four cardinals? It seemed unthinkable. And how had Kohlermanaged all this treachery within the Vatican walls? Rocher was Kohler’s insideman, Vittoria told herself. Rocher was an Illuminatus. No doubt Captain Rocherhad keys to everything-the Pope’s chambers, Il Passetto, the Necropolis, St.Peter’s tomb, all of it. He could have placed the antimatter on St. Peter’stomb-a highly restricted locale-and then commanded his guards not to waste timesearching the Vatican’s restricted areas. Rocher knew nobody would ever find thecanister.But Rocher never counted on the camerlegno’s message from above.The message. This was the leap of faith Vittoria was still struggling to accept.Had God actually communicated with the camerlegno? Vittoria’s gut said no, andyet hers was the science of entanglement physics-the study ofinterconnectedness. She witnessed miraculous communications every day-twinsea-turtle eggs separated and placed in labs thousands of miles apart hatchingat the same instant… acres of jellyfish pulsating in perfect rhythm as if of asingle mind. There are invisible lines of communication everywhere, she thought.But between God and man?Vittoria wished her father were there to give her faith. He had once explaineddivine communication to her in scientific terms, and he had made her believe.She still remembered the day she had seen him praying and asked him, “Father,why do you bother to pray? God cannot answer you.”Leonardo Vetra had looked up from his meditations with a paternal smile. “Mydaughter the skeptic. So you don’t believe God speaks to man? Let me put it inyour language.” He took a model of the human brain down from a shelf and set itin front of her. “As you probably know, Vittoria, human beings normally use avery small percentage of their brain power. However, if you put them inemotionally charged situations-like physical trauma, extreme joy or fear, deepmeditation-all of a sudden their neurons start firing like crazy, resulting inmassively enhanced mental clarity.”“So what?” Vittoria said. “Just because you think clearly doesn’t mean you talkto God.”“Aha!” Vetra exclaimed. “And yet remarkable solutions to seemingly impossibleproblems often occur in these moments of clarity. It’s what gurus call higherconsciousness. Biologists call it altered states. Psychologists call itsuper-sentience.” He paused. “And Christians call it answered prayer.” Smilingbroadly, he added, “Sometimes, divine revelation simply means adjusting yourbrain to hear what your heart already knows.”Now, as she dashed down, headlong into the dark, Vittoria sensed perhaps herfather was right. Was it so hard to believe that the camerlegno’s trauma had puthis mind in a state where he had simply “realized” the antimatter’s location?Each of us is a God, Buddha had said. Each of us knows all.We need only open ourminds to hear our own wisdom.It was in that moment of clarity, as Vittoria plunged deeper into the earth,that she felt her own mind open… her own wisdom surface. She sensed now withouta doubt what the camerlegno’s intentions were. Her awareness brought with it afear like nothing she had ever known.“Camerlegno, no!” she shouted down the passage. “You don’t understand!” Vittoriapictured the multitudes of people surrounding Vatican City, and her blood rancold. “If you bring the antimatter up… everyone will die!”Langdon was leaping three steps at a time now, gaining ground. The passage wascramped, but he felt no claustrophobia. His once debilitating fear wasovershadowed by a far deeper dread.“Camerlegno!” Langdon felt himself closing the gap on the lantern’s glow. “Youmust leave the antimatter where it is! There’s no other choice!”Even as Langdon spoke the words, he could not believe them. Not only had heaccepted the camerlegno’s divine revelation of the antimatter’s location, but hewas lobbying for the destruction of St. Peter’s Basilica-one of the greatestarchitectural feats on earth… as well as all of the art inside.But the people outside… it’s the only way.It seemed a cruel irony that the only way to save the people now was to destroythe church. Langdon figured the Illuminati were amused by the symbolism.The air coming up from the bottom of the tunnel was cool and dank. Somewheredown here was the sacred necropolis… burial place of St. Peter and countlessother early Christians. Langdon felt a chill, hoping this was not a suicidemission.Suddenly, the camerlegno’s lantern seemed to halt. Langdon closed on him fast.The end of the stairs loomed abruptly from out of the shadows. A wrought-irongate with three embossed skulls blocked the bottom of the stairs. The camerlegnowas there, pulling the gate open. Langdon leapt, pushing the gate shut, blockingthe camerlegno’s way. The others came thundering down the stairs, everyoneghostly white in the BBC spotlight… especially Glick, who was looking more pastywith every step.Chartrand grabbed Langdon. “Let the camerlegno pass!”“No!” Vittoria said from above, breathless. “We must evacuate right now! Youcannot take the antimatter out of here! If you bring it up, everyone outsidewill die!”The camerlegno’s voice was remarkably calm. “All of you… we must trust. We havelittle time.”“You don’t understand,” Vittoria said. “An explosion at ground level will bemuch worse than one down here!”The camerlegno looked at her, his green eyes resplendently sane. “Who saidanything about an explosion at ground level?”Vittoria stared. “You’re leaving it down here?”The camerlegno’s certitude was hypnotic. “There will be no more death tonight.”“Father, but-”“Please… some faith.” The camerlegno’s voice plunged to a compelling hush. “I amnot asking anyone to join me. You are all free to go. All I am asking is thatyou not interfere with His bidding. Let me do what I have been called to do.”The camerlegno’s stare intensified. “I am to save this church. And I can. Iswear on my life.”The silence that followed might as well have been thunder."},{"pageContent":"120Eleven-fifty-one P.M.Necropolis literally means City of the Dead.Nothing Robert Langdon had ever read about this place prepared him for the sightof it. The colossal subterranean hollow was filled with crumbling mausoleums,like small houses on the floor of a cave. The air smelled lifeless. An awkwardgrid of narrow walkways wound between the decaying memorials, most of which werefractured brick with marble platings. Like columns of dust, countless pillars ofunexcavated earth rose up, supporting a dirt sky, which hung low over thepenumbral hamlet.City of the dead, Langdon thought, feeling trapped between academic wonder andraw fear. He and the others dashed deeper down the winding passages. Did I makethe wrong choice?Chartrand had been the first to fall under the camerlegno’s spell, yanking openthe gate and declaring his faith in the camerlegno. Glick and Macri, at thecamerlegno’s suggestion, had nobly agreed to provide light to the quest,although considering what accolades awaited them if they got out of here alive,their motivations were certainly suspect. Vittoria had been the least eager ofall, and Langdon had seen in her eyes a wariness that looked, unsettlingly, alot like female intuition.It’s too late now, he thought, he and Vittoria dashing after the others. We’recommitted.Vittoria was silent, but Langdon knew they were thinking the same thing. Nineminutes is not enough time to get the hell out of Vatican City if the camerlegnois wrong.As they ran on through the mausoleums, Langdon felt his legs tiring, noting tohis surprise that the group was ascending a steady incline. The explanation,when it dawned on him, sent shivers to his core. The topography beneath his feetwas that of Christ’s time. He was running up the original Vatican Hill! Langdonhad heard Vatican scholars claim that St. Peter’s tomb was near the top ofVatican Hill, and he had always wondered how they knew. Now he understood. Thedamn hill is still here!Langdon felt like he was running through the pages of history. Somewhere aheadwas St. Peter’s tomb-the Christian relic. It was hard to imagine that theoriginal grave had been marked only with a modest shrine. Not any more. AsPeter’s eminence spread, new shrines were built on top of the old, and now, thehomage stretched 440 feet overhead to the top of Michelangelo’s dome, the apexpositioned directly over the original tomb within a fraction of an inch.They continued ascending the sinuous passages. Langdon checked his watch. Eightminutes. He was beginning to wonder if he and Vittoria would be joining thedeceased here permanently.“Look out!” Glick yelled from behind them. “Snake holes!”Langdon saw it in time. A series of small holes riddled the path before them. Heleapt, just clearing them.Vittoria jumped too, barely avoiding the narrow hollows. She looked uneasy asthey ran on. “Snake holes?”“Snack holes, actually,” Langdon corrected. “Trust me, you don’t want to know.”The holes, he had just realized, were libation tubes. The early Christians hadbelieved in the resurrection of the flesh, and they’d used the holes toliterally “feed the dead” by pouring milk and honey into crypts beneath thefloor.The camerlegno felt weak.He dashed onward, his legs finding strength in his duty to God and man. Almostthere. He was in incredible pain. The mind can bring so much more pain than thebody. Still he felt tired. He knew he had precious little time.“I will save your church, Father. I swear it.”Despite the BBC lights behind him, for which he was grateful, the camerlegnocarried his oil lamp high. I am a beacon in the darkness .I am the light. Thelamp sloshed as he ran, and for an instant he feared the flammable oil mightspill and burn him. He had experienced enough burned flesh for one evening.As he approached the top of the hill, he was drenched in sweat, barely able tobreathe. But when he emerged over the crest, he felt reborn. He staggered ontothe flat piece of earth where he had stood many times. Here the path ended. Thenecropolis came to an abrupt halt at a wall of earth. A tiny marker read:Mausoleum S.La tomba di San Pietro.Before him, at waist level, was an opening in the wall. There was no gildedplaque here. No fanfare. Just a simple hole in the wall, beyond which lay asmall grotto and a meager, crumbling sarcophagus. The camerlegno gazed into thehole and smiled in exhaustion. He could hear the others coming up the hillbehind him. He set down his oil lamp and knelt to pray.Thank you, God. It is almost over.Outside in the square, surrounded by astounded cardinals, Cardinal Mortatistared up at the media screen and watched the drama unfold in the crypt below.He no longer knew what to believe. Had the entire world just witnessed what hehad seen? Had God truly spoken to the camerlegno? Was the antimatter reallygoing to appear on St. Peter’s-“Look!” A gasp went up from the throngs.“There!” Everyone was suddenly pointing at the screen. “It’s a miracle!”Mortati looked up. The camera angle was unsteady, but it was clear enough. Theimage was unforgettable.Filmed from behind, the camerlegno was kneeling in prayer on the earthen floor.In front of him was a rough-hewn hole in the wall. Inside the hollow, among therubble of ancient stone, was a terra cotta casket. Although Mortati had seen thecoffin only once in his life, he knew beyond a doubt what it contained.San Pietro.Mortati was not naпve enough to think that the shouts of joy and amazement nowthundering through the crowd were exaltations from bearing witness to one ofChristianity’s most sacred relics. St. Peter’s tomb was not what had peoplefalling to their knees in spontaneous prayer and thanksgiving. It was the objecton top of his tomb.The antimatter canister. It was there… where it had been all day… hiding in thedarkness of the Necropolis. Sleek. Relentless. Deadly. The camerlegno’srevelation was correct.Mortati stared in wonder at the transparent cylinder. The globule of liquidstill hovered at its core. The grotto around the canister blinked red as the LEDcounted down into its final five minutes of life.Also sitting on the tomb, inches away from the canister, was the wireless SwissGuard security camera that had been pointed at the canister and transmitting allalong.Mortati crossed himself, certain this was the most frightful image he had seenin his entire life. He realized, a moment later, however, that it was about toget worse.The camerlegno stood suddenly. He grabbed the antimatter in his hands andwheeled toward the others. His face showing total focus. He pushed past theothers and began descending the Necropolis the way he had come, running down thehill.The camera caught Vittoria Vetra, frozen in terror. “Where are you going!Camerlegno! I thought you said-”“Have faith!” he exclaimed as he ran off.Vittoria spun toward Langdon. “What do we do?”Robert Langdon tried to stop the camerlegno, but Chartrand was runninginterference now, apparently trusting the camerlegno’s conviction.The picture coming from the BBC camera was like a roller coaster ride now,winding, twisting. Fleeting freeze-frames of confusion and terror as the chaoticcortege stumbled through the shadows back toward the Necropolis entrance.Out in the square, Mortati let out a fearful gasp. “Is he bringing that uphere?”On televisions all over the world, larger than life, the camerlegno raced upwardout of the Necropolis with the antimatter before him. “There will be no moredeath tonight!”But the camerlegno was wrong."},{"pageContent":"121The camerlegno erupted through the doors of St. Peter’s Basilica at exactly11:56 P.M. He staggered into the dazzling glare of the world spotlight, carryingthe antimatter before him like some sort of numinous offering. Through burningeyes he could see his own form, half-naked and wounded, towering like a giant onthe media screens around the square. The roar that went up from the crowd in St.Peter’s Square was like none the camerlegno had ever heard-crying, screaming,chanting, praying… a mix of veneration and terror.Deliver us from evil, he whispered.He felt totally depleted from his race out of the Necropolis. It had almostended in disaster. Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra had wanted to intercepthim, to throw the canister back into its subterranean hiding place, to runoutside for cover. Blind fools!The camerlegno realized now, with fearful clarity, that on any other night, hewould never have won the race. Tonight, however, God again had been with him.Robert Langdon, on the verge of overtaking the camerlegno, had been grabbed byChartrand, ever trusting and dutiful to the camerlegno’s demands for faith. Thereporters, of course, were spellbound and lugging too much equipment tointerfere.The Lord works in mysterious ways.The camerlegno could hear the others behind him now… see them on the screens,closing in. Mustering the last of his physical strength, he raised theantimatter high over his head. Then, throwing back his bare shoulders in an actof defiance to the Illuminati brand on his chest, he dashed down the stairs.There was one final act.Godspeed, he thought. Godspeed.Four minutes…Langdon could barely see as he burst out of the basilica. Again the sea of medialights bore into his retinas. All he could make out was the murky outline of thecamerlegno, directly ahead of him, running down the stairs. For an instant,refulgent in his halo of media lights, the camerlegno looked celestial, likesome kind of modern deity. His cassock was at his waist like a shroud. His bodywas scarred and wounded by the hands of his enemies, and still he endured. Thecamerlegno ran on, standing tall, calling out to the world to have faith,running toward the masses carrying this weapon of destruction.Langdon ran down the stairs after him. What is he doing? He will kill them all!“Satan’s work,” the camerlegno screamed, “has no place in the House of God!” Heran on toward a now terrified crowd.“Father!” Langdon screamed, behind him. “There’s nowhere to go!”“Look to the heavens! We forget to look to the heavens!”In that moment, as Langdon saw where the camerlegno was headed, the glorioustruth came flooding all around him. Although Langdon could not see it on accountof the lights, he knew their salvation was directly overhead.A star-filled Italian sky. The escape route.The helicopter the camerlegno had summoned to take him to the hospital sat deadahead, pilot already in the cockpit, blades already humming in neutral. As thecamerlegno ran toward it, Langdon felt a sudden overwhelming exhilaration.The thoughts that tore through Langdon’s mind came as a torrent…First he pictured the wide-open expanse of the Mediterranean Sea. How far wasit? Five miles? Ten? He knew the beach at Fiumocino was only about seven minutesby train. But by helicopter, 200 miles an hour, no stops… If they could fly thecanister far enough out to sea, and drop it… There were other options too, herealized, feeling almost weightless as he ran. La Cava Romana! The marblequarries north of the city were less than three miles away. How large were they?Two square miles? Certainly they were deserted at this hour! Dropping thecanister there…“Everyone back!” the camerlegno yelled. His chest ached as he ran. “Get away!Now!”The Swiss Guard standing around the chopper stood slack-jawed as the camerlegnoapproached them.“Back!” the priest screamed.The guards moved back.With the entire world watching in wonder, the camerlegno ran around the chopperto the pilot’s door and yanked it open. “Out, son! Now!”The guard jumped out.The camerlegno looked at the high cockpit seat and knew that in his exhaustedstate, he would need both hands to pull himself up. He turned to the pilot,trembling beside him, and thrust the canister into his hands. “Hold this. Handit back when I’m in.”As the camerlegno pulled himself up, he could hear Robert Langdon yellingexcitedly, running toward the craft. Now you understand, the camerlegno thought.Now you have faith!The camerlegno pulled himself up into the cockpit, adjusted a few familiarlevers, and then turned back to his window for the canister.But the guard to whom he had given the canister stood empty-handed. “He tookit!” the guard yelled.The camerlegno felt his heart seize. “Who!”The guard pointed. “Him!”Robert Langdon was surprised by how heavy the canister was. He ran to the otherside of the chopper and jumped in the rear compartment where he and Vittoria hadsat only hours ago. He left the door open and buckled himself in. Then he yelledto the camerlegno in the front seat.“Fly, Father!”The camerlegno craned back at Langdon, his face bloodless with dread. “What areyou doing!”“You fly! I’ll throw!” Langdon barked. “There’s no time! Just fly the blessedchopper!”The camerlegno seemed momentarily paralyzed, the media lights glaring throughthe cockpit darkening the creases in his face. “I can do this alone,” hewhispered. “I am supposed to do this alone.”Langdon wasn’t listening. Fly! he heard himself screaming. Now! I’m here to helpyou! Langdon looked down at the canister and felt his breath catch in his throatwhen he saw the numbers. “Three minutes, Father! Three!”The number seemed to stun the camerlegno back to sobriety. Without hesitation,he turned back to the controls. With a grinding roar, the helicopter lifted off.Through a swirl of dust, Langdon could see Vittoria running toward the chopper.Their eyes met, and then she dropped away like a sinking stone."},{"pageContent":"122Inside the chopper, the whine of the engines and the gale from the open doorassaulted Langdon’s senses with a deafening chaos. He steadied himself againstthe magnified drag of gravity as the camerlegno accelerated the craft straightup. The glow of St. Peter’s Square shrank beneath them until it was an amorphousglowing ellipse radiating in a sea of city lights.The antimatter canister felt like deadweight in Langdon’s hands. He heldtighter, his palms slick now with sweat and blood. Inside the trap, the globuleof antimatter hovered calmly, pulsing red in the glow of the LED countdownclock.“Two minutes!” Langdon yelled, wondering where the camerlegno intended to dropthe canister.The city lights beneath them spread out in all directions. In the distance tothe west, Langdon could see the twinkling delineation of the Mediterraneancoast-a jagged border of luminescence beyond which spread an endless darkexpanse of nothingness. The sea looked farther now than Langdon had imagined.Moreover, the concentration of lights at the coast was a stark reminder thateven far out at sea an explosion might have devastating effects. Langdon had noteven considered the effects of a ten-kiloton tidal wave hitting the coast.When Langdon turned and looked straight ahead through the cockpit window, he wasmore hopeful. Directly in front of them, the rolling shadows of the Romanfoothills loomed in the night. The hills were spotted with lights-the villas ofthe very wealthy-but a mile or so north, the hills grew dark. There were nolights at all-just a huge pocket of blackness. Nothing.The quarries! Langdon thought. La Cava Romana!Staring intently at the barren pocket of land, Langdon sensed that it was plentylarge enough. It seemed close, too. Much closer than the ocean. Excitementsurged through him. This was obviously where the camerlegno planned to take theantimatter! The chopper was pointing directly toward it! The quarries! Oddly,however, as the engines strained louder and the chopper hurtled through the air,Langdon could see that the quarries were not getting any closer. Bewildered, heshot a glance out the side door to get his bearings. What he saw doused hisexcitement in a wave of panic. Directly beneath them, thousands of feet straightdown, glowed the media lights in St. Peter’s Square.We’re still over the Vatican!“Camerlegno!” Langdon choked. “Go forward! We’re high enough! You’ve got tostart moving forward! We can’t drop the canister back over Vatican City!”The camerlegno did not reply. He appeared to be concentrating on flying thecraft.“We’ve got less than two minutes!” Langdon shouted, holding up the canister. “Ican see them! La Cava Romana! A couple of miles north! We don’t have-”“No,” the camerlegno said. “It’s far too dangerous. I’m sorry.” As the choppercontinued to claw heavenward, the camerlegno turned and gave Langdon a mournfulsmile. “I wish you had not come, my friend. You have made the ultimatesacrifice.”Langdon looked in the camerlegno’s exhausted eyes and suddenly understood. Hisblood turned to ice. “But… there must be somewhere we can go!”“Up,” the camerlegno replied, his voice resigned. “It’s the only guarantee.”Langdon could barely think. He had entirely misinterpreted the camerlegno’splan. Look to the heavens!Heaven, Langdon now realized, was literally where he was headed. The camerlegnohad never intended to drop the antimatter. He was simply getting it as far awayfrom Vatican City as humanly possible.This was a one-way trip."},{"pageContent":"123In St. Peter’s Square, Vittoria Vetra stared upward. The helicopter was a specknow, the media lights no longer reaching it. Even the pounding of the rotors hadfaded to a distant hum. It seemed, in that instant, that the entire world wasfocused upward, silenced in anticipation, necks craned to the heavens… allpeoples, all faiths… all hearts beating as one.Vittoria’s emotions were a cyclone of twisting agonies. As the helicopterdisappeared from sight, she pictured Robert’s face, rising above her. What hadhe been thinking? Didn’t he understand?Around the square, television cameras probed the darkness, waiting. A sea offaces stared heavenward, united in a silent countdown. The media screens allflickered the same tranquil scene… a Roman sky illuminated with brilliant stars.Vittoria felt the tears begin to well.Behind her on the marble escarpment, 161 cardinals stared up in silent awe. Somefolded their hands in prayer. Most stood motionless, transfixed. Some wept. Theseconds ticked past.In homes, bars, businesses, airports, hospitals around the world, souls werejoined in universal witness. Men and women locked hands. Others held theirchildren. Time seemed to hover in limbo, souls suspended in unison.Then, cruelly, the bells of St. Peter’s began to toll.Vittoria let the tears come.Then… with the whole world watching… time ran out.The dead silence of the event was the most terrifying of all.High above Vatican City, a pinpoint of light appeared in the sky. For a fleetinginstant, a new heavenly body had been born… a speck of light as pure and whiteas anyone had ever seen.Then it happened.A flash. The point billowed, as if feeding on itself, unraveling across the skyin a dilating radius of blinding white. It shot out in all directions,accelerating with incomprehensible speed, gobbling up the dark. As the sphere oflight grew, it intensified, like a burgeoning fiend preparing to consume theentire sky. It raced downward, toward them, picking up speed.Blinded, the multitudes of starkly lit human faces gasped as one, shieldingtheir eyes, crying out in strangled fear.As the light roared out in all directions, the unimaginable occurred. As ifbound by God’s own will, the surging radius seemed to hit a wall. It was as ifthe explosion were contained somehow in a giant glass sphere. The lightrebounded inward, sharpening, rippling across itself. The wave appeared to havereached a predetermined diameter and hovered there. For that instant, a perfectand silent sphere of light glowed over Rome. Night had become day.Then it hit.The concussion was deep and hollow-a thunderous shock wave from above. Itdescended on them like the wrath of hell, shaking the granite foundation ofVatican City, knocking the breath out of people’s lungs, sending othersstumbling backward. The reverberation circled the colonnade, followed by asudden torrent of warm air. The wind tore through the square, letting out asepulchral moan as it whistled through the columns and buffeted the walls. Dustswirled overhead as people huddled… witnesses to Armageddon.Then, as fast as it appeared, the sphere imploded, sucking back in on itself,crushing inward to the tiny point of light from which it had come."},{"pageContent":"124Never before had so many been so silent.The faces in St. Peter’s Square, one by one, averted their eyes from thedarkening sky and turned downward, each person in his or her own private momentof wonder. The media lights followed suit, dropping their beams back to earth asif out of reverence for the blackness now settling upon them. It seemed for amoment the entire world was bowing its head in unison.Cardinal Mortati knelt to pray, and the other cardinals joined him. The SwissGuard lowered their long swords and stood numb. No one spoke. No one moved.Everywhere, hearts shuddered with spontaneous emotion. Bereavement. Fear.Wonder. Belief. And a dread-filled respect for the new and awesome power theyhad just witnessed.Vittoria Vetra stood trembling at the foot of the basilica’s sweeping stairs.She closed her eyes. Through the tempest of emotions now coursing through herblood, a single word tolled like a distant bell. Pristine. Cruel. She forced itaway. And yet the word echoed. Again she drove it back. The pain was too great.She tried to lose herself in the images that blazed in other’s minds…antimatter’s mind-boggling power… the Vatican’s deliverance… the camerlegno…feats of bravery… miracles… selflessness. And still the word echoed… tollingthrough the chaos with a stinging loneliness.Robert.He had come for her at Castle St. Angelo.He had saved her.And now he had been destroyed by her creation.As Cardinal Mortati prayed, he wondered if he too would hear God’s voice as thecamerlegno had. Does one need to believe in miracles to experience them? Mortatiwas a modern man in an ancient faith. Miracles had never played a part in hisbelief. Certainly his faith spoke of miracles… bleeding palms, ascensions fromthe dead, imprints on shrouds… and yet, Mortati’s rational mind had alwaysjustified these accounts as part of the myth. They were simply the result ofman’s greatest weakness-his need for proof. Miracles were nothing but stories weall clung to because we wished they were true.And yet…Am I so modern that I cannot accept what my eyes have just witnessed? It was amiracle, was it not? Yes! God, with a few whispered words in the camerlegno’sear, had intervened and saved this church. Why was this so hard to believe? Whatwould it say about God if God had done nothing? That the Almighty did not care?That He was powerless to stop it? A miracle was the only possible response!As Mortati knelt in wonder, he prayed for the camerlegno’s soul. He gave thanksto the young chamberlain who, even in his youthful years, had opened this oldman’s eyes to the miracles of unquestioning faith.Incredibly, though, Mortati never suspected the extent to which his faith wasabout to be tested…The silence of St. Peter’s Square broke with a ripple at first. The ripple grewto a murmur. And then, suddenly, to a roar. Without warning, the multitudes werecrying out as one.“Look! Look!”Mortati opened his eyes and turned to the crowd. Everyone was pointing behindhim, toward the front of St. Peter’s Basilica. Their faces were white. Some fellto their knees. Some fainted. Some burst into uncontrollable sobs.“Look! Look!”Mortati turned, bewildered, following their outstretched hands. They werepointing to the uppermost level of the basilica, the rooftop terrace, where hugestatues of Christ and his apostles watched over the crowd.There, on the right of Jesus, arms outstretched to the world… stood CamerlegnoCarlo Ventresca."},{"pageContent":"125Robert Langdon was no longer falling.There was no more terror. No pain. Not even the sound of the racing wind. Therewas only the soft sound of lapping water, as though he were comfortably asleepon a beach.In a paradox of self-awareness, Langdon sensed this was death. He felt glad forit. He allowed the drifting numbness to possess him entirely. He let it carryhim wherever it was he would go. His pain and fear had been anesthetized, and hedid not wish it back at any price. His final memory had been one that could onlyhave been conjured in hell.Take me. Please…But the lapping that lulled in him a far-off sense of peace was also pulling himback. It was trying to awaken him from a dream. No! Let me be! He did not wantto awaken. He sensed demons gathering on the perimeter of his bliss, pounding toshatter his rapture. Fuzzy images swirled. Voices yelled. Wind churned. No,please! The more he fought, the more the fury filtered through.Then, harshly, he was living it all again…The helicopter was in a dizzying dead climb. He was trapped inside. Beyond theopen door, the lights of Rome looked farther away with every passing second. Hissurvival instinct told him to jettison the canister right now. Langdon knew itwould take less than twenty seconds for the canister to fall half a mile. But itwould be falling toward a city of people.Higher! Higher!Langdon wondered how high they were now. Small prop planes, he knew, flew ataltitudes of about four miles. This helicopter had to be at a good fraction ofthat by now. Two miles up? Three? There wasstill a chance. If they timed thedrop perfectly, the canister would fall only partway toward earth, exploding asafe distance over the ground and away from the chopper. Langdon looked out atthe city sprawling below them.“And if you calculate incorrectly?” the camerlegno said.Langdon turned, startled. The camerlegno was not even looking at him, apparentlyhaving read Langdon’s thoughts from the ghostly reflection in the windshield.Oddly, the camerlegno was no longer engrossed in his controls. His hands werenot even on the throttle. The chopper, it seemed, was now in some sort ofautopilot mode, locked in a climb. The camerlegno reached above his head, to theceiling of the cockpit, fishing behind a cable-housing, where he removed a key,taped there out of view.Langdon watched in bewilderment as the camerlegno quickly unlocked the metalcargo box bolted between the seats. He removed some sort of large, black, nylonpack. He lay it on the seat next to him. Langdon’s thoughts churned. Thecamerlegno’s movements seemed composed, as if he had a solution.“Give me the canister,” the camerlegno said, his tone serene.Langdon did not know what to think anymore. He thrust the canister to thecamerlegno. “Ninety seconds!”What the camerlegno did with the antimatter took Langdon totally by surprise.Holding the canister carefully in his hands, the camerlegno placed it inside thecargo box. Then he closed the heavy lid and used the key to lock it tight.“What are you doing!” Langdon demanded.“Leading us from temptation.” The camerlegno threw the key out the open window.As the key tumbled into the night, Langdon felt his soul falling with it.The camerlegno then took the nylon pack and slipped his arms through the straps.He fastened a waist clamp around his stomach and cinched it all down like abackpack. He turned to a dumbstruck Robert Langdon.“I’m sorry,” the camerlegno said. “It wasn’t supposed to happen this way.” Thenhe opened his door and hurled himself into the night.The image burned in Langdon’s unconscious mind, and with it came the pain. Realpain. Physical pain. Aching. Searing. He begged to be taken, to let it end, butas the water lapped louder in his ears, new images began to flash. His hell hadonly just begun. He saw bits and pieces. Scattered frames of sheer panic. He layhalfway between death and nightmare, begging for deliverance, but the picturesgrew brighter in his mind.The antimatter canister was locked out of reach. It counted relentlesslydownward as the chopper shot upward. Fifty seconds. Higher. Higher. Langdon spunwildly in the cabin, trying to make sense of what he had just seen. Forty-fiveseconds. He dug under seats searching for another parachute. Forty seconds.There was none! There had to be an option! Thirty-five seconds. He raced to theopen doorway of the chopper and stood in the raging wind, gazing down at thelights of Rome below. Thirty-two seconds.And then he made the choice.The unbelievable choice…With no parachute, Robert Langdon had jumped out the door. As the nightswallowed his tumbling body, the helicopter seemed to rocket off above him, thesound of its rotors evaporating in the deafening rush of his own free fall.As he plummeted toward earth, Robert Langdon felt something he had notexperienced since his years on the high dive-the inexorable pull of gravityduring a dead drop. The faster he fell, the harder the earth seemed to pull,sucking him down. This time, however, the drop was not fifty feet into a pool.The drop was thousands of feet into a city-an endless expanse of pavement andconcrete.Somewhere in the torrent of wind and desperation, Kohler’s voice echoed from thegrave… words he had spoken earlier this morning standing at CERN’s free-falltube. One square yard of drag will slow a falling body almost twenty percent.Twenty percent, Langdon now realized, was not even close to what one would needto survive a fall like this. Nonetheless, more out of paralysis than hope, heclenched in his hands the sole object he had grabbed from the chopper on his wayout the door. It was an odd memento, but it was one that for a fleeting instanthad given him hope.The windshield tarp had been lying in the back of the helicopter. It was aconcave rectangle-about four yards by two-like a huge fitted sheet… the crudestapproximation of a parachute imaginable. It had no harness, only bungie loops ateither end for fastening it to the curvature of the windshield. Langdon hadgrabbed it, slid his hands through the loops, held on, and leapt out into thevoid.His last great act of youthful defiance.No illusions of life beyond this moment.Langdon fell like a rock. Feet first. Arms raised. His hands gripping the loops.The tarp billowed like a mushroom overhead. The wind tore past him violently.As he plummeted toward earth, there was a deep explosion somewhere above him. Itseemed farther off than he had expected. Almost instantly, the shock wave hit.He felt the breath crushed from his lungs. There was a sudden warmth in the airall around him. He fought to hold on. A wall of heat raced down from above. Thetop of the tarp began to smolder… but held.Langdon rocketed downward, on the edge of a billowing shroud of light, feelinglike a surfer trying to outrun a thousand-foot tidal wave. Then suddenly, theheat receded.He was falling again through the dark coolness.For an instant, Langdon felt hope. A moment later, though, that hope faded likethe withdrawing heat above. Despite his straining arms assuring him that thetarp was slowing his fall, the wind still tore past his body with deafeningvelocity. Langdon had no doubt he was still moving too fast to survive the fall.He would be crushed when he hit the ground.Mathematical figures tumbled through his brain, but he was too numb to makesense of them… one square yard of drag… 20 percent reduction of speed. AllLangdon could figure was that the tarp over his head was big enough to slow himmore than 20 percent. Unfortunately, though, he could tell from the windwhipping past him that whatever good the tarp was doing was not enough. He wasstill falling fast… there would be no surviving the impact on the waiting sea ofconcrete.Beneath him, the lights of Rome spread out in all directions. The city lookedlike an enormous starlit sky that Langdon was falling into. The perfect expanseof stars was marred only by a dark strip that split the city in two-a wide,unlit ribbon that wound through the dots of light like a fat snake. Langdonstared down at the meandering swatch of black.Suddenly, like the surging crest of an unexpected wave, hope filled him again.With almost maniacal vigor, Langdon yanked down hard with his right hand on thecanopy. The tarp suddenly flapped louder, billowing, cutting right to find thepath of least resistance. Langdon felt himself drifting sideways. He pulledagain, harder, ignoring the pain in his palm. The tarp flared, and Langdonsensed his body sliding laterally. Not much. But some! He looked beneath himagain, to the sinuous serpent of black. It was off to the right, but he wasstill pretty high. Had he waited too long? He pulled with all his might andaccepted somehow that it was now in the hands of God. He focused hard on thewidest part of the serpent and… for the first time in his life, prayed for amiracle.The rest was a blur.The darkness rushing up beneath him… the diving instincts coming back… thereflexive locking of his spine and pointing of the toes… the inflating of hislungs to protect his vital organs… the flexing of his legs into a battering ram…and finally… the thankfulness that the winding Tiber River was raging… makingits waters frothy and air-filled… and three times softer than standing water.Then there was impact… and blackness.It had been the thundering sound of the flapping canopy that drew the group’seyes away from the fireball in the sky. The sky above Rome had been filled withsights tonight… a skyrocketing helicopter, an enormous explosion, and now thisstrange object that had plummeted into the churning waters of the Tiber River,directly off the shore of the river’s tiny island, Isola Tiberina.Ever since the island had been used to quarantine the sick during the Romanplague of A.D. 1656, it had been thought to have mystic healing properties. Forthis reason, the island had later become the site for Rome’s Hospital Tiberina.The body was battered when they pulled it onto shore. The man still had a faintpulse, which was amazing, they thought. They wondered if it was Isola Tiberina’smythical reputation for healing that had somehow kept his heart pumping. Minuteslater, when the man began coughing and slowly regained consciousness, the groupdecided the island must indeed be magical."},{"pageContent":"126Cardinal Mortati knew there were no words in any language that could have addedto the mystery of this moment. The silence of the vision over St. Peter’s Squaresang louder than any chorus of angels.As he stared up at Camerlegno Ventresca, Mortati felt the paralyzing collisionof his heart and mind. The vision seemed real, tangible. And yet… how could itbe? Everyone had seen the camerlegno get in the helicopter. They had allwitnessed the ball of light in the sky. And now, somehow, the camerlegno stoodhigh above them on the rooftop terrace. Transported by angels? Reincarnated bythe hand of God?This is impossible…Mortati’s heart wanted nothing more than to believe, but his mind cried out forreason. And yet all around him, the cardinals stared up, obviously seeing whathe was seeing, paralyzed with wonder.It was the camerlegno. There was no doubt. But he looked different somehow.Divine. As if he had been purified. A spirit? A man? His white flesh shone inthe spotlights with an incorporeal weightlessness.In the square there was crying, cheering, spontaneous applause. A group of nunsfell to their knees and wailed saetas. A pulsing grew from in the crowd.Suddenly, the entire square was chanting the camerlegno’s name. The cardinals,some with tears rolling down their faces, joined in. Mortati looked around himand tried to comprehend. Is this really happening?Camerlegno Carlo Ventresca stood on the rooftop terrace of St. Peter’s Basilicaand looked down over the multitudes of people staring up at him. Was he awake ordreaming? He felt transformed, otherworldly. He wondered if it was his body orjust his spirit that had floated down from heaven toward the soft, darkenedexpanse of the Vatican City Gardens… alighting like a silent angel on thedeserted lawns, his black parachute shrouded from the madness by the toweringshadow of St. Peter’s Basilica. He wondered if it was his body or his spiritthat had possessed the strength to climb the ancient Stairway of Medallions tothe rooftop terrace where he now stood.He felt as light as a ghost.Although the people below were chanting his name, he knew it was not him theywere cheering. They were cheering from impulsive joy, the same kind of joy hefelt every day of his life as he pondered the Almighty. They were experiencingwhat each of them had always longed for… an assurance of the beyond… asubstantiation of the power of the Creator.Camerlegno Ventresca had prayed all his life for this moment, and still, even hecould not fathom that God had found a way to make it manifest. He wanted to cryout to them. Your God is a living God! Behold the miracles all around you!He stood there a while, numb and yet feeling more than he had ever felt. When,at last, the spirit moved him, he bowed his head and stepped back from the edge.Alone now, he knelt on the roof, and prayed."},{"pageContent":"127The images around him blurred, drifting in and out. Langdon’s eyes slowly beganto focus. His legs ached, and his body felt like it had been run over by atruck. He was lying on his side on the ground. Something stunk, like bile. Hecould still hear the incessant sound of lapping water. It no longer soundedpeaceful to him. There were other sounds too-talking close around him. He sawblurry white forms. Were they all wearing white? Langdon decided he was eitherin an asylum or heaven. From the burning in his throat, Langdon decided it couldnot be heaven.“He’s finished vomiting,” one man said in Italian. “Turn him.” The voice wasfirm and professional.Langdon felt hands slowly rolling him onto his back. His head swam. He tried tosit up, but the hands gently forced him back down. His body submitted. ThenLangdon felt someone going through his pockets, removing items.Then he passed out cold.Dr. Jacobus was not a religious man; the science of medicine had bred that fromhim long ago. And yet, the events in Vatican City tonight had put his systematiclogic to the test. Now bodies are falling from the sky?Dr. Jacobus felt the pulse of the bedraggled man they had just pulled from theTiber River. The doctor decided that God himself had hand-delivered this one tosafety. The concussion of hitting the water had knocked the victim unconscious,and if it had not been for Jacobus and his crew standing out on the shorewatching the spectacle in the sky, this falling soul would surely have goneunnoticed and drowned.“Й Americano,” a nurse said, going through the man’s wallet after they pulledhim to dry land.American? Romans often joked that Americans had gotten so abundant in Rome thathamburgers should become the official Italian food. But Americans falling fromthe sky? Jacobus flicked a penlight in the man’s eyes, testing his dilation.“Sir? Can you hear me? Do you know where you are?”The man was unconscious again. Jacobus was not surprised. The man had vomited alot of water after Jacobus had performed CPR.“Si chiama Robert Langdon,” the nurse said, reading the man’s driver’s license.The group assembled on the dock all stopped short.“Impossibile!” Jacobus declared. Robert Langdon was the man from thetelevision-the American professor who had been helping the Vatican. Jacobus hadseen Mr. Langdon, only minutes ago, getting into a helicopter in St. Peter’sSquare and flying miles up into the air. Jacobus and the others had run out tothe dock to witness the antimatter explosion-a tremendous sphere of light likenothing any of them had ever seen. How could this be the same man!“It’s him!” the nurse exclaimed, brushing his soaked hair back. “And I recognizehis tweed coat!”Suddenly someone was yelling from the hospital entryway. It was one of thepatients. She was screaming, going mad, holding her portable radio to the skyand praising God. Apparently Camerlegno Ventresca had just miraculously appearedon the roof of the Vatican.Dr. Jacobus decided, when his shift got off at 8 A.M., he was going straight tochurch.The lights over Langdon’s head were brighter now, sterile. He was on some kindof examination table. He smelled astringents, strange chemicals. Someone hadjust given him an injection, and they had removed his clothes.Definitely not gypsies, he decided in his semiconscious delirium. Aliens,perhaps? Yes, he had heard about things like this. Fortunately these beingswould not harm him. All they wanted were his-“Not on your life!” Langdon sat bolt upright, eyes flying open.“Attento!” one of the creatures yelled, steadying him. His badge read Dr.Jacobus. He looked remarkably human.Langdon stammered, “I… thought…”“Easy, Mr. Langdon. You’re in a hospital.”The fog began to lift. Langdon felt a wave of relief. He hated hospitals, butthey certainly beat aliens harvesting his testicles.“My name is Dr. Jacobus,” the man said. He explained what had just happened.“You are very lucky to be alive.”Langdon did not feel lucky. He could barely make sense of his own memories… thehelicopter… the camerlegno. His body ached everywhere. They gave him some water,and he rinsed out his mouth. They placed a new gauze on his palm.“Where are my clothes?” Langdon asked. He was wearing a paper robe.One of the nurses motioned to a dripping wad of shredded khaki and tweed on thecounter. “They were soaked. We had to cut them off you.”Langdon looked at his shredded Harris tweed and frowned.“You had some Kleenex in your pocket,” the nurse said.It was then that Langdon saw the ravaged shreds of parchment clinging all overthe lining of his jacket. The folio from Galileo’s Diagramma. The last copy onearth had just dissolved. He was too numb to know how to react. He just stared.“We saved your personal items.” She held up a plastic bin. “Wallet, camcorder,and pen. I dried the camcorder off the best I could.”“I don’t own a camcorder.”The nurse frowned and held out the bin. Langdon looked at the contents. Alongwith his wallet and pen was a tiny Sony RUVI camcorder. He recalled it now.Kohler had handed it to him and asked him to give it to the media.“We found it in your pocket. I think you’ll need a new one, though.” The nurseflipped open the two-inch screen on the back. “Your viewer is cracked.” Then shebrightened. “The sound still works, though. Barely.” She held the device up toher ear. “Keeps playing something over and over.” She listened a moment and thenscowled, handing it to Langdon. “Two guys arguing, I think.”Puzzled, Langdon took the camcorder and held it to his ear. The voices werepinched and metallic, but they were discernible. One close. One far away.Langdon recognized them both.Sitting there in his paper gown, Langdon listened in amazement to theconversation. Although he couldn’t see what was happening, when he heard theshocking finale, he was thankful he had been spared the visual.My God!As the conversation began playing again from the beginning, Langdon lowered thecamcorder from his ear and sat in appalled mystification. The antimatter… thehelicopter… Langdon’s mind now kicked into gear.But that means…He wanted to vomit again. With a rising fury of disorientation and rage, Langdongot off the table and stood on shaky legs.“Mr. Langdon!” the doctor said, trying to stop him.“I need some clothes,” Langdon demanded, feeling the draft on his rear from thebackless gown.“But, you need to rest.”“I’m checking out. Now. I need some clothes.”“But, sir, you-”“Now!”Everyone exchanged bewildered looks. “We have no clothes,” the doctor said.“Perhaps tomorrow a friend could bring you some.”Langdon drew a slow patient breath and locked eyes with the doctor. “Dr.Jacobus, I am walking out your door right now. I need clothes. I am going toVatican City. One does not go to Vatican City with one’s ass hanging out. Do Imake myself clear?”Dr. Jacobus swallowed hard. “Get this man something to wear.”When Langdon limped out of Hospital Tiberina, he felt like an overgrown CubScout. He was wearing a blue paramedic’s jumpsuit that zipped up the front andwas adorned with cloth badges that apparently depicted his numerousqualifications.The woman accompanying him was heavyset and wore a similar suit. The doctor hadassured Langdon she would get him to the Vatican in record time.“Molto traffico,” Langdon said, reminding her that the area around the Vaticanwas packed with cars and people.The woman looked unconcerned. She pointed proudly to one of her patches. “Sonoconducente di ambulanza.”“Ambulanza?” That explained it. Langdon felt like he could use an ambulanceride.The woman led him around the side of the building. On an outcropping over thewater was a cement deck where her vehicle sat waiting. When Langdon saw thevehicle he stopped in his tracks. It was an aging medevac chopper. The hull readAero-Ambulanza.He hung his head.The woman smiled. “Fly Vatican City. Very fast.”"},{"pageContent":"128The College of Cardinals bristled with ebullience and electricity as theystreamed back into the Sistine Chapel. In contrast, Mortati felt in himself arising confusion he thought might lift him off the floor and carry him away. Hebelieved in the ancient miracles of the Scriptures, and yet what he had justwitnessed in person was something he could not possibly comprehend. After alifetime of devotion, seventy-nine years, Mortati knew these events shouldignite in him a pious exuberance… a fervent and living faith. And yet all hefelt was a growing spectral unease. Something did not feel right.“Signore Mortati!” a Swiss Guard yelled, running down the hall. “We have gone tothe roof as you asked. The camerlegno is… flesh! He is a true man! He is not aspirit! He is exactly as we knew him!”“Did he speak to you?”“He kneels in silent prayer! We are afraid to touch him!”Mortati was at a loss. “Tell him… his cardinals await.”“Signore, because he is a man…” the guard hesitated.“What is it?”“His chest… he is burned. Should we bind his wounds? He must be in pain.”Mortati considered it. Nothing in his lifetime of service to the church hadprepared him for this situation. “He is a man, so serve him as a man. Bathe him.Bind his wounds. Dress him in fresh robes. We await his arrival in the SistineChapel.”The guard ran off.Mortati headed for the chapel. The rest of the cardinals were inside now. As hewalked down the hall, he saw Vittoria Vetra slumped alone on a bench at the footof the Royal Staircase. He could see the pain and loneliness of her loss andwanted to go to her, but he knew it would have to wait. He had work to do…although he had no idea what that work could possibly be.Mortati entered the chapel. There was a riotous excitement. He closed the door.God help me.Hospital Tiberina’s twin-rotor Aero-Ambulanza circled in behind Vatican City,and Langdon clenched his teeth, swearing to God this was the very lasthelicopter ride of his life.After convincing the pilot that the rules governing Vatican airspace were theleast of the Vatican’s concerns right now, he guided her in, unseen, over therear wall, and landed them on the Vatican’s helipad.“Grazie,” he said, lowering himself painfully onto the ground. She blew him akiss and quickly took off, disappearing back over the wall and into the night.Langdon exhaled, trying to clear his head, hoping to make sense of what he wasabout to do. With the camcorder in hand, he boarded the same golf cart he hadridden earlier that day. It had not been charged, and the battery-meterregistered close to empty. Langdon drove without headlights to conserve power.He also preferred no one see him coming.At the back of the Sistine Chapel, Cardinal Mortati stood in a daze as hewatched the pandemonium before him.“It was a miracle!” one of the cardinals shouted. “The work of God!”“Yes!” others exclaimed. “God has made His will manifest!”“The camerlegno will be our Pope!” another shouted. “He is not a cardinal, butGod has sent a miraculous sign!”“Yes!” someone agreed. “The laws of conclave are man’s laws. God’s will isbefore us! I call for a balloting immediately!”“A balloting?” Mortati demanded, moving toward them. “I believe that is my job.”Everyone turned.Mortati could sense the cardinals studying him. They seemed distant, at a loss,offended by his sobriety. Mortati longed to feel his heart swept up in themiraculous exultation he saw in the faces around him. But he was not. He felt aninexplicable pain in his soul… an aching sadness he could not explain. He hadvowed to guide these proceedings with purity of soul, and this hesitancy wassomething he could not deny.“My friends,” Mortati said, stepping to the altar. His voice did not seem hisown. “I suspect I will struggle for the rest of my days with the meaning of whatI have witnessed tonight. And yet, what you are suggesting regarding thecamerlegno… it cannot possibly be God’s will.”The room fell silent.“How… can you say that?” one of the cardinals finally demanded. “The camerlegnosaved the church. God spoke to the camerlegno directly! The man survived deathitself! What sign do we need!”“The camerlegno is coming to us now,” Mortati said. “Let us wait. Let us hearhim before we have a balloting. There may be an explanation.”“An explanation?”“As your Great Elector, I have vowed to uphold the laws of conclave. You are nodoubt aware that by Holy Law the camerlegno is ineligible for election to thepapacy. He is not a cardinal. He is a priest… a chamberlain. There is also thequestion of his inadequate age.” Mortati felt the stares hardening. “By evenallowing a balloting, I would be requesting that you endorse a man who VaticanLaw proclaims ineligible. I would be asking each of you to break a sacred oath.”“But what happened here tonight,” someone stammered, “it certainly transcendsour laws!”“Does it?” Mortati boomed, not even knowing now where his words were comingfrom. “Is it God’s will that we discard the rules of the church? Is it God’swill that we abandon reason and give ourselves over to frenzy?”“But did you not see what we saw?” another challenged angrily. “How can youpresume to question that kind of power!”Mortati’s voice bellowed now with a resonance he had never known. “I am notquestioning God’s power! It is God who gave us reason and circumspection! It isGod we serve by exercising prudence!”"},{"pageContent":"129In the hallway outside the Sistine Chapel, Vittoria Vetra sat benumbed on abench at the foot of the Royal Staircase. When she saw the figure coming throughthe rear door, she wondered if she were seeing another spirit. He was bandaged,limping, and wearing some kind of medical suit.She stood… unable to believe the vision. “Ro… bert?”He never answered. He strode directly to her and wrapped her in his arms. Whenhe pressed his lips to hers, it was an impulsive, longing kiss filled withthankfulness.Vittoria felt the tears coming. “Oh, God… oh, thank God…”He kissed her again, more passionately, and she pressed against him, losingherself in his embrace. Their bodies locked, as if they had known each other foryears. She forgot the fear and pain. She closed her eyes, weightless in themoment.“It is God’s will!” someone was yelling, his voice echoing in the SistineChapel. “Who but the chosen one could have survived that diabolical explosion?”“Me,” a voice reverberated from the back of the chapel.Mortati and the others turned in wonder at the bedraggled form coming up thecenter aisle. “Mr… Langdon?”Without a word, Langdon walked slowly to the front of the chapel. Vittoria Vetraentered too. Then two guards hurried in, pushing a cart with a large televisionon it. Langdon waited while they plugged it in, facing the cardinals. ThenLangdon motioned for the guards to leave. They did, closing the door behindthem.Now it was only Langdon, Vittoria, and the cardinals. Langdon plugged the SonyRUVI’s output into the television. Then he pressed PLAY.The television blared to life.The scene that materialized before the cardinals revealed the Pope’s office. Thevideo had been awkwardly filmed, as if by hidden camera. Off center on thescreen the camerlegno stood in the dimness, in front of a fire. Although heappeared to be talking directly to the camera, it quickly became evident that hewas speaking to someone else-whoever was making this video. Langdon told themthe video was filmed by Maximilian Kohler, the director of CERN. Only an hourago Kohler had secretly recorded his meeting with the camerlegno by using a tinycamcorder covertly mounted under the arm of his wheelchair.Mortati and the cardinals watched in bewilderment. Although the conversation wasalready in progress, Langdon did not bother to rewind. Apparently, whateverLangdon wanted the cardinals to see was coming up…“Leonardo Vetra kept diaries?” the camerlegno was saying. “I suppose that isgood news for CERN. If the diaries contain his processes for creatingantimatter-”“They don’t,” Kohler said. “You will be relieved to know those processes diedwith Leonardo. However, his diaries spoke of something else. You.”The camerlegno looked troubled. “I don’t understand.”“They described a meeting Leonardo had last month. With you.”The camerlegno hesitated, then looked toward the door. “Rocher should not havegranted you access without consulting me. How did you get in here?”“Rocher knows the truth. I called earlier and told him what you have done.”“What I have done? Whatever story you told him, Rocher is a Swiss Guard and fartoo faithful to this church to believe a bitter scientist over his camerlegno.”“Actually, he is too faithful not to believe. He is so faithful that despite theevidence that one of his loyal guards had betrayed the church, he refused toaccept it. All day long he has been searching for another explanation.”“So you gave him one.”“The truth. Shocking as it was.”“If Rocher believed you, he would have arrested me.”“No. I wouldn’t let him. I offered him my silence in exchange for this meeting.”The camerlegno let out an odd laugh. “You plan to blackmail the church with astory that no one will possibly believe?”“I have no need of blackmail. I simply want to hear the truth from your lips.Leonardo Vetra was a friend.”The camerlegno said nothing. He simply stared down at Kohler.“Try this,” Kohler snapped. “About a month ago, Leonardo Vetra contacted yourequesting an urgent audience with the Pope-an audience you granted because thePope was an admirer of Leonardo’s work and because Leonardo said it was anemergency.”The camerlegno turned to the fire. He said nothing.“Leonardo came to the Vatican in great secrecy. He was betraying his daughter’sconfidence by coming here, a fact that troubled him deeply, but he felt he hadno choice. His research had left him deeply conflicted and in need of spiritualguidance from the church. In a private meeting, he told you and the Pope that hehad made a scientific discovery with profound religious implications. He hadproved Genesis was physically possible, and that intense sources of energy-whatVetra called God-could duplicate the moment of Creation.”Silence.“The Pope was stunned,” Kohler continued. “He wanted Leonardo to go public. HisHoliness thought this discovery might begin to bridge the gap between scienceand religion-one of the Pope’s life dreams. Then Leonardo explained to you thedownside-the reason he required the church’s guidance. It seemed his Creationexperiment, exactly as your Bible predicts, produced everything in pairs.Opposites. Light and dark. Vetra found himself, in addition to creating matter,creating antimatter. Shall I go on?”The camerlegno was silent. He bent down and stoked the coals.“After Leonardo Vetra came here,” Kohler said, “you came to CERN to see hiswork. Leonardo’s diaries said you made a personal trip to his lab.”The camerlegno looked up.Kohler went on. “The Pope could not travel without attracting media attention,so he sent you. Leonardo gave you a secret tour of his lab. He showed you anantimatter annihilation-the Big Bang-the power of Creation. He also showed you alarge specimen he kept locked away as proof that his new process could produceantimatter on a large scale. You were in awe. You returned to Vatican City toreport to the Pope what you had witnessed.”The camerlegno sighed. “And what is it that troubles you? That I would respectLeonardo’s confidentiality by pretending before the world tonight that I knewnothing of antimatter?”“No! It troubles me that Leonardo Vetra practically proved the existence of yourGod, and you had him murdered!”The camerlegno turned now, his face revealing nothing.The only sound was the crackle of the fire.Suddenly, the camera jiggled, and Kohler’s arm appeared in the frame. He leanedforward, seeming to struggle with something affixed beneath his wheelchair. Whenhe sat back down, he held a pistol out before him. The camera angle was achilling one… looking from behind… down the length of the outstretched gun…directly at the camerlegno.Kohler said, “Confess your sins, Father. Now.”The camerlegno looked startled. “You will never get out of here alive.”“Death would be a welcome relief from the misery your faith has put me throughsince I was a boy.” Kohler held the gun with both hands now. “I am giving you achoice. Confess your sins… or die right now.”The camerlegno glanced toward the door.“Rocher is outside,” Kohler challenged. “He too is prepared to kill you.”“Rocher is a sworn protector of th-”“Rocher let me in here. Armed. He is sickened by your lies. You have a singleoption. Confess to me. I have to hear it from your very lips.”The camerlegno hesitated.Kohler cocked his gun. “Do you really doubt I will kill you?”“No matter what I tell you,” the camerlegno said, “a man like you will neverunderstand.”“Try me.”The camerlegno stood still for a moment, a dominant silhouette in the dim lightof the fire. When he spoke, his words echoed with a dignity more suited to theglorious recounting of altruism than that of a confession.“Since the beginning of time,” the camerlegno said, “this church has fought theenemies of God. Sometimes with words. Sometimes with swords. And we have alwayssurvived.”The camerlegno radiated conviction.“But the demons of the past,” he continued, “were demons of fire andabomination… they were enemies we could fight-enemies who inspired fear. YetSatan is shrewd. As time passed, he cast off his diabolical countenance for anew face… the face of pure reason. Transparent and insidious, but soulless allthe same.” The camerlegno’s voice flashed sudden anger-an almost maniacaltransition. “Tell me, Mr. Kohler! How can the church condemn that which makeslogical sense to our minds! How can we decry that which is now the veryfoundation of our society! Each time the church raises its voice in warning, youshout back, calling us ignorant. Paranoid. Controlling! And so your evil grows.Shrouded in a veil of self-righteous intellectualism. It spreads like a cancer.Sanctified by the miracles of its own technology. Deifying itself! Until we nolonger suspect you are anything but pure goodness. Science has come to save usfrom our sickness, hunger, and pain! Behold science-the new God of endlessmiracles, omnipotent and benevolent! Ignore the weapons and the chaos. Forgetthe fractured loneliness and endless peril. Science is here!” The camerlegnostepped toward the gun. “But I have seen Satan’s face lurking… I have seen theperil…”“What are you talking about! Vetra’s science practically proved the existence ofyour God! He was your ally!”“Ally? Science and religion are not in this together! We do not seek the sameGod, you and I! Who is your God? One of protons, masses, and particle charges?How does your God inspire? How does your God reach into the hearts of man andremind him he is accountable to a greater power! Remind him that he isaccountable to his fellow man! Vetra was misguided. His work was not religious,it was sacrilegious! Man cannot put God’s Creation in a test tube and wave itaround for the world to see! This does not glorify God, it demeans God!” Thecamerlegno was clawing at his body now, his voice manic.“And so you had Leonardo Vetra killed!”“For the church! For all mankind! The madness of it! Man is not ready to holdthe power of Creation in his hands. God in a test tube? A droplet of liquid thatcan vaporize an entire city? He had to be stopped!” The camerlegno fell abruptlysilent. He looked away, back toward the fire. He seemed to be contemplating hisoptions.Kohler’s hands leveled the gun. “You have confessed. You have no escape.”The camerlegno laughed sadly. “Don’t you see. Confessing your sins is theescape.” He looked toward the door. “When God is on your side, you have optionsa man like you could never comprehend.” With his words still hanging in the air,the camerlegno grabbed the neck of his cassock and violently tore it open,revealing his bare chest.Kohler jolted, obviously startled. “What are you doing!”The camerlegno did not reply. He stepped backward, toward the fireplace, andremoved an object from the glowing embers.“Stop!” Kohler demanded, his gun still leveled. “What are you doing!”When the camerlegno turned, he was holding a red-hot brand. The IlluminatiDiamond. The man’s eyes looked wild suddenly. “I had intended to do this allalone.” His voice seethed with a feral intensity. “But now… I see God meant foryou to be here. You are my salvation.”Before Kohler could react, the camerlegno closed his eyes, arched his back, andrammed the red hot brand into the center of his own chest. His flesh hissed.“Mother Mary! Blessed Mother… Behold your son!” He screamed out in agony.Kohler lurched into the frame now… standing awkwardly on his feet, gun waveringwildly before him.The camerlegno screamed louder, teetering in shock. He threw the brand atKohler’s feet. Then the priest collapsed on the floor, writhing in agony.What happened next was a blur.There was a great flurry onscreen as the Swiss Guard burst into the room. Thesoundtrack exploded with gunfire. Kohler clutched his chest, blown backward,bleeding, falling into his wheelchair.“No!” Rocher called, trying to stop his guards from firing on Kohler.The camerlegno, still writhing on the floor, rolled and pointed frantically atRocher. “Illuminatus!”“You bastard,” Rocher yelled, running at him. “You sanctimonious bas-”Chartrand cut him down with three bullets. Rocher slid dead across the floor.Then the guards ran to the wounded camerlegno, gathering around him. As theyhuddled, the video caught the face of a dazed Robert Langdon, kneeling besidethe wheelchair, looking at the brand. Then, the entire frame began lurchingwildly. Kohler had regained consciousness and was detaching the tiny camcorderfrom its holder under the arm of the wheelchair. Then he tried to hand thecamcorder to Langdon.“G-give…” Kohler gasped. “G-give this to the m-media.”Then the screen went blank."},{"pageContent":"130The camerlegno began to feel the fog of wonder and adrenaline dissipating. Asthe Swiss Guard helped him down the Royal Staircase toward the Sistine Chapel,the camerlegno heard singing in St. Peter’s Square and he knew that mountainshad been moved.Grazie Dio.He had prayed for strength, and God had given it to him. At moments when he haddoubted, God had spoken. Yours is a Holy mission, God had said. I will give youstrength. Even with God’s strength, the camerlegno had felt fear, questioningthe righteousness of his path.If not you, God had challenged, then WHO?If not now, then WHEN?If not this way, then HOW?Jesus, God reminded him, had saved them all… saved them from their own apathy.With two deeds, Jesus had opened their eyes. Horror and Hope. The crucifixionand the resurrection. He had changed the world.But that was millennia ago. Time had eroded the miracle. People had forgotten.They had turned to false idols-techno-deities and miracles of the mind. Whatabout miracles of the heart!The camerlegno had often prayed to God to show him how to make the peoplebelieve again. But God had been silent. It was not until the camerlegno’s momentof deepest darkness that God had come to him. Oh, the horror of that night!The camerlegno could still remember lying on the floor in tattered nightclothes,clawing at his own flesh, trying to purge his soul of the pain brought on by avile truth he had just learned. It cannot be! he had screamed. And yet he knewit was. The deception tore at him like the fires of hell. The bishop who hadtaken him in, the man who had been like a father to him, the clergyman whom thecamerlegno had stood beside while he rose to the papacy… was a fraud. A commonsinner. Lying to the world about a deed so traitorous at its core that thecamerlegno doubted even God could forgive it. “Your vow!” the camerlegno hadscreamed at the Pope. “You broke your vow to God! You, of all men!”The Pope had tried to explain himself, but the camerlegno could not listen. Hehad run out, staggering blindly through the hallways, vomiting, tearing at hisown skin, until he found himself bloody and alone, lying on the cold earthenfloor before St. Peter’s tomb. Mother Mary, what do I do? It was in that momentof pain and betrayal, as the camerlegno lay devastated in the Necropolis,praying for God to take him from this faithless world, that God had come.The voice in his head resounded like peals of thunder. “Did you vow to serveyour God?”“Yes!” the camerlegno cried out.“Would you die for your God?”“Yes! Take me now!”“Would you die for your church?”“Yes! Please deliver me!”“But would you die for… mankind?”It was in the silence that followed that the camerlegno felt himself fallinginto the abyss. He tumbled farther, faster, out of control. And yet he knew theanswer. He had always known.“Yes!” he shouted into the madness. “I would die for man! Like your son, I woulddie for them!”Hours later, the camerlegno still lay shivering on his floor. He saw hismother’s face. God has plans for you, she was saying. The camerlegno plungeddeeper into madness. It was then God had spoken again. This time with silence.But the camerlegno understood. Restore their faith.If not me… then who?If not now… then when?As the guards unbolted the door of the Sistine Chapel, Camerlegno CarloVentresca felt the power moving in his veins… exactly as it had when he was aboy. God had chosen him. Long ago.His will be done.The camerlegno felt reborn. The Swiss Guard had bandaged his chest, bathed him,and dressed him in a fresh white linen robe. They had also given him aninjection of morphine for the burn. The camerlegno wished they had not given himpainkillers. Jesus endured his pain for three days on the cross! He couldalready feel the drug uprooting his senses… a dizzying undertow.As he walked into the chapel, he was not at all surprised to see the cardinalsstaring at him in wonder. They are in awe of God, he reminded himself. Not ofme, but how God works THROUGH me. As he moved up the center aisle, he sawbewilderment in every face. And yet, with each new face he passed, he sensedsomething else in their eyes. What was it? The camerlegno had tried to imaginehow they would receive him tonight. Joyfully? Reverently? He tried to read theireyes and saw neither emotion.It was then the camerlegno looked at the altar and saw Robert Langdon."},{"pageContent":"131Camerlegno Carlo Ventresca stood in the aisle of the Sistine Chapel. Thecardinals were all standing near the front of the church, turned, staring athim. Robert Langdon was on the altar beside a television that was on endlessloop, playing a scene the camerlegno recognized but could not imagine how it hadcome to be. Vittoria Vetra stood beside him, her face drawn.The camerlegno closed his eyes for a moment, hoping the morphine was making himhallucinate and that when he opened them the scene might be different. But itwas not.They knew.Oddly, he felt no fear. Show me the way, Father. Give me the words that I canmake them see Your vision.But the camerlegno heard no reply.Father, We have come too far together to fail now.Silence.They do not understand what We have done.The camerlegno did not know whose voice he heard in his own mind, but themessage was stark.And the truth shall set you free…And so it was that Camerlegno Carlo Ventresca held his head high as he walkedtoward the front of the Sistine Chapel. As he moved toward the cardinals, noteven the diffused light of the candles could soften the eyes boring into him.Explain yourself, the faces said. Make sense of this madness. Tell us our fearsare wrong!Truth, the camerlegno told himself. Only truth. There were too many secrets inthese walls… one so dark it had driven him to madness. But from the madness hadcome the light.“If you could give your own soul to save millions,” the camerlegno said, as hemoved down the aisle, “would you?”The faces in the chapel simply stared. No one moved. No one spoke. Beyond thewalls, the joyous strains of song could be heard in the square.The camerlegno walked toward them. “Which is the greater sin? Killing one’senemy? Or standing idle while your true love is strangled?” They are singing inSt. Peter’s Square! The camerlegno stopped for a moment and gazed up at theceiling of the Sistine. Michelangelo’s God was staring down from the darkenedvault… and He seemed pleased.“I could no longer stand by,” the camerlegno said. Still, as he drew nearer, hesaw no flicker of understanding in anyone’s eyes. Didn’t they see the radiantsimplicity of his deeds? Didn’t they see the utter necessity!It had been so pure.The Illuminati. Science and Satan as one.Resurrect the ancient fear. Then crush it.Horror and Hope. Make them believe again.Tonight, the power of the Illuminati had been unleashed anew… and with gloriousconsequence. The apathy had evaporated. The fear had shot out across the worldlike a bolt of lightning, uniting the people. And then God’s majesty hadvanquished the darkness.I could not stand idly by!The inspiration had been God’s own-appearing like a beacon in the camerlegno’snight of agony. Oh, this faithless world! Someone must deliver them. You. If notyou, who? You have been saved for a reason. Show them the old demons. Remindthem of their fear. Apathy is death. Without darkness, there is no light.Without evil, there is no good. Make them choose. Dark or light. Where is thefear? Where are the heroes? If not now, when?The camerlegno walked up the center aisle directly toward the crowd of standingcardinals. He felt like Moses as the sea of red sashes and caps parted beforehim, allowing him to pass. On the altar, Robert Langdon switched off thetelevision, took Vittoria’s hand, and relinquished the altar. The fact thatRobert Langdon had survived, the camerlegno knew, could only have been God’swill. God had saved Robert Langdon. The camerlegno wondered why.The voice that broke the silence was the voice of the only woman in the SistineChapel. “You killed my father?” she said, stepping forward.When the camerlegno turned to Vittoria Vetra, the look on her face was one hecould not quite understand-pain yes, but anger? Certainly she must understand.Her father’s genius was deadly. He had to be stopped. For the good of Mankind.“He was doing God’s work,” Vittoria said.“God’s work is not done in a lab. It is done in the heart.”“My father’s heart was pure! And his research proved-”“His research proved yet again that man’s mind is progressing faster than hissoul!” The camerlegno’s voice was sharper than he had expected. He lowered hisvoice. “If a man as spiritual as your father could create a weapon like the onewe saw tonight, imagine what an ordinary man will do with his technology.”“A man like you?”The camerlegno took a deep breath. Did she not see? Man’s morality was notadvancing as fast as man’s science. Mankind was not spiritually evolved enoughfor the powers he possessed. We have never created a weapon we have not used!And yet he knew that antimatter was nothing-another weapon in man’s alreadyburgeoning arsenal. Man could already destroy. Man learned to kill long ago. Andhis mother’s blood rained down. Leonardo Vetra’s genius was dangerous foranother reason.“For centuries,” the camerlegno said, “the church has stood by while sciencepicked away at religion bit by bit. Debunking miracles. Training the mind toovercome the heart. Condemning religion as the opiate of the masses. Theydenounce God as a hallucination-a delusional crutch for those too weak to acceptthat life is meaningless. I could not stand by while science presumed to harnessthe power of God himself! Proof, you say? Yes, proof of science’s ignorance!What is wrong with the admission that something exists beyond our understanding?The day science substantiates God in a lab is the day people stop needingfaith!”“You mean the day they stop needing the church,” Vittoria challenged, movingtoward him. “Doubt is your last shred of control. It is doubt that brings soulsto you. Our need to know that life has meaning. Man’s insecurity and need for anenlightened soul assuring him everything is part of a master plan. But thechurch is not the only enlightened soul on the planet! We all seek God indifferent ways. What are you afraid of? That God will show himself somewhereother than inside these walls? That people will find him in their own lives andleave your antiquated rituals behind? Religions evolve! The mind finds answers,the heart grapples with new truths. My father was on your quest! A parallelpath! Why couldn’t you see that? God is not some omnipotent authority lookingdown from above, threatening to throw us into a pit of fire if we disobey. Godis the energy that flows through the synapses of our nervous system and thechambers of our hearts! God is in all things!”“Except science,” the camerlegno fired back, his eyes showing only pity.“Science, by definition, is soulless. Divorced from the heart. Intellectualmiracles like antimatter arrive in this world with no ethical instructionsattached. This in itself is perilous! But when science heralds its Godlesspursuits as the enlightened path? Promising answers to questions whose beauty isthat they have no answers?” He shook his head. “No.”There was a moment of silence. The camerlegno felt suddenly tired as he returnedVittoria’s unbending stare. This was not how it was supposed to be. Is thisGod’s final test?It was Mortati who broke the spell. “The preferiti,” he said in a horrifiedwhisper. “Baggia and the others. Please tell me you did not…”The camerlegno turned to him, surprised by the pain in his voice. CertainlyMortati could understand. Headlines carried science’s miracles every day. Howlong had it been for religion? Centuries? Religion needed a miracle! Somethingto awaken a sleeping world. Bring them back to the path of righteousness.Restore faith. The preferiti were not leaders anyway, they weretransformers-liberals prepared to embrace the new world and abandon the oldways! This was the only way. A new leader. Young. Powerful. Vibrant. Miraculous.The preferiti served the church far more effectively in death than they evercould alive. Horror and Hope. Offer four souls to save millions. The world wouldremember them forever as martyrs. The church would raise glorious tribute totheir names. How many thousands have died for the glory of God? They are onlyfour.“The preferiti,” Mortati repeated.“I shared their pain,” the camerlegno defended, motioning to his chest. “And Itoo would die for God, but my work is only just begun. They are singing in St.Peter’s Square!”The camerlegno saw the horror in Mortati’s eyes and again felt confused. Was itthe morphine? Mortati was looking at him as if the camerlegno himself had killedthese men with his bare hands. I would do even that for God, the camerlegnothought, and yet he had not. The deeds had been carried out by the Hassassin-aheathen soul tricked into thinking he was doing the work of the Illuminati. I amJanus, the camerlegno had told him. I will prove my power. And he had. TheHassassin’s hatred had made him God’s pawn.“Listen to the singing,” the camerlegno said, smiling, his own heart rejoicing.“Nothing unites hearts like the presence of evil. Burn a church and thecommunity rises up, holding hands, singing hymns of defiance as they rebuild.Look how they flock tonight. Fear has brought them home. Forge modern demons formodern man. Apathy is dead. Show them the face of evil-Satanists lurking amongus-running our governments, our banks, our schools, threatening to obliteratethe very House of God with their misguided science. Depravity runs deep. Manmust be vigilant. Seek the goodness. Become the goodness!”In the silence, the camerlegno hoped they now understood. The Illuminati had notresurfaced. The Illuminati were long deceased. Only their myth was alive. Thecamerlegno had resurrected the Illuminati as a reminder. Those who knew theIlluminati history relived their evil. Those who did not, had learned of it andwere amazed how blind they had been. The ancient demons had been resurrected toawaken an indifferent world.“But… the brands?” Mortati’s voice was stiff with outrage.The camerlegno did not answer. Mortati had no way of knowing, but the brands hadbeen confiscated by the Vatican over a century ago. They had been locked away,forgotten and dust covered, in the Papal Vault-the Pope’s private reliquary,deep within his Borgia apartments. The Papal Vault contained those items thechurch deemed too dangerous for anyone’s eyes except the Pope’s.Why did they hide that which inspired fear? Fear brought people to God!The vault’s key was passed down from Pope to Pope. Camerlegno Carlo Ventrescahad purloined the key and ventured inside; the myth of what the vault containedwas bewitching-the original manuscript for the fourteen unpublished books of theBible known as the Apocrypha, the third prophecy of Fatima, the first two havingcome true and the third so terrifying the church would never reveal it. Inaddition to these, the camerlegno had found the Illuminati Collection-all thesecrets the church had uncovered after banishing the group from Rome… theircontemptible Path of Illumination… the cunning deceit of the Vatican’s headartist, Bernini… Europe’s top scientists mocking religion as they secretlyassembled in the Vatican’s own Castle St. Angelo. The collection included apentagon box containing iron brands, one of them the mythical IlluminatiDiamond. This was a part of Vatican history the ancients thought best forgotten.The camerlegno, however, had disagreed.“But the antimatter…” Vittoria demanded. “You risked destroying the Vatican!”“There is no risk when God is at your side,” the camerlegno said. “This causewas His.”“You’re insane!” she seethed.“Millions were saved.”“People were killed!”“Souls were saved.”“Tell that to my father and Max Kohler!”“CERN’s arrogance needed to be revealed. A droplet of liquid that can vaporize ahalf mile? And you call me mad?” The camerlegno felt a rage rising in him. Didthey think his was a simple charge? “Those who believe undergo great tests forGod! God asked Abraham to sacrifice his child! God commanded Jesus to endurecrucifixion! And so we hang the symbol of the crucifix before our eyes-bloody,painful, agonizing-to remind us of evil’s power! To keep our hearts vigilant!The scars on Jesus’ body are a living reminder of the powers of darkness! Myscars are a living reminder! Evil lives, but the power of God will overcome!”His shouts echoed off the back wall of the Sistine Chapel and then a profoundsilence fell. Time seemed to stop. Michelangelo’s Last Judgment rose ominouslybehind him… Jesus casting sinners into hell. Tears brimmed in Mortati’s eyes.“What have you done, Carlo?” Mortati asked in a whisper. He closed his eyes, anda tear rolled. “His Holiness?”A collective sigh of pain went up, as if everyone in the room had forgottenuntil that very moment. The Pope. Poisoned.“A vile liar,” the camerlegno said.Mortati looked shattered. “What do you mean? He was honest! He… loved you.”“And I him.” Oh, how I loved him! But the deceit! The broken vows to God!The camerlegno knew they did not understand right now, but they would. When hetold them, they would see! His Holiness was the most nefarious deceiver thechurch had ever seen. The camerlegno still remembered that terrible night. Hehad returned from his trip to CERN with news of Vetra’s Genesis and ofantimatter’s horrific power. The camerlegno was certain the Pope would see theperils, but the Holy Father saw only hope in Vetra’s breakthrough. He evensuggested the Vatican fund Vetra’s work as a gesture of goodwill towardspiritually based scientific research.Madness! The church investing in research that threatened to make the churchobsolete? Work that spawned weapons of mass destruction? The bomb that hadkilled his mother…“But… you can’t!” the camerlegno had exclaimed.“I owe a deep debt to science,” the Pope had replied. “Something I have hiddenmy entire life. Science gave me a gift when I was a young man. A gift I havenever forgotten.”“I don’t understand. What does science have to offer a man of God?”“It is complicated,” the Pope had said. “I will need time to make youunderstand. But first, there is a simple fact about me that you must know. Ihave kept it hidden all these years. I believe it is time I told you.”Then the Pope had told him the astonishing truth."},{"pageContent":"132The camerlegno lay curled in a ball on the dirt floor in front of St. Peter’stomb. The Necropolis was cold, but it helped clot the blood flowing from thewounds he had torn at his own flesh. His Holiness would not find him here.Nobody would find him here…“It is complicated,” the Pope’s voice echoed in his mind. “I will need time tomake you understand…”But the camerlegno knew no amount of time could make him understand.Liar! I believed in you! GOD believed in you!With a single sentence, the Pope had brought the camerlegno’s world crashingdown around him. Everything the camerlegno had ever believed about his mentorwas shattered before his eyes. The truth drilled into the camerlegno’s heartwith such force that he staggered backward out of the Pope’s office and vomitedin the hallway.“Wait!” the Pope had cried, chasing after him. “Please let me explain!”But the camerlegno ran off. How could His Holiness expect him to endure anymore? Oh, the wretched depravity of it! What if someone else found out? Imaginethe desecration to the church! Did the Pope’s holy vows mean nothing?The madness came quickly, screaming in his ears, until he awoke before St.Peter’s tomb. It was then that God came to him with an awesome fierceness.YOURS IS A VENGEFUL GOD!Together, they made their plans. Together they would protect the church.Together they would restore faith to this faithless world. Evil was everywhere.And yet the world had become immune! Together they would unveil the darkness forthe world to see… and God would overcome! Horror and Hope. Then the world wouldbelieve!God’s first test had been less horrible than the camerlegno imagined. Sneakinginto the Papal bed chambers… filling his syringe… covering the deceiver’s mouthas his body spasmed into death. In the moonlight, the camerlegno could see inthe Pope’s wild eyes there was something he wanted to say.But it was too late.The Pope had said enough."},{"pageContent":"133The Pope fathered a child.“Inside the Sistine Chapel, the camerlegno stood unwavering as he spoke. Fivesolitary words of astonishing disclosure. The entire assembly seemed to recoilin unison. The cardinals’ accusing miens evaporated into aghast stares, as ifevery soul in the room were praying the camerlegno was wrong.The Pope fathered a child.Langdon felt the shock wave hit him too. Vittoria’s hand, tight in his, jolted,while Langdon’s mind, already numb with unanswered questions, wrestled to find acenter of gravity.The camerlegno’s utterance seemed like it would hang forever in the air abovethem. Even in the camerlegno’s frenzied eyes, Langdon could see pure conviction.Langdon wanted to disengage, tell himself he was lost in some grotesquenightmare, soon to wake up in a world that made sense.“This must be a lie!” one of the cardinals yelled.“I will not believe it!” another protested. “His Holiness was as devout a man asever lived!”It was Mortati who spoke next, his voice thin with devastation. “My friends.What the camerlegno says is true.” Every cardinal in the chapel spun as thoughMortati had just shouted an obscenity. “The Pope indeed fathered a child.”The cardinals blanched with dread.The camerlegno looked stunned. “You knew? But… how could you possibly knowthis?”Mortati sighed. “When His Holiness was elected… I was the Devil’s Advocate.”There was a communal gasp.Langdon understood. This meant the information was probably true. The infamous“Devil’s Advocate” was the authority when it came to scandalous informationinside the Vatican. Skeletons in a Pope’s closet were dangerous, and prior toelections, secret inquiries into a candidate’s background were carried out by alone cardinal who served as the “Devil’s Advocate”-that individual responsiblefor unearthing reasons why the eligible cardinals should not become Pope. TheDevil’s Advocate was appointed in advance by the reigning Pope in preparationfor his own death. The Devil’s Advocate was never supposed to reveal hisidentity. Ever.“I was the Devil’s Advocate,” Mortati repeated. “That is how I found out.”Mouths dropped. Apparently tonight was a night when all the rules were going outthe window.The camerlegno felt his heart filling with rage. “And you… told no one?”“I confronted His Holiness,” Mortati said. “And he confessed. He explained theentire story and asked only that I let my heart guide my decision as to whetheror not to reveal his secret.”“And your heart told you to bury the information?”“He was the runaway favorite for the papacy. People loved him. The scandal wouldhave hurt the church deeply.”“But he fathered a child! He broke his sacred vow of celibacy!” The camerlegnowas screaming now. He could hear his mother’s voice. A promise to God is themost important promise of all. Never break a promise to God. “The Pope broke hisvow!”Mortati looked delirious with angst. “Carlo, his love… was chaste. He had brokenno vow. He didn’t explain it to you?”“Explain what?” The camerlegno remembered running out of the Pope’s office whilethe Pope was calling to him. Let me explain!Slowly, sadly, Mortati let the tale unfold. Many years ago, the Pope, when hewas still just a priest, had fallen in love with a young nun. Both of them hadtaken vows of celibacy and never even considered breaking their covenant withGod. Still, as they fell deeper in love, although they could resist thetemptations of the flesh, they both found themselves longing for something theynever expected-to participate in God’s ultimate miracle of creation-a child.Their child. The yearning, especially in her, became overwhelming. Still, Godcame first. A year later, when the frustration had reached almost unbearableproportions, she came to him in a whirl of excitement. She had just read anarticle about a new miracle of science-a process by which two people, withoutever having sexual relations, could have a child. She sensed this was a signfrom God. The priest could see the happiness in her eyes and agreed. A yearlater she had a child through the miracle of artificial insemination…“This cannot… be true,” the camerlegno said, panicked, hoping it was themorphine washing over his senses. Certainly he was hearing things.Mortati now had tears in his eyes. “Carlo, this is why His Holiness has alwayshad an affection for the sciences. He felt he owed a debt to science. Sciencelet him experience the joys of fatherhood without breaking his vow of celibacy.His Holiness told me he had no regrets except one-that his advancing stature inthe church prohibited him from being with the woman he loved and seeing hisinfant grow up.”Camerlegno Carlo Ventresca felt the madness setting in again. He wanted to clawat his flesh. How could I have known?“The Pope committed no sin, Carlo. He was chaste.”“But…” The camerlegno searched his anguished mind for any kind of rationale.“Think of the jeopardy… of his deeds.” His voice felt weak. “What if this whoreof his came forward? Or, heaven forbid, his child? Imagine the shame the churchwould endure.”Mortati’s voice was tremulous. “The child has already come forward.”Everything stopped.“Carlo… ?” Mortati crumbled. “His Holiness’s child… is you.”At that moment, the camerlegno could feel the fire of faith dim in his heart. Hestood trembling on the altar, framed by Michelangelo’s towering Last Judgment.He knew he had just glimpsed hell itself. He opened his mouth to speak, but hislips wavered, soundless.“Don’t you see?” Mortati choked. “That is why His Holiness came to you in thehospital in Palermo when you were a boy. That is why he took you in and raisedyou. The nun he loved was Maria… your mother. She left the nunnery to raise you,but she never abandoned her strict devotion to God. When the Pope heard she haddied in an explosion and that you, his son, had miraculously survived… he sworeto God he would never leave you alone again. Carlo, your parents were bothvirgins. They kept their vows to God. And still they found a way to bring youinto the world. You were their miraculous child.”The camerlegno covered his ears, trying to block out the words. He stoodparalyzed on the altar. Then, with his world yanked from beneath him, he fellviolently to his knees and let out a wail of anguish.Seconds. Minutes. Hours.Time seemed to have lost all meaning inside the four walls of the chapel.Vittoria felt herself slowly breaking free of the paralysis that seemed to havegripped them all. She let go of Langdon’s hand and began moving through thecrowd of cardinals. The chapel door seemed miles away, and she felt like she wasmoving underwater… slow motion.As she maneuvered through the robes, her motion seemed to pull others from theirtrance. Some of the cardinals began to pray. Others wept. Some turned to watchher go, their blank expressions turning slowly to a foreboding cognition as shemoved toward the door. She had almost reached the back of the crowd when a handcaught her arm. The touch was frail but resolute. She turned, face to face witha wizened cardinal. His visage was clouded by fear.“No,” the man whispered. “You cannot.”Vittoria stared, incredulous.Another cardinal was at her side now. “We must think before we act.”And another. “The pain this could cause…”Vittoria was surrounded. She looked at them all, stunned. “But these deeds heretoday, tonight… certainly the world should know the truth.”“My heart agrees,” the wizened cardinal said, still holding her arm, “and yet itis a path from which there is no return. We must consider the shattered hopes.The cynicism. How could the people ever trust again?”Suddenly, more cardinals seemed to be blocking her way. There was a wall ofblack robes before her. “Listen to the people in the square,” one said. “Whatwill this do to their hearts? We must exercise prudence.”“We need time to think and pray,” another said. “We must act with foresight. Therepercussions of this…”“He killed my father!” Vittoria said. “He killed his own father!”“I’m certain he will pay for his sins,” the cardinal holding her arm said sadly.Vittoria was certain too, and she intended to ensure he paid. She tried to pushtoward the door again, but the cardinals huddled closer, their faces frightened.“What are you going to do?” she exclaimed. “Kill me?”The old men blanched, and Vittoria immediately regretted her words. She couldsee these men were gentle souls. They had seen enough violence tonight. Theymeant no threat. They were simply trapped. Scared. Trying to get their bearings.“I want…” the wizened cardinal said, “… to do what is right.”“Then you will let her out,” a deep voice declared behind her. The words werecalm but absolute. Robert Langdon arrived at her side, and she felt his handtake hers. “Ms. Vetra and I are leaving this chapel. Right now.”Faltering, hesitant, the cardinals began to step aside.“Wait!” It was Mortati. He moved toward them now, down the center aisle, leavingthe camerlegno alone and defeated on the altar. Mortati looked older all of asudden, wearied beyond his years. His motion was burdened with shame. Hearrived, putting a hand on Langdon’s shoulder and one on Vittoria’s as well.Vittoria felt sincerity in his touch. The man’s eyes were more tearful now.“Of course you are free to go,” Mortati said. “Of course.” The man paused, hisgrief almost tangible. “I ask only this…” He stared down at his feet a longmoment then back up at Vittoria and Langdon. “Let me do it. I will go into thesquare right now and find a way. I will tell them. I don’t know how… but I willfind a way. The church’s confession should come from within. Our failures shouldbe our own to expose.”Mortati turned sadly back toward the altar. “Carlo, you have brought this churchto a disastrous juncture.” He paused, looking around. The altar was bare.There was a rustle of cloth down the side aisle, and the door clicked shut.The camerlegno was gone."},{"pageContent":"134Camerlegno Ventresca’s white robe billowed as he moved down the hallway awayfrom the Sistine Chapel. The Swiss Guards had seemed perplexed when he emergedall alone from the chapel and told them he needed a moment of solitude. But theyhad obeyed, letting him go.Now as he rounded the corner and left their sight, the camerlegno felt amaelstrom of emotions like nothing he thought possible in human experience. Hehad poisoned the man he called “Holy Father,” the man who addressed him as “myson.” The camerlegno had always believed the words “father” and “son” werereligious tradition, but now he knew the diabolical truth-the words had beenliteral.Like that fateful night weeks ago, the camerlegno now felt himself reeling madlythrough the darkness.It was raining the morning the Vatican staff banged on the camerlegno’s door,awakening him from a fitful sleep. The Pope, they said, was not answering hisdoor or his phone. The clergy were frightened. The camerlegno was the only onewho could enter the Pope’s chambers unannounced.The camerlegno entered alone to find the Pope, as he was the night before,twisted and dead in his bed. His Holiness’s face looked like that of Satan. Histongue black like death. The Devil himself had been sleeping in the Pope’s bed.The camerlegno felt no remorse. God had spoken.Nobody would see the treachery… not yet. That would come later.He announced the terrible news-His Holiness was dead of a stroke. Then thecamerlegno prepared for conclave.Mother Maria’s voice was whispering in his ear. “Never break a promise to God.”“I hear you, Mother,” he replied. “It is a faithless world. They need to bebrought back to the path of righteousness. Horror and Hope. It is the only way.”“Yes,” she said. “If not you… then who? Who will lead the church out ofdarkness?”Certainly not one of the preferiti. They were old… walking death… liberals whowould follow the Pope, endorsing science in his memory, seeking modern followersby abandoning the ancient ways. Old men desperately behind the times,pathetically pretending they were not. They would fail, of course. The church’sstrength was its tradition, not its transience. The whole world was transitory.The church did not need to change, it simply needed to remind the world it wasrelevant! Evil lives! God will overcome!The church needed a leader. Old men do not inspire! Jesus inspired! Young,vibrant, powerful… MIRACULOUS.“Enjoy your tea,” the camerlegno told the four preferiti, leaving them in thePope’s private library before conclave. “Your guide will be here soon.”The preferiti thanked him, all abuzz that they had been offered a chance toenter the famed Passetto. Most uncommon! The camerlegno, before leaving them,had unlocked the door to the Passetto, and exactly on schedule, the door hadopened, and a foreign-looking priest with a torch had ushered the excitedpreferiti in.The men had never come out.They will be the Horror. I will be the Hope.No… I am the horror.The camerlegno staggered now through the darkness of St. Peter’s Basilica.Somehow, through the insanity and guilt, through the images of his father,through the pain and revelation, even through the pull of the morphine… he hadfound a brilliant clarity. A sense of destiny. I know my purpose, he thought,awed by the lucidity of it.From the beginning, nothing tonight had gone exactly as he had planned.Unforeseen obstacles had presented themselves, but the camerlegno had adapted,making bold adjustments. Still, he had never imagined tonight would end thisway, and yet now he saw the preordained majesty of it.It could end no other way.Oh, what terror he had felt in the Sistine Chapel, wondering if God had forsakenhim! Oh, what deeds He had ordained! He had fallen to his knees, awash withdoubt, his ears straining for the voice of God but hearing only silence. He hadbegged for a sign. Guidance. Direction. Was this God’s will? The churchdestroyed by scandal and abomination? No! God was the one who had willed thecamerlegno to act! Hadn’t He?Then he had seen it. Sitting on the altar. A sign. Divinecommunication-something ordinary seen in an extraordinary light. The crucifix.Humble, wooden. Jesus on the cross. In that moment, it had all come clear… thecamerlegno was not alone. He would never be alone.This was His will… His meaning.God had always asked great sacrifice of those he loved most. Why had thecamerlegno been so slow to understand? Was he too fearful? Too humble? It madeno difference. God had found a way. The camerlegno even understood now whyRobert Langdon had been saved. It was to bring the truth. To compel this ending.This was the sole path to the church’s salvation!The camerlegno felt like he was floating as he descended into the Niche of thePalliums. The surge of morphine seemed relentless now, but he knew God wasguiding him.In the distance, he could hear the cardinals clamoring in confusion as theypoured from the chapel, yelling commands to the Swiss Guard.But they would never find him. Not in time.The camerlegno felt himself drawn… faster… descending the stairs into the sunkenarea where the ninety-nine oil lamps shone brightly. God was returning him toHoly Ground. The camerlegno moved toward the grate covering the hole that leddown to the Necropolis. The Necropolis is where this night would end. In thesacred darkness below. He lifted an oil lamp, preparing to descend.But as he moved across the Niche, the camerlegno paused. Something about thisfelt wrong. How did this serve God? A solitary and silent end? Jesus hadsuffered before the eyes of the entire world. Surely this could not be God’swill! The camerlegno listened for the voice of his God, but heard only theblurring buzz of drugs.“Carlo.” It was his mother. “God has plans for you.”Bewildered, the camerlegno kept moving.Then, without warning, God arrived.The camerlegno stopped short, staring. The light of the ninety-nine oil lanternshad thrown the camerlegno’s shadow on the marble wall beside him. Giant andfearful. A hazy form surrounded by golden light. With flames flickering allaround him, the camerlegno looked like an angel ascending to heaven. He stood amoment, raising his arms to his sides, watching his own image. Then he turned,looking back up the stairs.God’s meaning was clear.Three minutes had passed in the chaotic hallways outside the Sistine Chapel, andstill nobody could locate the camerlegno. It was as if the man had beenswallowed up by the night. Mortati was about to demand a full-scale search ofVatican City when a roar of jubilation erupted outside in St. Peter’s Square.The spontaneous celebration of the crowd was tumultuous. The cardinals allexchanged startled looks.Mortati closed his eyes. “God help us.”For the second time that evening, the College of Cardinals flooded onto St.Peter’s Square. Langdon and Vittoria were swept up in the jostling crowd ofcardinals, and they too emerged into the night air. The media lights and cameraswere all pivoted toward the basilica. And there, having just stepped onto thesacred Papal Balcony located in the exact center of the towering faзade,Camerlegno Carlo Ventresca stood with his arms raised to the heavens. Even faraway, he looked like purity incarnate. A figurine. Dressed in white. Floodedwith light.The energy in the square seemed to grow like a cresting wave, and all at oncethe Swiss Guard barriers gave way. The masses streamed toward the basilica in aeuphoric torrent of humanity. The onslaught rushed forward-people crying,singing, media cameras flashing. Pandemonium. As the people flooded in aroundthe front of the basilica, the chaos intensified, until it seemed nothing couldstop it.And then something did.High above, the camerlegno made the smallest of gestures. He folded his handsbefore him. Then he bowed his head in silent prayer. One by one, then dozens bydozens, then hundreds by hundreds, the people bowed their heads along with him.The square fell silent… as if a spell had been cast.In his mind, swirling and distant now, the camerlegno’s prayers were a torrentof hopes and sorrows… forgive me, Father… Mother… full of grace… you are thechurch… may you understand this sacrifice of your only begotten son.Oh, my Jesus… save us from the fires of hell… take all souls to heaven,especially, those most in need of thy mercy…The camerlegno did not open his eyes to see the throngs below him, thetelevision cameras, the whole world watching. He could feel it in his soul. Evenin his anguish, the unity of the moment was intoxicating. It was as if aconnective web had shot out in all directions around the globe. In front oftelevisions, at home, and in cars, the world prayed as one. Like synapses of agiant heart all firing in tandem, the people reached for God, in dozens oflanguages, in hundreds of countries. The words they whispered were newborn andyet as familiar to them as their own voices… ancient truths… imprinted on thesoul.The consonance felt eternal.As the silence lifted, the joyous strains of singing began to rise again.He knew the moment had come.Most Holy Trinity, I offer Thee the most precious Body, Blood, Soul… inreparation for the outrages, sacrileges, and indifferences…The camerlegno already felt the physical pain setting in. It was spreadingacross his skin like a plague, making him want to claw at his flesh like he hadweeks ago when God had first come to him. Do not forget what pain Jesus endured.He could taste the fumes now in his throat. Not even the morphine could dull thebite.My work here is done.The Horror was his. The Hope was theirs.In the Niche of the Palliums, the camerlegno had followed God’s will andanointed his body. His hair. His face. His linen robe. His flesh. He was soakingnow with the sacred, vitreous oils from the lamps. They smelled sweet like hismother, but they burned. His would be a merciful ascension. Miraculous andswift. And he would leave behind not scandal… but a new strength and wonder.He slipped his hand into the pocket of his robe and fingered the small, goldenlighter he had brought with him from the Pallium incendiario.He whispered a verse from Judgments. And when the flame went up toward heaven,the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame.He positioned his thumb.They were singing in St. Peter’s Square…The vision the world witnessed no one would ever forget.High above on the balcony, like a soul tearing free of its corporeal restrains,a luminous pyre of flame erupted from the camerlegno’s center. The fire shotupward, engulfing his entire body instantly. He did not scream. He raised hisarms over his head and looked toward heaven. The conflagration roared aroundhim, entirely shrouding his body in a column of light. It raged for what seemedlike an eternity, the whole world bearing witness. The light flared brighter andbrighter. Then, gradually, the flames dissipated. The camerlegno was gone.Whether he had collapsed behind the balustrade or evaporated into thin air wasimpossible to tell. All that was left was a cloud of smoke spiraling skywardover Vatican City."},{"pageContent":"135D awn came late to Rome.An early rainstorm had washed the crowds from St. Peter’s Square. The mediastayed on, huddling under umbrellas and in vans, commentating on the evening’sevents. Across the world, churches overflowed. It was a time of reflection anddiscussion… in all religions. Questions abounded, and yet the answers seemedonly to bring deeper questions. Thus far, the Vatican had remained silent,issuing no statement whatsoever.Deep in the Vatican Grottoes, Cardinal Mortati knelt alone before the opensarcophagus. He reached in and closed the old man’s blackened mouth. HisHoliness looked peaceful now. In quiet repose for eternity.At Mortati’s feet was a golden urn, heavy with ashes. Mortati had gathered theashes himself and brought them here. “A chance for forgiveness,” he said to HisHoliness, laying the urn inside the sarcophagus at the Pope’s side. “No love isgreater than that of a father for His son.” Mortati tucked the urn out of sightbeneath the papal robes. He knew this sacred grotto was reserved exclusively forthe relics of Popes, but somehow Mortati sensed this was appropriate.“Signore?” someone said, entering the grottoes. It was Lieutenant Chartrand. Hewas accompanied by three Swiss Guards. “They are ready for you in conclave.”Mortati nodded. “In a moment.” He gazed one last time into the sarcophagusbefore him, and then stood up. He turned to the guards. “It is time for HisHoliness to have the peace he has earned.”The guards came forward and with enormous effort slid the lid of the Pope’ssarcophagus back into place. It thundered shut with finality.Mortati was alone as he crossed the Borgia Courtyard toward the Sistine Chapel.A damp breeze tossed his robe. A fellow cardinal emerged from the ApostolicPalace and strode beside him.“May I have the honor of escorting you to conclave, signore?”“The honor is mine.”“Signore,” the cardinal said, looking troubled. “The college owes you an apologyfor last night. We were blinded by-”“Please,” Mortati replied. “Our minds sometimes see what our hearts wish weretrue.”The cardinal was silent a long time. Finally he spoke. “Have you been told? Youare no longer our Great Elector.”Mortati smiled. “Yes. I thank God for small blessings.”“The college insisted you be eligible.”“It seems charity is not dead in the church.”“You are a wise man. You would lead us well.”“I am an old man. I would lead you briefly.”They both laughed.As they reached the end of the Borgia Courtyard, the cardinal hesitated. Heturned to Mortati with a troubled mystification, as if the precarious awe of thenight before had slipped back into his heart.“Were you aware,” the cardinal whispered, “that we found no remains on thebalcony?”Mortati smiled. “Perhaps the rain washed them away.”The man looked to the stormy heavens. “Yes, perhaps…”"},{"pageContent":"136The midmorning sky still hung heavy with clouds as the Sistine Chapel’s chimneygave up its first faint puffs of white smoke. The pearly wisps curled upwardtoward the firmament and slowly dissipated.Far below, in St. Peter’s Square, reporter Gunther Glick watched in reflectivesilence. The final chapter…Chinita Macri approached him from behind and hoisted her camera onto hershoulder. “It’s time,” she said.Glick nodded dolefully. He turned toward her, smoothed his hair, and took a deepbreath. My last transmission, he thought. A small crowd had gathered around themto watch.“Live in sixty seconds,” Macri announced.Glick glanced over his shoulder at the roof of the Sistine Chapel behind him.“Can you get the smoke?”Macri patiently nodded. “I know how to frame a shot, Gunther.”Glick felt dumb. Of course she did. Macri’s performance behind the camera lastnight had probably won her the Pulitzer. His performance, on the other hand… hedidn’t want to think about it. He was sure the BBC would let him go; no doubtthey would have legal troubles from numerous powerful entities… CERN and GeorgeBush among them.“You look good,” Chinita patronized, looking out from behind her camera now witha hint of concern. “I wonder if I might offer you…” She hesitated, holding hertongue.“Some advice?”Macri sighed. “I was only going to say that there’s no need to go out with abang.”“I know,” he said. “You want a straight wrap.”“The straightest in history. I’m trusting you.”Glick smiled. A straight wrap? Is she crazy? A story like last night’s deservedso much more. A twist. A final bombshell. An unforeseen revelation of shockingtruth.Fortunately, Glick had just the ticket waiting in the wings…* * *“You’re on in… five… four… three…”As Chinita Macri looked through her camera, she sensed a sly glint in Glick’seye. I was insane to let him do this, she thought. What was I thinking?But the moment for second thoughts had passed. They were on.“Live from Vatican City,” Glick announced on cue, “this is Gunther Glickreporting.” He gave the camera a solemn stare as the white smoke rose behind himfrom the Sistine Chapel. “Ladies and gentlemen, it is now official. CardinalSaverio Mortati, a seventy-nine-year-old progressive, has just been elected thenext Pope of Vatican City. Although an unlikely candidate, Mortati was chosen byan unprecedented unanimous vote by the College of Cardinals.”As Macri watched him, she began to breathe easier. Glick seemed surprisinglyprofessional today. Even austere. For the first time in his life, Glick actuallylooked and sounded somewhat like a newsman.“And as we reported earlier,” Glick added, his voice intensifying perfectly,“the Vatican has yet to offer any statement whatsoever regarding the miraculousevents of last night.”Good. Chinita’s nervousness waned some more. So far, so good.Glick’s expression grew sorrowful now. “And though last night was a night ofwonder, it was also a night of tragedy. Four cardinals perished in yesterday’sconflict, along with Commander Olivetti and Captain Rocher of the Swiss Guard,both in the line of duty. Other casualties include Leonardo Vetra, the renownedCERN physicist and pioneer of antimatter technology, as well as MaximilianKohler, the director of CERN, who apparently came to Vatican City in an effortto help but reportedly passed away in the process. No official report has beenissued yet on Mr. Kohler’s death, but conjecture is that he died due tocomplications brought on by a long-time illness.”Macri nodded. The report was going perfectly. Just as they discussed.“And in the wake of the explosion in the sky over the Vatican last night, CERN’santimatter technology has become the hot topic among scientists, sparkingexcitement and controversy. A statement read by Mr. Kohler’s assistant inGeneva, Sylvie Baudeloque, announced this morning that CERN’s board ofdirectors, although enthusiastic about antimatter’s potential, are suspendingall research and licensing until further inquiries into its safety can beexamined.”Excellent, Macri thought. Home stretch.“Notably absent from our screens tonight,” Glick reported, “is the face ofRobert Langdon, the Harvard professor who came to Vatican City yesterday to lendhis expertise during this Illuminati crisis. Although originally thought to haveperished in the antimatter blast, we now have reports that Langdon was spottedin St. Peter’s Square after the explosion. How he got there is stillspeculation, although a spokesman from Hospital Tiberina claims that Mr. Langdonfell out of the sky into the Tiber River shortly after midnight, was treated,and released.” Glick arched his eyebrows at the camera. “And if that is true… itwas indeed a night of miracles.”Perfect ending! Macri felt herself smiling broadly. Flawless wrap! Now sign off!But Glick did not sign off. Instead, he paused a moment and then stepped towardthe camera. He had a mysterious smile. “But before we sign off…”No!“… I would like to invite a guest to join me.”Chinita’s hands froze on the camera. A guest? What the hell is he doing? Whatguest! Sign off! But she knew it was too late. Glick had committed.“The man I am about to introduce,” Glick said, “is an American… a renownedscholar.”Chinita hesitated. She held her breath as Glick turned to the small crowd aroundthem and motioned for his guest to step forward. Macri said a silent prayer.Please tell me he somehow located Robert Langdon… and not someIlluminati-conspiracy nutcase.But as Glick’s guest stepped out, Macri’s heart sank. It was not Robert Langdonat all. It was a bald man in blue jeans and a flannel shirt. He had a cane andthick glasses. Macri felt terror. Nutcase!“May I introduce,” Glick announced, “the renowned Vatican scholar from De PaulUniversity in Chicago. Dr. Joseph Vanek.”Macri now hesitated as the man joined Glick on camera. This was no conspiracybuff; Macri had actually heard of this guy.“Dr. Vanek,” Glick said. “You have some rather startling information to sharewith us regarding last night’s conclave.”“I do indeed,” Vanek said. “After a night of such surprises, it is hard toimagine there are any surprises left… and yet…” He paused.Glick smiled. “And yet, there is a strange twist to all this.”Vanek nodded. “Yes. As perplexing as this will sound, I believe the College ofCardinals unknowingly elected two Popes this weekend.”Macri almost dropped the camera.Glick gave a shrewd smile. “Two Popes, you say?”The scholar nodded. “Yes. I should first say that I have spent my life studyingthe laws of papal election. Conclave judicature is extremely complex, and muchof it is now forgotten or ignored as obsolete. Even the Great Elector isprobably not aware of what I am about to reveal. Nonetheless… according to theancient forgotten laws put forth in the Romano Pontifici Eligendo, Numero 63…balloting is not the only method by which a Pope can be elected. There isanother, more divine method. It is called ‘Acclamation by Adoration.’ ” Hepaused. “And it happened last night.”Glick gave his guest a riveted look. “Please, go on.”“As you may recall,” the scholar continued, “last night, when Camerlegno CarloVentresca was standing on the roof of the basilica, all of the cardinals belowbegan calling out his name in unison.”“Yes, I recall.”“With that image in mind, allow me to read verbatim from the ancient electorallaws.” The man pulled some papers from his pocket, cleared his throat, and beganto read. “ ‘Election by Adoration occurs when… all the cardinals, as if byinspiration of the Holy Spirit, freely and spontaneously, unanimously and aloud,proclaim one individual’s name.’ ”Glick smiled. “So you’re saying that last night, when the cardinals chantedCarlo Ventresca’s name together, they actually elected him Pope?”“They did indeed. Furthermore, the law states that Election by Adorationsupercedes the cardinal eligibility requirement and permits anyclergyman-ordained priest, bishop, or cardinal-to be elected. So, as you cansee, the camerlegno was perfectly qualified for papal election by thisprocedure.” Dr. Vanek looked directly into the camera now. “The facts are these…Carlo Ventresca was elected Pope last night. He reigned for just under seventeenminutes. And had he not ascended miraculously into a pillar of fire, he wouldnow be buried in the Vatican Grottoes along with the other Popes.”“Thank you, doctor.” Glick turned to Macri with a mischievous wink. “Mostilluminating…”"},{"pageContent":"137High atop the steps of the Roman Coliseum, Vittoria laughed and called down tohim. “Robert, hurry up! I knew I should have married a younger man!” Her smilewas magic.He struggled to keep up, but his legs felt like stone. “Wait,” he begged.“Please…”There was a pounding in his head.Robert Langdon awoke with a start.Darkness.He lay still for a long time in the foreign softness of the bed, unable tofigure out where he was. The pillows were goose down, oversized and wonderful.The air smelled of potpourri. Across the room, two glass doors stood open to alavish balcony, where a light breeze played beneath a glistening cloud-sweptmoon. Langdon tried to remember how he had gotten here… and where here was.Surreal wisps of memory sifted back into his consciousness…A pyre of mystical fire… an angel materializing from out of the crowd… her softhand taking his and leading him into the night… guiding his exhausted, batteredbody through the streets… leading him here… to this suite… propping himhalf-sleeping in a scalding hot shower… leading him to this bed… and watchingover him as he fell asleep like the dead.In the dimness now, Langdon could see a second bed. The sheets were tousled, butthe bed was empty. From one of the adjoining rooms, he could hear the faint,steady stream of a shower.As he gazed at Vittoria’s bed, he saw a boldly embroidered seal on herpillowcase. It read: HOTEL BERNINI. Langdon had to smile. Vittoria had chosenwell. Old World luxury overlooking Bernini’s Triton Fountain… there was no morefitting hotel in all of Rome.As Langdon lay there, he heard a pounding and realized what had awoken him.Someone was knocking at the door. It grew louder.Confused, Langdon got up. Nobody knows we’re here, he thought, feeling a traceof uneasiness. Donning a luxuriant Hotel Bernini robe, he walked out of thebedroom into the suite’s foyer. He stood a moment at the heavy oak door, andthen pulled it open.A powerful man adorned in lavish purple and yellow regalia stared down at him.“I am Lieutenant Chartrand,” the man said. “Vatican Swiss Guard.”Langdon knew full well who he was. “How… how did you find us?”“I saw you leave the square last night. I followed you. I’m relieved you’restill here.”Langdon felt a sudden anxiety, wondering if the cardinals had sent Chartrand toescort Langdon and Vittoria back to Vatican City. After all, the two of themwere the only two people beyond the College of Cardinals who knew the truth.They were a liability.“His Holiness asked me to give this to you,” Chartrand said, handing over anenvelope sealed with the Vatican signet. Langdon opened the envelope and readthe handwritten note.Mr. Langdon and Ms. Vetra,Although it is my profound desire to request your discretion in the matters ofthe past 24 hours, I cannot possibly presume to ask more of you than you havealready given. I therefore humbly retreat hoping only that you let your heartsguide you in this matter. The world seems a better place today… maybe thequestions are more powerful than the answers.My door is always open,His Holiness, Saverio MortatiLangdon read the message twice. The College of Cardinals had obviously chosen anoble and munificent leader.Before Langdon could say anything, Chartrand produced a small package. “A tokenof thanks from His Holiness.”Langdon took the package. It was heavy, wrapped in brown paper.“By his decree,” Chartrand said, “this artifact is on indefinite loan to youfrom the sacred Papal Vault. His Holiness asks only that in your last will andtestament you ensure it finds its way home.”Langdon opened the package and was struck speechless. It was the brand. TheIlluminati Diamond.Chartrand smiled. “May peace be with you.” He turned to go.“Thank… you,” Langdon managed, his hands trembling around the precious gift.The guard hesitated in the hall. “Mr. Langdon, may I ask you something?”“Of course.”“My fellow guards and I are curious. Those last few minutes… what happened upthere in the helicopter?”Langdon felt a rush of anxiety. He knew this moment was coming-the moment oftruth. He and Vittoria had talked about it last night as they stole away fromSt. Peter’s Square. And they had made their decision. Even before the Pope’snote.Vittoria’s father had dreamed his antimatter discovery would bring about aspiritual awakening. Last night’s events were no doubt not what he had intended,but the undeniable fact remained… at this moment, around the world, people wereconsidering God in ways they never had before. How long the magic would last,Langdon and Vittoria had no idea, but they knew they could never shatter thewonderment with scandal and doubt. The Lord works in strange ways, Langdon toldhimself, wondering wryly if maybe… just maybe… yesterday had been God’s willafter all.“Mr. Langdon?” Chartrand repeated. “I was asking about the helicopter?”Langdon gave a sad smile. “Yes, I know…” He felt the words flow not from hismind but from his heart. “Perhaps it was the shock of the fall… but my memory…it seems… it’s all a blur…”Chartrand slumped. “You remember nothing?”Langdon sighed. “I fear it will remain a mystery forever.”When Robert Langdon returned to the bedroom, the vision awaiting him stopped himin his tracks. Vittoria stood on the balcony, her back to the railing, her eyesgazing deeply at him. She looked like a heavenly apparition… a radiantsilhouette with the moon behind her. She could have been a Roman goddess,enshrouded in her white terrycloth robe, the drawstring cinched tight,accentuating her slender curves. Behind her, a pale mist hung like a halo overBernini’s Triton Fountain.Langdon felt wildly drawn to her… more than to any woman in his life. Quietly,he lay the Illuminati Diamond and the Pope’s letter on his bedside table. Therewould be time to explain all of that later. He went to her on the balcony.Vittoria looked happy to see him. “You’re awake,” she said, in a coy whisper.“Finally.”Langdon smiled. “Long day.”She ran a hand through her luxuriant hair, the neck of her robe falling openslightly. “And now… I suppose you want your reward.”The comment took Langdon off guard. “I’m… sorry?”“We’re adults, Robert. You can admit it. You feel a longing. I see it in youreyes. A deep, carnal hunger.” She smiled. “I feel it too. And that craving isabout to be satisfied.”“It is?” He felt emboldened and took a step toward her.“Completely.” She held up a room-service menu. “I ordered everything they’vegot.”The feast was sumptuous. They dined together by moonlight… sitting on theirbalcony… savoring frisйe, truffles, and risotto. They sipped Dolcetto wine andtalked late into the night.Langdon did not need to be a symbologist to read the signs Vittoria was sendinghim. During dessert of boysenberry cream with savoiardi and steaming Romcaffй,Vittoria pressed her bare legs against his beneath the table and fixed him witha sultry stare. She seemed to be willing him to set down his fork and carry heroff in his arms.But Langdon did nothing. He remained the perfect gentleman. Two can play at thisgame, he thought, hiding a roguish smile.When all the food was eaten, Langdon retired to the edge of his bed where he satalone, turning the Illuminati Diamond over and over in his hands, makingrepeated comments about the miracle of its symmetry. Vittoria stared at him, herconfusion growing to an obvious frustration.“You find that ambigram terribly interesting, don’t you?” she demanded.Langdon nodded. “Mesmerizing.”“Would you say it’s the most interesting thing in this room?”Langdon scratched his head, making a show of pondering it. “Well, there is onething that interests me more.”She smiled and took a step toward him. “That being?”“How you disproved that Einstein theory using tuna fish.”Vittoria threw up her hands. “Dio mмo! Enough with the tuna fish! Don’t playwith me, I’m warning you.”Langdon grinned. “Maybe for your next experiment, you could study flounders andprove the earth is flat.”Vittoria was steaming now, but the first faint hints of an exasperated smileappeared on her lips. “For your information, professor, my next experiment willmake scientific history. I plan to prove neutrinos have mass.”“Neutrinos have mass?” Langdon shot her a stunned look. “I didn’t even know theywere Catholic!”With one fluid motion, she was on him, pinning him down. “I hope you believe inlife after death, Robert Langdon.” Vittoria was laughing as she straddled him,her hands holding him down, her eyes ablaze with a mischievous fire.“Actually,” he choked, laughing harder now, “I’ve always had trouble picturinganything beyond this world.”“Really? So you’ve never had a religious experience? A perfect moment ofglorious rapture?”Langdon shook his head. “No, and I seriously doubt I’m the kind of man who couldever have a religious experience.”Vittoria slipped off her robe. “You’ve never been to bed with a yoga master,have you?”"},{"pageContent":"Table of Contents1 [Angels_Demons_split_001.html#filepos6332]2 [Angels_Demons_split_002.html#filepos14798]3
