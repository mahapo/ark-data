Their persistence has kept me underground …forced me to live in purgatory … laboring beneath the earth like a chthonicmonster.I am the Shade.Here aboveground, I raise my eyes to the north, but I am unable to find a directpath to salvation … for the Apennine Mountains are blotting out the first lightof dawn.I pass behind the palazzo with its crenellated tower and one-handed clock …snaking through the early-morning vendors in Piazza di San Firenze with theirhoarse voices smelling of lampredotto and roasted olives. Crossing before theBargello, I cut west toward the spire of the Badia and come up hard against theiron gate at the base of the stairs.Here all hesitation must be left behind.I turn the handle and step into the passage from which I know there will be noreturn. I urge my leaden legs up the narrow staircase … spiraling skyward onsoft marble treads, pitted and worn.The voices echo from below. Beseeching.They are behind me, unyielding, closing in.They do not understand what is coming … nor what I have done for them!Ungrateful land!As I climb, the visions come hard … the lustful bodies writhing in fiery rain,the gluttonous souls floating in excrement, the treacherous villains frozen inSatan’s icy grasp.I climb the final stairs and arrive at the top, staggering near dead into thedamp morning air. I rush to the head-high wall, peering through the slits. Farbelow is the blessed city that I have made my sanctuary from those who exiledme.The voices call out, arriving close behind me. “What you’ve done is madness!”Madness breeds madness.“For the love of God,” they shout, “tell us where you’ve hidden it!”For precisely the love of God, I will not.I stand now, cornered, my back to the cold stone. They stare deep into my cleargreen eyes, and their expressions darken, no longer cajoling, but threatening.“You know we have our methods. We can force you to tell us where it is.”For that reason, I have climbed halfway to heaven.Without warning, I turn and reach up, curling my fingers onto the high ledge,pulling myself up, scrambling onto my knees, then standing … unsteady at theprecipice. Guide me, dear Virgil, across the void.They rush forward in disbelief, wanting to grab at my feet, but fearing theywill upset my balance and knock me off. They beg now, in quiet desperation, butI have turned my back. I know what I must do.Beneath me, dizzyingly far beneath me, the red tile roofs spread out like a seaof fire on the countryside, illuminating the fair land upon which giants onceroamed … Giotto, Donatello, Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, Botticelli.I inch my toes to the edge.“Come down!” they shout. “It’s not too late!”O, willful ignorants! Do you not see the future? Do you not grasp the splendorof my creation? The necessity?I will gladly make this ultimate sacrifice … and with it I will extinguish yourfinal hope of finding what you seek.You will never locate it in time.Hundreds of feet below, the cobblestone piazza beckons like a tranquil oasis.How I long for more time … but time is the one commodity even my vast fortunescannot afford.In these final seconds, I gaze down at the piazza, and I behold a sight thatstartles me.I see your face.You are gazing up at me from the shadows. Your eyes are mournful, and yet inthem I sense a veneration for what I have accomplished. You understand I have nochoice. For the love of Mankind, I must protect my masterpiece.It grows even now … waiting … simmering beneath the bloodred waters of thelagoon that reflects no stars.And so, I lift my eyes from yours and I contemplate the horizon. High above thisburdened world, I make my final supplication.Dearest God, I pray the world remembers my name not as a monstrous sinner, butas the glorious savior you know I truly am. I pray Mankind will understand thegift I leave behind.My gift is the future.My gift is salvation.My gift is Inferno.With that, I whisper my amen … and take my final step, into the abyss."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1THE MEMORIES MATERIALIZED slowly … like bubbles surfacing from the darkness of abottomless well.A veiled woman.Robert Langdon gazed at her across a river whose churning waters ran red withblood. On the far bank, the woman stood facing him, motionless, solemn, her facehidden by a shroud. In her hand she gripped a blue tainia cloth, which she nowraised in honor of the sea of corpses at her feet. The smell of death hungeverywhere.Seek, the woman whispered. And ye shall find.Langdon heard the words as if she had spoken them inside his head. “Who areyou?” he called out, but his voice made no sound.Time grows short, she whispered. Seek and find.Langdon took a step toward the river, but he could see the waters were bloodredand too deep to traverse. When Langdon raised his eyes again to the veiledwoman, the bodies at her feet had multiplied. There were hundreds of them now,maybe thousands, some still alive, writhing in agony, dying unthinkable deaths …consumed by fire, buried in feces, devouring one another. He could hear themournful cries of human suffering echoing across the water.The woman moved toward him, holding out her slender hands, as if beckoning forhelp.“Who are you?!” Langdon again shouted.In response, the woman reached up and slowly lifted the veil from her face. Shewas strikingly beautiful, and yet older than Langdon had imagined—in her sixtiesperhaps, stately and strong, like a timeless statue. She had a sternly set jaw,deep soulful eyes, and long, silver-gray hair that cascaded over her shouldersin ringlets. An amulet of lapis lazuli hung around her neck—a single snakecoiled around a staff.Langdon sensed he knew her … trusted her. But how? Why?She pointed now to a writhing pair of legs, which protruded upside down from theearth, apparently belonging to some poor soul who had been buried headfirst tohis waist. The man’s pale thigh bore a single letter—written in mud—R.R? Langdon thought, uncertain. As in … Robert? “Is that … me?”The woman’s face revealed nothing. Seek and find, she repeated.Without warning, she began radiating a white light … brighter and brighter. Herentire body started vibrating intensely, and then, in a rush of thunder, sheexploded into a thousand splintering shards of light.Langdon bolted awake, shouting.The room was bright. He was alone. The sharp smell of medicinal alcohol hung inthe air, and somewhere a machine pinged in quiet rhythm with his heart. Langdontried to move his right arm, but a sharp pain restrained him. He looked down andsaw an IV tugging at the skin of his forearm.His pulse quickened, and the machines kept pace, pinging more rapidly.Where am I? What happened?The back of Langdon’s head throbbed, a gnawing pain. Gingerly, he reached upwith his free arm and touched his scalp, trying to locate the source of hisheadache. Beneath his matted hair, he found the hard nubs of a dozen or sostitches caked with dried blood.He closed his eyes, trying to remember an accident.Nothing. A total blank.Think.Only darkness.A man in scrubs hurried in, apparently alerted by Langdon’s racing heartmonitor. He had a shaggy beard, bushy mustache, and gentle eyes that radiated athoughtful calm beneath his overgrown eyebrows.“What … happened?” Langdon managed. “Did I have an accident?”The bearded man put a finger to his lips and then rushed out, calling forsomeone down the hall.Langdon turned his head, but the movement sent a spike of pain radiating throughhis skull. He took deep breaths and let the pain pass. Then, very gently andmethodically, he surveyed his sterile surroundings.The hospital room had a single bed. No flowers. No cards. Langdon saw hisclothes on a nearby counter, folded inside a clear plastic bag. They werecovered with blood.My God. It must have been bad.Now Langdon rotated his head very slowly toward the window beside his bed. Itwas dark outside. Night. All Langdon could see in the glass was his ownreflection—an ashen stranger, pale and weary, attached to tubes and wires,surrounded by medical equipment.Voices approached in the hall, and Langdon turned his gaze back toward the room.The doctor returned, now accompanied by a woman.She appeared to be in her early thirties. She wore blue scrubs and had tied herblond hair back in a thick ponytail that swung behind her as she walked.“I’m Dr. Sienna Brooks,” she said, giving Langdon a smile as she entered. “I’llbe working with Dr. Marconi tonight.”Langdon nodded weakly.Tall and lissome, Dr. Brooks moved with the assertive gait of an athlete. Evenin shapeless scrubs, she had a willowy elegance about her. Despite the absenceof any makeup that Langdon could see, her complexion appeared unusually smooth,the only blemish a tiny beauty mark just above her lips. Her eyes, though agentle brown, seemed unusually penetrating, as if they had witnessed aprofundity of experience rarely encountered by a person her age.“Dr. Marconi doesn’t speak much English,” she said, sitting down beside him,“and he asked me to fill out your admittance form.” She gave him another smile.“Thanks,” Langdon croaked.“Okay,” she began, her tone businesslike. “What is your name?”It took him a moment. “Robert … Langdon.”She shone a penlight in Langdon’s eyes. “Occupation?”This information surfaced even more slowly. “Professor. Art history … andsymbology. Harvard University.”Dr. Brooks lowered the light, looking startled. The doctor with the bushyeyebrows looked equally surprised.“You’re … an American?”Langdon gave her a confused look.“It’s just …” She hesitated. “You had no identification when you arrivedtonight. You were wearing Harris Tweed and Somerset loafers, so we guessedBritish.”“I’m American,” Langdon assured her, too exhausted to explain his preference forwell-tailored clothing.“Any pain?”“My head,” Langdon replied, his throbbing skull only made worse by the brightpenlight. Thankfully, she now pocketed it, taking Langdon’s wrist and checkinghis pulse.“You woke up shouting,” the woman said. “Do you remember why?”Langdon flashed again on the strange vision of the veiled woman surrounded bywrithing bodies. Seek and ye shall find. “I was having a nightmare.”“About?”Langdon told her.Dr. Brooks’s expression remained neutral as she made notes on a clipboard. “Anyidea what might have sparked such a frightening vision?”Langdon probed his memory and then shook his head, which pounded in protest.“Okay, Mr. Langdon,” she said, still writing, “a couple of routine questions foryou. What day of the week is it?”Langdon thought for a moment. “It’s Saturday. I remember earlier today walkingacross campus … going to an afternoon lecture series, and then … that’s prettymuch the last thing I remember. Did I fall?”“We’ll get to that. Do you know where you are?”Langdon took his best guess. “Massachusetts General Hospital?”Dr. Brooks made another note. “And is there someone we should call for you?Wife? Children?”“Nobody,” Langdon replied instinctively. He had always enjoyed the solitude andindependence provided him by his chosen life of bachelorhood, although he had toadmit, in his current situation, he’d prefer to have a familiar face at hisside. “There are some colleagues I could call, but I’m fine.”Dr. Brooks finished writing, and the older doctor approached. Smoothing back hisbushy eyebrows, he produced a small voice recorder from his pocket and showed itto Dr. Brooks. She nodded in understanding and turned back to her patient.“Mr. Langdon, when you arrived tonight, you were mumbling something over andover.” She glanced at Dr. Marconi, who held up the digital recorder and presseda button.A recording began to play, and Langdon heard his own groggy voice, repeatedlymuttering the same phrase: “Ve … sorry. Ve … sorry.”“It sounds to me,” the woman said, “like you’re saying, ‘Very sorry. Verysorry.’ ”Langdon agreed, and yet he had no recollection of it.Dr. Brooks fixed him with a disquietingly intense stare. “Do you have any ideawhy you’d be saying this? Are you sorry about something?”As Langdon probed the dark recesses of his memory, he again saw the veiledwoman. She was standing on the banks of a bloodred river surrounded by bodies.The stench of death returned.Langdon was overcome by a sudden, instinctive sense of danger … not just forhimself … but for everyone. The pinging of his heart monitor acceleratedrapidly. His muscles tightened, and he tried to sit up.Dr. Brooks quickly placed a firm hand on Langdon’s sternum, forcing him backdown. She shot a glance at the bearded doctor, who walked over to a nearbycounter and began preparing something.Dr. Brooks hovered over Langdon, whispering now. “Mr. Langdon, anxiety is commonwith brain injuries, but you need to keep your pulse rate down. No movement. Noexcitement. Just lie still and rest. You’ll be okay. Your memory will come backslowly.”The doctor returned now with a syringe, which he handed to Dr. Brooks. Sheinjected its contents into Langdon’s IV.“Just a mild sedative to calm you down,” she explained, “and also to help withthe pain.” She stood to go. “You’ll be fine, Mr. Langdon. Just sleep. If youneed anything, press the button on your bedside.”She turned out the light and departed with the bearded doctor.In the darkness, Langdon felt the drugs washing through his system almostinstantly, dragging his body back down into that deep well from which he hademerged. He fought the feeling, forcing his eyes open in the darkness of hisroom. He tried to sit up, but his body felt like cement.As Langdon shifted, he found himself again facing the window. The lights wereout, and in the dark glass, his own reflection had disappeared, replaced by anilluminated skyline in the distance.Amid a contour of spires and domes, a single regal facade dominated Langdon’sfield of view. The building was an imposing stone fortress with a notchedparapet and a three-hundred-foot tower that swelled near the top, bulgingoutward into a massive machicolated battlement.Langdon sat bolt upright in bed, pain exploding in his head. He fought off thesearing throb and fixed his gaze on the tower.Langdon knew the medieval structure well.It was unique in the world.Unfortunately, it was also located four thousand miles from Massachusetts.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Outside his window, hidden in the shadows of the Via Torregalli, a powerfullybuilt woman effortlessly unstraddled her BMW motorcycle and advanced with theintensity of a panther stalking its prey. Her gaze was sharp. Her close-croppedhair—styled into spikes—stood out against the upturned collar of her blackleather riding suit. She checked her silenced weapon, and stared up at thewindow where Robert Langdon’s light had just gone out.Earlier tonight her original mission had gone horribly awry.The coo of a single dove had changed everything.Now she had come to make it right."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2I’M IN FLORENCE!?Robert Langdon’s head throbbed. He was now seated upright in his hospital bed,repeatedly jamming his finger into the call button. Despite the sedatives in hissystem, his heart was racing.Dr. Brooks hurried back in, her ponytail bobbing. “Are you okay?”Langdon shook his head in bewilderment. “I’m in … Italy!?”“Good,” she said. “You’re remembering.”“No!” Langdon pointed out the window at the commanding edifice in the distance.“I recognize the Palazzo Vecchio.”Dr. Brooks flicked the lights back on, and the Florence skyline disappeared. Shecame to his bedside, whispering calmly. “Mr. Langdon, there’s no need to worry.You’re suffering from mild amnesia, but Dr. Marconi confirmed that your brainfunction is fine.”The bearded doctor rushed in as well, apparently hearing the call button. Hechecked Langdon’s heart monitor as the young doctor spoke to him in rapid,fluent Italian—something about how Langdon was “agitato” to learn he was inItaly.Agitated? Langdon thought angrily. More like stupefied! The adrenaline surgingthrough his system was now doing battle with the sedatives. “What happened tome?” he demanded. “What day is it?!”“Everything is fine,” she said. “It’s early morning. Monday, March eighteenth.”Monday. Langdon forced his aching mind to reel back to the last images he couldrecall—cold and dark—walking alone across the Harvard campus to a Saturday-nightlecture series. That was two days ago?! A sharper panic now gripped him as hetried to recall anything at all from the lecture or afterward. Nothing. The pingof his heart monitor accelerated.The older doctor scratched at his beard and continued adjusting equipment whileDr. Brooks sat again beside Langdon.“You’re going to be okay,” she reassured him, speaking gently. “We’ve diagnosedyou with retrograde amnesia, which is very common in head trauma. Your memoriesof the past few days may be muddled or missing, but you should suffer nopermanent damage.” She paused. “Do you remember my first name? I told you when Iwalked in.”Langdon thought a moment. “Sienna.” Dr. Sienna Brooks.She smiled. “See? You’re already forming new memories.”The pain in Langdon’s head was almost unbearable, and his near-field visionremained blurry. “What … happened? How did I get here?”“I think you should rest, and maybe—”“How did I get here?!” he demanded, his heart monitor accelerating further.“Okay, just breathe easy,” Dr. Brooks said, exchanging a nervous look with hercolleague. “I’ll tell you.” Her voice turned markedly more serious. “Mr.Langdon, three hours ago, you staggered into our emergency room, bleeding from ahead wound, and you immediately collapsed. Nobody had any idea who you were orhow you got here. You were mumbling in English, so Dr. Marconi asked me toassist. I’m on sabbatical here from the U.K.”Langdon felt like he had awoken inside a Max Ernst painting. What the hell am Idoing in Italy? Normally Langdon came here every other June for an artconference, but this was March.The sedatives pulled harder at him now, and he felt as if earth’s gravity weregrowing stronger by the second, trying to drag him down through his mattress.Langdon fought it, hoisting his head, trying to stay alert.Dr. Brooks leaned over him, hovering like an angel. “Please, Mr. Langdon,” shewhispered. “Head trauma is delicate in the first twenty-four hours. You need torest, or you could do serious damage.”A voice crackled suddenly on the room’s intercom. “Dr. Marconi?”The bearded doctor touched a button on the wall and replied, “Sì?”The voice on the intercom spoke in rapid Italian. Langdon didn’t catch what itsaid, but he did catch the two doctors exchanging a look of surprise. Or is italarm?“Momento,” Marconi replied, ending the conversation.“What’s going on?” Langdon asked.Dr. Brooks’s eyes seemed to narrow a bit. “That was the ICU receptionist.Someone’s here to visit you.”A ray of hope cut through Langdon’s grogginess. “That’s good news! Maybe thisperson knows what happened to me.”She looked uncertain. “It’s just odd that someone’s here. We didn’t have yourname, and you’re not even registered in the system yet.”Langdon battled the sedatives and awkwardly hoisted himself upright in his bed.“If someone knows I’m here, that person must know what happened!”Dr. Brooks glanced at Dr. Marconi, who immediately shook his head and tapped hiswatch. She turned back to Langdon.“This is the ICU,” she explained. “Nobody is allowed in until nine A.M. at theearliest. In a moment Dr. Marconi will go out and see who the visitor is andwhat he or she wants.”“What about what I want?” Langdon demanded.Dr. Brooks smiled patiently and lowered her voice, leaning closer. “Mr. Langdon,there are some things you don’t know about last night … about what happened toyou. And before you speak to anyone, I think it’s only fair that you have allthe facts. Unfortunately, I don’t think you’re strong enough yet to—”“What facts!?” Langdon demanded, struggling to prop himself higher. The IV inhis arm pinched, and his body felt like it weighed several hundred pounds. “AllI know is I’m in a Florence hospital and I arrived repeating the words ‘verysorry …’ ”A frightening thought now occurred to him.“Was I responsible for a car accident?” Langdon asked. “Did I hurt someone?!”“No, no,” she said. “I don’t believe so.”“Then what?” Langdon insisted, eyeing both doctors furiously. “I have a right toknow what’s going on!”There was a long silence, and Dr. Marconi finally gave his attractive youngcolleague a reluctant nod. Dr. Brooks exhaled and moved closer to his bedside.“Okay, let me tell you what I know … and you’ll listen calmly, agreed?”Langdon nodded, the head movement sending a jolt of pain radiating through hisskull. He ignored it, eager for answers.“The first thing is this … Your head wound was not caused by an accident.”“Well, that’s a relief.”“Not really. Your wound, in fact, was caused by a bullet.”Langdon’s heart monitor pinged faster. “I beg your pardon!?”Dr. Brooks spoke steadily but quickly. “A bullet grazed the top of your skulland most likely gave you a concussion. You’re very lucky to be alive. An inchlower, and …” She shook her head.Langdon stared at her in disbelief. Someone shot me?Angry voices erupted in the hall as an argument broke out. It sounded as ifwhoever had arrived to visit Langdon did not want to wait. Almost immediately,Langdon heard a heavy door at the far end of the hallway burst open. He watcheduntil he saw a figure approaching down the corridor.The woman was dressed entirely in black leather. She was toned and strong withdark, spiked hair. She moved effortlessly, as if her feet weren’t touching theground, and she was headed directly for Langdon’s room.Without hesitation, Dr. Marconi stepped into the open doorway to block thevisitor’s passage. “Ferma!” the man commanded, holding out his palm like apoliceman.The stranger, without breaking stride, produced a silenced handgun. She aimeddirectly at Dr. Marconi’s chest and fired.There was a staccato hiss.Langdon watched in horror as Dr. Marconi staggered backward into the room,falling to the floor, clutching his chest, his white lab coat drenched in blood."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3FIVE MILES OFF the coast of Italy, the 237-foot luxury yacht The Mendaciummotored through the predawn mist that rose from the gently rolling swells of theAdriatic. The ship’s stealth-profile hull was painted gunmetal gray, giving itthe distinctly unwelcoming aura of a military vessel.With a price tag of over 300 million U.S. dollars, the craft boasted all theusual amenities—spa, pool, cinema, personal submarine, and helicopter pad. Theship’s creature comforts, however, were of little interest to its owner, who hadtaken delivery of the yacht five years ago and immediately gutted most of thesespaces to install a lead-lined, military-grade, electronic command center.Fed by three dedicated satellite links and a redundant array of terrestrialrelay stations, the control room on The Mendacium had a staff of nearly twodozen—technicians, analysts, operation coordinators—who lived on board andremained in constant contact with the organization’s various land-basedoperation centers.The ship’s onboard security included a small unit of military-trained soldiers,two missile-detection systems, and an arsenal of the latest weapons available.Other support staff—cooks, cleaning, and service—pushed the total number onboard to more than forty. The Mendacium was, in effect, the portable officebuilding from which the owner ran his empire.Known to his employees only as “the provost,” he was a tiny, stunted man withtanned skin and deep-set eyes. His unimposing physique and direct manner seemedwell suited to one who had made a vast fortune providing a private menu ofcovert services along the shadowy fringes of society.He had been called many things—a soulless mercenary, a facilitator of sin, thedevil’s enabler—but he was none of these. The provost simply provided hisclients with the opportunity to pursue their ambitions and desires withoutconsequence; that mankind was sinful in nature was not his problem.Despite his detractors and their ethical objections, the provost’s moral compasswas a fixed star. He had built his reputation—and the Consortium itself—on twogolden rules.Never make a promise you cannot keep.And never lie to a client.Ever.In his professional career, the provost had never broken a promise or reneged ona deal. His word was bankable—an absolute guarantee—and while there werecertainly contracts he regretted having made, backing out of them was never anoption.This morning, as he stepped onto the private balcony of his yacht’s stateroom,the provost looked across the churning sea and tried to fend off the disquietthat had settled in his gut.The decisions of our past are the architects of our present.The decisions of the provost’s past had put him in a position to negotiatealmost any minefield and always come out on top. Today, however, as he gazed outthe window at the distant lights of the Italian mainland, he feltuncharacteristically on edge.One year ago, on this very yacht, he had made a decision whose ramifications nowthreatened to unravel everything he had built. I agreed to provide services tothe wrong man. There had been no way the provost could have known at the time,and yet now the miscalculation had brought a tempest of unforeseen challenges,forcing him to send some of his best agents into the field with orders to do“whatever it took” to keep his listing ship from capsizing.At the moment the provost was waiting to hear from one field agent inparticular.Vayentha, he thought, picturing the sinewy, spike-haired specialist. Vayentha,who had served him perfectly until this mission, had made a mistake last nightthat had dire consequences. The last six hours had been a scramble, a desperateattempt to regain control of the situation.Vayentha claimed her error was the result of simple bad luck—the untimely coo ofa dove.The provost, however, did not believe in luck. Everything he did wasorchestrated to eradicate randomness and remove chance. Control was theprovost’s expertise—foreseeing every possibility, anticipating every response,and molding reality toward the desired outcome. He had an immaculate trackrecord of success and secrecy, and with it came a staggeringclientele—billionaires, politicians, sheikhs, and even entire governments.To the east, the first faint light of morning had begun to consume the loweststars on the horizon. On the deck the provost stood and patiently awaited wordfrom Vayentha that her mission had gone exactly as planned."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4FOR AN INSTANT, Langdon felt as if time had stopped.Dr. Marconi lay motionless on the floor, blood gushing from his chest. Fightingthe sedatives in his system, Langdon raised his eyes to the spike-hairedassassin, who was still striding down the hall, covering the last few yardstoward his open door. As she neared the threshold, she looked toward Langdon andinstantly swung her weapon in his direction … aiming at his head.I’m going to die, Langdon realized. Here and now.The bang was deafening in the small hospital room.Langdon recoiled, certain he had been shot, but the noise had not been theattacker’s gun. Rather, the bang had been the slam of the room’s heavy metaldoor as Dr. Brooks threw herself against it and turned the lock.Eyes wild with fear, Dr. Brooks immediately spun and crouched beside herblood-soaked colleague, searching for a pulse. Dr. Marconi coughed up a mouthfulof blood, which dribbled down his cheek across his thick beard. Then he felllimp.“Enrico, no! Ti prego!” she screamed.Outside, a barrage of bullets exploded against the metal exterior of the door.Shouts of alarm filled the hall.Somehow, Langdon’s body was in motion, panic and instinct now overruling hissedatives. As he clambered awkwardly out of bed, a searing hot pain tore intohis right forearm. For an instant, he thought a bullet had passed through thedoor and hit him, but when he looked down, he realized his IV had snapped off inhis arm. The plastic catheter poked out of a jagged hole in his forearm, andwarm blood was already flowing backward out of the tube.Langdon was now fully awake.Crouched beside Marconi’s body, Dr. Brooks kept searching for a pulse as tearswelled in her eyes. Then, as if a switch had been flipped inside her, she stoodand turned to Langdon. Her expression transformed before his eyes, her youngfeatures hardening with all the detached composure of a seasoned ER doctordealing with a crisis.“Follow me,” she commanded.Dr. Brooks grabbed Langdon’s arm and pulled him across the room. The sounds ofgunfire and chaos continued in the hallway as Langdon lurched forward onunstable legs. His mind felt alert but his heavily drugged body was slow torespond. Move! The tile floor felt cold beneath his feet, and his thin hospitaljohnny was scarcely long enough to cover his six-foot frame. He could feel blooddripping down his forearm and pooling in his palm.Bullets continued to slam against the heavy doorknob, and Dr. Brooks pushedLangdon roughly into a small bathroom. She was about to follow when she paused,turned around, and ran back toward the counter and grabbed his bloody HarrisTweed.Forget my damned jacket!She returned clutching his jacket and quickly locked the bathroom door. Justthen, the door in the outer room crashed open.The young doctor took control. She strode through the tiny bathroom to a seconddoor, yanked it open, and led Langdon into an adjoining recovery room. Gunfireechoed behind them as Dr. Brooks stuck her head out into the hallway and quicklygrabbed Langdon’s arm, pulling him across the corridor into a stairwell. Thesudden motion made Langdon dizzy; he sensed that he could pass out at anymoment.The next fifteen seconds were a blur … descending stairs … stumbling … falling.The pounding in Langdon’s head was almost unbearable. His vision seemed evenmore blurry now, and his muscles were sluggish, each movement feeling like adelayed reaction.And then the air grew cold.I’m outside.As Dr. Brooks hustled him along a dark alley away from the building, Langdonstepped on something sharp and fell, hitting the pavement hard. She struggled toget him back to his feet, cursing out loud the fact that he had been sedated.As they neared the end of the alley, Langdon stumbled again. This time she lefthim on the ground, rushing into the street and yelling to someone in thedistance. Langdon could make out the faint green light of a taxi parked in frontof the hospital. The car didn’t move, its driver undoubtedly asleep. Dr. Brooksscreamed and waved her arms wildly. Finally the taxi’s headlights came on and itmoved lazily toward them.Behind Langdon in the alley, a door burst open, followed by the sound of rapidlyapproaching footsteps. He turned and saw the dark figure bounding toward him.Langdon tried to get back to his feet, but the doctor was already grabbing him,forcing him into the backseat of an idling Fiat taxi. He landed half on the seatand half on the floor as Dr. Brooks dove on top of him, yanking the door shut.The sleepy-eyed driver turned and stared at the bizarre duo that had justtumbled into his cab—a young, ponytailed woman in scrubs and a man in ahalf-torn johnny with a bleeding arm. He clearly was about ready to tell them toget the hell out of his car, when the side mirror exploded. The woman in blackleather sprinted out of the alley, gun extended. Her pistol hissed again just asDr. Brooks grabbed Langdon’s head, pulling it down. The rear window exploded,showering them with glass.The driver needed no further encouragement. He slammed his foot down on the gas,and the taxi peeled out.Langdon teetered on the brink of consciousness. Someone is trying to kill me?Once they had rounded a corner, Dr. Brooks sat up and grabbed Langdon’s bloodyarm. The catheter was protruding awkwardly from a hole in his flesh.“Look out the window,” she commanded.Langdon obeyed. Outside, ghostly tombstones rushed by in the darkness. It seemedsomehow fitting that they were passing a cemetery. Langdon felt the doctor’sfingers probing gently for the catheter and then, without warning, she wrenchedit out.A searing bolt of pain traveled directly to Langdon’s head. He felt his eyesrolling back, and then everything went black."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5THE SHRILL RING of his phone drew the provost’s gaze from the calming mist ofthe Adriatic, and he quickly stepped back into his stateroom office.It’s about time, he thought, eager for news.The computer screen on his desk had flickered to life, informing him that theincoming call was from a Swedish Sectra Tiger XS personal voice-encryptingphone, which had been redirected through four untraceable routers before beingconnected to his ship.He donned his headset. “This is the provost,” he answered, his words slow andmeticulous. “Go ahead.”“It’s Vayentha,” the voice replied.The provost sensed an unusual nervousness in her tone. Field agents rarely spoketo the provost directly, and even more rarely did they remain in his employafter a debacle like the one last night. Nonetheless, the provost had requiredan agent on-site to help remedy the crisis, and Vayentha had been the bestperson for the job.“I have an update,” Vayentha said.The provost was silent, his cue for her to continue.When she spoke, her tone was emotionless, clearly an attempt at professionalism.“Langdon has escaped,” she said. “He has the object.”The provost sat down at his desk and remained silent for a very long time.“Understood,” he finally said. “I imagine he will reach out to the authoritiesas soon as he possibly can.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Two decks beneath the provost, in the ship’s secure control center, seniorfacilitator Laurence Knowlton sat in his private cubicle and noticed that theprovost’s encrypted call had ended. He hoped the news was good. The provost’stension had been palpable for the past two days, and every operative on boardsensed there was some kind of high-stakes operation going on.The stakes are inconceivably high, and Vayentha had better get it right thistime.Knowlton was accustomed to quarterbacking carefully constructed game plans, butthis particular scenario had disintegrated into chaos, and the provost had takenover personally.We’ve moved into uncharted territory.Although a half-dozen other missions were currently in process around the world,all of them were being serviced by the Consortium’s various field offices,freeing the provost and his staff aboard The Mendacium to focus exclusively onthis one.Their client had jumped to his death several days ago in Florence, but theConsortium still had numerous outstanding services on his docket—specific tasksthe man had entrusted to this organization regardless of the circumstances—andthe Consortium, as always, intended to follow through without question.I have my orders, Knowlton thought, fully intending to comply. He exited hissoundproofed glass cubicle, walking past a half-dozen other chambers—sometransparent, some opaque—in which duty officers were handling other aspects ofthis same mission.Knowlton crossed through the thin, processed air of the main control room,nodding to the tech crew, and entered a small walk-in vault containing a dozenstrongboxes. He opened one of the boxes and retrieved its contents—in this case,a bright red memory stick. According to the task card attached, the memory stickcontained a large video file, which the client had directed them to upload tokey media outlets at a specific time tomorrow morning.Tomorrow’s anonymous upload would be simple enough, but in keeping protocol forall digital files, the flowchart had flagged this file for reviewtoday—twenty-four hours prior to delivery—to ensure the Consortium had adequatetime to perform any necessary decryption, compiling, or other preparation thatmight be required before uploading it at the precise hour.Nothing left to chance.Knowlton returned to his transparent cubicle and closed the heavy glass door,blocking out the outside world.He flipped a switch on the wall, and his cubicle instantly turned opaque. Forprivacy, all of the glass-walled offices aboard The Mendacium were built with“suspended particle device” glass. The transparency of SPD glass was easilycontrolled by the application or removal of an electric current, which eitheraligned or randomized millions of tiny rodlike particles suspended within thepanel.Compartmentalization was a cornerstone of the Consortium’s success.Know only your own mission. Share nothing.Now, ensconced in his private space, Knowlton inserted the memory stick into hiscomputer and clicked the file to begin his assessment.Immediately his screen faded to black … and his speakers began playing the softsound of lapping water. An image slowly appeared onscreen … amorphous andshadowy. Emerging from the darkness, a scene began to take shape … the interiorof a cave … or a giant chamber of some sort. The floor of the cavern was water,like an underground lake. Strangely, the water appeared to be illuminated … asif from within.Knowlton had never seen anything like it. The entire cavern shone with an eeriereddish hue, its pale walls awash with tendril-like reflections of ripplingwater. What … is this place?As the lapping continued, the camera began to tilt downward and descendvertically, directly toward the water until the camera pierced the illuminatedsurface. The sounds of rippling disappeared, replaced by an eerie hush beneaththe water. Submerged now, the camera kept descending, moving down throughseveral feet of water until it stopped, focusing on the cavern’s silt-coveredfloor.Bolted to the floor was a rectangular plaque of shimmering titanium.The plaque bore an inscription.IN THIS PLACE, ON THIS DATE,THE WORLD WAS CHANGED FOREVER.Engraved at the bottom of the plaque was a name and a date.The name was that of their client.The date … tomorrow."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6LANGDON FELT FIRM hands lifting him now … urging him from his delirium, helpinghim out of the taxi. The pavement felt cold beneath his bare feet.Half supported by the slender frame of Dr. Brooks, Langdon staggered down adeserted walkway between two apartment buildings. The dawn air rustled,billowing his hospital gown, and Langdon felt cold air in places he knew heshouldn’t.The sedative he’d been given in the hospital had left his mind as blurred as hisvision. Langdon felt like he was underwater, attempting to claw his way througha viscous, dimly lit world. Sienna Brooks dragged him onward, supporting himwith surprising strength.“Stairs,” she said, and Langdon realized they had reached a side entrance of thebuilding.Langdon gripped the railing and trudged dizzily upward, one step at a time. Hisbody felt ponderous. Dr. Brooks physically pushed him now. When they reached thelanding, she typed some numbers into a rusted old keypad and the door buzzedopen.The air inside was not much warmer, but the tile floors felt like soft carpet onthe soles of his feet compared to the rough pavement outside. Dr. Brooks ledLangdon to a tiny elevator and yanked open a folding door, herding Langdon intoa cubicle that was about the size of a phone booth. The air inside smelled of MScigarettes—a bittersweet fragrance as ubiquitous in Italy as the aroma of freshespresso. Ever so slightly, the smell helped clear Langdon’s mind. Dr. Brookspressed a button, and somewhere high above them, a series of tired gears clunkedand whirred into motion.Upward …The creaky carriage shimmied and vibrated as it began its ascent. Because thewalls were nothing but metal screens, Langdon found himself watching the insideof the elevator shaft slide rhythmically past them. Even in his semiconsciousstate, Langdon’s lifelong fear of cramped spaces was alive and well.Don’t look.He leaned on the wall, trying to catch his breath. His forearm ached, and whenhe looked down, he saw that the sleeve of his Harris Tweed had been tiedawkwardly around his arm like a bandage. The remainder of the jacket wasdragging behind him on the ground, frayed and filthy.He closed his eyes against his pounding headache, but the blackness engulfed himagain.A familiar vision materialized—the statuesque, veiled woman with the amulet andsilver hair in ringlets. As before, she was on the banks of a bloodred river andsurrounded by writhing bodies. She spoke to Langdon, her voice pleading. Seekand ye shall find!Langdon was overcome with the feeling that he had to save her … save them all.The half-buried, upside-down legs were falling limp … one by one.Who are you!? he called out in silence. What do you want?!Her luxuriant silver hair began fluttering in a hot wind. Our time grows short,she whispered, touching her amulet necklace. Then, without warning, she eruptedin a blinding pillar of fire, which billowed across the river, engulfing themboth.Langdon shouted, his eyes flying open.Dr. Brooks eyed him with concern. “What is it?”“I keep hallucinating!” Langdon exclaimed. “The same scene.”“The silver-haired woman? And all the dead bodies?”Langdon nodded, perspiration beading on his brow.“You’ll be okay,” she assured him, despite sounding shaky herself. “Recurringvisions are common with amnesia. The brain function that sorts and catalogs yourmemories has been temporarily shaken up, and so it throws everything into onepicture.”“Not a very nice picture,” he managed.“I know, but until you heal, your memories will be muddled and uncataloged—past,present, and imagination all mixed together. The same thing happens in dreams.”The elevator lurched to a stop, and Dr. Brooks yanked open the folding door.They were walking again, this time down a dark, narrow corridor. They passed awindow, outside of which the murky silhouettes of Florence rooftops had begunemerging in the predawn light. At the far end of the hall, she crouched down andretrieved a key from beneath a thirsty-looking houseplant and unlocked a door.The apartment was tiny, the air inside hinting at an ongoing battle between avanilla-scented candle and old carpeting. The furniture and artwork were meagerat best—as if she had furnished it at a yard sale. Dr. Brooks adjusted athermostat, and the radiators banged to life.She stood a moment and closed her eyes, exhaling heavily, as if to collectherself. Then she turned and helped Langdon into a modest kitchenette whoseFormica table had two flimsy chairs.Langdon made a move toward a chair in hopes of sitting down, but Dr. Brooksgrabbed his arm with one hand and opened a cabinet with her other. The cabinetwas nearly bare … crackers, a few bags of pasta, a can of Coke, and a bottle ofNoDoz.She took out the bottle and dumped six caplets into Langdon’s palm. “Caffeine,”she said. “For when I work night shifts like tonight.”Langdon put the pills in his mouth and glanced around for some water.“Chew them,” she said. “They’ll hit your system faster and help counteract thesedative.”Langdon began chewing and instantly cringed. The pills were bitter, clearlymeant to be swallowed whole. Dr. Brooks opened the refrigerator and handedLangdon a half-empty bottle of San Pellegrino. He gratefully took a long drink.The ponytailed doctor now took his right arm and removed the makeshift bandagethat she’d fashioned out of his jacket, which she laid on the kitchen table.Then she carefully examined his wound. As she held his bare arm, Langdon couldfeel her slender hands trembling.“You’ll live,” she announced.Langdon hoped she was going to be okay. He could barely fathom what they’d bothjust endured. “Dr. Brooks,” he said, “we need to call somebody. The consulate …the police. Somebody.”She nodded in agreement. “Also, you can stop calling me Dr. Brooks—my name isSienna.”Langdon nodded. “Thanks. I’m Robert.” It seemed the bond they’d just forgedfleeing for their lives warranted a first-name basis. “You said you’re British?”“By birth, yes.”“I don’t hear an accent.”“Good,” she replied. “I worked hard to lose it.”Langdon was about to inquire why, but Sienna motioned for him to follow. She ledhim down a narrow corridor to a small, gloomy bathroom. In the mirror above thesink, Langdon glimpsed his reflection for the first time since seeing it in thewindow of his hospital room.Not good. Langdon’s thick dark hair was matted, and his eyes looked bloodshotand weary. A shroud of stubble obscured his jaw.Sienna turned on the faucet and guided Langdon’s injured forearm under theice-cold water. It stung sharply, but he held it there, wincing.Sienna retrieved a fresh washcloth and squirted it with antibacterial soap. “Youmay want to look away.”“It’s fine. I’m not bothered by—”Sienna began scrubbing violently, and white-hot pain shot up Langdon’s arm. Heclenched his jaw to prevent himself from shouting out in protest.“You don’t want an infection,” she said, scrubbing harder now. “Besides, ifyou’re going to call the authorities, you’ll want to be more alert than you arenow. Nothing activates adrenaline production like pain.”Langdon held on for what felt like a full ten seconds of scrubbing before heforcefully yanked his arm away. Enough! Admittedly, he felt stronger and moreawake; the pain in his arm had now entirely overshadowed his headache.“Good,” she said, turning off the water and patting his arm dry with a cleantowel. Sienna then applied a small bandage to his forearm, but as she did so,Langdon found himself distracted by something he had just noticed—somethingdeeply upsetting to him.For nearly four decades, Langdon had worn an antique collector’s edition MickeyMouse timepiece, a gift from his parents. Mickey’s smiling face and wildlywaving arms had always served as his daily reminder to smile more often and takelife a little less seriously.“My … watch,” Langdon stammered. “It’s gone!” Without it, he felt suddenlyincomplete. “Was I wearing it when I arrived at the hospital?”Sienna shot him an incredulous look, clearly mystified that he could be worriedabout such a trivial thing. “I don’t remember any watch. Just clean yourself up.I’ll be back in a few minutes and we’ll figure out how to get you some help.”She turned to go, but paused in the doorway, locking eyes with him in themirror. “And while I’m gone, I suggest you think very hard about why someonewould want to kill you. I imagine it’s the first question the authorities willask.”“Wait, where are you going?”“You can’t talk to the police half naked. I’m going to find you some clothes. Myneighbor is about your size. He’s away, and I’m feeding his cat. He owes me.”With that, Sienna was gone.Robert Langdon turned back to the tiny mirror over the sink and barelyrecognized the person staring back at him. Someone wants me dead. In his mind,he again heard the recording of his own delirious mumblings.Very sorry. Very sorry.He probed his memory for some recollection … anything at all. He saw onlyemptiness. All Langdon knew was that he was in Florence, having suffered abullet wound to the head.As Langdon stared into his own weary eyes, he half wondered if he might at anymoment wake up in his reading chair at home, clutching an empty martini glassand a copy of Dead Souls, only to remind himself that Bombay Sapphire and Gogolshould never be mixed."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7LANGDON SHED HIS bloody hospital gown and wrapped a towel around his waist.After splashing water on his face, he gingerly touched the stitches on the backof his head. The skin was sore, but when he smoothed his matted hair down overthe spot, the injury all but disappeared. The caffeine pills were kicking in,and he finally felt the fog beginning to lift.Think, Robert. Try to remember.The windowless bathroom was suddenly feeling claustrophobic, and Langdon steppedinto the hall, moving instinctively toward a shaft of natural light that spilledthrough a partially open door across the corridor. The room was a makeshiftstudy of sorts, with a cheap desk, a worn swivel chair, assorted books on thefloor, and, thankfully … a window.Langdon moved toward daylight.In the distance, the rising Tuscan sun was just beginning to kiss the highestspires of the waking city—the campanile, the Badia, the Bargello. Langdonpressed his forehead to the cool glass. The March air was crisp and cold,amplifying the full spectrum of sunlight that now peeked up over the hillsides.Painter’s light, they called it.At the heart of the skyline, a mountainous dome of red tiles rose up, its zenithadorned with a gilt copper ball that glinted like a beacon. Il Duomo.Brunelleschi had made architectural history by engineering the basilica’smassive dome, and now, more than five hundred years later, the 375-foot-tallstructure still stood its ground, an immovable giant on Piazza del Duomo.Why would I be in Florence?For Langdon, a lifelong aficionado of Italian art, Florence had become one ofhis favorite destinations in all of Europe. This was the city on whose streetsMichelangelo played as a child, and in whose studios the Italian Renaissance hadignited. This was Florence, whose galleries lured millions of travelers toadmire Botticelli’s Birth of Venus, Leonardo’s Annunciation, and the city’spride and joy—Il Davide.Langdon had been mesmerized by Michelangelo’s David when he first saw it as ateenager … entering the Accademia delle Belle Arti … moving slowly through thesomber phalanx of Michelangelo’s crude Prigioni … and then feeling his gazedragged upward, inexorably, to the seventeen-foot-tall masterpiece. The David’ssheer enormity and defined musculature startled most first-time visitors, andyet for Langdon, it had been the genius of David’s pose that he found mostcaptivating. Michelangelo had employed the classical tradition of contrappostoto create the illusion that David was leaning to his right, his left leg bearingalmost no weight, when, in fact, his left leg was supporting tons of marble.The David had sparked in Langdon his first true appreciation for the power ofgreat sculpture. Now Langdon wondered if he had visited the masterpiece duringthe last several days, but the only memory he could conjure was that ofawakening in the hospital and watching an innocent doctor murdered before hiseyes. Very sorry. Very sorry.The guilt he felt was almost nauseating. What have I done?As he stood at the window, his peripheral vision caught a glimpse of a laptopcomputer sitting on the desk beside him. Whatever had happened to Langdon lastnight, he suddenly realized, might be in the news.If I can access the Internet, I might find answers.Langdon turned toward the doorway and called out: “Sienna?!”Silence. She was still at the neighbor’s apartment looking for clothes.Having no doubt Sienna would understand the intrusion, Langdon opened the laptopand powered it up.Sienna’s home screen flickered to life—a standard Windows “blue cloud”background. Langdon immediately went to the Google Italia search page and typedin Robert Langdon.If my students could see me now, he thought as he began the search. Langdoncontinually admonished his students for Googling themselves—a bizarre newpastime that reflected the obsession with personal celebrity that now seemed topossess American youth.A page of search results materialized—hundreds of hits pertaining to Langdon,his books, and his lectures. Not what I’m looking for.Langdon restricted the search by selecting the news button.A fresh page appeared: News results for “Robert Langdon.”Book signings: Robert Langdon to appear …Graduation address by Robert Langdon …Robert Langdon publishes Symbol primer for …The list was several pages long, and yet Langdon saw nothing recent—certainlynothing that would explain his current predicament. What happened last night?Langdon pushed on, accessing the Web site for The Florentine, anEnglish-language newspaper published in Florence. He scanned the headlines,breaking-news sections, and police blog, seeing articles on an apartment fire, agovernment embezzling scandal, and assorted incidents of petty crime.Anything at all?!He paused at a breaking-news blurb about a city official who, last night, haddied of a heart attack in the plaza outside the cathedral. The official’s namehad yet to be released, but no foul play was suspected.Finally, not knowing what else to do, Langdon logged on to his Harvard e-mailaccount and checked his messages, wondering if he might find answers there. Allhe found was the usual stream of mail from colleagues, students, and friends,much of it referencing appointments for the coming week.It’s as if nobody knows I’m gone.With rising uncertainty, Langdon shut down the computer and closed the lid. Hewas about to leave when something caught his eye. On the corner of Sienna’sdesk, atop a stack of old medical journals and papers, sat a Polaroidphotograph. The snapshot was of Sienna Brooks and her bearded doctor colleague,laughing together in a hospital hallway.Dr. Marconi, Langdon thought, racked with guilt as he picked up the photo andstudied it.As Langdon replaced the photo on the stack of books, he noticed with surprisethe yellow booklet on top—a tattered playbill from the London Globe Theatre.According to the cover, it was for a production of Shakespeare’s A MidsummerNight’s Dream … staged nearly twenty-five years ago.Scrawled across the top of the playbill was a handwritten message in MagicMarker: Sweetheart, never forget you’re a miracle.Langdon picked up the playbill, and a stack of press clippings fell out onto thedesk. He quickly tried to replace them, but as he opened the booklet to theweathered page where the clippings had been, he stopped short.He was staring at a cast photo of the child actor portraying Shakespeare’smischievous sprite Puck. The photo showed a young girl who could not have beenmore than five, her blond hair in a familiar ponytail.The text below her photo read: A star is born.The bio was a gushing account of a child theater prodigy—Sienna Brooks—with anoff-the-chart IQ, who had, in a single night, memorized every character’s linesand, during initial rehearsals, often cued her fellow cast members. Among thisfive-year-old’s hobbies were violin, chess, biology, and chemistry. The child ofa wealthy couple in the London suburb of Blackheath, the girl was already acelebrity in scientific circles; at the age of four, she had beat a chess grandmaster at his own game and was reading in three languages.My God, Langdon thought. Sienna. That explains a few things.Langdon recalled one of Harvard’s most famous graduates had been a child prodigynamed Saul Kripke, who at the age of six had taught himself Hebrew and read allof the works of Descartes by the age of twelve. More recently, Langdon recalledreading about a young phenom named Moshe Kai Cavalin, who, at age eleven, hadearned a college degree with a 4.0 grade-point average and won a national titlein martial arts, and, at fourteen, published a book titled We Can Do.Langdon picked up another press clipping, a newspaper article with a photo ofSienna at age seven: CHILD GENIUS DISPLAYS 208 IQ.Langdon had been unaware that IQs even went that high. According to the article,Sienna Brooks was a virtuoso violinist, could master a new language in a month,and was teaching herself anatomy and physiology.He looked at another clipping from a medical journal: THE FUTURE OF THOUGHT: NOTALL MINDS ARE CREATED EQUAL.This article had a photo of Sienna, now maybe ten years old, still a towhead,standing beside a large piece of medical apparatus. The article contained aninterview with a doctor, who explained that PET scans of Sienna’s cerebellumrevealed that it was physically different from other cerebella, in her case alarger, more streamlined organ capable of manipulating visual-spatial content inways that most human beings could not begin to fathom. The doctor equatedSienna’s physiological advantage to an unusually accelerated cellular growth inher brain, much like a cancer, except that it accelerated growth of beneficialbrain tissue rather than dangerous cancer cells.Langdon found a clipping from a small-town newspaper.THE CURSE OF BRILLIANCE.There was no photo this time, but the story told of a young genius, SiennaBrooks, who had tried to attend regular schools but was teased by other studentsbecause she didn’t fit in. It talked about the isolation felt by gifted youngpeople whose social skills could not keep up with their intellects and who wereoften ostracized.Sienna, according to this article, had run away from home at the age of eight,and had been smart enough to live on her own undiscovered for ten days. She hadbeen found in an upscale London hotel, where she had pretended to be thedaughter of a guest, stolen a key, and was ordering room service on someoneelse’s account. Apparently she had spent the week reading all 1,600 pages ofGray’s Anatomy. When authorities asked why she was reading medical texts, shetold them she wanted to figure out what was wrong with her brain.Langdon’s heart went out to the little girl. He couldn’t imagine how lonely itmust be for a child to be so profoundly different. He refolded the articles,pausing for one last look at the photo of the five-year-old Sienna in the roleof Puck. Langdon had to admit, considering the surreal quality of his encounterwith Sienna this morning, that her role as the mischievous, dream-inducingsprite seemed strangely apt. Langdon only wished that he, like the characters inthe play, could now simply wake up and pretend that his most recent experienceswere all a dream.Langdon carefully replaced all the clippings on the proper page and closed theplaybill, feeling an unexpected melancholy as he again saw the note on thecover: Sweetheart, never forget you’re a miracle.His eyes moved down to the familiar symbol adorning the cover of the playbill.It was the same early Greek pictogram that adorned most playbills around theworld—a 2,500-year-old symbol that had become synonymous with dramatic theater.Le maschere.image [../Images/00006.jpeg]Langdon looked at the iconic faces of Comedy and Tragedy gazing up at him, andsuddenly he heard a strange humming in his ears—as if a wire were slowly beingpulled taut inside his mind. A stab of pain erupted inside his skull. Visions ofa mask floated before his eyes. Langdon gasped and raised his hands, sittingdown in the desk chair and closing his eyes tightly, clutching at his scalp.In his darkness, the bizarre visions returned with a fury … stark and vivid.The silver-haired woman with the amulet was calling to him again from across abloodred river. Her shouts of desperation pierced the putrid air, clearlyaudible over the sounds of the tortured and dying, who thrashed in agony as faras the eye could see. Langdon again saw the upside-down legs adorned with theletter R, the half-buried body pedaling its legs in wild desperation in the air.Seek and find! the woman called to Langdon. Time is running out!Langdon again felt the overwhelming need to help her … to help everyone.Frantic, he shouted back to her across the bloodred river. Who are you?!Once again, the woman reached up and lifted her veil to reveal the same strikingvisage that Langdon had seen earlier.I am life, she said.Without warning, a colossal image materialized in the sky above her—a fearsomemask with a long, beaklike nose and two fiery green eyes, which stared blanklyout at Langdon.And … I am death, the voice boomed."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8LANGDON’S EYES SHOT open, and he drew a startled breath. He was still seated atSienna’s desk, head in his hands, heart pounding wildly.What the hell is happening to me?The images of the silver-haired woman and the beaked mask lingered in his mind.I am life. I am death. He tried to shake the vision, but it felt searedpermanently into his mind. On the desk before him, the playbill’s two masksstared up at him.Your memories will be muddled and uncataloged, Sienna had told him. Past,present, and imagination all mixed together.Langdon felt dizzy.Somewhere in the apartment, a phone was ringing. It was a piercing,old-fashioned ring, coming from the kitchen.“Sienna?!” Langdon called out, standing up.No response. She had not yet returned. After only two rings, an answeringmachine picked up.“Ciao, sono io,” Sienna’s voice happily declared on her outgoing message.“Lasciatemi un messaggio e vi richiamerò.”There was a beep, and a panicked woman began leaving a message in a thickEastern European accent. Her voice echoed down the hall.“Sienna, eez Danikova! Where you?! Eez terrible! Your friend Dr. Marconi, hedead! Hospital going craaazy! Police come here! People telling them you runningout trying to save patient?! Why!? You don’t know him! Now police want to talkto you! They take employee file! I know information wrong—bad address, nonumbers, fake working visa—so they no find you today, but soon they find! I tryto warn you. So sorry, Sienna.”The call ended.Langdon felt a fresh wave of remorse engulfing him. From the sounds of themessage, Dr. Marconi had been permitting Sienna to work at the hospital. NowLangdon’s presence had cost Marconi his life, and Sienna’s instinct to save astranger had dire implications for her future.Just then a door closed loudly at the far end of the apartment.She’s back.A moment later, the answering machine blared. “Sienna, eez Danikova! Whereyou?!”Langdon winced, knowing what Sienna was about to hear. As the message played,Langdon quickly put away the playbill, neatening the desk. Then he slipped backacross the hall into the bathroom, feeling uncomfortable about his glimpse intoSienna’s past.Ten seconds later, there was a soft knock on the bathroom door.“I’ll leave your clothes on the doorknob,” Sienna said, her voice ragged withemotion.“Thank you so much,” Langdon replied.“When you’re done, please come out to the kitchen,” she added. “There’ssomething important I need to show you before we call anyone.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Sienna walked tiredly down the hall to the apartment’s modest bedroom.Retrieving a pair of blue jeans and a sweater from the dresser, she carried theminto her bathroom.Locking her eyes with her own reflection in the mirror, she reached up, grabbeda clutch of her thick blond ponytail, and pulled down hard, sliding the wig fromher bald scalp.A hairless thirty-two-year-old woman stared back at her from the mirror.Sienna had endured no shortage of challenges in her life, and although she hadtrained herself to rely on intellect to overcome hardship, her currentpredicament had shaken her on a deeply emotional level.She set the wig aside and washed her face and hands. After drying off, shechanged her clothes and put the wig back on, straightening it carefully.Self-pity was an impulse Sienna seldom tolerated, but now, as the tears welledup from deep within, she knew she had no choice but to let them come.And so she did.She cried for the life she could not control.She cried for the mentor who had died before her eyes.She cried for the profound loneliness that filled her heart.But, above all, she cried for the future … which suddenly felt so uncertain."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9BELOWDECKS ON THE luxury vessel The Mendacium, facilitator Laurence Knowlton satin his sealed glass cubicle and stared in disbelief at his computer monitor,having just previewed the video their client had left behind.I’m supposed to upload this to the media tomorrow morning?In his ten years with the Consortium, Knowlton had performed all kinds ofstrange tasks that he knew fell somewhere between dishonest and illegal. Workingwithin a moral gray area was commonplace at the Consortium—an organization whoselone ethical high ground was that they would do whatever it took to keep apromise to a client.We follow through. No questions asked. No matter what.The prospect of uploading this video, however, had left Knowlton unsettled. Inthe past, no matter what bizarre tasks he had performed, he always understoodthe rationale … grasped the motives … comprehended the desired outcome.And yet this video was baffling.Something about it felt different.Much different.Sitting back down at his computer, Knowlton restarted the video file, hoping asecond viewing might shed more light. He turned up the volume and settled in forthe nine-minute show.As before, the video began with the soft lapping of water in the eeriewater-filled cavern where everything was bathed in a numinous red light. Againthe camera plunged down through the surface of the illuminated water to view thesilt-covered floor of the cavern. And again, Knowlton read the text on thesubmerged plaque:IN THIS PLACE, ON THIS DATE,THE WORLD WAS CHANGED FOREVER.That the polished plaque was signed by the Consortium’s client was disquieting.That the date was tomorrow … left Knowlton increasingly concerned. It was whatfollowed, however, that had truly set Knowlton on edge.The camera now panned to the left to reveal a startling object hoveringunderwater just beside the plaque.Here, tethered to the floor by a short filament, was an undulating sphere ofthin plastic. Delicate and wobbling like an oversize soap bubble, thetransparent shape floated like an underwater balloon … inflated not with helium,but with some kind of gelatinous, yellow-brown liquid. The amorphous bag wasdistended and appeared to be about a foot in diameter, and within itstransparent walls, the murky cloud of liquid seemed to swirl slowly, like theeye of a silently growing storm.Jesus, Knowlton thought, feeling clammy. The suspended bag looked even moreominous the second time around.Slowly, the image faded to black.A new image appeared—the cavern’s damp wall, dancing with the ripplingreflections of the illuminated lagoon. On the wall, a shadow appeared … theshadow of a man … standing in the cavern.But the man’s head was misshapen … badly.Instead of a nose, the man had a long beak … as if he were half bird.When he spoke, his voice was muffled … and he spoke with an eerie eloquence … ameasured cadence … as if he were the narrator in some kind of classical chorus.Knowlton sat motionless, barely breathing, as the beaked shadow spoke.I am the Shade.If you are watching this, then it means my soul is finally at rest.Driven underground, I must speak to the world from deep within the earth, exiledto this gloomy cavern where the bloodred waters collect in the lagoon thatreflects no stars.But this is my paradise … the perfect womb for my fragile child.Inferno.Soon you will know what I have left behind.And yet, even here, I sense the footfalls of the ignorant souls who pursue me …willing to stop at nothing to thwart my actions.Forgive them, you might say, for they know not what they do. But there comes amoment in history when ignorance is no longer a forgivable offense … a momentwhen only wisdom has the power to absolve.With purity of conscience, I have bequeathed to you all the gift of Hope, ofsalvation, of tomorrow.And yet still there are those who hunt me like a dog, fueled by theself-righteous belief that I am a madman. There is the silver-haired beauty whodares call me monster! Like the blind clerics who lobbied for the death ofCopernicus, she scorns me as a demon, terrified that I have glimpsed the Truth.But I am not a prophet.I am your salvation.I am the Shade."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10“HAVE A SEAT”, Sienna said. “I have some questions for you.”As Langdon entered the kitchen, he felt much steadier on his feet. He waswearing the neighbor’s Brioni suit, which fit remarkably well. Even the loaferswere comfortable, and Langdon made a mental note to switch to Italian footwearwhen he got home.If I get home, he thought.Sienna was transformed—a natural beauty—having changed into formfitting jeansand a cream-colored sweater, both of which complemented her lithe figure. Herhair was still pulled back in a ponytail, and without the authoritative air ofmedical scrubs, she seemed more vulnerable somehow. Langdon noticed her eyeswere red, as if she had been crying, and an overwhelming guilt again grippedhim.“Sienna, I’m so sorry. I heard the phone message. I don’t know what to say.”“Thanks,” she replied. “But we need to focus on you at the moment. Please sitdown.”Her tone was firmer now, conjuring memories of the articles Langdon had justread about her intellect and precocious childhood.“I need you to think,” Sienna said, motioning for him to sit. “Can you rememberhow we got to this apartment?”Langdon wasn’t sure how it was relevant. “In a taxi,” he said, sitting down atthe table. “Someone was shooting at us.”“Shooting at you, Professor. Let’s be clear on that.”“Yes. Sorry.”“And do you remember any gunshots while you were in the cab?”Odd question. “Yes, two of them. One hit the side mirror, and the other brokethe rear window.”“Good, now close your eyes.”Langdon realized she was testing his memory. He closed his eyes.“What am I wearing?”Langdon could see her perfectly. “Black flats, blue jeans, and a cream V-necksweater. Your hair is blond, shoulder length, pulled back. Your eyes are brown.”Langdon opened his eyes and studied her, pleased to see his eidetic memory wasfunctioning normally.“Good. Your visual cognitive imprinting is excellent, which confirms youramnesia is fully retrograde, and you have no permanent damage to thememory-making process. Have you recalled anything new from the last few days?”“No, unfortunately. I did have another wave of visions while you were gone,though.”Langdon told her about the recurrence of his hallucination of the veiled woman,the throngs of dead people, and the writhing, half-buried legs marked with theletter R. Then he told her about the strange, beaked mask hovering in the sky.“ ‘I am death’?” Sienna asked, looking troubled.“That’s what it said, yes.”“Okay … I guess that beats ‘I am Vishnu, destroyer of worlds.’ ”The young woman had just quoted Robert Oppenheimer at the moment he tested thefirst atomic bomb.“And this beak-nosed … green-eyed mask?” Sienna said, looking puzzled. “Do youhave any idea why your mind might have conjured that image?”“No idea at all, but that style of mask was quite common in the Middle Ages.”Langdon paused. “It’s called a plague mask.”Sienna looked strangely unnerved. “A plague mask?”Langdon quickly explained that in his world of symbols, the unique shape of thelong-beaked mask was nearly synonymous with the Black Death—the deadly plaguethat swept through Europe in the 1300s, killing off a third of the population insome regions. Most believed the “black” in Black Death was a reference to thedarkening of the victims’ flesh through gangrene and subepidermal hemorrhages,but in fact the word black was a reference to the profound emotional dread thatthe pandemic spread through the population.“That long-beaked mask,” Langdon said, “was worn by medieval plague doctors tokeep the pestilence far from their nostrils while treating the infected.Nowadays, you only see them worn as costumes during Venice Carnevale—an eeriereminder of a grim period in Italy’s history.”“And you’re certain you saw one of these masks in your visions?” Sienna asked,her voice now tremulous. “A mask of a medieval plague doctor?”Langdon nodded. A beaked mask is hard to mistake.Sienna was knitting her brow in a way that gave Langdon the sense she was tryingto figure out how best to give him some bad news. “And the woman kept tellingyou to ‘seek and find’?”“Yes. Just as before. But the problem is, I have no idea what I’m supposed toseek.”Sienna let out a long slow breath, her expression grave. “I think I may know.And what’s more … I think you may have already found it.”Langdon stared. “What are you talking about?!”“Robert, last night when you arrived at the hospital, you were carryingsomething unusual in your jacket pocket. Do you recall what it was?”Langdon shook his head.“You were carrying an object … a rather startling object. I found it by chancewhen we were cleaning you up.” She motioned to Langdon’s bloody Harris Tweed,which was laid out flat on the table. “It’s still in the pocket, if you’d liketo have a look.”Uncertain, Langdon eyed his jacket. At least that explains why she went back formy jacket. He grabbed his bloodstained coat and searched all the pockets, one byone. Nothing. He did it again. Finally, he turned to her with a shrug. “There’snothing here.”“How about the secret pocket?”“What? My jacket doesn’t have a secret pocket.”“No?” She looked puzzled. “Then is this jacket … someone else’s?”Langdon’s brain felt muddled again. “No, this is my jacket.”“You’re certain?”Damned certain, he thought. In fact, it used to be my favorite Camberley.He folded back the lining and showed Sienna the label bearing his favoritesymbol in the fashion world—Harris Tweed’s iconic orb adorned with thirteenbuttonlike jewels and topped by a Maltese cross.Leave it to the Scots to invoke the Christian warriors on a piece of twill.“Look at this,” Langdon said, pointing out the hand-embroideredinitials—R.L.—that had been added to the label. He always sprang for HarrisTweed’s hand-tailored models, and for that reason, he always paid extra to havethem sew his initials into the label. On a college campus where hundreds oftweed jackets were constantly doffed and donned in dining halls and classrooms,Langdon had no intention of getting the short end of an inadvertent trade.“I believe you,” she said, taking the jacket from him. “Now you look.”Sienna opened the jacket farther to reveal the lining near the nape of the back.Here, discreetly hidden in the lining, was a large, neatly fashioned pocket.What the hell?!Langdon was certain he had never seen this before.The pocket consisted of a hidden seam, perfectly tailored.“That wasn’t there before!” Langdon insisted.“Then I’m imagining you’ve never seen … this?” Sienna reached into the pocketand extracted a sleek metal object, which she set gently in Langdon’s hands.Langdon stared down at the object in utter bewilderment.“Do you know what this is?” Sienna asked.“No …” he stammered. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”“Well, unfortunately, I do know what this is. And I’m fairly certain it’s thereason someone is trying to kill you.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Now pacing his private cubicle aboard The Mendacium, facilitator Knowlton feltan increasing disquiet as he considered the video he was supposed to share withthe world tomorrow morning.I am the Shade?Rumors had circulated that this particular client had suffered a psychotic breakover the last few months, but this video seemed to confirm those rumors beyondany doubt.Knowlton knew he had two choices. He could either prepare the video for deliverytomorrow as promised, or he could take it upstairs to the provost for a secondopinion.I already know his opinion, Knowlton thought, having never witnessed the provosttake any action other than the one promised a client. He’ll tell me to uploadthis video to the world, no questions asked … and he’ll be furious at me forasking.Knowlton returned his attention to the video, which he rewound to a particularlyunsettling spot. He started the playback, and the eerily illuminated cavernreappeared accompanied by the sounds of lapping water. The humanoid shadowloomed on the dripping wall—a tall man with a long, birdlike beak.In a muffled voice, the deformed shadow spoke:These are the new Dark Ages.Centuries ago, Europe was in the depths of its own misery—the populationhuddled, starving, mired in sin and hopelessness. They were as a congestedforest, suffocated by deadwood, awaiting God’s lightning strike—the spark thatwould finally ignite the fire that would rage across the land and clear thedeadwood, once again bringing sunshine to the healthy roots.Culling is God’s Natural Order.Ask yourself, What followed the Black Death?We all know the answer.The Renaissance.Rebirth.It has always been this way. Death is followed by birth.To reach Paradise, man must pass through Inferno.This, the master taught us.And yet the silver-haired ignorant dares call me monster? Does she still notgrasp the mathematics of the future? The horrors it will bring?I am the Shade.I am your salvation.And so I stand, deep within this cavern, gazing out across the lagoon thatreflects no stars. Here in this sunken palace, Inferno smolders beneath thewaters.Soon it will burst into flames.And when it does, nothing on earth will be able to stop it."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11THE OBJECT IN Langdon’s hand felt surprisingly heavy for its size. Slender andsmooth, the polished metal cylinder was about six inches long and rounded atboth ends, like a miniature torpedo.“Before you handle that too roughly,” Sienna offered, “you may want to look atthe other side.” She gave him a taut smile. “You say you’re a professor ofsymbols?”Langdon refocused on the tube, turning it in his hands until a bright red symbolrolled into view, emblazoned on its side.Instantly, his body tensed.As a student of iconography, Langdon knew that precious few images had the powerto instill instantaneous fear in the human mind … but the symbol before himdefinitely made the list. His reaction was visceral and immediate; he placed thetube on the table and slid back his chair.Sienna nodded. “Yeah, that was my reaction, too.”The marking on the tube was a simple trilateral icon.image [../Images/00007.jpeg]This notorious symbol, Langdon had once read, was developed by Dow Chemical inthe 1960s to replace an array of impotent warning graphics previously in use.Like all successful symbols, this one was simple, distinctive, and easy toreproduce. Cleverly conjuring associations with everything from crab pincers toninja hurling knives, the modern “biohazard” symbol had become a global brandthat conveyed danger in every language.“This little canister is a biotube,” Sienna said. “Used for transportingdangerous substances. We see these occasionally in the medical field. Inside isa foam sleeve into which you can insert a specimen tube for safe transport. Inthis case …” She pointed to the biohazard symbol. “I’m guessing a deadlychemical agent … or maybe a … virus?” She paused. “The first Ebola samples werebrought back from Africa in a tube similar to this one.”This was not at all what Langdon wanted to hear. “What the hell is it doing inmy jacket! I’m an art history professor; why am I carrying this thing?!”Violent images of writhing bodies flashed through his mind … and hovering overthem, the plague mask.Very sorry … Very sorry.“Wherever this came from,” Sienna said, “this is a very high-end unit.Lead-lined titanium. Virtually impenetrable, even to radiation. I’m guessinggovernment issue.” She pointed to a postage-stamp-size black pad flanking thebiohazard symbol. “Thumbprint recognition. Security in case it’s lost or stolen.Tubes like this can be opened only by a specified individual.”Although Langdon sensed his mind now working at normal speed, he still felt asif he were struggling to catch up. I’ve been carrying a biometrically sealedcanister.“When I discovered this canister in your jacket, I wanted to show Dr. Marconiprivately, but I didn’t have an opportunity before you woke up. I consideredtrying your thumb on the pad while you were unconscious, but I had no idea whatwas in the tube, and—”“MY thumb?!” Langdon shook his head. “There’s no way this thing is programmedfor me to open it. I don’t know anything about biochemistry. I’d never haveanything like this.”“Are you sure?”Langdon was damned sure. He reached out and placed his thumb on the finger pad.Nothing happened. “See?! I told—”The titanium tube clicked loudly, and Langdon yanked his hand back as if it hadbeen burned. Holy shit. He stared at the canister as if it were about to unscrewitself and start emitting a deadly gas. After three seconds, it clicked again,apparently relocking itself.Speechless, Langdon turned to Sienna.The young doctor exhaled, looking unnerved. “Well, it seems pretty clear thatthe intended carrier is you.”For Langdon, the entire scenario felt incongruous. “That’s impossible. First ofall, how would I get this chunk of metal through airport security?”“Maybe you flew in on a private jet? Or maybe it was given to you when youarrived in Italy?”“Sienna, I need to call the consulate. Right away.”“You don’t think we should open it first?”Langdon had taken some ill-advised actions in his life, but opening a hazardousmaterials container in this woman’s kitchen would not be one of them. “I’mhanding this thing over to the authorities. Now.”Sienna pursed her lips, mulling over options. “Okay, but as soon as you makethat call, you’re on your own. I can’t be involved. You definitely can’t meetthem here. My immigration situation in Italy is … complicated.”Langdon looked Sienna in the eye. “All I know, Sienna, is that you saved mylife. I’ll handle this situation however you want me to handle it.”She gave a grateful nod and walked over to the window, gazing down at the streetbelow. “Okay, this is how we should do it.”Sienna quickly outlined a plan. It was simple, clever, and safe.Langdon waited as she turned on her cell phone’s caller-ID blocking and dialed.Her fingers were delicate and yet moved purposefully.“Informazioni abbonati?” Sienna said, speaking in a flawless Italian accent.“Per favore, può darmi il numero del Consolato americano di Firenze?”She waited and then quickly wrote down a phone number.“Grazie mille,” she said, and hung up.Sienna slid the phone number over to Langdon along with her cell phone. “You’reon. Do you remember what to say?”“My memory is fine,” he said with a smile as he dialed the number on the slip ofpaper. The line began to ring.Here goes nothing.He switched the call to speaker and set the phone on the table so Sienna couldhear. A recorded message answered, offering general information about consulateservices and hours of operation, which did not begin until 8:30 A.M.Langdon checked the clock on the cell. It was only 6 A.M.“If this is an emergency,” the automated recording said, “you may dialseven-seven to speak to the night duty officer.”Langdon immediately dialed the extension.The line was ringing again.“Consolato americano,” a tired voice answered. “Sono il funzionario di turno.”“Lei parla inglese?” Langdon asked.“Of course,” the man said in American English. He sounded vaguely annoyed tohave been awoken. “How can I help you?”“I’m an American visiting Florence and I was attacked. My name is RobertLangdon.”“Passport number, please.” The man yawned audibly.“My passport is missing. I think it was stolen. I was shot in the head. I’vebeen in the hospital. I need help.”The attendant suddenly woke up. “Sir!? Did you say you were shot? What was yourfull name again, please?”“Robert Langdon.”There was a rustling on the line and then Langdon could hear the man’s fingerstyping on a keyboard. The computer pinged. A pause. Then more fingers on thekeyboard. Another ping. Then three high-pitched pings.A longer pause.“Sir?” the man said. “Your name is Robert Langdon?”“Yes, that’s right. And I’m in trouble.”“Okay, sir, your name has an action flag on it, which is directing me totransfer you immediately to the consul general’s chief administrator.” The manpaused, as if he himself couldn’t believe it. “Just hold the line.”“Wait! Can you tell me—”The line was already ringing.It rang four times and connected.“This is Collins,” a hoarse voice answered.Langdon took a deep breath and spoke as calmly and clearly as possible. “Mr.Collins, my name is Robert Langdon. I’m an American visiting Florence. I’ve beenshot. I need help. I want to come to the U.S. Consulate immediately. Can youhelp me?”Without hesitation, the deep voice replied, “Thank heavens you’re alive, Mr.Langdon. We’ve been looking for you.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12THE CONSULATE KNOWS I’m here?For Langdon, the news brought an instantaneous flood of relief. Mr. Collins—whohad introduced himself as the consul general’s chief administrator—spoke with afirm, professional cadence, and yet there was urgency in his voice. “Mr.Langdon, you and I need to speak immediately. And obviously not on the phone.”Nothing was obvious to Langdon at this point, but he wasn’t about to interrupt.“I’ll have someone pick you up right away,” Collins said. “What is yourlocation?”Sienna shifted nervously, listening to the interchange on speakerphone. Langdongave her a reassuring nod, fully intending to follow her plan exactly.“I’m in a small hotel called Pensione la Fiorentina,” Langdon said, glancingacross the street at the drab hotel that Sienna had pointed out moments ago. Hegave Collins the street address.“Got it,” the man replied. “Don’t move. Stay in your room. Someone will be thereright away. Room number?”Langdon made one up. “Thirty-nine.”“Okay. Twenty minutes.” Collins lowered his voice. “And, Mr. Langdon, it soundslike you may be injured and confused, but I need to know … are you still inpossession?”In possession. Langdon sensed the question, while cryptic, could have only onemeaning. His eyes moved to the biotube on the kitchen table. “Yes, sir. I’mstill in possession.”Collins exhaled audibly. “When we didn’t hear from you, we assumed … well,frankly, we assumed the worst. I’m relieved. Stay where you are. Don’t move.Twenty minutes. Someone will knock on your door.”Collins hung up.Langdon could feel his shoulders relaxing for the first time since he’d woken upin the hospital. The consulate knows what’s going on, and soon I’ll haveanswers. Langdon closed his eyes and let out a slow breath, feeling almost humannow. His headache had all but passed.“Well, that was all very MI6,” Sienna said in a half-joking tone. “Are you aspy?”At the moment Langdon had no idea what he was. The notion that he could lose twodays of memory and find himself in an unrecognizable situation feltincomprehensible, and yet here he was … twenty minutes away from a rendezvouswith a U.S. Consulate official in a run-down hotel.What’s happening here?He glanced over at Sienna, realizing they were about to part ways and yetfeeling as if they had unfinished business. He pictured the bearded doctor atthe hospital, dying on the floor before her eyes. “Sienna,” he whispered, “yourfriend … Dr. Marconi … I feel terrible.”She nodded blankly.“And I’m sorry to have dragged you into this. I know your situation at thehospital is unusual, and if there’s an investigation …” He trailed off.“It’s okay,” she said. “I’m no stranger to moving around.”Langdon sensed in Sienna’s distant eyes that everything had changed for her thismorning. Langdon’s own life was in chaos at the moment, and yet he felt hisheart going out to this woman.She saved my life … and I’ve ruined hers.They sat in silence for a full minute, the air between them growing heavy, as ifthey both wanted to speak, and yet had nothing to say. They were strangers,after all, on a brief and bizarre journey that had just reached a fork in theroad, each of them now needing to find separate paths.“Sienna,” Langdon finally said, “when I sort this out with the consulate, ifthere’s anything I can do to help you … please.”“Thanks,” she whispered, and turned her eyes sadly toward the window.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]As the minutes ticked past, Sienna Brooks gazed absently out the kitchen windowand wondered where the day would lead her. Wherever it was, she had no doubtthat by day’s end, her world would look a lot different.She knew it was probably just the adrenaline, but she found herself strangelyattracted to the American professor. In addition to his being handsome, heseemed to possess a sincerely good heart. In some distant, alternate life,Robert Langdon might even be someone she could be with.He would never want me, she thought. I’m damaged.As she choked back the emotion, something outside the window caught her eye. Shebolted upright, pressing her face to the glass and staring down into the street.“Robert, look!”Langdon peered down into the street at the sleek black BMW motorcycle that hadjust rumbled to a stop in front of Pensione la Fiorentina. The driver was leanand strong, wearing a black leather suit and helmet. As the driver gracefullyswung off the bike and removed a polished black helmet, Sienna could hearLangdon stop breathing.The woman’s spiked hair was unmistakable.She produced a familiar handgun, checked the silencer, and slid it back insideher jacket pocket. Then, moving with lethal grace, she slipped inside the hotel.“Robert,” Sienna whispered, her voice taut with fear. “The U.S. government justsent someone to kill you.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13ROBERT LANGDON FELT a swell of panic as he stood at the apartment window, eyesriveted on the hotel across the street. The spike-haired woman had just entered,but Langdon could not fathom how she had gotten the address.Adrenaline coursed through his system, disjointing his thought process onceagain. “My own government sent someone to kill me?”Sienna looked equally astounded. “Robert, that means the original attempt onyour life at the hospital also was sanctioned by your government.” She got upand double-checked the lock on the apartment door. “If the U.S. Consulate haspermission to kill you …” She didn’t finish the thought, but she didn’t have to.The implications were terrifying.What the hell do they think I did? Why is my own government hunting me?!Once again, Langdon heard the two words he had apparently been mumbling when hestaggered into the hospital.Very sorry … very sorry.“You’re not safe here,” Sienna said. “We’re not safe here.” She motioned acrossthe street. “That woman saw us flee the hospital together, and I’m betting yourgovernment and the police are already trying to track me down. My apartment is asublet in someone else’s name, but they’ll find me eventually.” She turned herattention to the biotube on the table. “You need to open that, right now.”Langdon eyed the titanium device, seeing only the biohazard symbol.“Whatever’s inside that tube,” Sienna said, “probably has an ID code, an agencysticker, a phone number, something. You need information. I need information!Your government killed my friend!”The pain in Sienna’s voice shook Langdon from his thoughts, and he nodded,knowing she was correct. “Yes, I’m … very sorry.” Langdon cringed, hearing thosewords again. He turned to the canister on the table, wondering what answersmight be hidden inside. “It could be incredibly dangerous to open this.”Sienna thought for a moment. “Whatever’s inside will be exceptionally wellcontained, probably in a shatterproof Plexiglas test tube. This biotube is justan outer shell to provide additional security during transport.”Langdon looked out the window at the black motorcycle parked in front of thehotel. The woman had not yet come out, but she would soon figure out thatLangdon was not there. He wondered what her next move would be … and how long itwould take before she was pounding on the apartment door.Langdon made up his mind. He lifted the titanium tube and reluctantly placed histhumb on the biometric pad. After a moment the canister pinged and then clickedloudly.Before the tube could lock itself again, Langdon twisted the two halves againsteach other in opposite directions. After a quarter turn, the canister pinged asecond time, and Langdon knew he was committed.Langdon’s hands felt sweaty as he continued unscrewing the tube. The two halvesturned smoothly on perfectly machined threads. He kept twisting, feeling as ifhe were about to open a precious Russian nesting doll, except that he had noidea what might fall out.After five turns, the two halves released. With a deep breath, Langdon gentlypulled them apart. The gap between the halves widened, and a foam-rubberinterior slid out. Langdon laid it on the table. The protective padding vaguelyresembled an elongated Nerf football.Here goes nothing.Langdon gently folded back the top of the protective foam, finally revealing theobject nestled inside.Sienna stared down at the contents and cocked her head, looking puzzled.“Definitely not what I expected.”Langdon had anticipated some kind of futuristic-looking vial, but the content ofthe biotube was anything but modern. The ornately carved object appeared to bemade of ivory and was approximately the size of a roll of Life Savers.“It looks old,” Sienna whispered. “Some kind of …”“Cylinder seal,” Langdon told her, finally permitting himself to exhale.Invented by the Sumerians in 3500 B.C., cylinder seals were the precursors tothe intaglio form of printmaking. Carved with decorative images, a sealcontained a hollow shaft, through which an axle pin was inserted so the carveddrum could be rolled like a modern paint roller across wet clay or terra-cottato “imprint” a recurring band of symbols, images, or text.This particular seal, Langdon guessed, was undoubtedly quite rare and valuable,and yet he still couldn’t imagine why it would be locked in a titanium canisterlike some kind of bioweapon.As Langdon delicately turned the seal in his fingers, he realized that this onebore an especially gruesome carving—a three-headed, horned Satan who was in theprocess of eating three different men at once, one man in each of his threemouths.Pleasant.Langdon’s eyes moved to seven letters carved beneath the devil. The ornatecalligraphy was written in mirror image, as was all text on imprinting rollers,but Langdon had no trouble reading the letters—SALIGIA.Sienna squinted at the text, reading it aloud. “Saligia?”Langdon nodded, feeling a chill to hear the word spoken aloud. “It’s a Latinmnemonic invented by the Vatican in the Middle Ages to remind Christians of theSeven Deadly Sins. Saligia is an acronym for: superbia, avaritia, luxuria,invidia, gula, ira, and acedia.”Sienna frowned. “Pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth.”Langdon was impressed. “You know Latin.”“I grew up Catholic. I know sin.”Langdon managed a smile as he returned his gaze to the seal, wondering again whyit had been locked in a biotube as if it were dangerous.“I thought it was ivory,” Sienna said. “But it’s bone.” She slid the artifactinto the sunlight and pointed to the lines on it. “Ivory forms in adiamond-shaped cross-hatching with translucent striations; bones form with theseparallel striations and darkened pitting.”Langdon gently picked up the seal and examined the carvings more closely. Theoriginal Sumerian seals had been carved with rudimentary figures and cuneiform.This seal, however, was much more elaborately carved. Medieval, Langdon guessed.Furthermore, the embellishments suggested an unsettling connection with hishallucinations.Sienna eyed him with concern. “What is it?”“Recurring theme,” Langdon said grimly, and motioned to one of the carvings onthe seal. “See this three-headed, man-eating Satan? It’s a common image from theMiddle Ages—an icon associated with the Black Death. The three gnashing mouthsare symbolic of how efficiently the plague ate through the population.”Sienna glanced uneasily at the biohazard symbol on the tube.Allusions to the plague seemed to be occurring with more frequency this morningthan Langdon cared to admit, and so it was with reluctance that he acknowledgeda further connection. “Saligia is representative of the collective sins ofmankind … which, according to medieval religious indoctrination—”“Was the reason God punished the world with the Black Death,” Sienna said,completing his thought.“Yes.” Langdon paused, momentarily losing his train of thought. He had justnoticed something about the cylinder that struck him as odd. Normally, a personcould peer through a cylinder seal’s hollow center, as if through a section ofempty pipe, but in this case, the shaft was blocked. There’s something insertedinside this bone. The end caught the light and shimmered.“There’s something inside,” Langdon said. “And it looks like it’s made ofglass.” He flipped the cylinder upside down to check the other end, and as hedid so, a tiny object rattled inside, tumbling from one end of the bone to theother, like a ball bearing in a tube.Langdon froze, and he heard Sienna let out a soft gasp beside him.What the hell was that?!“Did you hear that sound?” Sienna whispered.Langdon nodded and carefully peered into the end of the canister. “The openingappears to be blocked by … something made of metal.” The cap of a test tube,maybe?Sienna backed away. “Does it look … broken?”“I don’t think so.” He carefully tipped the bone again to reexamine the glassend, and the rattling sound recurred. An instant later, the glass in thecylinder did something wholly unexpected.It began to glow.Sienna’s eyes opened wide. “Robert, stop! Don’t move!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14LANGDON STOOD ABSOLUTELY still, his hand in midair, holding the bone cylindersteady. Without a doubt, the glass at the end of the tube was emitting light …glowing as if the contents had suddenly awoken.Quickly, the light inside faded back to black.Sienna moved closer, breathing quickly. She tilted her head and studied thevisible section of glass inside the bone.“Tip it again,” she whispered. “Very slowly.”Langdon gently turned the bone upside down. Again, a small object rattled thelength of the bone and stopped.“Once more,” she said. “Gently.”Langdon repeated the process, and again the tube rattled. This time, theinterior glass shimmered faintly, glowing again for an instant before it fadedaway.“It’s got to be a test tube,” Sienna declared, “with an agitator ball.”Langdon was familiar with the agitator balls used in spray-paint cans—submergedpellets that helped stir the paint when the can was shaken.“It probably contains some kind of phosphorescent chemical compound,” Siennasaid, “or a bioluminescent organism that glows when it’s stimulated.”Langdon was having other ideas. While he had seen chemical glow sticks and evenbioluminescent plankton that glowed when a boat churned up its habitat, he wasnearly certain the cylinder in his hand contained neither of these things. Hegently tipped the tube several more times, until it glowed, and then held theluminescent end over his palm. As expected, a faint reddish light appeared,projected onto his skin.Nice to know a 208 IQ can be wrong sometimes.“Watch this,” Langdon said, and began shaking the tube violently. The objectinside rattled back and forth, faster and faster.Sienna jumped back. “What are you doing!?”Still shaking the tube, Langdon walked over to the light switch and flipped itoff, plunging the kitchen into relative darkness. “It’s not a test tube inside,”he said, still shaking as hard as he could. “It’s a Faraday pointer.”Langdon had once been given a similar device by one of his students—a laserpointer for lecturers who disliked wasting endless AAA batteries and didn’t mindthe effort of shaking their pointer for a few seconds in order to transformtheir own kinetic energy into electricity on demand. When the device wasagitated, a metal ball inside sailed back and forth across a series of paddlesand powered a tiny generator. Apparently someone had decided to slide thisparticular pointer into a hollow, carved bone—an ancient skin to sheathe amodern electronic toy.The tip of the pointer in his hand was now glowing intensely, and Langdon gaveSienna an uneasy grin. “Showtime.”He aimed the bone-sheathed pointer at a bare space on the kitchen wall. When thewall lit up, Sienna drew a startled breath. It was Langdon, however, whophysically recoiled in surprise.The light that appeared on the wall was not a little red laser dot. It was avivid, high-definition photograph that emanated from the tube as if from anold-fashioned slide projector.My God! Langdon’s hand trembled slightly as he absorbed the macabre sceneprojected on the wall before him. No wonder I’ve been seeing images of death.At his side, Sienna covered her mouth and took a tentative step forward, clearlyentranced by what she was seeing.The scene projected out of the carved bone was a grim oil painting of humansuffering—thousands of souls undergoing wretched tortures in various levels ofhell. The underworld was portrayed as a cutaway cross section of the earth intowhich plunged a cavernous funnel-shaped pit of unfathomable depth. This pit ofhell was divided into descending terraces of increasing misery, each levelpopulated by tormented sinners of every kind.Langdon recognized the image at once.The masterpiece before him—La Mappa dell’Inferno—had been painted by one of thetrue giants of the Italian Renaissance, Sandro Botticelli. An elaborateblueprint of the underworld, The Map of Hell was one of the most frighteningvisions of the afterlife ever created. Dark, grim, and terrifying, the paintingstopped people in their tracks even today. Unlike his vibrant and colorfulPrimavera or Birth of Venus, Botticelli had crafted his Map of Hell with adepressing palate of reds, sepias, and browns.Langdon’s crashing headache had suddenly returned, and yet for the first timesince waking up in a strange hospital, he felt a piece of the puzzle tumble intoplace. His grim hallucinations obviously had been stirred by seeing this famouspainting.I must have been studying Botticelli’s Map of Hell, he thought, although he hadno recollection of why.While the image itself was disturbing, it was the painting’s provenance that wasnow causing Langdon an increasing disquiet. Langdon was well aware that theinspiration for this foreboding masterpiece had originated not in the mind ofBotticelli himself … but rather in the mind of someone who had lived two hundredyears before him.One great work of art inspired by another.Botticelli’s Map of Hell was in fact a tribute to a fourteenth-century work ofliterature that had become one of history’s most celebrated writings … anotoriously macabre vision of hell that resonated to this day.Dante’s Inferno.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Across the street, Vayentha quietly climbed a service staircase and concealedherself on the rooftop terrace of the sleepy little Pensione la Fiorentina.Langdon had provided a nonexistent room number and a fake meeting place to hisconsulate contact—a “mirrored meet,” as it was called in her business—a commontradecraft technique that would enable him to assess the situation beforerevealing his own location. Invariably, the fake or “mirrored” location wasselected because it lay in perfect view of his actual location.Vayentha found a concealed vantage point on the rooftop from which she had abird’s-eye view of the entire area. Slowly, she let her eyes climb the apartmentbuilding across the street.Your move, Mr. Langdon.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]At that moment, on board The Mendacium, the provost stepped out onto themahogany deck and inhaled deeply, savoring the salty air of the Adriatic. Thisvessel had been his home for years, and yet now, the series of eventstranspiring in Florence threatened to destroy everything he had built.His field agent Vayentha had put everything at risk, and while she would face aninquiry when this mission was over, right now the provost still needed her.She damned well better regain control of this mess.Brisk footsteps approached behind him, and the provost turned to see one of hisfemale analysts arriving at a jog.“Sir?” the analyst said, breathless. “We have new information.” Her voice cutthe morning air with a rare intensity. “It appears Robert Langdon just accessedhis Harvard e-mail account from an unmasked IP address.” She paused, lockingeyes with the provost. “Langdon’s precise location is now traceable.”The provost was stunned that anyone could be so foolish. This changeseverything. He steepled his hands and stared out at the coastline, consideringthe implications. “Do we know the status of the SRS team?”“Yes, sir. Less than two miles away from Langdon’s position.”The provost needed only a moment to make the decision."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15“L’INFERNO DI DANTE”, Sienna whispered, her expression rapt as she inched closerto the stark image of the underworld now projected on her kitchen wall.Dante’s vision of hell, Langdon thought, rendered here in living color.Exalted as one of the preeminent works of world literature, the Inferno was thefirst of three books that made up Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy—a 14,233-lineepic poem describing Dante’s brutal descent into the underworld, journey throughpurgatory, and eventual arrival in paradise. Of the Comedy’s threesections—Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso—Inferno was by far the most widelyread and memorable.Composed by Dante Alighieri in the early 1300s, Inferno had quite literallyredefined medieval perceptions of damnation. Never before had the concept ofhell captivated the masses in such an entertaining way. Overnight, Dante’s worksolidified the abstract concept of hell into a clear and terrifyingvision—visceral, palpable, and unforgettable. Not surprisingly, following thepoem’s release, the Catholic Church enjoyed an enormous uptick in attendancefrom terrified sinners looking to avoid Dante’s updated version of theunderworld.Depicted here by Botticelli, Dante’s horrific vision of hell was constructed asa subterranean funnel of suffering—a wretched underground landscape of fire,brimstone, sewage, monsters, and Satan himself waiting at its core. The pit wasconstructed in nine distinct levels, the Nine Rings of Hell, into which sinnerswere cast in accordance with the depth of their sin. Near the top, the lustfulor “carnal malefactors” were blown about by an eternal windstorm, a symbol oftheir inability to control their desire. Beneath them the gluttons were forcedto lie facedown in a vile slush of sewage, their mouths filled with the productof their excess. Deeper still, the heretics were trapped in flaming coffins,damned to eternal fire. And so it went … getting worse and worse the deeper onedescended.In the seven centuries since its publication, Dante’s enduring vision of hellhad inspired tributes, translations, and variations by some of history’sgreatest creative minds. Longfellow, Chaucer, Marx, Milton, Balzac, Borges, andeven several popes had all written pieces based on Dante’s Inferno. Monteverdi,Liszt, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, and Puccini composed pieces based on Dante’s work,as had one of Langdon’s favorite living recording artists—Loreena McKennitt.Even the modern world of video games and iPad apps had no shortage ofDante-related offerings.Langdon, eager to share with his students the vibrant symbolic richness ofDante’s vision, sometimes taught a course on the recurring imagery found in bothDante and the works he had inspired over the centuries.“Robert,” Sienna said, shifting closer to the image on the wall. “Look at that!”She pointed to an area near the bottom of the funnel-shaped hell.The area she was pointing to was known as the Malebolge—meaning “evil ditches.”It was the eighth and penultimate ring of hell and was divided into ten separateditches, each for a specific type of fraud.Sienna pointed more excitedly now. “Look! Didn’t you say, in your vision, yousaw this?!”Langdon squinted at where Sienna was pointing, but he saw nothing. The tinyprojector was losing power, and the image had begun to fade. He quickly shookthe device again until it was glowing brightly. Then he carefully set it fartherback from the wall, on the edge of the counter across the small kitchen, lettingit cast an even larger image from there. Langdon approached Sienna, stepping tothe side to study the glowing map.Again Sienna pointed down toward the eighth ring of hell. “Look. Didn’t you sayyour hallucinations included a pair of legs sticking out of the earth upsidedown with the letter R?” She touched a precise spot on the wall. “There theyare!”As Langdon had seen many times in this painting, the tenth ditch of theMalebolge was packed with sinners half buried upside down, their legs stickingout of the earth. But strangely, in this version, one pair of legs bore theletter R, written in mud, exactly as Langdon had seen in his vision.My God! Langdon peered more intently at the tiny detail. “That letter R … thatis definitely not in Botticelli’s original!”“There’s another letter,” Sienna said, pointing.Langdon followed her outstretched finger to another of the ten ditches in theMalebolge, where the letter E was scrawled on a false prophet whose head hadbeen put on backward.What in the world? This painting has been modified.Other letters now appeared to him, scrawled on sinners throughout all tenditches of the Malebolge. He saw a C on a seducer being whipped by demons …another R on a thief perpetually bitten by snakes … an A on a corrupt politiciansubmerged in a boiling lake of tar.“These letters,” Langdon said with certainty, “are definitely not part ofBotticelli’s original. This image has been digitally edited.”He returned his gaze to the uppermost ditch of the Malebolge and began readingthe letters downward, through each of the ten ditches, from top to bottom.C … A … T … R … O … V … A … C … E … R“Catrovacer?” Langdon said. “Is this Italian?”Sienna shook her head. “Not Latin either. I don’t recognize it.”“A … signature, maybe?”“Catrovacer?” She looked doubtful. “Doesn’t sound like a name to me. But lookover there.” She pointed to one of the many characters in the third ditch of theMalebolge.When Langdon’s eyes found the figure, he instantly felt a chill. Among the crowdof sinners in the third ditch was an iconic image from the Middle Ages—a cloakedman in a mask with a long, birdlike beak and dead eyes.The plague mask.“Is there a plague doctor in Botticelli’s original?” Sienna asked.“Absolutely not. That figure has been added.”“And did Botticelli sign his original?”Langdon couldn’t recall, but as his eyes moved to the lower right-hand cornerwhere a signature normally would be, he realized why she had asked. There was nosignature, and yet barely visible along La Mappa’s dark brown border was a lineof text in tiny block letters: la verità è visibile solo attraverso gli occhidella morte.Langdon knew enough Italian to understand the gist. “ ‘The truth can be glimpsedonly through the eyes of death.’ ”Sienna nodded. “Bizarre.”The two of them stood in silence as the morbid image before them slowly began tofade. Dante’s Inferno, Langdon thought. Inspiring foreboding pieces of art since1330.Langdon’s course on Dante always included an entire section on the illustriousartwork inspired by the Inferno. In addition to Botticelli’s celebrated Map ofHell, there was Rodin’s timeless sculpture of The Three Shades from The Gates ofHell … Stradanus’s illustration of Phlegyas paddling through submerged bodies onthe river Styx … William Blake’s lustful sinners swirling through an eternaltempest … Bouguereau’s strangely erotic vision of Dante and Virgil watching twonude men locked in battle … Bayros’s tortured souls huddling beneath a hail-liketorrent of scalding pellets and droplets of fire … Salvador Dalí’s eccentricseries of watercolors and woodcuts … and Doré’s huge collection ofblack-and-white etchings depicting everything from the tunneled entrance toHades … to winged Satan himself.Now it seemed that Dante’s poetic vision of hell had not only influenced themost revered artists throughout history. It had also, apparently, inspired yetanother individual—a twisted soul who had digitally altered Botticelli’s famouspainting, adding ten letters, a plague doctor, and then signing it with anominous phrase about seeing the truth through the eyes of death. This artist hadthen stored the image on a high-tech projector sheathed in a freakishly carvedbone.Langdon couldn’t imagine who would have created such an artifact, and yet, atthe moment, this issue seemed secondary to a far more unnerving question.Why the hell am I carrying it?image [../Images/00005.jpeg]As Sienna stood with Langdon in the kitchen and pondered her next move, theunexpected roar of a high-horsepower engine echoed up from the street below. Itwas followed by a staccato burst of screeching tires and car doors slamming.Puzzled, Sienna hurried to the window and peered outside.A black, unmarked van had skidded to a stop in the street below. Out of the vanflowed a team of men, all dressed in black uniforms with circular greenmedallions on their left shoulders. They gripped automatic rifles and moved withfierce, military efficiency. Without hesitation, four soldiers dashed toward theentrance of the apartment building.Sienna felt her blood go cold. “Robert!” she shouted. “I don’t know who theyare, but they found us!”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Down in the street, Agent Christoph Brüder shouted orders to his men as theyrushed into the building. He was a powerfully built man whose militarybackground had imbued him with an emotionless sense of duty and respect for thecommand chain. He knew his mission, and he knew the stakes.The organization for whom he worked contained many divisions, but Brüder’sdivision—Surveillance and Response Support—was summoned only when a situationreached “crisis” status.As his men disappeared into the apartment building, Brüder stood watch at thefront door, pulling out his comm device and contacting the person in charge.“It’s Brüder,” he said. “We’ve successfully tracked Langdon through his computerIP address. My team is moving in. I’ll alert you when we have him.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]High above Brüder, on the rooftop terrace of Pensione la Fiorentina, Vayenthastared down in horrified disbelief at the agents dashing into the apartmentbuilding.What the hell are THEY doing here?!She ran a hand through her spiked hair, suddenly grasping the dire consequencesof her botched assignment last night. With the single coo of a dove, everythinghad spiraled wildly out of control. What had begun as a simple mission … had nowturned into a living nightmare.If the SRS team is here, then it’s all over for me.Vayentha desperately grabbed her Sectra Tiger XS communications device andcalled the provost.“Sir,” she stammered. “The SRS team is here! Brüder’s men are swarming theapartment building across the street!”She awaited a response, but when it came, she heard only sharp clicks on theline, then an electronic voice, which calmly stated, “Disavowal protocolcommencing.”Vayentha lowered the phone and looked at the screen just in time to see the commdevice go dead.As the blood drained from her face, Vayentha forced herself to accept what washappening. The Consortium had just severed all ties with her.No links. No association.I’ve been disavowed.The shock lasted only an instant.Then the fear set in."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16“HURRY, ROBERT!” SIENNA urged. “Follow me!”Langdon’s thoughts were still consumed by grim images of Dante’s underworld ashe charged out the door into the hall of the apartment building. Until thisinstant, Sienna Brooks had managed the morning’s substantial stress with a kindof detached poise, but now her calm demeanor had grown taut with an emotionLangdon had yet to see in her—true fear.In the hallway, Sienna ran ahead, rushing past the elevator, which was alreadydescending, no doubt summoned by the men now entering the lobby. She sprinted tothe end of the hall and, without looking back, disappeared into the stairwell.Langdon followed close behind, skidding on the smooth soles of his borrowedloafers. The tiny projector in the breast pocket of his Brioni suit bouncedagainst his chest as he ran. His mind flashed on the strange letters adorningthe eighth ring of hell: CATROVACER. He pictured the plague mask and the strangesignature: The truth can be glimpsed only through the eyes of death.Langdon strained to connect these disparate elements, but at the moment nothingwas making sense. When he finally came to a stop on the staircase landing,Sienna was there, listening intently. Langdon could hear footsteps pounding upthe stairs from below.“Is there another exit?” Langdon whispered.“Follow me,” she said tersely.Sienna had kept Langdon alive once already today, and so, with little choice butto trust the woman, Langdon took a deep breath and bounded down the stairs afterher.They descended one floor, and the sounds of approaching boots grew very closenow, echoing only a floor or two below them.Why is she running directly into them?Before Langdon could protest, Sienna grabbed his hand and yanked him out of thestairwell along a deserted hallway of apartments—a long corridor of lockeddoors.There’s nowhere to hide!Sienna flipped a light switch and a few bulbs went out, but the dim hallway didlittle to hide them. Sienna and Langdon were clearly visible here. Thethundering footsteps were nearly upon them now, and Langdon knew theirassailants would appear on the staircase at any moment, with a direct view downthis hall.“I need your jacket,” Sienna whispered as she yanked Langdon’s suit jacket offhim. She then forced Langdon to crouch on his haunches behind her in a recesseddoorframe. “Don’t move.”What is she doing? She’s in plain sight!The soldiers appeared on the staircase, rushing upward but stopping short whenthey saw Sienna in the darkened hallway.“Per l’amore di Dio!” Sienna shouted at them, her tone scathing. “Cos’è questaconfusione?”The two men squinted, clearly uncertain what they were looking at.Sienna kept yelling at them. “Tanto chiasso a quest’ora!” So much noise at thishour!Langdon now saw that Sienna had draped his black jacket over her head andshoulders like an old woman’s shawl. She had hunched over, positioning herselfto obstruct their view of Langdon crouched in the shadows, and now, utterlytransformed, she hobbled one step toward them and screamed like a senile oldwoman.One of the soldiers held up his hand, motioning for her to return to herapartment. “Signora! Rientri subito in casa!”Sienna took another rickety step, shaking her fist angrily. “Avete svegliato miomarito, che è malato!”Langdon listened in bewilderment. They woke up your ailing husband?The other soldier now raised his machine gun and aimed directly at her. “Ferma osparo!”Sienna stopped short, cursing them mercilessly as she hobbled backward, awayfrom them.The men hurried on, disappearing up the stairs.Not quite Shakespearean acting, Langdon thought, but impressive. Apparently abackground in drama could be a versatile weapon.Sienna removed the jacket from her head and tossed it back to Langdon. “Okay,follow me.”This time Langdon followed without hesitation.They descended to the landing above the lobby, where two more soldiers were justentering the elevator to go upstairs. On the street outside, another soldierstood watch beside the van, his black uniform stretched taut across his muscularbody. In silence, Sienna and Langdon hurried downstairs toward the basement.The underground carport was dark and smelled of urine. Sienna jogged over to acorner packed with scooters and motorcycles. She stopped at a silver Trike—athree-wheeled moped contraption that looked like the ungainly offspring of anItalian Vespa and an adult tricycle. She ran her slender hand beneath theTrike’s front fender and removed a small magnetized case. Inside was a key,which she inserted, and revved the engine.Seconds later, Langdon was seated behind her on the bike. Precariously perchedon the small seat, Langdon groped at his sides, looking for handgrips orsomething to steady himself.“Not the moment for modesty,” Sienna said, grabbing his hands and wrapping themaround her slender waist. “You’ll want to hold on.”Langdon did exactly that as Sienna gunned the Trike up the exit ramp. Thevehicle had more power than he would have imagined, and they nearly left theground as they launched out of the garage, emerging into the early-morning lightabout fifty yards from the main entrance. The brawny soldier in front of thebuilding turned at once to see Langdon and Sienna tearing away, their Trikeletting out a high-pitched whine as she opened the throttle.Perched on the back, Langdon peered back over his shoulder toward the soldier,who now raised his weapon and took careful aim. Langdon braced himself. A singleshot rang out, ricocheting off the Trike’s back fender, barely missing the baseof Langdon’s spine.Jesus!Sienna made a hard left at an intersection, and Langdon felt himself sliding,fighting to keep his balance.“Lean toward me!” she shouted.Langdon leaned forward, centering himself again as Sienna raced the Trike down alarger thoroughfare. They had driven a full block before Langdon began breathingagain.Who the hell were those men?!Sienna’s focus remained locked on the road ahead as she raced down the avenue,weaving in and out of the light morning traffic. Several pedestrians did doubletakes as they passed, apparently puzzled to see a six-foot man in a Brioni suitriding behind a slender woman.Langdon and Sienna had traveled three blocks and were approaching a majorintersection when horns blared up ahead. A sleek black van rounded the corner ontwo wheels, fishtailing into the intersection, and then accelerating up the roaddirectly toward them. The van was identical to the soldiers’ van back at theapartment building.Sienna immediately swerved hard to her right and slammed on the brakes.Langdon’s chest pressed hard into her back as she skidded to a stop out of sightbehind a parked delivery truck. She nestled the Trike up to the rear bumper ofthe truck and killed the engine.Did they see us!?She and Langdon huddled low and waited … breathless.The van roared past without hesitation, apparently never having seen them. Asthe vehicle sped by, however, Langdon caught a fleeting glimpse of someoneinside.In the backseat, an attractive older woman was wedged between two soldiers likea captive. Her eyes sagged and her head bobbed as if she were delirious or maybedrugged. She wore an amulet and had long silver hair that fell in ringlets.For a moment Langdon’s throat clenched, and he thought he’d seen a ghost.It was the woman from his visions."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17THE PROVOST STORMED out of the control room and marched along the long starboarddeck of The Mendacium, trying to gather his thoughts. What had just transpiredat the Florence apartment building was unthinkable.He circled the entire ship twice before stalking into his office and taking outa bottle of fifty-year-old Highland Park single malt. Without pouring a glass,he set down the bottle and turned his back on it—a personal reminder that he wasstill very much in control.His eyes moved instinctively to a heavy, weathered tome on his bookshelf—a giftfrom a client … the client whom he now wished he’d never met.A year ago … how could I have known?The provost did not normally interview prospective clients personally, but thisone had come to him through a trusted source, and so he had made an exception.It had been a dead calm day at sea when the client arrived aboard The Mendaciumvia his own private helicopter. The visitor, a notable figure in his field, wasforty-six, clean-cut, and exceptionally tall, with piercing green eyes.“As you know,” the man had begun, “your services were recommended to me by amutual friend.” The visitor stretched out his long legs and made himself at homein the provost’s lushly appointed office. “So, let me tell you what I need.”“Actually, no,” the provost interrupted, showing the man who was in charge. “Myprotocol requires that you tell me nothing. I will explain the services Iprovide, and you will decide which, if any, are of interest to you.”The visitor looked taken aback but acquiesced and listened intently. In the end,what the lanky newcomer desired had turned out to be very standard fare for theConsortium—essentially a chance to become “invisible” for a while so he couldpursue an endeavor far from prying eyes.Child’s play.The Consortium would accomplish this by providing him a fake identity and asecure location, entirely off the grid, where he could do his work in totalsecrecy—whatever his work might be. The Consortium never inquired for whatpurpose a client required a service, preferring to know as little as possibleabout those for whom they worked.For a full year, at a staggering profit, the provost had provided safe haven tothe green-eyed man, who had turned out to be an ideal client. The provost had nocontact with him, and all of his bills were paid on time.Then, two weeks ago, everything changed.Unexpectedly, the client had made contact, demanding a personal meeting with theprovost. Considering the sum of money the client had paid, the provost obliged.The disheveled man who arrived on the yacht was barely recognizable as thesteady, clean-cut person with whom the provost had done business the yearbefore. He had a wild look in his once-sharp green eyes. He looked almost … ill.What happened to him? What has he been doing?The provost had ushered the jittery man into his office.“The silver-haired devil,” his client stammered. “She’s getting closer everyday.”The provost glanced down at his client’s file, eyeing the photo of theattractive silver-haired woman. “Yes,” the provost said, “your silver-haireddevil. We are well aware of your enemies. And as powerful as she may be, for afull year we’ve kept her from you, and we will continue to do so.”The green-eyed man anxiously twisted strands of greasy hair around hisfingertips. “Don’t let her beauty fool you, she is a dangerous foe.”True, the provost thought, still displeased that his client had drawn theattention of someone so influential. The silver-haired woman had tremendousaccess and resources—not the kind of adversary the provost appreciated having todeflect.“If she or her demons locate me …” the client began.“They won’t,” the provost had assured him. “Have we not thus far hidden you andprovided you everything you’ve requested?”“Yes,” the man said. “And yet, I will sleep easier if …” He paused, regrouping.“I need to know that if anything happens to me, you will carry out my finalwishes.”“Those wishes being?”The man reached into a bag and pulled out a small, sealed envelope. “Thecontents of this envelope provide access to a safe-deposit box in Florence.Inside the box, you will find a small object. If anything happens to me, I needyou to deliver the object for me. It is a gift of sorts.”“Very well.” The provost lifted his pen to make notes. “And to whom shall Ideliver it?”“To the silver-haired devil.”The provost glanced up. “A gift for your tormentor?”“More of a thorn in her side.” His eyes flashed wildly. “A clever little barbfashioned from a bone. She will discover it is a map … her own personal Virgil …an escort to the center of her own private hell.”The provost studied him for a long moment. “As you wish. Consider it done.”“The timing will be critical,” the man urged. “The gift should not be deliveredtoo soon. You must keep it hidden until …” He paused, suddenly lost in thought.“Until when?” the provost prodded.The man stood abruptly and walked over behind the provost’s desk, grabbing a redmarker and frantically circling a date on the provost’s personal desk calendar.“Until this day.”The provost set his jaw and exhaled, swallowing his displeasure at the man’sbrazenness. “Understood,” the provost said. “I will do nothing until the circledday, at which time the object in the safe-deposit box, whatever it may be, willbe delivered to the silver-haired woman. You have my word.” He counted the dayson his calendar until the awkwardly circled date. “I will carry out your wishesin precisely fourteen days from now.”“And not one day before!” the client admonished feverishly.“I understand,” the provost assured. “Not a day before.”The provost took the envelope, slid it into the man’s file, and made thenecessary notations to ensure that his client’s wishes were followed precisely.While his client had not described the exact nature of the object in thesafe-deposit box, the provost preferred it this way. Detachment was acornerstone of the Consortium’s philosophy. Provide the service. Ask noquestions. Pass no judgment.The client’s shoulders softened and he exhaled heavily. “Thank you.”“Anything else?” the provost had asked, eager to rid himself of his transformedclient.“Yes, actually, there is.” He reached into his pocket and produced a small,crimson memory stick. “This is a video file.” He laid the memory stick in frontof the provost. “I would like it uploaded to the world media.”The provost studied the man curiously. The Consortium often mass-distributedinformation for clients, and yet something about this man’s request feltdisconcerting. “On the same date?” the provost asked, motioning at the scrawledcircle on his calendar.“Same exact date,” the client replied. “Not one moment before.”“Understood.” The provost tagged the red memory stick with the properinformation. “So that’s it, then?” He stood up, attempting to end the meeting.His client remained seated. “No. There is one final thing.”The provost sat back down.The client’s green eyes were looking almost feral now. “Shortly after youdeliver this video, I will become a very famous man.”You are already a famous man, the provost had thought, considering his client’simpressive accomplishments.“And you will deserve some of the credit,” the man said. “The service you haveprovided has enabled me to create my masterpiece … an opus that is going tochange the world. You should be proud of your role.”“Whatever your masterpiece is,” the provost said with growing impatience, “I’mpleased you have had the privacy required to create it.”“As a show of thanks, I’ve brought you a parting gift.” The unkempt man reachedinto his bag. “A book.”The provost wondered if perhaps this book was the secret opus the client hadbeen working on for all this time. “And did you write this book?”“No.” The man heaved a massive tome up onto the table. “Quite to the contrary …this book was written for me.”Puzzled, the provost eyed the edition his client had produced. He thinks thiswas written for him? The volume was a literary classic … written in thefourteenth century.“Read it,” the client urged with an eerie smile. “It will help you understandall I have done.”With that, the unkempt visitor had stood up, said good-bye, and abruptlydeparted. The provost watched through his office window as the man’s helicopterlifted off the deck and headed back toward the coast of Italy.Then the provost returned his attention to the large book before him. Withuncertain fingers, he lifted the leather cover and thumbed to the beginning. Theopening stanza of the work was written in large calligraphy, taking up theentire first page.INFERNOMidway upon the journey of our lifeI found myself within a forest dark,for the straightforward pathway had been lost.On the opposing page, his client had signed the book with a handwritten message:My dear friend, thank you for helping me find the path.The world thanks you, too.The provost had no idea what this meant, but he’d read enough. He closed thebook and placed it on his bookshelf. Thankfully, his professional relationshipwith this strange individual would be over soon. Fourteen more days, the provostthought, turning his gaze to the wildly scrawled red circle on his personalcalendar.In the days that followed, the provost felt uncharacteristically on edge aboutthis client. The man seemed to have come unhinged. Nonetheless, despite theprovost’s intuition, the time passed without incident.Then, just before the circled date, there occurred a rapid series of calamitousevents in Florence. The provost tried to handle the crisis, but it quicklyaccelerated out of control. The crisis climaxed with his client’s breathlessascent up the Badia tower.He jumped off … to his death.Despite his horror at losing a client, especially in this manner, the provostremained a man of his word. He quickly began preparing to make good on his finalpromise to the deceased—the delivery to the silver-haired woman of the contentsof a safe-deposit box in Florence—the timing of which, he had been admonished,was critical.Not before the date circled in your calendar.The provost gave the envelope containing the safe-deposit-box codes to Vayentha,who had traveled to Florence to recover the object inside—this “clever littlebarb.” When Vayentha called in, however, her news was both startling and deeplyalarming. The contents of the safe-deposit box had already been removed, andVayentha had barely escaped being detained. Somehow, the silver-haired woman hadlearned of the account and had used her influence to gain access to thesafe-deposit box and also to place an arrest warrant on anyone else who showedup looking to open it.That was three days ago.The client had clearly intended the purloined object to be his final insult tothe silver-haired woman—a taunting voice from the grave.And yet now it speaks too soon.The Consortium had been in a desperate scramble ever since—using all itsresources to protect its client’s final wishes, as well as itself. In theprocess, the Consortium had crossed a series of lines from which the provostknew it would be hard to return. Now, with everything unraveling in Florence,the provost stared down at his desk and wondered what the future held.On his calendar, the client’s wildly scrawled circle stared up at him—a crazedring of red ink around an apparently special day.Tomorrow.Reluctantly, the provost eyed the bottle of Scotch on the table before him.Then, for the first time in fourteen years, he poured a glass and drained it ina single gulp.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Belowdecks, facilitator Laurence Knowlton pulled the little red memory stickfrom his computer and set it on the desk in front of him. The video was one ofthe strangest things he had ever seen.And it was precisely nine minutes long … to the second.Feeling uncharacteristically alarmed, he stood and paced his tiny cubicle,wondering again whether he should share the bizarre video with the provost.Just do your job, Knowlton told himself. No questions. No judgment.Forcing the video from his mind, he marked his planner with a confirmed task.Tomorrow, as requested by the client, he would upload the video file to themedia."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18VIALE NICCOLÒ MACHIAVELLI has been called the most graceful of all Florentineavenues. With wide S-curves that serpentine through lushly wooded landscapes ofhedges and deciduous trees, the drive is a favorite among cyclists and Ferrarienthusiasts.Sienna expertly maneuvered the Trike through each arching curve as they leftbehind the dingy residential neighborhood and moved into the clean, cedar-ladenair of the city’s upscale west bank. They passed a chapel clock that was justchiming 8 A.M.Langdon held on, his mind churning with mystifying images of Dante’s inferno …and the mysterious face of a beautiful silver-haired woman he had just seenwedged in between two huge soldiers in the backseat of the van.Whoever she is, Langdon thought, they have her now.“The woman in the van,” Sienna said over the noise of the Trike’s engine.“You’re sure it was the same woman from your visions?”“Absolutely.”“Then you must have met her at some point in the past two days. The question iswhy you keep seeing her … and why she keeps telling you to seek and find.”Langdon agreed. “I don’t know … I have no recollection of meeting her, but everytime I see her face, I have an overwhelming sense that I need to help her.”Very sorry. Very sorry.Langdon suddenly wondered if maybe his strange apology had been directed to thesilver-haired woman. Did I fail her somehow? The thought left a knot in his gut.For Langdon, it felt as if a vital weapon had been extracted from his arsenal. Ihave no memory. Eidetic since childhood, Langdon’s memory was the intellectualasset he relied on most. For a man accustomed to recalling every intricatedetail of what he saw around him, functioning without his memory felt likeattempting to land a plane in the dark with no radar.“It seems like your only chance of finding answers is to decipher La Mappa,”Sienna said. “Whatever secret it holds … it seems to be the reason you’re beinghunted.”Langdon nodded, thinking about the word catrovacer, set against the backdrop ofwrithing bodies in Dante’s Inferno.Suddenly a clear thought emerged in Langdon’s head.I awoke in Florence …No city on earth was more closely tied to Dante than Florence. Dante Alighierihad been born in Florence, grew up in Florence, fell in love, according tolegend, with Beatrice in Florence, and was cruelly exiled from his home inFlorence, destined to wander the Italian countryside for years, longingsoulfully for his home.You shall leave everything you love most, Dante wrote of banishment. This is thearrow that the bow of exile shoots first.As Langdon recalled those words from the seventeenth canto of the Paradiso, helooked to the right, gazing out across the Arno River toward the distant spiresof old Florence.Langdon pictured the layout of the old city—a labyrinth of tourists, congestion,and traffic bustling through narrow streets around Florence’s famed cathedral,museums, chapels, and shopping districts. He suspected that if he and Siennaditched the Trike, they could evaporate into the throngs of people.“The old city is where we need to go,” Langdon declared. “If there are answers,that’s where they’ll probably be. Old Florence was Dante’s entire world.”Sienna nodded her agreement and called over her shoulder, “It will be safer,too—plenty of places to hide. I’ll head for Porta Romana, and from there, we cancross the river.”The river, Langdon thought with a touch of trepidation. Dante’s famous journeyinto hell had begun by crossing a river as well.Sienna opened up the throttle, and as the landscape blurred past, Langdonmentally scanned through images of the inferno, the dead and dying, the tenditches of the Malebolge with the plague doctor and the strange word—CATROVACER.He pondered the words scrawled beneath La Mappa—The truth can be glimpsed onlythrough the eyes of death—and wondered if the grim saying might be a quote fromDante.I don’t recognize it.Langdon was well versed in Dante’s work, and his prominence as an art historianwho specialized in iconography meant he was occasionally called upon tointerpret the vast array of symbols that populated Dante’s landscape.Coincidentally, or perhaps not so coincidentally, he had given a lecture onDante’s Inferno about two years earlier.“Divine Dante: Symbols of Hell.”Dante Alighieri had evolved into one of history’s true cult icons, sparking thecreation of Dante societies all around the world. The oldest American branch hadbeen founded in 1881 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.New England’s famous Fireside Poet was the first American to translate TheDivine Comedy, his translation remaining among the most respected and widelyread to this day.As a noted student of Dante’s work, Langdon had been asked to speak at a majorevent hosted by one of the world’s oldest Dante societies—Società DanteAlighieri Vienna. The event was slated to take place at the Viennese Academy ofSciences. The event’s primary sponsor—a wealthy scientist and Dante Societymember—had managed to secure the academy’s two-thousand-seat lecture hall.When Langdon arrived at the event, he was met by the conference director andushered inside. As they crossed the lobby, Langdon couldn’t help but notice thefive words painted in gargantuan letters across the back wall: WHAT IF GOD WASWRONG?“It’s a Lukas Troberg,” the director whispered. “Our newest art installation.What do you think?”Langdon eyed the massive text, uncertain how to respond. “Um … his brushstrokesare lavish, but his command of the subjunctive seems sparse.”The director gave him a confused look. Langdon hoped his rapport with theaudience would be better.When he finally stepped onstage, Langdon received a rousing round of applausefrom a crowd that was standing room only.“Meine Damen und Herren,” Langdon began, his voice booming over theloudspeakers. “Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome.”The famous line from Cabaret drew appreciative laughter from the crowd.“I’ve been informed that our audience tonight contains not only Dante Societymembers, but also many visiting scientists and students who may be exploringDante for the first time. So, for those in the audience who have been too busystudying to read medieval Italian epics, I thought I’d begin with a quickoverview of Dante—his life, his work, and why he is considered one of the mostinfluential figures in all of history.”More applause.Using the tiny remote in his hand, Langdon called up a series of images ofDante, the first being Andrea del Castagno’s full-length portrait of the poetstanding in a doorway, clutching a book of philosophy.“Dante Alighieri,” Langdon began. “This Florentine writer and philosopher livedfrom 1265 to 1321. In this portrait, as in nearly all depictions, he wears onhis head a red cappuccio—a tight-fitting, plaited hood with earflaps—which,along with his crimson Lucca robe, has become the most widely reproduced imageof Dante.”Langdon advanced slides to the Botticelli portrait of Dante from the UffiziGallery, which stressed Dante’s most salient features, a heavy jaw and hookednose. “Here, Dante’s unique face is once again framed by his red cappuccio, butin this instance Botticelli has added a laurel wreath to his cap as a symbol ofexpertise—in this case in the poetic arts—a traditional symbol borrowed fromancient Greece and used even today in ceremonies honoring poet laureates andNobel laureates.”Langdon quickly scrolled through several other images, all showing Dante in hisred cap, red tunic, laurel wreath, and prominent nose. “And to round out yourimage of Dante, here is a statue from the Piazza di Santa Croce … and, ofcourse, the famous fresco attributed to Giotto in the chapel of the Bargello.”Langdon left the slide of Giotto’s fresco on the screen and walked to the centerof the stage.“As you are no doubt aware, Dante is best known for his monumental literarymasterpiece—The Divine Comedy—a brutally vivid account of the author’s descentinto hell, passage through purgatory, and eventual ascent into paradise tocommune with God. By modern standards, The Divine Comedy has nothing comedicabout it. It’s called a comedy for another reason entirely. In the fourteenthcentury, Italian literature was, by requirement, divided into two categories:tragedy, representing high literature, was written in formal Italian; comedy,representing low literature, was written in the vernacular and geared toward thegeneral population.”Langdon advanced slides to the iconic fresco by Michelino, which showed Dantestanding outside the walls of Florence clutching a copy of The Divine Comedy. Inthe background, the terraced mountain of purgatory rose high above the gates ofhell. The painting now hung in Florence’s Cathedral of Santa Maria delFiore—better known as Il Duomo.“As you may have guessed from the title,” Langdon continued, “The Divine Comedywas written in the vernacular—the language of the people. Even so, itbrilliantly fused religion, history, politics, philosophy, and social commentaryin a tapestry of fiction that, while erudite, remained wholly accessible to themasses. The work became such a pillar of Italian culture that Dante’s writingstyle has been credited with nothing less than the codification of the modernItalian language.”Langdon paused a moment for effect and then whispered, “My friends, it isimpossible to overstate the influence of Dante Alighieri’s work. Throughout allof history, with the sole exception perhaps of Holy Scripture, no single work ofwriting, art, music, or literature has inspired more tributes, imitations,variations, and annotations than The Divine Comedy.”After listing the vast array of famous composers, artists, and authors who hadcreated works based on Dante’s epic poem, Langdon scanned the crowd. “So tellme, do we have any authors here tonight?”Nearly one-third of the hands went up. Langdon stared out in shock. Wow, eitherthis is the most accomplished audience on earth, or this e-publishing thing isreally taking off.“Well, as all of you authors know, there is nothing a writer appreciates morethan a blurb—one of those single-line endorsements from a powerful individual,designed to make others want to buy your work. And, in the Middle Ages, blurbsexisted, too. And Dante got quite a few of them.”Langdon changed slides. “How would you like to have this on your book jacket?”Ne’er walked the earth a greater man than he.—MichelangeloA murmur of surprise rustled through the crowd.“Yes,” Langdon said, “that’s the same Michelangelo you all know from the SistineChapel and the David. In addition to being a master painter and sculptor,Michelangelo was a superb poet, publishing nearly three hundred poems—includingone titled ‘Dante,’ dedicated to the man whose stark visions of hell were thosethat inspired Michelangelo’s Last Judgment. And if you don’t believe me, readthe third canto of Dante’s Inferno and then visit the Sistine Chapel; just abovethe altar, you’ll see this familiar image.”Langdon advanced slides to a frightening detail of a muscle-bound beast swinginga giant paddle at cowering people. “This is Dante’s hellish ferryman, Charon,beating straggling passengers with an oar.”Langdon moved now to a new slide—a second detail of Michelangelo’s LastJudgment—a man being crucified. “This is Haman the Agagite, who, according toScripture, was hanged to death. However, in Dante’s poem, he was crucifiedinstead. As you can see here in the Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo chose Dante’sversion over that of the Bible.” Langdon grinned and lowered his voice to awhisper. “Don’t tell the pope.”The crowd laughed.“Dante’s Inferno created a world of pain and suffering beyond all previous humanimagination, and his writing quite literally defined our modern visions ofhell.” Langdon paused. “And believe me, the Catholic Church has much to thankDante for. His Inferno terrified the faithful for centuries, and no doubttripled church attendance among the fearful.”Langdon switched the slide. “And this leads us to the reason we are all heretonight.”The screen now displayed the title of his lecture: DIVINE DANTE: SYMBOLS OFHELL.“Dante’s Inferno is a landscape so rich in symbolism and iconography that Ioften dedicate an entire semester course to it. And tonight, I thought therewould be no better way to unveil the symbols of Dante’s Inferno than to walkside by side with him … through the gates of hell.”Langdon paced out to the edge of the stage and surveyed the crowd. “Now, ifwe’re planning on taking a stroll through hell, I strongly recommend we use amap. And there is no map of Dante’s hell more complete and accurate than the onepainted by Sandro Botticelli.”He touched his remote, and Botticelli’s forbidding Mappa dell’Infernomaterialized before the crowd. He could hear several groans as people absorbedthe various horrors taking place in the funnel-shaped subterranean cavern.“Unlike some artists, Botticelli was extremely faithful in his interpretation ofDante’s text. In fact, he spent so much time reading Dante that the great arthistorian Giorgio Vasari said Botticelli’s obsession with Dante led to ‘seriousdisorders in his living.’ Botticelli created more than two dozen other worksrelating to Dante, but this map is his most famous.”Langdon turned now, pointing to the upper left-hand corner of the painting. “Ourjourney will begin up there, aboveground, where you can see Dante in red, alongwith his guide, Virgil, standing outside the gates of hell. From there we willtravel downward, through the nine rings of Dante’s inferno, and eventually comeface-to-face with …”Langdon quickly flashed to a new slide—a giant enlargement of Satan as depictedby Botticelli in this very painting—a horrific, three-headed Lucifer consumingthree different people, one in each mouth.The crowd gasped audibly.“A glance at coming attractions,” Langdon announced. “This frightening characterhere is where tonight’s journey will end. This is the ninth ring of hell, whereSatan himself resides. However …” Langdon paused. “Getting there is half thefun, so let’s rewind a bit … back up to the gates of hell, where our journeybegins.”Langdon moved to the next slide—a Gustave Doré lithograph that depicted a dark,tunneled entrance carved into the face of an austere cliff. The inscriptionabove the door read: ABANDON ALL HOPE, YE WHO ENTER HERE.“So …” Langdon said with a smile. “Shall we enter?”Somewhere tires screeched loudly, and the audience evaporated before Langdon’seyes. He felt himself lurch forward, and he collided with Sienna’s back as theTrike skidded to a stop in the middle of the Viale Machiavelli.Langdon reeled, still thinking about the gates of hell looming before him. As heregained his bearings, he saw where he was.“What’s going on?” he demanded.Sienna pointed three hundred yards ahead to the Porta Romana—the ancient stonegateway that served as the entrance to old Florence. “Robert, we’ve got aproblem.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19AGENT BRÜDER STOOD in the humble apartment and tried to make sense of what hewas seeing. Who the hell lives here? The decor was sparse and jumbled, like acollege dorm room furnished on a budget.“Agent Brüder?” one of his men called from down the hall. “You’ll want to seethis.”As Brüder made his way down the hall, he wondered if the local police haddetained Langdon yet. Brüder would have preferred to solve this crisis“in-house,” but Langdon’s escape had left little choice but to enlist localpolice support and set up roadblocks. An agile motorbike on the labyrinthinestreets of Florence would easily elude Brüder’s vans, whose heavy polycarbonatewindows and solid, puncture-proof tires made them impenetrable but lumbering.The Italian police had a reputation for being uncooperative with outsiders, butBrüder’s organization had significant influence—police, consulates, embassies.When we make demands, nobody dares question.Brüder entered the small office where his man stood over an open laptop andtyped in latex gloves. “This is the machine he used,” the man said. “Langdonused it to access his e-mail and run some searches. The files are still cached.”Brüder moved toward the desk.“It doesn’t appear to be Langdon’s computer,” the tech said. “It’s registered tosomeone initialed S.C.—I should have a full name shortly.”As Brüder waited, his eyes were drawn to a stack of papers on the desk. Hepicked them up, thumbing through the unusual array—an old playbill from theLondon Globe Theatre and a series of newspaper articles. The more Brüder read,the wider his eyes became.Taking the documents, Brüder slipped back into the hall and placed a call to hisboss. “It’s Brüder,” he said. “I think I’ve got an ID on the person helpingLangdon.”“Who is it?” his boss replied.Brüder exhaled slowly. “You’re not going to believe this.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Two miles away, Vayentha hunkered low on her BMW as it fled the area. Policecars raced past her in the opposite direction, sirens blaring.I’ve been disavowed, she thought.Normally, the soft vibration of the motorcycle’s four-stroke engine helped calmher nerves. Not today.Vayentha had worked for the Consortium for twelve years, climbing the ranks fromground support, to strategy coordination, all the way to a high-ranked fieldagent. My career is all I have. Field agents endured a life of secrecy, travel,and long missions, all of which precluded any real outside life orrelationships.I’ve been on this same mission for a year, she thought, still unable to believethe provost had pulled the trigger and disavowed her so abruptly.For twelve months Vayentha had been overseeing support services for the sameclient of the Consortium—an eccentric, green-eyed genius who wanted only to“disappear” for a while so he could work unmolested by his rivals and enemies.He traveled very rarely, and always invisibly, but mostly he worked. The natureof this man’s work was not known to Vayentha, whose contract had simply been tokeep the client hidden from the powerful people trying to find him.Vayentha had performed the service with consummate professionalism, andeverything had gone perfectly.Perfectly, that was … until last night.Vayentha’s emotional state and career had been in a downward spiral ever since.I’m on the outside now.The disavowal protocol, if invoked, required that the agent instantly abandonher current mission and exit “the arena” at once. If the agent were captured,the Consortium would disavow all knowledge of the agent. Agents knew better thanto press their luck with the organization, having witnessed firsthand itsdisturbing ability to manipulate reality into whatever suited its needs.Vayentha knew of only two agents who had been disavowed. Strangely, she hadnever seen either of them again. She had always assumed they had been called infor their formal review and fired, required never to make contact again withConsortium employees.Now, however, Vayentha was not so sure.You’re overreacting, she tried to tell herself. The Consortium’s methods are farmore elegant than cold-blooded murder.Even so, she felt a fresh chill sweep through her body.It had been instinct that urged her to flee the hotel rooftop unseen the momentshe saw Brüder’s team arrive, and she wondered if that instinct had saved her.Nobody knows where I am now.As Vayentha sped northward on the sleek straightaway of the Viale del PoggioImperiale, she realized what a difference a few hours had made for her. Lastnight she had been worried about protecting her job. Now she was worried aboutprotecting her life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20FLORENCE WAS ONCE a walled city, its primary entrance the stone gateway of thePorta Romana, built in 1326. While most of the city’s perimeter walls weredestroyed centuries ago, the Porta Romana still exists, and to this day, trafficenters the city by funneling through deep arched tunnels in the colossalfortification.The gateway itself is a fifty-foot-tall barrier of ancient brick and stone whoseprimary passageway still retains its massive bolted wooden doors, which arepropped open at all times to let traffic pass through. Six major roads convergein front of these doors, filtering into a rotary whose grassy median isdominated by a large Pistoletto statue depicting a woman departing the citygates carrying an enormous bundle on her head.Although nowadays it is more of a snarled traffic nightmare, Florence’s austerecity gate was once the site of the Fiera dei Contratti—the Contracts Fair—atwhich fathers sold their daughters into a contracted marriage, often forcingthem to dance provocatively in an effort to secure higher dowries.This morning, several hundred yards short of the gateway, Sienna had screechedto a stop and was now pointing in alarm. On the back of the Trike, Langdonlooked ahead and immediately shared her apprehension. In front of them, a longline of cars idled at a full stop. Traffic in the rotary had been halted by apolice barricade, and more police cars were now arriving. Armed officers werewalking from car to car, asking questions.That can’t be for us, Langdon thought. Can it?A sweaty cyclist came pedaling toward them up the Viale Machiavelli away fromthe traffic. He was on a recumbent bike, his bare legs pumping out in front ofhim.Sienna shouted out to him. “Cos’ è successo?”“E chi lo sa!” he shouted back, looking concerned. “Carabinieri.” He hurriedpast, looking eager to clear the area.Sienna turned to Langdon, her expression grim. “Roadblock. Military police.”Sirens wailed in the distance behind them, and Sienna spun in her seat, staringback up the Viale Machiavelli, her face now masked with fear.We’re trapped in the middle, Langdon thought, scanning the area for any exit atall—an intersecting road, a park, a driveway—but all he saw were privateresidences on their left and a high stone wall to their right.The sirens grew louder.“Up there,” Langdon urged, pointing thirty yards ahead to a desertedconstruction site where a portable cement mixer offered at least a little bit ofcover.Sienna gunned the bike up onto the sidewalk and raced into the work area. Theyparked behind the cement mixer, quickly realizing that it offered barely enoughconcealment for the Trike alone.“Follow me,” Sienna said, rushing toward a small portable toolshed nestled inthe bushes against the stone wall.That’s not a toolshed, Langdon realized, his nose crinkling as they got closer.That’s a Porta-Potty.As Langdon and Sienna arrived outside the construction workers’ chemical toilet,they could hear police cars approaching from behind them. Sienna yanked the doorhandle, but it didn’t budge. A heavy chain and padlock secured it. Langdongrabbed Sienna’s arm and pulled her around behind the structure, forcing herinto the narrow space between the toilet and the stone wall. The two of thembarely fit, and the air smelled putrid and heavy.Langdon slid in behind her just as a jet-black Subaru Forester came into viewwith the word CARABINIERI emblazoned on its side. The vehicle rolled slowly pasttheir location.The Italian military police, Langdon thought, incredulous. He wondered if theseofficers also had orders to shoot on sight.“Someone is dead serious about finding us,” Sienna whispered. “And somehow theydid.”“GPS?” Langdon wondered aloud. “Maybe the projector has a tracking device init?”Sienna shook her head. “Believe me, if that thing were traceable, the policewould be right on top of us.”Langdon shifted his tall frame, trying to get comfortable in the crampedsurroundings. He found himself face-to-face with a collage of elegantly styledgraffiti scrawled on the back of the Porta-Potty.Leave it to the Italians.Most American Porta-Potties were covered with sophomoric cartoons that vaguelyresembled huge breasts or penises. The graffiti on this one, however, lookedmore like an art student’s sketchbook—a human eye, a well-rendered hand, a manin profile, and a fantastical dragon.“Destruction of property doesn’t look like this everywhere in Italy,” Siennasaid, apparently reading his mind. “The Florence Art Institute is on the otherside of this stone wall.”As if to confirm Sienna’s statement, a group of students appeared in thedistance, ambling toward them with art portfolios under their arms. They werechatting, lighting cigarettes, and puzzling over the roadblock in front of themat the Porta Romana.Langdon and Sienna crouched lower to stay out of sight of the students, and asthey did so, Langdon was struck, most unexpectedly, by a curious thought.The half-buried sinners with their legs in the air.Perhaps it was on account of the smell of human waste, or possibly the recumbentbicyclist with bare legs flailing in front of him, but whatever the stimulus,Langdon had flashed on the putrid world of the Malebolge and the naked legsprotruding upside down from the earth.He turned suddenly to his companion. “Sienna, in our version of La Mappa, theupside-down legs were in the tenth ditch, right? The lowest level of theMalebolge?”Sienna gave him an odd look, as if this were hardly the time. “Yes, at thebottom.”For a split second Langdon was back in Vienna giving his lecture. He wasstanding onstage, only moments from his grand finale, having just shown theaudience Doré’s engraving of Geryon—the winged monster with a poisonous stingingtail that lived just above the Malebolge.“Before we meet Satan,” Langdon declared, his deep voice resonating over theloudspeakers, “we must pass through the ten ditches of the Malebolge, in whichare punished the fraudulent—those guilty of deliberate evil.”Langdon advanced slides to show a detail of the Malebolge and then took theaudience down through the ditches one by one. “From top to bottom we have: theseducers whipped by demons … the flatterers adrift in human excrement … theclerical profiteers half buried upside down with their legs in the air … thesorcerers with their heads twisted backward … the corrupt politicians in boilingpitch … the hypocrites wearing heavy leaden cloaks … the thieves bitten bysnakes … the fraudulent counselors consumed by fire … the sowers of discordhacked apart by demons … and finally, the liars, who are diseased beyondrecognition.” Langdon turned back to the audience. “Dante most likely reservedthis final ditch for the liars because a series of lies told about him led tohis exile from his beloved Florence.”“Robert?” The voice was Sienna’s.Langdon snapped back to the present.Sienna was staring at him quizzically. “What is it?”“Our version of La Mappa,” he said excitedly. “The art has been changed!” Hefished the projector out of his jacket pocket and shook it as best as he couldin the close quarters. The agitator ball rattled loudly, but all the sirensdrowned it out. “Whoever created this image reconfigured the order of the levelsin the Malebolge!”When the device began to glow, Langdon pointed it at the flat surface beforethem. La Mappa dell’Inferno appeared, glowing brightly in the dim light.Botticelli on a chemical toilet, Langdon thought, ashamed. This had to be theleast elegant place a Botticelli had ever been displayed. Langdon ran his eyesdown through the ten ditches and began nodding excitedly.“Yes!” he exclaimed. “This is wrong! The last ditch of the Malebolge is supposedto be full of diseased people, not people upside down. The tenth level is forthe liars, not the clerical profiteers!”Sienna looked intrigued. “But … why would someone change that?”“Catrovacer,” Langdon whispered, eyeing the little letters that had been addedto each level. “I don’t think that’s what this really says.”Despite the injury that had erased Langdon’s recollections of the last two days,he could now feel his memory working perfectly. He closed his eyes and held thetwo versions of La Mappa in his mind’s eye to analyze their differences. Thechanges to the Malebolge were fewer than Langdon had imagined … and yet he feltlike a veil had suddenly been lifted.Suddenly it was crystal clear.Seek and ye shall find!“What is it?” Sienna demanded.Langdon’s mouth felt dry. “I know why I’m here in Florence.”“You do?!”“Yes, and I know where I’m supposed to go.”Sienna grabbed his arm. “Where?!”Langdon felt as if his feet had just touched solid ground for the first timesince he’d awoken in the hospital. “These ten letters,” he whispered. “Theyactually point to a precise location in the old city. That’s where the answersare.”“Where in the old city?!” Sienna demanded. “What did you figure out?”The sounds of laughing voices echoed on the other side of the Porta-Potty.Another group of art students was passing by, joking and chatting in variouslanguages. Langdon peered cautiously around the cubicle, watching them go. Thenhe scanned for police. “We’ve got to keep moving. I’ll explain on the way.”“On the way?!” Sienna shook her head. “We’ll never get through the PortaRomana!”“Stay here for thirty seconds,” he told her, “and then follow my lead.”With that, Langdon slipped away, leaving his newfound friend bewildered andalone."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21“SCUSI!” ROBERT LANGDON chased after the group of students. “Scusate!”They all turned, and Langdon made a show of glancing around like a lost tourist.“Dov’è l’Istituto statale d’arte?” Langdon asked in broken Italian.A tattooed kid puffed coolly on a cigarette and snidely replied, “Non parliamoitaliano.” His accent was French.One of the girls admonished her tattooed friend and politely pointed down thelong wall toward the Porta Romana. “Più avanti, sempre dritto.”Straight ahead, Langdon translated. “Grazie.”On cue, Sienna emerged unseen from behind the Porta-Potty and walked over. Thewillowy thirty-two-year-old approached the group and Langdon placed a welcominghand on her shoulder. “This is my sister, Sienna. She’s an art teacher.”The tattooed kid muttered, “T-I-L-F,” and his male friends laughed.Langdon ignored them. “We’re in Florence researching possible spots for ateaching year abroad. Can we walk in with you?”“Ma certo,” the Italian girl said with a smile.As the group migrated toward the police at the Porta Romana, Sienna fell intoconversation with the students while Langdon merged to the middle of the group,slouching low, trying to stay out of sight.Seek and ye shall find, Langdon thought, his pulse racing with excitement as hepictured the ten ditches of the Malebolge.Catrovacer. These ten letters, Langdon had realized, stood at the core of one ofthe art world’s most enigmatic mysteries, a centuries-old puzzle that had neverbeen solved. In 1563, these ten letters had been used to spell a message high ona wall inside Florence’s famed Palazzo Vecchio, painted some forty feet off theground, barely visible without binoculars. It had remained hidden there in plainsight for centuries until the 1970s, when it was spotted by a now-famous artdiagnostician, who had spent decades trying to uncover its meaning. Despitenumerous theories, the significance of the message remains an enigma to thisday.For Langdon, the code felt like familiar ground—a safe harbor from this strangeand churning sea. After all, art history and ancient secrets were far moreLangdon’s realm than were biohazard tubes and gunfire.Up ahead, additional police cars had begun streaming into the Porta Romana.“Jesus,” the tattooed kid said. “Whoever they’re looking for must have donesomething terrible.”The group arrived at the Art Institute’s main gate on the right, where a crowdof students had gathered to watch the action at the Porta Romana. The school’sminimum-wage security guard was halfheartedly glancing at student IDs as kidsstreamed in, but he was clearly more interested in what was happening with thepolice.A loud screech of brakes echoed across the plaza as an all-too-familiar blackvan skidded into the Porta Romana.Langdon didn’t need a second look.Without a word, he and Sienna seized the moment, slipping through the gate withtheir new friends.The entry road to the Istituto Statale d’Arte was startlingly beautiful, almostregal in appearance. Massive oak trees arched gently in from either side,creating a canopy that framed the distant building—a huge, faded yellowstructure with a triple portico and an expansive oval lawn.This building, Langdon knew, had been commissioned, like so many in this city,by the same illustrious dynasty that had dominated Florentine politics duringthe fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries.The Medici.The name alone had become a symbol of Florence. During its three-century reign,the royal house of Medici amassed unfathomable wealth and influence, producingfour popes, two queens of France, and the largest financial institution in allof Europe. To this day, modern banks use the accounting method invented by theMedici—the dual-entry system of credits and debits.The Medici’s greatest legacy, however, was not in finance or politics, butrather in art. Perhaps the most lavish patrons the art world has ever known, theMedici provided a generous stream of commissions that fueled the Renaissance.The list of luminaries receiving Medici patronage ranged from da Vinci toGalileo to Botticelli—the latter’s most famous painting, Birth of Venus, theresult of a commission from Lorenzo de’ Medici, who requested a sexuallyprovocative painting to hang over his cousin’s marital bed as a wedding gift.Lorenzo de’ Medici—known in his day as Lorenzo the Magnificent on account of hisbenevolence—was an accomplished artist and poet in his own right and was said tohave a superb eye. In 1489 Lorenzo took a liking to the work of a youngFlorentine sculptor and invited the boy to move into the Medici palace, where hecould practice his craft surrounded by fine art, great poetry, and high culture.Under Medici tutelage, the adolescent boy flourished and eventually went on tocarve two of the most celebrated sculptures in all of history—the Pietà and theDavid. Today we know him as Michelangelo—a creative giant who is sometimescalled the Medici’s greatest gift to humankind.Considering the Medici’s passion for art, Langdon imagined the family would bepleased to know that the building before him—originally built as the Medici’sprimary horse stables—had been transformed into the vibrant Art Institute. Thistranquil site that now inspired young artists had been specifically chosen forthe Medici’s stables because of its proximity to one of the most beautifulriding areas in all of Florence.The Boboli Gardens.Langdon glanced to his left, where a forest of treetops could be seen over ahigh wall. The massive expanse of the Boboli Gardens was now a popular touristattraction. Langdon had little doubt that if he and Sienna could gain entranceto the gardens, they could make their way across it, bypassing the Porta Romanaundetected. After all, the gardens were vast and had no shortage of hidingplaces—forests, labyrinths, grottoes, nymphaea. More important, traversing theBoboli Gardens would eventually lead them to the Palazzo Pitti, the stonecitadel that once housed the main seat of the Medici grand duchy, and whose 140rooms remained one of Florence’s most frequented tourist attractions.If we can reach the Palazzo Pitti, Langdon thought, the bridge to the old cityis a stone’s throw away.Langdon motioned as calmly as possible to the high wall that enclosed thegardens. “How do we get into the gardens?” he asked. “I’d love to show my sisterbefore we tour the institute.”The tattooed kid shook his head. “You can’t get into the gardens from here. Theentrance is way over at Pitti Palace. You’d have to drive through Porta Romanaand go around.”“Bullshit,” Sienna blurted.Everyone turned and stared at her, including Langdon.“Come on,” she said, smirking coyly at the students as she stroked her blondponytail. “You’re telling me you guys don’t sneak into the gardens to smoke weedand fool around?”The kids all exchanged looks and then burst out laughing.The guy with the tattoos now looked utterly smitten. “Ma’am, you should totallyteach here.” He walked Sienna to the side of the building and pointed around thecorner to a rear parking lot. “See that shed on the left? There’s an oldplatform behind it. Climb up on the roof, and you can jump down on the otherside of the wall.”Sienna was already on the move. She glanced back at Langdon with a patronizingsmile. “Come on, brother Bob. Unless you’re too old to jump a fence?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22THE SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN in the van leaned her head against the bulletproofwindow and closed her eyes. She felt like the world was spinning beneath her.The drugs they’d given her made her feel ill.I need medical attention, she thought.Even so, the armed guard beside her had strict orders: her needs were to beignored until their task had been successfully completed. From the sounds ofchaos around her, it was clear that would be no time soon.The dizziness was increasing now, and she was having trouble breathing. As shefought off a new wave of nausea, she wondered how life had managed to deliverher to this surreal crossroads. The answer was too complex to decipher in hercurrent delirious state, but she had no doubt where it had all begun.New York.Two years ago.She had flown to Manhattan from Geneva, where she was serving as the director ofthe World Health Organization, a highly coveted and prestigious post that shehad held for nearly a decade. A specialist in communicable disease and theepidemiology of epidemics, she had been invited to the UN to deliver a lectureassessing the threat of pandemic disease in third-world countries. Her talk hadbeen upbeat and reassuring, outlining several new early-detection systems andtreatment plans devised by the World Health Organization and others. She hadreceived a standing ovation.Following the lecture, while she was in the hall talking to some lingeringacademics, a UN employee with a high-level diplomatic badge strode over andinterrupted the conversation.“Dr. Sinskey, we have just been contacted by the Council on Foreign Relations.There is someone there who would like to speak to you. A car is waitingoutside.”Puzzled and a bit unnerved, Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey excused herself and collectedher overnight bag. As her limo raced up First Avenue, she began to feelstrangely nervous.The Council on Foreign Relations?Elizabeth Sinskey, like most, had heard the rumors.Founded in the 1920s as a private think tank, the CFR had among its pastmembership nearly every secretary of state, more than a half-dozen presidents, amajority of CIA chiefs, senators, judges, as well as dynastic legends with nameslike Morgan, Rothschild, and Rockefeller. The membership’s unparalleledcollection of brainpower, political influence, and wealth had earned the Councilon Foreign Relations the reputation of being “the most influential private clubon earth.”As director of the World Health Organization, Elizabeth was no stranger torubbing shoulders with the big boys. Her long tenure at WHO, combined with heroutspoken nature, had earned her a nod recently from a major newsmagazine thatlisted her among its twenty most influential people in the world. The Face ofWorld Health, they had written beneath her photo, which Elizabeth found ironicconsidering she had been such a sick child.Suffering from severe asthma by age six, she had been treated with a high doseof a promising new drug—the first of the world’s glucocorticoids, or steroidhormones—which had cured her asthma symptoms in miraculous fashion. Sadly, thedrug’s unanticipated side effects had not emerged until years later when Sinskeypassed through puberty … and yet never developed a menstrual cycle. She wouldnever forget the dark moment in the doctor’s office, at nineteen, when shelearned that the damage to her reproductive system was permanent.Elizabeth Sinskey could never have children.Time will heal the emptiness, her doctor assured, but the sadness and anger onlygrew inside her. Cruelly, the drugs that had robbed her of her ability toconceive a child had failed to rob her of her animal instincts to do so. Fordecades, she had battled her cravings to fulfill this impossible desire. Evennow, at sixty-one years old, she still felt a pang of hollowness every time shesaw a mother and infant.“It’s just ahead, Dr. Sinskey,” the limo driver announced.Elizabeth ran a quick brush through her long silver ringlets and checked herface in the mirror. Before she knew it, the car had stopped, and the driver washelping her out onto the sidewalk in an affluent section of Manhattan.“I’ll wait here for you,” the driver said. “We can go straight to the airportwhen you’re ready.”The New York headquarters of the Council on Foreign Relations was an unobtrusiveneoclassical building on the corner of Park and Sixty-eighth that had once beenthe home of a Standard Oil tycoon. Its exterior blended seamlessly with theelegant landscape surrounding it, offering no hint of its unique purpose.“Dr. Sinskey,” a portly female receptionist greeted her. “This way, please. He’sexpecting you.”Okay, but who is he? She followed the receptionist down a luxurious corridor toa closed door, on which the woman gave a quick knock before opening it andmotioning for Elizabeth to enter.She went in, and the door closed behind her.The small, dark conference room was illuminated only by the glow of a videoscreen. In front of the screen, a very tall and lanky silhouette faced her.Though she couldn’t make out his face, she sensed power here.“Dr. Sinskey,” the man’s sharp voice declared. “Thank you for joining me.” Theman’s tautly precise accent suggested Elizabeth’s homeland of Switzerland, orperhaps Germany.“Please sit,” he said, motioning to a chair near the front of the room.No introductions? Elizabeth sat. The bizarre image being projected on the videoscreen did nothing to calm her nerves. What in the world?“I was at your presentation this morning,” declared the silhouette. “I came along distance to hear you speak. An impressive performance.”“Thank you,” she replied.“Might I also say you are much more beautiful than I imagined … despite your ageand your myopic view of world health.”Elizabeth felt her jaw drop. The comment was offensive in all kinds of ways.“Excuse me?” she demanded, peering into the darkness. “Who are you? And why haveyou called me here?”“Pardon my failed attempt at humor,” the lanky shadow replied. “The image on thescreen will explain why you’re here.”Sinskey eyed the horrific visual—a painting depicting a vast sea of humanity,throngs of sickly people, all climbing over one another in a dense tangle ofnaked bodies.“The great artist Doré,” the man announced. “His spectacularly griminterpretation of Dante Alighieri’s vision of hell. I hope it looks comfortableto you … because that’s where we’re headed.” He paused, drifting slowly towardher. “And let me tell you why.”He kept moving toward her, seeming to grow taller with every step. “If I were totake this piece of paper and tear it in two …” He paused at a table, picked up asheet of paper, and ripped it loudly in half. “And then if I were to place thetwo halves on top of each other …” He stacked the two halves. “And then if Iwere to repeat the process …” He again tore the papers, stacking them. “Iproduce a stack of paper that is now four times the thickness of the original,correct?” His eyes seemed to smolder in the darkness of the room.Elizabeth did not appreciate his condescending tone and aggressive posture. Shesaid nothing.“Hypothetically speaking,” he continued, moving closer still, “if the originalsheet of paper is a mere one-tenth of a millimeter thick, and I were to repeatthis process … say, fifty times … do you know how tall this stack would be?”Elizabeth bristled. “I do,” she replied with more hostility than she intended.“It would be one-tenth of a millimeter times two to the fiftieth power. It’scalled geometric progression. Might I ask what I’m doing here?”The man smirked and gave an impressed nod. “Yes, and can you guess what thatactual value might look like? One-tenth of a millimeter times two to thefiftieth power? Do you know how tall our stack of paper has become?” He pausedonly an instant. “Our stack of paper, after only fifty doublings, now reachesalmost all the way … to the sun.”Elizabeth was not surprised. The staggering power of geometric growth wassomething she dealt with all the time in her work. Circles of contamination …replication of infected cells … death-toll estimates. “I apologize if I seemnaive,” she said, making no effort to hide her annoyance. “But I’m missing yourpoint.”“My point?” He chuckled quietly. “My point is that the history of our humanpopulation growth is even more dramatic. The earth’s population, like our stackof paper, had very meager beginnings … but alarming potential.”He was pacing again. “Consider this. It took the earth’s population thousands ofyears—from the early dawn of man all the way to the early 1800s—to reach onebillion people. Then, astoundingly, it took only about a hundred years to doublethe population to two billion in the 1920s. After that, it took a mere fiftyyears for the population to double again to four billion in the 1970s. As youcan imagine, we’re well on track to reach eight billion very soon. Just today,the human race added another quarter-million people to planet Earth. A quartermillion. And this happens every day—rain or shine. Currently, every year, we’readding the equivalent of the entire country of Germany.”The tall man stopped short, hovering over Elizabeth. “How old are you?”Another offensive question, although as the head of the WHO, she was accustomedto handling antagonism with diplomacy. “Sixty-one.”“Did you know that if you live another nineteen years, until the age of eighty,you will witness the population triple in your lifetime. One lifetime—atripling. Think of the implications. As you know, your World Health Organizationhas again increased its forecasts, predicting there will be some nine billionpeople on earth before the midpoint of this century. Animal species are goingextinct at a precipitously accelerated rate. The demand for dwindling naturalresources is skyrocketing. Clean water is harder and harder to come by. By anybiological gauge, our species has exceeded our sustainable numbers. And in theface of this disaster, the World Health Organization—the gatekeeper of theplanet’s health—is investing in things like curing diabetes, filling bloodbanks, battling cancer.” He paused, staring directly at her. “And so I broughtyou here to ask you directly why the hell the World Health Organization does nothave the guts to deal with this issue head-on?”Elizabeth was seething now. “Whoever you are, you know damned well the WHO takesoverpopulation very seriously. Recently we spent millions of dollars sendingdoctors into Africa to deliver free condoms and educate people about birthcontrol.”“Ah, yes!” the lanky man derided. “And an even bigger army of Catholicmissionaries marched in on your heels and told the Africans that if they usedthe condoms, they’d all go to hell. Africa has a new environmental issuenow—landfills overflowing with unused condoms.”Elizabeth strained to hold her tongue. He was correct on this point, and yetmodern Catholics were starting to fight back against the Vatican’s meddling inreproductive issues. Most notably, Melinda Gates, a devout Catholic herself, hadbravely risked the wrath of her own church by pledging $560 million to helpimprove access to birth control around the world. Elizabeth Sinskey had gone onrecord many times saying that Bill and Melinda Gates deserved to be canonizedfor all they’d done through their foundation to improve world health. Sadly, theonly institution capable of conferring sainthood somehow failed to see theChristian nature of their efforts.“Dr. Sinskey,” the shadow continued. “What the World Health Organization failsto recognize is that there is only one global health issue.” He pointed again tothe grim image on the screen—a sea of tangled, cloying humanity. “And this isit.” He paused. “I realize you are a scientist, and therefore perhaps not astudent of the classics or the fine arts, so let me offer another image that mayspeak to you in a language you can better understand.”The room went dark for an instant, and the screen refreshed.The new image was one Elizabeth had seen many times … and it always brought aneerie sense of inevitability.image [../Images/00008.jpeg]A heavy silence settled in the room.“Yes,” the lanky man finally said. “Silent terror is an apt response to thisgraph. Seeing it is a bit like staring into the headlight of an oncominglocomotive.” Slowly, the man turned to Elizabeth and gave her a tight,condescending smile. “Any questions, Dr. Sinskey?”“Just one,” she fired back. “Did you bring me here to lecture me or insult me?”“Neither.” His voice turned eerily cajoling. “I brought you here to work withyou. I have no doubt you understand that overpopulation is a health issue. Butwhat I fear you don’t understand is that it will affect the very soul of man.Under the stress of overpopulation, those who have never considered stealingwill become thieves to feed their families. Those who have never consideredkilling will kill to provide for their young. All of Dante’s deadly sins—greed,gluttony, treachery, murder, and the rest—will begin percolating … rising up tothe surface of humanity, amplified by our evaporating comforts. We are facing abattle for the very soul of man.”“I’m a biologist. I save lives … not souls.”“Well, I can assure you that saving lives will become increasingly difficult inthe coming years. Overpopulation breeds far more than spiritual discontent.There is a passage in Machiavelli—”“Yes,” she interrupted, reciting her recollection of the famous quote. “ ‘Whenevery province of the world so teems with inhabitants that they can neithersubsist where they are nor remove themselves elsewhere … the world will purgeitself.’ ” She stared up at him. “All of us at the WHO are familiar with thatquotation.”“Good, then you know that Machiavelli went on to talk about plagues as theworld’s natural way of self-purging.”“Yes, and as I mentioned in my talk, we are well aware of the direct correlationbetween population density and the likelihood of wide-scale epidemics, but weare constantly devising new detection and treatment methods. The WHO remainsconfident that we can prevent future pandemics.”“That’s a pity.”Elizabeth stared in disbelief. “I beg your pardon?!”“Dr. Sinskey,” the man said with a strange laugh, “you talk about controllingepidemics as if it’s a good thing.”She gaped up at the man in mute disbelief.“There you have it,” the lanky man declared, sounding like an attorney restinghis case. “Here I stand with the head of the World Health Organization—the bestthe WHO has to offer. A terrifying thought if you consider it. I have shown youthis image of impending misery.” He refreshed the screen, again displaying theimage of the bodies. “I have reminded you of the awesome power of uncheckedpopulation growth.” He pointed to his small stack of paper. “I have enlightenedyou about the fact that we are on the brink of a spiritual collapse.” He pausedand turned directly toward her. “And your response? Free condoms in Africa.” Theman gave a derisive sneer. “This is like swinging a flyswatter at an incomingasteroid. The time bomb is no longer ticking. It has already gone off, andwithout drastic measures, exponential mathematics will become your new God … and‘He’ is a vengeful God. He will bring to you Dante’s vision of hell rightoutside on Park Avenue … huddled masses wallowing in their own excrement. Aglobal culling orchestrated by Nature herself.”“Is that so?” Elizabeth snapped. “So tell me, in your vision of a sustainablefuture, what is the ideal population of earth? What is the magic number at whichhumankind can hope to sustain itself indefinitely … and in relative comfort?”The tall man smiled, clearly appreciating the question. “Any environmentalbiologist or statistician will tell you that humankind’s best chance oflong-term survival occurs with a global population of around four billion.”“Four billion?” Elizabeth fired back. “We’re at seven billion now, so it’s alittle late for that.”The tall man’s green eyes flashed fire. “Is it?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23ROBERT LANGDON LANDED hard on the spongy earth just inside the retaining wall ofthe Boboli Gardens’ heavily wooded southern edge. Sienna landed beside him andstood up, brushing herself off and taking in their surroundings.They were standing in a glade of moss and ferns on the edge of a small forest.From here, the Palazzo Pitti was entirely obscured from view, and Langdon sensedthey were about as far from the palace as one could get in the gardens. At leastthere were no workers or tourists out this far at this early hour.Langdon gazed at a peastone pathway that wound gracefully downhill into theforest before them. At the point where the path disappeared into the trees, amarble statue had been perfectly situated to receive the eye. Langdon was notsurprised. The Boboli Gardens had enjoyed the exceptional design talents ofNiccolò Tribolo, Giorgio Vasari, and Bernardo Buontalenti—a brain trust ofaesthetic talent that had created on this 111-acre canvas a walkablemasterpiece.“If we head northeast, we’ll reach the palace,” Langdon said, pointing down thepath. “We can mix there with the tourists and exit unseen. I’m guessing it opensat nine.”Langdon glanced down to check the time but saw only his bare wrist where hisMickey Mouse watch had once been strapped. He wondered absently if it was stillat the hospital with the rest of his clothing and if he’d ever be able toretrieve it.Sienna planted her feet defiantly. “Robert, before we take another step, I wantto know where we’re going. What did you figure out back there? The Malebolge?You said it was out of sequence?”Langdon motioned toward a wooded area just ahead. “Let’s get out of sightfirst.” He led her down a pathway that curled into an enclosed hollow—a “room,”in the parlance of landscape architecture—where there were some faux-boisbenches and a small fountain. The air beneath the trees was decidedly colder.Langdon took the projector from his pocket and began shaking it. “Sienna,whoever created this digital image not only added letters to the sinners in theMalebolge, but he also changed the order of the sins.” He hopped up on thebench, towering over Sienna, and aimed the projector down at his feet.Botticelli’s Mappa dell’Inferno materialized faintly on the flat bench topbeside Sienna.Langdon motioned to the tiered area at the bottom of the funnel. “See theletters in the ten ditches of the Malebolge?”Sienna found them on the projection and read from top to bottom. “Catrovacer.”“Right. Meaningless.”“But then you realized the ten ditches had been shuffled around?”“Easier than that, actually. If these levels were a deck of ten cards, the deckwas not so much shuffled as simply cut once. After the cut, the cards remain inthe correct order, but they start with the wrong card.” Langdon pointed down atthe ten ditches of the Malebolge. “According to Dante’s text, our top levelshould be the seducers whipped by demons. And yet, in this version, the seducersappear … way down in the seventh ditch.”Sienna studied the now-fading image beside her and nodded. “Okay, I see that.The first ditch is now the seventh.”Langdon pocketed the projector and jumped back down onto the pathway. He grabbeda small stick and began scratching letters on a patch of dirt just off the path.“Here are the letters as they appear in our modified version of hell.”CATROVACER“Catrovacer,” Sienna read.“Yes. And here is where the ‘deck’ was cut.” Langdon now drew a line beneath theseventh letter and waited while Sienna studied his handiwork.CATROVA—CER“Okay,” she said quickly. “Catrova. Cer.”“Yes, and to put the cards back in order, we simply uncut the deck and place thebottom on top. The two halves swap places.”Sienna eyed the letters. “Cer. Catrova.” She shrugged, looking unimpressed.“Still meaningless …”“Cer catrova,” Langdon repeated. After a pause, he said the words again, elidingthem together. “Cercatrova.” Finally, he said them with a pause in the middle.“Cerca … trova.”Sienna gasped audibly and her eyes shot up to meet Langdon’s.“Yes,” Langdon said with a smile. “Cerca trova.”The two Italian words cerca and trova literally meant “seek” and “find.” Whencombined as a phrase—cerca trova—they were synonymous with the biblical aphorism“Seek and ye shall find.”“Your hallucinations!” Sienna exclaimed, breathless. “The woman with the veil!She kept telling you to seek and find!” She jumped to her feet. “Robert, do yourealize what this means? It means the words cerca trova were already in yoursubconscious! Don’t you see? You must have deciphered this phrase before youarrived at the hospital! You had probably seen this projector’s image already …but had forgotten!”She’s right, he realized, having been so fixated on the cipher itself that itnever occurred to him that he might have been through all of this already.“Robert, you said earlier that La Mappa points to a specific location in the oldcity. But I still don’t understand where.”“Cerca trova doesn’t ring any bells for you?”She shrugged.Langdon smiled inwardly. Finally, something Sienna doesn’t know. “As it turnsout, this phrase points very specifically to a famous mural that hangs in thePalazzo Vecchio—Giorgio Vasari’s Battaglia di Marciano in the Hall of the FiveHundred. Near the top of the painting, barely visible, Vasari painted the wordscerca trova in tiny letters. Plenty of theories exist as to why he did this, butno conclusive proof has ever been discovered.”The high-pitched whine of a small aircraft suddenly buzzed overhead, streakingin out of nowhere and skimming the wooded canopy just above them. The sound wasvery close, and Langdon and Sienna froze as the craft raced past.As the aircraft departed, Langdon peered up at it through the trees. “Toyhelicopter,” he said, exhaling as he watched the three-foot-long,radio-controlled chopper banking in the distance. It sounded like a giant, angrymosquito.Sienna, however, still looked wary. “Stay down.”Sure enough, the little chopper banked fully and was now coming back their way,skimming the treetops, sailing past them again, this time off to their leftabove another glade.“That’s not a toy,” she whispered. “It’s a reconnaissance drone. Probably has avideo camera on board sending live images back to … somebody.”Langdon’s jaw tightened as he watched the chopper streak off in the directionfrom which it had appeared—the Porta Romana and the Art Institute.“I don’t know what you did,” Sienna said, “but some powerful people are clearlyvery eager to find you.”The helicopter banked yet again and began a slow pass along the perimeter wallthey had just jumped.“Someone at the Art Institute must have seen us and said something,” Siennasaid, heading down the path. “We’ve got to get out of here. Now.”As the drone buzzed away toward the far end of the gardens, Langdon used hisfoot to erase the letters he’d written on the pathway and then hurried afterSienna. His mind swirled with thoughts of cerca trova, the Giorgio Vasari mural,as well as with Sienna’s revelation that Langdon must have already decipheredthe projector’s message. Seek and ye shall find.Suddenly, just as they entered a second glade, a startling thought hit Langdon.He skidded to a stop on the wooded path, a bemused look on his face.Sienna stopped, too. “Robert? What is it?!”“I’m innocent,” he declared.“What are you talking about?”“The people chasing me … I assumed it was because I had done somethingterrible.”“Yes, at the hospital you kept repeating ‘very sorry.’ ”“I know. But I thought I was speaking English.”Sienna looked at him with surprise. “You were speaking English!”Langdon’s blue eyes were now filled with excitement. “Sienna, when I kept saying‘very sorry,’ I wasn’t apologizing. I was mumbling about the secret message inthe mural at Palazzo Vecchio!” He could still hear the recording of his owndelirious voice. Ve … sorry. Ve … sorry.Sienna looked lost.“Don’t you see?!” Langdon was grinning now. “I wasn’t saying ‘very sorry, verysorry.’ I was saying the artist’s name—Va … sari, Vasari!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24VAYENTHA HIT THE brakes hard.Her motorcycle fishtailed, screeching loudly as it left a long skid mark on theViale del Poggio Imperiale, finally coming to an abrupt stop behind anunexpected line of traffic. The Viale del Poggio was at a standstill.I don’t have time for this!Vayentha craned her neck over the cars, trying to see what was causing theholdup. She had already been forced to drive in a wide circle to avoid the SRSteam and all the chaos at the apartment building, and now she needed to get intothe old city to clear out of the hotel room where she had been stationed for thelast few days of this mission.I’ve been disavowed—I need to get the hell out of town!Her string of bad luck, however, seemed to be continuing. The route she hadselected into the old city appeared to be blocked. In no mood to wait, Vayentharevved the bike off to one side of the traffic and sped along the narrowbreakdown lane until she could see the snarled intersection. Up ahead was aclogged rotary where six major thoroughfares converged. This was the PortaRomana—one of Florence’s most trafficked intersections—the gateway to the oldcity.What the hell is going on here?!Vayentha now saw that the entire area was swarming with police—a roadblock orcheckpoint of some sort. Moments later, she spotted something at the center ofthe action that left her baffled—a familiar black van around which severalblack-clad agents were calling out orders to the local authorities.These men, without a doubt, were members of the SRS team, and yet Vayentha couldnot imagine what they were doing here.Unless …Vayentha swallowed hard, scarcely daring to imagine the possibility. Has Langdoneluded Brüder as well? It seemed unthinkable; the chances of escape had beennear zero. Then again, Langdon was not working alone, and Vayentha hadexperienced firsthand how resourceful the blond woman could be.Nearby, a police officer appeared, walking from car to car, showing a photo of ahandsome man with thick brown hair. Vayentha instantly recognized the photo as apress shot of Robert Langdon. Her heart soared.Brüder missed him …Langdon is still in play!An experienced strategist, Vayentha immediately began assessing how thisdevelopment changed her situation.Option one—flee as required.Vayentha had blown a critical job for the provost and had been disavowed becauseof it. If she were lucky, she would face a formal inquiry and probable careertermination. If, however, she were unlucky and had underestimated the severityof her employer, she might spend the rest of her life looking over her shoulderand wondering if the Consortium was lurking just out of sight.There is a second option now.Complete your mission.Staying on task was in direct opposition to her disavowal protocol, and yet withLangdon still on the run, Vayentha now had the opportunity to continue with heroriginal directive.If Brüder fails to catch Langdon, she thought, her pulse quickening. And if Isucceed …Vayentha knew it was a long shot, but if Langdon managed to elude Brüderentirely, and if Vayentha could still step in and finish the job, she wouldsingle-handedly have saved the day for the Consortium, and the provost wouldhave no choice but to be lenient.I’ll keep my job, she thought. Probably even be promoted.In a flash, Vayentha realized that her entire future now revolved around asingle critical undertaking. I must locate Langdon … before Brüder does.It would not be easy. Brüder had at his disposal endless manpower as well as avast array of advanced surveillance technologies. Vayentha was working alone.She did, however, possess one piece of information that Brüder, the provost, andthe police did not have.I have a very good idea where Langdon will go.Revving the throttle on her BMW, she spun it 180 degrees around and headed backthe way she came. Ponte alle Grazie, she thought, picturing the bridge to thenorth. There existed more than one route into the old city."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25NOT AN APOLOGY, Langdon mused. An artist’s name.“Vasari,” Sienna stammered, taking a full step backward on the path. “The artistwho hid the words cerca trova in his mural.”Langdon couldn’t help but smile. Vasari. Vasari. In addition to shedding a rayof light on his strange predicament, this revelation also meant Langdon was nolonger wondering what terrible thing he might have done … for which he had beenprofusely saying he was very sorry.“Robert, you clearly had seen this Botticelli image on the projector before youwere injured, and you knew it contained a code that pointed to Vasari’s mural.That’s why you woke up and kept repeating Vasari’s name!”Langdon tried to calculate what all of this meant. Giorgio Vasari—asixteenth-century artist, architect, and writer—was a man Langdon often referredto as “the world’s first art historian.” Despite the hundreds of paintingsVasari created, and the dozens of buildings he designed, his most enduringlegacy was his seminal book, Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors,and Architects, a collection of biographies of Italian artists, which to thisday remains requisite reading for students of art history.The words cerca trova had placed Vasari back in the mainstream consciousnessabout thirty years ago when his “secret message” was discovered high on hissprawling mural in the Palazzo Vecchio’s Hall of the Five Hundred. The tinyletters appeared on a green battle flag, barely visible among the chaos of thewar scene. While consensus had yet to be reached as to why Vasari added thisstrange message to his mural, the leading theory was that it was a clue tofuture generations of the existence of a lost Leonardo da Vinci fresco hidden ina three-centimeter gap behind that wall.Sienna was glancing nervously up through the trees. “There’s still one thing Idon’t understand. If you weren’t saying ‘very sorry, very sorry’ … then why arepeople trying to kill you?”Langdon had been wondering the same thing.The distant buzz of the surveillance drone was getting louder again, and Langdonknew the time had come for a decision. He failed to see how Vasari’s Battagliadi Marciano could possibly relate to Dante’s Inferno, or the gunshot wound hehad suffered the night before, and yet he finally saw a tangible path beforehim.Cerca trova.Seek and find.Again Langdon saw the silver-haired woman calling out to him from across theriver. Time is running out! If there were answers, Langdon sensed, they would beat the Palazzo Vecchio.He now flashed on an old adage from early Grecian free divers who huntedlobsters in the coral caves of the Aegean Islands. When swimming into a darktunnel, there arrives a point of no return when you no longer have enough breathto double back. Your only choice is to swim forward into the unknown … and prayfor an exit.Langdon wondered if they had reached that point.He eyed the maze of garden pathways before them. If he and Sienna could reachthe Pitti Palace and exit the gardens, then the old city was just a short walkacross the most famous footbridge in the world—the Ponte Vecchio. It was alwayscrowded and would provide good cover. From there, the Palazzo Vecchio was only afew blocks away.The drone hummed closer now, and Langdon felt momentarily overwhelmed byexhaustion. The realization that he had not been saying “very sorry” left himfeeling conflicted about running from the police.“Eventually, they’re going to catch me, Sienna,” Langdon said. “It might bebetter for me to stop running.”Sienna looked at him with alarm. “Robert, every time you stop, someone startsshooting at you! You need to figure out what you’re involved in. You need tolook at that Vasari mural and hope it jars your memory. Maybe it will help youlearn where this projector came from and why you’re carrying it.”Langdon pictured the spike-haired woman coldly killing Dr. Marconi … thesoldiers firing on them … the Italian military police gathering in the PortaRomana … and now a surveillance drone tracking them through the Boboli Gardens.He fell silent, rubbing his tired eyes as he considered his options.“Robert?” Sienna’s voice rose. “There’s one other thing … something that didn’tseem important, but now seems like it might be.”Langdon raised his eyes, reacting to the gravity in her tone.“I intended to tell you at the apartment,” she said, “but …”“What is it?”Sienna pursed her lips, looking uncomfortable. “When you arrived at thehospital, you were delirious and trying to communicate.”“Yes,” Langdon said, “mumbling ‘Vasari, Vasari.’ ”“Yes, but before that … before we got out the recorder, in the first momentsafter you arrived, you said one other thing I remember. You only said it once,but I’m positive I understood.”“What did I say?”Sienna glanced up toward the drone and then back at Langdon. “You said, ‘I holdthe key to finding it … if I fail, then all is death.’ ”Langdon could only stare.Sienna continued. “I thought you were referring to the object in your jacketpocket, but now I’m not so sure.”If I fail, then all is death? The words hit Langdon hard. The haunting images ofdeath flickered before him … Dante’s inferno, the biohazard symbol, the plaguedoctor. Yet again, the face of the beautiful silver-haired woman pleaded withhim across the bloodred river. Seek and find! Time is running out!Sienna’s voice pulled him back. “Whatever this projector ultimately points to …or whatever you’re trying to find, it must be something extremely dangerous. Thefact that people are trying to kill us …” Her voice cracked slightly, and shetook a moment to regroup. “Think about it. They just shot at you in broaddaylight … shot at me—an innocent bystander. Nobody seems to be looking tonegotiate. Your own government turned on you … you called them for help, andthey sent someone to kill you.”Langdon stared vacantly at the ground. Whether the U.S. Consulate had sharedLangdon’s location with the assassin, or whether the consulate itself had sentthe assassin, was irrelevant. The upshot was the same. My own government is noton my side.Langdon looked into Sienna’s brown eyes and saw bravery there. What have Igotten her involved in? “I wish I knew what we were looking for. That would helpput all of this into perspective.”Sienna nodded. “Whatever it is, I think we need to find it. At least it wouldgive us leverage.”Her logic was hard to refute. Still Langdon felt something nagging at him. If Ifail, then all is death. All morning he’d been running up against macabresymbols of biohazards, plagues, and Dante’s hell. Admittedly, he had no clearproof of what he was looking for, but he would be naive not to consider at leastthe possibility that this situation involved a deadly disease or large-scalebiological threat. But if this were true, why would his own government be tryingto eliminate him?Do they think I’m somehow involved in a potential attack?It made no sense at all. There was something else going on here.Langdon thought again of the silver-haired woman. “There’s also the woman frommy visions. I feel I need to find her.”“Then trust your feelings,” Sienna said. “In your condition, the best compassyou have is your subconscious mind. It’s basic psychology—if your gut is tellingyou to trust that woman, then I think you should do exactly what she keepstelling you to do.”“Seek and find,” they said in unison.Langdon exhaled, knowing his path was clear.All I can do is keep swimming down this tunnel.With hardening resolve, he turned and began taking in his surroundings, tryingto get his bearings. Which way out of the gardens?They were standing beneath the trees at the edge of a wide-open plaza whereseveral paths intersected. In the distance to their left, Langdon spied anelliptical-shaped lagoon with a small island adorned with lemon trees andstatuary. The Isolotto, he thought, recognizing the famous sculpture of Perseuson a half-submerged horse bounding through the water.“The Pitti Palace is that way,” Langdon said, pointing east, away from theIsolotto, toward the garden’s main thoroughfare—the Viottolone, which raneast–west along the entire length of the grounds. The Viottolone was as wide asa two-lane road and lined by a row of slender, four-hundred-year-old cypresstrees.“There’s no cover,” Sienna said, eyeing the uncamouflaged avenue and motioningup at the circling drone.“You’re right,” Langdon said with a lopsided grin. “Which is why we’re takingthe tunnel beside it.”He pointed again, this time to a dense hedgerow adjacent to the mouth of theViottolone. The wall of dense greenery had a small arched opening cut into it.Beyond the opening, a slender footpath stretched out into the distance—a tunnelrunning parallel with the Viottolone. It was enclosed on either side by aphalanx of pruned holm oaks, which had been carefully trained since the 1600s toarch inward over the path, intertwining overhead and providing an awning offoliage. The pathway’s name, La Cerchiata—literally “circular” or“hooped”—derived from its canopy of curved trees resembling barrel stays orcerchi.Sienna hurried over to the opening and peered into the shaded channel.Immediately she turned back to him with a smile. “Better.”Wasting no time, she slipped through the opening and hurried off among thetrees.Langdon had always considered La Cerchiata one of Florence’s most peacefulspots. Today, however, as he watched Sienna disappear down the darkened allée,he thought again of the Grecian free divers swimming into corral tunnels andpraying they’d reach an exit.Langdon quickly said his own little prayer and hurried after her.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]A half mile behind them, outside the Art Institute, Agent Brüder strode througha bustle of police and students, his icy gaze parting the crowds before him. Hemade his way to the makeshift command post that his surveillance specialist hadset up on the hood of his black van.“From the aerial drone,” the specialist said, handing Brüder a tablet screen.“Taken a few minutes ago.”Brüder examined the video stills, pausing on a blurry enlargement of two faces—adark-haired man and a blond ponytailed woman—both huddled in the shadows andpeering skyward through a canopy of trees.Robert Langdon.Sienna Brooks.Zero doubt.Brüder turned his attention to the map of the Boboli Gardens, which was spreadout on the hood. They made a poor choice, he thought, eyeing the garden layout.While it was sprawling and intricate, with plenty of hiding places, the gardensalso appeared to be surrounded on all sides by high walls. The Boboli Gardenswere the closest thing to a natural killbox that Brüder had ever seen in thefield.They’ll never get out.“Local authorities are sealing all exits,” the agent said. “And commencing asweep.”“Keep me informed,” Brüder said.Slowly, he raised his eyes to the van’s thick polycarbonate window, beyond whichhe could see the silver-haired woman seated in the back of the vehicle.The drugs they had given her had definitely dulled her senses—more than Brüderhad imagined. Nonetheless, he could tell by the fearful look in her eyes thatshe still had a firm grasp on precisely what was going on.She does not look happy, Brüder thought. Then again, why would she?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26A SPIRE OF water shot twenty feet in the air.Langdon watched it fall gently back to earth and knew they were getting close.They had reached the end of La Cerchiata’s leafy tunnel and dashed across anopen lawn into a grove of cork trees. Now they were looking out at the Boboli’smost famous spouting fountain—Stoldo Lorenzi’s bronze of Neptune clutching histhree-pronged trident. Irreverently known by locals as “The Fountain of theFork,” this water feature was considered the central point of the gardens.Sienna stopped at the edge of the grove and peered upward through the trees. “Idon’t see the drone.”Langdon no longer heard it either, and yet the fountain was quite loud.“Must have needed to refuel,” Sienna said. “This is our chance. Which way?”Langdon led her to the left, and they began descending a steep incline. As theyemerged from the trees, the Pitti Palace came into view.“Nice little house,” Sienna whispered.“Typical Medici understatement,” he replied wryly.Still almost a quarter mile away, the Pitti Palace’s stone facade dominated thelandscape, stretching out to their left and right. Its exterior of bulging,rusticated stonework lent the building an air of unyielding authority that wasfurther accentuated by a powerful repetition of shuttered windows andarch-topped apertures. Traditionally, formal palaces were situated on highground so that anyone in the gardens had to look uphill at the building. ThePitti Palace, however, was situated in a low valley near the Arno River, meaningthat people in the Boboli Gardens looked downhill at the palace.This effect was only more dramatic. One architect had described the palace asappearing to have been built by nature herself … as if the massive stones in alandslide had tumbled down the long escarpment and landed in an elegant,barricade-like pile at the bottom. Despite its less defensible position in thelow ground, the solid stone structure of the Pitti Palace was so imposing thatNapoleon had once used it as a power base while in Florence.“Look,” Sienna said, pointing to the nearest doors of the palace. “Good news.”Langdon had seen it, too. On this strange morning, the most welcome sight wasnot the palace itself, but the tourists streaming out of the building into thelower gardens. The palace was open, which meant that Langdon and Sienna wouldhave no trouble slipping inside and passing through the building to escape thegardens. Once outside the palace, Langdon knew they would see the Arno River totheir right, and beyond that, the spires of the old city.He and Sienna kept moving, half jogging now down the steep embankment. As theydescended, they traversed the Boboli Amphitheater—the site of the very firstopera performance in history—which lay nestled like a horseshoe on the side of ahill. Beyond that, they passed the obelisk of Ramses II and the unfortunatepiece of “art” that was positioned at its base. The guidebooks referred to thepiece as “a colossal stone basin from Rome’s Baths of Caracalla,” but Langdonalways saw it for what it truly was—the world’s largest bathtub. They reallyneed to put that thing somewhere else.They finally reached the rear of the palace and slowed to a calm walk, mixinginconspicuously with the first tourists of the day. Moving against the tide,they descended a narrow tunnel into the cortile, an inner courtyard wherevisitors were seated enjoying a morning espresso in the palace’s makeshift café.The smell of fresh-ground coffee filled the air, and Langdon felt a suddenlonging to sit down and enjoy a civilized breakfast. Today’s not the day, hethought as they pressed on, entering the wide stone passageway that led towardthe palace’s main doors.As they neared the doorway, Langdon and Sienna collided with a growingbottleneck of stalled tourists who seemed to be assembling in the portico toobserve something outside. Langdon peered through the crowd to the area in frontof the palace.The Pitti’s grand entrance was as blunt and unwelcoming as he recalled it.Rather than a manicured lawn and landscaping, the front yard was a vast expanseof pavement that stretched across an entire hillside, flowing down to the Viadei Guicciardini like a massive paved ski slope.At the bottom of the hill, Langdon now saw the reason for the crowd ofonlookers.Down in Piazza dei Pitti, a half-dozen police cars had streamed in from alldirections. A small army of officers were advancing up the hill, unholsteringtheir weapons and fanning out to secure the front of the palace."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27AS THE POLICE entered the Pitti Palace, Sienna and Langdon were already on themove, retracing their steps through the interior of the palace and away from thearriving police. They hurried through the cortile and past the café, where abuzz was spreading, tourists rubbernecking in an attempt to locate the source ofthe commotion.Sienna was amazed the authorities had found them so quickly. The drone must havedisappeared because it had already spotted us.She and Langdon found the same narrow tunnel through which they had descendedfrom the gardens and without hesitation plunged back into the passageway andbounded up the stairs. The end of the staircase banked left along a highretaining wall. As they dashed along the wall, it grew shorter beside them,until finally they could see over it into the vast expanse of the BoboliGardens.Langdon instantly grabbed Sienna’s arm and yanked her backward, ducking out ofsight behind the retaining wall. Sienna had seen it, too.Three hundred yards away, on the slope above the amphitheater, a phalanx ofpolice descended, searching groves, interviewing tourists, coordinating with oneanother on handheld radios.We’re trapped!Sienna had never imagined, when she and Robert Langdon first met, that it wouldlead to this. This is more than I bargained for. When Sienna had left thehospital with Langdon, she thought they were fleeing a woman with spiked hairand a gun. Now they were running from an entire military team and the Italianauthorities. Their chances of escape, she was now realizing, were almost zero.“Is there any other way out?” Sienna demanded, short of breath.“I don’t think so,” Langdon said. “This garden is a walled city, just like …” Hepaused suddenly, turning and looking east. “Just like … the Vatican.” A strangeglint of hope flickered across his face.Sienna had no idea what the Vatican had to do with their current predicament,but Langdon suddenly began nodding, gazing east along the back of the palace.“It’s a long shot,” he said, hustling her along with him now. “But there mightbe a different way to get out of here.”Two figures materialized suddenly before them, having rounded the corner of theretaining wall, nearly bumping into Sienna and Langdon. Both figures werewearing black, and for one frightening instant, Sienna thought they were thesoldiers she had encountered at the apartment building. As they passed, though,she saw they were only tourists—Italian, she guessed, from all the stylish blackleather.Having an idea, Sienna caught one of the tourists’ arms and smiled up at him aswarmly as possible. “Può dirci dov’è la Galleria del costume?” she asked inrapid Italian, requesting directions to the palace’s famed costume gallery. “Ioe mio fratello siamo in ritardo per una visita privata.” My brother and I arelate for a private tour.“Certo!” The man grinned at them both, looking eager to help. “Proseguite drittoper il sentiero!” He turned and pointed west, along the retaining wall, directlyaway from whatever Langdon had been looking at.“Molte grazie!” Sienna chirped with another smile as the two men headed off.Langdon gave Sienna an impressed nod, apparently understanding her motives. Ifthe police began questioning tourists, they might hear that Langdon and Siennawere headed for the costume gallery, which, according to the map on the wallbefore them, was at the far western end of the palace … as far as possible fromthe direction in which they were now headed.“We need to get to that path over there,” Langdon said, motioning across an openplaza toward a walkway that ran down another hill, away from the palace. Thepeastone walkway was sheltered on the uphill side by massive hedges, providingplenty of cover from the authorities now descending the hill, only a hundredyards away.Sienna calculated that their chances of getting across the open area to thesheltered path were very slim. Tourists were gathering there, watching thepolice with curiosity. The faint thrum of the drone became audible again,approaching in the distance.“Now or never,” Langdon said, grabbing her hand and pulling her with him outinto the open plaza, where they began winding through the crowd of gatheringtourists. Sienna fought the urge to break into a run, but Langdon held firmly onto her, walking briskly but calmly through the throng.When they finally reached the opening to the pathway, Sienna glanced back overher shoulder to see if they had been detected. The only police officers in sightwere all facing the other way, their eyes turned skyward toward the sound of theincoming drone.She faced front and hurried with Langdon down the path.Before them now, the skyline of old Florence poked above the trees, visibledirectly ahead in the distance. She saw the red-tiled cupola of the Duomo andthe green, red, and white spire of Giotto’s bell tower. For an instant, shecould also make out the crenellated spire of the Palazzo Vecchio—their seeminglyimpossible destination—but as they descended the pathway, the high perimeterwalls blotted out the view, engulfing them again.By the time they reached the bottom of the hill, Sienna was out of breath andwondering if Langdon had any idea where they were going. The path led directlyinto a maze garden, but Langdon confidently turned left into a wide gravelpatio, which he skirted, staying behind a hedge in the shadows of theoverhanging trees. The patio was deserted, more of an employee parking lot thana tourist area.“Where are we going?!” Sienna finally asked, breathless.“Almost there.”Almost where? The entire patio was enclosed by walls that were at least threestories tall. The only exit Sienna saw was a vehicle gateway on the left, whichwas sealed by a massive wrought-iron grate that looked like it dated back to theoriginal palace in the days of marauding armies. Beyond the barricade, she couldsee police gathered in the Piazza dei Pitti.Staying along the perimeter vegetation, Langdon pushed onward, heading directlyfor the wall in front of them. Sienna scanned the sheer face for any opendoorway, but all she saw was a niche containing what had to be the most hideousstatue she had ever seen.Good God, the Medici could afford any artwork on earth, and they chose this?The statue before them depicted an obese, naked dwarf straddling a giant turtle.The dwarf’s testicles were squashed against the turtle’s shell, and the turtle’smouth was dribbling water, as if he were ill.“I know,” Langdon said, without breaking stride. “That’s Braccio di Bartolo—afamous court dwarf. If you ask me, they should put him out back in the giantbathtub.”Langdon turned sharply to his right, heading down a set of stairs that Siennahad been unable to see until now.A way out?!The flash of hope was short-lived.As she turned the corner and headed down the stairs behind Langdon, she realizedthey were dashing into a dead end—a cul-de-sac whose walls were twice as high asthe others.Furthermore, Sienna now sensed that their long journey was about to terminate atthe mouth of a gaping cavern … a deep grotto carved out of the rear wall. Thiscan’t be where he’s taking us!Over the cave’s yawning entrance, daggerlike stalactites loomed portentously. Inthe cavity beyond, oozing geological features twisted and dripped down the wallsas if the stone were melting … morphing into shapes that included, to Sienna’salarm, half-buried humanoids extruding from the walls as if being consumed bythe stone. The entire vision reminded Sienna of something out of Botticelli’sMappa dell’Inferno.Langdon, for some reason, seemed unfazed, and continued running directly towardthe cave’s entrance. He’d made a comment earlier about Vatican City, but Siennawas fairly certain there were no freakish caverns inside the walls of the HolySee.As they drew nearer, Sienna’s eyes moved to the sprawling entablature above theentrance—a ghostly compilation of stalactites and nebulous stone extrusions thatseemed to be engulfing two reclining women, who were flanked by a shieldembedded with six balls, or palle, the famed crest of the Medici.Langdon suddenly cut to his left, away from the entrance and toward a featureSienna had previously missed—a small gray door to the left of the cavern.Weathered and wooden, it appeared of little significance, like a storage closetor room for landscaping supplies.Langdon rushed to the door, clearly hoping he could open it, but the door had nohandle—only a brass keyhole—and, apparently, could be opened only from within.“Damn it!” Langdon’s eyes now shone with concern, his earlier hopefulness allbut erased. “I had hoped—”Without warning, the piercing whine of the drone echoed loudly off the highwalls around them. Sienna turned to see the drone rising up over the palace andclawing its way in their direction.Langdon clearly saw it, too, because he grabbed Sienna’s hand and dashed towardthe cavern. They ducked out of sight in the nick of time beneath the grotto’sstalactite overhang.A fitting end, she thought. Dashing through the gates of hell."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28A QUARTER MILE to the east, Vayentha parked her motorcycle. She had crossed intothe old city via the Ponte alle Grazie and then circled around to the PonteVecchio—the famed pedestrian bridge connecting the Pitti Palace to the old city.After locking her helmet to the bike, she strode out onto the bridge and mixedwith the early-morning tourists.A cool March breeze blew steadily up the river, ruffling Vayentha’s short spikedhair, reminding her that Langdon knew what she looked like. She paused at thestall of one of the bridge’s many vendors and bought an AMO FIRENZE baseballcap, pulling it low over her face.She smoothed her leather suit over the bulge of her handgun and took up aposition near the center of the bridge, casually leaning against a pillar andfacing the Pitti Palace. From here she was able to survey all the pedestrianscrossing the Arno into the heart of Florence.Langdon is on foot, she told herself. If he finds a way around the Porta Romana,this bridge is his most logical route into the old city.To the west, in the direction of the Pitti Palace, she could hear sirens andwondered if this was good or bad news. Are they still looking for him? Or havethey caught him? As Vayentha strained her ears for some indication as to whatwas going on, a new sound suddenly became audible—a high-pitched whine somewhereoverhead. Her eyes turned instinctively skyward, and she spotted it at once—asmall remote-controlled helicopter rising fast over the palace and swooping downover the treetops in the direction of the northeast corner of the BoboliGardens.A surveillance drone, Vayentha thought with a surge of hope. If it’s in the air,Brüder has yet to find Langdon.The drone was approaching fast. Apparently it was surveying the northeast cornerof the gardens, the area closest to Ponte Vecchio and Vayentha’s position, whichgave her additional encouragement.If Langdon eluded Brüder, he would definitely be moving in this direction.As Vayentha watched, however, the drone suddenly dive-bombed out of sight behindthe high stone wall. She could hear it hovering in place somewhere below thetree line … apparently having located something of interest."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29SEEK AND YE shall find, Langdon thought, huddled in the dim grotto with Sienna.We sought an exit … and found a dead end.The amorphous fountain in the center of the cave offered good cover, and yet asLangdon peered out from behind it, he sensed it was too late.The drone had just swooped down into the walled cul-de-sac, stopping abruptlyoutside the cavern, where it now hovered at a standstill, only ten feet off theground, facing the grotto, buzzing intensely like some kind of infuriated insect… awaiting its prey.Langdon pulled back and whispered the grim news to Sienna. “I think it knowswe’re here.”The drone’s high-pitched whine was nearly deafening inside the cavern, the noisereflecting sharply off the stone walls. Langdon found it hard to believe theywere being held hostage by a miniature mechanical helicopter, and yet he knewthat trying to run from it was fruitless. So what do we do now? Just wait? Hisoriginal plan to access what lay behind the little gray door had been areasonable one, except he hadn’t realized the door was openable only fromwithin.As Langdon’s eyes adjusted to the grotto’s dark interior, he surveyed theirunusual surroundings, wondering if there was any other exit. He saw nothingpromising. The interior of the cavern was adorned with sculpted animals andhumans, all in various stages of consumption by the strange oozing walls.Dejected, Langdon raised his eyes to the ceiling of stalactites hangingominously overhead.A good place to die.The Buontalenti Grotto—so named for its architect, Bernardo Buontalenti—wasarguably the most curious-looking space in all of Florence. Intended as a kindof fun house for young guests at the Pitti Palace, the three-chambered suite ofcaverns was decorated in a blend of naturalistic fantasy and Gothic excess,composed of what appeared to be dripping concretions and flowing pumice thatseemed either to be consuming or exuding the multitude of carved figures. In thedays of the Medici, the grotto was accented by having water flow down theinterior walls, which served both to cool the space during the hot Tuscansummers and to create the effect of an actual cavern.Langdon and Sienna were hidden in the first and largest chamber behind anindistinct central fountain. They were surrounded by colorful figures ofshepherds, peasants, musicians, animals, and even copies of Michelangelo’s fourprisoners, all of which seemed to be struggling to break free of thefluid-looking rock that engulfed them. High above, the morning light filtereddown through an oculus in the ceiling, which had once held a giant glass ballfilled with water in which bright red carp swam in the sunlight.Langdon wondered how the original Renaissance visitors here would have reactedat the sight of a real-life helicopter—a fantastical dream of Italy’s ownLeonardo da Vinci—hovering outside the grotto.It was at that moment that the drone’s shrill whine stopped. It hadn’t fadedaway; rather, it had just … abruptly stopped.Puzzled, Langdon peered out from behind the fountain and saw that the drone hadlanded. It was now sitting idle on the gravel plaza, looking much less ominous,especially because the stingerlike video lens on the front was facing away fromthem, off to one side, in the direction of the little gray door.Langdon’s sense of relief was fleeting. A hundred yards behind the drone, nearthe statue of the dwarf and turtle, three heavily armed soldiers were nowstriding purposefully down the stairs, heading directly toward the grotto.The soldiers were dressed in familiar black uniforms with green medallions ontheir shoulders. Their muscular lead man had vacant eyes that reminded Langdonof the plague mask in his visions.I am death.Langdon did not see their van or the mysterious silver-haired woman anywhere.I am life.As the soldiers approached, one of them stopped at the bottom of the stairs andturned around, facing backward, apparently to prevent anyone else fromdescending into this area. The other two kept coming toward the grotto.Langdon and Sienna sprang into motion again—although probably only delaying theinevitable—shuffling backward on all fours into the second cavern, which wassmaller, deeper, and darker. It, too, was dominated by a central piece of art—inthis case, a statue of two intertwined lovers—behind which Langdon and Siennanow hid anew.Veiled in shadow, Langdon carefully peered out around the base of the statue andwatched their approaching assailants. As the two soldiers reached the drone, onestopped and crouched down to tend to it, picking it up and examining the camera.Did the device spot us? Langdon wondered, fearing he knew the answer.The third and last soldier, the muscular one with the cold eyes, was stillmoving with icy focus in Langdon’s direction. The man approached until he wasnearly at the mouth of the cave. He’s coming in. Langdon prepared to pull backbehind the statue and tell Sienna it was over, but in that instant, he witnessedsomething unexpected.The soldier, rather than entering the grotto, suddenly peeled off to the leftand disappeared.Where is he going?! He doesn’t know we’re here?A few moments later, Langdon heard pounding—a fist knocking on wood.The little gray door, Langdon thought. He must know where it leads.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Pitti Palace security guard Ernesto Russo had always wanted to play Europeanfootball, but at twenty-nine years old and overweight, he had finally begun toaccept that his childhood dream would never come true. For the past three years,Ernesto had worked as a guard here at the Pitti Palace, always in the samecloset-size office, always with the same dull job.Ernesto was no stranger to curious tourists knocking on the little gray dooroutside the office in which he was stationed, and he usually just ignored themuntil they stopped. Today, however, the banging was intense and continuous.Annoyed, he refocused on his television set, which was loudly playing a footballrerun—Fiorentina versus Juventus. The knocking only grew louder. Finally,cursing the tourists, he marched out of his office down the narrow corridortoward the sound. Halfway there, he stopped at the massive steel grate thatremained sealed across this hallway except at a few specific hours.He entered the combination on the padlock and unlocked the grate, pulling it toone side. After stepping through, he followed protocol and relocked the gratebehind him. Then he walked to the gray wooden door.“È chiuso!” he yelled through the door, hoping the person outside would hear.“Non si può entrare!”The banging continued.Ernesto gritted his teeth. New Yorkers, he wagered. They want what they want.The only reason their Red Bulls soccer team was having any success on the worldstage was that they’d pilfered one of Europe’s best coaches.The banging continued, and Ernesto reluctantly unlocked the door and pushed itopen a few inches. “È chiuso!”The banging finally stopped, and Ernesto found himself face-to-face with asoldier whose eyes were so cold they literally made Ernesto step back. The manheld up an official carnet bearing an acronym Ernesto did not recognize.“Cosa succede?!” Ernesto demanded, alarmed. What’s going on?!Behind the soldier, a second was crouched down, tinkering with what appeared tobe a toy helicopter. Still farther away, another soldier stood guard on thestaircase. Ernesto heard police sirens nearby.“Do you speak English?” The soldier’s accent was definitely not New York. Europesomewhere?Ernesto nodded. “A bit, yes.”“Has anyone come through this door this morning?”“No, signore. Nessuno.”“Excellent. Keep it locked. Nobody in or out. Is that clear?”Ernesto shrugged. That was his job anyway. “Sì, I understand. Non deve entrare,né uscire nessuno.”“Tell me, please, is this door the sole entrance?”Ernesto considered the question. Technically, nowadays this door was consideredan exit, which was why it had no handle on the outside, but he understood whatthe man was asking. “Yes, l’accesso is this door only. No other way.” Theoriginal entrance inside the palace had been sealed for many years.“And are there any other hidden exits from the Boboli Gardens? Other than thetraditional gates?”“No, signore. Big walls everywhere. This only secret exit.”The soldier nodded. “Thank you for your help.” He motioned for Ernesto to closeand lock the door.Puzzled, Ernesto obeyed. Then he headed back up the corridor, unlocked the steelgrate, moved through it, relocked it behind him, and returned to his footballmatch."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30LANGDON AND SIENNA had seized an opportunity.While the muscular soldier was pounding on the door, they had crawled deeperinto the grotto and were now huddled in the final chamber. The tiny space wasadorned with rough-hewn mosaics and satyrs. At its center stood a life-sizesculpture of a Bathing Venus, who, fittingly, seemed to be glancing nervouslyover her shoulder.Langdon and Sienna had ensconced themselves on the far side of the statue’snarrow plinth, where they now waited, staring back at the single globularstalagmite that climbed the deepest wall of the grotto.“All exits confirmed secure!” shouted a soldier somewhere outside. He wasspeaking English with a faint accent that Langdon couldn’t place. “Send thedrone back up. I’ll check this cave here.”Langdon could feel Sienna’s body tighten beside him.Seconds later, heavy boots were padding into the grotto. The footsteps advancedquickly through the first chamber, growing louder still as they entered thesecond chamber, coming directly toward them.Langdon and Sienna huddled closer.“Hey!” a different voice shouted in the distance. “We’ve got them!”The footsteps stopped short.Langdon could now hear someone running loudly down the gravel walkway toward thegrotto. “Positive ID!” the breathless voice declared. “We just spoke to a coupleof tourists. A few minutes ago, the man and the woman asked them directions tothe palace’s costume gallery … which is over at the west end of the palazzo.”Langdon glanced at Sienna, who seemed to be smiling ever so faintly.The soldier regained his breath, continuing. “The western exits were the firstto be sealed … and confidence is high that we’ve got them trapped inside thegardens.”“Execute your mission,” the nearer soldier replied. “And call me the instantyou’ve succeeded.”There was a flurry of departing footsteps on gravel, the sound of the dronelifting off again, and then, thankfully … total silence.Langdon was about to twist sideways in order to peer around the plinth, whenSienna grabbed his arm, stopping him. She held a finger to her lips and noddedat a faint humanoid shadow on the rear wall. The lead soldier was still standingsilently in the mouth of the grotto.What is he waiting for?!“It’s Brüder,” he said suddenly. “We’ve got them cornered. I should haveconfirmation for you shortly.”The man had placed a phone call, and his voice sounded unnervingly close, as ifhe were standing right beside them. The cavern was acting like a parabolicmicrophone, collecting all the sound and focusing it at the rear.“There’s more,” Brüder said. “I just received an update from forensics. Thewoman’s apartment appears to be a sublet. Underfurnished. Clearly short term. Welocated the biotube, but the projector was not present. I repeat, the projectorwas not present. We assume it’s still in Langdon’s possession.”Langdon felt a chill to hear the soldier speak his own name.The footsteps grew louder, and Langdon realized that the man was moving into thegrotto. His gait lacked the intensity of a few moments before and sounded now asif he were simply wandering, exploring the grotto as he talked on the phone.“Correct,” the man said. “Forensics also confirmed a single outbound callshortly before we stormed the apartment.”The U.S. Consulate, Langdon thought, remembering his phone conversation and thequick arrival of the spike-haired assassin. The woman seemed to havedisappeared, replaced by an entire team of trained soldiers.We can’t outrun them forever.The sound of the soldier’s boots on the stone floor was now only about twentyfeet away and closing. The man had entered the second chamber, and if hecontinued to the end, he would certainly spot the two of them crouched behindVenus’s narrow base.“Sienna Brooks,” the man declared suddenly, the words crystal clear.Sienna startled beside Langdon, her eyes reeling upward, clearly expecting tosee the soldier staring down at her. But nobody was there.“They’re going through her laptop now,” the voice continued, about ten feetaway. “I don’t have a report yet, but it is definitely the same machine wetraced when Langdon accessed his Harvard e-mail account.”On hearing this news, Sienna turned to Langdon in disbelief, gaping at him withan expression of shock … and then betrayal.Langdon was equally stunned. That’s how they tracked us?! It hadn’t evenoccurred to him at the time. I just needed information! Before Langdon couldconvey an apology, Sienna had turned away, her expression going blank.“That’s correct,” the soldier said, arriving at the entrance to the thirdchamber, a mere six feet from Langdon and Sienna. Two more steps and he wouldsee them for certain.“Exactly,” he declared, taking one step closer. Suddenly the soldier paused.“Hold on a second.”Langdon froze, bracing to be discovered.“Hold on, I’m losing you,” the soldier said, and then retreated a few steps intothe second chamber. “Bad connection. Go ahead …” He listened for a moment, thenreplied. “Yes, I agree, but at least we know who we’re dealing with.”With that, his footsteps faded out of the grotto, moved across a gravel surface,and then disappeared completely.Langdon’s shoulders softened, and he turned to Sienna, whose eyes burned with amixture of fear and anger.“You used my laptop?!” she demanded. “To check your e-mail?”“I’m sorry … I thought you’d understand. I needed to find out—”“That’s how they found us! And now they know my name!”“I apologize, Sienna. I didn’t realize …” Langdon was racked by guilt.Sienna turned away, staring blankly at the bulbous stalagmite on the rear wall.Neither one of them said anything for nearly a minute. Langdon wondered ifSienna remembered the personal items that had been stacked on her desk—theplaybill from A Midsummer Night’s Dream and press clippings about her life as ayoung prodigy. Does she suspect I saw them? If so, she wasn’t asking, andLangdon was in enough trouble with her already that he was not about to mentionit.“They know who I am,” Sienna repeated, her voice so faint that Langdon couldbarely hear her. Over the next ten seconds, Sienna took several slow breaths, asif trying to absorb this new reality. As she did so, Langdon sensed that herresolve was slowly hardening.Without warning, Sienna scrambled to her feet. “We should go,” she said. “Itwon’t take long for them to figure out we’re not in the costume gallery.”Langdon stood up with her. “Yes, but go … where?”“Vatican City?”“I beg your pardon?”“I finally figured out what you meant before … what Vatican City has in commonwith the Boboli Gardens.” She motioned in the direction of the little gray door.“That’s the entrance, right?”Langdon managed a nod. “Actually, that’s the exit, but I figured it was worth ashot. Unfortunately, we can’t get through.” Langdon had heard enough of theguard’s exchange with the soldier to know this doorway was not an option.“But if we could get through,” Sienna said, a hint of mischief returning to hervoice, “do you know what that would mean?” A faint smile now crossed her lips.“It would mean that twice today you and I have been helped by the sameRenaissance artist.”Langdon had to chuckle, having had the same thought a few minutes ago. “Vasari.Vasari.”Sienna grinned more broadly now, and Langdon sensed she had forgiven him, atleast for the moment. “I think it’s a sign from above,” she declared, soundinghalf serious. “We should go through that door.”“Okay … and we’ll just march right past the guard?”Sienna cracked her knuckles and headed out of the grotto. “No, I’ll have a wordwith him.” She glanced back at Langdon, the fire returning to her eyes. “Trustme, Professor, I can be quite persuasive when I have to be.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]The pounding on the little gray door had returned.Firm and relentless.Security guard Ernesto Russo grumbled in frustration. The strange, cold-eyedsoldier was apparently back, but his timing could not have been worse. Thetelevised football match was in overtime with Fiorentina a man short and hangingby a thread.The pounding continued.Ernesto was no fool. He knew there was some kind of trouble out there thismorning—all the sirens and soldiers—but he had never been one to involve himselfin matters that didn’t affect him directly.Pazzo è colui che bada ai fatti altrui.Then again, the soldier was clearly someone of importance, and ignoring him wasprobably unwise. Jobs in Italy were hard to find these days, even boring ones.Stealing a last glance at the game, Ernesto headed off toward the pounding onthe door.He still couldn’t believe he was paid to sit in his tiny office all day andwatch television. Perhaps twice a day, a VIP tour would arrive outside thespace, having walked all the way from the Uffizi Gallery. Ernesto would greetthem, unlock the metal grate, and permit the group to pass through to the littlegray door, where their tour would end in the Boboli Gardens.Now, as the pounding grew more intense, Ernesto opened the steel grate, movedthrough it, and then closed and locked it behind him.“Sì?” he shouted above the sounds of pounding as he hurried to the gray door.No reply. The pounding continued.Insomma! He finally unlocked the door and pulled it open, expecting to see thesame lifeless gaze from a moment ago.But the face at the door was far more attractive.“Ciao,” a pretty blond woman said, smiling sweetly at him. She held out a foldedpiece of paper, which he instinctively reached out to accept. In the instant hegrasped the paper and realized it was nothing but a piece of trash off theground, the woman seized his wrist with her slender hands and plunged a thumbinto the bony carpal area just beneath the palm of his hand.Ernesto felt as if a knife had just severed his wrist. The slicing stab wasfollowed by an electric numbness. The woman stepped toward him, and the pressureincreased exponentially, starting the pain cycle all over again. He staggeredbackward, trying to pull his arm free, but his legs went numb and buckledbeneath him, and he slumped to his knees.The rest happened in an instant.A tall man in a dark suit appeared in the open doorway, slipped inside, andquickly closed the gray door behind him. Ernesto reached for his radio, but asoft hand behind his neck squeezed once, and his muscles seized up, leaving himgasping for breath. The woman took the radio as the tall man approached, lookingas alarmed by her actions as Ernesto was.“Dim mak,” the blond said casually to the tall man. “Chinese pressure points.There’s a reason they’ve been around for three millennia.”The man watched in wonder.“Non vogliamo farti del male,” the woman whispered to Ernesto, easing thepressure on his neck. We don’t want to hurt you.The instant the pressure decreased, Ernesto tried to twist free, but thepressure promptly returned, and his muscles seized again. He gasped in pain,barely able to breathe.“Dobbiamo passare,” she said. We need to get through. She motioned to the steelgrate, which Ernesto had thankfully locked behind him. “Dov’è la chiave?”“Non ce l’ho,” he managed. I don’t have the key.The tall man advanced past them to the grating and examined the mechanism. “It’sa combination lock,” he called back to the woman, his accent American.The woman knelt down next to Ernesto, her brown eyes like ice. “Qual è lacombinazione?” she demanded.“Non posso!” he replied. “I’m not permitted—”Something happened at the top of his spine, and Ernesto felt his entire body golimp. An instant later, he blacked out.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]When he came to, Ernesto sensed he had been drifting in and out of consciousnessfor several minutes. He recalled some discussion … more stabs of pain … beingdragged, perhaps? It was all a blur.As the cobwebs cleared, he saw a strange sight—his shoes lying on the floornearby with their laces removed. It was then that he realized he could barelymove. He was lying on his side with his hands and feet bound behind him,apparently with his shoelaces. He tried to yell, but no sound came. One of hisown socks was stuffed in his mouth. The true moment of fear, however, came aninstant later, when he looked up and saw his television set playing the footballmatch. I’m in my office … INSIDE the grate?!In the distance, Ernesto could hear the sound of running footsteps departingalong the corridor … and then, slowly, they faded to silence. Non è possibile!Somehow, the blond woman had persuaded Ernesto to do the one thing he was hirednever to do—reveal the combination for the lock on the entrance to the famedVasari Corridor."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31DR. ELIZABETH SINSKEY FELT the waves of nausea and dizziness coming faster now.She was slumped in the backseat of the van parked in front of the Pitti Palace.The soldier seated beside her was watching her with growing concern.Moments earlier, the soldier’s radio had blared—something about a costumegallery—awakening Elizabeth from the darkness of her mind, where she had beendreaming of the green-eyed monster.She had been back in the darkened room at the Council on Foreign Relations inNew York, listening to the maniacal ravings of the mysterious stranger who hadsummoned her there. The shadowy man paced at the front of the room—a lankysilhouette against the grisly projected image of the naked and dying throngsinspired by Dante’s Inferno.“Someone needs to fight this war,” the figure concluded, “or this is our future.Mathematics guarantees it. Mankind is hovering now in a purgatory ofprocrastination and indecision and personal greed … but the rings of hell await,just beneath our feet, waiting to consume us all.”Elizabeth was still reeling from the monstrous ideas this man had just laid outbefore her. She could stand it no longer and jumped to her feet. “What you’resuggesting is—”“Our only remaining option,” the man interjected.“Actually,” she replied, “I was going to say ‘criminal’!”The man shrugged. “The path to paradise passes directly through hell. Dantetaught us that.”“You’re mad!”“Mad?” the man repeated, sounding hurt. “Me? I think not. Madness is the WHOstaring into the abyss and denying it is there. Madness is an ostrich who sticksher head in the sand while a pack of hyenas closes in around her.”Before Elizabeth could defend her organization, the man had changed the image onthe screen.“And speaking of hyenas,” he said, pointing to the new image. “Here is the packof hyenas currently circling humankind … and they are closing in fast.”Elizabeth was surprised to see the familiar image before her. It was a graphpublished by the WHO the previous year delineating key environmental issuesdeemed by the WHO to have the greatest impact on global health.The list included, among others:Demand for clean water, global surface temperatures, ozone depletion,consumption of ocean resources, species extinction, CO2 concentration,deforestation, and global sea levels.All of these negative indicators had been on the rise over the last century.Now, however, they were all accelerating at terrifying rates.image [../Images/00009.jpeg]Elizabeth had the same reaction that she always had when she saw this graph—asense of helplessness. She was a scientist and believed in the usefulness ofstatistics, and this graph painted a chilling picture not of the distant future… but of the very near future.At many times in her life, Elizabeth Sinskey had been haunted by her inabilityto conceive a child. Yet, when she saw this graph, she almost felt relieved shehad not brought a child into the world.This is the future I would be giving my child?“Over the last fifty years,” the tall man declared, “our sins against MotherNature have grown exponentially.” He paused. “I fear for the soul of humankind.When the WHO published this graph, the world’s politicians, power brokers, andenvironmentalists held emergency summits, all trying to assess which of theseproblems were most severe and which we could actually hope to solve. Theoutcome? Privately, they put their heads in their hands and wept. Publicly, theyassured us all that they were working on solutions but that these are complexissues.”“These issues are complex!”“Bullshit!” the man erupted. “You know damned well this graph depicts thesimplest of relationships—a function based on a single variable! Every singleline on this graph climbs in direct proportion to one value—the value thateveryone is afraid to discuss. Global population!”“Actually, I think it’s a bit more—”“A bit more complicated? Actually, it’s not! There is nothing simpler. If youwant more available clean water per capita, you need fewer people on earth. Ifyou want to decrease vehicle emissions, you need fewer drivers. If you want theoceans to replenish their fish, you need fewer people eating fish!”He glared down at her, his tone becoming even more forceful. “Open your eyes! Weare on the brink of the end of humanity, and our world leaders are sitting inboardrooms commissioning studies on solar power, recycling, and hybridautomobiles? How is it that you—a highly educated woman of science—don’t see?Ozone depletion, lack of water, and pollution are not the disease—they are thesymptoms. The disease is overpopulation. And unless we face world populationhead-on, we are doing nothing more than sticking a Band-Aid on a fast-growingcancerous tumor.”“You perceive the human race as a cancer?” Elizabeth demanded.“Cancer is nothing more than a healthy cell that starts replicating out ofcontrol. I realize you find my ideas distasteful, but I can assure you that youwill find the alternative far less tasteful when it arrives. If we do not takebold action, then—”“Bold?!” she sputtered. “Bold is not the word you’re looking for. Try insane!”“Dr. Sinskey,” the man said, his voice now eerily calm. “I called you herespecifically because I was hoping that you—a sage voice at the World HealthOrganization—might be willing to work with me and explore a possible solution.”Elizabeth stared in disbelief. “You think the World Health Organization is goingto partner with you … exploring an idea like this?”“Actually, yes,” he said. “Your organization is made up of doctors, and whendoctors have a patient with gangrene, they do not hesitate to cut off his leg tosave his life. Sometimes the only course of action is the lesser of two evils.”“This is quite different.”“No. This is identical. The only difference is scale.”Elizabeth had heard enough. She stood abruptly. “I have a plane to catch.”The tall man took a threatening step in her direction, blocking her exit. “Fairwarning. With or without your cooperation, I can very easily explore this ideaon my own.”“Fair warning,” she fired back. “I consider this a terrorist threat and willtreat it as such.” She took out her phone.The man laughed. “You’re going to report me for talking in hypotheticals?Unfortunately, you’ll have to wait to make your call. This room iselectronically shielded. Your phone won’t have a signal.”I don’t need a signal, you lunatic. Elizabeth raised her phone, and before theman realized what was happening, she clicked a snapshot of his face. The flashreflected in his green eyes, and for a moment she thought he looked familiar.“Whoever you are,” she said, “you did the wrong thing by calling me here. By thetime I reach the airport, I will know who you are, and you will be on the watchlists at the WHO, the CDC, and the ECDC as a potential bioterrorist. We willhave people on you day and night. If you try to purchase materials, we will knowabout it. If you build a lab, we will know about it. There is nowhere you canhide.”The man stood in tense silence for a long moment, as if he were going to lungeat her phone. Finally, he relaxed and stepped aside with an eerie grin. “Then itappears our dance has begun.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 32IL CORRIDOIO VASARIANO—the Vasari Corridor—was designed by Giorgio Vasari in1564 under orders of the Medici ruler, Grand Duke Cosimo I, to provide safepassage from his residence at the Pitti Palace to his administrative offices,across the Arno River in the Palazzo Vecchio.Similar to Vatican City’s famed Passetto, the Vasari Corridor was thequintessential secret passageway. It stretched nearly a full kilometer from theeastern corner of the Boboli Gardens to the heart of the old palace itself,crossing the Ponte Vecchio and snaking through the Uffizi Gallery in between.Nowadays, the Vasari Corridor still served as a safe haven, although not forMedici aristocrats but for artwork; with its seemingly endless expanse of securewall space, the corridor was home to countless rare paintings—overflow from theworld-famous Uffizi Gallery, through which the corridor passed.Langdon had traveled the passageway a few years before as part of a leisurelyprivate tour. On that afternoon, he had paused to admire the corridor’smind-boggling array of paintings—including the most extensive collection ofself-portraits in the world. He had also stopped several times to peer out ofthe corridor’s occasional viewing portals, which permitted travelers to gaugetheir progress along the elevated walkway.This morning, however, Langdon and Sienna were moving through the corridor at arun, eager to put as much distance as possible between themselves and theirpursuers at the other end. Langdon wondered how long it would take for the boundguard to be discovered. As the tunnel stretched out before them, Langdon sensedit leading them closer with every step to what they were searching for.Cerca trova … the eyes of death … and an answer as to who is chasing me.The distant whine of the surveillance drone was far behind them now. The fartherthey progressed into the tunnel, the more Langdon was reminded of just howambitious an architectural feat this passageway had been. Elevated above thecity for nearly its entire length, the Vasari Corridor was like a broad serpent,snaking through the buildings, all the way from the Pitti Palace, across theArno, into the heart of old Florence. The narrow, whitewashed passageway seemedto stretch for eternity, occasionally turning briefly left or right to avoid anobstacle, but always moving east … across the Arno.The sudden sound of voices echoed ahead of them in the corridor, and Siennaskidded to a stop. Langdon halted, too, and immediately placed a calm hand onher shoulder, motioning to a nearby viewing portal.Tourists down below.Langdon and Sienna moved to the portal and peered out, seeing that they werecurrently perched above the Ponte Vecchio—the medieval stone bridge that servesas a pedestrian walkway into the old city. Below them, the day’s first touristswere enjoying the market that has been held on the bridge since the 1400s. Todaythe vendors are mostly goldsmiths and jewelers, but that has not always been thecase. Originally, the bridge had been home to Florence’s vast, open-air meatmarket, but the butchers were banished in 1593 after the rancid odor of spoiledmeat had wafted up into the Vasari Corridor and assaulted the delicate nostrilsof the grand duke.Down there on the bridge somewhere, Langdon recalled, was the precise spot whereone of Florence’s most infamous crimes had been committed. In 1216, a youngnobleman named Buondelmonte had rejected his family’s arranged marriage for thesake of his true love, and for that decision he was brutally killed on this verybridge.His death, long considered “Florence’s bloodiest murder,” was so named becauseit had triggered a rift between two powerful political factions—the Guelphs andGhibellines—who had then waged war ruthlessly for centuries against each other.Because the ensuing political feud had brought about Dante’s exile fromFlorence, the poet had bitterly immortalized the event in his Divine Comedy: OBuondelmonte, through another’s counsel, you fled your wedding pledge, andbrought such evil!To this day, three separate plaques—each quoting a different line from Canto 16of Dante’s Paradiso—could be found near the murder site. One of them wassituated at the mouth of the Ponte Vecchio and ominously declared:BUT FLORENCE, IN HER FINAL PEACE, WAS FATED TO OFFER UP UNTO THAT MUTILATEDSTONE GUARDIAN UPON HER BRIDGE … A VICTIM.Langdon raised his eyes now from the bridge to the murky waters it spanned. Offto the east, the lone spire of the Palazzo Vecchio beckoned.Even though Langdon and Sienna were only halfway across the Arno River, he hadno doubt they had long since passed the point of no return.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Thirty feet below, on the cobblestones of the Ponte Vecchio, Vayentha anxiouslyscanned the oncoming crowd, never imagining that her only redemption had, justmoments before, passed directly overhead."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 33DEEP IN THE bowels of the anchored vessel The Mendacium, facilitator Knowltonsat alone in his cubicle and tried in vain to focus on his work. Filled withtrepidation, he had gone back to viewing the video and, for the past hour, hadbeen analyzing the nine-minute soliloquy that hovered somewhere between geniusand madness.Knowlton fast-forwarded from the beginning, looking for any clue he might havemissed. He skipped past the submerged plaque … past the suspended bag of murkyyellow-brown liquid … and found the moment that the beak-nosed shadow appeared—adeformed silhouette cast upon a dripping cavern wall … illuminated by a soft redglow.Knowlton listened to the muffled voice, attempting to decipher the elaboratelanguage. About halfway through the speech, the shadow on the wall suddenlyloomed larger and the sound of the voice intensified.Dante’s hell is not fiction … it is prophecy!Wretched misery. Torturous woe. This is the landscape of tomorrow.Mankind, if unchecked, functions like a plague, a cancer … our numbersintensifying with each successive generation until the earthly comforts thatonce nourished our virtue and brotherhood have dwindled to nothing … unveilingthe monsters within us … fighting to the death to feed our young.This is Dante’s nine-ringed hell.This is what awaits.As the future hurls herself toward us, fueled by the unyielding mathematics ofMalthus, we teeter above the first ring of hell … preparing to plummet fasterthan we ever fathomed.Knowlton paused the video. The mathematics of Malthus? A quick Internet searchled him to information about a prominent nineteenth-century Englishmathematician and demographist named Thomas Robert Malthus, who had famouslypredicted an eventual global collapse due to overpopulation.Malthus’s biography, much to Knowlton’s alarm, included a harrowing excerpt fromhis book An Essay on the Principle of Population:The power of population is so superior to the power in the earth to producesubsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape or other visit thehuman race. The vices of mankind are active and able ministers of depopulation.They are the precursors in the great army of destruction; and often finish thedreadful work themselves.

Knowlton did not like the sound of that.With a hesitant finger, he started the video again.The muffled voice continued.To do nothing is to welcome Dante’s hell … cramped and starving, weltering inSin.And so boldly I have taken action.Some will recoil in horror, but all salvation comes at a price.One day the world will grasp the beauty of my sacrifice.For I am your Salvation.I am the Shade.I am the gateway to the Posthuman age."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 34THE PALAZZO VECCHIO resembles a giant chess piece. With its robust quadrangularfacade and rusticated square-cut battlements, the massive rooklike building isaptly situated, guarding the southeast corner of the Piazza della Signoria.The building’s unusual single spire, rising off center from within the squarefortress, cuts a distinctive profile against the skyline and has become aninimitable symbol of Florence.Built as a potent seat of Italian government, the building imposes on itsarriving visitors an intimidating array of masculine statuary. Ammannati’smuscular Neptune stands naked atop four sea horses, a symbol of Florence’sdominance in the sea. A replica of Michelangelo’s David—arguably the world’smost admired male nude—stands in all his glory at the palazzo entrance. David isjoined by Hercules and Cacus—two more colossal naked men—who, in concert with ahost of Neptune’s satyrs, bring to more than a dozen the total number of exposedpenises that greet visitors to the palazzo.Normally, Langdon’s visits to the Palazzo Vecchio had begun here on the Piazzadella Signoria, which, despite its overabundance of phalluses, had always beenone of his favorite plazas in all of Europe. No trip to the piazza was completewithout sipping an espresso at Caffè Rivoire, followed by a visit to the Medicilions in the Loggia dei Lanzi—the piazza’s open-air sculpture gallery.Today, however, Langdon and his companion planned to enter the Palazzo Vecchiovia the Vasari Corridor, much as Medici dukes might have done in theirday—bypassing the famous Uffizi Gallery and following the corridor as it snakedabove bridges, over roads, and through buildings, leading directly into theheart of the old palace. Thus far, they had heard no trace of footsteps behindthem, but Langdon was still anxious to exit the corridor.And now we’ve arrived, Langdon realized, eyeing the heavy wooden door beforethem. The entrance to the old palace.The door, despite its substantial locking mechanism, was equipped with ahorizontal push bar, which provided emergency-exit capability while preventinganyone on the other side from entering the Vasari Corridor without a key card.Langdon placed his ear to the door and listened. Hearing nothing on the otherside, he put his hands against the bar and pushed gently.The lock clicked.As the wooden portal creaked open a few inches, Langdon peered into the worldbeyond. A small alcove. Empty. Silent.With a small sigh of relief, Langdon stepped through and motioned for Sienna tofollow.We’re in.Standing in a quiet alcove somewhere inside the Palazzo Vecchio, Langdon waiteda moment and tried to get his bearings. In front of them, a long hallway ranperpendicular to the alcove. To their left, in the distance, voices echoed upthe corridor, calm and jovial. The Palazzo Vecchio, much like the United StatesCapitol Building, was both a tourist attraction and a governmental office. Atthis hour, the voices they heard were most likely those of civic employeesbustling in and out of offices, getting ready for the day.Langdon and Sienna inched toward the hallway and peered around the corner. Sureenough, at the end of the hallway was an atrium in which a dozen or sogovernment employees stood around sipping morning espressi and chatting withcolleagues before work.“The Vasari mural,” Sienna whispered, “you said it’s in the Hall of the FiveHundred?”Langdon nodded and pointed across the crowded atrium toward a portico thatopened into a stone hallway. “Unfortunately, it’s through that atrium.”“You’re sure?”Langdon nodded. “We’ll never make it through without being seen.”“They’re government workers. They’ll have no interest in us. Just walk like youbelong here.”Sienna reached up and gently smoothed out Langdon’s Brioni suit jacket andadjusted his collar. “You look very presentable, Robert.” She gave him a demuresmile, adjusted her own sweater, and set out.Langdon hurried after her, both of them striding purposefully toward the atrium.As they entered, Sienna began talking to him in rapid Italian—something aboutfarm subsidies—gesticulating passionately as she spoke. They kept to the outerwall, maintaining their distance from the others. To Langdon’s amazement, notone single employee gave them a second glance.When they were beyond the atrium, they quickly pressed onward toward thehallway. Langdon recalled the Shakespeare playbill. Mischievous Puck. “You’requite an actress,” he whispered.“I’ve had to be,” she said reflexively, her voice strangely distant.Once again, Langdon sensed there was more heartache in this young woman’s pastthan he knew, and he felt a deepening sense of remorse for having entangled herin his dangerous predicament. He reminded himself that there was nothing to bedone now, except to see it through.Keep swimming through the tunnel … and pray for light.As they neared their portico, Langdon was relieved to see that his memory hadserved him well. A small plaque with an arrow pointed around the corner into thehallway and announced: IL SALONE DEI CINQUECENTO. The Hall of the Five Hundred,Langdon thought, wondering what answers awaited within. The truth can beglimpsed only through the eyes of death. What could this mean?“The room may still be locked,” Langdon warned as they neared the corner.Although the Hall of the Five Hundred was a popular tourist destination, thepalazzo did not appear to be open yet to tourists this morning.“Do you hear that?” Sienna asked, stopping short.Langdon heard it. A loud humming noise was coming from just around the corner.Please tell me it’s not an indoor drone. Cautiously, Langdon peered around thecorner of the portico. Thirty yards away stood the surprisingly simple woodendoor that opened into the Hall of the Five Hundred. Regrettably, directlybetween them stood a portly custodian pushing an electric floor-buffing machinein weary circles.Guardian of the gate.Langdon’s attention shifted to three symbols on a plastic sign outside the door.Decipherable to even the least experienced of symbologists, these universalicons were: a video camera with an X through it; a drinking cup with an Xthrough it; and a pair of boxy stick figures, one female, one male.Langdon took charge, striding swiftly toward the custodian, breaking into a jogas he drew nearer. Sienna rushed behind him to keep up.The custodian glanced up, looking startled. “Signori?!” He held out his arms forLangdon and Sienna to stop.Langdon gave the man a pained smile—more of a wince—and motioned apologeticallytoward the symbols near the door. “Toilette,” he declared, his voice pinched. Itwas not a question.The custodian hesitated a moment, looking ready to deny their request, and thenfinally, watching Langdon shift uncomfortably before him, he gave a sympatheticnod and waved them through.When they reached the door, Langdon gave Sienna a quick wink. “Compassion is auniversal language.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 35AT ONE TIME, the Hall of the Five Hundred was the largest room in the world. Ithad been built in 1494 to provide a meeting hall for the entire ConsiglioMaggiore—the republic’s Grand Council of precisely five hundred members—fromwhich the hall drew its name. Some years later, at the behest of Cosimo I, theroom was renovated and enlarged substantially. Cosimo I, the most powerful manin Italy, chose as the project’s overseer and architect the great GiorgioVasari.In an exceptional feat of engineering, Vasari had raised the original roofsubstantially and permitted natural light to flow in through high transoms onall four sides of the room, resulting in an elegant showroom for some ofFlorence’s finest architecture, sculpture, and painting.For Langdon, it was always the floor of this room that first drew his eye,immediately announcing that this was no ordinary space. The crimson stoneparquet was overlaid with a black grid, giving the twelve-thousand-square-footexpanse an air of solidity, depth, and balance.Langdon raised his eyes slowly to the far side of the room, where six dynamicsculptures—The Labors of Hercules—lined the wall like a phalanx of soldiers.Langdon intentionally ignored the oft-maligned Hercules and Diomedes, whosenaked bodies were locked in an awkward-looking wrestling match, which included acreative “penile grip” that always made Langdon cringe.Far easier on the eyes was Michelangelo’s breathtaking Genius of Victory, whichstood to the right, dominating the central niche in the south wall. At nearlynine feet tall, this sculpture had been intended for the tomb of theultraconservative pope Julius II—Il Papa Terribile—a commission Langdon hadalways found ironic, considering the Vatican’s stance on homosexuality. Thestatue depicted Tommaso dei Cavalieri, the young man with whom Michelangelo hadbeen in love for much of his life and to whom he composed over three hundredsonnets.“I can’t believe I’ve never been here,” Sienna whispered beside him, her voicesuddenly quiet and reverent. “This is … beautiful.”Langdon nodded, recalling his first visit to this space—on the occasion of aspectacular concert of classical music featuring the world-renowned pianistMariele Keymel. Although this grand hall was originally intended for privatepolitical meetings and audiences with the grand duke, nowadays it more commonlyfeatured popular musicians, lecturers, and gala dinners—from art historianMaurizio Seracini to the Gucci Museum’s star-studded, black-and-white galaopening. Langdon sometimes wondered how Cosimo I would feel about sharing hisaustere private hall with CEOs and fashion models.Langdon lifted his gaze now to the enormous murals adorning the walls. Theirbizarre history included a failed experimental painting technique by Leonardo daVinci, which resulted in a “melting masterpiece.” There had also been anartistic “showdown” spearheaded by Piero Soderini and Machiavelli, which pittedagainst each other two titans of the Renaissance—Michelangelo andLeonardo—commanding them to create murals on opposite walls of the same room.Today, however, Langdon was more interested in one of the room’s otherhistorical oddities.Cerca trova.“Which one is the Vasari?” Sienna asked, scanning the murals.“Nearly all of them,” Langdon replied, knowing that as part of the room’srenovation, Vasari and his assistants had repainted almost everything in it,from the original wall murals to the thirty-nine coffered panels adorning itsfamed “hanging” ceiling.“But that mural there,” Langdon said, pointing to the mural on their far right,“is the one we came to see—Vasari’s Battle of Marciano.”The military confrontation was absolutely massive—fifty-five feet long and morethan three stories tall. It was rendered in ruddy shades of brown and green—aviolent panorama of soldiers, horses, spears, and banners all colliding on apastoral hillside.“Vasari, Vasari,” Sienna whispered. “And hidden in there somewhere is his secretmessage?”Langdon nodded as he squinted toward the top of the huge mural, trying to locatethe particular green battle flag on which Vasari had painted his mysteriousmessage—CERCA TROVA. “It’s almost impossible to see from down here withoutbinoculars,” Langdon said, pointing, “but in the top middle section, if you lookjust below the two farmhouses on the hillside, there’s a tiny, tilted green flagand—”“I see it!” Sienna said, pointing to the upper-right quadrant, precisely in theright spot.Langdon wished he had younger eyes.The two walked closer to the towering mural, and Langdon gazed up at itssplendor. Finally, they were here. The only problem now was that Langdon was notsure why they were here. He stood in silence for several long moments, staringup at the details of Vasari’s masterpiece.If I fail … then all is death.A door creaked open behind them, and the custodian with the floor buffer peeredin, looking uncertain. Sienna gave a friendly wave. The custodian eyed them amoment and then closed the door.“We don’t have much time, Robert,” Sienna urged. “You need to think. Does thepainting ring any bells for you? Any memories at all?”Langdon scrutinized the chaotic battle scene above them.The truth can be glimpsed only through the eyes of death.Langdon had thought perhaps the mural included a corpse whose dead eyes weregazing blankly off toward some other clue in the painting … or perhaps evenelsewhere in the room. Unfortunately, Langdon now saw that there were dozens ofdead bodies in the mural, none of them particularly noteworthy and none withdead eyes directed anywhere in particular.The truth can be glimpsed only through the eyes of death?He tried to envision connecting lines from one corpse to another, wondering if ashape might emerge, but he saw nothing.Langdon’s head was throbbing again as he frantically plumbed the depths of hismemory. Somewhere down there, the voice of the silver-haired woman keptwhispering: Seek and ye shall find.“Find what?!” Langdon wanted to shout.He forced himself to close his eyes and exhale slowly. He rolled his shoulders afew times and tried to free himself from all conscious thought, hoping to tapinto his gut instinct.Very sorry.Vasari.Cerca trova.The truth can be glimpsed only through the eyes of death.His gut told him, without a doubt, that he was standing in the right location.And while he was not yet sure why, he had the distinct sense that he was momentsaway from finding what he had come here seeking.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Agent Brüder stared blankly at the red velvet pantaloons and tunic in thedisplay case before him and cursed under his breath. His SRS team had searchedthe entire costume gallery, and Langdon and Sienna Brooks were nowhere to befound.Surveillance and Response Support, he thought angrily. Since when does a collegeprofessor elude SRS? Where the hell did they go!“Every exit was sealed,” one of his men insisted. “The only possibility is thatthey are still in the gardens.”While this seemed logical, Brüder had the sinking sensation that Langdon andSienna Brooks had found some other way out.“Get the drone back in the air,” Brüder snapped. “And tell the local authoritiesto widen the search area outside the walls.” Goddamn it!As his men dashed off, Brüder grabbed his phone and called the person in charge.“It’s Brüder,” he said. “I’m afraid we’ve got a serious problem. A number ofthem actually.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36THE TRUTH CAN be glimpsed only through the eyes of death.Sienna repeated the words to herself as she continued to search every inch ofVasari’s brutal battle scene, hoping something might stand out.She saw eyes of death everywhere.Which ones are we looking for?!She wondered if maybe the eyes of death were a reference to all the rottingcorpses strewn across Europe by the Black Death.At least that would explain the plague mask …Out of the blue, a childhood nursery rhyme jumped into Sienna’s mind: Ringaround the rosie. A pocketful of posies. Ashes, ashes. We all fall down.She used to recite the poem as a schoolgirl in England until she heard that itderived from the Great Plague of London in 1665. Allegedly, a ring around therosie was a reference to a rose-colored pustule on the skin that developed aring around it and indicated that one was infected. Sufferers would carry apocketful of posies in an effort to mask the smell of their own decaying bodiesas well as the stench of the city itself, where hundreds of plague victimsdropped dead daily, their bodies then cremated. Ashes, ashes. We all fall down.“For the love of God,” Langdon blurted suddenly, wheeling around toward theopposite wall.Sienna looked over. “What’s wrong?”“That’s the name of a piece of art that was once on display here. For the Loveof God.”Bewildered, Sienna watched Langdon hurry across the room to a small glass door,which he tried to open. It was locked. He put his face to the glass, cupping hishands around his eyes and peering inside.Whatever Langdon was looking for, Sienna hoped he spotted it in a hurry; thecustodian had just reappeared, now with a look of deepening suspicion at thesight of Langdon sauntering off to snoop at a locked door.Sienna waved cheerfully to the custodian, but the man glared at her for a longcold beat and then disappeared.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Lo Studiolo.Positioned behind a glass door, directly opposite the hidden words cerca trovain the Hall of the Five Hundred, was nestled a tiny windowless chamber. Designedby Vasari as a secret study for Francesco I, the rectangular Studiolo rose to arounded, barrel-vaulted ceiling, which gave those inside the feeling of beinginside a giant treasure chest.Fittingly, the interior glistened with objects of beauty. More than thirty rarepaintings adorned the walls and ceiling, mounted so close to one another thatthey left virtually no empty wall space. The Fall of Icarus … An Allegory ofHuman Life … Nature Presenting Prometheus with Spectacular Gems …As Langdon peered through the glass into the dazzling space beyond, he whisperedto himself, “The eyes of death.”Langdon had first been inside Lo Studiolo during a private secret passages tourof the palazzo a few years back and had been stunned to learn about the plethoraof hidden doors, stairs, and passageways that honeycombed the palazzo, includingseveral hidden behind paintings inside Lo Studiolo.The secret passages, however, were not what had just sparked Langdon’s interest.Instead he had flashed on a bold piece of modern art that he had once seen ondisplay here—For the Love of God—a controversial piece by Damien Hirst, whichhad caused an uproar when it was shown inside Vasari’s famed Studiolo.A life-size cast of a human skull in solid platinum, its surface had beenentirely covered with more than eight thousand glittering, pavé-set diamonds.The effect was striking. The skull’s empty eye sockets glistened with light andlife, creating a troubling juxtaposition of opposing symbols—life and death …beauty and horror. Although Hirst’s diamond skull had long since been removedfrom Lo Studiolo, Langdon’s recollection of it had sparked an idea.The eyes of death, he thought. A skull certainly qualifies, doesn’t it?Skulls were a recurring theme in Dante’s Inferno, most famously Count Ugolino’sbrutal punishment in the lowest circle of hell—that of being sentenced to gnaweternally on the skull of a wicked archbishop.Are we looking for a skull?The enigmatic Studiolo, Langdon knew, had been built in the tradition of a“cabinet of curiosities.” Nearly all of its paintings were secretly hinged,swinging open to reveal hidden cupboards in which the duke had kept strangepossessions of interest to him—rare mineral samples, beautiful feathers, aperfect fossil of a nautilus shell, and even, allegedly, a monk’s tibiadecorated with hand-pounded silver.Unfortunately, Langdon suspected all the cupboard items had been removed longago, and he had never heard of any skull on display here other than Hirst’spiece.His thoughts were cut short by the loud slam of a door on the far side of thehall. The brisk click of footsteps approached quickly across the salon.“Signore!” an angry voice shouted. “Il salone non è aperto!”Langdon turned to see a female employee marching toward him. She was petite,with short brown hair. She was also extremely pregnant. The woman moved snappilytoward them, tapping her watch and shouting something about the hall not yetbeing open. As she drew near, she made eye contact with Langdon, and immediatelystopped short, covering her mouth in shock.“Professor Langdon!” she exclaimed, looking embarrassed. “I’m so sorry! I didn’tknow you were here. Welcome back!”Langdon froze.He was quite certain he had never seen this woman before in his life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 37“I ALMOST DIDN’T recognize you, Professor!” the woman gushed in accented Englishas she approached Langdon. “It’s your clothing.” She smiled warmly and gaveLangdon’s Brioni suit an appreciative nod. “Very fashionable. You look almostItalian.”Langdon’s mouth went bone dry, but he managed a polite smile as the woman joinedhim. “Good … morning,” he stumbled. “How are you?”She laughed, holding her belly. “Exhausted. Little Catalina kicked all night.”The woman glanced around the room, looking puzzled. “Il Duomino didn’t mentionyou were coming back today. I assume he’s with you?”Il Duomino? Langdon had no idea who she was talking about.The woman apparently saw his confusion and gave a reassuring chuckle. “It’sokay, everybody in Florence calls him by that nickname. He doesn’t mind.” Sheglanced around. “Did he let you in?”“He did,” Sienna said, arriving from across the hall, “but he had a breakfastmeeting. He said you wouldn’t mind if we stayed to look around.” Siennaenthusiastically extended her hand. “I’m Sienna. Robert’s sister.”The woman gave Sienna’s hand an overly official handshake. “I’m Marta Alvarez.Aren’t you the lucky one—having Professor Langdon as a private guide.”“Yes,” Sienna enthused, barely hiding the roll of her eyes. “He’s so smart!”There was an awkward pause as the woman studied Sienna. “Funny,” she said, “Idon’t see any family resemblance at all. Except perhaps your height.”Langdon sensed an impending train wreck. Now or never.“Marta,” Langdon interrupted, hoping he had heard her name correctly, “I’m sorryto trouble you, but, well … I guess you can probably imagine why I’m here.”“Actually, no,” she replied, her eyes narrowing. “I can’t for the life of meimagine what you would be doing here.”Langdon’s pulse quickened, and in the awkward silence that followed, he realizedhis gamble was about to crash and burn. Suddenly Marta broke into a broad smileand laughed out loud.“Professor, I’m joking! Of course, I can guess why you returned. Frankly, Idon’t know why you find it so fascinating, but since you and il Duomino spentalmost an hour up there last night, I’m guessing you’ve come back to show yoursister?”“Right …” he managed. “Exactly. I’d love to show Sienna, if that’s not … aninconvenience?”Marta glanced up to the second-floor balcony and shrugged. “No problem. I’mheaded up there now.”Langdon’s heart pounded as he looked up to the second-story balcony at the rearof the hall. I was up there last night? He remembered nothing. The balcony, heknew, in addition to being at the exact same height as the words cerca trova,also served as the entrance to the palazzo’s museum, which Langdon visitedwhenever he was here.Marta was about to lead them across the hall, when she paused, as if havingsecond thoughts. “Actually, Professor, are you sure we can’t find something abit less grim to show your lovely sister?”Langdon had no idea how to respond.“We’re seeing something grim?” Sienna asked. “What is it? He hasn’t told me.”Marta gave a coy smile and glanced at Langdon. “Professor, would you like me totell your sister about it, or would you prefer to do so yourself?”Langdon nearly jumped at the opportunity. “By all means, Marta, why don’t youtell her all about it.”Marta turned back to Sienna, speaking very slowly now. “I don’t know what yourbrother has told you, but we’re going up to the museum to see a very unusualmask.”Sienna’s eyes widened a bit. “What kind of mask? One of those ugly plague masksthey wear at Carnevale?”“Good guess,” Marta said, “but no, it’s not a plague mask. It’s a much differentkind of mask. It’s called a death mask.”Langdon’s gasp of revelation was audible, and Marta scowled at him, apparentlythinking he was being overly dramatic in an attempt to frighten his sister.“Don’t listen to your brother,” she said. “Death masks were a very commonpractice in the 1500s. It’s essentially just a plaster cast of someone’s face,taken a few moments after that person dies.”The death mask. Langdon felt the first moment of clarity he’d felt since wakingup in Florence. Dante’s Inferno … cerca trova … Looking through the eyes ofdeath. The mask!Sienna asked, “Whose face was used to cast the mask?”Langdon put his hand on Sienna’s shoulder and answered as calmly as possible. “Afamous Italian poet. His name was Dante Alighieri.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38THE MEDITERRANEAN SUN shone brightly on the decks of The Mendacium as it rockedover the Adriatic swells. Feeling weary, the provost drained his second Scotchand gazed blankly out his office window.The news from Florence was not good.Perhaps it was on account of his first taste of alcohol in a very long time, buthe was feeling strangely disoriented and powerless … as if his ship had lost itsengines and were drifting aimlessly on the tide.The sensation was a foreign one to the provost. In his world, there alwaysexisted a dependable compass—protocol—and it had never failed to show the way.Protocol was what enabled him to make difficult decisions without ever lookingback.It had been protocol that required Vayentha’s disavowal, and the provost hadcarried out the deed with no hesitation. I will deal with her once this currentcrisis has passed.It had been protocol that required the provost to know as little as possibleabout all of his clients. He had decided long ago that the Consortium had noethical responsibility to judge them.Provide the service.Trust the client.Ask no questions.Like the directors of most companies, the provost simply offered services withthe assumption that those services would be implemented within the framework ofthe law. After all, Volvo had no responsibility to ensure that soccer momsdidn’t speed through school zones, any more than Dell would be held responsibleif someone used one of their computers to hack into a bank account.Now, with everything unraveling, the provost quietly cursed the trusted contactwho had suggested this client to the Consortium.“He will be low maintenance and easy money,” the contact had assured him. “Theman is brilliant, a star in his field, and absurdly wealthy. He simply needs todisappear for a year or two. He wants to buy some time off the grid to work onan important project.”The provost had agreed without much thought. Long-term relocations were alwayseasy money, and the provost trusted his contact’s instincts.As expected, the job had been very easy money.That is, until last week.Now, in the wake of the chaos created by this man, the provost found himselfpacing in circles around a bottle of Scotch and counting the days until hisresponsibilities to this client were over.The phone on his desk rang, and the provost saw it was Knowlton, one of his topfacilitators, calling from downstairs.“Yes,” he answered.“Sir,” Knowlton began, an uneasy edge in his voice. “I hate to bother you withthis, but as you may know, we’re tasked with uploading a video to the mediatomorrow.”“Yes,” the provost replied. “Is it prepped?”“It is, but I thought you might want to preview it before upload.”The provost paused, puzzled by the comment. “Does the video mention us by nameor compromise us in some way?”“No, sir, but the content is quite disturbing. The client appears onscreen andsays—”“Stop right there,” the provost ordered, stunned that a senior facilitator woulddare suggest such a blatant breach of protocol. “The content is immaterial.Whatever it says, his video would have been released with or without us. Theclient could just as easily have released this video electronically, but hehired us. He paid us. He trusted us.”“Yes, sir.”“You were not hired to be a film critic,” the provost admonished. “You werehired to keep promises. Do your job.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]On the Ponte Vecchio, Vayentha waited, her sharp eyes scanning the hundreds offaces on the bridge. She had been vigilant and felt certain that Langdon had notyet passed her, but the drone had fallen silent, its tracking apparently nolonger required.Brüder must have caught him.Reluctantly, she began to ponder the grim prospect of a Consortium inquiry. Orworse.Vayentha again pictured the two agents who had been disavowed … never heard fromagain. They simply moved to different work, she assured herself. Nonetheless,she now found herself wondering if she should just drive into the hills ofTuscany, disappear, and use her skills to find a new life.But how long could I hide from them?Countless targets had learned firsthand that when the Consortium set you in itssights, privacy became an illusion. It was only a matter of time.Is my career really ending like this? she wondered, still unable to accept thather twelve-year tenure at the Consortium would be terminated over a series ofunlucky breaks. For a year she had vigilantly overseen the needs of theConsortium’s green-eyed client. It was not my fault he jumped to his death … andyet I seem to be falling along with him.Her only chance at redemption had been to outfox Brüder … but she’d known fromthe start that this was a long shot.I had my chance last night, and I failed.As Vayentha reluctantly turned back toward her motorcycle, she became suddenlyaware of a distant sound … a familiar high-pitched whine.Puzzled, she glanced up. To her surprise, the surveillance drone had just liftedoff again, this time near the farthest end of the Pitti Palace. Vayentha watchedas the tiny craft began flying desperate circles over the palace.The drone’s deployment could mean only one thing.They still don’t have Langdon!Where the hell is he?image [../Images/00005.jpeg]The piercing whine overhead again pulled Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey from herdelirium. The drone is up again? But I thought …She shifted in the backseat of the van, where the same young agent was stillseated beside her. She closed her eyes again, fighting the pain and nausea.Mostly, though, she fought the fear.Time is running out.Even though her enemy had jumped to his death, she still saw his silhouette inher dreams, lecturing her in the darkness of the Council on Foreign Relations.It is imperative that someone take bold action, he had declared, his green eyesflashing. If not us, who? If not now, when?Elizabeth knew she should have stopped him right then when she had the chance.She would never forget storming out of that meeting and fuming in the back ofthe limo as she headed across Manhattan toward JFK International Airport. Eagerto know who the hell this maniac could be, she pulled out her cell phone to lookat the surprise snapshot she had taken of him.When she saw the photo, she gasped aloud. Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey knew exactly whothis man was. The good news was that he would be very easy to track. The badnews was that he was a genius in his field—a very dangerous person should hechoose to be.Nothing is more creative … nor destructive … than a brilliant mind with apurpose.By the time she arrived at the airport thirty minutes later, she had called herteam and placed this man on the bioterrorism watch lists of every relevantagency on earth—the CIA, the CDC, the ECDC, and all of their sisterorganizations around the world.That’s all I can do until I get back to Geneva, she thought.Exhausted, she carried her overnight bag to check-in and handed the attendanther passport and ticket.“Oh, Dr. Sinskey,” the attendant said with a smile. “A very nice gentleman justleft a message for you.”“I’m sorry?” Elizabeth knew of nobody who had access to her flight information.“He was very tall?” the attendant said. “With green eyes?”Elizabeth literally dropped her bag. He’s here? How?! She spun around, lookingat the faces behind her.“He left already,” the attendant said, “but he wanted us to give you this.” Shehanded Elizabeth a folded piece of stationery.Shaking, Elizabeth unfolded the paper and read the handwritten note.It was a famous quote derived from the work of Dante Alighieri.The darkest places in hellare reserved for thosewho maintain their neutralityin times of moral crisis."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 39MARTA ALVAREZ GAZED tiredly up the steep staircase that ascended from the Hallof the Five Hundred to the second-floor museum.Posso farcela, she told herself. I can do it.As an arts and culture administrator at the Palazzo Vecchio, Marta had climbedthese stairs countless times, but recently, being more than eight monthspregnant, she found the ascent significantly more taxing.“Marta, are you sure we don’t want to take the elevator?” Robert Langdon lookedconcerned and motioned to the small service elevator nearby, which the palazzohad installed for handicapped visitors.Marta smiled appreciatively but shook her head. “As I told you last night, mydoctor says the exercise is good for the baby. Besides, Professor, I know you’reclaustrophobic.”Langdon seemed strangely startled by her comment. “Oh, right. I forgot Imentioned that.”Forgot he mentioned it? Marta puzzled. It was less than twelve hours ago, and wediscussed at length the childhood incident that led to the fear.Last night, while Langdon’s morbidly obese companion, il Duomino, ascended inthe elevator, Langdon had accompanied Marta on foot. En route Langdon had sharedwith her a vivid description of a boyhood fall into an abandoned well that hadleft him with a nearly debilitating fear of cramped spaces.Now, while Langdon’s younger sister bounded ahead, her blond ponytail swingingbehind her, Langdon and Marta ascended methodically, pausing several times soshe could catch her breath. “I’m surprised you want to see the mask again,” shesaid. “Considering all the pieces in Florence, this one seems among the leastinteresting.”Langdon gave a noncommittal shrug. “I’ve returned mainly so Sienna can see it.Thank you, by the way, for letting us in again.”“Of course.”Langdon’s reputation would have sufficed last night to persuade Marta to openthe gallery for him, but the fact that he had been accompanied by il Duominomeant that she really had no choice.Ignazio Busoni—the man known as il Duomino—was something of a celebrity in theFlorence cultural world. The longtime director of the Museo dell’Opera delDuomo, Ignazio oversaw all aspects of Florence’s most prominent historicalsite—Il Duomo—the massive, red-domed cathedral that dominated both the historyand the skyline of Florence. His passion for the landmark, combined with hisbody weight of nearly four hundred pounds and his perpetually red face, resultedin his good-natured nickname of il Duomino—“the little dome.”Marta had no idea how Langdon had become acquainted with il Duomino, but thelatter had called her last evening and said he wanted to bring a guest for aprivate viewing of the Dante death mask. When the mystery guest turned out to bethe famous American symbologist and art historian Robert Langdon, Marta had felta bit of a thrill at having the opportunity to usher these two famous men intothe palazzo’s gallery.Now, as they reached the top of the stairs, Marta placed her hands on her hips,breathing deeply. Sienna was already at the balcony railing, peering back downinto the Hall of the Five Hundred.“My favorite view of the room,” Marta panted. “You get an entirely differentperspective on the murals. I imagine your brother told you about the mysteriousmessage hidden in that one there?” She pointed.Sienna nodded enthusiastically. “Cerca trova.”As Langdon gazed toward the room, Marta watched him. In the light of themezzanine windows, she couldn’t help but notice that Langdon did not look asstriking as he had last night. She liked his new suit, but he needed a shave,and his face seemed pale and weary. Also, his hair, which was thick and fulllast night, looked matted this morning, as if he had yet to take a shower.Marta turned back to the mural before he caught her staring. “We’re standing atnearly the exact height as cerca trova,” Marta said. “You can almost see thewords with the naked eye.”Langdon’s sister seemed indifferent to the mural. “Tell me about Dante’s deathmask. Why is it here at the Palazzo Vecchio?”Like brother, like sister, Marta thought with an inward groan, still perplexedthat the mask held such fascination for them. Then again, the Dante death maskhad a very strange history, especially recently, and Langdon was not the firstto show a nearly maniacal fascination with it. “Well, tell me, what do you knowabout Dante?”The pretty, young blonde shrugged. “Just what everyone learns in school. Dantewas an Italian poet most famous for writing The Divine Comedy, which describeshis imagined journey through hell.”“Partially correct,” Marta replied. “In his poem, Dante eventually escapes hell,continues through purgatory, and finally arrives in paradise. If you ever readThe Divine Comedy, you’ll see his journey is divided into three parts—Inferno,Purgatorio, and Paradiso.” Marta motioned for them to follow her along thebalcony toward the museum entrance. “The reason the mask resides here in thePalazzo Vecchio has nothing to do with The Divine Comedy, though. It has to dowith real history. Dante lived in Florence, and he loved this city as much asanyone could ever love a city. He was a very prominent and powerful Florentine,but there was a shift in political power, and Dante supported the wrong side, sohe was exiled—thrown outside the city walls and told he could never come back.”Marta paused to catch her breath as they approached the museum entrance. Handsagain on her hips, she leaned back and continued talking. “Some people claimthat Dante’s exile is the reason why his death mask looks so sad, but I haveanother theory. I’m a bit of a romantic, and I think the sad face has more to dowith a woman named Beatrice. You see, Dante spent his entire life desperately inlove with a young woman named Beatrice Portinari. But sadly, Beatrice marriedanother man, which meant Dante had to live not only without his belovedFlorence, but also without the woman he so deeply loved. His love for Beatricebecame a central theme in The Divine Comedy.”“Interesting,” Sienna said in a tone that suggested she had not heard a word.“And yet I’m still not clear on why the death mask is kept here inside thepalazzo?”Marta found the young woman’s insistence both unusual and bordering on impolite.“Well,” she continued, walking again, “when Dante died, he was still forbiddento enter Florence, and his body was buried in Ravenna. But because his truelove, Beatrice, was buried in Florence, and because Dante so loved Florence,bringing his death mask here seemed like a kindhearted tribute to the man.”“I see,” Sienna said. “And the choice of this building in particular?”“The Palazzo Vecchio is the oldest symbol of Florence and, in Dante’s time, wasthe heart of the city. In fact, there is a famous painting in the cathedral thatshows Dante standing outside the walled city, banished, while visible in thebackground is his cherished palazzo tower. In many ways, by keeping his deathmask here, we feel like Dante has finally been allowed to come home.”“That’s nice,” Sienna said, finally seeming satisfied. “Thank you.”Marta arrived at the door of the museum and rapped three times. “Sono io, Marta!Buongiorno!”Some keys rattled inside and the door opened. An elderly guard smiled tiredly ather and checked his watch. “È un po’ presto,” he said with a smile. A littleearly.By way of explanation, Marta motioned to Langdon, and the guard immediatelybrightened. “Signore! Bentornato!” Welcome back!“Grazie,” Langdon replied amiably as the guard motioned them all inside.They moved through a small foyer, where the guard disarmed a security system andthen unlocked a second, heavier door. As the door swung open, he stepped aside,sweeping his arm out with a flourish. “Ecco il museo!”Marta smiled her thanks and led her guests inside.The space that made up this museum had originally been designed as governmentoffices, which meant that rather than a sprawling, wide-open gallery space, itwas a labyrinth of moderate-size rooms and hallways, which encircled half of thebuilding.“The Dante death mask is around the corner,” Marta told Sienna. “It’s displayedin a narrow space called l’andito, which is essentially just a walkway betweentwo larger rooms. An antique cabinet against the sidewall holds the mask, whichkeeps it invisible until you draw even with it. For this reason, many visitorswalk right past the mask without even noticing it!”Langdon was striding faster now, eyes straight ahead, as if the mask held somekind of strange power over him. Marta nudged Sienna and whispered, “Obviously,your brother is not interested in any of our other pieces, but as long as you’rehere, you shouldn’t miss our bust of Machiavelli or the Mappa Mundi globe in theHall of Maps.”Sienna nodded politely and kept moving, her eyes also straight ahead. Marta wasbarely able to keep pace. As they reached the third room, she had fallen behinda bit and finally stopped short.“Professor?” she called out, panting. “Perhaps you … want to show your sister …some of the gallery … before we see his mask?”Langdon turned, seeming distracted, as if returning to the present from somefar-off thought. “Excuse me?”Marta breathlessly pointed to a nearby display case. “One of the earliest …printed copies of The Divine Comedy?”When Langdon finally saw Marta dabbing her forehead and trying to catch herbreath, he looked mortified. “Marta, forgive me! Of course, yes, a quick glanceat the text would be wonderful.”Langdon hurried back, permitting Marta to guide them over to the antique case.Inside was a well-worn, leather-bound book, propped open to an ornate titlepage: La Divina Commedia: Dante Alighieri.“Incredible,” Langdon said, sounding surprised. “I recognize the frontispiece. Ididn’t know you had one of the original Numeister editions.”Of course you knew, Marta thought, puzzled. I showed this to you last night!“In the mid–fourteen hundreds,” Langdon said hurriedly to Sienna, “JohannNumeister created the first printed edition of this work. Several hundred copieswere printed, but only about a dozen survived. They’re very rare.”It now seemed to Marta that Langdon had been playing dumb so he could show offfor his younger sibling. It seemed a rather unbecoming immodesty for a professorwhose reputation was one of academic humility.“This copy is on loan from the Laurentian Library,” Marta offered. “If you andRobert have not visited there, you should. They have a spectacular staircasedesigned by Michelangelo, which leads up to the world’s first public readingroom. The books there were actually chained to the seats so nobody could takethem out. Of course, many of the books were the only copies in the world.”“Amazing,” Sienna said, glancing deeper into the museum. “And the mask is thisway?”What’s the hurry? Marta needed another minute to regain her breath. “Yes, butyou might be interested to hear about this.” She pointed across an alcove towarda small staircase that disappeared into the ceiling. “That goes up to a viewingplatform in the rafters where you can actually look down on Vasari’s famoushanging ceiling. I’d be happy to wait here if you’d like to—”“Please, Marta,” Sienna interjected. “I’d love to see the mask. We’re a littleshort on time.”Marta stared at the pretty, young woman, perplexed. She very much disliked thenew fashion of strangers calling each other by their first names. I’m SignoraAlvarez, she silently chided. And I’m doing you a favor.“Okay, Sienna,” Marta said curtly. “The mask is right this way.”Marta wasted no more time offering Langdon and his sister informed commentary asthey made their way through the winding suite of gallery rooms toward the mask.Last night, Langdon and il Duomino had spent nearly a half hour in the narrowandito, viewing the mask. Marta, intrigued by the men’s curiosity for the piece,had asked if their fascination was related somehow to the unusual series ofevents surrounding the mask over this past year. Langdon and il Duomino had beencoy, offering no real answer.Now, as they approached the andito, Langdon began explaining to his sister thesimple process used to create a death mask. His description, Marta was pleasedto hear, was perfectly accurate, unlike his bogus claim that he had notpreviously seen the museum’s rare copy of The Divine Comedy.“Shortly after death,” Langdon described, “the deceased is laid out, and hisface is coated with olive oil. Then a layer of wet plaster is caked onto theskin, covering everything—mouth, nose, eyelids—from the hairline down to theneck. Once hardened, the plaster is easily lifted off and used as a mold intowhich fresh plaster is poured. This plaster hardens into a perfectly detailedreplica of the deceased’s face. The practice was particularly widespread incommemorating eminent persons and men of genius—Dante, Shakespeare, Voltaire,Tasso, Keats—they all had death masks made.”“And here we are at last,” Marta announced as the trio arrived outside theandito. She stepped aside and motioned for Langdon’s sister to enter first. “Themask is in the display case against the wall on your left. We ask that youplease stay outside the stanchions.”“Thank you.” Sienna entered the narrow corridor, walked toward the display case,and peered inside. Her eyes instantly went wide, and she glanced back at herbrother with an expression of dread.Marta had seen the reaction a thousand times; visitors were often jolted andrepulsed by their first glimpse of the mask—Dante’s eerily crinkled visage,hooked nose, and closed eyes.Langdon strode in right behind Sienna, arriving beside her and looking into thedisplay case. He immediately stepped back, his face also registering surprise.Marta groaned. Che esagerato. She followed them in. But when she gazed into thecabinet, she, too, gasped out loud. Oh mio Dio!Marta Alvarez had expected to see Dante’s familiar dead face staring back ather, but instead, all she saw was the red satin interior of the cabinet and thepeg on which the mask normally hung.Marta covered her mouth and stared in horror at the empty display case. Herbreathing accelerated and she grabbed one of the stanchions for support.Finally, she tore her eyes from the bare cabinet and wheeled in the direction ofthe night guards at the main entrance.“La maschera di Dante!” she shouted like a madwoman. “La maschera di Dante èsparita!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 40MARTA ALVAREZ TREMBLED before the empty display cabinet. She hoped the tightnessspreading through her abdomen was panic and not labor pains.The Dante death mask is gone!The two security guards were now on full alert, having arrived in the andito,seen the empty case, and sprung into action. One had rushed to the nearby videocontrol room to access security-camera footage from last night, while the otherhad just finished phoning in the robbery to the police.“La polizia arriverà tra venti minuti!” the guard told Marta as he hung up withthe police.“Venti minuti?!” she demanded. Twenty minutes?! “We’ve had a major art theft!”The guard explained that he had been told most of the city police were currentlyhandling a far more serious crisis and they were trying to find an availableagent to come and take a statement.“Che cosa potrebbe esserci di più grave?!” she ranted. What can be moreserious?!Langdon and Sienna shared an anxious glance, and Marta sensed that her twoguests were suffering from sensory overload. Not surprising. Having simplystopped by for a quick look at the mask, they were now witnessing the aftermathof a major art theft. Last night, somehow, someone had gained access to thegallery and stolen Dante’s death mask.Marta knew there were far more valuable pieces in the museum that could havebeen stolen, so she tried to count her blessings. Nonetheless, this was thefirst theft in this museum’s history. I don’t even know the protocol!Marta felt suddenly weak, and she again reached out to one of the stanchions forsupport.Both gallery guards appeared mystified as they had recounted to Marta theirexact actions and the events of last night: At around ten o’clock, Marta hadentered with il Duomino and Langdon. A short while later, the threesome hadexited together. The guards had relocked the doors, reset the alarm, and as faras they knew, nobody had been in or out of the gallery since that moment.“Impossible!” Marta had scolded in Italian. “The mask was in the cabinet whenthe three of us left last night, so obviously somebody has been inside thegallery since then!”The guards showed their palms, looking bewildered. “Noi non abbiamo vistonessuno!”Now, with the police on the way, Marta moved as rapidly as her pregnant bodypermitted in the direction of the security control room. Langdon and Sienna fellinto step nervously behind her.The security video, Marta thought. That will show us precisely who was in herelast night!image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Three blocks away, on the Ponte Vecchio, Vayentha moved into the shadows as apair of police officers filtered through the crowd, canvassing the area withphotos of Langdon.As the officers neared Vayentha, one of their radios blared—a routine all-pointsbulletin from dispatch. The announcement was brief and in Italian, but Vayenthacaught the gist: Any available officer in the area of the Palazzo Vecchio shouldreport to take a statement at the palazzo museum.The officers barely flinched, but Vayentha’s ears pricked up.Il Museo di Palazzo Vecchio?Last night’s debacle—the fiasco that had all but destroyed her career—hadoccurred in the alleyways just outside the Palazzo Vecchio.The police bulletin continued, in static-filled Italian that was mostlyunintelligible, except for two words that stood out clearly: the name DanteAlighieri.Her body instantly tensed. Dante Alighieri?! Most certainly this was notcoincidence. She spun in the direction of the Palazzo Vecchio and located itscrenellated tower peeking over the rooftops of the nearby buildings.What exactly happened at the museum? she wondered. And when?!The specifics aside, Vayentha had been a field analyst long enough to know thatcoincidence was far less common than most people imagined. The Palazzo Vecchiomuseum … AND Dante? This had to relate to Langdon.Vayentha had suspected all along that Langdon would return to the old city. Itonly made sense—the old city was where Langdon had been last night wheneverything had started to come undone.Now, in the light of day, Vayentha wondered if Langdon had somehow returned tothe area around the Palazzo Vecchio to find whatever it was he was seeking. Shewas certain Langdon had not crossed this bridge into the old city. There wereplenty of other bridges, and yet they seemed to be impossibly far on foot fromthe Boboli Gardens.Beneath her, she noticed a four-man crew shell skimming across the water andpassing under the bridge. The hull read SOCIETÀ CANOT-TIERI FIRENZE / FLORENCEROWING CLUB. The shell’s distinctive red-and-white oars rose and fell in perfectunison.Could Langdon have taken a boat across? It seemed unlikely, and yet somethingtold her the police bulletin regarding the Palazzo Vecchio was a cue she shouldheed.“All cameras out, per favore!” a woman called in accented English.Vayentha turned to see a frilly orange pom-pom waving on a stick as a femaletour guide attempted to herd her brood of duckling tourists across the PonteVecchio.“Above you is Vasari’s largest masterpiece!” the guide exclaimed with practicedenthusiasm, lifting her pom-pom into the air and directing everyone’s gazeupward.Vayentha hadn’t noticed it before, but there appeared to be a second-storystructure that ran across the top of the shops like a narrow apartment.“The Vasari Corridor,” the guide announced. “It’s nearly one kilometer long andprovided the Medici family with a secure passageway between the Pitti Palace andthe Palazzo Vecchio.”Vayentha’s eyes widened as she took in the tunnel-like structure above her.She’d heard of the corridor, but knew very little about it.It leads to the Palazzo Vecchio?“For those rare few with VIP connections,” the guide continued, “they can accessthe corridor even today. It’s a spectacular art gallery that stretches all theway from the Palazzo Vecchio to the northeast corner of the Boboli Gardens.”Whatever the guide said next, Vayentha did not hear.She was already dashing for her motorcycle."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 41THE STITCHES IN Langdon’s scalp were throbbing again as he and Sienna squeezedinside the video control room with Marta and the two guards. The cramped spacewas nothing more than a converted vestment chamber with a bank of whirring harddrives and computer monitors. The air inside was stiflingly hot and smelled ofstale cigarette smoke.Langdon felt the walls closing in around him immediately.Marta took a seat in front of the video monitor, which was already in playbackmode and displayed a grainy black-and-white image of the andito, shot from abovethe door. The time stamp on-screen indicated that the footage had been cued tomidmorning yesterday—precisely twenty-four hours ago—apparently just before themuseum opened and long before the arrival of Langdon and the mysterious ilDuomino that evening.The guard fast-forwarded through the video, and Langdon watched as an influx oftourists flowed rapidly into the andito, moving in hurried jerky motions. Themask itself was not visible from this perspective, but clearly it was still inits display case as tourists repeatedly paused to peer inside or take photosbefore moving on.Please hurry, Langdon thought, knowing the police were on their way. He wonderedif he and Sienna should just excuse themselves and run, but they needed to seethis video: whatever was on this recording would answer a lot of questions aboutwhat the hell was going on.The video playback continued, faster now, and afternoon shadows began movingacross the room. Tourists zipped in and out until finally the crowds began tothin, and then abruptly disappeared entirely. As the time stamp raced past 1700hours, the museum lights went out, and all was quiet.Five P.M. Closing time.“Aumenti la velocità,” Marta commanded, leaning forward in her chair and staringat the screen.The guard let the video race on, the time stamp advancing quickly, untilsuddenly, at around 10 P.M., the lights in the museum flickered back on.The guard quickly slowed the tape back to regular speed.A moment later, the familiar pregnant shape of Marta Alvarez came into view. Shewas followed closely by Langdon, who entered wearing his familiar Harris TweedCamberley jacket, pressed khakis, and his own cordovan loafers. He even saw theglint of his Mickey Mouse watch peeking out from under his sleeve as he walked.There I am … before I got shot.Langdon found it deeply unsettling to watch himself doing things of which he hadabsolutely no recollection. I was here last night … looking at the death mask?Somehow, between then and now, he had managed to lose his clothing, his MickeyMouse watch, and two days of his life.As the video continued, he and Sienna crowded in close behind Marta and theguards for a better view. The silent footage continued, showing Langdon andMarta arriving at the display case and admiring the mask. As they were doingthis, a broad shadow darkened the doorway behind him, and a morbidly obese manshuffled into the frame. He was dressed in a tan suit, carried a briefcase, andbarely fit through the door. His bulging gut made even the pregnant Marta lookslender.Langdon recognized the man at once. Ignazio?!“That’s Ignazio Busoni,” Langdon whispered in Sienna’s ear. “Director of theMuseo dell’Opera del Duomo. An acquaintance of mine for several years. I’d justnever heard him called il Duomino.”“A fitting epithet,” Sienna replied quietly.In years past, Langdon had consulted Ignazio on artifacts and history relatingto Il Duomo—the basilica for which he was responsible—but a visit to the PalazzoVecchio seemed outside Ignazio’s domain. Then again, Ignazio Busoni, in additionto being an influential figure in the Florentine art world, was a Danteenthusiast and scholar.A logical source of information on Dante’s death mask.As Langdon returned his focus to the video, Marta could now be seen waitingpatiently against the rear wall of the andito while Langdon and Ignazio leanedout over the stanchions to get the closest possible look at the mask. As the mencontinued their examination and discussion, the minutes wore on, and Marta couldbe seen discreetly checking her watch behind their backs.Langdon wished the security tape included audio. What were Ignazio and I talkingabout? What are we looking for?!Just then, on-screen, Langdon stepped over the stanchions and crouched downdirectly in front of the cabinet, his face only inches from the glass. Martaimmediately intervened, apparently admonishing him, and Langdon apologeticallystepped back.“Sorry I was so strict,” Marta now said, glancing back at him over her shoulder.“But as I told you, the display case is an antique and extremely fragile. Themask’s owner insists we keep people behind the stanchions. He won’t even permitour staff to open the case without him present.”Her words took a moment to register. The mask’s owner? Langdon had assumed themask was the property of the museum.Sienna looked equally surprised and chimed in immediately. “The museum doesn’town the mask?”Marta shook her head, her eyes now back on the screen. “A wealthy patron offeredto buy Dante’s death mask from our collection and yet leave it on permanentdisplay here. He offered a small fortune, and we happily accepted.”“Hold on,” Sienna said. “He paid for the mask … and let you keep it?”“Common arrangement,” Langdon said. “Philanthropic acquisition—a way for donorsto make major grants to museums without registering the gift as charity.”“The donor was an unusual man,” Marta said. “A genuine scholar of Dante, and yeta bit … how do you say … fanatico?”“Who is he?” Sienna demanded, her casual tone laced with urgency.“Who?” Marta frowned, still staring at the screen. “Well, you probably readabout him in the news recently—the Swiss billionaire Bertrand Zobrist?”For Langdon the name seemed only vaguely familiar, but Sienna grabbed Langdon’sarm and squeezed it hard, looking as if she’d seen a ghost.“Oh, yes …” Sienna said haltingly, her face ashen. “Bertrand Zobrist. Famousbiochemist. Made a fortune in biological patents at a young age.” She paused,swallowing hard. She leaned over and whispered to Langdon. “Zobrist basicallyinvented the field of germ-line manipulation.”Langdon had no idea what germ-line manipulation was, but it had an ominous ring,especially in light of the recent spate of images involving plagues and death.He wondered if Sienna knew so much about Zobrist because she was well read inthe field of medicine … or perhaps because they had both been child prodigies.Do savants follow each other’s work?“I first heard of Zobrist a few years ago,” Sienna explained, “when he made somehighly provocative declarations in the media about population growth.” Shepaused, her face gloomy. “Zobrist is a proponent of the Population ApocalypseEquation.”“I beg your pardon?”“Essentially it’s a mathematical recognition that the earth’s population isrising, people are living longer, and our natural resources are waning. Theequation predicts that the current trend can have no outcome other than theapocalyptic collapse of society. Zobrist has publicly predicted that the humanrace will not survive another century … unless we have some kind of massextinction event.” Sienna sighed heavily and locked eyes with Langdon. “In fact,Zobrist was once quoted as saying that ‘the best thing that ever happened toEurope was the Black Death.’ ”Langdon stared at her in shock. The hair on his neck bristled as, once again,the image of the plague mask flashed through his mind. He had been trying allmorning to resist the notion that his current dilemma related to a deadly plague… but that notion was getting more and more difficult to refute.For Bertrand Zobrist to describe the Black Death as the best thing ever tohappen to Europe was certainly appalling, and yet Langdon knew that manyhistorians had chronicled the long-term socioeconomic benefits of the massextinction that had occurred in Europe in the 1300s. Prior to the plague,overpopulation, famine, and economic hardship had defined the Dark Ages. Thesudden arrival of the Black Death, while horrific, had effectively “thinned thehuman herd,” creating an abundance of food and opportunity, which, according tomany historians, had been a primary catalyst for bringing about the Renaissance.As Langdon pictured the biohazard symbol on the tube that had contained themodified map of Dante’s inferno, a chilling thought struck him: the eerie littleprojector had been created by someone … and Bertrand Zobrist—a biochemist andDante fanatic—now seemed to be a logical candidate.The father of genetic germ-line manipulation. Langdon sensed pieces of thepuzzle now falling into place. Regrettably, the picture coming into focus feltincreasingly frightening.“Fast-forward through this part,” Marta ordered the guard, sounding eager to getpast the real-time playback of Langdon and Ignazio Busoni studying the mask soshe could find out who had broken into the museum and stolen it.The guard hit the fast-forward button, and the time stamp accelerated.Three minutes … six minutes … eight minutes.On-screen, Marta could be seen standing behind the men, shifting her weight withincreasing frequency and repeatedly checking her watch.“I’m sorry we talked so long,” Langdon said. “You look uncomfortable.”“My own fault,” Marta replied. “You both insisted that I should go home and theguards could let you out, but I felt that would be rude.”Suddenly, on-screen, Marta disappeared. The guard slowed the video to normalspeed.“It’s okay,” Marta said. “I remember going to the restroom.”The guard nodded and reached again for the fast-forward button, but before hepressed it, Marta grabbed his arm. “Aspetti!”She cocked her head and stared at the monitor in confusion.Langdon had seen it, too. What in the world?!On-screen, Langdon had just reached into the pocket of his tweed coat andproduced a pair of surgical gloves, which he was now pulling onto his hands.Simultaneously, il Duomino positioned himself behind Langdon, peering down thehallway where Marta had moments earlier trudged off to use the restroom. After amoment the obese man nodded to Langdon in a way that seemed to mean that thecoast was clear.What the hell are we doing?!Langdon watched himself on the video as his gloved hand reached out and foundthe edge of the cabinet door … and then, ever so gently, pulled back until theantique hinge shifted and the door swung slowly open … exposing the Dante deathmask.Marta Alvarez let out a horrified gasp and brought her hands to her face.Sharing Marta’s horror, Langdon watched himself in utter disbelief as he reachedinto the case, gently gripped the Dante death mask with both hands, and liftedit out.“Dio mi salvi!” Marta exploded, heaving herself to her feet and spinning aroundto face Langdon. “Cos’ha fatto? Perché?”Before Langdon could respond, one of the guards whipped out a black Beretta andaimed it directly at Langdon’s chest.Jesus!Robert Langdon stared down the barrel of the guard’s handgun and felt the tinyroom closing in around him. Marta Alvarez was on her feet now, glaring up at himwith an incredulous look of betrayal on her face. On the security monitor behindher, Langdon was now holding the mask up to the light and studying it.“I took it out only for a moment,” Langdon insisted, praying that this was true.“Ignazio assured me you wouldn’t mind!”Marta did not reply. She looked stupefied, clearly trying to imagine why Langdonhad lied to her … and indeed how in the world Langdon could have calmly stood byand let the tape play when he knew what it would reveal.I had no idea I opened the case!“Robert,” Sienna whispered. “Look! You found something!” Sienna remained rivetedon the playback, focusing on getting answers despite their predicament.On-screen, Langdon was now holding the mask up and angling it toward the light,his attention apparently drawn to something of interest on the back of theartifact.From this camera angle, for a split second, the raised mask partially blockedLangdon’s face in such a way that Dante’s dead eyes were aligned with Langdon’s.He remembered the pronouncement—the truth can be glimpsed only through the eyesof death—and felt a chill.Langdon had no idea what he might have been examining on the back of the mask,but at that moment in the video, as he shared his discovery with Ignazio, theobese man recoiled, immediately fumbling for his spectacles and looking again …and again. He began shaking his head vigorously and pacing the andito in anagitated state.Suddenly both men glanced up, clearly having heard something in the hallway—mostlikely Marta returning from the restroom. Hurriedly, Langdon pulled from hispocket a large Ziploc bag, into which he sealed the death mask before gentlyhanding it to Ignazio, who placed it, with seeming reluctance, inside hisbriefcase. Langdon quickly closed the antique glass door on the now-emptydisplay case, and the two men strode briskly up the hall to encounter Martabefore she could discover their theft.Both guards now had their guns trained on Langdon.Marta wobbled on her feet, grasping the table for support. “I don’t understand!”she sputtered. “You and Ignazio Busoni stole the Dante death mask?!”“No!” Langdon insisted, bluffing as best as he could. “We had permission fromthe owner to take the mask out of the building for the night.”“Permission from the owner?” she questioned. “From Bertrand Zobrist!?”“Yes! Mr. Zobrist agreed to let us examine some markings on the back! We metwith him yesterday afternoon!”Marta’s eyes shot daggers. “Professor, I am quite certain you did not meet withBertrand Zobrist yesterday afternoon.”“We most certainly did—”Sienna placed a restraining hand on Langdon’s arm. “Robert …” She gave a grimsigh. “Six days ago, Bertrand Zobrist threw himself off the top of the Badiatower only a few blocks away from here.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 42VAYENTHA HAD ABANDONED her motorcycle just north of the Palazzo Vecchio and wasapproaching on foot along the perimeter of the Piazza della Signoria. As shewound her way through the Loggia dei Lanzi’s outdoor statuary, she could nothelp but notice that all the figures seemed to be enacting a variation on asingle theme: violent displays of male dominance over women.The Rape of the Sabines.The Rape of Polyxena.Perseus Holding the Severed Head of Medusa.Lovely, Vayentha thought, pulling her cap low over her eyes and edging her waythrough the morning crowd toward the entrance of the palace, which was justadmitting the first tourists of the day. From all appearances, it was businessas usual here at the Palazzo Vecchio.No police, Vayentha thought. At least not yet.She zipped her jacket high around her neck, making certain that her weapon wasconcealed, and headed through the entrance. Following signs for Il Museo diPalazzo, she passed through two ornate atriums and then up a massive staircasetoward the second floor.As she climbed, she replayed the police dispatch in her head.Il Museo di Palazzo Vecchio … Dante Alighieri.Langdon has to be here.The signs for the museum led Vayentha into a massive, spectacularly adornedgallery—the Hall of the Five Hundred—where a scattering of tourists mingled,admiring the colossal murals on the walls. Vayentha had no interest in observingthe art here and quickly located another museum sign in the far right-handcorner of the room, pointing up a staircase.As she made her way across the hall, she noticed a group of university kids allgathered around a single sculpture, laughing and taking pictures.The plaque read: Hercules and Diomedes.Vayentha eyed the statues and groaned.The sculpture depicted the two heroes of Greek mythology—both stark naked—lockedin a wrestling match. Hercules was holding Diomedes upside down, preparing tothrow him, while Diomedes was tightly gripping Hercules’ penis, as if to say,“Are you sure you want to throw me?”Vayentha winced. Talk about having someone by the balls.She removed her eyes from the peculiar statue and quickly climbed the stairstoward the museum.She arrived on a high balcony that overlooked the hall. A dozen or so touristswere waiting outside the museum entrance.“Delayed opening,” one cheerful tourist offered, peeking out from behind hiscamcorder.“Any idea why?” she asked.“Nope, but what a great view while we wait!” The man swung his arm out over theexpanse of the Hall of the Five Hundred below.Vayentha walked to the edge and peered at the expansive room beneath them.Downstairs, a lone police officer was just arriving, drawing very littleattention as he moved, without any sense of urgency, across the room toward thestaircase.He’s coming up to take a statement, Vayentha imagined. The man’s lugubrioustrudge up the stairs indicated this was a routine response call—nothing like thechaotic search for Langdon at the Porta Romana.If Langdon is here, why aren’t they swarming the building?Either Vayentha had assumed incorrectly that Langdon was here, or the localpolice and Brüder had not yet put two and two together.As the officer reached the top of the stairs and ambled toward the museumentrance, Vayentha casually turned away and pretended to gaze out a window.Considering her disavowal and the long reach of the provost, she was not takingany chances of being recognized.“Aspetta!” a voice shouted somewhere.Vayentha’s heart skipped a beat as the officer stopped directly behind her. Thevoice, she realized, was coming from his walkie-talkie.“Attendi i rinforzi!” the voice repeated.Wait for support? Vayentha sensed that something had just changed.Just then, outside the window, Vayentha noticed a black object growing larger inthe distant sky. It was flying toward the Palazzo Vecchio from the direction ofthe Boboli Gardens.The drone, Vayentha realized. Brüder knows. And he’s headed this way.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Consortium facilitator Laurence Knowlton was still kicking himself for phoningthe provost. He knew better than to suggest that the provost preview theclient’s video before it was uploaded to the media tomorrow.The content was irrelevant.Protocol is king.Knowlton still recalled the mantra taught to young facilitators when theystarted handling tasks for the organization. Don’t ask. Just task.Reluctantly, he placed the little red memory stick in the queue for tomorrowmorning, wondering what the media would make of the bizarre message. Would theyeven play it?Of course they will. It’s from Bertrand Zobrist.Not only was Zobrist a staggeringly successful figure in the biomedical world,but he was already in the news as a result of his suicide last week. Thisnine-minute video would play like a message from the grave, and its ominouslymacabre quality would make it nearly impossible for people to turn it off.This video will go viral within minutes of its release."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 43MARTA ALVAREZ WAS seething as she stepped out of the cramped video room, havingleft Langdon and his rude little sister at gunpoint with the guards. She marchedover to a window and peered down at the Piazza della Signoria, relieved to see apolice car parked out front.It’s about time.Marta still could not fathom why a man as respected in his profession as RobertLangdon would so blatantly deceive her, take advantage of the professionalcourtesy she had offered, and steal a priceless artifact.And Ignazio Busoni assisted him!? Unthinkable!Intent on giving Ignazio a piece of her mind, Marta pulled out her cell phoneand dialed il Duomino’s office, which was several blocks away at the Museodell’Opera del Duomo.The line rang only once.“Ufficio di Ignazio Busoni,” a familiar woman’s voice answered.Marta was friendly with Ignazio’s secretary but was in no mood for small talk.“Eugenia, sono Marta. Devo parlare con Ignazio.”There was an odd pause on the line and then suddenly the secretary burst intohysterical sobbing.“Cosa succede?” Marta demanded. What’s wrong!?Eugenia tearfully told Marta that she had just arrived at the office to learnthat Ignazio had suffered a massive heart attack last night in an alleyway nearthe Duomo. It was around midnight when he had called for an ambulance, but themedics hadn’t arrived in time. Busoni was dead.Marta’s legs nearly buckled beneath her. This morning she’d heard on the newsthat an unnamed city official had died the previous night, but she neverimagined it was Ignazio.“Eugenia, ascoltami,” Marta urged, trying to remain calm as she quicklyexplained what she had just witnessed on the palazzo video cameras—the Dantedeath mask stolen by Ignazio and Robert Langdon, who was now being held atgunpoint.Marta had no idea what response she expected Eugenia to make, but it mostcertainly was not what she heard.“Roberto Langdon!?” Eugenia demanded. “Sei con Langdon ora?!” You’re withLangdon now?!Eugenia seemed to be missing the point. Yes, but the mask—“Devo parlare con lui!” Eugenia all but shouted. I need to speak to him!image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Inside the security room, Langdon’s head continued to throb as the guards aimedtheir weapons directly at him. Abruptly, the door opened, and Marta Alvarezappeared.Through the open door Langdon heard the distant whine of the drone somewhereoutside, its ominous buzz accompanied by the wail of approaching sirens. Theyfound out where we are.“È arrivata la polizia,” Marta told the guards, sending one of them out to usherthe authorities into the museum. The other remained behind, gun barrel stillaimed at Langdon.To Langdon’s surprise, Marta held out a cell phone to him. “Someone wants tospeak to you,” she said, sounding mystified. “You’ll need to take it out here tohave a connection.”The group migrated from the stuffy control room into the gallery space justoutside, where sunlight poured through large windows offering a spectacular viewof Piazza della Signoria below. Although he was still at gunpoint, Langdon feltrelieved to be out of the enclosed space.Marta motioned him over near the window and handed him the phone.Langdon took it, uncertain, and raised it to his ear. “Yes? This is RobertLangdon.”“Signore,” the woman said in tentative, accented English. “I am EugeniaAntonucci, the secretary of Ignazio Busoni. You and I, we meet yesterday nightwhen you arrive his office.”Langdon recalled nothing. “Yes?”“I’m very sorry to say you this, but Ignazio, he die of heart attack yesterdaynight.”Langdon’s grip tightened on the phone. Ignazio Busoni is dead?!The woman was weeping now, her voice full of sadness. “Ignazio call me before hedie. He leave me a message and tell me to be sure you hear it. I will play itfor you.”Langdon heard some rustling, and moments later, a faint breathless recording ofthe voice of Ignazio Busoni reached his ears.“Eugenia,” the man panted, clearly in pain. “Please be sure Robert Langdon hearsthis message. I’m in trouble. I don’t think I’ll make it back to the office.”Ignazio groaned and there was a long silence. When he began speaking again, hisvoice was weaker. “Robert, I hope you escaped. They’re still after me … and I’m… I’m not well. I’m trying to reach a doctor, but …” There was another longpause, as if il Duomino were mustering his last bit of energy, and then …“Robert, listen carefully. What you seek is safely hidden. The gates are open toyou, but you must hurry. Paradise Twenty-five.” He paused a long moment and thenwhispered, “Godspeed.”Then the message ended.Langdon’s heart raced, and he knew he had just witnessed the final words of adying man. That these words had been directed at him did nothing to relieve hisanxiety. Paradise 25? The gates are open to me? Langdon considered it. Whatgates does he mean?! The only thing that made any sense at all was that Ignaziohad said that the mask was safely hidden.Eugenia came back on the line. “Professor, do you understand this?”“Some of it, yes.”“Is there something I can do?”Langdon considered this question a long moment. “Make sure nobody else hearsthis message.”“Even the police? A detective arrives soon to take my statement.” Langdonstiffened. He looked at the guard who was aiming a gun at him. Quickly, Langdonturned toward the window and lowered his voice, hurriedly whispering, “Eugenia …this will sound strange, but for Ignazio’s sake, I need you to delete thatmessage and do not mention to the police that you spoke to me. Is that clear?The situation is very complicated and—”Langdon felt a gun barrel press into his side and turned to see the armed guard,inches away, holding out his free hand and demanding Marta’s phone.On the line, there was a long pause, and Eugenia finally said, “Mr. Langdon, myboss trusted you … so I will, too.”Then she was gone.Langdon handed the phone back to the guard. “Ignazio Busoni is dead,” he said toSienna. “He died of a heart attack last night after leaving this museum.”Langdon paused. “The mask is safe. Ignazio hid it before he died. And I think heleft me a clue about where to find it.” Paradise 25.Hope flashed in Sienna’s eyes, but when Langdon turned back to Marta, she lookedskeptical.“Marta,” Langdon said. “I can retrieve Dante’s mask for you, but you’ll need tolet us go. Immediately.”Marta laughed out loud. “I will do no such thing! You’re the one who stole themask! The police are arriving—”“Signora Alvarez,” Sienna interrupted loudly. “Mi dispiace, ma non le abbiamodetto la verità.”Langdon did a double take. What is Sienna doing?! He had understood her words.Mrs. Alvarez, I’m sorry, but we have not been honest with you.Marta looked equally startled by Sienna’s words, although much of her shockseemed to be over the fact that Sienna was suddenly speaking fluent, unaccentedItalian.“Innanzitutto, non sono la sorella di Robert Langdon,” Sienna declared in anapologetic tone. First off, I am not Robert Langdon’s sister."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 44MARTA ALVAREZ TOOK an unsteady step backward and folded her arms, studying theyoung blond woman before her.“Mi dispiace,” Sienna continued, still speaking fluent Italian. “Le abbiamomentito su molte cose.” We have lied to you about many things.The guard looked as perplexed as Marta, although he held his position.Sienna spoke rapidly now, still in Italian, telling Marta that she worked at aFlorence hospital where Langdon had arrived the previous night with a bulletwound to the head. She explained that Langdon recalled nothing of the eventsthat had brought him there, and that he was as surprised by the security videoas Marta had been.“Show her your wound,” Sienna ordered Langdon.When Marta saw the stitches beneath Langdon’s matted hair, she sat down on thewindowsill and held her face in her hands for several seconds.In the past ten minutes, Marta had learned not only that the Dante death maskhad been stolen during her watch, but that the two thieves had been a respectedAmerican professor and her trusted Florentine colleague, who was now dead.Furthermore, the young Sienna Brooks, whom Marta had imagined to be thewide-eyed American sister of Robert Langdon, turned out to be a doctor,admitting to a lie … and doing so in fluent Italian.“Marta,” Langdon said, his voice deep and understanding. “I know it must be hardto believe, but I truly don’t remember last night at all. I have no idea whyIgnazio and I took the mask.”Marta sensed from his eyes that he was telling the truth.“I’ll return the mask to you,” Langdon said. “You have my word. But I can’tretrieve it unless you let us go. The situation is complicated. You need to letus go, right away.”Despite wanting the priceless mask returned, Marta had no intention of lettinganyone go. Where are the police?! She looked down at the lone police car in thePiazza della Signoria. It seemed strange that the officers had not yet reachedthe museum. Marta also heard a strange buzzing noise in the distance—it soundedlike someone was using a power saw. And it was getting louder.What is that?Langdon’s tone was beseeching now. “Marta, you know Ignazio. He would never haveremoved the mask without a good reason. There’s a bigger picture here. The ownerof the mask, Bertrand Zobrist, was a very confused man. We think he may beinvolved in something terrible. I don’t have time to explain it all, but I’mbegging you to trust us.”Marta could only stare. None of this seemed to make any sense at all.“Mrs. Alvarez,” Sienna said, fixing Marta with a stony look. “If you care aboutyour future, and that of your baby, then you need to let us leave, right now.”Marta folded her hands protectively across her abdomen, not at all pleased bythe veiled threat to her unborn child.The high-pitched buzz outside was definitely getting louder, and when Martapeered out the window, she couldn’t see the source of the noise, but she did seesomething else.The guard saw it, too, his eyes widening.Down in the Piazza della Signoria, the crowds had parted to make way for a longline of police cars that were arriving without sirens, led by two black vans,which now skidded to a stop outside the palace doors. Soldiers in black uniformsjumped out, carrying large guns, and ran into the palace.Marta felt a surge of fear. Who the hell is that?!The security guard looked equally alarmed.The high-pitched buzzing sound grew suddenly piercing, and Marta withdrew indistress as she glimpsed a small helicopter rising into view just outside thewindow.The machine hovered no more than ten yards away, almost as if it were staring inat the people in the room. It was a small craft, maybe a yard long, with a longblack cylinder mounted on the front. The cylinder was pointed directly at them.“It’s going to shoot!” Sienna shouted. “Sta per sparare! Everybody down! Tutti aterra!” She dropped to her knees beneath the windowsill, and Marta went coldwith terror as she instinctively followed suit. The guard dropped down, too,reflexively aiming his gun at the little machine.From Marta’s awkward crouch below the windowsill, she could see that Langdon wasstill standing, staring at Sienna with an odd look, clearly not believing therewas any danger. Sienna was on the ground for only an instant before she boundedback up, grabbed Langdon by the wrist, and began pulling him in the direction ofthe hallway. An instant later, they were fleeing together toward the mainentrance of the building.The guard spun on his knees and crouched like a sniper—raising his weapon downthe hallway in the direction of the departing duo.“Non spari!” Marta ordered him. “Non possono scappare.” Don’t shoot! They can’tpossibly escape!Langdon and Sienna disappeared around a corner, and Marta knew it would be onlya matter of seconds before the duo collided with the authorities coming in theother way.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]“Faster!” Sienna urged, rushing with Langdon back the way they’d come in. Shewas hoping they could make it to the main entrance before running into thepolice head-on, but she now realized the chances of this were close to zero.Langdon apparently had similar doubts. Without warning, he skidded to a fullstop in a wide intersection of hallways. “We’ll never make it out this way.”“Come on!” Sienna motioned urgently for him to follow. “Robert, we can’t juststand here!”Langdon seemed distracted, gazing to his left, down a short corridor thatappeared to dead-end in a small, dimly lit chamber. The walls of the room werecovered with antique maps, and at the center of the room stood a massive ironglobe. Langdon eyed the huge metal sphere and began nodding slowly, and thenmore vigorously.“This way,” Langdon declared, dashing off toward the iron globe.Robert! Sienna followed against her better judgment. The corridor clearly leddeeper into the museum, away from the exit.“Robert?” she gasped, finally catching up to him. “Where are you taking us?!”“Through Armenia,” he replied.“What?!”“Armenia,” Langdon repeated, his eyes dead ahead. “Trust me.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]One story below, hidden among frightened tourists on the balcony of the Hall ofthe Five Hundred, Vayentha kept her head down as Brüder’s SRS team thunderedpast her into the museum. Downstairs, the sound of slamming doors resonatedthrough the hall as police sealed the area.If Langdon were indeed here, he was trapped.Unfortunately, Vayentha was, too."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 45WITH ITS WARM oak wainscoting and coffered wooden ceilings, the Hall ofGeographical Maps feels a world away from the stark stone and plaster interiorof the Palazzo Vecchio. Originally the building’s cloakroom, this grand spacecontains dozens of closets and cabinets once used to store the portable assetsof the grand duke. On this day, the walls were adorned with maps—fifty-threeilluminations hand-painted on leather—depicting the world as it was known in the1550s.The hall’s dramatic collection of cartography is dominated by the presence of amassive globe that stands in the center of the room. Known as the Mappa Mundi,the six-foot-tall sphere had been the largest rotating globe of its era and wassaid to spin almost effortlessly with just the touch of a finger. Today theglobe serves as more of a final stop for tourists who have threaded their waythrough the long succession of gallery rooms and reached a dead end, where theycircle the globe and depart the way they came.Langdon and Sienna arrived breathless in the Hall of Maps. Before them, theMappa Mundi rose majestically, but Langdon didn’t even glance at it, his eyesmoving instead to the outer walls of the room.“We need to find Armenia!” Langdon said. “The map of Armenia!”Clearly nonplussed by his request, Sienna hurried off to the room’s right-handwall in search of a map of Armenia.Langdon immediately began a similar search along the left-hand wall, tracing hisway around the perimeter of the room.Arabia, Spain, Greece …Each country was portrayed in remarkable detail, considering that the drawingshad been made more than five hundred years ago, at a time when much of the worldhad yet to be mapped or explored.Where is Armenia?Compared to his usually vivid eidetic memories, Langdon’s recollections of his“secret passages tour” here several years ago felt cloudy, due in no small partto the second glass of Gaja Nebbiolo he’d enjoyed with lunch prior to the tour.Fittingly, the word nebbiolo meant “little fog.” Even so, Langdon now distinctlyrecalled being shown a single map in this room—Armenia—a map that possessed aunique property.I know it’s in here, Langdon thought, continuing to scan the seemingly endlessline of maps.“Armenia!” Sienna announced. “Over here!”Langdon spun toward where she was standing in the deep right-hand corner of theroom. He rushed over, and Sienna pointed to the map of Armenia with anexpression that seemed to say, “We found Armenia—so what?”Langdon knew they didn’t have time for explanations. Instead, he simply reachedout, grabbed the map’s massive wooden frame, and heaved it toward him. Theentire map swung into the room, along with a large section of the wall andwainscoting, revealing a hidden passageway.“All right, then,” Sienna said, sounding impressed. “Armenia it is.”Without hesitation, Sienna hurried through the opening, moving fearlessly intothe dim space beyond. Langdon followed her and quickly pulled the wall closedbehind them.Despite his foggy recollections of the secret passages tour, Langdon recalledthis passageway clearly. He and Sienna had just passed, as it were, through thelooking glass into the Palazzo Invisibile—the clandestine world that existedbehind the walls of the Palazzo Vecchio—a secret domain that had been accessiblesolely to the then-reigning duke and those closest to him.Langdon paused a moment inside the doorway and took in their new surroundings—apale stone hallway lit only by faint natural light that filtered through aseries of leaded windows. The passageway descended fifty yards or so to a woodendoor.He turned now to his left, where a narrow ascending staircase was blocked by achain swag. A sign above the stairs warned: USCITA VIETATA.Langdon headed for the stairs.“No!” Sienna warned. “It says ‘No Exit.’ ”“Thanks,” Langdon said with a wry smile. “I can read the Italian.”He unhooked the chain swag, carried it back to the secret door, and quickly usedit to immobilize the rotating wall—threading the chain through the door handleand around a nearby fixture so the door could not be pulled open from the otherside.“Oh,” Sienna said sheepishly. “Good thinking.”“It won’t keep them out for long,” Langdon said. “But we won’t need much time.Follow me.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]When the map of Armenia finally crashed open, Agent Brüder and his men streameddown the narrow corridor in pursuit, heading for the wooden door at the far end.When they burst through, Brüder felt a blast of cold air hit him head-on, andwas momentarily blinded by bright sunlight.He had arrived on an exterior walkway, which threaded along the rooftop of thepalazzo. His eye traced the path, which led directly to another door, some fiftyyards away, and reentered the building.Brüder glanced to the left of the walkway, where the high, vaulted roof of theHall of the Five Hundred rose like a mountain. Impossible to traverse. Brüderturned now to his right, where the walkway was bordered by a sheer cliff thatplummeted down into a deep light well. Instant death.His eyes refocused straight ahead. “This way!”Brüder and his men dashed along the walkway toward the second door while thesurveillance drone circled like a vulture overhead.When Brüder and his men burst through the doorway, they all slid to an abruptstop, nearly piling up on one another.They were standing in a tiny stone chamber that had no exit other than the doorthrough which they had just come. A lone wooden desk stood against the wall.Overhead, the grotesque figures depicted in the chamber’s ceiling frescoesseemed to stare down at them mockingly.It was a dead end.One of Brüder’s men hurried over and scanned the informational placard on thewall. “Hold on,” he said. “This says there’s a finestra in here—some kind ofsecret window?”Brüder looked around but saw no secret window. He marched over and read theplacard himself.Apparently this space had once been the private study of Duchess Bianca Cappelloand included a secret window—una finestra segrata—through which Bianca couldcovertly watch her husband deliver speeches down below in the Hall of the FiveHundred.Brüder’s eyes searched the room again, now locating a small lattice-coveredopening discreetly hidden in the sidewall. Did they escape through there?He stalked over and examined the opening, which appeared to be too small forsomeone of Langdon’s size to get through. Brüder pressed his face to the gridand peered through, confirming for certain that nobody had escaped this way; onthe other side of the lattice was a sheer drop, straight down several stories,to the floor of the Hall of the Five Hundred.So where the hell did they go?!As Brüder turned back in to the tiny stone chamber, he felt all of the day’sfrustration mounting within him. In a rare moment of unrestrained emotion, AgentBrüder threw back his head and let out a bellow of rage.The noise was deafening in the tiny space.Far below, in the Hall of the Five Hundred, tourists and police officers allspun and stared up at the latticed opening high on the wall. From the sounds ofthings, the duchess’s secret study was now being used to cage a wild animal.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Sienna Brooks and Robert Langdon stood in total darkness.Minutes earlier, Sienna had watched Langdon cleverly use the chain to seal therotating map of Armenia, then turn and flee.To her surprise, however, instead of heading down the corridor, Langdon had goneup the steep staircase that had been marked USCITA VIETATA.“Robert!” she whispered in confusion. “The sign said ‘No Exit’! And besides, Ithought we wanted to go down!”“We do,” Langdon said, glancing over his shoulder. “But sometimes you need to goup … to go down.” He gave her an encouraging wink. “Remember Satan’s navel?”What is he talking about? Sienna bounded after him, feeling lost.“Did you ever read Inferno?” Langdon asked.Yes … but I think I was seven.An instant later, it dawned on her. “Oh, Satan’s navel!” she said. “Now Iremember.”It had taken a moment, but Sienna now realized that Langdon was referring to thefinale of Dante’s Inferno. In these cantos, in order to escape hell, Dante hasto climb down the hairy stomach of the massive Satan, and when he reachesSatan’s navel—the alleged center of the earth—the earth’s gravity suddenlyswitches directions, and Dante, in order to continue climbing down to purgatory… suddenly has to start climbing up.Sienna remembered little of the Inferno other than her disappointment inwitnessing the absurd actions of gravity at the center of the earth; apparentlyDante’s genius did not include a grasp of the physics of vector forces.They reached the top of the stairs, and Langdon opened the lone door they foundthere; on it was written: SALA DEI MODELLI DI ARCHITETTURA.Langdon ushered her inside, closing and bolting the door behind them.The room was small and plain, containing a series of cases that displayed woodenmodels of Vasari’s architectural designs for the interior of the palazzo. Siennabarely noticed the models. She did, however, notice that the room had no doors,no windows, and, as advertised … no exit.“In the mid-1300s,” Langdon whispered, “the Duke of Athens assumed power in thepalace and built this secret escape route in case he was attacked. It’s calledthe Duke of Athens Stairway, and it descends to a tiny escape hatch on a sidestreet. If we can get there, nobody will see us exit.” He pointed to one of themodels. “Look. See it there on the side?”He brought me up here to show me models?Sienna shot an anxious glance at the miniature and saw the secret staircasedescending all the way from the top of the palace down to street level,stealthily hidden between the inner and outer walls of the building.“I can see the stairs, Robert,” Sienna said testily, “but they are on thecomplete opposite side of the palace. We’ll never get over there!”“A little faith,” he said with a lopsided grin.A sudden crash emanating from downstairs told them that the map of Armenia hadjust been breached. They stood stone-still as they listened to the footfalls ofsoldiers departing down the corridor, none of them ever thinking that theirquarry would climb higher still … especially up a tiny staircase marked NO EXIT.When the sounds below had subsided, Langdon strode with confidence across theexhibit room, snaking through the displays, heading directly for what lookedlike a large cupboard in the far wall. The cupboard was about one yard squareand positioned three feet off the floor. Without hesitation, Langdon grabbed thehandle and heaved open the door.Sienna recoiled with surprise.The space within appeared to be a cavernous void … as if the cupboard door werea portal into another world. Beyond was only blackness.“Follow me,” Langdon said.He grabbed a lone flashlight that was hanging on the wall beside the opening.Then, with surprising agility and strength, the professor hoisted himself upthrough the opening and disappeared into the rabbit hole."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 46LA SOFFITTA, LANGDON thought. The most dramatic attic on earth.The air inside the void smelled musty and ancient, as if centuries of plasterdust had now become so fine and light that it refused to settle and instead hungsuspended in the atmosphere. The vast space creaked and groaned, giving Langdonthe sense that he had just climbed into the belly of a living beast.Once he had found solid footing on a broad horizontal truss chord, he raised hisflashlight, letting the beam pierce the darkness.Spreading out before him was a seemingly endless tunnel, crisscrossed by awooden web of triangles and rectangles formed by the intersections of posts,beams, chords, and other structural elements that made up the invisible skeletonof the Hall of the Five Hundred.This enormous attic space was one Langdon had viewed during his Nebbiolo-foggedsecret passages tour a few years ago. The cupboardlike viewing window had beencut in the wall of the architectural-model room so visitors could inspect themodels of the truss work and then peer through the opening with a flashlight andsee the real thing.Now that Langdon was actually inside the garret, he was surprised by how muchthe truss architecture resembled that of an old New England barn—traditionalking post-and-strut assembly with “Jupiter’s arrow point” connections.Sienna had also climbed through the opening and now steadied herself on the beambeside him, looking disoriented. Langdon swung the flashlight back and forth toshow her the unusual landscape.From this end, the view down the length of the garret was like peering through along line of isosceles triangles that telescoped into the distance, extendingout toward some distant vanishing point. Beneath their feet, the garret had nofloorboards, and its horizontal supporting beams were entirely exposed,resembling a series of massive railroad ties.Langdon pointed straight down the long shaft, speaking in hushed tones. “Thisspace is directly over the Hall of the Five Hundred. If we can get to the otherend, I know how to reach the Duke of Athens Stairway.”Sienna cast a skeptical eye into the labyrinth of beams and supports thatstretched before them. The only apparent way to advance through the garret wouldbe to jump between the struts like kids on a train track. The struts werelarge—each consisting of numerous beams strapped together with wide iron claspsinto a single powerful sheaf—plenty large enough to balance on. The challenge,however, was that the separation between the struts was much too far to leapacross safely.“I can’t possibly jump between those beams,” Sienna whispered.Langdon doubted he could either, and falling would be certain death. He aimedthe flashlight down through the open space between the struts.Eight feet below them, suspended by iron rods, hung a dusty horizontal expanse—afloor of sorts—which extended as far as they could see. Despite its appearanceof solidity, Langdon knew the floor consisted primarily of stretched fabriccovered in dust. This was the “back side” of the Hall of the Five Hundred’ssuspended ceiling—a sprawling expanse of wooden lacunars that framed thirty-nineVasari canvases, all mounted horizontally in a kind of patchwork-quiltconfiguration.Sienna pointed down to the dusty expanse beneath them. “Can we climb down thereand walk across?”Not unless you want to fall through a Vasari canvas into the Hall of the FiveHundred.“Actually, there’s a better way,” Langdon said calmly, not wanting to frightenher. He began moving down the strut toward the central backbone of the garret.On his previous visit, in addition to peering through the viewing window in theroom of architectural models, Langdon had explored the garret on foot, enteringthrough a doorway at the other end of the attic. If his wine-impaired memoryserved him, a sturdy boardwalk ran along the central spine of the garret,providing tourists access to a large viewing deck in the center of the space.However, when Langdon arrived at the center of the strut, he found a boardwalkthat in no way resembled the one he recalled from his tour.How much Nebbiolo did I drink that day?Rather than a sturdy, tourist-worthy structure, he was looking at a hodgepodgeof loose planks that had been laid perpendicularly across the beams to create arudimentary catwalk—more of a tightrope than a bridge.Apparently, the sturdy tourist walkway that originated at the other end extendedonly as far as the central viewing platform. From there, the tourists evidentlyretraced their steps. This jerry-rigged balance beam that Langdon and Sienna nowfaced was most likely installed so engineers could service the remaining atticspace at this end.“Looks like we’re walking the plank,” Langdon said, eyeing the narrow boardswith uncertainty.Sienna shrugged, unfazed. “No worse than Venice in flood season.”Langdon realized she had a point. On his most recent research trip to Venice,St. Mark’s Square had been under a foot of water, and he had walked from theHotel Danieli to the basilica on wooden planks propped between cinder blocks andinverted buckets. Of course, the prospect of possibly getting one’s loafers wetwas a far cry from that of plunging through a Renaissance masterpiece to one’sdeath.Pushing the thought from his mind, Langdon stepped out onto the narrow boardwith a feigned self-assurance that he hoped would calm any worries Sienna mightsecretly be harboring. Nonetheless, despite his confident exterior, his heartwas pounding as he moved across the first plank. As he neared the middle, theplank bowed beneath his weight, creaking ominously. He pressed on, faster now,finally reaching the other side and the relative safety of the second strut.Exhaling, Langdon turned to shine the light for Sienna and also offer anycoaxing words she might need. She apparently needed none. As soon as his beamilluminated the plank, she was skimming along its length with remarkabledexterity. The board barely bent beneath her slender body, and within secondsshe had joined him on the other side.Encouraged, Langdon turned back and headed out across the next plank. Siennawaited until he had crossed and could turn around and shine the light for her,and then she followed, staying right with him. Settling into a steady rhythm,they pressed on—two figures moving one after the other by the light of a singleflashlight. From somewhere beneath them, the sound of police walkie-talkiescrackled up through the thin ceiling. Langdon permitted himself a faint smile.We’re hovering above the Hall of the Five Hundred, weightless and invisible.“So, Robert,” Sienna whispered. “You said Ignazio told you where to find themask?”“He did … but in a kind of code.” Langdon quickly explained that Ignazio hadapparently not wanted to blurt out the mask’s location on the answering machine,and so he had shared the information in a more cryptic manner. “He referencedparadise, which I assume is an allusion to the final section of The DivineComedy. His exact words were ‘Paradise Twenty-five.’ ”Sienna glanced up. “He must mean Canto Twenty-five.”“I agree,” Langdon said. A canto was the rough equivalent of a chapter, the wordharkening back to the oral tradition of “singing” epic poems. The Divine Comedycontained precisely one hundred cantos in all, divided into three sections.Inferno 1–34Purgatorio 1–33Paradiso 1–33Paradise Twenty-five, Langdon thought, wishing his eidetic memory were strongenough to recall the entire text. Not even close—we need to find a copy of thetext.“There’s more,” Langdon continued. “The last thing Ignazio said to me was: ‘Thegates are open to you, but you must hurry.’ ” He paused, glancing back atSienna. “Canto Twenty-five probably makes reference to a specific location herein Florence. Apparently, someplace with gates.”Sienna frowned. “But this city probably has dozens of gates.”“Yes, which is why we need to read Canto Twenty-five of Paradise.” He gave her ahopeful smile. “You don’t, by any chance, know the entire Divine Comedy byheart, do you?”She gave him a dumb look. “Fourteen thousand lines of archaic Italian that Iread as a kid?” She shook her head. “You’re the one with the freakish memory,Professor. I’m just a doctor.”As they pressed on, Langdon found it sad somehow that Sienna, even after allthey’d been through together, apparently still preferred to withhold the truthabout her exceptional intellect. She’s just a doctor? Langdon had to chuckle.Most humble doctor on earth, he thought, recalling the clippings he’d read abouther special skills—skills that, unfortunately but not surprisingly, did notinclude total recall of one of history’s longest epic poems.In silence, they continued on, crossing several more beams. Finally, up aheadLangdon saw a heartening shape in the darkness. The viewing platform! Theprecarious planking on which they were walking led directly to a much sturdierstructure with guardrails. If they climbed onto the platform, they couldcontinue on along the walkway until they exited the garret through a doorway,which, as Langdon recalled, was very close to the Duke of Athens Stairway.As they neared the platform, Langdon glanced down at the ceiling suspended eightfeet below. So far all the lunettes beneath them had been similar. The upcominglunette, however, was massive—far larger than the others.The Apotheosis of Cosimo I, Langdon mused.This vast, circular lunette was Vasari’s most precious painting—the centrallunette in the entire Hall of the Five Hundred. Langdon often showed slides ofthis work to his students, pointing out its similarities to The Apotheosis ofWashington in the U.S. Capitol—a humble reminder that fledgling America hadadopted far more from Italy than merely the concept of a republic.Today, however, Langdon was more interested in hurrying past the Apotheosis thanin studying it. As he hastened his pace, he turned his head ever so slightly towhisper back to Sienna that they were nearly there.As he did so, his right foot missed the center of the plank and his borrowedloafer landed half off the edge. His ankle rolled, and Langdon lurched forward,half stumbling, half running, trying to make a quick stutter step to regain hisbalance.But it was too late.His knees hit the plank hard, and his hands strained desperately forward, tryingto reach the crossing strut. The flashlight went clattering into the dark spacebeneath them, landing on the canvas, which caught it like a net. Langdon’s legspumped, barely propelling him to safety on the next strut as the plank fell awaybeneath him, landing with a crash eight feet below on the wooden lacunarsurrounding the canvas of Vasari’s Apotheosis.The sound echoed through the garret.Horrified, Langdon scrambled to his feet and turned back toward Sienna.In the dim glow of the abandoned flashlight, which lay on the canvas below,Langdon could see that Sienna was standing on the strut behind him, now trapped,with no way across. Her eyes conveyed what Langdon already knew. The noise ofthe falling plank had almost certainly given them away.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Vayentha’s eyes bolted upward to the ornate ceiling.“Rats in the attic?” the man with the camcorder joked nervously as the soundreverberated down.Big rats, Vayentha thought, gazing up at the circular painting in the center ofthe hall’s ceiling. A small cloud of dust was now filtering down from betweenthe lacunars, and Vayentha could swear she saw a slight bulge in the canvas …almost as if someone were pushing on it from the other side.“Maybe one of the officers dropped his gun off the viewing platform,” the mansaid, eyeing the lump in the painting. “What do you think they’re looking for?All this activity is very exciting.”“A viewing platform?” Vayentha demanded. “People can actually go up there?”“Sure.” He motioned to the museum entrance. “Just inside that door is a doorthat leads up to a catwalk in the attic. You can see Vasari’s truss work. It’sincredible.”Brüder’s voice suddenly echoed again across the Hall of the Five Hundred. “Sowhere the hell did they go?!”His words, like his anguished yell a little earlier, had emanated from behind alattice grate positioned high on the wall to Vayentha’s left. Brüder wasapparently in a room behind the grate … a full story beneath the room’s ornateceiling.Vayentha’s eyes climbed again to the bulge in the canvas overhead.Rats in the attic, she thought. Trying to find a way out.She thanked the man with the camcorder and drifted quickly toward the museumentrance. The door was closed, but with all the officers running in and out, shesuspected that it was unlocked.Sure enough, her instincts were correct."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 47OUTSIDE IN THE piazza, amid the chaos of arriving police, a middle-aged manstood in the shadows of the Loggia dei Lanzi, where he had been observing theactivity with great interest. The man wore Plume Paris spectacles, a paisleynecktie, and a tiny gold stud in one ear.As he watched the commotion, he caught himself scratching at his neck again. Theman had developed a rash overnight, which seemed to be getting worse,manifesting in small pustules on his jawline, neck, cheeks, and over his eyes.When he glanced down at his fingernails, he saw they were bloody. He took outhis handkerchief and wiped his fingers, also dabbing the bloody pustules on hisneck and cheeks.When he had cleaned himself up, he returned his gaze to the two black vansparked outside the palazzo. The closest van contained two people in thebackseat.One was an armed soldier in black.The other was an older, but very beautiful silver-haired woman wearing a blueamulet.The soldier looked as if he were preparing a hypodermic syringe.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Inside the van, Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey gazed absently out at the palazzo,wondering about how this crisis had deteriorated to such an extent.“Ma’am,” a deep voice said beside her.She turned groggily to the soldier accompanying her. He was gripping her forearmand holding up a syringe. “Just be still.”The sharp stab of a needle pierced her flesh.The soldier completed the injection. “Now go back to sleep.”As she closed her eyes, she could have sworn she saw a man studying her from theshadows. He wore designer glasses and a preppie necktie. His face was rashy andred. For a moment she thought she knew him, but when she opened her eyes foranother look, the man had disappeared."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 48IN THE DARKNESS of the garret, Langdon and Sienna were now separated by atwenty-foot expanse of open air. Eight feet beneath them, the fallen plank hadcome to rest across the wooden framing that supported the canvas bearingVasari’s Apotheosis. The large flashlight, still glowing, was resting on thecanvas itself, creating a small indentation, like a stone on a trampoline.“The plank behind you,” Langdon whispered. “Can you drag it across to reach thisstrut?”Sienna eyed the plank. “Not without the other end falling into the canvas.”Langdon had feared as much; the last thing they needed now was to send atwo-by-six crashing through a Vasari canvas.“I’ve got an idea,” Sienna said, now moving sideways along the strut, headingfor the sidewall. Langdon followed on his beam, the footing becoming moretreacherous with each step as they ventured away from the flashlight beam. Bythe time they reached the sidewall, they were almost entirely in darkness.“Down there,” Sienna whispered, pointing into the obscurity below them. “At theedge of the frame. It’s got to be mounted to the wall. It should hold me.”Before Langdon could protest, Sienna was climbing down off the strut, using aseries of supporting beams as a ladder. She eased herself down onto the edge ofthe wooden lacunar. It creaked once, but held. Then, inching along the wall,Sienna began moving in Langdon’s direction as if she were inching across theledge of a high building. The lacunar creaked again.Thin ice, Langdon thought. Stay near shore.As Sienna reached the halfway point, approaching the strut on which he stood inthe darkness, Langdon felt a sudden renewed hope that they might indeed get outof here in time.Suddenly, somewhere in the darkness ahead, a door slammed and he heardfast-moving footsteps approaching along the walkway. The beam of a flashlightnow appeared, sweeping the area, getting closer every second. Langdon felt hishopes sink. Someone was coming their way—moving along the main walkway andcutting off their escape route.“Sienna, keep going,” he whispered, reacting on instinct. “Continue the entirelength of the wall. There’s an exit at the far end. I’ll run interference.”“No!” Sienna whispered urgently. “Robert, come back!”But Langdon was already on the move, heading back along the strut toward thecentral spine of the garret, leaving Sienna in the darkness, inching across thesidewall, eight feet below him.When Langdon arrived at the center of the garret, a faceless silhouette with aflashlight had just arrived on the raised viewing platform. The person halted atthe low guardrail and aimed the flashlight beam down into Langdon’s eyes.The glare was blinding, and Langdon immediately raised his arms in surrender. Hecould not have felt more vulnerable—balanced high above the Hall of the FiveHundred, blinded by a bright light.Langdon waited for a gunshot or for an authoritative command, but there was onlysilence. After a moment the beam swung away from his face and began probing thedarkness behind him, apparently looking for something … or someone else. As thebeam left his eyes, Langdon could just make out the silhouette of the person nowblocking his escape route. It was a woman, lean and dressed all in black. He hadno doubt that beneath her baseball cap was a head of spiked hair.Langdon’s muscles tightened instinctively as his mind flooded with images of Dr.Marconi dying on the hospital floor.She found me. She’s here to finish the job.Langdon flashed on an image of Greek free divers swimming deep into a tunnel,far past the point of no return, and then colliding with a stony dead end.The assassin swung her flashlight beam back down into Langdon’s eyes.“Mr. Langdon,” she whispered. “Where is your friend?”Langdon felt a chill. This killer is here for both of us.Langdon made a show of glancing away from Sienna, over his shoulder into thedarkness from which they’d come. “She has nothing to do with this. You want me.”Langdon prayed that Sienna was now making progress along the wall. If she couldsneak beyond the viewing platform, she could then quietly cross back to thecentral boardwalk, behind the spike-haired woman, and move toward the door.The assassin again raised her light and scanned the empty garret behind him.With the glare momentarily out of his eyes, Langdon caught a sudden glimpse of aform in the darkness behind her.Oh God, no!Sienna was indeed making her way across a strut in the direction of the centralboardwalk, but unfortunately, she was only ten yards behind their attacker.Sienna, no! You’re too close! She’ll hear you!The beam returned to Langdon’s eyes again.“Listen carefully, Professor,” the assassin whispered. “If you want to live, Isuggest you trust me. My mission has been terminated. I have no reason to harmyou. You and I are on the same team now, and I may know how to help you.”Langdon was barely listening, his thoughts focused squarely on Sienna, who wasnow faintly visible in profile, climbing deftly up onto the walkway behind theviewing platform, entirely too close to the woman with the gun.Run! he willed her. Get the hell out of here!Sienna, however, to Langdon’s alarm, held her ground, crouching low in theshadows and watching in silence.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Vayentha’s eyes probed the darkness behind Langdon. Where the hell did she go?Did they separate?Vayentha had to find a way to keep the fleeing couple out of Brüder’s hands.It’s my only hope.“Sienna?!” Vayentha ventured in a throaty whisper. “If you can hear me, listencarefully. You do not want to be captured by the men downstairs. They will notbe lenient. I know an escape route. I can help you. Trust me.”“Trust you?” Langdon challenged, his voice suddenly loud enough that anyonenearby could hear him. “You’re a killer!”Sienna is nearby, Vayentha realized. Langdon is talking to her … trying to warnher.Vayentha tried again. “Sienna, the situation is complicated, but I can get youout of here. Consider your options. You’re trapped. You have no choice.”“She has a choice,” Langdon called out loudly. “And she’s smart enough to run asfar from you as possible.”“Everything’s changed,” Vayentha insisted. “I have no reason to hurt either ofyou.”“You killed Dr. Marconi! And I’m guessing you’re also the one who shot me in thehead!”Vayentha knew that the man was never going to believe she had no intention ofkilling him.The time for talking is over. There’s nothing I can say to convince him.Without hesitation, she reached into her leather jacket and extracted thesilenced handgun.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Motionless in the shadows, Sienna remained crouched on the walkway no more thanten yards behind the woman who had just confronted Langdon. Even in the dark,the woman’s silhouette was unmistakable. To Sienna’s horror, she was brandishingthe same weapon she had used on Dr. Marconi.She’s going to fire, Sienna knew, sensing the woman’s body language.Sure enough, the woman took two threatening steps toward Langdon, stopping atthe low railing that enclosed the viewing platform above Vasari’s Apotheosis.The assassin was now as close to Langdon as she could get. She raised the gunand pointed it directly at Langdon’s chest.“This will only hurt for an instant,” she said, “but it’s my only choice.”Sienna reacted on instinct.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]The unexpected vibration in the boards beneath Vayentha’s feet was just enoughto cause her to turn slightly as she was firing. Even as her weapon discharged,she knew it was no longer pointed at Langdon.Something was approaching behind her.Approaching fast.Vayentha spun in place, swinging her weapon 180 degrees toward her attacker, anda flash of blond hair glinted in the darkness as someone collided with Vayenthaat full speed. The gun hissed again, but the person had crouched below barrellevel in order to apply a forceful upward body check.Vayentha’s feet left the floor and her midsection crashed hard into the lowrailing of the viewing platform. As her torso was propelled out over therailing, she flailed her arms, trying to grab onto anything to stop her fall,but it was too late. She went over the edge.Vayentha fell through the darkness, bracing herself for the collision with thedusty floor that lay eight feet beneath the platform. Strangely, though, herlanding was softer than she’d imagined … as if she had been caught by a clothhammock, which now sagged beneath her weight.Disoriented, Vayentha lay on her back and stared up at her attacker. SiennaBrooks was looking down at her over the railing. Stunned, Vayentha opened hermouth to speak, but suddenly, just beneath her, there was a loud ripping sound.The cloth that was supporting her weight tore open.Vayentha was falling again.This time she fell for three very long seconds, during which she found herselfstaring upward at a ceiling that was covered with beautiful paintings. Thepainting directly above her—a massive circular canvas depicting Cosimo Iencircled by cherubs on a heavenly cloud—now showed a jagged dark tear that cutthrough its center.Then, with a sudden crash, Vayentha’s entire world vanished into blackness.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]High above, frozen in disbelief, Robert Langdon peered through the tornApotheosis into the cavernous space below. On the stone floor of the Hall of theFive Hundred, the spike-haired woman lay motionless, a dark pool of bloodquickly spreading from her head. She still had the gun clutched in her hand.Langdon raised his eyes to Sienna, who was also staring down, transfixed by thegrim scene below. Sienna’s expression was one of utter shock. “I didn’t mean to…”“You reacted on instinct,” Langdon whispered. “She was about to kill me.”From down below, shouts of alarm filtered up through the torn canvas.Gently, Langdon guided Sienna away from the railing. “We need to keep moving.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 49IN THE SECRET study of Duchess Bianca Cappello, Agent Brüder had heard asickening thud followed by a growing commotion in the Hall of the Five Hundred.He rushed to the grate in the wall and peered through it. The scene on theelegant stone floor below took him several seconds to process.The pregnant museum administrator had arrived beside him at the grate,immediately covering her mouth in mute terror at the sight below—a crumpledfigure surrounded by panicked tourists. As the woman’s gaze shifted slowlyupward to the ceiling of the Hall of the Five Hundred, she let out a painedwhimper. Brüder looked up, following her gaze to a circular ceiling panel—apainted canvas with a large tear across the center.He turned to the woman. “How do we get up there!?”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]At the other end of the building, Langdon and Sienna descended breathlessly fromthe attic and burst through a doorway. Within a matter of seconds, Langdon hadfound the small alcove, deftly hidden behind a crimson curtain. He had recalledit clearly from his secret passages tour.The Duke of Athens Stairway.The sound of running footsteps and shouting seemed to be coming from alldirections now, and Langdon knew their time was short. He pulled aside thecurtain, and he and Sienna slipped through onto a small landing.Without a word, they began to descend the stone staircase. The passage had beendesigned as a series of frighteningly narrow switchback stairs. The deeper theywent, the tighter it seemed to get. Just as Langdon felt as if the walls weremoving in to crush him, thankfully, they could go no farther.Ground level.The space at the bottom of the stairs was a tiny stone chamber, and although itsexit had to be one of the smallest doors on earth, it was a welcome sight. Onlyabout four feet high, the door was made of heavy wood with iron rivets and aheavy interior bolt to keep people out.“I can hear street sounds beyond the door,” Sienna whispered, still lookingshaken. “What’s on the other side?”“The Via della Ninna,” Langdon replied, picturing the crowded pedestrianwalkway. “But there may be police.”“They won’t recognize us. They’ll be looking for a blond girl and a dark-hairedman.”Langdon eyed her strangely. “Which is precisely what we are …”Sienna shook her head, a melancholy resolve crossing her face. “I didn’t wantyou to see me like this, Robert, but unfortunately it’s what I look like at themoment.” Abruptly, Sienna reached up and grabbed a handful of her blond hair.Then she yanked down, and all of her hair slid off in a single motion.Langdon recoiled, startled both by the fact that Sienna wore a wig and by heraltered appearance without it. Sienna Brooks was in fact totally bald, her barescalp smooth and pale, like a cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy. On top ofit all, she’s ill?“I know,” she said. “Long story. Now bend down.” She held up the wig, clearlyintending to put it on Langdon’s head.Is she serious? Langdon halfheartedly bent over, and Sienna wedged the blondhair onto his head. The wig barely fit, but she arranged it as best as shecould. Then she stepped back and assessed him. Not quite satisfied, she reachedup, loosened his tie, and slipped the loop up onto his forehead, retightening itlike a bandanna and securing the ill-fitting wig to his head.Sienna now set to work on herself, rolling up her pant legs and pushing hersocks down around her ankles. When she stood up, she had a sneer on her lips.The lovely Sienna Brooks was now a punk-rock skinhead. The former Shakespeareanactress’s transformation was startling.“Remember,” she said, “ninety percent of personal recognition is body language,so when you move, move like an aging rocker.”Aging, I can do, Langdon thought. Rocker, I’m not so sure.Before Langdon could argue the point, Sienna had unbolted the tiny door andswung it open. She ducked low and exited onto the crowded cobblestone street.Langdon followed, nearly on all fours as he emerged into the daylight.Aside from a few startled glances at the mismatched couple emerging from thetiny door in the foundation of Palazzo Vecchio, nobody gave them a second look.Within seconds, Langdon and Sienna were moving east, swallowed up by the crowd.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]The man in the Plume Paris eyeglasses picked at his bleeding skin as he snakedthrough the crowd, keeping a safe distance behind Robert Langdon and SiennaBrooks. Despite their clever disguises, he had spotted them emerging from thetiny door on the Via della Ninna and had immediately known who they were.He had tailed them only a few blocks before he got winded, his chest achingacutely, forcing him to take shallow breaths. He felt like he’d been punched inthe sternum.Gritting his teeth against the pain, he forced his attention back to Langdon andSienna as he continued to follow them through the streets of Florence."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 50THE MORNING SUN had fully risen now, casting long shadows down the narrowcanyons that snaked between the buildings of old Florence. Shopkeepers had begunthrowing open the metal grates that protected their shops and bars, and the airwas heavy with the aromas of morning espresso and freshly baked cornetti.Despite a gnawing hunger, Langdon kept moving. I’ve got to find the mask … andsee what’s hidden on the back.As Langdon led Sienna northward along the slender Via dei Leoni, he was having ahard time getting used to the sight of her bald head. Her radically alteredappearance reminded him that he barely knew her. They were moving in thedirection of Piazza del Duomo—the square where Ignazio Busoni had been founddead after placing his final phone call.Robert, Ignazio had managed to say, breathless. What you seek is safely hidden.The gates are open to you, but you must hurry. Paradise Twenty-five. Godspeed.Paradise Twenty-five, Langdon repeated to himself, still puzzled that IgnazioBusoni had recalled Dante’s text well enough to reference a specific canto offthe top of his head. Something about that canto was apparently memorable toBusoni. Whatever it was, Langdon knew he would find out soon enough, as soon ashe laid his hands on a copy of the text, which he could easily do at any numberof locations up ahead.His shoulder-length wig was beginning to itch now, and though he felt somewhatridiculous in his disguise, he had to admit that Sienna’s impromptu styling hadbeen an effective ruse. Nobody had given them a second look, not even the policereinforcements who had just rushed past them en route to the Palazzo Vecchio.Sienna had been walking in total silence beside him for several minutes, andLangdon glanced over to make sure she was okay. She seemed miles away, probablytrying to accept the fact that she had just killed the woman who had beenchasing them.“Lira for your thoughts,” he ventured lightly, hoping to pull her mind from theimage of the spike-haired woman lying dead on the palazzo floor.Sienna emerged slowly from her contemplations. “I was thinking of Zobrist,” shesaid slowly. “Trying to recall anything else I might know about him.”“And?”She shrugged. “Most of what I know is from a controversial essay he wrote a fewyears ago. It really stayed with me. Among the medical community, it instantlywent viral.” She winced. “Sorry, bad choice of words.”Langdon gave a grim chuckle. “Go on.”“His essay essentially declared that the human race was on the brink ofextinction, and that unless we had a catastrophic event that precipitouslydecreased global population growth, our species would not survive anotherhundred years.”Langdon turned and stared at her. “A single century?”“It was a pretty stark thesis. The predicted time frame was substantiallyshorter than previous estimates, but it was supported by some very potentscientific data. He made a lot of enemies by declaring that all doctors shouldstop practicing medicine because extending the human life span was onlyexacerbating the population problem.”Langdon now understood why the article spread wildly through the medicalcommunity.“Not surprisingly,” Sienna continued, “Zobrist was immediately attacked from allsides—politicians, clergy, the World Health Organization—all of whom derided himas a doomsayer lunatic who was simply trying to cause panic. They tookparticular umbrage at his statement that today’s youth, if they chose toreproduce, would have offspring that literally would witness the end of thehuman race. Zobrist illustrated his point with a ‘Doomsday Clock,’ which showedthat if the entire span of human life on earth were compressed into a singlehour … we are now in its final seconds.”“I’ve actually seen that clock online,” Langdon said.“Yes, well, it’s his, and it caused quite an uproar. The biggest backlashagainst Zobrist, however, came when he declared that his advances in geneticengineering would be far more helpful to mankind if they were used not to curedisease, but rather to create it.”“What?!”“Yes, he argued that his technology should be used to limit population growth bycreating hybrid strains of disease that our modern medicine would be unable tocure.”Langdon felt a rising dread as his mind conjured images of strange, hybrid“designer viruses” that, once released, were totally unstoppable.“Over a few short years,” Sienna said, “Zobrist went from being the toast of themedical world to being a total outcast. An anathema.” She paused, a look ofcompassion crossing her face. “It’s really no wonder he snapped and killedhimself. Even sadder because his thesis is probably correct.”Langdon almost fell over. “I’m sorry—you think he’s right?!”Sienna gave him a solemn shrug. “Robert, speaking from a purely scientificstandpoint—all logic, no heart—I can tell you without a doubt that without somekind of drastic change, the end of our species is coming. And it’s coming fast.It won’t be fire, brimstone, apocalypse, or nuclear war … it will be totalcollapse due to the number of people on the planet. The mathematics isindisputable.”Langdon stiffened.“I’ve studied a fair amount of biology,” she said, “and it’s quite normal for aspecies to go extinct simply as a result of overpopulating its environment.Picture a colony of surface algae living in a tiny pond in the forest, enjoyingthe pond’s perfect balance of nutrients. Unchecked, they reproduce so wildlythat they quickly cover the pond’s entire surface, blotting out the sun andthereby preventing the growth of the nutrients in the pond. Having sappedeverything possible from their environment, the algae quickly die and disappearwithout a trace.” She gave a heavy sigh. “A similar fate could easily awaitmankind. Far sooner and faster than any of us imagine.”Langdon felt deeply unsettled. “But … that seems impossible.”“Not impossible, Robert, just unthinkable. The human mind has a primitive egodefense mechanism that negates all realities that produce too much stress forthe brain to handle. It’s called denial.”“I’ve heard of denial,” Langdon quipped blithely, “but I don’t think it exists.”Sienna rolled her eyes. “Cute, but believe me, it’s very real. Denial is acritical part of the human coping mechanism. Without it, we would all wake upterrified every morning about all the ways we could die. Instead, our mindsblock out our existential fears by focusing on stresses we can handle—likegetting to work on time or paying our taxes. If we have wider, existentialfears, we jettison them very quickly, refocusing on simple tasks and dailytrivialities.”Langdon recalled a recent Web-tracking study of students at some Ivy Leagueuniversities which revealed that even highly intellectual users displayed aninstinctual tendency toward denial. According to the study, the vast majority ofuniversity students, after clicking on a depressing news article about arcticice melt or species extinction, would quickly exit that page in favor ofsomething trivial that purged their minds of fear; favorite choices includedsports highlights, funny cat videos, and celebrity gossip.“In ancient mythology,” Langdon offered, “a hero in denial is the ultimatemanifestation of hubris and pride. No man is more prideful than he who believeshimself immune to the dangers of the world. Dante clearly agreed, denouncingpride as the worst of the seven deadly sins … and punished the prideful in thedeepest ring of the inferno.”Sienna reflected a moment and then continued. “Zobrist’s article accused many ofthe world’s leaders of being in extreme denial … putting their heads in thesand. He was particularly critical of the World Health Organization.”“I bet that went over well.”“They reacted by equating him with a religious zealot on a street corner holdinga sign that says ‘The End Is Near.’ ”“Harvard Square has a couple of those.”“Yes, and we all ignore them because none of us can imagine it will happen. Butbelieve me, just because the human mind can’t imagine something happening …doesn’t mean it won’t.”“You almost sound like you’re a fan of Zobrist’s.”“I’m a fan of the truth,” she replied forcefully, “even if it’s painfully hardto accept.”Langdon fell silent, again feeling strangely isolated from Sienna at the moment,trying to understand her bizarre combination of passion and detachment.Sienna glanced over at him, her face softening. “Robert, look, I’m not sayingZobrist is correct that a plague that kills half the world’s people is theanswer to overpopulation. Nor am I saying we should stop curing the sick. What Iam saying is that our current path is a pretty simple formula for destruction.Population growth is an exponential progression occurring within a system offinite space and limited resources. The end will arrive very abruptly. Ourexperience will not be that of slowly running out of gas … it will be more likedriving off a cliff.”Langdon exhaled, trying to process everything he had just heard.“Speaking of which,” she added, somberly pointing up in the air to their right,“I’m pretty sure that’s where Zobrist jumped.”Langdon glanced up and saw that they were just passing the austere stone facadeof the Bargello Museum to their right. Behind it, the tapered spire of the Badiatower rose above the surrounding structures. He stared at the top of the tower,wondering why Zobrist had jumped and hoped to hell it wasn’t because the man haddone something terrible and hadn’t wanted to face what was coming.“Critics of Zobrist,” Sienna said, “like to point out how paradoxical it is thatmany of the genetic technologies he developed are now extending life expectancydramatically.”“Which only compounds the population problem.”“Exactly. Zobrist once said publicly that he wished he could put the genie backin the bottle and erase some of his contributions to human longevity. I supposethat makes sense ideologically. The longer we live, the more our resources go tosupporting the elderly and ailing.”Langdon nodded. “I’ve read that in the U.S. some sixty percent of health carecosts go to support patients during the last six months of their lives.”“True, and while our brains say, ‘This is insane,’ our hearts say, ‘Keep Grandmaalive as long as we can.’ ”Langdon nodded. “It’s the conflict between Apollo and Dionysus—a famous dilemmain mythology. It’s the age-old battle between mind and heart, which seldom wantthe same thing.”The mythological reference, Langdon had heard, was now being used in AA meetingsto describe the alcoholic who stares at a glass of alcohol, his brain knowing itwill harm him, but his heart craving the comfort it will provide. The messageapparently was: Don’t feel alone—even the gods were conflicted.“Who needs agathusia?” Sienna whispered suddenly.“I’m sorry?”Sienna glanced up. “I finally remembered the name of Zobrist’s essay. It wascalled: ‘Who Needs Agathusia?’ ”Langdon had never heard the word agathusia, but took his best guess based on itsGreek roots—agathos and thusia. “Agathusia … would be a ‘good sacrifice’?”“Almost. Its actual meaning is ‘a self-sacrifice for the common good.’ ” Shepaused. “Otherwise known as benevolent suicide.”Langdon had indeed heard this term before—once in relation to a bankrupt fatherwho killed himself so his family could collect his life insurance, and a secondtime to describe a remorseful serial killer who ended his life fearing hecouldn’t control his impulse to kill.The most chilling example Langdon recalled, however, was in the 1967 novelLogan’s Run, which depicted a future society in which everyone gladly agreed tocommit suicide at age twenty-one—thus fully enjoying their youth while notletting their numbers or old age stress the planet’s limited resources. IfLangdon recalled correctly, the movie version of Logan’s Run had increased the“termination age” from twenty-one to thirty, no doubt in an attempt to make thefilm more palatable to the box office’s crucial eighteen-to-twenty-fivedemographic.“So, Zobrist’s essay …” Langdon said. “I’m not sure I understand the title. ‘WhoNeeds Agathusia?’ Was he saying it sarcastically? As in who needs benevolentsuicide … we all do?”“Actually no, the title is a pun.”Langdon shook his head, not seeing it.“Who needs suicide—as in the W-H-O—the World Health Organization. In his essay,Zobrist railed against the director of the WHO—Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey—who hasbeen there forever and, according to Zobrist, is not taking population controlseriously. His article was saying that the WHO would be better off if DirectorSinskey killed herself.”“Compassionate guy.”“The perils of being a genius, I guess. Oftentimes, those special brains, theones that are capable of focusing more intently than others, do so at theexpense of emotional maturity.”Langdon pictured the articles he had seen about the young Sienna, the childprodigy with the 208 IQ and off-the-chart intellectual function. Langdonwondered if, in talking about Zobrist, she was also, on some level, talkingabout herself; he also wondered how long she would choose to keep her secret.Up ahead, Langdon spotted the landmark he had been looking for. After crossingthe Via dei Leoni, Langdon led her to the intersection of an exceptionallynarrow street—more of an alleyway. The sign overhead read VIA DANTE ALIGHIERI.“It sounds like you know a lot about the human brain,” Langdon said. “Was thatyour area of concentration in medical school?”“No, but when I was a kid, I read a lot. I became interested in brain sciencebecause I had some … medical issues.”Langdon shot her a curious look, hoping she would continue.“My brain …” Sienna said quietly. “It grew differently from most kids’, and itcaused some … problems. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what waswrong with me, and in the process I learned a lot about neuroscience.” Shecaught Langdon’s eye. “And yes, my baldness is related to my medical condition.”Langdon averted his eyes, embarrassed he’d asked.“Don’t worry about it,” she said. “I’ve learned to live with it.”As they moved into the cold air of the shadowed alleyway, Langdon consideredeverything he had just learned about Zobrist and his alarming philosophicalpositions.A recurring question nagged at him. “These soldiers,” Langdon began. “The onestrying to kill us. Who are they? It makes no sense. If Zobrist has put apotential plague out there, wouldn’t everyone be on the same side, working tostop its release?”“Not necessarily. Zobrist may be a pariah in the medical community, but heprobably has a legion of devout fans of his ideology—people who agree that aculling is a necessary evil to save the planet. For all we know, these soldiersare trying to ensure that Zobrist’s vision is realized.”Zobrist’s own private army of disciples? Langdon considered the possibility.Admittedly, history was full of zealots and cults who killed themselves becauseof all kinds of crazy notions—a belief that their leader is the Messiah, abelief that a spaceship is waiting for them behind the moon, a belief thatJudgment Day is imminent. The speculation about population control was at leastgrounded in science, and yet something about these soldiers still didn’t feelright to Langdon.“I just can’t believe that a bunch of trained soldiers would knowingly agree tokill innocent masses … all the while fearing they might get sick and diethemselves.”Sienna shot him a puzzled look. “Robert, what do you think soldiers do when theygo to war? They kill innocent people and risk their own death. Anything ispossible when people believe in a cause.”“A cause? Releasing a plague?”Sienna glanced at him, her brown eyes probing. “Robert, the cause is notreleasing a plague … it’s saving the world.” She paused. “One of the passages inBertrand Zobrist’s essay that got a lot of people talking was a very pointedhypothetical question. I want you to answer it.”“What’s the question?”“Zobrist asked the following: If you could throw a switch and randomly kill halfthe population on earth, would you do it?”“Of course not.”“Okay. But what if you were told that if you didn’t throw that switch right now,the human race would be extinct in the next hundred years?” She paused. “Wouldyou throw it then? Even if it meant you might murder friends, family, andpossibly even yourself?”“Sienna, I can’t possibly—”“It’s a hypothetical question,” she said. “Would you kill half the populationtoday in order to save our species from extinction?”Langdon felt deeply disturbed by the macabre subject they were discussing, andso he was grateful to see a familiar red banner hanging on the side of a stonebuilding just ahead.“Look,” he announced, pointing. “We’re here.”Sienna shook her head. “Like I said. Denial.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 51THE CASA DI Dante is located on the Via Santa Margherita and is easilyidentified by the large banner suspended from the stone facade partway up thealleyway: MUSEO CASA DI DANTE.Sienna eyed the banner with uncertainty. “We’re going to Dante’s house?”“Not exactly,” Langdon said. “Dante lived around the corner. This is more of aDante … museum.” Langdon had ventured inside the place once, curious about theart collection, which turned out to be no more than reproductions of famousDante-related works from around the world, and yet it was interesting to seethem all gathered together under one roof.Sienna looked suddenly hopeful. “And you think they have an ancient copy of TheDivine Comedy on display?”Langdon chuckled. “No, but I know they have a gift shop that sells huge posterswith the entire text of Dante’s Divine Comedy printed in microscopic type.”She gave him a slightly appalled glance.“I know. But it’s better than nothing. The only problem is that my eyes aregoing, so you’ll have to read the fine print.”“È chiusa,” an old man called out, seeing them approach the door. “È il giornodi riposo.”Closed for the Sabbath? Langdon felt suddenly disoriented again. He looked atSienna. “Isn’t today … Monday?”She nodded. “Florentines prefer a Monday Sabbath.”Langdon groaned, suddenly recalling the city’s unusual weekly calendar. Becausetourist dollars flowed most heavily on weekends, many Florentine merchants choseto move the Christian “day of rest” from Sunday to Monday to prevent the Sabbathfrom cutting too deeply into their bottom line.Unfortunately, Langdon realized, this probably also ruled out his other option:the Paperback Exchange—one of Langdon’s favorite Florentine bookshops—whichwould definitely have had copies of The Divine Comedy on hand.“Any other ideas?” Sienna said.Langdon thought a long moment and finally nodded. “There’s a site just aroundthe corner where Dante enthusiasts gather. I bet someone there has a copy we canborrow.”“It’s probably closed, too,” Sienna warned. “Almost every place in town movesthe Sabbath away from Sunday.”“This place wouldn’t dream of doing such a thing,” Langdon replied with a smile.“It’s a church.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Fifty yards behind them, lurking among the crowd, the man with the skin rash andgold earring leaned on a wall, savoring this chance to catch his breath. Hisbreathing was not getting any better, and the rash on his face was nearlyimpossible to ignore, especially the sensitive skin just above his eyes. He tookoff his Plume Paris glasses and gently rubbed his sleeve across his eye sockets,trying not to break the skin. When he replaced his glasses, he could see hisquarry moving on. Forcing himself to follow, he continued after them, breathingas gently as possible.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Several blocks behind Langdon and Sienna, inside the Hall of the Five Hundred,Agent Brüder stood over the broken body of the all-too-familiar spike-hairedwoman who was now lying sprawled out on the floor. He knelt down and retrievedher handgun, carefully removing the clip for safety before handing it off to oneof his men.The pregnant museum administrator, Marta Alvarez, stood off to one side. She hadjust relayed to Brüder a brief but startling account of what had transpired withRobert Langdon since the previous night … including a single piece ofinformation that Brüder was still trying to process.Langdon claims to have amnesia.Brüder pulled out his phone and dialed. The line at the other end rang threetimes before his boss answered, sounding distant and unsteady.“Yes, Agent Brüder? Go ahead.”Brüder spoke slowly to ensure that his every word was understood. “We are stilltrying to locate Langdon and the girl, but there’s been another development.”Brüder paused. “And if it’s true … it changes everything.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]The provost paced his office, fighting the temptation to pour himself anotherScotch, forcing himself to face this growing crisis head-on.Never in his career had he betrayed a client or failed to keep an agreement, andhe most certainly had no intention of starting now. At the same time hesuspected that he might have gotten himself tangled up in a scenario whosepurpose diverged from what he had originally imagined.One year ago, the famous geneticist Bertrand Zobrist had come aboard TheMendacium and requested a safe haven in which to work. At that time the provostimagined that Zobrist was planning to develop a secret medical procedure whosepatenting would increase Zobrist’s vast fortune. It would not be the first timethe Consortium had been hired by paranoid scientists and engineers who preferredworking in extreme isolation to prevent their valuable ideas from being stolen.With that in mind, the provost accepted the client and was not surprised when helearned that the people at the World Health Organization had begun searching forhim. Nor did he give it a second thought when the director of the WHOherself—Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey—seemed to make it her personal mission to locatetheir client.The Consortium has always faced powerful adversaries.As agreed, the Consortium carried out their agreement with Zobrist, no questionsasked, thwarting Sinskey’s efforts to find him for the entire length of thescientist’s contract.Almost the entire length.Less than a week before the contract was to expire, Sinskey had somehow locatedZobrist in Florence and moved in, harassing and chasing him until he committedsuicide. For the first time in his career, the provost had failed to provide theprotection he had agreed to, and it haunted him … along with the bizarrecircumstances of Zobrist’s death.He committed suicide … rather than being captured?What the hell was Zobrist protecting?In the aftermath of his death, Sinskey had confiscated an item from Zobrist’ssafe-deposit box, and now the Consortium was locked in a head-to-head battlewith Sinskey in Florence—a high-stakes treasure hunt to find …To find what?The provost felt himself glance instinctively toward the bookshelf and the heavytome given to him two weeks ago by the wild-eyed Zobrist.The Divine Comedy.The provost retrieved the book and carried it back to his desk, where he droppedit with a heavy thud. With unsteady fingers, he opened the cover to the firstpage and again read the inscription.My dear friend, thank you for helping me find the path.The world thanks you, too.First off, the provost thought, you and I were never friends.He read the inscription three more times. Then he turned his eyes to the brightred circle his client had scrawled on his calendar, highlighting tomorrow’sdate.The world thanks you?He turned and gazed out at the horizon a long moment.In the silence, he thought about the video and heard the voice of facilitatorKnowlton from his earlier phone call. I thought you might want to preview itbefore upload … the content is quite disturbing.The call still puzzled the provost. Knowlton was one of his best facilitators,and making such a request was entirely out of character. He knew better than tosuggest an override of the compartmentalization protocol.After replacing The Divine Comedy on the shelf, the provost walked to the Scotchbottle and poured himself half a glass.He had a very difficult decision to make."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 52KNOWN AS THE Church of Dante, the sanctuary of Chiesa di Santa Margherita deiCerchi is more of a chapel than a church. The tiny, one-room house of worship isa popular destination for devotees of Dante who revere it as the sacred groundon which transpired two pivotal moments in the great poet’s life.According to lore, it was here at this church, at the age of nine, that Dantefirst laid eyes on Beatrice Portinari—the woman with whom he fell in love atfirst sight, and for whom his heart ached his entire life. To Dante’s greatanguish, Beatrice married another man, and then died at the youthful age oftwenty-four.It was also in this church, some years later, that Dante married Gemma Donati—awoman who, even by the account of the great writer and poet Boccaccio, was apoor choice of wife for Dante. Despite having children, the couple showed littlesigns of affection for each other, and after Dante’s exile, neither spouseseemed eager to see the other ever again.The love of Dante’s life had always been and would always remain the departedBeatrice Portinari, whom Dante had scarcely known, and yet whose memory was sooverpowering for him that her ghost became the muse that inspired his greatestworks.Dante’s celebrated volume of poetry La Vita Nuova overflows with flatteringverses about “the blessed Beatrice.” More worshipful still, The Divine Comedycasts Beatrice as none other than the savior who guides Dante through paradise.In both works, Dante longs for his unattainable lady.Nowadays, the Church of Dante has become a shrine for the brokenhearted whosuffer from unrequited love. The tomb of young Beatrice herself is inside thechurch, and her simple sepulchre has become a pilgrimage destination for bothDante fans and heartsick lovers alike.This morning, as Langdon and Sienna wound their way through old Florence towardthe church, the streets continued to narrow until they became little more thanglorified pedestrian walkways. An occasional local car appeared, inching throughthe maze and forcing pedestrians to flatten themselves against the buildings asit passed.“The church is just around the corner,” Langdon told Sienna, hopeful that one ofthe tourists inside would be able to help them. He knew their chances of findinga good Samaritan were better now that Sienna had taken back her wig in exchangefor Langdon’s jacket, and both had reverted to their normal selves, transformingfrom rocker and skinhead … to college professor and clean-cut young woman.Langdon was relieved once again to feel like himself.As they strode into an even tighter alleyway—the Via del Presto—Langdon scannedthe various doorways. The entrance of the church was always tricky to locatebecause the building itself was very small, unadorned, and wedged tightlybetween two other buildings. One could easily walk past it without evennoticing. Oddly, it was often easier to locate this church using not one’s eyes… but one’s ears.One of the peculiarities of La Chiesa di Santa Margherita dei Cerchi was that ithosted frequent concerts, and when no concert was scheduled, the church piped inrecordings of those concerts so visitors could enjoy the music at any time.As anticipated, as they advanced down the alleyway, Langdon began to hear thethin strains of recorded music, which grew steadily louder, until he and Siennawere standing before the inconspicuous entrance. The only indication that thiswas indeed the correct location was a tiny sign—the antithesis of the bright redbanner at the Museo Casa di Dante—that humbly announced that this was the churchof Dante and Beatrice.When Langdon and Sienna stepped off the street into the dark confines of thechurch, the air grew cooler and the music grew louder. The interior was starkand simple … smaller than Langdon recalled. There was only a handful oftourists, mingling, writing in journals, sitting quietly in the pews enjoyingthe music, or examining the curious collection of artwork.With the exception of the Madonna-themed altarpiece by Neri di Bicci, almost allof the original art in this chapel had been replaced with contemporary piecesrepresenting the two celebrities—Dante and Beatrice—the reasons most visitorssought out this tiny chapel. Most of the paintings depicted Dante’s longing gazeduring his famous first encounter with Beatrice, during which the poet, by hisown account, instantly fell in love. The paintings were of widely varyingquality, and most, to Langdon’s taste, seemed kitschy and out of place. In onesuch rendering, Dante’s iconic red cap with earflaps looked like something Dantehad stolen from Santa Claus. Nonetheless, the recurring theme of the poet’syearning gaze at his muse, Beatrice, left no doubt that this was a church ofpainful love—unfulfilled, unrequited, and unattained.Langdon turned instinctively to his left and gazed upon the modest tomb ofBeatrice Portinari. This was the primary reason people visited this church,although not so much to see the tomb itself as to see the famous object that satbeside it.A wicker basket.This morning, as always, the simple wicker basket sat beside Beatrice’s tomb.And this morning, as always, it was overflowing with folded slips of paper—eacha handwritten letter from a visitor, written to Beatrice herself.Beatrice Portinari had become something of a patron saint of star-crossedlovers, and according to long-standing tradition, handwritten prayers toBeatrice could be deposited in the basket in the hope that she would interveneon the writer’s behalf—perhaps inspiring someone to love them more, or helpingthem find their true love, or even giving them the strength to forget a love whohad passed away.Langdon, many years ago, while in the throes of researching a book on arthistory, had paused in this church to leave a note in the basket, entreatingDante’s muse not to grant him true love, but to shed on him some of theinspiration that had enabled Dante to write his massive tome.Sing in me, Muse, and through me tell the story …The opening line of Homer’s Odyssey had seemed a worthy supplication, andLangdon secretly believed his message had indeed sparked Beatrice’s divineinspiration, for upon his return home, he had written the book with unusualease.“Scusate!” Sienna’s voice boomed suddenly. “Potete ascoltarmi tutti?” Everyone?Langdon spun to see Sienna loudly addressing the scattering of tourists, all ofwhom now glanced over at her, looking somewhat alarmed.Sienna smiled sweetly at everyone and asked in Italian if anyone happened tohave a copy of Dante’s Divine Comedy. After some strange looks and shakes of thehead, she tried the question in English, without any more success.An older woman who was sweeping the altar hissed sharply at Sienna and held up afinger to her lips for silence.Sienna turned back to Langdon and frowned, as if to say, “Now what?”Sienna’s calling-all-cars solicitation was not quite what Langdon had had inmind, but he had to admit he’d anticipated a better response than she’dreceived. On previous visits, Langdon had seen no shortage of tourists readingThe Divine Comedy in this hallowed space, apparently enjoying a total immersionin the Dante experience.Not so today.Langdon set his sights on an elderly couple seated near the front of the church.The old man’s bald head was dipped forward, chin to chest; clearly he wasstealing a nap. The woman beside him seemed very much awake, with a pair ofwhite earbud cables dangling from beneath her gray hair.A glimmer of promise, Langdon thought, making his way up the aisle until he waseven with the couple. As Langdon had hoped, the woman’s telltale white earbudssnaked down to an iPhone in her lap. Sensing she was being watched, she lookedup and pulled the earbuds from her ears.Langdon had no idea what language the woman spoke, but the global proliferationof iPhones, iPads, and iPods had resulted in a vocabulary as universallyunderstood as the male/female symbols that graced restrooms around the world.“iPhone?” Langdon asked, admiring her device.The old woman brightened at once, nodding proudly. “Such a clever little toy,”she whispered in a British accent. “My son got it for me. I’m listening to mye-mail. Can you believe it—listening to my e-mail? This little treasure actuallyreads it for me. With my old eyes, it’s such a help.”“I have one, too,” Langdon said with a smile as he sat down beside her, carefulnot to wake up her sleeping husband. “But somehow I lost it last night.”“Oh, tragedy! Did you try the ‘find your iPhone’ feature? My son says—”“Stupid me, I never activated that feature.” Langdon gave her a sheepish lookand ventured hesitantly, “If it’s not too much of an intrusion, would you mindterribly if I borrowed yours for just a moment? I need to look up somethingonline. It would be a big help to me.”“Of course!” She pulled out the earbuds and thrust the device into his hands.“No problem at all! Poor dear.”Langdon thanked her and took the phone. While she prattled on beside him abouthow terrible she would feel if she lost her iPhone, Langdon pulled up Google’ssearch window and pressed the microphone button. When the phone beeped once,Langdon articulated his search string.“Dante, Divine Comedy, Paradise, Canto Twenty-five.”The woman looked amazed, apparently having yet to learn about this feature. Asthe search results began to materialize on the tiny screen, Langdon stole aquick glance back at Sienna, who was thumbing through some printed material nearthe basket of letters to Beatrice.Not far from where Sienna stood, a man in a necktie was kneeling in the shadows,praying intently, his head bowed low. Langdon couldn’t see his face, but he felta pang of sadness for the solitary man, who had probably lost his loved one andhad come here for comfort.Langdon returned his focus to the iPhone, and within seconds was able to pull upa link to a digital offering of The Divine Comedy— freely accessible because itwas in the public domain. When the page opened precisely to Canto 25, he had toadmit he was impressed with the technology. I’ve got to stop being such a snobabout leather-bound books, he reminded himself. E-books do have their moments.As the elderly woman looked on, showing a bit of concern and saying somethingabout the high data rates for surfing the Internet abroad, Langdon sensed thathis window of opportunity would be brief, and he focused intently on the Webpage before him.The text was small, but the dim lighting in the chapel made the illuminatedscreen more legible. Langdon was pleased to see he had randomly stumbled intothe Mandelbaum translation—a popular modern rendition by the late Americanprofessor Allen Mandelbaum. For his dazzling translation, Mandelbaum hadreceived Italy’s highest honor, the Presidential Cross of the Order of the Starof Italian Solidarity. While admittedly less overtly poetic than Longfellow’sversion, Mandelbaum’s translation tended to be far more comprehensible.Today I’ll take clarity over poesy, Langdon thought, hoping to quickly spot inthe text a reference to a specific location in Florence—the location whereIgnazio hid the Dante death mask.The iPhone’s tiny screen displayed only six lines of text at a time, and asLangdon began to read, he recalled the passage. In the opening of Canto 25,Dante referenced The Divine Comedy itself, the physical toll its writing hadtaken on him, and the aching hope that perhaps his heavenly poem could overcomethe wolfish brutality of the exile that kept him from his fair Florence.CANTO XXVIf it should happen … if this sacred poem—this work so shared by heaven and by earththat it has made me lean through these long years—can ever overcome the crueltythat bars me from the fair fold where I slept,a lamb opposed to wolves that war on it …While the passage was a reminder that fair Florence was the home for which Dantelonged while writing The Divine Comedy, Langdon saw no reference to any specificlocation in the city.“What do you know about data charges?” the woman interrupted, eyeing her iPhonewith sudden concern. “I just remembered my son told me to be careful about Websurfing abroad.”Langdon assured her he would be only a minute and offered to reimburse her, buteven so, he sensed she would never let him read all one hundred lines of Canto25.He quickly scrolled down to the next six lines and continued reading.By then with other voice, with other fleece,I shall return as poet and put on,at my baptismal font, the laurel crown;for there I first found entry to that faithwhich makes souls welcome unto God, and then,for that faith, Peter garlanded my brow.Langdon loosely recalled this passage, too—an oblique reference to a politicaldeal offered to Dante by his enemies. According to history, the “wolves” whobanished Dante from Florence had told him he could return to the city only if heagreed to endure a public shaming—that of standing before an entirecongregation, alone at his baptismal font, wearing only sackcloth as anadmission of his guilt.In the passage Langdon had just read, Dante, having declined the deal, proclaimsthat if he ever returns to his baptismal font, he will be wearing not thesackcloth of a guilty man but the laurel crown of a poet.Langdon raised his index finger to scroll farther, but the woman suddenlyprotested, holding out her hand for the iPhone, apparently having reconsideredher loan.Langdon barely heard her. In the split second before he had touched the screen,his eye had glossed over a line of text … seeing it a second time.I shall return as poet and put on,at my baptismal font, the laurel crown;Langdon stared at the words, sensing that in his eagerness to find mention of aspecific location, he’d almost missed a glowing prospect in the very openinglines.at my baptismal font …Florence was home to one of the world’s most celebrated baptismal fonts, whichfor more than seven hundred years had been used to purify and christen youngFlorentines—among them, Dante Alighieri.Langdon immediately conjured an image of the building containing the font. Itwas a spectacular, octagonal edifice that in many ways was more heavenly thanthe Duomo itself. He now wondered if perhaps he’d read all he needed to read.Could this building be the place Ignazio was referring to?A ray of golden light blazed now in Langdon’s mind as a beautiful imagematerialized—a spectacular set of bronze doors—radiant and glistening in themorning sun.I know what Ignazio was trying to tell me!Any lingering doubts evaporated an instant later when he realized that IgnazioBusoni was one of the only people in Florence who could possibly unlock thosedoors.Robert, the gates are open to you, but you must hurry.Langdon handed the iPhone back to the old woman and thanked her profusely.He rushed over to Sienna and whispered excitedly, “I know what gates Ignazio wastalking about! The Gates of Paradise!”Sienna looked dubious. “The gates of paradise? Aren’t those … in heaven?”“Actually,” Langdon said, giving her a wry smile and heading for the door, “ifyou know where to look, Florence is heaven.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 53I SHALL RETURN as poet … at my baptismal font.Dante’s words echoed repeatedly in Langdon’s mind as he led Sienna northwardalong the narrow passageway known as Via dello Studio. Their destination layahead, and with every step Langdon was feeling more confident that they were onthe right course and had left their pursuers behind.The gates are open to you, but you must hurry.As they neared the end of the chasmlike alleyway, Langdon could already hear thelow thrum of activity ahead. Abruptly the cavern on either side of them gaveway, spilling them out into a sprawling expanse.The Piazza del Duomo.This enormous plaza with its complex network of structures was the ancientreligious center of Florence. More of a tourist center nowadays, the piazza wasalready bustling with tour buses and throngs of visitors crowding aroundFlorence’s famed cathedral.Having arrived on the south side of the piazza, Langdon and Sienna were nowfacing the side of the cathedral with its dazzling exterior of green, pink, andwhite marble. As breathtaking in its size as it was in the artistry that hadgone into its construction, the cathedral stretched off in both directions toseemingly impossible distances, its full length nearly equal to that of theWashington Monument laid on its side.Despite its abandonment of traditional monochromatic stone filigree in favor ofan unusually flamboyant mix of colors, the structure was pure Gothic—classic,robust, and enduring. Admittedly, Langdon, on his first trip to Florence, hadfound the architecture almost gaudy. On subsequent trips, however, he foundhimself studying the structure for hours at a time, strangely captivated by itsunusual aesthetic effects, and finally appreciating its spectacular beauty.Il Duomo—or, more formally, the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore—in additionto providing a nickname for Ignazio Busoni, had long provided not only aspiritual heart to Florence but centuries of drama and intrigue. The building’svolatile past ranged from long and vicious debates over Vasari’s much-despisedfresco of The Last Judgment on the dome’s interior … to the hotly disputedcompetition to select the architect to finish the dome itself.Filippo Brunelleschi had eventually secured the lucrative contract and completedthe dome—the largest of its kind at the time—and to this day Brunelleschihimself can be seen in sculpture, seated outside the Palazzo dei Canonici,staring contentedly up at his masterpiece.This morning, as Langdon raised his eyes skyward to the famed red-tiled domethat had been an architectural feat of its era, he recalled the time he hadfoolishly decided to ascend the dome only to discover that its narrow,tourist-crammed staircases were as distressing as any of the claustrophobicspaces he’d ever encountered. Even so, Langdon was grateful for the ordeal he’dendured while climbing “Brunelleschi’s Dome,” since it had encouraged him toread an entertaining Ross King book of the same name.“Robert?” Sienna said. “Are you coming?”Langdon lowered his gaze from the dome, realizing he had stopped in his tracksto admire the architecture. “Sorry about that.”They continued moving, hugging the perimeter of the square. The cathedral was ontheir right now, and Langdon noted that tourists were already flowing out of itsside exits, checking the site off their to-see lists.Up ahead rose the unmistakable shape of a campanile—the second of the threestructures in the cathedral complex. Commonly known as Giotto’s bell tower, thecampanile left no doubt that it belonged with the cathedral beside it. Adornedin the identical pink, green, and white facing stones, the square spire climbedskyward to a dizzying height of nearly three hundred feet. Langdon had alwaysfound it amazing that this slender structure could remain standing all thesecenturies, through earthquakes and bad weather, especially knowing how top-heavyit was, with its apex belfry supporting more than twenty thousand pounds ofbells.Sienna walked briskly beside him, her eyes nervously scanning the skies beyondthe campanile, clearly searching for the drone, but it was nowhere to be seen.The crowd was fairly dense, even at this early hour, and Langdon made a point ofstaying in the thick of it.As they approached the campanile, they passed a line of caricature artistsstanding at their easels sketching garish cartoons of tourists—a teenage boygrinding on a skateboard, a horse-toothed girl wielding a lacrosse stick, a pairof honeymooners kissing on a unicorn. Langdon found it amusing somehow that thisactivity was permitted on the same sacred cobbles where Michelangelo had set uphis own easel as a boy.Continuing quickly around the base of Giotto’s bell tower, Langdon and Siennaturned right, moving out across the open square directly in front of thecathedral. Here the crowds were thickest, with tourists from around the worldaiming camera phones and video cameras upward at the colorful main facade.Langdon barely glanced up, having already set his sights on a much smallerbuilding that had just come into view. Positioned directly opposite the frontentrance of the cathedral stood the third and final structure in the cathedralcomplex.It was also Langdon’s favorite.The Baptistry of San Giovanni.Adorned in the same polychromatic facing stones and striped pilasters as thecathedral, the baptistry distinguished itself from the larger building by itsstriking shape—a perfect octagon. Resembling a layer cake, some had claimed, theeight-sided structure consisted of three distinct tiers that ascended to ashallow white roof.Langdon knew the octagonal shape had nothing to do with aesthetics andeverything to do with symbolism. In Christianity, the number eight representedrebirth and re-creation. The octagon served as a visual reminder of the six daysof God’s creation of heaven and earth, the one day of Sabbath, and the eighthday, upon which Christians were “reborn” or “re-created” through baptism.Octagons had become a common shape for baptistries around the world.While Langdon considered the baptistry one of Florence’s most strikingbuildings, he always found the choice of its location a bit unfair. Thisbaptistry, nearly anywhere else on earth, would be the center of attention.Here, however, in the shadow of its two colossal siblings, the baptistry gavethe impression of being the runt of the litter.Until you step inside, Langdon reminded himself, picturing the mind-bogglingmosaic work of the interior, which was so spectacular that early admirersclaimed the baptistry ceiling resembled heaven itself. If you know where tolook, Langdon had wryly told Sienna, Florence is heaven.For centuries, this eight-sided sanctuary had hosted the baptisms of countlessnotable figures—Dante among them.I shall return as poet … at my baptismal font.Because of his exile, Dante had never been permitted to return to this sacredsite—the place of his baptism—although Langdon felt a rising hope that Dante’sdeath mask, through the unlikely series of events that had occurred last night,had finally found its way back in his stead.The baptistry, Langdon thought. This has to be where Ignazio hid the mask beforehe died. He recalled Ignazio’s desperate phone message, and for a chillingmoment, Langdon pictured the corpulent man clutching his chest, lurching acrossthe piazza into an alley, and making his final phone call after leaving the masksafely inside the baptistry.The gates are open to you.Langdon’s eyes remained fixed on the baptistry as he and Sienna snaked throughthe crowd. Sienna was moving now with such nimble eagerness that Langdon nearlyhad to jog to keep up. Even at a distance, he could see the baptistry’s massivemain doors glistening in the sun.Crafted of gilded bronze and over fifteen feet tall, the doors had taken LorenzoGhiberti more than twenty years to complete. They were adorned with tenintricate panels of delicate biblical figures of such quality that GiorgioVasari had called the doors “undeniably perfect in every way and … the finestmasterpiece ever created.”It had been Michelangelo, however, whose gushing testimonial had provided thedoors with a nickname that endured even today. Michelangelo had proclaimed themso beautiful as to be fit for use … as the Gates of Paradise."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 54THE BIBLE IN bronze, Langdon thought, admiring the beautiful doors before them.Ghiberti’s shimmering Gates of Paradise consisted of ten square panels, eachdepicting an important scene from the Old Testament. Ranging from the Garden ofEden to Moses to King Solomon’s temple, Ghiberti’s sculpted narrative unfoldedacross two vertical columns of five panels each.The stunning array of individual scenes had spawned over the centuries somethingof a popularity contest among artists and art historians, with everyone fromBotticelli to modern-day critics arguing their preference for “the finestpanel.” The winner, by general consensus, over the centuries had been Jacob andEsau—the central panel of the left-hand column—chosen allegedly for theimpressive number of artistic methods used in its making. Langdon suspected,however, that the actual reason for the panel’s dominance was that Ghiberti hadchosen it on which to sign his name.A few years earlier, Ignazio Busoni had proudly shown Langdon these doors,sheepishly admitting that after half a millennium of exposure to floods,vandalism, and air pollution, the gilded doors had been quietly swapped out forexact replicas, the originals now safely stored inside the Museo dell’Opera delDuomo for restoration. Langdon politely refrained from telling Busoni that hewas well aware of the fact that they were admiring fakes, and that in actuality,these copies were the second set of “fake” Ghiberti doors Langdon hadencountered—the first set quite by accident while he was researching thelabyrinths at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco and discovered that replicas ofGhiberti’s Gates of Paradise had served as the cathedral’s front doors since themid-twentieth century.As Langdon stood before Ghiberti’s masterpiece, his eye was drawn to the shortinformational placard mounted nearby, on which a simple phrase in Italian caughthis attention, startling him.La peste nera. The phrase meant “the Black Death.” My God, Langdon thought, it’severywhere I turn! According to the placard, the doors had been commissioned asa “votive” offering to God—a show of gratitude that Florence had somehowsurvived the plague.Langdon forced his eyes back to the Gates of Paradise while Ignazio’s wordsechoed again in his mind. The gates are open to you, but you must hurry.Despite Ignazio’s promise, the Gates of Paradise were definitely closed, as theyalways were, except for rare religious holidays. Normally, tourists entered thebaptistry from a different side, through the north door.Sienna was on tiptoe beside him, trying to see around the crowd. “There’s nodoor handle,” she said. “No keyhole. Nothing.”True, Langdon thought, knowing Ghiberti was not about to ruin his masterpiecewith something as mundane as a doorknob. “The doors swing in. They lock from theinside.”Sienna thought a moment, pursing her lips. “So from out here … nobody would knowif the doors were locked or not.”Langdon nodded. “I’m hoping that’s precisely Ignazio’s thinking.”He walked a few steps to his right and glanced around the north side of thebuilding to a far less ornate door—the tourist entrance—where a bored-lookingdocent was smoking a cigarette and rebuffing inquiring tourists by pointing tothe sign on the entrance: APERTURA 1300–1700.It doesn’t open for several hours, Langdon thought, pleased. And nobody has beeninside yet.Instinctively, he checked his wristwatch, and was again reminded that MickeyMouse was gone.When he returned to Sienna, she had been joined by a group of tourists who weretaking photos through the simple iron fence that had been erected several feetin front of the Gates of Paradise to prevent tourists from getting too close toGhiberti’s masterwork.This protective gate was made of black wrought iron topped with sunray spikesdipped in gold paint, and resembled the simple estate fencing that oftenenclosed suburban homes. Ambiguously, the informational placard describing theGates of Paradise had been mounted not on the spectacular bronze doorsthemselves but on this very ordinary protective gate.Langdon had heard that the placard’s placement sometimes caused confusion amongtourists, and sure enough, just then a chunky woman in a Juicy Couture sweatsuit pushed through the crowd, glanced at the placard, frowned at thewrought-iron gate, and scoffed, “Gates of Paradise? Hell, it looks like my dogfence at home!” Then she toddled off before anyone could explain.Sienna reached up and grasped the protective gate, casually peering through thebars at the locking mechanism on the back.“Look,” she whispered, turning wide-eyed to Langdon. “The padlock on the back isunlocked.”Langdon looked through the bars and saw she was right. The padlock waspositioned as if it were locked, but on closer inspection, he could see that itwas definitely unlocked.The gates are open to you, but you must hurry.Langdon raised his eyes to the Gates of Paradise beyond the fencing. If Ignaziohad indeed left the baptistry’s huge doors unbolted, they should simply swingopen. The challenge, however, would be getting inside without drawing theattention of every single person in the square, including, no doubt, the policeand Duomo guards.“Look out!” a woman suddenly screamed nearby. “He’s going to jump!” Her voicewas filled with terror. “Up there on the bell tower!”Langdon spun now from the doors, and saw that the woman shouting was … Sienna.She stood five yards away, pointing up into Giotto’s bell tower and shouting,“There at the top! He’s going to jump!”Every set of eyes turned skyward, searching the top of the bell tower. Nearby,others began pointing, squinting, calling out to one another.“Someone is jumping?!”“Where?!”“I don’t see him!”“Over there on the left?!”It took only seconds for people across the square to sense the panic and followsuit, staring up at the top of the bell tower. With the fury of a wildfireconsuming a parched hay field, the rush of fear billowed out across the piazzauntil the entire crowd was craning their necks, looking upward, and pointing.Viral marketing, Langdon thought, knowing he’d have only a moment to act.Immediately he grabbed the wrought-iron fence and swung it open just as Siennareturned to his side and slipped with him into the small space beyond. Once thegate was closed behind them, they turned to face the fifteen-foot bronze doors.Hoping he had understood Ignazio correctly, Langdon threw his shoulder into oneside of the massive double doors and drove his legs hard.Nothing happened, and then, painfully slowly, the cumbersome section began tomove. The doors are open! The Gates of Paradise swung open about one foot, andSienna wasted no time turning sideways and slipping through. Langdon followedsuit, inching sideways through the narrow opening into the darkness of thebaptistry.Together, they turned and heaved the door in the opposite direction, quicklyclosing the massive portal with a definitive thud. Instantly, the noise andchaos outside evaporated, leaving only silence.Sienna pointed to a long wooden beam on the floor at their feet, which clearlyhad been set in side brackets on either side of the door to serve as abarricade. “Ignazio must have removed it for you,” she said.Together they lifted the beam and dropped it back into its brackets, effectivelylocking the Gates of Paradise … and sealing themselves safely inside.For a long moment Langdon and Sienna stood in silence, leaning against the doorand catching their breath. Compared to the noises of the piazza outside, theinterior of the baptistry felt as peaceful as heaven itself.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Outside the Baptistry of San Giovanni, the man in the Plume Paris spectacles anda paisley necktie moved through the crowd, ignoring the uneasy stares of thosewho noticed his bloody rash.He had just reached the bronze doors through which Robert Langdon and his blondcompanion had cleverly disappeared; even from outside, he had heard the heavythud of the doors being barred from within.No entry this way.Slowly, the ambience in the piazza was returning to normal. The tourists who hadbeen staring upward in anticipation were now losing interest. No jumper.Everyone moved on.The man was itchy again, his rash getting worse. Now his fingertips were swollenand cracking as well. He slid his hands into his pockets to keep himself fromscratching. His chest continued to throb as he began circling the octagon insearch of another entrance.He had barely made it around the corner when he felt a sharp pain on his Adam’sapple and realized he was scratching again."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 55LEGEND PROCLAIMS THAT it is physically impossible, upon entering the Baptistryof San Giovanni, not to look up. Langdon, despite having been in this room manytimes, now felt the mystical pull of the space, and let his gaze climb skywardto the ceiling.High, high overhead, the surface of the baptistry’s octagonal vault spanned morethan eighty feet from side to side. It glistened and shimmered as if it weremade of smoldering coals. Its burnished amber-gold surface reflected the ambientlight unevenly from more than a million smalti tiles—tiny ungrouted mosaicpieces hand-cut from a glassy silica glaze—which were arranged in six concentricrings in which scenes from the Bible were depicted.Adding stark drama to the lustrous upper portion of the room, natural lightpierced the dark space through a central oculus—much like the one in Rome’sPantheon—assisted by a series of high, small, deeply recessed windows that threwshafts of illumination that were so focused and tight that they seemed almostsolid, like structural beams propped at ever-changing angles.As Langdon walked with Sienna deeper into the room, he took in the legendaryceiling mosaic—a multitiered representation of heaven and hell, very much likethe depiction in The Divine Comedy.Dante Alighieri saw this as a child, Langdon thought. Inspiration from above.Langdon fixed his gaze now on the centerpiece of the mosaic. Hovering directlyabove the main altar rose a twenty-seven-foot-tall Jesus Christ, seated injudgment over the saved and the damned.At Jesus’ right hand, the righteous received the reward of everlasting life.On His left hand, however, the sinful were stoned, roasted on spikes, and eatenby all manner of creatures.Overseeing the torture was a colossal mosaic of Satan portrayed as an infernal,man-eating beast. Langdon always flinched when he saw this figure, which morethan seven hundred years ago had stared down at the young Dante Alighieri,terrifying him and eventually inspiring his vivid portrayal of what lurked inthe final ring of hell.The frightening mosaic overhead depicted a horned devil that was in the processof consuming a human being headfirst. The victim’s legs dangled from Satan’smouth in a way that resembled the flailing legs of the half-buried sinners inDante’s Malebolge.Lo ’mperador del doloroso regno, Langdon thought, recalling Dante’s text. Theemperor of the despondent kingdom.Slithering from the ears of Satan were two massive, writhing snakes, also in theprocess of consuming sinners, giving the impression that Satan had three heads,exactly as Dante described him in the final canto of his Inferno. Langdonsearched his memory and recalled fragments of Dante’s imagery.On his head he had three faces … his three chins gushing a bloody froth … histhree mouths used as grinders … gnashing sinners three at once.That Satan’s evil was threefold, Langdon knew, was fraught with symbolicmeaning: it placed him in perfect balance with the threefold glory of the HolyTrinity.As Langdon stared up at the horrific sight, he tried to imagine the effect themosaic had on the youthful Dante, who had attended services at this church yearafter year, and seen Satan staring down at him each time he prayed. Thismorning, however, Langdon had the uneasy feeling that the devil was staringdirectly at him.He quickly lowered his gaze to the baptistry’s second-story balcony and standinggallery—the lone area from which women were permitted to view baptisms—and thendown to the suspended tomb of Antipope John XXIII, his body lying in repose highon the wall like a cave dweller or a subject in a magician’s levitation trick.Finally, his gaze reached the ornately tiled floor, which many believedcontained references to medieval astronomy. He let his eyes move across theintricate black-and-white patterns until they reached the very center of theroom.And there it is, he thought, knowing he was staring at the exact spot whereDante Alighieri had been baptized in the latter half of the thirteenth century.“ ‘I shall return as poet … at my baptismal font,’ ” Langdon declared, his voiceechoing through the empty space. “This is it.”Sienna looked troubled as she eyed the center of the floor, where Langdon wasnow pointing. “But … there’s nothing here.”“Not anymore,” Langdon replied.All that remained was a large reddish-brown octagon of pavement. This unusuallyplain, eight-sided area clearly interrupted the pattern of the more ornatelydesigned floor and resembled nothing so much as a large, patched-up hole, which,in fact, was precisely what it was.Langdon quickly explained that the baptistry’s original baptismal font had beena large octagonal pool located at the very center of this room. While modernfonts were usually raised basins, earlier fonts were more akin to the literalmeaning of the word font—“springs” or “fountains”—in this case a deep pool ofwater into which participants could be more deeply immersed. Langdon wonderedwhat this stone chamber had sounded like as children screamed in fear whilebeing literally submerged in the large pool of icy water that once stood in themiddle of the floor.“Baptisms here were cold and scary,” Langdon said. “True rites of passage.Dangerous even. Allegedly Dante once jumped into the font to save a drowningchild. In any case, the original font was covered over at some point in thesixteenth century.”Sienna’s eyes now began darting around the building with obvious concern. “Butif Dante’s baptismal font is gone … where did Ignazio hide the mask?!”Langdon understood her alarm. There was no shortage of hiding places in thismassive chamber—behind columns, statues, tombs, inside niches, at the altar,even upstairs.Nonetheless, Langdon felt remarkably confident as he turned and faced the doorthrough which they’d just entered. “We should start over there,” he said,pointing to an area against the wall just to the right of the Gates of Paradise.On a raised platform, behind a decorative gate, there sat a tall hexagonalplinth of carved marble, which resembled a small altar or service table. Theexterior was so intricately carved that it resembled a mother-of-pearl cameo.Atop the marble base sat a polished wooden top with a diameter of about threefeet.Sienna looked uncertain as she followed Langdon over to it. As they ascended thesteps and moved inside the protective gate, Sienna looked more closely and drewa startled breath, realizing what she was looking at.Langdon smiled. Exactly, it’s not an altar or table. The polished wooden top wasin fact a lid—a covering for the hollow structure.“A baptismal font?” she asked.Langdon nodded. “If Dante were baptized today, it would be in this basin righthere.” Wasting no time, he took a deep, purposeful breath and placed his palmson the wooden cover, feeling a tingle of anticipation as he prepared to removeit.Langdon tightly gripped the edges of the cover and heaved it to one side,carefully sliding the top off the marble base and placing it on the floor besidethe font. Then he peered down into the two-foot-wide, dark, hollow space within.The eerie sight made Langdon swallow hard.From out of the shadows, the dead face of Dante Alighieri was looking back athim."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 56SEEK AND YE shall find.Langdon stood at the rim of the baptismal font and stared down at the paleyellow death mask, whose wrinkled countenance gazed blankly upward. The hookednose and protruding chin were unmistakable.Dante Alighieri.The lifeless face was disturbing enough, and yet something about its position inthe font seemed almost supernatural. For a moment Langdon was unsure what he wasseeing.Is the mask … hovering?Langdon crouched lower, peering more closely at the scene before him. The fontwas several feet deep—more of a vertical well than a shallow basin—its steepwalls dropping down to a hexagonal repository that was filled with water.Strangely, the mask seemed to be suspended partway down the font … perched justabove the surface of the water as if by magic.It took a moment for Langdon to realize what was causing the illusion. The fonthad a vertical central spindle that rose halfway up and flattened into a kind ofsmall metal platter just above the water. The platter appeared to be adecorative fountainhead and perhaps a place to rest a baby’s bottom, but it wascurrently serving as a pedestal on which the mask of Dante rested, elevatedsafely above the water.Neither Langdon nor Sienna said a word as they stood side by side gazing down atthe craggy face of Dante Alighieri, still sealed in his Ziploc bag, as if he’dbeen suffocated. For a moment the image of a face staring up out of awater-filled basin conjured for Langdon his own terrifying experience as achild, stuck at the bottom of a well, staring skyward in desperation.Pushing the thought from his mind, he carefully reached down and gripped themask on either side, where Dante’s ears would have been. Although the face wassmall by modern standards, the ancient plaster was heavier than he’d expected.He slowly lifted the mask out of the font and held it up so that he and Siennacould examine it more closely.Even viewed through the plastic bag, the mask was remarkably lifelike. Everywrinkle and blemish of the old poet’s face had been captured by the wet plaster.With the exception of an old crack down the center of the mask, it was inperfect condition.“Turn it over,” Sienna whispered. “Let’s see the back.”Langdon was already doing just that. The security video from the Palazzo Vecchiohad clearly shown Langdon and Ignazio discovering something on the reverse sideof the mask—something of such startling interest that the two men hadessentially walked out of the palace with the artifact.Taking exceptional care not to drop the fragile plaster, Langdon flipped themask over and laid it facedown in his right palm so they could examine the back.Unlike the weathered, textured face of Dante, the inside of the mask was smoothand bare. Because the mask was never meant to be worn, its back side had beenfilled in with plaster to give some solidity to the delicate piece, resulting ina featureless, concave surface, like a shallow soup bowl.Langdon didn’t know what he had expected to find on the back of the mask, but itmost certainly was not this.Nothing.Nothing at all.Just a smooth, empty surface.Sienna seemed equally confused. “It’s blank plaster,” she whispered. “If there’snothing here, what did you and Ignazio see?”I have no idea, Langdon thought, pulling the plastic bag taut across the plasterfor a clearer view. There’s nothing here! With mounting distress, Langdon raisedthe mask into a shaft of light and studied it closely. As he tipped the objectover for a better view, he thought for an instant that he might have glimpsed afaint discoloration near the top—a line of markings running horizontally acrossthe inside of Dante’s forehead.A natural blemish? Or maybe … something else. Langdon immediately spun andpointed to a hinged panel of marble on the wall behind them. “Look in there,” hetold Sienna. “See if there are towels.”Sienna looked skeptical, but obeyed, opening the discreetly hidden cupboard,which contained three items—a valve for controlling the water level in the font,a light switch for controlling the spotlight above the font, and … a stack oflinen towels.Sienna gave Langdon a surprised look, but Langdon had toured enough churchesworldwide to know that baptismal fonts almost always afforded their priests easyaccess to emergency swaddling cloths—the unpredictability of infants’ bladders auniversal risk of christenings.“Good,” he said, eyeing the towels. “Hold the mask a second?” He gentlytransferred the mask to Sienna’s hands and then set to work.First, Langdon retrieved the hexagonal lid and heaved it back up onto the fontto restore the small, altarlike table they had first seen. Then he grabbedseveral of the linen towels from the cupboard and spread them out like atablecloth. Finally, he flipped the font’s light switch, and the spotlightdirectly overhead sprang to life, illuminating the baptismal area and shiningbrightly down on the covered surface.Sienna gently laid the mask on the font while Langdon retrieved more towels,which he used like oven mitts to slide the mask from the Ziploc bag, careful notto touch it with his bare hands. Moments later, Dante’s death mask layunsheathed and naked, faceup beneath the bright light, like the head of ananesthetized patient on an operating table.The mask’s dramatic texturing appeared even more unsettling in the light, thecreases and wrinkles of old age accentuated by the discolored plaster. Langdonwasted no time using his makeshift mitts to flip the mask over and lay itfacedown.The back side of the mask looked markedly less aged than the front—clean andwhite rather than dingy and yellow.Sienna cocked her head, looking puzzled. “Does this side look newer to you?”Admittedly, the color difference was more emphatic than Langdon would haveimagined, but this side was most certainly the same age as the front. “Unevenaging,” he said. “The back of the mask has been shielded by the display case sohas never suffered the aging effects of sunlight.” Langdon made a mental note todouble the SPF of his sunscreen.“Hold on,” Sienna said, leaning in close to the mask. “Look! On the forehead!That must be what you and Ignazio saw.”Langdon’s eyes moved quickly across the smooth white surface to the samediscoloration he had spied earlier through the plastic—a faint line of markingsthat ran horizontally across the inside of Dante’s forehead. Now, however, inthe stark light, Langdon saw clearly that these markings were not a naturalblemish … they were man-made.“It’s … writing,” Sienna whispered, the words catching in her throat. “But …”Langdon studied the inscription on the plaster. It was a single row ofletters—handwritten in a florid script of faint brownish yellow.“That’s all it says?” Sienna said, sounding almost angry.Langdon barely heard her. Who wrote this? he wondered. Someone in Dante’s era?It seemed unlikely. If so, some art historian would have spotted it long agoduring regular cleaning or restoration, and the writing would have become partof the lore of the mask. Langdon had never heard of it.A far more likely source quickly materialized in his mind.Bertrand Zobrist.Zobrist was the mask’s owner and therefore could easily have requested privateaccess to it whenever he wanted. He could have written the text on the back ofthe mask fairly recently and then replaced it in the antique case without anyoneever knowing. The mask’s owner, Marta had told them, won’t even permit our staffto open the case without him present.Langdon quickly explained his theory.Sienna seemed to accept his logic, and yet the prospect clearly troubled her.“It makes no sense,” she said, looking restless. “If we believe Zobrist secretlywrote something on the back of the Dante death mask, and he also went to thetrouble to create that little projector to point to the mask … then why didn’the write something more meaningful? I mean, it’s senseless! You and I have beenlooking all day for the mask, and this is all we find?”Langdon redirected his focus to the text on the back of the mask. Thehandwritten message was very brief—only seven letters long—and admittedly lookedentirely purposeless.Sienna’s frustration is certainly understandable.Langdon, however, felt the familiar thrill of imminent revelation, havingrealized almost instantly that these seven letters would tell him everything heneeded to know about what he and Sienna were to do next.Furthermore, he had detected a faint odor to the mask—a familiar scent thatdivulged why the plaster on the back was so much whiter than the front … and thedifference had nothing to do with aging or sunlight.“I don’t understand,” Sienna said. “The letters are all the same.”Langdon nodded calmly as he studied the line of text—seven identical letterscarefully inscribed in calligraphy across the inside of Dante’s forehead.PPPPPPP“Seven Ps,” Sienna said. “What are we supposed to do with this?”Langdon smiled calmly and raised his eyes to hers. “I suggest we do preciselywhat this message tells us to do.”Sienna stared. “Seven Ps is … a message?”“It is,” he said with a grin. “And if you’ve studied Dante, it’s a very clearone.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Outside the Baptistry of San Giovanni, the man with the necktie wiped hisfingernails on his handkerchief and dabbed at the pustules on his neck. He triedto ignore the burning in his eyes as he squinted at his destination.The tourist entrance.Outside the door, a wearied docent in a blazer smoked a cigarette and redirectedtourists who apparently couldn’t decipher the building’s schedule, which waswritten in international time.APERTURA 1300–1700.The man with the rash checked his watch. It was 10:02 A.M. The baptistry wasclosed for another few hours. He watched the docent for a while and then made uphis mind. He removed the gold stud from his ear and pocketed it. Then he pulledout his wallet and checked its contents. In addition to assorted credit cardsand a wad of euros, he was carrying over three thousand U.S. dollars in cash.Thankfully, avarice was an international sin."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 57PECCATUM … PECCATUM … PECCATUM …The seven Ps written on the back of Dante’s death mask immediately pulledLangdon’s thoughts back into the text of The Divine Comedy. For a moment he wasback onstage in Vienna, presenting his lecture “Divine Dante: Symbols of Hell.”“We have now descended,” his voice resounded over the speakers, “passing downthrough the nine rings of hell to the center of the earth, coming face-to-facewith Satan himself.”Langdon moved from slide to slide through a series of three-headed Satans fromvarious works of art—Botticelli’s Mappa, the Florence baptistry’s mosaic, andAndrea di Cione’s terrifying black demon, its fur soiled with the crimson bloodof its victims.“Together,” Langdon continued, “we have climbed down the shaggy chest of Satan,reversed direction as gravity shifted, and emerged from the gloomy underworld …once again to see the stars.”Langdon advanced slides until he reached an image he had shown earlier—theiconic Domenico di Michelino painting from inside the duomo, which depicted thered-robed Dante standing outside the walls of Florence. “And if you lookcarefully … you will see those stars.”Langdon pointed to the star-filled sky that arched above Dante’s head. “As yousee, the heavens are constructed in a series of nine concentric spheres aroundthe earth. This nine-tiered structure of paradise is intended to reflect andbalance the nine rings of the underworld. As you’ve probably noticed, the numbernine is a recurring theme for Dante.”Langdon paused, taking a sip of water and letting the crowd catch their breathafter their harrowing descent and final exit from hell.“So, after enduring the horrors of the inferno, you must all be very excited tomove toward paradise. Unfortunately, in the world of Dante, nothing is eversimple.” He heaved a dramatic sigh. “To ascend to paradise we all must—bothfiguratively and literally—climb a mountain.”Langdon pointed to the Michelino painting. On the horizon, behind Dante, theaudience could see a single cone-shaped mountain rising into the heavens.Spiraling up the mountain, a pathway circled the cone repeatedly—ninetimes—ascending in ever-tightening terraces toward the top. Along the pathway,naked figures trudged upward in misery, enduring various penances on the way.“I give you Mount Purgatory,” Langdon announced. “And sadly, this grueling,nine-ringed ascent is the only route from the depths of inferno to the glory ofparadise. On this path, you can see the repentant souls ascending … each payingan appropriate price for a given sin. The envious must climb with their eyessewn shut so they cannot covet; the prideful must carry huge stones on theirbacks to bend them low in a humble manner; the gluttonous must climb withoutfood or water, thereby suffering excruciating hunger; and the lustful mustascend through hot flames to purge themselves of passion’s heat.” He paused.“But before you are permitted the great privilege of climbing this mountain andpurging your sins, you must speak to this individual.”Langdon switched slides to a close-up of the Michelino painting, wherein awinged angel sat on a throne at the foot of Mount Purgatory. At the angel’sfeet, a line of penitent sinners awaited admittance to the upward path.Strangely, the angel was wielding a long sword, the point of which he seemed tobe stabbing into the face of the first person in line.“Who knows,” Langdon called out, “what this angel is doing?”“Stabbing someone in the head?” a voice ventured.“Nope.”Another voice. “Stabbing someone in the eye?”Langdon shook his head. “Anyone else?”A voice way in the back spoke firmly. “Writing on his forehead.”Langdon smiled. “It appears someone back there knows his Dante.” He motionedagain to the painting. “I realize it looks like the angel is stabbing this poorfellow in the forehead, but he is not. According to Dante’s text, the angel whoguards purgatory uses the tip of his sword to write something on his visitors’foreheads before they enter. ‘And what does he write?’ you ask.”Langdon paused for effect. “Strangely, he writes a single letter … which isrepeated seven times. Does anyone know what letter the angel writes seven timeson Dante’s forehead?”“P!” shouted a voice in the crowd.Langdon smiled. “Yes. The letter P. This P signifies peccatum—the Latin word for‘sin.’ And the fact that it is written seven times is symbolic of the SeptemPeccata Mortalia, also known as—”“The Seven Deadly Sins!” someone else shouted.“Bingo. And so, only by ascending through each level of purgatory can you atonefor your sins. With each new level that you ascend, an angel cleanses one of thePs from your forehead until you reach the top, arriving with your brow cleansedof the seven Ps … and your soul purged of all sin.” He winked. “The place iscalled purgatory for a reason.”Langdon emerged from his thoughts to see Sienna staring at him over thebaptismal font. “The seven Ps?” she said, pulling him back to the present andmotioning down to Dante’s death mask. “You say it’s a message? Telling us whatto do?”Langdon quickly explained Dante’s vision of Mount Purgatory, the Ps representingthe Seven Deadly Sins, and the process of cleansing them from the forehead.“Obviously,” Langdon concluded, “Bertrand Zobrist, as the Dante fanatic that hewas, would be familiar with the seven Ps and the process of cleansing them fromthe forehead as a means of moving forward toward paradise.”Sienna looked doubtful. “You think Bertrand Zobrist put those Ps on the maskbecause he wants us to … literally wipe them off the death mask? That’s what youthink we’re supposed to do?”“I realize it’s—”“Robert, even if we wipe off the letters, how does that help us?! We’ll just endup with a totally blank mask.”“Maybe.” Langdon offered a hopeful grin. “Maybe not. I think there’s more therethan meets the eye.” He motioned down to the mask. “Remember how I told you thatthe back of the mask was lighter in color because of uneven aging?”“Yes.”“I may have been wrong,” he said. “The color difference seems too stark to beaging, and the texture of the back has teeth.”“Teeth?”Langdon showed her that the texture on the back was far rougher than that of thefront … and also far grittier, like sandpaper. “In the art world, this roughtexture is called teeth, and painters prefer to paint on a surface that hasteeth because the paint sticks to it better.”“I’m not following.”Langdon smiled. “Do you know what gesso is?”“Sure, painters use it to prime canvases and—” She stopped short, his meaningapparently registering.“Exactly,” Langdon said. “They use gesso to create a clean white toothy surface,and sometimes to cover up unwanted paintings if they want to reuse a canvas.”Now Sienna looked excited. “And you think maybe Zobrist covered the back of thedeath mask with gesso?”“It would explain the teeth and the lighter color. It also might explain why hewould want us to wipe off the seven Ps.”Sienna looked puzzled by this last point.“Smell this,” Langdon said, raising the mask to her face like a priest offeringCommunion.Sienna cringed. “Gesso smells like a wet dog?”“Not all gesso. Regular gesso smells like chalk. Wet dog is acrylic gesso.”“Meaning …?”“Meaning it’s water soluble.”Sienna cocked her head, and Langdon could sense the wheels turning. She shiftedher gaze slowly to the mask and then suddenly back to Langdon, her eyes wide.“You think there’s something under the gesso?”“It would explain a lot.”Sienna immediately gripped the hexagonal wooden font covering and rotated itpartway off, exposing the water below. She grabbed a fresh linen towel andplunged it into the baptismal water. Then she held out the dripping cloth forLangdon. “You should do it.”Langdon placed the mask facedown in his left palm and took the wet linen.Shaking out the excess water, he began dabbing the damp cloth on the inside ofDante’s forehead, moistening the area with the seven calligraphic Ps. Afterseveral dabs with his index finger, he redipped the cloth in the font andcontinued. The ink began smearing.“The gesso is dissolving,” he said excitedly. “The ink is coming off with it.”As he performed the process a third time, Langdon began speaking in a pious andsomber monotone, which resonated in the baptistry. “Through baptism, the LordJesus Christ has freed you from sin and brought you to new life through waterand the Holy Spirit.”Sienna stared at Langdon like he’d lost his mind.He shrugged. “It seemed appropriate.”She rolled her eyes and turned back to the mask. As Langdon continued applyingwater, the original plaster beneath the gesso became visible, its yellowish huemore in keeping with what Langdon would have expected from an artifact this old.When the last of the Ps had disappeared, he dried the area with a clean linenand held the mask up for Sienna to observe.She gasped out loud.Precisely as Langdon had anticipated, there was indeed something hidden beneaththe gesso—a second layer of calligraphy—nine letters written directly onto thepale yellow surface of the original plaster.This time, however, the letters formed a word."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 58“ ‘POSSESSED’?” SIENNA DEMANDED. “I don’t understand.”I’m not sure I do either. Langdon studied the text that had materialized beneaththe seven Ps—a single word emblazoned across the inside of Dante’s forehead.possessed“As in … possessed by the devil?” Sienna asked.Possibly. Langdon turned his gaze overhead to the mosaic of Satan consuming thewretched souls who had never been able to purge themselves of sin. Dante …possessed? It didn’t seem to make much sense.“There’s got to be more,” Sienna contended, taking the mask from Langdon’s handsand studying it more closely. After a moment she began nodding. “Yes, look atthe ends of the word … there’s more text on either side.”Langdon looked again, now seeing the faint shadow of additional text showingthrough the moist gesso at either end of the word possessed.Eagerly, Sienna grabbed the cloth and continued dabbing around the word untilmore text materialized, written on a gentle curve.O you possessed of sturdy intellectLangdon let out a low whistle. “ ‘O, you possessed of sturdy intellect … observethe teachings hidden here … beneath the veil of verses so obscure.’ ”Sienna stared at him. “I’m sorry?”“It’s taken from one of the most famous stanzas of Dante’s Inferno,” Langdonsaid excitedly. “It’s Dante urging his smartest readers to seek the wisdomhidden within his cryptic verse.”Langdon often cited this exact line when teaching literary symbolism; the linewas as close an example as existed to an author waving his arms wildly andshouting: “Hey, readers! There is a symbolic double meaning here!”Sienna began rubbing the back of the mask, more vigorously now.“Careful with that!” Langdon urged.“You’re right,” Sienna announced, zealously wiping away gesso. “The rest ofDante’s quote is here—just as you recalled it.” She paused to dip the cloth backin the font and rinse it out.Langdon looked on in dismay as the water in the baptismal font turned cloudywith dissolved gesso. Our apologies to San Giovanni, he thought, uneasy thatthis sacred font was being used as a sink.When Sienna raised the cloth from the water, it was dripping. She barely wrungit out before placing the soggy cloth in the center of the mask and swishing itaround as if she were cleaning a soup bowl.“Sienna!” Langdon admonished. “That’s an ancient—”“The whole back side has text!” she announced as she scoured the inside of themask. “And it’s written in …” She paused, cocking her head to the left androtating the mask to the right, as if trying to read sideways.“Written in what?” Langdon demanded, unable to see.Sienna finished cleaning the mask and dried it off with a fresh cloth. Then sheset it down in front of him so they could both study the result.When Langdon saw the inside of the mask, he did a double take. The entireconcave surface was covered in text, what had to be nearly a hundred words.Beginning at the top with the line O you possessed of sturdy intellect, the textcontinued in a single, unbroken line … curling down the right side of the maskto the bottom, where it turned upside down and continued back across the bottom,returning up the left side of the mask to the beginning, where it repeated asimilar path in a slightly smaller loop.The path of the text was eerily reminiscent of Mount Purgatory’s spiralingpathway to paradise. The symbologist in Langdon instantly identified the precisespiral. Symmetrical clockwise Archimedean. He had also noted that the number ofrevolutions from the first word, O, to the final period in the center was afamiliar number.Nine.Barely breathing, Langdon turned the mask in slow circles, reading the text asit curled ever inward around the concave bowl, funneling toward the center.image [../Images/00010.jpeg]“The first stanza is Dante, almost verbatim,” Langdon said. “ ‘O you possessedof sturdy intellect, observe the teaching that is hidden here … beneath the veilof verses so obscure.’ ”“And the rest?” Sienna pressed.Langdon shook his head. “I don’t think so. It’s written in a similar versepattern, but I don’t recognize the text as Dante’s. It looks like someone isimitating his style.”“Zobrist,” Sienna whispered. “It has to be.”Langdon nodded. It was as good a guess as any. Zobrist, after all, by alteringBotticelli’s Mappa dell’Inferno, had already revealed his proclivity forcollaborating with the masters and modifying great works of art to suit hisneeds.“The rest of the text is very strange,” Langdon said, again rotating the maskand reading inward. “It talks about … severing the heads from horses … pluckingup the bones of the blind.” He skimmed ahead to the final line, which waswritten in a tight circle at the very center of the mask. He drew a startledbreath. “It also mentions ‘bloodred waters.’ ”Sienna’s eyebrows arched. “Just like your visions of the silver-haired woman?”Langdon nodded, puzzling over the text. The bloodred waters … of the lagoon thatreflects no stars?“Look,” she whispered, reading over his shoulder and pointing to a single wordpartway through the spiral. “A specific location.”Langdon’s eyes found the word, which he had skimmed over on his first pass. Itwas the name of one of the most spectacular and unique cities in the world.Langdon felt a chill, knowing it also happened to be the city in which DanteAlighieri famously became infected with the deadly disease that killed him.Venice.Langdon and Sienna studied the cryptic verses in silence for several moments.The poem was disturbing and macabre, and hard to decipher. Use of the words dogeand lagoon confirmed for Langdon beyond any doubt that the poem was indeedreferencing Venice—a unique Italian water-world city made up of hundreds ofinterconnected lagoons and ruled for centuries by a Venetian head of state knownas a doge.At a glance, Langdon could not discern exactly where in Venice this poem waspointing, but it definitely seemed to be urging the reader to follow itsdirections.Place thine ear to the ground, listening for the sounds of trickling water.“It’s pointing underground,” Sienna said, reading along with him.Langdon gave an uneasy nod as he read the next line.Follow deep into the sunken palace … for here, in the darkness, the chthonicmonster waits.“Robert?” Sienna asked uneasily. “What kind of monster?”“Chthonic,” Langdon replied. “The c-h is silent. It means ‘dwelling beneath theearth.’ ”Before Langdon could continue, the loud clunk of a dead bolt echoed across thebaptistry. The tourist entrance had apparently just been unlocked from outside.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]“Grazie mille,” said the man with the rash on his face. A thousand thanks.The baptistry docent nodded nervously as he pocketed the five hundred dollarscash and glanced around to make sure nobody was watching.“Cinque minuti,” the docent reminded, discreetly swinging open the unbolted doorjust wide enough for the man with the rash to slip inside. The docent closed thedoor, sealing the man inside and blocking out all sound from outside. Fiveminutes.Initially the docent had refused to take pity on the man who claimed to havecome all the way from America to pray at the Baptistry of San Giovanni in hopesof curing his terrible skin disease. Eventually, though, he had been inspired tobecome sympathetic, aided no doubt by an offer of five hundred dollars for fiveminutes alone in the baptistry … combined with the growing fear that thiscontagious-looking person would stand there beside him for the next three hoursuntil the building opened.Now, as he moved stealthily into the octagonal sanctuary, the man felt his eyesdrawn reflexively upward. Holy shit. The ceiling was like nothing he’d everseen. A three-headed demon stared down directly at him, and he quickly loweredhis gaze to the floor.The space appeared to be deserted.Where the hell are they?As the man scanned the room, his eyes fell on the main altar. It was a massiverectangular block of marble, set back in a niche, behind a barrier of stanchionsand swags to keep spectators away.The altar appeared to be the only hiding place in the entire room. Moreover, oneof the swags was swinging slightly … as if it had just been disturbed.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Behind the altar, Langdon and Sienna crouched in silence. They had barely hadtime to collect the dirty towels and straighten the font cover before diving outof sight behind the main altar, with the death mask carefully in tow. The planwas to hide here until the room filled up with tourists, and then discreetlyexit among the crowd.The baptistry’s north door had definitely just been opened—at least for amoment—because Langdon had heard sounds emanating from the piazza, but then justas abruptly, the door had been closed, and all had gone quiet again.Now, back in the silence, Langdon heard a single set of footsteps moving acrossthe stone floor.A docent? Checking the room before opening it to tourists later today?He had not had time to extinguish the spotlight over the baptismal font andwondered if the docent would notice. Apparently not. The footsteps were movingbriskly in their direction, pausing just in front of the altar at the swag thatLangdon and Sienna had just vaulted over.There was a long silence.“Robert, it’s me,” a man’s voice said angrily. “I know you’re back there. Getthe hell out here and explain yourself.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 59THERE’S NO POINT in pretending I’m not here.Langdon motioned for Sienna to remain crouched safely out of sight, holding theDante death mask, which he had resealed in the Ziploc bag.Then, slowly, Langdon rose to his feet. Standing like a priest behind the altarof the baptistry, Langdon gazed out at his congregation of one. The strangerfacing him had sandy-brown hair, designer glasses, and a terrible rash on hisface and neck. He scratched nervously at his irritated neck, his swollen eyesflashing daggers of confusion and anger.“You want to tell me what the hell you’re doing, Robert?!” he demanded, steppingover the swag and advancing toward Langdon. His accent was American.“Sure,” Langdon replied politely. “But first, tell me who you are.”The man stopped short, looking incredulous. “What did you say?!”Langdon sensed something vaguely familiar in the man’s eyes … his voice, too,maybe. I’ve met him … somehow, somewhere. Langdon repeated his question calmly.“Please tell me who you are and how I know you.”The man threw up his hands in disbelief. “Jonathan Ferris? World HealthOrganization? The guy who flew to Harvard University and picked you up!?”Langdon tried to process what he was hearing.“Why haven’t you called in?!” the man demanded, still scratching at his neck andcheeks, which looked red and blistered. “And who the hell is the woman I saw youcome in here with?! Is she the one you’re working for now?”Sienna scrambled to her feet beside Langdon and immediately took charge. “Dr.Ferris? I’m Sienna Brooks. I’m also a doctor. I work here in Florence. ProfessorLangdon was shot in the head last night. He has retrograde amnesia, and hedoesn’t know who you are or what happened to him over the last two days. I’mhere because I’m helping him.”As Sienna’s words echoed through the empty baptistry, the man cocked his head,puzzled, as if her meaning had not quite registered. After a dazed beat, hestaggered back a step, steadying himself on one of the stanchions.“Oh … my God,” he stammered. “That explains everything.”Langdon watched the anger drain from the man’s face.“Robert,” the newcomer whispered, “we thought you had …” He shook his head as iftrying to get the pieces to fall into place. “We thought you had switched sides… that maybe they had paid you off … or threatened you … We just didn’t know!”“I’m the only one he’s spoken to,” Sienna said. “All he knows is he woke up lastnight in my hospital with people trying to kill him. Also, he’s been havingterrible visions—dead bodies, plague victims, and some woman with silver hairand a serpent amulet telling him—”“Elizabeth!” the man blurted. “That’s Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey! Robert, she’s theperson who recruited you to help us!”“Well, if that’s her,” Sienna said, “I hope you know that she’s in trouble. Wesaw her trapped in the back of a van full of soldiers, and she looked like she’dbeen drugged or something.”The man nodded slowly, closing his eyes. His eyelids looked puffy and red.“What’s wrong with your face?” Sienna demanded.He opened his eyes. “I’m sorry?”“Your skin? It looks like you contracted something. Are you ill?”The man looked taken aback, and while Sienna’s question was certainly blunt tothe point of rudeness, Langdon had wondered the same thing. Considering thenumber of plague references he’d encountered today, the sight of red, blisteringskin was unsettling.“I’m fine,” the man said. “It was the damned hotel soap. I’m deathly allergic tosoy, and most of these perfumed Italian soaps are soy-based. Stupid me for notchecking.”Sienna heaved a sigh of relief, her shoulders relaxing now. “Thank God youdidn’t eat it. Contact dermatitis beats anaphylactic shock.”They shared an awkward laugh.“Tell me,” Sienna ventured, “does the name Bertrand Zobrist mean anything toyou?”The man froze, looking as if he’d just come face-to-face with the three-headeddevil.“We believe we just found a message from him,” Sienna said. “It points tosomeplace in Venice. Does that make any sense to you?”The man’s eyes were wild now. “Jesus, yes! Absolutely! Where is it pointing!?”Sienna drew a breath, clearly prepared to tell this man everything about thespiraling poem she and Langdon had just discovered on the mask, but Langdoninstinctively placed a quieting hand on hers. The man certainly appeared to bean ally, but after today’s events, Langdon’s gut told him to trust no one.Moreover, the man’s tie rang a bell, and he sensed he might very well be thesame man he had seen praying in the small Dante church earlier. Was he followingus?“How did you find us in here?” Langdon demanded.The man still looked puzzled that Langdon was not recalling things. “Robert, youcalled me last night to say you had set up a meeting with a museum directornamed Ignazio Busoni. Then you disappeared. You never called in. When I heardIgnazio Busoni had been found dead, I got worried. I’ve been over here lookingfor you all morning. I saw the police activity outside the Palazzo Vecchio, andwhile waiting to find out what happened, by chance I saw you crawling out of atiny door with …” He glanced over at Sienna, apparently drawing a blank.“Sienna,” she prompted. “Brooks.”“I’m sorry … with Dr. Brooks. I followed you hoping to learn what the hell youwere doing.”“I saw you in the Cerchi church, praying, didn’t I?”“Yes! I was trying to figure out what you were doing, but it made no sense! Youseemed to leave the church like a man on a mission, and so I followed you. WhenI saw you sneak into the baptistry, I decided it was time to confront you. Ipaid off the docent for a couple minutes alone in here.”“Gutsy move,” Langdon noted, “if you thought I had turned on you.”The man shook his head. “Something told me you would never do that. ProfessorRobert Langdon? I knew there had to be some other explanation. But amnesia?Incredible. I never would have guessed.”The man with the rash began scratching nervously again. “Listen, I was givenonly five minutes. We need to get out of here, now. If I found you, then thepeople trying to kill you might find you, too. There is a lot going on that youdon’t understand. We need to get to Venice. Immediately. The trick will begetting out of Florence unseen. The people who have Dr. Sinskey … the oneschasing you … they have eyes everywhere.” He motioned toward the door.Langdon held his ground, finally feeling like he was about to get some answers.“Who are the soldiers in black suits? Why are they trying to kill me?”“Long story,” the man said. “I’ll explain on the way.”Langdon frowned, not entirely liking this answer. He motioned to Sienna andushered her off to one side, talking to her in hushed tones. “Do you trust him?What do you think?”Sienna looked at Langdon like he was crazy for asking. “What do I think? I thinkhe’s with the World Health Organization! I think he’s our best bet for gettinganswers!”“And the rash?”Sienna shrugged. “It’s exactly what he says—severe contact dermatitis.”“And if it’s not what he says?” Langdon whispered. “If it’s … something else?”“Something else?” She gave him an incredulous look. “Robert, it’s not theplague, if that’s what you’re asking. He’s a doctor, for heaven’s sake. If hehad a deadly disease and knew he was contagious, he wouldn’t be reckless enoughto be out infecting the world.”“What if he didn’t realize he had the plague?”Sienna pursed her lips, thinking a moment. “Then I’m afraid you and I arealready screwed … along with everyone in the general area.”“You know, your bedside manner could use some work.”“Just being honest.” Sienna handed Langdon the Ziploc bag containing the deathmask. “You can carry our little friend.”As the two returned to Dr. Ferris, they could see that he was just ending aquiet phone call.“I just called my driver,” the man said. “He’ll meet us out in front by the—”Dr. Ferris stopped short, staring down at Langdon’s hand and seeing, for thefirst time, the dead face of Dante Alighieri.“Christ!” Ferris said, recoiling. “What the hell is that?!”“Long story,” Langdon replied. “I’ll explain on the way.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 60NEW YORK EDITOR Jonas Faukman awoke to the sound of his home-office lineringing. He rolled over and checked the clock: 4:28 A.M.In the world of book publishing, late-night emergencies were as rare asovernight success. Unnerved, Faukman slipped out of bed and hurried down thehall into his office.“Hello?” The voice on the line was a familiar deep baritone. “Jonas, thankheaven you’re home. It’s Robert. I hope I didn’t wake you.”“Of course you woke me! It’s four o’clock in the morning!”“Sorry, I’m overseas.”They don’t teach time zones at Harvard?“I’m in some trouble, Jonas, and I need a favor.” Langdon’s voice sounded tense.“It involves your corporate NetJets card.”“NetJets?” Faukman gave an incredulous laugh. “Robert, we’re in book publishing.We don’t have access to private jets.”“We both know you’re lying, my friend.”Faukman sighed. “Okay, let me rephrase that. We don’t have access to privatejets for authors of tomes about religious history. If you want to write FiftyShades of Iconography, we can talk.”“Jonas, whatever the flight costs, I’ll pay you back. You have my word. Have Iever broken a promise to you?”Other than missing your last deadline by three years? Nevertheless Faukmansensed the urgency in Langdon’s tone. “Tell me what’s going on. I’ll try tohelp.”“I don’t have time to explain, but I really need you to do this for me. It’s amatter of life and death.”Faukman had worked with Langdon long enough to be familiar with his wry sense ofhumor, but he heard no trace of joking in Langdon’s anxious tone at that moment.The man is dead serious. Faukman exhaled, and made up his mind. My financemanager is going to crucify me. Thirty seconds later, Faukman had written downthe details of Langdon’s specific flight request.“Is everything okay?” Langdon asked, apparently sensing his editor’s hesitationand surprise over the details of the flight request.“Yeah, I just thought you were in the States,” Faukman said. “I’m surprised tolearn you’re in Italy.”“You and me both,” Langdon said. “Thanks again, Jonas. I’m heading for theairport now.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]NetJets’ U.S. operations center is located in Columbus, Ohio, with a flightsupport team on call around the clock.Owner services representative Deb Kier had just received a call from a corporatefractional owner in New York. “One moment, sir,” she said, adjusting her headsetand typing at her terminal. “Technically that would be a NetJets Europe flight,but I can help you with it.” She quickly patched into the NetJets Europe system,centered in Paço de Arcos, Portugal, and checked the current positioning oftheir jets in and around Italy.“Okay, sir,” she said, “it looks like we have a Citation Excel positioned inMonaco, which we could have routed to Florence in just under an hour. Would thatbe adequate for Mr. Langdon?”“Let’s hope so,” the man from the publishing company replied, sounding exhaustedand a bit annoyed. “We do appreciate it.”“Entirely our pleasure,” Deb said. “And Mr. Langdon would like to fly toGeneva?”“Apparently.”Deb kept typing. “All set,” she finally said. “Mr. Langdon is confirmed out ofTassignano FBO in Lucca, which is about fifty miles west of Florence. He will bedeparting at eleven-twenty A.M. local time. Mr. Langdon needs to be at the FBOten minutes before wheels up. You’ve requested no ground transportation, nocatering, and you’ve given me his passport information, so we’re all set. Willthere be anything else?”“A new job?” he said with a laugh. “Thanks. You’ve been very helpful.”“Our pleasure. Have a nice night.” Deb ended the call and turned back to herscreen to complete the reservation. She entered Robert Langdon’s passportinformation and was about to continue when her screen began flashing a red alertbox. Deb read the message, her eyes widening.This must be a mistake.She tried entering Langdon’s passport again. The blinking warning came up again.This same alert would have shown up on any airline computer in the world hadLangdon tried to book a flight.Deb Kier stared a long moment in disbelief. She knew NetJets took customerprivacy very seriously, and yet this alert trumped all of their corporateprivacy regulations.Deb Kier immediately called the authorities.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Agent Brüder snapped his mobile phone shut and began herding his men back intothe vans.“Langdon’s on the move,” he announced. “He’s taking a private jet to Geneva.Wheels up in just under an hour out of Lucca FBO, fifty miles west. If we move,we can get there before he takes off.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]At that same moment a hired Fiat sedan was racing northward along the Via deiPanzani, leaving the Piazza del Duomo behind and making its way towardFlorence’s Santa Maria Novella train station.In the backseat, Langdon and Sienna huddled low while Dr. Ferris sat in frontwith the driver. The reservation with NetJets had been Sienna’s idea. With luck,it would provide enough misdirection to allow the three of them to pass safelythrough the Florence train station, which undoubtedly would otherwise have beenpacked with police. Fortunately, Venice was only two hours away by train, anddomestic train travel required no passport.Langdon looked to Sienna, who seemed to be studying Dr. Ferris with concern. Theman was in obvious pain, his breathing labored, as if it hurt every time heinhaled.I hope she’s right about his ailment, Langdon thought, eyeing the man’s rash andpicturing all the germs floating around in the cramped little car. Even hisfingertips looked like they were puffy and red. Langdon pushed the concern fromhis mind and looked out the window.As they approached the train station, they passed the Grand Hotel Baglioni,which often hosted events for an art conference Langdon attended every year.Seeing it, Langdon realized he was about to do something he had never beforedone in his life.I’m leaving Florence without visiting the David.With quiet apologies to Michelangelo, Langdon turned his eyes to the trainstation ahead … and his thoughts to Venice."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 61LANGDON’S GOING TO Geneva?Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey felt increasingly ill as she rocked groggily in thebackseat of the van, which was now racing out of Florence, heading west toward aprivate airfield outside of the city.Geneva makes no sense, Sinskey told herself.The only relevant connection to Geneva was that it was the site of the WHO’sworld headquarters. Is Langdon looking for me there? It seemed nonsensicalconsidering that Langdon knew Sinskey was here in Florence.Another thought now struck her.My God … is Zobrist targeting Geneva?Zobrist was a man who was attuned to symbolism, and creating a “ground zero” atthe World Health Organization’s headquarters admittedly had some elegance to it,considering his yearlong battle with Sinskey. Then again, if Zobrist was lookingfor a receptive flash point for a plague, Geneva was a poor choice. Relative toother metropolises, the city was geographically isolated and was rather coldthis time of year. Most plagues took root in overcrowded, warmer environments.Geneva was more than a thousand feet above sea level, and hardly a suitableplace to start a pandemic. No matter how much Zobrist despises me.So the question remained—why was Langdon going there? The American professor’sbizarre travel destination was yet another entry in the growing list of hisinexplicable behaviors that began last night, and despite her best efforts,Sinskey was having a very hard time coming up with any rational explanation forthem.Whose side is he on?Admittedly, Sinskey had known Langdon only a few days, but she was usually agood judge of character, and she refused to believe that a man like RobertLangdon could be seduced with money. And yet, he broke contact with us lastnight. Now he seemed to be running around like some kind of rogue operative. Washe somehow persuaded to think that Zobrist’s actions make some kind of twistedsense?The thought gave her a chill.No, she assured herself. I know his reputation too well; he’s better than that.Sinskey had first met Robert Langdon four nights before in the gutted hull of aretasked C-130 transport plane, which served as the World Health Organization’smobile coordination center.It had been just past seven when the plane landed at Hanscom Field, less thanfifteen miles from Cambridge, Massachusetts. Sinskey was not sure what to expectfrom the celebrated academic whom she had contacted by phone, but she waspleasantly surprised when he strode confidently up the gangplank into the rearof the plane and greeted her with a carefree smile.“Dr. Sinskey, I presume?” Langdon firmly shook her hand.“Professor, it’s an honor to meet you.”“The honor’s mine. Thanks for all you do.”Langdon was a tall man, with urbane good looks and a deep voice. His clothing atthe moment, Sinskey had to assume, was his classroom attire—a tweed jacket,khaki slacks, and loafers—which made sense considering the man had essentiallybeen scooped off his campus with no warning. He also looked younger and far morefit than she’d imagined, which only served to remind Elizabeth of her own age. Icould almost be his mother.She gave him a tired smile. “Thank you for coming, Professor.”Langdon motioned to the humorless associate whom Sinskey had sent to collecthim. “Your friend here didn’t give me much chance to reconsider.”“Good. That’s what I pay him for.”“Nice amulet,” Langdon said, eyeing her necklace. “Lapis lazuli?”Sinskey nodded and glanced down at her blue stone amulet, fashioned into theiconic symbol of a snake wrapped around a vertical rod. “The modern symbol formedicine. As I’m sure you know, it’s called a caduceus.”Langdon glanced up suddenly, as if there was something he wanted to say.She waited. Yes?Apparently thinking better of his impulse, he gave a polite smile and changedthe subject. “So why am I here?”Elizabeth motioned to a makeshift conference area around a stainless-steeltable. “Please, sit. I have something I need you to look at.”Langdon ambled toward the table, and Elizabeth noted that while the professorseemed intrigued by the prospect of a secret meeting, he did not appear at allunsettled by it. Here is a man comfortable in his own skin. She wondered if hewould appear as relaxed once he found out why he had been brought here.Elizabeth got Langdon settled and then, with no preamble, she presented theobject she and her team had confiscated from a Florence safe-deposit box lessthan twelve hours earlier.Langdon studied the small carved cylinder for a long moment before giving her aquick synopsis of what she already knew. The object was an ancient cylinder sealthat could be used for printmaking. It bore a particularly gruesome image of athree-headed Satan along with a single word: saligia.“Saligia,” Langdon said, “is a Latin mnemonic for—”“The Seven Deadly Sins,” Elizabeth said. “Yes, we looked it up.”“Okay …” Langdon sounded puzzled. “Is there some reason you wanted me to look atthis?”“Actually, yes.” Sinskey took the cylinder back and began shaking it violently,the agitator ball rattling back and forth.Langdon looked puzzled by her action, but before he could ask what she wasdoing, the end of the cylinder began to glow, and she pointed it at a smoothpatch of insulation on the wall of the gutted plane.Langdon let out a low whistle and moved toward the projected image.“Botticelli’s Map of Hell,” Langdon announced. “Based on Dante’s Inferno.Although I’m guessing you probably already know that.”Elizabeth nodded. She and her team had used the Internet to identify thepainting, which Sinskey had been surprised to learn was a Botticelli, a painterbest known for his bright, idealized masterpieces Birth of Venus and Springtime.Sinskey loved both of those works despite the fact that they portrayed fertilityand the creation of life, which only served to remind her of her own tragicinability to conceive—the lone significant regret in her otherwise veryproductive life.“I was hoping,” Sinskey said, “that you could tell me about the symbolism hiddenin this painting.”Langdon looked irritated for the first time all night. “Is that why you calledme in? I thought you said it was an emergency.”“Humor me.”Langdon heaved a patient sigh. “Dr. Sinskey, generally speaking, if you want toknow about a specific painting, you should contact the museum that contains theoriginal. In this case, that would be the Vatican’s Biblioteca Apostolica. TheVatican has a number of superb iconographers who—”“The Vatican hates me.”Langdon gave her a startled look. “You, too? I thought I was the only one.”She smiled sadly. “The WHO feels strongly that the widespread availability ofcontraception is one of the keys to global health—both to combat sexuallytransmitted diseases like AIDS and also for general population control.”“And the Vatican feels differently.”“Quite. They have spent enormous amounts of energy and money indoctrinatingthird-world countries into a belief in the evils of contraception.”“Ah, yes,” Langdon said with a knowing smile. “Who better than a bunch ofcelibate male octogenarians to tell the world how to have sex?”Sinskey was liking the professor more and more every second.She shook the cylinder to recharge it and then projected the image on the wallagain. “Professor, take a closer look.”Langdon walked toward the image, studying it, still moving closer. Suddenly hestopped short. “That’s strange. It’s been altered.”That didn’t take him long. “Yes, it has, and I want you to tell me what thealterations mean.”Langdon fell silent, scanning the entire image, pausing to take in the tenletters that spelled catrovacer … and then the plague mask … and also thestrange quote around the border about “the eyes of death.”“Who did this?” Langdon demanded. “Where did it come from?”“Actually, the less you know right now the better. What I’m hoping is thatyou’ll be able to analyze these alterations and tell us what they mean.” Shemotioned to a desk in the corner.“Here? Right now?”She nodded. “I know it’s an imposition, but I can’t stress enough how importantthis is to us.” She paused. “It could well be a matter of life and death.”Langdon studied her with concern. “Deciphering this may take a while, but Isuppose if it’s that important to you—”“Thank you,” Sinskey interjected before he could change his mind. “Is thereanyone you need to call?”Langdon shook his head and told her he had been planning on a quiet weekendalone.Perfect. Sinskey got him settled at his desk with the projector, paper, pencil,and a laptop with a secure satellite connection. Langdon looked deeply puzzledabout why the WHO would be interested in a modified painting by Botticelli, buthe dutifully set to work.Dr. Sinskey imagined he might end up studying the image for hours with nobreakthrough, and so she settled in to get some work of her own done. From timeto time she could hear him shaking the projector and scribbling on his notepad.Barely ten minutes had passed when Langdon set down his pencil and announced,“Cerca trova.”Sinskey glanced over. “What?”“Cerca trova,” he repeated. “Seek and ye shall find. That’s what this codesays.”Sinskey hurried over and sat down close beside him, listening with fascinationas Langdon explained how the levels of Dante’s inferno had been scrambled, andthat, when they were replaced in their proper sequence, they spelled the Italianphrase cerca trova.Seek and find? Sinskey wondered. That’s this lunatic’s message to me? The phrasesounded like a direct challenge. The disturbing memory of the madman’s finalwords to her during their meeting at the Council on Foreign Relations replayedin her mind: Then it appears our dance has begun.“You just went white,” Langdon said, studying her thoughtfully. “I take it thisis not the message you were hoping for?”Sinskey gathered herself, straightening the amulet on her neck. “Not exactly.Tell me … do you believe this map of hell is suggesting I seek something?”“Yes. Cerca trova.”“And does it suggest where I seek?”Langdon stroked his chin as other WHO staff began gathering around, lookingeager for information. “Not overtly … no, although I’ve got a pretty good ideawhere you’ll want to start.”“Tell me,” Sinskey demanded, more forcefully than Langdon would have expected.“Well, how do you feel about Florence, Italy?”Sinskey set her jaw, doing her best not to react. Her staff members, however,were less controlled. All of them exchanged startled glances. One grabbed aphone and placed a call. Another hurried through a door toward the front of theplane.Langdon looked bewildered. “Was it something I said?”Absolutely, Sinskey thought. “What makes you say Florence?”“Cerca trova,” he replied, quickly recounting a long-standing mystery involvinga Vasari fresco at the Palazzo Vecchio.Florence it is, Sinskey thought, having heard enough. Obviously, it could not bemere coincidence that her nemesis had jumped to his death not more than threeblocks from the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence.“Professor,” she said, “when I showed you my amulet earlier and called it acaduceus, you paused, as if you wanted to say something, but then you hesitatedand seemed to change your mind. What were you going to say?”Langdon shook his head. “Nothing. It’s foolish. Sometimes the professor in mecan be a little overbearing.”Sinskey stared into his eyes. “I ask because I need to know I can trust you.What were you going to say?”Langdon swallowed and cleared his throat. “Not that it matters, but you saidyour amulet is the ancient symbol of medicine, which is correct. But when youcalled it a caduceus, you made a very common mistake. The caduceus has twosnakes on the staff and wings at the top. Your amulet has a single snake and nowings. Your symbol is called—”“The Rod of Asclepius.”Langdon cocked his head in surprise. “Yes. Exactly.”“I know. I was testing your truthfulness.”“I’m sorry?”“I was curious to know if you would tell me the truth, no matter howuncomfortable it might make me.”“Sounds like I failed.”“Don’t do it again. Total honesty is the only way you and I will be able to worktogether on this.”“Work together? Aren’t we done here?”“No, Professor, we’re not done. I need you to come to Florence to help me findsomething.”Langdon stared in disbelief. “Tonight?”“I’m afraid so. I have yet to tell you about the truly critical nature of thissituation.”Langdon shook his head. “It doesn’t matter what you tell me. I don’t want to flyto Florence.”“Neither do I,” she said grimly. “But unfortunately our time is running out.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 62THE NOON SUN glinted off the sleek roof of Italy’s high-velocity Frecciargentotrain as it raced northward, cutting a graceful arc across the Tuscancountryside. Despite traveling away from Florence at 174 miles per hour, the“silver arrow” train made almost no noise, its soft repetitive clicking andgently swaying motion having an almost soothing effect on those who rode it.For Robert Langdon, the last hour had been a blur.Now, aboard the high-speed train, Langdon, Sienna, and Dr. Ferris were seated inone of the Frecciargento’s private salottini—a small, executive-class berth withfour leather seats and a foldout table. Ferris had rented the entire cabin usinghis credit card, along with an assortment of sandwiches and mineral water, whichLangdon and Sienna had ravenously consumed after cleaning up in the restroomnext to their private berth.As the three of them settled in for the two-hour train ride to Venice, Dr.Ferris immediately turned his gaze to the Dante death mask, which sat on thetable between them in its Ziploc bag. “We need to figure out precisely where inVenice this mask is leading us.”“And quickly,” Sienna added, urgency in her voice. “It’s probably our only hopeof preventing Zobrist’s plague.”“Hold on,” Langdon said, placing a defensive hand atop the mask. “You promisedthat once we were safely aboard this train you would give me some answers aboutthe last few days. So far, all I know is that the WHO recruited me in Cambridgeto help decipher Zobrist’s version of La Mappa. Other than that, you’ve told menothing.”Dr. Ferris shifted uncomfortably and began scratching again at the rash on hisface and neck. “I can see you’re frustrated,” he said. “I’m sure it’s unsettlingnot to remember what happened, but medically speaking …” He glanced over atSienna for confirmation and then continued. “I strongly recommend you not expendenergy trying to recall specifics you can’t remember. With amnesia victims, it’sbest just to let the forgotten past remain forgotten.”“Let it be?!” Langdon felt his anger rising. “The hell with that! I need someanswers! Your organization brought me to Italy, where I was shot and lostseveral days of my life! I want to know how it happened!”“Robert,” Sienna intervened, speaking softly in a clear attempt to calm himdown. “Dr. Ferris is right. It definitely would not be healthy for you to beoverwhelmed by a deluge of information all at once. Think about the tinysnippets you do remember—the silver-haired woman, ‘seek and find,’ the writhingbodies from La Mappa—those images flooded into your mind in a series of jumbled,uncontrollable flashbacks that left you nearly incapacitated. If Dr. Ferrisstarts recounting the past few days, he will almost certainly dislodge othermemories, and your hallucinations could start all over again. Retrograde amnesiais a serious condition. Triggering misplaced memories can be extremelydisruptive to the psyche.”The thought had not occurred to Langdon.“You must feel quite disoriented,” Ferris added, “but at the moment we need yourpsyche intact so we can move forward. It’s imperative that we figure out whatthis mask is trying to tell us.”Sienna nodded.The doctors, Langdon noted silently, seemed to agree.Langdon sat quietly, trying to overcome his feelings of uncertainty. It was astrange sensation to meet a total stranger and realize you had actually knownhim for several days. Then again, Langdon thought, there is something vaguelyfamiliar about his eyes.“Professor,” Ferris said sympathetically, “I can see that you’re not sure youtrust me, and this is understandable considering all you’ve been through. One ofthe common side effects of amnesia is mild paranoia and distrust.”That makes sense, Langdon thought, considering I can’t even trust my own mind.“Speaking of paranoia,” Sienna joked, clearly trying to lighten the mood,“Robert saw your rash and thought you’d been stricken with the Black Plague.”Ferris’s puffy eyes widened, and he laughed out loud. “This rash? Believe me,Professor, if I had the plague, I would not be treating it with anover-the-counter antihistamine.” He pulled a small tube of medicine from hispocket and tossed it to Langdon. Sure enough, it was a half-empty tube ofanti-itch cream for allergic reactions.“Sorry about that,” Langdon said, feeling foolish. “Long day.”“No worries,” Ferris said.Langdon turned toward the window, watching the muted hues of the Italiancountryside blur together in a peaceful collage. The vineyards and farms werebecoming scarcer now as the flatlands gave way to the foothills of theApennines. Soon the train would navigate the sinuous mountain pass and thendescend again, powering eastward toward the Adriatic Sea.I’m headed for Venice, he thought. To look for a plague.This strange day had left Langdon feeling as if he were moving through alandscape composed of nothing but vague shapes with no particular details. Likea dream. Ironically, nightmares usually woke people up … but Langdon felt as ifhe had awoken into one.“Lira for your thoughts,” Sienna whispered beside him.Langdon glanced up, smiling wearily. “I keep thinking I’ll wake up at home anddiscover this was all a bad dream.”Sienna cocked her head, looking demure. “You wouldn’t miss me if you woke up andfound out I wasn’t real?”Langdon had to grin. “Yes, actually, I would miss you a little.”She patted his knee. “Stop daydreaming, Professor, and get to work.”Langdon reluctantly turned his eyes to the crinkled face of Dante Alighieri,which stared blankly up from the table before him. Gently, Langdon picked up theplaster mask and turned it over in his hands, gazing down into the concaveinterior at the first line of spiral text:O you possessed of sturdy intellect …Langdon doubted he qualified at the moment.Nonetheless, he set to work.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Two hundred miles ahead of the speeding train, The Mendacium remained anchoredin the Adriatic. Belowdecks, facilitator Laurence Knowlton heard the soft rap ofknuckles on his glass cubicle and touched a button beneath his desk, turning theopaque wall into a transparent one. Outside, a small, tanned form materialized.The provost.He looked grim.Without a word, he entered, locked the cubicle door, and threw the switch thatturned the glass room opaque again. He smelled of alcohol.“The video that Zobrist left us,” the provost said.“Yes, sir?”“I want to see it. Now.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 63ROBERT LANGDON HAD now finished transcribing the spiral text from the death maskonto paper so they could analyze it more closely. Sienna and Dr. Ferris huddledin close to help, and Langdon did his best to ignore Ferris’s ongoing scratchingand labored breathing.He’s fine, Langdon told himself, forcing his attention to the verse before him.O you possessed of sturdy intellect,observe the teaching that is hidden here …beneath the veil of verses so obscure.“As I mentioned earlier,” Langdon began, “the opening stanza of Zobrist’s poemis taken verbatim from Dante’s Inferno—an admonition to the reader that thewords carry a deeper meaning.”Dante’s allegorical work was so replete with veiled commentary on religion,politics, and philosophy that Langdon often suggested to his students that theItalian poet be studied much as one might study the Bible—reading between thelines in an effort to understand the deeper meaning.“Scholars of medieval allegory,” Langdon continued, “generally divide theiranalyses into two categories—‘text’ and ‘image’ … text being the literal contentof the work, and image being the symbolic message.”“Okay,” Ferris said eagerly. “So the fact that the poem begins with this line—”“Suggests,” Sienna interjected, “that our superficial reading may reveal onlypart of the story. The true meaning may be hidden.”“Something like that, yes.” Langdon returned his gaze to the text and continuedreading aloud.Seek the treacherous doge of Venicewho severed the heads from horses …and plucked up the bones of the blind.“Well,” Langdon said, “I’m not sure about headless horses and the bones of theblind, but it sounds like we’re supposed to locate a specific doge.”“I assume … a doge’s grave?” Sienna asked. “Or a statue or portrait?” Langdonreplied. “There haven’t been doges for centuries.”The doges of Venice were similar to the dukes of the other Italian city-states,and more than a hundred of them had ruled Venice over the course of a thousandyears, beginning in A.D. 697. Their lineage had ended in the late eighteenthcentury with Napoleon’s conquest, but their glory and power still remainsubjects of intense fascination for historians.“As you may know,” Langdon said, “Venice’s two most popular touristattractions—the Doge’s Palace and St. Mark’s Basilica—were built by the doges,for the doges. Many of them are buried right there.”“And do you know,” Sienna asked, eyeing the poem, “if there was a doge who wasconsidered to be particularly dangerous?”Langdon glanced down at the line in question. Seek the treacherous doge ofVenice. “None that I know of, but the poem doesn’t use the word ‘dangerous’; ituses the word ‘treacherous.’ There’s a difference, at least in the world ofDante. Treachery is one of the Seven Deadly Sins—the worst of them,actually—punished in the ninth and final ring of hell.”Treachery, as defined by Dante, was the act of betraying a loved one. History’smost notorious example of the sin had been Judas’s betrayal of his belovedJesus, an act Dante considered so vile that he had Judas banished to theinferno’s innermost core—a region named Judecca, after its most dishonorableresident.“Okay,” Ferris said, “so we’re looking for a doge who committed an act oftreachery.”Sienna nodded her agreement. “That will help us limit the list ofpossibilities.” She paused, eyeing the text. “But this next line … a doge who‘severed the heads from horses’?” She raised her eyes to Langdon. “Is there adoge who cut off horses’ heads?”The image Sienna evoked in his mind reminded Langdon of the gruesome scene fromThe Godfather. “Doesn’t ring a bell. But according to this, he also ‘plucked upthe bones of the blind.’ ” He glanced over at Ferris. “Your phone has Internet,right?”Ferris quickly pulled out his phone and held up his swollen, rashy fingertips.“The buttons might be difficult for me to manage.”“I’ve got it,” Sienna said, taking his phone. “I’ll run a search for Venetiandoges, cross-referenced with headless horses and the bones of the blind.” Shebegan typing rapidly on the tiny keyboard.Langdon skimmed the poem another time, and then continued reading aloud.Kneel within the gilded mouseion of holy wisdom,and place thine ear to the ground,listening for the sounds of trickling water.“I’ve never heard of a mouseion,” Ferris said.“It’s an ancient word meaning a temple protected by muses,” Langdon replied. “Inthe days of the early Greeks, a mouseion was a place where the enlightenedgathered to share ideas, and discuss literature, music, and art. The firstmouseion was built by Ptolemy at the Library of Alexandria centuries before thebirth of Christ, and then hundreds more cropped up around the world.”“Dr. Brooks,” Ferris said, glancing hopefully at Sienna. “Can you look and seeif there’s a mouseion in Venice?”“Actually there are dozens of them,” Langdon said with a playful smile. “Nowthey’re called museums.”“Ahhh …” Ferris replied. “I guess we’ll have to cast a wider net.” Sienna kepttyping into the phone, having no trouble multitasking as she calmly tookinventory. “Okay, so we’re looking for a museum where we can find a doge whosevered the heads from horses and plucked up the bones of the blind. Robert, isthere a particular museum that might be a good place to look?”Langdon was already considering all of Venice’s best-known museums—the Galleriedell’Accademia, the Ca’ Rezzonico, the Palazzo Grassi, the Peggy GuggenheimCollection, the Museo Correr—but none of them seemed to fit the description.He glanced back at the text.Kneel within the gilded mouseion of holy wisdom …Langdon smiled wryly. “Venice does have one museum that perfectly qualifies as a‘gilded mouseion of holy wisdom.’ ”Both Ferris and Sienna looked at him expectantly.“St. Mark’s Basilica,” he declared. “The largest church in Venice.”Ferris looked uncertain. “The church is a museum?”Langdon nodded. “Much like the Vatican Museum. And what’s more, the interior ofSt. Mark’s is famous for being adorned, in its entirety, in solid gold tiles.”“A gilded mouseion,” Sienna said, sounding genuinely excited.Langdon nodded, having no doubt that St. Mark’s was the gilded temple referencedin the poem. For centuries, the Venetians had called St. Mark’s La Chiesad’Oro—the Church of Gold—and Langdon considered its interior the most dazzlingof any church in the world.“The poem says to ‘kneel’ there,” Ferris added. “And a church is a logical placeto kneel.”Sienna was typing furiously again. “I’ll add St. Mark’s to the search. That mustbe where we need to look for the doge.”Langdon knew they would find no shortage of doges in St. Mark’s—which was, quiteliterally, the basilica of the doges. He felt encouraged as he returned his eyesto the poem.Kneel within the gilded mouseion of holy wisdom,and place thine ear to the ground,listening for the sounds of trickling water.Trickling water? Langdon wondered. Is there water under St. Mark’s? Thequestion, he realized, was foolish. There was water under the entire city. Everybuilding in Venice was slowly sinking and leaking. Langdon pictured the basilicaand tried to imagine where inside one might kneel to listen for trickling water.And once we hear it … what do we do?Langdon returned to the poem and finished reading aloud.Follow deep into the sunken palace …for here, in the darkness, the chthonic monster waits,submerged in the bloodred waters …of the lagoon that reflects no stars.“Okay,” Langdon said, disturbed by the image, “apparently, we follow the soundsof trickling water … to some kind of sunken palace.”Ferris scratched at his face, looking unnerved. “What’s a chthonic monster?”“Subterranean,” Sienna offered, her fingers still working the phone. “‘Chthonic’ means ‘beneath the earth.’ ”“Partly, yes,” Langdon said. “Although the word has a further historicimplication—one commonly associated with myths and monsters. Chthonics are anentire category of mythical gods and monsters—Erinyes, Hecate, and Medusa, forexample. They’re called chthonics because they reside in the underworld and areassociated with hell.” Langdon paused. “Historically, they emerge from the earthand come aboveground to wreak havoc in the human world.”There was a long silence, and Langdon sensed they were all thinking the samething. This chthonic monster … could only be Zobrist’s plague.for here, in the darkness, the chthonic monster waits,submerged in the bloodred waters …of the lagoon that reflects no stars.“Anyway,” Langdon said, trying to stay on track, “we’re obviously looking for anunderground location, which at least explains the last line of the poemreferencing ‘the lagoon that reflects no stars.’ ”“Good point,” Sienna said, glancing up now from Ferris’s phone. “If a lagoon issubterranean, it couldn’t reflect the sky. But does Venice have subterraneanlagoons?”“None that I know of,” Langdon replied. “But in a city built on water, there areprobably endless possibilities.”“What if the lagoon is indoors?” Sienna asked suddenly, eyeing them both. “Thepoem refers to ‘the darkness’ of ‘the sunken palace.’ You mentioned earlier thatthe Doge’s Palace is connected to the basilica, right? That means thosestructures have a lot of what the poem mentions—a mouseion of holy wisdom, apalace, relevance to doges—and it’s all located right there on Venice’s mainlagoon, at sea level.”Langdon considered this. “You think the poem’s ‘sunken palace’ is the Doge’sPalace?”“Why not? The poem tells us first to kneel at St. Mark’s Basilica, then tofollow the sounds of trickling water. Maybe the sounds of water lead next doorto the Doge’s Palace. It could have a submerged foundation or something.”Langdon had visited the Doge’s Palace many times and knew that it was absolutelymassive. A sprawling complex of buildings, the palace housed a grand-scalemuseum, a veritable labyrinth of institutional chambers, apartments, andcourtyards, and a prison network so vast that it was housed in multiplebuildings.“You may be right,” Langdon said, “but a blind search of that palace would takedays. I suggest we do exactly as the poem tells us. First, we go to St. Mark’sBasilica and find the tomb or statue of this treacherous doge, and then we kneeldown.”“And then?” Sienna asked.“And then,” Langdon said with a sigh, “we pray like hell that we hear tricklingwater … and it leads us somewhere.”In the silence that followed, Langdon pictured the anxious face of ElizabethSinskey as he had seen it in his hallucinations, calling to him across thewater. Time is short. Seek and find! He wondered where Sinskey was now … and ifshe was all right. The soldiers in black had no doubt realized by now thatLangdon and Sienna had escaped. How long until they come after us?As Langdon returned his eyes to the poem, he fought off a wave of exhaustion. Heeyed the final line of verse, and another thought occurred to him. He wonderedif it was even worth mentioning. The lagoon that reflects no stars. It wasprobably irrelevant to their search, but he decided to share it nonetheless.“There’s another point I should mention.”Sienna glanced up from the cell phone.“The three sections of Dante’s Divine Comedy,” Langdon said. “Inferno,Purgatorio, and Paradiso. They all end with the exact same word.”Sienna looked surprised.“What word is that?” Ferris asked.Langdon pointed to the bottom of the text he had transcribed. “The same wordthat ends this poem—‘stars.’ ” He picked up Dante’s death mask and pointed tothe very center of the spiral text.The lagoon that reflects no stars.“What’s more,” Langdon continued, “in the finale of the Inferno, we find Dantelistening to the sound of trickling water inside a chasm and following itthrough an opening … which leads him out of hell.”Ferris blanched slightly. “Jesus.”Just then, a deafening rush of air filled the cabin as the Frecciargento plungedinto a mountain tunnel.In the darkness, Langdon closed his eyes and tried to allow his mind to relax.Zobrist may have been a lunatic, he thought, but he certainly had asophisticated grasp of Dante."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 64LAURENCE KNOWLTON FELT a wave of relief wash over him.The provost changed his mind about watching Zobrist’s video.Knowlton practically dove for the crimson memory stick and inserted it into hiscomputer so he could share it with his boss. The weight of Zobrist’s bizarrenine-minute message had been haunting the facilitator, and he was eager to haveanother set of eyes watch it.This will no longer be on me.Knowlton held his breath as he began the playback.The screen darkened, and the sounds of gently lapping water filled the cubicle.The camera moved through the reddish haze of the underground cavern, andalthough the provost showed no visible reaction, Knowlton sensed that the manwas as alarmed as he was bewildered.The camera paused its forward motion and tipped downward at the surface of thelagoon, where it plunged beneath the water, diving several feet to reveal thepolished titanium plaque bolted to the floor.IN THIS PLACE, ON THIS DATE,THE WORLD WAS CHANGED FOREVER.The provost flinched ever so slightly. “Tomorrow,” he whispered, eyeing thedate. “And do we know where ‘this place’ might be?”Knowlton shook his head.The camera panned left now, revealing the submerged plastic sack of gelatinous,yellow-brown fluid.“What in God’s name?!” The provost pulled up a chair and settled in, staring atthe undulating bubble, suspended like a tethered balloon beneath the water.An uncomfortable silence settled over the room as the video progressed. Soon thescreen went dark, and then a strange, beak-nosed shadow appeared on the cavernwall and began talking in its arcane language.I am the Shade …Driven underground, I must speak to the world from deep within the earth, exiledto this gloomy cavern where the bloodred waters collect in the lagoon thatreflects no stars.But this is my paradise … the perfect womb for my fragile child.Inferno.The provost glanced up. “Inferno?”Knowlton shrugged. “As I said, it’s disturbing.”The provost returned his eyes to the screen, watching intently.The beak-nosed shadow continued speaking for several minutes, talking ofplagues, of the population’s need for purging, of his own glorious role in thefuture, of his battle against the ignorant souls who had been trying to stophim, and of the faithful few who realized that drastic action was the only wayto save the planet.Whatever this war was about, Knowlton had been wondering all morning if theConsortium might be fighting on the wrong side.The voice continued.I have forged a masterpiece of salvation, and yet my efforts have been rewardednot with trumpets and laurels … but with threats of death.I do not fear death … for death transforms visionaries into martyrs … convertsnoble ideas into powerful movements.Jesus. Socrates. Martin Luther King.One day soon I will join them.The masterpiece I have created is the work of God Himself … a gift from the Onewho imbued me with the intellect, tools, and courage required to forge such acreation.Now the day grows near.Inferno sleeps beneath me, preparing to spring from its watery womb … under thewatchful eye of the chthonic monster and all her Furies.Despite the virtue of my deeds, like you, I am no stranger to Sin. Even I amguilty of the darkest of the seven—that lone temptation from which so few findsanctuary.Pride.By recording this very message I have succumbed to Pride’s goading pull … eagerto ensure that the world would know my work.And why not?Mankind should know the source of his own salvation … the name of he who sealedthe yawning gates of hell forever!With each passing hour, the outcome grows more certain. Mathematics—asrelentless as the law of gravity—is nonnegotiable. The same exponentialblossoming of life that has nearly killed Mankind shall also be his deliverance.The beauty of a living organism—be it good or evil—is that it will follow thelaw of God with singular vision.Be fruitful and multiply.And so I fight fire … with fire.“That’s enough,” the provost interrupted so quietly that Knowlton barely heardhim.“Sir?”“Stop the video.”Knowlton paused the playback. “Sir, the end is actually the most frighteningpart.”“I’ve seen enough.” The provost looked ill. He paced the cubicle for severalmoments and then turned suddenly. “We need to make contact with FS-2080.”Knowlton considered the move.FS-2080 was the code name of one of the provost’s trusted contacts—the samecontact who had referred Zobrist to the Consortium as a client. The provost wasno doubt at this very moment chiding himself for trusting FS-2080’s judgment;the recommendation of Bertrand Zobrist as a client had brought chaos into theConsortium’s delicately structured world.FS-2080 is the reason for this crisis.The growing chain of calamities surrounding Zobrist only seemed to be gettingworse, not merely for the Consortium, but quite possibly … for the world.“We need to discover Zobrist’s true intentions,” the provost declared. “I wantto know exactly what he created, and if this threat is real.”Knowlton knew that if anyone had the answers to these questions, it would beFS-2080. Nobody knew Bertrand Zobrist better. It was time for the Consortium tobreak protocol and assess what kind of insanity the organization might haveunwittingly supported over the past year.Knowlton considered the possible ramifications of confronting FS-2080 directly.The mere act of initiating contact carried certain risks.“Obviously, sir,” Knowlton said, “if you reach out to FS-2080, you’ll need to doso very delicately.”The provost’s eyes flashed with anger as he pulled out his cell phone. “We’rewell past delicate.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Seated with his two traveling partners in the Frecciargento’s private cabin, theman with the paisley necktie and Plume Paris glasses did his best not to scratchat his still-worsening rash. The pain in his chest seemed to have increased aswell.As the train finally emerged from the tunnel, the man gazed over at Langdon, whoopened his eyes slowly, apparently returning from far-off thoughts. Beside him,Sienna began eyeing the man’s cell phone, which she had set down as the trainsped through the tunnel, while there was no signal.Sienna appeared eager to continue her Internet search, but before she couldreach for the phone, it suddenly began vibrating, emitting a series of staccatopings.Knowing the ring well, the man with the rash immediately grabbed the phone andeyed the illuminated screen, doing his best to hide his surprise.“Sorry,” he said, standing up. “Ailing mother. I’ve got to take this.”Sienna and Langdon gave him understanding nods as the man excused himself andexited the cabin, moving quickly down the passageway into a nearby restroom.The man with the rash locked the restroom door as he took the call. “Hello?”The voice on the line was grave. “It’s the provost.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 65THE FRECCIARGENTO’S RESTROOM was no larger than the restroom on a commercialairliner, with barely enough room to turn around. The man with the skin rashfinished his phone call with the provost and pocketed his phone.The ground has shifted, he realized. The entire landscape was suddenly upsidedown, and he needed a moment to get his bearings.My friends are now my enemies.The man loosened his paisley tie and stared at his pustuled face in the mirror.He looked worse than he thought. His face was of little concern, though,compared to the pain in his chest.Hesitantly, he unfastened several buttons and pulled open his shirt.He forced his eyes to the mirror … and studied his bare chest.Jesus.The black area was growing.The skin on the center of his chest was a deep hue of bluish black. The area hadbegun last night as the size of a golf ball, but now it was the size of anorange. He gently touched the tender flesh and winced.Hurriedly, he rebuttoned his shirt, hoping he would have the strength to carryout what he needed to do.The next hour will be critical, he thought. A delicate series of maneuvers.He closed his eyes and gathered himself, working through what needed to happen.My friends have become my enemies, he thought again.He took several deep, painful breaths, hoping it might calm his nerves. He knewhe needed to stay serene if he was going to keep his intentions hidden.Inner calm is critical to persuasive acting.The man was no stranger to deception, and yet his heart was pounding wildly now.He took another deep, throbbing breath. You’ve been deceiving people for years,he reminded himself. It’s what you do.Steeling himself, he prepared to return to Langdon and Sienna.My final performance, he thought.As a final precaution before exiting the restroom, he removed the battery fromhis cell phone, making sure the device was now inoperative.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]He looks pale, Sienna thought as the man with the rash reentered the cabin andsettled into his seat with a pained sigh.“Is everything okay?” Sienna asked, genuinely concerned.He nodded. “Thanks, yes. Everything’s fine.”Apparently having received all the information the man intended to share, Siennachanged tacks. “I need your phone again,” she said. “If you don’t mind, I wantto keep searching for more on the doge. Maybe we can get some answers before wevisit St. Mark’s.”“No problem,” he said, taking his phone from his pocket and checking thedisplay. “Oh, damn. My battery was dying during that call. Looks like it’s deadnow.” He glanced at his watch. “We’ll be in Venice soon. We’ll just have towait.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Five miles off the coast of Italy, aboard The Mendacium, facilitator Knowltonwatched in silence as the provost stalked around the perimeter of the cubiclelike a caged animal. Following the phone call, the provost’s wheels were clearlyturning, and Knowlton knew better than to utter a sound while the provost wasthinking.Finally, the deeply tanned man spoke, his voice as tight as Knowlton couldremember. “We have no choice. We need to share this video with Dr. ElizabethSinskey.”Knowlton sat stock-still, not wanting to show his surprise. The silver-haireddevil? The one we’ve helped Zobrist evade all year? “Okay, sir. Should I find away to e-mail the video to her?”“God, no! And risk leaking the video to the public? It would be mass hysteria. Iwant Dr. Sinskey aboard this ship as soon as you can get her here.”Knowlton stared in disbelief. He wants to bring the director of the WHO on boardThe Mendacium? “Sir, this breach of our secrecy protocol obviously risks—”“Just do it, Knowlton! NOW!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 66FS-2080 GAZED OUT the window of the speeding Frecciargento, watching RobertLangdon’s reflection in the glass. The professor was still brainstormingpossible solutions to the death-mask riddle that Bertrand Zobrist had composed.Bertrand, thought FS-2080. God, I miss him.The pangs of loss felt fresh. The night the two had met still felt like amagical dream.Chicago. The blizzard.January, six years ago … but it still feels like yesterday. I am trudgingthrough snowbanks along the windswept Magnificent Mile, collar upturned againstthe blinding whiteout. Despite the cold, I tell myself that nothing will keep mefrom my destination. Tonight is my chance to hear the great Bertrand Zobristspeak … in person.I have read everything the man has ever written, and I know I am lucky to haveone of the five hundred tickets that were printed for the event.When I arrive at the hall, half numb from the wind, I feel a surge of panic todiscover the room nearly empty. Has the speech been canceled?! The city is innear shutdown due to the weather … has it kept Zobrist from coming tonight?!Then he is there.A towering, elegant form takes the stage.He is tall … so very tall … with vibrant green eyes that seem to hold all themysteries of the world in their depths. He looks out over the empty hall—only adozen or so stalwart fans—and I feel ashamed that the hall is nearly empty.This is Bertrand Zobrist!There is a terrible moment of silence as he stares at us, his face stern. Then,without warning, he bursts out laughing, his green eyes glimmering. “To hellwith this empty auditorium,” he declares. “My hotel is next door. Let’s go tothe bar!”A cheer goes up, and a small group migrates next door to a hotel bar, where wecrowd into a big booth and order drinks. Zobrist regales us with tales of hisresearch, his rise to celebrity, and his thoughts about the future of geneticengineering. As the drinks flow, the topic turns to Zobrist’s newfound passionfor Transhumanist philosophy.“I believe Transhumanism is mankind’s only hope for long-term survival,” Zobristpreaches, pulling aside his shirt and showing them all the “H+” tattoo inscribedon his shoulder. “As you can see, I’m fully committed.”I feel as if I’m having a private audience with a rock star. I never imaginedthe lauded “genius of genetics” would be so charismatic or beguiling in person.Every time Zobrist glances over at me, his green eyes ignite a wholly unexpectedfeeling inside me … the deep pull of sexual attraction.As the night wears on, the group slowly thins as the guests excuse themselves toget back to reality. By midnight, I am seated all alone with Bertrand Zobrist.“Thank you for tonight,” I say to him, a little tipsy from one drink too many.“You’re an amazing teacher.”“Flattery?” Zobrist smiles and leans closer, our legs touching now. “It will getyou everywhere.”The flirtation is clearly inappropriate, but it is a snowy night in a desertedChicago hotel, and it feels as if the entire world has stopped.“So what do you think?” Zobrist says. “Nightcap in my room?”I freeze, knowing I must look like a deer in the headlights.Zobrist’s eyes twinkle warmly. “Let me guess,” he whispers. “You’ve never beenwith a famous man.”I feel myself flush, fighting to hide a surge of emotions—embarrassment,excitement, fear. “Actually, to be honest,” I say to him, “I’ve never been withany man.”Zobrist smiles and inches closer. “I’m not sure what you’ve been waiting for,but please let me be your first.”In that moment all the awkward sexual fears and frustrations of my childhooddisappear … evaporating into the snowy night.For the first time ever, I feel a yearning unfettered by shame.I want him.Ten minutes later, we are in Zobrist’s hotel room, naked in each other’s arms.Zobrist takes his time, his patient hands coaxing sensations I’ve never feltbefore out of my inexperienced body.This is my choice. He didn’t force me.In the cocoon of Zobrist’s embrace, I feel as if everything is right in theworld. Lying there, staring out the window at the snowy night, I know I willfollow this man anywhere.The Frecciargento train slowed suddenly, and FS-2080 emerged from the blissfulmemory and back into the depressing present.Bertrand … you’re gone.Their first night together had been the first step of an incredible journey.I became more than his lover. I became his disciple.“Libertà Bridge,” Langdon said. “We’re almost there.”FS-2080 nodded mournfully, staring out at the waters of the Laguna Veneta,remembering sailing here once with Bertrand … a peaceful image that dissolvednow into a horrific memory from a week before.I was there when he jumped off the Badia tower.Mine were the last eyes he ever saw."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 67THE NETJETS CITATION Excel bounced through heavy turbulence as it rocketedskyward out of Tassignano Airport and banked toward Venice. On board, Dr.Elizabeth Sinskey barely noticed the bumpy departure as she absently stroked heramulet and gazed out the window into empty space.They had finally stopped giving her the injections, and Sinskey’s mind wasalready feeling clearer. In the seat beside her, Agent Brüder remained silent,probably pondering the bizarre turn of events that had just transpired.Everything is upside down, Sinskey thought, still struggling to believe what shehad just witnessed.Thirty minutes ago, they had stormed the tiny airfield to intercept Langdon ashe boarded the private jet he had summoned. Instead of finding the professor,however, they discovered an idling Citation Excel and two NetJets pilots pacingthe tarmac and checking their watches.Robert Langdon was a no-show.Then came the phone call.When the cell phone rang, Sinskey was where she had been all day—in the backseatof the black van. Agent Brüder entered the vehicle with a stupefied look on hisface as he handed her his phone.“Urgent call for you, ma’am.”“Who is it?” she asked.“He asked me to tell you only that he has pressing information to give you aboutBertrand Zobrist.”Sinskey grabbed the phone. “This is Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey.”“Dr. Sinskey, you and I have never met, but my organization has been responsiblefor hiding Bertrand Zobrist from you for the last year.”Sinskey sat bolt upright. “Whoever the hell you are, you’ve been harboring acriminal!”“We’ve done nothing illegal, but that’s not—”“The hell you haven’t!”The man on the line took a long, patient breath, speaking very softly now. “Youand I will have plenty of time to debate the ethics of my actions. I know youdon’t know me, but I do know quite a bit about you. Mr. Zobrist has been payingme handsomely to keep you and others away from him for the past year. I am nowbreaching my own strict protocol by contacting you. And yet, I believe we haveno choice but to pool our resources. Bertrand Zobrist, I fear, may have donesomething terrible.”Sinskey could not fathom who this man was. “You’re just figuring this out now?!”“Yes, that is correct. Just now.” His tone was earnest.Sinskey tried to shake off the cobwebs. “Who are you?”“Someone who wants to help you before it’s too late. I’m in possession of avideo message created by Bertrand Zobrist. He asked me to release it to theworld … tomorrow. I think you need to see it immediately.”“What does it say?”“Not on the phone. We need to meet.”“How do I know I can trust you?”“Because I’m about to tell you where Robert Langdon is … and why he’s acting sostrangely.”Sinskey reeled at the mention of Langdon’s name, and she listened inastonishment to the outlandish explanation. This man seemed to have beencomplicit with her enemy for the last year, and yet, as she listened to thedetails, Sinskey’s gut told her she needed to trust what he was saying.I have no choice but to comply.Their combined resources made short work of commandeering the “jilted” NetJetsCitation Excel. Sinskey and the soldiers were now in pursuit, racing towardVenice, where, according to this man’s information, Langdon and his twotraveling companions were at this very moment arriving by train. It was too lateto summon the local authorities, but the man on the line claimed to know whereLangdon was headed.St. Mark’s Square? Sinskey felt a chill as she imagined the crowds in Venice’smost populated area. “How do you know this?”“Not on the phone,” the man said. “But you should be aware that Robert Langdonis unwittingly traveling with a very dangerous individual.”“Who?!” Sinskey demanded.“One of Zobrist’s closest confidants.” The man sighed heavily. “Someone Itrusted. Foolishly, apparently. Someone I believe may now be a severe threat.”As the private jet headed for Venice’s Marco Polo Airport carrying Sinskey andthe six soldiers, Sinskey’s thoughts returned to Robert Langdon. He lost hismemory? He recalls nothing? The strange news, while explaining several things,made Sinskey feel even worse than she already did about involving thedistinguished academic in this crisis.I left him no choice.Almost two days ago, when Sinskey recruited Langdon, she hadn’t even let him goback to his house for his passport. Instead, she had arranged for his quietpassage through the Florence Airport as a special liaison to the World HealthOrganization.As the C-130 lumbered into the air and pointed east across the Atlantic, Sinskeyhad glanced at Langdon beside her and noticed he did not look well. He wasstaring intently at the sidewall of the windowless hull.“Professor, you do realize this plane has no windows? Until recently, it wasused as a military transport.”Langdon turned, his face ashen. “Yes, I noticed that the moment I steppedaboard. I’m not so good in enclosed spaces.”“So you’re pretending to look out an imaginary window?”He gave a sheepish smile. “Something like that, yes.”“Well, look at this instead.” She pulled out a photo of her lanky, green-eyednemesis and laid it in front of him. “This is Bertrand Zobrist.”Sinskey had already told Langdon about her confrontation with Zobrist at theCouncil on Foreign Relations, the man’s passion for the Population ApocalypseEquation, his widely circulated comments about the global benefits of the BlackPlague, and, most ominously, his total disappearance from sight over the pastyear.“How does someone that prominent stay hidden for so long?” Langdon asked.“He had a lot of help. Professional help. Maybe even a foreign government.”“What government would condone the creation of a plague?”“The same governments that try to obtain nuclear warheads on the black market.Don’t forget that an effective plague is the ultimate biochemical weapon, andit’s worth a fortune. Zobrist easily could have lied to his partners and assuredthem his creation had a limited range. Zobrist would be the only one who had anyidea what his creation actually did.”Langdon fell silent.“In any case,” Sinskey continued, “if not for power or money, those helpingZobrist could have helped because they shared his ideology. Zobrist has noshortage of disciples who would do anything for him. He was quite a celebrity.In fact, he gave a speech at your university not long ago.”“At Harvard?”Sinskey took out a pen and wrote on the border of Zobrist’s photo—the letter Hfollowed by a plus sign. “You’re good with symbols,” she said. “Do you recognizethis one?”H+“H-plus,” Langdon whispered, nodding vaguely. “Sure, a few summers ago it wasposted all over campus. I assumed it was some kind of chemistry conference.”Sinskey chuckled. “No, those were signs for the 2010 ‘Humanity-plus’ Summit—oneof the largest Transhumanism gatherings ever. H-plus is the symbol of theTranshumanist movement.”Langdon cocked his head, as if trying to place the term.“Transhumanism,” Sinskey said, “is an intellectual movement, a philosophy ofsorts, and it’s quickly taking root in the scientific community. It essentiallystates that humans should use technology to transcend the weaknesses inherent inour human bodies. In other words, the next step in human evolution should bethat we begin biologically engineering ourselves.”“Sounds ominous,” Langdon said.“Like all change, it’s just a matter of degree. Technically, we’ve beenengineering ourselves for years now—developing vaccines that make childrenimmune to certain diseases … polio, smallpox, typhoid. The difference is thatnow, with Zobrist’s breakthroughs in germ-line genetic engineering, we’relearning how to create inheritable immunizations, those that would affect therecipient at the core germ-line level—making all subsequent generations immuneto that disease.”Langdon looked startled. “So the human species would essentially undergo anevolution that makes it immune to typhoid, for example?”“It’s more of an assisted evolution,” Sinskey corrected. “Normally, theevolutionary process—whether it be a lungfish developing feet or an apedeveloping opposable thumbs—takes millennia to occur. Now we can make radicalgenetic adaptations in a single generation. Proponents of the technologyconsider it the ultimate expression of Darwinian ‘survival of thefittest’—humans becoming a species that learns to improve its own evolutionaryprocess.”“Sounds more like playing God,” Langdon replied.“I agree wholeheartedly,” Sinskey said. “Zobrist, however, like many otherTranshumanists, argued strongly that it is mankind’s evolutionary obligation touse all the powers at our disposal—germ-line genetic mutation, for one—toimprove as a species. The problem is that our genetic makeup is like a house ofcards—each piece connected to and supported by countless others—often in ways wedon’t understand. If we try to remove a single human trait, we can causehundreds of others to shift simultaneously, possibly with catastrophic effects.”Langdon nodded. “There’s a reason evolution is a gradual process.”“Precisely!” Sinskey said, feeling her admiration for the professor growing witheach passing moment. “We’re tinkering with a process that took aeons to build.These are dangerous times. We now literally have the capacity to activatecertain gene sequences that will result in our descendants having increaseddexterity, stamina, strength, even intelligence—essentially a super-race. Thesehypothetical ‘enhanced’ individuals are what Transhumanists refer to asposthumans, which some believe will be the future of our species.”“Sounds eerily like eugenics,” Langdon replied.The reference made Sinskey’s skin crawl.In the 1940s, Nazi scientists had dabbled in a technology they’d dubbedeugenics—an attempt to use rudimentary genetic engineering to increase the birthrate of those with certain “desirable” genetic traits, while decreasing thebirth rate of those with “less desirable” ethnic traits.Ethnic cleansing at the genetic level.“There are similarities,” Sinskey admitted, “and while it’s hard to fathom howone would engineer a new human race, there are a lot of smart people who believeit is critical to our survival that we begin that very process. One of thecontributors to the Transhumanist magazine H+ described germ-line geneticengineering as ‘the clear next step,’ and claimed it ‘epitomized the truepotential of our species.’ ” Sinskey paused. “Then again, in the magazine’sdefense, they also ran a Discover magazine piece called ‘The Most Dangerous Ideain the World.’ ”“I think I’d side with the latter,” Langdon said. “At least from thesociocultural standpoint.”“How so?”“Well, I assume that genetic enhancements—much like cosmetic surgery—cost a lotof money, right?”“Of course. Not everyone could afford to improve themselves or their children.”“Which means that legalized genetic enhancements would immediately create aworld of haves and have-nots. We already have a growing chasm between the richand the poor, but genetic engineering would create a race of superhumans and …perceived subhumans. You think people are concerned about the ultrarich onepercent running the world? Just imagine if that one percent were also, quiteliterally, a superior species—smarter, stronger, healthier. It’s the kind ofsituation that would be ripe for slavery or ethnic cleansing.”Sinskey smiled at the handsome academic beside her. “Professor, you have veryquickly grasped what I believe to be the most serious pitfall of geneticengineering.”“Well, I may have grasped that, but I’m still confused about Zobrist. All ofthis Transhumanist thinking seems to be about bettering humankind, making usmore healthy, curing fatal diseases, extending our longevity. And yet Zobrist’sviews on overpopulation seem to endorse killing off people. His ideas onTranshumanism and overpopulation seem to be in conflict, don’t they?”Sinskey gave a solemn sigh. It was a good question, and unfortunately it had aclear and troubling answer. “Zobrist believed wholeheartedly in Transhumanism—inbettering the species through technology; however, he also believed our specieswould go extinct before we got a chance to do that. In effect, if nobody takesaction, our sheer numbers will kill off the species before we get a chance torealize the promise of genetic engineering.”Langdon’s eyes went wide. “So Zobrist wanted to thin the herd … in order to buymore time?”Sinskey nodded. “He once described himself as being trapped on a ship where thepassengers double in number every hour, while he is desperately trying to builda lifeboat before the ship sinks under its own weight.” She paused. “Headvocated throwing half the people overboard.”Langdon winced. “Frightening thought.”“Quite. Make no mistake about it,” she said. “Zobrist firmly believed that adrastic curbing of the human population will be remembered one day as theultimate act of heroism … the moment the human race chose to survive.”“As I said, frightening.”“More so because Zobrist was not alone in his thinking. When Zobrist died, hebecame a martyr for a lot of people. I have no idea who we’re going to run intowhen we arrive in Florence, but we’ll need to be very careful. We won’t be theonly ones trying to find this plague, and for your own safety, we can’t let asoul know you’re in Italy looking for it.”Langdon told her about his friend Ignazio Busoni, a Dante specialist, whoLangdon believed could get him into Palazzo Vecchio for a quiet after-hours lookat the painting that contained the words cerca trova, from Zobrist’s littleprojector. Busoni might also be able to help Langdon understand the strangequote about the eyes of death.Sinskey pulled back her long silver hair and looked intently at Langdon. “Seekand find, Professor. Time is running out.”Sinskey went to an onboard storeroom and retrieved the WHO’s most secure hazmattube—a model with biometric sealing capability.“Give me your thumb,” she said, setting the canister in front of Langdon.Langdon looked puzzled but obliged.Sinskey programmed the tube so that Langdon would be the only person who couldopen it. Then she took the little projector and placed it safely inside.“Think of it as a portable lockbox,” she said with a smile.“With a biohazard symbol?” Langdon looked uneasy.“It’s all we have. On the bright side, nobody will mess with it.” Langdonexcused himself to stretch his legs and use the restroom. While he was gone,Sinskey tried to slip the sealed canister into his jacket pocket. Unfortunatelyit didn’t fit.He can’t be carrying this projector around in plain sight. She thought a momentand then headed back to the storeroom for a scalpel and a stitch kit. Withexpert precision, she cut a slit in the lining of Langdon’s jacket and carefullysewed a hidden pocket that was the exact size required to conceal the biotube.When Langdon returned, she was just finishing the final stitches.The professor stopped and stared as if she had defaced the Mona Lisa. “Yousliced into the lining of my Harris Tweed?”“Relax, Professor,” she said. “I’m a trained surgeon. The stitches are quiteprofessional.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 68VENICE’S SANTA LUCIA Train Station is an elegant, low-slung structure made ofgray stone and concrete. It was designed in a modern, minimalist style, with afacade that is gracefully devoid of all signage except for one symbol—the wingedletters FS—the icon of the state railway system, the Ferrovie dello Stato.Because the station is located at the westernmost end of the Grand Canal,passengers arriving in Venice need take only a single step out of the station tofind themselves fully immersed in the distinctive sights, smells, and sounds ofVenice.For Langdon, it was always the salty air that struck him first—a clean oceanbreeze spiced by the aroma of the white pizza sold by the street vendors outsidethe station. Today, the wind was from the east, and the air also carried thetang of diesel fuel from the long line of water taxis idling nearby on theturgid waters of the Grand Canal. Dozens of boat captains waved their arms andshouted to tourists, hoping to lure a new fare onto their taxis, gondolas,vaporetti, and private speedboats.Chaos on the water, Langdon mused, eyeing the floating traffic jam. Somehow, thecongestion that would be maddening in Boston felt quaint in Venice.A stone’s throw across the canal, the iconic verdigris cupola of San SimeonePiccolo rose into the afternoon sky. The church was one of the mostarchitecturally eclectic in all of Europe. Its unusually steep dome and circularsanctuary were Byzantine in style, while its columned marble pronaos was clearlymodeled on the classical Greek entryway to Rome’s Pantheon. The main entrancewas topped by a spectacular pediment of intricate marble relief portraying ahost of martyred saints.Venice is an outdoor museum, Langdon thought, his gaze dropping to the canalwater that lapped at the church’s stairs. A slowly sinking museum. Even so, thepotential of flooding seemed inconsequential compared to the threat that Langdonfeared was now lurking beneath the city.And nobody has any idea …The poem on the back of Dante’s death mask still played in Langdon’s mind, andhe wondered where the verses would lead them. He had the transcription of thepoem in his pocket, but the plaster mask itself—at Sienna’s suggestion—Langdonhad wrapped in newspaper and discreetly sealed inside a self-serve locker in thetrain station. Although an egregiously inadequate resting place for such aprecious artifact, the locker was certainly far safer than carrying thepriceless plaster mask around a water-filled city.“Robert?” Sienna was up ahead with Ferris, motioning toward the water taxis. “Wedon’t have much time.”Langdon hurried toward them, although as an architecture enthusiast, he found italmost unthinkable to rush a trip along the Grand Canal. Few Venetianexperiences were more pleasurable than boarding vaporetto no. 1—the city’sprimary open-air water bus—preferably at night, and sitting up front in the openair as the floodlit cathedrals and palaces drifted past.No vaporetto today, Langdon thought. The vaporetti water buses were notoriouslyslow, and water taxi would be a faster option. Unfortunately, the taxi queueoutside the train station looked interminable at the moment.Ferris, in no apparent mood to wait, quickly took matters into his own hands.With a generous stack of bills, he quickly summoned over a water limousine—ahighly polished Veneziano Convertible made of South African mahogany. While theelegant craft was certainly overkill, the journey would be both private andswift—a mere fifteen minutes along the Grand Canal to St. Mark’s Square.Their driver was a strikingly handsome man in a tailored Armani suit. He lookedmore like a movie star than a skipper, but this was, after all, Venice, the landof Italian elegance.“Maurizio Pimponi,” the man said, winking at Sienna as he welcomed them allaboard. “Prosecco? Limoncello? Champagne?”“No, grazie,” Sienna replied, instructing him in rapid-fire Italian to get themto St. Mark’s Square as fast as he possibly could.“Ma certo!” Maurizio winked again. “My boat, she is the fastest in all ofVenezia …”As Langdon and the others settled into plush seats in the open-air stern,Maurizio reversed the boat’s Volvo Penta motor, expertly backing away from thebank. Then he spun the wheel to the right and gunned the engines forward,maneuvering his large craft through a throng of gondolas, leaving a number ofstripe-shirted gondolieri shaking their fists as their sleek black crafts bobbedup and down in his wake.“Scusate!” Maurizio called apologetically. “VIPs!”Within seconds, Maurizio had pulled away from the congestion at Santa LuciaStation and was skimming eastward along the Grand Canal. As they acceleratedbeneath the graceful expanse of the Ponte degli Scalzi, Langdon smelled thedistinctively sweet aroma of the local delicacy seppie al nero—squid in its ownink—which was wafting out of the canopied restaurants along the bank nearby. Asthey rounded a bend in the canal, the massive, domed Church of San Geremia cameinto view.“Saint Lucia,” Langdon whispered, reading the saint’s name from the inscriptionon the side of the church. “The bones of the blind.”“I’m sorry?” Sienna glanced over, looking hopeful that Langdon might havefigured out something more about the mysterious poem.“Nothing,” Langdon said. “Strange thought. Probably nothing.” He pointed to thechurch. “See the inscription? Saint Lucia is buried there. I sometimes lectureon hagiographic art—art depicting Christian saints—and it just occurred to methat Saint Lucia is the patron saint of the blind.”“Sì, santa Lucia!” Maurizio chimed in, eager to be of service. “Saint for theblind! You know the story, no?” Their driver looked back at them and shoutedover the sound of the engines. “Lucia was so beautiful that all men have lustfor her. So, Lucia, for to be pure to God and keep virginity, she cut out herown eyes.”Sienna groaned. “There’s commitment.”“As reward for her sacrifice,” Maurizio added, “God gave Lucia an even morebeautiful set of eyes!”Sienna looked at Langdon. “He does know that makes no sense, right?”“The Lord works in mysterious ways,” Langdon observed, picturing the twenty orso famous Old Master paintings depicting Saint Lucia carrying her own eyeballson a platter.While there were numerous versions of the Saint Lucia tale, they all involvedLucia cutting out her lust-inducing eyes and placing them on a platter for herardent suitor and defiantly declaring: “Here hast thou, what thou so muchdesired … and, for the rest, I beseech thee, leave me now in peace!” Eerily, ithad been Holy Scripture that had inspired Lucia’s self-mutilation, foreverlinking her to Christ’s famous admonition “If thine eye offend thee, pluck itout and cast it from thee.”Pluck, Langdon thought, realizing the same word was used in the poem. Seek thetreacherous doge of Venice who … plucked up the bones of the blind.Puzzled by the coincidence, he wondered if perhaps this was a cryptic indicationthat Saint Lucia was the blind person being referenced in the poem.“Maurizio,” Langdon shouted, pointing to the Church of San Geremia. “The bonesof Saint Lucia are in that church, no?”“A few, yes,” Maurizio said, driving skillfully with one hand and looking backat his passengers, ignoring the boat traffic ahead. “But mostly no. Saint Luciais so beloved, her body has spread in churches all over the world. Venetianslove Saint Lucia the most, of course, and so we celebrate—”“Maurizio!” Ferris shouted. “Saint Lucia is blind, not you. Eyes front!”Maurizio laughed good-naturedly and turned forward just in time to handily avoidcolliding with an oncoming boat.Sienna was studying Langdon. “What are you getting at? The treacherous doge whoplucked up the bones of the blind?”Langdon pursed his lips. “I’m not sure.”He quickly told Sienna and Ferris the history of Saint Lucia’s relics—herbones—which was among the strangest in all of hagiography. Allegedly, when thebeautiful Lucia refused the advances of an influential suitor, the man denouncedher and had her burned at the stake, where, according to legend, her bodyrefused to burn. Because her flesh had been resistant to fire, her relics werebelieved to have special powers, and whoever possessed them would enjoy anunusually long life.“Magic bones?” Sienna said.“Believed to be, yes, which is the reason her relics have been spread all overthe world. For two millennia, powerful leaders have tried to thwart aging anddeath by possessing the bones of Saint Lucia. Her skeleton has been stolen,restolen, relocated, and divided up more times than that of any other saint inhistory. Her bones have passed through the hands of at least a dozen ofhistory’s most powerful people.”“Including,” Sienna inquired, “a treacherous doge?”Seek the treacherous doge of Venice who severed the heads from horses … andplucked up the bones of the blind.“Quite possibly,” Langdon said, now realizing that Dante’s Inferno mentionedSaint Lucia very prominently. Lucia was one of the three blessed women—le “tredonne benedette”—who helped summon Virgil to help Dante escape the underworld.As the other two women were the Virgin Mary and Dante’s beloved Beatrice, Dantehad placed Saint Lucia in the highest of all company.“If you’re right about this,” Sienna said, excitement in her voice, “then thesame treacherous doge who severed the heads from horses …”“… also stole the bones of Saint Lucia,” Langdon concluded.Sienna nodded. “Which should narrow our list considerably.” She glanced over atFerris. “Are you sure your phone’s not working? We might be able to searchonline for—”“Stone dead,” Ferris said. “I just checked. Sorry.”“We’ll be there soon,” Langdon said. “I have no doubt we’ll be able to find someanswers at St. Mark’s Basilica.”St. Mark’s was the only piece of the puzzle that felt rock solid to Langdon. Themouseion of holy wisdom. Langdon was counting on the basilica to reveal theidentity of their mysterious doge … and from there, with luck, the specificpalace that Zobrist had chosen to release his plague. For here, in the darkness,the chthonic monster waits.Langdon tried to push from his mind any images of the plague, but it was no use.He had often wondered what this incredible city had been like in its heyday …before the plague weakened it enough for it to be conquered by the Ottomans, andthen by Napoleon … back when Venice reigned gloriously as the commercial centerof Europe. By all accounts, there was no more beautiful city in the world, thewealth and culture of its population unparalleled.Ironically, it was the population’s taste for foreign luxuries that broughtabout its demise—the deadly plague traveling from China to Venice on the backsof rats stowed away on trading vessels. The same plague that destroyed anunfathomable two-thirds of China’s population arrived in Europe and very quicklykilled one in three—young and old, rich and poor alike.Langdon had read descriptions of life in Venice during the plague outbreaks.With little or no dry land in which to bury the dead, bloated bodies floated inthe canals, with some areas so densely packed with corpses that workers had tolabor like log rollers and prod the bodies out to sea. It seemed no amount ofpraying could diminish the plague’s wrath. By the time city officials realizedit was the rats that were causing the disease, it was too late, but Venice stillenforced a decree by which all incoming vessels had to anchor offshore for afull forty days before they would be permitted to unload. To this day, thenumber forty—quaranta in Italian—served as a grim reminder of the origins of theword quarantine.As their boat sped onward around another bend in the canal, a festive red awningluffed in the breeze, pulling Langdon’s attention away from his grim thoughts ofdeath toward an elegant, three-tiered structure on his left.CASINÒ DI VENEZIA: AN INFINITE EMOTION.While Langdon had never quite understood the words on the casino’s banner, thespectacular Renaissance-style palace had been part of the Venetian landscapesince the sixteenth century. Once a private mansion, it was now a black-tiegaming hall that was famous for being the site at which, in 1883, composerRichard Wagner had collapsed dead of a heart attack shortly after composing hisopera Parsifal.Beyond the casino on the right, a Baroque, rusticated facade bore an even largerbanner, this one deep blue, announcing the CA’ PESARO: GALLERIA INTERNAZIONALED’ARTE MODERNA. Years ago, Langdon had been inside and seen Gustav Klimt’smasterpiece The Kiss while it was on loan from Vienna. Klimt’s dazzlinggold-leaf rendering of intertwined lovers had sparked in him a passion for theartist’s work, and to this day, Langdon credited Venice’s Ca’ Pesaro witharousing his lifelong gusto for modern art.Maurizio drove on, powering faster now in the wide canal.Ahead, the famous Rialto Bridge loomed—the halfway point to St. Mark’s Square.As they neared the bridge, preparing to pass beneath it, Langdon looked up andsaw a lone figure standing motionless at the railing, peering down at them witha somber visage.The face was both familiar … and terrifying.Langdon recoiled on instinct.Grayish and elongated, the face had cold dead eyes and a long beaked nose.The boat slipped beneath the ominous figure just as Langdon realized it wasnothing more than a tourist showing off a recent purchase—one of the hundreds ofplague masks sold every day in the nearby Rialto Market.Today, however, the costume seemed anything but charming."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 69ST. MARK’S SQUARE LIES at the southernmost tip of Venice’s Grand Canal, wherethe sheltered waterway merges with the open sea. Overlooking this perilousintersection is the austere triangular fortress of Dogana da Mar—the MaritimeCustoms Office—whose watchtower once guarded Venice against foreign invasion.Nowadays, the tower has been replaced by a massive golden globe and a weathervane depicting the goddess of fortune, whose shifting directions on the breezeserve as a reminder to ocean-bound sailors of the unpredictability of fate.As Maurizio steered the sleek boat toward the end of the canal, the choppy seaopened ominously before them. Robert Langdon had traveled this route many timesbefore, although always in a much larger vaporetto, and he felt uneasy as theirlimo lurched on the growing swells.To reach the docks at St. Mark’s Square, their boat would need to cross anexpanse of open lagoon whose waters were congested with hundreds ofcraft—everything from luxury yachts, to tankers, to private sailboats, tomassive cruise liners. It felt as if they were leaving a country road andmerging onto an eight-lane superhighway.Sienna seemed equally uncertain as she eyed the towering ten-story cruise linerthat was now passing in front of them, only three hundred yards off. The ship’sdecks were crawling with passengers, all packed against the railings, takingphotos of St. Mark’s Square from the water. In the churning wake of this ship,three others were lined up, awaiting their chance to drive past Venice’sbest-known landmark. Langdon had heard that in recent years, the number of shipshad multiplied so quickly that an endless line of cruises passed all day and allnight.At the helm, Maurizio studied the line of oncoming cruise liners and thenglanced to his left at a canopied dock not far away. “I park at Harry’s Bar?” Hemotioned to the restaurant famous for having invented the Bellini. “St. Mark’sSquare is very short walking.”“No, take us all the way,” Ferris commanded, pointing across the lagoon towardthe docks at St. Mark’s Square.Maurizio shrugged good-naturedly. “Your choice. Hold on!”The engines revved and the limo began cutting through the heavy chop, fallinginto one of the travel lanes marked by buoys. The passing cruise liners lookedlike floating apartment buildings, their wakes tossing the other boats likecorks.To Langdon’s surprise, dozens of gondolas were making this same crossing. Theirslender hulls—at nearly forty feet in length and almost fourteen hundredpounds—appeared remarkably stable in the rough waters. Each vessel was pilotedby a sure-footed gondolier who stood on a platform on the left side of the sternin his traditional black-and-white-striped shirt and rowed a single oar attachedto the right-hand gunwale. Even in the rough water, it was evident that everygondola listed mysteriously to the left, an oddity that Langdon had learned wascaused by the boat’s asymmetrical construction; every gondola’s hull was curvedto the right, away from the gondolier, to resist the boat’s tendency to turnleft from the right-sided rowing.Maurizio pointed proudly to one of the gondolas as they powered past it. “Yousee the metal design on the front?” he called over his shoulder, motioning tothe elegant ornament protruding from the bow. “It’s the only metal on agondola—called ferro di prua—the iron of the prow. It is a picture of Venice!”Maurizio explained that the scythelike decoration that protruded from the bow ofevery gondola in Venice had a symbolic meaning. The ferro’s curved shaperepresented the Grand Canal, its six teeth reflected the six sestieri ordistricts of Venice, and its oblong blade was the stylized headpiece of theVenetian doge.The doge, Langdon thought, his thoughts returning to the task ahead. Seek thetreacherous doge of Venice who severed the heads from horses … and plucked upthe bones of the blind.Langdon raised his gaze to the shoreline ahead, where a small wooded park metthe water’s edge. Above the trees, silhouetted against a cloudless sky, rose theredbrick spire of St. Mark’s bell tower, atop which a golden Archangel Gabrielpeered down from a dizzying three hundred feet.In a city where high-rises were nonexistent as a result of their tendency tosink, the towering Campanile di San Marco served as a navigational beacon to allwho ventured into Venice’s maze of canals and passageways; a lost traveler, witha single glance skyward, would see the way back to St. Mark’s Square. Langdonstill found it hard to believe that this massive tower had collapsed in 1902,leaving an enormous pile of rubble on St. Mark’s Square. Remarkably, the lonecasualty in the disaster had been a cat.Visitors to Venice could experience the city’s inimitable atmosphere in anynumber of breathtaking locales, and yet Langdon’s favorite had always been theRiva degli Schiavoni. The wide stone promenade that sat along the water’s edgehad been built in the ninth century from dredged silt and ran from the oldArsenal all the way to St. Mark’s Square.Lined with fine cafés, elegant hotels, and even the home church of AntonioVivaldi, the Riva began its course at the Arsenal—Venice’s ancient shipbuildingyards—where the piney scent of boiling tree sap had once filled the air asboatbuilders smeared hot pitch on their unsound vessels to plug the holes.Allegedly it had been a visit to these very shipyards that had inspired DanteAlighieri to include rivers of boiling pitch as a torture device in his Inferno.Langdon’s gaze moved to the right, tracing the Riva along the waterfront, andcoming to rest on the promenade’s dramatic ending. Here, at the southernmostedge of St. Mark’s Square, the vast expanse of pavement met the open sea. DuringVenice’s golden age, this stark precipice had been proudly dubbed “the edge ofall civilization.”Today, the three-hundred-yard-long stretch where St. Mark’s Square met the seawas lined, as it always was, with no fewer than a hundred black gondolas, whichbobbed against their moorings, their scythelike bow ornaments rising and fallingagainst the white marble buildings of the piazza.Langdon still found it hard to fathom that this tiny city—just twice the size ofCentral Park in New York—had somehow risen out of the sea to become the largestand richest empire in the west.As Maurizio powered the boat closer, Langdon could see that the main square wasabsolutely mobbed with people. Napoleon had once referred to St. Mark’s Squareas “the drawing room of Europe,” and from the looks of things, this “room” washosting a party for far too many guests. The entire piazza looked almost as ifit would sink beneath the weight of its admirers.“My God,” Sienna whispered, gazing out at the throngs of people.Langdon wasn’t sure whether she was saying this out of fear that Zobrist mighthave chosen such a heavily populated location to release his plague … or becauseshe sensed that Zobrist might actually have had a point in warning about thedangers of overpopulation.Venice hosted a staggering number of tourists every year—an estimated one-thirdof 1 percent of the world’s population—some twenty million visitors in the year2000. With the additional billion added to the earth’s population since thatyear, the city was now groaning under the weight of three million more touristsper year. Venice, like the planet itself, had only a finite amount of space, andat some point would no longer be able to import enough food, dispose of enoughwaste, or find enough beds for all those who wanted to visit it.Ferris stood nearby, his eyes turned not toward the mainland, but out to sea,watching all the incoming ships.“You okay?” Sienna asked, eyeing him curiously.Ferris turned abruptly. “Yeah, fine … just thinking.” He faced front and calledup to Maurizio: “Park as close to St. Mark’s as you can.”“No problem!” Their driver gave a wave. “Two minutes!”The limo had now come even with St. Mark’s Square, and the Doge’s Palace rosemajestically to their right, dominating the shoreline.A perfect example of Venetian Gothic architecture, the palace was an exercise inunderstated elegance. With none of the turrets or spires normally associatedwith the palaces of France or England, it was conceived as a massive rectangularprism, which provided for the largest possible amount of interior square footagein which to house the doge’s substantial government and support staff.Viewed from the ocean, the palace’s massive expanse of white limestone wouldhave been overbearing had the effect not been carefully muted by the addition ofporticos, columns, a loggia, and quatrefoil perforations. Geometric patterns ofpink limestone ran throughout the exterior, reminding Langdon of the Alhambra inSpain.As the boat pulled closer to the moorings, Ferris seemed concerned by agathering of people in front of the palace. A dense crowd had gathered on abridge, and all of its members were pointing down a narrow canal that slicedbetween two large sections of the Doge’s Palace.“What are they looking at?” Ferris demanded, sounding nervous.“Il Ponte dei Sospiri,” Sienna replied. “A famous Venetian bridge.”Langdon peered down the cramped waterway and saw the beautifully carved,enclosed tunnel that arched between the two buildings. The Bridge of Sighs, hethought, recalling one of his favorite boyhood movies, A Little Romance, whichwas based on the legend that if two young lovers kissed beneath this bridge atsunset while the bells of St. Mark’s were ringing, they would love each otherforever. The deeply romantic notion had stayed with Langdon his entire life. Ofcourse, it hadn’t hurt that the film also starred an adorable fourteen-year-oldnewcomer named Diane Lane, on whom Langdon had immediately developed a boyhoodcrush … a crush that, admittedly, he had never quite shaken.Years later, Langdon had been horrified to learn that the Bridge of Sighs drewits name not from sighs of passion … but instead from sighs of misery. As itturned out, the enclosed walkway served as the connector between the Doge’sPalace and the doge’s prison, where the incarcerated languished and died, theirgroans of anguish echoing out of the grated windows along the narrow canal.Langdon had visited the prison once, and was surprised to learn that the mostterrifying cells were not those at water level, which often flooded, but thosenext door on the top floor of the palace proper—called piombi after theirlead-tiled roofs—which made them torturously hot in the summer and freezing coldin the winter. The great lover Casanova had once been a prisoner in the piombi;charged by the Inquisition with adultery and spying, he had survived fifteenmonths of incarceration only to escape by beguiling his keeper.“Sta’ attento!” Maurizio shouted to the pilot of a gondola as their limo slidinto the berth the gondola was just vacating. He had found a spot in front ofthe Hotel Danieli, only a hundred yards from St. Mark’s Square and the Doge’sPalace.Maurizio threw a line around a mooring post and leaped ashore as if he wereauditioning for a swashbuckling movie. Once he had secured the boat, he turnedand extended a hand down into the boat, offering to help his passengers out.“Thanks,” Langdon said as the muscular Italian pulled him ashore.Ferris followed, looking vaguely distracted and again glancing out to sea.Sienna was the last to disembark. As the devilishly handsome Maurizio hoistedher ashore, he fixed her with a deep stare that seemed to imply that she’d havea better time if she ditched her two companions and stayed aboard with him.Sienna seemed not to notice.“Grazie, Maurizio,” she said absently, her gaze focused on the nearby Doge’sPalace.Then, without missing a stride, she led Langdon and Ferris into the crowd."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 70APTLY NAMED AFTER one of history’s most famed travelers, the Marco PoloInternational Airport is located four miles north of St. Mark’s Square on thewaters of the Laguna Veneta.Because of the luxuries of private air travel, Elizabeth Sinskey had deplanedonly ten minutes earlier and was already skimming across the lagoon in afuturistic black tender—a Dubois SR52 Blackbird—which had been sent by thestranger who had phoned earlier.The provost.For Sinskey, after being immobilized in the back of the van all day, the openair of the ocean felt invigorating. She turned her face to the salty wind andlet her silver hair stream out behind her. Nearly two hours had passed since herlast injection, and she was finally feeling alert. For the first time since lastnight, Elizabeth Sinskey was herself.Agent Brüder was seated beside her along with his team of men. None of them saida word. If they had concerns about this unusual rendezvous, they knew theirthoughts were irrelevant; the decision was not theirs to make.As the tender raced on, a large island loomed up to them on the right, itsshoreline dotted with squat brick buildings and smokestacks. Murano, Elizabethrealized, recognizing the illustrious glassblowing factories.I can’t believe I’m back, she thought, enduring a sharp pang of sadness. Fullcircle.Years ago, while in med school, she had come to Venice with her fiancé andstopped to visit the Murano Glass Museum. There, her fiancé had spied abeautiful handblown mobile and innocently commented that he wanted to hang onejust like it someday in their baby’s nursery. Overcome with guilt for havingkept a painful secret far too long, Elizabeth finally leveled with him about herchildhood asthma and the tragic glucocorticoid treatments that had destroyed herreproductive system.Whether it had been her dishonesty or her infertility that turned the youngman’s heart to stone, Elizabeth would never know. But one week later, she leftVenice without her engagement ring.Her only memento of the heartbreaking trip had been a lapis lazuli amulet. TheRod of Asclepius was a fitting symbol of medicine—bitter medicine in thiscase—but she had worn it every day since.My precious amulet, she thought. A parting gift from the man who wanted me tobear his children.Nowadays, the Venetian islands carried no romance for her at all, their isolatedvillages sparking thoughts not of love but of the quarantine colonies that hadonce been established on them in an effort to curb the Black Death.As the Blackbird tender raced on past Isola San Pietro, Elizabeth realized theywere homing in on a massive gray yacht, which seemed to be anchored in a deepchannel, awaiting their arrival.The gunmetal-gray ship looked like something out of the U.S. military’s stealthprogram. The name emblazoned across the back offered no clue as to what kind ofship it might be.The Mendacium?The ship loomed larger and larger, and soon Sinskey could see a lone figure onthe rear deck—a small, solitary man, deeply tanned, watching them throughbinoculars. As the tender arrived at The Mendacium’s expansive rear dockingplatform, the man descended the stairs to greet them.“Dr. Sinskey, welcome aboard.” The sun-drenched man politely shook her hand, hispalms soft and smooth, hardly the hands of a boatman. “I appreciate your coming.Follow me, please.”As the group ascended several decks, Sinskey caught fleeting glimpses of whatlooked like busy cubicle farms. This strange ship was actually packed withpeople, but none were relaxing—they were all working.Working on what?As they continued climbing, Sinksey could hear the ship’s massive engines powerup, churning a deep wake as the yacht began moving again.Where are we going? she wondered, alarmed.“I’d like to speak to Dr. Sinskey alone,” the man said to the soldiers, pausingto glance at Sinskey. “If that’s okay with you?”Elizabeth nodded.“Sir,” Brüder said forcefully, “I’d like to recommend Dr. Sinskey be examined byyour onboard physician. She’s had some medical—”“I’m fine,” Sinskey interjected. “Truly. Thank you, though.”The provost eyed Brüder a long moment and then motioned to a table of food anddrink being set up on the deck. “Catch your breath. You’re going to need it.You’ll be going back ashore very shortly.”Without further ado, the provost turned his back on the agent and usheredSinskey into an elegant stateroom and study, closing the door behind him.“Drink?” he asked, motioning to a bar.She shook her head, still trying to take in her bizarre surroundings. Who isthis man? What does he do here?Her host was studying her now, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. “Are youaware that my client Bertrand Zobrist referred to you as ‘the silver-haireddevil’?”“I have a few choice names for him as well.”The man showed no emotion as he walked over to his desk and pointed down at alarge book. “I’d like you to look at this.”Sinskey walked over and eyed the tome. Dante’s Inferno? She recalled thehorrifying images of death that Zobrist had shown her during their encounter atthe Council on Foreign Relations.“Zobrist gave this to me two weeks ago. There’s an inscription.”Sinskey studied the handwritten text on the title page. It was signed byZobrist.My dear friend, thank you for helping me find the path.The world thanks you, too.Sinskey felt a chill. “What path did you help him find?”“I have no idea. Or rather, until a few hours ago I had no idea.”“And now?”“Now I’ve made a rare exception to my protocol … and I’ve reached out to you.”Sinskey had traveled a long way and was in no mood for a cryptic conversation.“Sir, I don’t know who you are, or what the hell you do on this ship, but youowe me an explanation. Tell me why you harbored a man who was being activelypursued by the World Health Organization.”Despite Sinskey’s heated tone, the man replied in a measured whisper: “I realizeyou and I have been working at cross-purposes, but I would suggest that weforget the past. The past is the past. The future, I sense, is what demands ourimmediate attention.”With that, the man produced a tiny red flash drive and inserted it into hiscomputer, motioning for her to sit down. “Bertrand Zobrist made this video. Hewas hoping I would release it for him tomorrow.”Before Sinskey could respond, the computer monitor dimmed, and she heard thesoft sounds of lapping water. Emerging from the blackness, a scene began to takeshape … the interior of a water-filled cavern … like a subterranean pond.Strangely, the water appeared to be illuminated from within … glowing with anodd crimson luminescence.As the lapping continued, the camera tilted downward and descended into thewater, focusing in on the cavern’s silt-covered floor. Bolted to the floor was ashiny rectangular plaque bearing an inscription, a date, and a name.IN THIS PLACE, ON THIS DATE,THE WORLD WAS CHANGED FOREVER.The date was tomorrow. The name was Bertrand Zobrist.Elizabeth Sinskey felt herself shudder. “What is this place?!” she demanded.“Where is this place?!”In response, the provost showed his first bit of emotion—a deep sigh ofdisappointment and concern. “Dr. Sinskey,” he replied, “I was hoping you mightknow the answer to that same question.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]One mile away, on the waterfront walkway of Riva degli Schiavoni, the view outto sea had changed ever so slightly. To anyone looking carefully, an enormousgray yacht had just eased around a spit of land to the east. It was now bearingdown on St. Mark’s Square.The Mendacium, FS-2080 realized with a surge of fear.Its gray hull was unmistakable.The provost is coming … and time is running out."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 71SNAKING THROUGH HEAVY crowds on the Riva degli Schiavoni, Langdon, Sienna, andFerris hugged the water’s edge, making their way into St. Mark’s Square andarriving at its southernmost border, the edge where the piazza met the sea.Here the throng of tourists was almost impenetrable, creating a claustrophobiccrush around Langdon as the multitudes gravitated over to photograph the twomassive columns that stood here, framing the square.The official gateway to the city, Langdon thought ironically, knowing the spothad also been used for public executions until as late as the eighteenthcentury.Atop one of the gateway’s columns he could see a bizarre statue of St. Theodore,posing proudly with his slain dragon of legendary repute, which always looked toLangdon much more like a crocodile.Atop the second column stood the ubiquitous symbol of Venice—the winged lion.Throughout the city, the winged lion could be seen with his paw resting proudlyon an open book bearing the Latin inscription Pax tibi Marce, evangelista meus(May Peace Be with You, Mark, My Evangelist). According to legend, these wordswere spoken by an angel upon St. Mark’s arrival in Venice, along with theprediction that his body would one day rest here. This apocryphal legend waslater used by Venetians to justify plundering St. Mark’s bones from Alexandriafor reburial in St. Mark’s Basilica. To this day, the winged lion endures as thecity’s symbol and is visible at nearly every turn.Langdon motioned to his right, past the columns, across St. Mark’s Square. “Ifwe get separated, meet at the front door of the basilica.”The others agreed and quickly began skirting the edges of the crowd andfollowing the western wall of the Doge’s Palace into the square. Despite thelaws forbidding feeding them, the celebrated pigeons of Venice appeared to bealive and well, some pecking about at the feet of the crowds and others swoopinginto the outdoor cafés to pillage unprotected bread baskets and torment thetuxedoed waiters.This grand piazza, unlike most in Europe, was shaped not in the form of a squarebut rather in that of the letter L. The shorter leg—known as thepiazzetta—connected the ocean to St. Mark’s Basilica. Up ahead, the square tooka ninety-degree left turn into its larger leg, which ran from the basilicatoward the Museo Correr. Strangely, rather than being rectilinear, the squarewas an irregular trapezoid, narrowing substantially at one end. Thisfun-house-type illusion made the piazza look far longer than it was, an effectthat was accentuated by the grid of tiles whose patterns outlined the originalstalls of fifteenth-century street merchants.As Langdon continued on toward the elbow of the square, he could see, directlyahead in the distance, the shimmering blue glass dial of the St. Mark’s ClockTower—the same astronomical clock through which James Bond had thrown a villainin the film Moonraker.It was not until this moment, as he entered the sheltered square, that Langdoncould fully appreciate this city’s most unique offering.Sound.With virtually no cars or motorized vehicles of any kind, Venice enjoyed ablissful absence of the usual civic traffic, subways, and sirens, leaving sonicspace for the distinctly unmechanical tapestry of human voices, cooing pigeons,and lilting violins serenading patrons at the outdoor cafés. Venice sounded likeno other metropolitan center in the world.As the late-afternoon sun streamed into St. Mark’s from the west, casting longshadows across the tiled square, Langdon glanced up at the towering spire of thecampanile, which rose high over the square and dominated the ancient Venetianskyline. The upper loggia of the tower was packed with hundreds of people. Eventhe mere thought of being up there made him shiver, and he put his head backdown and continued through the sea of humanity.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Sienna could easily have kept up with Langdon, but Ferris was lagging behind,and Sienna had decided to split the difference in order to keep both men insight. Now, however, as the distance between them grew more pronounced, shelooked back impatiently. Ferris pointed to his chest, indicating he was winded,and motioned for her to go on ahead.Sienna complied, moving quickly after Langdon and losing sight of Ferris. Yet asshe wove her way through the crowd, a nagging feeling held her back—the strangesuspicion that Ferris was lagging behind intentionally … as if he were trying toput distance between them.Having learned long ago to trust her instincts, Sienna ducked into an alcove andlooked out from the shadows, scanning the crowd behind her and looking forFerris.Where did he go?!It was as if he were no longer even trying to follow them. Sienna studied thefaces in the crowd, and finally she saw him. To her surprise, Ferris had stoppedand was crouched low, typing into his phone.The same phone he told me had a dead battery.A visceral fear gripped her, and again she knew she should trust it.He lied to me on the train.As Sienna watched him, she tried to imagine what he was doing. Secretly textingsomeone? Researching behind her back? Trying to solve the mystery of Zobrist’spoem before Langdon and Sienna could do so?Whatever his rationale, he had blatantly lied to her.I can’t trust him.Sienna wondered if she should storm over and confront him, but she quicklydecided to slip back into the crowd before he spotted her. She headed againtoward the basilica, searching for Langdon. I’ve got to warn him not to revealanything else to Ferris.She was only fifty yards from the basilica when she felt a strong hand tuggingon her sweater from behind.She spun around and found herself face-to-face with Ferris.The man with the rash was panting heavily, clearly having dashed through the mobto catch up with her. There was a frantic quality about him that Sienna hadn’tseen before.“Sorry,” he said, barely able to breathe. “I got lost in the crowd.”The instant Sienna looked in his eyes, she knew.He’s hiding something.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]When Langdon arrived in front of St. Mark’s Basilica, he was surprised todiscover that his two companions were no longer behind him. Also of surprise toLangdon was the absence of a line of tourists waiting to enter the church. Thenagain, Langdon realized, this was late afternoon in Venice, the hour when mosttourists—their energy flagging from heavy lunches of pasta and wine—decided tostroll the piazzas or sip coffee rather than trying to absorb any more history.Assuming that Sienna and Ferris would be arriving at any moment, Langdon turnedhis eyes to the entrance of the basilica before him. Sometimes accused ofoffering “an embarrassing surfeit of ingress,” the building’s lower facade wasalmost entirely taken up by a phalanx of five recessed entrances whose clusteredcolumns, vaulted archways, and gaping bronze doors arguably made the building,if nothing else, eminently welcoming.One of Europe’s finest specimens of Byzantine architecture, St. Mark’s had adecidedly soft and whimsical appearance. In contrast to the austere gray towersof Notre-Dame or Chartres, St. Mark’s seemed imposing and yet, somehow, far moredown-to-earth. Wider than it was tall, the church was topped by five bulgingwhitewashed domes that exuded an airy, almost festive appearance, causing morethan a few of the guidebooks to compare St. Mark’s to a meringue-topped weddingcake.High atop the central peak of the church, a slender statue of St. Mark gazeddown into the square that bore his name. His feet rested atop a crested archthat was painted midnight blue and dotted with golden stars. Against thiscolorful backdrop, the golden winged lion of Venice stood as the shimmeringmascot of the city.It was beneath the golden lion, however, that St. Mark’s displayed one of itsmost famous treasures—four mammoth copper stallions—which at the moment wereglinting in the afternoon sun.The Horses of St. Mark’s.Poised as if prepared to leap down at any moment into the square, these fourpriceless stallions—like so many treasures here in Venice—had been pillaged fromConstantinople during the Crusades. Another similarly looted work of art was ondisplay beneath the horses at the southwest corner of the church—a purpleporphyry carving known as The Tetrarchs. The statue was well known for itsmissing foot, broken off while it was being plundered from Constantinople in thethirteenth century. Miraculously, in the 1960s, the foot was unearthed inIstanbul. Venice petitioned for the missing piece of statue, but the Turkishauthorities replied with a simple message: You stole the statue—we’re keepingour foot.“Mister, you buy?” a woman’s voice said, drawing Langdon’s gaze downward.A heavyset Gypsy woman was holding up a tall pole on which hung a collection ofVenetian masks. Most were in the popular volto intero style—the stylizedfull-faced, white masks often worn by women during Carnevale. Her collectionalso contained some playful half-faced Colombina masks, a few triangle-chinnedbautas, and a strapless Moretta. Despite her colorful offerings, though, it wasa single, grayish-black mask at the top of the pole that seized Langdon’sattention, its menacing dead eyes seeming to stare directly down at him over along, beaked nose.The plague doctor. Langdon averted his eyes, needing no reminder of what he wasdoing here in Venice.“You buy?” the Gypsy repeated.Langdon smiled weakly and shook his head. “Sono molto belle, ma no, grazie.”As the woman departed, Langdon’s gaze followed the ominous plague mask as itbobbed above the crowd. He sighed heavily and raised his eyes back to the fourcopper stallions on the second-floor balcony.In a flash, it hit him.Langdon felt a sudden rush of elements crashing together—Horses of St. Mark’s,Venetian masks, and pillaged treasures from Constantinople.“My God,” he whispered. “That’s it!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 72ROBERT LANGDON WAS transfixed.The Horses of St. Mark’s!These four magnificent horses—with their regal necks and bold collars—hadsparked in Langdon a sudden and unexpected memory, one he now realized held theexplanation of a critical element of the mysterious poem printed on Dante’sdeath mask.Langdon had once attended a celebrity wedding reception at New Hampshire’shistoric Runnymede Farm—home to Kentucky Derby winner Dancer’s Image. As part ofthe lavish entertainment, the guests were treated to a performance by theprominent equine theatrical troupe Behind the Mask—a stunning spectacle in whichriders performed in dazzling Venetian costumes with their faces hidden behindvolto intero masks. The troupe’s jet-black Friesian mounts were the largesthorses Langdon had ever seen. Colossal in stature, these stunning animalsthundered across the field in a blur of rippling muscles, feathered hooves, andthree-foot manes flowing wildly behind their long, graceful necks.The beauty of these creatures left such an impression on Langdon that uponreturning home, he researched them online, discovering the breed had once been afavorite of medieval kings for use as warhorses and had been brought back fromthe brink of extinction in recent years. Originally known as Equus robustus, thebreed’s modern name, Friesian, was a tribute to their homeland of Friesland, theDutch province that was the birthplace of the brilliant graphic artist M. C.Escher.As it turned out, the powerful bodies of the early Friesian horses had inspiredthe robust aesthetic of the Horses of St. Mark’s in Venice. According to the Website, the Horses of St. Mark’s were so beautiful that they had become “history’smost frequently stolen pieces of art.”Langdon had always believed that this dubious honor belonged to the GhentAltarpiece and paid a quick visit to the ARCA Web site to confirm his theory.The Association for Research into Crimes Against Art offered no definitiveranking, but they did offer a concise history of the sculptures’ troubled lifeas a target of pillage and plunder.The four copper horses had been cast in the fourth century by an unknown Greeksculptor on the island of Chios, where they remained until Theodosius II whiskedthem off to Constantinople for display at the Hippodrome. Then, during theFourth Crusade, when Venetian forces sacked Constantinople, the ruling dogedemanded the four precious statues be transported via ship all the way back toVenice, a nearly impossible feat because of their size and weight. The horsesarrived in Venice in 1254, and were installed in front of the facade of St.Mark’s Cathedral.More than half a millennium later, in 1797, Napoleon conquered Venice and tookthe horses for himself. They were transported to Paris and prominently displayedatop the Arc de Triomphe. Finally, in 1815, following Napoleon’s defeat atWaterloo and his exile, the horses were winched down from the Arc de Triompheand shipped on a barge back to Venice, where they were reinstalled on the frontbalcony of St. Mark’s Basilica.Although Langdon had been fairly familiar with the history of the horses, theARCA site contained a passage that startled him.The decorative collars were added to the horses’ necks in 1204 by the Venetiansto conceal where the heads had been severed to facilitate their transportationby ship from Constantinople to Venice.The doge ordered the heads cut off the Horses of St. Mark’s? It seemedunthinkable to Langdon.“Robert?!” Sienna’s voice was calling.Langdon emerged from his thoughts, turning to see Sienna pushing her way throughthe crowd with Ferris close at her side.“The horses in the poem!” Langdon shouted excitedly. “I figured it out!”“What?” Sienna looked confused.“We’re looking for a treacherous doge who severed the heads from horses!”“Yes?”“The poem isn’t referring to live horses.” Langdon pointed high on the facade ofSt. Mark’s, where a shaft of bright sun was illuminating the four copperstatues. “It’s referring to those horses!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 73ON BOARD THE Mendacium, Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey’s hands were trembling. Shewatched the video in the provost’s study, and although she had seen someterrifying things in her life, this inexplicable movie that Bertrand Zobrist hadmade before his suicide left her feeling as cold as death.On the screen before her, the shadow of a beaked face wavered, projected on thedripping wall of an underground cavern. The silhouette continued speaking,proudly describing his masterpiece—the creation called Inferno—which would savethe world by culling the population.God save us, Sinskey thought. “We must …” she said, her voice quavering. “Wemust find that underground location. It may not be too late.”“Keep watching,” the provost replied. “It gets stranger.”Suddenly the shadow of the mask grew larger on the wet wall, looming hugelybefore her, until a figure stepped suddenly into the frame.Holy shit.Sinskey was staring at a fully outfitted plague doctor—complete with the blackcloak and chilling beaked mask. The plague doctor was walking directly towardthe camera, his mask filling the entire screen to terrifying effect.“ ‘The darkest places in hell,’ ” he whispered, “ ‘are reserved for those whomaintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis.’ ”Sinskey felt goose bumps on her neck. It was the same quotation that Zobrist hadleft for her at the airline counter when she had eluded him in New York a yearago.“I know,” the plague doctor continued, “that there are those who call memonster.” He paused, and Sinskey sensed his words were directed at her. “I knowthere are those who think me a heartless beast who hides behind a mask.” Hepaused again, stepping closer still to the camera. “But I am not faceless. Noram I heartless.”With that, Zobrist pulled off his mask and lowered the hood of his cloak—hisface laid bare. Sinskey stiffened, staring into the familiar green eyes she hadlast seen in the darkness of the CFR. His eyes in the video had the same passionand fire, but there was something else in them now—the wild zeal of a madman.“My name is Bertrand Zobrist,” he said, staring into the camera. “And this is myface, unveiled and naked for the world to see. As for my soul … if I could holdaloft my flaming heart, as did Dante’s Lord for his beloved Beatrice, you wouldsee I am overflowing with love. The deepest kind of love. For all of you. And,above all, for one of you.”Zobrist stepped closer still, gazing deep into the camera and speaking softly,as if to a lover.“My love,” he whispered, “my precious love. You are my beatitude, my destroyerof all vices, my endorser of all virtue, my salvation. You are the one who laynaked at my side and unwittingly helped me across the abyss, giving me thestrength to do what I now have done.”Sinskey listened with repulsion.“My love,” Zobrist continued in a doleful whisper that echoed in the ghostlysubterranean cavern in which he spoke. “You are my inspiration and my guide, myVirgil and my Beatrice all in one, and this masterpiece is as much yours as itis mine. If you and I, as star-crossed lovers, never touch again, I shall findmy peace in knowing that I have left the future in your gentle hands. My workbelow is done. And now the hour has come for me to climb again to the worldabove … and rebehold the stars.”Zobrist stopped talking, and the word stars echoed a moment in the cavern. Then,very calmly, Zobrist reached out and touched the camera, ending histransmission.The screen went black.“The underground location,” the provost said, turning off the monitor. “We don’trecognize it. Do you?”Sinskey shook her head. I’ve never seen anything like it. She thought of RobertLangdon, wondering if he had made any more headway in deciphering Zobrist’sclues.“If it’s of any help,” the provost said, “I believe I know who Zobrist’s loveris.” He paused. “An individual code-named FS-2080.”Sinskey jumped up. “FS-2080?!” She stared at the provost in shock.The provost looked equally startled. “That means something to you?”Sinskey gave an incredulous nod. “It most certainly does.”Sinskey’s heart was pounding. FS-2080. While she didn’t know the identity of theindividual, she certainly knew what the code name stood for. The WHO had beenmonitoring similar code names for years.“The Transhumanist movement,” she said. “Are you familiar with it?”The provost shook his head.“In the simplest terms,” Sinskey explained, “Transhumanism is a philosophystating that humans should use all available technologies to engineer our ownspecies to make it stronger. Survival of the fittest.”The provost shrugged as if unmoved.“Generally speaking,” she continued, “the Transhumanist movement is made up ofresponsible individuals—ethically accountable scientists, futurists,visionaries—but, as in many movements, there exists a small but militant factionthat believes the movement is not moving fast enough. They are apocalypticthinkers who believe the end is coming and that someone needs to take drasticaction to save the future of the species.”“And I’m guessing,” the provost said, “that Bertrand Zobrist was one of thesepeople?”“Absolutely,” Sinskey said. “A leader of the movement. In addition to beinghighly intelligent, he was enormously charismatic and penned doomsday articlesthat spawned an entire cult of zealots for Transhumanism. Today, many of hisfanatical disciples use these code names, all of which take a similar form—twoletters and a four-digit number—for example, DG-2064, BA-2105, or the one youjust mentioned.”“FS-2080.”Sinskey nodded. “That could only be a Transhumanist code name.”“Do the numbers and letters have meaning?”Sinskey motioned to his computer. “Pull up your browser. I’ll show you.”The provost looked uncertain but went to his computer and launched a searchengine.“Search for ‘FM-2030,’ ” Sinskey said, settling in behind him.The provost typed FM-2030, and thousands of Web pages appeared.“Click any of them,” Sinskey said.The provost clicked the top hit, which returned a Wikipedia page showing apicture of a handsome Iranian man—Fereidoun M. Esfandiary—whom it described asan author, philosopher, futurist, and forefather of the Transhumanist movement.Born in 1930, he was credited with introducing Transhumanist philosophy to themultitudes, as well as presciently predicting in vitro fertilization, geneticengineering, and the globalization of civilization.According to Wikipedia, Esfandiary’s boldest claim was that new technologieswould enable him to live to be a hundred years old, a rarity for his generation.As a display of his confidence in future technology, Fereidoun M. Esfandiarychanged his name to FM-2030, a code name created by combining his first andmiddle initials along with the year in which he would turn one hundred. Sadly,he succumbed to pancreatic cancer at age seventy and never reached his goal, butin honor of his memory, zealous Transhumanist followers still paid tribute toFM-2030 by adopting his naming technique.When the provost finished reading, he stood up and walked to the window, staringblankly out at the ocean for a long moment.“So,” he finally whispered, as if thinking aloud. “Bertrand Zobrist’s lover—thisFS-2080—is obviously one of these … Transhumanists.”“Without a doubt,” Sinskey replied. “I’m sorry I don’t know exactly who thisFS-2080 is, but—”“That was my point,” the provost interrupted, still staring out to sea. “I doknow. I know exactly who it is.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 74THE AIR ITSELF seems fashioned of gold.Robert Langdon had visited many magnificent cathedrals in his life, but theambience of St. Mark’s Chiesa d’Oro always struck him as truly singular. Forcenturies it had been claimed that simply breathing the air of St. Mark’s wouldmake you a richer person. The statement was intended to be understood not onlymetaphorically, but also literally.With an interior veneer consisting of several million ancient gold tiles, manyof the dust particles hovering in the air were said to be actual flecks of gold.This suspended gold dust, combined with the bright sunlight that streamedthrough the large western window, made for a vibrant atmosphere that helped thefaithful attain both spiritual wealth and, provided they inhaled deeply, a moreworldly enrichment in the form of gilding their lungs.At this hour, the low sun piercing the west window spread out over Langdon’shead like a broad, gleaming fan, or an awning of radiant silk. Langdon could nothelp but draw an awestruck breath, and he sensed Sienna and Ferris do the samebeside him.“Which way?” Sienna whispered.Langdon motioned toward a set of ascending stairs. The museum section of thechurch was on the upper level and contained an extensive exhibit devoted to theHorses of St. Mark’s, which Langdon believed would quickly reveal the identityof the mysterious doge who had severed the animals’ heads.As they climbed the stairs, he could see that Ferris was struggling again withhis breathing, and Sienna caught Langdon’s eye, which she had been trying to dofor several minutes now. Her expression was cautionary as she nodded discreetlytoward Ferris and mouthed something Langdon couldn’t understand. Before he couldask her for clarification, though, Ferris glanced back, a split second too late,for Sienna had already averted her eyes and was staring directly at Ferris.“You okay, Doctor?” she asked innocently.Ferris nodded and climbed faster.The talented actress, Langdon thought, but what was she trying to tell me?When they reached the second tier, they could see the entire basilica spread outbeneath them. The sanctuary had been constructed in the form of a Greek Cross,far more square in appearance than the elongated rectangles of St. Peter’s orNotre-Dame. With a shorter distance from narthex to altar, St. Mark’s exuded arobust, sturdy quality, as well as a feeling of greater accessibility.Not to appear too accessible, however, the church’s altar resided behind acolumned screen topped by an imposing crucifix. It was sheltered by an elegantciborium and boasted one of the most valuable altarpieces in the world—the famedPala d’Oro. An expansive backdrop of gilded silver, this “golden cloth” was afabric only in the sense that it was a fused tapestry of previousworks—primarily Byzantine enamel—all interwoven into a single Gothic frame.Adorned with some thirteen hundred pearls, four hundred garnets, three hundredsapphires, as well as emeralds, amethysts, and rubies, the Pala d’Oro wasconsidered, along with the Horses of St. Mark’s, to be one of the finesttreasures in Venice.Architecturally speaking, the word basilica defined any eastern, Byzantine-stylechurch erected in Europe or the West. Being a replica of Justinian’s Basilica ofthe Holy Apostles in Constantinople, St. Mark’s was so eastern in style thatguidebooks often suggested it as a viable alternative to visiting Turkishmosques, many of which were Byzantine cathedrals that had been turned intoMuslim houses of worship.While Langdon would never consider St. Mark’s a stand-in for the spectacularmosques of Turkey, he did have to admit that one’s passion for Byzantine artcould be satisfied with a visit to the secret suite of rooms just off the righttransept in this church, in which was hidden the so-called Treasure of St.Mark—a glittering collection of 283 precious icons, jewels, and chalicesacquired during the looting of Constantinople.Langdon was pleased to find the basilica relatively quiet this afternoon. Therewere still throngs of people, but at least there was room to maneuver. Weavingin and out of various groups, Langdon guided Ferris and Sienna toward the westwindow, where visitors could step outside and see the horses on the balcony.Despite Langdon’s confidence in their ability to identify the doge in question,he remained concerned about the step they’d have to take after that—locating thedoge himself. His tomb? His statue? This would probably require some form ofassistance, considering the hundreds of statues housed in the church proper, thelower crypt, and the domed tombs along the church’s north arm.Langdon spotted a young female docent giving a tour, and he politely interruptedher talk. “Excuse me,” he said. “Is Ettore Vio here this afternoon?”“Ettore Vio?” The woman gave Langdon an odd look. “Sì, certo, ma—” She stoppedshort, her eyes brightening. “Lei è Robert Langdon, vero?!” You’re RobertLangdon, aren’t you?Langdon smiled patiently. “Sì, sono io. Is it possible to speak with Ettore?”“Sì, sì!” The woman motioned for her tour group to wait a moment and hurriedoff.Langdon and the museum’s curator, Ettore Vio, had once appeared together in ashort documentary about the basilica, and they had kept in touch ever since.“Ettore wrote the book on this basilica,” Langdon explained to Sienna. “Severalof them, actually.”Sienna still looked strangely unnerved by Ferris, who stayed close while Langdonled the group across the upper register toward the west window, from which thehorses could be seen. As they reached the window, the stallions’ muscularhindquarters became visible in silhouette against the afternoon sun. Out on thebalcony, wandering tourists enjoyed close contact with the horses as well as aspectacular panorama of St. Mark’s Square.“There they are!” Sienna exclaimed, moving toward the door that led to thebalcony.“Not exactly,” Langdon said. “The horses we see on the balcony are actually justreplicas. The real Horses of St. Mark’s are kept inside for safety andpreservation.”Langdon guided Sienna and Ferris along a corridor toward a well-lit alcove wherean identical grouping of four stallions appeared to be trotting toward them outof a backdrop of brick archways.Langdon motioned admiringly to the statues. “Here are the originals.”Every time Langdon saw these horses up close, he couldn’t help but marvel at thetexture and detail of their musculature. Only intensifying the dramaticappearance of their rippling skin was the sumptuous, golden-green verdigris thatentirely covered their surface. For Langdon, seeing these four stallionsperfectly maintained despite their tumultuous past was always a reminder of theimportance of preserving great art.“Their collars,” Sienna said, motioning to the decorative breast collars aroundtheir necks. “You said those were added? To cover the seam?”Langdon had told Sienna and Ferris about the strange “severed head” detail hehad read about on the ARCA Web site.“Apparently, yes,” Langdon said, moving toward an informational placard postednearby.“Roberto!” a friendly voice bellowed behind them. “You insult me!” Langdonturned to see Ettore Vio, a jovial-looking, white-haired man in a blue suit,with eyeglasses on a chain around his neck, pushing his way through the crowd.“You dare to come to my Venice and not call me?”Langdon smiled and shook the man’s hand. “I like to surprise you, Ettore. Youlook good. These are my friends Dr. Brooks and Dr. Ferris.”Ettore greeted them and then stood back, appraising Langdon. “Traveling withdoctors? Are you sick? And your clothing? Are you turning Italian?”“Neither,” Langdon said, chuckling. “I’ve come for some information on thehorses.”Ettore looked intrigued. “There is something the famous professor does notalready know?”Langdon laughed. “I need to learn about the severing of these horses’ heads fortransport during the Crusades.”Ettore Vio looked as if Langdon had just inquired about the Queen’s hemorrhoids.“Heavens, Robert,” he whispered, “we don’t speak of that. If you want to seesevered heads, I can show you the famed decapitated Carmagnola or—”“Ettore, I need to know which Venetian doge cut off these heads.”“It never happened,” Ettore countered defensively. “I’ve heard the tales, ofcourse, but historically there is little to suggest that any doge committed—”“Ettore, please, humor me,” Langdon said. “According to the tale, which doge wasit?”Ettore put on his glasses and eyed Langdon. “Well, according to the tale, ourbeloved horses were transported by Venice’s most clever and deceitful doge.”“Deceitful?”“Yes, the doge who tricked everyone into the Crusades.” He eyed Langdonexpectantly. “The doge who took state money to sail to Egypt … but redirectedhis troops and sacked Constantinople instead.”Sounds like treachery, Langdon mused. “And what was his name?”Ettore frowned. “Robert, I thought you were a student of world history.”“Yes, but the world is large, and history is long. I could use some help.”“Very well then, a final clue.”Langdon was going to protest, but he sensed that he’d be wasting his breath.“Your doge lived for nearly a century,” Ettore said. “A miracle in his day.Superstition attributed his longevity to his brave act of rescuing the bones ofSaint Lucia from Constantinople and bringing them back to Venice. Saint Lucialost her eyes to—”“He plucked up the bones of the blind!” Sienna blurted, glancing at Langdon, whohad just had the same thought.Ettore gave Sienna an odd look. “In a manner of speaking, I suppose.”Ferris looked suddenly wan, as if he had not yet caught his breath from the longwalk across the plaza and the climb up the stairs.“I should add,” Ettore said, “that the doge loved Saint Lucia so much becausethe doge himself was blind. At the age of ninety, he stood out in this verysquare, unable to see a thing, and preached the Crusade.”“I know who it is,” Langdon said.“Well, I should hope so!” Ettore replied with a smile.Because his eidetic memory was better suited to images rather thanuncontextualized ideas, Langdon’s revelation had arrived in the form of a pieceof artwork—a famous illustration by Gustave Doré depicting a wizened, blinddoge, arms raised high overhead as he incited a gathered crowd to join theCrusade. The name of Doré’s illustration was clear in his mind: DandoloPreaching the Crusade.“Enrico Dandolo,” Langdon declared. “The doge who lived forever.”“Finalmente!” Ettore said. “I fear your mind has aged, my friend.”“Along with the rest of me. Is he buried here?”“Dandolo?” Ettore shook his head. “No, not here.”“Where?” Sienna demanded. “At the Doge’s Palace?”Ettore took off his glasses, thinking a moment. “Give me a moment. There are somany doges, I can’t recall—”Before Ettore could finish, a frightened-looking docent came running over andushered him aside, whispering in his ear. Ettore stiffened, looking alarmed, andimmediately hurried over to a railing, where he peered down into the sanctuarybelow. After a moment he turned back toward Langdon.“I’ll be right back,” Ettore shouted, and then hurried off without another word.Puzzled, Langdon went over to the railing and peered over. What’s going on downthere?At first he saw nothing at all, just tourists milling around. After a moment,though, he realized that many of the visitors were staring in the samedirection, toward the main entrance, through which an imposing group ofblack-clad soldiers had just entered the church and was fanning out across thenarthex, blocking all the exits.The soldiers in black. Langdon felt his hands tighten on the railing.“Robert!” Sienna called out behind him.Langdon remained fixated on the soldiers. How did they find us?! “Robert,” shecalled more urgently. “Something’s wrong! Help me!” Langdon turned from therailing, puzzled by her cries for help.Where did she go?An instant later, his eyes found both Sienna and Ferris. On the floor in frontof the Horses of St. Mark’s, Sienna was kneeling over Dr. Ferris … who hadcollapsed in convulsions, clutching his chest."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 75I THINK HE’S having a heart attack!” Sienna shouted.Langdon hurried over to where Dr. Ferris lay sprawled on the floor. The man wasgasping, unable to catch his breath.What happened to him?! For Langdon, everything had come to a head in a singlemoment. With the soldiers’ arrival downstairs and Ferris thrashing on the floor,Langdon felt momentarily paralyzed, unsure which way to turn.Sienna crouched down over Ferris and loosened his necktie, tearing open the topfew buttons of his shirt to help him breathe. But as the man’s shirt parted,Sienna recoiled and let out a sharp cry of alarm, covering her mouth as shestaggered backward, staring down at the bare flesh of his chest.Langdon saw it, too.The skin of Ferris’s chest was deeply discolored. An ominous-lookingbluish-black blemish the circumference of a grapefruit spread out across hissternum. Ferris looked like he’d been hit in the chest with a cannonball.“That’s internal bleeding,” Sienna said, glancing up at Langdon with a look ofshock. “No wonder he’s been having trouble breathing all day.”Ferris twisted his head, clearly trying to speak, but he could only make faintwheezing sounds. Tourists had started gathering around, and Langdon sensed thatthe situation was about to get chaotic.“The soldiers are downstairs,” Langdon warned Sienna. “I don’t know how theyfound us.”The look of surprise and fear on Sienna’s face turned quickly to anger, and sheglared back down at Ferris. “You’ve been lying to us, haven’t you?”Ferris attempted to speak again, but he could barely make a sound. Siennaroughly searched Ferris’s pockets and pulled out his wallet and phone, which sheslipped into her own pocket, standing over him now with an accusatory glower.At that moment an elderly Italian woman pushed through the crowd, shoutingangrily at Sienna. “L’hai colpito al petto!” She made a forceful motion with herfist against her own chest.“No!” Sienna snapped. “CPR will kill him! Look at his chest!” She turned toLangdon. “Robert, we need to get out of here. Now.”Langdon looked down at Ferris, who desperately locked eyes with him, pleading,as if he wanted to communicate something.“We can’t just leave him!” Langdon said frantically.“Trust me,” Sienna said. “That’s not a heart attack. And we’re leaving. Now.”As the crowd closed in, tourists began shouting for help. Sienna grippedLangdon’s arm with startling force and dragged him away from the chaos, out intothe fresh air of the balcony.For a moment Langdon was blinded. The sun was directly in front of his eyes,sinking low over the western end of St. Mark’s Square, bathing the entirebalcony in a golden light. Sienna led Langdon to their left along thesecond-story terrace, snaking through the tourists who had stepped outside toadmire the piazza and the replicas of the Horses of St. Mark’s.As they rushed along the front of the basilica, the lagoon was straight ahead.Out on the water, a strange silhouette caught Langdon’s eye—an ultramodern yachtthat looked like some kind of futuristic warship.Before he could give it a second thought, he and Sienna had cut left again,following the balcony around the southwest corner of the basilica toward the“Paper Door”—the annex connecting the basilica to the Doge’s Palace—so namedbecause the doges posted decrees there for the public to read.Not a heart attack? The image of Ferris’s black-and-blue chest was imprinted inLangdon’s mind, and he suddenly felt fearful at the prospect of hearing Sienna’sdiagnosis of the man’s actual illness. Moreover, it seemed something hadshifted, and Sienna no longer trusted Ferris. Was that why she was trying tocatch my eye earlier?Sienna suddenly skidded to a stop and leaned out over the elegant balustrade,peering down into a cloistered corner of St. Mark’s Square far below.“Damn it,” she said. “We’re higher up than I thought.”Langdon stared at her. You were thinking of jumping?!Sienna looked frightened. “We can’t let them catch us, Robert.”Langdon turned back toward the basilica, eyeing the heavy door of wrought ironand glass directly behind them. Tourists were entering and exiting, and ifLangdon’s estimate was correct, passing through the door would deposit them backinside the museum near the back of the church.“They’ll have all the exits covered,” Sienna said.Langdon considered their escape options and arrived at only one. “I think I sawsomething inside that could solve that problem.”Barely able to fathom what he was even now considering, Langdon guided Siennaback inside the basilica. They skirted the perimeter of the museum, trying tostay out of sight among the crowd, many of whom were now looking diagonallyacross the vast open space of the central nave toward the commotion going onaround Ferris. Langdon spied the angry old Italian woman directing a pair ofblack-clad soldiers out onto the balcony, revealing Langdon and Sienna’s escaperoute.We’ll have to hurry, Langdon thought, scanning the walls and finally spottingwhat he was looking for near a large display of tapestries.The device on the wall was bright yellow with a red warning sticker: ALLARMEANTINCENDIO.“A fire alarm?” Sienna said. “That’s your plan?”“We can slip out with the crowd.” Langdon reached up and grabbed the alarmlever. Here goes nothing. Acting quickly before he could think better of it, hepulled down hard, seeing the mechanism cleanly shatter the small glass cylinderinside.The sirens and pandemonium that Langdon expected never came.Only silence.He pulled again.Nothing.Sienna stared at him like he was crazy. “Robert, we’re in a stone cathedralpacked with tourists! You think these public fire alarms are active when asingle prankster could—”“Of course! Fire laws in the U.S.—”“You’re in Europe. We have fewer lawyers.” She pointed over Langdon’s shoulder.“And we’re also out of time.”Langdon turned toward the glass door through which they’d just entered and sawtwo soldiers hurrying in from the balcony, their hard eyes scanning the area.Langdon recognized one as the same muscular agent who had fired at them on theTrike as they were fleeing Sienna’s apartment.With precious few options, Langdon and Sienna slipped out of sight in anenclosed spiral stairwell, descending back to the ground floor. When theyreached the landing, they paused in the shadows of the stairwell. Across thesanctuary, several soldiers stood guarding the exits, their eyes intentlysweeping the entire room.“If we step out of this stairwell, they’ll see us,” Langdon said.“The stairs go farther down,” Sienna whispered, motioning to an ACCESSO VIETATOswag that cordoned off the stairs beneath them. Beyond the swag, the stairsdescended in an even tighter spiral toward pitch blackness.Bad idea, Langdon thought. Subterranean crypt with no exit.Sienna had already stepped over the swag and was groping her way down the spiraltunnel, disappearing into the void.“It’s open,” Sienna whispered from below.Langdon was not surprised. The crypt of St. Mark’s was different from many othersuch places in that it was also a working chapel, where regular services wereheld in the presence of the bones of St. Mark.“I think I see natural light!” Sienna whispered.How is that possible? Langdon tried to recall his previous visits to this sacredunderground space and guessed that Sienna was probably seeing the lux eterna—anelectric light that remained lit on St. Mark’s tomb in the center of the crypt.With footsteps approaching from above him, though, Langdon didn’t have time tothink. He quickly stepped over the swag, making sure he didn’t move it, and thenhe placed his palm on the rough-hewn stone wall, feeling his way down around thecurve and out of sight.Sienna was waiting for him at the bottom of the stairs. Behind her, the cryptwas barely visible in the darkness. It was a squat subterranean chamber with analarmingly low stone ceiling supported by ancient pillars and brick-vaultedarchways. The weight of the entire basilica rests on these pillars, Langdonthought, already feeling claustrophobic.“Told you,” Sienna whispered, her pretty face faintly illuminated by the hint ofmuted natural light. She pointed to several small, arched transoms, high on thewall.Light wells, Langdon realized, having forgotten they were here. Thewells—designed to bring light and fresh air into this cramped crypt—opened intodeep shafts that dropped down from St. Mark’s Square above. The window glass wasreinforced with a tight ironwork pattern of fifteen interlocking circles, andalthough Langdon suspected that they could be opened from inside, they wereshoulder height and would be a tight fit. Even if they somehow managed to getthrough the window into the shaft, climbing out of the shafts would beimpossible, since they were ten feet deep and covered by heavy security gratesat the top.In the dim light that filtered through the wells, St. Mark’s crypt resembled amoonlit forest—a dense grove of trunklike pillars that cast long andheavy-looking shadows across the ground. Langdon turned his gaze to the centerof the crypt, where a lone light burned at St. Mark’s tomb. The basilica’snamesake rested in a stone sarcophagus behind an altar, before which there werelines of pews for those lucky few invited to worship here at the heart ofVenetian Christendom.A tiny light suddenly flickered to life beside him and Langdon turned to seeSienna holding the illuminated screen of Ferris’s phone.Langdon did a double take. “I thought Ferris said his battery was dead!”“He lied,” Sienna said, still typing. “About a lot of things.” She frowned atthe phone and shook her head. “No signal. I thought maybe I could find thelocation of Enrico Dandolo’s tomb.” She hurried over to the light well and heldthe phone high overhead near the glass, trying to get a signal.Enrico Dandolo, Langdon thought, having barely had a chance to consider the dogebefore having to flee the area. Despite their current predicament, their visitto St. Mark’s had indeed served its purpose—revealing the identity of thetreacherous doge who severed the heads from horses … and plucked up the bones ofthe blind.Unfortunately, Langdon had no idea where Enrico Dandolo’s tomb was located, andapparently neither did Ettore Vio. He knows every inch of this basilica …probably of the Doge’s Palace, too. The fact that Ettore hadn’t immediatelylocated Dandolo’s tomb suggested to Langdon that the tomb was probably nowherenear St. Mark’s or the Doge’s Palace.So where is it?Langdon glanced over at Sienna, who was now standing on a pew that she had movedunder one of the light wells. She unlatched the window, swung it open, and heldFerris’s phone out into the open air of the shaft itself.The outdoor sounds of St. Mark’s Square filtered down from above, and Langdonsuddenly wondered if maybe there was some way out of here after all. There was aline of folding chairs behind the pews, and Langdon sensed that he might be ableto hoist one up into the light well. Maybe the upper grates unlatch from insideas well?Langdon hurried through the darkness toward Sienna. He had taken only a fewsteps when a powerful blow to his forehead knocked him backward. Crumpling tohis knees, he thought for an instant that he had been attacked. He had not, hequickly realized, cursing himself for not anticipating that his six-foot framefar exceeded the height of vaults built for the average human height of morethan a thousand years ago.As he knelt there on the hard stone and let the stars clear, he found himselfgazing at an inscription on the floor.Sanctus Marcus.He stared at it a long moment. It was not St. Mark’s name in the inscriptionthat struck him but rather the language in which it was written.Latin.After his daylong immersion in modern Italian, Langdon found himself vaguelydisoriented to see St. Mark’s name written in Latin, a quick reminder that thedead language was the lingua franca of the Roman Empire at the time of St.Mark’s death.Then a second thought hit Langdon.During the early thirteenth century—the time of Enrico Dandolo and the FourthCrusade—the language of power was still very much Latin. A Venetian doge who hadbrought great glory to the Roman Empire by recapturing Constantinople wouldnever have been buried under the name of Enrico Dandolo … instead his Latin namewould have been used.Henricus Dandolo.And with that, a long-forgotten image struck him like a jolt of electricity.Although the revelation had come while he was kneeling in a chapel, he knew itwas not divinely inspired. More likely, it was nothing more than a visual cuethat sparked his mind to make a sudden connection. The image that leapedsuddenly from the depths of Langdon’s memory was that of Dandolo’s Latin name …engraved in a worn marble slab, embedded in an ornate tile floor.Henricus Dandolo.Langdon could barely breathe as he pictured the doge’s simple tomb marker. I’vebeen there. Precisely as the poem had promised, Enrico Dandolo was indeed buriedin a gilded museum—a mouseion of holy wisdom—but it was not St. Mark’s Basilica.As the truth settled in, Langdon clambered slowly to his feet.“I can’t get a signal,” Sienna said, climbing down from the light well andcoming toward him.“You don’t need one,” Langdon managed. “The gilded mouseion of holy wisdom …” Hetook a deep breath. “I … made a mistake.”Sienna went pale. “Don’t tell me we’re in the wrong museum.”“Sienna,” Langdon whispered, feeling ill. “We’re in the wrong country.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 76OUT IN ST. MARK’S Square, the Gypsy woman selling Venetian masks was taking abreak, leaning against the outer wall of the basilica to rest. As always, shehad claimed her favorite spot—a small niche between two metal grates in thepavement—an ideal spot to set down her heavy wares and watch the setting sun.She had witnessed many things in St. Mark’s Square over the years, and yet thebizarre event that now drew her attention was not transpiring in the square … itwas happening instead beneath it. Startled by a loud sound at her feet, thewoman peered down through a grate into a narrow well, maybe ten feet deep. Thewindow at the bottom was open and a folding chair had been shoved out into thebottom of the well, scraping against the pavement.To the Gypsy’s surprise, the chair was followed by a pretty woman with a blondponytail who was apparently being hoisted from within and was now clamberingthrough the window into the tiny opening.The blond woman scrambled to her feet and immediately looked up, clearlystartled to see the Gypsy staring down at her through the grate. The blond womanraised a finger to her lips and gave a tight smile. Then she unfolded the chairand climbed onto it, reaching up toward the grate.You’re far too short, the Gypsy thought. And just what are you doing?The blond woman climbed back down off the chair and spoke to someone inside thebuilding. Although she barely had room to stand in the narrow well beside thechair, she now stepped aside as a second person—a tall, dark-haired man in afancy suit—heaved himself up out of the basilica basement and into the crowdedshaft.He, too, looked up, making eye contact with the Gypsy through the iron grate.Then, in an awkward twist of limbs, he exchanged positions with the blond womanand climbed up on top of the rickety chair. He was taller, and when he reachedup, he was able to unlatch the security bar beneath the grate. Standing ontiptoe, he placed his hands on the grate and heaved upward. The grate rose aninch or so before he had to set it down.“Può darci una mano?” the blond woman called up to the Gypsy.Give you a hand? the Gypsy wondered, having no intention of getting involved.What are you doing?The blond woman pulled out a man’s wallet and extracted a hundred-euro bill,waving it as an offering. It was more money than the vendor made with her masksin three days. No stranger to negotiation, she shook her head and held up twofingers. The blond woman produced a second bill.Disbelieving of her good fortune, the Gypsy shrugged a reluctant yes, trying tolook indifferent as she crouched down and grabbed the bars, looking into theman’s eyes so they could synchronize their efforts.As the man heaved again, the Gypsy pulled upward with arms made strong fromyears of carrying her wares, and the grate swung upward … halfway. Just as shethought they had it, there was a loud crash beneath her, and the mandisappeared, plummeting back down into the well as the folding chair collapsedbeneath him.The iron grate grew instantly heavier in her hands, and she thought she wouldhave to drop it, but the promise of two hundred euros gave her strength, and shemanaged to heave the grate up against the side of the basilica, where it came torest with a loud clang.Breathless, the Gypsy peered down into the well at the twist of bodies andbroken furniture. As the man got back up and brushed himself off, she reacheddown into the well, holding out her hand for her money.The ponytailed woman nodded appreciatively and raised the two bills over herhead. The Gypsy reached down, but it was too far.Give the money to the man.Suddenly there was a commotion in the shaft—angry voices shouting from insidethe basilica. The man and woman both spun in fear, recoiling from the window.Then everything turned to chaos.The dark-haired man took charge, crouching down and firmly ordering the woman toplace her foot into a cradle formed by his fingers. She stepped in, and heheaved upward. She skimmed up the side of the shaft, stuffing the bills in herteeth to free her hands as she strained to reach the lip. The man heaved, higher… higher … lifting her until her hands curled over the edge.With enormous effort, she heaved herself up into the square like a womanclimbing out of a swimming pool. She shoved the money into the Gypsy’s hands andimmediately spun around and knelt at the edge of the well, reaching back downfor the man.It was too late.Powerful arms in long black sleeves were reaching into the well like thethrashing tentacles of some hungry monster, grasping at the man’s legs, pullinghim back toward the window.“Run, Sienna!” shouted the struggling man. “Now!”The Gypsy saw their eyes lock in an exchange of pained regret … and then it wasover.The man was dragged roughly down through the window and back into the basilica.The blond woman stared down in shock, her eyes welling with tears. “I’m sosorry, Robert,” she whispered. Then, after a pause, she added, “For everything.”A moment later, the woman sprinted off into the crowd, her ponytail swinging asshe raced down the narrow alleyway of the Merceria dell’Orologio … disappearinginto the heart of Venice."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 77THE SOFT SOUNDS of lapping water eased Robert Langdon gently back toconsciousness. He smelled the sterile tang of antiseptics mixed with salty seaair and felt the world swaying beneath him.Where am I?Only moments before, it seemed, he had been locked in a death struggle againstpowerful hands that were dragging him out of the light well and back into thecrypt. Now, strangely, he no longer felt the cold stone floor of St. Mark’sbeneath him … instead he felt a soft mattress.Langdon opened his eyes and took in his surroundings—a small, hygienic-lookingroom with a single portal window. The rocking motion continued.I’m on a boat?Langdon’s last recollection was of being pinned to the crypt floor by one of theblack-clad soldiers, who hissed angrily at him, “Stop trying to escape!”Langdon had shouted wildly, calling for help as the soldiers tried to muffle hisvoice.“We need to get him out of here,” one soldier had said to another.His partner gave a reluctant nod. “Do it.”Langdon felt powerful fingertips expertly probing the arteries and veins on hisneck. Then, having located a precise spot on the carotid, the fingers beganapplying a firm, focused pressure. Within seconds, Langdon’s vision began toblur, and he felt himself slipping away, his brain being starved of oxygen.They’re killing me, Langdon thought. Right here beside the tomb of St. Mark.The blackness came, but it seemed incomplete … more of a wash of grayspunctuated by muted shapes and sounds.Langdon had little sense of how much time had passed, but the world was nowstarting to come back into focus for him. From all he could tell, he was in anonboard infirmary of some sort. His sterile surroundings and the scent ofisopropyl alcohol created a strange sense of déjà vu—as if Langdon had come fullcircle, awakening as he had the previous night, in a strange hospital bed withonly muted memories.His thoughts turned instantly to Sienna and her safety. He could still see hersoft brown eyes gazing down at him, filled with remorse and fear. Langdon prayedthat she had escaped and would find her way safely out of Venice.We’re in the wrong country, Langdon had told her, having realized to his shockthe actual location of Enrico Dandolo’s tomb. The poem’s mysterious mouseion ofholy wisdom was not in Venice after all … but a world away. Precisely as Dante’stext had warned, the cryptic poem’s meaning had been hidden “beneath the veil ofverses so obscure.”Langdon had intended to explain everything to Sienna as soon as they’d escapedthe crypt, but he’d never had the chance.She ran off knowing only that I failed.Langdon felt a knot tighten in his stomach.The plague is still out there … a world away.From outside the infirmary, he heard loud boot steps in the hall, and Langdonturned to see a man in black entering his berth. It was the same muscularsoldier who had pinned him to the crypt floor. His eyes were ice cold. Langdon’sinstinct was to recoil as the man approached, but there was nowhere to run.Whatever these people want to do to me, they can do.“Where am I?” Langdon demanded, putting as much defiance into his voice as hecould muster.“On a yacht anchored off Venice.”Langdon eyed the green medallion on the man’s uniform—a globe of the world,encircled by the letters ECDC. Langdon had never seen the symbol or the acronym.“We need information from you,” the soldier said, “and we don’t have much time.”“Why would I tell you anything?” Langdon asked. “You almost killed me.”“Not even close. We used a judo demobilization technique called shime waza. Wehad no intention of harming you.”“You shot at me this morning!” Langdon declared, clearly recalling the clang ofthe bullet on the fender of Sienna’s speeding Trike. “Your bullet barely missedthe base of my spine!”The man’s eyes narrowed. “If I had wanted to hit the base of your spine, I wouldhave hit it. I took a single shot trying to puncture your moped’s rear tire so Icould stop you from running away. I was under orders to establish contact withyou and figure out why the hell you were acting so erratically.”Before Langdon could fully process his words, two more soldiers came through thedoor, moving toward his bed.Walking between them was a woman.An apparition.Ethereal and otherworldly.Langdon immediately recognized her as the vision from his hallucinations. Thewoman before him was beautiful, with long silver hair and a blue lapis lazuliamulet. Because she had previously appeared against a horrifying landscape ofdying bodies, Langdon needed a moment to believe she was truly standing beforehim in the flesh.“Professor Langdon,” the woman said, smiling wearily as she arrived at hisbedside. “I’m relieved that you’re okay.” She sat down and took his pulse. “I’vebeen advised that you have amnesia. Do you remember me?”Langdon studied the woman for a moment. “I’ve had … visions of you, although Idon’t remember meeting.”The woman leaned toward him, her expression empathetic. “My name is ElizabethSinskey. I’m director of the World Health Organization, and I recruited you tohelp me find—”“A plague,” Langdon managed. “Created by Bertrand Zobrist.”Sinskey nodded, looking encouraged. “You remember?”“No, I woke up in a hospital with a strange little projector and visions of youtelling me to seek and find. That’s what I was trying to do when these men triedto kill me.” Langdon motioned to the soldiers.The muscular one bristled, clearly ready to respond, but Elizabeth Sinskeysilenced him with a wave.“Professor,” she said softly, “I have no doubt you are very confused. As theperson who pulled you into all this, I’m horrified by what has transpired, andI’m thankful you’re safe.”“Safe?” Langdon replied. “I’m captive on a ship!” And so are you!The silver-haired woman gave an understanding nod. “I’m afraid that due to youramnesia, many aspects of what I am about to tell you will be disorienting.Nonetheless, our time is short, and a lot of people need your help.”Sinskey hesitated, as if uncertain how to continue. “First off,” she began, “Ineed you to understand that Agent Brüder and his team never tried to harm you.They were under direct orders to reestablish contact with you by whatever meanswere necessary.”“Reestablish? I don’t—”“Please, Professor, just listen. Everything will be made clear. I promise.”Langdon settled back into the infirmary bed, his thoughts spinning as Dr.Sinskey continued.“Agent Brüder and his men are an SRS team—Surveillance and Response Support.They work under the auspices of the European Centre for Disease Prevention andControl.”Langdon glanced over at the ECDC medallions on their uniforms. DiseasePrevention and Control?“His group,” she continued, “specializes in detecting and containingcommunicable-disease threats. Essentially, they are a SWAT team for themitigation of acute, large-scale health risks. You were my main hope of locatingthe contagion Zobrist has created, and so when you vanished, I tasked the SRSteam with locating you … I summoned them to Florence to support me.”Langdon was stunned. “Those soldiers work for you?”She nodded. “On loan from the ECDC. Last night, when you disappeared and stoppedcalling in, we thought something had happened to you. It was not until earlythis morning, when our tech support team saw that you had checked your Harvarde-mail account, that we knew you were alive. At that point our only explanationfor your strange behavior was that you had switched sides … possibly having beenoffered large sums of money to locate the contagion for someone else.”Langdon shook his head. “That’s preposterous!”“Yes, it seemed an unlikely scenario, but it was the only logicalexplanation—and with the stakes being so high, we couldn’t take any chances. Ofcourse, we never imagined you were suffering from amnesia. When our tech supportsaw your Harvard e-mail account suddenly activate, we tracked the computer IPaddress to the apartment in Florence and moved in. But you fled on a moped, withthe woman, which increased our suspicions that you were now working for someoneelse.”“We drove right past you!” Langdon choked. “I saw you in the back of a blackvan, surrounded by soldiers. I thought you were a captive. You seemed delirious,like they had drugged you.”“You saw us?” Dr. Sinskey looked surprised. “Strangely, you’re right … they hadmedicated me.” She paused. “But only because I ordered them to.”Langdon was now wholly confused. She told them to drug her?“You may not remember this,” Sinskey said, “but as our C-130 landed in Florence,the pressure changed, and I suffered an episode of what is known as paroxysmalpositional vertigo—a severely debilitating inner-ear condition that I’veexperienced in the past. It’s temporary and not serious, but it causes victimsto become so dizzy and nauseated they can barely hold their heads up. NormallyI’d go to bed and endure intense nausea, but we were facing the Zobrist crisis,and so I prescribed myself hourly injections of metoclopramide to keep me fromvomiting. The drug has the serious side effect of causing intense drowsiness,but it enabled me at least to run operations by phone from the back of the van.The SRS team wanted to take me to a hospital, but I ordered them not to do sountil we had completed our mission of reacquiring you. Fortunately, the vertigofinally passed during the flight up to Venice.”Langdon slumped into the bed, unnerved. I’ve been running all day from the WorldHealth Organization—the very people who recruited me in the first place.“Now we have to focus, Professor,” Sinskey declared, her tone urgent. “Zobrist’splague … do you have any idea where it is?” She gazed down at him with anexpression of intense expectation. “We have very little time.”It’s far away, Langdon wanted to say, but something stopped him. He glanced upat Brüder, a man who had fired a gun at him this morning and nearly strangledhim a little while earlier. For Langdon, the ground had been shifting so quicklybeneath him that he had no idea whom to believe anymore.Sinskey leaned in, her expression still more intense. “We are under theimpression that the contagion is here in Venice. Is that correct? Tell us where,and I’ll send a team ashore.”Langdon hesitated.“Sir!” Brüder barked impatiently. “You obviously know something … tell us whereit is! Don’t you understand what’s about to happen?”“Agent Brüder!” Sinskey spun angrily on the man. “That’s enough,” she commanded,then turned back to Langdon and spoke quietly. “Considering what you’ve beenthrough, it’s entirely understandable that you’re disoriented, and uncertainwhom to trust.” She paused, staring deep into his eyes. “But our time is short,and I’m asking you to trust me.”“Can Langdon stand?” a new voice asked.A small, well-tended man with a deep tan appeared in the doorway. He studiedLangdon with a practiced calm, but Langdon saw danger in his eyes.Sinskey motioned for Langdon to stand up. “Professor, this is a man with whomI’d prefer not to collaborate, but the situation is serious enough that we haveno choice.”Uncertain, Langdon swung his legs over the side of the bed and stood erect,taking a moment to get his balance back.“Follow me,” the man said, moving toward the door. “There’s something you needto see.”Langdon held his ground. “Who are you?”The man paused and steepled his fingers. “Names are not important. You can callme the provost. I run an organization … which, I’m sorry to say, made themistake of helping Bertrand Zobrist achieve his goals. Now I am trying to fixthat mistake before it’s too late.”“What is it you want to show me?” Langdon asked.The man fixed Langdon with an unyielding stare. “Something that will leave nodoubt in your mind that we’re all on the same side.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 78LANGDON FOLLOWED THE tanned man through a maze of claustrophobic corridorsbelowdecks with Dr. Sinskey and the ECDC soldiers trailing behind in a singlefile. As the group neared a staircase, Langdon hoped they were about to ascendtoward daylight, but instead they descended deeper into the ship.Deep in the bowels of the vessel now, their guide led them through a cubiclefarm of sealed glass chambers—some with transparent walls and some with opaqueones. Inside each soundproofed room, various employees were hard at work typingon computers or speaking on telephones. Those who glanced up and noticed thegroup passing through looked seriously alarmed to see strangers in this part ofthe ship. The tanned man gave them a nod of reassurance and pressed on.What is this place? Langdon wondered as they continued through another series oftightly configured work areas.Finally, their host arrived at a large conference room, and they all filed in.As the group sat down, the man pressed a button, and the glass walls suddenlyhissed and turned opaque, sealing them inside. Langdon startled, having neverseen anything like it.“Where are we?” Langdon finally demanded.“This is my ship—The Mendacium.”“Mendacium?” Langdon asked. “As in … the Latin word for Pseudologos—the Greekgod of deception?”The man looked impressed. “Not many people know that.”Hardly a noble appellation, Langdon thought. Mendacium was the shadowy deity whoreigned over all the pseudologoi—the daimones specializing in falsehoods, lies,and fabrications.The man produced a tiny red flash drive and inserted it into a rack ofelectronic gear at the back of the room. A huge flat-panel LCD flickered tolife, and the overhead lights dimmed.In the expectant silence, Langdon heard soft lapping sounds of water. At first,he thought they were coming from outside the ship, but then he realized thesound was coming through the speakers on the LCD screen. Slowly, a picturematerialized—a dripping cavern wall, illuminated by wavering reddish light.“Bertrand Zobrist created this video,” their host said. “And he asked me torelease it to the world tomorrow.”In mute disbelief, Langdon watched the bizarre home movie … a cavernous spacewith a rippling lagoon … into which the camera plunged … diving beneath thesurface to a silt-covered tile floor on which was bolted a plaque that read INTHIS PLACE, ON THIS DATE, THE WORLD WAS CHANGED FOREVER.The plaque was signed: BERTRAND ZOBRIST.The date was tomorrow.My God! Langdon turned to Sinskey in the darkness, but she was just staringblankly at the floor, apparently having seen the film already, and clearlyunable to watch it again.The camera panned left now, and Langdon was baffled to see, hovering beneath thewater, an undulating bubble of transparent plastic containing a gelatinous,yellow-brown liquid. The delicate sphere appeared to be tethered to the floor soit could not rise to the surface.What the hell? Langdon studied the distended bag. The viscous contents seemed tobe slowly swirling … smoldering almost.When it hit him, Langdon stopped breathing. Zobrist’s plague.“Stop the playback,” Sinskey said in the darkness.The image froze—a tethered plastic sac hovering beneath the water—a sealed cloudof liquid suspended in space.“I think you can guess what that is,” Sinskey said. “The question is, how longwill it remain contained?” She walked up to the LCD and pointed to a tinymarking on the transparent bag. “Unfortunately, this tells us what the bag ismade of. Can you read that?”Pulse racing, Langdon squinted at the text, which appeared to be amanufacturer’s trademark notice: Solublon®.“World’s largest manufacturer of water-soluble plastics,” Sinskey said.Langdon felt his stomach knot. “You’re saying this bag is … dissolving?!”Sinskey gave him a grim nod. “We’ve been in touch with the manufacturer, fromwhom we learned, unfortunately, that they make dozens of different grades ofthis plastic, dissolving in anywhere from ten minutes to ten weeks, depending onthe application. Decay rates vary slightly based on water type and temperature,but we have no doubt that Zobrist took those factors into careful account.” Shepaused. “This bag, we believe, will dissolve by—”“Tomorrow,” the provost interrupted. “Tomorrow is the date Zobrist circled in mycalendar. And also the date on the plaque.”Langdon sat speechless in the dark.“Show him the rest,” Sinskey said.On the LCD screen, the video image refreshed, the camera now panning along theglowing waters and cavernous darkness. Langdon had no doubt that this was thelocation referenced in the poem. The lagoon that reflects no stars.The scene conjured images of Dante’s visions of hell … the river Cocytus flowingthrough the caverns of the underworld.Wherever this lagoon was located, its waters were contained by steep, mossywalls, which, Langdon sensed, had to be man-made. He also sensed that the camerawas revealing only a small corner of the massive interior space, and this notionwas supported by the presence of very faint vertical shadows on the wall. Theshadows were broad, columnar, and evenly spaced.Pillars, Langdon realized.The ceiling of this cavern is supported by pillars.This lagoon was not in a cavern, it was in a massive room.Follow deep into the sunken palace …Before he could say a word, his attention shifted to the arrival of a new shadowon the wall … a humanoid shape with a long, beaked nose.Oh, dear God …The shadow began speaking now, its words muffled, whispering across the waterwith an eerily poetic rhythm.“I am your salvation. I am the Shade.”For the next several minutes, Langdon watched the most terrifying film he hadever witnessed. Clearly the ravings of a lunatic genius, the soliloquy ofBertrand Zobrist—delivered in the guise of the plague doctor—was laden withreferences to Dante’s Inferno and carried a very clear message: human populationgrowth was out of control, and the very survival of mankind was hanging in thebalance.Onscreen, the voice intoned:“To do nothing is to welcome Dante’s hell … cramped and starving, weltering inSin. And so boldly I have taken action. Some will recoil in horror, but allsalvation comes at a price. One day the world will grasp the beauty of mysacrifice.”Langdon recoiled as Zobrist himself abruptly appeared, dressed as the plaguedoctor, and then tore off his mask. Langdon stared at the gaunt face and wildgreen eyes, realizing that he was finally seeing the face of the man who was atthe center of this crisis. Zobrist began professing his love to someone hecalled his inspiration.“I have left the future in your gentle hands. My work below is done. And now thehour has come for me to climb again to the world above … and rebehold thestars.”As the video ended, Langdon recognized Zobrist’s final words as a near duplicateof Dante’s final words in the Inferno.In the darkness of the conference room, Langdon realized that all the moments offear he had experienced today had just crystallized into a single, terrifyingreality.Bertrand Zobrist now had a face … and a voice.The conference room lights came up, and Langdon saw all eyes trained expectantlyon him.Elizabeth Sinskey’s expression seemed frozen as she stood up and nervouslystroked her amulet. “Professor, obviously our time is very short. The only goodnews so far is that we’ve had no cases of pathogen detection, or reportedillness, so we’re assuming the suspended Solublon bag is still intact. But wedon’t know where to look. Our goal is to neutralize this threat by containingthe bag before it ruptures. The only way we can do that, of course, is to findits location immediately.”Agent Brüder stood up now, staring intently at Langdon. “We’re assuming you cameto Venice because you learned that this is where Zobrist hid his plague.”Langdon gazed out at the assembly before him, faces taut with fear, everyonehoping for a miracle, and he wished he had better news to offer them.“We’re in the wrong country,” Langdon announced. “What you’re looking for isnearly a thousand miles from here.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Langdon’s insides reverberated with the deep thrum of The Mendacium’s engines asthe ship powered through its wide turn, banking back toward the Venice Airport.On board, all hell had broken loose. The provost had dashed off, shouting ordersto his crew. Elizabeth Sinskey had grabbed her phone and called the pilots ofthe WHO’s C-130 transport plane, demanding they be prepped as soon as possibleto fly out of the Venice Airport. And Agent Brüder had jumped on a laptop to seeif he could coordinate some kind of international advance team at their finaldestination.A world away.The provost now returned to the conference room and urgently addressed Brüder.“Any further word from the Venetian authorities?”Brüder shook his head. “No trace. They’re looking, but Sienna Brooks hasvanished.”Langdon did a double take. They’re looking for Sienna?Sinskey finished her phone call and also joined the conversation. “No luckfinding her?”The provost shook his head. “If you’re agreeable, I think the WHO shouldauthorize the use of force if necessary to bring her in.”Langdon jumped to his feet. “Why?! Sienna Brooks is not involved in any ofthis!”The provost’s dark eyes cut to Langdon. “Professor, there are some things I haveto tell you about Ms. Brooks.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 79PUSHING PAST THE crush of tourists on the Rialto Bridge, Sienna Brooks beganrunning again, sprinting west along the canal-front walkway of the FondamentaVin Castello.They’ve got Robert.She could still see his desperate eyes gazing up at her as the soldiers draggedhim back down the light well into the crypt. She had little doubt that hiscaptors would quickly persuade him, one way or another, to reveal everything hehad figured out.We’re in the wrong country.Far more tragic, though, was her knowledge that his captors would waste no timerevealing to Langdon the true nature of the situation.I’m so sorry, Robert.For everything.Please know I had no choice.Strangely, Sienna missed him already. Here, amid the masses of Venice, she felta familiar loneliness settling in.The feeling was nothing new.Since childhood, Sienna Brooks had felt alone.Growing up with an exceptional intellect, Sienna had spent her youth feelinglike a stranger in a strange land … an alien trapped on a lonely world. Shetried to make friends, but her peers immersed themselves in frivolities thatheld no interest to her. She tried to respect her elders, but most adults seemedlike nothing more than aging children, lacking even the most basic understandingof the world around them, and, most troubling, lacking any curiosity or concernabout it.I felt I was a part of nothing.And so Sienna Brooks learned how to be a ghost. Invisible. She learned how to bea chameleon, a performer, playing just another face in the crowd. Her childhoodpassion for stage acting, she had no doubt, stemmed from what would become herlifelong dream of becoming someone else.Someone normal.Her performance in Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream helped her feel apart of something, and the adult actors were supportive without beingcondescending. Her joy, however, was short-lived, evaporating the moment sheleft the stage on opening night and faced throngs of wide-eyed media peoplewhile her costars quietly skulked out the back door unnoticed.Now they hate me, too.By the age of seven, Sienna had read enough to diagnose herself with deepdepression. When she told her parents, they seemed dumbfounded, as they usuallywere by the strangeness of their own daughter. Nonetheless, they sent her to apsychiatrist. The doctor asked her a lot of questions, which Sienna had alreadyasked herself, and then he prescribed a combination of amitriptyline andchlordiazepoxide.Furious, Sienna jumped off his couch. “Amitriptyline?!” she challenged. “I wantto be happier—not a zombie!”The psychiatrist, to his great credit, remained very calm in the face of heroutburst and offered a second suggestion. “Sienna, if you prefer not to takepharmaceuticals, we can try a more holistic approach.” He paused. “It sounds asif you are trapped in a cycle of thinking about yourself and how you don’tbelong in the world.”“That’s true,” Sienna replied. “I try to stop, but I can’t!”He smiled calmly. “Of course you can’t stop. It is physically impossible for thehuman mind to think of nothing. The soul craves emotion, and it will continue toseek fuel for that emotion—good or bad. Your problem is that you’re giving itthe wrong fuel.”Sienna had never heard anyone talk about the mind in such mechanical terms, andshe was instantly intrigued. “How do I give it a different fuel?”“You need to shift your intellectual focus,” he said. “Currently, you thinkmainly about yourself. You wonder why you don’t fit … and what is wrong withyou.”“That’s true,” Sienna said again, “but I’m trying to solve the problem. I’mtrying to fit in. I can’t solve the problem if I don’t think about it.”He chuckled. “I believe that thinking about the problem … is your problem.” Thedoctor suggested that she try to shift her focus away from herself and her ownproblems … turning her attention instead to the world around her … and itsproblems.That’s when everything changed.She began pouring all of her energy not into feeling sorry for herself … butinto feeling sorry for other people. She began a philanthropic initiative,ladled soup at homeless shelters, and read books to the blind. Incredibly, noneof the people Sienna helped even seemed to notice that she was different. Theywere just grateful that somebody cared.Sienna worked harder every week, barely able to sleep because of the realizationthat so many people needed her help.“Sienna, slow down!” people would urge her. “You can’t save the world!”What a terrible thing to say.Through her acts of public service, Sienna came in contact with several membersof a local humanitarian group. When they invited her to join them on a monthlongtrip to the Philippines, she jumped at the chance.Sienna imagined they were going to feed poor fishermen or farmers in thecountryside, which she had read was a wonderland of geological beauty, withvibrant seabeds and dazzling plains. And so when the group settled in among thethrongs in the city of Manila—the most densely populated city on earth—Siennacould only gape in horror. She had never seen poverty on this scale.How can one person possibly make a difference?For every one person Sienna fed, there were hundreds more who gazed at her withdesolate eyes. Manila had six-hour traffic jams, suffocating pollution, and ahorrifying sex trade, whose workers consisted primarily of young children, manyof whom had been sold to pimps by parents who took solace in knowing that atleast their children would be fed.Amid this chaos of child prostitution, panhandlers, pickpockets, and worse,Sienna found herself suddenly paralyzed. All around her, she could see humanityoverrun by its primal instinct for survival. When they face desperation … humanbeings become animals.For Sienna, all the dark depression came flooding back. She had suddenlyunderstood mankind for what it was—a species on the brink.I was wrong, she thought. I can’t save the world.Overwhelmed by a rush of frantic mania, Sienna broke into a sprint through thecity streets, thrusting her way through the masses of people, knocking themover, pressing on, searching for open space.I’m being suffocated by human flesh!As she ran, she could feel the eyes upon her again. She no longer blended in.She was tall and fair-skinned with a blond ponytail waving behind her. Menstared at her as if she were naked.When her legs finally gave out, she had no idea how far she had run or where shehad gone. She cleared the tears and grime from her eyes and saw that she wasstanding in a kind of shantytown—a city made of pieces of corrugated metal andcardboard propped up and held together. All around her the wails of cryingbabies and the stench of human excrement hung in the air.I’ve run through the gates of hell.“Turista,” a deep voice sneered behind her. “Magkano?” How much?Sienna spun to see three young men approaching, salivating like wolves. Sheinstantly knew she was in danger and she tried to back away, but they corralledher, like predators hunting in a pack.Sienna shouted for help, but nobody paid attention to her cries. Only fifteenfeet away, she saw an old woman sitting on a tire, carving the rot off an oldonion with a rusty knife. The woman did not even glance up when Sienna shouted.When the men seized her and dragged her inside a little shack, Sienna had noillusions about what was going to happen, and the terror was all-consuming. Shefought with everything she had, but they were strong, quickly pinning her downon an old, soiled mattress.They tore open her shirt, clawing at her soft skin. When she screamed, theystuffed her torn shirt so deep into her mouth that she thought she would choke.Then they flipped her onto her stomach, forcing her face into the putrid bed.Sienna Brooks had always felt pity for the ignorant souls who could believe inGod amid a world of such suffering, and yet now she herself was praying …praying with all her heart.Please, God, deliver me from evil.Even as she prayed, she could hear the men laughing, taunting her as theirfilthy hands hauled her jeans down over her flailing legs. One of them climbedonto her back, sweaty and heavy, his perspiration dripping onto her skin.I’m a virgin, Sienna thought. This is how it is going to happen for me. Suddenlythe man on her back leaped off her, and the taunting jeers turned to shouts ofanger and fear. The warm sweat rolling onto Sienna’s back from above suddenlybegan gushing … spilling onto the mattress in splatters of red.When Sienna rolled over to see what was happening, she saw the old woman withthe half-peeled onion and the rusty knife standing over her attacker, who wasnow bleeding profusely from his back.The old woman glared threateningly at the others, whipping her bloody knifethrough the air until the three men scampered off.Without a word, the old woman helped Sienna gather her clothes and get dressed.“Salamat,” Sienna whispered tearfully. “Thank you.”The old woman tapped her ear, indicating she was deaf.Sienna placed her palms together, closed her eyes, and bowed her head in agesture of respect. When she opened her eyes, the woman was gone.Sienna left the Philippines at once, without even saying good-bye to the othermembers of the group. She never once spoke of what had happened to her. Shehoped that ignoring the incident would make it fade away, but it seemed only tomake it worse. Months later, she was still haunted by night terrors, and she nolonger felt safe anywhere. She took up martial arts, and despite quicklymastering the deadly skill of dim mak, she still felt at risk everywhere shewent.Her depression returned, surging tenfold, and eventually she stopped sleepingaltogether. Every time she combed her hair, she noticed that huge clumps werefalling out, more hair every day. To her horror, within weeks, she was halfbald, having developed symptoms that she self-diagnosed as telegenic effluvium—astress-related alopecia with no cure other than curing one’s stress. Every timeshe looked in the mirror, though, she saw her balding head and felt her heartrace.I look like an old woman!Finally, she had no choice but to shave her head. At least she no longer lookedold. She simply looked ill. Not wanting to look like a cancer victim, shepurchased a wig, which she wore in a blond ponytail, and at least looked likeherself again.Inside, however, Sienna Brooks was changed.I am damaged goods.In a desperate attempt to leave her life behind, she traveled to America andattended medical school. She had always had an affinity for medicine, and shehoped that being a doctor would make her feel like she was being of service … asif she were doing something at least to ease the pain of this troubled world.Despite the long hours, school had been easy for her, and while her classmateswere studying, Sienna took a part-time acting job to earn some extra money. Thegig definitely wasn’t Shakespeare, but her skills with language and memorizationmeant that instead of feeling like work, acting felt like a sanctuary whereSienna could forget who she was … and be someone else.Anybody else.Sienna had been trying to escape her identity since she could first speak. As achild, she had shunned her given name, Felicity, in favor of her middle name,Sienna. Felicity meant “fortunate,” and she knew she was anything but.Remove the focus on your own problems, she reminded herself. Focus on theproblems of the world.Her panic attack in the crowded streets of Manila had sparked in Sienna a deepconcern about overcrowding and world population. It was then that she discoveredthe writings of Bertrand Zobrist, a genetic engineer who had proposed some veryprogressive theories about world population.He’s a genius, she realized, reading his work. Sienna had never felt that wayabout another human being, and the more of Zobrist she read, the more she feltlike she was looking into the heart of a soul mate. His article “You Can’t Savethe World” reminded Sienna of what everyone used to tell her as a child … andyet Zobrist believed the exact opposite.You CAN save the world, Zobrist wrote. If not you, then who? If not now, when?Sienna studied Zobrist’s mathematical equations carefully, educating herself onhis predictions of a Malthusian catastrophe and the impending collapse of thespecies. Her intellect loved the high-level speculations, but she felt herstress level climbing as she saw the entire future before her … mathematicallyguaranteed … so obvious … inevitable.Why doesn’t anyone else see this coming?Though she was frightened by his ideas, Sienna became obsessed with Zobrist,watching videos of his presentations, reading everything he had ever written.When Sienna heard that he had a speaking engagement in the United States, sheknew she had to go see him. And that was the night her entire world had changed.A smile lit up her face, a rare moment of happiness, as she again pictured thatmagical evening … an evening she had vividly recalled only hours earlier whilesitting on the train with Langdon and Ferris.Chicago. The blizzard.January, six years ago … but it still feels like yesterday. I am trudgingthrough snowbanks along the windswept Magnificent Mile, collar upturned againstthe blinding whiteout. Despite the cold, I tell myself that nothing will keep mefrom my destination. Tonight is my chance to hear the great Bertrand Zobristspeak … in person.The hall is nearly deserted when Bertrand takes the stage, and he is tall … sovery tall … with vibrant green eyes that seem to hold all the mysteries of theworld.“To hell with this empty auditorium,” he declares. “Let’s go to the bar!” Andthen we are there, a handful of us, in a quiet booth, as he speaks of genetics,of population, and of his newest passion … Transhumanism.As the drinks flow, I feel as if I’m having a private audience with a rock star.Every time Zobrist glances over at me, his green eyes ignite a wholly unexpectedfeeling inside me … the deep pull of sexual attraction.It is a wholly new sensation for me.And then we are alone.“Thank you for tonight,” I say to him, feeling a little tipsy. “You’re anamazing teacher.”“Flattery?” Zobrist smiles and leans closer, our legs touching now. “It will getyou everywhere.”The flirtation is clearly inappropriate, but it is a snowy night in a desertedChicago hotel, and it feels as if the entire world has stopped.“So what do you think?” Zobrist says. “Nightcap in my room?”I freeze, knowing I must look like a deer in the headlights. I don’t know how todo this!Zobrist’s eyes twinkle warmly. “Let me guess,” he whispers. “You’ve never beenwith a famous man.”I feel myself flush, fighting to hide a surge of emotions—embarrassment,excitement, fear. “Actually, to be honest,” I say to him, “I’ve never been withany man.”Zobrist smiles and inches closer. “I’m not sure what you’ve been waiting for,but please let me be your first.”In that moment all the awkward sexual fears and frustrations of my childhooddisappear … evaporating into the snowy night.Then, I am naked in his arms.“Relax, Sienna,” he whispers, and then, with patient hands, he coaxes from myinexperienced body a torrent of sensations that I have never imagined existed.Basking in the cocoon of Zobrist’s embrace, I feel as if everything is finallyright in the world, and I know my life has purpose.I have found Love.And I will follow it anywhere."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 80ABOVEDECKS ON THE Mendacium, Langdon gripped the polished teak railing, steadiedhis wavering legs, and tried to catch his breath. The sea air had grown colder,and the roar of low-flying commercial jets told him they were nearing the VeniceAirport.There are some things I have to tell you about Ms. Brooks.Beside him at the railing, the provost and Dr. Sinskey remained silent butattentive, giving him a moment to get his bearings. What they had told Langdondownstairs had left him so disoriented and upset that Sinskey had brought himoutside for some air.The sea air was bracing, and yet Langdon felt no clearer in his head. All hecould do was stare vacantly down at the churning wake of the ship, trying tofind a shred of logic to what he had just heard.According to the provost, Sienna Brooks and Bertrand Zobrist had been longtimelovers. They were active together in some kind of underground Transhumanistmovement. Her full name was Felicity Sienna Brooks, but she also went by thecode name FS-2080 … which had something to do with her initials, and the year ofher one-hundredth birthday.None of it makes any sense!“I knew Sienna Brooks through a different source,” the provost had told Langdon,“and I trusted her. So, when she came to me last year and asked me to meet awealthy potential client, I agreed. That prospect turned out to be BertrandZobrist. He hired me to provide him a safe haven where he could work undetectedon his ‘masterpiece.’ I assumed he was developing a new technology that hedidn’t want pirated … or maybe he was performing some cutting-edge geneticresearch that was in conflict with the WHO’s ethics regulations … I didn’t askquestions, but believe me, I never imagined he was creating … a plague.”Langdon had only been able to nod vacantly … bewildered.“Zobrist was a Dante fanatic,” the provost continued, “and he therefore choseFlorence as the city in which he wanted to hide. So my organization set him upwith everything he needed—a discreet lab facility with living quarters, variousaliases and secure communication avenues, and a personal attaché who oversaweverything from his security to buying food and supplies. Zobrist never used hisown credit cards or appeared in public, so he was impossible to track. We evenprovided him disguises, aliases, and alternate documentation for travelingunnoticed.” He paused. “Which he apparently did when he placed the Solublonbag.”Sinskey exhaled, making little effort to hide her frustration. “The WHO has beentrying to keep tabs on him since last year, but he seemed to have vanished offthe face of the earth.”“Even hiding from Sienna,” the provost said.“I’m sorry?” Langdon glanced up, clearing the knot in his throat. “I thought yousaid they were lovers?”“They were, but he cut her off suddenly when he went into hiding. Even thoughSienna was the one who sent him to us, my agreement was with Zobrist himself,and part of our deal was that when he disappeared, he would disappear from thewhole world, including Sienna. Apparently after he went into hiding, he sent hera farewell letter revealing that he was very ill, would be dead in a year or so,and didn’t want her to see him deteriorate.”Zobrist abandoned Sienna?“Sienna tried to contact me for information,” the provost said, “but I refusedto take her calls. I had to respect my client’s wishes.”“Two weeks ago,” Sinskey continued, “Zobrist walked into a bank in Florence andanonymously rented a safe-deposit box. After he left, our watch list got wordthat the bank’s new facial-recognition software had identified the disguised manas Bertrand Zobrist. My team flew to Florence and it took a week to locate hissafe house, which was empty, but inside we found evidence that he had createdsome kind of highly contagious pathogen and hidden it somewhere else.”Sinskey paused. “We were desperate to find him. The following morning, beforesunrise, we spotted him walking along the Arno, and we immediately gave chase.That’s when he fled up the Badia tower and jumped to his death.”“He may have been planning to do that anyway,” the provost added. “He wasconvinced he did not have long to live.”“As it turned out,” Sinskey said, “Sienna had been searching for him as well.Somehow, she found out that we had mobilized to Florence, and she tailed ourmovements, thinking we might have located him. Unfortunately, she was there intime to see Zobrist jump.” Sinskey sighed. “I suspect it was very traumatic forher to watch her lover and mentor fall to his death.”Langdon felt ill, barely able to comprehend what they were telling him. The onlyperson in this entire scenario whom he trusted was Sienna, and these people weretelling him that she was not who she claimed to be? No matter what they said, hecould not believe Sienna would condone Zobrist’s desire to create a plague.Or would she?Would you kill half the population today, Sienna had asked him, in order to saveour species from extinction?Langdon felt a chill.“Once Zobrist was dead,” Sinskey explained, “I used my influence to force thebank to open Zobrist’s safe-deposit box, which ironically turned out to containa letter to me … along with a strange little device.”“The projector,” Langdon ventured.“Exactly. His letter said he wanted me to be the first to visit ground zero,which nobody would ever find without following his Map of Hell.”Langdon pictured the modified Botticelli painting that shone out of the tinyprojector.The provost added, “Zobrist had contracted me to deliver to Dr. Sinskey thecontents of the safe-deposit box, but not until after tomorrow morning. When Dr.Sinskey came into possession of it early, we panicked and took action, trying torecover it in accordance with our client’s wishes.”Sinskey looked at Langdon. “I didn’t have much hope of understanding the map intime, so I recruited you to help me. Are you remembering any of this, now?”Langdon shook his head.“We flew you quietly to Florence, where you had made an appointment with someoneyou thought could help.”Ignazio Busoni.“You met with him last night,” Sinskey said, “and then you disappeared. Wethought something had happened to you.”“And in fact,” the provost said, “something did happen to you. In an effort torecover the projector, we had an agent of mine named Vayentha tail you from theairport. She lost you somewhere around the Piazza della Signoria.” He scowled.“Losing you was a critical error. And Vayentha had the nerve to blame it on abird.”“I’m sorry?”“A cooing dove. By Vayentha’s account, she was in perfect position, watching youfrom a darkened alcove, when a group of tourists passed. She said a dovesuddenly cooed loudly from a window box over her head, causing the tourists tostop and block Vayentha in. By the time she could slip back into the alley, youwere gone.” He shook his head in disgust. “Anyway, she lost you for severalhours. Finally, she picked up your trail again—and by this time you had beenjoined by another man.”Ignazio, Langdon thought. He and I must have been exiting the Palazzo Vecchiowith the mask.“She successfully tailed you both in the direction of the Piazza della Signoria,but the two of you apparently saw her and decided to flee, going in separatedirections.”That makes sense, Langdon thought. Ignazio fled with the mask and hid it in thebaptistry before he had a heart attack.“Then Vayentha made a terrible mistake,” the provost said.“She shot me in the head?”“No, she revealed herself too early. She pulled you in for interrogation beforeyou actually knew anything. We needed to know if you had deciphered the map ortold Dr. Sinskey what she needed to know. You refused to say a word. You saidyou would die first.”I was looking for a deadly plague! I probably thought you were mercenarieslooking to obtain a biological weapon!The ship’s massive engines suddenly shifted into reverse, slowing the vessel asit neared the loading dock for the airport. In the distance, Langdon could seethe nondescript hull of a C-130 transport plane fueling. The fuselage bore theinscription WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION.At that moment Brüder arrived, his expression grim. “I’ve just learned that theonly qualified response team within five hours of the site is us, which meanswe’re on our own.”Sinskey slumped. “Coordination with local authorities?”Brüder looked wary. “Not yet. That’s my recommendation. We don’t have an exactlocation at the moment, so there’s nothing they could do. Moreover, acontainment operation is well beyond the scope of their expertise, and we runthe real risk of their doing more damage than good.”“Primum non nocere,” Sinskey whispered with a nod, repeating the fundamentalprecept of medical ethics: First, do no harm.“Lastly,” Brüder said, “we still have no word on Sienna Brooks.” He eyed theprovost. “Do you know if Sienna has contacts in Venice who might assist her?”“It wouldn’t surprise me,” he replied. “Zobrist had disciples everywhere, and ifI know Sienna, she’ll be using all available resources to carry out herdirective.”“You can’t let her get out of Venice,” Sinskey said. “We have no idea whatcondition that Solublon bag is currently in. If anyone discovers it, all thatwould be needed at this point is a slight touch to burst the plastic and releasethe contagion into the water.”There was a moment of silence as the gravity of the situation settled in.“I’m afraid I’ve got more bad news,” Langdon said. “The gilded mouseion of holywisdom.” He paused. “Sienna knows where it is. She knows where we’re going.”“What?!” Sinskey’s voice rose in alarm. “I thought you said you didn’t have achance to tell Sienna what you’d figured out! You said all you told her is thatyou were in the wrong country!”“That’s true,” Langdon said, “but she knew we were looking for the tomb ofEnrico Dandolo. A quick Web search can tell her where that is. And once shefinds Dandolo’s tomb … the dissolving canister can’t be far away. The poem saidto follow the sounds of trickling water to the sunken palace.”“Damn it!” Brüder erupted, and stormed off.“She’ll never beat us there,” the provost said. “We have a head start.” Sinskeysighed heavily. “I wouldn’t be so sure. Our transport is slow, and it appearsSienna Brooks is extremely resourceful.”As The Mendacium docked, Langdon found himself staring uneasily at thecumbersome C-130 on the runway. It barely looked airworthy and had no windows.I’ve been on this thing already? Langdon didn’t remember a thing.Whether it was because of the movement of the docking boat, or growingreservations about the claustrophobic aircraft, Langdon didn’t know, but he wassuddenly hit by an upsurge of nausea.He turned to Sinskey. “I’m not sure I feel well enough to fly.”“You’re fine,” she said. “You’ve been through the wringer today, and of course,you’ve got the toxins in your body.”“Toxins?” Langdon took a wavering step backward. “What are you talking about?”Sinskey glanced away, clearly having said more than she intended.“Professor, I’m sorry. Unfortunately, I’ve just learned that your medicalcondition is a bit more complicated than a simple head wound.”Langdon felt a spike of fear as he pictured the black flesh on Ferris’s chestwhen the man collapsed in the basilica.“What’s wrong with me?” Langdon demanded.Sinskey hesitated, as if uncertain how to proceed. “Let’s get you onto the planefirst.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 81LOCATED JUST EAST of the spectacular Frari church, the Atelier Pietro Longhi hasalways been one of Venice’s premier providers of historical costumes, wigs, andaccessories. Its client list includes film companies and theatrical troupes, aswell as influential members of the public who rely on the staff’s expertise todress them for Carnevale’s most extravagant balls.The clerk was just about to lock up for the evening when the door jingledloudly. He glanced up to see an attractive woman with a blond ponytail comebursting in. She was breathless, as if she’d been running for miles. She hurriedto the counter, her brown eyes wild and desperate.“I want to speak to Giorgio Venci,” she had said, panting.Don’t we all, the clerk thought. But nobody gets to see the wizard.Giorgio Venci—the atelier’s chief designer—worked his magic from behind thecurtain, speaking to clients very rarely and never without an appointment. As aman of great wealth and influence, Giorgio was allowed certain eccentricities,including his passion for solitude. He dined privately, flew privately, andconstantly complained about the rising number of tourists in Venice. He was notone who liked company.“I’m sorry,” the clerk said with a practiced smile. “I’m afraid Signor Venci isnot here. Perhaps I can help you?”“Giorgio’s here,” she declared. “His flat is upstairs. I saw his light on. I’m afriend. It’s an emergency.”There was a burning intensity about the woman. A friend? she claims. “Might Itell Giorgio your name?”The woman took a scrap of paper off the counter and jotted down a series ofletters and numbers.“Just give him this,” she said, handing the clerk the paper. “And please hurry.I don’t have much time.”The clerk hesitantly carried the paper upstairs and laid it on the long alteringtable, where Giorgio was hunched intently at his sewing machine.“Signore,” he whispered. “Someone is here to see you. She says it’s anemergency.”Without breaking off from his work or looking up, the man reached out with onehand and took the paper, reading the text.His sewing machine rattled to a stop.“Send her up immediately,” Giorgio commanded as he tore the paper into tinyshreds."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 82THE MASSIVE C-130 transport plane was still ascending as it banked southeast,thundering out across the Adriatic. On board, Robert Langdon was feelingsimultaneously cramped and adrift—oppressed by the absence of windows in theaircraft and bewildered by all of the unanswered questions swirling around inhis brain.Your medical condition, Sinskey had told him, is a bit more complicated than asimple head wound.Langdon’s pulse quickened at the thought of what she might tell him, and yet atthe moment she was busy discussing containment strategies with the SRS team.Brüder was on the phone nearby, speaking with government agencies about SiennaBrooks, following up on everyone’s attempts to locate her.Sienna …Langdon was still trying to make sense of the claim that she was intricatelyinvolved in all of this. As the plane leveled out from its ascent, the small manwho called himself the provost walked across the cabin and sat down oppositeLangdon. He steepled his fingers beneath his chin and pursed his lips. “Dr.Sinskey asked me to fill you in … make an attempt to bring clarity to yoursituation.”Langdon wondered what this man could possibly say to make any of this confusioneven remotely clear.“As I began to say earlier,” the provost said, “much of this started after myagent Vayentha pulled you in prematurely. We had no idea how much progress youhad made on Dr. Sinskey’s behalf, or how much you had shared with her. But wewere afraid if she learned the location of the project our client had hired usto protect, she was going to confiscate or destroy it. We had to find it beforeshe did, and so we needed you to work on our behalf … rather than on Sinskey’s.”The provost paused, tapping his fingertips together. “Unfortunately, we hadalready shown our cards … and you most certainly did not trust us.”“So you shot me in the head?” Langdon replied angrily.“We came up with a plan to make you trust us.”Langdon felt lost. “How do you make someone trust you … after you’ve kidnappedand interrogated him?”The man shifted uncomfortably now. “Professor, are you familiar with the familyof chemicals known as benzodiazepines?”Langdon shook his head.“They are a breed of pharmaceutical that are used for, among other things, thetreatment of post-traumatic stress. As you may know, when someone endures ahorrific event like a car accident or a sexual assault, the long-term memoriescan be permanently debilitating. Through the use of benzodiazepines,neuroscientists are now able to treat post-traumatic stress, as it were, beforeit happens.”Langdon listened in silence, unable to imagine where this conversation might begoing.“When new memories are formed,” the provost continued, “those events are storedin your short-term memory for about forty-eight hours before they migrate toyour long-term memory. Using new blends of benzodiazepines, one can easilyrefresh the short-term memory … essentially deleting its content before thoserecent memories migrate, so to speak, into long-term memories. A victim ofassault, for example, if administered a benzodiazepine within a few hours afterthe attack, can have those memories expunged forever, and the trauma neverbecomes part of her psyche. The only downside is that she loses all recollectionof several days of her life.”Langdon stared at the tiny man in disbelief. “You gave me amnesia!”The provost let out an apologetic sigh. “I’m afraid so. Chemically induced. Verysafe. But yes, a deletion of your short-term memory.” He paused. “While you wereout, you mumbled something about a plague, which we assumed was on account ofyour viewing the projector images. We never imagined that Zobrist had created areal plague.” He paused. “You also kept mumbling a phrase that sounded to uslike ‘Very sorry. Very sorry.’ ”Vasari. It must have been all he had figured out about the projector at thatpoint. Cerca trova. “But … I thought my amnesia was caused by my head wound.Somebody shot me.”The provost shook his head. “Nobody shot you, Professor. There was no headwound.”“What?!” Langdon’s fingers groped instinctively for the stitches and the swolleninjury on the back of his head. “Then what the hell is this!” He raised his hairto reveal the shaved area.“Part of the illusion. We made a small incision in your scalp and thenimmediately closed it up with stitches. You had to believe you had beenattacked.”This isn’t a bullet wound?!“When you woke up,” the provost said, “we wanted you to believe that people weretrying to kill you … that you were in peril.”“People were trying to kill me!” Langdon shouted, his outburst drawing gazesfrom elsewhere in the plane. “I saw the hospital’s doctor—Dr. Marconi—gunneddown in cold blood!”“That’s what you saw,” the provost said evenly, “but that’s not what happened.Vayentha worked for me. She had a superb skill set for this kind of work.”“Killing people?” Langdon demanded.“No,” the provost said calmly. “Pretending to kill people.”Langdon stared at the man for a long moment, picturing the gray-bearded doctorwith the bushy eyebrows who had collapsed on the floor, blood gushing from hischest.“Vayentha’s gun was loaded with blanks,” the provost said. “It triggered aradio-controlled squib that detonated a blood pack on Dr. Marconi’s chest. He isfine, by the way.”Langdon closed his eyes, dumbstruck by what he was hearing. “And the … hospitalroom?”“A quickly improvised set,” the provost said. “Professor, I know this is allvery difficult to absorb. We were working quickly, and you were groggy, so itdidn’t need to be perfect. When you woke up, you saw what we wanted you tosee—hospital props, a few actors, and a choreographed attack scene.”Langdon was reeling.“This is what my company does,” the provost said. “We’re very good at creatingillusions.”“What about Sienna?” Langdon asked, rubbing his eyes.“I needed to make a judgment call, and I chose to work with her. My priority wasto protect my client’s project from Dr. Sinskey, and Sienna and I shared thatdesire. To gain your trust, Sienna saved you from the assassin and helped youescape into a rear alleyway. The waiting taxi was also ours, with anotherradio-controlled squib on the rear windshield to create the final effect as youfled. The taxi took you to an apartment that we had hastily put together.”Sienna’s meager apartment, Langdon thought, now understanding why it looked likeit had been furnished from a yard sale. And it also explained the convenientcoincidence of Sienna’s “neighbor” having clothing that fit him perfectly.The entire thing had been staged.Even the desperate phone call from Sienna’s friend at the hospital had beenphony. Sienna, eez Danikova!“When you phoned the U.S. Consulate,” the provost said, “you phoned a numberthat Sienna looked up for you. It was a number that rang on The Mendacium.”“I never reached the consulate …”“No, you didn’t.”Stay where you are, the fake consulate employee had urged him. I’ll send someonefor you right away. Then, when Vayentha showed up, Sienna had convenientlyspotted her across the street and connected the dots. Robert, your owngovernment is trying to kill you! You can’t involve any authorities! Your onlyhope is to figure out what that projector means.The provost and his mysterious organization—whatever the hell it was—hadeffectively retasked Langdon to stop working for Sinskey and start working forthem. Their illusion was complete.Sienna played me perfectly, he thought, feeling more sad than angry. He hadgrown fond of her in the short time they’d been together. Most troubling toLangdon was the distressing question of how a soul as bright and warm asSienna’s could give itself over entirely to Zobrist’s maniacal solution foroverpopulation.I can tell you without a doubt, Sienna had said to him earlier, that withoutsome kind of drastic change, the end of our species is coming … The mathematicsis indisputable.“And the articles about Sienna?” Langdon asked, recalling the Shakespeareplaybill and the pieces about her staggeringly high IQ.“Authentic,” the provost replied. “The best illusions involve as much of thereal world as possible. We didn’t have much time to set up, and so Sienna’scomputer and real-world personal files were almost all we had to work with. Youwere never really intended to see any of that unless you began doubting herauthenticity.”“Nor use her computer,” Langdon said.“Yes, that was where we lost control. Sienna never expected Sinskey’s SRS teamto find the apartment, so when the soldiers moved in, Sienna panicked and had toimprovise. She fled on the moped with you, trying to keep the illusion alive. Asthe entire mission unraveled, I had no choice but to disavow Vayentha, althoughshe broke protocol and pursued you.”“She almost killed me,” Langdon said, recounting for the provost the showdown inthe attic of the Palazzo Vecchio, when Vayentha raised her handgun and aimedpoint-blank at Langdon’s chest. This will only hurt for an instant … but it’s myonly choice. Sienna had then darted out and pushed her over the railing, whereVayentha plunged to her death.The provost sighed audibly, considering what Langdon had just said. “I doubtVayentha was trying to kill you … her gun fires only blanks. Her only hope ofredemption at that point was to take control of you. She probably thought if sheshot you with a blank, she could make you understand she was not an assassinafter all and that you were caught up in an illusion.”The provost paused, thinking a bit, and then continued. “Whether Sienna actuallymeant to kill Vayentha or was only trying to interfere with the shot, I won’tventure to guess. I’m beginning to realize that I don’t know Sienna Brooks aswell as I thought.”Me neither, Langdon agreed, although as he recalled the look of shock andremorse on the young woman’s face, he sensed that what she had done to thespike-haired operative was very likely a mistake.Langdon felt unmoored … and utterly alone. He turned toward the window, longingto gaze out at the world below, but all he could see was the wall of thefuselage.I’ve got to get out of here.“Are you okay?” the provost asked, eyeing Langdon with concern.“No,” Langdon replied. “Not even close.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]He’ll survive, the provost thought. He’s merely trying to process his newreality.The American professor looked as if he had just been snatched up off the groundby a tornado, spun around, and dumped in a foreign land, leaving himshell-shocked and disoriented.Individuals targeted by the Consortium seldom realized the truth behind thestaged events they had witnessed, and if they did, the provost certainly wasnever present to view the aftermath. Today, in addition to the guilt he felt atseeing firsthand Langdon’s bewilderment, the man was burdened by an overwhelmingsense of responsibility for the current crisis.I accepted the wrong client. Bertrand Zobrist.I trusted the wrong person. Sienna Brooks.Now the provost was flying toward the eye of the storm—the epicenter of whatmight well be a deadly plague that had the potential to wreak havoc across theentire world. If he emerged alive from all this, he suspected that hisConsortium would never survive the fallout. There would be endless inquiries andaccusations.Is this how it all ends for me?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 83I NEED AIR, Robert Langdon thought. A vista … anything.The windowless fuselage felt as if it were closing in around him. Of course, thestrange tale of what had actually happened to him today was not helping at all.His brain throbbed with unanswered questions … most of them about Sienna.Strangely, he missed her.She was acting, he reminded himself. Using me.Without a word, Langdon left the provost and walked toward the front of theplane. The cockpit door was open, and the natural light streaming through itpulled him like a beacon. Standing in the doorway, undetected by the pilots,Langdon let the sunlight warm his face. The wide-open space before him felt likemanna from heaven. The clear blue sky looked so peaceful … so permanent.Nothing is permanent, he reminded himself, still struggling to accept thepotential catastrophe they were facing.“Professor?” a quiet voice said behind him, and he turned.Langdon took a startled step backward. Standing before him was Dr. Ferris. Thelast time Langdon had seen the man, he was writhing on the floor of St. Mark’sBasilica, unable to breathe. Now here he was in the aircraft leaning against thebulkhead, wearing a baseball cap, his face, covered in calamine lotion, a pastypink. His chest and torso were heavily bandaged, and his breathing was shallow.If Ferris had the plague, nobody seemed too concerned that he was going tospread it.“You’re … alive?” Langdon said, staring at the man.Ferris gave a tired nod. “More or less.” The man’s demeanor had changeddramatically, seeming far more relaxed.“But I thought—” Langdon stopped. “Actually … I’m not sure what to thinkanymore.”Ferris gave him an empathetic smile. “You’ve heard a lot of lies today. Ithought I’d take a moment to apologize. As you may have guessed, I don’t workfor the WHO, and I didn’t go to recruit you in Cambridge.”Langdon nodded, too tired to be surprised by anything at this point. “You workfor the provost.”“I do. He sent me in to offer emergency field support to you and Sienna … andhelp you escape the SRS team.”“Then I guess you did your job perfectly,” Langdon said, recalling how Ferrishad shown up at the baptistry, convinced Langdon he was a WHO employee, and thenfacilitated his and Sienna’s transportation out of Florence and away fromSinskey’s team. “Obviously you’re not a doctor.”The man shook his head. “No, but I played that part today. My job was to helpSienna keep the illusion going so you could figure out where the projector waspointing. The provost was intent on finding Zobrist’s creation so he couldprotect it from Sinskey.”“You had no idea it was a plague?” Langdon said, still curious about Ferris’sstrange rash and internal bleeding.“Of course not! When you mentioned the plague, I figured it was just a storySienna had told you to keep you motivated. So I played along. I got us all ontothe train to Venice … and then, everything changed.”“How so?”“The provost saw Zobrist’s bizarre video.”That could do it. “He realized Zobrist was a madman.”“Exactly. The provost suddenly comprehended what the Consortium had beeninvolved in, and he was horrified. He immediately demanded to speak to theperson who knew Zobrist best—FS-2080—to see if she knew what Zobrist had done.”“FS-2080?”“Sorry, Sienna Brooks. That was the code name she chose for this operation. It’sapparently a Transhumanist thing. And the provost had no way to reach Siennaexcept through me.”“The phone call on the train,” Langdon said. “Your ‘ailing mother.’ ”“Well, I obviously couldn’t take the provost’s call in front of you, so Istepped out. He told me about the video, and I was terrified. He was hopingSienna had been duped as well, but when I told him you and Sienna had beentalking about plagues and seemed to have no intention of breaking off themission, he knew Sienna and Zobrist were in this together. Sienna instantlybecame an adversary. He told me to keep him abreast of our position in Venice …and that he was sending in a team to detain her. Agent Brüder’s team almost hadher at St. Mark’s Basilica … but she managed to escape.”Langdon stared blankly at the floor, still able to see Sienna’s pretty browneyes gazing down at him before she fled.I’m so sorry, Robert. For everything.“She’s tough,” the man said. “You probably didn’t see her attack me at thebasilica.”“Attack you?”“Yes, when the soldiers entered, I was about to shout out and reveal Sienna’slocation, but she must have sensed it coming. She drove the heel of her handstraight into the center of my chest.”“What?!”“I didn’t know what hit me. Some kind of martial-arts move, I guess. Because Iwas already badly bruised there, the pain was excruciating. It took me fiveminutes to get my wind back. Sienna dragged you out onto the balcony before anywitnesses could reveal what had happened.”Stunned, Langdon thought back to the elderly Italian woman who had shouted atSienna—“L’hai colpito al petto!”—and made a forceful motion of her fist on herown chest.I can’t! Sienna had replied. CPR will kill him! Look at his chest!As Langdon replayed the scene in his mind, he realized just how quickly SiennaBrooks thought on her feet. Sienna had cleverly mistranslated the old woman’sItalian. L’hai colpito al petto was not a suggestion that Sienna apply chestcompressions … it was an angry accusation: You punched him in the chest!With all the chaos of the moment, Langdon had not even noticed.Ferris gave him a pained smile. “As you may have heard, Sienna Brooks is prettysharp.”Langdon nodded. I’ve heard.“Sinskey’s men brought me back to The Mendacium and bandaged me up. The provostasked me to come along for intel support because I’m the only person other thanyou who spent time with Sienna today.”Langdon nodded, distracted by the man’s rash. “Your face?” Langdon asked. “Andthe bruise on your chest? It’s not …”“The plague?” Ferris laughed and shook his head. “I’m not sure if you’ve beentold yet, but I actually played the part of two doctors today.”“I’m sorry?”“When I showed up at the baptistry, you said I looked vaguely familiar.”“You did. Vaguely. Your eyes, I think. You told me that’s because you were theone who recruited me in Cambridge …” Langdon paused. “Which I know now isuntrue, so …”“I looked familiar because we had already met. But not in Cambridge.” The man’seyes probed Langdon’s for any hint of recognition. “I was actually the firstperson you saw when you woke up this morning in the hospital.”Langdon pictured the grim little hospital room. He had been groggy and hiseyesight was compromised, so he was pretty certain that the first person he sawwhen he awoke was a pale, older doctor with bushy eyebrows and a shaggy grayingbeard who spoke only Italian.“No,” Langdon said. “Dr. Marconi was the first person I saw when—”“Scusi, professore,” the man interrupted with a flawless Italian accent. “Ma nonsi ricorda di me?” He hunched over like an older man, smoothing back imaginarybushy eyebrows and stroking a nonexistent graying beard. “Sono il dottorMarconi.”Langdon’s mouth fell open. “Dr. Marconi was … you?”“That’s why my eyes looked familiar. I had never worn a fake beard and eyebrows,and unfortunately had no idea until it was too late that I was severely allergicto the bonding cement—a latex spirit gum—which left my skin raw and burning. I’msure you were horrified when you saw me … considering you were on alert for apossible plague.”Langdon could only stare, recalling now how Dr. Marconi had scratched at hisbeard before Vayentha’s attack left him lying on the hospital floor, bleedingfrom the chest.“To make matters worse,” the man said, motioning to the bandages around hischest, “my squib shifted while the operation was already under way. I couldn’tget it back into position in time, and when it detonated, it was at an angle.Broke a rib and left me badly bruised. I’ve been having trouble breathing allday.”And here I thought you had the plague.The man inhaled deeply and winced. “In fact, I think it’s time for me to sitdown again.” As he departed, he motioned behind Langdon. “It looks like you havecompany anyway.”Langdon turned to see Dr. Sinskey striding up the cabin, her long silver hairstreaming behind her. “Professor, there you are!”The director of the WHO looked exhausted, and yet strangely, Langdon detected afresh glint of hope in her eyes. She’s found something.“I’m sorry to have left you,” Sinskey said, arriving beside Langdon. “We’ve beencoordinating and doing some research.” She motioned to the open cockpit door. “Isee you’re getting some sunlight?”Langdon shrugged. “Your plane needs windows.”She gave him a compassionate smile. “On the topic of light, I hope the provostwas able to shed some for you on recent events?”“Yes, although nothing I’m pleased about.”“Nor I,” she concurred, glancing around to make sure they were alone. “Trustme,” she whispered, “there will be serious ramifications for him and for hisorganization. I will see to it. At the moment, however, we all need to remainfocused on locating that container before it dissolves and the contagion isreleased.”Or before Sienna gets there and helps it dissolve.“I need to talk to you about the building that houses Dandolo’s tomb.”Langdon had been picturing the spectacular structure ever since he realized itwas their destination. The mouseion of holy wisdom.“I just learned something exciting,” Sinskey said. “We’ve been on the phone witha local historian,” she said. “He has no idea why we’re inquiring aboutDandolo’s tomb, of course, but I asked him if he had any idea what was beneaththe tomb, and guess what he said.” She smiled. “Water.”Langdon was surprised. “Really?”“Yes, it sounds like the building’s lower levels are flooded. Over the centuriesthe water table beneath the building has risen, submerging at least two lowerlevels. He said there are definitely all kinds of air pockets and partiallysubmerged spaces down there.”My God. Langdon pictured Zobrist’s video and the strangely lit undergroundcavern on whose mossy walls he had seen the faint vertical shadows of pillars.“It’s a submerged room.”“Exactly.”“But then … how did Zobrist get down there?”Sinskey’s eyes twinkled. “That’s the amazing part. You won’t believe what wejust discovered.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]At that moment, less than a mile off the coast of Venice, on the slender islandknown as the Lido, a sleek Cessna Citation Mustang lifted off the tarmac ofNicelli Airport and streaked into the darkening twilight sky.The jet’s owner, prominent costume designer Giorgio Venci, was not on board, buthe had ordered his pilots to take their attractive young passenger wherever sheneeded to go."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 84NIGHT HAD FALLEN on the ancient Byzantine capital.All along the banks of the Sea of Marmara, floodlights flickered to life,illuminating a skyline of glistening mosques and slender minarets. This was thehour of the akşam, and loudspeakers across the city reverberated with thehaunting intonations of the adhān, the call to prayer.La-ilaha-illa-Allah.There is no god but the God.While the faithful scurried to mosques, the rest of the city carried on withouta glance; raucous university students drank beer, businessmen closed deals,merchants hawked spices and rugs, and tourists watched it all in wonder.This was a world divided, a city of opposing forces—religious, secular; ancient,modern; Eastern, Western. Straddling the geographic boundary between Europe andAsia, this timeless city was quite literally the bridge from the Old World … toa world that was even older.Istanbul.While no longer the capital of Turkey, it had served over the centuries as theepicenter of three distinct empires—the Byzantine, the Roman, and the Ottoman.For this reason, Istanbul was arguably one of the most historically diverselocations on earth. From Topkapi Palace to the Blue Mosque to the Castle of theSeven Towers, the city is teeming with folkloric tales of battle, glory, anddefeat.Tonight, high in the night sky above its bustling masses, a C-130 transportplane was descending through a gathering storm front, on final approach toAtatürk Airport. Inside the cockpit, buckled into the jump seat behind thepilots, Robert Langdon peered out through the windshield, relieved that he hadbeen offered a seat with a view.He was feeling somewhat refreshed after having had something to eat and thendozing at the rear of the plane for nearly an hour of much-needed rest.Now, off to his right, Langdon could see the lights of Istanbul, a glistening,horn-shaped peninsula jutting into the blackness of the Sea of Marmara. This wasthe European side, separated from its Asian sister by a sinuous ribbon ofdarkness.The Bosporus waterway.At a glance, the Bosporus appeared as a wide gash that severed Istanbul in two.In fact, Langdon knew the channel was the lifeblood of Istanbul’s commerce. Inaddition to providing the city with two coastlines rather than one, the Bosporusenabled ship passage from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea, allowing Istanbulto serve as a way station between two worlds.As the plane descended through a layer of mist, Langdon’s eyes intently scannedthe distant city, trying to catch a glimpse of the massive building they hadcome to search.The site of Enrico Dandolo’s tomb.As it turned out, Enrico Dandolo—the treacherous doge of Venice—had not beenburied in Venice; rather, his remains had been interred in the heart of thestronghold he had conquered in 1202 … the sprawling city beneath them.Fittingly, Dandolo had been laid to rest in the most spectacular shrine hiscaptured city had to offer—a building that to this day remained the crown jewelof the region.Hagia Sophia.Originally built in A.D. 360, Hagia Sophia had served as an Eastern Orthodoxcathedral until 1204, when Enrico Dandolo and the Fourth Crusade conquered thecity and turned it into a Catholic church. Later, in the fifteenth century,following the conquest of Constantinople by Fatih Sultan Mehmed, it had become amosque, remaining an Islamic house of worship until 1935, when the building wassecularized and became a museum.A gilded mouseion of holy wisdom, Langdon thought.Not only was Hagia Sophia adorned with more gold tile than St. Mark’s, itsname—Hagia Sophia—literally meant “Holy Wisdom.”Langdon pictured the colossal building and tried to fathom the fact thatsomewhere beneath it, a darkened lagoon contained a tethered, undulating sac,hovering underwater, slowly dissolving and preparing to release its contents.Langdon prayed they were not too late.“The building’s lower levels are flooded,” Sinskey had announced earlier in theflight, excitedly motioning for Langdon to follow her back to her work area.“You won’t believe what we just discovered. Have you ever heard of a documentaryfilm director named Göksel Gülensoy?”Langdon shook his head.“While I was researching Hagia Sophia,” Sinskey explained, “I discovered that afilm had been made about it. A documentary made by Gülensoy a few years back.”“Dozens of films have been made about Hagia Sophia.”“Yes,” she said, arriving at her work area, “but none like this.” She spun herlaptop so he could see it. “Read this.”Langdon sat down and eyed the article—a composite of various news sourcesincluding the Hürriyet Daily News—discussing Gülensoy’s newest film: In theDepths of Hagia Sophia.As Langdon began to read, he immediately realized why Sinskey was excited. Thefirst two words alone made Langdon glance up at her in surprise. Scuba diving?“I know,” she said. “Just read.”Langdon turned his eyes back to the article.SCUBA DIVING BENEATH HAGIA SOPHIA: Documentary filmmaker Göksel Gülensoy and hisexploratory scuba team have located remote flooded basins lying hundreds of feetbeneath Istanbul’s heavily touristed religious structure.In the process, they discovered numerous architectural wonders, including the800-year-old submerged graves of martyred children, as well as submerged tunnelsconnecting Hagia Sophia to Topkapi Palace, Tekfur Palace, and the rumoredsubterranean extensions of the Anemas Dungeons.“I believe what is beneath Hagia Sophia is much more exciting than what is abovethe surface,” Gülensoy explained, describing how he had been inspired to makethe film after seeing an old photograph of researchers examining the foundationsof Hagia Sophia by boat, paddling through a large, partially submerged hall.“You’ve obviously found the right building!” Sinskey exclaimed. “And it soundslike there are huge pockets of navigable space beneath that building, many ofthem accessible without scuba gear … which may explain what we’re seeing inZobrist’s video.”Agent Brüder stood behind them, studying the laptop screen. “It also sounds likethe waterways beneath the building spider outward to all kinds of other areas.If that Solublon bag dissolves before we arrive, there will be no way to stopthe contents from spreading.”“The contents …” Langdon ventured. “Do you have any idea what it is? I meanexactly? I know we’re dealing with a pathogen, but—”“We’ve been analyzing the footage,” Brüder said, “which suggests that it’sindeed biological rather than chemical … that is to say, something living.Considering the small amount in the bag, we assume it’s highly contagious andhas the ability to replicate. Whether it’s a waterborne contagion like abacterium, or whether it has the potential to go airborne like a virus once it’sreleased, we’re not sure, but either is possible.”Sinskey said, “We’re now gathering data on water-table temperatures in the area,trying to assess what kinds of contagious substances might thrive in thosesubterranean areas, but Zobrist was exceptionally talented and easily could haveengineered something with unique capabilities. And I have to suspect that therewas a reason Zobrist chose this location.”Brüder gave a resigned nod and quickly relayed his assessment of the unusualdispersal mechanism—the submerged Solublon bag—the simple brilliance of whichwas just starting to dawn on them all. By suspending the bag underground andunderwater, Zobrist had created an exceptionally stable incubation environment:one with consistent water temperature, no solar radiation, a kinetic buffer, andtotal privacy. By choosing a bag of the correct durability, Zobrist could leavethe contagion unattended to mature for a specific duration before itself-released on schedule.Even if Zobrist never returned to the site.The sudden jolt of the plane touching down jarred Langdon back to his jump seatin the cockpit. The pilots braked hard and then taxied to a remote hangar, wherethey brought the massive plane to a stop.Langdon half expected to be greeted by an army of WHO employees in hazmat suits.Strangely, the only party awaiting their arrival was the driver of a large whitevan that bore the emblem of a bright red, equal-armed cross.The Red Cross is here? Langdon looked again, realizing it was the other entitythat used the red cross. The Swiss embassy.He unbuckled and located Sinskey as everyone prepared to deplane. “Where iseveryone?” Langdon demanded. “The WHO team? The Turkish authorities? Is everyonealready over at Hagia Sophia?”Sinskey gave him an uneasy glance. “Actually,” she explained, “we have decidedagainst alerting local authorities. We already have the ECDC’s finest SRS teamwith us, and it seems preferable to keep this a quiet operation for the moment,rather than creating a possible widespread panic.”Nearby, Langdon could see Brüder and his team zipping up large black duffel bagsthat contained all kinds of hazmat gear—biosuits, respirators, and electronicdetection equipment.Brüder heaved his bag over his shoulder and came over. “We’re a go. We’ll enterthe building, find Dandolo’s tomb, listen for water as the poem suggests, andthen my team and I will reassess and decide whether to call in other authoritiesfor support.”Langdon already saw problems with the plan. “Hagia Sophia closes at sunset, sowithout local authorities, we can’t even get in.”“We’re fine,” Sinskey said. “I have a contact in the Swiss embassy who contactedthe Hagia Sophia Museum curator and asked for a private VIP tour as soon as wearrive. The curator agreed.”Langdon almost laughed out loud. “A VIP tour for the director of the WorldHealth Organization? And an army of soldiers carrying hazmat duffels? You don’tthink that might raise a few eyebrows?”“The SRS team and gear will stay in the car while Brüder, you, and I assess thesituation,” Sinskey said. “Also, for the record, I’m not the VIP. You are.”“I beg your pardon?!”“We told the museum that a famous American professor had flown in with aresearch team to write an article on the symbols of Hagia Sofia, but their planewas delayed five hours and he missed his window to see the building. Since heand his team were leaving tomorrow morning, we were hoping—”“Okay,” Langdon said. “I get the gist.”“The museum is sending an employee to meet us there personally. As it turns out,he’s a big fan of your writings on Islamic art.” Sinskey gave him a tired smile,clearly trying to look optimistic. “We’ve been assured that you’ll have accessto every corner of the building.”“And more important,” Brüder declared, “we’ll have the entire place toourselves.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 85ROBERT LANGDON GAZED blankly out the window of the van as it sped along thewaterfront highway connecting Atatürk Airport to the center of Istanbul. TheSwiss officials had somehow facilitated a modified customs process, and Langdon,Sinskey, and the others in the group had been en route in a matter of minutes.Sinskey had ordered the provost and Ferris to remain aboard the C-130 withseveral WHO staff members and to continue trying to track the whereabouts ofSienna Brooks.While nobody truly believed Sienna could reach Istanbul in time, there werefears she might phone one of Zobrist’s disciples in Turkey and ask forassistance in realizing Zobrist’s delusional plan before Sinskey’s team couldinterfere.Would Sienna really commit mass murder? Langdon was still struggling to acceptall that had happened today. It pained him to do so, but he was forced to acceptthe truth. You never knew her, Robert. She played you.A light rain had begun to fall over the city, and Langdon felt suddenly weary ashe listened to the repetitive swish of the windshield wipers. To his right, outon the Sea of Marmara, he could see the running lights of luxury yachts andmassive tankers powering to and from the city port up ahead. All along thewaterfront, illuminated minarets rose slender and elegant above their domedmosques, silent reminders that while Istanbul was a modern, secular city, itscore was grounded in religion.Langdon had always found this ten-mile strip of highway one of the prettiestdrives in Europe. A perfect example of Istanbul’s clash of old and new, the roadfollowed part of Constantine’s wall, which had been built more than sixteencenturies before the birth of the man for whom this avenue was now named—John F.Kennedy. The U.S. president had been a great admirer of Kemal Atatürk’s visionfor a Turkish republic springing from the ashes of a fallen empire.Providing unparalleled views of the sea, Kennedy Avenue wound throughspectacular groves and historic parks, past the harbor in Yenikapi, andeventually threaded its way between the city limits and the Strait of Bosporus,where it continued northward all the way around the Golden Horn. There, highabove the city, rose the Ottoman stronghold of Topkapi Palace. With itsstrategic view of the Bosporus waterway, the palace was a favorite amongtourists, who visited to admire both the vistas and the staggering collection ofOttoman treasure that included the cloak and sword said to have belonged to theProphet Muhammad himself.We won’t be going that far, Langdon knew, picturing their destination, HagiaSophia, which rose out of the city center not far ahead.As they pulled off Kennedy Avenue and began snaking into the densely populatedcity, Langdon stared out at the crowds of people on the streets and sidewalksand felt haunted by the day’s conversations.Overpopulation.The plague.Zobrist’s twisted aspirations.Even though Langdon had understood all along exactly where this SRS mission washeaded, he had not fully processed it until this moment. We are going to groundzero. He pictured the slowly dissolving bag of yellow-brown fluid and wonderedhow he had let himself get into this position.The strange poem that Langdon and Sienna had unveiled on the back of Dante’sdeath mask had eventually guided him here, to Istanbul. Langdon had directed theSRS team to Hagia Sophia, and knew there would be more to do once they arrived.Kneel within the gilded mouseion of holy wisdom,and place thine ear to the ground,listening for the sounds of trickling water.Follow deep into the sunken palace …for here, in the darkness, the chthonic monster waits,submerged in the bloodred waters …of the lagoon that reflects no stars.Langdon again felt troubled to know that the final canto of Dante’s Infernoended in a nearly identical scene: After a long descent through the underworld,Dante and Virgil reach the lowest point of hell. Here, with no way out, theyhear the sounds of trickling water running through stones beneath them, and theyfollow the rivulet through cracks and crevices … ultimately finding safety.Dante wrote: “A place is there below … which not by sight is known, but by thesound of a rivulet, which descends along the hollow of a rock … and by thathidden way, my guide and I did enter, to return to the fair world.”Dante’s scene had clearly been the inspiration for Zobrist’s poem, although inthis case, it seemed Zobrist had flipped everything upside down. Langdon and theothers would indeed be following the sounds of trickling water, but unlikeDante, they would not be heading away from the inferno … but directly into it.As the van maneuvered through tighter streets and more densely populatedneighborhoods, Langdon began to grasp the perverse logic that had led Zobrist tochoose downtown Istanbul as the epicenter of a pandemic.East meets West.The crossroads of the world.Istanbul had, at numerous times in history, succumbed to deadly plagues thatkilled off enormous portions of its population. In fact, during the final phaseof the Black Death, this very city had been called the “plague hub” of theempire, and the disease was said to have killed more than ten thousand residentsa day. Several famous Ottoman paintings depicted townspeople desperately diggingplague pits to bury mounds of corpses in the nearby fields of Taksim.Langdon hoped Karl Marx was wrong when he said, “History repeats itself.”All along the rainy streets, unsuspecting souls were bustling about theirevening’s business. A pretty Turkish woman called her children in to dinner; twoold men shared a drink at an outdoor café; a well-dressed couple walked hand inhand beneath an umbrella; and a tuxedoed man leaped off a bus and ran down thestreet, sheltering his violin case beneath his jacket, apparently late for aconcert.Langdon found himself studying the faces around him, trying to imagine theintricacies of each person’s life.The masses are made up of individuals.He closed his eyes, turning from the window and trying to abandon the morbidturn his thoughts had taken. But the damage was done. In the darkness of hismind, an unwanted image materialized—the desolate landscape of Bruegel’s Triumphof Death—a hideous panorama of pestilence, misery, and torture laying ruin to aseaside city.The van turned to the right onto Torun Avenue, and for a moment Langdon thoughtthey had arrived at their destination. On his left, rising out of the mist, agreat mosque appeared.But it was not Hagia Sophia.The Blue Mosque, he quickly realized, spotting the building’s six fluted,pencil-shaped minarets, which had multiple şerefe balconies and climbed skywardto end in piercing spires. Langdon had once read that the exotic, fairy-talequality of the Blue Mosque’s balconied minarets had inspired the design forCinderella’s iconic castle at Disney World. The Blue Mosque drew its name fromthe dazzling sea of blue tiles that adorned its interior walls.We’re close, Langdon thought as the van sped onward, turning onto KabasakalAvenue and running along the expansive plaza of Sultanahmet Park, which wassituated halfway between the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia and famous for itsviews of both.Langdon squinted through the rain-swept windshield, searching the horizon forthe outline of Hagia Sofia, but the rain and headlights made visibilitydifficult. Worse still, traffic along the avenue seemed to have stopped.Up ahead, Langdon saw nothing but a line of glowing brake lights.“An event of some sort,” the driver announced. “A concert, I think. It may befaster on foot.”“How far?” Sinskey demanded.“Just through the park here. Three minutes. Very safe.”Sinskey nodded to Brüder and then turned to the SRS team. “Stay in the van. Getas close as you can to the building. Agent Brüder will be in touch very soon.”With that, Sinskey, Brüder, and Langdon jumped out of the van into the streetand headed across the park.The broad-leaved trees in Sultanahmet Park offered a bit of cover from theworsening weather as the group hurried along its canopied paths. The walkwayswere dotted with signage directing visitors to the park’s many attractions—anEgyptian obelisk from Luxor, the Serpent Column from the Temple of Apollo atDelphi, and the Milion Column that once served as the “point zero” from whichall distances were measured in the Byzantine Empire.Finally, they emerged from the trees at the foot of a circular reflecting poolthat marked the center of the park. Langdon stepped into the opening and raisedhis eyes to the east.Hagia Sophia.Not so much a building … as a mountain.Glistening in the rain, the colossal silhouette of Hagia Sophia appeared to be acity unto itself. Its central dome—impossibly broad and ribbed in silvergray—seemed to rest upon a conglomeration of other domed buildings that had beenpiled up around it. Four towering minarets—each with a single balcony and asilver-gray spire—rose from the corners of the building, so far from the centraldome that one could barely determine that they were part of a single structure.Sinskey and Brüder, who until this point had been maintaining a steady focusedjog, both pulled up suddenly, their eyes craning upward … upward … as theirminds struggled to absorb the full height and breadth of the structure loomingbefore them.“Dear God.” Brüder let out a soft groan of disbelief. “We’re going to besearching … that?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 86I’M BEING HELD captive, the provost sensed as he paced the interior of theparked C-130 transport plane. He had agreed to go to Istanbul to help Sinskeyavert this crisis before it went completely out of control.Not lost on the provost was the fact that cooperating with Sinskey might helpmitigate any punitive backlash he might suffer for his inadvertent involvementin this crisis. But now Sinskey has me in custody.As soon as the plane had parked inside the government hangar at Atatürk Airport,Sinskey and her team had deplaned, and the head of the WHO ordered the provostand his few Consortium staff members to stay aboard.The provost had attempted to step outside for a breath of air but had beenblocked by the stone-faced pilots, who reminded him that Dr. Sinskey hadrequested that everyone remain aboard.Not good, the provost thought, taking a seat as the uncertainty of his futuretruly began to settle in.The provost had long been accustomed to being the puppet master, the ultimateforce that pulled the strings, and yet suddenly all of his power had beensnatched from him.Zobrist, Sienna, Sinskey.They had all defied him … manipulated him even.Now, trapped in the strange windowless holding cell of the WHO’s transport jet,he began to wonder if his luck had run out … if his current situation might be akind of karmic retribution for a lifetime of dishonesty.I lie for a living.I am a purveyor of disinformation.While the provost was not the only one selling lies in this world, he hadestablished himself as the biggest fish in the pond. The smaller fish were adifferent breed altogether, and the provost disliked even to be associated withthem.Available online, businesses with names like the Alibi Company and Alibi Networkmade fortunes all over the world by providing unfaithful spouses with a way tocheat and not get caught. Promising to briefly “stop time” so their clientscould slip away from husband, wife, or kids, these organizations were masters atcreating illusions—fake business conventions, fake doctor’s appointments, evenfake weddings—all of which included phony invitations, brochures, plane tickets,hotel confirmation forms, and even special contact numbers that rang at AlibiCompany switchboards, where trained professionals pretended to be whateverreceptionist or contact the illusion required.The provost, however, had never wasted his time with such petty artifice. Hedealt solely with large-scale deception, plying his trade for those who couldafford to pay millions of dollars in order to receive the best service.Governments.Major corporations.The occasional ultrawealthy VIP.To achieve their goals, these clients would have at their disposal all of theConsortium’s assets, personnel, experience, and creativity. Above all, though,they were given deniability—the assurance that whatever illusion was fabricatedin support of their deception could never be traced to them.Whether trying to prop up a stock market, justify a war, win an election, orlure a terrorist out of hiding, the world’s power brokers relied on massivedisinformation schemes to help shape public perception.It had always been this way.In the sixties, the Russians built an entire fake spy network that dead-droppedbad intel that the British intercepted for years. In 1947, the U.S. Air Forcemanufactured an elaborate UFO hoax to divert attention from a classified planecrash in Roswell, New Mexico. And more recently, the world had been led tobelieve that weapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq.For nearly three decades, the provost had helped powerful people protect,retain, and increase their power. Although he was exceptionally careful aboutthe jobs he accepted, the provost had always feared that one day he would takethe wrong job.And now that day has arrived.Every epic collapse, the provost believed, could be traced back to a singlemoment—a chance meeting, a bad decision, an indiscreet glance.In this case, he realized, that instant had come almost a dozen years before,when he agreed to hire a young med school student who was looking for some extramoney. The woman’s keen intellect, dazzling language skills, and knack forimprovisation made her an instantaneous standout at the Consortium.Sienna Brooks was a natural.Sienna had immediately understood his operation, and the provost sensed that theyoung woman was no stranger to keeping secrets herself. Sienna worked for himfor almost two years, earned a generous paycheck that helped her pay her medschool tuition, and then, without warning, she announced that she was done. Shewanted to save the world, and as she had told him, she couldn’t do it there.The provost never imagined Sienna Brooks would resurface nearly a decade later,bringing with her a gift of sorts—an ultrawealthy prospective client.Bertrand Zobrist.The provost bristled at the memory.This is Sienna’s fault.She was party to Zobrist’s plan all along.Nearby, at the C-130’s makeshift conference table, the conversation was becomingheated, with WHO officials talking on phones and arguing.“Sienna Brooks?!” one demanded, shouting into the phone. “Are you sure?” Theofficial listened a moment, frowning. “Okay, get me the details. I’ll hold.”He covered the receiver and turned to his colleagues. “It sounds like SiennaBrooks departed Italy shortly after we did.”Everyone at the table stiffened.“How?” one female employee demanded. “We covered the airport, bridges, trainstation …”“Nicelli airfield,” he replied. “On the Lido.”“Not possible,” the woman countered, shaking her head. “Nicelli is tiny. Thereare no flights out. It handles only local helicopter tours and—”“Somehow Sienna Brooks had access to a private jet that was hangared at Nicelli.They’re still looking into it.” He raised the receiver to his mouth again. “Yes,I’m here. What do you have?” As he listened to the update, his shoulders slumpedlower and lower until finally he took a seat. “I understand. Thank you.” Heended the call.His colleagues all stared at him expectantly.“Sienna’s jet was headed for Turkey,” the man said, rubbing his eyes.“Then call European Air Transport Command!” someone declared. “Have them turnthe jet around!”“I can’t,” the man said. “It landed twelve minutes ago at Hezarfen privateairfield, only fifteen miles from here. Sienna Brooks is gone.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 87RAIN WAS NOW pelting the ancient dome of Hagia Sophia.For nearly a thousand years, it had been the largest church in the world, andeven now it was hard to imagine anything larger. Seeing it again, Langdon wasreminded that the Emperor Justinian, upon the completion of Hagia Sophia, hadstepped back and proudly proclaimed, “Solomon, I have outdone thee!”Sinskey and Brüder were marching with intensifying purpose toward the monumentalbuilding, which only seemed to swell in size as they approached.The walkways here were lined with the ancient cannonballs used by the forces ofMehmet the Conqueror—a decorative reminder that the history of this building hadbeen filled with violence as it was conquered and then retasked to serve thespiritual needs of assorted victorious powers.As they neared the southern facade, Langdon glanced to his right at the threedomed, silolike appendages jutting off the building. These were the Mausoleumsof the Sultans, one of whom—Murad III—was said to have fathered over a hundredchildren.The ring of a cell phone cut the night air, and Brüder fished his out, checkingthe caller ID, and answered tersely: “Anything?”As he listened to the report, he shook his head in disbelief. “How is thatpossible?” He listened further and sighed. “Okay, keep me posted. We’re about togo inside.” He hung up.“What is it?” Sinskey demanded.“Keep your eyes open,” Brüder said, glancing around the area. “We may havecompany.” He returned his gaze to Sinskey. “It sounds like Sienna Brooks is inIstanbul.”Langdon stared at the man, incredulous to hear both that Sienna had found a wayto get to Turkey, and also that, having successfully escaped from Venice, shewould risk capture and possible death to ensure that Bertrand Zobrist’s plansucceeded.Sinskey looked equally alarmed and drew a breath as if preparing to interrogateBrüder further, but she apparently thought better of it, turning instead toLangdon. “Which way?”Langdon pointed to their left around the southwest corner of the building. “TheFountain of Ablutions is over here,” he said.Their rendezvous point with the museum contact was an ornately latticed wellheadthat had once been used for ritual washing before Muslim prayer.“Professor Langdon!” a man’s voice shouted as they drew near.A smiling Turkish man stepped out from under the octagonal cupola that coveredthe fountain. He was waving his arms excitedly. “Professor, over here!”Langdon and the others hurried over.“Hello, my name is Mirsat,” he said, his accented English voice brimming withenthusiasm. He was a slight man with thinning hair, scholarly-looking glasses,and a gray suit. “This is a great honor for me.”“The honor is ours,” Langdon replied, shaking Mirsat’s hand. “Thank you for yourhospitality on such short notice.”“Yes, yes!”“I’m Elizabeth Sinskey,” Dr. Sinskey said, shaking Mirsat’s hand and thenmotioning to Brüder. “And this is Cristoph Brüder. We’re here to assistProfessor Langdon. I’m so sorry our plane was delayed. You’re very kind toaccommodate us.”“Please! Think nothing of it!” Mirsat gushed. “For Professor Langdon I wouldgive a private tour at any hour. His little book Christian Symbols in the MuslimWorld is a favorite in our museum gift shop.”Really? Langdon thought. Now I know the one place on earth that carries thatbook.“Shall we?” Mirsat said, motioning for them to follow.The group hurried across a small open space, passing the regular touristentrance and continuing on to what had originally been the building’s mainentrance—three deeply recessed archways with massive bronze doors.Two armed security guards were waiting to greet them. Upon seeing Mirsat, theguards unlocked one of the doors and swung it open.“Sağ olun,” Mirsat said, uttering one of a handful of Turkish phrases Langdonwas familiar with—an especially polite form of “thank you.”The group stepped through, and the guards closed the heavy doors behind them,the thud resonating through the stone interior.Langdon and the others were now standing in Hagia Sophia’s narthex—a narrowantechamber that was common in Christian churches and served as an architecturalbuffer between the divine and the profane.Spiritual moats, Langdon often called them.The group crossed toward another set of doors, and Mirsat pulled one open.Beyond it, instead of the sanctuary he had anticipated seeing, Langdon beheld asecondary narthex, slightly larger than the first.An esonarthex, Langdon realized, having forgotten that Hagia Sophia’s sanctuaryenjoyed two levels of protection from the outside world.As if to prepare the visitor for what lay ahead, the esonarthex wassignificantly more ornate than the narthex, its walls made of burnished stonethat glowed in the light of elegant chandeliers. On the far side of the serenespace stood four doors, above which were spectacular mosaics, which Langdonfound himself intently admiring.Mirsat walked to the largest door—a colossal, bronze-plated portal. “TheImperial Doorway,” Mirsat whispered, his voice almost giddy with enthusiasm. “InByzantine times, this door was reserved for sole use of the emperor. Touristsdon’t usually go through it, but this is a special night.”Mirsat reached for the door, but paused. “Before we enter,” he whispered, “letme ask, is there something in particular you would like to see inside?”Langdon, Sinskey, and Brüder all glanced at one another.“Yes,” Langdon said. “There’s so much to see, of course, but if we could, we’dlike to begin with the tomb of Enrico Dandolo.”Mirsat cocked his head as if he had misunderstood. “I’m sorry? You want to see …Dandolo’s tomb?”“We do.”Mirsat looked downcast. “But, sir … Dandolo’s tomb is very plain. No symbols atall. Not our finest offering.”“I realize that,” Langdon said politely. “All the same, we’d be most grateful ifyou could take us to it.”Mirsat studied Langdon a long moment, and then his eyes drifted upward to themosaic directly over the door, which Langdon had just been admiring. The mosaicwas a ninth-century image of the Pantocrator Christ—the iconic image of Christholding the New Testament in his left hand while making a blessing with hisright.Then, as if a light had suddenly dawned for their guide, the corners of Mirsat’slips curled into a knowing smile, and he began wagging his finger. “Clever man!Very clever!”Langdon stared. “I’m sorry?”“Don’t worry, Professor,” Mirsat said in a conspiratorial whisper. “I won’t tellanyone why you’re really here.”Sinskey and Brüder shot Langdon a puzzled look.All Langdon could do was shrug as Mirsat heaved open the door and ushered theminside."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 88THE EIGHTH WONDER of the World, some had called this space, and standing in itnow, Langdon was not about to argue with that assessment.As the group stepped across the threshold into the colossal sanctuary, Langdonwas reminded that Hagia Sophia required only an instant to impress upon itsvisitors the sheer magnitude of its proportions.So vast was this room that it seemed to dwarf even the great cathedrals ofEurope. The staggering force of its enormity was, Langdon knew, partly anillusion, a dramatic side effect of its Byzantine floor plan, with a centralizednaos that concentrated all of its interior space in a single square room ratherthan extending it along the four arms of a cruciform, as was the style adoptedin later cathedrals.This building is seven hundred years older than Notre-Dame, Langdon thought.After taking a moment to absorb the breadth of the room’s dimensions, Langdonlet his eyes climb skyward, more than a hundred and fifty feet overhead, to thesprawling, golden dome that crowned the room. From its central point, forty ribsradiated outward like rays of the sun, extending to a circular arcade of fortyarched windows. During daylight hours, the light that streamed through thesewindows reflected—and re-reflected—off glass shards embedded in the golden tilework, creating the “mystical light” for which Hagia Sophia was most famous.Langdon had seen the gilded ambience of this room captured accurately inpainting only once. John Singer Sargent. Not surprisingly, in creating hisfamous painting of Hagia Sophia, the American artist had limited his paletteonly to multiple shades of a single color.Gold.The glistening golden cupola was often called “the dome of heaven itself” andwas supported by four tremendous arches, which in turn were sustained by aseries of semidomes and tympana. These supports were then carried by yet anotherdescending tier of smaller semidomes and arcades, creating the effect of acascade of architectural forms working their way from heaven toward earth.Moving from heaven to earth, albeit by a more direct route, long cablesdescended straight down from the dome and supported a sea of gleamingchandeliers, which seemed to hang so low to the floor that tall visitors riskedcolliding with them. In reality, this was another illusion created by the sheermagnitude of the space, for the fixtures hung more than twelve feet off thefloor.As with all great shrines, Hagia Sophia’s prodigious size served two purposes.First, it was proof to God of the great lengths to which Man would go to paytribute to Him. And second, it served as a kind of shock treatment forworshippers—a physical space so imposing that those who entered felt dwarfed,their egos erased, their physical being and cosmic importance shrinking to thesize of a mere speck in the face of God … an atom in the hands of the Creator.Until a man is nothing, God can make nothing out of him. Martin Luther hadspoken those words in the sixteenth century, but the concept had been part ofthe mind-set of builders since the earliest examples of religious architecture.Langdon glanced over at Brüder and Sinskey, who had been staring upward and whonow lowered their eyes to earth.“Jesus,” Brüder said.“Yes!” Mirsat said excitedly. “And Allah and Muhammad, too!”Langdon chuckled as their guide directed Brüder’s gaze to the main altar, wherea towering mosaic of Jesus was flanked by two massive disks bearing the Arabicnames of Muhammad and Allah in ornate calligraphy.“This museum,” Mirsat explained, “in an effort to remind visitors of the diverseuses of this sacred space, displays in tandem both the Christian iconography,from the days when Hagia Sophia was a basilica, and the Islamic iconography,from its days as a mosque.” He gave a proud smile. “Despite the friction betweenthe religions in the real world, we think their symbols work quite nicelytogether. I know you agree, Professor.”Langdon gave a heartfelt nod, recalling that all of the Christian iconographyhad been covered in whitewash when the building became a mosque. The restorationof the Christian symbols next to the Muslim symbols had created a mesmerizingeffect, particularly because the styles and sensibilities of the twoiconographies are polar opposites.While Christian tradition favored literal images of its gods and saints, Islamfocused on calligraphy and geometric patterns to represent the beauty of God’suniverse. Islamic tradition held that only God could create life, and thereforeman has no place creating images of life—not gods, not people, not even animals.Langdon recalled once trying to explain this concept to his students: “A MuslimMichelangelo, for example, would never have painted God’s face on the ceiling ofthe Sistine Chapel; he would have inscribed the name of God. Depicting God’sface would be considered blasphemy.”Langdon had gone on to explain the reason for this.“Both Christianity and Islam are logocentric,” he told his students, “meaningthey are focused on the Word. In Christian tradition, the Word became flesh inthe book of John: ‘And the Word was made flesh, and He dwelt among us.’Therefore, it was acceptable to depict the Word as having a human form. InIslamic tradition, however, the Word did not become flesh, and therefore theWord needs to remain in the form of a word … in most cases, calligraphicrenderings of the names of the holy figures of Islam.”One of Langdon’s students had summed up the complex history with an amusinglyaccurate marginal note: “Christians like faces; Muslims like words.”“Here before us,” Mirsat went on, motioning across the spectacular room, “yousee a unique blending of Christianity with Islam.”He quickly pointed out the fusion of symbols in the massive apse, most notablythe Virgin and Child gazing down upon a mihrab—the semicircular niche in amosque that indicates the direction of Mecca. Nearby, a staircase rose up to anorator’s pulpit, which resembled the kind from which Christian sermons aredelivered, but in fact was a minbar, the holy platform from which an imam leadsFriday services. Similarly, the daislike structure nearby resembled a Christianchoir stall but in reality was a müezzin mahfili, a raised platform where amuezzin kneels and chants in response to the imam’s prayers.“Mosques and cathedrals are startlingly similar,” Mirsat proclaimed. “Thetraditions of East and West are not as divergent as you might think!”“Mirsat?” Brüder pressed, sounding impatient. “We’d really like to see Dandolo’stomb, if we may?”Mirsat looked mildly annoyed, as if the man’s haste were somehow a display ofdisrespect to the building.“Yes,” Langdon said. “I’m sorry to rush, but we’re on a very tight schedule.”“Very well, then,” Mirsat said, pointing to a high balcony to their right.“Let’s head upstairs and see the tomb.”“Up?” Langdon replied, startled. “Isn’t Enrico Dandolo buried down in thecrypt?” Langdon recalled the tomb itself, but not the precise place in thebuilding where it was located. He had been picturing the dark underground areasof the building.Mirsat seemed confounded by the query. “No, Professor, the tomb of EnricoDandolo is most certainly upstairs.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]What the devil is going on here? Mirsat wondered.When Langdon had asked to see Dandolo’s tomb, Mirsat had sensed that the requestwas a kind of decoy. Nobody wants to see Dandolo’s tomb. Mirsat had assumed whatLangdon really wanted to see was the enigmatic treasure directly besideDandolo’s tomb—the Deesis Mosaic—an ancient Pantocrator Christ that was arguablyone of the most mysterious pieces of art in the building.Langdon is researching the mosaic, and trying to be discreet about it, Mirsathad guessed, imagining that the professor was probably writing a secret piece onthe Deesis.Now, however, Mirsat was confused. Certainly Langdon knew the Deesis Mosaic wason the second floor, so why was he acting so surprised?Unless he is indeed looking for Dandolo’s tomb?Puzzled, Mirsat guided them toward the staircase, passing one of Hagia Sophia’stwo famous urns—a 330-gallon behemoth carved out of a single piece of marbleduring the Hellenistic period.Climbing in silence now with his entourage, Mirsat found himself feelingunsettled. Langdon’s colleagues did not seem like academics at all. One of themlooked like a soldier of some sort, muscular and rigid, dressed all in black.And the woman with the silver hair, Mirsat sensed … he had seen her before.Maybe on television?He was starting to suspect that the purpose of this visit was not what itappeared to be. Why are they really here?“One more flight,” Mirsat announced cheerily as they reached the landing.“Upstairs we shall find the tomb of Enrico Dandolo, and of course”—he paused,eyeing Langdon—“the famed Deesis Mosaic.”Not even a flinch.Langdon, it appeared, was not, in fact, here for the Deesis Mosaic at all. Heand his guests seemed inexplicably fixated on Dandolo’s tomb."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 89AS MIRSAT LED the way up the stairs, Langdon could tell that Brüder and Sinskeywere worried. Admittedly, ascending to the second floor seemed to make no sense.Langdon kept picturing Zobrist’s subterranean video … and the documentary filmabout the submerged areas beneath Hagia Sophia.We need to go down!Even so, if this was the location of Dandolo’s tomb, they had no choice but tofollow Zobrist’s directions. Kneel within the gilded mouseion of holy wisdom,and place thine ear to the ground, listening for the sounds of trickling water.When they finally reached the second level, Mirsat led them to the right alongthe balcony’s edge, which offered breathtaking views of the sanctuary below.Langdon faced front, remaining focused.Mirsat was talking fervently about the Deesis Mosaic again, but Langdon tunedhim out.He could now see his target.Dandolo’s tomb.The tomb appeared exactly as Langdon remembered it—a rectangular piece of whitemarble, inlaid in the polished stone floor and cordoned off by stanchions andchains.Langdon rushed over and examined the carved inscription.HENRICUS DANDOLOAs the others arrived behind him, Langdon sprang into action, stepping over theprotective chain and placing his feet directly in front of the tombstone.Mirsat protested loudly, but Langdon continued, dropping quickly to his knees asif preparing to pray at the feet of the treacherous doge.Next, in a move that elicited shouts of horror from Mirsat, Langdon placed hispalms flat on the tomb and prostrated himself. As he lowered his face to theground, Langdon realized that he looked like he was bowing to Mecca. Themaneuver apparently stunned Mirsat, who fell mute, and a sudden hush seemed topervade the entire building.Taking a deep breath, Langdon turned his head to the right and gently pressedhis left ear to the tomb. The stone felt cold on his flesh.The sound he heard echoing up through the stone was as clear as day.My God.The finale of Dante’s Inferno seemed to be echoing up from below.Slowly, Langdon turned his head, gazing up at Brüder and Sinskey.“I hear it,” he whispered. “The sounds of trickling water.”Brüder vaulted the chain and crouched down beside Langdon to listen. After amoment he was nodding intently.Now that they could hear the water flowing downward, one question remained.Where is it flowing?Langdon’s mind was suddenly flooded with images of a half-submerged cavern,bathed in an eerie red light … somewhere beneath them.Follow deep into the sunken palace …for here, in the darkness, the chthonic monster waits,submerged in the bloodred waters …of the lagoon that reflects no stars.When Langdon stood and stepped back over the stanchions, Mirsat was glaring upat him with a look of alarm and betrayal on his face. Langdon stood almost afoot taller than the Turkish guide.“Mirsat,” Langdon began. “I’m sorry. As you can see, this is a very unusualsituation. I don’t have time to explain, but I have a very important question toask you about this building.”Mirsat managed a weak nod. “Okay.”“Here at Dandolo’s tomb, we can hear a rivulet of water flowing somewhere underthe stone. We need to know where this water flows.”Mirsat shook his head. “I don’t understand. Water can be heard beneath thefloors everywhere in Hagia Sophia.”Everyone stiffened.“Yes,” Mirsat told them, “especially when it rains. Hagia Sophia hasapproximately one hundred thousand square feet of rooftops that need to drain,and it often takes days. And usually it rains again before the drainage iscomplete. The sounds of trickling water are quite common here. Perhaps you areaware that Hagia Sofia sits on vast caverns of water. There was a documentaryeven, which—”“Yes, yes,” Langdon said, “but do you know if the water that is audible here atDandolo’s tomb flows somewhere specific?”“Of course,” Mirsat said. “It flows to the same place that all the watershedding from Hagia Sophia flows. To the city cistern.”“No,” Brüder declared, stepping back over the stanchion. “We’re not looking fora cistern. We’re looking for a large, underground space, perhaps with columns?”“Yes,” Mirsat said. “The city’s ancient cistern is precisely that—a largeunderground space with columns. Quite impressive actually. It was built in thesixth century to house the city’s water supply. Nowadays it contains only aboutfour feet of water, but—”“Where is it!” Brüder demanded, his voice echoing across the empty hall.“The … cistern?” Mirsat asked, looking frightened. “It’s a block away, just eastof this building.” He pointed outside. “It’s called Yerebatan Sarayi.”Sarayi? Langdon wondered. As in Topkapi Sarayi? Signage for the Topkapi Palacehad been ubiquitous as they were driving in. “But … doesn’t sarayi mean‘palace’?”Mirsat nodded. “Yes. The name of our ancient cistern is Yerebatan Sarayi. Itmeans—the sunken palace.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 90THE RAIN WAS falling in sheets as Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey burst out of HagiaSophia with Langdon, Brüder, and their bewildered guide, Mirsat.Follow deep into the sunken palace, Sinskey thought.The site of the city’s cistern—Yerebatan Sarayi—was apparently back toward theBlue Mosque and a bit to the north.Mirsat led the way.Sinskey had seen no other option but to tell Mirsat who they were and that theywere racing to thwart a possible health crisis within the sunken palace.“This way!” Mirsat called, leading them across the darkened park. The mountainof Hagia Sophia was behind them now, and the fairy-tale spires of the BlueMosque glistened ahead.Hurrying beside Sinskey, Agent Brüder was shouting into his phone, updating theSRS team and ordering them to rendezvous at the cistern’s entrance. “It soundslike Zobrist is targeting the city’s water supply,” Brüder said, breathless.“I’m going to need schematics of all conduits in and out of the cistern. We’llrun full isolation and containment protocols. We’ll need physical and chemicalbarriers along with vacuum—”“Wait,” Mirsat called over to him. “You misunderstood me. The cistern is not thecity water supply. Not anymore!”Brüder lowered his phone, glaring at their guide. “What?”“In ancient times, the cistern held the water supply,” Mirsat clarified. “But nolonger. We modernized.”Brüder came to a stop under a sheltering tree, and everyone halted with him.“Mirsat,” Sinskey said, “you’re sure that nobody drinks the water out of thecistern?”“Heavens no,” Mirsat said. “The water pretty much just sits there … eventuallyfiltering down into the earth.”Sinskey, Langdon, and Brüder all exchanged uncertain looks. Sinskey didn’t knowwhether to feel relieved or alarmed. If nobody comes in regular contact with thewater, why would Zobrist choose to contaminate it?“When we modernized our water supply decades ago,” Mirsat explained, “thecistern fell out of use and became just a big pond in an underground room.” Heshrugged. “These days it’s nothing more than a tourist attraction.”Sinskey spun toward Mirsat. A tourist attraction? “Hold on … people can go downthere? Into the cistern?”“Of course,” he said. “Many thousands visit every day. The cavern is quitestriking. There are boardwalks over the water … and even a small café. There’slimited ventilation, so the air is quite stuffy and humid, but it’s still verypopular.”Sinskey’s eyes locked on Brüder, and she could tell that she and the trained SRSagent were picturing the same thing—a dark, humid cavern filled with stagnantwater in which a pathogen was incubating. Completing the nightmare was thepresence of boardwalks over which tourists moved all day long, just above thewater’s surface.“He created a bioaerosol,” Brüder declared.Sinskey nodded, slumping.“Meaning?” Langdon demanded.“Meaning,” Brüder replied, “that it can go airborne.”Langdon fell silent, and Sinskey could see that he was now grasping thepotential magnitude of this crisis.An airborne pathogen had been on Sinskey’s mind as a possible scenario for sometime, and yet when she believed that the cistern was the city’s water supply,she had hoped maybe this meant that Zobrist had chosen a water-bound bioform.Water-dwelling bacteria were robust and weather-resistant, but they were alsoslow to propagate.Airborne pathogens spread fast.Very fast.“If it’s airborne,” Brüder said, “it’s probably viral.”A virus, Sinskey agreed. The fastest-spreading pathogen Zobrist could choose.Releasing an airborne virus underwater was admittedly unusual, and yet therewere many life-forms that incubated in liquid and then hatched into theair—mosquitoes, mold spores, the bacterium that caused Legionnaires’ disease,mycotoxins, red tide, even human beings. Sinskey grimly pictured the viruspermeating the cistern’s lagoon … and then the infected microdroplets risinginto the damp air.Mirsat was now staring across a traffic-jammed street with a look ofapprehension on his face. Sinskey followed his gaze to a squat, red-and-whitebrick building whose single door was open, revealing what looked to be astairwell. A scattering of well-dressed people seemed to be waiting outsideunder umbrellas while a doorman controlled the flow of guests who weredescending the stairs.Some kind of underground dance club?Sinskey saw the gold lettering on the building and felt a sudden tightness inher chest. Unless this club was called the Cistern and had been built in A.D.523, she realized why Mirsat was looking so concerned.“The sunken palace,” Mirsat stammered. “It seems … there is a concert tonight.”Sinskey was incredulous. “A concert in a cistern?!”“It’s a large indoor space,” he replied. “It is often used as a culturalcenter.”Brüder had apparently heard enough. He dashed toward the building, sidesteppinghis way through snarled traffic on Alemdar Avenue. Sinskey and the others brokeinto a run as well, close on the agent’s heels.When they arrived at the cistern entrance, the doorway was blocked by a handfulof concertgoers who were waiting to be let in—a trio of women in burkas, a pairof tourists holding hands, a man in a tuxedo. They were all clustered togetherin the doorway, trying to keep out of the rain.Sinskey could hear the melodic strains of a classical music composition liltingup from below. Berlioz, she guessed from the idiosyncratic orchestration, butwhatever it was, it felt out of place here in the streets of Istanbul.As they drew closer to the doorway, she felt a warm wind rushing up the stairs,billowing from deep inside the earth and escaping from the enclosed cavern. Thewind brought to the surface not only the sound of violins, but the unmistakablescents of humidity and masses of people.It also brought to Sinskey a deep sense of foreboding.As a group of tourists emerged from the stairs, chatting happily as they exitedthe building, the doorman allowed the next group to descend.Brüder immediately moved to enter, but the doorman stopped him with a pleasantwave. “One moment, sir. The cistern is at capacity. It should be less than aminute until another visitor exits. Thank you.”Brüder looked ready to force his way in, but Sinskey placed a hand on hisshoulder and pulled him off to one side.“Wait,” she commanded. “Your team is on the way and you can’t search this placealone.” She motioned to the plaque on the wall beside the door. “The cistern isenormous.”The informational plaque described a cathedral-size subterranean room—nearly twofootball fields in length—with a ceiling spanning more than a hundred thousandsquare feet and supported by a forest of 336 marble columns.“Look at this,” Langdon said, standing a few yards away. “You’re not going tobelieve it.”Sinskey turned. Langdon motioned to a concert poster on the wall. Oh, dear God.The WHO director had been correct in identifying the style of the music asRomantic, but the piece that was being performed had not been composed byBerlioz. It was by a different Romantic composer—Franz Liszt.Tonight, deep within the earth, the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra wasperforming one of Franz Liszt’s most famous works—the Dante Symphony—an entirecomposition inspired by Dante’s descent into and return from hell.“It’s being performed here for a week,” Langdon said, scrutinizing the poster’sfine print. “A free concert. Underwritten by an anonymous donor.”Sinskey suspected that she could guess the identity of the anonymous donor.Bertrand Zobrist’s flair for the dramatic, it seemed, was also a ruthlesspractical strategy. This week of free concerts would lure thousands moretourists than usual down into the cistern and place them in a congested area …where they would breathe the contaminated air, then travel back to their homesboth here and abroad.“Sir?” the doorman called to Brüder. “We have room for a couple more.”Brüder turned to Sinskey. “Call the local authorities. Whatever we find downthere, we’ll need support. When my team arrives, have them radio me for anupdate. I’ll go down and see if I can get a sense of where Zobrist might havetethered this thing.”“Without a respirator?” Sinskey asked. “You don’t know for a fact the Solublonbag is intact.”Brüder frowned, holding his hand up in the warm wind that was blowing out of thedoorway. “I hate to say this, but if this contagion is out, I’m guessingeveryone in this city is probably infected.”Sinskey had been thinking the same thing but hadn’t wanted to say it in front ofLangdon and Mirsat.“Besides,” Brüder added, “I’ve seen what happens to crowds when my team marchesin wearing hazmat suits. We’d have full-scale panic and a stampede.”Sinskey decided to defer to Brüder; he was, after all, the specialist and hadbeen in situations like this before.“Our only realistic option,” Brüder told her, “is to assume it’s still safe downthere, and make a play to contain this.”“Okay,” Sinskey said. “Do it.”“There’s another problem,” Langdon interjected. “What about Sienna?”“What about her?” Brüder demanded. “Whatever her intentions may be here inIstanbul, she’s very good with languages and possibly speaks some Turkish.”“So?”“Sienna knows the poem references the ‘sunken palace,’ ” Langdon said. “And inTurkish, ‘sunken palace’ literally points …” He motioned to the “YerebatanSarayi” sign over the doorway. “… here.”“That’s true,” Sinskey agreed wearily. “She may have figured this out andbypassed Hagia Sophia altogether.”Brüder glanced at the lone doorway and cursed under his breath. “Okay, if she’sdown there and plans to break the Solublon bag before we can contain it, atleast she hasn’t been there long. It’s a huge area, and she probably has no ideawhere to look. And with all those people around, she probably can’t just diveinto the water unnoticed.”“Sir?” the doorman called again to Brüder. “Would you like to enter now?”Brüder could see another group of concertgoers approaching from across thestreet, and nodded to the doorman that he was indeed coming.“I’m coming with you,” Langdon said, following.Brüder turned and faced him. “No chance.”Langdon’s tone was unyielding. “Agent Brüder, one of the reasons we’re in thissituation is that Sienna Brooks has been playing me all day. And as you said, wemay all be infected already. I’m helping you whether you like it or not.”Brüder stared at him a moment and then relented.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]As Langdon passed through the doorway and began descending the steep staircasebehind Brüder, he could feel the warm wind rushing past them from the bowels ofthe cistern. The humid breeze carried on it the strains of Liszt’s DanteSymphony as well as a familiar, yet ineffable scent … that of a massive crush ofpeople congregated together in an enclosed space.Langdon suddenly felt a ghostly pall envelop him, as if the long fingers of anunseen hand were reaching out of the earth and raking his flesh.The music.The symphony chorus—a hundred voices strong—was now singing a well-knownpassage, articulating every syllable of Dante’s gloomy text.“Lasciate ogne speranza,” they were now chanting, “voi ch’entrate.”These six words—the most famous line in all of Dante’s Inferno—welled up fromthe bottom of the stairs like the ominous stench of death.Accompanied by a swell of trumpets and horns, the choir intoned the warningagain. “Lasciate ogne speranza voi ch’entrate!”Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 91BATHED IN RED light, the subterranean cavern resonated with the sounds ofhell-inspired music—the wail of voices, the dissonant pinch of strings, and thedeep roll of timpani, which thundered through the grotto like a seismic tremor.As far as Langdon could see, the floor of this underground world was a glassysheet of water—dark, still, smooth—like black ice on a frozen New England pond.The lagoon that reflects no stars.Rising out of the water, meticulously arranged in seemingly endless rows, werehundreds upon hundreds of thick Doric columns, each climbing thirty feet tosupport the cavern’s vaulted ceiling. The columns were lit from below by aseries of individual red spotlights, creating a surreal forest of illuminatedtrunks that telescoped off into the darkness like some kind of mirroredillusion.Langdon and Brüder paused at the bottom of the stairs, momentarily stalled onthe threshold of the spectral hollow before them. The cavern itself seemed toglow with a reddish hue, and as Langdon took it all in, he could feel himselfbreathing as shallowly as possible.The air down here was heavier than he’d imagined.Langdon could see the crowd in the distance to their left. The concert wastaking place deep in the underground space, halfway back against the far wall,its audience seated on an expanse of platforms. Several hundred spectators satin concentric rings that had been arranged around the orchestra while a hundredmore stood around the perimeter. Still others had taken up positions out on thenear boardwalks, leaning on the sturdy railings and gazing down into the wateras they listened to the music.Langdon found himself scanning the sea of amorphous silhouettes, his eyessearching for Sienna. She was nowhere in sight. Instead he saw figures intuxedos, gowns, bishts, burkas, and even tourists in shorts and sweatshirts. Thecross section of humanity, gathered in the crimson light, looked to Langdon likecelebrants in some kind of occult mass.If Sienna’s down here, he realized, it will be nearly impossible to spot her.At that moment a heavyset man moved past them, exiting up the stairs, coughingas he went. Brüder spun and watched him go, scrutinizing him carefully. Langdonfelt a faint tickle in his own throat but told himself it was his imagination.Brüder now took a tentative step forward on the boardwalk, eyeing their numerousoptions. The path before them looked like the entrance to the Minotaur’slabyrinth. The single boardwalk quickly forked into three, each of thosebranching off again, creating a suspended maze, hovering over the water, weavingin and out of the columns and snaking into the darkness.I found myself within a forest dark, Langdon thought, recalling the ominousfirst canto of Dante’s masterwork, for the straightforward pathway had beenlost.Langdon peered over the walkway’s railing into the water. It was about four feetdeep and surprisingly clear. The stone tile floor was visible, blanketed by afine layer of silt.Brüder took a quick look down, gave a noncommittal grunt, and then raised hiseyes back to the room. “Do you see anything that looks like the area inZobrist’s video?”Everything, Langdon thought, surveying the steep, damp walls around them. Hemotioned to the most remote corner of the cavern, far off to the right, awayfrom the congestion of the orchestral platform. “I’m guessing back theresomewhere.”Brüder nodded. “My instinct as well.”The two of them hurried down the boardwalk, choosing the right-hand fork, whichcarried them away from the crowd, in the direction of the farthest reaches ofthe sunken palace.As they walked, Langdon realized how easy it would be to hide overnight in thisspace, undetected. Zobrist could have done just that to make his video. Ofcourse, if he had generously underwritten this week-long concert series, he alsocould have simply requested some private time in the cistern.Not that it matters anymore.Brüder was striding faster now, as if subconsciously keeping pace with thesymphony’s tempo, which had increased into a cascading series of descendingsemitone suspensions.Dante and Virgil’s descent into hell.Langdon intently scanned the steep, mossy walls in the distance to their right,trying to match them up with what they had seen in the video. At each new forkin the boardwalk, they turned right, moving farther from the crowd, heading forthe cavern’s most remote corner. Langdon looked back and was astounded by thedistance they had covered.They advanced at almost a jog now, passing a handful of meandering visitors, butby the time they entered the deepest parts of the cistern, the number of peoplehad thinned to nothing.Brüder and Langdon were alone.“It all looks the same,” Brüder despaired. “Where do we start?” Langdon sharedhis frustration. He remembered the video vividly, but nothing down here leapedout as a recognizable feature.Langdon studied the softly lit informational signs that dotted the boardwalk asthey moved ahead. One described the twenty-one-million-gallon capacity of theroom. Another pointed out a nonmatching pillar that had been looted from anearby structure during construction. And still another offered a diagram of anancient carving now faded from view—the Crying Hen’s Eye symbol, which wept forall the slaves who died while building the cistern.Strangely, it was a sign that bore a single word that now stopped Langdon deadin his tracks.Brüder halted, too, turning. “What’s wrong?”Langdon pointed.On the sign, accompanied by a directional arrow, was the name of a fearsomeGorgon—an infamous female monster.MEDUSA⇒Brüder read the sign and shrugged. “So what?”Langdon’s heart was pounding. He knew Medusa was not only the fearsomesnake-haired spirit whose gaze could turn anyone who looked at her to stone, butwas also a prominent member of the Greek pantheon of subterranean spirits … aspecific category known as the chthonic monsters.Follow deep into the sunken palace …for here, in the darkness, the chthonic monster waits …She’s pointing the way, Langdon realized, breaking into a run along theboardwalk. Brüder could barely keep up with him as Langdon zigzagged into thedarkness, following the signs for Medusa. Finally, he reached a dead end at asmall viewing platform near the base of the cistern’s rightmost wall.There before him was an incredible sight.Rising out of the water was a colossal carved marble block—the head ofMedusa—her hair writhing with snakes. Making her presence here even more bizarrewas the fact that her head had been placed on her neck upside down.Inverted as the damned, Langdon realized, picturing Botticelli’s Map of Hell andthe inverted sinners he had placed in the Malebolge.Brüder arrived breathless beside Langdon at the railing, staring out at theupside-down Medusa with a look of bewilderment.Langdon suspected that this carved head, which now served as a plinth supportingone of the columns, had probably been pillaged from elsewhere and used here asan inexpensive building supply. The reason for Medusa’s inverted position was nodoubt the superstitious belief that the inversion would rob her of her evilpowers. Even so, Langdon could not shake off the barrage of haunting thoughtsthat assailed him.Dante’s Inferno. The finale. The center of the earth. Where gravity invertsitself. Where up becomes down.His skin now prickling with foreboding, Langdon squinted through the reddishhaze that surrounded the sculpted head. Most of Medusa’s serpent-infested hairwas submerged underwater, but her eyes were above the surface, facing to theleft, staring out across the lagoon.Fearfully, Langdon leaned over the railing and turned his head, letting his gazefollow the statue’s out into the familiar empty corner of the sunken palace.In an instant, he knew.This was the spot.Zobrist’s ground zero."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 92AGENT BRÜDER LOWERED himself stealthily, sliding beneath the railing anddropping down into the chest-deep water. As the rush of cool liquid permeatedhis clothing, his muscles tensed against the chill. The floor of the cistern wasslippery beneath his boots, but it felt solid. He stood a moment, taking stock,watching the concentric circles of water rippling away from his body like shockwaves across the lagoon.For a moment Brüder didn’t breathe. Move slowly, he told himself. Create noturbulence.Above him on the boardwalk, Langdon stood at the railing, scanning thesurrounding boardwalks.“All set,” Langdon whispered. “Nobody sees you.”Brüder turned and faced the huge upside-down head of Medusa, which was brightlylit by a red spotlight. The inverted monster looked even larger now that Brüderwas down at her level.“Follow Medusa’s gaze across the lagoon,” Langdon whispered. “Zobrist had aflair for symbolism and dramatics … I wouldn’t be surprised if he placed hiscreation directly in the lethal sight line of Medusa.”Great minds think alike. Brüder felt grateful that the American professor hadinsisted on making the descent with him; Langdon’s expertise had guided themalmost immediately to this distant corner of the cistern.As the strains of the Dante Symphony continued to reverberate in the distance,Brüder took out his waterproof Tovatec penlight and submerged it beneath thewater, flipping the switch. A bright halogen beam pierced the water,illuminating the cistern floor before him.Easy, Brüder reminded himself. Don’t disturb a thing.Without another word, he began his careful journey out into the lagoon, wadingin slow motion through the water, moving his flashlight methodically back andforth like an underwater minesweeper.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]At the railing, Langdon had begun to feel an unsettling tightness in his throat.The air in the cistern, despite the humidity, tasted stale and oxygen-depletedto him. As Brüder waded carefully out into the lagoon, the professor reassuredhimself that everything would be fine.We arrived in time.It’s all intact.Brüder’s team can contain this.Even so, Langdon felt jumpy. As a lifelong claustrophobe, he knew he would beanxious down here under any circumstances. Something about thousands of tons ofearth hovering overhead … supported by nothing but decaying pillars.He pushed the thought from his mind and took another glance behind him foranyone taking undue interest.Nothing.The only people nearby were standing on various other boardwalks, and they wereall looking in the opposite direction, toward the orchestra. No one seemed tohave noticed Brüder slowly wading across the water in this deep corner of thecistern.Langdon returned his gaze to the SRS team leader, whose submerged halogen beamstill oscillated eerily in front of him, lighting the way.As Langdon looked on, his peripheral vision suddenly picked up movement to hisleft—an ominous black form rising out of the water in front of Brüder. Langdonwheeled and stared into the looming darkness, half expecting to see some kind ofleviathan rearing up from beneath the surface.Brüder had stopped short, apparently having seen it, too.In the far corner, a wavering black shape rose some thirty feet up the wall. Theghostly silhouette looked nearly identical to that of the plague doctor who’dappeared in Zobrist’s video.It’s a shadow, Langdon realized, exhaling. Brüder’s shadow.The shadow had been cast as Brüder moved past a submerged spotlight in thelagoon, exactly, it seemed, as Zobrist’s shadow had done in the video.“This is the spot,” Langdon called out to Brüder. “You’re close.”Brüder nodded and continued inching his way out into the lagoon. Langdon movedalong the railing, staying even with him. As the agent moved farther and fartheraway, Langdon stole another quick glance toward the orchestra to make sureBrüder had not been noticed.Nothing.As Langdon again returned his gaze to the lagoon, a glint of reflected lightcaught his eye on the boardwalk at his feet.He looked down and saw a tiny puddle of red liquid.Blood.Strangely, Langdon was standing in it.Am I bleeding?Langdon felt no pain, and yet he frantically began searching himself for someinjury or possible reaction to an unseen toxin in the air. He checked his nosefor a possible bleed, his fingernails, his ears.Baffled as to where the blood had come from, Langdon glanced around, confirmingthat he was indeed alone on the deserted walkway.Langdon looked down at the puddle again, and this time he noticed a tiny rivuletflowing along the boardwalk and collecting in the low spot at his feet. The redliquid, it seemed, was coming from somewhere up ahead and trickling down anincline in the boardwalk.Someone is injured up there, Langdon sensed. He glanced quickly out at Brüder,who was nearing the center of the lagoon.Langdon strode quickly up the boardwalk, following the rivulet. As he advancedtoward the dead end, the rivulet became wider, flowing freely. What in theworld? At this point it turned into a small stream. He broke into a jog,following the flowing liquid all the way to the wall, where the boardwalksuddenly ended.Dead end.In the murky darkness, he found a large pool, which was glistening red, as ifsomeone had just been slaughtered here.In that instant, as Langdon watched the red liquid dripping off the boardwalkinto the cistern, he realized that his original assessment was mistaken.It’s not blood.The red lights of the vast space, combined with the red hue of the boardwalk,had created an illusion, giving these clear droplets a reddish-black tint.It’s just water.Instead of bringing a sense of relief, the revelation infused him with bluntfear. He stared down at the puddle of water, now seeing splashes on the banister… and footprints.Someone climbed out of the water here.Langdon spun to call out to Brüder, but he was too far away and the music hadprogressed into a fortissimo of brass and timpani. It was deafening. Langdonsuddenly felt a presence beside him.I’m not alone out here.In slow motion, Langdon turned toward the wall where the boardwalk dead-ended.Ten feet away, shrouded in dark shadows, he was able to discern a rounded form,like a large stone cloaked in black cloth, dripping in a pool of water. The formwas motionless.And then it moved.The form elongated, its featureless head rotating upward from its bowedposition.A person huddled in a black burka, Langdon realized.The traditional Islamic body covering left no skin showing, but as the veiledhead turned toward Langdon, two dark eyes materialized, staring out through thenarrow slit of the burka’s face covering, locking intently on Langdon.In an instant, he knew.Sienna Brooks exploded from her hiding place. She accelerated to a sprint in asingle stride, plowing into Langdon and driving him to the ground as she racedoff down the boardwalk."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 93OUT IN THE lagoon, Agent Brüder had stopped in his tracks. The halogen beam ofhis Tovatec penlight had just picked up the sharp glint of metal up ahead on thesubmerged cistern floor.Barely breathing, Brüder took a delicate step closer, cautious not to create anyturbulence in the water. Through the glassy surface, he could now make out asleek rectangle of titanium, bolted to the floor.Zobrist’s plaque.The water was so clear he could almost read tomorrow’s date and accompanyingtext:IN THIS PLACE, ON THIS DATE,THE WORLD WAS CHANGED FOREVER.Think again, Brüder mused, his confidence rising. We have several hours to stopthis before tomorrow.Picturing Zobrist’s video, Brüder gently inched the flashlight beam to the leftof the plaque, searching for the tethered Solublon bag. As the beam illuminatedthe darkened water, Brüder strained his gaze in confusion.No bag.He moved the beam farther to the left, to the precise spot where the bag hadappeared on the video.Still nothing.But … it was right here!Brüder’s jaw clenched as he took another tentative step closer, sweeping thebeam slowly around the entire area.There was no bag. Only the plaque.For a brief, hopeful instant, Brüder wondered if perhaps this threat, like somany things today, had been nothing but an illusion.Was it all a hoax?!Did Zobrist just want to scare us?!And then he saw it.To the left of the plaque, barely visible on the lagoon floor, lay a limptether. The flaccid string looked like a lifeless worm in the water. At the farend of the string was a tiny plastic clasp, from which hung a few tatters ofSolublon plastic.Brüder stared down at the frayed relic of the transparent bag. It clung to theend of the tether like the tattered knot of a popped party balloon.The truth settled slowly in his gut.We’re too late.He pictured the submerged bag dissolving and breaking apart … its deadlycontents spreading out into the water … and bubbling up to the surface of thelagoon.With a tremulous finger, he flicked off his flashlight and stood a moment in thedarkness, trying to gather his thoughts.Those thoughts turned quickly to prayer.God help us all.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]“Agent Brüder, repeat!” Sinskey shouted into her radio, descending halfway downthe stairwell into the cistern, trying to get better reception. “I didn’t copythat!”The warm wind rushed past her, up the stairs toward the open doorway above.Outside, the SRS team had arrived and its members were prepping behind thebuilding in an effort to keep their hazmat gear out of sight while they waitedto receive Brüder’s assessment.“… ruptured bag …” Brüder’s voice crackled in Sinskey’s comm. “… and …released.”What?! Sinskey prayed she was misunderstanding as she rushed farther down thestairs. “Repeat!” she commanded, nearing the base of the stairwell, where theorchestral music grew louder.Brüder’s voice was much clearer this time. “… and I repeat … the contagion hasbeen dispersed!”Sinskey lurched forward, nearly falling into the cistern’s entryway at the baseof the stairwell. How can that be?!“The bag has dissolved,” Brüder’s voice snapped loudly. “The contagion is in thewater!”A cold sweat gripped Dr. Sinskey as she raised her eyes and tried to process thesprawling underground world now spread out before her. Through the reddish haze,she saw a vast expanse of water from which sprang hundreds of columns. Most ofall, however, she saw people.Hundreds of people.Sinskey stared out at the unsuspecting crowd, all of them confined in Zobrist’sunderground death trap. She reacted on instinct. “Agent Brüder, come up at once.We’ll begin evacuating people immediately.”Brüder’s reply was instantaneous. “Absolutely not! Seal the doors! Nobody getsout of here!”As director of the World Health Organization, Elizabeth Sinskey was accustomedto having her orders followed without question. For an instant, she thought shehad misunderstood the lead SRS agent’s words. Seal the doors?!“Dr. Sinskey!” Brüder shouted over the music. “Do you read me?! Close thegoddamn doors!”Brüder repeated the command, but it was unnecessary. Sinskey knew he wascorrect. In the face of a possible pandemic, containment was the only viableoption.Sinskey reflexively reached up and gripped her lapis lazuli amulet. Sacrificethe few to save the many. With a hardening resolve, she raised the radio to herlips. “Confirmed, Agent Brüder. I’ll give the order to seal the doors.”Sinskey was about to turn away from the horror of the cistern and give thecommand to seal the area when she sensed a sudden commotion in the crowd.Not far away, a woman in a black burka was dashing toward her along a crowdedboardwalk, knocking people out of the way as she ran. The veiled woman seemed tobe headed directly for Sinskey and the exit.She’s being chased, Sinskey realized, spotting a man running behind her.Then Sinskey froze. That’s Langdon!Sinskey’s eyes whipped back to the woman in the burka, who was approaching fastand now shouting something in Turkish to all the people on the boardwalk.Sinskey didn’t speak Turkish, but judging from the panicked reaction of thepeople, the woman’s words were the equivalent of shouting “Fire!” in a crowdedtheater.A ripple of panic swept through the crowd, and suddenly it was not only theveiled woman and Langdon who were dashing for the stairs. Everyone was.Sinskey turned her back to the oncoming stampede and began shouting desperatelyup the stairs to her team.“Lock the doors!” Sinskey screamed. “Seal the cistern! NOW!”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]By the time Langdon skidded around the corner into the stairwell, Sinskey washalfway up the stairs, clambering toward the surface, shouting wildly to closethe doors. Sienna Brooks was close on her heels, struggling with her heavy, wetburka as she lumbered up the stairs.Bounding after them, Langdon could feel a tidal wave of terrified concertgoerssurging up behind him.“Seal the exit!” Sinskey shouted again.Langdon’s long legs carried him three steps at a time, gaining fast on Sienna.Above, he could see the cistern’s heavy double doors begin to swing inward.Too slow.Sienna overtook Sinskey, grabbing her shoulder and using it as leverage tolaunch past her, clambering wildly over her toward the exit. Sinskey stumbledforward onto her knees, her beloved amulet hitting the cement stairs andbreaking in half.Langdon fought the instinct to stop and help the fallen woman, but instead, hehurtled past her, sprinting toward the top landing.Sienna was only a few feet away now, almost within reach, but she had attainedthe landing, and the doors were not closing fast enough. Without breakingstride, Sienna deftly angled her slender body and leaped sideways through thenarrow opening.She was halfway through the doors when her burka snagged on a latch, halting herin her tracks, wedged in the middle of the doorway, mere inches from freedom. Asshe writhed to escape, Langdon’s hand shot out and seized a clump of her burka.He held fast, pulling back, trying to reel her in, but she wriggled franticallyand suddenly Langdon was holding only a wet clump of fabric.The doors slammed onto the fabric, barely missing Langdon’s hands. The waddedcloth was now pinched in the doorway, making it impossible for the men outsideto push the doors all the way closed.Through the narrow slit, Langdon could see Sienna Brooks sprinting across a busystreet, her bald head shining in the streetlights. She was wearing the samesweater and blue jeans she had been wearing all day, and Langdon suddenly felt afiery, upwelling sense of betrayal.The feeling lasted only an instant. A sudden, crushing weight rammed Langdonhard against the door.The stampede had arrived behind him.The stairwell echoed with shouts of terror and confusion as the sounds of thesymphony orchestra deteriorated into a confused cacophony below. Langdon couldfeel the pressure on his back increasing as the bottleneck thickened. His ribcage began to compress painfully against the door.Then the doors exploded outward, and Langdon was launched into the night like acork from a bottle of champagne. He stumbled across the sidewalk, nearly fallinginto the street. Behind him, a stream of humanity was flowing up out of theearth like ants escaping from a poisoned anthill.The SRS agents, hearing the sounds of chaos, now emerged from behind thebuilding. Their appearance in full hazmat gear and respirators immediatelyamplified the panic.Langdon turned away and peered across the street after Sienna. All he could seewas traffic and lights and confusion.Then, for a fleeting instant, down the street to his left, the pale flash of abald head shone in the night, darting along a crowded sidewalk and disappearingaround a corner.Langdon shot a desperate glance behind him, searching for Sinskey, or thepolice, or an SRS agent who was not wearing a bulky hazmat suit.Nothing.Langdon knew he was on his own.Without hesitation, he sprinted after Sienna.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Far below, in the deepest recesses of the cistern, Agent Brüder stood all alonein the waist-deep water. The sounds of pandemonium echoed through the darknessas frenzied tourists and musicians shoved their way toward the exit anddisappeared up the stairs.The doors were never sealed, Brüder realized to his horror. Containment hasfailed."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 94ROBERT LANGDON WAS not a runner, but years of swimming made for powerful legs,and his stride was long. He reached the corner in a matter of seconds androunded it, finding himself on a wider avenue. His eyes urgently scanned thesidewalks.She’s got to be here!The rain had stopped, and from this corner, Langdon could clearly see the entirewell-lit street. There was nowhere to hide.And yet Sienna seemed to have vanished.Langdon came to a stop, hands on his hips, panting as he surveyed therain-soaked street before him. The only movement he saw was fifty yards ahead,where one of Istanbul’s modern otobüses was pulling away from the curb andpowering up the avenue.Did Sienna jump on a city bus?It seemed far too risky. Would she really trap herself on a bus when she kneweveryone would be looking for her? Then again, if she believed nobody had seenher round the corner, and if the bus had been just pulling away by chance,offering a perfectly timed opportunity …Maybe.Affixed to the top of the bus was a destination sign—a programmable matrix oflights displaying a single word: GALATA.Langdon rushed up the street toward an elderly man who was standing outside arestaurant under an awning. He was nicely dressed in an embroidered tunic and awhite turban.“Excuse me,” Langdon said breathless, arriving before him. “Do you speakEnglish?”“Of course,” the man said, looking unnerved by the urgency of Langdon’s tone.“Galata?! That’s a place?”“Galata?” the man replied. “Galata Bridge? Galata Tower? Galataport?”Langdon pointed to the departing otobüs. “Galata! Where is the bus going!”The man in the turban looked after the departing bus and considered it a moment.“Galata Bridge,” he replied. “It departs the old city and crosses the waterway.”Langdon groaned, his eyes making another frantic pass of the street but seeingno hint of Sienna. Sirens blared everywhere now, as emergency response vehiclestore past them in the direction of the cistern.“What’s happening?” the man demanded, looking alarmed. “Is everything okay?”Langdon took another look at the departing bus and knew it was a gamble, but hehad no other choice.“No, sir,” Langdon replied. “There’s an emergency, and I need your help.” Hemotioned to the curb, where a valet had just delivered a slick, silver Bentley.“Is that your car?”“It is, but—”“I need a ride,” Langdon said. “I know we’ve never met, but somethingcatastrophic is happening. It’s a matter of life and death.”The turbaned man stared into the professor’s eyes a long moment, as if searchinghis soul. Finally he nodded. “Then you’d better get in.”As the Bentley roared away from the curb, Langdon found himself gripping hisseat. The man was clearly an experienced driver and seemed to enjoy thechallenge of weaving in and out of traffic, playing catch-up with the bus.It took him less than three blocks to position his Bentley directly behind theotobüs. Langdon leaned forward in his seat, squinting at the rear window. Theinterior lights were dim, and the only things Langdon could make out were thevague silhouettes of the passengers.“Stay with the bus, please,” Langdon said. “And do you have a phone?”The man produced a cell phone from his pocket and handed it to his passenger,who thanked him profusely before realizing that he had no idea whom to call. Hehad no contact numbers for Sinskey or Brüder, and calling the WHO’s offices inSwitzerland could take forever.“How do I reach the local police?” Langdon asked.“One-five-five,” the man replied. “Anywhere in Istanbul.”Langdon dialed the three numbers and waited. The line seemed to ring forever.Finally a recorded voice answered, conveying both in Turkish and English thatdue to high call volume, he would need to hold. Langdon wondered if the reasonfor the call volume was the crisis at the cistern.The sunken palace was now probably in a state of total pandemonium. He picturedBrüder wading out in the lagoon and wondered what he had discovered out there.Langdon had a sinking feeling he already knew.Sienna had gotten into the water before him.Up ahead, the bus’s brake lights flashed, and the transport pulled over to acurbside bus stop. The Bentley’s driver pulled over as well, idling about fiftyfeet behind the bus, providing Langdon a perfect view of the passengers gettingon and off. Only three people disembarked—all of them men—and yet Langdonstudied each carefully, fully aware of Sienna’s skills for disguise.His eyes shifted again to the rear window. It was tinted, but the lights insidewere now fully illuminated, and Langdon could see the people on board moreclearly. He leaned forward, craning his neck, holding his face close to theBentley’s windshield as he searched for Sienna.Please don’t tell me I gambled wrong!Then he saw her.In the rearmost part of the vehicle, facing away from him, a pair of slendershoulders sloped up to the back of a shaved head.It could only be Sienna.As the bus accelerated, the interior lights faded once more. In the fleetingsecond before it disappeared into darkness, the head turned backward, glancingout the rear window.Langdon lowered himself down in the seat, into the shadows of the Bentley. Didshe see me? His turbaned driver was already pulling out again, tailing the bus.The road was descending toward the water now, and up ahead Langdon could see thelights of a low-slung bridge that stretched out over the water. The bridgelooked completely deadlocked with traffic. In fact, the entire area near itsentrance looked congested.“Spice Bazaar,” the man said. “Very popular on rainy nights.”The man pointed down to the water’s edge, where an incredibly long building satin the shadow of one of Istanbul’s more spectacular mosques—the New Mosque, ifLangdon were not mistaken, judging from the height of its famed twin minarets.The Spice Bazaar looked larger than most American malls, and Langdon could seepeople streaming in and out of its enormous arched doorway.“Alo?!” a tiny voice declared somewhere in the car. “Acil Durum! Alo?!”Langdon glanced down at the phone in his hand. The police.“Yes, hello!” Langdon blurted, raising the receiver. “My name is Robert Langdon.I’m working with the World Health Organization. You have a major crisis at thecity cistern, and I’m tailing the person responsible. She’s on a bus near theSpice Bazaar, heading for—”“One moment, please,” the operator said. “Let me connect you with dispatch.”“No, wait!” But Langdon was on hold again.The Bentley’s driver turned to him with a look of fear. “A crisis at thecistern?!”Langdon was about to explain when the driver’s face suddenly glowed red, like ademon.Brake lights!The driver’s head whipped around and the Bentley skidded to a stop directlybehind the bus. The interior lights flickered on again and Langdon could seeSienna as plain as day. She was standing at the back door, yanking repeatedly onthe emergency stop cord and banging to get off the bus.She saw me, Langdon realized. No doubt Sienna had also seen the traffic onGalata Bridge and knew she could not afford to get caught in it.Langdon opened his door in a flash, but Sienna had already bolted from the busand was sprinting into the night. Langdon tossed the cell phone back to itsowner. “Tell the police what happened! Tell them to surround this area!”The turbaned man gave a frightened nod.“And thank you!” Langdon shouted. “Teşekkürler!”With that, Langdon dashed down the hill after Sienna, who was running directlytoward the crowds milling around the Spice Bazaar."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 95ISTANBUL’S THREE-HUNDRED-YEAR-OLD SPICE Bazaar is one of the largest coveredmarketplaces in the world. Built in the shape of an L, the sprawling complex haseighty-eight vaulted rooms divided into hundreds of stalls, where localmerchants zealously hawk a mind-boggling array of edible pleasures from aroundthe world—spices, fruits, herbs, and Istanbul’s ubiquitous candylike confection,Turkish delight.The bazaar’s entryway—a massive stone portal with a Gothic arch—is located onthe corner of Çiçek Pazari and Tahmis Street, and is said to witness the passageof more than three hundred thousand visitors a day.Tonight, as Langdon approached the swarming entrance, he felt as if all threehundred thousand were here at that very moment. He was still running hard, hiseyes never leaving Sienna. She was now only twenty yards ahead of him, racingdirectly toward the bazaar’s gateway and showing no signs of stopping.Sienna reached the arched portal and came up hard against the crowd. She snakedthrough the people, clawing her way inside. The moment she crossed thethreshold, she stole a glance backward. Langdon saw in her eyes a frightenedlittle girl, running scared … desperate and out of control.“Sienna!” he shouted.But she plunged into the sea of humanity and was gone.Langdon dove in after her, bumping, pushing, craning his neck until he spottedher weaving down the bazaar’s western hallway to his left.Burgeoning casks of exotic spices lined the way—Indian curry, Iranian saffron,Chinese flower tea—their dazzling colors creating a tunnel of yellows, browns,and golds. With every step, Langdon smelled a new aroma—pungent mushrooms,bitter roots, musky oils—all wafting through the air with a deafening chorus oflanguages from around the world. The result was an overwhelming rush of sensorystimuli … set against the unceasing thrum of people.Thousands of people.A wrenching feeling of claustrophobia gripped Langdon, and he almost pulled upbefore gathering himself again and forcing his way deeper into the bazaar. Hecould see Sienna just ahead, pushing through the masses with adamant force. Sheclearly was taking this ride to the end … wherever that might be for her.For a moment Langdon wondered why he was chasing her.For justice? Considering what Sienna had done, Langdon could not begin to fathomwhat kind of punishment awaited her if she were caught.To prevent a pandemic? Whatever had been done was done.As Langdon pushed through the ocean of strangers, he suddenly realized why hewanted so badly to stop Sienna Brooks.I want answers.Only ten yards ahead, Sienna was headed for an exit door at the end of thewestern arm of the bazaar. She stole another quick glance behind her, lookingalarmed to see Langdon so close. As she turned again, facing front, she trippedand fell.Sienna’s head snapped forward, colliding with the shoulder of the person infront of her. As he went down, her right hand shot out, searching for anythingto break her fall. She found only the rim of a barrel of dried chestnuts, whichshe seized in desperation, pulling it over on top of her and sending a landslideof nuts across the floor.It took Langdon three strides to reach the spot where she had fallen. He lookeddown at the floor but saw only the toppled barrel and the chestnuts. No Sienna.The shopkeeper was screaming wildly.Where did she go?!Langdon spun in a circle, but Sienna had somehow vanished. By the time his gazelanded on the western exit only fifteen yards ahead, he knew that her dramaticfall had been anything but accidental.Langdon raced to the exit and burst out into an enormous plaza, also crowdedwith people. He stared into the plaza, searching in vain.Directly ahead, on the far side of a multilane highway, Galata Bridge stretchedout across the wide waters of the Golden Horn. The dual minarets of the NewMosque rose to Langdon’s right, shining brightly over the plaza. And to his leftwas nothing but open plaza … packed with people.The sound of blaring car horns drew Langdon’s gaze ahead again, toward thehighway that separated the plaza from the water. He saw Sienna, already ahundred yards away, darting through speeding traffic and narrowly avoiding beingcrushed between two trucks. She was headed for the sea.To Langdon’s left, on the banks of the Golden Horn, a transportation hub bustledwith activity—ferry docks, otobüses, taxis, tour boats.Langdon sprinted hard across the plaza toward the highway. When he reached theguardrail, he timed his leap with the oncoming headlights and safely boundedacross the first of several two-lane highways. For fifteen seconds, assaulted byblinding headlights and angry car horns, Langdon managed to advance from medianto median—stopping, starting, weaving, until he finally vaulted over the finalguardrail onto the grassy banks of the sea.Although he could still see her, Sienna was a long way ahead, eschewing the taxistand and idling buses and heading directly for the docks, where Langdon saw allmanner of boats moving in and out—tourist barges, water taxis, private fishingboats, speedboats. Out across the water, city lights twinkled on the westernside of the Golden Horn, and Langdon had no doubt that if Sienna reached theother side, there would be no hope of finding her, probably ever.When Langdon finally reached the waterfront, he turned left and dashed along theboardwalk, drawing startled looks from tourists who were queued up waiting toboard a flotilla of gaudily decorated dinner barges, complete with mosquelikedomes, faux-gold flourishes, and blinking neon trim.Las Vegas on the Bosporus, Langdon moaned, powering past.He saw Sienna far ahead, and she was no longer running. She was stopped on thedock in an area cluttered by private powerboats, pleading with one of theowners.Don’t let her aboard!As he closed the gap, he could see that Sienna’s appeal was directed at a youngman who stood at the helm of a sleek powerboat that was just preparing to pullaway from the dock. The man was smiling but politely shaking his head no. Siennacontinued gesticulating, but the boater appeared to decline with finality, andhe turned back to his controls.As Langdon dashed closer, Sienna glanced at him, her face a mask of desperation.Below her, the boat’s twin outboards revved, churning the water and moving thecraft away from the dock.Sienna was suddenly airborne, leaping off the dock over the open water. Shelanded with a crash on the boat’s fiberglass stern. Feeling the impact, thedriver turned with an expression of disbelief on his face. He yanked back thethrottle, idling the boat, which was now twenty yards from the dock. Yellingangrily, he marched back toward his unwanted passenger.As the driver advanced on her, Sienna effortlessly stepped aside, seizing theman’s wrist and using his own momentum to launch him up and over the sterngunwale. The man plunged headlong into the water. Moments later, he rose to thesurface, sputtering and thrashing wildly, and shouting a string of what were nodoubt Turkish obscenities.Sienna seemed detached as she tossed a flotation cushion into the water, movedto the helm of the boat, and pushed the dual throttles forward.The engines roared and the boat sped off.Langdon stood on the dock, catching his breath as he watched the sleek whitehull skimming away across the water, becoming a ghostly shadow in the night.Langdon raised his eyes toward the horizon and knew that Sienna now had accessnot only to the distant shores, but also to an almost endless web of waterwaysthat stretched from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.She’s gone.Nearby, the boat’s owner climbed out of the water, got to his feet, and hurriedoff to call the police.Langdon felt starkly alone as he watched the lights of the stolen boat growingfaint. The whine of the powerful engines was growing distant as well.And then the engines faded abruptly to silence.Langdon peered into the distance. Did she kill the motor?The boat’s lights seemed to have stopped receding and were now bobbing gently inthe small waves of the Golden Horn. For some unknown reason, Sienna Brooks hadstopped.Did she run out of gas?He cupped his hands and listened, now able to hear the faint thrum of herengines idling.If she’s not out of gas, what is she doing?Langdon waited.Ten seconds. Fifteen seconds. Thirty seconds.Then, without warning, the engines revved up again, reluctantly at first, andthen more decidedly. To Langdon’s bewilderment, the boat’s lights began bankinginto a wide turn, and the bow swung around toward him.She’s coming back.As the boat approached, Langdon could see Sienna at the wheel, staring blanklyahead. Thirty yards away, she throttled down and eased the boat safely back tothe dock it had just left. Then she killed the engines.Silence.Above her, Langdon stared down in disbelief.Sienna never looked up.Instead, she buried her face in her hands. She began trembling, her shouldershunched and shuddering. When she finally looked at Langdon, her eyes wereoverflowing with tears.“Robert,” she sobbed. “I can’t run away anymore. I have nowhere left to go.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 96IT’S OUT.Elizabeth Sinskey stood at the bottom of the cistern stairwell and gazed at thevoid of the evacuated cavern. Her breathing felt strained through the respiratorshe was wearing. Although she had probably already been exposed to whateverpathogen might be down here, Sinskey felt relieved to be wearing a hazmat suitas she and the SRS team entered the desolate space. They were dressed in bulbouswhite jumpsuits that locked into airtight helmets, and the group looked like ateam of astronauts breaching an alien spacecraft.Sinskey knew that upstairs on the street, hundreds of frightened concertgoersand musicians were huddling in confusion, many being treated for injuriessuffered in the stampede. Others had fled the area entirely. She felt lucky tohave escaped with only a bruised knee and a broken amulet.Only one form of contagion travels faster than a virus, Sinskey thought. Andthat’s fear.The doors upstairs were now locked, hermetically sealed, and guarded by localauthorities. Sinskey had anticipated a jurisdictional showdown with the arrivinglocal police, but any potential conflicts had evaporated instantly when they sawthe SRS team’s biohazard gear and heard Sinskey’s warnings of a possible plague.We’re on our own, the director of the WHO thought, staring out at the forest ofcolumns reflected in the lagoon. Nobody wants to come down here.Behind her, two agents were stretching a huge polyurethane sheet across thebottom of the stairwell and sealing it to the wall with a heat gun. Two othershad found an open area of boardwalk planks and had begun setting up an array ofelectronic gear as if preparing to analyze a crime scene.That’s exactly what this is, Sinskey thought. A crime scene.She again pictured the woman in the wet burka who had fled the cistern. By allappearances, Sienna Brooks had risked her own life in order to sabotage theWHO’s containment efforts and fulfill Zobrist’s twisted mission. She came downhere and broke the Solublon bag …Langdon had chased Sienna off into the night, and Sinskey had still not receivedword regarding what had happened to either of them.I hope Professor Langdon is safe, she thought.image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Agent Brüder stood dripping on the boardwalk, staring blankly out at theinverted head of Medusa and wondering how to proceed.As an SRS agent, Brüder had been trained to think on the macrocosmic level,setting aside any immediate ethical or personal concerns and focusing on savingas many lives as possible over the long term. Threats to his own health hadbarely registered on him until this moment. I waded into this stuff, he thought,chastising himself for the risky action he had taken and yet knowing he’d hadlittle choice. We needed an immediate assessment.Brüder forced his thoughts to the task at hand—implement Plan B. Unfortunately,in a containment crisis, Plan B was always the same: widen the radius. Fightingcommunicable disease was often like fighting a forest fire: sometimes you had todrop back and surrender a battle in hopes of winning the war.At this point, Brüder had still not given up the idea that a full containmentwas possible. Most likely Sienna Brooks had ruptured the bag only minutes beforethe mass hysteria and evacuation. If that were true, even though hundreds ofpeople had fled the scene, everyone might have been located far enough away fromthe source to avoid contamination.Everyone except Langdon and Sienna, Brüder realized. Both of whom were here atground zero, and are now someplace out in the city.Brüder had another concern as well—a gap in logic that continued to nag at him.While in the water, he had never found the actual breached Solublon bag. Itseemed to Brüder that if Sienna had broken the bag—by kicking it or ripping itor whatever she had done—he would have found the damaged, deflated remnantsfloating somewhere in the area.But Brüder had found nothing. Any remains of the bag seemed to have vanished.Brüder strongly doubted that Sienna would have carried off the Solublon bag withher, since by this point it would have been no more than a slimy, dissolvingmess.So where did it go?Brüder had an uneasy sense that he was missing something. Even so, he focused ona new containment strategy, which required him to answer one critical question.What is the contagion’s current dispersal radius?Brüder knew the question would be answered in a matter of minutes. His team hadset up a series of portable virus-detection devices along the boardwalks atincreasing distances from the lagoon. These devices—known as PCR units—used whatwas called a polymerase chain reaction to detect the presence of viralcontamination.The SRS agent remained hopeful. With no movement of the water in the lagoon, andthe passage of very little time, he was confident that the PCR devices woulddetect a relatively small region of contamination, which they could then attackwith chemicals and the use of suction.“Ready?” a technician called out through a megaphone.Agents stationed around the cistern gave the thumbs-up.“Run your samples,” the megaphone crackled.Throughout the cavern, analysts crouched down and started their individual PCRmachines. Each device began analyzing a sample from the point at which itsoperator was located on the boardwalk, spaced in ever-widening arcs aroundZobrist’s plaque.A hush fell across the cistern as everyone waited, praying to see only greenlights.And then it happened.On the machine closest to Brüder, a virus-detection light began flashing red.His muscles tensed, and his eyes shifted to the next machine.It, too, began blinking red.No.Stunned murmurs reverberated throughout the cavern. Brüder watched in horror as,one by one, every PCR device began blinking red, all the way across the cisternto the entrance.Oh, God … he thought. The sea of blinking red detection lights painted anunmistakable picture.The radius of contamination was enormous.The entire cistern was teeming with virus."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 97ROBERT LANGDON STARED down at Sienna Brooks, huddled at the wheel of the stolenpowerboat, and struggled to make sense of what he had just witnessed.“I’m sure you despise me,” she sobbed, looking up at him through tearful eyes.“Despise you?!” Langdon exclaimed. “I don’t have the slightest idea who you are!All you’ve done is lie to me!”“I know,” she said softly. “I’m sorry. I’ve been trying to do the right thing.”“By releasing a plague?”“No, Robert, you don’t understand.”“I do understand!” Langdon replied. “I understand you waded out into the waterto break that Solublon bag! You wanted to release Zobrist’s virus before anyonecould contain it!”“Solublon bag?” Sienna’s eyes flashed confusion. “I don’t know what you’retalking about. Robert, I went to the cistern to stop Bertrand’s virus … to stealit and make it disappear forever … so nobody could ever study it, including Dr.Sinskey and the WHO.”“Steal it? Why keep it from the WHO?”Sienna took a long breath. “There’s so much you don’t know, but it’s all mootnow. We arrived much too late, Robert. We never had a chance.”“Of course we had a chance! The virus was not going to be released untiltomorrow! That’s the date Zobrist chose, and if you hadn’t gone into the water—”“Robert, I didn’t release the virus!” Sienna yelled. “When I went into thewater, I was trying to find it, but it was too late. There was nothing there.”“I don’t believe you,” Langdon said.“I know you don’t. And I don’t blame you.” She reached into her pocket andpulled out a soggy pamphlet. “But maybe this will help.” She tossed the paper toLangdon. “I found this just before I waded into the lagoon.”He caught it and opened it up. It was a concert program for the cistern’s sevenperformances of the Dante Symphony.“Look at the dates,” she said.Langdon read the dates and then reread them, puzzled by what he saw. For somereason, he had been under the impression that this evening’s performance wasopening night—the first of seven performances to be given during the week,designed to lure people into a plague-infested cistern. This program, however,told a different story.“Tonight was closing night?” Langdon asked, glancing up from the paper. “Theorchestra has been playing all week?”Sienna nodded. “I was as surprised as you are.” She paused, her eyes somber.“The virus is already out, Robert. It has been for a week.”“That can’t be true,” Langdon argued. “Tomorrow is the date. Zobrist even made aplaque with tomorrow’s date on it.”“Yes, I saw the plaque in the water.”“Then you know he was fixated on tomorrow.”Sienna sighed. “Robert, I knew Bertrand well, better than I ever admitted toyou. He was a scientist, a results-oriented person. I now realize that the dateon the plaque is not the virus’s release date. It’s something else, somethingmore important to his goal.”“And that would be …?”Sienna gazed up solemnly from the boat. “It’s a global-saturation date—amathematical projection of the date after which his virus will have propagatedacross the world … and infected every individual.”The prospect sent a visceral tremor through Langdon, and yet he couldn’t helpbut suspect that she was lying. Her story contained a fatal flaw, and SiennaBrooks had already proven she’d lie about anything.“One problem, Sienna,” he said, staring down at her. “If this plague has alreadyspread all over the world, then why aren’t people getting sick?”Sienna glanced away, suddenly unable to meet his gaze.“If this plague has been out a week,” Langdon repeated, “why aren’t peopledying?”She turned slowly back to him. “Because … ” she began, the words catching in herthroat. “Bertrand didn’t create a plague.” Her eyes welled up again with tears.“He created something far more dangerous.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 98DESPITE THE FLOW of oxygen that passed through her respirator, Elizabeth Sinskeyfelt light-headed. Five minutes had passed since Brüder’s PCR devices hadrevealed the horrifying truth.Our window for containment closed long ago.The Solublon bag had apparently dissolved sometime last week, most likely on theopening night of the concert, which Sinskey now knew had been playing for sevennights straight. The few remaining shreds of Solublon attached to the tether hadnot disappered, only because they had been coated with an adhesive to helpsecure them to the tether’s clasp.The contagion has been out for a week.Now, with no possibility of isolating the pathogen, the SRS agents huddled oversamples in the cistern’s makeshift lab and assumed their usual fallbackposition—analysis, classification, and threat assessment. So far, the PCR unitshad revealed only one solid piece of data, and the discovery surprised no one.The virus was now airborne.The contents of the Solublon bag had apparently bubbled up to the surface andaerosolized viral particles into the air. It wouldn’t take many, Sinskey knew.Especially in such an enclosed area.A virus—unlike a bacteria or chemical pathogen—could spread through a populationwith astounding speed and penetration. Parasitic in their behavior, virusesentered an organism and attached to a host cell in a process called adsorption.They then injected their own DNA or RNA into that cell, recruiting the invadedcell, and forcing it to replicate multiple versions of the virus. Once asufficient number of copies existed, the new virus particles would kill the celland burst through the cell wall, speeding off to find new host cells to attack,and the process would be repeated.An infected individual would then exhale or sneeze, sending respiratory dropletsout of his body; these droplets would remain suspended in the air until theywere inhaled by other hosts, and the process began all over again.Exponential growth, Sinskey mused, recalling Zobrist’s graphs illustrating thehuman population explosion. Zobrist is using the exponential growth of virusesto combat the exponential growth of people.The burning question now, however, was: How would this virus behave?Coldly stated: How will it attack its host?The Ebola virus impaired the blood’s ability to coagulate, resulting inunstoppable hemorrhaging. The hantavirus triggered the lungs to fail. A wholehost of viruses known as oncoviruses caused cancer. And the HIV virus attackedthe immune system, causing the disease AIDS. It was no secret in the medicalcommunity that, had the HIV virus gone airborne, it could have been anextinction event.So what the hell does Zobrist’s virus do?Whatever it did, the effects clearly took time to reveal themselves … and nearbyhospitals had reported no cases of patients showing symptoms that were out ofthe ordinary.Impatient for answers, Sinskey moved toward the lab. She saw Brüder standingnear the stairwell, having found a faint signal for his cell phone. He wasspeaking to someone in hushed tones.She hurried over, arriving just as he was finishing his call.“Okay, understood,” Brüder said, the look on his face expressing an emotionbetween disbelief and terror. “And once again, I cannot stress strongly enoughthe confidentiality of this information. Your eyes only at this point. Call mewhen you know more. Thanks.” He hung up.“What’s going on?” Sinskey demanded.Brüder blew out a slow breath. “I just spoke to an old friend of mine who is atop virologist at the CDC in Atlanta.”Sinskey bristled. “You alerted the CDC without my authorization?”“I made a judgment call,” he replied. “My contact will be discreet, and we’regoing to need far better data than we can get from this makeshift lab.”Sinskey glanced over at the handful of SRS agents who were taking water samplesand huddling over portable electronics. He’s right.“My CDC contact,” Brüder continued, “is standing in a fully equippedmicrobiology lab and has already confirmed the existence of an extremelycontagious and never-before-seen viral pathogen.”“Hold on!” Sinskey interjected. “How did you get him a sample so fast?”“I didn’t,” Brüder said tautly. “He tested his own blood.”Sinskey needed only a moment for the meaning to register.It’s already gone global."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 99LANGDON WALKED SLOWLY, feeling strangely disembodied, as if he were movingthrough a particularly vivid nightmare. What could be more dangerous than aplague?Sienna had said nothing more since she had climbed out of the boat and motionedfor Langdon to follow her away from the docks, along a quiet gravel path,farther away from the water and the crowds.Although Sienna’s tears had stopped, Langdon sensed a torrent of emotionbuilding up within her. He could hear sirens wailing in the distance, but Siennaappeared not to notice. She was staring blankly at the ground, seeminglyhypnotized by the rhythmic crunch of the gravel beneath their feet.They entered a small park, and Sienna guided him into a dense grove of trees,where they were hidden away from the world. Here they sat on a bench thatoverlooked the water. On the far shore, the ancient Galata Tower glistened abovethe quiet residences that dotted the hillside. The world looked strangelypeaceful from here, a far cry, Langdon imagined, from what was probablytranspiring at the cistern. By now, he suspected, Sinskey and the SRS team hadrealized that they had arrived too late to stop the plague.Beside him, Sienna stared out across the sea. “I don’t have much time, Robert,”she said. “The authorities will eventually figure out where I went. But beforethey do, I need you to hear the truth … all of it.”Langdon gave her a silent nod.Sienna wiped her eyes and shifted on the bench to face him fully. “BertrandZobrist …” she began. “He was my first love. He became my mentor.”“I’ve already been told, Sienna,” Langdon said.She gave him a startled look but continued speaking, as if afraid to lose hermomentum. “I met him at an impressionable age, and his ideas and intellectbewitched me. Bertrand believed, as I do, that our species is on the brink ofcollapse … that we’re facing a horrifying end, which is racing toward us so muchfaster than anyone dares accept.”Langdon made no reply.“My entire childhood,” Sienna said, “I wanted to save the world. And all I wasever told was: ‘You can’t save the world, so don’t sacrifice your happinesstrying.’ ” She paused, her face taut, holding back tears. “Then I met Bertrand—abeautiful, brilliant man who told me not only that saving the world was possible… but that doing so was a moral imperative. He introduced me to an entire circleof like-minded individuals—people of staggering abilities and intellect … peoplewho really could change the future. For the first time in my life, I no longerfelt all alone, Robert.”Langdon offered a soft smile, sensing the pain in her words.“I’ve endured some terrible things in my life,” Sienna continued, her voiceincreasingly unsteady. “Things I’ve had trouble moving past …” She broke hisgaze and ran an anxious palm across her bald scalp before collecting herself andturning back to him. “And maybe that’s why the only thing that keeps me going ismy belief that we are capable of being better than we are … capable of takingaction to avoid a catastrophic future.”“And Bertrand believed that, too?” Langdon asked.“Absolutely. Bertrand had boundless hope for humankind. He was a Transhumanistwho believed we are living on the threshold of a glittering ‘posthuman’ age—anera of true transformation. He had the mind of a futurist, eyes that could seedown the road in ways few others could even imagine. He understood theastonishing powers of technology and believed that in the span of severalgenerations, our species would become a different animal entirely—geneticallyenhanced to be healthier, smarter, stronger, even more compassionate.” Shepaused. “Except for one problem. He didn’t think we’d live long enough as aspecies to realize that possibility.”“Due to overpopulation …” Langdon said.She nodded. “The Malthusian catastrophe. Bertrand used to tell me he felt likeSt. George trying to slay the chthonic monster.”Langdon didn’t follow her meaning. “Medusa?”“Metaphorically, yes. Medusa and the entire class of chthonic deities liveunderground because they’re associated directly with Mother Earth. In allegory,chthonics are always symbols of—”“Fertility,” Langdon said, startled that the parallel had not occurred to himearlier. Fruitfulness. Population.“Yes, fertility,” Sienna replied. “Bertrand used the term ‘chthonic monster’ torepresent the ominous threat of our own fecundity. He described ouroverproduction of offspring as a monster looming on the horizon … a monster weneeded to contain immediately, before it consumed us all.”Our own virility stalks us, Langdon realized. The chthonic monster. “AndBertrand battled this monster … how?”“Please understand,” she said defensively, “these are not easy problems tosolve. Triage is always a messy process. A man who severs the leg of athree-year-old child is a horrific criminal … until that man is a doctor whosaves the child from gangrene. Sometimes the only choice is the lesser of twoevils.” She began tearing up again. “I believe Bertrand had a noble goal … buthis methods …” She looked away, on the verge of breaking down.“Sienna,” Langdon whispered gently. “I need to understand all of this. I needyou to explain to me what Bertrand did. What did he release into the world?”Sienna faced him again, her soft brown eyes radiating a darker fear. “Hereleased a virus,” she whispered. “A very specific kind of virus.”Langdon held his breath. “Tell me.”“Bertrand created something known as a viral vector. It’s a virus intentionallydesigned to install genetic information into the cell it’s attacking.” Siennapaused to let him process the idea. “A vector virus … rather than killing itshost cell … inserts a piece of predetermined DNA into that cell, essentiallymodifying the cell’s genome.”Langdon struggled to grasp her meaning. This virus changes our DNA?“The insidious nature of this virus,” Sienna continued, “is that none of us knowit has infected us. No one gets sick. It causes no overt symptoms to suggestthat it’s changing us genetically.”For a moment Langdon could feel the blood pulsing in his veins. “And whatchanges does it make?”Sienna closed her eyes for a moment. “Robert,” she whispered, “as soon as thisvirus was released into the cistern’s lagoon, a chain reaction began. Everyperson who descended into that cavern and breathed the air became infected. Theybecame viral hosts … unwitting accomplices who transferred the virus to others,sparking an exponential proliferation of disease that will now have torn acrossthe planet like a forest fire. By now, the virus will have penetrated the globalpopulation. You, me … everyone.”Langdon rose from the bench and began pacing frantically before her. “And whatdoes it do to us?” he repeated.Sienna was silent for a long moment. “The virus has the ability to render thehuman body … infertile.” She shifted uncomfortably. “Bertrand created asterility plague.”Her words struck Langdon hard. A virus that makes us infertile? Langdon knewthere existed viruses that could cause sterility, but a highly contagiousairborne pathogen that could do so by altering us genetically seemed to belongin another world … some kind of Orwellian dystopia of the future.“Bertrand often theorized about a virus like this,” Sienna said quietly, “but Inever imagined he would attempt to create it … much less succeed. When I got hisletter and learned what he had done, I was in shock. I tried desperately to findhim, to beg him to destroy his creation. But I arrived too late.”“Hold on,” Langdon interjected, finally finding his voice. “If the virus makeseveryone on earth infertile, there will be no new generations, and the humanrace will start dying out … immediately.”“Correct,” she responded, her voice sounding small. “Except extinction was notBertrand’s goal—quite the opposite, in fact—which is why he created a randomlyactivating virus. Even though Inferno is now endemic in all human DNA and willbe passed along by all of us from this generation forward, it will ‘activate’only in a certain percentage of people. In other words, the virus is now carriedby everyone on earth, and yet it will cause sterility in only a randomlyselected part of the population.”“What … part?” Langdon heard himself say, incredulous even to be asking such aquestion.“Well, as you know, Bertrand was fixated on the Black Death—the plague thatindiscriminately killed one third of the European population. Nature, hebelieved, knew how to cull itself. When Bertrand did the math on infertility, hewas exhilarated to discover that the plague’s death rate of one in three seemedto be the precise ratio required to start winnowing the human population at amanageable rate.”That’s monstrous, Langdon thought.“The Black Plague thinned the herd and paved the way for the Renaissance,” shesaid, “and Bertrand created Inferno as a kind of modern-day catalyst for globalrenewal—a Transhumanist Black Death—the difference being that those manifestingthe disease, rather than perishing, would simply become infertile. AssumingBertrand’s virus has taken hold, one third of the world’s population is nowsterile … and one third of the population will continue to be sterile for alltime. The effect would be similar to that of a recessive gene … which getspassed along to all offspring, and yet exerts its influence in only a smallpercentage of them.”Sienna’s hands were shaking as she continued. “In Bertrand’s letter to me, hesounded quite proud, saying he considered Inferno to be a very elegant andhumane resolution of the problem.” Fresh tears formed in her eyes, and she wipedthem away. “Compared to the virulence of the Black Death, I admit there is somecompassion in this approach. There will be no hospitals overflowing with thesick and dying, no bodies rotting in the streets, and no anguished survivorsenduring the death of loved ones. Humans will simply stop having so many babies.Our planet will experience a steady reduction in our birth rate until thepopulation curve actually inverts, and our total numbers begin to decrease.” Shepaused. “The result will be far more potent than the plague, which only brieflycurbed our numbers, creating a temporary dip in the graph of human expansion.With Inferno, Bertrand created a long-term solution, a permanent solution … aTranshumanist solution. He was a germ-line genetic engineer. He solved problemsat the root level.”“It’s genetic terrorism …” Langdon whispered. “It’s changing who we are, whowe’ve always been, at the most fundamental level.”“Bertrand didn’t see it that way. He dreamed of fixing the fatal flaw in humanevolution … the fact that our species is simply too prolific. We are an organismthat, despite our unmatched intellect, cannot seem to control our own numbers.No amount of free contraception, education, or government enticement works. Wekeep having babies … whether we want to or not. Did you know the CDC justannounced that nearly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned? And, inunderdeveloped nations, that number is over seventy percent!”Langdon had seen these statistics before and yet only now was he starting tounderstand their implications. As a species, humans were like the rabbits thatwere introduced on certain Pacific islands and allowed to reproduce unchecked tothe point that they decimated their ecosystem and finally went extinct.Bertrand Zobrist has redesigned our species … in an attempt to save us …transforming us into a less fruitful population.Langdon took a deep breath and stared out at the Bosporus, feeling as ungroundedas the boats sailing in the distance. The sirens were growing still louder,coming from the direction of the docks, and Langdon sensed that time was runningout.“The most frightening thing of all,” Sienna said, “is not that Inferno causessterility, but rather that it has the ability to do so. An airborne viral vectoris a quantum leap—years ahead of its time. Bertrand has suddenly lifted us outof the dark ages of genetic engineering and launched us headlong into thefuture. He has unlocked the evolutionary process and given humankind the abilityto redefine our species in broad, sweeping strokes. Pandora is out of the box,and there’s no putting her back in. Bertrand has created the keys to modify thehuman race … and if those keys fall into the wrong hands, then God help us. Thistechnology should never have been created. As soon as I read Bertrand’s letterexplaining how he had achieved his goals, I burned it. Then I vowed to find hisvirus and destroy all traces of it.”“I don’t understand,” Langdon declared, his voice laced with anger. “If youwanted to destroy the virus, why didn’t you cooperate with Dr. Sinskey and theWHO? You should have called the CDC or someone.”“You can’t be serious! Government agencies are the last entities on earth thatshould have access to this technology! Think about it, Robert. Throughout all ofhuman history, every groundbreaking technology ever discovered by science hasbeen weaponized—from simple fire to nuclear power—and almost always at the handsof powerful governments. Where do you think our biological weapons come from?They originate from research done at places like the WHO and CDC. Bertrand’stechnology—a pandemic virus used as a genetic vector—is the most powerful weaponever created. It paves the way for horrors we can’t yet even imagine, includingtargeted biological weapons. Imagine a pathogen that attacks only those peoplewhose genetic code contains certain ethnic markers. It could enable widespreadethnic cleansing on the genetic level!”“I see your concerns, Sienna, I do, but this technology could also be used forgood, couldn’t it? Isn’t this discovery a godsend for genetic medicine? A newway to deliver global inoculations, for example?”“Perhaps, but unfortunately, I’ve learned to expect the worst from people whohold power.”In the distance Langdon could hear the whine of a helicopter shatter the air. Hepeered through the trees back in the direction of the Spice Bazaar and saw therunning lights of an aircraft skimming up over the hill and streaking toward thedocks.Sienna tensed. “I need to go,” she said, standing up and glancing to the westtoward Atatürk Bridge. “I think I can get across the bridge on foot, and fromthere reach—”“You’re not leaving, Sienna,” he said firmly.“Robert, I came back because I felt I owed you an explanation. Now you have it.”“No, Sienna,” Langdon said. “You came back because you’ve been running yourwhole life, and you finally realized you can’t run anymore.”Sienna seemed to shrink before him. “What choice do I have?” she asked, watchingthe helicopter scan the water. “They’ll put me in prison as soon as they findme.”“You’ve done nothing wrong, Sienna. You didn’t create this virus … nor did yourelease it.”“True, but I went to great lengths to prevent the World Health Organization fromfinding it. If I don’t end up in a Turkish prison, I’ll face some kind ofinternational tribunal on charges of biological terrorism.”As the thrum of the helicopter grew louder, Langdon looked toward the docks inthe distance. The craft was hovering in place, rotors churning the water as itssearchlight strafed the boats.Sienna looked ready to bolt at any instant.“Please listen,” Langdon said, softening his tone. “I know you’ve been through alot, and I know you’re scared, but you need to think of the big picture.Bertrand created this virus. You tried to stop it.”“But I failed.”“Yes, and now that the virus is out, the scientific and medical communities willneed to understand it fully. You’re the only person who knows anything at allabout it. Maybe there’s a way to neutralize it … or do something to prepare.”Langdon’s penetrating gaze bore into her. “Sienna, the world needs to know whatyou know. You can’t just disappear.”Sienna’s slim frame was shaking now, as if the floodgates of sorrow anduncertainty were about to burst wide. “Robert, I … I don’t know what to do. Idon’t even know who I am anymore. Look at me.” She put a hand on her bald scalp.“I’ve turned into a monster. How can I possibly face—”Langdon stepped forward and wrapped his arms around her. He could feel her bodytrembling, feel her frailty against his chest. He whispered softly in her ear.“Sienna, I know you want to run, but I’m not going to let you. Sooner or lateryou need to start trusting someone.”“I can’t …” She was sobbing. “I’m not sure I know how.”Langdon held her tighter. “You start small. You take that first tiny step. Youtrust me.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 100THE SHARP CLANG of metal on metal rang through the fuselage of the windowlessC-130 transport, causing the provost to jump. Outside, someone was banging thebutt of a pistol against the aircraft’s hatch and demanding entry.“Everyone stay seated,” the C-130 pilot commanded, moving toward the door. “It’sthe Turkish police. They just drove out to the plane.”The provost and Ferris exchanged a quick glance.From the flurry of panicked calls among the WHO staff on board, the provostsensed that their containment mission had failed. Zobrist carried out his plan,he thought. And my company made it possible.Outside the hatch, authoritative-sounding voices began shouting in Turkish.The provost jumped to his feet. “Don’t open the door!” he ordered the pilot.The pilot stopped short, glaring at the provost. “Why the hell not?”“The WHO is an international relief organization,” the provost replied, “andthis plane is sovereign territory!”The pilot shook his head. “Sir, this plane is parked at a Turkish airport, anduntil it leaves Turkish airspace, it is subject to the laws of the land.” Thepilot moved to the exit and threw open the hatch.Two uniformed men stared in. Their humorless eyes showed not the slightest hintof leniency. “Who is the captain of this aircraft?” one of them demanded in aheavy accent.“I am,” the pilot said.An officer handed the pilot two sheets of paper. “Arrest documents. These twopassengers must come with us.”The pilot skimmed the pages and glanced over at the provost and Ferris.“Call Dr. Sinskey,” the provost ordered the WHO pilot. “We’re on aninternational emergency mission.”One of the officers eyed the provost with an amused sneer. “Dr. ElizabethSinskey? Director of the World Health Organization? She is the one who orderedyour arrest.”“That can’t be,” the provost replied. “Mr. Ferris and I are here in Turkeytrying to help Dr. Sinskey.”“Then you are not doing a very good job,” the second officer replied. “Dr.Sinskey contacted us and named you both as conspirators in a bio-terrorism ploton Turkish soil.” He pulled out handcuffs. “You both are coming to headquartersfor questioning.”“I demand an attorney!” the provost shouted.Thirty seconds later, he and Ferris were shackled, muscled down the gangway, andshoved roughly into the backseat of a black sedan. The sedan raced away,skimming across the tarmac to a remote corner of the airport, where it stoppedat a chicken-wire fence that had been cut and pulled apart to allow their car topass. Once through the perimeter fence, the car bounced across a dusty wastelandof broken airport machinery and came to a halt near an old service building.The two uniformed men got out of the sedan and scanned the area. Apparentlysatisfied that they had not been followed, they stripped off their policeuniforms and tossed them aside. Then they helped Ferris and the provost out ofthe car and removed their handcuffs.The provost rubbed his wrists, realizing that he would not do well in captivity.“The car keys are under the mat,” one of the agents said, motioning to a whitevan parked nearby. “There’s a duffel in the backseat with everything yourequested—travel documents, cash, prepaid phones, clothing, as well as a fewother items we thought you might appreciate.”“Thank you,” the provost said. “You guys are good.”“Just well trained, sir.”With that, the two Turkish men got back into the black sedan and drove off.Sinskey was never going to let me walk away, the provost reminded himself.Having sensed as much while flying to Istanbul, the provost had e-mailed analert to the Consortium’s local branch, indicating that he and Ferris might needan extraction.“You think she’ll come after us?” Ferris asked.“Sinskey?” The provost nodded. “Absolutely. Although I suspect she has otherconcerns at the moment.”The two men climbed into the white van, and the provost rummaged through thecontents of the duffel, getting their documentation in order. He pulled out abaseball cap and slipped it on. Wrapped inside the cap, he found a small bottleof Highland Park single malt.These guys are good.The provost eyed the amber liquid, telling himself he should wait untiltomorrow. Then again, he pictured Zobrist’s Solublon bag and wondered whattomorrow would even look like.I broke my cardinal rule, he thought. I gave up my client.The provost felt strangely adrift, knowing that in the coming days the worldwould be blanketed with news of a catastrophe in which he had played a verysignificant role. This would not have happened without me.For the first time in his life, ignorance no longer felt like the moral highground. His fingers broke the seal on the bottle of Scotch.Enjoy it, he told himself. One way or another, your days are numbered.The provost took a deep pull on the bottle, relishing the warmth in his throat.Suddenly the darkness lit up with spotlights and the blue flashing strobes ofpolice cars, which surrounded them on all sides.The provost looked frantically in every direction … and then sat as still asstone.No escape.As armed Turkish police officers approached the van, rifles extended, theprovost took a final sip of Highland Park and quietly raised his hands over hishead.This time, he knew, the officers were not his own."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 101THE SWISS CONSULATE in Istanbul is located at One Levent Plaza in a sleek,ultramodern skyscraper. The building’s concave, blue-glass facade resembles afuturistic monolith along the skyline of the ancient metropolis.Nearly an hour had passed since Sinskey had left the cistern to set up atemporary command post in the consulate offices. The local news stations hummedwith reports of the panicked stampede at the cistern’s final performance ofLiszt’s Dante Symphony. No specifics had been reported yet, but the presence ofan international medical team wearing hazmat suits had sparked wild speculation.Sinskey stared out the window at the lights of the city and felt utterly alone.Reflexively, she reached to her neck for her amulet necklace, but there wasnothing to grasp. The broken talisman now lay on her desk in two fracturedhalves.The WHO director had just finished coordinating an array of emergency meetingsto be held in Geneva in several hours. Specialists from various agencies werealready en route, and Sinskey herself planned to fly there shortly to briefthem. Mercifully, someone on the night staff had delivered a piping-hot mug ofauthentic Turkish coffee, which Sinskey had quickly drained.A young man on the consulate staff peered in her open door. “Ma’am? RobertLangdon is here to see you.”“Thank you,” she replied. “You can send him in.”Twenty minutes earlier, Langdon had contacted Sinskey by phone and explainedthat Sienna Brooks had eluded him, having stolen a boat and fled out to sea.Sinskey had already heard this news from the authorities, who were stillsearching the area, but so far had come up empty-handed.Now, as Langdon’s tall frame materialized in the doorway, she barely recognizedhim. His suit was dirty, his dark hair tousled, and his eyes looked weary andsunken.“Professor, are you okay?” Sinskey stood up.Langdon gave her a tired smile. “I’ve had easier nights.”“Please,” she said, motioning to a chair. “Have a seat.”“Zobrist’s contagion,” Langdon began without preamble as he sat down. “I thinkit may have been released a week ago.”Sinskey gave a patient nod. “Yes, we’ve come to the same conclusion. No symptomshave been reported yet, but we’ve isolated samples and are already gearing upfor intensive testing. Unfortunately, it could take days or weeks to get a realgrip on what this virus is … and what it might do.”“It’s a vector virus,” Langdon said.Sinskey cocked her head in surprise, startled to hear that he even knew theterm. “I beg your pardon?”“Zobrist created an airborne vector virus capable of modifying human DNA.”Sinskey rose abruptly, knocking her chair over in the process. That’s not evenpossible! “What would ever make you claim such a thing?”“Sienna,” Langdon replied quietly. “She told me. Half an hour ago.”Sinskey leaned her hands on her desk and stared across at Langdon with suddendistrust. “She didn’t escape?”“She certainly did,” he replied. “She was free, in a boat speeding out to sea,and she easily could have disappeared forever. But she thought better of it. Shecame back of her own volition. Sienna wants to help with this crisis.”A harsh laugh escaped Sinskey’s lips. “Forgive me if I’m not inclined to trustMs. Brooks, especially when she’s making such a far-fetched claim.”“I believe her,” Langdon said, his tone unwavering. “And if she claims that thisis a vector virus, I think you’d better take her seriously.”Sinskey felt suddenly exhausted, her mind struggling to analyze Langdon’s words.She moved to the window and stared out. A DNA-altering viral vector? Asimprobable and horrifying as the prospect sounded, she had to admit there was aneerie logic to it. After all, Zobrist was a genetic engineer and knew firsthandthat the smallest mutation in a single gene could have catastrophic effects onthe body—cancers, organ failure, and blood disorders. Even a disease asabhorrent as cystic fibrosis—which drowns its victim in mucus—was caused bynothing more than a minuscule hiccup in a regulator gene on chromosome seven.Specialists had now started treating these genetic conditions with rudimentaryvector viruses that were injected directly into the patient. These noncontagiousviruses were programmed to travel through the patient’s body and installreplacement DNA that fixed the damaged sections. This new science, however, likeall sciences, had a dark side. The effects of a vector virus could be eitherfavorable or destructive … depending on the engineer’s intentions. If a viruswere maliciously programmed to insert damaged DNA into healthy cells, theresults would be devastating. Moreover, if that destructive virus were somehowengineered to be highly contagious and airborne …The prospect made Sinskey shudder. What genetic horror has Zobrist dreamed up?How does he plan to thin the human herd?Sinskey knew that finding the answer could take weeks. The human genetic codecontained a seemingly infinite labyrinth of chemical permutations. The prospectof searching its entirety in hopes of finding Zobrist’s one specific alterationwould be like looking for a needle in a haystack … without even knowing on whatplanet that particular haystack was located.“Elizabeth?” Langdon’s deep voice pulled her back.Sinskey turned from the window and looked at him.“Did you hear me?” he asked, still seated calmly. “Sienna wanted to destroy thisvirus as much as you did.”“I sincerely doubt that.”Langdon exhaled, standing now. “I think you should listen to me. Shortly beforehis death, Zobrist wrote a letter to Sienna, telling her what he had done. Heoutlined exactly what this virus would do … how it would attack us … how itwould achieve his goals.”Sinskey froze. There’s a letter?!“When Sienna read Zobrist’s description of what he had created, she washorrified. She wanted to stop him. She considered his virus so dangerous thatshe didn’t want anybody to gain access to it, including the World HealthOrganization. Don’t you see? Sienna has been trying to destroy the virus … notrelease it.”“There’s a letter?” Sinskey demanded, her focus now singular. “With specifics?”“That’s what Sienna told me, yes.”“We need that letter! Having specifics could save us months in understandingwhat this thing is and knowing how to handle it.”Langdon shook his head. “You don’t understand. When Sienna read Zobrist’sletter, she was terrified. She burned it immediately. She wanted to be surenobody—”Sinskey smacked her hand down on the desk. “She destroyed the one thing thatcould help us prepare for this crisis? And you want me to trust her?”“I know it’s asking a lot, in light of her actions, but rather than castigatingher, it might be helpful to remember that Sienna has a unique intellect,including a rather startling capacity for recall.” Langdon paused. “What if shecan re-create enough of Zobrist’s letter to be helpful to you?”Sinskey narrowed her gaze, nodding slightly. “Well, Professor, in that case,what do you suggest I do?”Langdon motioned to her empty coffee cup. “I suggest you order more coffee … andlisten to the one condition that Sienna has requested.”Sinskey’s pulse quickened, and she glanced at the phone. “You know how to reachher?”“I do.”“Tell me what she requested.”Langdon told her, and Sinskey fell silent, considering the proposal.“I think it’s the right thing to do,” Langdon added. “And what do you have tolose?”“If everything you’re saying is true, then you have my word.” Sinskey pushed thephone toward him. “Please make the call.”To Sinskey’s surprise, Langdon ignored the phone. Instead, he stood up andheaded out the door, stating that he would be back in a minute. Puzzled, Sinskeywalked into the hall and observed him striding through the consulate’s waitingarea, pushing open the glass doors, and exiting into the elevator foyer beyond.For a moment, she thought he was leaving, but then, rather than summoning theelevator, he slipped quietly into the women’s restroom.A few moments later, he emerged with a woman who looked to be in her earlythirties. Sinskey needed a long moment to accept the fact that this was trulySienna Brooks. The pretty ponytailed woman she had seen earlier in the day hadbeen utterly transformed. She was totally bald, as if her scalp had been shavedclean.When the two entered her office, they silently took seats facing the desk.“Forgive me,” Sienna said quickly. “I know we have a lot to discuss, but first,I was hoping you would permit me to say something that I really need to say.”Sinskey noted the sadness in Sienna’s voice. “Of course.”“Ma’am,” she began, her voice frail, “you are the director of the World HealthOrganization. You know better than anyone that we are a species on the edge ofcollapse … a population out of control. For years, Bertrand Zobrist attempted toengage with influential people like yourself to discuss the impending crisis. Hevisited countless organizations that he believed could effect change—WorldwatchInstitute, the Club of Rome, Population Matters, the Council on ForeignRelations—but he never found anyone who dared engage in a meaningfulconversation about a real solution. You all responded with plans for bettercontraceptive education, tax incentives for smaller families, and even talk ofcolonizing the moon! It’s no wonder Bertrand lost his mind.”Sinskey stared at her, offering no reaction.Sienna took a deep breath. “Dr. Sinskey, Bertrand came to you personally. Hebegged you to acknowledge that we are on the brink … begged you to engage insome kind of dialogue. But rather than listening to his ideas, you called him amadman, put him on a watch list, and drove him underground.” Sienna’s voice grewheavy with emotion. “Bertrand died all alone because people like yourselfrefused to open your minds enough even to admit that our catastrophiccircumstances might actually require an uncomfortable solution. All Bertrandever did was speak the truth … and for that, he was ostracized.” Sienna wipedher eyes and gazed across the desk at Sinskey. “Believe me, I know what it’slike to feel all alone … the worst kind of loneliness in the world is theisolation that comes from being misunderstood. It can make people lose theirgrasp on reality.”Sienna stopped talking, and a strained silence followed.“That’s all I wanted to say,” she whispered.Sinskey studied her for a long while and then sat down. “Ms. Brooks,” she said,as calmly as possible, “you’re right. I may not have listened before …” Shefolded her hands on the desk and looked directly at Sienna. “But I’m listeningnow.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 102THE CLOCK IN the Swiss Consulate’s lobby had long since chimed 1 A.M.The notepad on Sinskey’s desk was now a patchwork of handwritten text,questions, and diagrams. The director of the World Health Organization hadneither moved nor spoken in more than five minutes. She stood at the window,staring out into the night.Behind her, Langdon and Sienna waited, seated in silence, cradling the last oftheir Turkish coffee, the heavy aroma of its pulverized grounds and pistachiograins filling the room.The only sound was the buzz of the fluorescent lights overhead.Sienna could feel her own heart pounding, and she wondered what Sinskey wasthinking, having now heard the truth in brutal detail. Bertrand’s virus is asterility plague. One third of the human population will be infertile.Throughout the explanation, Sienna had watched Sinskey’s range of emotions,which, while restrained, had been palpable. First, there was a stunnedacceptance of the fact that Zobrist had actually created an airborne vectorvirus. Next she had displayed fleeting hope when she learned that the virus wasnot designed to kill people. Then … slowly, there had been the spiraling horroras the truth set in, and she realized that vast portions of the earth’spopulation would be rendered sterile. It was clear that the revelation that thevirus attacked human fertility affected Sinskey on a deeply personal level.In Sienna’s case, the overwhelming emotion was relief. She had shared thecomplete contents of Bertrand’s letter with the WHO director. I have no moresecrets.“Elizabeth?” Langdon ventured.Sinskey emerged slowly from her thoughts. When she returned her gaze to them,her face was drawn. “Sienna,” she began, speaking in a flat tone, “theinformation you have provided will be very helpful in preparing a strategy todeal with this crisis. I appreciate your candor. As you know, pandemic vectorviruses have been discussed theoretically as a possible way to immunize largepopulations, but everyone believed that the technology was still many yearsaway.”Sinskey returned to her desk, where she sat down.“Forgive me,” she said, shaking her head. “This all feels like science fictionto me at the moment.”Not surprising, Sienna thought. Every quantum leap in medicine had always feltthis way—penicillin, anesthesia, X-rays, the first time humans looked through amicroscope and saw a cell divide.Dr. Sinskey gazed down at her notepad. “In a few hours, I will arrive in Genevato a firestorm of questions. I have no doubt that the first question will bewhether there is any way to counteract this virus.”Sienna suspected she was right.“And,” Sinskey continued, “I imagine the first proposed solution will be toanalyze Bertrand’s virus, understand it as best as we can, and then attempt toengineer a second strain of it—a strain that we reprogram in order to change ourDNA back to its original form.” Sinskey did not look optimistic as she turnedher gaze to Sienna. “Whether a countervirus is even possible remains to be seen,but hypothetically speaking, I’d like to hear your thoughts on that approach.”My thoughts? Sienna felt herself glance reflexively at Langdon. The professorgave her a nod, sending a very clear message: You’ve come this far. Speak yourmind. Tell the truth as you see it.Sienna cleared her throat, turned to Sinskey, and spoke in a clear, strongvoice. “Ma’am, the world of genetic engineering is one I’ve inhabited withBertrand for many years. As you know, the human genome is an extremely delicatestructure … a house of cards. The more adjustments we make, the greater thechances we mistakenly alter the wrong card and bring the entire thing crashingdown. My personal belief is that there is enormous danger in attempting to undowhat has already been done. Bertrand was a genetic engineer of exceptional skilland vision. He was years ahead of his peers. At this point in time, I’m not sureI would trust anyone else to go poking around in the human genome, hoping to getit right. Even if you designed something you thought might work, trying it wouldinvolve reinfecting the entire population with something new.”“Very true,” Sinskey said, seeming unsurprised by what she had just heard. “Butof course, there is the bigger issue. We might not even want to counteract it.”Her words caught Sienna off guard. “I’m sorry?”“Ms. Brooks, I may disagree with Bertrand’s methods, but his assessment of thestate of the world is accurate. This planet is facing a serious overpopulationissue. If we manage to neutralize Bertrand’s virus without a viable alternateplan … we are simply back at square one.”Sienna’s shock must have been apparent, because Sinskey gave her a tired chuckleand added, “Not a viewpoint you expected to hear from me?”Sienna shook her head. “I guess I’m not sure what to expect anymore.”“Then perhaps I can surprise you again,” Sinskey went on. “As I mentionedearlier, leaders from top health agencies around the world will be gathering inGeneva in a matter of hours to discuss this crisis and prepare an action plan. Ican’t recall a gathering of greater significance in all my years at the WHO.”She leveled her gaze at the young doctor. “Sienna, I would like you to have aseat at that table.”“Me?” Sienna recoiled. “I’m not a genetic engineer. I’ve told you everything Iknow.” She pointed to Sinskey’s notepad. “Everything I have to offer is rightthere in your notes.”“Not by a long shot,” Langdon interjected. “Sienna, any meaningful debate aboutthis virus will require context. Dr. Sinskey and her team will need to develop amoral framework to assess their response to this crisis. She obviously believesyou are in a unique position to add to that dialogue.”“My moral framework, I suspect, will not please the WHO.”“Probably not,” Langdon replied, “which is all the more reason for you to bethere. You are a member of a new breed of thinkers. You provide counterpoint.You can help them understand the mind-set of visionaries like Bertrand—brilliantindividuals whose convictions are so strong that they take matters into theirown hands.”“Bertrand was hardly the first.”“No,” Sinskey interjected, “and he won’t be the last. Every month, the WHOuncovers labs where scientists are dabbling in the gray areas ofscience—everything from manipulating human stem cells to breeding chimeras …blended species that don’t exist in nature. It’s disturbing. Science isprogressing so fast that nobody knows where the lines are drawn anymore.”Sienna had to agree. Just recently, two very respected virologists—Fouchier andKawaoka—had created a highly pathogenic mutant H5N1 virus. Despite theresearchers’ purely academic intent, their new creation possessed certaincapabilities that had alarmed biosecurity specialists and had created afirestorm of controversy online.“I’m afraid it’s only going to get murkier,” Sinskey said. “We’re on the vergeof new technologies that we can’t yet even imagine.”“And new philosophies as well,” Sienna added. “The Transhumanist movement isabout to explode from the shadows into the mainstream. One of its fundamentaltenets is that we as humans have a moral obligation to participate in ourevolutionary process … to use our technologies to advance the species, to createbetter humans—healthier, stronger, with higher-functioning brains. Everythingwill soon be possible.”“And you don’t think that such beliefs are in conflict with the evolutionaryprocess?”“No,” Sienna responded without hesitation. “Humans have evolved incrementallyover millennia, inventing new technologies along the way—rubbing sticks togetherfor warmth, developing agriculture to feed ourselves, inventing vaccines tofight disease, and now, creating genetic tools to help engineer our own bodiesso we can survive in a changing world.” She paused. “I believe geneticengineering is just another step in a long line of human advances.”Sinskey was silent, deep in thought. “So you believe we should embrace thesetools with open arms.”“If we don’t embrace them,” Sienna replied, “then we are as undeserving of lifeas the caveman who freezes to death because he’s afraid to start a fire.”Her words seemed to hang in the room for a long time before anyone spoke.It was Langdon who broke the silence. “Not to sound old-fashioned,” he began,“but I was raised on the theories of Darwin, and I can’t help but question thewisdom of attempting to accelerate the natural process of evolution.”“Robert,” Sienna said emphatically, “genetic engineering is not an accelerationof the evolutionary process. It is the natural course of events! What you forgetis that it was evolution that created Bertrand Zobrist. His superior intellectwas the product of the very process Darwin described … an evolution over time.Bertrand’s rare insight into genetics did not come as a flash of divineinspiration … it was the product of years of human intellectual progress.”Langdon fell silent, apparently considering the notion.“And as a Darwinist,” she continued, “you know that nature has always found away to keep the human population in check—plagues, famines, floods. But let meask you this—isn’t it possible that nature found a different way this time?Instead of sending us horrific disasters and misery … maybe nature, through theprocess of evolution, created a scientist who invented a different method ofdecreasing our numbers over time. No plagues. No death. Just a species more intune with its environment—”“Sienna,” Sinskey interrupted. “It’s late. We need to go. But before we do, Ineed to clarify one more thing. You have told me repeatedly tonight thatBertrand was not an evil man … that he loved humankind, and that he simplylonged so deeply to save our species that he was able to rationalize taking suchdrastic measures.”Sienna nodded. “The ends justify the means,” she said, quoting the notoriousFlorentine political theorist Machiavelli.“So tell me,” Sinskey said, “do you believe that the ends justify the means? Doyou believe that Bertrand’s goal to save the world was so noble that itwarranted his releasing this virus?”A tense silence settled in the room.Sienna leaned in, close to the desk, her expression forceful. “Dr. Sinskey, as Itold you, I believe Bertrand’s actions were reckless and extremely dangerous. IfI could have stopped him, I would have done so in a heartbeat. I need you tobelieve me.”Elizabeth Sinskey reached across the desk and gently grasped both of Sienna’shands in her own. “I do believe you, Sienna. I believe every word you’ve toldme.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 103THE PREDAWN AIR at Atatürk Airport was cold and laced with mist. A light fog hadsettled, hugging the tarmac around the private terminal.Langdon, Sienna, and Sinskey arrived by town car and were met outside by a WHOstaffer who helped them out of the vehicle.“We’re ready whenever you are, ma’am,” the man said, ushering the trio into amodest terminal building.“And Mr. Langdon’s arrangements?” Sinskey asked.“Private plane to Florence. His temporary travel documents are already onboard.”Sinskey nodded her appreciation. “And the other matter we discussed?”“Already in motion. The package will be shipped as soon as possible.”Sinskey thanked the man, who now headed out across the tarmac toward the plane.She turned to Langdon. “Are you sure you don’t want to join us?” She gave him atired smile and pulled back her long silver hair, tucking it behind her ears.“Considering the situation,” Langdon said playfully, “I’m not sure an artprofessor has much to offer.”“You’ve offered plenty,” Sinskey said. “More than you know. Not the least ofwhich being …” She motioned beside her to Sienna, but the young woman was nolonger with them. Sienna was twenty yards back, having paused at a large windowwhere she was staring out at the waiting C-130, apparently deep in thought.“Thanks for trusting her,” Langdon said quietly. “I sense she hasn’t had a lotof that in her life.”“I suspect Sienna Brooks and I will find plenty of things to learn from eachother.” Sinskey extended her palm. “Godspeed, Professor.”“And to you,” Langdon said as they shook hands. “Best of luck in Geneva.”“We’ll need it,” she said, and then nodded toward Sienna. “I’ll give you two amoment. Just send her out when you’re ready.”As Sinskey headed across the terminal, she reached absently into her pocket andpulled out the two halves of her broken amulet, clutching them tightly in onepalm.“Don’t give up on that rod of Asclepius,” Langdon called out behind her. “It’sfixable.”“Thanks,” Sinskey replied with a wave. “I’m hoping everything is.”image [../Images/00005.jpeg]Sienna Brooks stood alone at the window, gazing out at the lights of the runway,which looked ghostly in the low-lying fog and gathering clouds. Atop a controltower in the distance, the Turkish flag fluttered proudly—a field of redemblazoned with the ancient symbols of the crescent and star—vestiges of theOttoman Empire, still flying proudly in the modern world.“A Turkish lira for your thoughts?” a deep voice said behind her.Sienna did not turn. “A storm is coming.”“I know,” Langdon responded quietly.After a long moment, Sienna turned to him. “And I wish you were coming toGeneva.”“Nice of you to say so,” he replied. “But you’ll be busy talking about thefuture. The last thing you need is some old-fashioned college professor slowingyou down.”She gave him a puzzled look. “You think you’re too old for me, don’t you?”Langdon laughed out loud. “Sienna, I am definitely too old for you!”She shifted uncomfortably, feeling embarrassed. “Okay … but at least you’ll knowwhere to find me.” She managed a girlish shrug. “I mean … if you ever want tosee me again.”He smiled at her. “I’d enjoy that.”She felt her spirits lift a bit, and yet a long silence grew between them,neither of them quite certain how to say good-bye.As Sienna stared up at the American professor, she felt a surge of emotion shewasn’t accustomed to feeling. Without warning, she stood on her tiptoes andkissed him full on the lips. When she pulled away, her eyes were moist withtears. “I’ll miss you,” she whispered.Langdon smiled affectionately and wrapped his arms around her. “I’ll miss you,too.”They stood for a long while, locked in an embrace that neither seemed willing toend. Finally, Langdon spoke. “There’s an ancient saying … often attributed toDante himself …” He paused. “‘Remember tonight … for it’s the beginning offorever.’ ”“Thank you, Robert,” she said, as the tears began to flow. “I finally feel likeI have a purpose.”Langdon pulled her closer. “You always said you wanted to save the world,Sienna. This might just be your chance.”Sienna smiled softly and turned away. As she walked alone toward the waitingC-130, Sienna considered everything that had happened … everything that mightstill happen … and all the possible futures.Remember tonight, she repeated to herself, for it’s the beginning of forever.As Sienna climbed into the plane, she prayed that Dante was right."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 104THE PALE AFTERNOON sun dipped low over the Piazza del Duomo, glinting off thewhite tiles of Giotto’s bell tower and casting long shadows across Florence’smagnificent Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore.The funeral for Ignazio Busoni was just getting under way as Robert Langdonslipped into the cathedral and found a seat, pleased that Ignazio’s life was tobe memorialized here, in the timeless basilica that he had looked after for somany years.Despite its vibrant facade, the interior of Florence’s cathedral was stark,empty, and austere. Nonetheless, the ascetic sanctuary seemed to radiate an airof celebration today. From all over Italy, government officials, friends, andart-world colleagues had flooded into the church to remember the jovial mountainof a man they had lovingly called il Duomino.The media had reported that Busoni passed away while doing what he lovedmost—taking a late-night stroll around the Duomo.The tone of the funeral was surprisingly upbeat, with humorous commentary fromfriends and family, one colleague noting that Busoni’s love of Renaissance art,by his own admission, had been matched only by his love of spaghetti Bologneseand caramel budino.After the service, as the mourners mingled and fondly recounted incidents fromIgnazio’s life, Langdon wandered around the interior of the Duomo, admiring theartwork that Ignazio had so deeply loved … Vasari’s Last Judgment beneath thedome, Donatello and Ghiberti’s stained-glass windows, Uccello’s clock, and theoften-overlooked mosaic pavements that adorned the floor.At some point Langdon found himself standing before a familiar face—that ofDante Alighieri. Depicted in the legendary fresco by Michelino, the great poetstood before Mount Purgatory and held forth in his hands, as if in humbleoffering, his masterpiece The Divine Comedy.Langdon couldn’t help but wonder what Dante would have thought if he had knownthe effect his epic poem would have on the world, centuries later, in a futureeven the Florentine poet himself could never have envisioned.He found eternal life, Langdon thought, recalling the early Greek philosophers’views on fame. So long as they speak your name, you shall never die.It was early evening when Langdon made his way across Piazza Sant’Elisabetta andreturned to Florence’s elegant Hotel Brunelleschi. Upstairs in his room, he wasrelieved to find an oversize package waiting for him.At last, the delivery had arrived.The package I requested from Sinskey.Hurriedly, Langdon cut the tape sealing the box and lifted out the preciouscontents, reassured to see that it had been meticulously packed and wascushioned in bubble wrapping.To Langdon’s surprise, however, the box contained some additional items.Elizabeth Sinskey, it seemed, had used her substantial influence to recover abit more than he had requested. The box contained Langdon’s ownclothing—button-down shirt, khaki pants, and his frayed Harris Tweed jacket—allcarefully cleaned and pressed. Even his cordovan loafers were here, newlypolished. Inside the box, he was also pleased to find his wallet.It was the discovery of one final item, however, that made Langdon chuckle. Hisreaction was part relief that the item had been returned … and part sheepishnessthat he cared so deeply about it.My Mickey Mouse watch.Langdon immediately fastened the collector’s edition timepiece on his wrist. Thefeel of the worn leather band against his skin made him feel strangely secure.By the time he had gotten dressed in his own clothes and slipped his feet backinto his own loafers, Robert Langdon was feeling almost like himself again.Langdon exited the hotel, carrying the delicate package with him in a HotelBrunelleschi tote bag, which he had borrowed from the concierge. The evening wasunusually warm, adding to the dreamlike quality of his walk along the Via deiCalzaiuoli toward the lone spire of the Palazzo Vecchio.When he arrived, Langdon checked in at the security office, where his name wason a list to see Marta Alvarez. He was directed to the Hall of the Five Hundred,which was still bustling with tourists. Langdon had arrived right on time,expecting Marta to meet him here in the entryway, but she was nowhere to beseen.He flagged down a passing docent.“Scusi?” Langdon called. “Dove passo trovare Marta Alvarez?”The docent broke into a broad grin. “Signora Alvarez?! She no here! She havebaby! Catalina! Molto bella!”Langdon was pleased to hear Marta’s good news. “Ahh … che bello,” he replied.“Stupendo!”As the docent hurried off, Langdon wondered what he was supposed to do with thepackage he was carrying.Quickly making up his mind, he crossed the crowded Hall of the Five Hundred,passing beneath Vasari’s mural and heading up into the palazzo museum, stayingout of sight of any security guards.Finally, he arrived outside the museum’s narrow andito. The passage was dark,sealed off with stanchions, a swag, and a sign: CHIUSO/CLOSED.Langdon took a careful glance around and then slipped under the swag and intothe darkened space. He reached into his tote bag and carefully extracted thedelicate package, peeling away the bubble wrapping.When the plastic fell away, Dante’s death mask stared up at him once again. Thefragile plaster was still in its original Ziploc bag, having been retrieved asLangdon had requested from the lockers at the Venice train station. The maskappeared to be in flawless condition with one small exception—the addition of apoem, inscribed in an elegant spiral shape, on its reverse side.Langdon glanced at the antique display case. The Dante death mask is displayedface front … nobody will notice.He carefully removed the mask from the Ziploc bag. Then, very gently, he liftedit back onto the peg inside the display case. The mask sank into place, nestlingagainst its familiar red velvet setting.Langdon closed the case and stood a moment, gazing at Dante’s pale visage, aghostly presence in the darkened room. Home at last.Before exiting the room, Langdon discreetly removed the stanchions, swag, andsign from the doorway. As he crossed the gallery, he paused to speak to a youngfemale docent.“Signorina?” Langdon said. “The lights above the Dante death mask need to beturned on. It’s very hard to see in the dark.”“I’m sorry,” the young woman said, “but that exhibit is closed. The Dante deathmask is no longer here.”“That’s odd.” Langdon feigned a look of surprise. “I was just admiring it.”The woman’s face registered confusion.As she rushed off toward the andito, Langdon quietly slipped out of the museum."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUETHIRTY-FOUR THOUSAND FEET above the dark expanse of the Bay of Biscay,Alitalia’s red-eye to Boston cruised westward through a moonlit night.On board, Robert Langdon sat engrossed in a paperback copy of The Divine Comedy.The rhythm of the poem’s lilting terza rima rhyme scheme, along with the hum ofthe jet engines, had lulled him into a near-hypnotic state. Dante’s words seemedto flow off the page, resonating in his heart as if they had been writtenspecifically for him in this very moment.Dante’s poem, Langdon was now reminded, was not so much about the misery of hellas it was about the power of the human spirit to endure any challenge, no matterhow daunting.Outside the window, a full moon had risen, dazzling and bright, blotting out allother heavenly bodies. Langdon gazed out at the expanse, lost in his thoughts ofall that had transpired in the last few days.The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutralityin times of moral crisis. For Langdon, the meaning of these words had never feltso clear: In dangerous times, there is no sin greater than inaction.Langdon knew that he himself, like millions, was guilty of this. When it came tothe circumstances of the world, denial had become a global pandemic. Langdonpromised himself that he would never forget this.As the plane streaked west, Langdon thought of the two courageous women who werenow in Geneva, meeting the future head-on and navigating the complexities of achanged world.Outside the window, a bank of clouds appeared on the horizon, inching slowlyacross the sky, finally slipping across the moon and blocking out its radiantlight.Robert Langdon eased back in his seat, sensing that it was time to sleep.As he clicked off his overhead light, he turned his eyes one last time to theheavens. Outside, in the newly fallen darkness, the world had been transformed.The sky had become a glistening tapestry of stars."},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHORDan Brown is the author of The Da Vinci Code, one of the most widely read novelsof all time, as well as two other international bestsellers featuring Harvardsymbologist Robert Langdon, The Lost Symbol and Angels & Demons.
