Its implications areas far-reaching and awe-inspiring as can be imagined. Even as it promisesanswers to some of our oldest questions, it poses still others even morefundamental.– President Bill Clinton, in a press conference following a discovery known asALH84001 on August 7, 1997PROLOGUEDeath, in this forsaken place, could come in countless forms. Geologist CharlesBrophy had endured the savage splendor of this terrain for years, and yetnothing could prepare him for a fate as barbarous and unnatural as the one aboutto befall him.As Brophy's four huskies pulled his sled of geologic sensing equipment acrossthe tundra, the dogs suddenly slowed, looking skyward.\"What is it, girls?\" Brophy asked, stepping off the sled.Beyond the gathering storm clouds, a twin-rotor transport helicopter arched inlow, hugging the glacial peaks with military dexterity.That's odd, he thought. He never saw helicopters this far north. The aircraftlanded fifty yards away, kicking up a stinging spray of granulated snow. Hisdogs whined, looking wary.When the chopper doors slid open, two men descended. They were dressed infull-weather whites, armed with rifles, and moved toward Brophy with urgentintent.\"Dr. Brophy?\" one called.The geologist was baffled. \"How did you know my name? Who are you?\"\"Take out your radio, please.\"\"I'm sorry?\"\"Just do it.\"Bewildered, Brophy pulled his radio from his parka.\"We need you to transmit an emergency communiqué. Decrease your radio frequencyto one hundred kilohertz.\"One hundred kilohertz? Brophy felt utterly lost. Nobody can receive anythingthat low. \"Has there been an accident?\"The second man raised his rifle and pointed it at Brophy's head. \"There's notime to explain. Just do it.\"Trembling, Brophy adjusted his transmission frequency.The first man now handed him a note card with a few lines typed on it. \"Transmitthis message. Now.\"Brophy looked at the card. \"I don't understand. This information is incorrect. Ididn't –\"The man pressed his rifle hard against the geologist's temple.Brophy's voice was shaking as he transmitted the bizarre message.\"Good,\" the first man said. \"Now get yourself and your dogs into the chopper.\"At gunpoint, Brophy maneuvered his reluctant dogs and sled up a skid ramp intothe cargo bay. As soon as they were settled, the chopper lifted off, turningwestward.\"Who the hell are you!\" Brophy demanded, breaking a sweat inside his parka. Andwhat was the meaning of that message!The men said nothing.As the chopper gained altitude, the wind tore through the open door. Brophy'sfour huskies, still rigged to the loaded sled, were whimpering now.\"At least close the door,\" Brophy demanded. \"Can't you see my dogs arefrightened!\"The men did not respond.As the chopper rose to four thousand feet, it banked steeply out over a seriesof ice chasms and crevasses. Suddenly, the men stood. Without a word, theygripped the heavily laden sled and pushed it out the open door. Brophy watchedin horror as his dogs scrambled in vain against the enormous weight. In aninstant the animals disappeared, dragged howling out of the chopper.Brophy was already on his feet screaming when the men grabbed him. They hauledhim to the door. Numb with fear, Brophy swung his fists, trying to fend off thepowerful hands pushing him outward.It was no use. Moments later he was tumbling toward the chasms below.1Toulos Restaurant, adjacent to Capitol Hill, boasts a politically incorrect menuof baby veal and horse carpaccio, making it an ironic hotspot for thequintessential Washingtonian power breakfast. This morning Toulos was busy – acacophony of clanking silverware, espresso machines, and cellphoneconversations.The maitre d' was sneaking a sip of his morning Bloody Mary when the womanentered. He turned with a practiced smile.\"Good morning,\" he said. \"May I help you?\"The woman was attractive, in her mid-thirties, wearing gray, pleated flannelpants, conservative flats, and an ivory Laura Ashley blouse. Her posture wasstraight – chin raised ever so slightly – not arrogant, just strong. The woman'shair was light brown and fashioned in Washington's most popular style – the\"anchor-woman\" – a lush feathering, curled under at the shoulders... long enoughto be sexy, but short enough to remind you she was probably smarter than you.\"I'm a little late,\" the woman said, her voice unassuming. \"I have a breakfastmeeting with Senator Sexton.\"The maitre d' felt an unexpected tingle of nerves. Senator Sedgewick Sexton. Thesenator was a regular here and currently one of the country's most famous men.Last week, having swept all twelve Republican primaries on Super Tuesday, thesenator was virtually guaranteed his party's nomination for President of theUnited States. Many believed the senator had a superb chance of stealing theWhite House from the embattled President next fall. Lately Sexton's face seemedto be on every national magazine, his campaign slogan plastered all acrossAmerica: \"Stop spending. Start mending.\"\"Senator Sexton is in his booth,\" the maitre d' said. \"And you are?\"\"Rachel Sexton. His daughter.\"How foolish of me, he thought. The resemblance was quite apparent. The woman hadthe senator's penetrating eyes and refined carriage – that polished air ofresilient nobility. Clearly the senator's classic good looks had not skippedgenerations, although Rachel Sexton seemed to carry her blessings with a graceand humility her father could learn from.\"A pleasure to have you, Ms. Sexton.\"As the maitre d' led the senator's daughter across the dining area, he wasembarrassed by the gauntlet of male eyes following her... some discreet, othersless so. Few women dined at Toulos and even fewer who looked like Rachel Sexton.\"Nice body,\" one diner whispered. \"Sexton already find himself a new wife?\"\"That's his daughter, you idiot,\" another replied.The man chuckled. \"Knowing Sexton, he'd probably screw her anyway.\"When Rachel arrived at her father's table, the senator was on his cellphonetalking loudly about one of his recent successes. He glanced up at Rachel onlylong enough to tap his Cartier and remind her she was late.I missed you, too, Rachel thought.Her father's first name was Thomas, although he'd adopted his middle name longago. Rachel suspected it was because he liked the alliteration. SenatorSedgewick Sexton. The man was a silver-haired, silver-tongued political animalwho had been anointed with the slick look of soap opera doctor, which seemedappropriate considering his talents of impersonation.\"Rachel!\" Her father clicked off his phone and stood to kiss her cheek.\"Hi, Dad.\" She did not kiss him back.\"You look exhausted.\"And so it begins, she thought. \"I got your message. What's up?\"\"I can't ask my daughter out for breakfast?\"Rachel had learned long ago her father seldom requested her company unless hehad some ulterior motive.Sexton took a sip of coffee. \"So, how are things with you?\"\"Busy. I see your campaign's going well.\"\"Oh, let's not talk business.\" Sexton leaned across the table, lowering hisvoice. \"How's that guy at the State Department I set you up with?\"Rachel exhaled, already fighting the urge to check her watch. \"Dad, I reallyhaven't had time to call him. And I wish you'd stop trying to –\"\"You've got to make time for the important things, Rachel. Without love,everything else is meaningless.\"A number of comebacks came to mind, but Rachel chose silence. Being the biggerperson was not difficult when it came to her father. \"Dad, you wanted to see me?You said this was important.\"\"It is.\" Her father's eyes studied her closely.Rachel felt part of her defenses melt away under his gaze, and she cursed theman's power. The senator's eyes were his gift – a gift Rachel suspected wouldprobably carry him to the White House. On cue, his eyes would well with tears,and then, an instant later, they would clear, opening a window to an impassionedsoul, extending a bond of trust to all. It's all about trust, her father alwayssaid. The senator had lost Rachel's years ago, but he was quickly gaining thecountry's.\"I have a proposition for you,\" Senator Sexton said.\"Let me guess,\" Rachel replied, attempting to refortify her position. \"Someprominent divorcé looking for a young wife?\"\"Don't kid yourself, honey. You're not that young anymore.\"Rachel felt the familiar shrinking sensation that so often accompanied meetingswith her father.\"I want to throw you a life raft,\" he said.\"I wasn't aware I was drowning.\"\"You're not. The President is. You should jump ship before it's too late.\"\"Haven't we had this conversation?\"\"Think about your future, Rachel. You can come work for me.\"\"I hope that's not why you asked me to breakfast.\"The senator's veneer of calm broke ever so slightly. \"Rachel, can't you see thatyour working for him reflects badly on me. And on my campaign.\"Rachel sighed. She and her father had been through this. \"Dad, I don't work forthe President. I haven't even met the President. I work in Fairfax, for God'ssake!\"\"Politics is perception, Rachel. It appears you work for the President.\"Rachel exhaled, trying to keep her cool. \"I worked too hard to get this job,Dad. I'm not quitting.\"The senator's eyes narrowed. \"You know, sometimes your selfish attitude really–\"\"Senator Sexton?\" A reporter materialized beside the table.Sexton's demeanor thawed instantly. Rachel groaned and took a croissant from thebasket on the table.\"Ralph Sneeden,\" the reporter said. \"Washington Post. May I ask you a fewquestions?\"The senator smiled, dabbing his mouth with a napkin. \"My pleasure, Ralph. Justmake it quick. I don't want my coffee getting cold.\"The reporter laughed on cue. \"Of course, sir.\" He pulled out a minirecorder andturned it on. \"Senator, your television ads call for legislation ensuring equalsalaries for women in the workplace... as well as for tax cuts for new families.Can you comment on your rationale?\"\"Sure. I'm simply a huge fan of strong women and strong families.\"Rachel practically choked on her croissant.\"And on the subject of families,\" the reporter followed up, \"you talk a lotabout education. You've proposed some highly controversial budget cuts in aneffort to allocate more funds to our nation's schools.\"\"I believe the children are our future.\"Rachel could not believe her father had sunk to quoting pop songs.\"Finally, sir,\" the reporter said, \"you've taken an enormous jump in the pollsthese past few weeks. The President has got to be worried. Any thoughts on yourrecent success?\"\"I think it has to do with trust. Americans are starting to see that thePresident cannot be trusted to make the tough decisions facing this nation.Runaway government spending is putting this country deeper in debt every day,and Americans are starting to realize that it's time to stop spending and startmending.\"Like a stay of execution from her father's rhetoric, the pager in Rachel'shandbag went off. Normally the harsh electronic beeping was an unwelcomeinterruption, but at the moment, it sounded almost melodious.The senator glared indignantly at having been interrupted.Rachel fished the pager from her handbag and pressed a preset sequence of fivebuttons, confirming that she was indeed the person holding the pager. Thebeeping stopped, and the LCD began blinking. In fifteen seconds she wouldreceive a secure text message.Sneeden grinned at the senator. \"Your daughter is obviously a busy woman. It'srefreshing to see you two still find time in your schedules to dine together.\"\"As I said, family comes first.\"Sneeden nodded, and then his gaze hardened. \"Might I ask, sir, how you and yourdaughter manage your conflicts of interest?\"\"Conflicts?\" Senator Sexton cocked his head with an innocent look of confusion.\"What conflicts do you mean?\"Rachel glanced up, grimacing at her father's act. She knew exactly where thiswas headed. Damn reporters, she thought. Half of them were on politicalpayrolls. The reporter's question was what journalists called a grapefruit – aquestion that was supposed to look like a tough inquiry but was in fact ascripted favor to the senator – a slow lob pitch that her father could line upand smash out of the park, clearing the air about a few things.\"Well, sir...\" The reporter coughed, feigning uneasiness over the question. \"Theconflict is that your daughter works for your opponent.\"Senator Sexton exploded in laughter, defusing the question instantly. \"Ralph,first of all, the President and I are not opponents. We are simply two patriotswho have different ideas about how to run the country we love.\"The reporter beamed. He had his sound bite. \"And second?\"\"Second, my daughter is not employed by the President; she is employed by theintelligence community. She compiles intel reports and sends them to the WhiteHouse. It's a fairly low-level position.\" He paused and looked at Rachel. \"Infact, dear, I'm not sure you've even met the President, have you?\"Rachel stared, her eyes smoldering.The beeper chirped, drawing Rachel's gaze to the incoming message on the LCDscreen.– RPRT DIRNRO STAT –She deciphered the shorthand instantly and frowned. The message was unexpected,and most certainly bad news. At least she had her exit cue.\"Gentlemen,\" she said. \"It breaks my heart, but I have to go. I'm late forwork.\"\"Ms. Sexton,\" the reporter said quickly, \"before you go, I was wondering if youcould comment on the rumors that you called this breakfast meeting to discussthe possibility of leaving your current post to work for your father'scampaign?\"Rachel felt like someone had thrown hot coffee in her face. The question tookher totally off guard. She looked at her father and sensed in his smirk that thequestion had been prepped. She wanted to climb across the table and stab himwith a fork.The reporter shoved the recorder into her face. \"Miss Sexton?\"Rachel locked eyes with the reporter. \"Ralph, or whoever the hell you are, getthis straight: I have no intention of abandoning my job to work for SenatorSexton, and if you print anything to the contrary, you'll need a shoehorn to getthat recorder out of your ass.\"The reporter's eyes widened. He clicked off his recorder, hiding a grin. \"Thankyou both.\" He disappeared.Rachel immediately regretted the outburst. She had inherited her father'stemper, and she hated him for it. Smooth, Rachel. Very smooth.Her father glared disapprovingly. \"You'd do well to learn some poise.\"Rachel began collecting her things. \"This meeting is over.\"The senator was apparently done with her anyway. He pulled out his cellphone tomake a call. \"'Bye, sweetie. Stop by the office one of these days and say hello.And get married, for God's sake. You're thirty-three years old.\"\"Thirty-four,\" she snapped. \"Your secretary sent a card.\"He clucked ruefully. \"Thirty-four. Almost an old maid. You know by the time Iwas thirty-four, I'd already –\"\"Married Mom and screwed the neighbor?\" The words came out louder than Rachelhad intended, her voice hanging naked in an ill-timed lull. Diners nearbyglanced over.Senator Sexton's eyes flash-froze, two ice-crystals boring into her. \"You watchyourself, young lady.\"Rachel headed for the door. No, you watch yourself, senator.2The three men sat in silence inside their ThermaTech storm tent. Outside, an icywind buffeted the shelter, threatening to tear it from its moorings. None of themen took notice; each had seen situations far more threatening than this one.Their tent was stark white, pitched in a shallow depression, out of sight. Theircommunication devices, transport, and weapons were all state-of-the-art. Thegroup leader was code-named Delta-One. He was muscular and lithe with eyes asdesolate as the topography on which he was stationed.The military chronograph on Delta-One's wrist emitted a sharp beep. The soundcoincided in perfect unison with beeps emitted from the chronographs worn by theother two men.Another thirty minutes had passed.It was time. Again.Reflexively, Delta-One left his two partners and stepped outside into thedarkness and pounding wind. He scanned the moonlit horizon with infraredbinoculars. As always, he focused on the structure. It was a thousand metersaway – an enormous and unlikely edifice rising from the barren terrain. He andhis team had been watching it for ten days now, since its construction.Delta-One had no doubt that the information inside would change the world. Livesalready had been lost to protect it.At the moment, everything looked quiet outside the structure.The true test, however, was what was happening inside.Delta-One reentered the tent and addressed his two fellow soldiers. \"Time for aflyby.\"Both men nodded. The taller of them, Delta-Two, opened a laptop computer andturned it on. Positioning himself in front of the screen, Delta-Two placed hishand on a mechanical joystick and gave it a short jerk. A thousand meters away,hidden deep within the building, a surveillance robot the size of a mosquitoreceived his transmission and sprang to life.3Rachel Sexton was still steaming as she drove her white Integra up LeesburgHighway. The bare maples of the Falls Church foothills rose stark against acrisp March sky, but the peaceful setting did little to calm her anger. Herfather's recent surge in the polls should have endowed him with a modicum ofconfident grace, and yet it seemed only to fuel his self-importance.The man's deceit was doubly painful because he was the only immediate familyRachel had left. Rachel's mother had died three years ago, a devastating losswhose emotional scars still raked at Rachel's heart. Rachel's only solace wasknowing that the death, with ironic compassion, had liberated her mother from adeep despair over a miserable marriage to the senator.Rachel's pager beeped again, pulling her thoughts back to the road in front ofher. The incoming message was the same.– RPRT DIRNRO STAT –Report to the director of NRO stat. She sighed. I'm coming, for God's sake!With rising uncertainty, Rachel drove to her usual exit, turned onto the privateaccess road, and rolled to a stop at the heavily armed sentry booth. This was14225 Leesburg Highway, one of the most secretive addresses in the country.While the guard scanned her car for bugs, Rachel gazed out at the mammothstructure in the distance. The one-million-square-foot complex sat majesticallyon sixty-eight forested acres just outside D.C. in Fairfax, Virginia. Thebuilding's facade was a bastion of one-way glass that reflected the army ofsatellite dishes, antennas, and rayodomes on the surrounding grounds, doublingtheir already awe-inspiring numbers.Two minutes later, Rachel had parked and crossed the manicured grounds to themain entrance, where a carved granite sign announcedNATIONAL RECONNAISSANCE OFFICE (NRO)The two armed Marines flanking the bulletproof revolving door stared straightahead as Rachel passed between them. She felt the same sensation she always feltas she pushed through these doors... that she was entering the belly of asleeping giant.Inside the vaulted lobby, Rachel sensed the faint echoes of hushed conversationsall around her, as if the words were sifting down from the offices above. Anenormous tiled mosaic proclaimed the NRO directive:ENABLING U.S. GLOBAL INFORMATIONSUPERIORITY, DURING PEACE AND THROUGH WAR.The walls here were lined with massive photographs – rocket launches, submarinechristenings, intercept installations – towering achievements that could becelebrated only within these walls.Now, as always, Rachel felt the problems of the outside world fading behind her.She was entering the shadow world. A world where the problems thundered in likefreight trains, and the solutions were meted out with barely a whisper.As Rachel approached the final checkpoint, she wondered what kind of problem hadcaused her pager to ring twice in the last thirty minutes.\"Good morning, Ms. Sexton.\" The guard smiled as she approached the steeldoorway.Rachel returned the smile as the guard held out a tiny swab for Rachel to take.\"You know the drill,\" he said.Rachel took the hermetically sealed cotton swab and removed the plasticcovering. Then she placed it in her mouth like a thermometer. She held it underher tongue for two seconds. Then, leaning forward, she allowed the guard toremove it. The guard inserted the moistened swab into a slit in a machine behindhim. The machine took four seconds to confirm the DNA sequences in Rachel'ssaliva. Then a monitor flickered on, displaying Rachel's photo and securityclearance.The guard winked. \"Looks like you're still you.\" He pulled the used swab fromthe machine and dropped it through an opening, where it was instantlyincinerated. \"Have a good one.\" He pressed a button and the huge steel doorsswung open.As Rachel made her way into the maze of bustling corridors beyond, she wasamazed that even after six years here she was still daunted by the colossalscope of this operation. The agency encompassed six other U.S. installations,employed over ten thousand agents, and had operating costs of over $10 billionper year.In total secrecy, the NRO built and maintained an astonishing arsenal ofcutting-edge spy technologies: worldwide electronic intercepts; spy satellites;silent, embedded relay chips in telecomm products; even a global naval-reconnetwork known as Classic Wizard, a secret web of 1,456 hydrophones mounted onseafloors around the world, capable of monitoring ship movements anywhere on theglobe.NRO technologies not only helped the United States win military conflicts, butthey provided an endless stream of peacetime data to agencies such as the CIA,NSA, and Department of Defense, helping them thwart terrorism, locate crimesagainst the environment, and give policymakers the data needed to make informeddecisions on an enormous array of topics.Rachel worked here as a \"gister.\" Gisting, or data reduction, required analyzingcomplex reports and distilling their essence or \"gist\" into concise, single-pagebriefs. Rachel had proven herself a natural. All those years of cutting throughmy father's bullshit, she thought.Rachel now held the NRO's premier gisting post – intelligence liaison to theWhite House. She was responsible for sifting through the NRO's dailyintelligence reports, deciding which stories were relevant to the President,distilling those reports into single-page briefs, and then forwarding thesynopsized material to the President's National Security Adviser. In NRO-speak,Rachel Sexton \"manufactured finished product and serviced the customer.\"Although the job was difficult and required long hours, the position was a badgeof honor for her, a way to assert her independence from her father. SenatorSexton had offered many times to support Rachel if she would quit the post, butRachel had no intention of becoming financially beholden to a man like SedgewickSexton. Her mother was testimony to what could happen when a man like that heldtoo many cards.The sound of Rachel's pager echoed in the marble hall.Again? She didn't even bother to check the message.Wondering what the hell was going on, she boarded the elevator, skipped her ownfloor, and went straight to the top.4To call the NRO director a plain man was in itself an overstatement. NRODirector William Pickering was diminutive, with pale skin, a forgettable face, abald head, and hazel eyes, which despite having gazed upon the country's deepestsecrets, appeared as two shallow pools. Nonetheless, to those who worked underhim, Pickering towered. His subdued personality and unadorned philosophies werelegendary at the NRO. The man's quiet diligence, combined with his wardrobe ofplain black suits, had earned him the nickname the \"Quaker.\" A brilliantstrategist and the model of efficiency, the Quaker ran his world with anunrivaled clarity. His mantra: \"Find the truth. Act on it.\"When Rachel arrived in the director's office, he was on the phone. Rachel wasalways surprised by the sight of him: William Pickering looked nothing like aman who wielded enough power to wake the President at any hour.Pickering hung up and waved her in. \"Agent Sexton, have a seat.\" His voice had alucid rawness to it.\"Thank you, sir.\" Rachel sat.Despite most people's discomfort around William Pickering's blunt demeanor,Rachel had always liked the man. He was the exact antithesis of her father...physically unimposing, anything but charismatic, and he did his duty with aselfless patriotism, shunning the spotlight her father loved so much.Pickering removed his glasses and gazed at her. \"Agent Sexton, the Presidentcalled me about a half hour ago. In direct reference to you.\"Rachel shifted in her seat. Pickering was known for getting to the point. Onehell of an opening, she thought. \"Not a problem with one of my gists, I hope.\"\"On the contrary. He says the White House is impressed with your work.\"Rachel exhaled silently. \"So what did he want?\"\"A meeting with you. In person. Immediately.\"Rachel's unease sharpened. \"A personal meeting? About what?\"\"Damn good question. He wouldn't tell me.\"Now Rachel was lost. Keeping information from the director of the NRO was likekeeping Vatican secrets from the Pope. The standing joke in the intelligencecommunity was that if William Pickering didn't know about it, it hadn'thappened.Pickering stood, pacing now in front of his window. \"He asked that I contact youimmediately and send you to meet with him.\"\"Right now?\"\"He sent transportation. It's waiting outside.\"Rachel frowned. The President's request was unnerving on its own account, but itwas the look of concern on Pickering's face that really worried her. \"Youobviously have reservations.\"\"I sure as hell do!\" Pickering showed a rare flash of emotion. \"The President'stiming seems almost callow in its transparency. You are the daughter of the manwho is currently challenging him in the polls, and he demands a private meetingwith you? I find this highly inappropriate. Your father no doubt would agree.\"Rachel knew Pickering was right – not that she gave a damn what her fatherthought. \"Do you not trust the President's motives?\"\"My oath is to provide intel support to the current White House administration,not pass judgment on their politics.\"Typical Pickering response, Rachel realized. William Pickering made no bonesabout his view of politicians as transitory figureheads who passed fleetinglyacross a chessboard whose real players were men like Pickering himself –seasoned \"lifers\" who had been around long enough to understand the game withsome perspective. Two full terms in the White House, Pickering often said, wasnot nearly enough to comprehend the true complexities of the global politicallandscape.\"Maybe it's an innocent request,\" Rachel offered, hoping the President was abovetrying some sort of cheap campaign stunt. \"Maybe he needs a reduction of somesensitive data.\"\"Not to sound belittling, Agent Sexton, but the White House has access to plentyof qualified gisting personnel if they need it. If it's an internal White Housejob, the President should know better than to contact you. And if not, then hesure as hell should know better than to request an NRO asset and then refuse totell me what he wants it for.\"Pickering always referred to his employees as assets, a manner of speech manyfound disconcertingly cold.\"Your father is gaining political momentum,\" Pickering said. \"A lot of it. TheWhite House has got to be getting nervous.\" He sighed. \"Politics is a desperatebusiness. When the President calls a secret meeting with his challenger'sdaughter, I'd guess there's more on his mind than intelligence gists.\"Rachel felt a distant chill. Pickering's hunches had an uncanny tendency to bedead on. \"And you're afraid the White House feels desperate enough to introduceme into the political mix?\"Pickering paused a moment. \"You are not exactly silent about your feelings foryour father, and I have little doubt the President's campaign staff is aware ofthe rift. It occurs to me that they may want to use you against him somehow.\"\"Where do I sign up?\" Rachel said, only half-joking.Pickering looked unimpressed. He gave her a stern stare. \"A word of warning,Agent Sexton. If you feel that your personal issues with your father are goingto cloud your judgment in dealing with the President, I strongly advise that youdecline the President's request for a meeting.\"\"Decline?\" Rachel gave a nervous chuckle. \"I obviously can't refuse thePresident.\"\"No,\" the director said, \"but I can.\"His words rumbled a bit, reminding Rachel of the other reason Pickering wascalled the \"Quaker.\" Despite being a small man, William Pickering could causepolitical earthquakes if he were crossed.\"My concerns here are simple,\" Pickering said. \"I have a responsibility toprotect the people who work for me, and I don't appreciate even the vagueimplication that one of them might be used as a pawn in a political game.\"\"What do you recommend I do?\"Pickering sighed. \"My suggestion is that you meet with him. Commit to nothing.Once the President tells you what the hell is on his mind, call me. If I thinkhe's playing political hardball with you, trust me, I'll pull you out so fastthe man won't know what hit him.\"\"Thank you, sir.\" Rachel sensed a protective aura from the director that sheoften longed for in her own father. \"And you said the President already sent acar?\"\"Not exactly.\" Pickering frowned and pointed out the window.Uncertain, Rachel went over and gazed out in the direction of Pickering'soutstretched finger.A snub-nosed MH-60G PaveHawk helicopter sat idling on the lawn. One of thefastest choppers ever made, this PaveHawk was emblazoned with the White Houseinsignia. The pilot stood nearby, checking his watch.Rachel turned to Pickering in disbelief. \"The White House sent a PaveHawk totake me fifteen miles into D.C.?\"\"Apparently the President hopes you are either impressed or intimidated.\"Pickering eyed her. \"I suggest you are neither.\"Rachel nodded. She was both.Four minutes later, Rachel Sexton exited the NRO and climbed into the waitinghelicopter. Before she had even buckled herself in, the craft was airborne,banking hard across the Virginia woods. Rachel gazed out at the blur of treesbeneath her and felt her pulse rising. It would have risen faster had she knownthis chopper would never reach the White House.5The frigid wind battered the fabric of the ThermaTech tent, but Delta-One hardlynoticed. He and Delta-Three were focused on their comrade, who was manipulatingthe joystick in his hand with surgical dexterity. The screen before themdisplayed a live video transmission from a pinpoint camera mounted aboard themicrorobot.The ultimate surveillance tool, Delta-One thought, still amazed every time theypowered it up. Lately, in the world of micromechanics, fact seemed to beout-pacing fiction.Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) – microbots – were the newest tool inhigh-tech surveillance – \"fly on the wall technology,\" they called it.Literally.Although microscopic, remote-controlled robots sounded like science fiction, infact they had been around since the 1990s. Discovery magazine had run a coverstory in May 1997 on microbots, featuring both \"flying\" and \"swimming\" models.The swimmers – nanosubs the size of salt grains – could be injected into thehuman bloodstream à la the movie Fantastic Voyage. They were now being used byadvanced medical facilities to help doctors navigate arteries by remote control,observe live intravenous video transmissions, and locate arterial blockageswithout ever lifting a scalpel.Contrary to intuition, building a flying microbot was even simpler business. Theaerodynamics technology for getting a machine to fly had been around since KittyHawk, and all that remained had been the issue of miniaturization. The firstflying microbots, designed by NASA as unmanned exploration tools for future Marsmissions, had been several inches long. Now, however, advances innanotechnology, lightweight energy-absorbent materials, and micromechanics hadmade the flying microbots a reality.The true breakthrough had come from the new field biomimics – copying MotherNature. Miniature dragonflies, as it turned out, were the ideal prototype forthese agile and efficient flying microbots. The PH2 model Delta-Two wascurrently flying was only one centimeter long – the size of a mosquito – andemployed a dual pair of transparent, hinged, silicon-leaf wings, giving itunparalleled mobility and efficiency in the air.The microbot's refueling mechanism had been another breakthrough. The firstmicrobot prototypes could only recharge their energy cells by hovering directlybeneath a bright light source, not ideal for stealth or use in dark locales. Thenewer prototypes, however, could recharge simply by parking within a few inchesof a magnetic field. Conveniently, in modern society, magnetic fields wereubiquitous and discreetly placed – power outlets, computer monitors, electricmotors, audio speakers, cellphones – it seemed there was never any shortage ofobscure recharging stations. Once a microbot had been introduced successfullyinto a locale, it could transmit audio and video almost indefinitely. The DeltaForce's PH2 had been transmitting for over a week now with no troublewhatsoever.Now, like an insect hovering inside a cavernous barn, the airborne microbot hungsilently in the still air of the structure's massive central room. With abird's-eye view of the space below, the microbot circled silently aboveunsuspecting occupants – technicians, scientists, specialists in numerous fieldsof study. As the PH2 circled, Delta-One spotted two familiar faces engaged inconversation. They would be a telling mark. He told Delta-Two to drop down andhave a listen.Manipulating the controls, Delta-Two switched on the robot's sound sensors,oriented the microbot's parabolic amplifier, and decreased the robot's elevationuntil it was ten feet over the scientists' heads. The transmission was faint,but discernible.\"I still can't believe it,\" one scientist was saying. The excitement in hisvoice had not diminished since his arrival here forty-eight hours ago.The man with whom he was talking obviously shared the enthusiasm. \"In yourlifetime... did you ever think you would witness anything like this?\"\"Never,\" the scientist replied, beaming. \"It's all a magnificent dream.\"Delta-One had heard enough. Clearly everything inside was proceeding asexpected. Delta-Two maneuvered the microbot away from the conversation and flewit back to its hiding place. He parked the tiny device undetected near thecylinder of an electric generator. The PH2's power cells immediately beganrecharging for the next mission.6Rachel Sexton's thoughts were lost in the morning's bizarre developments as herPaveHawk transport tore across the morning sky, and it was not until thehelicopter rocketed out across Chesapeake Bay that she realized they wereheading in entirely the wrong direction. The initial flash of confusioninstantly gave way to trepidation.\"Hey!\" she yelled to the pilot. \"What are you doing?\" Her voice was barelyaudible over the rotors. \"You're supposed to be taking me to the White House!\"The pilot shook his head. \"Sorry, ma'am. The President is not at the White Housethis morning.\"Rachel tried to remember if Pickering had specifically mentioned the White Houseor whether she had simply assumed. \"So where is the President?\"\"Your meeting with him is elsewhere.\"No shit. \"Where elsewhere?\"\"Not far now.\"\"That's not what I asked.\"\"Sixteen more miles.\"Rachel scowled at him. This guy should be a politician. \"Do you dodge bullets aswell as you dodge questions?\"The pilot did not answer.It took less than seven minutes for the chopper to cross the Chesapeake. Whenland was in sight again, the pilot banked north and skirted a narrow peninsula,where Rachel saw a series of runways and military-looking buildings. The pilotdropped down toward them, and Rachel then realized what this place was. The sixlaunchpads and charred rocket towers were a good clue, but if that was notenough, the roof of one of the buildings had been painted with two enormouswords: WALLOPS ISLAND.Wallops Island was one of NASA's oldest launch sites. Still used today forsatellite launches and testing of experimental aircraft, Wallops was NASA's baseaway from the spotlight.The President is at Wallops Island? It made no sense.The chopper pilot aligned his trajectory with a series of three runways that ranthe length of the narrow peninsula. They seemed to be heading for the far end ofthe center runway.The pilot began to slow. \"You will be meeting the President in his office.\"Rachel turned, wondering if the guy was joking. \"The President of the UnitedStates has an office on Wallops Island?\"The pilot looked dead serious. \"The President of the United States has an officewherever he likes, ma'am.\"He pointed toward the end of the runway. Rachel saw the mammoth shape glisteningin the distance, and her heart almost stopped. Even at three hundred yards, sherecognized the light blue hull of the modified 747.\"I'm meeting him aboard the...\"\"Yes, ma'am. His home away from home.\"Rachel stared out at the massive aircraft. The military's cryptic designationfor this prestigious plane was VC-25-A, although the rest of the world knew itby another name: Air Force One.\"Looks like you're in the new one this morning,\" the pilot said, motioning tothe numbers on the plane's tail fin.Rachel nodded blankly. Few Americans knew that there were actually two Air ForceOnes in service – a pair of identical, specially configured 747-200-Bs, one withthe tail number 28000 and the other 29000. Both planes had cruising speeds of600 mph and had been modified for in-flight refueling, giving them virtuallyunlimited range.As the PaveHawk settled onto the runway beside the President's plane, Rachel nowunderstood the references to Air Force One being the commander-in chief's\"portable home court advantage.\" The machine was an intimidating sight.When the President flew to other countries to meet heads of state, he oftenrequested – for security purposes – that the meeting take place on the runwayaboard his jet. Although some of the motives were security, certainly anotherincentive was to gain a negotiating edge through raw intimidation. A visit toAir Force One was far more intimidating than any trip to the White House. Thesix-foot-high letters along the fuselage trumpeted \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\" Afemale English cabinet member had once accused President Nixon of \"waving hismanhood in her face\" when he asked her to join him aboard Air Force One. Laterthe crew jokingly nicknamed the plane \"Big Dick.\"\"Ms. Sexton?\" A blazer-clad Secret Serviceman materialized outside the chopperand opened the door for her. \"The President is waiting for you.\"Rachel got out of the chopper and gazed up the steep gangway at the bulginghull. Into the flying phallus. She had once heard the flying \"Oval Office\" hadover four thousand square feet of interior floor space, including four separateprivate sleeping quarters, berths for a twenty-six-member flight crew, and twogalleys capable of providing food for fifty people.Climbing the stairway, Rachel felt the Secret Serviceman on her heels, urgingher upward. High above, the cabin door stood open like a tiny puncture wound onthe side of a gargantuan silver whale. She moved toward the darkened entrywayand felt her confidence starting to ebb.Easy, Rachel. It's just a plane.On the landing, the Secret Serviceman politely took her arm and guided her intoa surprisingly narrow corridor. They turned right, walked a short distance, andemerged into a luxurious and spacious cabin. Rachel immediately recognized itfrom photographs.\"Wait here,\" the serviceman said, and he disappeared.Rachel stood alone in Air Force One's famous wood-paneled fore cabin. This wasthe room used for meetings, entertaining dignitaries, and, apparently, forscaring the hell out of first-time passengers. The room spanned the entire widthof the plane, as did its thick tan carpeting. The furnishings were impeccable –cordovan leather armchairs around a bird's-eye maple meeting table, burnishedbrass floor lamps beside a continental sofa, and hand-etched crystal glasswareon a mahogany wet bar.Supposedly, Boeing designers had carefully laid out this fore cabin to providepassengers with \"a sense of order mixed with tranquility.\" Tranquility, however,was the last thing Rachel Sexton was feeling at the moment. The only thing shecould think of was the number of world leaders who had sat in this very room andmade decisions that shaped the world.Everything about this room said power, from the faint aroma of fine pipe tobaccoto the ubiquitous presidential seal. The eagle clasping the arrows and olivebranches was embroidered on throw pillows, carved into the ice bucket, and evenprinted on the cork coasters on the bar. Rachel picked up a coaster and examinedit.\"Stealing souvenirs already?\" a deep voice asked behind her.Startled, Rachel wheeled, dropping the coaster on the floor. She knelt awkwardlyto retrieve it. As she grasped the coaster, she turned to see the President ofthe United States gazing down at her with an amused grin.\"I'm not royalty, Ms. Sexton. There's really no need to kneel.\"7Senator Sedgewick Sexton savored the privacy of his Lincoln stretch limousine asit snaked through Washington's morning traffic toward his office. Across fromhim, Gabrielle Ashe, his twenty-four-year-old personal assistant, read him hisdaily schedule. Sexton was barely listening.I love Washington, he thought, admiring the assistant's perfect shape beneathher cashmere sweater. Power is the greatest aphrodisiac of all... and it bringswomen like this to D.C. in droves.Gabrielle was a New York Ivy Leaguer with dreams of being a senator herself oneday. She'll make it too, Sexton thought. She was incredible-looking and sharp asa whip. Above all, she understood the rules of the game.Gabrielle Ashe was black, but her tawny coloring was more of a deep cinnamon ormahogany, the kind of comfortable in-between that Sexton knew bleeding heart\"whites\" could endorse without feeling like they were giving away the farm.Sexton described Gabrielle to his cronies as Halle Berry's looks with HillaryClinton's brains and ambition, although sometimes he thought even that was anunderstatement.Gabrielle had been a tremendous asset to his campaign since he'd promoted her tohis personal campaign assistant three months ago. And to top it all off, she wasworking for free. Her compensation for a sixteen-hour workday was learning theropes in the trenches with a seasoned politician.Of course, Sexton gloated, I've persuaded her to do a bit more than just work.After promoting Gabrielle, Sexton had invited her to a late night \"orientationsession\" in his private office. As expected, his young assistant arrivedstarstruck and eager to please. With a slow-moving patience mastered overdecades, Sexton worked his magic... building up Gabrielle's trust, carefullystripping away her inhibitions, exhibiting tantalizing control, and finallyseducing her right there in his office.Sexton had little doubt the encounter had been one of the most sexuallygratifying experiences of the young woman's life, and yet, in the light of theday, Gabrielle clearly regretted the indiscretion. Embarrassed, she offered toresign. Sexton refused. Gabrielle stayed on, but she made her intentions veryclear. The relationship had been strictly business ever since.Gabrielle's pouty lips were still moving. \"... don't want you to belackadaisical going into this CNN debate this afternoon. We still don't know whothe White House is sending as opposition. You'll want to peruse these notes Ityped.\" She handed him a folder.Sexton took the folder, savoring the scent of her perfume mixed with the plushleather seats.\"You aren't listening,\" she said.\"Certainly am.\" He grinned. \"Forget about this CNN debate. Worst case scenario,the White House snubs me by sending some low-level campaign intern. Best casescenario, they send a bigwig, and I eat him for lunch.\"Gabrielle frowned. \"Fine. I've included a list of the most probable hostiletopics in your notes.\"\"The usual suspects no doubt.\"\"With one new entry. I think you might face some hostile backlash from the gaycommunity for your comments last night on Larry King.\"Sexton shrugged, barely listening. \"Right. The same-sex marriage thing.\"Gabrielle gave him a disapproving look. \"You did come out against it prettystrongly.\"Same-sex marriages, Sexton thought in disgust. If it were up to me, the faggotswouldn't even have the right to vote. \"Okay, I'll turn it down a notch.\"\"Good. You've been pushing the envelope a bit on some of these hot topicslately. Don't get cocky. The public can turn in an instant. You're gaining now,and you have momentum. Just ride it out. There's no need to hit the ball out ofthe park today. Just keep it in play.\"\"Any news from the White House?\"Gabrielle looked pleasantly baffled. \"Continued silence. It's official; youropponent has become the 'Invisible Man.'\"Sexton could barely believe his good fortune lately. For months, the Presidenthad been working hard on the campaign trail. Then suddenly, a week ago, he hadlocked himself in the Oval Office, and nobody had seen or heard from him since.It was as if the President simply could not face Sexton's groundswell of votersupport.Gabrielle ran a hand through her straightened black hair. \"I hear the WhiteHouse campaign staff is as confused as we are. The President is offering noexplanation for his vanishing act, and everyone over there is furious.\"\"Any theories?\" Sexton asked.Gabrielle gazed at him over her scholarly glasses. \"As it turns out, I got someinteresting data this morning from a contact of mine in the White House.\"Sexton recognized the look in her eyes. Gabrielle Ashe had scored some insiderinformation again. Sexton wondered if she were giving some presidential aidebackseat blow jobs in exchange for campaign secrets. Sexton didn't care... solong as the information kept coming.\"Rumor has it,\" his assistant said, lowering her voice, \"the President's strangebehavior all started last week after an emergency private briefing with theadministrator of NASA. Apparently the President emerged from the meeting lookingdazed. He immediately cleared his schedule, and he's been in close contact withNASA ever since.\"Sexton certainly liked the sound of that. \"You think maybe NASA delivered somemore bad news?\"\"Seems a logical explanation,\" she said hopefully. \"Although it would have to bepretty critical to make the President drop everything.\"Sexton considered it. Obviously, whatever was going on with NASA had to be badnews. Otherwise the President would throw it in my face. Sexton had beenpounding the President pretty hard on NASA funding lately. The space agency'srecent string of failed missions and gargantuan budget overruns had earned NASAthe dubious honor of becoming Sexton's unofficial poster child against biggovernment overspending and inefficiency. Admittedly, attacking NASA – one ofthe most prominent symbols of American pride – was not the way most politicianswould think of winning votes, but Sexton had a weapon few other politicians had– Gabrielle Ashe. And her impeccable instincts.The savvy young woman had come to Sexton's attention several months ago when shewas working as a coordinator in Sexton's Washington campaign office. With Sextontrailing badly in the primary polls and his message of government overspendingfalling on deaf ears, Gabrielle Ashe wrote him a note suggesting a radical newcampaign angle. She told the senator he should attack NASA's huge budgetoverruns and continued White House bailouts as the quintessential example ofPresident Herney's careless overspending.\"NASA is costing Americans a fortune,\" Gabrielle wrote, including a list offinancial figures, failures, and bailouts. \"Voters have no idea. They would behorrified. I think you should make NASA a political issue.\"Sexton groaned at her naïveté. \"Yeah, and while I'm at it, I'll rail againstsinging the national anthem at baseball games.\"In the weeks that followed, Gabrielle continued to send information about NASAacross the senator's desk. The more Sexton read, the more he realized this youngGabrielle Ashe had a point. Even by government agency standards, NASA was anastounding money pit – expensive, inefficient, and, in recent years, grosslyincompetent.One afternoon Sexton was doing an on-air interview about education. The host waspressing Sexton about where he would find funding for his promised overhaul ofpublic schools. In response, Sexton decided to test Gabrielle's NASA theory witha half-joking response. \"Money for education?\" he said. \"Well, maybe I'll cutthe space program in half. I figure if NASA can spend fifteen billion a year inspace, I should be able to spend seven and a half billion on the kids here onearth.\"In the transmission booth, Sexton's campaign managers gasped in horror at thecareless remark. After all, entire campaigns had been sunk by far less thantaking a potshot at NASA. Instantly, the phone lines at the radio station litup. Sexton's campaign managers cringed; the space patriots were circling for thekill.Then something unexpected happened.\"Fifteen billion a year?\" the first caller said, sounding shocked. \"With a B?Are you telling me that my son's math class is overcrowded because schools can'tafford enough teachers, and NASA is spending fifteen billion dollars a yeartaking pictures of space dust?\"\"Um... that's right,\" Sexton said warily.\"Absurd! Does the President have the power to do something about that?\"\"Absolutely,\" Sexton replied, gaining confidence. \"A President can veto thebudget request of any agency he or she deems overfunded.\"\"Then you have my vote, Senator Sexton. Fifteen billion for space research, andour kids don't have teachers. It's outrageous! Good luck, sir. I hope you go allthe way.\"The next caller came on the line. \"Senator, I just read that NASA'sInternational Space Station is way overbudget and the President is thinking ofgiving NASA emergency funding to keep the project going. Is that true?\"Sexton jumped at this one. \"True!\" He explained that the space station wasoriginally proposed as a joint venture, with twelve countries sharing the costs.But after construction began, the station's budget spiraled wildly out ofcontrol, and many countries dropped out in disgust. Rather than scrapping theproject, the President decided to cover everyone's expenses. \"Our cost for theISS project,\" Sexton announced, \"has risen from the proposed eight billion to astaggering one hundred billion dollars!\"The caller sounded furious. \"Why the hell doesn't the President pull the plug!\"Sexton could have kissed the guy. \"Damn good question. Unfortunately, one thirdof the building supplies are already in orbit, and the President spent your taxdollars putting them there, so pulling the plug would be admitting he made amultibillion-dollar blunder with your money.\"The calls kept coming. For the first time, it seemed Americans were waking up tothe idea that NASA was an option – not a national fixture.When the show was over, with the exception of a few NASA diehards calling inwith poignant overtures about man's eternal quest for knowledge, the consensuswas in: Sexton's campaign had stumbled onto the holy grail of campaigning – anew \"hot button\" – a yet untapped controversial issue that struck a nerve withvoters.In the weeks that followed, Sexton trounced his opponents in five crucialprimaries. He announced Gabrielle Ashe as his new personal campaign assistant,praising her for her work in bringing the NASA issue to the voters. With thewave of a hand, Sexton had made a young African-American woman a risingpolitical star, and the issue of his racist and sexist voting record disappearedovernight.Now, as they sat together in the limousine, Sexton knew Gabrielle had yet againproven her worth. Her new information about last week's secret meeting betweenthe NASA administrator and the President certainly suggested more NASA troubleswere brewing – perhaps another country pulling funding from the space station.As the limousine passed the Washington Monument, Senator Sexton could not helpbut feel he had been anointed by destiny.8Despite having ascended to the most powerful political office in the world,President Zachary Herney was average in height, with a slender build and narrowshoulders. He had a freckled face, bifocals, and thinning black hair. Hisunimposing physique, however, stood in stark contrast to the almost princelylove the man commanded from those who knew him. It was said that if you met ZachHerney once, you would walk to the ends of the earth for him.\"So glad you could make it,\" President Herney said, reaching out to shakeRachel's hand. His grasp was warm and sincere.Rachel fought the frog in her throat. \"Of... course, Mr. President. An honor tomeet you.\"The President gave her a comforting grin, and Rachel sensed firsthand thelegendary Herney affability. The man possessed an easygoing countenancepolitical cartoonists loved because no matter how skewed a rendition they drew,no one ever mistook the man's effortless warmth and amiable smile. His eyesmirrored sincerity and dignity at all times.\"If you follow me,\" he said in a cheery voice, \"I've got a cup of coffee withyour name on it.\"\"Thank you, sir.\"The President pressed the intercom and called for some coffee in his office.As Rachel followed the President through the plane, she could not help butnotice that he looked extremely happy and well-rested for a man who was down inthe polls. He was also very casually dressed – blue jeans, a polo shirt, andL.L. Bean hiking boots.Rachel tried to make conversation. \"Doing... some hiking, Mr. President?\"\"Not at all. My campaign advisers have decided this should be my new look. Whatdo you think?\"Rachel hoped for his sake that he wasn't serious. \"It's very... um... manly,sir.\"Herney was deadpan. \"Good. We're thinking it will help me win back some of thewomen's vote from your father.\" After a beat, the President broke into a broadsmile. \"Ms. Sexton, that was a joke. I think we both know I'll need more than apolo shirt and blue jeans to win this election.\"The President's openness and good humor were quickly evaporating any tensionRachel felt about being there. What this President lacked in physical brawn, hemore than made up for in diplomatic rapport. Diplomacy was about people skills,and Zach Herney had the gift.Rachel followed the President toward the back of the plane. The deeper theywent, the less the interior resembled a plane – curved hallways, wallpaperedwalls, even an exercise room complete with StairMaster and rowing machine.Oddly, the plane seemed almost entirely deserted.\"Traveling alone, Mr. President?\"He shook his head. \"Just landed, actually.\"Rachel was surprised. Landed from where? Her intel briefs this week had includednothing about presidential travel plans. Apparently he was using Wallops Islandto travel quietly.\"My staff deplaned right before you arrived,\" the President said. \"I'm headedback to the White House shortly to meet them, but I wanted to meet you hereinstead of my office.\"\"Trying to intimidate me?\"\"On the contrary. Trying to respect you, Ms. Sexton. The White House is anythingbut private, and news of a meeting between the two of us would put you in anawkward position with your father.\"\"I appreciate that, sir.\"\"It seems you're managing a delicate balancing act quite gracefully, and I seeno reason to disrupt that.\"Rachel flashed on her breakfast meeting with her father and doubted that itqualified as \"graceful.\" Nonetheless, Zach Herney was going out of his way to bedecent, and he certainly didn't have to.\"May I call you Rachel?\" Herney asked.\"Of course.\" May I call you Zach?\"My office,\" the President said, ushering her through a carved maple door.The office aboard Air Force One certainly was cozier than its White Housecounterpart, but its furnishings still carried an air of austerity. The desk wasmounded with papers, and behind it hung an imposing oil painting of a classic,three-masted schooner under full sail trying to outrun a raging storm. It seemeda perfect metaphor for Zach Herney's presidency at the moment.The President offered Rachel one of the three executive chairs facing his desk.She sat. Rachel expected him to sit behind his desk, but instead he pulled oneof the chairs up and sat next to her.Equal footing, she realized. The master of rapport.\"Well, Rachel,\" Herney said, sighing tiredly as he settled into his chair. \"Iimagine you've got to be pretty damned confused to be sitting here right now, amI right?\"Whatever was left of Rachel's guard crumbled away with the candor in the man'svoice. \"Actually, sir, I'm baffled.\"Herney laughed out loud. \"Terrific. It's not every day I can baffle someone fromthe NRO.\"\"It's not every day someone from the NRO is invited aboard Air Force One by aPresident in hiking boots.\"The President laughed again.A quiet rap on the office door announced the arrival of coffee. One of theflight crew entered with a steaming pewter pot and two pewter mugs on a tray. Atthe President's bidding, she laid the tray on the desk and disappeared.\"Cream and sugar?\" the President asked, standing up to pour.\"Cream, please.\" Rachel savored the rich aroma. The President of the UnitedStates is personally serving me coffee?Zach Herney handed her a heavy pewter mug. \"Authentic Paul Revere,\" he said.\"One of the little luxuries.\"Rachel sipped the coffee. It was the best she had ever tasted.\"Anyhow,\" the President said, pouring himself a cup and sitting back down, \"I'vegot limited time here, so let's get to business.\" The President plopped a sugarcube in his coffee and gazed up at her. \"I imagine Bill Pickering warned youthat the only reason I would want to see you would be to use you to my politicaladvantage?\"\"Actually, sir, that's exactly what he said.\"The President chuckled. \"Always the cynic.\"\"So he's wrong?\"\"Are you kidding?\" the President laughed. \"Bill Pickering is never wrong. He'sdead-on as usual.\"9Gabrielle Ashe gazed absently out the window of Senator Sexton's limousine as itmoved through the morning traffic toward Sexton's office building. She wonderedhow the hell she had arrived at this point in her life. Personal assistant toSenator Sedgewick Sexton. This was exactly what she had wanted, wasn't it?I'm sitting in a limousine with the next President of the United States.Gabrielle stared across the car's plush interior at the senator, who seemed tobe far away in his own thoughts. She admired his handsome features and perfectattire. He looked presidential.Gabrielle had first seen Sexton speak when she was a poli-sci major at CornellUniversity three years ago. She would never forget how his eyes probed theaudience, as if sending a message directly to her – trust me. After Sexton'sspeech, Gabrielle waited in line to meet him.\"Gabrielle Ashe,\" the senator said, reading her name tag. \"A lovely name for alovely young woman.\" His eyes were reassuring.\"Thank you, sir,\" Gabrielle replied, feeling the man's strength as she shook hishand. \"I was really impressed by your message.\"\"Glad to hear it!\" Sexton thrust a business card into her hand. \"I'm alwayslooking for bright young minds who share my vision. When you get out of school,track me down. My people may have a job for you.\"Gabrielle opened her mouth to thank him, but the senator was already on to thenext person in line. Nonetheless, in the months that followed, Gabrielle foundherself following Sexton's career on television. She watched with admiration ashe spoke out against big government spending – spearheading budget cuts,streamlining the IRS to work more effectively, trimming fat at the DEA, and evenabolishing redundant civil service programs. Then, when the senator's wife diedsuddenly in a car crash, Gabrielle watched in awe as Sexton somehow turned thenegative into a positive. Sexton rose above his personal pain and declared tothe world that he would be running for the presidency and dedicating theremainder of his public service to his wife's memory. Gabrielle decided rightthen and there that she wanted to work closely with Senator Sexton'spresidential campaign.Now she had gotten as close as anyone could get.Gabrielle recalled the night she had spent with Sexton in his plush office, andshe cringed, trying to block out the embarrassing images in her mind. What was Ithinking? She knew she should have resisted, but somehow she'd found herselfunable. Sedgewick Sexton had been an idol of hers for so long... and to think hewanted her.The limousine hit a bump, jarring her thoughts back to the present.\"You okay?\" Sexton was watching her now.Gabrielle flashed a hurried smile. \"Fine.\"\"You aren't still thinking about that drudge, are you?\"She shrugged. \"I'm still a little worried, yeah.\"\"Forget it. The drudge was the best thing that ever happened to my campaign.\"A drudge, Gabrielle had learned the hard way, was the political equivalent ofleaking information that your rival used a penis enlarger or subscribed to StudMuffin magazine. Drudging wasn't a glamorous tactic, but when it paid off, itpaid off big.Of course, when it backfired...And backfire, it had. For the White House. About a month ago, the President'scampaign staff, unsettled by the slipping polls, had decided to get aggressiveand leak a story they suspected to be true – that Senator Sexton had engaged inan affair with his personal assistant, Gabrielle Ashe. Unfortunately for theWhite House, there was no hard evidence. Senator Sexton, a firm believer in thebest defense is a strong offense, seized the moment for attack. He called anational press conference to proclaim his innocence and outrage. I cannotbelieve, he said, gazing into the cameras with pain in his eyes, that thePresident would dishonor my wife's memory with these malicious lies.Senator Sexton's performance on TV was so convincing that Gabrielle herselfpractically believed they had not slept together. Seeing how effortlessly helied, Gabrielle realized that Senator Sexton was indeed a dangerous man.Lately, although Gabrielle was certain she was backing the strongest horse inthis presidential race, she had begun to question whether she was backing thebest horse. Working closely with Sexton had been an eye-opening experience –akin to a behind-the-scenes tour of Universal Studios, where one's childlike aweover the movies is sullied by the realization that Hollywood isn't magic afterall.Although Gabrielle's faith in Sexton's message remained intact, she wasbeginning to question the messenger.10\"What I am about to tell you, Rachel,\" the President said, \"is classified'UMBRA.' Well beyond your current security clearance.\"Rachel felt the walls of Air Force One closing in around her. The President hadflown her to Wallops Island, invited her onboard his plane, poured her coffee,told her flat out that he intended to use her to political advantage against herown father, and now he was announcing he intended to give her classifiedinformation illegally. However affable Zach Herney appeared on the surface,Rachel Sexton had just learned something important about him. This man tookcontrol in a hurry.\"Two weeks ago,\" the President said, locking eyes with her, \"NASA made adiscovery.\"The words hung a moment in the air before Rachel could process them. A NASAdiscovery? Recent intelligence updates had suggested nothing out of the ordinarygoing on with the space agency. Of course, these days a \"NASA discovery\" usuallymeant realizing they'd grossly under budgeted some new project.\"Before we talk further,\" the President said, \"I'd like to know if you shareyour father's cynicism over space exploration.\"Rachel resented the comment. \"I certainly hope you didn't call me here to ask meto control my father's rants against NASA.\"He laughed. \"Hell, no. I've been around the Senate long enough to know thatnobody controls Sedgewick Sexton.\"\"My father is an opportunist, sir. Most successful politicians are. Andunfortunately NASA has made itself an opportunity.\" The recent string of NASAerrors had been so unbearable that one either had to laugh or cry – satellitesthat disintegrated in orbit, space probes that never called home, theInternational Space Station budget rising tenfold and member countries bailingout like rats from a sinking ship. Billions were being lost, and Senator Sextonwas riding it like a wave – a wave that seemed destined to carry him to theshores of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\"I will admit,\" the President continued, \"NASA has been a walking disaster arealately. Every time I turn around, they give me yet another reason to slash theirfunding.\"Rachel saw her opening for a foothold and took it. \"And yet, sir, didn't I justread that you bailed them out last week with another three million in emergencyfunding to keep them solvent?\"The President chuckled. \"Your father was pleased with that one, wasn't he?\"\"Nothing like sending ammunition to your executioner.\"\"Did you hear him on Nightline? 'Zach Herney is a space addict, and thetaxpayers are funding his habit.'\"\"But you keep proving him right, sir.\"Herney nodded. \"I make it no secret that I'm an enormous fan of NASA. I alwayshave been. I was a child of the space race – Sputnik, John Glenn, Apollo 11 –and I have never hesitated to express my feelings of admiration and nationalpride for our space program. In my mind, the men and women of NASA are history'smodern pioneers. They attempt the impossible, accept failure, and then go backto the drawing board while the rest of us stand back and criticize.\"Rachel remained silent, sensing that just below the President's calm exteriorwas an indignant rage over her father's endless anti-NASA rhetoric. Rachel foundherself wondering what the hell NASA had found. The President was certainlytaking his time coming to the point.\"Today,\" Herney said, his voice intensifying, \"I intend to change your entireopinion of NASA.\"Rachel eyed him with uncertainty. \"You have my vote already, sir. You may wantto concentrate on the rest of the country.\"\"I intend to.\" He took a sip of coffee and smiled. \"And I'm going to ask you tohelp me.\" Pausing, he leaned toward her. \"In a most unusual way.\"Rachel could now feel Zach Herney scrutinizing her every move, like a huntertrying to gauge if his prey intended to run or fight. Unfortunately, Rachel sawnowhere to run.\"I assume,\" the President said, pouring them both more coffee, \"that you'reaware of a NASA project called EOS?\"Rachel nodded. \"Earth Observation System. I believe my father has mentioned EOSonce or twice.\"The weak attempt at sarcasm drew a frown from the President. The truth was thatRachel's father mentioned the Earth Observation System every chance he got. Itwas one of NASA's most controversial big-ticket ventures – a constellation offive satellites designed to look down from space and analyze the planet'senvironment: ozone depletion, polar ice melt, global warming, rainforestdefoliation. The intent was to provide environmentalists with never before seenmacroscopic data so that they could plan better for earth's future.Unfortunately, the EOS project had been wrought with failure. Like so many NASAprojects of late, it had been plagued with costly overruns right from the start.And Zach Herney was the one taking the heat. He had used the support of theenvironmental lobby to push the $1.4 billion EOS project through Congress. Butrather than delivering the promised contributions to global earth science, EOShad spiraled quickly into a costly nightmare of failed launches, computermalfunctions, and somber NASA press conferences. The only smiling face latelywas that of Senator Sexton, who was smugly reminding voters just how much oftheir money the President had spent on EOS and just how lukewarm the returns hadbeen.The President dropped a sugar cube into his mug. \"As surprising as this maysound, the NASA discovery I'm referring to was made by EOS.\"Now Rachel felt lost. If EOS had enjoyed a recent success, NASA certainly wouldhave announced it, wouldn't they? Her father had been crucifying EOS in themedia, and the space agency could use any good news they could find.\"I've heard nothing,\" Rachel said, \"about any EOS discovery.\"\"I know. NASA prefers to keep the good news to themselves for a while.\"Rachel doubted it. \"In my experience, sir, when it comes to NASA, no news isgenerally bad news.\" Restraint was not a forte of the NASA public relationsdepartment. The standing joke at the NRO was that NASA held a press conferenceevery time one of their scientists so much as farted.The President frowned. \"Ah, yes. I forget I'm talking to one of Pickering's NROsecurity disciples. Is he still moaning and groaning about NASA's loose lips?\"\"Security is his business, sir. He takes it very seriously.\"\"He damn well better. I just find it hard to believe that two agencies with somuch in common constantly find something to fight about.\"Rachel had learned early in her tenure under William Pickering that althoughboth NASA and the NRO were space-related agencies, they had philosophies thatwere polar opposites. The NRO was a defense agency and kept all of its spaceactivities classified, while NASA was academic and excitedly publicized all ofits breakthroughs around the globe – often, William Pickering argued, at therisk of national security. Some of NASA's finest technologies – high-resolutionlenses for satellite telescopes, long-range communications systems, and radioimaging devices – had a nasty habit of appearing in the intelligence arsenal ofhostile countries and being used to spy against us. Bill Pickering oftengrumbled that NASA scientists had big brains... and even bigger mouths.A more pointed issue between the agencies, however, was the fact that becauseNASA handled the NRO's satellite launches, many of NASA's recent failuresdirectly affected the NRO. No failure had been more dramatic than that of August12, 1998, when a NASA/Air Force Titan 4 rocket blew up forty seconds into launchand obliterated its payload – a $1.2 billion NRO satellite code-named Vortex 2.Pickering seemed particularly unwilling to forget that one.\"So why hasn't NASA gone public about this recent success?\" Rachel challenged.\"They certainly could use some good news right now.\"\"NASA is being silent,\" the President declared, \"because I ordered them to be.\"Rachel wondered if she had heard him correctly. If so, the President wascommitting some kind of political hara-kiri that she did not understand.\"This discovery,\" the President said, \"is... shall we say... nothing short ofastounding in its ramifications.\"Rachel felt an uneasy chill. In the world of intelligence, \"astoundingramifications\" seldom meant good news. She now wondered if all the EOS secrecywas on account of the satellite system having spotted some impendingenvironmental disaster. \"Is there a problem?\"\"No problem at all. What EOS discovered is quite wonderful.\"Rachel fell silent.\"Suppose, Rachel, that I told you NASA has just made a discovery of suchscientific importance... such earth-shattering significance... that it validatedevery dollar Americans have ever spent in space?\"Rachel could not imagine.The President stood up. \"Let's take a walk, shall we?\"11Rachel followed President Herney out onto the glistening gangway of Air ForceOne. As they descended the stairs, Rachel felt the bleak March air clearing hermind. Unfortunately, clarity only made the President's claims seem moreoutlandish than before.NASA made a discovery of such scientific importance that it validates everydollar Americans have ever spent in space?Rachel could only imagine that a discovery of that magnitude would only centeron one thing – the holy grail of NASA – contact with extraterrestrial life.Unfortunately, Rachel knew enough about that particular holy grail to know itwas utterly implausible.As an intelligence analyst, Rachel constantly fielded questions from friends whowanted to know about the alleged government cover-ups of alien contact. She wasconsistently appalled by the theories her \"educated\" friends bought into –crashed alien saucers hidden in secret government bunkers, extraterrestrialcorpses kept on ice, even unsuspecting civilians being abducted and surgicallyprobed.It was all absurd, of course. There were no aliens. No cover-ups.Everyone in the intelligence community understood that the vast majority ofsightings and alien abductions were simply the product of active imaginations ormoneymaking hoaxes. When authentic photographic UFO evidence did exist, it had astrange habit of occurring near U.S. military airbases that were testingadvanced classified aircraft. When Lockheed began air-testing a radical new jetcalled the Stealth Bomber, UFO sightings around Edwards Air Force Base increasedfifteen-fold.\"You have a skeptical look on your face,\" the President said, eyeing heraskance.The sound of his voice startled Rachel. She glanced over, unsure how to respond.\"Well...\" She hesitated. \"May I assume, sir, that we are not talking about alienspacecrafts or little green men?\"The President looked quietly amused. \"Rachel, I think you'll find this discoveryfar more intriguing than science fiction.\"Rachel was relieved to hear NASA had not been so desperate as to try selling thePresident on an alien story. Nonetheless, his comment served only to deepen themystery. \"Well,\" she said, \"whatever NASA found, I must say the timing isexceptionally convenient.\"Herney paused on the gangway. \"Convenient? How so?\"How so? Rachel stopped and stared. \"Mr. President, NASA is currently in a lifeor death battle to justify its very existence, and you are under attack forcontinuing to fund it. A major NASA breakthrough right now would be a panaceafor both NASA and your campaign. Your critics will obviously find the timinghighly suspect.\"\"So... are you calling me a liar or a fool?\"Rachel felt a knot rise in her throat. \"I meant no disrespect, sir. I simply –\"\"Relax.\" A faint grin grew on Herney's lips, and he started to descend again.\"When the NASA administrator first told me about this discovery, I flat outrejected it as absurd. I accused him of masterminding the most transparentpolitical sham in history.\"Rachel felt the knot in her throat dissolve somewhat.At the bottom of the ramp, Herney stopped and looked at her. \"One reason I'veasked NASA to keep their discovery under wraps is to protect them. The magnitudeof this find is well beyond anything NASA has ever announced. It will makelanding men on the moon seem insignificant. Because everyone, myself included,has so much to gain – and lose – I thought it prudent for someone todouble-check the NASA data before we step into the world spotlight with a formalannouncement.\"Rachel was startled. \"Certainly you can't mean me, sir?\"The President laughed. \"No, this is not your area of expertise. Besides, I'vealready achieved verification through extragovernmental channels.\"Rachel's relief gave way to a new mystification. \"Extragovernmental, sir? Youmean you used the private sector? On something this classified?\"The President nodded with conviction. \"I put together an external confirmationteam – four civilian scientists – non-NASA personnel with big names and seriousreputations to protect. They used their own equipment to make observations andcome to their own conclusions. Over the past forty-eight hours, these civilianscientists have confirmed the NASA discovery beyond the shadow of a doubt.\"Now Rachel was impressed. The President had protected himself with typicalHerney aplomb. By hiring the ultimate team of skeptics – outsiders who hadnothing to gain by confirming the NASA discovery – Herney had immunized himselfagainst suspicions that this might be a desperate NASA ploy to justify itsbudget, reelect their NASA-friendly President, and ward off Senator Sexton'sattacks.\"Tonight at eight P.M.,\" Herney said, \"I will be calling a press conference atthe White House to announce this discovery to the world.\"Rachel felt frustrated. Herney had essentially told her nothing. \"And thisdiscovery is what, precisely?\"The President smiled. \"You will find patience a virtue today. This discovery issomething you need to see for yourself. I need you to understand this situationfully before we proceed. The administrator of NASA is waiting to brief you. Hewill tell you everything you need to know. Afterward, you and I will furtherdiscuss your role.\"Rachel sensed an impending drama in the President's eyes and recalledPickering's hunch that the White House had something up its sleeve. Pickering,it appeared, was right, as usual.Herney motioned to a nearby airplane hangar. \"Follow me,\" he said, walkingtoward it.Rachel followed, confused. The building before them had no windows, and itstowering bay doors were sealed. The only access seemed to be a small entryway onthe side. The door was ajar. The President guided Rachel to within a few feet ofthe door and stopped.\"End of the line for me,\" he said, motioning to the door. \"You go throughthere.\"Rachel hesitated. \"You're not coming?\"\"I need to return to the White House. I'll speak to you shortly. Do you have acellphone?\"\"Of course, sir.\"\"Give it to me.\"Rachel produced her phone and handed it to him, assuming he intended to programa private contact number into it. Instead, he slipped her phone into his pocket.\"You're now off-the-grid,\" the President said. \"All your responsibilities atwork have been covered. You will not speak to anyone else today without expresspermission from myself or the NASA administrator. Do you understand?\"Rachel stared. Did the President just steal my cell-phone?\"After the administrator briefs you on the discovery, he will put you in contactwith me via secure channels. I'll talk to you soon. Good luck.\"Rachel looked at the hangar door and felt a growing uneasiness.President Herney put a reassuring hand on her shoulder and nodded toward thedoor. \"I assure you, Rachel, you will not regret assisting me in this matter.\"Without another word, the President strode toward the PaveHawk that had broughtRachel in. He climbed aboard, and took off. He never once looked back.12Rachel Sexton stood alone on the threshold of the isolated Wallops hangar andpeered into the blackness beyond. She felt like she was on the cusp of anotherworld. A cool and musty breeze flowed outward from the cavernous interior, as ifthe building were breathing.\"Hello?\" she called out, her voice wavering slightly.Silence.With rising trepidation, she stepped over the threshold. Her vision went blankfor an instant as her eyes became accustomed to the dimness.\"Ms. Sexton, I presume?\" a man's voice said, only yards away.Rachel jumped, wheeling toward the sound. \"Yes, sir.\"The hazy shape of a man approached.As Rachel's vision cleared, she found herself standing face to face with ayoung, stone-jawed buck in a NASA flight suit. His body was fit andmuscle-bound, his chest bedecked with patches.\"Commander Wayne Loosigian,\" the man said. \"Sorry if I startled you, ma'am. It'spretty dark in here. I haven't had a chance to open the bay doors yet.\" BeforeRachel could respond, the man added, \"It will be my honor to be your pilot thismorning.\"\"Pilot?\" Rachel stared at the man. I just had a pilot. \"I'm here to see theadministrator.\"\"Yes, ma'am. My orders are to transport you to him immediately.\"It took a moment for the statement to sink in. When it hit her, she felt a stabof deceit. Apparently, her travels were not over. \"Where is the administrator?\"Rachel demanded, wary now.\"I do not have that information,\" the pilot replied. \"I will receive hiscoordinates after we are airborne.\"Rachel sensed that the man was telling the truth. Apparently she and DirectorPickering were not the only two people being kept in the dark this morning. ThePresident was taking the issue of security very seriously, and Rachel feltembarrassed by how quickly and effortlessly the President had taken her\"off-the-grid.\" Half an hour in the field, and I'm already stripped of allcommunication, and my director has no idea where I am.Standing now before her stiff-backed NASA pilot, Rachel had little doubt hermorning plans were cast in stone. This carnival ride was leaving with Rachelonboard whether she liked it or not. The only question was where it was headed.The pilot strode over to the wall and pressed a button. The far side of thehangar began sliding loudly to one side. Light poured in from the outside,silhouetting a large object in the center of the hangar.Rachel's mouth fell open. God help me.There in the middle of the hangar stood a ferocious-looking black fighter jet.It was the most streamlined aircraft Rachel had ever seen.\"You are joking,\" she said.\"Common first reaction, ma'am, but the F-14 Tomcat Split-tail is a highly provencraft.\"It's a missile with wings.The pilot led Rachel toward his craft. He motioned to the dual cockpit. \"You'llbe riding in back.\"\"Really?\" She gave him a tight smile. \"And here I thought you wanted me todrive.\"After donning a thermal flight suit over her clothes, Rachel found herselfclimbing into the cockpit. Awkwardly, she wedged her hips into the narrow seat.\"NASA obviously has no fat-assed pilots,\" she said.The pilot gave a grin as he helped Rachel buckle herself in. Then he slid ahelmet over her head.\"We'll be flying pretty high,\" he said. \"You'll want oxygen.\" He pulled anoxygen mask from the side dash and began snapping it onto her helmet.\"I can manage,\" Rachel said, reaching up and taking over.\"Of course, ma'am.\"Rachel fumbled with the molded mouthpiece and then finally snapped it onto herhelmet. The mask's fit was surprisingly awkward and uncomfortable.The commander stared at her for a long moment, looking vaguely amused.\"Is something wrong?\" she demanded.\"Not at all, ma'am.\" He seemed to be hiding a smirk. \"Hack sacks are under yourseat. Most people get sick their first time in a split-tail.\"\"I should be fine,\" Rachel assured him, her voice muffled by the smothering fitof the mask. \"I'm not prone to motion sickness.\"The pilot shrugged. \"A lot of Navy Seals say the same thing, and I've cleanedplenty of Seal puke out of my cockpit.\"She nodded weakly. Lovely.\"Any questions before we go?\"Rachel hesitated a moment and then tapped on the mouthpiece cutting into herchin. \"It's cutting off my circulation. How do you wear these things on longflights?\"The pilot smiled patiently. \"Well, ma'am, we don't usually wear them upsidedown.\"Poised at the end of the runway, engines throbbing beneath her, Rachel felt likea bullet in a gun waiting for someone to pull the trigger. When the pilot pushedthe throttle forward, the Tomcat's twin Lockheed 345 engines roared to life, andthe entire world shook. The brakes released, and Rachel slammed backward in herseat. The jet tore down the runway and lifted off within a matter of seconds.Outside, the earth dropped away at a dizzying rate.Rachel closed her eyes as the plane rocketed skyward. She wondered where she hadgone wrong this morning. She was supposed to be at a desk writing gists. Now shewas straddling a testosterone-fueled torpedo and breathing through an oxygenmask.By the time the Tomcat leveled out at forty-five thousand feet, Rachel wasfeeling queasy. She willed herself to focus her thoughts elsewhere. Gazing downat the ocean nine miles below, Rachel felt suddenly far from home.Up front, the pilot was talking to someone on the radio. When the conversationended, the pilot hung up the radio, and immediately banked the Tomcat sharplyleft. The plane tipped almost to the vertical, and Rachel felt her stomach do asomersault. Finally, the plane leveled out again.Rachel groaned. \"Thanks for the warning, hotshot.\"\"I'm sorry, ma'am, but I've just been given the classified coordinates of yourmeeting with the administrator.\"\"Let me guess,\" Rachel said. \"Due north?\"The pilot seemed confused. \"How did you know that!\"Rachel sighed. You gotta love these computer-trained pilots. \"It's nine A.M.,sport, and the sun is on our right. We're flying north.\"There was a moment of silence from the cockpit. \"Yes, ma'am, we'll be travelingnorth this morning.\"\"And how far north are we going?\"The pilot checked the coordinates. \"Approximately three thousand miles.\"Rachel sat bolt upright. \"What!\" She tried to picture a map, unable even toimagine what was that far north. \"That's a four-hour flight!\"\"At our current speed, yes,\" the pilot said. \"Hold on, please.\"Before Rachel could respond, the man retracted the F-14's wings into low-dragposition. An instant later, Rachel felt herself slammed into her seat yet againas the plane shot forward as though it had been standing still. Within a minutethey were cruising at almost 1,500 miles per hour.Rachel was feeling dizzy now. As the sky tore by with blinding speed, she feltan uncontrollable wave of nausea hit her. The President's voice echoed faintly.I assure you, Rachel, you will not regret assisting me in this matter.Groaning, Rachel reached for her hack sack. Never trust a politician.13Although he disliked the menial filth of public taxis, Senator Sedgewick Sextonhad learned to endure the occasional demeaning moment along his road to glory.The grungy Mayflower cab that had just deposited him in the lower parking garageof the Purdue Hotel afforded Sexton something his stretch limousine could not –anonymity.He was pleased to find this lower level deserted, only a few dusty cars dottinga forest of cement pillars. As he made his way diagonally across the garage onfoot, Sexton glanced at his watch.11:15 A.M. Perfect.The man with whom Sexton was meeting was always touchy about punctuality. Thenagain, Sexton reminded himself, considering who the man represented, he could betouchy about any damned thing he wanted.Sexton saw the white Ford Windstar minivan parked in exactly the same spot as ithad been for every one of their meetings – in the eastern corner of the garage,behind a row of trash bins. Sexton would have preferred to meet this man in asuite upstairs, but he certainly understood the precautions. This man's friendshad not gotten to where they were by being careless.As Sexton moved toward the van, he felt the familiar edginess that he alwaysexperienced before these encounters. Forcing himself to relax his shoulders, heclimbed into the passenger's seat with a cheery wave. The dark-haired gentlemanin the driver's seat did not smile. The man was almost seventy years old, buthis leathery complexion exuded a toughness appropriate to his post as figureheadof an army of brazen visionaries and ruthless entrepreneurs.\"Close the door,\" the man said, his voice callous.Sexton obeyed, tolerating the man's gruffness graciously. After all, this manrepresented men who controlled enormous sums of money, much of which had beenpooled recently to poise Sedgewick Sexton on the threshold of the most powerfuloffice in the world. These meetings, Sexton had come to understand, were lessstrategy sessions than they were monthly reminders of just how beholden thesenator had become to his benefactors. These men were expecting a serious returnon their investment. The \"return,\" Sexton had to admit, was a shockingly bolddemand; and yet, almost more incredibly, it was something that would be withinSexton's sphere of influence once he took the Oval Office.\"I assume,\" Sexton said, having learned how this man liked to get down tobusiness, \"that another installment has been made?\"\"It has. And as usual, you are to use these funds solely for your campaign. Wehave been pleased to see the polls shifting consistently in your favor, and itappears your campaign managers have been spending our money effectively.\"\"We're gaining fast.\"\"As I mentioned to you on the phone,\" the old man said, \"I have persuaded sixmore to meet with you tonight.\"\"Excellent.\" Sexton had blocked off the time already.The old man handed Sexton a folder. \"Here is their information. Study it. Theywant to know you understand their concerns specifically. They want to know youare sympathetic. I suggest you meet them at your residence.\"\"My home? But I usually meet –\"\"Senator, these six men run companies that possess resources well in excess ofthe others you have met. These men are the big fish, and they are wary. Theyhave more to gain and therefore more to lose. I've worked hard to persuade themto meet with you. They will require special handling. A personal touch.\"Sexton gave a quick nod. \"Absolutely. I can arrange a meeting at my home.\"\"Of course, they will want total privacy.\"\"As will I.\"\"Good luck,\" the old man said. \"If tonight goes well, it could be your lastmeeting. These men alone can provide what is needed to push the Sexton campaignover the top.\"Sexton liked the sound of that. He gave the old man a confident smile. \"Withluck, my friend, come election time, we will all claim victory.\"\"Victory?\" The old man scowled, leaning toward Sexton with ominous eyes.\"Putting you in the White House is only the first step toward victory, senator.I assume you have not forgotten that.\"14The White House is one of the smallest presidential mansions in the world,measuring only 170 feet in length, 85 feet in depth, and sitting on a mere 18acres of landscaped grounds. Architect James Hoban's plan for a box-like stonestructure with a hipped roof, balustrade, and columnar entrance, though clearlyunoriginal, was selected from the open design contest by judges who praised itas \"attractive, dignified, and flexible.\"President Zach Herney, even after three and a half years in the White House,seldom felt at home here among the maze of chandeliers, antiques, and armedMarines. At the moment, however, as he strode toward the West Wing, he feltinvigorated and oddly at ease, his feet almost weightless on the plushcarpeting.Several members of the White House staff looked up as the President approached.Herney waved and greeted each by name. Their responses, though polite, weresubdued and accompanied by forced smiles.\"Good morning, Mr. President.\"\"Nice to see you, Mr. President.\"\"Good day, sir.\"As the President made his way toward his office, he sensed whisperings in hiswake. There was an insurrection afoot inside the White House. For the pastcouple of weeks, the disillusionment at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue had beengrowing to a point where Herney was starting to feel like Captain Bligh –commanding a struggling ship whose crew was preparing for mutiny.The President didn't blame them. His staff had worked grueling hours to supporthim in the upcoming election, and now, all of a sudden, it seemed the Presidentwas fumbling the ball.Soon they will understand, Herney told himself. Soon I'll be the hero again.He regretted having to keep his staff in the dark for so long, but secrecy wasabsolutely critical. And when it came to keeping secrets, the White House wasknown as the leakiest ship in Washington.Herney arrived in the waiting room outside the Oval Office and gave hissecretary a cheery wave. \"You look nice this morning, Dolores.\"\"You too, sir,\" she said, eyeing his casual attire with unveiled disapproval.Herney lowered his voice. \"I'd like you to organize a meeting for me.\"\"With whom, sir?\"\"The entire White House staff.\"His secretary glanced up. \"Your entire staff, sir? All 145 of them?\"\"Exactly.\"She looked uneasy. \"Okay. Shall I set it up in... the Briefing Room?\"Herney shook his head. \"No. Let's set it up in my office.\"Now she stared. \"You want to see your entire staff inside the Oval Office?\"\"Exactly.\"\"All at once, sir?\"\"Why not? Set it up for four P.M.\"The secretary nodded as though humoring a mental patient. \"Very well, sir. Andthe meeting is regarding...?\"\"I have an important announcement to make to the American people tonight. I wantmy staff to hear it first.\"A sudden dejected look swept across his secretary's face, almost as if she hadsecretly been dreading this moment. She lowered her voice. \"Sir, are you pullingout of the race?\"Herney burst out laughing. \"Hell no, Dolores! I'm gearing up to fight!\"She looked doubtful. The media reports had all been saying President Herney wasthrowing the election.He gave her a reassuring wink. \"Dolores, you've done a terrific job for me thesepast few years, and you'll do a terrific job for me for another four. We'rekeeping the White House. I swear it.\"His secretary looked like she wanted to believe it. \"Very well, sir. I'll alertthe staff. Four P.M.\"As Zach Herney entered the Oval Office, he couldn't help but smile at the imageof his entire staff crammed into the deceptively small chamber.Although this great office had enjoyed many nicknames over the years – the Loo,Dick's Den, the Clinton Bedroom – Herney's favorite was \"the Lobster Trap.\" Itseemed most fitting. Each time a newcomer entered the Oval Office,disorientation set in immediately. The symmetry of the room, the gently curvingwalls, the discreetly disguised doorways in and out, all gave visitors thedizzying sense they'd been blindfolded and spun around. Often, after a meetingin the Oval Office, a visiting dignitary would stand up, shake hands with thePresident, and march straight into a storage closet. Depending on how themeeting had gone, Herney would either stop the guest in time or watch inamusement as the visitor embarrassed himself.Herney had always believed the most dominating aspect of the Oval Office was thecolorful American eagle emblazoned on the room's oval carpet. The eagle's lefttalon clutched an olive branch and his right a bundle of arrows. Few outsidersknew that during times of peace, the eagle faced left – toward the olive branch.But in times of war, the eagle mysteriously faced right – toward the arrows. Themechanism behind this little parlor trick was the source of quiet speculationamong White House staff because it was traditionally known only by the Presidentand the head of housekeeping. The truth behind the enigmatic eagle, Herney hadfound to be disappointingly mundane. A storage room in the basement containedthe second oval carpet, and housekeeping simply swapped the carpets in the deadof night.Now, as Herney gazed down at the peaceful, left-gazing eagle, he smiled to thinkthat perhaps he should swap carpets in honor of the little war he was about tolaunch against Senator Sedgewick Sexton.15The U.S. Delta Force is the sole fighting squad whose actions are grantedcomplete presidential immunity from the law.Presidential Decision Directive 25 (PDD 25) grants Delta Force soldiers \"freedomfrom all legal accountability,\" including exception from the 1876 PosseComitatus Act, a statute imposing criminal penalties for anyone using themilitary for personal gain, domestic law enforcement, or unsanctioned covertoperations. Delta Force members are handpicked from the Combat ApplicationsGroup (CAG), a classified organization within the Special Operations Command inFort Bragg, North Carolina. Delta Force soldiers are trained killers – expertsin SWAT operations, rescuing hostages, surprise raids, and elimination of covertenemy forces.Because Delta Force missions usually involve high levels of secrecy, thetraditional multitiered chain of command is often circumvented in favor of\"monocaput\" management – a single controller who holds authority to control theunit as he or she sees fit. The controller tends to be a military or governmentpowerbroker with sufficient rank or influence to run the mission. Regardless ofthe identity of their controller, Delta Force missions are classified at thehighest level, and once a mission is completed, Delta Force soldiers never speakof it again – not to one another, and not to their commanding officers withinSpecial Ops.Fly. Fight. Forget.The Delta team currently stationed above the Eighty-second Parallel was doing noflying or fighting. They were simply watching.Delta-One had to admit that this had been a most unusual mission so far, but hehad learned long ago never to be surprised by what he was asked to do. In thepast five years he had been involved in Middle East hostage rescues, trackingand exterminating terrorist cells working inside the United States, and even thediscreet elimination of several dangerous men and women around the globe.Just last month his Delta team had used a flying microbot to induce a lethalheart attack in a particularly malicious South American drug lord. Using amicrobot equipped with a hairline titanium needle containing a potentvasoconstrictor, Delta-Two had flown the device into the man's house through anopen second-story window, found the man's bedroom, and then pricked him on theshoulder while he was sleeping. The microbot was back out the window and \"feetdry\" before the man woke up with chest pain. The Delta team was already flyinghome by the time its victim's wife was calling the paramedics.No breaking and entering.Death by natural causes.It had been a thing of beauty.More recently, another microbot stationed inside a prominent senator's office tomonitor his personal meetings had captured images of a lurid sexual encounter.The Delta team jokingly referred to that mission as \"insertion behind enemylines.\"Now, after being trapped on surveillance duty inside this tent for the last tendays, Delta-One was ready for this mission to be over.Remain in hiding.Monitor the structure – inside and out.Report to your controller any unexpected developments.Delta-One had been trained never to feel any emotion regarding his assignments.This mission, however, had certainly raised his heart rate when he and his teamwere first briefed. The briefing had been \"faceless\" – every phase explained viasecure electronic channels. Delta-One had never met the controller responsiblefor this mission.Delta-One was preparing a dehydrated protein meal when his watch beeped inunison with the others. Within seconds the CrypTalk communications device besidehim blinked on alert. He stopped what he was doing and picked up the handheldcommunicator. The other two men watched in silence.\"Delta-One,\" he said, speaking into the transmitter.The two words were instantly identified by the voice recognition software insidethe device. Each word was then assigned a reference number, which was encryptedand sent via satellite to the caller. On the caller's end, at a similar device,the numbers were decrypted, translated back into words using a predetermined,self-randomizing dictionary. Then the words were spoken aloud by a syntheticvoice. Total delay, eighty milliseconds.\"Controller, here,\" said the person overseeing the operation. The robotic toneof the CrypTalk was eerie – inorganic and androgynous. \"What is your op status?\"\"Everything proceeding as planned,\" Delta-One replied.\"Excellent. I have an update on the time frame. The information goes publictonight at eight P.M. Eastern.\"Delta-One checked his chronograph. Only eight more hours. His job here would befinished soon. That was encouraging.\"There is another development,\" the controller said. \"A new player has enteredthe arena.\"\"What new player?\"Delta-One listened. An interesting gamble. Someone out there was playing forkeeps. \"Do you think she can be trusted?\"\"She needs to be watched very closely.\"\"And if there is trouble?\"There was no hesitation on the line. \"Your orders stand.\"16Rachel Sexton had been flying due north for over an hour. Other than a fleetingglimpse of Newfoundland, she had seen nothing but water beneath the F-14 for theentire journey.Why did it have to be water? she thought, grimacing. Rachel had plunged throughthe ice on a frozen pond while ice-skating when she was seven. Trapped beneaththe surface, she was certain she would die. It had been her mother's powerfulgrasp that finally yanked Rachel's waterlogged body to safety. Ever since thatharrowing ordeal, Rachel had battled a persistent case of hydrophobia – adistinct wariness of open water, especially cold water. Today, with nothing butthe North Atlantic as far as Rachel could see, her old fears had come creepingback.Not until the pilot checked his bearings with Thule airbase in northernGreenland did Rachel realize how far they had traveled. I'm above the ArcticCircle? The revelation intensified her uneasiness. Where are they taking me?What has NASA found? Soon the blue-gray expanse below her became speckled withthousands of stark white dots.Icebergs.Rachel had seen icebergs only once before in her life, six years ago when hermother persuaded Rachel to join her on an Alaskan mother-daughter cruise. Rachelhad suggested a number of alternative land-based vacations, but her mother wasinsistent. \"Rachel, honey,\" her mother had said, \"two thirds of this planet iscovered with water, and sooner or later, you've got to learn to deal with it.\"Mrs. Sexton was a resilient New Englander intent on raising a strong daughter.The cruise had been the last trip Rachel and her mother ever took.Katherine Wentworth Sexton. Rachel felt a distant pang of loneliness. Like thehowling wind outside the plane, the memories came tearing back, pulling at herthe way they always did. Their final conversation had been by phone.Thanksgiving morning.\"I'm so sorry, Mom,\" Rachel said, phoning home from a snowbound O'Hare airport.\"I know our family has never spent Thanksgiving Day apart. It looks like todaywill be our first.\"Rachel's mom sounded crushed. \"I was so looking forward to seeing you.\"\"Me too, Mom. Think of me eating airport food while you and Dad feast onturkey.\"There was a pause on the line. \"Rachel, I wasn't going to tell you until you gothere, but your father says he has too much work to make it home this year. He'llbe staying at his D.C. suite for the long weekend.\"\"What!\" Rachel's surprise gave way immediately to anger. \"But, it'sThanksgiving. The Senate isn't in session! He's less than two hours away. Heshould be with you!\"\"I know. He says he's exhausted – far too tired to drive. He's decided he needsto spend this weekend curled up with his backlog of work.\"Work? Rachel was skeptical. A more likely guess was that Senator Sexton would becurled up with another woman. His infidelities, though discreet, had been goingon for years. Mrs. Sexton was no fool, but her husband's affairs were alwaysaccompanied by persuasive alibis and pained indignity at the mere suggestion hecould be unfaithful. Finally, Mrs. Sexton saw no alternative but to bury herpain by turning a blind eye. Although Rachel had urged her mother to considerdivorce, Katherine Wentworth Sexton was a woman of her word. Till death do uspart, she told Rachel. Your father blessed me with you – a beautiful daughter –and for that I thank him. He will have to answer for his actions to a higherpower someday.Now, standing in the airport, Rachel's anger was simmering. \"But, this meansyou'll be alone for Thanksgiving!\" She felt sick to her stomach. The senatordeserting his family on Thanksgiving Day was a new low, even for him.\"Well...,\" Mrs. Sexton said, her voice disappointed but decisive. \"I obviouslycan't let all this food go to waste. I'll drive it up to Aunt Ann's. She'salways invited us up for Thanksgiving. I'll give her a call right now.\"Rachel felt only marginally less guilty. \"Okay. I'll be home as soon as I can. Ilove you, Mom.\"\"Safe flight, sweetheart.\"It was 10:30 that night when Rachel's taxi finally pulled up the windingdriveway of the Sextons' luxurious estate. Rachel immediately knew something waswrong. Three police cars sat in the driveway. Several news vans too. All thehouse lights were on. Rachel dashed in, her heart racing.A Virginia State policeman met her at the doorway. His face was grim. He didn'thave to say a word. Rachel knew. There had been an accident.\"Route Twenty-five was slick with freezing rain,\" the officer said. \"Your motherwent off the road into a wooded ravine. I'm sorry. She died on impact.\"Rachel's body went numb. Her father, having returned immediately when he got thenews, was now in the living room holding a small press conference, stoicallyannouncing to the world that his wife had passed away in a crash on her way backfrom Thanksgiving dinner with family.Rachel stood in the wings, sobbing through the entire event.\"I only wish,\" her father told the media, his eyes tearful, \"that I had beenhome for her this weekend. This never would have happened.\"You should have thought of that years ago, Rachel cried, her loathing for herfather deepening with every passing instant.From that moment on, Rachel divorced herself from her father in the way Mrs.Sexton never had. The senator barely seemed to notice. He suddenly had gottenvery busy using his late wife's fortunes to begin courting his party'snomination for president. The sympathy vote didn't hurt either.Cruelly now, three years later, even at a distance the senator was makingRachel's life lonely. Her father's run for the White House had put Rachel'sdreams of meeting a man and starting a family on indefinite hold. For Rachel ithad become far easier to take herself completely out of the social game than todeal with the endless stream of power-hungry Washingtonian suitors hoping tosnag a grieving, potential \"first daughter\" while she was still in their league.Outside the F-14, the daylight had started to fade. It was late winter in theArctic – a time of perpetual darkness. Rachel realized she was flying into aland of permanent night.As the minutes passed, the sun faded entirely, dropping below the horizon. Theycontinued north, and a brilliant three-quarter moon appeared, hanging white inthe crystalline glacial air. Far below, the ocean waves shimmered, the icebergslooking like diamonds sewn into a dark sequin mesh.Finally, Rachel spotted the hazy outline of land. But it was not what she hadexpected. Looming out of the ocean before the plane was an enormous snowcappedmountain range.\"Mountains?\" Rachel asked, confused. \"There are mountains north of Greenland?\"\"Apparently,\" the pilot said, sounding equally surprised.As the nose of the F-14 tipped downward, Rachel felt an eerie weightlessness.Through the ringing in her ears she could hear a repeated electronic ping in thecockpit. The pilot had apparently locked on to some kind of directional beaconand was following it in.As they passed below three thousand feet, Rachel stared out at the dramaticmoonlit terrain beneath them. At the base of the mountains, an expansive, snowyplain swept wide. The plateau spread gracefully seaward about ten miles until itended abruptly at a sheer cliff of solid ice that dropped vertically into theocean.It was then that Rachel saw it. A sight like nothing she had ever seen anywhereon earth. At first she thought the moonlight must be playing tricks on her. Shesquinted down at the snowfields, unable to comprehend what she was looking at.The lower the plane descended, the clearer the image became.What in the name of God?The plateau beneath them was striped... as if someone had painted the snow withthree huge striations of silver paint. The glistening strips ran parallel to thecoastal cliff. Not until the plane dropped past five hundred feet did theoptical illusion reveal itself. The three silver stripes were deep troughs, eachone over thirty yards wide. The troughs had filled with water and frozen intobroad, silvery channels that stretched in parallel across the plateau. The whiteberms between them were mounded dikes of snow.As they dropped toward the plateau, the plane started bucking and bouncing inheavy turbulence. Rachel heard the landing gear engage with a heavy clunk, butshe still saw no landing strip. As the pilot struggled to keep the plane undercontrol, Rachel peered out and spotted two lines of blinking strobes straddlingthe outermost ice trough. She realized to her horror what the pilot was about todo.\"We're landing on ice?\" she demanded.The pilot did not respond. He was concentrating on the buffeting wind. Rachelfelt a drag in her gut as the craft decelerated and dropped toward the icechannel. High snow berms rose on either side of the aircraft, and Rachel heldher breath, knowing the slightest miscalculation in the narrow channel wouldmean certain death. The wavering plane dropped lower between the berms, and theturbulence suddenly disappeared. Sheltered there from the wind, the planetouched down perfectly on the ice.The Tomcat's rear thrusters roared, slowing the plane. Rachel exhaled. The jettaxied about a hundred yards farther and rolled to a stop at a red linespray-painted boldly across the ice.The view to the right was nothing but a wall of snow in the moonlight – the sideof an ice berm. The view on the left was identical. Only through the windshieldahead of them did Rachel have any visibility... an endless expanse of ice. Shefelt like she had landed on a dead planet. Aside from the line on the ice, therewere no signs of life.Then Rachel heard it. In the distance, another engine was approaching. Higherpitched. The sound grew louder until a machine came into view. It was a large,multitreaded snow tractor churning toward them up the ice trough. Tall andspindly, it looked like a towering futuristic insect grinding toward them onvoracious spinning feet. Mounted high on the chassis was an enclosed Plexiglascabin with a rack of floodlights illuminating its way.The machine shuddered to a halt directly beside the F-14. The door on thePlexiglas cabin opened, and a figure climbed down a ladder onto the ice. He wasbundled from head to foot in a puffy white jumpsuit that gave the impression hehad been inflated.Mad Max meets the Pillsbury Dough Boy, Rachel thought, relieved at least to seethis strange planet was inhabited.The man signaled for the F-14 pilot to pop the hatch.The pilot obeyed.When the cockpit opened, the gust of air that tore through Rachel's body chilledher instantly to the core.Close the damn lid!\"Ms. Sexton?\" the figure called up to her. His accent was American. \"On behalfof NASA, I welcome you.\"Rachel was shivering. Thanks a million.\"Please unhook your flight harness, leave your helmet in the craft, and deplaneby using the fuselage toe-holds. Do you have any questions?\"\"Yes,\" Rachel shouted back. \"Where the hell am I?\"17Marjorie Tench – senior adviser to the President – was a loping skeleton of acreature. Her gaunt six-foot frame resembled an Erector Set construction ofjoints and limbs. Overhanging her precarious body was a jaundiced face whoseskin resembled a sheet of parchment paper punctured by two emotionless eyes. Atfifty-one, she looked seventy.Tench was revered in Washington as a goddess in the political arena. She wassaid to possess analytical skills that bordered on the clairvoyant. Her decaderunning the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research had helpedhone a lethally sharp, critical mind. Unfortunately, accompanying Tench'spolitical savvy came an icy temperament that few could endure for more than afew minutes. Marjorie Tench had been blessed with all the brains of asupercomputer – and the warmth of one, too. Nonetheless, President Zach Herneyhad little trouble tolerating the woman's idiosyncrasies; her intellect and hardwork were almost single-handedly responsible for putting Herney in office in thefirst place.\"Marjorie,\" the President said, standing to welcome her into the Oval Office.\"What can I do for you?\" He did not offer her a seat. The typical social gracesdid not apply to women like Marjorie Tench. If Tench wanted a seat, she woulddamn well take one.\"I see you set the staff briefing for four o'clock this afternoon.\" Her voicewas raspy from cigarettes. \"Excellent.\"Tench paced a moment, and Herney sensed the intricate cogs of her mind turningover and over. He was grateful. Marjorie Tench was one of the select few on thePresident's staff who was fully aware of the NASA discovery, and her politicalsavvy was helping the President plan his strategy.\"This CNN debate today at one o'clock,\" Tench said, coughing. \"Who are wesending to spar with Sexton?\"Herney smiled. \"A junior campaign spokesperson.\" The political tactic offrustrating the \"hunter\" by never sending him any big game was as old as debatesthemselves.\"I have a better idea,\" Tench said, her barren eyes finding his. \"Let me takethe spot myself.\"Zach Herney's head shot up. \"You?\" What the hell is she thinking? \"Marjorie, youdon't do media spots. Besides, it's a midday cable show. If I send my senioradviser, what kind of message does that send? It makes us look like we'repanicking.\"\"Exactly.\"Herney studied her. Whatever convoluted scheme Tench was hatching, there was noway in hell Herney would permit her to appear on CNN. Anyone who had ever laideyes on Marjorie Tench knew there was a reason she worked behind the scenes.Tench was a frightful-looking woman – not the kind of face a President wanteddelivering the White House message.\"I am taking this CNN debate,\" she repeated. This time she was not asking.\"Marjorie,\" the President maneuvered, feeling uneasy now, \"Sexton's campaignwill obviously claim your presence on CNN is proof the White House is runningscared. Sending out our big guns early makes us look desperate.\"The woman gave a quiet nod and lit a cigarette. \"The more desperate we look, thebetter.\"For the next sixty seconds, Marjorie Tench outlined why the President would besending her to the CNN debate instead of some lowly campaign staffer. When Tenchwas finished, the President could only stare in amazement.Once again, Marjorie Tench had proven herself a political genius.18The Milne Ice Shelf is the largest solid ice floe in the Northern Hemisphere.Located above the Eighty-second Parallel on the northernmost coast of EllesmereIsland in the high Arctic, the Milne Ice Shelf is four miles wide and reachesthicknesses of over three hundred feet.Now, as Rachel climbed into the Plexiglas enclosure atop the ice tractor, shewas grateful for the extra parka and gloves waiting for her on her seat, as wellas the heat pouring out of the tractor's vents. Outside, on the ice runway, theF-14's engines roared, and the plane began taxiing away.Rachel looked up in alarm. \"He's leaving?\"Her new host climbed into the tractor, nodding. \"Only science personnel andimmediate NASA support team members are allowed on-site.\"As the F-14 tore off into the sunless sky, Rachel felt suddenly marooned.\"We'll be taking the IceRover from here,\" the man said. \"The administrator iswaiting.\"Rachel gazed out at the silvery path of ice before them and tried to imaginewhat the hell the administrator of NASA was doing up here.\"Hold on,\" the NASA man shouted, working some levers. With a grinding growl, themachine rotated ninety degrees in place like a treaded army tank. It was nowfacing the high wall of a snow berm.Rachel looked at the steep incline and felt a ripple of fear. Surely he doesn'tintend to –\"Rock and roll!\" The driver popped the clutch, and the craft accelerateddirectly toward the slope. Rachel let out a muffled cry and held on. As they hitthe incline, the spiked treads tore into the snow, and the contraption began toclimb. Rachel was certain they would tip over backward, but the cabin remainedsurprisingly horizontal as the treads clawed up the slope. When the huge machineheaved up onto the crest of the berm, the driver brought it to a stop and beamedat his white-knuckled passenger. \"Try that in an SUV! We took the shock-systemdesign from the Mars Pathfinder and popped it on this baby! Worked like acharm.\"Rachel gave a wan nod. \"Neat.\"Sitting now atop the snow berm, Rachel looked out at the inconceivable view. Onemore large berm stood before them, and then the undulations stopped abruptly.Beyond, the ice smoothed into a glistening expanse that was inclined ever soslightly. The moonlit sheet of ice stretched out into the distance, where iteventually narrowed and snaked up into the mountains.\"That's the Milne Glacier,\" the driver said, pointing up into the mountains.\"Starts up there and flows down into this wide delta that we're sitting on now.\"The driver gunned the engine again, and Rachel held on as the craft accelerateddown the steep face. At the bottom, they clawed across another ice river androcketed up the next berm. Mounting the crest and quickly skimming down the farside, they slid out onto a smooth sheet of ice and started crunching across theglacier.\"How far?\" Rachel saw nothing but ice in front of them.\"About two miles ahead.\"Rachel thought it seemed far. The wind outside pounded the IceRover inrelentless gusts, rattling the Plexiglas as if trying to hurl them back towardthe sea.\"That's the katabatic wind,\" the driver yelled. \"Get used to it!\" He explainedthat this area had a permanent offshore gale called the katabatic – Greek forflowing downhill. The relentless wind was apparently the product of heavy, coldair \"flowing\" down the glacial face like a raging river downhill. \"This is theonly place on earth,\" the driver added, laughing, \"where hell actually freezesover!\"Several minutes later, Rachel began to see a hazy shape in the distance in frontof them – the silhouette of an enormous white dome emerging from the ice. Rachelrubbed her eyes. What in the world...?\"Big Eskimos up here, eh?\" the man joked.Rachel tried to make sense of the structure. It looked like a scaled-downHouston Astrodome.\"NASA put it up a week and a half ago,\" he said. \"Multistage inflatableplexipolysorbate. Inflate the pieces, affix them to one another, connect thewhole thing to the ice with pitons and wires. Looks like an enclosed big toptent, but it's actually the NASA prototype for the portable habitat we hope touse on Mars someday. We call it a 'habisphere.'\"\"Habisphere?\"\"Yeah, get it? Because it's not a whole sphere, it's only habi-sphere.\"Rachel smiled and stared out at the bizarre building now looming closer on theglacial plain. \"And because NASA hasn't gone to Mars yet, you guys decided tohave a big sleepover out here instead?\"The man laughed. \"Actually, I would have preferred Tahiti, but fate pretty muchdecided the location.\"Rachel gazed uncertainly up at the edifice. The off-white shell was a ghostlycontour against a dark sky. As the IceRover neared the structure, it ground to astop at a small door on the side of the dome, which was now opening. Light frominside spilled out onto the snow. A figure stepped out. He was a bulky giantwearing a black fleece pullover that amplified his size and made him look like abear. He moved toward the IceRover.Rachel had no doubt who the huge man was: Lawrence Ekstrom, administrator ofNASA.The driver gave a solacing grin. \"Don't let his size fool you. The guy's apussycat.\"More like a tiger, Rachel thought, well acquainted with Ekstrom's reputation forbiting the heads off those who stood in the way of his dreams.When Rachel climbed down from the IceRover, the wind almost blew her over. Shewrapped the coat around herself and moved toward the dome.The NASA administrator met her halfway, extending a huge gloved paw. \"Ms.Sexton. Thank you for coming.\"Rachel nodded uncertainly and shouted over the howling wind. \"Frankly, sir, I'mnot sure I had much choice.\"• • •A thousand meters farther up the glacier, Delta-One gazed through infraredbinoculars and watched as the administrator of NASA ushered Rachel Sexton intothe dome.19NASA administrator Lawrence Ekstrom was a giant of a man, ruddy and gruff, likean angry Norse god. His prickly blond hair was cropped military short above afurrowed brow, and his bulbous nose was spidered with veins. At the moment, hisstony eyes drooped with the weight of countless sleepless nights. An influentialaerospace strategist and operations adviser at the Pentagon before hisappointment to NASA, Ekstrom had a reputation for surliness matched only by hisincontestable dedication to whatever mission was at hand.As Rachel Sexton followed Lawrence Ekstrom into the habisphere, she foundherself walking through an eerie, translucent maze of hallways. The labyrinthinenetwork appeared to have been fashioned by hanging sheets of opaque plasticacross tautly strung wires. The floor of the maze was nonexistent – a sheet ofsolid ice, carpeted with strips of rubber matting for traction. They passed arudimentary living area lined with cots and chemical toilets.Thankfully, the air in the habisphere was warm, albeit heavy with the mingledpotpourri of indistinguishable smells that accompany humans in tight quarters.Somewhere a generator droned, apparently the source of the electricity thatpowered the bare bulbs hanging from draped extension cords in the hallway.\"Ms. Sexton,\" Ekstrom grunted, guiding her briskly toward some unknowndestination. \"Let me be candid with you right from the start.\" His tone conveyedanything but pleasure to have Rachel as his guest. \"You are here because thePresident wants you here. Zach Herney is a personal friend of mine and afaithful NASA supporter. I respect him. I owe him. And I trust him. I do notquestion his direct orders, even when I resent them. Just so there is noconfusion, be aware that I do not share the President's enthusiasm for involvingyou in this matter.\"Rachel could only stare. I traveled three thousand miles for this kind ofhospitality? This guy was no Martha Stewart. \"With all due respect,\" she firedback, \"I am also under presidential orders. I have not been told my purposehere. I made this trip on good faith.\"\"Fine,\" Ekstrom said. \"Then I will speak bluntly.\"\"You've made a damn good start.\"Rachel's tough response seemed to jolt the administrator. His stride slowed amoment, his eyes clearing as he studied her. Then, like a snake uncoiling, heheaved a long sigh and picked up the pace.\"Understand,\" Ekstrom began, \"that you are here on a classified NASA projectagainst my better judgment. Not only are you a representative of the NRO, whosedirector enjoys dishonoring NASA personnel as loose-lipped children, but you arethe daughter of the man who has made it his personal mission to destroy myagency. This should be NASA's hour in the sun; my men and women have endured alot of criticism lately and deserve this moment of glory. However, due to atorrent of skepticism spearheaded by your father, NASA finds itself in apolitical situation where my hardworking personnel are forced to share thespotlight with a handful of random civilian scientists and the daughter of theman who is trying to destroy us.\"I am not my father, Rachel wanted to shout, but this was hardly the moment todebate politics with the head of NASA. \"I did not come here for the spotlight,sir.\"Ekstrom glared. \"You may find you have no alternative.\"The comment took her by surprise. Although President Herney had said nothingspecific about her assisting him in any sort of \"public\" way, William Pickeringhad certainly aired his suspicions that Rachel might become a political pawn.\"I'd like to know what I'm doing here,\" Rachel demanded.\"You and me both. I do not have that information.\"\"I'm sorry?\"\"The President asked me to brief you fully on our discovery the moment youarrived. Whatever role he wants you to play in this circus is between you andhim.\"\"He told me your Earth Observation System had made a discovery.\"Ekstrom glanced sidelong at her. \"How familiar are you with the EOS project?\"\"EOS is a constellation of five NASA satellites which scrutinize the earth indifferent ways – ocean mapping, geologic fault analyses, polar ice-meltobservation, location of fossil fuel reserves –\"\"Fine,\" Ekstrom said, sounding unimpressed. \"So you're aware of the newestaddition to the EOS constellation? It's called PODS.\"Rachel nodded. The Polar Orbiting Density Scanner (PODS) was designed to helpmeasure the effects of global warming. \"As I understand it, PODS measures thethickness and hardness of the polar ice cap?\"\"In effect, yes. It uses spectral band technology to take composite densityscans of large regions and find softness anomalies in the ice – slush spots,internal melting, large fissures – indicators of global warming.\"Rachel was familiar with composite density scanning. It was like a subterraneanultrasound. NRO satellites had used similar technology to search for subsurfacedensity variants in Eastern Europe and locate mass burial sites, which confirmedfor the President that ethnic cleansing was indeed going on.\"Two weeks ago,\" Ekstrom said, \"PODS passed over this ice shelf and spotted adensity anomaly that looked nothing like anything we'd expected to see. Twohundred feet beneath the surface, perfectly embedded in a matrix of solid ice,PODS saw what looked like an amorphous globule about ten feet in diameter.\"\"A water pocket?\" Rachel asked.\"No. Not liquid. Strangely, this anomaly was harder than the ice surroundingit.\"Rachel paused. \"So... it's a boulder or something?\"Ekstrom nodded. \"Essentially.\"Rachel waited for the punch line. It never came. I'm here because NASA found abig rock in the ice?\"Not until PODS calculated the density of this rock did we get excited. Weimmediately flew a team up here to analyze it. As it turns out, the rock in theice beneath us is significantly more dense than any type of rock found here onEllesmere Island. More dense, in fact, than any type of rock found within afour-hundred-mile radius.\"Rachel gazed down at the ice beneath her feet, picturing the huge rock downthere somewhere. \"You're saying someone moved it here?\"Ekstrom looked vaguely amused. \"The stone weighs more than eight tons. It isembedded under two hundred feet of solid ice, meaning it has been thereuntouched for over three hundred years.\"Rachel felt tired as she followed the administrator into the mouth of a long,narrow corridor, passing between two armed NASA workers who stood guard. Rachelglanced at Ekstrom. \"I assume there's a logical explanation for the stone'spresence here... and for all this secrecy?\"\"There most certainly is,\" Ekstrom said, deadpan. \"The rock PODS found is ameteorite.\"Rachel stopped dead in the passageway and stared at the administrator. \"Ameteorite?\" A surge of disappointment washed over her. A meteorite seemedutterly anti-climactic after the President's big buildup. This discovery willsingle-handedly justify all of NASA's past expenditures and blunders? What wasHerney thinking? Meteorites were admittedly one of the rarest rocks on earth,but NASA discovered meteorites all the time.\"This meteorite is one of the largest ever found,\" Ekstrom said, standing rigidbefore her. \"We believe it is a fragment of a larger meteorite documented tohave hit the Arctic Ocean in the seventeen hundreds. Most likely, this rock wasthrown as ejecta from that ocean impact, landed on the Milne Glacier, and wasslowly buried by snow over the past three hundred years.\"Rachel scowled. This discovery changed nothing. She felt a growing suspicionthat she was witnessing an overblown publicity stunt by a desperate NASA andWhite House – two struggling entities attempting to elevate a propitious find tothe level of earth-shattering NASA victory.\"You don't look too impressed,\" Ekstrom said.\"I guess I was just expecting something... else.\"Ekstrom's eyes narrowed. \"A meteorite of this size is a very rare find, Ms.Sexton. There are only a few larger in the world.\"\"I realize –\"\"But the size of the meteorite is not what excites us.\"Rachel glanced up.\"If you would permit me to finish,\" Ekstrom said, \"you will learn that thismeteorite displays some rather astonishing characteristics never before seen inany meteorite. Large or small.\" He motioned down the passageway. \"Now, if youwould follow me, I'll introduce you to someone more qualified than I am todiscuss this find.\"Rachel was confused. \"Someone more qualified than the administrator of NASA?\"Ekstrom's Nordic eyes locked in on hers. \"More qualified, Ms. Sexton, insofar ashe is a civilian. I had assumed because you are a professional data analyst thatyou would prefer to get your data from an unbiased source.\"Touché. Rachel backed off.She followed the administrator down the narrow corridor, where they dead-endedat a heavy, black drapery. Beyond the drape, Rachel could hear the reverberantmurmur of a crowd of voices rumbling on the other side, echoing as if in a giantopen space.Without a word, the administrator reached up and pulled aside the curtain.Rachel was blinded by a dazzling brightness. Hesitant, she stepped forward,squinting into the glistening space. As her eyes adjusted, she gazed out at themassive room before her and drew an awestruck breath.\"My God,\" she whispered. What is this place?20The CNN production facility outside of Washington, D.C., is one of 212 studiosworldwide that link via satellite to the global headquarters of TurnerBroadcasting System in Atlanta.It was 1:45 P.M. when Senator Sedgewick Sexton's limousine pulled into theparking lot. Sexton was feeling smug as he got out and strode toward theentrance. He and Gabrielle were greeted inside by a pot-bellied CNN producer whowore an effusive smile.\"Senator Sexton,\" the producer said. \"Welcome. Great news. We just found out whothe White House sent as a sparring partner for you.\" The producer gave aforeboding grin. \"I hope you brought your game face.\" He motioned through theproduction glass out into the studio.Sexton looked through the glass and almost fell over. Staring back at him,through the smoky haze of her cigarette, was the ugliest face in politics.\"Marjorie Tench?\" Gabrielle blurted. \"What the hell is she doing here?\"Sexton had no idea, but whatever the reason, her presence here was fantasticnews – a clear sign that the President was in desperation mode. Why else wouldhe send his senior adviser to the front lines? President Zach Herney was rollingout the big guns, and Sexton welcomed the opportunity.The bigger the foe, the harder they fall.The senator had no doubt that Tench would be a sly opponent, but gazing now atthe woman, Sexton could not help but think that the President had made a seriouserror in judgment. Marjorie Tench was hideous looking. At the moment, she satslouched in her chair, smoking a cigarette, her right arm moving in languidrhythm back and forth to her thin lips like a giant praying mantis feeding.Jesus, Sexton thought, if there was ever a face that should stick to radio.The few times Sedgewick Sexton had seen the White House senior adviser'sjaundiced mug in a magazine, he could not believe he was looking at one of themost powerful faces in Washington.\"I don't like this,\" Gabrielle whispered.Sexton barely heard her. The more he considered the opportunity, the more heliked it. Even more fortuitous than Tench's media-unfriendly face was Tench'sreputation on one key issue: Marjorie Tench was extremely vocal that America'sleadership role in the future could only be secured through technologicalsuperiority. She was an avid supporter of high-tech government R&D programs,and, most important – NASA. Many believed it was Tench's behind-the-scenespressure that kept the President positioned so staunchly behind the failingspace agency.Sexton wondered if perhaps the President was now punishing Tench for all the badadvice about supporting NASA. Is he throwing his senior adviser to the wolves?Gabrielle Ashe gazed through the glass at Marjorie Tench and felt a growinguneasiness. This woman was smart as hell and she was an unexpected twist. Thosetwo facts had her instincts tingling. Considering the woman's stance on NASA,the President sending her to face-off against Senator Sexton seemed ill-advised.But the President was certainly no fool. Something told Gabrielle this interviewwas bad news.Gabrielle already sensed the senator salivating over his odds, which did littleto curb her concern. Sexton had a habit of going overboard when he got cocky.The NASA issue had been a welcome boost in the polls, but Sexton had beenpushing very hard lately, she thought. Plenty of campaigns had been lost bycandidates who went for the knockout when all they needed was to finish theround.The producer looked eager for the impending blood match. \"Let's get you set up,senator.\"As Sexton headed for the studio, Gabrielle caught his sleeve. \"I know whatyou're thinking,\" she whispered. \"But just be smart. Don't go overboard.\"\"Overboard? Me?\" Sexton grinned.\"Remember this woman is very good at what she does.\"Sexton gave her a suggestive smirk. \"So am I.\"21The cavernous main chamber of NASA's habisphere would have been a strange sightanywhere on earth, but the fact that it existed on an Arctic ice shelf made itthat much more difficult for Rachel Sexton to assimilate.Staring upward into a futuristic dome crafted of white interlocking triangularpads, Rachel felt like she had entered a colossal sanatorium. The walls slopeddownward to a floor of solid ice, where an army of halogen lamps stood likesentinels around the perimeter, casting stark light skyward and giving the wholechamber an ephemeral luminosity.Snaking across the ice floor, black foam carpetrunners wound like boardwalksthrough a maze of portable scientific work stations. Amid the electronics,thirty or forty white-clad NASA personnel were hard at work, conferring happilyand talking in excited tones. Rachel immediately recognized the electricity inthe room.It was the thrill of new discovery.As Rachel and the administrator circled the outer edge of the dome, she notedthe surprised looks of displeasure from those who recognized her. Their whisperscarried clearly in the reverberant space.Isn't that Senator Sexton's daughter?What the hell is SHE doing here?I can't believe the administrator is even speaking to her!Rachel half expected to see voodoo dolls of her father dangling everywhere. Theanimosity around her, though, was not the only emotion in the air; Rachel alsosensed a distinct smugness – as if NASA clearly knew who would be having thelast laugh.The administrator led Rachel toward a series of tables where a lone man sat at acomputer work station. He was dressed in a black turtleneck, wide-walecorduroys, and heavy boat shoes, rather than the matching NASA weather geareveryone else seemed to be wearing. He had his back to them.The administrator asked Rachel to wait as he went over and spoke to thestranger. After a moment, the man in the turtleneck gave him a congenial nod andstarted shutting down his computer. The administrator returned.\"Mr. Tolland will take it from here,\" he said. \"He's another one of thePresident's recruits, so you two should get along fine. I'll join you later.\"\"Thank you.\"\"I assume you've heard of Michael Tolland?\"Rachel shrugged, her brain still taking in the incredible surroundings. \"Namedoesn't ring a bell.\"The man in the turtleneck arrived, grinning. \"Doesn't ring a bell?\" His voicewas resonant and friendly. \"Best news I've heard all day. Seems I never get achance to make a first impression anymore.\"When Rachel glanced up at the newcomer, her feet froze in place. She knew theman's handsome face in an instant. Everyone in America did.\"Oh,\" she said, blushing as the man shook her hand. \"You're that MichaelTolland.\"When the President had told Rachel he had recruited top-notch civilianscientists to authenticate NASA's discovery, Rachel had imagined a group ofwizened nerds with monogrammed calculators. Michael Tolland was the antithesis.One of the best known \"science celebrities\" in America today, Tolland hosted aweekly documentary called Amazing Seas, during which he brought viewersface-to-face with spellbinding oceanic phenomena – underwater volcanoes,ten-foot sea worms, killer tidal waves. The media hailed Tolland as a crossbetween Jacques Cousteau and Carl Sagan, crediting his knowledge, unpretentiousenthusiasm, and lust for adventure as the formula that had rocketed Amazing Seasto the top of the ratings. Of course, most critics admitted, Tolland's ruggedgood looks and self-effacing charisma probably didn't hurt his popularity withthe female audience.\"Mr. Tolland...,\" Rachel said, fumbling the words a bit. \"I'm Rachel Sexton.\"Tolland smiled a pleasant, crooked smile. \"Hi, Rachel. Call me Mike.\"Rachel found herself uncharacteristically tongue-tied. Sensory overload wassetting in... the habisphere, the meteorite, the secrets, finding herselfunexpectedly face-to-face with a television star. \"I'm surprised to see youhere,\" she said, attempting to recover. \"When the President told me he'drecruited civilian scientists for authentication of a NASA find, I guess Iexpected...\" She hesitated.\"Real scientists?\" Tolland grinned.Rachel flushed, mortified. \"That's not what I meant.\"\"Don't worry about it,\" Tolland said. \"That's all I've heard since I got here.\"The administrator excused himself, promising to catch up with them later.Tolland turned now to Rachel with a curious look. \"The administrator tells meyour father is Senator Sexton?\"Rachel nodded. Unfortunately.\"A Sexton spy behind enemy lines?\"\"Battle lines are not always drawn where you might think.\"An awkward silence.\"So tell me,\" Rachel said quickly, \"what's a world-famous oceanographer doing ona glacier with a bunch of NASA rocket scientists?\"Tolland chuckled. \"Actually, some guy who looked a lot like the President askedme to do him a favor. I opened my mouth to say 'Go to hell,' but somehow Iblurted, 'Yes, sir.'\"Rachel laughed for the first time all morning. \"Join the club.\"Although most celebrities seemed smaller in person, Rachel thought MichaelTolland appeared taller. His brown eyes were just as vigilant and passionate asthey were on television, and his voice carried the same modest warmth andenthusiasm. Looking to be a weathered and athletic forty-five, Michael Tollandhad coarse black hair that fell in a permanent windswept tuft across hisforehead. He had a strong chin and a carefree mannerism that exuded confidence.When he'd shaken Rachel's hand, the callused roughness of his palms reminded herhe was not a typical \"soft\" television personality but rather an accomplishedseaman and hands-on researcher.\"To be honest,\" Tolland admitted, sounding sheepish, \"I think I was recruitedmore for my PR value than for my scientific knowledge. The president asked me tocome up and make a documentary for him.\"\"A documentary? About a meteorite? But you're an oceanographer.\"\"That's exactly what I told him! But he said he didn't know of any meteoritedocumentarians. He told me my involvement would help bring mainstreamcredibility to this find. Apparently he plans to broadcast my documentary aspart of tonight's big press conference when he announces the discovery.\"A celebrity spokesman. Rachel sensed the savvy political maneuverings of ZachHerney at work. NASA was often accused of talking over the public's head. Notthis time. They'd pulled in the master scientific communicator, a face Americansalready knew and trusted when it came to science.Tolland pointed kitty-corner across the dome to a far wall where a press areawas being set up. There was a blue carpet on the ice, television cameras, medialights, a long table with several microphones. Someone was hanging a backdrop ofa huge American flag.\"That's for tonight,\" he explained. \"The NASA administrator and some of his topscientists will be connected live via satellite to the White House so they canparticipate in the President's eight o'clock broadcast.\"Appropriate, Rachel thought, pleased to know Zach Herney didn't plan to cut NASAout of the announcement entirely.\"So,\" Rachel said with a sigh, \"is someone finally going to tell me what's sospecial about this meteorite?\"Tolland arched his eyebrows and gave her a mysterious grin. \"Actually, what's sospecial about this meteorite is best seen, not explained.\" He motioned forRachel to follow him toward the neighboring work area. \"The guy stationed overhere has plenty of samples he can show you.\"\"Samples? You actually have samples of the meteorite?\"\"Absolutely. We've drilled quite a few. In fact, it was the initial core samplesthat alerted NASA to the importance of the find.\"Unsure of what to expect, Rachel followed Tolland into the work area. Itappeared deserted. A cup of coffee sat on a desk scattered with rock samples,calipers, and other diagnostic gear. The coffee was steaming.\"Marlinson!\" Tolland yelled, looking around. No answer. He gave a frustratedsigh and turned to Rachel. \"He probably got lost trying to find cream for hiscoffee. I'm telling you, I went to Princeton postgrad with this guy, and he usedto get lost in his own dorm. Now he's a National Medal of Science recipient inastrophysics. Go figure.\"Rachel did a double take. \"Marlinson? You don't by any chance mean the famousCorky Marlinson, do you?\"Tolland laughed. \"One and the same.\"Rachel was stunned. \"Corky Marlinson is here?\" Marlinson's ideas ongravitational fields were legendary among NRO satellite engineers. \"Marlinson isone of the President's civilian recruits?\"\"Yeah, one of the real scientists.\"Real is right, Rachel thought. Corky Marlinson was as brilliant and respected asthey came.\"The incredible paradox about Corky,\" Tolland said, \"is that he can quote youthe distance to Alpha Centauri in millimeters, but he can't tie his ownnecktie.\"\"I wear clip-ons!\" a nasal, good-natured voice barked nearby. \"Efficiency overstyle, Mike. You Hollywood types don't understand that!\"Rachel and Tolland turned to the man now emerging from behind a large stack ofelectronic gear. He was squat and rotund, resembling a pug dog with bubble eyesand a thinning, comb-over haircut. When the man saw Tolland standing withRachel, he stopped in his tracks.\"Jesus Christ, Mike! We're at the friggin' North Pole and you still manage tomeet gorgeous women. I knew I should have gone into television!\"Michael Tolland was visibly embarrassed. \"Ms. Sexton, please excuse Dr.Marlinson. What he lacks in tact, he more than makes up for in random bits oftotally useless knowledge about our universe.\"Corky approached. \"A true pleasure, ma'am. I didn't catch your name.\"\"Rachel,\" she said. \"Rachel Sexton.\"\"Sexton?\" Corky let out a playful gasp. \"No relation to that shortsighted,depraved senator, I hope!\"Tolland winced. \"Actually, Corky, Senator Sexton is Rachel's father.\"Corky stopped laughing and slumped. \"You know, Mike, it's really no wonder I'venever had any luck with the ladies.\"22Prize-winning astrophysicist Corky Marlinson ushered Rachel and Tolland into hiswork area and began sifting through his tools and rock samples. The man movedlike a tightly wound spring about to explode.\"All right,\" he said, quivering excitedly, \"Ms. Sexton, you're about to get theCorky Marlinson thirty-second meteorite primer.\"Tolland gave Rachel a be-patient wink. \"Bear with him. The man really wanted tobe an actor.\"\"Yeah, and Mike wanted to be a respected scientist.\" Corky rooted around in ashoebox and produced three small rock samples and aligned them on his desk.\"These are the three main classes of meteorites in the world.\"Rachel looked at the three samples. All appeared as awkward spheroids about thesize of golf balls. Each had been sliced in half to reveal its cross section.\"All meteorites,\" Corky said, \"consist of varying amounts of nickel-iron alloys,silicates, and sulfides. We classify them on the basis of theirmetal-to-silicate ratios.\"Rachel already had the feeling Corky Marlinson's meteorite \"primer\" was going tobe more than thirty seconds.\"This first sample here,\" Corky said, pointing to a shiny, jet-black stone, \"isan iron-core meteorite. Very heavy. This little guy landed in Antarctica a fewyears back.\"Rachel studied the meteorite. It most certainly looked otherworldly – a blob ofheavy grayish iron whose outer crust was burned and blackened.\"That charred outer layer is called a fusion crust,\" Corky said. \"It's theresult of extreme heating as the meteor falls through our atmosphere. Allmeteorites exhibit that charring.\" Corky moved quickly to the next sample. \"Thisnext one is what we call a stony-iron meteorite.\"Rachel studied the sample, noting that it too was charred on the outside. Thissample, however, had a light-greenish tint, and the cross section looked like acollage of colorful angular fragments resembling a kaleidoscopic puzzle.\"Pretty,\" Rachel said.\"Are you kidding, it's gorgeous!\" Corky talked for a minute about the higholivine content causing the green luster, and then he reached dramatically forthe third and final sample, handing it to Rachel.Rachel held the final meteorite in her palm. This one was grayish brown incolor, resembling granite. It felt heavier than a terrestrial stone, but notsubstantially. The only indication suggesting it was anything other than anormal rock was its fusion crust – the scorched outer surface.\"This,\" Corky said with finality, \"is called a stony meteorite. It's the mostcommon class of meteorite. More than ninety percent of meteorites found on earthare of this category.\"Rachel was surprised. She had always pictured meteorites more like the firstsample – metallic, alien-looking blobs. The meteorite in her hand lookedanything but extraterrestrial. Aside from the charred exterior, it looked likesomething she might step over on the beach.Corky's eyes were bulging now with excitement. \"The meteorite buried in the icehere at Milne is a stony meteorite – a lot like the one in your hand. Stonymeteorites appear almost identical to our terrestrial igneous rocks, which makesthem tough to spot. Usually a blend of lightweight silicates – feldspar,olivine, pyroxene. Nothing too exciting.\"I'll say, Rachel thought, handing the sample back to him. \"This one looks like arock someone left in a fireplace and burned.\"Corky burst out laughing. \"One hell of a fireplace! The meanest blast furnaceever built doesn't come close to reproducing the heat a meteoroid feels when ithits our atmosphere. They get ravaged!\"Tolland gave Rachel an empathetic smile. \"This is the good part.\"\"Picture this,\" Corky said, taking the meteorite sample from Rachel. \"Let'simagine this little fella is the size of a house.\" He held the sample high overhis head. \"Okay... it's in space... floating across our solar system...cold-soaked from the temperature of space to minus one hundred degrees Celsius.\"Tolland was chuckling to himself, apparently already having seen Corky'sreenactment of the meteorite's arrival on Ellesmere Island.Corky began lowering the sample. \"Our meteorite is moving toward earth... and asit's getting very close, our gravity locks on... accelerating...accelerating...\"Rachel watched as Corky sped up the sample's trajectory, mimicking theacceleration of gravity.\"Now it's moving fast,\" Corky exclaimed. \"Over ten miles per second – thirty-sixthousand miles per hour! At 135 kilometers above the earth's surface, themeteorite begins to encounter friction with the atmosphere.\" Corky shook thesample violently as he lowered it toward the ice. \"Falling below one hundredkilometers, it's starting to glow! Now the atmospheric density is increasing,and the friction is incredible! The air around the meteoroid is becomingincandescent as the surface material melts from the heat.\" Corky started makingburning and sizzling sound effects. \"Now it's falling past the eighty-kilometermark, and the exterior becomes heated to over eighteen hundred degrees Celsius!\"Rachel watched in disbelief as the presidential award–winning astrophysicistshook the meteorite more fiercely, sputtering out juvenile sound effects.\"Sixty kilometers!\" Corky was shouting now. \"Our meteoroid encounters theatmospheric wall. The air is too dense! It violently decelerates at more thanthree hundred times the force of gravity!\" Corky made a screeching braking soundand slowed his descent dramatically. \"Instantly, the meteorite cools and stopsglowing. We've hit dark flight! The meteoroid's surface hardens from its moltenstage to a charred fusion crust.\"Rachel heard Tolland groan as Corky knelt on the ice to perform the coup degrâce – earth impact.\"Now,\" Corky said, \"our huge meteorite is skipping across our loweratmosphere...\" On his knees, he arched the meteorite toward the ground on ashallow slant. \"It's headed toward the Arctic Ocean... on an oblique angle...falling... looking almost like it will skip off the ocean... falling... and...\"He touched the sample to the ice. \"BAM!\"Rachel jumped.\"The impact is cataclysmic! The meteorite explodes. Fragments fly off, skippingand spinning across the ocean.\" Corky went into slow motion now, rolling andtumbling the sample across the invisible ocean toward Rachel's feet. \"One piecekeeps skimming, tumbling toward Ellesmere Island...\" He brought it right up toher toe. \"It skips off the ocean, bouncing up onto land...\" He moved it up andover the tongue of her shoe and rolled it to a stop on top of her foot near herankle. \"And finally comes to rest high on the Milne Glacier, where snow and icequickly cover it, protecting it from atmospheric erosion.\" Corky stood up with asmile.Rachel's mouth fell slack. She gave an impressed laugh. \"Well, Dr. Marlinson,that explanation was exceptionally...\"\"Lucid?\" Corky offered.Rachel smiled. \"In a word.\"Corky handed the sample back to her. \"Look at the cross section.\"Rachel studied the rock's interior a moment, seeing nothing.\"Tilt it into the light,\" Tolland prompted, his voice warm and kind. \"And lookclosely.\"Rachel brought the rock close to her eyes and tilted it against the dazzlinghalogens reflecting overhead. Now she saw it – tiny metallic globules glisteningin the stone. Dozens of them were peppered throughout the cross section likeminuscule droplets of mercury, each only about a millimeter across.\"Those little bubbles are called 'chondrules,'\" Corky said. \"And they occur onlyin meteorites.\"Rachel squinted at the droplets. \"Granted, I've never seen anything like this inan earth rock.\"\"Nor will you!\" Corky declared. \"Chondrules are one geologic structure we simplydo not have on earth. Some chondrules are exceptionally old – perhaps madeup ofthe earliest materials in the universe. Other chondrules are much younger, likethe ones in your hand. The chondrules in that meteorite date only about 190million years old.\"\"One hundred ninety million years is young?\"\"Heck, yes! In cosmological terms, that's yesterday. The point here, though, isthat this sample contains chondrules – conclusive meteoric evidence.\"\"Okay,\" Rachel said. \"Chondrules are conclusive. Got it.\"\"And finally,\" Corky said, heaving a sigh, \"if the fusion crust and chondrulesdon't convince you, we astronomers have a foolproof method to confirm meteoricorigin.\"\"Being?\"Corky gave a casual shrug. \"We simply use a petrographic polarizing microscope,an x-ray fluorescence spectrometer, a neutron activation analyzer, or aninduction-coupled plasma spectrometer to measure ferromagnetic ratios.\"Tolland groaned. \"Now he's showing off. What Corky means is that we can prove arock is a meteorite simply by measuring its chemical content.\"\"Hey, ocean boy!\" Corky chided. \"Let's leave the science to the scientists,shall we?\" He immediately turned back to Rachel. \"In earth rocks, the mineralnickel occurs in either extremely high percentages or extremely low; nothing inthe middle. In meteorites, though, the nickel content falls within a midrangeset of values. Therefore, if we analyze a sample and find the nickel contentreflects a midrange value, we can guarantee beyond the shadow of a doubt thatthe sample is a meteorite.\"Rachel felt exasperated. \"Okay, gentlemen, fusion crusts, chondrules, midrangenickel contents, all of which prove it's from space. I get the picture.\" Shelaid the sample back on Corky's table. \"But why am I here?\"Corky heaved a portentous sigh. \"You want to see a sample of the meteorite NASAfound in the ice underneath us?\"Before I die here, please.This time Corky reached in his breast pocket and produced a small, disk-shapedpiece of stone. The slice of rock was shaped like an audio CD, about half aninch thick, and appeared to be similar in composition to the stony meteorite shehad just seen.\"This is a slice of a core sample that we drilled yesterday.\" Corky handed thedisk to Rachel.The appearance certainly was not earth-shattering. It was an orangish-white,heavy rock. Part of the rim was charred and black, apparently a segment of themeteorite's outer skin. \"I see the fusion crust,\" she said.Corky nodded. \"Yeah, this sample was taken from near the outside of themeteorite, so it still has some crust on it.\"Rachel tilted the disk in the light and spotted the tiny metallic globules. \"AndI see the chondrules.\"\"Good,\" Corky said, his voice tense with excitement. \"And I can tell you fromhaving run this thing through a petrographic polarizing microscope that itsnickel content is midrange – nothing like a terrestrial rock. Congratulations,you've now successfully confirmed the rock in your hand came from space.\"Rachel looked up, confused. \"Dr. Marlinson, it's a meteorite. It's supposed tocome from space. Am I missing something here?\"Corky and Tolland exchanged knowing looks. Tolland put a hand on Rachel'sshoulder and whispered, \"Flip it over.\"Rachel turned the disk over so she could see the other side. It took only aninstant for her brain to process what she was looking at.Then the truth hit her like a truck.Impossible! she gasped, and yet as she stared at the rock she realized herdefinition of \"impossible\" had just changed forever. Embedded in the stone was aform that in an earth specimen might be considered commonplace, and yet in ameteorite was utterly inconceivable.\"It's...\" Rachel stammered, almost unable to speak the word. \"It's... a bug!This meteorite contains the fossil of a bug!\"Both Tolland and Corky were beaming. \"Welcome aboard,\" Corky said.The torrent of emotions that gripped Rachel left her momentarily mute, and yeteven in her bewilderment, she could clearly see that this fossil, beyondquestion, had once been a living biological organism. The petrified impressionwas about three inches long and looked to be the underside of some kind of hugebeetle or crawling insect. Seven pairs of hinged legs were clustered beneath aprotective outer shell, which seemed to be segmented in plates like that of anarmadillo.Rachel felt dizzy. \"An insect from space...\"\"It's an isopod,\" Corky said. \"Insects have three pairs of legs, not seven.\"Rachel did not even hear him. Her head was spinning as she studied the fossilbefore her.\"You can clearly see,\" Corky said, \"that the dorsal shell is segmented in plateslike a terrestrial pill bug, and yet the two prominent tail-like appendagesdifferentiate it as something closer to a louse.\"Rachel's mind had already tuned Corky out. The classification of the species wastotally irrelevant. The puzzle pieces now came crashing into place – thePresident's secrecy, the NASA excitement...There is a fossil in this meteorite! Not just a speck of bacteria or microbes,but an advanced life-form! Proof of life elsewhere in the universe!23Ten minutes into the CNN debate, Senator Sexton wondered how he could have beenworried at all. Marjorie Tench was grossly overestimated as an opponent. Despitethe senior adviser's reputation for ruthless sagacity, she was turning out to bemore of a sacrificial lamb than a worthy opponent.Granted, early in the conversation Tench had grabbed the upper hand by hammeringthe senator's prolife platform as biased against women, but then, just as itseemed Tench was tightening her grip, she'd made a careless mistake. Whilequestioning how the senator expected to fund educational improvements withoutraising taxes, Tench made a snide allusion to Sexton's constant scapegoating ofNASA.Although NASA was a topic Sexton definitely intended to address toward the endof the discussion, Marjorie Tench had opened the door early. Idiot!\"Speaking of NASA,\" Sexton segued casually. \"Can you comment on the rumors Ikeep hearing that NASA has suffered another recent failure?\"Marjorie Tench did not flinch. \"I'm afraid I have not heard that rumor.\" Hercigarette voice was like sandpaper.\"So, no comment?\"\"I'm afraid not.\"Sexton gloated. In the world of media sound bites, \"no comment\" translatedloosely to \"guilty as charged.\"\"I see,\" Sexton said. \"And how about the rumors of a secret, emergency meetingbetween the President and the administrator of NASA?\"This time Tench looked surprised. \"I'm not sure what meeting you're referringto. The President takes many meetings.\"\"Of course, he does.\" Sexton decided to go straight at her. \"Ms. Tench, you area great supporter of the space agency, is that right?\"Tench sighed, sounding tired of Sexton's pet issue. \"I believe in the importanceof preserving America's technological edge – be that military, industry,intelligence, telecommunications. NASA is certainly part of that vision. Yes.\"In the production booth, Sexton could see Gabrielle's eyes telling him to backoff, but Sexton could taste blood. \"I'm curious, ma'am, is it your influencebehind the President's continued support of this obviously ailing agency?\"Tench shook her head. \"No. The President is also a staunch believer in NASA. Hemakes his own decisions.\"Sexton could not believe his ears. He had just given Marjorie Tench a chance topartially exonerate the President by personally accepting some of the blame forNASA funding. Instead, Tench had thrown it right back at the President. ThePresident makes his own decisions. It seemed Tench was already trying todistance herself from a campaign in trouble. No big surprise. After all, whenthe dust settled, Marjorie Tench would be looking for a job.Over the next few minutes, Sexton and Tench parried. Tench made some weakattempts to change the subject, while Sexton kept pressing her on the NASAbudget.\"Senator,\" Tench argued, \"you want to cut NASA's budget, but do you have anyidea how many high-tech jobs will be lost?\"Sexton almost laughed in the woman's face. This gal is considered the smartestmind in Washington? Tench obviously had something to learn about thedemographics of this country. High-tech jobs were inconsequential in comparisonto the huge numbers of hardworking blue-collar Americans.Sexton pounced. \"We're talking about billions in savings here, Marjorie, and ifthe result is that a bunch of NASA scientists have to get in their BMWs and taketheir marketable skills elsewhere, then so be it. I'm committed to being toughon spending.\"Marjorie Tench fell silent, as if reeling from that last punch.The CNN host prompted, \"Ms. Tench? A reaction?\"The woman finally cleared her throat and spoke. \"I guess I'm just surprised tohear that Mr. Sexton is willing to establish himself as so staunchly anti-NASA.\"Sexton's eyes narrowed. Nice try, lady. \"I am not anti-NASA, and I resent theaccusation. I am simply saying that NASA's budget is indicative of the kind ofrunaway spending that your President endorses. NASA said they could build theshuttle for five billion; it cost twelve billion. They said they could build thespace station for eight billion; now it's one hundred billion.\"\"Americans are leaders,\" Tench countered, \"because we set lofty goals and stickto them through the tough times.\"\"That national pride speech doesn't work on me, Marge. NASA has overspent itsallowance three times in the past two years and crawled back to the Presidentwith its tail between its legs and asked for more money to fix its mistakes. Isthat national pride? If you want to talk about national pride, talk about strongschools. Talk about universal health care. Talk about smart kids growing up in acountry of opportunity. That's national pride!\"Tench glared. \"May I ask you a direct question, senator?\"Sexton did not respond. He simply waited.The woman's words came out deliberately, with a sudden infusion of grit.\"Senator, if I told you that we could not explore space for less than NASA iscurrently spending, would you act to abolish the space agency altogether?\"The question felt like a boulder landing in Sexton's lap. Maybe Tench wasn't sostupid after all. She had just blindsided Sexton with a \"fence-buster\" – acarefully crafted yes/no question designed to force a fence-straddling opponentto choose clear sides and clarify his position once and for all.Instinctively Sexton tried sidestepping. \"I have no doubt that with propermanagement NASA can explore space for a lot less than we are currently –\"\"Senator Sexton, answer the question. Exploring space is a dangerous and costlybusiness. It's much like building a passenger jet. We should either do it right– or not at all. The risks are too great. My question remains: If you becomepresident, and you are faced with the decision to continue NASA funding at itscurrent level or entirely scrap the U.S. space program, which would you choose?\"Shit. Sexton glanced up at Gabrielle through the glass. Her expression echoedwhat Sexton already knew. You're committed. Be direct. No waffling. Sexton heldhis chin high. \"Yes. I would transfer NASA's current budget directly into ourschool systems if faced with that decision. I would vote for our children overspace.\"The look on Marjorie Tench's face was one of absolute shock. \"I'm stunned. Did Ihear you correctly? As president, you would act to abolish this nation's spaceprogram?\"Sexton felt an anger simmering. Now Tench was putting words in his mouth. Hetried to counter, but Tench was already talking.\"So you're saying, senator, for the record, that you would do away with theagency that put men on the moon?\"\"I am saying that the space race is over! Times have changed. NASA no longerplays a critical role in the lives of everyday Americans and yet we continue tofund them as though they do.\"\"So you don't think space is the future?\"\"Obviously space is the future, but NASA is a dinosaur! Let the private sectorexplore space. American taxpayers shouldn't have to open their wallets everytime some Washington engineer wants to take a billion-dollar photograph ofJupiter. Americans are tired of selling out their children's future to fund anoutdated agency that provides so little in return for its gargantuan costs!\"Tench sighed dramatically. \"So little in return? With the exception perhaps ofthe SETI program, NASA has had enormous returns.\"Sexton was shocked that the mention of SETI had even escaped Tench's lips. Majorblunder. Thanks for reminding me. The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligencewas NASA's most abysmal money pit ever. Although NASA had tried to give theproject a facelift by renaming it \"Origins\" and shuffling some of itsobjectives, it was still the same losing gamble.\"Marjorie,\" Sexton said, taking his opening, \"I'll address SETI only because youmention it.\"Oddly, Tench looked almost eager to hear this.Sexton cleared his throat. \"Most people are not aware that NASA has been lookingfor ET for thirty-five years now. And it's a pricey treasure hunt – satellitedish arrays, huge transceivers, millions in salaries to scientists who sit inthe dark and listen to blank tape. It's an embarrassing waste of resources.\"\"You're saying there's nothing up there?\"\"I'm saying that if any other government agency had spent forty-five millionover thirty-five years and had not produced one single result, they would havebeen axed a long time ago.\" Sexton paused to let the gravity of the statementsettle in. \"After thirty-five years, I think it's pretty obvious we're not goingto find extraterrestrial life.\"\"And if you're wrong?\"Sexton rolled his eyes. \"Oh, for heavens sake, Ms. Tench, if I'm wrong I'll eatmy hat.\"Marjorie Tench locked her jaundiced eyes on Senator Sexton. \"I'll remember yousaid that, senator.\" She smiled for the first time. \"I think we all will.\"Six miles away, inside the Oval Office, President Zach Herney turned off thetelevision and poured himself a drink. As Marjorie Tench had promised, SenatorSexton had taken the bait – hook, line, and sinker.24Michael Tolland felt himself beaming empathetically as Rachel Sexton gaped insilence at the fossilized meteorite in her hand. The refined beauty of thewoman's face now seemed to dissolve into the expression of innocent wonder – ayoung girl who had just seen Santa Claus for the first time.I know just how you feel, he thought.Tolland had been struck the same way only forty-eight hours ago. He too had beenstunned into silence. Even now, the scientific and philosophical implications ofthe meteorite astounded him, forcing him to rethink everything he had everbelieved about nature.Tolland's oceanographic discoveries included several previously unknowndeepwater species, and yet this \"space bug\" was another level of breakthroughaltogether. Despite Hollywood's propensity for casting extraterrestrials aslittle green men, astrobiologists and science buffs all agreed that given thesheer numbers and adaptability of earth's insects, extraterrestrial life wouldin all probability be buglike if it were ever discovered.Insects were members of the phylum arthropoda – creatures having hard outerskeletons and jointed legs. With over 1.25 million known species and anestimated five hundred thousand still to be classified, earth's \"bugs\"outnumbered all of the other animals combined. They made up 95 percent of allthe planet's species and an astounding 40 percent of the planet's biomass.It was not so much the bugs' abundance that impressed as it was theirresilience. From the Antarctic ice beetle to Death Valley's sun scorpion, bugshappily inhabited deadly ranges in temperature, dryness, and even pressure. Theyalso had mastered exposure to the most deadly force known in the universe –radiation. Following a nuclear test in 1945, air force officers had donnedradiation suits and examined ground zero, only to discover cockroaches and antshappily carrying on as if nothing had happened. Astronomers realized that anarthropod's protective exoskeleton made it a perfectly viable candidate toinhabit the countless radiation-saturated planets where nothing else could live.It appeared the astrobiologists had been right, Tolland thought. ET is a bug.Rachel's legs felt weak beneath her. \"I can't... believe it,\" she said, turningthe fossil in her hands. \"I never thought...\"\"Give it some time to sink in,\" Tolland said, grinning. \"Took me twenty-fourhours to get my feet back under me.\"\"I see we have a newcomer,\" said an uncharacteristically tall Asian man, walkingover to join them.Corky and Tolland seemed to deflate instantly with the man's arrival. Apparentlythe moment of magic had been shattered.\"Dr. Wailee Ming,\" the man said, introducing himself. \"Chairman of paleontologyat UCLA.\"The man carried himself with the pompous rigidity of renaissance aristocracy,continuously stroking the out-of-place bow tie that he wore beneath hisknee-length camel-hair coat. Wailee Ming was apparently not one to let a remotesetting come in the way of his prim appearance.\"I'm Rachel Sexton.\" Her hand was still trembling as she shook Ming's smoothpalm. Ming was obviously another of the President's civilian recruits.\"It would be my pleasure, Ms. Sexton,\" the paleontologist said, \"to tell youanything you want to know about these fossils.\"\"And plenty you don't want to know,\" Corky grumbled.Ming fingered his bow tie. \"My paleontologic specialty is extinct Arthropoda andMygalomorphae. Obviously the most impressive characteristic of this organism is–\"\"– is that it's from another friggin' planet!\" Corky interjected.Ming scowled and cleared his throat. \"The most impressive characteristic of thisorganism is that it fits perfectly into our Darwinian system of terrestrialtaxonomy and classification.\"Rachel glanced up. They can classify this thing? \"You mean kingdom, phylum,species, that sort of thing?\"\"Exactly,\" Ming said. \"This species, if found on earth, would be classified asthe order Isopoda and would fall into a class with about two thousand species oflice.\"\"Lice?\" she said. \"But it's huge.\"\"Taxonomy is not size specific. House cats and tigers are related.Classification is about physiology. This species is clearly a louse: It has aflattened body, seven pairs of legs, and a reproductive pouch identical instructure to wood lice, pill bugs, beach hoppers, sow bugs, and gribbles. Theother fossils clearly reveal more specialized –\"\"Other fossils?\"Ming glanced at Corky and Tolland. \"She doesn't know?\"Tolland shook his head.Ming's face brightened instantly. \"Ms. Sexton, you haven't heard the good partyet.\"\"There are more fossils,\" Corky interjected, clearly trying to steal Ming'sthunder. \"Lots more.\" Corky scurried over to a large manila envelope andretrieved a folded sheet of oversized paper. He spread it out on the desk infront of Rachel. \"After we drilled some cores, we dropped an x-ray camera down.This is a graphic rendering of the cross section.\"Rachel looked at the x-ray printout on the table, and immediately had to sitdown. The three-dimensional cross section of the meteorite was packed withdozens of these bugs.\"Paleolithic records,\" Ming said, \"are usually found in heavy concentrations.Often times, mud slides trap organisms en masse, covering nests or entirecommunities.\"Corky grinned. \"We think the collection in the meteorite represents a nest.\" Hepointed to one of the bugs on the printout. \"And there's mommy.\"Rachel looked at the specimen in question, and her jaw dropped. The bug lookedto be about two feet long.\"Big-ass louse, eh?\" Corky said.Rachel nodded, dumbstruck, as she pictured lice the size of bread loaveswandering around on some distant planet.\"On earth,\" Ming said, \"our bugs stay relatively small because gravity keepsthem in check. They can't grow larger than their exoskeletons can support.However, on a planet with diminished gravity, insects could evolve to muchgreater dimensions.\"\"Imagine swatting mosquitoes the size of condors,\" Corky joked, taking the coresample from Rachel and slipping it into his pocket.Ming scowled. \"You had better not be stealing that!\"\"Relax,\" Corky said. \"We've got eight tons more where this came from.\"Rachel's analytical mind churned through the data before her. \"But how can lifefrom space be so similar to life on earth? I mean, you're saying this bug fitsin our Darwinian classification?\"\"Perfectly,\" Corky said. \"And believe it or not, a lot of astronomers havepredicted that extraterrestrial life would be very similar to life on earth.\"\"But why?\" she demanded. \"This species came from an entirely differentenvironment.\"\"Panspermia.\" Corky smiled broadly.\"I beg your pardon?\"\"Panspermia is the theory that life was seeded here from another planet.\"Rachel stood up. \"You're losing me.\"Corky turned to Tolland. \"Mike, you're the primordial seas guy.\"Tolland looked happy to take over. \"Earth was once a lifeless planet, Rachel.Then suddenly, as if overnight, life exploded. Many biologists think theexplosion of life was the magical result of an ideal mixture of elements in theprimordial seas. But we've never been able to reproduce that in a lab, soreligious scholars have seized that failure as proof of God, meaning life couldnot exist unless God touched the primordial seas and infused them with life.\"\"But we astronomers,\" Corky declared, \"came up with another explanation for theovernight explosion of life on earth.\"\"Panspermia,\" Rachel said, now understanding what they were talking about. Shehad heard the panspermia theory before but didn't know its name. \"The theorythat a meteorite splashed into the primordial soup, bringing the first seeds ofmicrobial life to earth.\"\"Bingo,\" Corky said. \"Where they percolated and sprang to life.\"\"And if that's true,\" Rachel said, \"then the underlying ancestry of earth'slife-forms and extraterrestrial life-forms would be identical.\"\"Double bingo.\"Panspermia, Rachel thought, still barely able to grasp the implications. \"So,not only does this fossil confirm that life exists elsewhere in the universe,but it practically proves panspermia... that life on earth was seeded fromelsewhere in the universe.\"\"Triple bingo.\" Corky flashed her an enthusiastic nod. \"Technically, we may allbe extraterrestrials.\" He put his fingers over his head like two antennas,crossed his eyes, and wagged his tongue like some kind of insect.Tolland looked at Rachel with a pathetic grin. \"And this guy's the pinnacle ofour evolution.\"25Rachel Sexton felt a dreamlike mist swirling around her as she walked across thehabisphere, flanked by Michael Tolland. Corky and Ming followed close behind.\"You okay?\" Tolland asked, watching her.Rachel glanced over, giving a weak smile. \"Thanks. It's just... so much.\"Her mind reeled back to the infamous 1996 NASA discovery – ALH84001 – a Marsmeteorite that NASA claimed contained fossil traces of bacterial life. Sadly,only weeks after NASA's triumphant press conference, several civilian scientistsstepped forward with proof that the rock's \"signs of life\" were really nothingmore than kerogen produced by terrestrial contamination. NASA's credibility hadtaken a huge hit over that gaffe. The New York Times took the opportunity tosarcastically redefine the agency's acronym: NASA – NOT ALWAYS SCIENTIFICALLYACCURATE.In that same edition, paleobiologist Stephen Jay Gould summed up the problemswith ALH84001 by pointing out that the evidence in it was chemical andinferential, rather than \"solid,\" like an unambiguous bone or shell.Now, however, Rachel realized NASA had found irrefutable proof. No skepticalscientist could possibly step forward and question these fossils. NASA was nolonger touting blurry, enlarged photos of alleged microscopic bacteria – theywere offering up real meteorite samples where bio-organisms visible to the nakedeye had been embedded in the stone. Foot-long lice!Rachel had to laugh when she realized she'd been a childhood fan of a song byDavid Bowie that referred to \"spiders from Mars.\" Few would have guessed howclose the androgynous British pop star would come to foreseeing astrobiology'sgreatest moment.As the distant strains of the song ran through Rachel's mind, Corky hurried upbehind her. \"Has Mike bragged about his documentary yet?\"Rachel replied, \"No, but I'd love to hear about it.\"Corky slapped Tolland on the back. \"Go for it, big boy. Tell her why thePresident decided that the most important moment in science history should behanded over to a snorkeling TV star.\"Tolland groaned. \"Corky, if you don't mind?\"\"Fine, I'll explain,\" Corky said, prying his way in between them. \"As youprobably know, Ms. Sexton, the President will be giving a press conferencetonight to tell the world about the meteorite. Because the vast majority of theworld is made up of half-wits, the President asked Mike to come onboard and dumbeverything down for them.\"\"Thanks, Corky,\" Tolland said. \"Very nice.\" He looked at Rachel. \"What Corky'strying to say is that because there's so much scientific data to convey, thePresident thought a short visual documentary about the meteorite might help makethe information more accessible to mainstream America, many of whom, oddly,don't have advanced degrees in astrophysics.\"\"Did you know,\" Corky said to Rachel, \"that I've just learned our nation'sPresident is a closet fan of Amazing Seas?\" He shook his head in mock disgust.\"Zach Herney – the ruler of the free world – has his secretary tape Mike'sprogram so he can decompress after a long day.\"Tolland shrugged. \"The man's got taste, what can I say?\"Rachel was now starting to realize just how masterful the President's plan was.Politics was a media game, and Rachel could already imagine the enthusiasm andscientific credibility the face of Michael Tolland on-screen would bring to thepress conference. Zach Herney had recruited the ideal man to endorse his littleNASA coup. Skeptics would be hard-pressed to challenge the President's data ifit came from the nation's top television science personality as well as severalrespected civilian scientists.Corky said, \"Mike's already taken video depositions from all of us civilians forhis documentary, as well as from most of the top NASA specialists. And I'll betmy National Medal that you're next on his list.\"Rachel turned and eyed him. \"Me? What are you talking about? I have nocredentials. I'm an intelligence liaison.\"\"Then why did the President send you up here?\"\"He hasn't told me yet.\"An amused grin crossed Corky's lips. \"You're a White House intelligence liaisonwho deals in clarification and authentication of data, right?\"\"Yes, but nothing scientific.\"\"And you're the daughter of the man who built a campaign around criticizing themoney NASA has wasted in space?\"Rachel could hear it coming.\"You have to admit, Ms. Sexton,\" Ming chimed in, \"a deposition from you wouldgive this documentary a whole new dimension of credibility. If the Presidentsent you up here, he must want you to participate somehow.\"Rachel again flashed on William Pickering's concern that she was being used.Tolland checked his watch. \"We should probably head over,\" he said, motioningtoward the center of the habisphere. \"They should be getting close.\"\"Close to what?\" Rachel asked.\"Extraction time. NASA is bringing the meteorite to the surface. It should be upany time now.\"Rachel was stunned. \"You guys are actually removing an eight-ton rock from undertwo hundred feet of solid ice?\"Corky looked gleeful. \"You didn't think NASA was going to leave a discovery likethis buried in the ice, did you?\"\"No, but...,\" Rachel had seen no signs of large-scale excavation equipmentanywhere inside the habisphere. \"How the heck is NASA planning on getting themeteorite out?\"Corky puffed up. \"No problem. You're in a room full of rocket scientists!\"\"Blather,\" Ming scoffed, looking at Rachel. \"Dr. Marlinson enjoys flexing otherpeople's muscles. The truth is that everyone here was stumped about how to getthe meteorite out. It was Dr. Mangor who proposed a viable solution.\"\"I haven't met Dr. Mangor.\"\"Glaciologist from the University of New Hampshire,\" Tolland said. \"The fourthand final civilian scientist recruited by the President. And Ming here iscorrect, it was Mangor who figured it out.\"\"Okay,\" Rachel said. \"So what did this guy propose?\"\"Gal,\" Ming corrected, sounding smitten. \"Dr. Mangor is a woman.\"\"Debatable,\" Corky grumbled. He looked over at Rachel. \"And by the way, Dr.Mangor is going to hate you.\"Tolland shot Corky an angry look.\"Well, she will!\" Corky defended. \"She'll hate the competition.\"Rachel felt lost. \"I'm sorry? Competition?\"\"Ignore him,\" Tolland said. \"Unfortunately, the fact that Corky is a total moronsomehow escaped the National Science Committee. You and Dr. Mangor will getalong fine. She is a professional. She's considered one of the world's topglaciologists. She actually moved to Antarctica for a few years to study glacialmovement.\"\"Odd,\" Corky said, \"I heard UNH took up a donation and sent her there so theycould get some peace and quiet on campus.\"\"Are you aware,\" Ming snapped, seeming to have taken the comment personally,\"that Dr. Mangor almost died down there! She got lost in a storm and lived onseal blubber for five weeks before anyone found her.\"Corky whispered to Rachel, \"I heard no one was looking.\"26The limousine ride back from the CNN studio to Sexton's office felt long forGabrielle Ashe. The senator sat across from her, gazing out the window,obviously gloating over the debate.\"They sent Tench to an afternoon cable show,\" he said, turning with a handsomesmile. \"The White House is getting frantic.\"Gabrielle nodded, noncommittal. She'd sensed a look of smug satisfaction onMarjorie Tench's face as the woman drove off. It made her nervous.Sexton's personal cellphone rang, and he fished in his pocket to grab it. Thesenator, like most politicians, had a hierarchy of phone numbers at which hiscontacts could reach him, depending on how important they were. Whoever wascalling him now was at the top of the list; the call was coming in on Sexton'sprivate line, a number even Gabrielle was discouraged to call.\"Senator Sedgewick Sexton,\" he chimed, accentuating the musical quality of hisname.Gabrielle couldn't hear the caller over the sound of the limo, but Sextonlistened intently, replying with enthusiasm. \"Fantastic. I'm so pleased youcalled. I'm thinking six o'clock? Super. I have an apartment here in D.C.Private. Comfortable. You have the address, right? Okay. Looking forward tomeeting you. See you tonight then.\"Sexton hung up, looking pleased with himself.\"New Sexton fan?\" Gabrielle asked.\"They're multiplying,\" he said. \"This guy's a heavy hitter.\"\"Must be. Meeting him in your apartment?\" Sexton usually defended the sanctifiedprivacy of his apartment like a lion protecting its only remaining hiding place.Sexton shrugged. \"Yeah. Thought I'd give him the personal touch. This guy mighthave some pull in the home stretch. Got to keep making those personalconnections, you know. It's all about trust.\"Gabrielle nodded, pulling out Sexton's daily planner. \"You want me to put him inyour calendar?\"\"No need. I'd planned to take a night at home anyway.\"Gabrielle found tonight's page and noticed it was already shaded out in Sexton'shandwriting with the bold letters \"P.E.\" – Sexton shorthand for either personalevent, private evening, or piss-off everyone; nobody was quite sure which. Fromtime to time, the senator scheduled himself a \"P.E.\" night so he could hole upin his apartment, take his phones off the hook, and do what he enjoyed most –sip brandy with old cronies and pretend he'd forgotten about politics for theevening.Gabrielle gave him a surprised look. \"So you're actually letting businessintrude on prescheduled P.E. time? I'm impressed.\"\"This guy happened to catch me on a night when I've got some time. I'll talk tohim for a little while. See what he has to say.\"Gabrielle wanted to ask who this mystery caller was, but Sexton clearly wasbeing intentionally vague. Gabrielle had learned when not to pry.As they turned off the beltway and headed back toward Sexton's office building,Gabrielle glanced down again at the P.E. time blocked out in Sexton's plannerand had the strange sensation Sexton knew this call was coming.27The ice at the center of the NASA habisphere was dominated by an eighteen-foottripod structure of composite scaffolding, which looked like a cross between anoil rig and an awkward model of the Eiffel Tower. Rachel studied the device,unable to fathom how it could be used to extract the enormous meteorite.Beneath the tower, several winches had been screwed into steel plates affixed tothe ice with heavy bolts. Threaded through the winches, iron cables bankedupward over a series of pulleys atop the tower. From there, the cables plungedvertically downward into narrow bore holes drilled in the ice. Several largeNASA men took turns tightening the winches. With each new tightening, the cablesslithered a few inches upward through the bore holes, as if the men were raisingan anchor.I'm clearly missing something, Rachel thought, as she and the others movedcloser to the extraction site. The men seemed to be hoisting the meteoritedirectly through the ice.\"EVEN TENSION! DAMN IT!\" a woman's voice screamed nearby, with all the grace ofa chain saw.Rachel looked over to see a small woman in a bright yellow snowsuit smeared withgrease. She had her back to Rachel, but even so, Rachel had no trouble guessingthat she was in charge of this operation. Making notations on a clipboard, thewoman stalked back and forth like a disgusted drillmaster.\"Don't tell me you ladies are tired!\"Corky called out, \"Hey, Norah, quit bossing those poor NASA boys and come flirtwith me.\"The woman did not even turn around. \"Is that you, Marlinson? I'd know thatweenie little voice anywhere. Come back when you reach puberty.\"Corky turned to Rachel. \"Norah keeps us warm with her charm.\"\"I heard that, space boy,\" Dr. Mangor fired back, still making notes. \"And ifyou're checking out my ass, these snow pants add thirty pounds.\"\"No worries,\" Corky called. \"It's not your woolly-mammoth butt that drives mewild, it's your winning personality.\"\"Bite me.\"Corky laughed again. \"I have great news, Norah. Looks like you're not the onlywoman the President recruited.\"\"No shit. He recruited you.\"Tolland took over. \"Norah? Have you got a minute to meet someone?\"At the sound of Tolland's voice, Norah immediately stopped what she was doingand turned around. Her hardened demeanor dissolved instantly. \"Mike!\" She rushedover, beaming. \"Haven't seen you in a few hours.\"\"I've been editing the documentary.\"\"How's my segment?\"\"You look brilliant and lovely.\"\"He used special effects,\" Corky said.Norah ignored the remark, glancing now at Rachel with a polite but standoffishsmile. She looked back at Tolland. \"I hope you're not cheating on me, Mike.\"Tolland's rugged face flushed slightly as he made introductions. \"Norah, I'dlike you to meet Rachel Sexton. Ms. Sexton works in the intelligence communityand is here at the request of the President. Her father is Senator SedgewickSexton.\"The introduction brought a confused look to Norah's face. \"I won't even pretendto understand that one.\" Norah did not remove her gloves as she gave Rachel'shand a half-hearted shake. \"Welcome to the top of the world.\"Rachel smiled. \"Thanks.\" She was surprised to see that Norah Mangor, despite thetoughness of her voice, had a pleasant and impish countenance. Her pixie haircutwas brown with streaks of gray, and her eyes were keen and sharp – two icecrystals. There was a steely confidence about her that Rachel liked.\"Norah,\" Tolland said. \"Have you got a minute to share what you're doing withRachel?\"Norah arched her eyebrows. \"You two on a first-name basis already? My, my.\"Corky groaned. \"I told you, Mike.\"Norah Mangor showed Rachel around the base of the tower while Tolland and theothers trailed behind, talking among themselves.\"See those boreholes in the ice under the tripod?\" Norah asked, pointing, herinitial put-out tone softening now to one of rapt fervor for her work.Rachel nodded, gazing down at the holes in the ice. Each was about a foot indiameter and had a steel cable inserted into it.\"Those holes are left over from when we drilled core samples and took X rays ofthe meteorite. Now we're using them as entry points to lower heavy-duty screweyes down the empty shafts and screw them into the meteorite. After that, wedropped a couple hundred feet of braided cable down each hole, snagged the screweyes with industrial hooks, and now we're simply winching it up. It's takingthese ladies several hours to get it to the surface, but it's coming.\"\"I'm not sure I follow,\" Rachel said. \"The meteorite is under thousands of tonsof ice. How are you lifting it?\"Norah pointed to the top of the scaffolding where a narrow beam of pristine redlight shone vertically downward toward the ice beneath the tripod. Rachel hadseen it earlier and assumed it was simply some sort of visual indicator – apointer demarking the spot where the object was buried.\"That's a gallium arsenide semiconductor laser,\" Norah said.Rachel looked more closely at the beam of light and now saw that it had actuallymelted a tiny hole in the ice and shone down into the depths.\"Very hot beam,\" Norah said. \"We're heating the meteorite as we lift.\"When Rachel grasped the simple brilliance of the woman's plan, she wasimpressed. Norah had simply aimed the laser beam downward, melting through theice until the beam hit the meteorite. The stone, being too dense to be melted bya laser, began absorbing the laser's heat, eventually getting warm enough tomelt the ice around it. As the NASA men hoisted the hot meteorite, the heatedrock, combined with the upward pressure, melted the surrounding ice, clearing apathway to raise it to the surface. The melt water accumulating over themeteorite simply seeped back down around the edges of the stone to refill theshaft.Like a hot knife through a frozen stick of butter.Norah motioned to the NASA men on the winches. \"The generators can't handle thiskind of strain, so I'm using manpower to lift.\"\"That's crap!\" one of the workers interjected. \"She's using manpower because shelikes to see us sweat!\"\"Relax,\" Norah fired back. \"You girls have been bitching for two days thatyou're cold. I cured that. Now keep pulling.\"The workers laughed.\"What are the pylons for?\" Rachel asked, pointing to several orange highwaycones positioned around the tower at what appeared to be random locations.Rachel had seen similar cones dispersed around the dome.\"Critical glaciology tool,\" Norah said. \"We call them SHABAs. That's short for'step here and break ankle.'\" She picked up one of the pylons to reveal acircular bore hole that plunged like a bottomless well into the depths of theglacier. \"Bad place to step.\" She replaced the pylon. \"We drilled holes all overthe glacier for a structural continuity check. As in normal archeology, thenumber of years an object has been buried is indicated by how deep beneath thesurface it's found. The farther down one finds it, the longer it's been there.So when an object is discovered under the ice, we can date that object's arrivalby how much ice has accumulated on top of it. To make sure our core datingmeasurements are accurate, we check multiple areas of the ice sheet to confirmthat the area is one solid slab and hasn't been disrupted by earthquake,fissuring, avalanche, what have you.\"\"So how does this glacier look?\"\"Flawless,\" Norah said. \"A perfect, solid slab. No fault lines or glacialturnover. This meteorite is what we call a 'static fall.' It's been in the iceuntouched and unaffected since it landed in 1716.\"Rachel did a double take. \"You know the exact year it fell?\"Norah looked surprised by the question. \"Hell, yes. That's why they called mein. I read ice.\" She motioned to a nearby pile of cylindrical tubes of ice. Eachlooked like a translucent telephone pole and was marked with a bright orangetag. \"Those ice cores are a frozen geologic record.\" She led Rachel over to thetubes. \"If you look closely you can see individual layers in the ice.\"Rachel crouched down and could indeed see that the tube was made up of whatappeared to be strata of ice with subtle differences in luminosity and clarity.The layers varied between paper thin to about a quarter of an inch thick.\"Each winter brings a heavy snowfall to the ice shelf,\" Norah said, \"and eachspring brings a partial thaw. So we see a new compression layer every season. Wesimply start at the top – the most recent winter – and count backward.\"\"Like counting rings on a tree.\"\"It's not quite that simple, Ms. Sexton. Remember, we're measuring hundreds offeet of layerings. We need to read climatological markers to benchmark our work– precipitation records, airborne pollutants, that sort of thing.\"Tolland and the others joined them now. Tolland smiled at Rachel. \"She knows alot about ice, doesn't she?\"Rachel felt oddly happy to see him. \"Yeah, she's amazing.\"\"And for the record,\" Tolland nodded, \"Dr. Mangor's 1716 date is right on. NASAcame up with the exact same year of impact well before we even got here. Dr.Mangor drilled her own cores, ran her own tests, and confirmed NASA's work.\"Rachel was impressed.\"And coincidentally,\" Norah said, \"1716 is the exact year early explorersclaimed to have seen a bright fire-ball in the sky over northern Canada. Themeteor became known as the Jungersol Fall, after the name of the exploration'sleader.\"\"So,\" Corky added, \"the fact that the core dates and the historic record matchis virtual proof that we're looking at a fragment of the same meteorite thatJungersol recorded seeing in 1716.\"\"Dr. Mangor!\" one of the NASA workers called out \"Leader hasps are starting toshow!\"\"Tour's over, folks,\" Norah said. \"Moment of truth.\" She grabbed a foldingchair, climbed up onto it, and shouted out at the top of her lungs. \"Surfacingin five minutes, everyone!\"All around the dome, like Pavlovian dogs responding to a dinner bell, thescientists dropped what they were doing and hurried toward the extraction zone.Norah Mangor put her hands on her hips and surveyed her domain. \"Okay, let'sraise the Titanic.\"28\"Step aside!\" Norah hollered, moving through the growing crowd. The workersscattered. Norah took control, making a show of checking the cable tensions andalignments.\"Heave!\" one of the NASA men yelled. The men tightened their winches, and thecables ascended another six inches out of the hole.As the cables continued to move upward, Rachel felt the crowd inching forward inanticipation. Corky and Tolland were nearby, looking like kids at Christmas. Onthe far side of the hole, the hulking frame of NASA administrator LawrenceEkstrom arrived, taking a position to watch the extraction.\"Hasps!\" one of the NASA men yelled. \"Leaders are showing!\"The steel cables rising through the boreholes changed from silver braid toyellow leader chains.\"Six more feet! Keep it steady!\"The group around the scaffolding fell into a rapt silence, like onlookers at aséance awaiting the appearance of some divine specter – everyone straining forthe first glimpse.Then Rachel saw it.Emerging from the thinning layer of ice, the hazy form of the meteorite began toshow itself. The shadow was oblong and dark, blurry at first, but gettingclearer every moment as it melted its way upward.\"Tighter!\" a technician yelled. The men tightened the winches, and thescaffolding creaked.\"Five more feet! Keep the tension even!\"Rachel could now see the ice above the stone beginning to bulge upward like apregnant beast about to give birth. Atop the hump, surrounding the laser's pointof entry, a small circle of surface ice began to give way, melting, dissolvinginto a widening hole.\"Cervix is dilated!\" someone shouted. \"Nine hundred centimeters!\"A tense laughter broke the silence.\"Okay, kill the laser!\"Someone threw a switch, and the beam disappeared.And then it happened.Like the fiery arrival of some paleolithic god, the huge rock broke the surfacewith a hiss of steam. Through the swirling fog, the hulking shape rose out ofthe ice. The men manning the winches strained harder until finally the entirestone broke free of the frozen restraints and swung, hot and dripping, over anopen shaft of simmering water.Rachel felt mesmerized.Dangling there on its cables, dripping wet, the meteorite's rugged surfaceglistened in the fluorescent lights, charred and rippled with the appearance ofan enormous petrified prune. The rock was smooth and rounded on one end, thissection apparently blasted away by friction as it streaked through theatmosphere.Looking at the charred fusion crust, Rachel could almost see the meteorrocketing earthward in a furious ball of flames. Incredibly, that was centuriesago. Now, the captured beast hung there on its cables, water dripping from itsbody.The hunt was over.Not until this moment had the drama of this event truly struck Rachel. Theobject hanging before her was from another world, millions of miles away. Andtrapped within it was evidence – no, proof – that man was not alone in theuniverse.The euphoria of the moment seemed to grip everyone at the same instant, and thecrowd broke into spontaneous hoots and applause. Even the administrator seemedcaught up in it. He clapped his men and women on the back, congratulating them.Looking on, Rachel felt a sudden joy for NASA. They'd had some tough luck in thepast. Finally things were changing. They deserved this moment.The gaping hole in the ice now looked like a small swimming pool in the middleof the habisphere. The surface of the two-hundred-foot-deep pool of melted watersloshed for a while against the icy walls of the shaft and then finally grewcalm. The waterline in the shaft was a good four feet beneath the glacier'ssurface, the discrepancy caused by both the removal of the meteorite's mass andice's property of shrinking as it melts.Norah Mangor immediately set up SHABA pylons all around the hole. Although thehole was clearly visible, any curious soul who ventured too close andaccidentally slipped in would be in dire jeopardy. The walls of the shaft weresolid ice, with no footholds, and climbing out unassisted would be impossible.Lawrence Ekstrom came padding across the ice toward them. He moved directly toNorah Mangor and shook her hand firmly. \"Well done, Dr. Mangor.\"\"I'll expect lots of praise in print,\" Norah replied.\"You'll get it.\" The administrator turned now to Rachel. He looked happier,relieved. \"So, Ms. Sexton, is the professional skeptic convinced?\"Rachel couldn't help but smile. \"Stunned is more like it.\"\"Good. Then follow me.\"Rachel followed the administrator across the habisphere to a large metal boxthat resembled an industrial shipping container. The box was painted withmilitary camouflage patterns and stenciled letters: P-S-C.\"You'll call the President from in here,\" Ekstrom said.Portable Secure Comm, Rachel thought. These mobile communications booths werestandard battlefield installations, although Rachel had never expected to seeone used as part of a peacetime NASA mission. Then again, AdministratorEkstrom's background was the Pentagon, so he certainly had access to toys likethis. From the stern faces on the two armed guards watching over the PSC, Rachelgot the distinct impression that contact with the outside world was made onlywith express consent from Administrator Ekstrom.Looks like I'm not the only one who is off-the-grid.Ekstrom spoke briefly with one of the guards outside the trailer and thenreturned to Rachel. \"Good luck,\" he said. Then he left.A guard rapped on the trailer door, and it opened from within. A technicianemerged and motioned for Rachel to enter. She followed him in.The inside of the PSC was dark and stuffy. In the bluish glow of the lonecomputer monitor, Rachel could make out racks of telephone gear, radios, andsatellite telecommunications devices. She already felt claustrophobic. The airinside was bitter, like a basement in winter.\"Sit here, please, Ms. Sexton.\" The technician produced a rolling stool andpositioned Rachel in front of a flat-screen monitor. He arranged a microphone infront of her and placed a bulky pair of AKG headphones on her head. Checking alogbook of encryption passwords, the technician typed a long series of keys on anearby device. A timer materialized on the screen in front of Rachel.00:60 SECONDSThe technician gave a satisfied nod as the timer began to count down. \"Oneminute until connection.\" He turned and left, slamming the door behind him.Rachel could hear the bolt lock outside.Great.As she waited in the dark, watching the sixty-second clock slowly count down,she realized that this was the first moment of privacy she'd had since earlythat morning. She'd woken up today without the slightest inkling of what layahead. Extraterrestrial life. As of today, the most popular modern myth of alltime was no longer a myth.Rachel was just now starting to sense how truly devastating this meteorite wouldbe to her father's campaign. Although NASA funding had no business being on apolitical par with abortion rights, welfare, and health care, her father hadmade it an issue. Now it was going to blow up in his face.Within hours, Americans would feel the thrill of a NASA triumph all over again.There would be teary-eyed dreamers. Slack-jawed scientists. Children'simaginations running free. Issues of dollars and cents would fade away as petty,overshadowed by this monumental moment. The President would emerge like aphoenix, transforming himself into a hero, while in the midst of thecelebration, the businesslike senator would suddenly appear small-minded, apenny-pinching Scrooge with no American sense of adventure.The computer beeped, and Rachel glanced up.00:05 SECONDSThe screen in front of her flickered suddenly, and a blurry image of the WhiteHouse seal materialized on-screen. After a moment, the image dissolved into theface of President Herney.\"Hello, Rachel,\" he said, a mischievous glint in his eye. \"I trust you've had aninteresting afternoon?\"29The office of Senator Sedgewick Sexton was located in the Philip A. Hart SenateOffice Building on C Street to the northeast of the Capitol. The building was aneo-modern grid of white rectangles that critics claimed looked more like aprison than an office building. Many who worked there felt the same.On the third floor, Gabrielle Ashe's long legs paced briskly back and forth infront of her computer terminal. On the screen was a new e-mail message. She wasnot sure what to make of it.The first two lines read:SEDGEWICK WAS IMPRESSIVE ON CNN.I HAVE MORE INFORMATION FOR YOU.Gabrielle had been receiving messages like this for the last couple of weeks.The return address was bogus, although she'd been able to track it to a\"whitehouse.gov\" domain. It seemed her mysterious informant was a White Houseinsider, and whoever it was had become Gabrielle's source for all kinds ofvaluable political information recently, including the news of a covert meetingbetween the NASA administrator and the President.Gabrielle had been leery of the e-mails at first, but when she checked out thetips, she was amazed to find the information consistently accurate and helpful –classified information on NASA overexpenditures, costly upcoming missions, datashowing that NASA's search for extraterrestrial life was grossly overfunded andpathetically unproductive, even internal opinion polls warning that NASA was theissue turning voters away from the President.To enhance her perceived value to the senator, Gabrielle had not informed himshe was receiving unsolicited e-mail help from inside the White House. Instead,she simply passed the information to him as coming from \"one of her sources.\"Sexton was always appreciative and seemed to know better than to ask who hersource was. She could tell he suspected Gabrielle was doing sexual favors.Troublingly, it didn't seem to bother him in the least.Gabrielle stopped pacing and looked again at the newly arrived message. Theconnotations of all the e-mails were clear: Someone inside the White Housewanted Senator Sexton to win this election and was helping him do it by aidinghis attack against NASA.But who? And why?A rat from a sinking ship, Gabrielle decided. In Washington it was not at alluncommon for a White House employee, fearing his President was about to beousted from office, to offer quiet favors to the apparent successor in hopes ofsecuring power or another position after the changeover. It seemed someonesmelled Sexton victory and was buying stock early.The message currently on Gabrielle's screen made her nervous. It was like noneother she had ever received. The first two lines didn't bother her so much. Itwas the last two:EAST APPOINTMENT GATE, 4:30 P.M.COME ALONE.Her informant had never before asked to meet in person. Even so, Gabrielle wouldhave expected a more subtle location for a face-to-face meeting. EastAppointment Gate? Only one East Appointment Gate existed in Washington, as faras she knew. Outside the White House? Is this some kind of joke?Gabrielle knew she could not respond via e-mail; her messages were alwaysbounced back as undeliverable. Her correspondent's account was anonymous. Notsurprising.Should I consult Sexton? She quickly decided against it. He was in a meeting.Besides, if she told him about this e-mail, she'd have to tell him about theothers. She decided her informant's offer to meet in public in broad daylightmust be to make Gabrielle feel safe. After all, this person had done nothing buthelp her for the last two weeks. He or she was obviously a friend.Reading the e-mail one last time, Gabrielle checked the clock. She had an hour.30The NASA administrator was feeling less edgy now that the meteorite wassuccessfully out of the ice. Everything is falling into place, he told himselfas he headed across the dome to the work area of Michael Tolland. Nothing canstop us now.\"How's it coming?\" Ekstrom asked, striding up behind the television scientist.Tolland glanced up from his computer, looking tired but enthusiastic. \"Editingis almost done. I'm just overlaying some of the extraction footage your peopleshot. Should be done momentarily.\"\"Good.\" The President had asked Ekstrom to upload Tolland's documentary to theWhite House as soon as possible.Although Ekstrom had been cynical about the President's desire to use MichaelTolland on this project, seeing the rough cuts of Tolland's documentary hadchanged Ekstrom's mind. The television star's spirited narrative, combined withhis interviews of the civilian scientists, had been brilliantly fused into athrilling and comprehensible fifteen minutes of scientific programming. Tollandhad achieved effortlessly what NASA so often failed to do – describe ascientific discovery at the level of the average American intellect withoutbeing patronizing.\"When you're done editing,\" Ekstrom said, \"bring the finished product over tothe press area. I'll have someone upload a digital copy to the White House.\"\"Yes, sir.\" Tolland went back to work.Ekstrom moved on. When he arrived at the north wall, he was encouraged to findthe habisphere's \"press area\" had come together nicely. A large blue carpet hadbeen rolled out on the ice. Centered on the rug sat a long symposium table withseveral microphones, a NASA drape, and an enormous American flag as a backdrop.To complete the visual drama, the meteorite had been transported on a palettesled to its position of honor, directly in front of the symposium table.Ekstrom was pleased to see the mood in the press area was one of celebration.Much of his staff was now crowded around the meteorite, holding their hands outover its still-warm mass like campers around a campfire.Ekstrom decided that this was the moment. He walked over to several cardboardboxes sitting on the ice behind the press area. He'd had the boxes flown in fromGreenland this morning.\"Drinks are on me!\" he yelled, handing out cans of beer to his cavorting staff.\"Hey, boss!\" someone yelled. \"Thanks! It's even cold!\"Ekstrom gave a rare smile. \"I've been keeping it on ice.\"Everyone laughed.\"Wait a minute!\" someone else yelled, scowling good-naturedly at his can. \"Thisstuff's Canadian! Where's your patriotism?\"\"We're on a budget, here, folks. Cheapest stuff I could find.\"More laughter.\"Attention shoppers,\" one of the NASA television crew yelled into a megaphone.\"We're about to switch to media lighting. You may experience temporaryblindness.\"\"And no kissing in the dark,\" someone yelled. \"This is a family program!\"Ekstrom chuckled, enjoying the raillery as his crew made final adjustments tothe spotlights and accent lighting.\"Switching to media lighting in five, four, three, two...\"The dome's interior dimmed rapidly as the halogen lamps shut down. Withinseconds, all the lights were off. An impenetrable darkness engulfed the dome.Someone let out a mock scream.\"Who pinched my ass?\" someone yelled, laughing.The blackness lasted only a moment before it was pierced by the intense glare ofmedia spotlights. Everyone squinted. The transformation was now complete; thenorth quadrant of the NASA habisphere had become a television studio. Theremainder of the dome now looked like a gaping barn at night. The only light inthe other sections was the muted reflection of the media lights reflecting offthe arched ceiling and throwing long shadows across the now deserted workstations.Ekstrom stepped back into the shadows, gratified to see his team carousingaround the illuminated meteorite. He felt like a father at Christmas, watchinghis kids enjoy themselves around the tree.God knows they deserve it, Ekstrom thought, never suspecting what calamity layahead."},{"pageContent":"31The weather was changing.Like a mournful harbinger of impending conflict, the katabatic wind let out aplaintive howl and gusted hard against the Delta Force's shelter. Delta-Onefinished battening down the storm coverings and went back inside to his twopartners. They'd been through this before. It would soon pass.Delta-Two was staring at the live video feed from the microbot. \"You better lookat this,\" he said.Delta-One came over. The inside of the habisphere was in total darkness exceptfor the bright lighting on the north side of the dome near the stage. Theremainder of the habisphere appeared only as a dim outline. \"It's nothing,\" hesaid. \"They're just testing their television lighting for tonight.\"\"The lighting's not the problem.\" Delta-Two pointed to the dark blob in themiddle of the ice – the water-filled hole from which the meteorite had beenextracted. \"That's the problem.\"Delta-One looked at the hole. It was still surrounded by pylons, and the surfaceof the water appeared calm. \"I don't see anything.\"\"Look again.\" He maneuvered the joystick, spiraling the microbot down toward thesurface of the hole.As Delta-One studied the darkened pool of melted water more closely, he sawsomething that caused him to recoil in shock. \"What the...?\"Delta-Three came over and looked. He too looked stunned. \"My God. Is that theextraction pit? Is the water supposed to be doing that?\"\"No,\" Delta-One said. \"It sure as hell isn't.\"32Although Rachel Sexton was currently sitting inside a large metal box situatedthree thousand miles from Washington, D.C., she felt the same pressure as ifshe'd been summoned to the White House. The videophone monitor before herdisplayed a crystal clear image of President Zach Herney seated in the WhiteHouse communications room before the presidential seal. The digital audioconnection was flawless, and with the exception of an almost imperceptibledelay, the man could have been in the next room.Their conversation was upbeat and direct. The President seemed pleased, thoughnot at all surprised, by Rachel's favorable assessment of NASA's find and of hischoice to use Michael Tolland's captivating persona as a spokesman. ThePresident's mood was good-natured and jocular.\"As I'm sure you will agree,\" Herney said, his voice growing more serious now,\"in a perfect world, the ramifications of this discovery would be purelyscientific in nature.\" He paused, leaning forward, his face filling the screen.\"Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world, and this NASA triumph is goingto be a political football the moment I announce it.\"\"Considering the conclusive proof and who you've recruited for endorsements, Ican't imagine how the public or any of your opposition will be able to doanything other than accept this discovery as confirmed fact.\"Herney gave an almost sad chuckle. \"My political opponents will believe whatthey see, Rachel. My concerns are that they won't like what they see.\"Rachel noted how careful the President was being not to mention her father. Hespoke only in terms of \"the opposition\" or \"political opponents.\" \"And you thinkyour opposition will cry conspiracy simply for political reasons?\" she asked.\"That is the nature of the game. All anyone needs to do is cast a faint doubt,saying that this discovery is some kind of political fraud concocted by NASA andthe White House, and all of a sudden, I'm facing an inquiry. The newspapersforget NASA has found proof of extraterrestrial life, and the media startsfocusing on uncovering evidence of a conspiracy. Sadly, any innuendo ofconspiracy with respect to this discovery will be bad for science, bad for theWhite House, bad for NASA, and, quite frankly, bad for the country.\"\"Which is why you postponed announcing until you had full confirmation and somereputable civilian endorsements.\"\"My goal is to present this data in so incontrovertible a way that any cynicismis nipped in the bud. I want this discovery celebrated with the untainteddignity it deserves. NASA merits no less.\"Rachel's intuition was tingling now. What does he want from me?\"Obviously,\" he continued, \"you're in a unique position to help me. Yourexperience as an analyst as well as your obvious ties to my opponent give youenormous credibility with respect to this discovery.\"Rachel felt a growing disillusionment. He wants to use me... just like Pickeringsaid he would!\"That said,\" Herney continued, \"I would like to ask that you endorse thisdiscovery personally, for the record, as my White House intelligence liaison...and as the daughter of my opponent.\"There it was. On the table.Herney wants me to endorse.Rachel really had thought Zach Herney was above this kind of spiteful politics.A public endorsement from Rachel would immediately make the meteorite a personalissue for her father, leaving the senator unable to attack the discovery'scredibility without attacking the credibility of his own daughter – a deathsentence for a \"families first\" candidate.\"Frankly, sir,\" Rachel said, looking into the monitor, \"I'm stunned you wouldask me to do that.\"The President looked taken aback. \"I thought you would be excited to help out.\"\"Excited? Sir, my differences with my father aside, this request puts me in animpossible position. I have enough problems with my father without goinghead-to-head with him in some kind of public death match. Despite my admitteddislike of the man, he is my father, and pitting me against him in a publicforum frankly seems beneath you.\"\"Hold on!\" Herney waved his hands in surrender.\"Who said anything about a public forum?\"Rachel paused. \"I assume you'd like me to join the administrator of NASA on thepodium for the eight o'clock press conference.\"Herney's guffaw boomed in the audio speakers. \"Rachel, what kind of man do youthink I am? Do you really imagine I'd ask someone to stab her father in the backon national television?\"\"But, you said –\"\"And do you think I would make the NASA administrator share the limelight withthe daughter of his arch enemy? Not to burst your bubble, Rachel, but this pressconference is a scientific presentation. I'm not sure your knowledge ofmeteorites, fossils, or ice structures would lend the event much credibility.\"Rachel felt herself flush. \"But then... what endorsement did you have in mind?\"\"One more appropriate to your position.\"\"Sir?\"\"You are my White House intelligence liaison. You brief my staff on issues ofnational importance.\"\"You want me to endorse this for your staff?\"Herney still looked amused by the misunderstanding. \"Yes, I do. The skepticismI'll face outside the White House is nothing compared to what I'm facing from mystaff right now. We're in the midst of a full-scale mutiny here. My credibilityin-house is shot. My staff has begged me to cut back NASA funding. I've ignoredthem, and it's been political suicide.\"\"Until now.\"\"Exactly. As we discussed this morning, this discovery's timing will seemsuspect to political cynics, and nobody's as cynical as my staff is at themoment. Therefore, when they hear this information for the first time, I want itto come from –\"\"You haven't told your staff about the meteorite?\"\"Only a few top advisers. Keeping this discovery a secret has been a toppriority.\"Rachel was stunned. No wonder he's facing a mutiny. \"But this is not my usualarea. A meteorite could hardly be considered an intelligence-related gist.\"\"Not in the traditional sense, but it certainly has all the elements of yourusual work – complex data that needs to be distilled, substantial politicalramifications –\"\"I am not a meteorite specialist, sir. Shouldn't your staff be briefed by theadministrator of NASA?\"\"Are you kidding? Everyone here hates him. As far as my staff is concerned,Ekstrom is the snake-oil salesman who has lured me into bad deal after baddeal.\"Rachel could see the point. \"How about Corky Marlinson? The National Medal inAstrophysics? He's got far more credibility than I do.\"\"My staff is made up of politicians, Rachel, not scientists. You've met Dr.Marlinson. I think he's terrific, but if I let an astrophysicist loose on myteam of left-brain, think-inside-the-box intellectuals, I'll end up with a herdof deer in the headlights. I need someone accessible. You're the one, Rachel. Mystaff knows your work, and considering your family name, you're about asunbiased a spokesperson as my staff could hope to hear from.\"Rachel felt herself being pulled in by the President's affable style. \"At leastyou admit my being the daughter of your opponent has something to do with yourrequest.\"The President gave a sheepish chuckle. \"Of course it does. But, as you canimagine, my staff will be briefed one way or another, no matter what you decide.You are not the cake, Rachel, you are simply the icing. You are the individualmost qualified to do this briefing, and you also happen to be a close relativeof the man who wants to kick my staff out of the White House next term. You'vegot credibility on two accounts.\"\"You should be in sales.\"\"As a matter of fact, I am. As is your father. And to be honest, I'd like toclose a deal for a change.\" The President removed his glasses and looked intoRachel's eyes. She felt a touch of her father's power in him. \"I am asking youas a favor, Rachel, and also because I believe it is part of your job. So whichis it? Yes or no? Will you brief my staff on this matter?\"Rachel felt trapped inside the tiny PSC trailer. Nothing like the hard sell.Even from three thousand miles away, Rachel could feel the strength of his willpressing through the video screen. She also knew this was a perfectly reasonablerequest, whether she liked it or not.\"I'd have conditions,\" Rachel said.Herney arched his eyebrows. \"Being?\"\"I meet your staff in private. No reporters. This is a private briefing, not apublic endorsement.\"\"You have my word. Your meeting is already slated for a very private location.\"Rachel sighed. \"All right then.\"The President beamed. \"Excellent.\"Rachel checked her watch, surprised to see it was already a little past fouro'clock. \"Hold on,\" she said, puzzled, \"if you're going live at eight P.M., wedon't have time. Even in that vile contraption you sent me up here in, Icouldn't get back to the White House for another couple of hours at the veryfastest. I'd have to prepare my remarks and –\"The President shook his head. \"I'm afraid I didn't make myself clear. You'll bedoing the briefing from where you are via video conference.\"\"Oh.\" Rachel hesitated. \"What time did you have in mind?\"\"Actually,\" Herney said, grinning. \"How about right now? Everyone is alreadyassembled, and they're staring at a big blank television set. They're waitingfor you.\"Rachel's body tensed. \"Sir, I'm totally unprepared. I can't possibly –\"\"Just tell them the truth. How hard is that?\"\"But –\"\"Rachel,\" the President said, leaning toward the screen. \"Remember, you compileand relay data for a living. It's what you do. Just talk about what's going onup there.\" He reached up to flick a switch on his video transmission gear, butpaused. \"And I think you'll be pleased to find I've set you up in a position ofpower.\"Rachel didn't understand what he meant, but it was too late to ask. ThePresident threw the switch.The screen in front of Rachel went blank for a moment. When it refreshed, Rachelwas staring at one of the most unnerving images she had ever seen. Directly infront of her was the White House Oval Office. It was packed. Standing room only.The entire White House staff appeared to be there. And every one of them wasstaring at her. Rachel now realized her view was from atop the President's desk.Speaking from a position of power. Rachel was sweating already.From the looks on the faces of the White House staffers, they were as surprisedto see Rachel as she was to see them.\"Ms. Sexton?\" a raspy voice called out.Rachel searched the sea of faces and found who had spoken. It was a lanky womanjust now taking a seat in the front row. Marjorie Tench. The woman's distinctiveappearance was unmistakable, even in a crowd.\"Thank you for joining us, Ms. Sexton,\" Marjorie Tench said, sounding smug. \"ThePresident tells us you have some news?\"33Enjoying the darkness, paleontologist Wailee Ming sat alone in quiet reflectionat his private work area. His senses were alive with anticipation for tonight'sevent. Soon I will be the most famous paleontologist in the world. He hopedMichael Tolland had been generous and featured Ming's comments in thedocumentary.As Ming savored his impending fame, a faint vibration shuddered through the icebeneath his feet, causing him to jump up. His earthquake instinct from living inLos Angeles made him hypersensitive to even the faintest palpitations of theground. At the moment, though, Ming felt foolish to realize the vibration wasperfectly normal. It's just ice calving, he reminded himself, exhaling. He stillhadn't gotten used to it. Every few hours, a distant explosion rumbled throughthe night as somewhere along the glacial frontier a huge block of ice crackedoff and fell into the sea. Norah Mangor had a nice way of putting it. Newicebergs being born...On his feet now, Ming stretched his arms. He looked across the habisphere, andoff in the distance beneath the blaze of television spotlights, he could see acelebration was getting underway. Ming was not much for parties and headed inthe opposite direction across the habisphere.The labyrinth of deserted work areas now felt like a ghost town, the entire dometaking on an almost sepulchral feel. A chill seemed to have settled inside, andMing buttoned up his long, camel-hair coat.Up ahead he saw the extraction shaft – the point from which the most magnificentfossils in all of human history had been taken. The giant metal tripod had nowbeen stowed and the pool sat alone, surrounded by pylons like some kind ofshunned pothole on a vast parking lot of ice. Ming wandered over to the pit,standing a safe distance back, peering into the two-hundred-foot-deep pool offrigid water. Soon it would refreeze, erasing all traces that anyone had everbeen here.The pool of water was a beautiful sight, Ming thought. Even in the dark.Especially in the dark.Ming hesitated at the thought. Then it registered.There's something wrong.As Ming focused more closely on the water, he felt his previous contentednessgive way to a sudden whirlwind of confusion. He blinked his eyes, stared again,and then quickly turned his gaze across the dome... fifty yards away toward themass of people celebrating in the press area. He knew they could not see him wayover here in the dark.I should tell someone about this, shouldn't I?Ming looked again at the water, wondering what he would tell them. Was he seeingan optical illusion? Some kind of strange reflection?Uncertain, Ming stepped beyond the pylons and squatted down at the edge of thepit. The water level was four feet below the ice level, and he leaned down toget a better look. Yes, something was definitely strange. It was impossible tomiss, and yet it had not become visible until the lights in the dome had goneout.Ming stood up. Somebody definitely needed to hear about this. He started off ata hurried pace toward the press area. Completing only a few steps, Ming slammedon the brakes. Good God! He spun back toward the hole, his eyes going wide withrealization. It had just dawned on him.\"Impossible!\" he blurted aloud.And yet Ming knew that was the only explanation. Think, carefully, he cautioned.There must be a more reasonable rationale. But the harder Ming thought, the moreconvinced he was of what he was seeing. There is no other explanation! He couldnot believe that NASA and Corky Marlinson had somehow missed something thisincredible, but Ming wasn't complaining.This is Wailee Ming's discovery now!Trembling with excitement, Ming ran to a nearby work area and found a beaker.All he needed was a little water sample. Nobody was going to believe this!34\"As intelligence liaison to the White House,\" Rachel Sexton was saying, tryingto keep her voice from shaking as she addressed the crowd on the screen beforeher, \"my duties include traveling to political hot spots around the globe,analyzing volatile situations, and reporting to the President and White Housestaff.\"A bead of sweat formed just below her hairline and Rachel dabbed it away,silently cursing the President for dropping this briefing into her lap with zerowarning.\"Never before have my travels taken me to quite this exotic a spot.\" Rachelmotioned stiffly to the cramped trailer around her. \"Believe it or not, I amaddressing you right now from above the Arctic Circle on a sheet of ice that isover three hundred feet thick.\"Rachel sensed a bewildered anticipation in the faces on the screen before her.They obviously knew they had been packed into the Oval Office for a reason, butcertainly none of them imagined it would have anything to do with a developmentabove the Arctic Circle.The sweat was beading again. Get it together, Rachel. This is what you do. \"Isit before you tonight with great honor, pride, and... above all, excitement.\"Blank looks.Screw it, she thought, angrily wiping the sweat away. I didn't sign up for this.Rachel knew what her mother would say if she were here now: When in doubt, justspit it out! The old Yankee proverb embodied one of her mom's basic beliefs –that all challenges can be overcome by speaking the truth, no matter how itcomes out.Taking a deep breath, Rachel sat up tall and looked straight into the camera.\"Sorry, folks, if you're wondering how I could be sweating my butt off above theArctic Circle... I'm a little nervous.\"The faces before her seemed to jolt back a moment. Some uneasy laughter.\"In addition,\" Rachel said, \"your boss gave me about ten seconds' warning beforetelling me I would be facing his entire staff. This baptism by fire is notexactly what I had in mind for my first visit to the Oval Office.\"More laughter this time.\"And,\" she said, glancing down at the bottom of the screen, \"I had certainly notimagined I would be sitting at the President's desk... much less on it!\"This brought a hearty laugh and some broad smiles. Rachel felt her musclesstarting to relax. Just give it to them straight.\"Here's the situation.\" Rachel's voice now sounded like her own. Easy and clear.\"President Herney has been absent from the media spotlight this past week notbecause of his lack of interest in his campaign, but rather because he has beenengrossed in another matter. One he felt was far more important.\"Rachel paused, her eyes making contact now with her audience.\"There has been a scientific discovery made in a location called the Milne IceShelf in the high Arctic. The President will be informing the world about it ina press conference tonight at eight o'clock. The find was made by a group ofhardworking Americans who have endured a string of tough luck lately and deservea break. I'm talking about NASA. You can be proud to know that your President,with apparent clairvoyant confidence, has made a point of standing beside NASAlately through thick and thin. Now, it appears his loyalty is going to berewarded.\"It was not until that very instant that Rachel realized how historicallymomentous this was. A tightness rose in her throat, and she fought it off,plowing onward.\"As an intelligence officer who specializes in the analysis and verification ofdata, I am one of several people the President has called upon to examine theNASA data. I have examined it personally as well as conferring with severalspecialists – both government and civilian – men and women whose credentials arebeyond reproach and whose stature is beyond political influence. It is myprofessional opinion that the data I am about to present to you is factual inits origins and unbiased in its presentation. Moreover, it is my personalopinion that the President, in good faith to his office and the American people,has shown admirable care and restraint in delaying an announcement I know hewould have loved to have made last week.\"Rachel watched the crowd before her exchanging puzzled looks. They all returnedtheir gaze to her, and she knew she had their undivided attention.\"Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to hear what I'm sure you will agree is oneof the most exciting pieces of information ever revealed in this office.\"35The aerial view currently being transmitted to the Delta Force by the microbotcircling inside the habisphere looked like something that would win anavant-garde film contest – the dim lighting, the glistening extraction hole, andthe well-dressed Asian lying on the ice, his camel-hair coat splayed around himlike enormous wings. He was obviously trying to extract a water sample.\"We've got to stop him,\" said Delta-Three.Delta-One agreed. The Milne Ice Shelf held secrets his team was authorized toprotect with force.\"How do we stop him?\" Delta-Two challenged, still gripping the joystick. \"Thesemicrobots are not equipped.\"Delta-One scowled. The microbot currently hovering inside the habisphere was arecon model, stripped down for longer flight. It was about as lethal as ahousefly.\"We should call the controller,\" Delta-Three stated.Delta-One stared intently at the image of the solitary Wailee Ming, perchedprecariously on the rim of the extraction pit. Nobody was anywhere near him –and ice cold water had a way of muffling one's ability to scream. \"Give me thecontrols.\"\"What are you doing?\" the soldier on the joystick demanded.\"What we were trained to do,\" Delta-One snapped, taking over. \"Improvise.\"36Wailee Ming lay on his stomach beside the extraction hole, his right armextended over the rim trying to extract a water sample. His eyes were definitelynot playing tricks on him; his face, now only a yard or so from the water, couldsee everything perfectly.This is incredible!Straining harder, Ming maneuvered the beaker in his fingers, trying to reachdown to the surface of the water. All he needed was another few inches.Unable to extend his arm any farther, Ming repositioned himself closer to thehole. He pressed the toes of his boots against the ice and firmly replanted hisleft hand on the rim. Again, he extended his right arm as far as he could.Almost. He shifted a little closer. Yes! The edge of the beaker broke thesurface of the water. As the liquid flowed into the container, Ming stared indisbelief.Then, without warning, something utterly inexplicable occurred. Out of thedarkness, like a bullet from a gun, flew a tiny speck of metal. Ming only saw itfor a fraction of a second before it smashed into his right eye.The human instinct to protect one's eyes was so innately ingrained, that despiteMing's brain telling him that any sudden movements risked his balance, herecoiled. It was a jolting reaction more out of surprise than pain. Ming's lefthand, closest to his face, shot up reflexively to protect the assaulted eyeball.Even as his hand was in motion, Ming knew he had made a mistake. With all of hisweight leaning forward, and his only means of support suddenly gone, Wailee Mingteetered. He recovered too late. Dropping the beaker and trying to grab on tothe slick ice to stop his fall, he slipped – plummeting forward into thedarkened hole.The fall was only four feet, and yet as Ming hit the icy water head first hefelt like his face had hit pavement at fifty miles an hour. The liquid thatengulfed his face was so cold it felt like burning acid. It brought aninstantaneous spike of panic.Upside down and in the darkness, Ming was momentarily disoriented, not knowingwhich way to turn toward the surface. His heavy camel-hair coat kept the icyblast from his body – but only for a second or two. Finally righting himself,Ming came sputtering up for air, just as the water found its way to his back andchest, engulfing his body in a lung-crushing vise of cold.\"Hee... lp,\" he gasped, but Ming could barely pull in enough air to let out awhimper. He felt like the wind had been knocked out of him.\"Heee... lp!\" His cries were inaudible even to himself. Ming clambered towardthe side of the extraction pit and tried to pull himself out. The wall beforehim was vertical ice. Nothing to grab. Underwater, his boots kicked the side ofthe wall, searching for a foothold. Nothing. He strained upward, reaching forthe rim. It was only a foot out of reach.Ming's muscles were already having trouble responding. He kicked his legsharder, trying to propel himself high enough up the wall to grab the rim. Hisbody felt like lead, and his lungs seemed to have shrunk to nothing, as if theywere being crushed by a python. His water-laden coat was getting heavier by thesecond, pulling him downward. Ming tried to pull it off his body, but the heavyfabric stuck.\"Help... me!\"The fear came on in torrents now.Drowning, Ming had once read, was the most horrific death imaginable. He hadnever dreamed he would find himself on the verge of experiencing it. His musclesrefused to cooperate with his mind, and already he was fighting just to keep hishead above water. His soggy clothing pulled him downward as his numb fingersscratched the sides of the pit.His screams were only in his mind now.And then it happened.Ming went under. The sheer terror of being conscious of his own impending deathwas something he never imagined he would experience. And yet here he was...sinking slowly down the sheer ice wall of a two-hundred-foot-deep hole in theice. Multitudes of thoughts flashed before his eyes. Moments from his childhood.His career. He wondered if anyone would find him down here. Or would he simplysink to the bottom and freeze there... entombed in the glacier for all time.Ming's lungs were screaming for oxygen. He held his breath, still trying to kicktoward the surface. Breathe! He fought the reflex, clamping his insensate lipstogether. Breathe! He tried in vain to swim upward. Breathe! At that instant, ina deadly battle of human reflex against reason, Ming's breathing instinctovercame his ability to keep his mouth closed.Wailee Ming inhaled.The water crashing into his lungs felt like scalding oil on his sensitivepulmonary tissue. He felt like he was burning from the inside out. Cruelly,water does not kill immediately. Ming spent seven horrifying seconds inhaling inthe icy water, each breath more painful than the last, each inhalation offeringnone of what his body so desperately craved.Finally, as Ming slid downward into the icy darkness, he felt himself goingunconscious. He welcomed the escape. All around him in the water Ming saw tinyglowing specks of light. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.37The East Appointment Gate of the White House is located on East Executive Avenuebetween the Treasury Department and the East Lawn. The reinforced perimeterfence and cement bollards installed after the attack on the Marine barracks inBeirut give this entry an air that is anything but welcoming.Outside the gate, Gabrielle Ashe checked her watch, feeling a growingnervousness. It was 4:45 P.M., and still nobody had made contact.EAST APPOINTMENT GATE, 4:30 P.M. COME ALONE.Here I am, she thought. Where are you?Gabrielle scanned the faces of the tourists milling about, waiting for someoneto catch her eye. A few men looked her over and moved on. Gabrielle wasbeginning to wonder if this had been such a good idea. She sensed the SecretServiceman in the sentry shack had his eye on her now. Gabrielle decided herinformant had gotten cold feet. Gazing one last time through the heavy fencetoward the White House, Gabrielle sighed and turned to go.\"Gabrielle Ashe?\" the Secret Serviceman called out behind her.Gabrielle wheeled, her heart catching in her throat. Yes?The man in the guard shack waved her over. He was lean with a humorless face.\"Your party is ready to see you now.\" He unlocked the main gate and motioned forher to enter.Gabrielle's feet refused to move. \"I'm coming inside?\"The guard nodded. \"I was asked to apologize for keeping you waiting.\"Gabrielle looked at the open doorway and still could not move. What's going on!This was not at all what she had expected.\"You are Gabrielle Ashe, are you not?\" the guard demanded, looking impatientnow.\"Yes, sir, but –\"\"Then I strongly suggest you follow me.\"Gabrielle's feet jolted into motion. As she stepped tentatively over thethreshold, the gate slammed shut behind her.38Two days without sunlight had rearranged Michael Tolland's biological clock.Although his watch said it was late afternoon, Tolland's body insisted it wasthe middle of the night. Now, having put the finishing touches on hisdocumentary, Michael Tolland had downloaded the entire video file onto a digitalvideo disk and was making his way across the darkened dome. Arriving at theilluminated press area, he delivered the disk to the NASA media technician incharge of overseeing the presentation.\"Thanks, Mike,\" the technician said, winking as he held up the video disk. \"Kindof redefines 'must-see TV,' eh?\"Tolland gave a tired chuckle. \"I hope the President likes it.\"\"No doubt. Anyhow, your work is done. Sit back and enjoy the show.\"\"Thanks.\" Tolland stood in the brightly lit press area and surveyed theconvivial NASA personnel toasting the meteorite with cans of Canadian beer. Eventhough Tolland wanted to celebrate, he felt exhausted, emotionally drained. Heglanced around for Rachel Sexton, but apparently she was still talking to thePresident.He wants to put her on-air, Tolland thought. Not that he blamed him; Rachelwould be a perfect addition to the cast of meteorite spokespeople. In additionto her good looks, Rachel exuded an accessible poise and self-confidence thatTolland seldom saw in the women he met. Then again, most of the women Tollandmet were in television – either ruthless power women or gorgeous on-air\"personalities\" who lacked exactly that.Now, slipping quietly away from the crowd of bustling NASA employees, Tollandnavigated the web of pathways across the dome, wondering where the othercivilian scientists had disappeared to. If they felt half as drained as he did,they should be in the bunking area grabbing a catnap before the big moment.Ahead of him in the distance, Tolland could see the circle of SHABA pylonsaround the deserted extraction pit. The empty dome overhead seemed to echo withthe hollow voices of distant memories. Tolland tried to block them out.Forget the ghosts, he willed himself. They often haunted him at times likethese, when he was tired or alone – times of personal triumph or celebration.She should be with you right now, the voice whispered. Alone in the darkness, hefelt himself reeling backward into oblivion.Celia Birch had been his sweetheart in graduate school. One Valentine's Day,Tolland took her to her favorite restaurant. When the waiter brought Celia'sdessert, it was a single rose and a diamond ring. Celia understood immediately.With tears in her eyes, she spoke a single word that made Michael Tolland ashappy as he'd ever been.\"Yes.\"Filled with anticipation, they bought a small house near Pasadena, where Celiagot a job as a science teacher. Although the pay was modest, it was a start, andit was also close to Scripps Institute of Oceanography in San Diego, whereTolland had landed his dream job aboard a geologic research ship. Tolland's workmeant he was away for three or four days at a time, but his reunions with Celiawere always passionate and exciting.While at sea, Tolland began videotaping some of his adventures for Celia, makingminidocumentaries of his work onboard the ship. After one trip, he returned witha grainy home video that he'd shot out of the window of a deepwater submersible– the first footage ever shot of a bizarre chemotropic cuttlefish that nobodyeven knew existed. On camera, as he narrated the video, Tolland was practicallybursting out of the submarine with enthusiasm.Literally thousands of undiscovered species, he gushed, live in these depths!We've barely scratched the surface! There are mysteries down here that none ofus can imagine!Celia was enthralled with her husband's ebullience and concise scientificexplanation. On a whim, she showed the tape to her science class, and it becamean instant hit. Other teachers wanted to borrow it. Parents wanted to makecopies. It seemed everyone was eagerly awaiting Michael's next installment.Celia suddenly had an idea. She called a college friend of hers who worked forNBC and sent her a videotape.Two months later, Michael Tolland came to Celia and asked her to take a walkwith him on Kingman Beach. It was their special place, where they always went toshare their hopes and dreams.\"I have something I want to tell you,\" Tolland said.Celia stopped, taking her husband's hands as the water lapped around their feet.\"What is it?\"Tolland was bursting. \"Last week, I got a call from NBC television. They think Ishould host an oceanic documentary series. It's perfect. They want to make apilot next year! Can you believe it?\"Celia kissed him, beaming. \"I believe it. You'll be great.\"Six months later, Celia and Tolland were sailing near Catalina when Celia begancomplaining of pain in her side. They ignored it for a few weeks, but finally itgot too much. Celia went in to have it checked out.In an instant, Tolland's dream life shattered into a hellish nightmare. Celiawas ill. Very ill.\"Advanced stages of lymphoma,\" the doctors explained. \"Rare in people her age,but certainly not unheard of.\"Celia and Tolland visited countless clinics and hospitals, consulting withspecialists. The answer was always the same. Incurable.I will not accept that! Tolland immediately quit his job at Scripps Institute,forgot all about the NBC documentary, and focused all of his energy and love onhelping Celia get well. She fought hard too, bearing the pain with a grace thatonly made him love her more. He took her for long walks on Kingman Beach, madeher healthy meals, and told her stories of the things they would do when she gotbetter.But it was not to be.Only seven months had passed when Michael Tolland found himself sitting besidehis dying wife in a stark hospital ward. He no longer recognized her face. Thesavageness of the cancer was rivaled only by the brutality of the chemotherapy.She was left a ravaged skeleton. The final hours were the hardest.\"Michael,\" she said, her voice raspy. \"It's time to let go.\"\"I can't.\" Tolland's eyes welled.\"You're a survivor,\" Celia said. \"You have to be. Promise me you'll find anotherlove.\"\"I'll never want another.\" Tolland meant it.\"You'll have to learn.\"Celia died on a crystal clear Sunday morning in June. Michael Tolland felt likea ship torn from its moorings and thrown adrift in a raging sea, his compasssmashed. For weeks he spun out of control. Friends tried to help, but his pridecould not bear their pity.You have a choice to make, he finally realized. Work or die.Hardening his resolve, Tolland threw himself back into Amazing Seas. The programquite literally saved his life. In the four years that followed, Tolland's showtook off. Despite the matchmaking efforts of his friends, Tolland endured only ahandful of dates. All were fiascos or mutual disappointments, so Tolland finallygave up and blamed his busy travel schedule for his lack of social life. Hisbest friends knew better, though; Michael Tolland simply was not ready.The meteorite extraction pit loomed before Tolland now, pulling him from hispainful reverie. He shook off the chill of his memories and approached theopening. In the darkened dome, the melt water in the hole had taken on an almostsurreal and magical beauty. The surface of the pool was shimmering like amoonlit pond. Tolland's eyes were drawn to specks of light on the top layer ofthe water, as if someone had sprinkled blue-green sparkles onto the surface. Hestared a long moment at the shimmering.Something about it seemed peculiar.At first glance, he thought the gleaming water was simply reflecting the glow ofthe spotlights from across the dome. Now he saw this was not the case at all.The shimmers possessed a greenish tint and seemed to pulse in a rhythm, as ifthe surface of the water were alive, illuminating itself from within.Unsettled, Tolland stepped beyond the pylons for a closer look.Across the habisphere, Rachel Sexton exited the PSC trailer into darkness. Shepaused a moment, disoriented by the shadowy vault around her. The habisphere wasnow a gaping cavern, lit only by incidental effulgence radiating out from thestark media lights against the north wall. Unnerved by the darkness around her,she headed instinctively for the illuminated press area.Rachel felt pleased with the outcome of her briefing of the White House staff.Once she'd recovered from the President's little stunt, she'd smoothly conveyedeverything she knew about the meteorite. As she spoke, she watched theexpressions on the faces of the President's staff go from incredulous shock, tohopeful belief, and finally to awestruck acceptance.\"Extraterrestrial life?\" she had heard one of them exclaim. \"Do you know whatthat means?\"\"Yes,\" another replied. \"It means we're going to win this election.\"As Rachel approached the dramatic press area, she imagined the impendingannouncement and couldn't help but wonder if her father really deserved thepresidential steamroller that was about to blindside him, crushing his campaignin a single blow.The answer, of course, was yes.Whenever Rachel Sexton felt any soft spot for her father, all she had to do wasremember her mother. Katherine Sexton. The pain and shame Sedgewick Sexton hadbrought on her was reprehensible... coming home late every night, looking smugand smelling of perfume. The feigned religious zeal her father hid behind – allthe while lying and cheating, knowing Katherine would never leave him.Yes, she decided, Senator Sexton was about to get exactly what he deserved.The crowd in the press area was jovial. Everyone held beers. Rachel movedthrough the crowd feeling like a coed at a frat party. She wondered whereMichael Tolland had gone.Corky Marlinson materialized beside her. \"Looking for Mike?\"Rachel startled. \"Well... no... sort of.\"Corky shook his head in disgust. \"I knew it. Mike just left. I think he washeaded back to go grab a few winks.\" Corky squinted across the dusky dome.\"Although it looks like you can still catch him.\" He gave her a puggish smileand pointed. \"Mike becomes mesmerized every time he sees water.\"Rachel followed Corky's outstretched finger toward the center of the dome, wherethe silhouette of Michael Tolland stood, gazing down into the water in theextraction pit.\"What's he doing?\" she asked. \"That's kind of dangerous over there.\"Corky grinned. \"Probably taking a leak. Let's go push him.\"Rachel and Corky crossed the darkened dome toward the extraction pit. As theydrew close to Michael Tolland, Corky called out.\"Hey, aqua man! Forget your swimsuit?\"Tolland turned. Even in the dimness, Rachel could see his expression wasuncharacteristically grave. His face looked oddly illuminated, as if he werebeing lit from below.\"Everything okay, Mike?\" she asked.\"Not exactly.\" Tolland pointed into the water.Corky stepped over the pylons and joined Tolland at the edge of the shaft.Corky's mood seemed to cool instantly when he looked in the water. Rachel joinedthem, stepping past the pylons to the edge of the pit. When she peered into thehole, she was surprised to see specks of blue-green light shimmering on thesurface. Like neon dust particles floating in the water. They seemed to bepulsating green. The effect was beautiful.Tolland picked up a shard of ice off the glacial floor and tossed it into thewater. The water phosphoresced at the point of impact, glowing with a suddengreen splash.\"Mike,\" Corky said, looking uneasy, \"please tell me you know what that is.\"Tolland frowned. \"I know exactly what this is. My question is, what the hell isit doing here?\"39\"We've got flagellates,\" Tolland said, staring into the luminescent water.\"Flatulence?\" Corky scowled. \"Speak for yourself.\"Rachel sensed Michael Tolland was in no joking mood.\"I don't know how it could have happened,\" Tolland said, \"but somehow this watercontains bioluminescent dinoflagellates.\"\"Bioluminescent what?\" Rachel said. Speak English.\"Monocelled plankton capable of oxidizing a luminescent catalyst calledluceferin.\"That was English?Tolland exhaled and turned to his friend. \"Corky, there any chance the meteoritewe pulled out of that hole had living organisms on it?\"Corky burst out laughing. \"Mike, be serious!\"\"I am serious.\"\"No chance, Mike! Believe me, if NASA had any inkling whatsoever that there wereextraterrestrial organisms living on that rock, you can be damn sure they neverwould have extracted it into the open air.\"Tolland looked only partially comforted, his relief apparently clouded by adeeper mystery. \"I can't be for sure without a microscope,\" Tolland said, \"butit looks to me like this is a bioluminescent plankton from the phylumPyrrophyta. Its name means fire plant. The Arctic Ocean is filled with it.\"Corky shrugged. \"So why'd you ask if they were from space?\"\"Because,\" Tolland said, \"the meteorite was buried in glacial ice – fresh waterfrom snowfalls. The water in that hole is glacial melt and has been frozen forthree centuries. How could ocean creatures get in there?\"Tolland's point brought a long silence.Rachel stood at the edge of the pool and tried to get her mind around what shewas looking at. Bioluminescent plankton in the extraction shaft. What does itmean?\"There's got to be a crack somewhere down there,\" Tolland said. \"It's the onlyexplanation. The plankton must have entered the shaft through a fissure in theice that allowed ocean water to seep in.\"Rachel didn't understand. \"Seep in? From where?\" She recalled her long IceRoverride in from the ocean. \"The coast is a good two miles from here.\"Both Corky and Tolland gave Rachel an odd look. \"Actually,\" Corky said, \"theocean is directly underneath us. This slab of ice is floating.\"Rachel stared at the two men, feeling utterly perplexed. \"Floating? But... we'reon a glacier.\"\"Yes, we're on a glacier,\" Tolland said, \"but we're not over land. Glacierssometimes flow off a landmass and fan out over water. Because ice is lighterthan water, the glacier simply continues to flow, floating out over the oceanlike an enormous ice raft. That's the definition of an ice shelf... the floatingsection of a glacier.\" He paused. \"We're actually almost a mile out to sea atthe moment.\"Shocked, Rachel instantly became wary. As she adjusted her mental picture of hersurroundings, the thought of standing over the Arctic Ocean brought with it asense of fear.Tolland seemed to sense her uneasiness. He stamped his foot reassuringly on theice. \"Don't worry. This ice is three hundred feet thick, with two hundred ofthose feet floating below the water like an ice cube in a glass. Makes the shelfvery stable. You could build a skyscraper on this thing.\"Rachel gave a wan nod, not entirely convinced. The misgivings aside, she nowunderstood Tolland's theory about the origins of the plankton. He thinks there'sa crack that goes all the way down to the ocean, allowing plankton to come upthrough it into the hole. It was feasible, Rachel decided, and yet it involved aparadox that bothered her. Norah Mangor had been very clear about the integrityof the glacier, having drilled dozens of test cores to confirm its solidity.Rachel looked at Tolland. \"I thought the glacier's perfection was thecornerstone of all the strata-dating records. Didn't Dr. Mangor say the glacierhad no cracks or fissures?\"Corky frowned. \"Looks like the ice queen muffed it.\"Don't say that too loudly, Rachel thought, or you'll get an ice pick in theback.Tolland stroked his chin as he watched the phosphorescing creatures. \"There'sliterally no other explanation. There must be a crack. The weight of the iceshelf on top of the ocean must be pushing plankton-rich sea-water up into thehole.\"One hell of a crack, Rachel thought. If the ice here was three hundred feetthick and the hole was two hundred feet deep, then this hypothetical crack hadto pass through a hundred feet of solid ice. Norah Mangor's test cores showed nocracks.\"Do me a favor,\" Tolland said to Corky. \"Go find Norah. Let's hope to God sheknows something about this glacier that she's not telling us. And find Ming,too, maybe he can tell us what these little glow-beasties are.\"Corky headed off.\"Better hurry,\" Tolland called after him, glancing back into the hole. \"I couldswear this bioluminescence is fading.\"Rachel looked at the hole. Sure enough, the green was not so brilliant now.Tolland removed his parka and lay down on the ice next to the hole.Rachel watched, confused. \"Mike?\"\"I want to find out if there's any saltwater flowing in.\"\"By lying on the ice without a coat?\"\"Yup.\" Tolland crawled on his belly to the edge of the hole. Holding one sleeveof the coat over the edge, he let the other sleeve dangle down the shaft untilthe cuff skimmed the water. \"This is a highly accurate salinity test used byworld-class oceanographers. It's called 'licking a wet jacket.'\"Out on the ice shelf, Delta-One struggled with the controls, trying to keep thedamaged microbot in flight over the group now assembled around the excavationpit. From the sounds of the conversation beneath, he knew things were unravelingfast.\"Call the controller,\" he said. \"We've got a serious problem.\"40Gabrielle Ashe had taken the White House public tour many times in her youth,secretly dreaming of someday working inside the presidential mansion andbecoming part of the elite team that charted the country's future. At themoment, however, she would have preferred to be anywhere else in the world.As the Secret Serviceman from the East Gate led Gabrielle into an ornate foyer,she wondered what in the world her anonymous informant was trying to prove.Inviting Gabrielle into the White House was insane. What if I'm seen? Gabriellehad become quite visible lately in the media as Senator Sexton's right-handaide. Certainly someone would recognize her.\"Ms. Ashe?\"Gabrielle looked up. A kind-faced sentry in the foyer gave her a welcomingsmile. \"Look over there, please.\" He pointed.Gabrielle looked where he was pointing and was blinded by a flashbulb.\"Thank you, ma'am.\" The sentry led her to a desk and handed her a pen. \"Pleasesign the entry log.\" He pushed a heavy leather binder in front of her.Gabrielle looked at the log. The page before her was blank. She recalled hearingonce that all White House visitors sign on their own blank page to preserve theprivacy of their visit. She signed her name.So much for a secret meeting.Gabrielle walked through a metal detector, and was then given a cursory patdown.The sentry smiled. \"Enjoy your visit, Ms. Ashe.\"Gabrielle followed the Secret Serviceman fifty feet down a tiled hallway to asecond security desk. Here, another sentry was assembling a guest pass that wasjust rolling out of a lamination machine. He punched a hole in it, affixed aneck cord, and slipped it over Gabrielle's head. The plastic was still warm. Thephoto on the ID was the snapshot they had taken fifteen seconds earlier down thehall.Gabrielle was impressed. Who says government is inefficient?They continued, the Secret Serviceman leading her deeper into the White Housecomplex. Gabrielle was feeling more uneasy with every step. Whoever had extendedthe mysterious invitation certainly was not concerned about keeping the meetingprivate. Gabrielle had been issued an official pass, signed the guest log, andwas now being marched in plain view through the first floor of the White Housewhere public tours were gathered.\"And this is the China Room,\" a tour guide was saying to a group of tourists,\"home of Nancy Reagan's $952 per setting red-rimmed china that sparked a debateover conspicuous consumption back in 1981.\"The Secret Serviceman led Gabrielle past the tour toward a huge marblestaircase, where another tour was ascending. \"You are about to enter thethirty-two-hundred-square-foot East Room,\" the guide was narrating, \"whereAbigail Adams once hung John Adams's laundry. Then we will pass to the Red Room,where Dolley Madison liquored up visiting heads of state before James Madisonnegotiated with them.\"The tourists laughed.Gabrielle followed past the stairway through a series of ropes and barricadesinto a more private section of the building. Here they entered a room Gabriellehad only seen in books and on television. Her breath grew short.My God, this is the Map Room!No tour ever came in here. The room's paneled walls could swing outward toreveal layer upon layer of world maps. This was the place where Roosevelt hadcharted the course of World War II. Unsettlingly, it was also the room fromwhich Clinton had admitted his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Gabrielle pushedthat particular thought from her mind. Most important, the Map Room was apassageway into the West Wing – the area inside the White House where the truepowerbrokers worked. This was the last place Gabrielle Ashe had expected to begoing. She had imagined her e-mail was coming from some enterprising youngintern or secretary working in one of the complex's more mundane offices.Apparently not.I'm going into the West Wing...The Secret Serviceman marched her to the very end of a carpeted hallway andstopped at an unmarked door. He knocked. Gabrielle's heart was pounding.\"It's open,\" someone called from inside.The man opened the door and motioned for Gabrielle to enter.Gabrielle stepped in. The shades were down, and the room was dim. She could seethe faint outline of a person sitting at a desk in the darkness.\"Ms. Ashe?\" The voice came from behind a cloud of cigarette smoke. \"Welcome.\"As Gabrielle's eyes accustomed to the dark, she began to make out anunsettlingly familiar face, and her muscles went taut with surprise. THIS is whohas been sending me e-mail?\"Thank you for coming,\" Marjorie Tench said, her voice cold.\"Ms. ... Tench?\" Gabrielle stammered, suddenly unable to breathe.\"Call me Marjorie.\" The hideous woman stood up, blowing smoke out of her noselike a dragon. \"You and I are about to become best friends.\"41Norah Mangor stood at the extraction shaft beside Tolland, Rachel, and Corky andstared into the pitch-black meteorite hole. \"Mike,\" she said, \"you're cute, butyou're insane. There's no bioluminescence here.\"Tolland now wished he'd thought to take some video; while Corky had gone to findNorah and Ming, the bioluminescence had begun fading rapidly. Within a couple ofminutes, all the twinkling had simply stopped.Tolland threw another piece of ice into the water, but nothing happened. Nogreen splash.\"Where did they go?\" Corky asked.Tolland had a fairly good idea. Bioluminescence – one of nature's most ingeniousdefense mechanisms – was a natural response for plankton in distress. A planktonsensing it was about to be consumed by larger organisms would begin flashing inhopes of attracting much larger predators that would scare off the originalattackers. In this case, the plankton, having entered the shaft through a crack,suddenly found themselves in a primarily freshwater environment andbioluminesced in panic as the freshwater slowly killed them. \"I think theydied.\"\"They were murdered,\" Norah scoffed. \"The Easter Bunny swam in and ate them.\"Corky glared at her. \"I saw the luminescence too, Norah.\"\"Was it before or after you took LSD?\"\"Why would we lie about this?\" Corky demanded.\"Men lie.\"\"Yeah, about sleeping with other women, but never about bioluminescentplankton.\"Tolland sighed. \"Norah, certainly you're aware that plankton do live in theoceans beneath the ice.\"\"Mike,\" she replied with a glare, \"please don't tell me my business. For therecord, there are over two hundred species of diatoms that thrive under Arcticice shelves. Fourteen species of autotrophic nannoflagellates, twentyheterotrophic flagellates, forty heterotrophic dinoflagellates, and severalmetazoans, including polychaetes, amphipods, copepods, euphausids, and fish. Anyquestions?\"Tolland frowned. \"Clearly you know more about Arctic fauna than I do, and youagree there's plenty of life underneath us. So why are you so skeptical that wesaw bioluminescent plankton?\"\"Because, Mike, this shaft is sealed. It's a closed, freshwater environment. Noocean plankton could possibly get in here!\"\"I tasted salt in the water,\" Tolland insisted. \"Very faint, but present.Saltwater is getting in here somehow.\"\"Right,\" Norah said skeptically. \"You tasted salt. You licked the sleeve of anold sweaty parka, and now you've decided that the PODS density scans and fifteenseparate core samples are inaccurate.\"Tolland held out the wet sleeve of his parka as proof.\"Mike, I'm not licking your damn jacket.\" She looked into the hole. \"Might I askwhy droves of alleged plankton decided to swim into this alleged crack?\"\"Heat?\" Tolland ventured. \"A lot of sea creatures are attracted by heat. When weextracted the meteorite, we heated it. The plankton may have been drawninstinctively toward the temporarily warmer environment in the shaft.\"Corky nodded. \"Sounds logical.\"\"Logical?\" Norah rolled her eyes. \"You know, for a prize-winning physicist and aworld-famous oceanographer, you're a couple of pretty dense specimens. Has itoccurred to you that even if there is a crack – which I can assure you there isnot – it is physically impossible for any sea-water to be flowing into thisshaft.\" She stared at both of them with pathetic disdain.\"But, Norah...,\" Corky began.\"Gentlemen! We're standing above sea level here.\" She stamped her foot on theice. \"Hello? This ice sheet rises a hundred feet above the sea. You might recallthe big cliff at the end of this shelf? We're higher than the ocean. If therewere a fissure into this shaft, the water would be flowing out of this shaft,not into it. It's called gravity.\"Tolland and Corky looked at each other.\"Shit,\" Corky said. \"I didn't think of that.\"Norah pointed into the water-filled shaft. \"You may also have noticed that thewater level isn't changing?\"Tolland felt like an idiot. Norah was absolutely right. If there had been acrack, the water would be flowing out, not in. Tolland stood in silence a longmoment, wondering what to do next.\"Okay.\" Tolland sighed. \"Apparently, the fissure theory makes no sense. But wesaw bioluminescence in the water. The only conclusion is that this is not aclosed environment after all. I realize much of your icedating data is built onthe premise that the glacier is a solid block, but –\"\"Premise?\" Norah was obviously getting agitated. \"Remember, this was not just mydata, Mike. NASA made the same findings. We all confirmed this glacier is solid.No cracks.\"Tolland glanced across the dome toward the crowd gathered around the pressconference area. \"Whatever is going on, I think, in good faith, we need toinform the administrator and –\"\"This is bullshit!\" Norah hissed. \"I'm telling you this glacial matrix ispristine. I'm not about to have my core data questioned by a salt lick and someabsurd hallucinations.\" She stormed over to a nearby supply area and begancollecting some tools. \"I'll take a proper water sample, and show you this watercontains no saltwater plankton – living or dead!\"Rachel and the others looked on as Norah used a sterile pipette on a string toharvest a water sample from the melt pool. Norah placed several drops in a tinydevice that resembled a miniature telescope. Then she peered through the oculus,pointing the device toward the light emanating from the other side of the dome.Within seconds she was cursing.\"Jesus Christ!\" Norah shook the device and looked again. \"Damn it! Something'sgot to be wrong with this refractometer!\"\"Saltwater?\" Corky gloated.Norah frowned. \"Partial. It's registering three percent brine – which is totallyimpossible. This glacier is a snow pack. Pure freshwater. There should be nosalt.\" Norah carried the sample to a nearby microscope and examined it. Shegroaned.\"Plankton?\" Tolland asked.\"G. polyhedra,\" she replied, her voice now sedate. \"It's one of the planktons weglaciologists commonly see in the oceans under ice shelves.\" She glanced over atTolland. \"They're dead now. Obviously they didn't survive long in a threepercent saltwater environment.\"The four of them stood in silence a moment beside the deep shaft.Rachel wondered what the ramifications of this paradox were for the overalldiscovery. The dilemma appeared minor when compared to the overall scope of themeteorite, and yet, as an intel analyst, Rachel had witnessed the collapse ofentire theories based on smaller snags than this.\"What's going on over here?\" The voice was a low rumble.Everyone looked up. The bearish frame of the NASA administrator emerged from thedark.\"Minor quandary with the water in the shaft,\" Tolland said. \"We're trying tosort it out.\"Corky sounded almost gleeful. \"Norah's ice data is screwed.\"\"Bite me twice,\" Norah whispered.The administrator approached, his furry eyebrows lowering. \"What's wrong withthe ice data.\"Tolland heaved an uncertain sigh. \"We're showing a three percent saltwater mixin the meteorite shaft, which contradicts the glaciology report that themeteorite was encased in a pristine freshwater glacier.\" He paused. \"There'salso plankton present.\"Ekstrom looked almost angry. \"Obviously that's impossible. There are no fissuresin this glacier. The PODS scans confirmed that. This meteorite was sealed in asolid matrix of ice.\"Rachel knew Ekstrom was correct. According to NASA's density scans, the icesheet was rock solid. Hundreds of feet of frozen glacier on all sides of themeteorite. No cracks. And yet as Rachel imagined how density scans were taken, astrange thought occurred to her...\"In addition,\" Ekstrom was saying, \"Dr. Mangor's core samples confirmed thesolidity of the glacier.\"\"Exactly!\" Norah said, tossing the refractometer on a desk. \"Doublecorroboration. No fault lines in the ice. Which leaves us no explanationwhatsoever for the salt and plankton.\"\"Actually,\" Rachel said, the boldness of her voice surprising even herself.\"There is another possibility.\" The brainstorm had hit her from the mostunlikely of memories.Everyone was looking at her now, their skepticism obvious.Rachel smiled. \"There's a perfectly sound rationale for the presence of salt andplankton.\" She gave Tolland a wry look. \"And frankly, Mike, I'm surprised itdidn't occur to you.\"42\"Plankton frozen in the glacier?\" Corky Marlinson sounded not at all sold onRachel's explanation. \"Not to rain on your parade, but usually when thingsfreeze they die. These little buggers were flashing us, remember?\"\"Actually,\" Tolland said, giving Rachel an impressed look, \"she may have apoint. There are a number of species that enter suspended animation when theirenvironment requires it. I did an episode on that phenomenon once.\"Rachel nodded. \"You showed northern pike that got frozen in lakes and had towait until the thaw to swim away. You also talked about micro-organisms called'waterbears' that became totally dehydrated in the desert, remained that way fordecades, and then reinflated when rains returned.\"Tolland chuckled. \"So you really do watch my show?\"Rachel gave a slightly embarrassed shrug.\"What's your point, Ms. Sexton?\" Norah demanded.\"Her point,\" Tolland said, \"which should have dawned on me earlier, is that oneof the species I mentioned on that program was a kind of plankton that getsfrozen in the polar ice cap every winter, hibernates inside the ice, and thenswims away every summer when the ice cap thins.\" Tolland paused. \"Granted thespecies I featured on the show was not the bioluminescent species we saw here,but maybe the same thing happened.\"\"Frozen plankton,\" Rachel continued, excited to have Michael Tolland soenthusiastic about her idea, \"could explain everything we're seeing here. Atsome point in the past, fissures could have opened in this glacier, filled withplankton-rich saltwater, and then refroze. What if there were frozen pockets ofsaltwater in this glacier? Frozen saltwater containing frozen plankton? Imagineif while you were raising the heated meteorite through the ice, it passedthrough a frozen saltwater pocket. The saltwater ice would have melted,releasing the plankton from hibernation, and giving us a small percentage ofsalt mixed in the freshwater.\"\"Oh, for the love of God!\" Norah exclaimed with a hostile groan. \"Suddenlyeveryone's a glaciologist!\"Corky also looked skeptical. \"But wouldn't PODS have spotted any brine icepockets when it did its density scans? After all, brine ice and freshwater icehave different densities.\"\"Barely different,\" Rachel said.\"Four percent is a substantial difference,\" Norah challenged.\"Yes, in a lab,\" Rachel replied. \"But PODS takes its measurements from 120 milesup in space. Its computers were designed to differentiate between the obvious –ice and slush, granite and limestone.\" She turned to the administrator. \"Am Iright to assume that when PODS measures densities from space, it probably lacksthe resolution to distinguish brine ice from fresh ice?\"The administrator nodded. \"Correct. A four percent differential is below PODS'stolerance threshold. The satellite would see brine ice and fresh ice asidentical.\"Tolland now looked intrigued. \"This would also explain the static water level inthe shaft.\" He looked at Norah. \"You said the plankton species you saw in theextraction shaft was called –\"\"G. polyhedra, Norah declared. \"And now you're wondering if G. polyhedra iscapable of hibernating inside the ice? You'll be pleased to know the answer isyes. Absolutely. G. polyhedra is found in droves around ice shelves, itbioluminesces, and it can hibernate inside the ice. Any other questions?\"Everyone exchanged looks. From Norah's tone, there was obviously some sort of\"but\" – and yet it seemed she had just confirmed Rachel's theory.\"So,\" Tolland ventured, \"you're saying it's possible, right? This theory makessense?\"\"Sure,\" Norah said, \"if you're totally retarded.\"Rachel glared. \"I beg your pardon?\"Norah Mangor locked stares with Rachel. \"I imagine in your business, a littlebit of knowledge is a dangerous thing? Well, trust me when I tell you that thesame holds true for glaciology.\" Norah's eyes shifted now, looking at each ofthe four people around her. \"Let me clarify this for everyone once and for all.The frozen brine pockets that Ms. Sexton has proposed do occur. They are whatglaciologists call interstices. Interstices, however, form not as pockets ofsaltwater but rather as highly branched networks of brine ice whose tendrils areas wide as a human hair. That meteorite would have had to pass through one hellof a dense series of interstices to release enough saltwater to create a threepercent mixture in a pool that deep.\"Ekstrom scowled. \"So is it possible or not?\"\"Not on your life,\" Norah said flatly. \"Totally impossible. I would have hitpockets of brine ice in my core samples.\"\"Core samples are drilled essentially in random spots, right?\" Rachel asked. \"Isthere any chance the cores' placements, simply by bad luck, could have missed apocket of sea ice?\"\"I drilled directly down over the meteorite. Then I drilled multiple cores onlya few yards on either side. You can't get any closer.\"\"Just asking.\"\"The point is moot,\" Norah said. \"Brine interstices occur only in seasonal ice –ice that forms and melts every season. The Milne Ice Shelf is fast ice – icethat forms in the mountains and holds fast until it migrates to the calving zoneand falls into the sea. As convenient as frozen plankton would be for explainingthis mysterious little phenomenon, I can guarantee there are no hidden networksof frozen plankton in this glacier.\"The group fell silent again.Despite the stark rebuttal of the frozen plankton theory, Rachel's systematicanalysis of the data refused to accept the rejection. Instinctively, Rachel knewthat the presence of frozen plankton in the glacier beneath them was thesimplest solution to the riddle. The Law of Parsimony, she thought. Her NROinstructors had driven it into her subconscious. When multiple explanationsexist, the simplest is usually correct.Norah Mangor obviously had a lot to lose if her ice-core data was wrong, andRachel wondered if maybe Norah had seen the plankton, realized she'd made amistake in claiming the glacier was solid, and was now simply trying to coverher tracks.\"All I know,\" Rachel said, \"is that I just briefed the entire White House staffand told them this meteorite was discovered in a pristine matrix of ice and hadbeen sealed there, untouched by outside influence since 1716, when it broke offof a famous meteorite called the Jungersol. This fact now appears to be in somequestion.\"The NASA administrator was silent, his expression grave.Tolland cleared his throat. \"I have to agree with Rachel. There was saltwaterand plankton in the pool. No matter what the explanation is, that shaft isobviously not a closed environment. We can't say it is.\"Corky was looking uncomfortable. \"Um, folks, not to sound like theastrophysicist here, but in my field when we make mistakes, we're usually off bybillions of years. Is this little plankton/saltwater mix-up really all thatimportant? I mean, the perfection of the ice surrounding the meteorite in no wayaffects the meteorite itself, right? We still have the fossils. Nobody isquestioning their authenticity. If it turns out we've made a mistake with theice-core data, nobody will really care. All they'll care about is that we foundproof of life on another planet.\"\"I'm sorry, Dr. Marlinson,\" Rachel said, \"as someone who analyzes data for aliving, I have to disagree. Any tiny flaw in the data NASA presents tonight hasthe potential to cast doubt over the credibility of the entire discovery.Including the authenticity of the fossils.\"Corky's jaw fell open. \"What are you talking about? Those fossils areirrefutable!\"\"I know that. You know that. But if the public catches wind that NASA knowinglypresented ice-core data that was in question, trust me, they will immediatelystart wondering what else NASA lied about.\"Norah stepped forward, eyes flashing. \"My ice-core data is not in question.\" Sheturned to the administrator. \"I can prove to you, categorically, that there isno brine ice trapped anywhere in this ice shelf!\"The administrator eyed her a long moment. \"How?\"Norah outlined her plan. When she was done, Rachel had to admit, the ideasounded like a reasonable one.The administrator did not look so sure. \"And the results will be definitive?\"\"One hundred percent confirmation,\" Norah assured him. \"If there's one goddamnounce of frozen saltwater anywhere near that meteorite shaft, you will see it.Even a few droplets will light up on my gear like Times Square.\"The administrator's brow furrowed beneath his military buzz cut. \"There's notmuch time. The press conference is in a couple of hours.\"\"I can be back in twenty minutes.\"\"How far out on the glacier did you say you have to go?\"\"Not far. Two hundred yards should do it.\"Ekstrom nodded. \"Are you certain it's safe?\"\"I'll take flares,\" Norah replied. \"And Mike will go with me.\"Tolland's head shot up. \"I will?\"\"You sure as hell will, Mike! We'll be tethered. I'd appreciate a strong set ofarms out there if the wind whips up.\"\"But –\"\"She's right,\" the administrator said, turning to Tolland. \"If she goes, shecan't go alone. I'd send some of my men with her, but frankly, I'd rather keepthis plankton issue to ourselves until we figure out if it's a problem or not.\"Tolland gave a reluctant nod.\"I'd like to go too,\" Rachel said.Norah spun like a cobra. \"The hell you will.\"\"Actually,\" the administrator said, as if an idea had just occurred to him, \"Ithink I'd feel safer if we used the standard quad tether configuration. If yougo dual, and Mike slips, you'll never hold him. Four people are a lot safer thantwo.\" He paused glancing at Corky. \"That would mean either you or Dr. Ming.\"Ekstrom glanced around the habisphere. \"Where is Dr. Ming, anyway?\"\"I haven't seen him in a while,\" Tolland said. \"He might be catching a nap.\"Ekstrom turned to Corky. \"Dr. Marlinson, I cannot require that you go out withthem, and yet –\"\"What the hell?\" Corky said. \"Seeing as everyone is getting along so well.\"\"No!\" Norah exclaimed. \"Four people will slow us down. Mike and I are goingalone.\"\"You are not going alone.\" The administrator's tone was final. \"There's a reasontethers are built as quads, and we're going to do this as safely as possible.The last thing I need is an accident a couple hours before the biggest pressconference in NASA's history.\"43Gabrielle Ashe felt a precarious uncertainty as she sat in the heavy air ofMarjorie Tench's office. What could this woman possibly want with me? Behind theroom's sole desk, Tench leaned back in her chair, her hard features seeming toradiate pleasure with Gabrielle's discomfort.\"Does the smoke bother you?\" Tench asked, tapping a fresh cigarette from herpack.\"No,\" Gabrielle lied.Tench was already lighting up anyway. \"You and your candidate have taken quitean interest in NASA during this campaign.\"\"True,\" Gabrielle snapped, making no effort to hide her anger, \"thanks to somecreative encouragement. I'd like an explanation.\"Tench gave an innocent pout. \"You want to know why I've been sending you e-mailfodder for your attack on NASA?\"\"The information you sent me hurt your President.\"\"In the short run, yes.\"The ominous tone in Tench's voice made Gabrielle uneasy. \"What's that supposedto mean?\"\"Relax, Gabrielle. My e-mails didn't change things much. Senator Sexton wasNASA-bashing long before I stepped in. I simply helped him clarify his message.Solidify his position.\"\"Solidify his position?\"\"Exactly.\" Tench smiled, revealing stained teeth. \"Which, I must say, he didquite effectively this afternoon on CNN.\"Gabrielle recalled the senator's reaction to Tench's fence-buster question. Yes,I would act to abolish NASA. Sexton had gotten himself cornered, but he'd playedout of the rough with a strong drive. It was the right move. Wasn't it? FromTench's contented look, Gabrielle sensed there was information missing.Tench stood suddenly, her lanky frame dominating the cramped space. With thecigarette dangling from her lips, she walked over to a wall safe, removed athick manila envelope, returned to the desk, and sat back down.Gabrielle eyed the burgeoning envelope.Tench smiled, cradling the envelope in her lap like a poker player holding aroyal flush. Her yellowed fingertips flicked at the corner, making an annoyingrepetitive scratch, as if savoring the anticipation.Gabrielle knew it was just her own guilty conscience, but her first fears werethat the envelope contained some kind of proof of her sexual indiscretion withthe senator. Ridiculous, she thought. The encounter had occurred after hours inSexton's locked senatorial office. Not to mention, if the White House actuallyhad any evidence, they would have gone public with it already.They may be suspicious, Gabrielle thought, but they don't have proof.Tench crushed out her cigarette. \"Ms. Ashe, whether or not you are aware, youare caught in the middle of a battle that has been raging behind the scenes inWashington since 1996.\"This opening gambit was not at all what Gabrielle expected. \"I beg your pardon?\"Tench lit another cigarette. Her spindly lips curled around it, and the tipglowed red. \"What do you know about a bill called the Space CommercializationPromotions Act?\"Gabrielle had never heard of it. She shrugged, lost.\"Really?\" Tench said. \"That surprises me. Considering your candidate's platform.The Space Commercialization Promotions Act was proposed back in 1996 by SenatorWalker. The bill, in essence, cites the failure of NASA to do anythingworthwhile since putting a man on the moon. It calls for the privatization ofNASA by immediately selling off NASA assets to private aerospace companies andallowing the free-market system to explore space more efficiently, thusrelieving the burden NASA now places on taxpayers.\"Gabrielle had heard NASA critics suggest privatization as a solution to NASA'swoes, but she was not aware the idea had actually taken the form of an officialbill.\"This commercialization bill,\" Tench said, \"has been presented to Congress fourtimes now. It is similar to bills that have successfully privatized governmentindustries like uranium production. Congress has passed the spacecommercialization bill all four times it has seen it. Thankfully, the WhiteHouse vetoed it on all occasions. Zachary Herney has had to veto it twice.\"\"Your point?\"\"My point is that this bill is one Senator Sexton will certainly support if hebecomes President. I have reason to believe Sexton will have no qualms aboutselling off NASA assets to commercial bidders the first chance he gets. Inshort, your candidate would support privatization over having American taxdollars fund space exploration.\"\"To my knowledge, the senator has never commented publicly about his stance onany Space Commercialization Promotions Act.\"\"True. And yet knowing his politics, I assume you would not be surprised if hesupported it.\"\"Free-market systems tend to breed efficiency.\"\"I'll take that as a 'yes.'\" Tench stared. \"Sadly, privatizing NASA is anabominable idea, and there are countless reasons why every White Houseadministration since the bill's inception has shot it down.\"\"I've heard the arguments against privatizing space,\" Gabrielle said, \"and Iunderstand your concerns.\"\"Do you?\" Tench leaned toward her. \"Which arguments have you heard?\"Gabrielle shifted uneasily. \"Well, the standard academic fears mostly – the mostcommon being that if we privatize NASA, our current pursuit of scientific spaceknowledge would be quickly abandoned in favor of profitable ventures.\"\"True. Space science would die in a heartbeat. Instead of spending money tostudy our universe, private space companies would strip-mine asteroids, buildtourist hotels in space, offer commercial satellite launch services. Why wouldprivate companies bother studying the origins of our universe when it would costthem billions and show no financial return?\"\"They wouldn't,\" Gabrielle countered. \"But certainly a National Endowment forSpace Science could be founded to fund academic missions.\"\"We already have that system in place. It's called NASA.\"Gabrielle fell silent.\"The abandonment of science in favor of profits is a side issue,\" Tench said.\"Hardly relevant compared to the utter chaos that would result by permitting theprivate sector to run free in space. We would have the wild west all over again.We would see pioneers staking claims on the moon and on asteroids and protectingthose claims with force. I've heard petitions from companies who want to buildneon billboards that blink advertisements in the nighttime sky. I've seenpetitions from space hotels and tourist attractions whose proposed operationsinclude ejecting their trash into the void of space and creating orbiting trashheaps. In fact, I just read a proposal yesterday from a company that wants toturn space into a mausoleum by launching the deceased into orbit. Can youimagine our telecommunications satellites colliding with dead bodies? Last week,I had a billionaire CEO in my office who was petitioning to launch a mission toa near-field asteroid, drag it closer to earth, and mine it for preciousminerals. I actually had to remind this guy that dragging asteroids into nearearth orbit posed potential risks of global catastrophe! Ms. Ashe, I can assureyou, if this bill passes, the throngs of entrepreneurs rushing into space willnot be rocket scientists. They will be entrepreneurs with deep pockets andshallow minds.\"\"Persuasive arguments,\" Gabrielle said, \"and I'm sure the senator would weighthose issues carefully if he ever found himself in a position to vote on thebill. Might I ask what any of this has to do with me?\"Tench's gaze narrowed over her cigarette. \"A lot of people stand to make a lotof money in space, and the political lobby is mounting to remove allrestrictions and open the floodgates. The veto power of the office of thePresident is the only remaining barrier against privatization... againstcomplete anarchy in space.\"\"Then I commend Zach Herney for vetoing the bill.\"\"My fear is that your candidate would not be so prudent if elected.\"\"Again, I assume the senator would carefully weigh all the issues if he wereever in a position to pass judgment on the bill.\"Tench did not look entirely convinced. \"Do you know how much Senator Sextonspends on media advertising?\"The question came out of left field. \"Those figures are public domain.\"\"More than three million a month.\"Gabrielle shrugged. \"If you say so.\" The figure was close.\"That's a lot of money to spend.\"\"He's got a lot of money to spend.\"\"Yes, he planned well. Or rather, married well.\" Tench paused to blow smoke.\"It's sad about his wife, Katherine. Her death hit him hard.\" A tragic sighfollowed, clearly feigned. \"Her death was not all that long ago, was it?\"\"Come to your point, or I'm leaving.\"Tench let out a lung-shaking cough and reached for the burgeoning manila folder.She pulled out a small stack of stapled papers and handed them to Gabrielle.\"Sexton's financial records.\"Gabrielle studied the documents in astonishment. The records went back severalyears. Although Gabrielle was not privy to the internal workings of Sexton'sfinances, she sensed this data was authentic – banking accounts, credit cardaccounts, loans, stock assets, real estate assets, debts, capital gains andlosses. \"This is private data. Where did you get this?\"\"My source is not your concern. But if you spend some time studying thesefigures, you will clearly see that Senator Sexton does not have the kind ofmoney he is currently spending. After Katherine died, he squandered the vastmajority of her legacy on bad investments, personal comforts, and buying himselfwhat appears to be certain victory in the primaries. As of six months ago, yourcandidate was broke.\"Gabrielle sensed this had to be a bluff. If Sexton were broke, he sure wasn'tacting it. He was buying advertising time in bigger and bigger blocks everyweek.\"Your candidate,\" Tench continued, \"is currently outspending the President fourto one. And he has no personal money.\"\"We get a lot of donations.\"\"Yes, some of them legal.\"Gabrielle's head shot up. \"I beg your pardon?\"Tench leaned across the desk, and Gabrielle could smell her nicotine breath.\"Gabrielle Ashe, I am going to ask you a question, and I suggest you think verycarefully before you answer. It could affect whether you spend the next fewyears in jail or not. Are you aware that Senator Sexton is accepting enormousillegal campaign bribes from aerospace companies who have billions to gain fromthe privatization of NASA?\"Gabrielle stared. \"That's an absurd allegation!\"\"Are you saying you are unaware of this activity?\"\"I think I would know if the senator were accepting bribes of the magnitude youare suggesting.\"Tench smiled coldly. \"Gabrielle, I understand that Senator Sexton has shared alot of himself with you, but I assure you there is plenty you do not know aboutthe man.\"Gabrielle stood up. \"This meeting is over.\"\"On the contrary,\" Tench said, removing the remaining contents of the folder andspreading it on the desk. \"This meeting is just beginning.\"44Inside the habisphere's \"staging room,\" Rachel Sexton felt like an astronaut asshe slid into one of NASA's Mark IX microclimate survival suits. The black,one-piece, hooded jumpsuit resembled an inflatable scuba suit. Its two-ply,memory-foam fabric was fitted with hollow channels through which a dense gel waspumped to help the wearer regulate body temperature in both hot and coldenvironments.Now, as Rachel pulled the tight-fitting hood over her head, her eyes fell on theNASA administrator. He appeared as a silent sentinel at the door, clearlydispleased with the necessity for this little mission.Norah Mangor was muttering obscenities as she got everyone outfitted. \"Here's anextra pudgy,\" she said, tossing Corky his suit.Tolland was already half into his.Once Rachel was fully zipped up, Norah found the stopcock on Rachel's side andconnected her to an infusion tube that coiled out of a silver canisterresembling a large scuba tank.\"Inhale,\" Norah said, opening the valve.Rachel heard a hiss and felt gel being injected into the suit. The memory foamexpanded, and the suit compressed around her, pressing down on her inner layerof clothing. The sensation reminded her of sticking her hand underwater whilewearing a rubber glove. As the hood inflated around her head, it pressed in onher ears, making everything sound muffled. I'm in a cocoon.\"Best thing about the Mark IX,\" Norah said, \"is the padding. You can fall onyour ass and not feel a thing.\"Rachel believed it. She felt like she was trapped inside a mattress.Norah handed Rachel a series of tools – an ice ax, tether snaps, and carabiners,which she affixed to the belt harnessed on Rachel's waist.\"All this?\" Rachel asked, eyeing the gear. \"To go two hundred yards?\"Norah's eyes narrowed. \"You want to come or not?\"Tolland gave Rachel a reassuring nod. \"Norah's just being careful.\"Corky connected to the infusion tank and inflated his suit, looking amused. \"Ifeel like I'm wearing a giant condom.\"Norah gave a disgusted groan. \"Like you'd know, virgin boy.\"Tolland sat down next to Rachel. He gave her a weak smile as she donned herheavy boots and crampons. \"You sure you want to come?\" His eyes had a protectiveconcern that drew her in.Rachel hoped her confident nod belied her growing trepidation. Two hundredyards... not far at all. \"And you thought you could find excitement only on thehigh seas.\"Tolland chuckled, talking as he attached his own crampons. \"I've decided I likeliquid water much better than this frozen stuff.\"\"I've never been a big fan of either,\" Rachel said. \"I fell through the ice as akid. Water's made me nervous ever since.\"Tolland glanced over, his eyes sympathetic. \"Sorry to hear that. When this isover, you'll have to come out and visit me on the Goya. I'll change your mindabout water. Promise.\"The invitation surprised her. The Goya was Tolland's research ship – well-knownboth from its role in Amazing Seas as well as its reputation as one of thestrangest-looking ships on the ocean. Although a visit to the Goya would beunnerving for Rachel, she knew it would be hard to pass up.\"She's anchored twelve miles off the coast of New Jersey at the moment,\" Tollandsaid, struggling with his crampon latches.\"Sounds like an unlikely spot.\"\"Not at all. The Atlantic seaboard is an incredible place. We were gearing up toshoot a new documentary when I was so rudely interrupted by the President.\"Rachel laughed. \"Shooting a documentary on what?\"\"Sphyrna mokarran and megaplumes.\"Rachel frowned. \"Glad I asked.\"Tolland finished attaching his crampons and looked up. \"Seriously, I'll befilming out there for a couple weeks. Washington's not that far from the Jerseycoast. Come out when you get back home. No reason to spend your life afraid ofthe water. My crew would roll out the red carpet for you.\"Norah Mangor's voice blared. \"Are we going outside, or should I get you two somecandles and champagne?\"45Gabrielle Ashe had no idea what to make of the documents now spread out beforeher on Marjorie Tench's desk. The pile included photocopied letters, faxes,transcripts of phone conversations, and they all seemed to support theallegation that Senator Sexton was in covert dialogue with private spacecompanies.Tench pushed a couple of grainy black-and-white photographs toward Gabrielle. \"Iassume this is news to you?\"Gabrielle looked at the photos. The first candid shot showed Senator Sextongetting out of a taxi in some kind of underground garage. Sexton never takestaxis. Gabrielle looked at the second shot – a telephoto of Sexton climbing intoa parked white minivan. An old man appeared to be in the van waiting for him.\"Who is that?\" Gabrielle said, suspicious the photos might be faked.\"A big shot from the SFF.\"Gabrielle was doubtful. \"The Space Frontier Foundation?\"The SFF was like a \"union\" for private space companies. It represented aerospacecontractors, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists – any private entity that wantedto go into space. They tended to be critical of NASA, arguing that the U.S.space program employed unfair business practices to prevent private companiesfrom launching missions into space.\"The SFF,\" Tench said, \"now represents over a hundred major corporations, somevery wealthy enterprises who are waiting eagerly for the Space CommercializationPromotions Act to be ratified.\"Gabrielle considered it. For obvious reasons the SFF was a vocal supporter ofSexton's campaign, although the senator had been careful not to get too close tothem because of their controversial lobbying tactics. Recently the SFF hadpublished an explosive rant charging that NASA was in fact an \"illegal monopoly\"whose ability to operate at a loss and still stay in business represented unfaircompetition to private firms. According to the SFF, whenever AT&T needed atelecomm satellite launched, several private space companies offered to do thejob at a reasonable $50 million. Unfortunately, NASA always stepped in andoffered to launch AT&T's satellites for a mere twenty-five million, even thoughit cost NASA five times that to do the job! Operating at a loss is one way NASAkeeps its grip on space, the SFF lawyers accused. And taxpayers pick up the tab.\"This photo reveals,\" Tench said, \"that your candidate is holding secretmeetings with an organization that represents private space enterprises.\" Tenchmotioned to several other documents on the table. \"We also have internal SFFmemos calling for huge sums of money to be collected from SFF member companies –in amounts commensurate with their net worth – and transferred to accountscontrolled by Senator Sexton. In effect, these private space agencies areanteing up to put Sexton in office. I can only assume he has agreed to pass thecommercialization bill and privatize NASA if elected.\"Gabrielle looked at the pile of papers, unconvinced. \"Do you expect me tobelieve that the White House has evidence that its opponent is engaged inprofoundly illegal campaign finance – and yet, for some reason, you are keepingit secret?\"\"What would you believe?\"Gabrielle glared. \"Frankly, considering your skills for manipulation, a morelogical solution seems that you are plying me somehow with phony documents andphotos produced by some enterprising White House staffer and his desktoppublishing computer.\"\"Possible, I admit. But not true.\"\"No? Then how did you get all these internal documents from corporations? Theresources required to steal all of this evidence from so many companiescertainly exceeds the grasp of the White House.\"\"You're right. This information arrived here as an unsolicited gift.\"Gabrielle was now lost.\"Oh yes,\" Tench said, \"we get a lot of it. The President has many powerfulpolitical allies who would like to see him stay in office. Remember, yourcandidate is suggesting cuts all over the place – a lot of them right here inWashington. Senator Sexton certainly has no qualms about citing the FBI'sbloated budget as an example of government overspending. He's taken somepotshots at the IRS, too. Maybe someone at the bureau or at the service got alittle annoyed.\"Gabrielle got the implication. People at the FBI and IRS would have ways ofgetting this kind of information. They might then send it to the White House asan unsolicited favor to help the President's election. But what Gabrielle couldnot make herself believe was that Senator Sexton would ever be engaged inillegal campaign funding. \"If this data is accurate,\" Gabrielle challenged,\"which I strongly doubt it is, why haven't you gone public?\"\"Why do you think?\"\"Because it was gathered illegally.\"\"How we got it makes no difference.\"\"Of course it makes a difference. It's inadmissible in a hearing.\"\"What hearing? We'd simply leak this to a newspaper, and they'd run it as a'credible-source' story with photos and documentation. Sexton would be guiltyuntil proven innocent. His vocal anti-NASA stance would be virtual proof that heis taking bribes.\"Gabrielle knew it was true. \"Fine,\" she challenged, \"then why haven't you leakedthe information?\"\"Because it's a negative. The President promised not to go negative in thecampaign and he wants to stick to that promise as long as he can.\"Yeah, right! \"You're telling me the President is so upstanding that he refusesto go public with this because people might consider it a negative?\"\"It's a negative for the country. It implicates dozens of private companies,many of which are made up of honest people. It besmirches the office of the U.S.Senate and is bad for the country's morale. Dishonest politicians hurt allpoliticians. Americans need to trust their leaders. This would be an uglyinvestigation and would most likely send a U.S. senator and numerous prominentaerospace executives to jail.\"Although Tench's logic did make sense, Gabrielle still doubted the allegations.\"What does any of this have to do with me?\"\"Simply put, Ms. Ashe, if we release these documents, your candidate will beindicted for illegal campaign financing, lose his Senate seat, and most likelydo prison time.\" Tench paused. \"Unless...\"Gabrielle saw a snakelike glint in the senior adviser's eyes. \"Unless what?\"Tench took a long drag on her cigarette. \"Unless you decide to help us avoid allthat.\"A murky silence settled over the room.Tench coughed roughly. \"Gabrielle, listen, I decided to share this unfortunateinformation with you for three reasons. First, to show you Zach Herney is adecent man who considers the government's well-being before his personal gain.Second, to inform you that your candidate is not as trustworthy as you mightthink. And third, to persuade you to accept the offer I am about to make.\"\"That offer being?\"\"I'd like to offer you a chance to do the right thing. The patriotic thing.Whether you know it or not, you're in a unique position to spare Washington allkinds of unpleasant scandal. If you can do what I am about to ask, perhaps youcould even earn yourself a place on the President's team.\"A place on the President's team? Gabrielle couldn't believe what she washearing. \"Ms. Tench, whatever you have in mind, I do not appreciate beingblack-mailed, coerced, or talked down to. I work for the senator's campaignbecause I believe in his politics. And if this is any indication of the way ZachHerney exerts political influence, I have no interest in being associated withhim! If you've got something on Senator Sexton, then I suggest you leak it tothe press. Frankly, I think this whole thing's a sham.\"Tench gave a dreary sigh. \"Gabrielle, your candidate's illegal funding is afact. I'm sorry. I know you trust him.\" She lowered her voice. \"Look, here's thepoint. The President and I will go public with the funding issue if we must, butit will get ugly on a grand scale. This scandal involves several major U.S.corporations breaking the law. A lot of innocent people will pay the price.\" Shetook a long drag and exhaled. \"What the President and I are hoping for here...is some other way to discredit the senator's ethics. A way that is morecontained... one in which no innocent parties get hurt.\" Tench set down hercigarette and folded her hands. \"Simply put, we would like you to publicly admitthat you had an affair with the senator.\"Gabrielle's entire body went rigid. Tench sounded utterly certain of herself.Impossible, Gabrielle knew. There was no proof. The sex had happened only once,behind locked doors in Sexton's senatorial office. Tench has nothing. She'sfishing. Gabrielle fought to retain her steady tone. \"You assume a lot, Ms.Tench.\"\"Which? That you had an affair? Or that you would abandon your candidate?\"\"Both.\"Tench gave a curt smile and stood up. \"Well, let's put one of those facts torest right now, shall we?\" She walked to her wall safe again and returned with ared manila folder. It was stamped with the White House seal. She unhooked theclasp, tipped the envelope over, and dumped the contents out on the desk infront of Gabrielle.As dozens of color photographs spilled out onto the desk, Gabrielle saw herentire career come crashing down before her.46Outside the habisphere, the katabatic wind roaring down off the glacier wasnothing like the ocean winds Tolland was accustomed to. On the ocean, wind was afunction of tides and pressure fronts and came in gusting ebbs and flows. Thekatabatic, however, was a slave to simple physics – heavy cold air rushing downa glacial incline like a tidal wave. It was the most resolute gale force Tollandhad ever experienced. Had it been coming at twenty knots, the katabatic wouldhave been a sailor's dream, but at its current eighty knots it could quicklybecome a nightmare even for those on solid ground. Tolland found that if hepaused and leaned backward, the stalwart squall could easily prop him up.Making the raging river of air even more unnerving to Tolland was the slightdownwind grade of the ice shelf. The ice was sloped ever so slightly toward theocean, two miles away. Despite the sharp spikes on the Pitbull Rapido cramponsattached to his boots, Tolland had the uneasy feeling that any misstep mightleave him caught up in a gale and sliding down the endless icy slope. NorahMangor's two-minute course in glacier safety now seemed dangerously inadequate.Piranha Ice ax, Norah had said, fastening a lightweight T-shaped tool to each oftheir belts as they suited up in the habisphere. Standard blade, banana blade,semitubular blade, hammer, and adze. All you need to remember is, if anyoneslips or gets caught up in a gust, grab your ax with one hand on the head andone on the shaft, ram the banana blade into the ice, and fall on it, plantingyour crampons.With those words of assurance, Norah Mangor had affixed YAK belay harnesses toeach of them. They all donned goggles, and headed out into the afternoondarkness.Now, the four figures made their way down the glacier in a straight line withten yards of belay rope separating each of them. Norah was in the lead position,followed by Corky, then Rachel, and Tolland as anchor.As they moved farther away from the habisphere, Tolland felt a growinguneasiness. In his inflated suit, although warm, he felt like some kind ofuncoordinated space traveler trekking across a distant planet. The moon haddisappeared behind thick, billowing storm clouds, plunging the ice sheet into animpenetrable blackness. The katabatic wind seemed to be getting stronger by theminute, applying a constant pressure to Tolland's back. As his eyes strainedthrough his goggles to make out the expansive emptiness around them, he began toperceive a true danger in this place. Redundant NASA safety precautions or not,Tolland was surprised the administrator had been willing to risk four lives outhere instead of two. Especially when the additional two lives were that of asenator's daughter and a famous astrophysicist. Tolland was not surprised tofeel a protective concern for Rachel and Corky. As someone who had captained aship, he was used to feeling responsible for those around him.\"Stay behind me,\" Norah shouted, her voice swallowed by the wind. \"Let the sledlead the way.\"The aluminum sled on which Norah was transporting her testing gear resembled anoversized Flexible Flyer. The craft was prepacked with diagnostic gear andsafety accessories she'd been using on the glacier over the past few days. Allof her gear – including a battery pack, safety flares, and a powerfulfront-mounted spotlight – was bound under a secured, plastic tarp. Despite theheavy load, the sled glided effortlessly on long, straight runners. Even on thealmost imperceptible incline, the sled moved downhill on its own accord, andNorah applied a gentle restraint, almost as if allowing the sled to lead theway.Sensing the distance growing between the group and the habisphere, Tollandlooked over his shoulder. Only fifty yards away, the pale curvature of the domehad all but disappeared in the blustery blackness.\"You at all worried about finding our way back?\" Tolland yelled. \"The habisphereis almost invisi –\" His words were cut short by the loud hiss of a flareigniting in Norah's hand. The sudden red-white glow illuminated the ice shelf ina ten-yard radius all around them. Norah used her heel to dig a small impressionin the surface snow, piling up a protective ridge on the upwind side of thehole. Then she rammed the flare into the indentation.\"High-tech bread crumbs,\" Norah shouted.\"Bread crumbs?\" Rachel asked, shielding her eyes from the sudden light.\"Hansel and Gretel,\" Norah shouted. \"These flares will last an hour – plenty oftime to find our way back.\"With that, Norah headed out again, leading them down the glacier – into thedarkness once again.47Gabrielle Ashe stormed out of Marjorie Tench's office and practically knockedover a secretary in doing so. Mortified, all Gabrielle could see were thephotographs – images – arms and legs intertwined. Faces filled with ecstasy.Gabrielle had no idea how the photos had been taken, but she knew damn well theywere real. They had been taken in Senator Sexton's office and seemed to havebeen shot from above as if by hidden camera. God help me. One of the photosshowed Gabrielle and Sexton having sex directly on top of the senator's desk,their bodies sprawled across a scatter of official-looking documents.Marjorie Tench caught up with Gabrielle outside the Map Room. Tench was carryingthe red envelope of photos. \"I assume from your reaction that you believe thesephotos are authentic?\" The President's senior adviser actually looked like shewas having a good time. \"I'm hoping they persuade you that our other data isaccurate as well. They came from the same source.\"Gabrielle felt her entire body flushing as she marched down the hall. Where thehell is the exit?Tench's gangly legs had no trouble keeping up. \"Senator Sexton swore to theworld that you two are platonic associates. His televised statement was actuallyquite convincing.\" Tench motioned smugly over her shoulder. \"In fact, I have atape in my office if you'd like to refresh your memory?\"Gabrielle needed no refresher. She remembered the press conference all too well.Sexton's denial was as adamant as it was heartfelt.\"It's unfortunate,\" Tench said, sounding not at all disappointed, \"but SenatorSexton looked the American people in the eye and told a bald-faced lie. Thepublic has a right to know. And they will know. I'll see to it personally. Theonly question now is how the public finds out. We believe it's best coming fromyou.\"Gabrielle was stunned. \"You really think I'm going to help lynch my owncandidate?\"Tench's face hardened. \"I am trying to take the high ground here, Gabrielle. I'mgiving you a chance to save everyone a lot of embarrassment by holding your headhigh and telling the truth. All I need is a signed statement admitting youraffair.\"Gabrielle stopped short. \"What!\"\"Of course. A signed statement gives us the leverage we need to deal with thesenator quietly, sparing the country this ugly mess. My offer is simple: Sign astatement for me, and these photos never need to see the light of day.\"\"You want a statement?\"\"Technically, I would need an affidavit, but we have a notary here in thebuilding who could –\"\"You're crazy.\" Gabrielle was walking again.Tench stayed at her side, sounding more angry now. \"Senator Sexton is going downone way or another, Gabrielle, and I'm offering you a chance to get out of thiswithout seeing your own naked ass in the morning paper! The President is adecent man and doesn't want these photos publicized. If you just give me anaffidavit and confess to the affair on your own terms, then all of us can retaina little dignity.\"\"I'm not for sale.\"\"Well, your candidate certainly is. He's a dangerous man, and he's breaking thelaw.\"\"He's breaking the law? You're the ones breaking into offices and taking illegalsurveillance pictures! Ever heard of Watergate?\"\"We had nothing to do with gathering this dirt. These photos came from the samesource as the SFF campaign-funding information. Someone's been watching you twovery closely.\"Gabrielle tore past the security desk where she had gotten her security badge.She ripped off the badge and tossed it to the wide-eyed guard. Tench was stillon her tail.\"You'll need to decide fast, Ms. Ashe,\" Tench said as they neared the exit.\"Either bring me an affidavit admitting you slept with the senator, or at eighto'clock tonight, the president will be forced to go public with everything –Sexton's financial dealings, the photos of you, the works. And believe me, whenthe public sees that you stood idly by and let Sexton lie about yourrelationship, you'll go down in flames right beside him.\"Gabrielle saw the door and headed for it.\"On my desk by eight o'clock tonight, Gabrielle. Be smart.\" Tench tossed her thefolder of photographs on her way out. \"Keep them, sweetie. We've got plentymore.\"48Rachel Sexton felt a growing chill inside as she moved down the ice sheet into adeepening night. Disquieting images swirled in her mind – the meteorite, thephosphorescent plankton, the implications if Norah Mangor had made a mistakewith the ice cores.A solid matrix of freshwater ice, Norah had argued, reminding them all that shehad drilled cores all around the area as well as directly over the meteorite. Ifthe glacier contained saltwater interstices filled with plankton, she would haveseen them. Wouldn't she? Nonetheless, Rachel's intuition kept returning to thesimplest solution.There are plankton frozen in this glacier.Ten minutes and four flares later, Rachel and the others were approximately 250yards from the habisphere. Without warning, Norah stopped short. \"This is thespot,\" she said, sounding like a water-witch diviner who had mystically sensedthe perfect spot to drill a well.Rachel turned and glanced up the slope behind them. The habisphere had longsince disappeared into the dim, moonlit night, but the line of flares wasclearly visible, the farthest one twinkling reassuringly like a faint star. Theflares were in a perfectly straight line, like a carefully calculated runway.Rachel was impressed with Norah's skills.\"Another reason we let the sled go first,\" Norah called out when she saw Racheladmiring the line of flares. \"The runners are straight. If we let gravity leadthe sled and we don't interfere, we're guaranteed to travel in a straight line.\"\"Neat trick,\" Tolland yelled. \"Wish there were something like that for the opensea.\"This IS the open sea, Rachel thought, picturing the ocean beneath them. For asplit second, the most distant flame caught her attention. It had disappeared,as if the light had been blotted out by a passing form. A moment later, though,the light reappeared. Rachel felt a sudden uneasiness. \"Norah,\" she yelled overthe wind, \"did you say there were polar bears up here?\"The glaciologist was preparing a final flare and either did not hear or wasignoring her.\"Polar bears,\" Tolland yelled, \"eat seals. They only attack humans when weinvade their space.\"\"But this is polar bear country, right?\" Rachel could never remember which polehad bears and which had penguins.\"Yeah,\" Tolland shouted back. \"Polar bears actually give the Arctic its name.Arktos is Greek for bear.\"Terrific. Rachel gazed nervously into the dark.\"Antarctica has no polar bears,\" Tolland said. \"So they call it Anti-arktos.\"\"Thanks, Mike,\" Rachel yelled. \"Enough talk of polar bears.\"He laughed. \"Right. Sorry.\"Norah pressed a final flare into the snow. As before, the four of them wereengulfed in a reddish glow, looking bloated in their black weather suits. Beyondthe circle of light emanating from the flare, the rest of the world becametotally invisible, a circular shroud of blackness engulfing them.As Rachel and the others looked on, Norah planted her feet and used carefuloverhand motions to reel the sled several yards back up the slope to where theywere standing. Then, keeping the rope taut, she crouched and manually activatedthe sled's talon brakes – four angled spikes that dug into the ice to keep thesled stationary. That done, she stood up and brushed herself off, the ropearound her waist falling slack.\"All right,\" Norah shouted. \"Time to go to work.\"The glaciologist circled to the downwind end of the sled and began unfasteningthe butterfly eyelets holding the protective canvas over the gear. Rachel,feeling like she had been a little hard on Norah, moved to help by unfasteningthe rear of the flap.\"Jesus, NO!\" Norah yelled, her head snapping up. \"Don't ever do that!\"Rachel recoiled, confused.\"Never unfasten the upwind side!\" Norah said. \"You'll create a wind sock! Thissled would have taken off like an umbrella in a wind tunnel!\"Rachel backed off. \"I'm sorry. I...\"She glared. \"You and space boy shouldn't be out here.\"None of us should, Rachel thought.Amateurs, Norah seethed, cursing the administrator's insistence on sending Corkyand Sexton along. These clowns are going to get someone killed out here. Thelast thing Norah wanted right now was to play baby-sitter.\"Mike,\" she said, \"I need help lifting the GPR off the sled.\"Tolland helped her unpack the Ground Penetrating Radar and position it on theice. The instrument looked like three miniature snowplow blades that had beenaffixed in parallel to an aluminum frame. The entire device was no more than ayard long and was connected by cables to a current attenuator and a marinebattery on the sled.\"That's radar?\" Corky asked, yelling over the wind.Norah nodded in silence. Ground Penetrating Radar was far more equipped to seebrine ice than PODS was. The GPR transmitter sent pulses of electromagneticenergy through the ice, and the pulses bounced differently off substances ofdiffering crystal structure. Pure freshwater froze in a flat, shingled lattice.However, seawater froze in more of a meshed or forked lattice on account of itssodium content, causing the GPR pulses to bounce back erratically, greatlydiminishing the number of reflections.Norah powered up the machine. \"I'll be taking a kind of echo-locationcross-sectional image of the ice sheet around the extraction pit,\" she yelled.\"The machine's internal software will render a cross section of the glacier andthen print it out. Any sea ice will register as a shadow.\"\"Printout?\" Tolland looked surprised. \"You can print out here?\"Norah pointed to a cable from the GPR leading to a device still protected underthe canopy. \"No choice but to print. Computer screens use too much valuablebattery power, so field glaciologists print data to heat-transfer printers.Colors aren't brilliant, but laser toner clumps below neg twenty. Learned thatthe hard way in Alaska.\"Norah asked everyone to stand on the downhill side of the GPR as she prepared toalign the transmitter such that it would scan the area of the meteorite hole,almost three football fields away. But as Norah looked back through the night inthe general direction from which they had come, she couldn't see a damn thing.\"Mike, I need to align the GPR transmitter with the meteorite site, but thisflare has me blinded. I'm going back up the slope just enough to get out of thelight. I'll hold my arms in line with the flares, and you adjust the alignmenton the GPR.\"Tolland nodded, kneeling down beside the radar device.Norah stamped her crampons into the ice and leaned forward against the wind asshe moved up the incline toward the habisphere. The katabatic today was muchstronger than she'd imagined, and she sensed a storm coming in. It didn'tmatter. They would be done here in a matter of minutes. They'll see I'm right.Norah clomped twenty yards back toward the habisphere. She reached the edge ofthe darkness just as the belay rope went taut.Norah looked back up the glacier. As her eyes adjusted to the dark, the line offlares slowly came into view several degrees to her left. She shifted herposition until she was perfectly lined up with them. Then she held her arms outlike a compass, turning her body, indicating the exact vector. \"I'm in line withthem now!\" she yelled.Tolland adjusted the GPR device and waved. \"All set!\"Norah took a final look up the incline, grateful for the illuminated pathwayhome. As she looked out, though, something odd occurred. For an instant, one ofthe nearest flares entirely disappeared from view. Before Norah could worry thatit was dying out, the flare reappeared. If Norah didn't know better, she wouldassume something had passed between the flare and her location. Certainly nobodyelse was out here... unless of course the administrator had started to feelguilty and sent a NASA team out after them. Somehow Norah doubted it. Probablynothing, she decided. A gust of wind had momentarily killed the flame.Norah returned to the GPR. \"All lined up?\"Tolland shrugged. \"I think so.\"Norah went over to the control device on the sled and pressed a button. A sharpbuzz emanated from the GPR and then stopped. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Done.\"\"That's it?\" Corky said.\"All the work is in setup. The actual shot takes only a second.\"Onboard the sled, the heat-transfer printer had already begun to hum and click.The printer was enclosed in a clear plastic covering and was slowly ejecting aheavy, curled paper. Norah waited until the device had completed printing, andthen she reached up under the plastic and removed the printout. They'll see, shethought, carrying the printout over to the flare so that everyone could see it.There won't be any saltwater.Everyone gathered around as Norah stood over the flare, clutching the printouttightly in her gloves. She took a deep breath and uncurled the paper to examinethe data. The image on the paper made her recoil in horror.\"Oh, God!\" Norah stared, unable to believe what she was looking at. As expected,the printout revealed a clear cross section of the water-filled meteorite shaft.But what Norah had never expected to see was the hazy grayish outline of ahumanoid form floating halfway down the shaft. Her blood turned to ice. \"OhGod... there's a body in the extraction pit.\"Everyone stared in stunned silence.The ghostlike body was floating head down in the narrow shaft. Billowing aroundthe corpse like some sort of cape was an eerie shroudlike aura. Norah nowrealized what the aura was. The GPR had captured a faint trace of the victim'sheavy coat, what could only be a familiar, long, dense camel hair.\"It's... Ming,\" she said in a whisper. \"He must have slipped....\"Norah Mangor never imagined that seeing Ming's body in the extraction pit wouldbe the lesser of the two shocks the printout would reveal, but as her eyestraced downward in the shaft, she saw something else.The ice beneath the extraction shaft...Norah stared. Her first thought was that something had gone wrong with the scan.Then, as she studied the image more closely, an unsettling realization began togrow, like the storm gathering around them. The paper's edges flapped wildly inthe wind as she turned and looked more intently at the printout.But... that's impossible!Suddenly, the truth came crashing down. The realization felt like it was goingto bury her. She forgot all about Ming.Norah now understood. The saltwater in the shaft! She fell to her knees in thesnow beside the flare. She could barely breathe. Still clutching the paper inher hands, she began trembling.My God... it didn't even occur to me.Then, with a sudden eruption of rage, she spun her head in the direction of theNASA habisphere. \"You bastards!\" she screamed, her voice trailing off in thewind. \"You goddamned bastards!\"In the darkness, only fifty yards away, Delta-One held his CrypTalk device tohis mouth and spoke only two words to his controller. \"They know.\"49Norah Mangor was still kneeling on the ice when the bewildered Michael Tollandpulled the Ground Penetrating Radar's printout from her trembling hands. Shakenfrom seeing the floating body of Ming, Tolland tried to gather his thoughts anddecipher the image before him.He saw the cross section of the meteorite shaft descending from the surface downto two hundred feet into the ice. He saw Ming's body floating in the shaft.Tolland's eyes drifted lower now, and he sensed something was amiss. Directlybeneath the extraction shaft, a dark column of sea ice extended downward to theopen ocean below. The vertical pillar of saltwater ice was massive – the samediameter as the shaft.\"My God!\" Rachel yelled, looking over Tolland's shoulder. \"It looks like themeteorite shaft continues all the way through the ice shelf into the ocean!\"Tolland stood transfixed, his brain unable to accept what he knew to be the onlylogical explanation. Corky looked equally alarmed.Norah shouted, \"Someone drilled up under the shelf!\" Her eyes were wild withrage. \"Someone intentionally inserted that rock from underneath the ice!\"Although the idealist in Tolland wanted to reject Norah's words, the scientistin him knew she could easily be right. The Milne Ice Shelf was floating over theocean with plenty of clearance for a submersible. Because everything weighedsignificantly less underwater, even a small submersible not much bigger thanTolland's one-man research Triton easily could have transported the meteorite inits payload arms. The sub could have approached from the ocean, submergedbeneath the ice shelf, and drilled upward into the ice. Then, it could have usedan extending payload arm or inflatable balloons to push the meteorite up intothe shaft. Once the meteorite was in place, the ocean water that had risen intothe shaft behind the meteorite would begin to freeze. As soon as the shaftclosed enough to hold the meteorite in place, the sub could retract its arm anddisappear, leaving Mother Nature to seal the remainder of the tunnel and eraseall traces of the deception.\"But why?\" Rachel demanded, taking the printout from Tolland and studying it.\"Why would someone do that? Are you sure your GPR is working?\"\"Of course, I'm sure! And the printout perfectly explains the presence ofphosphorescent bacteria in the water!\"Tolland had to admit, Norah's logic was chillingly sound. Phosphorescentdinoflagellates would have followed instinct and swum upward into the meteoriteshaft, becoming trapped just beneath the meteorite and freezing into the ice.Later, when Norah heated the meteorite, the ice directly beneath would havemelted, releasing the plankton. Again, they would swim upward, this timereaching the surface inside the habisphere, where they would eventually die forlack of saltwater.\"This is crazy!\" Corky yelled. \"NASA has a meteorite with extraterrestrialfossils in it. Why would they care where it's found? Why would they go to thetrouble to bury it under an ice shelf?\"\"Who the hell knows,\" Norah fired back, \"but GPR printouts don't lie. We weretricked. That meteorite isn't part of the Jungersol Fall. It was inserted in theice recently. Within the last year, or the plankton would be dead!\" She wasalready packing up her GPR gear on the sled and fastening it down. \"We've to getback and tell someone! The President is about to go public with all the wrongdata! NASA tricked him!\"\"Wait a minute!\" Rachel yelled. \"We should at least run another scan to makesure. None of this makes sense. Who will believe it?\"\"Everyone,\" Norah said, preparing her sled. \"When I march into the habisphereand drill another core sample out of the bottom of the meteorite shaft and itcomes up as saltwater ice, I guarantee you everyone will believe this!\"Norah disengaged the brakes on the equipment sled, redirected it toward thehabisphere, and started back up the slope, digging her crampons into the ice andpulling the sled behind her with surprising ease. She was a woman on a mission.\"Let's go!\" Norah shouted, pulling the tethered group along as she headed towardthe perimeter of the illuminated circle. \"I don't know what NASA's up to here,but I sure as hell don't appreciate being used as a pawn for their – \"Norah Mangor's neck snapped back as if she'd been rammed in the forehead by someinvisible force. She let out a guttural gasp of pain, wavered, and collapsedbackward onto the ice. Almost instantly, Corky let out a cry and spun around asif his shoulder had been propelled backward. He fell to the ice, writhing inpain.Rachel immediately forgot all about the printout in her hand, Ming, themeteorite, and the bizarre tunnel beneath the ice. She had just felt a smallprojectile graze her ear, barely missing her temple. Instinctively, she droppedto her knees, yanking Tolland down with her.\"What's going on!\" Tolland screamed.A hailstorm was all Rachel could imagine – balls of ice blowing down off theglacier – and yet from the force with which Corky and Norah had just been hit,Rachel knew the hailstones would have to be moving at hundreds of miles an hour.Eerily, the sudden barrage of marble-sized objects seemed now to focus on Racheland Tolland, pelting all around them, sending up plumes of exploding ice. Rachelrolled onto her stomach, dug her crampon's toe spikes into the ice, and launchedtoward the only cover available. The sled. Tolland arrived a moment later,scrambling and hunkering down beside her.Tolland looked out at Norah and Corky unprotected on the ice. \"Pull them in withthe tether!\" he yelled, grabbing the rope and trying to pull.But the tether was wrapped around the sled.Rachel stuffed the printout in the Velcro pocket of her Mark IX suit, andscrambled on all fours toward the sled, trying to untangle the rope from thesled runners. Tolland was right behind her.The hailstones suddenly rained down in a barrage against the sled, as if MotherNature had abandoned Corky and Norah and was taking direct aim at Rachel andTolland. One of the projectiles slammed into the top of the sled tarp, partiallyembedding itself, and then bounced over, landing on the sleeve of Rachel's coat.When Rachel saw it, she froze. In an instant, the bewilderment she had beenfeeling turned to terror. These \"hailstones\" were man-made. The ball of ice onher sleeve was a flawlessly shaped spheroid the size of a large cherry. Thesurface was polished and smooth, marred only by a linear seam around thecircumference, like an old-fashioned lead musket ball, machined in a press. Theglobular pellets were, without a doubt, man-made.Ice bullets...As someone with military clearance, Rachel was well acquainted with the newexperimental \"IM\" weaponry – Improvised Munitions – snow rifles that compactedsnow into ice pellets, desert rifles that melted sand into glass projectiles,water-based firearms that shot pulses of liquid water with such force that theycould break bones. Improvised Munitions weaponry had an enormous advantage overconventional weapons because IM weapons used available resources and literallymanufactured munitions on the spot, providing soldiers unlimited rounds withouttheir having to carry heavy conventional bullets. The ice balls being fired atthem now, Rachel knew, were being compressed \"on demand\" from snow fed into thebutt of the rifle.As was often the case in the intelligence world, the more one knew, the morefrightening a scenario became. This moment was no exception. Rachel would havepreferred blissful ignorance, but her knowledge of IM weaponry instantly led herto a sole chilling conclusion: They were being attacked by some kind of U.S.Special Ops force, the only forces in the country currently cleared to use theseexperimental IM weapons in the field.The presence of a military covert operations unit brought with it a second, evenmore terrifying realization: The probability of surviving this attack was closeto zero.The morbid thought was terminated as one of the ice pellets found an opening andcame screaming through the wall of gear on the sled, colliding with her stomach.Even in her padded Mark IX suit, Rachel felt like an invisible prizefighter hadjust gut-punched her. Stars began to dance around the periphery of her vision,and she teetered backward, grabbing gear on the sled for balance. MichaelTolland dropped Norah's tether and lunged to support Rachel, but he arrived toolate. Rachel fell backward, pulling a pile of equipment with her. She andTolland tumbled to the ice in a pile of electronic apparatus.\"They're... bullets...,\" she gasped, the air momentarily crushed from her lungs.\"Run!\"50The Washington MetroRail subway now leaving Federal Triangle station could notspeed away from the White House fast enough for Gabrielle Ashe. She sat rigid ina deserted corner of the train as darkened shapes tore past outside in a blur.Marjorie Tench's big red envelope lay in Gabrielle's lap, pressing down like aten-ton weight.I've got to talk to Sexton! she thought, the train accelerating now in thedirection of Sexton's office building. Immediately!Now, in the dim, shifting light of the train, Gabrielle felt like she wasenduring some kind of hallucinogenic drug trip. Muted lights whipped by overheadlike slow-motion discotheque strobes. The ponderous tunnel rose on all sideslike a deepening canyon.Tell me this is not happening.She gazed down at the envelope on her lap. Unclasping the flap, she reachedinside and pulled out one of the photos. The internal lights of the trainflickered for a moment, the harsh glare illuminating a shocking image –Sedgewick Sexton lying naked in his office, his gratified face turned perfectlytoward the camera while Gabrielle's dark form lay nude beside him.She shivered, rammed the photo back inside, and fumbled to reclasp the envelope.It's over.As soon as the train exited the tunnel and climbed onto the aboveground tracksnear L'Enfant Plaza, Gabrielle dug out her cellphone and called the senator'sprivate cellular number. His voice mail answered. Puzzled, she phoned thesenator's office. The secretary answered.\"It's Gabrielle. Is he in?\"The secretary sounded peeved. \"Where have you been? He was looking for you.\"\"I had a meeting that ran long. I need to talk to him right away.\"\"You'll have to wait till morning. He's at Westbrooke.\"Westbrooke Place Luxury Apartments was the building where Sexton kept his D.C.residence. \"He's not picking up his private line,\" Gabrielle said.\"He blocked off tonight as a P.E.,\" the secretary reminded. \"He left early.\"Gabrielle scowled. Personal Event. In all the excitement, she'd forgotten Sextonhad scheduled himself a night alone at home. He was very particular about notbeing disturbed during his P.E. blocks. Bang on my door only if the building ison fire, he would say. Other than that, it can wait until morning. Gabrielledecided Sexton's building was definitely on fire. \"I need you to reach him forme.\"\"Impossible.\"\"This is serious, I really –\"\"No, I mean literally impossible. He left his pager on my desk on his way outand told me he was not to be disturbed all night. He was adamant.\" She paused.\"More so than usual.\"Shit. \"Okay, thanks.\" Gabrielle hung up.\"L'Enfant Plaza,\" a recording announced in the subway car. \"Connection allstations.\"Closing her eyes, Gabrielle tried to clear her mind, but devastating imagesrushed in... the lurid photos of herself and the senator... the pile ofdocuments alleging Sexton was taking bribes. Gabrielle could still hear Tench'sraspy demands. Do the right thing. Sign the affidavit. Admit the affair.As the train screeched into the station, Gabrielle forced herself to imaginewhat the senator would do if the photos hit the presses. The first thing to popin her mind both shocked and shamed her.Sexton would lie.Was this truly her first instinct regarding her candidate?Yes. He would lie... brilliantly.If these photos hit the media without Gabrielle's having admitted the affair,the senator would simply claim the photos were a cruel forgery. This was the ageof digital photo editing; anyone who had ever been on-line had seen theflawlessly retouched spoof photographs of celebrities' heads digitally meldedonto other people's bodies, often those of porn stars engaged in lewd acts.Gabrielle had already witnessed the senator's ability to look into a televisioncamera and lie convincingly about their affair; she had no doubt he couldpersuade the world these photos were a lame attempt to derail his career. Sextonwould lash out with indignant outrage, perhaps even insinuate that the Presidenthimself had ordered the forgery.No wonder the White House hasn't gone public. The photos, Gabrielle realized,could backfire just like the initial drudge. As vivid as the pictures seemed,they were totally inconclusive.Gabrielle felt a sudden surge of hope.The White House can't prove any of this is real!Tench's powerplay on Gabrielle had been ruthless in its simplicity: Admit youraffair or watch Sexton go to jail. Suddenly it made perfect sense. The WhiteHouse needed Gabrielle to admit the affair, or the photos were worthless. Asudden glimmer of confidence brightened her mood.As the train sat idling and the doors slid open, another distant door seemed toopen in Gabrielle's mind, revealing an abrupt and heartening possibility.Maybe everything Tench told me about the bribery was a lie.After all, what had Gabrielle really seen? Yet again, nothing conclusive – someXeroxed bank documents, a grainy photo of Sexton in a garage. All of itpotentially counterfeit. Tench cunningly could have showed Gabrielle bogusfinancial records in the same sitting as the genuine sex photos, hopingGabrielle would accept the entire package as true. It was called \"authenticationby association,\" and politicians used it all the time to sell dubious concepts.Sexton is innocent, Gabrielle told herself. The White House was desperate, andthey had decided to take a wild gamble on scaring Gabrielle into going publicabout the affair. They needed Gabrielle to desert Sexton publicly –scandalously. Get out while you can, Tench had told her. You have until eighto'clock tonight. The ultimate pressure sales job. All of it fits, she thought.Except one thing...The only confusing piece of the puzzle was that Tench had been sending Gabrielleanti-NASA e-mails. This certainly suggested NASA really did want Sexton tosolidify his anti-NASA stance so they could use it against him. Or did it?Gabrielle realized that even the e-mails had a perfectly logical explanation.What if the e-mails were not really from Tench?It was possible Tench caught a traitor on staff sending Gabrielle data, firedthat person, and then stepped in and e-mailed the final message herself, callingGabrielle in for a meeting. Tench could have pretended she leaked all the NASAdata on purpose – to set Gabrielle up.The subway hydraulics hissed now in L'Enfant Plaza, the doors preparing toclose.Gabrielle stared out at the platform, her mind racing. She had no idea if hersuspicions were making any sense or if they were just wishful thinking, butwhatever the hell was going on, she knew she had to talk to the senator rightaway – P.E. night or not.Clutching the envelope of photographs, Gabrielle hurried off the train just asthe doors hissed shut. She had a new destination.Westbrooke Place Apartments.51Fight or flight.As a biologist, Tolland knew that vast physiological changes occurred when anorganism sensed danger. Adrenaline flooded the cerebral cortex, jolting theheart rate and commanding the brain to make the oldest and most intuitive of allbiological decisions – whether to do battle or flee.Tolland's instinct told him to flee, and yet reason reminded him he was stilltethered to Norah Mangor. There was nowhere to flee anyway. The only cover formiles was the habisphere, and the attackers, whoever the hell they were, hadpositioned themselves high on the glacier and cut off that option. Behind him,the wide open sheet of ice fanned out into a two-mile-long plain that terminatedin a sheer drop to a frigid sea. Flight in that direction meant death byexposure. The practical barriers to fleeing notwithstanding, Tolland knew hecould not possibly leave the others. Norah and Corky were still out in the open,tethered to Rachel and Tolland.Tolland stayed down near Rachel as the ice pellets continued to slam into theside of the toppled equipment sled. He pillaged the strewn contents, searchingfor a weapon, a flare gun, a radio... anything.\"Run!\" Rachel yelled, her breathing still strained.Then, oddly, the hailstorm of ice bullets abruptly stopped. Even in the poundingwind, the night felt suddenly calm... as if a storm had let up unexpectedly.It was then, peering cautiously around the sled, that Tolland witnessed one ofthe most chilling sights he had ever seen.Gliding effortlessly out of the darkened perimeter into the light, three ghostlyfigures emerged, coasting silently in on skis. The figures wore full whiteweather suits. They carried no ski poles but rather large rifles that lookedlike no guns Tolland had ever seen. Their skis were bizarre as well, futuristicand short, more like elongated Rollerblades than skis.Calmly, as if knowing they had already won this battle, the figures coasted to astop beside their closest victim – the unconscious Norah Mangor. Tolland roseshakily to his knees and peered over the sled at the attackers. The visitorsstared back at him through eerie electronic goggles. They were apparentlyuninterested.At least for the moment.Delta-One felt no remorse as he stared down at the woman lying unconscious onthe ice before him. He had been trained to carry out orders, not to questionmotives.The woman was wearing a thick, black, thermal suit and had a welt on the side ofher face. Her breathing was short and labored. One of the IM ice rifles hadfound its mark and knocked her unconscious.Now it was time to finish the job.As Delta-One knelt down beside the oblivious woman, his teammates trained theirrifles on the other targets – one on the small, unconscious man lying on the icenearby, and one on the overturned sled where the two other victims were hiding.Although his men easily could have moved in to finish the job, the remainingthree victims were unarmed and had nowhere to run. Rushing to finish them alloff at once was careless. Never disperse your focus unless absolutely necessary.Face one adversary at a time. Exactly as they had been trained, the Delta Forcewould kill these people one at a time. The magic, however, was that they wouldleave no trace to suggest how they had died.Crouched beside the unconscious woman, Delta-One removed his thermal gloves andscooped up a handful of snow. Packing the snow, he opened the woman's mouth andbegan stuffing it down her throat. He filled her entire mouth, ramming the snowas deep as he could down her windpipe. She would be dead within three minutes.This technique, invented by the Russian mafia, was called the byelaya smert –white death. This victim would suffocate long before the snow in her throatmelted. Once dead, however, her body would stay warm long enough to dissolve theblockage. Even if foul play were suspected, no murder weapon or evidence ofviolence would be apparent immediately. Eventually someone might figure it out,but it would buy them time. The ice bullets would fade into the environment,buried in the snow, and the welt on this woman's head would look like she'dtaken a nasty spill on the ice – not surprising in these gale force winds.The other three people would be incapacitated and killed in much the same way.Then Delta-One would load all of them on the sled, drag them several hundredyards off course, reattached their belay lines and arrange the bodies. Hoursfrom now, the four of them would be found frozen in the snow, apparent victimsof overexposure and hypothermia. Those who discovered them would be puzzled whatthey were doing off course, but nobody would be surprised that they were dead.After all, their flares had burned out, the weather was perilous, and gettinglost on the Milne Ice Shelf could bring death in a hurry.Delta-One had now finished packing snow down the woman's throat. Before turninghis attention to the others, Delta-One unhooked the woman's belay harness. Hecould reconnect it later, but at the moment, he did not want the two peoplebehind the sled getting ideas about pulling his victim to safety.Michael Tolland had just witnessed a murderous act more bizarre than his darkestmind could imagine. Having cut Norah Mangor free, the three attackers wereturning their attention to Corky.I've got to do something!Corky had come to and was moaning, trying to sit up, but one of the soldierspushed him back down on his back, straddled him, and pinned Corky's arms to theice by kneeling on them. Corky let out a cry of pain that was instantlyswallowed up by the raging wind.In a kind of demented terror, Tolland tore through the scattered contents of theoverturned sled. There must be something here! A weapon! Something! All he sawwas diagnostic ice gear, most of it smashed beyond recognition by the icepellets. Beside him, Rachel groggily tried to sit up, using her ice ax to propherself up. \"Run... Mike...\"Tolland eyed the ax that was strapped to Rachel's wrist. It could be a weapon.Sort of. Tolland wondered what his chances were attacking three armed men with atiny ax.Suicide.As Rachel rolled and sat up, Tolland spied something behind her. A bulky vinylbag. Praying against fate that it contained a flare gun or radio, he clamberedpast her and grabbed the bag. Inside he found a large, neatly folded sheet ofMylar fabric. Worthless. Tolland had something similar on his research ship. Itwas a small weather balloon, designed to carry payloads of observational weathergear not much heavier than a personal computer. Norah's balloon would be no helphere, particularly without a helium tank.With the growing sounds of Corky's struggle, Tolland felt a helpless sensationhe had not felt in years. Total despair. Total loss. Like the cliché of one'slife passing before one's eyes before death, Tolland's mind flashed unexpectedlythrough long forgotten childhood images. For an instant he was sailing in SanPedro, learning the age-old sailor's pastime of spinnaker-flying – hanging on aknotted rope, suspended over the ocean, plunging laughing into the water, risingand falling like a kid hanging on a belfry rope, his fate determined by abillowing spinnaker sail and the whim of the ocean breeze.Tolland's eyes instantly snapped back to the Mylar balloon in his hand,realizing that his mind had not been surrendering, but rather it had been tryingto remind him of a solution! Spinnaker flying.Corky was still struggling against his captor as Tolland yanked open theprotective bag around the balloon. Tolland had no illusions that this plan wasanything other than a long shot, but he knew remaining here was certain deathfor all of them. He clutched the folded mass of Mylar. The payload clip warned:CAUTION: NOT FOR USE IN WINDS OVER 10 KNOTS.The hell with that! Gripping it hard to keep it from unfurling, Tollandclambered over to Rachel, who was propped on her side. He could see theconfusion in her eyes as he nestled close, yelling, \"Hold this!\"Tolland handed Rachel the folded pad of fabric and then used his free hands toslip the balloon's payload clasp through one of the carabiners on his harness.Then, rolling on his side, he slipped the clasp through one of Rachel'scarabiners as well.Tolland and Rachel were now one.Joined at the hip.From between them, the loose tether trailed off across the snow to thestruggling Corky... and ten yards farther to the empty clip beside Norah Mangor.Norah is already gone, Tolland told himself. Nothing you can do.The attackers were crouched over Corky's writhing body now, packing a handful ofsnow, and preparing to stuff it down Corky's throat. Tolland knew they werealmost out of time.Tolland grabbed the folded balloon from Rachel. The fabric was as light astissue paper – and virtually indestructible. Here goes nothing. \"Hold on!\"\"Mike?\" Rachel said. \"What –\"Tolland hurled the pad of wadded Mylar into the air over their heads. Thehowling wind snatched it up and spread it out like a parachute in a hurricane.The sheath filled instantly, billowing open with a loud snap.Tolland felt a wrenching yank on his harness, and he knew in an instant he hadgrossly underestimated the power of the katabatic wind. Within a fraction of asecond, he and Rachel were half airborne, being dragged down the glacier. Amoment later, Tolland felt a jerk as his tether drew taut on Corky Marlinson.Twenty yards back, his terrified friend was yanked out from under his stunnedattackers, sending one of them tumbling backward. Corky let out a blood-curdlingscream as he too accelerated across the ice, barely missing the overturned sled,then fishtailing inward. A second rope trailed limp beside Corky... the ropethat had been connected to Norah Mangor.Nothing you can do, Tolland told himself.Like a tangled mass of human marionettes, the three bodies skimmed down theglacier. Ice pellets went sailing by, but Tolland knew the attackers had missedtheir chance. Behind him, the white-clad soldiers faded away, shrinking toilluminated specks in the glow of the flares.Tolland now felt the ice ripping beneath his padded suit with relentlessacceleration, and the relief at having escaped faded fast. Less than two milesdirectly ahead of them, the Milne Ice Shelf came to an abrupt end at aprecipitous cliff – and beyond it... a hundred-foot drop to the lethal poundingsurf of the Arctic Ocean.52Marjorie Tench was smiling as she made her way downstairs toward the White HouseCommunications Office, the computerized broadcast facility that disseminatedpress releases formulated upstairs in the Communications Bullpen. The meetingwith Gabrielle Ashe had gone well. Whether or not Gabrielle was scared enough toturn over an affidavit admitting the affair was uncertain, but it sure as hellwas worth a try.Gabrielle would be smart to bail out on him, Tench thought. The poor girl had noidea just how hard Sexton was about to fall.In a few hours, the President's meteoric press conference was going to cutSexton down at the knees. That was in the bank. Gabrielle Ashe, if shecooperated, would be the death blow that sent Sexton crawling off in shame. Inthe morning, Tench could release Gabrielle's affidavit to the press along withfootage of Sexton denying it.One-two punch.After all, politics was not just about winning the election, it was aboutwinning decisively – having the momentum to carry out one's vision.Historically, any president who squeaked into office on a narrow marginaccomplished much less; he was weakened right out of the gate, and Congressnever seemed to let him forget it.Ideally, the destruction of Senator Sexton's campaign would be comprehensive – atwo-pronged attack sacking both his politics and his ethics. This strategy,known in Washington as the \"high-low,\" was stolen from the art of militarywarfare. Force the enemy to battle on two fronts. When a candidate possessed apiece of negative information about his opponent, he often waited until he had asecond piece and went public with both simultaneously. A double-edged attack wasalways more effective than a single shot, particularly when the dual attackincorporated separate aspects of his campaign – the first against his politics,the second against his character. Rebuttal of a political attack took logic,while rebuttal of a character attack took passion; disputing both simultaneouslywas an almost impossible balancing act.Tonight, Senator Sexton would find himself scrambling to extract himself fromthe political nightmare of an astounding NASA triumph, and yet his plight woulddeepen considerably if he were forced to defend his NASA position while beingcalled a liar by a prominent female member of his staff.Arriving now at the doorway of the Communications Office, Tench felt alive withthe thrill of the fight. Politics was war. She took a deep breath and checkedher watch. 6:15 P.M. The first shot was about to be fired.She entered.The Communications Office was small not for lack of room, but for lack ofnecessity. It was one of the most efficient mass communications stations in theworld and employed a staff of only five people. At the moment, all fiveemployees stood over their banks of electronic gear looking like swimmers poisedfor the starting gun.They are ready, Tench saw in their eager gazes.It always amazed her that this tiny office, given only two hours head start,could contact more than one third of the world's civilized population. Withelectronic connections to literally tens of thousands of global news sources –from the largest television conglomerates to the smallest hometown newspapers –the White House Communications Office could, at the touch of a few buttons,reach out and touch the world.Fax-broadcast computers churned press releases into the in-boxes of radio,television, print, and Internet media outlets from Maine to Moscow. Bulk e-mailprograms blanketed on-line news wires. Telephone autodialers phoned thousands ofmedia content managers and played recorded voice announcements. A breaking newsWeb page provided constant updates and preformatted content. The\"live-feed-capable\" news sources – CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, foreign syndicates –would be assaulted from all angles and promised free, live television feeds.Whatever else these networks were airing would come to a screeching halt for anemergency presidential address.Full penetration.Like a general inspecting her troops, Tench strode in silence over to the copydesk and picked up the printout of the \"flash release\" that now sat loaded inall the transmission machines like cartridges in a shotgun.When Tench read it, she had to laugh quietly to herself. By usual standards, therelease loaded for broadcast was heavy-handed – more of an advertisement than anannouncement – but the President had ordered the Communications Office to pullout all the stops. And that they had. This text was perfect – keyword-rich andcontent light. A deadly combination. Even the news wires that used automated\"keyword-sniffer\" programs to sort their incoming mail would see multiple flagson this one:From: White House Communications OfficeSubject: Urgent Presidential AddressThe President of the United States will be holding an urgent press conferencetonight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time from the White House briefing room.The topic of his announcement is currently classified. Live A/V feeds will beavailable via customary outlets.Laying the paper back down on the desk, Marjorie Tench looked around theCommunications Office and gave the staff an impressed nod. They looked eager.Lighting a cigarette, she puffed a moment, letting the anticipation build.Finally, she grinned. \"Ladies and gentlemen. Start your engines.\"53All logical reasoning had evaporated from Rachel Sexton's mind. She held nothoughts for the meteorite, the mysterious GPR printout in her pocket, Ming, thehorrific attack on the ice sheet. There was one matter at hand.Survival.The ice skimmed by in a blur beneath her like an endless, sleek highway. Whetherher body was numb with fear or simply cocooned by her protective suit, Racheldid not know, but she felt no pain. She felt nothing.Yet.Lying on her side, attached to Tolland at the waist, Rachel lay face-to-facewith him in an awkward embrace. Somewhere ahead of them, the balloon billowed,fat with wind, like a parachute on the back of a dragster. Corky trailed behind,swerving wildly like a tractor trailer out of control. The flare marking thespot where they had been attacked had all but disappeared in the distance.The hissing of their nylon Mark IX suits on the ice grew higher and higher inpitch as they continued to accelerate. She had no idea how fast they were goingnow, but the wind was at least sixty miles an hour, and the frictionless runwaybeneath them seemed to be racing by faster and faster with every passing second.The impervious Mylar balloon apparently had no intentions of tearing orrelinquishing its hold.We need to release, she thought. They were racing away from one deadly force –directly toward another. The ocean is probably less than a mile ahead now! Thethought of icy water brought back terrifying memories.The wind gusted harder, and their speed increased. Somewhere behind them Corkylet out a scream of terror. At this speed, Rachel knew they had only a fewminutes before they were dragged out over the cliff into the frigid ocean.Tolland was apparently having similar thoughts because he was now fighting withthe payload clasp attached to their bodies.\"I can't unhook us!\" he yelled. \"There's too much tension!\"Rachel hoped a momentary lull in the wind might give Tolland some slack, but thekatabatic pulled on with relentless uniformity. Trying to help, Rachel twistedher body and rammed the toe cleat of one of her crampons into the ice, sending arooster tail of ice shards into the air. Their velocity slowed ever so slightly.\"Now!\" she yelled, lifting her foot.For an instant the payload line on the balloon slackened slightly. Tollandyanked down, trying to take advantage of the loose line to maneuver the payloadclip out of their carabiners. Not even close.\"Again!\" he yelled.This time they both twisted against one another and rammed their toe prongs intothe ice, sending a double plume of ice into the air. This slowed the contraptionmore perceptibly.\"Now!\"On Tolland's cue, they both let up. As the balloon surged forward again, Tollandrammed his thumb into the carabiner latch and twisted the hook, trying torelease the clasp. Although closer this time, he still needed more slack. Thecarabiners, Norah had bragged, were first-rate, Joker safety clips, specificallycrafted with an extra loop in the metal so they would never release if therewere any tension on them at all.Killed by safety clips, Rachel thought, not finding the irony the least bitamusing.\"One more time!\" Tolland yelled.Mustering all her energy and hope, Rachel twisted as far as she could and rammedboth of her toes into the ice. Arching her back, she tried to lift all herweight onto her toes. Tolland followed her lead until they were both angledroughly on their stomachs, the connection at their belt straining theirharnesses. Tolland rammed his toes down and Rachel arched farther. Thevibrations sent shock waves up her legs. She felt like her ankles were going tobreak.\"Hold it... hold it...\" Tolland contorted himself to release the Joker clip astheir speed decreased. \"Almost...\"Rachel's crampons snapped. The metal cleats tore off of her boots and wenttumbling backward into the night, bouncing over Corky. The balloon immediatelylurched forward, sending Rachel and Tolland fishtailing to one side. Tollandlost his grasp on the clip.\"Shit!\"The Mylar balloon, as if angered at having been momentarily restrained, lurchedforward now, pulling even harder, dragging them down the glacier toward the sea.Rachel knew they were closing fast on the cliff, although they faced danger evenbefore the hundred-foot drop into the Arctic Ocean. Three huge snow berms stoodin their path. Even protected by the padding in the Mark IX suits, theexperience of launching at high speed up and over the snow mounds filled herwith terror.Fighting in desperation with their harnesses, Rachel tried to find a way torelease the balloon. It was then that she heard the rhythmic ticking on the ice– the rapid-fire staccato of lightweight metal on the sheet of bare ice.The ax.In her fear, she had entirely forgotten the ice ax attached to the rip cord onher belt. The lightweight aluminum tool was bouncing along beside her leg. Shelooked up at the payload cable on the balloon. Thick, heavy-duty braided nylon.Reaching down, she fumbled for the bouncing ax. She grasped the handle andpulled it toward her, stretching the elastic rip cord. Still on her side, Rachelstruggled to raise her arms over her head, placing the ax's serrated edgeagainst the thick cord. Awkwardly, she began sawing the taut cable.\"Yes!\" Tolland yelled, fumbling now for his own ax.Sliding on her side, Rachel was stretched out, her arms above her, sawing at thetaut cable. The line was strong, and the individual nylon strands were frayingslowly. Tolland gripped his own ax, twisted, raised his arms over his head, andtried to saw from underneath in the same spot. Their banana blades clickedtogether as they worked in tandem like lumberjacks. The rope began fraying onboth sides now.We're going to do it, Rachel thought. This thing is going to break!Suddenly, the silver bubble of Mylar before them swooped upward as if it had hitan updraft. Rachel realized to her horror that it was simply following thecontour of the land.They had arrived.The berms.The wall of white loomed only an instant before they were on it. The blow toRachel's side as they hit the incline drove the wind from her lungs and wrenchedthe ax from her hand. Like a tangled water-skier being dragged up over a jump,Rachel felt her body dragged up the face of the berm and launched. She andTolland were suddenly catapulted in a dizzying upward snarl. The trough betweenthe berms spread out far beneath them, but the frayed payload cable held fast,lifting their accelerated bodies upward, carrying them clear out over the firsttrough. For an instant, she glimpsed what lay ahead. Two more berms – a shortplateau – and then the drop-off to the sea.As if to give a voice to Rachel's own dumbstruck terror, the high-pitched screamof Corky Marlinson cut through the air. Somewhere behind them, he sailed up overthe first berm. All three of them went airborne, the balloon clawing upward likea wild animal trying to break its captor's chains.Suddenly, like a gunshot in the night, a sudden snap echoed overhead. The frayedrope gave way, and the tattered end recoiled in Rachel's face. Instantly, theywere falling. Somewhere overhead the Mylar balloon billowed out of control...spiraling out to sea.Tangled in carabiners and harnesses, Rachel and Tolland tumbled back towardearth. As the white mound of the second berm rose up toward them, Rachel bracedfor impact. Barely clearing the top of the second berm, they crashed down thefar side, the blow partially cushioned by their suits and the descending contourof the berm. As the world around her turned into a blur of arms and legs andice, Rachel felt herself rocketing down the incline out onto the central icetrough. Instinctively she spread her arms and legs, trying to slow down beforethey hit the next berm. She felt them slowing, but only slightly, and it seemedonly seconds before she and Tolland were sliding back up an incline. At the top,there was another instant of weightlessness as they cleared the crest. Then,filled with terror, Rachel felt them begin their dead slide down the other sideand out onto the final plateau... the last eighty feet of the Milne Glacier.As they skidded toward the cliff, Rachel could feel the drag of Corky on thetether, and she knew they were all slowing down. She knew it was too little toolate. The end of the glacier raced toward them, and Rachel let out a helplessscream.Then it happened.The edge of the ice slid out from underneath them. The last thing Rachelremembered was falling.54The Westbrooke Place Apartments are located at 2201 N Street NW and promotethemselves as one of the few unquestionably correct addresses in Washington.Gabrielle hurried through the gilded revolving door into the marble lobby, wherea deafening waterfall reverberated.The doorman at the front desk looked surprised to see her. \"Ms. Ashe? I didn'tknow you were stopping by tonight.\"\"I'm running late.\" Gabrielle quickly signed in. The clock overhead read 6:22P.M.The doorman scratched his head. \"The senator gave me a list, but you weren't –\"\"They always forget the people who help them most.\" She gave a harried smile andstrode past him toward the elevator.Now the doorman looked uneasy. \"I better call up.\"\"Thanks,\" Gabrielle said, as she boarded the elevator and headed up. Thesenator's phone is off the hook.Riding the elevator to the ninth floor, Gabrielle exited and made her way downthe elegant hallway. At the end, outside Sexton's doorway, she could see one ofhis bulky personal safety escorts – glorified bodyguards – sitting in the hall.He looked bored. Gabrielle was surprised to see security on duty, althoughapparently not as surprised as the guard was to see her. He jumped to his feetas she approached.\"I know,\" Gabrielle called out, still halfway down the hall. \"It's a P.E. night.He doesn't want to be disturbed.\"The guard nodded emphatically. \"He gave me very strict orders that no visitors–\"\"It's an emergency.\"The guard physically blocked the doorway. \"He's in a private meeting.\"\"Really?\" Gabrielle pulled the red envelope from under her arm. She flashed theWhite House seal in the man's face. \"I was just in the Oval Office. I need togive the senator this information. Whatever old pals he's schmoozing tonight aregoing to have to do without him for a few minutes. Now, let me in.\"The guard withered slightly at the sight of the White House seal on theenvelope.Don't make me open this, Gabrielle thought.\"Leave the folder,\" he said. \"I'll take it into him.\"\"The hell you will. I have direct orders from the White House to hand-deliverthis. If I don't talk to him immediately, we can all start looking for jobstomorrow morning. Do you understand?\"The guard looked deeply conflicted, and Gabrielle sensed the senator had indeedbeen unusually adamant tonight about having no visitors. She moved in for thekill. Holding the White House envelope directly in his face, Gabrielle loweredher voice to a whisper and uttered the six words all Washington securitypersonnel feared most.\"You do not understand the situation.\"Security personnel for politicians never understood the situation, and theyhated that fact. They were hired guns, kept in the dark, never sure whether tostand firm in their orders or risk losing their jobs by mule-headedly ignoringsome obvious crisis.The guard swallowed hard, eyeing the White House envelope again. \"Okay, but I'mtelling the senator you demanded to be let in.\"He unlocked the door, and Gabrielle pushed past him before he changed his mind.She entered the apartment and quietly closed the door behind her, relocking it.Now inside the foyer, Gabrielle could hear muffled voices in Sexton's den downthe hall – men's voices. Tonight's P.E. was obviously not the private meetingimplied by Sexton's earlier call.As Gabrielle moved down the hall toward the den, she passed an open closet wherea half dozen expensive men's coats hung inside – distinctive wool and tweed.Several briefcases sat on the floor. Apparently work stayed in the hall tonight.Gabrielle would have walked right past the cases except that one of thebriefcases caught her eye. The nameplate bore a distinctive company logo. Abright red rocket.She paused, kneeling down to read it:SPACE AMERICA, INC.Puzzled, she examined the other briefcases.BEAL AEROSPACE. MICROCOSM, INC. ROTARY ROCKET COMPANY. KISTLER AEROSPACE.Marjorie Tench's raspy voice echoed in her mind. Are you aware that Sexton isaccepting bribes from private aerospace companies?Gabrielle's pulse began racing as she gazed down the darkened hallway toward thearchway that led into the senator's den. She knew she should speak up, announceher presence, and yet she felt herself inching quietly forward. She moved towithin a few feet of the archway and stood soundlessly in the shadows...listening to the conversation beyond.55While Delta-Three stayed behind to collect Norah Mangor's body and the sled, theother two soldiers accelerated down the glacier after their quarry.On their feet they wore ElektroTread–powered skis. Modeled after the consumerFast Trax motorized skis, the classified ElektroTreads were essentially snowskis with miniaturized tank treads affixed – like snowmobiles worn on the feet.Speed was controlled by pushing the tips of the index finger and thumb together,compressing two pressure plates inside the right-hand glove. A powerful gelbattery was molded around the foot, doubling as insulation and allowing the skisto run silently. Ingeniously, the kinetic energy generated by gravity and thespinning treads as the wearer glided down a hill was automatically harvested torecharge the batteries for the next incline.Keeping the wind at his back, Delta-One crouched low, skimming seaward as hesurveyed the glacier before him. His night vision system was a far cry from thePatriot model used by the Marines. Delta-One was looking through a hands-freeface mount with a 40 x 90 mm six-element lens, three-element MagnificationDoubler, and Super Long Range IR. The world outside appeared in a translucenttint of cool blue, rather than the usual green – the color scheme especiallydesigned for highly reflective terrains like the Arctic.As he approached the first berm, Delta-One's goggles revealed several brightstripes of freshly disturbed snow, rising up and over the berm like a neon arrowin the night. Apparently the three escapees had either not thought to unhooktheir makeshift sail or had been unable to. Either way, if they had not releasedby the final berm, they were now somewhere out in the ocean. Delta-One knew hisquarry's protective clothing would lengthen the usual life expectancy in thewater, but the relentless offshore currents would drag them out to sea. Drowningwould be inevitable.Despite his confidence, Delta-One had been trained never to assume. He needed tosee bodies. Crouching low, he pressed his fingers together and accelerated upthe first incline.• • •Michael Tolland lay motionless, taking stock of his bruises. He was battered,but he sensed no broken bones. He had little doubt the gel-filled Mark IX hadsaved him any substantial trauma. As he opened his eyes, his thoughts were slowto focus. Everything seemed softer here... quieter. The wind still howled, butwith less ferocity.We went over the edge – didn't we?Focusing, Tolland found he was lying on ice, draped across Rachel Sexton, almostat right angles, their locked carabiners twisted. He could feel her breathingbeneath him, but he could not see her face. He rolled off her, his musclesbarely responding.\"Rachel...?\" Tolland wasn't sure if his lips were making sound or not.Tolland recalled the final seconds of their harrowing ride – the upward drag ofthe balloon, the payload cable snapping, their bodies plummeting down the farside of the berm, sliding up and over the final mound, skimming toward the edge– the ice running out. Tolland and Rachel had fallen, but the fall had beenoddly short. Rather than the expected plunge to the sea, they had fallen onlyten feet or so before hitting another slab of ice and sliding to a stop with thedead weight of Corky in tow.Now, raising his head, Tolland looked toward the sea. Not far away, the iceended in a sheer cliff, beyond which he could hear the sounds of the ocean.Looking back up the glacier, Tolland strained to see into the night. Twentyyards back, his eyes met a high wall of ice, which seemed to hang above them. Itwas then that he realized what had happened. Somehow they had slid off the mainglacier onto a lower terrace of ice. This section was flat, as large as a hockeyrink, and had partially collapsed – preparing to cleave off into the ocean atany moment.Ice calving, Tolland thought, eyeing the precarious platform of ice on which hewas now lying. It was a broad square slab that hung off the glacier like acolossal balcony, surrounded on three sides by precipices to the ocean. Thesheet of ice was attached to the glacier only at its back, and Tolland could seethe connection was anything but permanent. The boundary where the lower terraceclung to the Milne Ice Shelf was marked by a gaping pressure fissure almost fourfeet across. Gravity was well on its way to winning this battle.Almost more frightening than seeing the fissure was Tolland's seeing themotionless body of Corky Marlinson crumpled on the ice. Corky lay ten yards awayat the end of a taut tether attached to them.Tolland tried to stand up, but he was still attached to Rachel. Repositioninghimself, he began detaching their interlocking carabiners.Rachel looked weak as she tried to sit up. \"We didn't... go over?\" Her voice wasbewildered.\"We fell onto a lower block of ice,\" Tolland said, finally unfastening himselffrom her. \"I've got to help Corky.\"Painfully, Tolland attempted to stand, but his legs felt feeble. He grabbed thetether and heaved. Corky began sliding toward them across the ice. After a dozenor so pulls, Corky was lying on the ice a few feet away.Corky Marlinson looked beaten. He'd lost his goggles, suffered a bad cut on hischeek, and his nose was bleeding. Tolland's worries that Corky might be deadwere quickly allayed when Corky rolled over and looked at Tolland with an angryglare.\"Jesus,\" he stammered. \"What the hell was that little trick!\"Tolland felt a wave of relief.Rachel sat up now, wincing. She looked around. \"We need to... get off of here.This block of ice looks like it's about to fall.\"Tolland couldn't have agreed more. The only question was how.They had no time to consider a solution. A familiar high-pitched whir becameaudible above them on the glacier. Tolland's gaze shot up to see two white-cladfigures ski effortlessly up onto the edge and stop in unison. The two men stoodthere a moment, peering down at their battered prey like chess masters savoringcheckmate before the final kill.Delta-One was surprised to see the three escapees alive. He knew, however, thiswas a temporary condition. They had fallen onto a section of the glacier thathad already begun its inevitable plunge to the sea. This quarry could bedisabled and killed in the same manner as the other woman, but a far cleanersolution had just presented itself. A way in which no bodies would ever befound.Gazing downward over the lip, Delta-One focused on the gaping crevasse that hadbegun to spread like a wedge between the ice shelf and the clinging block ofice. The section of ice on which the three fugitives sat was dangerouslyperched... ready to break away and fall into the ocean any day now.Why not today...Here on the ice shelf, the night was rocked every few hours by deafening booms –the sound of ice cracking off parts of the glacier and plummeting into theocean. Who would take notice?Feeling the familiar warm rush of adrenaline that accompanied the preparationfor a kill, Delta-One reached in his supply pack and pulled out a heavy,lemon-shaped object. Standard issue for military assault teams, the object wascalled a flash-bang – a \"nonlethal\" concussion grenade that temporarilydisoriented an enemy by generating a blinding flash and deafening concussionwave. Tonight, however, Delta-One knew this flash-bang would most certainly belethal.He positioned himself near the edge and wondered how far the crevasse descendedbefore tapering to a close. Twenty feet? Fifty feet? He knew it didn't matter.His plan would be effective regardless.With calm bred from the performance of countless executions, Delta-One dialed aten-second delay into the grenade's screw-dial, slid out the pin, and threw thegrenade down into the chasm. The bomb plummeted into the darkness anddisappeared.Then Delta-One and his partner cleared back up onto the top of the berm andwaited. This would be a sight to behold.Even in her delirious state of mind, Rachel Sexton had a very good idea what theattackers had just dropped into the crevasse. Whether Michael Tolland also knewor whether he was reading the fear in her eyes was unclear, but she saw him gopale, shooting a horrified glance down at the mammoth slab of ice on which theywere stranded, clearly realizing the inevitable.Like a storm cloud lit by an internal flash of lightning, the ice beneath Rachelilluminated from within. The eerie white translucence shot out in alldirections. For a hundred yards around them, the glacier flashed white. Theconcussion came next. Not a rumble like an earthquake, but a deafening shockwave of gut-churning force. Rachel felt the impact tearing up through the iceinto her body.Instantly, as if a wedge had been driven between the ice shelf and the block ofice supporting them, the cliff began to shear off with a sickening crack.Rachel's eyes locked with Tolland's in a freeze-frame of terror. Corky let out ascream nearby.The bottom dropped out.Rachel felt weightless for an instant, hovering over the multimillion-poundblock of ice. Then they were riding the iceberg down – plummeting into thefrigid sea.56The deafening grating of ice against ice assaulted Rachel's ears as the massiveslab slid down the face of the Milne Ice Shelf, sending towering plumes of sprayinto the air. As the slab splashed downward, it slowed, and Rachel's previouslyweightless body crashed down onto the top of the ice. Tolland and Corky landedhard nearby.As the block's downward momentum plunged it deeper into the sea, Rachel couldsee the foaming surface of the ocean racing upward with a kind of tauntingdeceleration, like the ground beneath a bungee-jumper whose cord was a few feettoo long. Rising... rising... and then it was there. Her childhood nightmare wasback. The ice... the water... the darkness. The dread was almost primal.The top of the slab slipped below the waterline, and the frigid Arctic Oceanpoured over the edges in a torrent. As the ocean rushed in all around her,Rachel felt herself sucked under. The bare skin on her face tightened and burnedas the saltwater hit. The flooring of ice disappeared beneath her, and Rachelfought her way back to the surface, buoyed by the gel in her suit. She took in amouthful of saltwater, sputtering to the surface. She could see the othersfloundering nearby, all of them tangled in tethers. Just as Rachel rightedherself, Tolland yelled out.\"It's coming back up!\"As his words echoed above the tumult, Rachel felt an eerie upwelling in thewater beneath her. Like a massive locomotive straining to reverse direction, theslab of ice had groaned to a stop underwater and was now beginning its ascentdirectly beneath them. Fathoms below, a sickening low frequency rumble resonatedupward through the water as the gigantic submerged sheet began scraping its wayback up the face of the glacier.The slab rose fast, accelerating as it came, swooping up from the darkness.Rachel felt herself rising. The ocean roiled all around as the ice met her body.She scrambled in vain, trying to find her balance as the ice propelled herskyward along with millions of gallons of seawater. Buoying upward, the giantsheet bobbed above the surface, heaving and teetering, looking for its center ofgravity. Rachel found herself scrambling in waist-deep water across theenormous, flat expanse. As the water began pouring off the surface, the currentswallowed Rachel and dragged her toward the edge. Sliding, splayed flat on herstomach, Rachel could see the edge looming fast.Hold on! Rachel's mother's voice was calling the same way it had when Rachel wasjust a child floundering beneath the icy pond. Hold on! Don't go under!The wrenching yank on her harness expelled what little air Rachel had left inher lungs. She jerked to a dead stop only yards from the edge. The motion spunher in place. Ten yards away, she could see Corky's limp body, still tethered toher, also jolting to a stop. They had been flowing off the sheet in oppositedirections and his momentum had stopped her. As the water ran off and grew moreshallow, another dark form appeared over near Corky. He was on his hands andknees, grasping Corky's tether and vomiting saltwater.Michael Tolland.As the last of the wake drained past her and flowed off the iceberg, Rachel layin terrified silence, listening to the sounds of the ocean. Then, feeling theonset of deadly cold, she dragged herself onto her hands and knees. The 'bergwas still bobbing back and forth, like a giant ice cube. Delirious and in pain,she crawled back toward the others.High above on the glacier, Delta-One peered through his night-vision goggles atthe water churning around the Arctic Ocean's newest tabular iceberg. Although hesaw no bodies in the water, he was not surprised. The ocean was dark, and hisquarry's weather suits and skullcaps were black.As he passed his gaze across the surface of the enormous floating sheet of ice,he had a hard time keeping it in focus. It was receding quickly, already headingout to sea in the strong offshore currents. He was about to turn his gaze backto the sea when he saw something unexpected. Three specks of black on the ice.Are those bodies? Delta-One tried to bring them into focus.\"See something?\" Delta-Two asked.Delta-One said nothing, focusing in with his magnifier. In the pale tint of theiceberg, he was stunned to see three human forms huddled motionless on theisland of ice. Whether they were alive or dead, Delta-One had no idea. It hardlymattered. If they were alive, even in weather suits, they'd be dead within thehour; they were wet, a storm was coming in, and they were drifting seaward intoone of the most deadly oceans on the planet. Their bodies would never be found.\"Just shadows,\" Delta-One said, turning from the cliff. \"Let's get back tobase.\"57Senator Sedgewick Sexton set his snifter of Courvoisier on the mantelpiece ofhis Westbrook apartment and stoked the fire for several moments, gathering histhoughts. The six men in the den with him sat in silence now... waiting. Thesmall talk was over. It was time for Senator Sexton to make his pitch. They knewit. He knew it.Politics was sales.Establish trust. Let them know you understand their problems.\"As you may know,\" Sexton said, turning toward them, \"over the past months, Ihave met with many men in your same position.\" He smiled and sat down, joiningthem on their level. \"You are the only ones I have ever brought into my home.You are extraordinary men, and I am honored to meet you.\"Sexton folded his hands and let his eyes circle the room, making personalcontact with each of his guests. Then he focused in on his first mark – theheavyset man in the cowboy hat.\"Space Industries of Houston,\" Sexton said. \"I'm glad you came.\"The Texan grunted. \"I hate this town.\"\"I don't blame you. Washington has been unfair to you.\"The Texan stared out from beneath the rim of his hat but said nothing.\"Twelve years back,\" Sexton began, \"you made an offer to the U.S. government.You proposed to build them a U.S. space station for a mere five billiondollars.\"\"Yeah, I did. I still have the blueprints.\"\"And yet NASA convinced the government that a U.S. space station should be aNASA project.\"\"Right. NASA started building almost a decade ago.\"\"A decade. And not only is the NASA space station not yet fully operational, butthe project so far has cost twenty times your bid. As an American taxpayer, I amsickened.\"A grumble of agreement circled the room. Sexton let his eyes move, reconnectingwith the group.\"I am well aware,\" the senator said, addressing everyone now, \"that several ofyour companies have offered to launch private space shuttles for as little asfifty million dollars per flight.\"More nods.\"And yet NASA undercuts you by charging only thirty-eight million dollars perflight... even though their actual per flight cost is over one hundred and fiftymillion dollars!\"\"It's how they keep us out of space,\" one of the men said. \"The private sectorcannot possibly compete with a company that can afford to run shuttle flights ata four hundred percent loss and still stay in business.\"\"Nor should you have to,\" Sexton said.Nods all around.Sexton turned now to the austere entrepreneur beside him, a man whose fileSexton had read with interest. Like many of the entrepreneurs funding Sexton'scampaign, this man was a former military engineer who had become disillusionedwith low wages and government bureaucracy and had abandoned his military post toseek his fortune in aerospace.\"Kistler Aerospace,\" Sexton said, shaking his head in despair. \"Your company hasdesigned and manufactured a rocket that can launch payloads for as little as twothousand dollars per pound compared to NASA's costs of ten thousand dollars perpound.\" Sexton paused for effect. \"And yet you have no clients.\"\"Why would I have any clients?\" the man replied. \"Last week NASA undercut us bycharging Motorola only eight hundred and twelve dollars per pound to launch atelecomm satellite. The government launched that satellite at a nine hundredpercent loss!\"Sexton nodded. Taxpayers were unwittingly subsidizing an agency that was tentimes less efficient than its competition. \"It has become painfully clear,\" hesaid, his voice darkening, \"that NASA is working very hard to stifle competitionin space. They crowd out private aerospace businesses by pricing services belowmarket value.\"\"It's the Wal-Marting of space,\" the Texan said.Damn good analogy, Sexton thought. I'll have to remember that. Wal-Mart wasnotorious for moving into a new territory, selling products below market value,and driving all local competition out of business.\"I'm goddamned sick and tired,\" the Texan said, \"of having to pay millions inbusiness taxes so Uncle Sam can use that money to steal my clients!\"\"I hear you,\" Sexton said. \"I understand.\"\"It's the lack of corporate sponsorships that's killing Rotary Rocket,\" asharply dressed man said. \"The laws against sponsorship are criminal!\"\"I couldn't agree more.\" Sexton had been shocked to learn that another way NASAentrenched its monopoly of space was by passing federal mandates banningadvertisements on space vehicles. Instead of allowing private companies tosecure funding through corporate sponsorships and advertising logos – the way,for example, professional race car drivers did – space vehicles could onlydisplay the words USA and the company name. In a country that spent $185 billiona year on advertising, not one advertising dollar ever found its way into thecoffers of private space companies.\"It's robbery,\" one of the men snapped. \"My company hopes to stay in businesslong enough to launch the country's first tourist-shuttle prototype next May. Weexpect enormous press coverage. The Nike Corporation just offered us sevenmillion in sponsorship dollars to paint the Nike swoosh and 'Just do it!' on theside of the shuttle. Pepsi offered us twice that for 'Pepsi: The choice of a newgeneration.' But according to federal law, if our shuttle displays advertising,we are prohibited from launching it!\"\"That's right,\" Senator Sexton said. \"And if elected, I will work to abolishthat antisponsorship legislation. That is a promise. Space should be open foradvertising the way every square inch of earth is open to advertising.\"Sexton gazed out now at his audience, his eyes locking in, his voice growingsolemn. \"We all need to be aware, however, that the biggest obstacle toprivatization of NASA is not laws, but rather, it is public perception. MostAmericans still hold a romanticized view of the American space program. Theystill believe NASA is a necessary government agency.\"\"It's those goddamned Hollywood movies!\" one man said. \"How manyNASA-saves-the-world-from-a-killer-asteroid movies can Hollywood make, forChrist's sake? It's propaganda!\"The plethora of NASA movies coming out of Hollywood, Sexton knew, was simply amatter of economics. Following the wildly popular movie Top Gun – a Tom Cruisejet pilot blockbuster that played like a two-hour advertisement for the U.S.Navy – NASA realized the true potential of Hollywood as a public relationspowerhouse. NASA quietly began offering film companies free filming access toall of NASA's dramatic facilities – launchpads, mission control, trainingfacilities. Producers, who were accustomed to paying enormous on-site licensingfees when they filmed anywhere else, jumped at the opportunity to save millionsin budget costs by making NASA thrillers on \"free\" sets. Of course, Hollywoodonly got access if NASA approved the script.\"Public brainwashing,\" a Hispanic grunted. \"The movies aren't half as bad as thepublicity stunts. Sending a senior citizen into space? And now NASA is planningan all-female shuttle crew? All for publicity!\"Sexton sighed, his tone turning tragic. \"True, and I know I don't have to remindyou what happened back in the eighties when the Department of Education wasbankrupt and cited NASA as wasting millions that could be spent on education.NASA devised a PR stunt to prove NASA was education-friendly. They sent a publicschool teacher into space.\" Sexton paused. \"You all remember Christa McAuliffe.\"The room fell silent.\"Gentlemen,\" Sexton said, stopping dramatically in front of the fire. \"I believeit is time Americans understood the truth, for the good of all of our futures.It's time Americans understand that NASA is not leading us skyward, but ratheris stifling space exploration. Space is no different than any other industry,and keeping the private sector grounded verges on a criminal act. Consider thecomputer industry, in which we see such an explosion of progress that we canbarely keep up from week to week! Why? Because the computer industry is afree-market system: It rewards efficiency and vision with profits. Imagine ifthe computer industry were government-run? We would still be in the dark ages.We're stagnating in space. We should put space exploration into the hands of theprivate sector where it belongs. Americans would be stunned by the growth, jobs,and realized dreams. I believe we should let the free-market system spur us tonew heights in space. If elected, I will make it my personal mission to unlockthe doors to the final frontier and let them swing wide open.\"Sexton lifted his snifter of cognac.\"My friends, you came here tonight to decide if I am someone worthy of yourtrust. I hope I am on the way to earning it. In the same way it takes investorsto build a company, it takes investors to build a presidency. In the same waycorporate stockholders expect returns, you as political investors expectreturns. My message to you tonight is simple: Invest in me, and I will neverforget you. Ever. Our missions are one and the same.\"Sexton extended his glass toward them in a toast.\"With your help, my friends, soon I will be in the White House... and you willall be launching your dreams.\"Only fifteen feet away, Gabrielle Ashe stood in the shadows, rigid. From the dencame the harmonious clink of crystal snifters and the crackle of the fire.58In a panic, the young NASA technician dashed through the habisphere. Somethingterrible has happened! He found Administrator Ekstrom alone near the press area.\"Sir,\" the technician gasped, running up. \"There's been an accident!\"Ekstrom turned, looking distant, as if his thoughts were already deeply troubledwith other matters. \"What did you say? An accident? Where?\"\"In the extraction pit. A body just floated up. Dr. Wailee Ming.\"Ekstrom's face was blank. \"Dr. Ming? But...\"\"We pulled him out, but it was too late. He's dead.\"\"For Christ's sake. How long has he been in there?\"\"We think about an hour. It looks like he fell in, sank to the bottom, but whenhis body bloated, he floated up again.\"Ekstrom's reddish skin turned crimson. \"Goddamn it! Who else knows about this?\"\"Nobody, sir. Only two of us. We fished him out, but we thought we better tellyou before –\"\"You did the right thing.\" Ekstrom exhaled a weighty sigh. \"Stow Dr. Ming's bodyimmediately. Say nothing.\"The technician felt perplexed. \"But, sir, I –\"Ekstrom put a large hand on the man's shoulder. \"Listen to me carefully. This isa tragic accident, one I deeply regret. Of course I will deal with itappropriately when the time comes. Now, however, is not the time.\"\"You want me to hide his body?\"Ekstrom's cold Nordic eyes bore down. \"Think about it. We could tell everyone,but what would that accomplish? We're about an hour off from this pressconference. Announcing that we've had a fatal accident would overshadow thediscovery and have a devastating effect on morale. Dr. Ming made a carelessmistake; I have no intention of making NASA pay for it. These civilianscientists have taken enough of the spotlight without my letting one of theirslipshod errors cast a shadow over our public moment of glory. Dr. Ming'saccident remains a secret until after the press conference. Do you understand?\"The man nodded, pale. \"I'll stow his body.\"59Michael Tolland had been at sea enough times to know the ocean took victimswithout remorse or hesitation. As he lay in exhaustion on the expansive sheet ofice, he could just make out the ghostly outline of the towering Milne Ice Shelfreceding in the distance. He knew the powerful Arctic current flowing off theElizabethan Islands spiraled in an enormous loop around the polar ice cap andwould eventually skirt land in northern Russia. Not that it mattered. That wouldbe months from now.We've got maybe thirty minutes... forty-five at the most.Without the protective insulation of their gel-filled suits, Tolland knew theywould be dead already. Thankfully, the Mark IXs had kept them dry – the mostcritical aspect of surviving cold weather. The thermal gel around their bodieshad not only cushioned their fall, but it was now helping their bodies retainwhat little heat they had left.Soon hypothermia would set in. It would start with a vague numbness in limbs asthe blood retreated to the body's core to protect the critical internal organs.Delirious hallucinations would come next, as the pulse and respiration slowed,cheating the brain of oxygen. Then, the body would make a final effort toconserve its remaining heat by shutting down all operations except the heart andrespiration. Unconsciousness would follow. In the end, heart and respirationcenters in the brain would stop functioning altogether.Tolland turned his gaze toward Rachel, wishing he could do something to saveher.The numbness spreading through Rachel Sexton's body was less painful than shewould have imagined. Almost a welcome anesthetic. Nature's morphine. She hadlost her goggles in the collapse, and she could barely open her eyes against thecold.She could see Tolland and Corky on the ice nearby. Tolland was looking at her,eyes filled with regret. Corky was moving but obviously in pain. His rightcheekbone was smashed and bloody.Rachel's body trembled wildly as her mind searched for answers. Who? Why? Herthoughts were muddled by a growing heaviness inside her. Nothing was makingsense. She felt like her body was slowly shutting down, lulled by an invisibleforce pulling her to sleep. She fought it. A fiery anger ignited within her now,and she tried to fan the flames.They tried to kill us! She peered out at the threatening sea and sensed theirattackers had succeeded. We're already dead. Even now, knowing she wouldprobably not live to learn the whole truth about the deadly game being playedout on the Milne Ice Shelf, Rachel suspected she already knew who to blame.Administrator Ekstrom had the most to gain. He was the one who sent them out onthe ice. He had ties to the Pentagon and Special Ops. But what did Ekstrom haveto gain by inserting the meteorite beneath the ice? What did anyone have togain?Rachel flashed on Zach Herney, wondering if the President was a coconspirator oran unknowing pawn? Herney knows nothing. He's innocent. The President obviouslyhad been duped by NASA. Now Herney was only about an hour away from makingNASA's announcement. And he would do so armed with a video documentarycontaining endorsements from four civilian scientists.Four dead civilian scientists.Rachel could do nothing to stop the press conference now, but she vowed thatwhoever was responsible for this attack would not get away with it.Summoning her strength, Rachel tried to sit up. Her limbs felt like granite, allher joints screaming in pain as she bent her legs and arms. Slowly, she pulledherself to her knees, steadying herself on the flat ice. Her head spun. Allaround her the ocean churned. Tolland lay nearby, gazing up at her withinquisitive eyes. Rachel sensed he probably thought she was kneeling in prayer.She was not, of course, although prayer probably had as good a chance of savingthem as what she was about to attempt.Rachel's right hand fumbled across her waist and found the ice ax still bungeedto her belt. Her stiff fingers gripped the handle. She inverted the ax,positioning it like an upside down T. Then, with all her energy, she drove thebutt downward into the ice. Thud. Again. Thud. The blood felt like cold molassesin her veins. Thud. Tolland looked on in obvious confusion. Rachel drove the axdown again. Thud.Tolland tried to lift himself onto his elbow. \"Ra... chel?\"She did not answer. She needed all her energy. Thud. Thud.\"I don't think...,\" Tolland said, \"this far north... that the SAA... couldhear...\"Rachel turned, surprised. She had forgotten Tolland was an oceanographer andmight have some idea what she was up to. Right idea... but I'm not calling theSAA.She kept pounding.The SAA stood for a Suboceanic Acoustic Array, a relic of the Cold War now usedby oceanographers worldwide to listen for whales. Because underwater soundscarried for hundreds of miles, the SAA network of fifty-nine underwatermicrophones around the world could listen to a surprisingly large percentage ofthe planet's oceans. Unfortunately, this remote section of the Arctic was notpart of that percentage, but Rachel knew there were others out there listeningto the ocean floor – others that few on earth knew existed. She kept pounding.Her message was simple and clear.THUD. THUD. THUD.THUD... THUD... THUD...THUD. THUD. THUD.Rachel had no delusions that her actions would save their lives; she couldalready feel a frosty tightness gripping her body. She doubted she had a halfhour of life left in her. Rescue was beyond the realm of possibility now. Butthis was not about rescue.THUD. THUD. THUD.THUD... THUD... THUD...THUD. THUD. THUD.\"There's... no time...\" Tolland said.It's not... about us, she thought. It's about the information in my pocket.Rachel pictured the incriminating GPR printout inside the Velcro pocket of herMark IX suit. I need to get the GPR printout into the hands of the NRO... andsoon.Even in her delirious state, Rachel was certain her message would be received.In the mid-eighties, the NRO had replaced the SAA with an array thirty times aspowerful. Total global coverage: Classic Wizard, the NRO's $12 million ear tothe ocean floor. In the next few hours the Cray supercomputers at the NRO/NSAlistening post in Menwith Hill, England, would flag an anomalous sequence in oneof the Arctic's hydrophones, decipher the pounding as an SOS, triangulate thecoordinates, and dispatch a rescue plane from Thule Air Force Base in Greenland.The plane would find three bodies on an iceberg. Frozen. Dead. One would be anNRO employee... and she would be carrying a strange piece of thermal paper inher pocket.A GPR printout.Norah Mangor's final legacy.When the rescuers studied the printout, the mysterious insertion tunnel beneaththe meteorite would be revealed. From there, Rachel had no idea what wouldhappen, but at least the secret would not die with them here on the ice.60Every president's transition into the White House involves a private tour ofthree heavily guarded warehouses containing priceless collections of past WhiteHouse furniture: desks, silverware, bureaus, beds, and other items used by pastpresidents as far back as George Washington. During the tour, the transitioningpresident is invited to select any heirlooms he likes and use them asfurnishings inside the White House during his term. Only the bed in the LincolnBedroom is a permanent White House fixture. Ironically, Lincoln never slept init.The desk at which Zach Herney was currently sitting inside the Oval Office hadonce belonged to his idol, Harry Truman. The desk, though small by modernstandards, served as a daily reminder to Zach Herney that the \"buck\" did indeedstop here, and that Herney was ultimately responsible for any shortcomings ofhis administration. Herney accepted the responsibility as an honor and did hisbest to instill in his staff the motivations to do whatever it took to get thejob done.\"Mr. President?\" his secretary called out, peering into the office. \"Your calljust went through.\"Herney waved. \"Thank you.\"He reached for his phone. He would have preferred some privacy for this call,but he sure as hell was not going to get any of that right now. Two makeupspecialists hovered like gnats, poking and primping at his face and hair.Directly in front of his desk, a television crew was setting up, and an endlessswarm of advisers and PR people scurried around the office, excitedly discussingstrategy.T minus one hour...Herney pressed the illuminated button on his private phone. \"Lawrence? Youthere?\"\"I'm here.\" The NASA administrator's voice sounded consumed, distant.\"Everything okay up there?\"\"Storm's still moving in, but my people tell me the satellite link will not beaffected. We're good to go. One hour and counting.\"\"Excellent. Spirits high, I hope.\"\"Very high. My staff's excited. In fact, we just shared some beers.\"Herney laughed. \"Glad to hear it. Look, I wanted to call and thank you before wedo this thing. Tonight's going to be one hell of a night.\"The administrator paused, sounding uncharacteristically uncertain. \"That itwill, sir. We've been waiting a long time for this.\"Herney hesitated. \"You sound exhausted.\"\"I need some sunlight and a real bed.\"\"One more hour. Smile for the cameras, enjoy the moment, and then we'll get aplane up there to bring you back to D.C.\"\"Looking forward to it.\" The man fell silent again.As a skilled negotiator, Herney was trained to listen, to hear what was beingsaid between the lines. Something in the administrator's voice sounded offsomehow. \"You sure everything's okay up there?\"\"Absolutely. All systems go.\" The administrator seemed eager to change thesubject. \"Did you see the final cut of Michael Tolland's documentary?\"\"Just watched it,\" Herney said. \"He did a fantastic job.\"\"Yes. You made a good call bringing him in.\"\"Still mad at me for involving civilians?\"\"Hell, yes.\" The administrator growled good-naturedly, his voice with the usualstrength to it.It made Herney feel better. Ekstrom's fine, Herney thought. Just a little tired.\"Okay, I'll see you in an hour via satellite. We'll give 'em something to talkabout.\"\"Right.\"\"Hey, Lawrence?\" Herney's voice grew low and solemn now. \"You've done a hell ofa thing up there. I won't ever forget it.\"Outside the habisphere, buffeted by wind, Delta-Three struggled to right andrepack Norah Mangor's toppled equipment sled. Once all the equipment was backonboard, he battened down the vinyl top and draped Mangor's dead body across thetop, tying her down. As he was preparing to drag the sled off course, his twopartners came skimming up the glacier toward him.\"Change of plans,\" Delta-One called out above the wind. \"The other three wentover the edge.\"Delta-Three was not surprised. He also knew what it meant. The Delta Force'splan to stage an accident by arranging four dead bodies on the ice shelf was nolonger a viable option. Leaving a lone body would pose more questions thananswers. \"Sweep?\" he asked.Delta-One nodded. \"I'll recover the flares and you two get rid of the sled.\"While Delta-One carefully retraced the scientists' path, collecting every lastclue that anyone had been there at all, Delta-Three and his partner moved downthe glacier with the laden equipment sled. After struggling over the berms, theyfinally reached the precipice at the end of the Milne Ice Shelf. They gave apush, and Norah Mangor and her sled slipped silently over the edge, plummetinginto the Arctic Ocean.Clean sweep, Delta-Three thought.As they headed back to base, he was pleased to see the wind obliterating thetracks made by their skis.61The nuclear submarine Charlotte had been stationed in the Arctic Ocean for fivedays now. Its presence here was highly classified.A Los Angeles–class sub, the Charlotte was designed to \"listen and not beheard.\" Its forty-two tons of turbine engines were suspended on springs todampen any vibration they might cause. Despite its requirement for stealth, theLA-class sub had one of the largest footprints of any reconnaissance sub in thewater. Stretching more than 360 feet from nose to stern, the hull, if placed onan NFL football field, would crush both goalposts and then some. Seven times thelength of the U.S. Navy's first Holland-class submarine, the Charlotte displaced6,927 tons of water when fully submerged and could cruise at an astoundingthirty-five knots.The vessel's normal cruising depth was just below the thermocline, a naturaltemperature gradient that distorted sonar reflections from above and made thesub invisible to surface radar. With a crew of 148 and max dive depth of overfifteen hundred feet, the vessel represented the state-of-the-art submersibleand was the oceanic workhorse of the United States Navy. Its evaporativeelectrolysis oxygenation system, two nuclear reactors, and engineered provisionsgave it the ability to circumnavigate the globe twenty-one times withoutsurfacing. Human waste from the crew, as on most cruise ships, was compressedinto sixty-pound blocks and ejected into the ocean – the huge bricks of fecesjokingly referred to as \"whale turds.\"The technician sitting at the oscillator screen in the sonar room was one of thebest in the world. His mind was a dictionary of sounds and waveforms. He coulddistinguish between the sounds of several dozen Russian submarine propellers,hundreds of marine animals, and even pinpoint underwater volcanoes as far awayas Japan.At the moment, however, he was listening to a dull, repetitive echo. The sound,although easily distinguishable, was most unexpected.\"You aren't going to believe what's coming through my listening cans,\" he saidto his catalog assistant, handing over the headphones.His assistant donned the headphones, an incredulous look crossing his face. \"MyGod. It's clear as day. What do we do?\"The sonar man was already on the phone to the captain.When the submarine's captain arrived in the sonar room, the technician piped alive sonar feed over a small set of speakers.The captain listened, expressionless.THUD. THUD. THUD.THUD... THUD... THUD...Slower. Slower. The pattern was becoming looser. More and more faint.\"What are the coordinates?\" the captain demanded.The technician cleared his throat. \"Actually, sir, it's coming from the surface,about three miles to our starboard.\"62In the darkened hallway outside Senator Sexton's den, Gabrielle Ashe's legs weretrembling. Not so much out of exhaustion from standing motionless, but fromdisillusionment over what she was listening to. The meeting in the next room wasstill going, but Gabrielle didn't have to hear another word. The truth seemedpainfully obvious.Senator Sexton is taking bribes from private space agencies. Marjorie Tench hadbeen telling the truth.The revulsion Gabrielle felt spreading through her now was one of betrayal. Shehad believed in Sexton. She'd fought for him. How can he do this? Gabrielle hadseen the senator lie publicly from time to time to protect his private life, butthat was politics. This was breaking the law.He's not even elected yet, and he's already selling out the White House!Gabrielle knew she could no longer support the senator. Promising to deliver theNASA privatization bill could be done only with a contemptuous disregard forboth the law and the democratic system. Even if the senator believed it would bein everyone's best interest, to sell that decision flat out, in advance, slammedthe door on the checks and balances of government, ignoring potentiallypersuasive arguments from Congress, advisers, voters, and lobbyists. Mostimportant, guaranteeing the privatization of NASA, Sexton had paved the way forendless abuses of that advanced knowledge – insider trading the most common –blatantly favoring the wealthy, inside cadre at the expense of honest publicinvestors.Feeling sick to her stomach, Gabrielle wondered what she should do.A telephone rang sharply behind her, shattering the silence of the hallway.Startled, Gabrielle turned. The sound was coming from the closet in the foyer –a cellphone in the pocket of one of the visitors' coats.\"'Scuse me, friends,\" a Texas drawl said in the den. \"That's me.\"Gabrielle could hear the man get up. He's coming this way! Wheeling, she dashedback up the carpet the way she'd come. Halfway up the hall, she cut left,ducking into the darkened kitchen just as the Texan exited the den and turned upthe hall. Gabrielle froze, motionless in the shadows.The Texan strode by without noticing.Over the sound of her pounding heart, Gabrielle could hear him rustling in thecloset. Finally, he answered the ringing phone.\"Yeah?... When?... Really? We'll switch it on. Thanks.\" The man hung up andheaded back toward the den, calling out as he went. \"Hey! Turn on thetelevision. Sounds like Zach Herney's giving an urgent press conference tonight.Eight o'clock. All channels. Either we're declaring war on China, or theInternational Space Station just fell into the ocean.\"\"Now wouldn't that be something to toast!\" someone called out.Everyone laughed.Gabrielle felt the kitchen spinning around her now. An eight P.M. pressconference? Tench, it seemed, had not been bluffing after all. She had givenGabrielle until 8:00 P.M. to give her an affidavit admitting the affair.Distance yourself from the senator before it's too late, Tench had told her.Gabrielle had assumed the deadline was so the White House could leak theinformation to tomorrow's papers, but now it seemed the White House intended togo public with the allegations themselves.An urgent press conference? The more Gabrielle considered it, though, thestranger it seemed. Herney is going live with this mess? Personally?The television came on in the den. Blaring. The news announcer's voice wasbursting with excitement. \"The White House has offered no clues as to the topicof tonight's surprise presidential address, and speculation abounds. Somepolitical analysts now think that following the President's recent absence onthe campaign trail, Zach Herney may be preparing to announce he will not berunning for a second term.\"A hopeful cheer arose in the den.Absurd, Gabrielle thought. With all the dirt the White House had on Sexton rightnow, there was no way in hell the President was throwing in the towel tonight.This press conference is about something else. Gabrielle had a sinking feelingshe'd already been warned what it was.With rising urgency, she checked her watch. Less than an hour. She had adecision to make, and she knew exactly to whom she needed to talk. Clutching theenvelope of photos under her arm, she quietly exited the apartment.In the hallway, the bodyguard looked relieved. \"I heard some cheering inside.Sounds like you were a hit.\"She smiled curtly and headed for the elevator.Outside in the street, the settling night felt unusually bitter. Flagging a cab,she climbed in and tried to reassure herself she knew exactly what she wasdoing.\"ABC television studios,\" she told the driver. \"And hurry.\"63As Michael Tolland lay on his side on the ice, he rested his head on anoutstretched arm, which he could no longer feel. Although his eyelids feltheavy, he fought to keep them open. From this odd vantage point, Tolland took inthe final images of his world – now just sea and ice – in a strange sidewaystilt. It seemed a fitting end to a day in which nothing had been what it seemed.An eerie calm had begun to settle over the floating raft of ice. Rachel andCorky had both fallen silent, and the pounding had stopped. The farther from theglacier they floated, the calmer the wind became. Tolland heard his own bodygetting quieter too. With the tight skullcap over his ears, he could hear hisown breathing amplified in his head. It was getting slower... shallower. Hisbody was no longer able to fight off the compressing sensation that accompaniedhis own blood racing from his extremities like a crew abandoning ship, flowinginstinctively to his vital organs in a last-ditch effort to keep him conscious.A losing battle, he knew.Strangely, there was no pain anymore. He had passed through that stage. Thesensation now was that of having been inflated. Numbness. Floating. As the firstof his reflexive operations – blinking – began to shut down, Tolland's visionblurred. The aqueous humor that circulated between his cornea and lens wasfreezing repeatedly. Tolland gazed back toward the blur of the Milne Ice Shelf,now only a faint white form in the hazy moonlight.He felt his soul admitting defeat. Teetering on the brink between presence andabsence, he stared out at the ocean waves in the distance. The wind howled allaround him.It was then that Tolland began hallucinating. Strangely, in the final secondsbefore unconsciousness, he did not hallucinate rescue. He did not hallucinatewarm and comforting thoughts. His final delusion was a terrifying one.A leviathan was rising from the water beside the iceberg, breaching the surfacewith an ominous hiss. Like some mythical sea monster, it came – sleek, black,and lethal, with water foaming around it. Tolland forced himself to blink hiseyes. His vision cleared slightly. The beast was close, bumping up against theice like a huge shark butting a small boat. Massive, it towered before him, itsskin shimmering and wet.As the hazy image went black, all that was left were the sounds. Metal on metal.Teeth gnashing at the ice. Coming closer. Dragging bodies away.Rachel...Tolland felt himself being grabbed roughly.And then everything went blank.64Gabrielle Ashe was at a full jog when she entered the third-floor productionroom of ABC News. Even so, she was moving slower than everyone else in the room.The intensity in production was at a fever pitch twenty-four hours a day, but atthe moment the cubicle grid in front of her looked like the stock exchange onspeed. Wild-eyed editors screamed to one another over the tops of theircompartments, fax-waving reporters darted from cubicle to cubicle comparingnotes, and frantic interns inhaled Snickers and Mountain Dew between errands.Gabrielle had come to ABC to see Yolanda Cole.Usually Yolanda could be found in production's high-rent district – theglass-walled private offices reserved for the decision makers who actuallyrequired some quiet to think. Tonight, however, Yolanda was out on the floor, inthe thick of it. When she saw Gabrielle, she let out her usual shriek ofexuberance.\"Gabs!\" Yolanda was wearing a batik body-wrap and tortoiseshell glasses. Asalways, several pounds of garish costume jewelry were draped off her liketinsel. Yolanda waddled over, waving. \"Hug!\"Yolanda Cole had been a content editor with ABC News in Washington for sixteenyears. A freckle-faced Pole, Yolanda was a squat, balding woman whom everyoneaffectionately called \"Mother.\" Her matronly presence and good humor disguised astreet-savvy ruthlessness for getting the story. Gabrielle had met Yolanda at aWomen in Politics mentoring seminar she'd attended shortly after her arrival inWashington. They'd chatted about Gabrielle's background, the challenges of beinga woman in D.C., and finally about Elvis Presley – a passion they were surprisedto discover they shared. Yolanda had taken Gabrielle under her wing and helpedher make connections. Gabrielle still stopped by every month or so to say hello.Gabrielle gave her a big hug, Yolanda's enthusiasm already lifting her spirits.Yolanda stepped back and looked Gabrielle over. \"You look like you aged ahundred years, girl! What happened to you?\"Gabrielle lowered her voice. \"I'm in trouble, Yolanda.\"\"That's not the word on the street. Sounds like your man is on the rise.\"\"Is there some place we can talk in private?\"\"Bad timing, honey. The President is holding a press conference in about half anhour, and we still haven't a clue what it's all about. I've got to line upexpert commentary, and I'm flying blind.\"\"I know what the press conference is about.\"Yolanda lowered her glasses, looking skeptical. \"Gabrielle, our correspondentinside the White House is in the dark on this one. You say Sexton's campaign hasadvance knowledge?\"\"No, I'm saying I have advance knowledge. Give me five minutes. I'll tell youeverything.\"Yolanda glanced down at the red White House envelope in Gabrielle's hand.\"That's a White House internal. Where'd you get that?\"\"In a private meeting with Marjorie Tench this afternoon.\"Yolanda stared a long moment. \"Follow me.\"Inside the privacy of Yolanda's glass-walled cubicle, Gabrielle confided in hertrusted friend, confessing to a one-night affair with Sexton and the fact thatTench had photographic evidence.Yolanda smiled broadly and shook her head laughing. Apparently she had been inWashington journalism so long that nothing shocked her. \"Oh, Gabs, I had a hunchyou and Sexton had probably hooked up. Not surprising. He's got a reputation,and you're a pretty girl. Too bad about the photos. I wouldn't worry about it,though.\"Don't worry about it?Gabrielle explained that Tench had accused Sexton of taking illegal bribes fromspace companies and that Gabrielle had just overheard a secret SFF meetingconfirming that fact! Again Yolanda's expression conveyed little surprise orconcern – until Gabrielle told her what she was thinking of doing about it.Yolanda now looked troubled. \"Gabrielle, if you want to hand over a legaldocument saying you slept with a U.S. senator and stood by while he lied aboutit, that's your business. But I'm telling you, it's a very bad move for you. Youneed to think long and hard about what it could mean for you.\"\"You're not listening. I don't have that kind of time!\"\"I am listening, and sweetheart, whether or not the clock is ticking, there arecertain things you just do not do. You do not sell out a U.S. senator in a sexscandal. It's suicide. I'm telling you, girl, if you take down a presidentialcandidate, you better get in your car and drive as far from D.C. as possible.You'll be a marked woman. A lot of people spend a lot of money to put candidatesat the top. There's big finances and power at stake here – the kind of powerpeople kill for.\"Gabrielle fell silent now.\"Personally,\" Yolanda said, \"I think Tench was leaning on you in hopes you'dpanic and do something dumb – like bail out and confess to the affair.\" Yolandapointed to the red envelope in Gabrielle's hands. \"Those shots of you and Sextondon't mean squat unless you or Sexton admit they're accurate. The White Houseknows if they leak those photos, Sexton will just claim they're phony and throwthem back in the president's face.\"\"I thought of that, but still the campaign finance bribery issue is –\"\"Honey, think about it. If the White House hasn't gone public yet with briberyallegations, they probably don't intend to. The President is pretty seriousabout no negative campaigning. My guess is he decided to save an aerospaceindustry scandal and sent Tench after you with a bluff in hopes he might scareyou out of hiding on the sex thing. Make you stab your candidate in the back.\"Gabrielle considered it. Yolanda was making sense, and yet something still feltodd. Gabrielle pointed through the glass at the bustling news room. \"Yolanda,you guys are gearing up for a big presidential press conference. If thePresident is not going public about bribery or sex, what's it all about?\"Yolanda looked stunned. \"Hold on. You think this press conference is about youand Sexton?\"\"Or the bribery. Or both. Tench told me I had until eight tonight to sign aconfession or else the President was going to announce –\"Yolanda's laughter shook the entire glass cubicle. \"Oh please! Wait! You'rekilling me!\"Gabrielle was in no mood for joking. \"What!\"\"Gabs, listen,\" Yolanda managed, between laughs, \"trust me on this. I've beendealing with the White House for sixteen years, and there's no way Zach Herneyhas called together the global media to tell them he suspects Senator Sexton isaccepting shady campaign financing or sleeping with you. That's the kind ofinformation you leak. Presidents don't gain popularity by interrupting regularlyscheduled programming to bitch and moan about sex or alleged infractions ofcloudy campaign finance laws.\"\"Cloudy?\" Gabrielle snapped. \"Flat out selling your decision on a space bill formillions in ad money is hardly a cloudy issue!\"\"Are you sure that's what he is doing?\" Yolanda's tone hardened now. \"Are yousure enough to drop your skirt on national TV? Think about it. It takes a lot ofalliances to get anything done these days, and campaign finance is complexstuff. Maybe Sexton's meeting was perfectly legal.\"\"He's breaking the law,\" Gabrielle said. Isn't he?\"Or so Marjorie Tench would have you believe. Candidates acceptbehind-the-scenes donations all the time from big corporations. It may not bepretty, but it's not necessarily illegal. In fact, most legal issues deal notwith where the money comes from but how the candidate chooses to spend it.\"Gabrielle hesitated, feeling uncertain now.\"Gabs, the White House played you this afternoon. They tried to turn you againstyour candidate, and so far you've called their bluff. If I were looking forsomeone to trust, I think I'd stick with Sexton before jumping ship to someonelike Marjorie Tench.\"Yolanda's phone rang. She answered, nodding, uh-huh-ing, taking notes.\"Interesting,\" she finally said. \"I'll be right there. Thanks.\"Yolanda hung up and turned with an arched brow. \"Gabs, sounds like you're offthe hook. Just as I predicted.\"\"What's going on?\"\"I don't have a specific yet, but I can tell you this much – the president'spress conference has nothing to do with sex scandals or campaign finance.\"Gabrielle felt a flash of hope and wanted badly to believe her. \"How do you knowthat?\"\"Someone on the inside just leaked that the press conference is NASA-related.\"Gabrielle sat up suddenly. \"NASA?\"Yolanda winked. \"This could be your lucky night. My bet is President Herney isfeeling so much pressure from Senator Sexton that he's decided the White Househas no choice but to pull the plug on the International Space Station. Thatexplains all the global media coverage.\"A press conference killing the space station? Gabrielle could not imagine.Yolanda stood up. \"That Tench attack this afternoon? It was probably just alast-ditch effort to get a foothold over Sexton before the President had to gopublic with the bad news. Nothing like a sex scandal to take the attention awayfrom another presidential flop. Anyhow, Gabs, I've got work to do. My advice toyou – get yourself a cup of coffee, sit right here, turn on my television, andride this out like the rest of us. We've got twenty minutes until show time, andI'm telling you, there is no way the President is going Dumpster-diving tonight.He's got the whole world watching. Whatever he has to say carries some seriousweight.\" She gave a reassuring wink. \"Now give me the envelope.\"\"What?\"Yolanda held out a demanding hand. \"These pictures are getting locked in my deskuntil this is over. I want to be sure you don't do something idiotic.\"Reluctantly, Gabrielle handed over the envelope.Yolanda locked the photos carefully in a desk drawer and pocketed the keys.\"You'll thank me, Gabs. I swear it.\" She playfully ruffled Gabrielle's hair onher way out. \"Sit tight. I think good news is on the way.\"Gabrielle sat alone in the glass cubicle and tried to let Yolanda's upbeatattitude lift her mood. All Gabrielle could think of, though, was theself-satisfied smirk on the face of Marjorie Tench this afternoon. Gabriellecould not imagine what the President was about to tell the world, but it wasdefinitely not going to be good news for Senator Sexton.65Rachel Sexton felt like she was being burned alive.It's raining fire!She tried to open her eyes, but all she could make out were foggy shapes andblinding lights. It was raining all around her. Scalding hot rain. Pounding downon her bare skin. She was lying on her side and could feel hot tiles beneath herbody. She curled more tightly into the fetal position, trying to protect herselffrom the scalding liquid falling from above. She smelled chemicals. Chlorine,maybe. She tried to crawl away, but she could not. Powerful hands pressed downon her shoulders, holding her down.Let me go! I'm burning!Instinctively, she again fought to escape, and again she was rebuffed, thestrong hands clamping down. \"Stay where you are,\" a man's voice said. The accentwas American. Professional. \"It will be over soon.\"What will be over? Rachel wondered. The pain? My life? She tried to focus hervision. The lights in this place were harsh. She sensed the room was small.Cramped. Low ceilings.\"I'm burning!\" Rachel's scream was a whisper.\"You're fine,\" the voice said. \"This water is lukewarm. Trust me.\"Rachel realized she was mostly undressed, wearing only her soaked underwear. Noembarrassment registered; her mind was filled with too many other questions.The memories were coming back now in a torrent. The ice shelf. The GPR. Theattack. Who? Where am I? She tried to put the pieces together, but her mind felttorpid, like a set of clogged gears. From out of the muddled confusion came asingle thought: Michael and Corky... where are they?Rachel tried to focus her bleary vision but saw only the men standing over her.They were all dressed in the same blue jumpsuits. She wanted to speak, but hermouth refused to formulate a single word. The burning sensation in her skin wasnow giving way to sudden deep waves of aching that rolled through the muscleslike seismic tremors.\"Let it happen,\" the man over her said. \"The blood needs to flow back into yourmusculature.\" He spoke like a doctor. \"Try to move your limbs as much as youcan.\"The pain racking Rachel's body felt as if every muscle was being beaten with ahammer. She lay there on the tile, her chest contracting, and she could barelybreathe.\"Move your legs and arms,\" the man insisted. \"No matter what it feels like.\"Rachel tried. Each movement felt like a knife being thrust into her joints. Thejets of water grew hotter again. The scalding was back. The crushing pain wenton. At the precise instant she thought she could not withstand another moment,Rachel felt someone giving her an injection. The pain seemed to subside quickly,less and less violent, releasing. The tremors slowed. She felt herself breathingagain.A new sensation was spreading through her body now, the eerie bite of pins andneedles. Everywhere – stabbing – sharper and sharper. Millions of tinyneedle-point jabs, intensifying whenever she moved. She tried to holdmotionless, but the water jets continued to buffet her. The man above her washolding her arms, moving them.God that hurts! Rachel was too weak to fight. Tears of exhaustion and painpoured down her face. She shut her eyes hard, blocking out the world.Finally, the pins and needles began to dissipate. The rain from above stopped.When Rachel opened her eyes, her vision was clearer.It was then that she saw them.Corky and Tolland lay nearby, quivering, half-naked and soaked. From the looksof anguish on their faces, Rachel sensed that they had just endured similarexperiences. Michael Tolland's brown eyes were bloodshot and glassy. When he sawRachel, he managed a weak smile, his blue lips trembling.Rachel tried to sit up, to take in their bizarre surroundings. The three of themwere lying in a trembling twist of half-naked limbs on the floor of a tinyshower room."},{"pageContent":"66Strong arms lifted her.Rachel felt the powerful strangers drying her body and wrapping her in blankets.She was being placed on a medical bed of some sort and vigorously massaged onher arms, legs, and feet. Another injection in her arm.\"Adrenaline,\" someone said.Rachel felt the drug coursing through her veins like a life force, invigoratingher muscles. Although she still felt an icy hollowness tight like a drum in hergut, Rachel sensed the blood slowly returning to her limbs.Back from the dead.She tried to focus her vision. Tolland and Corky were lying nearby, shivering inblankets as the men massaged their bodies and gave them injections as well.Rachel had no doubt that this mysterious assemblage of men had just saved theirlives. Many of them were soaking wet, apparently having jumped into the showersfully clothed to help. Who they were or how they had gotten to Rachel and theothers in time was beyond her. It made no difference at the moment. We're alive.\"Where... are we?\" Rachel managed, the simple act of trying to speak bringing ona crashing headache.The man massaging her replied, \"You're on the medical deck of a Los Angelesclass –\"\"On deck!\" someone called out.Rachel sensed a sudden commotion all around her, and she tried to sit up. One ofthe men in blue helped, propping her up, and pulling the blankets up around her.Rachel rubbed her eyes and saw someone striding into the room.The newcomer was a powerful African-American man. Handsome and authoritative.His uniform was khaki. \"At ease,\" he declared, moving toward Rachel, stoppingover her and gazing down at her with strong black eyes. \"Harold Brown,\" he said,his voice deep and commanding. \"Captain of the U.S.S. Charlotte. And you are?\"U.S.S. Charlotte, Rachel thought. The name seemed vaguely familiar. \"Sexton...,\"she replied. \"I'm Rachel Sexton.\"The man looked puzzled. He stepped closer, studying her more carefully. \"I'll bedamned. So you are.\"Rachel felt lost. He knows me? Rachel was certain she did not recognize the man,although as her eyes dropped from his face to the patch on his chest, she sawthe familiar emblem of an eagle clutching an anchor surrounded by the words U.S.NAVY.It now registered why she knew the name Charlotte.\"Welcome aboard, Ms. Sexton,\" the captain said. \"You've gisted a number of thisship's recon reports. I know who you are.\"\"But what are you doing in these waters?\" she stammered.His face hardened somewhat. \"Frankly, Ms. Sexton, I was about to ask you thesame question.\"Tolland sat up slowly now, opening his mouth to speak. Rachel silenced him witha firm shake of her head. Not here. Not now. She had no doubt the first thingTolland and Corky would want to talk about was the meteorite and the attack, butthis was certainly not a topic to discuss in front of a Navy submarine crew. Inthe world of intelligence, regardless of crisis, CLEARANCE remained king; themeteorite situation remained highly classified.\"I need to speak to NRO director William Pickering,\" she told the captain. \"Inprivate, and immediately.\"The captain arched his eyebrows, apparently unaccustomed to taking orders on hisown ship.\"I have classified information I need to share.\"The captain studied her a long moment. \"Let's get your body temperature back,and then I'll put you in contact with the NRO director.\"\"It's urgent, sir. I –\" Rachel stopped short. Her eyes had just seen a clock onthe wall over the pharmaceutical closet.19:51 HOURS.Rachel blinked, staring. \"Is... is that clock right?\"\"You're on a navy vessel, ma'am. Our clocks are accurate.\"\"And is that... Eastern time?\"\"7:51 P.M. Eastern Standard. We're out of Norfolk.\"My God! she thought, stunned. It's only 7:51 P.M.? Rachel had the impressionhours had passed since she passed out. It was not even past eight o'clock? ThePresident has not yet gone public about the meteorite! I still have time to stophim! She immediately slid down off the bed, wrapping the blanket around her. Herlegs felt shaky. \"I need to speak to the President right away.\"The captain looked confused. \"The president of what?\"\"Of the United States!\"\"I thought you wanted William Pickering.\"\"I don't have time. I need the President.\"The captain did not move, his huge frame blocking her way. \"My understanding isthat the President is about to give a very important live press conference. Idoubt he's taking personal phone calls.\"Rachel stood as straight as she could on her wobbly legs and fixed her eyes onthe captain. \"Sir, you do not have the clearance for me to explain thesituation, but the President is about to make a terrible mistake. I haveinformation he desperately needs to hear. Now. You need to trust me.\"The captain stared at her a long moment. Frowning, he checked the clock again.\"Nine minutes? I can't get you a secure connection to the White House in thatshort a time. All I could offer is a radiophone. Unsecured. And we'd have to goto antenna depth, which will take a few –\"\"Do it! Now!\"67The White House telephone switchboard was located on the lower level of the EastWing. Three switchboard operators were always on duty. At the moment, only twowere seated at the controls. The third operator was at a full sprint toward theBriefing Room. In her hand, she carried a cordless phone. She'd tried to patchthe call through to the Oval Office, but the President was already en route tothe press conference. She'd tried to call his aides on their cellulars, butbefore televised briefings, all cellular phones in and around the Briefing Roomwere turned off so as not to interrupt the proceedings.Running a cordless phone directly to the President at a time like this seemedquestionable at best, and yet when the White House's NRO liaison called claimingshe had emergency information that the President must get before going live, theoperator had little doubt she needed to jump. The question now was whether shewould get there in time.In a small medical office onboard the U.S.S. Charlotte, Rachel Sexton clutched aphone receiver to her ear and waited to talk to the President. Tolland and Corkysat nearby, still looking shaken. Corky had five stitches and a deep bruise onhis cheekbone. All three of them had been helped into Thinsulate thermalunderwear, heavy navy flight suits, oversized wool socks, and deck boots. With ahot cup of stale coffee in her hand, Rachel was starting to feel almost humanagain.\"What's the holdup?\" Tolland pressed. \"It's seven fifty-six!\"Rachel could not imagine. She had successfully reached one of the White Houseoperators, explained who she was and that this was an emergency. The operatorseemed sympathetic, had placed Rachel on hold, and was now, supposedly, makingit her top priority to patch Rachel through to the President.Four minutes, Rachel thought. Hurry up!Closing her eyes, Rachel tried to gather her thoughts. It had been one hell of aday. I'm on a nuclear submarine, she said to herself, knowing she was damnedlucky to be anywhere at all. According to the submarine captain, the Charlottehad been on a routine patrol in the Bering Sea two days ago and had picked upanomalous underwater sounds coming from the Milne Ice Shelf – drilling, jetnoise, lots of encrypted radio traffic. They had been redirected and told to liequietly and listen. An hour or so ago, they'd heard an explosion in the iceshelf and moved in to check it out. That was when they heard Rachel's SOS call.\"Three minutes left!\" Tolland sounded anxious now as he monitored the clock.Rachel was definitely getting nervous now. What was taking so long? Why hadn'tthe President taken her call? If Zach Herney went public with the data as itstood –Rachel forced the thought from her mind and shook the receiver. Pick up!As the White House operator dashed toward the stage entrance of the BriefingRoom, she was met with a gathering throng of staff members. Everyone here wastalking excitedly, making final preparations. She could see the President twentyyards away waiting at the entrance. The makeup people were still primping.\"Coming through!\" the operator said, trying to get through the crowd. \"Call forthe President. Excuse me. Coming through!\"\"Live in two minutes!\" a media coordinator called out.Clutching the phone, the operator shoved her way toward the President. \"Call forthe President!\" she panted. \"Coming through!\"A towering roadblock stepped into her path. Marjorie Tench. The senior adviser'slong face grimaced down in disapproval. \"What's going on?\"\"I have an emergency!\" The operator was breathless. \"... phone call for thePresident.\"Tench looked incredulous. \"Not now, you don't!\"\"It's from Rachel Sexton. She says it's urgent.\"The scowl that darkened Tench's face appeared to be more one of puzzlement thananger. Tench eyed the cordless phone. \"That's a house line. That's not secure.\"\"No, ma'am. But the incoming call is open anyway. She's on a radiophone. Sheneeds to speak to the President right away.\"\"Live in ninety seconds!\"Tench's cold eyes stared, and she held out a spider-like hand. \"Give me thephone.\"The operator's heart was pounding now. \"Ms. Sexton wants to speak to PresidentHerney directly. She told me to postpone the press conference until she'd talkedto him. I assured –\"Tench stepped toward the operator now, her voice a seething whisper. \"Let metell you how this works. You do not take orders from the daughter of thePresident's opponent, you take them from me. I can assure you, this is as closeas you are getting to the President until I find out what the hell is going on.\"The operator looked toward the President, who was now surrounded by microphonetechnicians, stylists, and several staff members talking him through finalrevisions of his speech.\"Sixty seconds!\" the television supervisor yelled.Onboard the Charlotte, Rachel Sexton was pacing wildly in the tight space whenshe finally heard a click on the telephone line.A raspy voice came on. \"Hello?\"\"President Herney?\" Rachel blurted.\"Marjorie Tench,\" the voice corrected. \"I am the President's senior adviser.Whoever this is, I must warn you that prank calls against the White House are inviolation of –\"For Christ's sake! \"This is not a prank! This is Rachel Sexton. I'm your NROliaison and –\"\"I am aware of who Rachel Sexton is, ma'am. And I am doubtful that you are she.You've called the White House on an unsecured line telling me to interrupt amajor presidential broadcast. That is hardly proper MO for someone with – \"\"Listen,\" Rachel fumed, \"I briefed your whole staff a couple of hours ago on ameteorite. You sat in the front row. You watched my briefing on a televisionsitting on the President's desk! Any questions?\"Tench fell silent a moment. \"Ms. Sexton, what is the meaning of this?\"\"The meaning is that you have to stop the President! His meteorite data is allwrong! We've just learned the meteorite was inserted from beneath the ice shelf.I don't know by whom, and I don't know why! But things are not what they seem uphere! The President is about to endorse some seriously errant data, and Istrongly advise –\"\"Wait one goddamned minute!\" Tench lowered her voice. \"Do you realize what youare saying?\"\"Yes! I suspect the NASA administrator has orchestrated some kind of large-scalefraud, and President Herney is about to get caught in the middle. You've atleast got to postpone ten minutes so I can explain to him what's been going onup here. Someone tried to kill me, for God's sake!\"Tench's voice turned to ice. \"Ms. Sexton, let me give you a word of warning. Ifyou are having second thoughts about your role in helping the White House inthis campaign, you should have thought of that long before you personallyendorsed that meteorite data for the President.\"\"What!\" Is she even listening?\"I'm revolted by your display. Using an unsecured line is a cheap stunt.Implying the meteorite data has been faked? What kind of intelligence officialuses a radiophone to call the White House and talk about classified information?Obviously you are hoping someone intercepts this message.\"\"Norah Mangor was killed over this! Dr. Ming is also dead. You've got to warn –\"\"Stop right there! I don't know what you're playing at, but I will remind you –and anyone else who happens to be intercepting this phone call – that the WhiteHouse possesses videotaped depositions from NASA's top scientists, severalrenowned civilian scientists, and yourself, Ms. Sexton, all endorsing themeteorite data as accurate. Why you are suddenly changing your story, I can onlyimagine. Whatever the reason, consider yourself relieved of your White Housepost as of this instant, and if you try to taint this discovery with any moreabsurd allegations of foul play, I assure you the White House and NASA will sueyou for defamation so fast you won't have a chance to pack a suitcase before yougo to jail.\"Rachel opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.\"Zach Herney has been generous to you,\" Tench snapped, \"and frankly this smacksof a cheap Sexton publicity stunt. Drop it right now, or we'll press charges. Iswear it.\"The line went dead.Rachel's mouth was still hanging open when the captain knocked on the door.\"Ms. Sexton?\" the captain said, peering in. \"We're picking up a faint signalfrom Canadian National Radio. President Zach Herney has just begun his pressconference.\"68Standing at the podium in the White House Briefing Room, Zach Herney felt theheat of the media lights and knew the world was watching. The targeted blitzperformed by the White House Press Office had created a contagion of media buzz.Those who did not hear about the address via television, radio, or on-line newsinvariably heard about it from neighbors, coworkers, and family. By 8:00 P.M.,anyone not living in a cave was speculating about the topic of the President'saddress. In bars and living rooms over the globe, millions leaned toward theirtelevisions in apprehensive wonder.It was during moments like these – facing the world – that Zach Herney trulyfelt the weight of his office. Anyone who said power was not addictive had neverreally experienced it. As he began his address, however, Herney sensed somethingwas amiss. He was not a man prone to stage fright, and so the tingle ofapprehension now tightening in his core startled him.It's the magnitude of the audience, he told himself. And yet he knew somethingelse. Instinct. Something he had seen.It had been such a little thing, and yet...He told himself to forget it. It was nothing. And yet it stuck.Tench.Moments ago, as Herney was preparing to take the stage, he had seen MarjorieTench in the yellow hallway, talking on a cordless phone. This was strange initself, but it was made more so by the White House operator standing beside her,her face white with apprehension. Herney could not hear Tench's phoneconversation, but he could see it was contentious. Tench was arguing with avehemence and anger the President had seldom seen – even from Tench. He paused amoment and caught her eye, inquisitive.Tench gave him the thumbs-up. Herney had never seen Tench give anyone thethumbs-up. It was the last image in Herney's mind as he was cued onto the stage.On the blue rug in the press area inside the NASA habisphere on EllesmereIsland, Administrator Lawrence Ekstrom was seated at the center of the longsymposium table, flanked by top NASA officials and scientists. On a largemonitor facing them the President's opening statement was being piped in live.The remainder of the NASA crew was huddled around other monitors, teeming withexcitement as their commander-in-chief launched into his press conference.\"Good evening,\" Herney was saying, sounding uncharacteristically stiff. \"To myfellow countrymen, and to our friends around the world...\"Ekstrom gazed at the huge charred mass of rock displayed prominently in front ofhim. His eyes moved to a standby monitor, where he watched himself, flanked byhis most austere personnel, against a backdrop of a huge American flag and NASAlogo. The dramatic lighting made the setting look like some kind of neomodernpainting – the twelve apostles at the last supper. Zach Herney had turned thiswhole thing into a political sideshow. Herney had no choice. Ekstrom still feltlike a televangelist, packaging God for the masses.In about five minutes the President would introduce Ekstrom and his NASA staff.Then, in a dramatic satellite linkup from the top of the world, NASA would jointhe President in sharing this news with the world. After a brief account of howthe discovery was made, what it meant for space science, and some mutualbackpatting, NASA and the President would hand duty off to celebrity scientistMichael Tolland, whose documentary would roll for just under fifteen minutes.Afterward, with credibility and enthusiasm at its peak, Ekstrom and thePresident would say their good-nights, promising more information to come in thedays ahead via endless NASA press conferences.As Ekstrom sat and waited for his cue, he felt a cavernous shame settling insidehim. He'd known he would feel it. He'd been expecting it.He'd told lies... endorsed untruths.Somehow, though, the lies seemed inconsequential now. Ekstrom had a biggerweight on his mind.In the chaos of the ABC production room, Gabrielle Ashe stood shoulder toshoulder with dozens of strangers, all necks craned toward the bank oftelevision monitors suspended from the ceiling. A hush fell as the momentarrived. Gabrielle closed her eyes, praying that when she opened them she wouldnot be looking at images of her own naked body.The air inside Senator Sexton's den was alive with excitement. All of hisvisitors were standing now, their eyes glued to the large-screen television.Zach Herney stood before the world, and incredibly, his greeting had beenawkward. He seemed momentarily uncertain.He looks shaky, Sexton thought. He never looks shaky.\"Look at him,\" somebody whispered. \"It has to be bad news.\"The space station? Sexton wondered.Herney looked directly into the camera and took a deep breath. \"My friends, Ihave puzzled for many days now over how best to make this announcement...\"Three easy words, Senator Sexton willed him. We blew it.Herney spoke for a moment about how unfortunate it was that NASA had become suchan issue in this election and how, that being the case, he felt he needed topreface the timing of his impending statement with an apology.\"I would have preferred any other moment in history to make this announcement,\"he said. \"The political charge in the air tends to make doubters out ofdreamers, and yet as your President, I have no choice but to share with you whatI have recently learned.\" He smiled. \"It seems the magic of the cosmos issomething which does not work on any human schedule... not even that of apresident.\"Everyone in Sexton's den seemed to recoil in unison. What?\"Two weeks ago,\" Herney said, \"NASA's new Polar Orbiting Density Scanner passedover the Milne Ice Shelf on Ellesmere Island, a remote landmass located abovethe Eightieth Parallel in the high Arctic Ocean.\"Sexton and the others exchanged confused looks.\"This NASA satellite,\" Herney continued, \"detected a large, high-density rockburied two hundred feet under the ice.\" Herney smiled now for the first time,finding his stride. \"On receiving the data, NASA immediately suspected PODS hadfound a meteorite.\"\"A meteorite?\" Sexton sputtered, standing. \"This is news?\"\"NASA sent a team up to the ice shelf to take core samples. It was then thatNASA made...\" He paused.\"Frankly, they made the scientific discovery of the century.\"Sexton took an incredulous step toward the television. No.... His guests shifteduneasily.\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" Herney announced, \"several hours ago, NASA pulled fromthe Arctic ice an eight-ton meteorite, which contains...\" The President pausedagain, giving the whole world time to lean forward. \"A meteorite which containsfossils of a life-form. Dozens of them. Unequivocal proof of extraterrestriallife.\"On cue, a brilliant image illuminated on the screen behind the President – aperfectly delineated fossil of an enormous buglike creature embedded in acharred rock.In Sexton's den, six entrepreneurs jumped up in wide-eyed horror. Sexton stoodfrozen in place.\"My friends,\" the President said, \"the fossil behind me is 190 million yearsold. It was discovered in a fragment of a meteorite called the Jungersol Fallwhich hit the Arctic Ocean almost three centuries ago. NASA's exciting new PODSsatellite discovered this meteorite fragment buried in an ice shelf. NASA andthis administration have taken enormous care over the past two weeks to confirmevery aspect of this momentous discovery before making it public. In the nexthalf hour you will be hearing from numerous NASA and civilian scientists, aswell as viewing a short documentary prepared by a familiar face whom I'm sureyou all will recognize. Before I go any further, though, I absolutely mustwelcome, live via satellite from above the Arctic Circle, the man whoseleadership, vision, and hard work is solely responsible for this historicmoment. It is with great honor that I present NASA administrator LawrenceEkstrom.\"Herney turned to the screen on perfect cue.The image of the meteorite dramatically dissolved into a regal-looking panel ofNASA scientists seated at a long table, flanked by the dominant frame ofLawrence Ekstrom.\"Thank you, Mr. President.\" Ekstrom's air was stern and proud as he stood up andlooked directly into the camera. \"It gives me great pride to share with all ofyou, this – NASA's finest hour.\"Ekstrom spoke passionately about NASA and the discovery. With a fanfare ofpatriotism and triumph, he segued flawlessly to a documentary hosted by civilianscience–celebrity Michael Tolland.As he watched, Senator Sexton fell to his knees in front of the television, hisfingers clutching at his silver mane. No! God, no!69Marjorie Tench was livid as she broke away from the jovial chaos outside theBriefing Room and marched back to her private corner in the West Wing. She wasin no mood for celebration. The phone call from Rachel Sexton had been mostunexpected.Most disappointing.Tench slammed her office door, stalked to her desk, and dialed the White Houseoperator. \"William Pickering. NRO.\"Tench lit a cigarette and paced the room as she waited for the operator to trackdown Pickering. Normally, he might have gone home for the night, but with theWhite House's big windup into tonight's press conference, Tench guessedPickering had been in his office all evening, glued to his television screen,wondering what could possibly be going on in the world about which the NROdirector did not have prior knowledge.Tench cursed herself for not trusting her instincts when the President said hewanted to send Rachel Sexton to Milne. Tench had been wary, feeling it was anunnecessary risk. But the President had been convincing, persuading Tench thatthe White House staff had grown cynical over the past weeks and would be suspectof the NASA discovery if the news came from in-house. As Herney had promised,Rachel Sexton's endorsement had squelched suspicions, prevented any skepticalin-house debate, and forced the White House staff to move forward with a unifiedfront. Invaluable, Tench had to admit. And yet now Rachel Sexton had changed hertune.The bitch called me on an unsecured line.Rachel Sexton was obviously intent on destroying the credibility of thisdiscovery, and Tench's only solace was knowing the President had capturedRachel's earlier briefing on videotape. Thank God. At least Herney had thoughtto obtain that small insurance. Tench was starting to fear they were going toneed it.At the moment, however, Tench was trying to stem the bleeding in other ways.Rachel Sexton was a smart woman, and if she truly intended to go head-to-headwith the White House and NASA, she would need to recruit some powerful allies.Her first logical choice would be William Pickering. Tench already knew howPickering felt about NASA. She needed to get to Pickering before Rachel did.\"Ms. Tench?\" the transparent voice on the line said. \"William Pickering, here.To what do I owe this honor?\"Tench could hear the television in the background – NASA commentary. She couldalready sense in his tone that he was still reeling from the press conference.\"Do you have a minute, director?\"\"I expected you'd be busy celebrating. Quite a night for you. Looks like NASAand the President are back in the fight.\"Tench heard stark amazement in his voice, combined with a tinge of acrimony –the latter no doubt on account of the man's legendary distaste for hearingbreaking news at the same time as the rest of the world.\"I apologize,\" Tench said, trying to build an immediate bridge, \"that the WhiteHouse and NASA were forced to keep you unapprised.\"\"You are aware,\" Pickering said, \"that the NRO detected NASA activity up there acouple weeks ago and ran an inquiry.\"Tench frowned. He's pissed. \"Yes, I know. And yet –\"\"NASA told us it was nothing. They said they were running some kind of extremeenvironment training exercises. Testing equipment, that sort of thing.\"Pickering paused. \"We bought the lie.\"\"Let's not call it a lie,\" Tench said. \"More of a necessary misdirection.Considering the magnitude of the discovery, I trust you understand NASA's needto keep this quiet.\"\"From the public, perhaps.\"Pouting was not in the repertoire of men like William Pickering, and Tenchsensed this was as close as he would get. \"I only have a minute,\" Tench said,working to retain her dominant position, \"but I thought I should call and warnyou.\"\"Warn me?\" Pickering waxed wry momentarily. \"Has Zach Herney decided to appointa new, NASA-friendly NRO director?\"\"Of course not. The President understands your criticisms of NASA are simplyissues of security, and he is working to plug those holes. I'm actually callingabout one of your employees.\" She paused. \"Rachel Sexton. Have you heard fromher this evening?\"\"No. I sent her to the White House this morning at the President's request.You've obviously kept her busy. She has yet to check in.\"Tench was relieved to have gotten to Pickering first. She took a drag on hercigarette and spoke as calmly as possible. \"I suspect you may be getting a callfrom Ms. Sexton sometime soon.\"\"Good. I've been expecting one. I've got to tell you, when the President's pressconference began, I was concerned Zach Herney might have convinced Ms. Sexton toparticipate publicly. I'm pleased to see he resisted.\"\"Zach Herney is a decent person,\" Tench said, \"which is more than I can say forRachel Sexton.\"There was a long pause on the line. \"I hope I misunderstood that.\"Tench sighed heavily. \"No, sir, I'm afraid you did not. I'd prefer not to talkspecifics on the phone, but Rachel Sexton, it seems, has decided she wants toundermine the credibility of this NASA announcement. I have no idea why, butafter she reviewed and endorsed NASA's data earlier this afternoon, she hassuddenly pulled an about-face and is spouting some of the most improbableallegations imaginable of NASA treachery and fraud.\"Pickering sounded intense now. \"Excuse me?\"\"Troubling, yes. I hate to be the one to tell you this, but Ms. Sexton contactedme two minutes before the press conference and warned me to cancel the wholething.\"\"On what grounds?\"\"Absurd ones, frankly. She said she'd found serious flaws in the data.\"Pickering's long silence was more wary than Tench would have liked. \"Flaws?\" hefinally said.\"Ridiculous, really, after two full weeks of NASA experimentation and –\"\"I find it very hard to believe someone like Rachel Sexton would have told youto postpone the President's press conference unless she had a damn good reason.\"Pickering sounded troubled. \"Maybe you should have listened to her.\"\"Oh, please!\" Tench blurted, coughing. \"You saw the press conference. Themeteorite data was confirmed and reconfirmed by countless specialists. Includingcivilians. Doesn't it seem suspicious to you that Rachel Sexton – the daughterof the only man whom this announcement hurts – is suddenly changing her tune?\"\"It seems suspicious, Ms. Tench, only because I happen to know that Ms. Sextonand her father are barely civil to one another. I cannot imagine why RachelSexton would, after years of service to the President, suddenly decide to switchcamps and tell lies to support her father.\"\"Ambition, perhaps? I really don't know. Maybe the opportunity to be firstdaughter...\" Tench let it hang.Pickering's tone hardened instantly. \"Thin ice, Ms. Tench. Very thin.\"Tench scowled. What the hell did she expect? She was accusing a prominent memberof Pickering's staff of treason against the President. The man was going to bedefensive.\"Put her on,\" Pickering demanded. \"I'd like to speak to Ms. Sexton myself.\"\"I'm afraid that's impossible,\" Tench replied. \"She's not at the White House.\"\"Where is she?\"\"The President sent her to Milne this morning to examine the data firsthand. Shehas yet to return.\"Pickering sounded livid now. \"I was never informed –\"\"I do not have time for hurt pride, director. I have simply called as acourtesy. I wanted to warn you that Rachel Sexton has decided to pursue her ownagenda with respect to tonight's announcement. She will be looking for allies.If she contacts you, you would be wise to know that the White House is inpossession of a video taken earlier today in which she endorsed this meteoritedata in its entirety in front of the President, his cabinet, and his entirestaff. If now, for whatever motives she might have, Rachel Sexton attempts tobesmirch the good name of Zach Herney or of NASA, then I swear to you the WhiteHouse will see to it she falls hard and far.\" Tench waited a moment, to be sureher meaning had settled in. \"I expect you to repay the courtesy of this call byinforming me immediately if Rachel Sexton contacts you. She is attacking thePresident directly, and the White House intends to detain her for questioningbefore she does any serious damage. I will be waiting for your call, director.That's all. Good night.\"Marjorie Tench hung up, certain that William Pickering had never been talked tolike that in his life. At least now he knew she was serious.• • •On the top floor of the NRO, William Pickering stood at his window and staredinto the Virginia night. The call from Marjorie Tench had been deeply troubling.He chewed at his lip as he tried to assemble the pieces in his mind.\"Director?\" his secretary said, knocking quietly. \"You have another phone call.\"\"Not now,\" Pickering said absently.\"It's Rachel Sexton.\"Pickering wheeled. Tench was apparently a fortune-teller. \"Okay. Patch herthrough, right away.\"\"Actually, sir, it's an encrypted AV stream. Do you want to take it in theconference room?\"An AV stream? \"Where is she calling from?\"The secretary told him.Pickering stared. Bewildered, he hurried down the hall toward the conferenceroom. This was something he had to see.70The Charlotte's \"dead room\" – designed after a similar structure at BellLaboratories – was what was formally known as an anechoic chamber. An acousticalclean room containing no parallel or reflective surfaces, it absorbed sound with99.4 percent efficiency. Because of the acoustically conductive nature of metaland water, conversations onboard submarines were always vulnerable tointerception by nearby eavesdroppers or parasitic suction mics attached to theouter hull. The dead room was, in effect, a tiny chamber inside the submarinefrom which absolutely no sound could escape. All conversations inside thisinsulated box were entirely secure.The chamber looked like a walk-in closet whose ceiling, walls, and floor hadbeen completely covered with foam spires jutting inward from all directions. Itreminded Rachel of a cramped underwater cave where stalagmites had run wild,growing off every surface. Most unsettling, however, was the apparent lack of afloor.The floor was a taut, meshed chicken-wire grid strung horizontally across theroom like a fishing net, giving the inhabitants the feeling that they weresuspended midway up the wall. The mesh was rubberized and stiff beneath thefeet. As Rachel gazed down through the webbed flooring, she felt like she wascrossing a string bridge suspended over a surrealistic fractalized landscape.Three feet below, a forest of foam needles pointed ominously upward.Instantly upon entering Rachel had sensed the disorientating lifelessness to theair, as if every bit of energy had been sucked out. Her ears felt as if they'dbeen stuffed with cotton. Only her breath was audible inside her head. Shecalled out, and the effect was that of speaking into a pillow. The wallsabsorbed every reverberation, making the only perceivable vibrations thoseinside her head.Now the captain had departed, closing the padded door behind him. Rachel, Corky,and Tolland were seated in the center of the room at a small U-shaped table thatstood on long metal stilts that descended through the mesh. On the table wereaffixed several gooseneck microphones, headphones, and a video console with afish-eye camera on top. It looked like a mini–United Nations symposium.As someone who worked in the U.S. intelligence community – the world's foremostmanufacturers of hard laser microphones, underwater parabolic eavesdroppers, andother hypersensitive listening devices – Rachel was well aware there were fewplaces on earth where one could have a truly secure conversation. The dead roomwas apparently one of those places. The mics and headphones on the table enableda face-to-face \"conference call\" in which people could speak freely, knowing thevibrations of their words could not escape the room. Their voices, upon enteringthe microphones, would be heavily encrypted for their long journey through theatmosphere.\"Level check.\" The voice materialized suddenly inside their headphones, causingRachel, Tolland, and Corky to jump. \"Do you read me, Ms. Sexton?\"Rachel leaned into the microphone. \"Yes. Thank you.\" Whoever you are.\"I have Director Pickering on the line for you. He's accepting AV. I am signingoff now. You will have your data stream momentarily.\"Rachel heard the line go dead. There was a distant whirr of static and then arapid series of beeps and clicks in the headphones. With startling clarity, thevideo screen in front of them sprang to life, and Rachel saw Director Pickeringin the NRO conference room. He was alone. His head snapped up and he looked intoRachel's eyes.She felt oddly relieved to see him.\"Ms. Sexton,\" he said, his expression perplexed and troubled. \"What in the worldis going on?\"\"The meteorite, sir,\" Rachel said. \"I think we may have a serious problem.\"71Inside the Charlotte's dead room, Rachel Sexton introduced Michael Tolland andCorky Marlinson to Pickering. Then she took charge and launched into a quickaccount of the day's incredible chain of events.The NRO director sat motionless as he listened.Rachel told him about the bioluminescent plankton in the extraction pit, theirjourney onto the ice shelf and discovery of an insertion shaft beneath themeteorite, and finally of their sudden attack by a military team she suspectedwas Special Ops.William Pickering was known for his ability to listen to disturbing informationwithout so much as flinching an eye, and yet his gaze grew more and moretroubled with each progression in Rachel's story. She sensed disbelief and thenrage when she talked about Norah Mangor's murder and their own near-deathescape. Although Rachel wanted to voice her suspicions of the NASAadministrator's involvement, she knew Pickering well enough not to point fingerswithout evidence. She gave Pickering the story as cold hard facts. When she wasfinished, Pickering did not respond for several seconds.\"Ms. Sexton,\" he finally said, \"all of you...\" He moved his gaze to each ofthem. \"If what you're saying is true, and I cannot imagine why three of youwould lie about this, you are all very lucky to be alive.\"They all nodded in silence. The President had called in four civilianscientists... and two of them were now dead.Pickering heaved a disconsolate sigh, as if he had no idea what to say next. Theevents clearly made little sense. \"Is there any way,\" Pickering asked, \"thatthis insertion shaft you're seeing in that GPR printout is a naturalphenomenon?\"Rachel shook her head. \"It's too perfect.\" She unfolded the soggy GPR printoutand held it up in front of the camera. \"Flawless.\"Pickering studied the image, scowling in agreement. \"Don't let that out of yourhands.\"\"I called Marjorie Tench to warn her to stop the President,\" Rachel said. \"Butshe shut me down.\"\"I know. She told me.\"Rachel looked up, stunned. \"Marjorie Tench called you?\" That was fast.\"Just now. She's very concerned. She feels you are attempting some kind of stuntto discredit the President and NASA. Perhaps to help your father.\"Rachel stood up. She waved the GPR printout and motioned to her two companions.\"We were almost killed! Does this look like some kind of stunt? And why would I–\"Pickering held up his hands. \"Easy. What Ms. Tench failed to tell me was thatthere were three of you.\"Rachel could not recall if Tench had even given her time to mention Corky andTolland.\"Nor did she tell me you had physical evidence,\" Pickering said. \"I wasskeptical of her claims before I spoke to you, and now I am convinced she ismistaken. I do not doubt your claims. The question at this point is what it allmeans.\"There was a long silence.William Pickering rarely looked confused, but he shook his head, seeming lost.\"Let's assume for the moment that someone did insert this meteorite beneath theice. That begs the obvious issue of why. If NASA has a meteorite with fossils init, why would they, or anyone else for that matter, care where it is found?\"\"It appears,\" Rachel said, \"that the insertion was performed such that PODSwould make the discovery, and the meteorite would appear to be a fragment from aknown impact.\"\"The Jungersol Fall,\" Corky prompted.\"But of what value is the meteorite's association with a known impact?\"Pickering demanded, sounding almost mad. \"Aren't these fossils an astoundingdiscovery anywhere and anytime? No matter what meteoritic event they areassociated with?\"All three nodded.Pickering hesitated, looking displeased. \"Unless... of course...\"Rachel saw the wheels turning behind the director's eyes. He had found thesimplest explanation for placing the meteorite concurrent with the Jungersolstrata, but the simplest explanation was also the most troubling.\"Unless,\" Pickering continued, \"the careful placement was intended to lendcredibility to totally false data.\" He sighed, turning to Corky. \"Dr. Marlinson,what is the possibility that this meteorite is a counterfeit.\"\"Counterfeit, sir?\"\"Yes. A fake. Manufactured.\"\"A fake meteorite?\" Corky gave an awkward laugh. \"Utterly impossible! Thatmeteorite was examined by professionals. Myself included. Chemical scans,spectrograph, rubidium-strontium dating. It is unlike any kind of rock ever seenon earth. The meteorite is authentic. Any astrogeologist would agree.\"Pickering seemed to consider this a long time, gently stroking his tie. \"And yettaking into account the amount NASA has to gain from this discovery right now,the apparent signs of tampering with evidence, and your being attacked... thefirst and only logical conclusion I can draw is that this meteorite is awell-executed fraud.\"\"Impossible!\" Corky sounded angry now. \"With all respect, sir, meteorites arenot some Hollywood special effect that can be conjured up in a lab to fool abunch of unsuspecting astrophysicists. They are chemically complex objects withunique crystalline structures and element ratios!\"\"I am not challenging you, Dr. Marlinson. I am simply following a logical chainof analysis. Considering someone wanted to kill you to keep you from revealingit was inserted under the ice, I'm inclined to entertain all kinds of wildscenarios here. What specifically makes you certain this rock is indeed ameteorite?\"\"Specifically?\" Corky's voice cracked in the headphones. \"A flawless fusioncrust, the presence of chondrules, a nickel ratio unlike anything ever found onearth. If you're suggesting that someone tricked us by manufacturing this rockin a lab, then all I can say is that the lab was about 190 million years old.\"Corky dug in his pocket and pulled out a stone shaped like a CD. He held it infront of the camera. \"We chemically dated samples like this with numerousmethods. Rubidium-strontium dating is not something you can fake!\"Pickering looked surprised. \"You have a sample?\"Corky shrugged. \"NASA had dozens of them floating around.\"\"You mean to tell me,\" Pickering said, looking at Rachel now, \"that NASAdiscovered a meteorite they think contains life, and they're letting people walkoff with samples?\"\"The point,\" Corky said, \"is that the sample in my hands is genuine.\" He heldthe rock close to the camera. \"You could give this to any petrologist orgeologist or astronomer on earth, they would run tests, and they would tell youtwo things: one, it is 190 million years old; and two, it is chemicallydissimilar from the kind of rock we have here on earth.\"Pickering leaned forward, studying the fossil embedded in the rock. He seemedmomentarily transfixed. Finally, he sighed. \"I am not a scientist. All I can sayis that if that meteorite is genuine, which it appears it is, I would like toknow why NASA didn't present it to the world at face value? Why has someonecarefully placed it under the ice as if to persuade us of its authenticity?\"At that moment, inside the White House, a security officer was dialing MarjorieTench.The senior adviser answered on the first ring. \"Yeah?\"\"Ms. Tench,\" the officer said, \"I have the information you requested earlier.The radiophone call that Rachel Sexton placed to you earlier this evening. Wehave the trace.\"\"Tell me.\"\"Secret Service ops says the signal originated aboard the naval submarine U.S.S.Charlotte.\"\"What!\"\"They don't have coordinates, ma'am, but they are certain of the vessel code.\"\"Oh, for Christ's sake!\" Tench slammed down the receiver without another word.72The muted acoustics of the Charlotte's dead room were starting to make Rachelfeel mildly nauseated. On-screen, William Pickering's troubled gaze moved now toMichael Tolland. \"You're quiet, Mr. Tolland.\"Tolland glanced up like a student who had been called on unexpectedly. \"Sir?\"\"You just gave quite a convincing documentary on television,\" Pickering said.\"What's your take on the meteorite now?\"\"Well, sir,\" Tolland said, his discomfort obvious, \"I have to agree with Dr.Marlinson. I believe the fossils and meteorite are authentic. I'm fairly wellversed in dating techniques, and the age of that stone was confirmed by multipletests. The nickel content as well. These data cannot be forged. There exists nodoubt the rock, formed 190 million years ago, exhibits nonterrestrial nickelratios and contains dozens of confirmed fossils whose formation is also dated at190 million years. I can think of no other possible explanation than that NASAhas found an authentic meteorite.\"Pickering fell silent now. His expression was one of quandary, a look Rachel hadnever before seen on William Pickering.\"What should we do, sir?\" Rachel asked. \"Obviously we need to alert thePresident there are problems with the data.\"Pickering frowned. \"Let's hope the President doesn't already know.\"Rachel felt a knot rise in her throat. Pickering's implication was clear.President Herney could be involved. Rachel strongly doubted it, and yet both thePresident and NASA had plenty to gain here.\"Unfortunately,\" Pickering said, \"with the exception of this GPR printoutrevealing an insertion shaft, all of the scientific data points to a credibleNASA discovery.\" He paused, dire. \"And this issue of your being attacked...\" Helooked up at Rachel. \"You mentioned special ops.\"\"Yes, sir.\" She told him again about the Improvised Munitions and tactics.Pickering looked more and more unhappy by the moment. Rachel sensed her boss wascontemplating the number of people who might have access to a small militarykill force. Certainly the President had access. Probably Marjorie Tench too, assenior adviser. Quite possibly NASA administrator Lawrence Ekstrom with his tiesto the Pentagon. Unfortunately, as Rachel considered the myriad ofpossibilities, she realized the controlling force behind the attack could havebeen almost anyone with high-level political clout and the right connections.\"I could phone the President right now,\" Pickering said, \"but I don't thinkthat's wise, at least until we know who's involved. My ability to protect youbecomes limited once we involve the White House. In addition, I'm not sure whatI would tell him. If the meteorite is real, which you all feel it is, then yourallegation of an insertion shaft and attack doesn't make sense; the Presidentwould have every right to question the validity of my claim.\" He paused as ifcalculating the options. \"Regardless... whatever the truth is or who the playersare, some very powerful people will take hits if this information goes public. Isuggest we get you to safety right away, before we start rocking any boats.\"Get us to safety? The comment surprised Rachel. \"I think we're fairly safe on anuclear submarine, sir.\"Pickering looked skeptical. \"Your presence on that submarine won't stay secretlong. I'm pulling you out immediately. Frankly, I'll feel better when the threeof you are sitting in my office.\"73Senator Sexton huddled alone on his couch feeling like a refugee. His WestbrookePlace apartment that had only an hour ago been filled with new friends andsupporters now looked forsaken, scattered with the rubble of snifters andbusiness cards, abandoned by men who had quite literally dashed out the door.Now Sexton crouched in solitude before his television, wanting more thananything to turn it off and yet being unable to pull himself from the endlessmedia analyses. This was Washington, and it didn't take long for the analysts torush through their pseudoscientific and philosophical hyperbole and lock in onthe ugly stuff – the politics. Like torture masters rubbing acid in Sexton'swounds, the newscasters were stating and restating the obvious.\"Hours ago, Sexton's campaign was soaring,\" one analyst said. \"Now, with NASA'sdiscovery, the senator's campaign has crashed back to earth.\"Sexton winced, reaching for the Courvoisier and taking a hit right out of thebottle. Tonight, he knew, would be the longest and loneliest night of his life.He despised Marjorie Tench for setting him up. He despised Gabrielle Ashe forever mentioning NASA in the first place. He despised the President for being sogoddamned lucky. And he despised the world for laughing at him.\"Obviously, this is devastating for the senator,\" the analyst was saying. \"ThePresident and NASA have claimed an incalculable triumph with this discovery.News like this would revitalize the President's campaign regardless of Sexton'sposition on NASA, but with Sexton's admission today that he would go so far asto abolish NASA funding outright if need be... well, this presidentialannouncement is a one-two punch from which the senator will not recover.\"I was tricked, Sexton said. The White House fucking set me up.The analyst was smiling now. \"All of the credibility NASA has lost withAmericans recently has just been restored in spades. There's a real feeling ofnational pride out there on the streets right now.\"\"As there should be. They love Zach Herney, and they were losing faith. You'vegot to admit, the President was lying down and took some pretty big hitsrecently, but he's come out of it smelling like a rose.\"Sexton thought of the CNN debate that afternoon and hung his head, thinking hemight be sick to his stomach. All of the NASA inertia he had so carefully builtup over the last months had not only come to a screeching halt, but it hadbecome an anchor around his neck. He looked like a fool. He'd been brazenlyplayed by the White House. He was already dreading all the cartoons intomorrow's paper. His name would be the punch line to every joke in the country.Obviously, there would be no more quiet SFF campaign funding. Everything hadchanged. All of the men who had been in his apartment had just seen their dreamsgo down the toilet. The privatization of space had just struck a brick wall.Taking another hit of cognac, the senator stood up and walked unevenly to hisdesk. He gazed down at the unhooked phone receiver. Knowing it was an act ofmasochistic self-flagellation, he slowly replaced the phone receiver in itscradle and began counting the seconds.One... two... The phone rang. He let the machine pick up.\"Senator Sexton, Judy Oliver from CNN. I'd like to give you an opportunity toreact to the NASA discovery this evening. Please call me.\" She hung up.Sexton started counting again. One... The phone started ringing. He ignored it,letting the machine get it. Another reporter.Holding his bottle of Courvoisier, Sexton wandered toward the sliding door ofhis balcony. He pulled it aside and stepped out into the cool air. Leaningagainst the railing, he gazed out across town to the illuminated facade of theWhite House in the distance. The lights seemed to twinkle gleefully in the wind.Bastards, he thought. For centuries we've been looking for proof of life in theheavens. Now we find it in the same fucking year as my election? This wasn'tpropitious, this was goddamned clairvoyant. Every apartment window for as far asSexton could see had a television on. Sexton wondered where Gabrielle Ashe wastonight. This was all her fault. She'd fed him NASA failure after NASA failure.He raised the bottle to take another swig.Goddamned Gabrielle... she's the reason I'm in this so deep.Across town, standing amid the chaos of the ABC production room, Gabrielle Ashefelt numb. The President's announcement had come out of left field, leaving hersuspended in a semicatatonic haze. She stood, lock-kneed in the center of theproduction room floor, staring up at one of the television monitors whilepandemonium raged around her.The initial seconds of the announcement had brought dead silence to the newsroomfloor. It had lasted only moments before the place erupted into a deafeningcarnival of scrambling reporters. These people were professionals. They had notime for personal reflection. There would be time for that after the work wasdone. At the moment, the world wanted to know more, and ABC had to provide it.This story had everything – science, history, political drama – an emotionalmother lode. Nobody in the media was sleeping tonight.\"Gabs?\" Yolanda's voice was sympathetic. \"Let's get you back into my officebefore someone realizes who you are and starts grilling you on what this meansfor Sexton's campaign.\"Gabrielle felt herself guided through a haze into Yolanda's glass-walled office.Yolanda sat her down and handed her a glass of water. She tried to force asmile. \"Look on the bright side, Gabs. Your candidate's campaign is fucked, butat least you're not.\"\"Thanks. Terrific.\"Yolanda's tone turned serious. \"Gabrielle, I know you feel like shit. Yourcandidate just got hit by a Mack truck, and if you ask me, he's not getting up.At least not in time to turn this thing around. But at least nobody's splashingyour picture all over the television. Seriously. This is good news. Herney won'tneed a sex scandal now. He's looking far too presidential right now to talksex.\"It seemed a small consolation to Gabrielle.\"As for Tench's allegations of Sexton's illegal campaign finance...\" Yolandashook her head. \"I have my doubts. Granted, Herney is serious about no negativecampaigning. And granted, a bribery investigation would be bad for the country.But is Herney really so patriotic that he would forgo a chance to crush hisopposition, simply to protect national morale? My guess is Tench stretched thetruth about Sexton's finances in an effort to scare. She gambled, hoping you'djump ship and give the President a free sex scandal. And you've got to admit,Gabs, tonight would have been a hell of a night for Sexton's morals to come intoquestion!\"Gabrielle nodded vaguely. A sex scandal would have been a one-two punch fromwhich Sexton's career never would have recovered... ever.\"You outlasted her, Gabs. Marjorie Tench went fishing, but you didn't bite.You're home free. There'll be other elections.\"Gabrielle nodded vaguely, unsure what to believe anymore.\"You've got to admit,\" Yolanda said, \"the White House played Sexton brilliantly– luring him down the NASA path, getting him to commit, coaxing him to put allhis eggs in the NASA basket.\"Totally my fault, Gabrielle thought.\"And this announcement we just watched, my God, it was genius! The importance ofthe discovery entirely aside, the production values were brilliant. Live feedsfrom the Arctic? A Michael Tolland documentary? Good God, how can you compete?Zach Herney nailed it tonight. There's a reason the guy is President.\"And will be for another four years...\"I've got to get back to work, Gabs,\" Yolanda said. \"You sit right there as longas you want. Get your feet under you.\" Yolanda headed out the door. \"Hon, I'llcheck back in a few minutes.\"Alone now, Gabrielle sipped her water, but it tasted foul. Everything did. It'sall my fault, she thought, trying to ease her conscience by reminding herself ofall the glum NASA press conferences of the past year – the space stationsetbacks, the postponement of the X-33, all the failed Mars probes, continuousbudget bailouts. Gabrielle wondered what she could have done differently.Nothing, she told herself. You did everything right.It had simply backfired.74The thundering navy SeaHawk chopper had been scrambled under a covert operationstatus out of Thule Air Force Base in northern Greenland. It stayed low, out ofradar range, as it shot through the gale winds across seventy miles of open sea.Then, executing the bizarre orders they had been given, the pilots fought thewind and brought the craft to a hover above a pre-ordained set of coordinates onthe empty ocean.\"Where's the rendezvous?\" the copilot yelled, confused. They had been told tobring a chopper with a rescue winch, so he anticipated a search-and-retrieveoperation. \"You sure these are the right coordinates?\" He scanned the choppyseas with a searchlight, but there was nothing below them except –\"Holy shit!\" The pilot pulled back on the stick, jolting upward.The black mountain of steel rose before them out of the waves without warning. Agargantuan unmarked submarine blew its ballast and rose on a cloud of bubbles.The pilots exchanged uneasy laughs. \"Guess that's them.\"As ordered, the transaction proceeded under complete radio silence. Thedoublewide portal on the peak of the sail opened and a seaman flashed themsignals with a strobe light. The chopper then moved over the sub and dropped athree-man rescue harness, essentially three rubberized loops on a retractablecable. Within sixty seconds, the three unknown \"danglers\" were swinging beneaththe chopper, ascending slowly against the downdraft of the rotors.When the copilot hauled them aboard – two men and a woman – the pilot flashedthe sub the \"all clear.\" Within seconds, the enormous vessel disappeared beneaththe windswept sea, leaving no trace it had ever been there.With the passengers safely aboard, the chopper pilot faced front, dipped thenose of the chopper, and accelerated south to complete his mission. The stormwas closing fast, and these three strangers were to be brought safely back toThule AFB for further jet transport. Where they were headed, the pilot had noidea. All he knew was that his orders had been from high up, and he wastransporting very precious cargo.75When the Milne storm finally exploded, unleashing its full force on the NASAhabisphere, the dome shuddered as if ready to lift off the ice and launch out tosea. The steel stabilizing cables pulled taut against their stakes, vibratinglike huge guitar strings and letting out a doleful drone. The generators outsidestuttered, causing the lights to flicker, threatening to plunge the huge roominto total blackness.NASA administrator Lawrence Ekstrom strode across the interior of the dome. Hewished he were getting the hell out of here tonight, but that was not to be. Hewould remain another day, giving additional on-site press conferences in themorning and overseeing preparations to transport the meteorite back toWashington. He wanted nothing more at the moment than to get some sleep; theday's unexpected problems had taken a lot out of him.Ekstrom's thoughts turned yet again to Wailee Ming, Rachel Sexton, Norah Mangor,Michael Tolland, and Corky Marlinson. Some of the NASA staff had begun noticingthe civilians were missing.Relax, Ekstrom told himself. Everything is under control.He breathed deeply, reminding himself that everyone on the planet was excitedabout NASA and space right now. Extraterrestrial life hadn't been this excitinga topic since the famous \"Roswell incident\" back in 1947 – the alleged crash ofan alien spaceship in Roswell, New Mexico, which was now the shrine to millionsof UFO-conspiracy theorists even today.During Ekstrom's years working at the Pentagon, he had learned that the Roswellincident had been nothing more than a military accident during a classifiedoperation called Project Mogul – the flight test of a spy balloon being designedto listen in on Russian atomic tests. A prototype, while being tested, haddrifted off course and crashed in the New Mexico desert. Unfortunately, acivilian found the wreckage before the military did.Unsuspecting rancher William Brazel had stumbled across a debris field ofradical synthesized neoprene and lightweight metals unlike anything he'd everseen, and he immediately called in the sheriff. Newspapers carried the story ofthe bizarre wreckage, and public interest grew fast. Fueled by the military'sdenial that the wreckage was theirs, reporters launched investigations, and thecovert status of Project Mogul came into serious jeopardy. Just as it seemed thesensitive issue of a spy balloon was about to be revealed, something wonderfulhappened.The media drew an unexpected conclusion. They decided the scraps of futuristicsubstance could only have come from an extraterrestrial source – creatures morescientifically advanced than humans. The military's denial of the incidentobviously had to be one thing only – a cover-up of contact with aliens! Althoughbaffled by this new hypothesis, the air force was not about to look a gift horsein the mouth. They grabbed the alien story and ran with it; the world'ssuspicion that aliens were visiting New Mexico was far less a threat to nationalsecurity than that of the Russians catching wind of Project Mogul.To fuel the alien cover story, the intelligence community shrouded the Roswellincident in secrecy and began orchestrating \"security leaks\" – quiet murmuringsof alien contacts, recovered spaceships, and even a mysterious \"Hangar 18\" atDayton's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base where the government was keeping alienbodies on ice. The world bought the story, and Roswell fever swept the globe.From that moment on, whenever a civilian mistakenly spotted an advanced U.S.military aircraft, the intelligence community simply dusted off the oldconspiracy.That's not an aircraft, that's an alien spaceship!Ekstrom was amazed to think this simple deception was still working today. Everytime the media reported a sudden flurry of UFO sightings, Ekstrom had to laugh.Chances were some lucky civilian had caught a glimpse of one of the NRO'sfifty-seven fast-moving, unmanned reconnaissance aircraft known as Global Hawks– oblong, remote-controlled aircraft that looked like nothing else in the sky.Ekstrom found it pathetic that countless tourists still made pilgrimages to theNew Mexico desert to scan the night skies with their video cameras. Occasionallyone got lucky and captured \"hard evidence\" of a UFO – bright lights flittingaround the sky with more maneuverability and speed than any aircraft humans hadever built. What these people failed to realize, of course, was that thereexisted a twelve-year lag between what the government could build and what thepublic knew about. These UFO-gazers were simply catching a glimpse of the nextgeneration of U.S. aircraft being developed out at Area 51 – many of which werethe brainstorms of NASA engineers. Of course, intelligence officials nevercorrected the misconception; it was obviously preferable that the world readabout another UFO sighting than to have people learn the U.S. military's trueflight capabilities.But everything has changed now, Ekstrom thought. In a few hours, theextraterrestrial myth would become a confirmed reality, forever.\"Administrator?\" A NASA technician hurried across the ice behind him. \"You havean emergency secure call in the PSC.\"Ekstrom sighed, turning. What the hell could it be now? He headed for thecommunications trailer.The technician hurried along beside him. \"The guys manning the radar in the PSCwere curious, sir...\"\"Yeah?\" Ekstrom's thoughts were still far away.\"The fat-body sub stationed off the coast here? We were wondering why you didn'tmention it to us.\"Ekstrom glanced up. \"I'm sorry?\"\"The submarine, sir? You could have at least told the guys on radar. Additionalseaboard security is understandable, but it took our radar team off guard.\"Ekstrom stopped short. \"What submarine?\"The technician stopped now too, clearly not expecting the administrator'ssurprise. \"She's not part of our operation?\"\"No! Where is it?\"The technician swallowed hard. \"About three miles out. We caught her on radar bychance. Only surfaced for a couple minutes. Pretty big blip. Had to be afat-body. We figured you'd asked the navy to stand watch over this op withouttelling any of us.\"Ekstrom stared. \"I most certainly did not!\"Now the technician's voice wavered. \"Well, sir, then I guess I should inform youthat a sub just rendezvoused with an aircraft right off the coast here. Lookedlike a personnel change. Actually, we were all pretty impressed anyone wouldattempt a wet-dry vertical in this kind of wind.\"Ekstrom felt his muscles stiffen. What the hell is a submarine doing directlyoff the coast of Ellesmere Island without my knowledge? \"Did you see whatdirection the aircraft flew after rendezvous?\"\"Back toward Thule air base. For connecting transport to the mainland, Iassume.\"Ekstrom said nothing the rest of the way to the PSC. When he entered the crampeddarkness, the hoarse voice on the line had a familiar rasp.\"We've got a problem,\" Tench said, coughing as she spoke. \"It's about RachelSexton.\"76Senator Sexton was not sure how long he had been staring into space when heheard the pounding. When he realized the throbbing in his ears was not from thealcohol but rather from someone at his apartment door, he got up from the couch,stowed the bottle of Courvoisier, and made his way to the foyer.\"Who is it?\" Sexton yelled, in no mood for visitors.His bodyguard's voice called in with the identity of Sexton's unexpected guest.Sexton sobered instantly. That was fast. Sexton had hoped not to have to havethis conversation until morning.Taking a deep breath and straightening his hair, Sexton opened the door. Theface before him was all too familiar – tough and leathery despite the man'sseventy-something years. Sexton had met with him only this morning in the whiteFord Windstar minivan in a hotel parking garage. Was it only this morning?Sexton wondered. God, how things had changed since then.\"May I come in?\" the dark-haired man asked.Sexton stepped aside, allowing the head of the Space Frontier Foundation topass.\"Did the meeting go well?\" the man asked, as Sexton closed the door.Did it go well? Sexton wondered if the man lived in a cocoon. \"Things wereterrific until the President came on television.\"The old man nodded, looking displeased. \"Yes. An incredible victory. It willhurt our cause greatly.\"Hurt our cause? Here was an optimist. With NASA's triumph tonight, this guywould be dead and buried before the Space Frontier Foundation attained theirgoals of privatization.\"For years I have suspected proof was forthcoming,\" the old man said. \"I did notknow how or when, but sooner or later we had to know for sure.\"Sexton was stunned. \"You're not surprised?\"\"The mathematics of the cosmos virtually requires other life-forms,\" the mansaid, moving toward Sexton's den. \"I am not surprised that this discovery hasbeen made. Intellectually, I am thrilled. Spiritually, I am in awe. Politically,I am deeply disturbed. The timing could not be worse.\"Sexton wondered why the man had come. It sure as hell wasn't to cheer him up.\"As you know,\" the man said, \"SFF member companies have spent millions trying toopen the frontier of space to private citizens. Recently, much of that money hasgone to your campaign.\"Sexton felt suddenly defensive. \"I had no control over tonight's fiasco. TheWhite House baited me to attack NASA!\"\"Yes. The President played the game well. And yet, all may not be lost.\" Therewas an odd glint of hope in the old man's eyes.He's senile, Sexton decided. All was definitely lost. Every station ontelevision right now was talking about the destruction of the Sexton campaign.The old man showed himself into the den, sat on the couch, and fixed his tiredeyes on the senator. \"Do you recall,\" the man said, \"the problems NASA initiallyhad with the anomaly software onboard the PODS satellite?\"Sexton could not imagine where this was headed. What the hell difference doesthat make now? PODS found a goddamned meteorite with fossils!\"If you remember,\" the man said. \"The onboard software did not function properlyat first. You made a big deal of it in the press.\"\"As I should have!\" Sexton said, sitting down opposite the man. \"It was anotherNASA failure!\"The man nodded. \"I agree. But shortly after that, NASA held a press conferenceannouncing they had come up with a work-around – some sort of patch for thesoftware.\"Sexton hadn't actually seen the press conference, but he'd heard it was short,flat, and hardly newsworthy – the PODS project leader giving a dull technicaldescription of how NASA had overcome a minor glitch in PODS's anomaly-detectionsoftware and gotten everything up and running.\"I have been watching PODS with interest ever since it failed,\" the man said. Heproduced a videocassette and walked to Sexton's television, putting the video inthe VCR. \"This should interest you.\"The video began to play. It showed the NASA press room at headquarters inWashington. A well-dressed man was taking the podium and greeting the audience.The subtitle beneath the podium read:CHRIS HARPER, Section ManagerPolar Orbiting Density Scanner Satellite (PODS)Chris Harper was tall, refined, and spoke with the quiet dignity of a EuropeanAmerican who still clung proudly to his roots. His accent was erudite andpolished. He was addressing the press with confidence, giving them some bad newsabout PODS.\"Although the PODS satellite is in orbit and functioning well, we have a minorsetback with the onboard computers. A minor programming error for which I takefull responsibility. Specifically, the FIR filter has a faulty voxel index,which means the PODS's anomaly-detection software is not functioning properly.We're working on a fix.\"The crowd sighed, apparently accustomed to NASA letdowns. \"What does that meanfor the current effectiveness of the satellite?\" someone asked.Harper took it like a pro. Confident and matter-of-fact. \"Imagine a perfect setof eyes without a functioning brain. Essentially the PODS satellite is seeingtwenty-twenty, but it has no idea what it's looking at. The purpose of the PODSmission is to look for melt pockets in the polar ice cap, but without thecomputer to analyze the density data PODS receives from its scanners, PODScannot discern where the points of interest are. We should have the situationremedied after the next shuttle mission can make an adjustment to the onboardcomputer.\"A groan of disappointment rose in the room.The old man glanced over at Sexton. \"He presents bad news pretty well, doesn'the?\"\"He's from NASA,\" Sexton grumbled. \"That's what they do.\"The VCR tape went blank for an instant and then switched to another NASA pressconference.\"This second press conference,\" the old man said to Sexton, \"was given only afew weeks ago. Quite late at night. Few people saw it. This time Dr. Harper isannouncing good news.\"The footage launched. This time Chris Harper looked disheveled and uneasy. \"I ampleased to announce,\" Harper said, sounding anything but pleased, \"that NASA hasfound a work-around for the PODS satellite's software problem.\" He fumbledthrough an explanation of the work-around – something about redirecting the rawdata from PODS and sending it through computers here on earth rather thanrelying on the onboard PODS computer. Everyone seemed impressed. It all soundedquite feasible and exciting. When Harper was done, the room gave him anenthusiastic round of applause.\"So we can expect data soon?\" someone in the audience asked.Harper nodded, sweating. \"A couple of weeks.\"More applause. Hands shot up around the room.\"That's all I have for you now,\" Harper said, looking ill as he packed up hispapers. \"PODS is up and running. We'll have data soon.\" He practically ran offthe stage.Sexton scowled. He had to admit, this was odd. Why did Chris Harper look socomfortable giving bad news and so uncomfortable giving good news? It shouldhave been in reverse. Sexton hadn't actually seen this press conference when itaired, although he'd read about the software fix. The fix, at the time, seemedan inconsequential NASA salvage; the public perception remained unimpressed –PODS was just another NASA project that had malfunctioned and was beingawkwardly patched together with a less than ideal solution.The old man turned off the television. \"NASA claimed Dr. Harper was not feelingwell that night.\" He paused. \"I happen to think Harper was lying.\"Lying? Sexton stared, his fuzzy thoughts unable to piece together any logicalrationale for why Harper would have lied about the software. Still, Sexton hadtold enough lies in his life to recognize a poor liar when he saw one. He had toadmit, Dr. Harper sure looked suspicious.\"Perhaps you don't realize?\" the old man said. \"This little announcement youjust heard Chris Harper give is the single most important press conference inNASA history.\" He paused. \"That convenient software fix he just described iswhat allowed PODS to find the meteorite.\"Sexton puzzled. And you think he was lying about it? \"But, if Harper was lying,and the PODS software isn't really working, then how the hell did NASA find themeteorite?\"The old man smiled. \"Exactly.\"77The U.S. military's fleet of \"repo\" aircraft repossessed during drug-tradearrests consisted of over a dozen private jets, including three reconditionedG4s used for transporting military VIPs. A half hour ago, one of those G4s hadlifted off the Thule runway, fought its way above the storm, and was nowpounding southward into the Canadian night en route to Washington. Onboard,Rachel Sexton, Michael Tolland, and Corky Marlinson had the eight-seat cabin tothemselves, looking like some kind of disheveled sports team in their matchingblue U.S.S. Charlotte jumpsuits and caps.Despite the roar of the Grumman engines, Corky Marlinson was asleep in the rear.Tolland sat near the front, looking exhausted as he gazed out the window at thesea. Rachel was beside him, knowing she could not sleep even if she'd beensedated. Her mind churned through the mystery of the meteorite, and, mostrecently, the dead room conversation with Pickering. Before signing off,Pickering had given Rachel two additional pieces of disturbing information.First, Marjorie Tench claimed to possess a video recording of Rachel's privatedeposition to the White House staff. Tench was now threatening to use the videoas evidence if Rachel tried to go back on her confirmation of the meteoritedata. The news was particularly unsettling because Rachel had specifically toldZach Herney that her remarks to the staff were for in-house use only. ApparentlyZach Herney had ignored that request.The second bit of troubling news dealt with a CNN debate her father had attendedearlier in the afternoon. Apparently, Marjorie Tench had made a rare appearanceand deftly baited Rachel's father into crystallizing his position against NASA.More specifically, Tench had cajoled him into crudely proclaiming his skepticismthat extraterrestrial life would ever be found.Eat his hat? That's what Pickering said her father had offered to do if NASAever found extraterrestrial life. Rachel wondered how Tench had managed to coaxout that propitious little sound bite. Clearly, the White House had been settingthe stage carefully – ruthlessly lining up all the dominoes, preparing for thebig Sexton collapse. The President and Marjorie Tench, like some sort ofpolitical tag team wrestling duo, had maneuvered for the kill. While thePresident remained dignified outside the ring, Tench had moved in, circling,cunningly lining up the senator for the presidential body slam.The President had told Rachel he'd asked NASA to delay announcing the discoveryin order to provide time to confirm the accuracy of the data. Rachel nowrealized there were other advantages to waiting. The extra time had given theWhite House time to dole out the rope with which the senator would hang himself.Rachel felt no sympathy for her father, and yet she now realized that beneaththe warm and fuzzy exterior of President Zach Herney, a shrewd shark lurked. Youdid not become the most powerful man in the world without a killer instinct. Thequestion now was whether this shark was an innocent bystander – or a player.Rachel stood, stretching her legs. As she paced the aisle of the plane, she feltfrustrated that the pieces to this puzzle seemed so contradictory. Pickering,with his trademark chaste logic, had concluded the meteorite must be fake. Corkyand Tolland, with scientific assurance, insisted the meteorite was authentic.Rachel only knew what she had seen – a charred, fossilized rock being pulledfrom the ice.Now, as she passed beside Corky, she gazed down at the astrophysicist, batteredfrom his ordeal on the ice. The swelling on his cheek was going down now, andthe stitches looked good. He was asleep, snoring, his pudgy hands clutching thedisk-shaped meteorite sample like some kind of security blanket.Rachel reached down and gently slipped the meteorite sample away from him. Sheheld it up, studying the fossils again. Remove all assumptions, she toldherself, forcing herself to reorganize her thoughts. Reestablish the chain ofsubstantiation. It was an old NRO trick. Rebuilding a proof from scratch was aprocess known as a \"null start\" – something all data analysts practiced when thepieces didn't quite fit.Reassemble the proof.She began pacing again.Does this stone represent proof of extraterrestrial life?Proof, she knew, was a conclusion built on a pyramid of facts, a broad base ofaccepted information on which more specific assertions were made.Remove all the base assumptions. Start again.What do we have?A rock.She pondered that for a moment. A rock. A rock with fossilized creatures.Walking back toward the front of the plane, she took her seat beside MichaelTolland.\"Mike, let's play a game.\"Tolland turned from the window, looking distant, apparently deep in his ownthoughts. \"A game?\"She handed him the meteorite sample. \"Let's pretend you're seeing thisfossilized rock for the first time. I've told you nothing about where it camefrom or how it was found. What would you tell me it is?\"Tolland heaved a disconsolate sigh. \"Funny you should ask. I just had thestrangest thought...\"Hundreds of miles behind Rachel and Tolland, a strange-looking aircraft stayedlow as it tore south above a deserted ocean. Onboard, the Delta Force wassilent. They had been pulled out of locations in a hurry, but never like this.Their controller was furious.Earlier, Delta-One had informed the controller that unexpected events on the iceshelf had left his team with no option but to exercise force – force that hadincluded killing four civilians, including Rachel Sexton and Michael Tolland.The controller reacted with shock. Killing, although an authorized last resort,obviously never had been part of the controller's plan.Later, the controller's displeasure over the killings turned to outright ragewhen he learned the assassinations had not gone as planned.\"Your team failed!\" the controller seethed, the androgynous tone hardly maskingthe person's rage. \"Three of your four targets are still alive!\"Impossible! Delta-One had thought. \"But we witnessed –\"\"They made contact with a submarine and are now en route to Washington.\"\"What!\"The controller's tone turned lethal. \"Listen carefully. I am about to give younew orders. And this time you will not fail.\"78Senator Sexton was actually feeling a flicker of hope as he walked hisunexpected visitor back out to the elevator. The head of the SFF, as it turnedout, had not come to chastise Sexton, but rather to give him a pep talk and tellhim the battle was not yet over.A possible chink in NASA's armor.The videotape of the bizarre NASA press conference had convinced Sexton that theold man was right – PODS mission director Chris Harper was lying. But why? Andif NASA never fixed the PODS software, how did NASA find the meteorite?As they walked to the elevator, the old man said, \"Sometimes all it takes tounravel something is a single strand. Perhaps we can find a way to eat away atNASA's victory from within. Cast a shadow of distrust. Who knows where it willlead?\" The old man locked his tired eyes on Sexton. \"I am not ready to lay downand die, senator. And I trust nor are you.\"\"Of course not,\" Sexton said, mustering resolve in his voice. \"We've come toofar.\"\"Chris Harper lied about fixing PODS,\" the man said as he boarded the elevator.\"And we need to know why.\"\"I will get that information as fast as I can,\" Sexton replied. I have just theperson.\"Good. Your future depends on it.\"As Sexton headed back toward his apartment, his step was a little lighter, hishead a little clearer. NASA lied about PODS. The only question was how Sextoncould prove it.His thoughts had already turned to Gabrielle Ashe. Wherever she was at themoment, she had to be feeling like shit. Gabrielle had no doubt seen the pressconference and was now standing on a ledge somewhere getting ready to jump. Herproposition of making NASA a major issue in Sexton's campaign had turned out tobe the biggest mistake of Sexton's career.She owes me, Sexton thought. And she knows it.Gabrielle already had proven she had a knack for obtaining NASA secrets. She hasa contact, Sexton thought. She'd been scoring insider information for weeks now.Gabrielle had connections she was not sharing. Connections she could pump forinformation on PODS. Moreover, tonight Gabrielle would be motivated. She had adebt to repay, and Sexton suspected she would do anything to regain his favor.As Sexton arrived back at his apartment door, his bodyguard nodded. \"Evening,senator. I trust I did the right thing by letting Gabrielle in earlier? She saidit was critical she talk to you.\"Sexton paused. \"I'm sorry?\"\"Ms. Ashe? She had important information for you earlier tonight. That's why Ilet her in.\"Sexton felt his body stiffen. He looked at his apartment door. What the hell isthis guy talking about?The guard's expression changed to one of confusion and concern. \"Senator, areyou okay? You remember, right? Gabrielle arrived during your meeting. She talkedto you, right? She must have. She was in there quite a while.\"Sexton stared a long moment, feeling his pulse skyrocket. This moron letGabrielle into my apartment during a private SFF meeting? She stuck aroundinside and then departed without a word? Sexton could only imagine whatGabrielle might have overheard. Swallowing his anger, he forced a smile to hisguard. \"Oh, yes! I'm sorry. I'm exhausted. Had a couple of drinks, too. Ms. Asheand I did indeed speak. You did the right thing.\"The guard looked relieved.\"Did she say where she went when she left?\"The guard shook his head. \"She was in a big hurry.\"\"Okay, thanks.\"Sexton entered his apartment fuming. How complicated were my goddamn directions?No visitors! He had to assume if Gabrielle had been inside for any length oftime and then snuck out without a word, she must have heard things she was notmeant to hear. Tonight of all nights.Senator Sexton knew above all he could not afford to lose Gabrielle Ashe'strust; women could become vengeful and stupid when they felt deceived. Sextonneeded to bring her back. Tonight more than ever, he needed her in his camp.79On the fourth floor of the ABC television studios, Gabrielle Ashe sat alone inYolanda's glass-walled office and stared at the fraying carpet. She had alwaysprided herself on good instincts and knowing whom she could trust. Now, for thefirst time in years, Gabrielle felt alone, uncertain which way to turn.The sound of her cellphone lifted her gaze from the carpet. Reluctant, shepicked up. \"Gabrielle Ashe.\"\"Gabrielle, it's me.\"She recognized the timbre of Senator Sexton's voice immediately, although hesounded surprisingly calm considering what had just transpired.\"It's been one hell of a night over here,\" he said, \"so just let me talk. I'msure you saw the President's conference. Christ, did we play the wrong cards.I'm sick over it. You're probably blaming yourself. Don't. Who the hell wouldhave guessed? Not your fault. Anyhow, listen up. I think there may be a way toget our feet back under us.\"Gabrielle stood up, unable to imagine what Sexton could be talking about. Thiswas hardly the reaction she had expected.\"I had a meeting tonight,\" Sexton said, \"with representatives from private spaceindustries, and –\"\"You did?\" Gabrielle blurted, stunned to hear him admit it. \"I mean... I had noidea.\"\"Yeah, nothing major. I would have asked you to sit in, but these guys aretouchy about privacy. Some of them are donating money to my campaign. It's notsomething they like to advertise.\"Gabrielle felt totally disarmed. \"But... isn't that illegal?\"\"Illegal? Hell no! All the donations are under the two-thousand-dollar cap.Small potatoes. These guys barely make a dent, but I listen to their gripesanyway. Call it an investment in the future. I'm quiet about it because,frankly, the appearances aren't so great. If the White House caught wind, they'dspin the hell out of it. Anyhow, look, that's not the point. I called to tellyou that after tonight's meeting, I was talking to the head of the SFF...\"For several seconds, although Sexton was still talking, all Gabrielle could hearwas the blood rushing in shame to her face. Without the slightest challenge fromher, the senator had calmly admitted tonight's meeting with private spacecompanies. Perfectly legal. And to think what Gabrielle had almost considereddoing! Thank God Yolanda had stopped her. I almost jumped ship to MarjorieTench!\"... and so I told the head of the SFF,\" the senator was saying, \"that you mightbe able to get that information for us.\"Gabrielle tuned back in. \"Okay.\"\"The contact from whom you've been getting all your inside NASA informationthese past few months? I assume you still have access?\"Marjorie Tench. Gabrielle cringed knowing she could never tell the senator thatthe informant had been manipulating her all along. \"Um... I think so,\" Gabriellelied.\"Good. There's some information I need from you. Right away.\"As she listened, Gabrielle realized just how badly she had been underestimatingSenator Sedgewick Sexton lately. Some of the man's luster had worn off sinceshe'd first begun following his career. But tonight, it was back. In the face ofwhat appeared to be the ultimate death blow to his campaign, Sexton was plottinga counterattack. And although it had been Gabrielle who led him down thisinauspicious path, he was not punishing her. Instead, he was giving her a chanceto redeem herself.And redeem herself she would.Whatever it took.80William Pickering gazed out his office window at the distant line of headlightson Leesburg Highway. He often thought about her when he stood up here alone atthe top of the world.All this power... and I couldn't save her.Pickering's daughter, Diana, had died in the Red Sea while stationed aboard asmall navy escort ship, training to become a navigator. Her ship had beenanchored in safe harbor on a sunny afternoon when a handmade dory loaded withexplosives and powered by two suicide terrorists motored slowly across theharbor and exploded on contact with the hull. Diana Pickering and thirteen otheryoung American soldiers had been killed that day.William Pickering had been devastated. The anguish overwhelmed him for weeks.When the terrorist attack was traced to a known cell whom the CIA had beentracking unsuccessfully for years, Pickering's sadness turned into rage. He hadmarched into CIA headquarters and demanded answers.The answers he got were hard to swallow.Apparently the CIA had been prepared to move on this cell months before and wassimply waiting for the high-res satellite photos so that they could plan apinpoint attack on the terrorists' mountain hideout in Afghanistan. Those photoswere scheduled to be taken by the $1.2 billion NRO satellite code-named Vortex2, the same satellite that had been blown up on the launchpad by its NASA launchvehicle. Because of the NASA accident, the CIA strike had been postponed, andnow Diana Pickering had died.Pickering's mind told him that NASA had not been directly responsible, but hisheart found it hard to forgive. The investigation of the rocket explosionrevealed that the NASA engineers responsible for the fuel injections system hadbeen forced to use second-rate materials in an effort to stay on budget.\"For nonmanned flights,\" Lawrence Ekstrom explained in a press conference, \"NASAstrives for cost-effectiveness above all. In this case, the results wereadmittedly not optimal. We will be looking into it.\"Not optimal. Diana Pickering was dead.Furthermore, because the spy satellite was classified, the public never learnedthat NASA had disintegrated a $1.2 billion NRO project, and along with it,indirectly, numerous American lives.\"Sir?\" Pickering's secretary's voice came over his intercom, startling him.\"Line one. It's Marjorie Tench.\"Pickering shook himself out of his daze and looked at his telephone. Again? Theblinking light on line one seemed to pulse with an irate urgency. Pickeringfrowned and took the call.\"Pickering here.\"Tench's voice was seething mad. \"What did she tell you?\"\"I'm sorry?\"\"Rachel Sexton contacted you. What did she tell you? She was on a submarine, forGod's sake! Explain that!\"Pickering could tell immediately that denying the fact was not an option; Tenchhad been doing her homework. Pickering was surprised she'd found out about theCharlotte, but she'd apparently thrown her weight around until she got someanswers. \"Ms. Sexton contacted me, yes.\"\"You arranged a pickup. And you didn't contact me?\"\"I arranged transport. That is correct.\" Two hours remained until Rachel Sexton,Michael Tolland, and Corky Marlinson were scheduled to arrive at the nearbyBollings Air Force Base.\"And yet you chose not to inform me?\"\"Rachel Sexton has made some very disturbing accusations.\"\"Regarding the authenticity of the meteorite... and some kind of attack on herlife?\"\"Among other things.\"\"Obviously, she is lying.\"\"You are aware she is with two others who corroborate her story?\"Tench paused. \"Yes. Most disturbing. The White House is very concerned by theirclaims.\"\"The White House? Or you personally?\"Her tone turned razor sharp. \"As far as you are concerned, director, there is nodifference tonight.\"Pickering was unimpressed. He was no stranger to blustering politicians andsupport staff trying to establish footholds over the intel community. Few put upas strong a front as Marjorie Tench. \"Does the President know you're callingme?\"\"Frankly, director, I'm shocked that you would even entertain these lunaticravings.\"You didn't answer my question. \"I see no logical reason for these people to lie.I have to assume they are either telling the truth, or they have made an honestmistake.\"\"Mistake? Claims of attacks? Flaws in the meteorite data that NASA never saw?Please! This is an obvious political ploy.\"\"If so, the motives escape me.\"Tench sighed heavily and lowered her voice. \"Director, there are forces at workhere of which you might not be aware. We can speak about that at length later,but at the moment I need to know where Ms. Sexton and the others are. I need toget to the bottom of this before they do any lasting damage. Where are they?\"\"That is not information I am comfortable sharing. I will contact you after theyarrive.\"\"Wrong. I will be there to greet them when they arrive.\"You and how many Secret Service agents? Pickering wondered. \"If I inform you oftheir arrival time and location, will we all have a chance to chat like friends,or do you intend to have a private army take them into custody?\"\"These people pose a direct threat to the President. The White House has everyright to detain and question them.\"Pickering knew she was right. Under Title 18, Section 3056 of the United StatesCode, agents of the U.S. Secret Service can carry firearms, use deadly force,and make \"un-warranted\" arrests simply on suspicion that a person has committedor is intending to commit a felony or any act of aggression against thepresident. The service possessed carte blanche. Regular detainees includedunsavory loiterers outside the White House and school kids who sent threateninge-mail pranks.Pickering had no doubt the service could justify dragging Rachel Sexton and theothers into the basement of the White House and keeping them there indefinitely.It would be a dangerous play, but Tench clearly realized the stakes were huge.The question was what would happen next if Pickering allowed Tench to takecontrol. He had no intention of finding out.\"I will do whatever is necessary,\" Tench declared, \"to protect the Presidentfrom false accusations. The mere implication of foul play will cast a heavyshadow on the White House and NASA. Rachel Sexton has abused the trust thePresident gave her, and I have no intention of seeing the President pay theprice.\"\"And if I request that Ms. Sexton be permitted to present her case to anofficial panel of inquiry?\"\"Then you would be disregarding a direct presidential order and giving her aplatform from which to make a goddamn political mess! I will ask you one moretime, director. Where are you flying them?\"Pickering exhaled a long breath. Whether or not he told Marjorie Tench that theplane was coming into Bollings Air Force Base, he knew she had the means to findout. The question was whether or not she would do it. He sensed from thedetermination in her voice that she would not rest. Marjorie Tench was scared.\"Marjorie,\" Pickering said, with unmistakable clarity of tone. \"Someone is lyingto me. Of this I am certain. Either it is Rachel Sexton and two civilianscientists – or it is you. I believe it is you.\"Tench exploded. \"How dare –\"\"Your indignity has no resonance with me, so save it. You would be wise to knowthat I have absolute proof NASA and the White House broadcast untruths tonight.\"Tench fell suddenly silent.Pickering let her reel a moment. \"I'm not looking for a political meltdown anymore than you are. But there have been lies. Lies that cannot stand. If you wantme to help you, you've got to start by being honest with me.\"Tench sounded tempted but wary. \"If you're so certain there were lies, whyhaven't you stepped forward?\"\"I don't interfere in political matters.\"Tench muttered something that sounded a lot like \"bullshit.\"\"Are you trying to tell me, Marjorie, that the President's announcement tonightwas entirely accurate?\"There was a long silence on the line.Pickering knew he had her. \"Listen, we both know this is a time bomb waiting toexplode. But it's not too late. There are compromises we can make.\"Tench said nothing for several seconds. Finally she sighed. \"We should meet.\"Touchdown, Pickering thought.\"I have something to show you,\" Tench said. \"And I believe it will shed somelight on this matter.\"\"I'll come to your office.\"\"No,\" she said hurriedly. \"It's late. Your presence here would raise concerns.I'd prefer to keep this matter between us.\"Pickering read between the lines. The President knows nothing about this.\"You're welcome to come here,\" he said.Tench sounded distrusting. \"Let's meet somewhere discreet.\"Pickering had expected as much.\"The FDR Memorial is convenient to the White House,\" Tench said. \"It will beempty at this time of night.\"Pickering considered it. The FDR Memorial sat midway between the Jefferson andLincoln memorials, in an extremely safe part of town. After a long beat,Pickering agreed.\"One hour,\" Tench said, signing off. \"And come alone.\"Immediately upon hanging up, Marjorie Tench phoned NASA administrator Ekstrom.Her voice was tight as she relayed the bad news.\"Pickering could be a problem.\"81Gabrielle Ashe was brimming with new hope as she stood at Yolanda Cole's desk inthe ABC production room and dialed directory assistance.The allegations Sexton had just conveyed to her, if confirmed, had shockingpotential. NASA lied about PODS? Gabrielle had seen the press conference inquestion and recalled thinking it was odd, and yet she'd forgotten all about it;PODS was not a critical issue a few weeks ago. Tonight, however, PODS had becomethe issue.Now Sexton needed inside information, and he needed it fast. He was relying onGabrielle's \"informant\" to get the information. Gabrielle had assured thesenator she would do her best. The problem, of course, was that her informantwas Marjorie Tench, who would be no help at all. So Gabrielle would have to getthe information another way.\"Directory assistance,\" the voice on the phone said.Gabrielle told them what she needed. The operator came back with three listingsfor a Chris Harper in Washington. Gabrielle tried them all.The first number was a law firm. The second had no answer. The third was nowringing.A woman answered on the first ring. \"Harper residence.\"\"Mrs. Harper?\" Gabrielle said as politely as possible. \"I hope I haven't wokenyou?\"\"Heavens no! I don't think anyone's asleep tonight.\" She sounded excited.Gabrielle could hear the television in the background. Meteorite coverage.\"You're calling for Chris, I assume?\"Gabrielle's pulse quickened. \"Yes, ma'am.\"\"I'm afraid Chris isn't here. He raced off to work as soon as the President'saddress was over.\" The woman chuckled to herself. \"Of course, I doubt there'sany work going on. Most likely a party. The announcement came as quite asurprise to him, you know. To everyone. Our phone's been ringing all night. Ibet the whole NASA crew's over there by now.\"\"E Street complex?\" Gabrielle asked, assuming the woman meant NASA headquarters.\"Righto. Take a party hat.\"\"Thanks. I'll track him down over there.\"Gabrielle hung up. She hurried out onto the production room floor and foundYolanda, who was just finishing prepping a group of space experts who were aboutto give enthusiastic commentary on the meteorite.Yolanda smiled when she saw Gabrielle coming. \"You look better,\" she said.\"Starting to see the silver lining here?\"\"I just talked to the senator. His meeting tonight wasn't what I thought.\"\"I told you Tench was playing you. How's the senator taking the meteorite news?\"\"Better than expected.\"Yolanda looked surprised. \"I figured he'd jumped in front of a bus by now.\"\"He thinks there may be a snag in the NASA data.\"Yolanda let out a dubious snort. \"Did he see the same press conference I justsaw? How much more confirmation and reconfirmation can anyone need?\"\"I'm going over to NASA to check on something.\"Yolanda's penciled eyebrows raised in cautionary arches. \"Senator Sexton'sright-hand aide is going to march into NASA headquarters? Tonight? Can you say'public stoning'?\"Gabrielle told Yolanda about Sexton's suspicion that the PODS section managerChris Harper had lied about fixing the anomaly software.Yolanda clearly wasn't buying it. \"We covered that press conference, Gabs, andI'll admit, Harper was not himself that night, but NASA said he was sick as adog.\"\"Senator Sexton is convinced he lied. Others are convinced too. Powerfulpeople.\"\"If the PODS anomaly-detection software wasn't fixed, how did PODS spot themeteorite?\"Sexton's point exactly, Gabrielle thought. \"I don't know. But the senator wantsme to get him some answers.\"Yolanda shook her head. \"Sexton is sending you into a hornet's nest on adesperate pipe dream. Don't go. You don't owe him a thing.\"\"I totally screwed up his campaign.\"\"Rotten luck screwed up his campaign.\"\"But if the senator is right and the PODS section manager actually lied –\"\"Honey, if the PODS section manager lied to the world, what makes you thinkhe'll tell you the truth.\"Gabrielle had considered that and was already formulating her plan. \"If I find astory over there, I'll call you.\"Yolanda gave a skeptical laugh. \"If you find a story over there, I'll eat myhat.\"82Erase everything you know about this rock sample.Michael Tolland had been struggling with his own disquieting ruminations aboutthe meteorite, but now, with Rachel's probing questions, he was feeling an addedunease over the issue. He looked down at the rock slice in his hand.Pretend someone handed it to you with no explanation of where it was found orwhat it is. What would your analysis be?Rachel's question, Tolland knew, was loaded, and yet as an analytical exercise,it proved powerful. By discarding all the data he had been given on his arrivalat the habisphere, Tolland had to admit that his analysis of the fossils wasprofoundly biased by a singular premise – that the rock in which the fossilswere found was a meteorite.What if I had NOT been told about the meteorite? he asked himself. Althoughstill unable to fathom any other explanation, Tolland allowed himself the leewayof hypothetically removing \"the meteorite\" as a pre-supposition, and when hedid, the results were somewhat unsettling. Now Tolland and Rachel, joined by agroggy Corky Marlinson, were discussing the ideas.\"So,\" Rachel repeated, her voice intense, \"Mike, you're saying that if someonehanded you this fossilized rock with no explanation whatsoever, you would haveto conclude it was from earth.\"\"Of course,\" Tolland replied. \"What else could I conclude? It's a far greaterleap to assert you've found extraterrestrial life than it is to assert you'vefound a fossil of some previously undiscovered terrestrial species. Scientistsdiscover dozens of new species every year.\"\"Two-foot-long lice?\" Corky demanded, sounding incredulous. \"You would assume abug that big is from earth?\"\"Not now, maybe,\" Tolland replied, \"but the species doesn't necessarily have tobe currently living. It's a fossil. It's 170 million years old. About the sameage as our Jurassic. A lot of prehistoric fossils are oversized creatures thatlook shocking when we discover their fossilized remains – enormous wingedreptiles, dinosaurs, birds.\"\"Not to be the physicist here, Mike,\" Corky said, \"but there's a serious flaw inyour argument. The prehistoric creatures you just named – dinosaurs, reptiles,birds – they all have internal skeletons, which gives them the capability togrow to large sizes despite the earth's gravity. But this fossil...\" He took thesample and held it up. \"These guys have exo skeletons. They're arthropods. Bugs.You yourself said that any bug this big could only have evolved in a low-gravityenvironment. Otherwise its outer skeleton would have collapsed under its ownweight.\"\"Correct,\" Tolland said. \"This species would have collapsed under its own weightif it walked around on earth.\"Corky's brow furrowed with annoyance. \"Well, Mike, unless some caveman wasrunning an antigravity louse farm, I don't see how you could possibly conclude atwo-foot-long bug is earthly in origin.\"Tolland smiled inwardly to think Corky was missing such a simple point.\"Actually, there is another possibility.\" He focused closely on his friend.\"Corky, you're used to looking up. Look down. There's an abundant antigravityenvironment right here on earth. And it's been here since prehistoric times.\"Corky stared. \"What the hell are you talking about?\"Rachel also looked surprised.Tolland pointed out the window at the moonlit sea glistening beneath the plane.\"The ocean.\"Rachel let out a low whistle. \"Of course.\"\"Water is a low-gravity environment,\" Tolland explained. \"Everything weighs lessunderwater. The ocean supports enormous fragile structures that could neverexist on land – jellyfish, giant squid, ribbon eels.\"Corky acquiesced, but only slightly. \"Fine, but the prehistoric ocean never hadgiant bugs.\"\"Sure, it did. And it still does, in fact. People eat them everyday. They're adelicacy in most countries.\"\"Mike, who the hell eats giant sea bugs!\"\"Anyone who eats lobsters, crabs, and shrimp.\"Corky stared.\"Crustaceans are essentially giant sea bugs,\" Tolland explained. \"They're asuborder of the phylum Arthropoda – lice, crabs, spiders, insects, grasshoppers,scorpions, lobsters – they're all related. They're all species with jointedappendages and external skeletons.\"Corky suddenly looked ill.\"From a classification standpoint, they look a lot like bugs,\" Tollandexplained. \"Horseshoe crabs resemble giant trilobites. And the claws of alobster resemble those of a large scorpion.\"Corky turned green. \"Okay, I've eaten my last lobster roll.\"Rachel looked fascinated. \"So arthropods on land stay small because the gravityselects naturally for smallness. But in the water, their bodies are buoyed up,so they can grow very large.\"\"Exactly,\" Tolland said. \"An Alaskan king crab could be wrongly classified as agiant spider if we had limited fossil evidence.\"Rachel's excitement seemed to fade now to concern. \"Mike, again barring theissue of the meteorite's apparent authenticity, tell me this: Do you think thefossils we saw at Milne could possibly have come from the ocean? Earth's ocean?\"Tolland felt the directness of her gaze and sensed the true weight of herquestion. \"Hypothetically, I would have to say yes. The ocean floor has sectionsthat are 190 million years old. The same age as the fossils. And theoreticallythe oceans could have sustained life-forms that looked like this.\"\"Oh please!\" Corky scoffed. \"I can't believe what I'm hearing here. Barring theissue of the meteorite's authenticity? The meteorite is irrefutable. Even ifearth has ocean floor the same age as that meteorite, we sure as hell don't haveocean floor that has fusion crust, anomalous nickel content, and chondrules.You're grasping at straws.\"Tolland knew Corky was right, and yet imagining the fossils as sea creatures hadrobbed Tolland of some of his awe over them. They seemed somehow more familiarnow.\"Mike,\" Rachel said, \"why didn't any of the NASA scientists consider that thesefossils might be ocean creatures? Even from an ocean on another planet?\"\"Two reasons, really. Pelagic fossil samples – those from the ocean floor – tendto exhibit a plethora of intermingled species. Anything living in the millionsof cubic feet of life above the ocean floor will eventually die and sink to thebottom. This means the ocean floor becomes a graveyard for species from everydepth, pressure, and temperature environment. But the sample at Milne was clean– a single species. It looked more like something we might find in the desert. Abrood of similar animals getting buried in a sandstorm, for example.\"Rachel nodded. \"And the second reason you guessed land rather than sea?\"Tolland shrugged. \"Gut instinct. Scientists have always believed space, if itwere populated, would be populated by insects. And from what we've observed ofspace, there's a lot more dirt and rock out there than water.\"Rachel fell silent.\"Although...,\" Tolland added. Rachel had him thinking now. \"I'll admit there arevery deep parts of the ocean floor that oceanographers call dead zones. We don'treally understand them, but they are areas in which the currents and foodsources are such that almost nothing lives there. Just a few species ofbottom-dwelling scavengers. So from that standpoint, I suppose a single-speciesfossil is not entirely out of the question.\"\"Hello?\" Corky grumbled. \"Remember the fusion crust? The mid-level nickelcontent? The chondrules? Why are we even talking about this?\"Tolland did not reply.\"This issue of the nickel content,\" Rachel said to Corky. \"Explain this to meagain. The nickel content in earth rocks is either very high or very low, but inmeteorites the nickel content is within a specific midrange window?\"Corky bobbed his head. \"Precisely.\"\"And so the nickel content in this sample falls precisely within the expectedrange of values.\"\"Very close, yes.\"Rachel looked surprised. \"Hold on. Close? What's that supposed to mean?\"Corky looked exasperated. \"As I explained earlier, all meteorite mineralogiesare different. As scientists find new meteorites, we constantly need to updateour calculations as to what we consider an acceptable nickel content formeteorites.\"Rachel looked stunned as she held up the sample. \"So, this meteorite forced youto reevaluate what you consider acceptable nickel content in a meteorite? Itfell outside the established midrange nickel window?\"\"Only slightly,\" Corky fired back.\"Why didn't anyone mention this?\"\"It's a nonissue. Astrophysics is a dynamic science which is constantly beingupdated.\"\"During an incredibly important analysis?\"\"Look,\" Corky said with a huff, \"I can assure you the nickel content in thatsample is a helluva lot closer to other meteorites than it is to any earthrock.\"Rachel turned to Tolland. \"Did you know about this?\"Tolland gave a reluctant nod. It hadn't seemed a major issue at the time. \"I wastold this meteorite exhibited slightly higher nickel content than seen in othermeteorites, but the NASA specialists seemed unconcerned.\"\"For good reason!\" Corky interjected. \"The mineralogical proof here is not thatthe nickel content is conclusively meteoritelike, but rather that it isconclusively non–earth-like.\"Rachel shook her head. \"Sorry, but in my business that's the kind of faultylogic that gets people killed. Saying a rock is non–earth-like doesn't proveit's a meteorite. It simply proves that it's not like anything we've ever seenon earth.\"\"What the hell's the difference!\"\"Nothing,\" Rachel said. \"If you've seen every rock on earth.\"Corky fell silent a moment. \"Okay,\" he finally said, \"ignore the nickel contentif it makes you nervous. We still have a flawless fusion crust and chondrules.\"\"Sure,\" Rachel said, sounding unimpressed. \"Two out of three ain't bad.\"83The structure housing the NASA central headquarters was a mammoth glassrectangle located at 300 E Street in Washington, D.C. The building was spideredwith over two hundred miles of data cabling and thousands of tons of computerprocessors. It was home to 1,134 civil servants who oversee NASA's $15 billionannual budget and the daily operations of the twelve NASA bases nationwide.Despite the late hour, Gabrielle was not at all surprised to see the building'sfoyer filling with people, an apparent convergence of excited media crews andeven more excited NASA personnel. Gabrielle hurried inside. The entrywayresembled a museum, dominated dramatically by full-size replicas of famousmission capsules and satellites suspended overhead. Television crews werestaking claims on the expansive marble floor, seizing wide-eyed NASA employeeswho came through the door.Gabrielle scanned the crowd, but did not see anyone who looked like PODS missiondirector Chris Harper. Half the people in the lobby had press passes and halfhad NASA photo IDs around their necks. Gabrielle had neither. She spotted ayoung woman with a NASA ID and hurried over to her.\"Hi. I'm looking for Chris Harper?\"The woman eyed Gabrielle strangely, as if she recognized her from somewhere andcouldn't quite place it. \"I saw Dr. Harper go through a while ago. I think heheaded upstairs. Do I know you?\"\"I don't think so,\" Gabrielle said, turning away. \"How do I get upstairs?\"\"Do you work for NASA?\"\"No, I don't.\"\"Then you can't get upstairs.\"\"Oh. Is there a phone I might use to –\"\"Hey,\" the woman said, looking suddenly angry. \"I know who you are. I've seenyou on television with Senator Sexton. I can't believe you would have the nerve–\"Gabrielle was already gone, disappearing into the crowd. Behind her, she couldhear the woman angrily telling others Gabrielle was here.Terrific. Two seconds through the door, and I'm already on the Most Wanted List.Gabrielle kept her head down as she hurried to the far side of the lobby. Abuilding directory was mounted on the wall. She scanned the listings, lookingfor Chris Harper. Nothing. The directory showed no names at all. It was arrangedby department.PODS? she wondered, scanning the list for anything that had to do with the PolarOrbiting Density Scanner. She saw nothing. She was afraid to glance over hershoulder, half expecting to see a crew of angry NASA employees coming to stoneher. All she saw on the list that looked even remotely promising was on thefourth floor:EARTH SCIENCE ENTERPRISE, PHASE IIEarth Observing System (EOS)Keeping her head turned away from the crowd, Gabrielle made her way toward analcove that housed a bank of elevators and a water fountain. She searched forthe elevator call buttons, but saw only slits. Damn. The elevators were securitycontrolled – key card ID access for employees only.A group of young men came hurrying toward the elevators, talking exuberantly.They wore NASA photo IDs around their necks. Gabrielle quickly bent over thefountain, watching behind her. A pimple-faced man inserted his ID into the slotand opened the elevator. He was laughing, shaking his head in amazement.\"The guys in SETI must be going nuts!\" he said as everyone boarded the elevator.\"Their horn carts traced drift fields under two hundred milliJanskys for twentyyears, and the physical proof was buried in the ice here on earth the wholetime!\"The elevator doors closed, and the men disappeared.Gabrielle stood up, wiping her mouth, wondering what to do. She looked aroundfor an interoffice phone. Nothing. She wondered if she could somehow steal a keycard, but something told her that was probably unwise. Whatever she did, sheknew she had to do it fast. She could now see the woman she'd first spoken toout in the lobby, moving through the crowd with a NASA security officer.A trim, bald man came around the corner, hustling toward the elevators.Gabrielle again bent over the fountain. The man did not seem to notice her.Gabrielle watched in silence as the man leaned forward and inserted his ID cardinto the slit. Another set of elevator doors slid open, and the man stepped on.Screw it, Gabrielle thought, making up her mind. Now or never.As the elevator slid closed, Gabrielle spun from the fountain and ran over,sticking her hand out and catching the door. The doors bounced back open, andshe stepped in, her face bright with excitement. \"You ever seen it like this?\"she gushed to the startled bald man. \"My God. It's crazy!\"The man gave her an odd look.\"The guys at SETI must be going nuts!\" Gabrielle said. \"Their horn carts traceddrift fields under two hundred milliJanskys for twenty years, and the physicalproof was buried in the ice here on earth the whole time!\"The man looked surprised. \"Well... yes, it's quite...\" He glanced at her neck,apparently troubled not to see an ID. \"I'm sorry, do you –\"\"Fourth floor please. Came in such a hurry I barely remembered to put on myunderwear!\" She laughed, stealing a quick look at the guy's ID: JAMES THEISEN,Finance Administration.\"Do you work here?\" The man looked uncomfortable. \"Miss...?\"Gabrielle let her mouth fall slack. \"Jim! I'm hurt! Nothing like making a womanfeel unmemorable!\"The man went pale for a moment, looking uneasy, and running an embarrassed handacross his head. \"I'm sorry. All this excitement, you know. I admit, you do lookvery familiar. What program are you working on?\"Shit. Gabrielle flashed a confident smile. \"EOS.\"The man pointed to the illuminated fourth floor button. \"Obviously. I meanspecifically, which project?\"Gabrielle felt her pulse quicken. She could only think of one. \"PODS.\"The man looked surprised. \"Really? I thought I'd met everyone on Dr. Harper'steam.\"She gave an embarrassed nod. \"Chris keeps me hidden away. I'm the idiotprogrammer who screwed up voxel index on the anomaly software.\"Now it was the bald man whose jaw dropped. \"That was you?\"Gabrielle frowned. \"I haven't slept in weeks.\"\"But Dr. Harper took all the heat for that!\"\"I know. Chris is that kind of guy. At least he got it straightened out. What anannouncement tonight, though, isn't it? This meteorite. I'm just in shock!\"The elevator stopped on the fourth floor. Gabrielle jumped out. \"Great seeingyou, Jim. Give my best to the boys in budgeting!\"\"Sure,\" the man stammered as the doors slid shut. \"Nice seeing you again.\"84Zach Herney, like most presidents before him, survived on four or five hours ofsleep a night. Over the last few weeks, however, he had survived on far less. Asthe excitement of the evening's events slowly began to ebb, Herney felt the latehour settling in his limbs.He and some of his upper level staff were in the Roosevelt Room enjoyingcelebratory champagne and watching the endless loop of press conference replays,Tolland documentary excerpts, and pundit recaps on network television. On-screenat the moment, an exuberant network correspondent stood in front of the WhiteHouse gripping her microphone.\"Beyond the mind-numbing repercussions for mankind as a species,\" she announced,\"this NASA discovery has some harsh political repercussions here in Washington.The unearthing of these meteoric fossils could not have come at a better timefor the embattled President.\" Her voice grew somber. \"Nor at a worse time forSenator Sexton.\" The broadcast cut to a replay of the now infamous CNN debatefrom earlier in the day.\"After thirty-five years,\" Sexton declared, \"I think it's pretty obvious we'renot going to find extraterrestrial life!\"\"And if you're wrong?\" Marjorie Tench replied.Sexton rolled his eyes. \"Oh, for heavens sake, Ms. Tench, if I'm wrong I'll eatmy hat.\"Everyone in the Roosevelt Room laughed. Tench's cornering of the senator couldhave played as cruel and heavy-handed in retrospect, and yet viewers didn't seemto notice; the haughty tone of the senator's response was so smug that Sextonappeared to be getting exactly what he deserved.The President looked around the room for Tench. He had not seen her since beforehis press conference, and she was not here now. Odd, he thought. This is hercelebration as much as it is mine.The news report on television was wrapping up, outlining yet again the WhiteHouse's quantum political leap forward and Senator Sexton's disastrous slide.What a difference a day makes, the President thought. In politics, your worldcan change in an instant.By dawn he would realize just how true those words could be.85Pickering could be a problem, Tench had said.Administrator Ekstrom was too preoccupied with this new information to noticethat the storm outside the habisphere was raging harder now. The howling cableshad increased in pitch, and the NASA staff was nervously milling and chattingrather than going to sleep. Ekstrom's thoughts were lost in a different storm –an explosive tempest brewing back in Washington. The last few hours had broughtmany problems, all of which Ekstrom was trying to deal with. And yet one problemnow loomed larger than all the others combined.Pickering could be a problem.Ekstrom could think of no one on earth against whom he'd less rather match witsthan William Pickering. Pickering had ridden Ekstrom and NASA for years now,trying to control privacy policy, lobbying for different mission priorities, andrailing against NASA's escalating failure ratio.Pickering's disgust with NASA, Ekstrom knew, went far deeper than the recentloss of his billion-dollar NRO SIGINT satellite in a NASA launchpad explosion,or the NASA security leaks, or the battle over recruiting key aerospacepersonnel. Pickering's grievances against NASA were an ongoing drama ofdisillusionment and resentment.NASA's X-33 space plane, which was supposed to be the shuttle replacement, hadrun five years overdue, meaning dozens of NRO satellite maintenance and launchprograms were scrapped or put on hold. Recently, Pickering's rage over the X-33reached a fever pitch when he discovered NASA had canceled the project entirely,swallowing an estimated $900 million loss.Ekstrom arrived at his office, pulled the curtain aside, and entered. Sittingdown at his desk he put his head in his hands. He had some decisions to make.What had started as a wonderful day was becoming a nightmare unraveling aroundhim. He tried to put himself in the mindset of William Pickering. What would theman do next? Someone as intelligent as Pickering had to see the importance ofthis NASA discovery. He had to forgive certain choices made in desperation. Hehad to see the irreversible damage that would be done by polluting this momentof triumph.What would Pickering do with the information he had? Would he let it ride, orwould he make NASA pay for their shortcomings?Ekstrom scowled, having little doubt which it would be.After all, William Pickering had deeper issues with NASA... an ancient personalbitterness that went far deeper than politics.86Rachel was quiet now, staring blankly at the cabin of the G4 as the plane headedsouth along the Canadian coastline of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Tolland satnearby, talking to Corky. Despite the majority of evidence suggesting themeteorite was authentic, Corky's admission that the nickel content was \"outsidethe preestablished midrange values\" had served to rekindle Rachel's initialsuspicion. Secretly planting a meteorite beneath the ice only made sense as partof a brilliantly conceived fraud.Nonetheless, the remaining scientific evidence pointed toward the meteorite'svalidity.Rachel turned from the window, glancing down at the disk-shaped meteorite samplein her hand. The tiny chondrules shimmered. Tolland and Corky had beendiscussing these metallic chondrules for some time now, talking in scientificterms well over Rachel's head – equilibrated olivine levels, metastable glassmatrices, and metamorphic rehomogenation. Nonetheless, the upshot was clear:Corky and Tolland were in agreement that the chondrules were decidedly meteoric.No fudging of that data.Rachel rotated the disk-shaped specimen in her hand, running a finger over therim where part of the fusion crust was visible. The charring looked relativelyfresh – certainly not three hundred years old – although Corky had explainedthat the meteorite had been hermetically sealed in ice and avoided atmosphericerosion. This seemed logical. Rachel had seen programs on television where humanremains were dug from the ice after four thousand years and the person's skinlooked almost perfect.As she studied the fusion crust, an odd thought occurred to her – an obviouspiece of data had been omitted. Rachel wondered if it had simply been anoversight in all the data that was thrown at her or did someone simply forget tomention it.She turned suddenly to Corky. \"Did anyone date the fusion crust?\"Corky glanced over, looking confused. \"What?\"\"Did anyone date the burn. That is, do we know for a fact that the burn on therock occurred at exactly the time of the Jungersol Fall?\"\"Sorry,\" Corky said, \"that's impossible to date. Oxidation resets all thenecessary isotopic markers. Besides, radioisotope decay rates are too slow tomeasure anything under five hundred years.\"Rachel considered that a moment, understanding now why the burn date was notpart of the data. \"So, as far as we know, this rock could have been burned inthe Middle Ages or last weekend, right?\"Tolland chuckled. \"Nobody said science had all the answers.\"Rachel let her mind wander aloud. \"A fusion crust is essentially just a severeburn. Technically speaking, the burn on this rock could have happened at anytime in the past half century, in any number of different ways.\"\"Wrong,\" Corky said. \"Burned in any number of different ways? No. Burned in oneway. Falling through the atmosphere.\"\"There's no other possibility? How about in a furnace?\"\"A furnace?\" Corky said. \"These samples were examined under an electronmicroscope. Even the cleanest furnace on earth would have left fuel residue allover the stone – nuclear, chemical, fossil fuel. Forget it. And how about thestriations from streaking through the atmosphere? You wouldn't get those in afurnace.\"Rachel had forgotten about the orientation striations on the meteorite. It didindeed appear to have fallen through the air. \"How about a volcano?\" sheventured. \"Ejecta thrown violently from an eruption?\"Corky shook his head. \"The burn is far too clean.\"Rachel glanced at Tolland.The oceanographer nodded. \"Sorry, I've had some experience with volcanoes, bothabove and below water. Corky's right. Volcanic ejecta is penetrated by dozens oftoxins – carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, hydrochloric acid –all of which would have been detected in our electronic scans. That fusioncrust, whether we like it or not, is the result of a clean atmospheric frictionburn.\"Rachel sighed, looking back out the window. A clean burn. The phrase stuck withher. She turned back to Tolland. \"What do you mean by a clean burn?\"He shrugged. \"Simply that under an electron microscope, we see no remnants offuel elements, so we know heating was caused by kinetic energy and friction,rather than chemical or nuclear ingredients.\"\"If you didn't find any foreign fuel elements, what did you find? Specifically,what was the composition of the fusion crust?\"\"We found,\" Corky said, \"exactly what we expected to find. Pure atmosphericelements. Nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen. No petroleums. No sulfurs. No volcanicacids. Nothing peculiar. All the stuff we see when meteorites fall through theatmosphere.\"Rachel leaned back in her seat, her thoughts focusing now.Corky leaned forward to look at her. \"Please don't tell me your new theory isthat NASA took a fossilized rock up in the space shuttle and sent it hurtlingtoward earth hoping nobody would notice the fireball, the massive crater, or theexplosion?\"Rachel had not thought of that, although it was an interesting premise. Notfeasible, but interesting all the same. Her thoughts were actually closer tohome. All natural atmospheric elements. Clean burn. Striations from racingthrough the air. A faint light had gone off in a distant corner of her mind.\"The ratios of the atmospheric elements you saw,\" she said. \"Were they exactlythe same ratios you see on every other meteorite with a fusion crust?\"Corky seemed to hedge slightly at the question. \"Why do you ask?\"Rachel saw him hesitate and felt her pulse quicken. \"The ratios were off,weren't they?\"\"There is a scientific explanation.\"Rachel's heart was suddenly pounding. \"Did you by any chance see an unusuallyhigh content of one element in particular?\"Tolland and Corky exchanged startled looks. \"Yes,\" Corky said, \"but –\"\"Was it ionized hydrogen?\"The astrophysicist's eyes turned to saucers. \"How could you possibly know that!\"Tolland also looked utterly amazed.Rachel stared at them both. \"Why didn't anyone mention this to me?\"\"Because there's a perfectly sound scientific explanation!\" Corky declared.\"I'm all ears,\" Rachel said.\"There was surplus ionized hydrogen,\" Corky said, \"because the meteorite passedthrough the atmosphere near the North Pole, where the earth's magnetic fieldcauses an abnormally high concentration of hydrogen ions.\"Rachel frowned. \"Unfortunately, I have another explanation.\"87The fourth floor of NASA headquarters was less impressive than the lobby – longsterile corridors with office doors equally spaced along the walls. The corridorwas deserted. Laminated signs pointed in all directions.F-LANDSATTERRAE-ACRIMSATF-JASONAQUAPODSGabrielle followed the signs for PODS. Winding her way down a series of longcorridors and intersections, she came to a set of heavy steel doors. The stencilread:POLAR ORBITING DENSITY SCANNER (PODS)Section Manager, Chris HarperThe doors were locked, secured both by key card and a PIN pad access. Gabrielleput her ear to the cold metal door. For a moment, she thought she heard talking.Arguing. Maybe not. She wondered if she should just bang on the door untilsomeone inside let her in. Unfortunately, her plan for dealing with Chris Harperrequired a bit more subtlety than banging on doors. She looked around foranother entrance but saw none. A custodial alcove stood adjacent to the door,and Gabrielle stepped in, searching the dimly lit niche for a janitor's key ringor key card. Nothing. Just brooms and mops.Returning to the door, she put her ear to the metal again. This time shedefinitely heard voices. Getting louder. And footsteps. The latch engaged frominside.Gabrielle had no time to hide as the metal door burst open. She jumped to theside, plastering herself against the wall behind the door as a group of peoplehurried through, talking loudly. They sounded angry.\"What the hell is Harper's problem? I thought he'd be on cloud nine!\"\"On a night like tonight,\" another said as the group passed by, \"he wants to bealone? He should be celebrating!\"As the group moved away from Gabrielle, the heavy door started swinging closedon pneumatic hinges, revealing her location. She remained rigid as the mencontinued down the hall. Waiting as long as she possibly could, until the doorwas only inches from closing, Gabrielle lunged forward and caught the doorhandle with just inches to spare. She stood motionless as the men turned thecorner down the hall, too engaged in their conversation to look back.Heart pounding, Gabrielle pulled open the door and stepped into the dimly litarea beyond. She quietly closed the door.The space was a wide open work area that reminded her of a college physicslaboratory: computers, work islands, electronic gear. As her eyes becameaccustomed to the darkness, Gabrielle could see blueprints and sheets ofcalculations scattered around. The entire area was dark except for an office onthe far side of the lab, where a light shone under the door. Gabrielle walkedover quietly. The door was closed, but through the window she could see a mansitting at a computer. She recognized the man from the NASA press conference.The nameplate on the door read:Chris HarperSection Manager, PODSHaving come this far, Gabrielle suddenly felt apprehensive, wondering if shecould actually pull this off. She reminded herself how certain Sexton was thatChris Harper had lied. I would bet my campaign on it, Sexton had said.Apparently there were others who felt the same, others who were waiting forGabrielle to uncover the truth so they could close in on NASA, attempting togain even a tiny foothold after tonight's devastating developments. After theway Tench and the Herney administration had played Gabrielle this afternoon, shewas eager to help.Gabrielle raised her hand to knock on the door but paused, Yolanda's voicerunning through her mind. If Chris Harper lied to the world about PODS, whatmakes you think he'll tell YOU the truth?Fear, Gabrielle told herself, having almost fallen victim to it herself today.She had a plan. It involved a tactic she'd seen the senator use on occasion toscare information out of political opponents. Gabrielle had absorbed a lot underSexton's tutelage, and not all of it attractive or ethical. But tonight sheneeded every advantage. If she could persuade Chris Harper to admit he had lied– for whatever reason – Gabrielle would open a small door of opportunity for thesenator's campaign. Beyond that, Sexton was a man who, if given an inch tomaneuver, could wriggle his way out of almost any jam.Gabrielle's plan for dealing with Harper was something Sexton called\"overshooting\" – an interrogation technique invented by the early Romanauthorities to coax confessions from criminals they suspected were lying. Themethod was deceptively simple:Assert the information you want confessed.Then allege something far worse.The object was to give the opponent a chance to choose the lesser of two evils –in this case, the truth.The trick was exuding confidence, something Gabrielle was not feeling at themoment. Taking a deep breath, Gabrielle ran through the script in her mind, andthen knocked firmly on the office door.\"I told you I'm busy!\" Harper called out, his English accent familiar.She knocked again. Louder.\"I told you I'm not interested in coming down!\"This time she banged on the door with her fist.Chris Harper came over and yanked open the door. \"Bloody hell, do you –\" Hestopped short, clearly surprised to see Gabrielle.\"Dr. Harper,\" she said, infusing her voice with intensity.\"How did you get up here?\"Gabrielle's face was stern. \"Do you know who I am?\"\"Of course. Your boss has been slamming my project for months. How did you getin?\"\"Senator Sexton sent me.\"Harper's eyes scanned the lab behind Gabrielle. \"Where is your staff escort?\"\"That's not your concern. The senator has influential connections.\"\"In this building?\" Harper looked dubious.\"You've been dishonest, Dr. Harper. And I'm afraid the senator has called aspecial senatorial justice board to look into your lies.\"A pall crossed Harper's face. \"What are you talking about?\"\"Smart people like yourself don't have the luxury of playing stupid, Dr. Harper.You're in trouble, and the senator sent me up here to offer you a deal. Thesenator's campaign took a huge hit tonight. He's got nothing left to lose, andhe's ready to take you down with him if he needs to.\"\"What the devil are you talking about?\"Gabrielle took a deep breath and made her play. \"You lied in your pressconference about the PODS anomaly-detection software. We know that. A lot ofpeople know that. That's not the issue.\" Before Harper could open his mouth toargue, Gabrielle steamed onward. \"The senator could blow the whistle on yourlies right now, but he's not interested. He's interested in the bigger story. Ithink you know what I'm talking about.\"\"No, I –\"\"Here's the senator's offer. He'll keep his mouth shut about your software liesif you give him the name of the top NASA executive with whom you're embezzlingfunds.\"Chris Harper's eyes seemed to cross for a moment. \"What? I'm not embezzling!\"\"I suggest you watch what you say, sir. The senatorial committee has beencollecting documentation for months now. Did you really think you two would slipby undetected? Doctoring PODS paperwork and redirecting allocated NASA funds toprivate accounts? Lying and embezzling can put you in jail, Dr. Harper.\"\"I did no such thing!\"\"You're saying you didn't lie about PODS?\"\"No, I'm saying I bloody well didn't embezzle money!\"\"So, you're saying you did lie about PODS.\"Harper stared, clearly at a loss for words.\"Forget about the lying,\" Gabrielle said, waving it off. \"Senator Sexton is notinterested in the issue of your lying in a press conference. We're used to that.You guys found a meteorite, nobody cares how you did it. The issue for him isthe embezzlement. He needs to take down someone high in NASA. Just tell him whoyou're working with, and he'll steer the investigation clear of you entirely.You can make it easy and tell us who the other person is, or the senator willmake it ugly and start talking about anomaly-detection software and phonywork-arounds.\"\"You're bluffing. There are no embezzled funds.\"\"You're an awful liar, Dr. Harper. I've seen the documentation. Your name is onall the incriminating paperwork. Over and over.\"\"I swear I know nothing about any embezzlement!\"Gabrielle let out a disappointed sigh. \"Put yourself in my position, Dr. Harper.I can only draw two conclusions here. Either you're lying to me, the same wayyou lied in that press conference. Or you're telling the truth, and someonepowerful in the agency is setting you up as a fall guy for his own misdealings.\"The proposition seemed to give Harper pause.Gabrielle checked her watch. \"The senator's deal is on the table for an hour.You can save yourself by giving him the name of the NASA exec with whom you'reembezzling taxpayers' money. He doesn't care about you. He wants the big fish.Obviously the individual in question has some power here at NASA; he or she hasmanaged to keep his or her identity off the paper trail, allowing you to be thefall guy.\"Harper shook his head. \"You're lying.\"\"Would you like to tell that to a court?\"\"Sure. I'll deny the whole thing.\"\"Under oath?\" Gabrielle grunted in disgust. \"Suppose you'll also deny you liedabout fixing the PODS software?\" Gabrielle's heart was pounding as she staredstraight into the man's eyes. \"Think carefully about your options here, Dr.Harper. American prisons can be most unpleasant.\"Harper glared back, and Gabrielle willed him to fold. For a moment she thoughtshe saw a glimmer of surrender, but when Harper spoke, his voice was like steel.\"Ms. Ashe,\" he declared, anger simmering in his eyes, \"you are clutching at thinair. You and I both know there is no embezzlement going on at NASA. The onlyliar in this room is you.\"Gabrielle felt her muscles go rigid. The man's gaze was angry and sharp. Shewanted to turn and run. You tried to bluff a rocket scientist. What the hell didyou expect? She forced herself to hold her head high. \"All I know,\" she said,feigning utter confidence and indifference to his position, \"is theincriminating documents I've seen – conclusive evidence that you and another areembezzling NASA funds. The senator simply asked me to come here tonight andoffer you the option of giving up your partner instead of facing the inquiryalone. I will tell the senator you prefer to take your chances with a judge. Youcan tell the court what you told me – you're not embezzling funds and you didn'tlie about the PODS software.\" She gave a grim smile. \"But after that lame pressconference you gave two weeks ago, somehow I doubt it.\" Gabrielle spun on herheel and strode across the darkened PODS laboratory. She wondered if maybe she'dbe seeing the inside of a prison instead of Harper.Gabrielle held her head high as she walked off, waiting for Harper to call herback. Silence. She pushed her way through the metal doors and strode out intothe hallway, hoping the elevators up here were not key-card operated like thelobby. She'd lost. Despite her best efforts, Harper wasn't biting. Maybe he wastelling the truth in his PODS press conference, Gabrielle thought.A crash resounded down the hall as the metal doors behind her burst open. \"Ms.Ashe,\" Harper's voice called out. \"I swear I know nothing about anyembezzlement. I'm an honest man!\"Gabrielle felt her heart skip a beat. She forced herself to keep walking. Shegave a casual shrug and called out over her shoulder. \"And yet you lied in yourpress conference.\"Silence. Gabrielle kept moving down the hallway.\"Hold on!\" Harper yelled. He came jogging up beside her, his face pale. \"Thisembezzlement thing,\" he said, lowering his voice. \"I think I know who set meup.\"Gabrielle stopped dead in her tracks, wondering if she had heard him correctly.She turned as slowly and casually as she could. \"You expect me to believesomeone is setting you up?\"Harper sighed. \"I swear I know nothing about embezzlement. But if there'sevidence against me...\"\"Mounds of it.\"Harper sighed. \"Then it's all been planted. To discredit me if need be. Andthere's only one person who would have done that.\"\"Who?\"Harper looked her in the eye. \"Lawrence Ekstrom hates me.\"Gabrielle was stunned. \"The administrator of NASA?\"Harper gave a grim nod. \"He's the one who forced me to lie in that pressconference.\"88Even with the Aurora aircraft's misted-methane propulsion system at half power,the Delta Force was hurtling through the night at three times the speed of sound– over two thousand miles an hour. The repetitive throb of the Pulse DetonationWave Engines behind them gave the ride a hypnotic rhythm. A hundred feet below,the ocean churned wildly, whipped up by the Aurora's vacuum wake, which suckedfifty-foot rooster tails skyward in long parallel sheets behind the plane.This is the reason the SR-71 Blackbird was retired, Delta-One thought.The Aurora was one of those secret aircraft that nobody was supposed to knowexisted, but everyone did. Even the Discovery channel had covered Aurora and itstesting out at Groom Lake in Nevada. Whether the security leaks had come fromthe repeated \"skyquakes\" heard as far away as Los Angeles, or the unfortunateeyewitness sighting by a North Sea oil-rig driller, or the administrative gaffethat left a description of Aurora in a public copy of the Pentagon budget,nobody would ever know. It hardly mattered. The word was out: The U.S. militaryhad a plane capable of Mach 6 flight, and it was no longer on the drawing board.It was in the skies overhead.Built by Lockheed, the Aurora looked like a flattened American football. It was110 feet long, sixty feet wide, smoothly contoured with a crystalline patina ofthermal tiles much like the space shuttle. The speed was primarily the result ofan exotic new propulsion system known as a Pulse Detonation Wave Engine, whichburned a clean, misted, liquid hydrogen and left a telltale pulse contrail inthe sky. For this reason, it only flew at night.Tonight, with the luxury of enormous speed, the Delta Force was taking the longway home, out across the open ocean. Even so, they were overtaking their quarry.At this rate, the Delta Force would be arriving on the eastern seaboard in underan hour, a good two hours before its prey. There had been discussion of trackingand shooting down the plane in question, but the controller rightly feared aradar capture of the incident or the burned wreckage might bring on a massiveinvestigation. It was best to let the plane land as scheduled, the controllerhad decided. Once it became clear where their quarry intended to land, the DeltaForce would move in.Now, as Aurora streaked over the desolate Labrador Sea, Delta-One's CrypTalkindicated an incoming call. He answered.\"The situation has changed,\" the electronic voice informed them. \"You haveanother mark before Rachel Sexton and the scientists land.\"Another mark. Delta-One could feel it. Things were unraveling. The controller'sship had sprung another leak, and the controller needed them to patch it as fastas possible. The ship would not be leaking, Delta-One reminded himself, if wehad hit our marks successfully on the Milne Ice Shelf. Delta-One knew damn wellhe was cleaning up his own mess.\"A fourth party has become involved,\" the controller said.\"Who?\"The controller paused a moment – and then gave them a name.The three men exchanged startled looks. It was a name they knew well.No wonder the controller sounded reluctant! Delta-One thought. For an operationconceived as a \"zero-casualty\" venture, the body count and target profile wasclimbing fast. He felt his sinews tighten as the controller prepared to informthem exactly how and where they would eliminate this new individual.\"The stakes have increased considerably,\" the controller said. \"Listen closely.I will give you these instructions only once.\"89High above northern Maine, a G4 jet continued speeding toward Washington.Onboard, Michael Tolland and Corky Marlinson looked on as Rachel Sexton began toexplain her theory for why there might be increased hydrogen ions in the fusioncrust of the meteorite.\"NASA has a private test facility called Plum Brook Station,\" Rachel explained,hardly able to believe she was going to talk about this. Sharing classifiedinformation out of protocol was not something she had ever done, but consideringthe circumstances, Tolland and Corky had a right to know this. \"Plum Brook isessentially a test chamber for NASA's most radical new engine systems. Two yearsago I wrote a gist about a new design NASA was testing there – something calledan expander cycle engine.\"Corky eyed her suspiciously. \"Expander cycle engines are still in thetheoretical stage. On paper. Nobody's actually testing. That's decades away.\"Rachel shook her head. \"Sorry, Corky. NASA has prototypes. They're testing.\"\"What?\" Corky looked skeptical. \"ECE's run on liquid oxygen-hydrogen, whichfreezes in space, making the engine worthless to NASA. They said they were noteven going to try to build an ECE until they overcame the freezing fuelproblem.\"\"They overcame it. They got rid of the oxygen and turned the fuel into a'slush-hydrogen' mixture, which is some kind of cryogenic fuel consisting ofpure hydrogen in a semifrozen state. It's very powerful and very clean burning.It's also a contender for the propulsion system if NASA runs missions to Mars.\"Corky looked amazed. \"This can't be true.\"\"It better be true,\" Rachel said. \"I wrote a brief about it for the President.My boss was up in arms because NASA wanted to publicly announce slush-hydrogenas a big success, and Pickering wanted the White House to force NASA to keepslush-hydrogen classified.\"\"Why?\"\"Not important,\" Rachel said, having no intention of sharing more secrets thanshe had to. The truth was that Pickering's desire to classify slush-hydrogen'ssuccess was to fight a growing national security concern few knew existed – thealarming expansion of China's space technology. The Chinese were currentlydeveloping a deadly \"for-hire\" launch platform, which they intended to rent outto high bidders, most of whom would be U.S. enemies. The implications for U.S.security were devastating. Fortunately, the NRO knew China was pursuing a doomedpropulsion-fuel model for their launch platform, and Pickering saw no reason totip them off about NASA's more promising slush-hydrogen propellant.\"So,\" Tolland said, looking uneasy, \"you're saying NASA has a clean-burningpropulsion system that runs on pure hydrogen?\"Rachel nodded. \"I don't have figures, but the exhaust temperatures of theseengines are apparently several times hotter than anything ever before developed.They're requiring NASA to develop all kinds of new nozzle materials.\" Shepaused. \"A large rock, placed behind one of these slush-hydrogen engines, wouldbe scalded by a hydrogen-rich blast of exhaust fire coming out at anunprecedented temperature. You'd get quite a fusion crust.\"\"Come on now!\" Corky said. \"Are we back to the fake meteorite scenario?\"Tolland seemed suddenly intrigued. \"Actually, that's quite an idea. The setupwould be more or less like leaving a boulder on the launchpad under the spaceshuttle during liftoff.\"\"God save me,\" Corky muttered. \"I'm airborne with idiots.\"\"Corky,\" Tolland said. \"Hypothetically speaking, a rock placed in an exhaustfield would exhibit similar burn features to one that fell through theatmosphere, wouldn't it? You'd have the same directional striations and backflowof the melting material.\"Corky grunted. \"I suppose.\"\"And Rachel's clean-burning hydrogen fuel would leave no chemical residue. Onlyhydrogen. Increased levels of hydrogen ions in the fusion pocking.\"Corky rolled his eyes. \"Look, if one of these ECE engines actually exists, andruns on slush-hydrogen, I suppose what you're talking about is possible. Butit's extremely far-fetched.\"\"Why?\" Tolland asked. \"The process seems fairly simple.\"Rachel nodded. \"All you need is a 190-million-year-old fossilized rock. Blast itin a slush-hydrogen-engine exhaust fire, and bury it in the ice. Instantmeteorite.\"\"To a tourist, maybe,\" Corky said, \"but not to a NASA scientist! You stillhaven't explained the chondrules!\"Rachel tried to recall Corky's explanation of how chondrules formed. \"You saidchondrules are caused by rapid heating and cooling events in space, right?\"Corky sighed. \"Chondrules form when a rock, chilled in space, suddenly becomessuperheated to a partial-melt stage – somewhere near 1550 Celsius. Then the rockmust cool again, extremely rapidly, hardening the liquid pockets intochondrules.\"Tolland studied his friend. \"And this process can't happen on earth?\"\"Impossible,\" Corky said. \"This planet does not have the temperature variance tocause that kind of rapid shift. You're talking here about nuclear heat and theabsolute zero of space. Those extremes simply don't exist on earth.\"Rachel considered it. \"At least not naturally.\"Corky turned. \"What's that supposed to mean?\"\"Why couldn't the heating and cooling event have occurred here on earthartificially?\" Rachel asked. \"The rock could have been blasted by aslush-hydrogen engine and then rapidly cooled in a cryogenic freezer.\"Corky stared. \"Manufactured chondrules?\"\"It's an idea.\"\"A ridiculous one,\" Corky replied, flashing his meteorite sample. \"Perhaps youforget? These chondrules were irrefutably dated at 190 million years.\" His tonegrew patronizing. \"To the best of my knowledge, Ms. Sexton, 190 million yearsago, nobody was running slush-hydrogen engines and cryogenic coolers.\"Chondrules or not, Tolland thought, the evidence is piling up. He had beensilent now for several minutes, deeply troubled by Rachel's newest revelationabout the fusion crust. Her hypothesis, though staggeringly bold, had opened allkinds of new doors and gotten Tolland thinking in new directions. If the fusioncrust is explainable... what other possibilities does that present?\"You're quiet,\" Rachel said, beside him.Tolland glanced over. For an instant, in the muted lighting of the plane, he sawa softness in Rachel's eyes that reminded him of Celia. Shaking off thememories, he gave her a tired sigh. \"Oh, I was just thinking...\"She smiled. \"About meteorites?\"\"What else?\"\"Running through all the evidence, trying to figure out what's left?\"\"Something like that.\"\"Any thoughts?\"\"Not really. I'm troubled by how much of the data has collapsed in light ofdiscovering that insertion shaft beneath the ice.\"\"Hierarchical evidence is a house of cards,\" Rachel said. \"Pull out your primaryassumption, and everything gets shaky. The location of the meteorite find was aprimary assumption.\"I'll say. \"When I arrived at Milne, the administrator told me the meteorite hadbeen found inside a pristine matrix of three-hundred-year-old ice and was moredense than any rock found anywhere in the area, which I took as logical proofthat the rock had to fall from space.\"\"You and the rest of us.\"\"The midrange nickel content, though persuasive, is apparently not conclusive.\"\"It's close,\" Corky said nearby, apparently listening in.\"But not exact.\"Corky acquiesced with a reluctant nod.\"And,\" Tolland said, \"this never before seen species of space bug, thoughshockingly bizarre, in reality could be nothing more than a very old, deepwatercrustacean.\"Rachel nodded. \"And now the fusion crust...\"\"I hate to say it,\" Tolland said, glancing at Corky, \"but it's starting to feellike there's more negative evidence than positive.\"\"Science is not about hunches,\" Corky said. \"It's about evidence. The chondrulesin this rock are decidedly meteoric. I agree with you both that everything we'veseen is deeply disturbing, but we cannot ignore these chondrules. The evidencein favor is conclusive, while the evidence against is circumstantial.\"Rachel frowned. \"So where does that leave us?\"\"Nowhere,\" Corky said. \"The chondrules prove we are dealing with a meteorite.The only question is why someone stuck it under the ice.\"Tolland wanted to believe his friend's sound logic, but something just feltwrong.\"You don't look convinced, Mike,\" Corky said.Tolland gave his friend a bewildered sigh. \"I don't know. Two out of threewasn't bad, Corky. But we're down to one out of three. I just feel like we'remissing something.\"90I got caught, Chris Harper thought, feeling a chill as he pictured an Americanprison cell. Senator Sexton knows I lied about the PODS software.As the PODS section manager escorted Gabrielle Ashe back into his office andclosed the door, he felt his hatred of the NASA administrator grow deeper by theinstant. Tonight Harper had learned just how deep the administrator's lies trulyran. In addition to forcing Harper to lie about having fixed PODS's software,the administrator had apparently set up some insurance just in case Harper gotcold feet and decided not to be a team player.Evidence of embezzlement, Harper thought. Blackmail. Very sly. After all, whowould believe an embezzler trying to discredit the single greatest moment inAmerican space history? Harper had already witnessed to what lengths the NASAadministrator would go to save America's space agency, and now with theannouncement of a meteorite with fossils, the stakes had skyrocketed.Harper paced for several seconds around the widetable on which sat a scale modelof the PODS satellite – a cylindrical prism with multiple antennae and lensesbehind reflective shields. Gabrielle sat down, her dark eyes watching, waiting.The nausea in Harper's gut reminded him of how he had felt during the infamouspress conference. He'd put on a lousy show that night, and everyone hadquestioned him about it. He'd had to lie again and say he was feeling ill thatnight and was not himself. His colleagues and the press shrugged off hislackluster performance and quickly forgot about it.Now the lie had come back to haunt him.Gabrielle Ashe's expression softened. \"Mr. Harper, with the administrator as anenemy, you will need a powerful ally. Senator Sexton could well be your onlyfriend at this point. Let's start with the PODS software lie. Tell me whathappened.\"Harper sighed. He knew it was time to tell the truth. I bloody well should havetold the truth in the first place! \"The PODS launch went smoothly,\" he began.\"The satellite settled into a perfect polar orbit just as planned.\"Gabrielle Ashe looked bored. She apparently knew all this. \"Go on.\"\"Then came the trouble. When we geared up to start searching the ice for densityanomalies, the onboard anomaly-detection software failed.\"\"Uh... huh.\"Harper's words came faster now. \"The software was supposed to be able to rapidlyexamine thousands of acres of data and find parts of the ice that fell outsidethe range of normal ice density. Primarily the software was looking for softspots in the ice – global warming indicators – but if it stumbled across otherdensity incongruities, it was programmed to flag those as well. The plan was forPODS to scan the Arctic Circle over several weeks and identify any anomaliesthat we could use to measure global warming.\"\"But without functioning software,\" Gabrielle said, \"PODS was no good. NASAwould have had to examine images of every square inch of the Arctic by hand,looking for trouble spots.\"Harper nodded, reliving the nightmare of his programming gaffe. \"It would takedecades. The situation was terrible. Because of a flaw in my programming, PODSwas essentially worthless. With the election coming up and Senator Sexton beingso critical of NASA...\" He sighed.\"Your mistake was devastating to NASA and the President.\"\"It couldn't have come at a worse time. The administrator was livid. I promisedhim I could fix the problem during the next shuttle mission – a simple matter ofswapping out the chip that held the PODS software system. But it was too littletoo late. He sent me home on leave – but essentially I was fired. That was amonth ago.\"\"And yet you were back on television two weeks ago announcing you'd found awork-around.\"Harper slumped. \"A terrible mistake. That was the day I got a desperate callfrom the administrator. He told me something had come up, a possible way toredeem myself. I came into the office immediately and met with him. He asked meto hold a press conference and tell everyone I'd found a work-around for thePODS software and that we would have data in a few weeks. He said he'd explainit to me later.\"\"And you agreed.\"\"No, I refused! But an hour later, the administrator was back in my office –with the White House senior adviser!\"\"What!\" Gabrielle looked astounded by this. \"Marjorie Tench?\"An awful creature, Harper thought, nodding. \"She and the administrator sat medown and told me my mistake had quite literally put NASA and the President onthe brink of total collapse. Ms. Tench told me about the senator's plans toprivatize NASA. She told me I owed it to the President and space agency to makeit all right. Then she told me how.\"Gabrielle leaned forward. \"Go on.\"\"Marjorie Tench informed me that the White House, by sheer good fortune, hadintercepted strong geologic evidence that an enormous meteorite was buried inthe Milne Ice Shelf. One of the biggest ever. A meteorite of that size would bea major find for NASA.\"Gabrielle looked stunned. \"Hold on, so you're saying someone already knew themeteorite was there before PODS discovered it?\"\"Yes. PODS had nothing to do with the discovery. The administrator knew themeteorite existed. He simply gave me the coordinates and told me to repositionPODS over the ice shelf and pretend PODS made the discovery.\"\"You're kidding me.\"\"That was my reaction when they asked me to participate in the sham. Theyrefused to tell me how they'd found out the meteorite was there, but Ms. Tenchinsisted it didn't matter and that this was the ideal opportunity to salvage myPODS fiasco. If I could pretend the PODS satellite located the meteorite, thenNASA could praise PODS as a much needed success and boost the President beforethe election.\"Gabrielle was awestruck. \"And of course you couldn't claim PODS had detected ameteorite until you'd announced that the PODS anomaly-detection software was upand running.\"Harper nodded. \"Hence the press conference lie. I was forced into it. Tench andthe administrator were ruthless. They reminded me I'd let everyone down – thePresident had funded my PODS project, NASA had spent years on it, and now I'druined the whole thing with a programming blunder.\"\"So you agreed to help.\"\"I didn't have a choice. My career was essentially over if I didn't. And thereality was that if I hadn't muffed the software, PODS would have found thatmeteorite on its own. So, it seemed a small lie at the time. I rationalized itby telling myself that the software would be fixed in a few months when thespace shuttle went up, so I would simply be announcing the fix a little early.\"Gabrielle let out a whistle. \"A tiny lie to take advantage of a meteoricopportunity.\"Harper was feeling ill just talking about it. \"So... I did it. Following theadministrator's orders, I held a press conference announcing that I'd found awork-around for my anomaly-detection software, I waited a few days, and then Irepositioned PODS over the administrator's meteorite coordinates. Then,following the proper chain of command, I phoned the EOS director and reportedthat PODS had located a hard density anomaly in the Milne Ice Shelf. I gave himthe coordinates and told him the anomaly appeared to be dense enough to be ameteorite. Excitedly, NASA sent a small team up to Milne to take some drillcores. That's when the operation got very hush-hush.\"\"So, you had no idea the meteorite had fossils until tonight?\"\"Nobody here did. We're all in shock. Now everyone is calling me a hero forfinding proof of extraterrestrial bioforms, and I don't know what to say.\"Gabrielle was silent a long moment, studying Harper with firm black eyes. \"Butif PODS didn't locate the meteorite in the ice, how did the administrator knowthe meteorite was there?\"\"Someone else found it first.\"\"Someone else? Who?\"Harper sighed. \"A Canadian geologist named Charles Brophy – a researcher onEllesmere Island. Apparently he was doing geologic ice soundings on the MilneIce Shelf when he by chance discovered the presence of what appeared to be ahuge meteorite in the ice. He radioed it in, and NASA happened to intercept thetransmission.\"Gabrielle stared. \"But isn't this Canadian furious that NASA is taking all thecredit for the find?\"\"No,\" Harper said, feeling a chill. \"Conveniently, he's dead.\"91Michael Tolland closed his eyes and listened to the drone of the G4 jet engine.He had given up trying to think anymore about the meteorite until they got backto Washington. The chondrules, according to Corky, were conclusive; the rock inthe Milne Ice Shelf could only be a meteorite. Rachel had hoped to have aconclusive answer for William Pickering by the time they landed, but her thoughtexperiments had run into a dead end with the chondrules. As suspicious as themeteorite evidence was, the meteorite appeared to be authentic.So be it.Rachel had obviously been shaken by the trauma in the ocean. Tolland was amazed,though, by her resilience. She was focused now on the issue at hand – trying tofind a way to debunk or authenticate the meteorite, and trying to assess who hadtried to kill them.For most of the trip, Rachel had been in the seat beside Tolland. He'd enjoyedtalking to her, despite the trying circumstances. Several minutes ago, she'dheaded back to the restroom, and now Tolland was surprised to find himselfmissing her beside him. He wondered how long it had been since he'd missed awoman's presence – a woman other than Celia.\"Mr. Tolland?\"Tolland glanced up.The pilot was sticking his head into the cabin. \"You asked me to tell you whenwe were in telephone range of your ship? I can get you that connection if youwant.\"\"Thanks.\" Tolland made his way up the aisle.Inside the cockpit, Tolland placed a call to his crew. He wanted to let themknow he would not be back for another day or two. Of course, he had no intentionof telling them what trouble he'd run into.The phone rang several times, and Tolland was surprised to hear the ship'sSHINCOM 2100 communications system pick up. The outgoing message was not theusual professional-sounding greeting but rather the rowdy voice of one ofTolland's crew, the onboard joker.\"Hiya, hiya, this is the Goya,\" the voice announced. \"We're sorry nobody's hereright now, but we've all been abducted by very large lice! Actually, we've takentemporary shore leave to celebrate Mike's huge night. Gosh, are we proud! Youcan leave your name and number, and maybe we'll be back tomorrow when we'resober. Ciao! Go, ET!\"Tolland laughed, missing his crew already. Obviously they'd seen the pressconference. He was glad they'd gone ashore; he'd abandoned them rather abruptlywhen the President called, and their sitting idle at sea was crazy. Although themessage said everyone had gone ashore, Tolland had to assume they would not haveleft his ship unattended, particularly in the strong currents where it was nowanchored.Tolland pressed the numeric code to play any internal voice mail messages they'dleft for him. The line beeped once. One message. The voice was the same rowdycrewmember.\"Hi Mike, hell of a show! If you're hearing this, you're probably checking yourmessages from some swanky White House party and wondering where the hell we are.Sorry we abandoned ship, buddy, but this was not a dry-celebration kind ofnight. Don't worry, we anchored her really good and left the porch light on.We're secretly hoping she gets pirated so you'll let NBC buy you that new boat!Just kidding, man. Don't worry, Xavia agreed to stay onboard and mind the fort.She said she preferred time alone to partying with a bunch of drunkenfishmongers? Can you believe that?\"Tolland chuckled, relieved to hear someone was aboard watching the ship. Xaviawas responsible, definitely not the partying type. A respected marine geologist,Xavia had the reputation for speaking her mind with a caustic honesty.\"Anyhow, Mike,\" the message went on, \"tonight was incredible. Kind of makes youproud to be a scientist, doesn't it? Everyone's talking about how good thislooks for NASA. Screw NASA, I say! This looks even better for us! Amazing Seasratings must have gone up a few million points tonight. You're a star, man. Areal one. Congrats. Excellent job.\"There was hushed talking on the line, and the voice came back. \"Oh, yeah, andspeaking of Xavia, just so you don't get too big a head, she wants to razz youabout something. Here she is.\"Xavia's razor voice came on the machine. \"Mike, Xavia, you're a God, yada yada.And because I love you so much, I've agreed to baby-sit this antediluvian wreckof yours. Frankly, it will be nice to be away from these hoodlums you callscientists. Anyhow, in addition to baby-sitting the ship, the crew has asked me,in my role as onboard bitch, to do everything in my power to keep you fromturning into a conceited bastard, which after tonight I realize is going to bedifficult, but I had to be the first to tell you that you made a boo-boo in yourdocumentary. Yes, you heard me. A rare Michael Tolland brain fart. Don't worry,there are only about three people on earth who will notice, and they're allanal-retentive marine geologists with no sense of humor. A lot like me. But youknow what they say about us geologists – always looking for faults!\" Shelaughed. \"Anyhow, it's nothing, a minuscule point about meteorite petrology. Ionly mention it to ruin your night. You might get a call or two about it, so Ithought I'd give you the heads-up so you don't end up sounding like the moron weall know you really are.\" She laughed again. \"Anyhow, I'm not much of a partyanimal, so I'm staying onboard. Don't bother calling me; I had to turn on themachine because the goddamned press have been calling all night. You're a realstar tonight, despite your screwup. Anyhow, I'll fill you in on it when you getback. Ciao.\"The line went dead.Michael Tolland frowned. A mistake in my documentary?Rachel Sexton stood in the restroom of the G4 and looked at herself in themirror. She looked pale, she thought, and more frail than she'd imagined.Tonight's scare had taken a lot out of her. She wondered how long it would bebefore she would stop shivering, or before she would go near an ocean. Removingher U.S.S. Charlotte cap, she let her hair down. Better, she thought, feelingmore like herself.Looking into her eyes, Rachel sensed a deep weariness. Beneath it, though, shesaw the resolve. She knew that was her mother's gift. Nobody tells you what youcan and can't do. Rachel wondered if her mother had seen what happened tonight.Someone tried to kill me, Mom. Someone tried to kill all of us...Rachel's mind, as it had for several hours now, scrolled through the list ofnames.Lawrence Ekstrom... Marjorie Tench... President Zach Herney. All had motives.And, more chillingly, all had means. The President is not involved, Rachel toldherself, clinging to her hope that the President she respected so much more thanher own father was an innocent bystander in this mysterious incident.We still know nothing.Not who... not if... not why.Rachel had wanted to have answers for William Pickering but, so far, all she'dmanaged to do was raise more questions.When Rachel left the restroom, she was surprised to see Michael Tolland was notin his seat. Corky was dozing nearby. As Rachel looked around, Mike stepped outof the cockpit as the pilot hung up a radiophone. His eyes were wide withconcern.\"What is it?\" Rachel asked.Tolland's voice was heavy as he told her about the phone message.A mistake in his presentation? Rachel thought Tolland was overreacting. \"It'sprobably nothing. She didn't tell you specifically what the error was?\"\"Something to do with meteorite petrology.\"\"Rock structure?\"\"Yeah. She said the only people who would notice the mistake were a few othergeologists. It sounds like whatever error I made was related to the compositionof the meteorite itself.\"Rachel drew a quick breath, understanding now. \"Chondrules?\"\"I don't know, but it seems pretty coincidental.\"Rachel agreed. The chondrules were the one remaining shred of evidence thatcategorically supported NASA's claim that this was indeed a meteorite.Corky came over, rubbing his eyes. \"What's going on?\"Tolland filled him in.Corky scowled, shaking his head. \"It's not a problem with the chondrules, Mike.No way. All of your data came from NASA. And from me. It was flawless.\"\"What other petrologic error could I have made?\"\"Who the hell knows? Besides, what do marine geologists know about chondrules?\"\"I have no idea, but she's damned sharp.\"\"Considering the circumstances,\" Rachel said, \"I think we should talk to thiswoman before we talk to Director Pickering.\"Tolland shrugged. \"I called her four times and got the machine. She's probablyin the hydrolab and can't hear a damn thing anyway. She won't get my messagesuntil morning at the earliest.\" Tolland paused, checking his watch.\"Although...\"\"Although what?\"Tolland eyed her intensely. \"How important do you think it is that we talk toXavia before we talk to your boss?\"\"If she has something to say about chondrules? I'd say it's critical. Mike,\"Rachel said, \"at the moment, we've got all kinds of contradictory data. WilliamPickering is a man accustomed to having clear answers. When we meet him, I'dlove to have something substantial for him to act on.\"\"Then we should make a stop.\"Rachel did a double take. \"On your ship?\"\"It's off the coast of New Jersey. Almost directly on our way to Washington. Wecan talk to Xavia, find out what she knows. Corky still has the meteoritesample, and if Xavia wants to run some geologic tests on it, the ship has afairly well-equipped lab. I can't imagine it would take us more than an hour toget some conclusive answers.\"Rachel felt a pulse of anxiety. The thought of having to face the ocean again sosoon was unnerving. Conclusive answers, she told herself, tempted by thepossibility. Pickering will definitely want answers.92Delta-One was glad to be back on solid ground.The Aurora aircraft, despite running at only one-half power and taking acircuitous ocean route, had completed its journey in under two hours andafforded the Delta Force a healthy head start to take up position and preparethemselves for the additional kill the controller had requested.Now, on a private military runway outside D.C., the Delta Force left the Aurorabehind and boarded their new transport – a waiting OH-58D Kiowa Warriorhelicopter.Yet again, the controller has arranged for the best, Delta-One thought.The Kiowa Warrior, originally designed as a light observation helicopter, hadbeen \"expanded and improved\" to create the military's newest breed of attackhelicopter. The Kiowa boasted infrared thermal imaging capability enabling itsdesignator/laser range finder to provide autonomous designation for laser-guidedprecision weapons like Air-to-Air Stinger missiles and the AGM-1148 HellfireMissile System. A high-speed digital signal processor provided simultaneousmultitarget tracking of up to six targets. Few enemies had ever seen a Kiowa upclose and survived to tell the tale.Delta-One felt a familiar rush of power as he climbed into the Kiowa pilot'sseat and strapped himself in. He had trained on this craft and flown it incovert ops three times. Of course, never before had he been gunning for aprominent American official. The Kiowa, he had to admit, was the perfectaircraft for the job. Its Rolls-Royce Allison engine and twin semirigid bladeswere \"silent running,\" which essentially meant targets on the ground could nothear the chopper until it was directly over them. And because the aircraft wascapable of flying blind without lights and was painted flat black with noreflective tail numbers, it was essentially invisible unless the target hadradar.Silent black helicopters.The conspiracy theorists were going nuts over these. Some claimed the invasionof silent black helicopters was proof of \"New World Order storm troopers\" underthe authority of the United Nations. Others claimed the choppers were silentalien probes. Still others who saw the Kiowas in tight formation at night weredeceived into thinking they were looking at fixed running lights on a muchlarger craft – a single flying saucer that was apparently capable of verticalflight.Wrong again. But the military loved the diversion.During a recent covert mission, Delta-One had flown a Kiowa armed with the mostsecretive new U.S. military technology – an ingenious holographic weaponnicknamed S&M. Despite conjuring associations with sadomasochism, S&M stood for\"smoke and mirrors\" – holographic images \"projected\" into the sky over enemyterritory. The Kiowa had used S&M technology to project holograms of U.S.aircraft over an enemy anti-aircraft installation. The panicked anti-aircraftgunners fired maniacally at the circling ghosts. When all of their ammunitionwas gone, the United States sent in the real thing.As Delta-One and his men lifted off the runway, Delta-One could still hear thewords of his controller. You have another mark. It seemed an egregiousunder-statement considering their new target's identity. Delta-One remindedhimself, however, that it was not his place to question. His team had been givenan order, and they would carry it out in the exact method instructed – asshocking as that method was.I hope to hell the controller is certain this is the right move.As the Kiowa lifted off the runway, Delta-One headed southwest. He had seen theFDR Memorial twice, but tonight would be his first time from the air.93\"This meteorite was originally discovered by a Canadian geologist?\" GabrielleAshe stared in astonishment at the young programmer, Chris Harper. \"And thisCanadian is now dead?\"Harper gave a grim nod.\"How long have you known this?\" she demanded.\"A couple of weeks. After the administrator and Marjorie Tench forced me toperjure myself in the press conference, they knew I couldn't go back on my word.They told me the truth about how the meteorite was really discovered.\"PODS is not responsible for finding the meteorite! Gabrielle had no idea whereall of this information would lead, but clearly it was scandalous. Bad news forTench. Great news for the senator.\"As I mentioned,\" Harper said, looking somber now, \"the true way the meteoritewas discovered was through an intercepted radio transmission. Are you familiarwith a program called INSPIRE? The Interactive NASA Space Physics IonosphereRadio Experiment.\"Gabrielle had heard of it only vaguely.\"Essentially,\" Harper said, \"it's a series of very low frequency radio receiversnear the North Pole that listen to the sounds of the earth – plasma waveemissions from the northern lights, broadband pulses from lightning storms, thatsort of thing.\"\"Okay.\"\"A few weeks ago, one of INSPIRE's radio receivers picked up a straytransmission from Ellesmere Island. A Canadian geologist was calling for help atan exceptionally low frequency.\" Harper paused. \"In fact, the frequency was solow that nobody other than NASA's VLF receivers could possibly have heard it. Weassumed the Canadian was long-waving.\"\"I'm sorry?\"\"Broadcasting at the lowest possible frequency to get maximum distance on histransmission. He was in the middle of nowhere, remember; a standard frequencytransmission probably would not have made it far enough to be heard.\"\"What did his message say?\"\"The transmission was short. The Canadian said he had been out doing icesoundings on the Milne Ice Shelf, had detected an ultradense anomaly buried inthe ice, suspected it was a giant meteorite, and while taking measurements hadbecome trapped in a storm. He gave his coordinates, asked for rescue from thestorm, and signed off. The NASA listening post sent a plane from Thule to rescuehim. They searched for hours and finally discovered him, miles off course, deadat the bottom of a crevasse with his sled and dogs. Apparently he tried tooutrun the storm, got blinded, went off course, and fell into a crevasse.\"Gabrielle considered the information, intrigued. \"So suddenly NASA knew about ameteorite that nobody else knew about?\"\"Exactly. And ironically, if my software had been working properly, the PODSsatellite would have spotted that same meteorite – a week before the Canadiandid.\"The coincidence gave Gabrielle pause. \"A meteorite buried for three hundredyears was almost discovered twice in the same week?\"\"I know. A little bizarre, but science can be like that. Feast or famine. Thepoint is that the administrator felt like the meteorite should have been ourdiscovery anyway – if I had done my job correctly. He told me that because theCanadian was dead, nobody would be the wiser if I simply redirected PODS to thecoordinates the Canadian had transmitted in his SOS. Then I could pretend todiscover the meteorite from scratch, and we could salvage some respect from anembarrassing failure.\"\"And that's what you did.\"\"As I said, I had no choice. I had let down the mission.\" He paused. \"Tonight,though, when I heard the President's press conference and found out themeteorite I'd pretended to discover contained fossils...\"\"You were stunned.\"\"Bloody well floored, I'd say!\"\"Do you think the administrator knew the meteorite contained fossils before heasked you to pretend PODS found it?\"\"I can't imagine how. That meteorite was buried and untouched until the firstNASA team got there. My best guess is that NASA had no idea what they'd reallyfound until they got a team up there to drill cores and x-ray. They asked me tolie about PODS, thinking they'd have a moderate victory with a big meteorite.Then when they got there, they realized just how big a find it really was.\"Gabrielle's breath was shallow with excitement. \"Dr. Harper, will you testifythat NASA and the White House forced you to lie about the PODS software?\"\"I don't know.\" Harper looked frightened. \"I can't imagine what kind of damagethat would do to the agency... to this discovery.\"\"Dr. Harper, you and I both know this meteorite remains a wonderful discovery,regardless of how it came about. The point here is that you lied to the Americanpeople. They have a right to know that PODS is not everything NASA says it is.\"\"I don't know. I despise the administrator, but my coworkers... they are goodpeople.\"\"And they deserve to know they are being deceived.\"\"And this evidence against me of embezzlement?\"\"You can erase that from your mind,\" Gabrielle said, having almost forgotten hercon. \"I will tell the senator you know nothing of the embezzlement. It is simplya frame job – insurance set up by the administrator to keep you quiet aboutPODS.\"\"Can the senator protect me?\"\"Fully. You've done nothing wrong. You were simply following orders. Besides,with the information you've just given me about this Canadian geologist, I can'timagine the senator will even need to raise the issue of embezzlement at all. Wecan focus entirely on NASA's misinformation regarding PODS and the meteorite.Once the senator breaks the information about the Canadian, the administratorwon't be able to risk trying to discredit you with lies.\"Harper still looked worried. He fell silent, somber as he pondered his options.Gabrielle gave him a moment. She'd realized earlier that there was anothertroubling coincidence to this story. She wasn't going to mention it, but shecould see Dr. Harper needed a final push.\"Do you have dogs, Dr. Harper?\"He glanced up. \"I'm sorry?\"\"I just thought it was odd. You told me that shortly after this Canadiangeologist radioed in the meteorite coordinates, his sled dogs ran blindly into acrevasse?\"\"There was a storm. They were off course.\"Gabrielle shrugged, letting her skepticism show. \"Yeah... okay.\"Harper clearly sensed her hesitation. \"What are you saying?\"\"I don't know. There's just a lot of coincidence surrounding this discovery. ACanadian geologist transmits meteorite coordinates on a frequency that only NASAcan hear? And then his sled dogs run blindly off a cliff?\" She paused. \"Youobviously understand that this geologist's death paved the way for this entireNASA triumph.\"The color drained from Harper's face. \"You think the administrator would killover this meteorite.\"Big politics. Big money, Gabrielle thought. \"Let me talk to the senator andwe'll be in touch. Is there a back way out of here?\"Gabrielle Ashe left a pale Chris Harper and descended a fire stairwell into adeserted alley behind NASA. She flagged down a taxi that had just dropped offmore NASA celebrators.\"Westbrooke Place Luxury Apartments,\" she told the driver. She was about to makeSenator Sexton a much happier man.94Wondering what she had agreed to, Rachel stood near the entrance of the G4cockpit, stretching a radio transceiver cable into the cabin so she could placeher call out of earshot of the pilot. Corky and Tolland looked on. AlthoughRachel and NRO director William Pickering had planned to maintain radio silenceuntil her arrival at Bollings Air Force Base outside of D.C., Rachel now hadinformation she was certain Pickering would want to hear immediately. She hadphoned his secure cellular, which he carried at all times.When William Pickering came on the line, he was all business. \"Speak with care,please. I cannot guarantee this connection.\"Rachel understood. Pickering's cellular, like most NRO field phones, had anindicator that detected unsecured incoming calls. Because Rachel was on aradiophone, one of the least secure communication modes available, Pickering'sphone had warned him. This conversation would need to be vague. No names. Nolocations.\"My voice is my identity,\" Rachel said, using the standard field greeting inthis situation. She had expected the director's response would be displeasurethat she had risked contacting him, but Pickering's reaction sounded positive.\"Yes, I was about to make contact with you myself. We need to redirect. I'mconcerned you may have a welcoming party.\"Rachel felt a sudden trepidation. Someone is watching us. She could hear thedanger in Pickering's tone. Redirect. He would be pleased to know she had calledto make that exact request, albeit for entirely different reasons.\"The issue of authenticity,\" Rachel said. \"We've been discussing it. We may havea way to confirm or deny categorically.\"\"Excellent. There have been developments, and at least then I would have solidground on which to proceed.\"\"The proof involves our making a quick stop. One of us has access to alaboratory facility –\"\"No exact locations, please. For your own safety.\"Rachel had no intention of broadcasting her plans over this line. \"Can you getus clearance to land at GAS-AC?\"Pickering was silent a moment. Rachel sensed he was trying to process the word.GAS-AC was an obscure NRO gisting shorthand for the Coast Guard's Group AirStation Atlantic City. Rachel hoped the director would know it.\"Yes,\" he finally said. \"I can arrange that. Is that your final destination?\"\"No. We will require further helicopter transport.\"\"An aircraft will be waiting.\"\"Thank you.\"\"I recommend you exercise extreme caution until we know more. Speak to no one.Your suspicions have drawn deep concern among powerful parties.\"Tench, Rachel thought, wishing she had managed to make contact with thePresident directly.\"I am currently in my car, en route to meet the woman in question. She hasrequested a private meeting in a neutral location. It should reveal much.\"Pickering is driving somewhere to meet Tench? Whatever Tench was going to tellhim must be important if she refused to tell him on the phone.Pickering said, \"Do not discuss your final coordinates with anyone. And no moreradio contact. Is that clear?\"\"Yes, sir. We'll be at GAS-AC in an hour.\"\"Transport will be arranged. When you reach your ultimate destination, you cancall me via more secure channels.\" He paused. \"I cannot overstate the importanceof secrecy to your safety. You have made powerful enemies tonight. Takeappropriate caution.\" Pickering was gone.Rachel felt tense as she closed the connection and turned to Tolland and Corky.\"Change of destination?\" Tolland said, looking eager for answers.Rachel nodded, feeling reluctant. \"The Goya.\"Corky sighed, glancing down at the meteorite sample in his hand. \"I still can'timagine NASA could possibly have...\" He faded off, looking more worried withevery passing minute.We'll know soon enough, Rachel thought.She went into the cockpit and returned the radio transceiver. Glancing out thewindscreen at the rolling plateau of moonlit clouds racing beneath them, she hadthe unsettling feeling they were not going to like what they found onboardTolland's ship.95William Pickering felt an unusual solitude as he drove his sedan down theLeesburg Highway. It was almost 2:00 A.M., and the road was empty. It had beenyears since he'd been driving this late.Marjorie Tench's raspy voice still grated on his mind. Meet me at the FDRMemorial.Pickering tried to recall the last time he had seen Marjorie Tench face-to-face– never a pleasant experience. It had been two months ago. At the White House.Tench was seated opposite Pickering at a long oak table surrounded by members ofthe National Security Council, Joint Chiefs, CIA, President Herney, and theadministrator of NASA.\"Gentlemen,\" the head of the CIA had said, looking directly at Marjorie Tench.\"Yet again, I am before you to urge this administration to confront the ongoingsecurity crisis of NASA.\"The declaration took no one in the room by surprise. NASA's security woes hadbecome a tired issue in the intelligence community. Two days previously, morethan three hundred high-resolution satellite photos from one of NASA'searth-observing satellites had been stolen by hackers out of a NASA database.The photos – inadvertently revealing a classified U.S. military trainingfacility in North Africa – had turned up on the black market, where they hadbeen purchased by hostile intelligence agencies in the Middle East.\"Despite the best of intentions,\" the CIA director said with a weary voice,\"NASA continues to be a threat to national security. Simply put, our spaceagency is not equipped to protect the data and technologies they develop.\"\"I realize,\" the President replied, \"that there have been indiscretions.Damaging leaks. And it troubles me deeply.\" He motioned across the table to thestern face of NASA administrator Lawrence Ekstrom. \"We are yet again lookinginto ways to tighten NASA's security.\"\"With due respect,\" the CIA director said, \"whatever security changes NASAimplements will be ineffective as long as NASA operations remain outside theumbrella of the United States intelligence community.\"The statement brought an uneasy rustle from those assembled. Everyone knew wherethis was headed.\"As you know,\" the CIA director went on, his tone sharpening, \"all U.S.government entities who deal with sensitive intelligence information aregoverned by strict rules of secrecy – military, CIA, NSA, NRO – all of them mustabide by stringent laws regarding the concealment of the data they glean and thetechnologies they develop. I ask you all, yet again, why NASA – the agencycurrently producing the largest portion of cutting-edge aerospace, imaging,flight, software, reconnaissance, and telecom technologies used by the militaryand intelligence community – exists outside this umbrella of secrecy.\"The President heaved a weighty sigh. The proposal was clear. Restructure NASA tobecome part of the U.S. military intelligence community. Although similarrestructurings had happened with other agencies in the past, Herney refused toentertain the idea of placing NASA under the auspices of the Pentagon, the CIA,the NRO, or any other military directive. The National Security Council wasstarting to splinter on the issue, many siding with the intelligence community.Lawrence Ekstrom never looked pleased at these meetings, and this was noexception. He shot an acrimonious glare toward the CIA director. \"At the risk ofrepeating myself, sir, the technologies NASA develops are for nonmilitary,academic applications. If your intelligence community wants to turn one of ourspace telescopes around and look at China, that's your choice.\"The CIA director looked like he was about to boil over.Pickering caught his eye and stepped in. \"Larry,\" he said, careful to keep aneven tone, \"every year NASA kneels before Congress and begs for money. You'rerunning operations with too little funding, and you're paying the price infailed missions. If we incorporate NASA into the intelligence community, NASAwill no longer need to ask Congress for help. You would be funded by the blackbudget at significantly higher levels. It's a win-win. NASA will have the moneyit needs to run itself properly, and the intelligence community will have peaceof mind that NASA technologies are protected.\"Ekstrom shook his head. \"On principle, I cannot endorse painting NASA with thatbrush. NASA is about space science; we have nothing to do with nationalsecurity.\"The CIA director stood up, something never done when the President was seated.Nobody stopped him. He glared down at the administrator of NASA. \"Are youtelling me you think science has nothing to do with national security? Larry,they are synonymous, for God's sake! It is only this country's scientific andtechnological edge that keeps us secure, and whether we like it or not, NASA isplaying a bigger and bigger part in developing those technologies.Unfortunately, your agency leaks like a sieve and has proven time and again thatits security is a liability!\"The room fell silent.Now the administrator of NASA stood up and locked eyes with his attacker. \"Soyou suggest locking twenty thousand NASA scientists in airtight military labsand making them work for you? Do you really think NASA's newest space telescopeswould have been conceived had it not been for our scientists' personal desire tosee deeper into space? NASA makes astonishing breakthroughs for one reason only– our employees want to understand the cosmos more deeply. They are a communityof dreamers who grew up staring at starry skies and asking themselves what wasup there. Passion and curiosity are what drive NASA's innovation, not thepromise of military superiority.\"Pickering cleared his throat, speaking softly, trying to lower the temperaturesaround the table. \"Larry, I'm certain the director is not talking aboutrecruiting NASA scientists to build military satellites. Your NASA missionstatement would not change. NASA would carry on business as usual, except youwould have increased funding and increased security.\" Pickering turned now tothe President. \"Security is expensive. Everyone in this room certainly realizesthat NASA's security leaks are a result of underfunding. NASA has to toot itsown horn, cut corners on security measures, run joint projects with othercountries so they can share the price tag. I am proposing that NASA remain thesuperb, scientific, nonmilitary entity it currently is, but with a biggerbudget, and some discretion.\"Several members of the security council nodded in quiet agreement.President Herney stood slowly, staring directly at William Pickering, clearlynot at all amused with the way Pickering had just taken over. \"Bill, let me askyou this: NASA is hoping to go to Mars in the next decade. How will theintelligence community feel about spending a hefty portion of the black budgetrunning a mission to Mars – a mission that has no immediate national securitybenefits?\"\"NASA will be able to do as they please.\"\"Bullshit,\" Herney replied flatly.Everyone's eyes shot up. President Herney seldom used profanity.\"If there is one thing I've learned as president,\" Herney declared, \"it's thatthose who control the dollars control the direction. I refuse to put NASA'spurse strings in the hands of those who do not share the objectives for whichthe agency was founded. I can only imagine how much pure science would get donewith the military deciding which NASA missions are viable.\"Herney's eyes scanned the room. Slowly, purposefully, he returned his rigid gazeto William Pickering.\"Bill,\" Herney sighed, \"your displeasure that NASA is engaged in joint projectswith foreign space agencies is painfully shortsighted. At least someone isworking constructively with the Chinese and Russians. Peace on this planet willnot be forged by military strength. It will be forged by those who come togetherdespite their governments' differences. If you ask me, NASA's joint missions domore to promote national security than any billion-dollar spy satellite, andwith a hell of a lot better hope for the future.\"Pickering felt an anger welling deep within him. How dare a politician talk downto me this way! Herney's idealism played fine in a boardroom, but in the realworld, it got people killed.\"Bill,\" Marjorie Tench interrupted, as if sensing Pickering was about toexplode, \"we know you lost a child. We know this is a personal issue for you.\"Pickering heard nothing but condescension in her tone.\"But please remember,\" Tench said, \"that the White House is currently holdingback a floodgate of investors who want us to open space to the private sector.If you ask me, for all its mistakes, NASA has been one hell of a friend to theintel community. You all might just want to count your blessings.\"A rumble strip on the shoulder of the highway jolted Pickering's mind back tothe present. His exit was coming up. As he approached the exit for D.C., hepassed a bloody deer lying dead by the side of the road. He felt an oddhesitation... but he kept driving.He had a rendezvous to keep.96The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial is one of the largest memorials in thenation. With a park, waterfalls, statuary, alcoves, and basin, the memorial isdivided into four outdoor galleries, one for each of FDR's terms in office.A mile from the memorial, a lone Kiowa Warrior coasted in, high over the city,its running lights dimmed. In a town boasting as many VIPs and media crews asD.C., helicopters in the skies were as common as birds flying south. Delta-Oneknew that as long as he stayed well outside what was known as \"the dome\" – abubble of protected airspace around the White House – he should draw littleattention. They would not be here long.The Kiowa was at twenty-one hundred feet when it slowed adjacent to, but notdirectly over, the darkened FDR Memorial. Delta-One hovered, checking hisposition. He looked to his left, where Delta-Two was manning the night visiontelescopic viewing system. The video feed showed a greenish image of the entrydrive of the memorial. The area was deserted.Now they would wait.This would not be a quiet kill. There were some people you simply did not killquietly. Regardless of the method, there would be repercussions. Investigations.Inquiries. In these cases, the best cover was to make a lot of noise.Explosions, fire, and smoke made it appear you were making a statement, and thefirst thought would be foreign terrorism. Especially when the target was ahigh-profile official.Delta-One scanned the night-vision transmission of the tree-shrouded memorialbelow. The parking lot and entry road were empty. Soon, he thought. The locationof this private meeting, though in an urban area, was fortuitously desolate atthis hour. Delta-One turned his eyes from the screen to his own weaponscontrols.The Hellfire system would be the weapon of choice tonight. A laser-guided,anti-armor missile, the Hellfire provided fire-and-forget capability. Theprojectile could home in on a laser spot that was projected from groundobservers, other aircraft, or the launching aircraft itself. Tonight, themissile would be guided autonomously through the laser designator in amast-mounted sight. Once the Kiowa's designator had \"painted\" the target with alaser beam, the Hellfire missile would be self-directing. Because the Hellfirecould be fired either from the air or ground, its employment here tonight wouldnot necessarily imply an aircraft's involvement. In addition, the Hellfire was apopular munition among black-market arms dealers, so terrorist activity couldcertainly be blamed.\"Sedan,\" Delta-Two said.Delta-One glanced at the transmission screen. A nondescript, black luxury sedanwas approaching on the access road exactly on schedule. This was the typicalmotor pool car of large government agencies. The driver dimmed the car'sheadlights on entering the memorial. The car circled several times and thenparked near a grove of trees. Delta-One watched the screen as his partnertrained the telescopic night vision on the driver's side window. After a moment,the person's face came into view.Delta-One drew a quick breath.\"Target confirmed,\" his partner said.Delta-One looked at the night-vision screen – with its deadly crucifix ofcross-hairs – and he felt like a sniper aiming at royalty. Target confirmed.Delta-Two turned to the left side avionics compartment and activated the laserdesignator. He aimed, and two thousand feet below, a pinpoint of light appearedon the roof of the sedan, invisible to the occupant. \"Target painted,\" he said.Delta-One took a deep breath. He fired.A sharp hissing sound sizzled beneath the fuselage, followed by a remarkably dimtrail of light streaking toward the earth. One second later, the car in theparking lot blew apart in a blinding eruption of flames. Twisted metal fleweverywhere. Burning tires rolled into the woods.\"Kill complete,\" Delta-One said, already accelerating the helicopter away fromthe area. \"Call the controller.\"Less than two miles away, President Zach Herney was preparing for bed. The Lexanbullet-proof windows of \"the residence\" were an inch thick. Herney never heardthe blast.97The Coast Guard Group Air Station Atlantic City is located in a secure sectionof William J. Hughes Federal Aviation Administration Technical Center at theAtlantic City International Airport. The group's area of responsibility includesthe Atlantic seaboard from Asbury Park to Cape May.Rachel Sexton jolted awake as the plane's tires screeched down on the tarmac ofthe lone runway nestled between two enormous cargo buildings. Surprised to findshe had fallen asleep, Rachel groggily checked her watch.2:13 A.M. She felt like she'd been asleep for days.A warm onboard blanket was tucked carefully around her, and Michael Tolland wasalso just waking up beside her. He gave her a weary smile.Corky staggered up the aisle and frowned when he saw them. \"Shit, you guys arestill here? I woke up hoping tonight had been a bad dream.\"Rachel knew exactly how he felt. I'm headed back out to sea.The plane taxied to a stop, and Rachel and the others climbed out onto a barrenrunway. The night was over-cast, but the coastal air felt heavy and warm. Incomparison to Ellesmere, New Jersey felt like the tropics.\"Over here!\" a voice called out.Rachel and the others turned to see one of the Coast Guard's classic,crimson-colored HH-65 Dolphin helicopters waiting nearby. Framed by thebrilliant white stripe on the chopper's tail, a fully suited pilot waved themover.Tolland gave Rachel an impressed nod. \"Your boss certainly gets things done.\"You have no idea, she thought.Corky slumped. \"Already? No dinner stop?\"The pilot welcomed them over and helped them aboard. Never asking their names,he spoke exclusively in pleasantries and safety precautions. Pickering hadapparently made it clear to the Coast Guard that this flight was not anadvertised mission. Nonetheless, despite Pickering's discretion, Rachel couldsee that their identities had remained a secret for only a matter of seconds;the pilot failed to hide his wide-eyed double take upon seeing televisioncelebrity Michael Tolland.Rachel was already feeling tense as she buckled herself in beside Tolland. TheAerospatiale engine overhead shrieked to life, and the Dolphin's saggingthirty-nine-foot rotors began to flatten out into a silver blur. The whineturned to a roar, and it lifted off the runway, climbing into the night.The pilot turned in the cockpit and called out, \"I was informed you would tellme your destination once we were airborne.\"Tolland gave the pilot the coordinates of an offshore location about thirtymiles southeast of their current position.His ship is twelve miles off the coast, Rachel thought, feeling a shiver.The pilot typed the coordinates into his navigation system. Then he settled inand gunned the engines. The chopper tipped forward and banked southeast.As the dark dunes of the New Jersey coast slipped away beneath the aircraft,Rachel turned her eyes away from the blackness of the ocean spreading outbeneath her. Despite the wariness of being back over the water again, she triedto take comfort in knowing she was accompanied by a man who had made the ocean alifetime friend. Tolland was pressed close beside her in the narrow fuselage,his hips and shoulders touching hers. Neither made any attempt to shiftpositions.\"I know I shouldn't say this,\" the pilot sputtered suddenly, as if ready toburst with excitement, \"but you're obviously Michael Tolland, and I've got tosay, well, we've been watching you on TV all night! The meteorite! It'sabsolutely incredible! You must be in awe!\"Tolland nodded patiently. \"Speechless.\"\"The documentary was fantastic! You know, the networks keep playing it over andover. None of tonight's duty pilots wanted this gig because everyone wanted tokeep watching television, but I drew short straw. Can you believe it! Shortstraw! And here I am! If the boys had any idea I'd be flying the actual –\"\"We appreciate the ride,\" Rachel interrupted, \"and we need you to keep ourpresence here to yourself. Nobody's supposed to know we're here.\"\"Absolutely, ma'am. My orders were very clear.\" The pilot hesitated, and thenhis expression brightened. \"Hey, we aren't by any chance heading for the Goya,are we?\"Tolland gave a reluctant nod. \"We are.\"\"Holy shit!\" the pilot exclaimed. \"Excuse me. Sorry, but I've seen her on yourshow. The twin-hull, right? Strange-looking beast! I've never actually been on aSWATH design. I never dreamed yours would be the first!\"Rachel tuned the man out, feeling a rising uneasiness to be heading out to sea.Tolland turned to her. \"You okay? You could have stayed onshore. I told youthat.\"I should have stayed onshore, Rachel thought, knowing pride would never have lether. \"No thanks, I'm fine.\"Tolland smiled. \"I'll keep an eye on you.\"\"Thanks.\" Rachel was surprised how the warmth in his voice made her feel moresecure.\"You've seen the Goya on television, right?\"She nodded. \"It's a... um... an interesting-looking ship.\"Tolland laughed. \"Yeah. She was an extremely progressive prototype in her day,but the design never quite caught on.\"\"Can't imagine why,\" Rachel joked, picturing the ship's bizarre profile.\"Now NBC is pressuring me to use a newer ship. Something... I don't know,flashier, sexier. Another season or two, and they'll make me part with her.\"Tolland sounded melancholy at the thought.\"You wouldn't love a brand-new ship?\"\"I don't know... a lot of memories onboard the Goya.\"Rachel smiled softly. \"Well, as my mom used to say, sooner or later we've allgot to let go of our past.\"Tolland's eyes held hers for a long moment. \"Yeah, I know.\"98\"Shit,\" the taxi driver said, looking over his shoulder at Gabrielle. \"Lookslike an accident up ahead. We ain't going nowhere. Not for a while.\"Gabrielle glanced out the window and saw the spinning lights of emergencyvehicles piercing the night. Several policemen stood in the road ahead, haltingtraffic around the Mall.\"Must be a hell of an accident,\" the driver said, motioning toward some flamesnear the FDR Memorial.Gabrielle frowned at the flickering glow. Now, of all times. She needed to getto Senator Sexton with this new information about PODS and the Canadiangeologist. She wondered if NASA's lies about how they found the meteorite wouldbe a big enough scandal to breathe life back into Sexton's campaign. Maybe notfor most politicians, she thought, but this was Sedgewick Sexton, a man who hadbuilt his campaign on amplifying the failures of others.Gabrielle was not always proud of the senator's ability to put negative ethicalspin on opponents' political misfortunes, but it was effective. Sexton's masteryof innuendo and indignity could probably turn this one compartmentalized NASAfib into a sweeping question of character that infected the entire space agency– and by association, the President.Outside the window, the flames at the FDR Memorial seemed to climb higher. Somenearby trees had caught fire, and the fire trucks were now hosing them down. Thetaxi driver turned on the car radio and began channel-surfing.Sighing, Gabrielle closed her eyes and felt the exhaustion roll over her inwaves. When she'd first come to Washington, she'd dreamed of working in politicsforever, maybe someday in the White House. At the moment, however, she felt likeshe'd had enough politics for a lifetime – the duel with Marjorie Tench, thelewd photographs of herself and the senator, all of NASA's lies...A newscaster on the radio was saying something about a car bomb and possibleterrorism.I've got to get out of this town, Gabrielle thought for the first time sincecoming to the nation's capital.99The controller seldom felt weary, but today had taken its toll. Nothing had goneas anticipated – the tragic discovery of the insertion shaft in the ice, thedifficulties of keeping the information a secret, and now the growing list ofvictims.Nobody was supposed to die... except the Canadian.It seemed ironic that the most technically difficult part of the plan had turnedout to be the least problematic. The insertion, completed months ago, had comeoff without a hitch. Once the anomaly was in place, all that remained was towait for the Polar Orbiting Density Scanner (PODS) satellite to launch. PODS wasslated to scan enormous sections of the Arctic Circle, and sooner or later theanomaly software onboard would detect the meteorite and give NASA a major find.But the damned software didn't work.When the controller learned that the anomaly software had failed and had nochance of being fixed until after the election, the entire plan was in jeopardy.Without PODS, the meteorite would go undetected. The controller had to come upwith some way to surreptitiously alert someone in NASA to the meteorite'sexistence. The solution involved orchestrating an emergency radio transmissionfrom a Canadian geologist in the general vicinity of the insertion. Thegeologist, for obvious reasons, had to be killed immediately and his death madeto look accidental. Throwing an innocent geologist from a helicopter had beenthe beginning. Now things were unraveling fast.Wailee Ming. Norah Mangor. Both dead.The bold kill that had just taken place at the FDR Memorial.Soon to be added to the list were Rachel Sexton, Michael Tolland, and Dr.Marlinson.There is no other way, the controller thought, fighting the growing remorse. Fartoo much is at stake.100The Coast Guard Dolphin was still two miles from the Goya's coordinates andflying at three thousand feet when Tolland yelled up to the pilot.\"Do you have NightSight onboard this thing?\"The pilot nodded. \"I'm a rescue unit.\"Tolland had expected as much. NightSight was Raytheon's marine thermal imagingsystem, capable of locating wreck survivors in the dark. The heat given off by aswimmer's head would appear as a red speck on an ocean of black.\"Switch it on,\" Tolland said.The pilot looked confused. \"Why? You missing someone?\"\"No. I want everyone to see something.\"\"We won't see a thing on thermal from this high up unless there's a burning oilslick.\"\"Just switch it on,\" Tolland said.The pilot gave Tolland an odd look and then adjusted some dials, commanding thethermal lens beneath the chopper to survey a three-mile swatch of ocean in frontof them. An LCD screen on his dashboard lit up. The image came into focus.\"Holy shit!\" The helicopter lurched momentarily as the pilot recoiled insurprise and then recovered, staring at the screen.Rachel and Corky leaned forward, looking at the image with equal surprise. Theblack background of the ocean was illuminated by an enormous swirling spiral ofpulsating red.Rachel turned to Tolland with trepidation. \"It looks like a cyclone.\"\"It is,\" Tolland said. \"A cyclone of warm currents. About a half mile across.\"The Coast Guard pilot chuckled in amazement. \"That's a big one. We see these nowand then, but I hadn't heard about this one yet.\"\"Just surfaced last week,\" Tolland said. \"Probably won't last more than anotherfew days.\"\"What causes it?\" Rachel asked, understandably perplexed by the huge vortex ofswirling water in the middle of the ocean.\"Magma dome,\" the pilot said.Rachel turned to Tolland, looking wary. \"A volcano?\"\"No,\" Tolland said. \"The East Coast typically doesn't have active volcanoes, butoccasionally we get rogue pockets of magma that well up under the seafloor andcause hot spots. The hot spot causes a reverse temperature gradient – hot wateron the bottom and cooler water on top. It results in these giant spiralcurrents. They're called megaplumes. They spin for a couple of weeks and thendissipate.\"The pilot looked at the pulsating spiral on his LCD screen. \"Looks like thisone's still going strong.\" He paused, checking the coordinates of Tolland'sship, and then looked over his shoulder in surprise. \"Mr. Tolland, it looks likeyou're parked fairly near the middle of it.\"Tolland nodded. \"Currents are a little slower near the eye. Eighteen knots. Likeanchoring in a fast-moving river. Our chain's been getting a real workout thisweek.\"\"Jesus,\" the pilot said. \"Eighteen-knot current? Don't fall overboard!\" Helaughed.Rachel did not laugh. \"Mike, you didn't mention this megaplume, magma dome,hot-current situation.\"He put a reassuring hand on her knee. \"It's perfectly safe, trust me.\"Rachel frowned. \"So this documentary you were making out here was about thismagma dome phenomenon?\"\"Megaplumes and Sphyrna mokarran.\"\"That's right. You mentioned that earlier.\"Tolland gave a coy smile. \"Sphyrna mokarran love warm water, and right now,every last one for a hundred miles is congregating in this mile-wide circle ofheated ocean.\"\"Neat.\" Rachel gave an uneasy nod. \"And what, pray tell, are Sphyrna mokarran?\"\"Ugliest fish in the sea.\"\"Flounder?\"Tolland laughed. \"Great hammerhead shark.\"Rachel stiffened beside him. \"You've got hammerhead sharks around your boat?\"Tolland winked. \"Relax, they're not dangerous.\"\"You wouldn't say that unless they were dangerous.\"Tolland chuckled. \"I guess you're right.\" He called playfully up to the pilot.\"Hey, how long has it been since you guys saved anyone from an attack by ahammerhead?\"The pilot shrugged. \"Gosh. We haven't saved anyone from a hammerhead indecades.\"Tolland turned to Rachel. \"See. Decades. No worries.\"\"Just last month,\" the pilot added, \"we had an attack where some idiot skindiver was chumming –\"\"Hold on!\" Rachel said. \"You said you hadn't saved anyone in decades!\"\"Yeah,\" the pilot replied. \"Saved anyone. Usually, we're too late. Thosebastards kill in a hurry.\""},{"pageContent":"101From the air, the flickering outline of the Goya loomed on the horizon. At halfa mile, Tolland could make out the brilliant deck lights that his crewmemberXavia had wisely left glowing. When he saw the lights, he felt like a wearytraveler pulling into his driveway.\"I thought you said only one person was onboard,\" Rachel said, looking surprisedto see all the lights.\"Don't you leave a light on when you're home alone?\"\"One light. Not the entire house.\"Tolland smiled. Despite Rachel's attempts to be lighthearted, he could tell shewas extremely apprehensive about being out here. He wanted to put an arm aroundher and reassure her, but he knew there was nothing he could say. \"The lightsare on for security. Makes the ship look active.\"Corky chuckled. \"Afraid of pirates, Mike?\"\"Nope. Biggest danger out here is the idiots who don't know how to read radar.Best defense against getting rammed is to make sure everyone can see you.\"Corky squinted down at the glowing vessel. \"See you? It looks like a CarnivalCruise line on New Year's Eve. Obviously, NBC pays your electric.\"The Coast Guard chopper slowed and banked around the huge illuminated ship, andthe pilot began maneuvering toward the helipad on the stern deck. Even from theair, Tolland could make out the raging current pulling at the ship's hullstruts. Anchored from its bow, the Goya was aimed into the current, straining atits massive anchor line like a chained beast.\"She really is a beauty,\" the pilot said, laughing.Tolland knew the comment was sarcastic. The Goya was ugly. \"Butt-ugly\" accordingto one television reviewer. One of only seventeen SWATH ships ever built, theGoya's Small-Waterplane-Area Twin-Hull was anything but attractive.The vessel was essentially a massive horizontal platform floating thirty feetabove the ocean on four huge struts affixed to pontoons. From a distance, theship looked like a low-slung drilling platform. Up close, it resembled a deckbarge on stilts. The crew quarters, research labs, and navigation bridge werehoused in a series of tiered structures on top, giving one the rough impressionof a giant floating coffee table supporting a hodgepodge of multistagedbuildings.Despite its less than streamlined appearance, the Goya's design enjoyedsignificantly less water-plane area, resulting in increased stability. Thesuspended platform enabled better filming, easier lab work, and fewer seasickscientists. Although NBC was pressuring Tolland to let them buy him somethingnewer, Tolland had refused. Granted, there were better ships out there now, evenmore stable ones, but the Goya had been his home for almost a decade now – theship on which he had fought his way back after Celia's death. Some nights hestill heard her voice in the wind out on deck. If and when the ghosts everdisappeared, Tolland would consider another ship.Not yet.When the chopper finally set down on the Goya's stern deck, Rachel Sexton feltonly half-relieved. The good news was that she was no longer flying over theocean. The bad news was that she was now standing on it. She fought off theshaky sensation in her legs as she climbed onto the deck and looked around. Thedeck was surprisingly cramped, particularly with the helicopter on its pad.Moving her eyes toward the bow, Rachel gazed at the ungainly, stacked edificethat made up the bulk of the ship.Tolland stood close beside her. \"I know,\" he said, talking loudly over the soundof the raging current. \"It looks bigger on television.\"Rachel nodded. \"And more stable.\"\"This is one of the safest ships on the sea. I promise.\" Tolland put a hand onher shoulder and guided her across the deck.The warmth of his hand did more to calm Rachel's nerves than anything he couldhave said. Nonetheless, as she looked toward the rear of the ship, she saw theroiling current streaming out behind them as though the ship was at fullthrottle. We're sitting on a megaplume, she thought.Centered on the foremost section of rear deck, Rachel spied a familiar, one-manTriton submersible hanging on a giant winch. The Triton – named for the Greekgod of the sea – looked nothing like its predecessor, the steel-encased Alvin.The Triton had a hemispherical acrylic dome in front, making it look more like agiant fishbowl than a sub. Rachel could think of few things more terrifying thansubmerging hundreds of feet into the ocean with nothing between her face and theocean but a sheet of clear acrylic. Of course, according to Tolland, the onlyunpleasant part of riding in the Triton was the initial deployment – beingslowly winched down through the trap door in the Goya's deck, hanging like apendulum thirty feet above the sea.\"Xavia is probably in the hydrolab,\" Tolland said, moving across the deck. \"Thisway.\"Rachel and Corky followed Tolland across the stern deck. The Coast Guard pilotremained in his chopper with strict instructions not to use the radio.\"Have a look at this,\" Tolland said, pausing at the stern railing of the ship.Hesitantly, Rachel neared the railing. They were very high up. The water was agood thirty feet below them, and yet Rachel could still feel the heat rising offthe water.\"It's about the temperature of a warm bath,\" Tolland said over the sound of thecurrent. He reached toward a switch-box on the railing. \"Watch this.\" He flippeda switch.A wide arc of light spread through the water behind the ship, illuminating itfrom within like a lit swimming pool. Rachel and Corky gasped in unison.The water around the ship was filled with dozens of ghostly shadows. Hoveringonly feet below the illuminated surface, armies of sleek, dark forms swam inparallel against the current, their unmistakable hammer-shaped skulls waggingback and forth as if to the beat of some prehistoric rhythm.\"Christ, Mike,\" Corky stammered. \"So glad you shared this with us.\"Rachel's body went rigid. She wanted to step back from the railing, but shecould not move. She was transfixed by the petrifying vista.\"Incredible, aren't they?\" Tolland said. His hand was on her shoulder again,comforting. \"They'll tread water in the warm spots for weeks. These guys havethe best noses in the sea – enhanced telencephalon olfactory lobes. They cansmell blood up to a mile away.\"Corky looked skeptical. \"Enhanced telencephalon olfactory lobes?\"\"Don't believe me?\" Tolland began rooting around in an aluminum cabinet adjacentto where they were standing. After a moment, he pulled out a small, dead fish.\"Perfect.\" He took a knife from the cooler and cut the limp fish in severalplaces. It started to drip blood.\"Mike, for God's sake,\" Corky said. \"That's disgusting.\"Tolland tossed the bloody fish overboard and it fell thirty feet. The instant ithit the water, six or seven sharks darted in a tumbling ferocious brawl, theirrows of silvery teeth gnashing wildly at the bloody fish. In an instant, thefish was gone.Aghast, Rachel turned and stared at Tolland, who was already holding anotherfish. Same kind. Same size.\"This time, no blood,\" Tolland said. Without cutting the fish, he threw it inthe water. The fish splashed down, but nothing happened. The hammerheads seemednot to notice. The bait carried away on the current, having drawn no interestwhatsoever.\"They attack only on sense of smell,\" Tolland said, leading them away from therailing. \"In fact, you could swim out here in total safety – provided you didn'thave any open wounds.\"Corky pointed to the stitches on his cheek.Tolland frowned. \"Right. No swimming for you.\"102Gabrielle Ashe's taxi was not moving.Sitting at a roadblock near the FDR Memorial, Gabrielle looked out at theemergency vehicles in the distance and felt as if a surrealistic fog bank hadsettled over the city. Radio reports were coming in now that the exploded carmight have contained a high-level government official.Pulling out her cellphone, she dialed the senator. He was no doubt starting towonder what was taking Gabrielle so long.The line was busy.Gabrielle looked at the taxi's clicking meter and frowned. Some of the othercars stuck here were pulling up onto the curbs and turning around to findalternative routes.The driver looked over his shoulder. \"You wanna wait? Your dime.\"Gabrielle saw more official vehicles arriving now. \"No. Let's go around.\"The driver grunted in the affirmative and began maneuvering the awkwardmultipoint turn. As they bounced over the curbs, Gabrielle tried Sexton again.Still busy.Several minutes later, having made a wide loop, the taxi was traveling up CStreet. Gabrielle saw the Philip A. Hart Office Building looming. She hadintended to go straight to the senator's apartment, but with her office thisclose...\"Pull over,\" she blurted to the driver. \"Right there. Thanks.\" She pointed.The cab stopped.Gabrielle paid the amount on the meter and added ten dollars. \"Can you wait tenminutes?\"The cabbie looked at the money and then at his watch. \"Not a minute longer.\"Gabrielle hurried off. I'll be out in five.The deserted marble corridors of the Senate office building felt almostsepulchral at this hour. Gabrielle's muscles were tense as she hurried throughthe gauntlet of austere statues lining the third-floor entryway. Their stonyeyes seemed to follow her like silent sentinels.Arriving at the main door of Senator Sexton's five-room office suite, Gabrielleused her key card to enter. The secretarial lobby was dimly lit. Crossingthrough the foyer, she went down a hallway to her office. She entered, flickedon the fluorescent lights, and strode directly to her file cabinets.She had an entire file on the budgeting of NASA's Earth Observing System,including plenty of information on PODS. Sexton would certainly want all thedata he could possibly get on PODS as soon as she told him about Harper.NASA lied about PODS.As Gabrielle fingered her way through her files, her cellphone rang.\"Senator?\" she answered.\"No, Gabs. It's Yolanda.\" Her friend's voice had an unusual edge to it. \"Youstill at NASA?\"\"No. At the office.\"\"Find anything at NASA?\"You have no idea. Gabrielle knew she couldn't tell Yolanda anything until she'dtalked to Sexton; the senator would have very specific ideas about how best tohandle the information. \"I'll tell you all about it after I talk to Sexton.Heading over to his place now.\"Yolanda paused. \"Gabs, you know this thing you were saying about Sexton'scampaign finance and the SFF?\"\"I told you I was wrong and –\"\"I just found out two of our reporters who cover the aerospace industry havebeen working on a similar story.\"Gabrielle was surprised. \"Meaning?\"\"I don't know. But these guys are good, and they seem pretty convinced thatSexton is taking kickbacks from the Space Frontier Foundation. I just figured Ishould call you. I know I told you earlier that the idea was insane. MarjorieTench as a source seemed spotty, but these guys of ours... I don't know, youmight want to talk to them before you see the senator.\"\"If they're so convinced, why haven't they gone to press?\" Gabrielle soundedmore defensive than she wanted to.\"They have no solid evidence. The senator apparently is good at covering histracks.\"Most politicians are. \"There's nothing there, Yolanda. I told you the senatoradmitted taking SFF donations, but the gifts are all under the cap.\"\"I know that's what he told you, Gabs, and I'm not claiming to know what's trueor false here. I just felt obliged to call because I told you not to trustMarjorie Tench, and now I find out people other than Tench think the senator maybe on the dole. That's all.\"\"Who were these reporters?\" Gabrielle felt an unexpected anger simmering now.\"No names. I can set up a meeting. They're smart. They understand campaignfinance law...\" Yolanda hesitated. \"You know, these guy actually believe Sextonis hurting for cash – bankrupt even.\"In the silence of her office, Gabrielle could hear Tench's raspy accusationsechoing. After Katherine died, the senator squandered the vast majority of herlegacy on bad investments, personal comforts, and buying himself what appears tobe certain victory in the primaries. As of six months ago, your candidate wasbroke.\"Our men would love to talk to you,\" Yolanda said.I bet they would, Gabrielle thought. \"I'll call you back.\"\"You sound pissed.\"\"Never at you, Yolanda. Never at you. Thanks.\"Gabrielle hung up.Dozing on a chair in the hallway outside Senator Sexton's Westbrooke apartment,a security guard awoke with a start at the sound of his cellular phone. Boltingup in his chair, he rubbed his eyes and pulled his phone from his blazer pocket.\"Yeah?\"\"Owen, this is Gabrielle.\"Sexton's guard recognized her voice. \"Oh, hi.\"\"I need to talk to the senator. Would you knock on his door for me? His line isbusy.\"\"It's kind of late.\"\"He's awake. I'm sure of it.\" Gabrielle sounded anxious. \"It's an emergency.\"\"Another one?\"\"Same one. Just get him on the phone, Owen. There's something I really need toask him.\"The guard sighed, standing up. \"Okay, okay. I'll knock.\" He stretched and madehis way toward Sexton's door. \"But I'm only doing it because he was glad I letyou in earlier.\" Reluctantly, he raised his fist to knock.\"What did you just say?\" Gabrielle demanded.The guard's fist stopped in midair. \"I said the senator was glad I let you inearlier. You were right. It was no problem at all.\"\"You and the senator talked about that?\" Gabrielle sounded surprised.\"Yeah. So what?\"\"No, I just didn't think...\"\"Actually, it was kind of weird. The senator needed a couple of seconds to evenremember you'd been in there. I think the boys were tossing back a few.\"\"When did you two talk, Owen?\"\"Right after you left. Is something wrong?\"A momentary silence. \"No... no. Nothing. Look, now that I think of it, let's notbother the senator this instant. I'll keep trying his house line, and if I don'thave any luck, I'll call you back and you can knock.\"The guard rolled his eyes. \"Whatever you say, Ms. Ashe.\"\"Thanks, Owen. Sorry to bother you.\"\"No problem.\" The guard hung up, flopped back in his chair, and went to sleep.Alone in her office, Gabrielle stood motionless for several seconds beforehanging up the phone. Sexton knows I was inside his apartment... and he nevermentioned it to me?Tonight's ethereal strangeness was getting murkier. Gabrielle flashed on thesenator's phone call to her while she was at ABC. The senator had stunned herwith his unprovoked admission that he was meeting with space companies andaccepting money. His honesty had brought her back to him. Shamed her even. Hisconfession now seemed one hell of a lot less noble.Soft money, Sexton had said. Perfectly legal.Suddenly, all the vague misgivings Gabrielle had ever felt about Senator Sextonseemed to resurface all at once.Outside, the taxi was honking.103The bridge of the Goya was a Plexiglas cube situated two levels above the maindeck. From here Rachel had a 360-degree view of the surrounding darkened sea, anunnerving vista she looked at only once before blocking it out and turning herattention to the matter at hand.Having sent Tolland and Corky to find Xavia, Rachel prepared to contactPickering. She'd promised the director she would call him when they arrived, andshe was eager to know what he had learned in his meeting with Marjorie Tench.The Goya's SHINCOM 2100 digital communications system was a platform with whichRachel was familiar enough. She knew if she kept her call short, hercommunication should be secure.Dialing Pickering's private number, she waited, clutching the SHINCOM 2100receiver to her ear and waiting. She expected Pickering to pick up on the firstring. But the line just kept ringing.Six rings. Seven. Eight...Rachel gazed out at the darkened ocean, her inability to reach the directordoing nothing to quell her uneasiness about being at sea.Nine rings. Ten rings. Pick up!She paced, waiting. What was going on? Pickering carried his phone with him atall times, and he had expressly told Rachel to call him.After fifteen rings, she hung up.With growing apprehension, she picked up the SHINCOM receiver and dialed again.Four rings. Five rings.Where is he?Finally, the connection clicked open. Rachel felt a surge of relief, but it wasshort-lived. There was no one on the line. Only silence.\"Hello,\" she prompted. \"Director?\"Three quick clicks.\"Hello?\" Rachel said.A burst of electronic static shattered the line, blasting in Rachel's ear. Sheyanked the receiver away from her head in pain. The static abruptly stopped. Nowshe could hear a series of rapidly oscillating tones that pulsed in half-secondintervals. Rachel's confusion quickly gave way to realization. And then fear.\"Shit!\"Wheeling back to the controls on the bridge, she slammed the receiver down inits cradle, severing the connection. For several moments she stood terrified,wondering if she'd hung up in time.Amidships, two decks below, the Goya's hydrolab was an expansive work spacesegmented by long counters and islands packed to the gills with electronic gear– bottom profilers, current analyzers, wet sinks, fume hoods, a walk-in specimencooler, PCs, and a stack of organizer crates for research data and the spareelectronics to keep everything running.When Tolland and Corky entered, the Goya's onboard geologist, Xavia, wasreclining in front of a blaring television. She didn't even turn around.\"Did you guys run out of beer money?\" she called over her shoulder, apparentlythinking some of her crew had returned.\"Xavia,\" Tolland said. \"It's Mike.\"The geologist spun, swallowing part of a prepackaged sandwich she was eating.\"Mike?\" she stammered, clearly stunned to see him. She stood up, turned down thetelevision, and came over, still chewing. \"I thought some of the guys had comeback from bar-hopping. What are you doing here?\" Xavia was heavyset anddark-skinned, with a sharp voice and a surly air about her. She motioned to thetelevision, which was broadcasting replays of Tolland's on-site meteoritedocumentary. \"You sure didn't hang around on the ice shelf very long, did you?\"Something came up, Tolland thought. \"Xavia, I'm sure you recognize CorkyMarlinson.\"Xavia nodded. \"An honor, sir.\"Corky was eyeing the sandwich in her hand. \"That looks good.\"Xavia gave him an odd look.\"I got your message,\" Tolland said to Xavia. \"You said I made a mistake in mypresentation? I want to talk to you about it.\"The geologist stared at him and let out a shrill laugh. \"That's why you're back?Oh, Mike, for God's sake, I told you, it was nothing. I was just pulling yourchain. NASA obviously gave you some old data. Inconsequential. Seriously, onlythree or four marine geologists in the world might have noticed the oversight!\"Tolland held his breath. \"This oversight. Does it by any chance have anything todo with chondrules?\"Xavia's face went blank with shock. \"My God. One of those geologists called youalready?\"Tolland slumped. The chondrules. He looked at Corky and then back to the marinegeologist. \"Xavia, I need to know everything you can tell me about thesechondrules. What was the mistake I made?\"Xavia stared at him, apparently now sensing he was dead serious. \"Mike, it'sreally nothing. I read a small article in a trade journal a while back. But Idon't understand why you're so worried about this.\"Tolland sighed. \"Xavia, as strange as this may sound, the less you know tonight,the better. All I'm asking is for you to tell us what you know about chondrules,and then we'll need you to examine a rock sample for us.\"Xavia looked mystified and vaguely perturbed to be out of the loop. \"Fine, letme get you that article. It's in my office.\" She set her sandwich down andheaded for the door.Corky called after her. \"Can I finish that?\"Xavia paused, sounding incredulous. \"You want to finish my sandwich?\"\"Well, I just thought if you –\"\"Get your own damn sandwich.\" Xavia left.Tolland chuckled, motioning across the lab toward a specimen cooler. \"Bottomshelf, Corky. Between the sambuca and squid sacs.\"Outside on deck, Rachel descended the steep stairway from the bridge and strodetoward the chopper pad. The Coast Guard pilot was dozing but sat up when Rachelrapped on the cockpit.\"Done already?\" he asked. \"That was fast.\"Rachel shook her head, on edge. \"Can you run both surface and air radar?\"\"Sure. Ten-mile radius.\"\"Turn it on, please.\"Looking puzzled, the pilot threw a couple of switches and the radar screen litup. The sweep arm spun lazy circles.\"Anything?\" Rachel asked.The pilot let the arm make several complete rotations. He adjusted some controlsand watched. It was all clear. \"Couple of small ships way out on the periphery,but they're heading away from us. We're clear. Miles and miles of open sea inall directions.\"Rachel Sexton sighed, although she did not feel particularly relieved. \"Do me afavor, if you see anything approaching – boats, aircraft, anything – will youlet me know immediately?\"\"Sure thing. Is everything okay?\"\"Yeah. I'd just like to know if we're having company.\"The pilot shrugged. \"I'll watch the radar, ma'am. If anything blips, you'll bethe first to know.\"Rachel's senses were tingling as she headed for the hydrolab. When she entered,Corky and Tolland were standing alone in front of a computer monitor and chewingsandwiches.Corky called out to her with his mouth full. \"What'll it be? Fishy chicken,fishy bologna, or fishy egg salad?\"Rachel barely heard the question. \"Mike, how fast can we get this informationand get off this ship?\"104Tolland paced the hydrolab, waiting with Rachel and Corky for Xavia's return.The news about the chondrules was almost as discomforting as Rachel's news abouther attempted contact with Pickering.The director didn't answer.And someone tried to pulse-snitch the Goya's location.\"Relax,\" Tolland told everyone. \"We're safe. The Coast Guard pilot is watchingthe radar. He can give us plenty of warning if anyone is headed our way.\"Rachel nodded in agreement, although she still looked on edge.\"Mike, what the hell is this?\" Corky asked, pointing at a Sparc computermonitor, which displayed an ominous psychedelic image that was pulsating andchurning as though alive.\"Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler,\" Tolland said. \"It's a cross section of thecurrents and temperature gradients of the ocean underneath the ship.\"Rachel stared. \"That's what we're anchored on top of?\"Tolland had to admit, the image looked frightening. At the surface, the waterappeared as a swirling bluish green, but tracing downward, the colors slowlyshifted to a menacing red-orange as the temperatures heated up. Near the bottom,over a mile down, hovering above the ocean floor, a blood-red, cyclone vortexraged.\"That's the megaplume,\" Tolland said.Corky grunted. \"Looks like an underwater tornado.\"\"Same principle. Oceans are usually colder and more dense near the bottom, buthere the dynamics are reversed. The deepwater is heated and lighter, so it risestoward the surface. Meanwhile, the surface water is heavier, so it racesdownward in a huge spiral to fill the void. You get these drainlike currents inthe ocean. Enormous whirlpools.\"\"What's that big bump on the seafloor?\" Corky pointed at the flat expanse ofocean floor, where a large dome-shaped mound rose up like a bubble. Directlyabove it swirled the vortex.\"That mound is a magma dome,\" Tolland said. \"It's where lava is pushing upbeneath the ocean floor.\"Corky nodded. \"Like a huge zit.\"\"In a manner of speaking.\"\"And if it pops?\"Tolland frowned, recalling the famous 1986 megaplume event off the Juan de FucaRidge, where thousands of tons of twelve hundred degrees Celsius magma spewed upinto the ocean all at once, magnifying the plume's intensity almost instantly.Surface currents amplified as the vortex expanded rapidly upward. What happenednext was something Tolland had no intention of sharing with Corky and Rachelthis evening.\"Atlantic magma domes don't pop,\" Tolland said. \"The cold water circulating overthe mound continually cools and hardens the earth's crust, keeping the magmasafely under a thick layer of rock. Eventually the lava underneath cools, andthe spiral disappears. Megaplumes are generally not dangerous.\"Corky pointed toward a tattered magazine sitting near the computer. \"So you'resaying Scientific American publishes fiction?\"Tolland saw the cover, and winced. Someone had apparently pulled it from theGoya's archive of old science magazines: Scientific American, February 1999. Thecover showed an artist's rendering of a supertanker swirling out of control inan enormous funnel of ocean. The heading read: MEGAPLUMES – GIANT KILLERS FROMTHE DEEP?Tolland laughed it off. \"Totally irrelevant. That article is talking aboutmegaplumes in earthquake zones. It was a popular Bermuda Triangle hypothesis afew years back, explaining ship disappearances. Technically speaking, if there'ssome sort of cataclysmic geologic event on the ocean floor, which is unheard ofaround here, the dome could rupture, and the vortex could get big enough to...well, you know...\"\"No, we don't know,\" Corky said.Tolland shrugged. \"Rise to the surface.\"\"Terrific. So glad you had us aboard.\"Xavia entered carrying some papers. \"Admiring the megaplume?\"\"Oh, yes,\" Corky said sarcastically. \"Mike was just telling us how if thatlittle mound ruptures, we all go spiraling around in a big drain.\"\"Drain?\" Xavia gave a cold laugh. \"More like getting flushed down the world'slargest toilet.\"Outside on the deck of the Goya, the Coast Guard helicopter pilot vigilantlywatched the EMS radar screen. As a rescue pilot he had seen his share of fear inpeople's eyes; Rachel Sexton had definitely been afraid when she asked him tokeep an eye out for unexpected visitors to the Goya.What kind of visitors is she expecting? he wondered.From all the pilot could see, the sea and air for ten miles in all directionscontained nothing that looked out of the ordinary. A fishing boat eight milesoff. An occasional aircraft slicing across an edge of their radar field and thendisappearing again toward some unknown destination.The pilot sighed, gazing out now at the ocean rushing all around the ship. Thesensation was a ghostly one – that of sailing full speed despite being anchored.He returned his eyes to the radar screen and watched. Vigilant.105Onboard the Goya, Tolland had now introduced Xavia and Rachel. The ship'sgeologist was looking increasingly baffled by the distinguished entouragestanding before her in the hydrolab. In addition, Rachel's eagerness to run thetests and get off the ship as fast as possible was clearly making Xavia uneasy.Take your time, Xavia, Tolland willed her. We need to know everything.Xavia was talking now, her voice stiff. \"In your documentary, Mike, you saidthose little metallic inclusions in the rock could form only in space.\"Tolland already felt a tremor of apprehension. Chondrules form only in space.That's what NASA told me.\"But according to these notes,\" Xavia said, holding up the pages, \"that's notentirely true.\"Corky glared. \"Of course it's true!\"Xavia scowled at Corky and waved the notes. \"Last year a young geologist namedLee Pollock out of Drew University was using a new breed of marine robot to doPacific deepwater crust sampling in the Mariana Trench and pulled up a looserock that contained a geologic feature he had never seen before. The feature wasquite similar in appearance to chondrules. He called them 'plagioclase stressinclusions' – tiny bubbles of metal that apparently had been rehomogenizedduring deep ocean pressurization events. Dr. Pollock was amazed to find metallicbubbles in an ocean rock, and he formulated a unique theory to explain theirpresence.\"Corky grumbled. \"I suppose he would have to.\"Xavia ignored him. \"Dr. Pollock asserted that the rock formed in an ultradeepoceanic environment where extreme pressure metamorphosed a pre-existing rock,permitting some of the disparate metals to fuse.\"Tolland considered it. The Mariana Trench was seven miles down, one of the lasttruly unexplored regions on the planet. Only a handful of robotic probes hadever ventured that deep, and most had collapsed well before they reached thebottom. The water pressure in the trench was enormous – an astounding eighteenthousand pounds per square inch, as opposed to a mere twenty-four pounds on theocean's surface. Oceanographers still had very little understanding of thegeologic forces at the deepest ocean floor. \"So, this guy Pollock thinks theMariana Trench can make rocks with chondrulelike features?\"\"It's an extremely obscure theory,\" Xavia said. \"In fact, it's never even beenformally published. I only happened to stumble across Pollock's personal noteson the Web by chance last month when I was doing research on fluid-rockinteractions for our upcoming megaplume show. Otherwise, I never would haveheard of it.\"\"The theory has never been published,\" Corky said, \"because it's ridiculous. Youneed heat to form chondrules. There's no way water pressure could rearrange thecrystalline structure of a rock.\"\"Pressure,\" Xavia fired back, \"happens to be the single biggest contributor togeologic change on our planet. A little something called a metamorphic rock?Geology 101?\"Corky scowled.Tolland realized Xavia had a point. Although heat did play a role in some ofearth's metamorphic geology, most metamorphic rocks were formed by extremepressure. Incredibly, rocks deep in the earth's crust were under so muchpressure that they acted more like thick molasses than solid rock, becomingelastic and undergoing chemical changes as they did. Nonetheless, Dr. Pollock'stheory still seemed like a stretch.\"Xavia,\" Tolland said. \"I've never heard of water pressure alone chemicallyaltering a rock. You're the geologist, what's your take?\"\"Well,\" she said, flipping through her notes, \"it sounds like water pressureisn't the only factor.\" Xavia found a passage and read Pollock's notes verbatim.\"'Oceanic crust in the Mariana Trench, already under enormous hydrostaticpressurization, can find itself further compressed by tectonic forces from theregion's subduction zones.'\"Of course, Tolland thought. The Mariana Trench, in addition to being crushedunder seven miles of water, was a subduction zone – the compression line wherethe Pacific and Indian plates moved toward one another and collided. Combinedpressures in the trench could be enormous, and because the area was so remoteand dangerous to study, if there were chondrules down there, chances of anyoneknowing about it were very slim.Xavia kept reading. \"'Combined hydrostatic and tectonic pressures couldpotentially force crust into an elastic or semiliquid state, allowing lighterelements to fuse into chondrulelike structures thought to occur only in space.'\"Corky rolled his eyes. \"Impossible.\"Tolland glanced at Corky. \"Is there any alternative explanation for thechondrules in the rock Dr. Pollock found?\"\"Easy,\" Corky said. \"Pollock found an actual meteorite. Meteorites fall into theocean all the time. Pollock would not have suspected it was a meteorite becausethe fusion crust would have eroded away from years under the water, making itlook like a normal rock.\" Corky turned to Xavia. \"I don't suppose Pollock hadthe brains to measure the nickel content, did he?\"\"Actually, yes,\" Xavia fired back, flipping through the notes again. \"Pollockwrites: 'I was surprised to find the nickel content of the specimen fallingwithin a midrange value not usually associated with terrestrial rocks.'\"Tolland and Rachel exchanged startled looks.Xavia continued reading. \"'Although the quantity of nickel does not fall withinthe normally acceptable midrange window for meteoritic origin, it issurprisingly close.'\"Rachel looked troubled. \"How close? Is there any way this ocean rock could bemistaken for a meteorite?\"Xavia shook her head. \"I'm not a chemical petrologist, but as I understand it,there are numerous chemical differences between the rock Pollock found andactual meteorites.\"\"What are those differences?\" Tolland pressed.Xavia turned her attention to a graph in her notes. \"According to this, onedifference is in the chemical structure of the chondrules themselves. It lookslike the titanium/zirconium ratios differ. The titanium/ zirconium ratio in thechondrules of the ocean sample showed ultradepleted zirconium.\" She looked up.\"Only two parts per million.\"\"Two ppm?\" Corky blurted. \"Meteorites have thousands of times that!\"\"Exactly,\" Xavia replied. \"Which is why Pollock thinks his sample's chondrulesare not from space.\"Tolland leaned over and whispered to Corky, \"Did NASA happen to measure thetitanium/zirconium ratio in the Milne rock?\"\"Of course not,\" Corky sputtered. \"Nobody would ever measure that. It's likelooking at a car and measuring the tires' rubber content to confirm you'relooking at a car!\"Tolland heaved a sigh and looked back at Xavia. \"If we give you a rock samplewith chondrules in it, can you run a test to determine whether these inclusionsare meteoric chondrules or... one of Pollock's deep ocean compression things?\"Xavia shrugged. \"I suppose. The electron microprobe's accuracy should be closeenough. What's this all about, anyway?\"Tolland turned to Corky. \"Give it to her.\"Corky reluctantly pulled the meteorite sample from his pocket and held it outfor Xavia.Xavia's brow furrowed as she took the stone disk. She eyed the fusion crust andthen the fossil embedded in the rock. \"My God!\" she said, her head rocketingupward. \"This isn't part of...?\"\"Yeah,\" Tolland said. \"Unfortunately it is.\"106Alone in her office, Gabrielle Ashe stood at the window, wondering what to donext. Less than an hour ago, she had left NASA feeling full of excitement toshare Chris Harper's PODS fraud with the senator.Now, she wasn't so sure.According to Yolanda, two independent ABC reporters suspected Sexton of takingSFF bribes. Furthermore, Gabrielle had just learned that Sexton actually knewshe had snuck into his apartment during the SFF meeting, and yet he had saidnothing to her about it?Gabrielle sighed. Her taxi had long since departed, and although she would callanother in a few minutes, she knew there was something she had to do first.Am I really going to try this?Gabrielle frowned, knowing she didn't have a choice. She no longer knew whom totrust.Stepping out of her office, she made her way back into the secretarial lobby andinto a wide hallway on the opposite side. At the far end she could see themassive oak doors of Sexton's office flanked by two flags – Old Glory on theright and the Delaware flag on the left. His doors, like those of most senateoffices in the building, were steel reinforced and secured by conventional keys,an electronic key pad entry, and an alarm system.She knew if she could get inside, even if for only a few minutes, all theanswers would be revealed. Moving now toward the heavily secured doors,Gabrielle had no illusions of getting through them. She had other plans.Ten feet from Sexton's office, Gabrielle turned sharply to the right and enteredthe ladies' room. The fluorescents came on automatically, reflecting harshly offthe white tile. As her eyes adjusted, Gabrielle paused, seeing herself in themirror. As usual, her features looked softer than she'd hoped. Delicate almost.She always felt stronger than she looked.Are you sure you are ready to do this?Gabrielle knew Sexton was eagerly awaiting her arrival for a complete rundown onthe PODS situation. Unfortunately, she also now realized that Sexton had deftlymanipulated her tonight. Gabrielle Ashe did not like being managed. The senatorhad kept things from her tonight. The question was how much. The answers, sheknew, lay inside his office – just on the other side of this restroom wall.\"Five minutes,\" Gabrielle said aloud, mustering her resolve.Moving toward the bathroom's supply closet, she reached up and ran a hand overthe door frame. A key clattered to the floor. The cleaning crews at Philip A.Hart were federal employees and seemed to evaporate every time there was astrike of any sort, leaving this bathroom without toilet paper and tampons forweeks at a time. The women of Sexton's office, tired of being caught with theirpants down, had taken matters into their own hands and secured a supply room keyfor \"emergencies.\"Tonight qualifies, she thought.She opened the closet.The interior was cramped, packed with cleansers, mops, and shelves of papersupplies. A month ago, Gabrielle had been searching for paper towels when she'dmade an unusual discovery. Unable to reach the paper off the top shelf, she'dused the end of a broom to coax a roll to fall. In the process, she'd knockedout a ceiling tile. When she climbed up to replace the tile, she was surprisedto hear Senator Sexton's voice.Crystal clear.From the echo, she realized the senator was talking to himself while in hisoffice's private bathroom, which apparently was separated from this supplycloset by nothing more than removable, fiberboard ceiling tiles.Now, back in the closet tonight for far more than toilet paper, Gabrielle kickedoff her shoes, climbed up the shelves, popped out the fiberboard ceiling tile,and pulled herself up. So much for national security, she thought, wondering howmany state and federal laws she was about to break.Lowering herself through the ceiling of Sexton's private restroom, Gabrielleplaced her stockinged feet on his cold, porcelain sink and then dropped to thefloor. Holding her breath, she exited into Sexton's private office.His oriental carpets felt soft and warm.107Thirty miles away, a black Kiowa gunship chopper tore over the scrub pinetreetops of northern Delaware. Delta-One checked the coordinates locked in theauto navigation system.Although Rachel's shipboard transmission device and Pickering's cellphone wereencrypted to protect the contents of their communication, intercepting contenthad not been the goal when the Delta Force pulse-snitched Rachel's call fromsea. Intercepting the caller's position had been the goal. Global PositioningSystems and computerized triangulation made pinpointing transmission coordinatesa significantly easier task than decrypting the actual content of the call.Delta-One was always amused to think that most cellphone users had no idea thatevery time they made a call, a government listening post, if so inclined, coulddetect their position to within ten feet anywhere on earth – a small hitch thecellphone companies failed to advertise. Tonight, once the Delta Force hadgained access to the reception frequencies of William Pickering's cellularphone, they could easily trace the coordinates of his incoming calls.Flying now on a direct course toward their target, Delta-One closed to withintwenty miles. \"Umbrella primed?\" he asked, turning to Delta-Two, who was manningthe radar and weapons system.\"Affirmative. Awaiting five-mile range.\"Five miles, Delta-One thought. He had to fly this bird well within his target'sradar scopes to get within range to use the Kiowa's weapons systems. He hadlittle doubt that someone onboard the Goya was nervously watching the skies, andbecause the Delta Force's current task was to eliminate the target withoutgiving them a chance to radio for help, Delta-One now had to advance on his preywithout alarming them.At fifteen miles out, still safely out of radar range, Delta-One abruptly turnedthe Kiowa thirty-five degrees off course to the west. He climbed to threethousand feet – small airplane range – and adjusted his speed to 110 knots.On the deck of the Goya, the Coast Guard helicopter's radar scope beeped once asa new contact entered the ten-mile perimeter. The pilot sat up, studying thescreen. The contact appeared to be a small cargo plane headed west up the coast.Probably for Newark.Although this plane's current trajectory would bring it within four miles of theGoya, the flight path obviously was a matter of chance. Nonetheless, beingvigilant, the Coast Guard pilot watched the blinking dot trace a slow-moving110-knot line across the right side of his scope. At its closest point, theplane was about four miles west. As expected, the plane kept moving – headingaway from them now.4.1 miles. 4.2 miles.The pilot exhaled, relaxing.And then the strangest thing happened.\"Umbrella now engaged,\" Delta-Two called out, giving the thumbs-up from hisweapons control seat on the port side of the Kiowa gunship. \"Barrage, modulatednoise, and cover pulse are all activated and locked.\"Delta-One took his cue and banked hard to the right, putting the craft on adirect course with the Goya. This maneuver would be invisible to the ship'sradar.\"Sure beats bales of tinfoil!\" Delta-Two called out.Delta-One agreed. Radar jamming had been invented in WWII when a savvy Britishairman began throwing bales of hay wrapped in tinfoil out of his plane while onbombing runs. The Germans' radar spotted so many reflective contacts they had noidea what to shoot. The techniques had been improved on substantially sincethen.The Kiowa's onboard \"umbrella\" radar-jamming system was one of the military'smost deadly electronic combat weapons. By broadcasting an umbrella of backgroundnoise into the atmosphere above a given set of surface coordinates, the Kiowacould erase the eyes, ears, and voice of their target. Moments ago, all radarscreens aboard the Goya had most certainly gone blank. By the time the crewrealized they needed to call for help, they would be unable to transmit. On aship, all communications were radio-or microwave-based – no solid phone lines.If the Kiowa got close enough, all of the Goya's communications systems wouldstop functioning, their carrier signals blotted out by the invisible cloud ofthermal noise broadcast in front of the Kiowa like a blinding headlight.Perfect isolation, Delta-One thought. They have no defenses.Their targets had made a fortunate and cunning escape from the Milne Ice Shelf,but it would not be repeated. In choosing to leave shore, Rachel Sexton andMichael Tolland had chosen poorly. It would be the last bad decision they evermade.Inside the White House, Zach Herney felt dazed as he sat up in bed holding thetelephone receiver. \"Now? Ekstrom wants to speak to me now?\" Herney squintedagain at the bedside clock. 3:17 A.M.\"Yes, Mr. President,\" the communications officer said. \"He says it's anemergency.\"108While Corky and Xavia huddled over the electron microprobe measuring thezirconium content in the chondrules, Rachel followed Tolland across the lab intoan adjoining room. Here Tolland turned on another computer. Apparently theoceanographer had one more thing he wanted to check.As the computer powered up, Tolland turned to Rachel, his mouth poised as if hewanted to say something. He paused.\"What is it?\" Rachel asked, surprised how physically drawn to him she felt, evenin the midst of all this chaos. She wished she could block it all out and bewith him – just for a minute.\"I owe you an apology,\" Tolland said, looking remorseful.\"For what?\"\"On the deck? The hammerheads? I was excited. Sometimes I forget how frighteningthe ocean can be to a lot of people.\"Face-to-face with him, Rachel felt like a teenager standing on the doorstep witha new boyfriend. \"Thanks. No problem at all. Really.\" Something inside hersensed Tolland wanted to kiss her.After a beat, he turned shyly away. \"I know. You want to get to shore. We shouldget to work.\"\"For now.\" Rachel smiled softly.\"For now,\" Tolland repeated, taking a seat at the computer.Rachel exhaled, standing close behind now, savoring the privacy of the smalllab. She watched Tolland navigate a series of files. \"What are we doing?\"\"Checking the database for big ocean lice. I want to see if we can find anyprehistoric marine fossils that resemble what we saw in the NASA meteorite.\" Hepulled up a search page with bold letters across the top: PROJECT DIVERSITAS.Scrolling through the menus, Tolland explained, \"Diversitas is essentially acontinuously updated index of oceanic biodata. When a marine biologist discoversa new ocean species or fossil, he can toot his horn and share his find byuploading data and photos to a central databank. Because there's so much newdata discovered on a weekly basis, this is really the only way to keep researchup-to-date.\"Rachel watched Tolland navigating the menus. \"So you're accessing the Web now?\"\"No. Internet access is tricky at sea. We store all this data onboard on anenormous array of optical drives in the other room. Every time we're in port, wetie into Project Diversitas and update our databank with the newest finds. Thisway, we can access data at sea without a Web connection, and the data is nevermore than a month or two out of date.\" Tolland chuckled as he began typingsearch keywords into the computer. \"You've probably heard of the controversialmusic file-sharing program called Napster?\"Rachel nodded.\"Diversitas is considered the marine biologist's version of Napster. We call itLOBSTER – Lonely Oceanic Biologists Sharing Totally Eccentric Research.\"Rachel laughed. Even in this tense situation, Michael Tolland exuded a wry humorthat eased her fears. She was beginning to realize she'd had entirely too littlelaughter in her life lately.\"Our database is enormous,\" Tolland said, completing the entry of hisdescriptive keywords. \"Over ten tera-bytes of descriptions and photos. There'sinformation in here nobody has ever seen – and nobody ever will. Ocean speciesare simply too numerous.\" He clicked the \"search\" button. \"Okay, let's see ifanyone has ever seen an oceanic fossil similar to our little space bug.\"After a few seconds, the screen refreshed, revealing four listings of fossilizedanimals. Tolland clicked on each listing one by one and examined the photos.None looked remotely like the fossils in the Milne meteorite.Tolland frowned. \"Let's try something else.\" He removed the word \"fossil\" fromhis search string and hit \"search.\" \"We'll search all living species. Maybe wecan find a living descendant that has some of the physiological characteristicsof the Milne fossil.\"The screen refreshed.Again Tolland frowned. The computer had returned hundreds of entries. He sat amoment, stroking his now stubble-darkened chin. \"Okay, this is too much. Let'srefine the search.\"Rachel watched as he accessed a drop-down menu marked \"habitat.\" The list ofoptions looked endless: tide pool, marsh, lagoon, reef, mid-oceanic ridge,sulfur vents. Tolland scrolled down the list and chose an option that read:DESTRUCTIVE MARGINS/OCEANIC TRENCHES.Smart, Rachel realized. Tolland was limiting his search only to species thatlived near the environment where these chondrulelike features were hypothesizedto form.The page refreshed. This time Tolland smiled. \"Great. Only three entries.\"Rachel squinted at the first name on the list. Limulus poly... something.Tolland clicked the entry. A photo appeared; the creature looked like anoversized horseshoe crab without a tail.\"Nope,\" Tolland said, returning to the previous page.Rachel eyed the second item on the list. Shrimpus Uglius From Hellus. She wasconfused. \"Is that name for real?\"Tolland chuckled. \"No. It's a new species not yet classified. The guy whodiscovered it has a sense of humor. He's suggesting Shrimpus Uglius as theofficial taxonomical classification.\" Tolland clicked open the photo, revealingan exceptionally ugly shrimplike creature with whiskers and fluorescent pinkantennae.\"Aptly named,\" Tolland said. \"But not our space bug.\" He returned to the index.\"The final offering is...\" He clicked on the third entry, and the page came up.\"Bathynomous giganteus...\" Tolland read aloud as the text appeared. Thephotograph loaded. A full-color close-up.Rachel jumped. \"My God!\" The creature staring back at her gave her chills.Tolland drew a low breath. \"Oh boy. This guy looks kind of familiar.\"Rachel nodded, speechless. Bathynomous giganteus. The creature resembled a giantswimming louse. It looked very similar to the fossil species in the NASA rock.\"There are some subtle differences,\" Tolland said, scrolling down to someanatomical diagrams and sketches. \"But it's damn close. Especially consideringit has had 190 million years to evolve.\"Close is right, Rachel thought. Too close.Tolland read the description on the screen: \"'Thought to be one of the oldestspecies in the ocean, the rare and recently classified species Bathynomousgiganteus is a deepwater scavenging isopod resembling a large pill bug. Up totwo feet in length, this species exhibits a chitinous exoskeleton segmented intohead, thorax, abdomen. It possesses paired appendages, antennae, and compoundeyes like those of land-dwelling insects. This bottom-dwelling forager has noknown predators and lives in barren pelagic environments previously thought tobe uninhabitable.\" Tolland glanced up. \"Which could explain the lack of otherfossils in the sample!\"Rachel stared at the creature on-screen, excited and yet uncertain shecompletely understood what all of this meant.\"Imagine,\" Tolland said excitedly, \"that 190 million years ago, a brood of theseBathynomous creatures got buried in a deep ocean mud slide. As the mud turnsinto rock, the bugs get fossilized in stone. Simultaneously, the ocean floor,which is continuously moving like a slow conveyer belt toward the oceanictrenches, carries the fossils into a high-pressure zone where the rock formschondrules!\" Tolland was talking faster now. \"And if part of the fossilized,chondrulized crust broke off and ended up on the trench's accretionary wedge,which is not at all uncommon, it would be in a perfect position to bediscovered!\"\"But if NASA...,\" Rachel stammered. \"I mean, if this is all a lie, NASA musthave known that sooner or later someone would find out this fossil resembles asea creature, right? I mean we just found out!\"Tolland began printing the Bathynomous photos on a laser printer. \"I don't know.Even if someone stepped forward and pointed out the similarities between thefossils and a living sea louse, their physiologies are not identical. It almostproves NASA's case more strongly.\"Rachel suddenly understood. \"Panspermia.\" Life on earth was seeded from space.\"Exactly. Similarities between space organisms and earth organisms makeexcellent scientific sense. This sea louse actually strengthens NASA's case.\"\"Except if the meteorite's authenticity is in question.\"Tolland nodded. \"Once the meteorite comes into question, then everythingcollapses. Our sea louse turns from NASA friend to NASA linchpin.\"Rachel stood in silence as the Bathynomous pages rolled out of the printer. Shetried to tell herself this was all an honest NASA mistake, but she knew it wasnot. People who made honest mistakes didn't try to kill people.The nasal voice of Corky echoed suddenly across the lab. \"Impossible!\"Both Tolland and Rachel turned.\"Measure the damn ratio again! It makes no sense!\"Xavia came hurrying in with a computer printout clutched in her hand. Her facewas ashen. \"Mike, I don't know how to say this...\" Her voice cracked. \"Thetitanium/zirconium ratios we're seeing in this sample?\" She cleared her throat.\"It's pretty obvious that NASA made a huge mistake. Their meteorite is an oceanrock.\"Tolland and Rachel looked at each other but neither spoke a word. They knew.Just like that, all the suspicions and doubts had swelled up like the crest of awave, reaching the breaking point.Tolland nodded, a sadness in his eyes. \"Yeah. Thanks, Xavia.\"\"But I don't understand,\" Xavia said. \"The fusion crust... the location in theice –\"\"We'll explain on the way to shore,\" Tolland said. \"We're leaving.\"Quickly, Rachel collected all the papers and evidence they now had. The evidencewas shockingly conclusive: the GPR printout showing the insertion shaft in theMilne Ice Shelf; photos of a living sea louse resembling NASA's fossil; Dr.Pollock's article on ocean chondrules; and microprobe data showing ultradepletedzirconium in the meteorite.The conclusion was undeniable. Fraud.Tolland looked at the stack of papers in Rachel's hands and heaved a melancholysigh. \"Well, I'd say William Pickering has his proof.\"Rachel nodded, again wondering why Pickering had not answered his phone.Tolland lifted the receiver of a nearby phone, holding it out for her. \"You wantto try him again from here?\"\"No, let's get moving. I'll try to contact him from the chopper.\" Rachel hadalready decided if she could not make contact with Pickering, she'd have theCoast Guard fly them directly to the NRO, only about 180 miles.Tolland began to hang up the phone, but he paused. Looking confused, he listenedto the receiver, frowning. \"Bizarre. No dial tone.\"\"What do you mean?\" Rachel said, wary now.\"Weird,\" Tolland said. \"Direct COMSAT lines never lose carrier –\"\"Mr. Tolland?\" The Coast Guard pilot came rushing into the lab, his face white.\"What is it?\" Rachel demanded. \"Is someone coming?\"\"That's the problem,\" the pilot said. \"I don't know. All onboard radar andcommunications have just gone dead.\"Rachel stuffed the papers deep inside her shirt. \"Get in the helicopter. We'releaving. NOW!\"109Gabrielle's heart was racing as she crossed the darkened office of SenatorSexton. The room was as expansive as it was elegant – ornate wood-paneled walls,oil paintings, Persian carpets, leather rivet chairs, and a gargantuan mahoganydesk. The room was lit only by the eerie neon glow of Sexton's computer screen.Gabrielle moved toward his desk.Senator Sexton had embraced the \"digital office\" to maniacal proportions,eschewing the overflow of file cabinets for the compact, searchable simplicityof his personal computer, into which he fed enormous amounts of information –digitized meeting notes, scanned articles, speeches, brainstorms. Sexton'scomputer was his sacred ground, and he kept his office locked at all times toprotect it. He even refused to connect to the Internet for fear of hackersinfiltrating his sacred digital vault.A year ago Gabrielle would never have believed any politician would be stupidenough to store copies of self-incriminating documents, but Washington hadtaught her a lot. Information is power. Gabrielle had been amazed to learn thata common practice among politicians who accepted questionable campaigncontributions was to keep actual proof of those donations – letters, bankrecords, receipts, logs – all hidden away in a safe place. This counterblackmailtactic, euphemistically known in Washington as \"Siamese insurance,\" protectedcandidates from donors who felt their generosity somehow authorized them toassert undue political pressure on a candidate. If a contributor got toodemanding, the candidate could simply produce evidence of the illegal donationand remind the donor that both parties had broken the law. The evidence ensuredthat candidates and donors were joined at the hip forever – like Siamese twins.Gabrielle slipped behind the senator's desk and sat down. She took a deepbreath, looking at his computer. If the senator is accepting SFF bribes, anyevidence would be in here.Sexton's computer screensaver was an ongoing slideshow of the White House andits grounds created for him by one of his gung-ho staffers who was big intovisualization and positive thinking. Around the images crawled a ticker-tapebanner that read: President of the United States Sedgewick Sexton... Presidentof the United States Sedgewick Sexton... President of the...Gabrielle jostled the mouse, and a security dialogue box came up.ENTER PASSWORD:She expected this. It would not be a problem. Last week, Gabrielle had enteredSexton's office just as the senator was sitting down and logging onto hiscomputer. She saw him type three short keystrokes in rapid succession.\"That's a password?\" she challenged from the doorway as she walked in.Sexton glanced up. \"What?\"\"And here I thought you were concerned about security,\" Gabrielle scoldedgood-naturedly. \"Your password's only three keys? I thought the tech guys toldus all to use at least six.\"\"The tech guys are teenagers. They should try remembering six random letterswhen they're over forty. Besides, the door has an alarm. Nobody can get in.\"Gabrielle walked toward him, smiling. \"What if someone slipped in while you'rein the loo?\"\"And tried every combination of passwords?\" He gave a skeptical laugh. \"I'm slowin the bathroom, but not that slow.\"\"Dinner at Davide says I can guess your password in ten seconds.\"Sexton looked intrigued and amused. \"You can't afford Davide, Gabrielle.\"\"So you're saying you're chicken?\"Sexton appeared almost sorry for her as he accepted the challenge. \"Tenseconds?\" He logged off and motioned for Gabrielle to sit down and give it atry. \"You know I only order the saltimbocca at Davide. And that ain't cheap.\"She shrugged as she sat down. \"It's your money.\"ENTER PASSWORD:\"Ten seconds,\" Sexton reminded.Gabrielle had to laugh. She would need only two. Even from the doorway she couldsee that Sexton had entered his three-key password in very rapid successionusing only his index finger. Obviously all the same key. Not wise. She couldalso see that his hand had been positioned over the far left side of hiskeyboard – cutting the possible alphabet down to only about nine letters.Choosing the letter was simple; Sexton had always loved the triple alliterationof his title. Senator Sedgewick Sexton.Never underestimate the ego of a politician.She typed SSS, and the screensaver evaporated.Sexton's jaw hit the floor.That had been last week. Now, as Gabrielle faced his computer again, she wascertain Sexton would not have taken time yet to figure out how to set up adifferent password. Why would he? He trusts me implicitly.She typed in SSS.INVALID PASSWORD – ACCESS DENIEDGabrielle stared in shock.Apparently she had overestimated her senator's level of trust.110The attack came without warning. Low out of the southwest sky above the Goya,the lethal silhouette of a gunship helicopter bore down like a giant wasp.Rachel had no doubt what it was, or why it was here.Through the darkness, a staccato burst from the nose of the chopper sent atorrent of bullets chewing across the Goya's fiberglass deck, slashing a lineacross the stern. Rachel dove for cover too late and felt the searing slash of abullet graze her arm. She hit the ground hard, then rolled, scrambling to getbehind the bulbous transparent dome of the Triton submersible.A thundering of rotors exploded overhead as the chopper swooped past the ship.The noise evaporated with an eerie hiss as the chopper rocketed out over theocean and began a wide bank for a second pass.Lying trembling on the deck, Rachel held her arm and looked back at Tolland andCorky. Apparently having lunged to cover behind a storage structure, the two menwere now staggering to their feet, their eyes scanning the skies in terror.Rachel pulled herself to her knees. The entire world suddenly seemed to bemoving in slow motion.Crouched behind the transparent curvature of the Triton sub, Rachel looked inpanic toward their only means of escape – the Coast Guard helicopter. Xavia wasalready climbing into the chopper's cabin, frantically waving for everyone toget aboard. Rachel could see the pilot lunging into the cockpit, wildly throwingswitches and levers. The blades began to turn... ever so slowly.Too slowly.Hurry!Rachel felt herself standing now, preparing to run, wondering if she could makeit across the deck before the attackers made another pass. Behind her, she heardCorky and Tolland dashing toward her and the waiting helicopter. Yes! Hurry!Then she saw it.A hundred yards out, up in the sky, materializing out of empty darkness, apencil-thin beam of red light slanted across the night, searching the Goya'sdeck. Then, finding its mark, the beam came to a stop on the side of the waitingCoast Guard chopper.The image took only an instant to register. In that horrific moment, Rachel feltall the action on the deck of the Goya blur into a collage of shapes and sounds.Tolland and Corky dashing toward her – Xavia motioning wildly in the helicopter– the stark red laser slicing across the night sky.It was too late.Rachel spun back toward Corky and Tolland, who were running full speed nowtoward the helicopter. She lunged outward into their path, arms outstretchedtrying to stop them. The collision felt like a train wreck as the three of themcrashed to the deck in a tangle of arms and legs.In the distance, a flash of white light appeared. Rachel watched in disbeliefand horror as a perfectly straight line of exhaust fire followed the path of thelaser beam directly toward the helicopter.When the Hellfire missile slammed into the fuselage, the helicopter explodedapart like a toy. The concussion wave of heat and noise thundered across thedeck as flaming shrapnel rained down. The helicopter's flaming skeleton lurchedbackward on its shattered tail, teetered a moment, and then fell off the back ofthe ship, crashing into the ocean in a hissing cloud of steam.Rachel closed her eyes, unable to breathe. She could hear the flaming wreckagegurgling and sputtering as it sank, being dragged away from the Goya by theheavy currents. In the chaos, Michael Tolland's voice was yelling. Rachel felthis powerful hands trying to pull her to her feet. But she could not move.The Coast Guard pilot and Xavia are dead.We're next.111The weather on the Milne Ice Shelf had settled, and the habisphere was quiet.Even so, NASA administrator Lawrence Ekstrom had not even tried to sleep. He hadspent the hours alone, pacing the dome, staring into the extraction pit, runninghis hands over the grooves in the giant charred rock.Finally, he'd made up his mind.Now he sat at the videophone in the habisphere's PSC tank and looked into theweary eyes of the President of the United States. Zach Herney was wearing abathrobe and did not look at all amused. Ekstrom knew he would be significantlyless amused when he learned what Ekstrom had to tell him.When Ekstrom finished talking, Herney had an uncomfortable look on his face – asif he thought he must still be too asleep to have understood correctly.\"Hold on,\" Herney said. \"We must have a bad connection. Did you just tell methat NASA intercepted this meteorite's coordinates from an emergency radiotransmission – and then pretended that PODS found the meteorite?\"Ekstrom was silent, alone in the dark, willing his body to awake from thisnightmare.The silence clearly did not sit well with the President. \"For Christ's sake,Larry, tell me this isn't true!\"Ekstrom's mouth went dry. \"The meteorite was found, Mr. President. That is allthat's relevant here.\"\"I said tell me this is not true!\"The hush swelled to a dull roar in Ekstrom's ears. I had to tell him, Ekstromtold himself. It's going to get worse before it gets better. \"Mr. President, thePODS failure was killing you in the polls, sir. When we intercepted a radiotransmission that mentioned a large meteorite lodged in the ice, we saw a chanceto get back in the fight.\"Herney sounded stunned. \"By faking a PODS discovery?\"\"PODS was going to be up and running soon, but not soon enough for the election.The polls were slipping, and Sexton was slamming NASA, so...\"\"Are you insane! You lied to me, Larry!\"\"The opportunity was staring us in the face, sir. I decided to take it. Weintercepted the radio transmission of the Canadian who made the meteoritediscovery. He died in a storm. Nobody else knew the meteorite was there. PODSwas orbiting in the area. NASA needed a victory. We had the coordinates.\"\"Why are you telling me this now?\"\"I thought you should know.\"\"Do you know what Sexton would do with this information if he found out?\"Ekstrom preferred not to think about it.\"He'd tell the world that NASA and the White House lied to the American people!And you know what, he'd be right!\"\"You did not lie, sir, I did. And I will step down if –\"\"Larry, you're missing the point. I've tried to run this presidency on truth anddecency! Goddamn it! Tonight was clean. Dignified. Now I find out I lied to theworld?\"\"Only a small lie, sir.\"\"There's no such thing, Larry,\" Herney said, steaming.Ekstrom felt the tiny room closing in around him. There was so much more to tellthe President, but Ekstrom could see it should wait until morning. \"I'm sorry tohave woken you, sir. I just thought you should know.\"Across town, Sedgewick Sexton took another hit of cognac and paced his apartmentwith rising irritation.Where the hell is Gabrielle?112Gabrielle Ashe sat in the darkness at Senator Sexton's desk and gave hiscomputer a despondent scowl.INVALID PASSWORD – ACCESS DENIEDShe had tried several other passwords that seemed likely possibilities, but nonehad worked. After searching the office for any unlocked drawers or stray clues,Gabrielle had all but given up. She was about to leave when she spottedsomething odd, shimmering on Sexton's desk calendar. Someone had outlined thedate of the election in a red, white, and blue glitter pen. Certainly not thesenator. Gabrielle pulled the calendar closer. Emblazoned across the date was afrilly, glittering exclamation: POTUS!Sexton's ebullient secretary had apparently glitterpainted some more positivethinking for him for election day. The acronym POTUS was the U.S. SecretService's code name for President of the United States. On election day, if allwent well, Sexton would become the new POTUS.Preparing to leave, Gabrielle realigned the calendar on his desk and stood up.She paused suddenly, glancing back at the computer screen.ENTER PASSWORD:She looked again at the calendar.POTUS.She felt a sudden surge of hope. Something about POTUS struck Gabrielle as beinga perfect Sexton password. Simple, positive, self-referential.She quickly typed in the letters.POTUSHolding her breath, she hit \"return.\" The computer beeped.INVALID PASSWORD – ACCESS DENIEDSlumping, Gabrielle gave up. She headed back toward the bathroom door to exitthe way she had come. She was halfway across the room, when her cellphone rang.She was already on edge, and the sound startled her. Stopping short, she pulledout her phone and glanced up to check the time on Sexton's prized Jourdaingrandfather clock. Almost 4:00 A.M. At this hour, Gabrielle knew the callercould only be Sexton. He was obviously wondering where the hell she was. Do Ipick up or let it ring? If she answered, Gabrielle would have to lie. But if shedidn't, Sexton would get suspicious.She took the call. \"Hello?\"\"Gabrielle?\" Sexton sounded impatient. \"What's keeping you?\"\"The FDR Memorial,\" Gabrielle said. \"The taxi got hemmed in, and now we're –\"\"You don't sound like you're in a taxi.\"\"No,\" she said, her blood pumping now. \"I'm not. I decided to stop by my officeand pick up some NASA documents that might be relevant to PODS. I'm having sometrouble finding them.\"\"Well, hurry up. I want to schedule a press conference for the morning, and weneed to talk specifics.\"\"I'm coming soon,\" she said.There was a pause on the line. \"You're in your office?\" He sounded suddenlyconfused.\"Yeah. Another ten minutes and I'll be on my way over.\"Another pause. \"Okay. I'll see you soon.\"Gabrielle hung up, too preoccupied to notice the loud and distinctivetriple-tick of Sexton's prized Jourdain grandfather clock only a few feet away.113Michael Tolland did not realize Rachel was hurt until he saw the blood on herarm as he pulled her to cover behind the Triton. He sensed from the catatoniclook on her face that she was not aware of any pain. Steadying her, Tollandwheeled to find Corky. The astrophysicist scrambled across the deck to jointhem, his eyes blank with terror.We've got to find cover, Tolland thought, the horror of what had just happenednot yet fully registering. Instinctively, his eyes raced up the tiers of decksabove them. The stairs leading up to the bridge were all in the open, and thebridge itself was a glass box – a transparent bull's-eye from the air. Going upwas suicide, which left only one other direction to go.For a fleeting instant, Tolland turned a hopeful gaze to the Triton submersible,wondering perhaps if he could get everyone underwater, away from the bullets.Absurd. The Triton had room for one person, and the deployment winch took a goodten minutes to lower the sub through the trap door in the deck to the oceanthirty feet below. Besides, without properly charged batteries and compressors,the Triton would be dead in the water.\"Here they come!\" Corky shouted, his voice shrill with fear as he pointed intothe sky.Tolland didn't even look up. He pointed to a nearby bulkhead, where an aluminumramp descended belowdecks. Corky apparently needed no encouragement. Keeping hishead low, Corky scurried toward the opening and disappeared down the incline.Tolland put a firm arm around Rachel's waist and followed. The two of themdisappeared belowdecks just as the helicopter returned, spraying bulletsoverhead.Tolland helped Rachel down the grated ramp to the suspended platform at thebottom. As they arrived, Tolland could feel Rachel's body go suddenly rigid. Hewheeled, fearing maybe she'd been hit by a ricocheting bullet.When he saw her face, he knew it was something else. Tolland followed herpetrified gaze downward and immediately understood.Rachel stood motionless, her legs refusing to move. She was staring down at thebizarre world beneath her.Because of its SWATH design, the Goya had no hull but rather struts like a giantcatamaran. They had just descended through the deck onto a grated catwalk thathung above an open chasm, thirty feet straight down to the raging sea. The noisewas deafening here, reverberating off the underside of the deck. Adding toRachel's terror was the fact that the ship's underwater spotlights were stillilluminated, casting a greenish effulgence deep into the ocean directly beneathher. She found herself gazing down at six or seven ghostly silhouettes in thewater. Enormous hammerhead sharks, their long shadows swimming in place againstthe current – rubbery bodies flexing back and forth.Tolland's voice was in her ear. \"Rachel, you're okay. Eyes straight ahead. I'mright behind you.\" His hands were reaching around from behind, gently trying tocoax her clenched fists off the banister. It was then that Rachel saw thecrimson droplet of blood roll off her arm and fall through the grating. Her eyesfollowed the drip as it plummeted toward the sea. Although she never saw it hitthe water, she knew the instant it happened because all at once the hammerheadsspun in unison, thrusting with their powerful tails, crashing together in aroiling frenzy of teeth and fins.Enhanced telencephalon olfactory lobes...They smell blood a mile away.\"Eyes straight ahead,\" Tolland repeated, his voice strong and reassuring. \"I'mright behind you.\"Rachel felt his hands on her hips now, urging her forward. Blocking out the voidbeneath her, Rachel started down the catwalk. Somewhere above she could hear therotors of the chopper again. Corky was already well out in front of them,reeling across the catwalk in a kind of drunken panic.Tolland called out to him. \"All the way to the far strut, Corky! Down thestairs!\"Rachel could now see where they were headed. Up ahead, a series of switchbackramps descended. At water level, a narrow, shelflike deck extended the length ofthe Goya. Jutting off this deck were several small, suspended docks, creating akind of miniature marina stationed beneath the ship. A large sign read:DIVE AREASwimmers May Surface without Warning– Boats Proceed with Caution –Rachel could only assume Michael did not intend for them to do any swimming. Hertrepidation intensified when Tolland stopped at a bank of wire-mesh storagelockers flanking the catwalk. He pulled open the doors to reveal hangingwetsuits, snorkels, flippers, life jackets, and spearguns. Before she couldprotest, he reached in and grabbed a flare gun. \"Let's go.\"They were moving again.Up ahead, Corky had reached the switchback ramps and was already halfway down.\"I see it!\" he shouted, his voice sounding almost joyous over the raging water.See what? Rachel wondered as Corky ran along the narrow walkway. All she couldsee was a shark-infested ocean lapping dangerously close. Tolland urged herforward, and suddenly Rachel could see what Corky was so excited about. At thefar end of the decking below, a small powerboat was moored. Corky ran toward it.Rachel stared. Outrun a helicopter in a motorboat?\"It has a radio,\" Tolland said. \"And if we can get far enough away from thehelicopter's jamming...\"Rachel did not hear another word he said. She had just spied something that madeher blood run cold. \"Too late,\" she croaked, extending a trembling finger. We'refinished...When Tolland turned, he knew in an instant it was over.At the far end of the ship, like a dragon peering into the opening of a cave,the black helicopter had dropped down low and was facing them. For an instant,Tolland thought it was going to fly directly at them through the center of theboat. But the helicopter began to turn at an angle, taking aim.Tolland followed the direction of the gun barrels. No!Crouched beside the powerboat untying the moorings, Corky glanced up just as themachine guns beneath the chopper erupted in a blaze of thunder. Corky lurched asif hit. Wildly, he scrambled over the gunwale and dove into the boat, sprawledhimself on the floor for cover. The guns stopped. Tolland could see Corkycrawling deeper into the powerboat. The lower part of his right leg was coveredwith blood. Crouched below the dash, Corky reached up and fumbled across thecontrols until his fingers found the key. The boat's 250 hp Mercury engineroared to life.An instant later, a red laser beam appeared, emanating from the nose of thehovering chopper, targeting the powerboat with a missile.Tolland reacted on instinct, aiming the only weapon he had.The flare gun in his hand hissed when he pulled the trigger, and a blindingstreak tore away on a horizontal trajectory beneath the ship, heading directlytoward the chopper. Even so, Tolland sensed he had acted too late. As thestreaking flare bore down on the helicopter's windshield, the rocket launcherbeneath the chopper emitted its own flash of light. At the same exact instantthat the missile launched, the aircraft veered sharply and pulled up out ofsight to avoid the incoming flare.\"Look out!\" Tolland yelled, yanking Rachel down onto the catwalk.The missile sailed off course, just missing Corky, coming the length of the Goyaand slamming into the base of the strut thirty feet beneath Rachel and Tolland.The sound was apocalyptic. Water and flames erupted beneath them. Bits oftwisted metal flew in the air and scattered the catwalk beneath them. Metal onmetal ground together as the ship shifted, finding a new balance, slightlyaskew.As the smoke cleared, Tolland could see that one of the Goya's four main strutshad been severely damaged. Powerful currents tore past the pontoon, threateningto break it off. The spiral stairway descending to the lower deck looked to behanging by a thread.\"Come on!\" Tolland yelled, urging Rachel toward it. We've got to get down!But they were too late. With a surrendering crack, the stairs peeled away fromthe damaged strut and crashed into the sea.Over the ship, Delta-One grappled with the controls of the Kiowa helicopter andgot it back under control. Momentarily blinded by the incoming flare, he hadreflexively pulled up, causing the Hellfire missile to miss its mark. Cursing,he hovered now over the bow of the ship and prepared to drop back down andfinish the job.Eliminate all passengers. The controller's demands had been clear.\"Shit! Look!\" Delta-Two yelled from the rear seat, pointing out the window.\"Speedboat!\"Delta-One spun and saw a bullet-riddled Crestliner speedboat skimming away fromthe Goya into the darkness.He had a decision to make.114Corky's bloody hands gripped the wheel of the Crestliner Phantom 2100 as itpounded out across the sea. He rammed the throttle all the way forward, tryingto eke out maximum speed. It was not until this moment that he felt the searingpain. He looked down and saw his right leg spurting blood. He instantly feltdizzy.Propping himself against the wheel, he turned and looked back at the Goya,willing the helicopter to follow him. With Tolland and Rachel trapped up on thecatwalk, Corky had not been able to reach them. He'd been forced to make a snapdecision.Divide and conquer.Corky knew if he could lure the chopper far enough away from the Goya, maybeTolland and Rachel could radio for help. Unfortunately, as he looked over hisshoulder at the illuminated ship, Corky could see the chopper still hoveringthere, as if undecided.Come on, you bastards! Follow me!But the helicopter did not follow. Instead it banked over the stern of the Goya,aligned itself, and dropped down, landing on the deck. No! Corky watched inhorror, now realizing he'd left Tolland and Rachel behind to be killed.Knowing it was now up to him to radio for help, Corky groped the dashboard andfound the radio. He flicked the power switch. Nothing happened. No lights. Nostatic. He turned the volume knob all the way up. Nothing. Come on! Letting goof the wheel, he knelt down for a look. His leg screamed in pain as he bentdown. His eyes focused on the radio. He could not believe what he was lookingat. The dashboard had been strafed by bullets, and the radio dial was shattered.Loose wires hung out the front. He stared, incredulous.Of all the goddamned luck...Weak-kneed, Corky stood back up, wondering how things could get any worse. As helooked back at the Goya, he got his answer. Two armed soldiers jumped out of thechopper onto the deck. Then the chopper lifted off again, turning in Corky'sdirection and coming after him at full speed.Corky slumped. Divide and conquer. Apparently he was not the only one with thatbright idea tonight.As Delta-Three made his way across the deck and approached the grated rampleading belowdecks, he heard a woman shouting somewhere beneath him. He turnedand motioned to Delta-Two that he was going belowdecks to check it out. Hispartner nodded, remaining behind to cover the upper level. The two men couldstay in contact via CrypTalk; the Kiowa's jamming system ingeniously left anobscure bandwidth open for their own communications.Clutching his snub-nose machine gun, Delta-Three moved quietly toward the rampthat led belowdecks. With the vigilance of a trained killer, he began inchingdownward, gun leveled.The incline provided limited visibility, and Delta-Three crouched low for abetter view. He could hear the shouting more clearly now. He kept descending.Halfway down the stairs he could now make out the twisted maze of walkwaysattached to the underside of the Goya. The shouting grew louder.Then he saw her. Midway across the traversing catwalk, Rachel Sexton was peeringover a railing and calling desperately toward the water for Michael Tolland.Did Tolland fall in? Perhaps in the blast?If so, Delta-Three's job would be even easier than expected. He only needed todescend another couple of feet to have an open shot. Shooting fish in a barrel.His only vague concern was Rachel standing near an open equipment locker, whichmeant she might have a weapon – a speargun or a shark rifle – although neitherwould be any match for his machine gun. Confident he was in control of thesituation, Delta-Three leveled his weapon and took another step down. RachelSexton was almost in perfect view now. He raised the gun.One more step.The flurry of movement came from beneath him, under the stairs. Delta-Three wasmore confused than frightened as he looked down and saw Michael Tollandthrusting an aluminum pole out toward his feet. Although Delta-Three had beentricked, he almost laughed at this lame attempt to trip him up.Then he felt the tip of the stick connect with his heel.A blast of white-hot pain shot through his body as his right foot exploded outfrom under him from a blistering impact. His balance gone, Delta-Three flailed,tumbling down the stairs. His machine gun clattered down the ramp and wentoverboard as he collapsed on the catwalk. In anguish, he curled up to grip hisright foot, but it was no longer there.Tolland was standing over his attacker immediately with his hands stillclenching the smoking bang-stick – a five-foot Powerhead Shark-Control Device.The aluminum pole had been tipped with a pressure-sensitive, twelve-gaugeshotgun shell and was intended for self-defense in the event of shark attack.Tolland had reloaded the bang-stick with another shell, and now held the jagged,smoldering point to his attacker's Adam's apple. The man lay on his back as ifparalyzed, staring up at Tolland with an expression of astonished rage andagony.Rachel came running up the catwalk. The plan was for her to take the man'smachine gun, but unfortunately the weapon had gone over the edge of the catwalkinto the ocean.The communications device on the man's belt crackled. The voice coming out wasrobotic. \"Delta-Three? Come in. I heard a shot.\"The man made no move to answer.The device crackled again. \"Delta-Three? Confirm. Do you need backup?\"Almost immediately, a new voice crackled over the line. It was also robotic butdistinguishable by the sound of a helicopter noise in the background. \"This isDelta-One,\" the pilot said. \"I'm in pursuit of the departing vessel.Delta-Three, confirm. Are you down? Do you need backup?\"Tolland pressed the bang-stick into the man's throat. \"Tell the helicopter toback off that speedboat. If they kill my friend, you die.\"The soldier winced in pain as he lifted his communication device to his lips. Helooked directly at Tolland as he pressed the button and spoke. \"Delta-Three,here. I'm fine. Destroy the departing vessel.\"115Gabrielle Ashe returned to Sexton's private bathroom, preparing to climb backout of his office. Sexton'sphone call had left her feeling anxious. He haddefinitely hesitated when she told him she was in her office – as if he knewsomehow she was lying. Either way, she'd failed to get into Sexton's computerand now was unsure of her next move.Sexton is waiting.As she climbed up onto the sink, getting ready to pull herself up, she heardsomething clatter to the tile floor. She looked down, irritated to see thatshe'd knocked off a pair of Sexton's cuff links that had apparently been sittingon the edge of the sink.Leave things exactly as you found them.Climbing back down Gabrielle picked up the cuff links and put them back on thesink. As she began to climb back up, she paused, glancing again at the cufflinks. On any other night, Gabrielle would have ignored them, but tonight theirmonogram caught her attention. Like most of Sexton's monogrammed items, they hadtwo intertwining letters. SS. Gabrielle flashed on Sexton's initial computerpassword – SSS. She pictured his calendar... POTUS... and the White Housescreensaver with its optimistic ticker tape crawling around the screen adinfinitum.President of the United States Sedgewick Sexton... President of the UnitedStates Sedgewick Sexton... President of the...Gabrielle stood a moment and wondered. Could he be that confident?Knowing it would take only an instant to find out, she hurried back intoSexton's office, went to his computer, and typed in a seven-letter password.POTUSSSThe screensaver evaporated instantly.She stared, incredulous.Never underestimate the ego of a politician.116Corky Marlinson was no longer at the helm of the Crestliner Phantom as it racedinto the night. He knew the boat would travel in a straight line with or withouthim at the wheel. The path of least resistance...Corky was in the back of the bouncing boat, trying to assess the damage to hisleg. A bullet had entered the front part of his calf, just missing his shinbone.There was no exit wound on the back of his calf, so he knew the bullet muststill be lodged in his leg. Foraging around for something to stem the bleeding,he found nothing – some fins, a snorkel, and a couple of life jackets. Nofirst-aid kit. Frantically, Corky opened a small utility chest and found sometools, rags, duct tape, oil, and other maintenance items. He looked at hisbloody leg and wondered how far he had to go to be out of shark territory.A hell of a lot farther than this.Delta-One kept the Kiowa chopper low over the ocean as he scanned the darknessfor the departing Crestliner. Assuming the fleeing boat would head for shore andattempt to put as much distance as possible between itself and the Goya,Delta-One had followed the Crestliner's original trajectory away from the Goya.I should have overtaken him by now.Normally, tracking the fleeing boat would be a simple matter of using radar, butwith the Kiowa's jamming systems transmitting an umbrella of thermal noise forseveral miles, his radar was worthless. Turning off the jamming system was notan option until he got word that everyone onboard the Goya was dead. Noemergency phone calls would be leaving the Goya this evening.This meteorite secret dies. Right here. Right now.Fortunately, Delta-One had other means of tracking. Even against this bizarrebackdrop of heated ocean, pinpointing a powerboat's thermal imprint was simple.He turned on his thermal scanner. The ocean around him registered a warmninety-five degrees. Fortunately, the emissions of a racing 250 hp outboardengine were hundreds of degrees hotter.Corky Marlinson's leg and foot felt numb.Not knowing what else to do, he had wiped down his injured calf with the rag andwrapped the wound in layer after layer of duct tape. By the time the tape wasgone, his entire calf, from ankle to knee, was enveloped in a tight silversheath. The bleeding had stopped, although his clothing and hands were stillcovered with blood.Sitting on the floor of the runaway Crestliner, Corky felt confused about whythe chopper hadn't found him yet. He looked out now, scanning the horizon behindhim, expecting to see the distant Goya and incoming helicopter. Oddly, he sawneither. The lights of the Goya had disappeared. Certainly he hadn't come thatfar, had he?Corky suddenly felt hopeful he might escape. Maybe they had lost him in thedark. Maybe he could get to shore!It was then he noticed that the wake behind his boat was not straight. It seemedto curve gradually away from the back of his boat, as if he were traveling in anarc rather than a straight line. Confused by this, he turned his head to followthe wake's arc, extrapolating a giant curve across the ocean. An instant later,he saw it.The Goya was directly off his port side, less than a half mile away. In horror,Corky realized his mistake too late. With no one at the wheel, the Crestliner'sbow had continuously realigned itself with the direction of the powerful current– the megaplume's circular water flow. I'm driving in a big friggin' circle!He had doubled back on himself.Knowing he was still inside the shark-filled megaplume, Corky recalled Tolland'sgrim words. Enhanced telencephalon olfactory lobes... hammerheads can smell adroplet of blood a mile away. Corky looked at his bloody duct-taped leg andhands.The chopper would be on him soon.Ripping off his bloody clothing, Corky scrambled naked toward the stern. Knowingno sharks could possibly keep pace with the boat, he rinsed himself as best ashe could in the powerful blast of the wake.A single droplet of blood...As Corky stood up, fully exposed to the night, he knew there was only one thingleft to do. He had learned once that animals marked their territory with urinebecause uric acid was the most potent-smelling fluid the human body made.More potent than blood, he hoped. Wishing he'd had a few more beers tonight,Corky heaved his injured leg up onto the gunwale and tried to urinate on theduct tape. Come on! He waited. Nothing like the pressure of having to piss allover yourself with a helicopter chasing you.Finally it came. Corky urinated all over the duct tape, soaking it fully. Heused what little was left in his bladder to soak a rag, which he then swathedacross his entire body. Very pleasant.In the dark sky overhead, a red laser beam appeared, slanting toward him likethe shimmering blade of an enormous guillotine. The chopper appeared from anoblique angle, the pilot apparently confused that Corky had looped back towardthe Goya.Quickly donning a high-float life vest, Corky moved to the rear of the speedingcraft. On the boat's bloodstained floor, only five feet from where Corky wasstanding, a glowing red dot appeared.It was time.Onboard the Goya, Michael Tolland did not see his Crestliner Phantom 2100 eruptin flames and tumble through the air in a cartwheel of fire and smoke.But he heard the explosion.117The West Wing was usually quiet at this hour, but the President's unexpectedemergence in his bathrobe and slippers had rustled the aides and on-site staffout of their \"day-timer beds\" and on-site sleeping quarters.\"I can't find her, Mr. President,\" a young aide said, hurrying after him intothe Oval Office. He had looked everywhere. \"Ms. Tench is not answering her pageror cellphone.\"The President looked exasperated. \"Have you looked in the –\"\"She left the building, sir,\" another aide announced, hurrying in. \"She signedout about an hour ago. We think she may have gone to the NRO. One of theoperators says she and Pickering were talking tonight.\"\"William Pickering?\" The President sounded baffled. Tench and Pickering wereanything but social. \"Have you called him?\"\"He's not answering either, sir. NRO switchboard can't reach him. They sayPickering's cellphone isn't even ringing. It's like he's dropped off the face ofthe earth.\"Herney stared at his aides for a moment and then walked to the bar and pouredhimself a bourbon. As he raised the glass to his lips, a Secret Servicemanhurried in.\"Mr. President? I wasn't going to wake you, but you should be aware that therewas a car bombing at the FDR Memorial tonight.\"\"What!\" Herney almost dropped his drink. \"When?\"\"An hour ago.\" His face was grim. \"And the FBI just identified the victim...\"118Delta-Three's foot screamed in pain. He felt himself floating through a muddledconsciousness. Is this death? He tried to move but felt paralyzed, barely ableto breathe. He saw only blurred shapes. His mind reeled back, recalling theexplosion of the Crestliner out at sea, seeing the rage in Michael Tolland'seyes as the oceanographer stood over him, holding the explosive pole to histhroat.Certainly Tolland killed me...And yet the searing pain in Delta-Three's right foot told him he was very muchalive. Slowly it came back. On hearing the explosion of the Crestliner, Tollandhad let out a cry of anguished rage for his lost friend. Then, turning hisravaged eyes to Delta-Three, Tolland had arched as if preparing to ram the rodthrough Delta-Three's throat. But as he did, he seemed to hesitate, as if hisown morality were holding him back. With brutal frustration and fury, Tollandyanked the rod away and drove his boot down on Delta-Three's tattered foot.The last thing Delta-Three remembered was vomiting in agony as his whole worlddrifted into a black delirium. Now he was coming to, with no idea how long hehad been unconscious. He could feel his arms tied behind his back in a knot sotight it could only have been tied by a sailor. His legs were also bound, bentbehind him and tied to his wrists, leaving him in an immobilized backward arch.He tried to call out, but no sound came. His mouth was stuffed with something.Delta-Three could not imagine what was going on. It was then he felt the coolbreeze and saw the bright lights. He realized he was up on the Goya's main deck.He twisted to look for help and was met by a frightful sight, his own reflection– bulbous and misshapen in the reflective Plexiglas bubble of the Goya'sdeepwater submersible. The sub hung right in front of him, and Delta-Threerealized he was lying on a giant trapdoor in the deck. This was not nearly asunsettling as the most obvious question.If I'm on deck... then where is Delta-Two?Delta-Two had grown uneasy.Despite his partner's CrypTalk transmission claiming he was fine, the singlegunshot had not been that of a machine gun. Obviously, Tolland or Rachel Sextonhad fired a weapon. Delta-Two moved over to peer down the ramp where his partnerhad descended, and he saw blood.Weapon raised, he had descended belowdecks, where he followed the trail of bloodalong a catwalk to the bow of the ship. Here, the trail of blood had led himback up another ramp to the main deck. It was deserted. With growing wariness,Delta-Two had followed the long crimson smear along the sideboard deck backtoward the rear of the ship, where it passed the opening to the original ramp hehad descended.What the hell is going on? The smear seemed to travel in a giant circle.Moving cautiously, his gun trained ahead of him, Delta-Two passed the entranceto the laboratory section of the ship. The smear continued toward the sterndeck. Carefully he swung wide, rounding the corner. His eye traced the trail.Then he saw it.Jesus Christ!Delta-Three was lying there – bound and gagged – dumped unceremoniously directlyin front of the Goya's small submersible. Even from a distance, Delta-Two couldsee that his partner was missing a good portion of his right foot.Wary of a trap, Delta-Two raised his gun and moved forward. Delta-Three waswrithing now, trying to speak. Ironically, the way the man had been bound – withhis knees sharply bent behind him – was probably saving his life; the bleedingin his foot appeared to have slowed.As Delta-Two approached the submersible, he appreciated the rare luxury of beingable to watch his own back; the entire deck of the ship was reflected in thesub's rounded cockpit dome. Delta-Two arrived at his struggling partner. He sawthe warning in his eyes too late.The flash of silver came out of nowhere.One of the Triton's manipulator claws suddenly leaped forward and clamped downon Delta-Two's left thigh with crushing force. He tried to pull away, but theclaw bore down. He screamed in pain, feeling a bone break. His eyes shot to thesub's cockpit. Peering through the reflection of the deck, Delta-Two could nowsee him, ensconced in the shadows of the Triton's interior.Michael Tolland was inside the sub, at the controls.Bad idea, Delta-Two seethed, blocking out his pain and shouldering his machinegun. He aimed up and to the left at Tolland's chest, only three feet away on theother side of the sub's Plexiglas dome. He pulled the trigger, and the gunroared. Wild with rage at having been tricked, Delta-Two held the trigger backuntil the last of his shells clattered to the deck and his gun clicked empty.Breathless, he dropped the weapon and glared at the shredded dome in front ofhim.\"Dead!\" the soldier hissed, straining to pull his leg from the clamp. As hetwisted, the metal clamp severed his skin, opening a large gash. \"Fuck!\" Hereached now for the CrypTalk on his belt. But as he raised it to his lips, asecond robotic arm snapped open in front of him and lunged forward, clampingaround his right arm. The CrypTalk fell to the deck.It was then that Delta-Two saw the ghost in the window before him. A pale visageleaning sideways and peering out through an unscathed edge of glass. Stunned,Delta-Two looked at the center of the dome and realized the bullets had not evencome close to penetrating the thick shell. The dome was cratered with pockmarks.An instant later, the topside portal on the sub opened, and Michael Tollandemerged. He looked shaky but unscathed. Climbing down the aluminum gangway,Tolland stepped onto the deck and eyed his sub's destroyed dome window.\"Ten thousand pounds per square inch,\" Tolland said. \"Looks like you need abigger gun.\"Inside the hydrolab, Rachel knew time was running out. She had heard thegunshots out on the deck and was praying that everything had happened exactly asTolland had planned. She no longer cared who was behind the meteorite deception– the NASA administrator, Marjorie Tench, or the President himself – none of itmattered anymore.They will not get away with this. Whoever it is, the truth will be told.The wound on Rachel's arm had stopped bleeding, and the adrenaline coursingthrough her body had muted the pain and sharpened her focus. Finding a pen andpaper, she scrawled a two-line message. The words were blunt and awkward, buteloquence was not a luxury she had time for at the moment. She added the note tothe incriminating stack of papers in her hand – the GPR printout, images ofBathynomous giganteus, photos and articles regarding oceanic chondrules, anelectron microscan printout. The meteorite was a fake, and this was the proof.Rachel inserted the entire stack into the hydrolab's fax machine. Knowing only afew fax numbers by heart, she had limited choices, but she had already made upher mind who would be receiving these pages and her note. Holding her breath,she carefully typed in the person's fax number.She pressed \"send,\" praying she had chosen the recipient wisely.The fax machine beeped.ERROR: NO DIAL TONERachel had expected this. The Goya's communications were still being jammed. Shestood waiting and watching the machine, hoping it functioned like hers at home.Come on!After five seconds, the machine beeped again.REDIALING...Yes! Rachel watched the machine lock into an endless loop.ERROR: NO DIAL TONEREDIALING...ERROR: NO DIAL TONEREDIALING...Leaving the fax machine in search of a dial tone, Rachel dashed out of thehydrolab just as helicopter blades thundered overhead.119One hundred and sixty miles away from the Goya, Gabrielle Ashe was staring atSenator Sexton's computer screen in mute astonishment. Her suspicions had beenright.But she had never imagined how right.She was looking at digital scans of dozens of bank checks written to Sexton fromprivate space companies and deposited in numbered accounts in the CaymanIslands. The smallest check Gabrielle saw was for fifteen thousand dollars.Several were upward of half a million dollars.Small potatoes, Sexton had told her. All the donations are under thetwo-thousand-dollar cap.Obviously Sexton had been lying all along. Gabrielle was looking at illegalcampaign financing on an enormous scale. The pangs of betrayal anddisillusionment settled hard now in her heart. He lied.She felt stupid. She felt dirty. But most of all she felt mad.Gabrielle sat alone in the darkness, realizing she had no idea what to do next.120Above the Goya, as the Kiowa banked over the stern deck, Delta-One gazed down,his eyes fixating on an utterly unexpected vision.Michael Tolland was standing on deck beside a small submersible. Dangling in thesub's robotic arms, as if in the clutches of a giant insect, hung Delta-Two,struggling in vain to free himself from two enormous claws.What in the name of God!?Equally as shocking an image, Rachel Sexton had just arrived on deck, taking upa position over a bound and bleeding man at the foot of the submersible. The mancould only be Delta-Three. Rachel held one of the Delta Force's machine guns onhim and stared up at the chopper as if daring them to attack.Delta-One felt momentarily disoriented, unable to fathom how this possibly couldhave happened. The Delta Force's errors on the ice shelf earlier had been a rarebut explainable occurrence. This, however, was unimaginable.Delta-One's humiliation would have been excruciating enough under normalcircumstances. But tonight his shame was magnified by the presence of anotherindividual riding with him inside the chopper, a person whose presence here washighly unconventional.The controller.Following the Delta's kill at the FDR Memorial, the controller had orderedDelta-One to fly to a deserted public park not far from the White House. On thecontroller's command, Delta-One had set down on a grassy knoll among some treesjust as the controller, having parked nearby, strode out of the darkness andboarded the Kiowa. They were all en route again in a matter of seconds.Although a controller's direct involvement in mission operations was rare,Delta-One could hardly complain. The controller, distressed by the way the DeltaForce had handled the kills on the Milne Ice Shelf and fearing increasingsuspicions and scrutiny from a number of parties, had informed Delta-One thatthe final phase of the operation would be overseen in person.Now the controller was riding shotgun, witnessing in person a failure the likesof which Delta-One had never endured.This must end. Now.The controller gazed down from the Kiowa at the deck of the Goya and wonderedhow this could possibly have happened. Nothing had gone properly – thesuspicions about the meteorite, the failed Delta kills on the ice shelf, thenecessity of the high-profile kill at the FDR.\"Controller,\" Delta-One stammered, his tone one of stunned disgrace as he lookedat the situation on the deck of the Goya. \"I cannot imagine...\"Nor can I, the controller thought. Their quarry had obviously been grosslyunderestimated.The controller looked down at Rachel Sexton, who stared up blankly at thechopper's reflective windshield and raised a CrypTalk device to her mouth. Whenher synthesized voice crackled inside the Kiowa, the controller expected her todemand that the chopper back off or extinguish the jamming system so Tollandcould call for help. But the words Rachel Sexton spoke were far more chilling.\"You're too late,\" she said. \"We're not the only ones who know.\"The words echoed for a moment inside the chopper. Although the claim seemedfar-fetched, the faintest possibility of truth gave the controller pause. Thesuccess of the entire project required the elimination of all those who knew thetruth, and as bloody as the containment had turned out to be, the controller hadto be certain this was the conclusion.Someone else knows...Considering Rachel Sexton's reputation for following strict protocol ofclassified data, the controller found it very hard to believe that she wouldhave decided to share this with an outside source.Rachel was on the CrypTalk again. \"Back off and we'll spare your men. Come anycloser and they die. Either way, the truth comes out. Cut your losses. Backoff.\"\"You're bluffing,\" the controller said, knowing the voice Rachel Sexton washearing was an androgynous robotic tone. \"You have told no one.\"\"Are you ready to take that chance?\" Rachel fired back. \"I couldn't get throughto William Pickering earlier, so I got spooked and took out some insurance.\"The controller frowned. It was plausible.\"They're not buying it,\" Rachel said, glancing at Tolland.The soldier in the claws gave a pained smirk. \"Your gun is empty, and thechopper's going to blow you to hell. You're both going to die. Your only hope isto let us go.\"Like hell, Rachel thought, trying to assess their next move. She looked at thebound and gagged man who lay at her feet directly in front of the sub. He lookeddelirious from loss of blood. She crouched beside him, looking into the man'shard eyes. \"I'm going to take off your gag and hold the CrypTalk; you're goingto convince the helicopter to back off. Is that clear?\"The man nodded earnestly.Rachel pulled out the man's gag. The soldier spat a wad of bloody saliva up intoRachel's face.\"Bitch,\" he hissed, coughing. \"I'm going to watch you die. They're going to killyou like a pig, and I'm going to enjoy every minute.\"Rachel wiped the hot saliva from her face as she felt Tolland's hands liftingher away, pulling her back, steadying her as he took her machine gun. She couldfeel in his trembling touch that something inside him had just snapped. Tollandwalked to a control panel a few yards away, put his hand on a lever, and lockedeyes with the man lying on the deck.\"Strike two,\" Tolland said. \"And on my ship, that's all you get.\"With a resolute rage, Tolland yanked down on the lever. A huge trapdoor in thedeck beneath the Triton fell open like the floor of a gallows. The bound soldiergave a short howl of fear and then disappeared, plummeting through the hole. Hefell thirty feet to the ocean below. The splash was crimson. The sharks were onhim instantly.The controller shook with rage, looking down from the Kiowa at what was left ofDelta-Three's body drifting out from under the boat on the strong current. Theilluminated water was pink. Several fish fought over something that looked likean arm.Jesus Christ.The controller looked back at the deck. Delta-Two still hung in the Triton'sclaws, but now the sub was suspended over a gaping hole in the deck. His feetdangled over the void. All Tolland had to do was release the claws, andDelta-Two would be next.\"Okay,\" the controller barked into the CrypTalk. \"Hold on. Just hold on!\"Rachel stood below on the deck and stared up at the Kiowa. Even from this heightthe controller sensed the resolve in her eyes. Rachel raised the CrypTalk to hermouth. \"You still think we're bluffing?\" she said. \"Call the main switchboard atthe NRO. Ask for Jim Samiljan. He's in P&A on the nightshift. I told himeverything about the meteorite. He will confirm.\"She's giving me a specific name? This did not bode well. Rachel Sexton was nofool, and this was a bluff the controller could check in a matter of seconds.Although the controller knew of no one at the NRO named Jim Samiljan, theorganization was enormous. Rachel could quite possibly be telling the truth.Before ordering the final kill, the controller had to confirm if this was abluff – or not.Delta-One looked over his shoulder. \"You want me to deactivate the jammer so youcan call and check it out?\"The controller peered down at Rachel and Tolland, both in plain view. If eitherof them made a move for a cellphone or radio, the controller knew Delta-Onecould always reactivate and cut them off. The risk was minimal.\"Kill the jammer,\" the controller said, pulling out a cellphone. \"I'll confirmRachel's lying. Then we'll find a way to get Delta-Two and end this.\"In Fairfax, the operator at the NRO's central switchboard was getting impatient.\"As I just told you, I see no Jim Samiljan in the Plans and Analysis Division.\"The caller was insistent. \"Have you tried multiple spellings? Have you triedother departments?\"The operator had already checked, but she checked again. After several seconds,she said, \"Nowhere on staff do we have a Jim Samiljan. Under any spelling.\"The caller sounded oddly pleased by this. \"So you are certain the NRO employs noJim Samil –\"A sudden flurry of activity erupted on the line. Someone yelled. The callercursed aloud and promptly hung up.Onboard the Kiowa, Delta-One was screaming with rage as he scrambled toreactivate the jamming system. He had made the realization too late. In the hugearray of lighted controls in the cockpit, a tiny LED meter indicated that aSATCOM data signal was being transmitted from the Goya. But how? Nobody left thedeck! Before Delta-One could engage the jammer, the connection from the Goyaterminated on its own accord.Inside the hydrolab, the fax machine beeped contentedly.CARRIER FOUND... FAX SENT121Kill or be killed. Rachel had discovered a part of herself she never knewexisted. Survival mode – a savage fortitude fueled by fear.\"What was in that outbound fax?\" the voice on the CrypTalk demanded.Rachel was relieved to hear confirmation that the fax had gone out as planned.\"Leave the area,\" she demanded, speaking into the CrypTalk and glaring up at thehovering chopper. \"It's over. Your secret is out.\" Rachel informed theirattackers of all the information she had just sent. A half dozen pages of imagesand text. Incontrovertible evidence that the meteorite was a fake. \"Harming uswill only make your situation worse.\"There was a heavy pause. \"Who did you send the fax to?\"Rachel had no intention of answering that question. She and Tolland needed tobuy as much time as possible. They had positioned themselves near the opening inthe deck, on a direct line with the Triton, making it impossible for the chopperto shoot without hitting the soldier dangling in the sub's claws.\"William Pickering,\" the voice guessed, sounding oddly hopeful. \"You faxedPickering.\"Wrong, Rachel thought. Pickering would have been her first choice, but she hadbeen forced to choose someone else for fear her attackers had already eliminatedPickering – a move whose boldness would be a chilling testimony to her enemy'sresolve. In a moment of desperate decision, Rachel had faxed the data to theonly other fax number she knew by heart.Her father's office.Senator Sexton's office fax number had been painfully engraved into Rachel'smemory after her mother's death when her father chose to work out many of theparticulars of the estate without having to deal with Rachel in person. Rachelnever imagined she would turn to her father in a time of need, but tonight theman possessed two critical qualities – all the correct political motivations torelease the meteorite data without hesitation, and enough clout to call theWhite House and blackmail them into calling off this kill squad.Although her father was most certainly not in the office at this hour, Rachelknew he kept his office locked like a vault. Rachel had, in effect, faxed thedata into a time-lock safe. Even if the attackers knew where she had sent it,chances were slim they could get through the tight federal security at thePhilip A. Hart Senate Office Building and break into a senator's office withoutanyone noticing.\"Wherever you sent the fax,\" the voice from above said. \"You've put that personin danger.\"Rachel knew she had to speak from a position of power regardless of the fear shewas feeling. She motioned to the soldier trapped in the Triton's claws. His legsdangled over the abyss, dripping blood thirty feet to the ocean. \"The onlyperson in danger here is your agent,\" she said into the CrypTalk. \"It's over.Back off. The data is gone. You've lost. Leave the area, or this man dies.\"The voice on the CrypTalk fired back, \"Ms. Sexton, you do not understand theimportance –\"\"Understand?\" Rachel exploded. \"I understand that you killed innocent people! Iunderstand that you lied about the meteorite! And I understand that you won'tget away with this! Even if you kill us all, it's over!\"There was a long pause. Finally the voice said, \"I'm coming down.\"Rachel felt her muscles tighten. Coming down?\"I am unarmed,\" the voice said. \"Do not do anything rash. You and I need to talkface-to-face.\"Before Rachel could react, the chopper dropped onto the Goya's deck. Thepassenger door on the fuselage opened and a figure stepped out. He was aplain-looking man in a black coat and tie. For an instant, Rachel's thoughtswent totally blank.She was staring at William Pickering.William Pickering stood on the deck of the Goya and gazed with regret at RachelSexton. He had never imagined today would come to this. As he moved toward her,he could see the dangerous combination of emotions in his employee's eyes.Shock, betrayal, confusion, rage.All understandable, he thought. There is so much she does not understand.For a moment, Pickering flashed on his daughter, Diana, wondering what emotionsshe had felt before she died. Both Diana and Rachel were casualties of the samewar, a war Pickering had vowed to fight forever. Sometimes the casualties couldbe so cruel.\"Rachel,\" Pickering said. \"We can still work this out. There's a lot I need toexplain.\"Rachel Sexton looked aghast, nauseated almost. Tolland had the machine gun nowand was aiming at Pickering's chest. He too looked bewildered.\"Stay back!\" Tolland yelled.Pickering stopped five yards away, focusing on Rachel. \"Your father is takingbribes, Rachel. Payoffs from private space companies. He plans to dismantle NASAand open space to the private sector. He had to be stopped, as a matter ofnational security.\"Rachel's expression was blank.Pickering sighed. \"NASA, for all its flaws, must remain a government entity.\"Certainly she can understand the dangers. Privatization would send NASA's bestminds and ideas flooding into the private sector. The brain trust woulddissolve. The military would lose access. Private space companies looking toraise capital would start selling NASA patents and ideas to the highest biddersworldwide!Rachel's voice was tremulous. \"You faked the meteorite and killed innocentpeople... in the name of national security?\"\"It was never supposed to happen like this,\" Pickering said. \"The plan was tosave an important government agency. Killing was not part of it.\"The meteorite deception, Pickering knew, like most intelligence proposals, hadbeen the product of fear. Three years ago, in an effort to extend the NROhydrophones into deeper water where they could not be touched by enemysaboteurs, Pickering spearheaded a program that utilized a newly developed NASAbuilding material to secretly design an astonishingly durable submarine capableof carrying humans to the deepest regions of the ocean – including the bottom ofthe Mariana Trench.Forged from a revolutionary ceramic, this two-man submarine was designed fromblueprints hacked from the computer of a California engineer named GrahamHawkes, a genius sub designer whose life dream was to build an ultra-deepwatersubmersible he called Deep Flight II. Hawkes was having trouble finding fundingto build a prototype. Pickering, on the other hand, had an unlimited budget.Using the classified ceramic submersible, Pickering sent a covert teamunderwater to affix new hydrophones to the walls of the Mariana Trench, deeperthan any enemy could possibly look. In the process of drilling, however, theyuncovered geologic structures unlike any that scientists had ever seen. Thediscoveries included chondrules and fossils of several unknown species. Ofcourse, because the NRO's ability to dive this deep was classified, none of theinformation could ever be shared.It was not until recently, driven yet again by fear, that Pickering and hisquiet team of NRO science advisers had decided to put their knowledge of theMariana's unique geology to work to help save NASA. Turning a Mariana rock intoa meteorite had proven to be a deceptively simple task. Using an ECEslush-hydrogen engine, the NRO team charred the rock with a convincing fusioncrust. Then, using a small payload sub, they had descended beneath the Milne IceShelf and inserted the charred rock up into the ice from beneath. Once theinsertion shaft refroze, the rock looked like it had been there for over threehundred years.Unfortunately, as was often the case in the world of covert operations, thegrandest of plans could be undone by the smallest of snags. Yesterday, theentire illusion had been shattered by a few bioluminescent plankton...From the cockpit of the idling Kiowa, Delta-One watched the drama unfold beforehim. Rachel and Tolland appeared to be in clear control, although Delta-Onealmost had to laugh at the hollowness of the illusion. The machine gun inTolland's hands was worthless; even from here Delta-One could see the cockingbar assembly had kicked back, indicating the clip was empty.As Delta-One gazed out at his partner struggling in the Triton's claws, he knewhe had to hurry. The focus on deck had turned completely to Pickering, and nowDelta-One could make his move. Leaving the rotors idling, he slipped out of therear of the fuselage and, using the chopper for cover, made his way unseen ontothe starboard gangway. With his own machine gun in hand, he headed for the bow.Pickering had given him specific orders before they landed on deck, andDelta-One had no intention of failing at this simple task.In a matter of minutes, he knew, this will all be over.122Still wearing his bathrobe, Zach Herney sat at his desk in the Oval Office, hishead throbbing. The newest piece of the puzzle had just been revealed.Marjorie Tench is dead.Herney's aides said they had information suggesting Tench had driven to the FDRMemorial for a private meeting with William Pickering. Now that Pickering wasmissing, the staff feared Pickering too might be dead.The President and Pickering had endured their battles lately. Months ago Herneylearned that Pickering had engaged in illegal activity on Herney's behalf in anattempt to save Herney's floundering campaign.Employing NRO assets, Pickering had discreetly obtained enough dirt on SenatorSexton to sink his campaign – scandalous sexual photos of the senator with hisaide Gabrielle Ashe, incriminating financial records proving Sexton was takingbribes from private space companies. Pickering anonymously sent all the evidenceto Marjorie Tench, assuming the White House would use it wisely. But Herney,upon seeing the data, had forbidden Tench to use it. Sex scandals and briberywere cancers in Washington, and waving another one in front of the public onlyadded to their distrust of government.Cynicism is killing this country.Although Herney knew he could destroy Sexton with scandal, the cost would bebesmirching the dignity of the U.S. Senate, something Herney refused to do.No more negatives. Herney would beat Senator Sexton on the issues.Pickering, angered by the White House's refusal to use the evidence he hadprovided, tried to jump-start the scandal by leaking a rumor that Sexton hadslept with Gabrielle Ashe. Unfortunately, Sexton declared his innocence withsuch convincing indignation that the President ended up having to apologize forthe leak personally. In the end William Pickering had done more damage thangood. Herney told Pickering that if he ever interfered in the campaign again, hewould be indicted. The grand irony, of course, was that Pickering did not evenlike President Herney. The NRO director's attempts to help Herney's campaignwere simply fears over the fate of NASA. Zach Herney was the lesser of twoevils.Now has someone killed Pickering?Herney could not imagine.\"Mr. President?\" an aide said. \"As you requested, I called Lawrence Ekstrom andtold him about Marjorie Tench.\"\"Thank you.\"\"He would like to speak to you, sir.\"Herney was still furious with Ekstrom for lying about PODS. \"Tell him I'll talkto him in the morning.\"\"Mr. Ekstrom wants to talk to you right away, sir.\" The aide looked uneasy.\"He's very upset.\"HE'S upset? Herney could feel his temper fraying around the edges. As he stalkedoff to take Ekstrom's call, the President wondered what the hell else couldpossibly go wrong tonight.123Onboard the Goya, Rachel felt lightheaded. The mystification that had settledaround her like a heavy fog was lifting now. The stark reality that came intofocus left her feeling naked and disgusted. She looked at the stranger beforeher and could barely hear his voice.\"We needed to rebuild NASA's image,\" Pickering was saying. \"Their decliningpopularity and funding had become dangerous on so many levels.\" Pickeringpaused, his gray eyes locking on hers. \"Rachel, NASA was desperate for atriumph. Someone had to make it happen.\"• • •Something had to be done, Pickering thought.The meteorite had been a final act of desperation. Pickering and others hadtried to save NASA by lobbying to incorporate the space agency into theintelligence community where it would enjoy increased funding and bettersecurity, but the White House continuously rebuffed the idea as an assault onpure science. Shortsighted idealism. With the rising popularity of Sexton'santi-NASA rhetoric, Pickering and his band of military powerbrokers knew timewas running short. They decided that capturing the imagination of taxpayers andCongress was the only remaining way to salvage NASA's image and save it from theauction block. If the space agency was to survive, it would need an infusion ofgrandeur – something to remind the taxpayers of NASA's Apollo glory days. And ifZach Herney was going to defeat Senator Sexton, he was going to need help.I tried to help him, Pickering told himself, recalling all the damaging evidencehe had sent Marjorie Tench. Unfortunately, Herney had forbidden its use, leavingPickering no choice but to take drastic measures.\"Rachel,\" Pickering said, \"the information you just faxed off this ship isdangerous. You must understand that. If it gets out, the White House and NASAwill look complicit. The backlash against the President and NASA will beenormous. The President and NASA know nothing, Rachel. They are innocent. Theybelieve the meteorite is authentic.\"Pickering had not even tried to bring Herney or Ekstrom into the fold becauseboth were far too idealistic to have agreed to any deceit, regardless of itspotential to save the presidency or space agency. Administrator Ekstrom's onlycrime had been persuading the PODS mission supervisor to lie about the anomalysoftware, a move Ekstrom no doubt regretted the moment he realized howscrutinized this particular meteorite would become.Marjorie Tench, frustrated by Herney's insistence on fighting a clean campaign,conspired with Ekstrom on the PODS lie, hoping a small PODS success might helpthe President fend off the rising Sexton tide.If Tench had used the photos and bribery data I gave her, none of this wouldhave happened!Tench's murder, though deeply regrettable, had been destined as soon as Rachelcalled Tench and made accusations of fraud. Pickering knew Tench wouldinvestigate ruthlessly until she got to the bottom of Rachel's motives for theoutrageous claims, and this was one investigation Pickering obviously couldnever let happen. Ironically, Tench would serve her president best in death, herviolent end helping cement a sympathy vote for the White House as well as castvague suspicions of foul play on a desperate Sexton campaign which had been sopublicly humiliated by Marjorie Tench on CNN.Rachel stood her ground, glaring at her boss.\"Understand,\" Pickering said, \"if news of this meteorite fraud gets out, youwill destroy an innocent president and an innocent space agency. You will alsoput a very dangerous man in the Oval Office. I need to know where you faxed thedata.\"As he spoke those words, a strange look came across Rachel's face. It was thepained expression of horror of someone who had just realized they may have madea grave mistake.Having circled the bow and come back down the port side, Delta-One now stood inthe hydrolab from which he had seen Rachel emerge as the chopper had flown in. Acomputer in the lab displayed an unsettling image – a polychromatic rendering ofthe pulsating, deepwater vortex that was apparently hovering over the oceanfloor somewhere beneath the Goya.Another reason to get the hell out of here, he thought, moving now toward histarget.The fax machine was on a counter on the far side of the wall. The tray wasfilled with a stack of papers, exactly as Pickering had guessed it would be.Delta-One picked up the stack. A note from Rachel was on top. Only two lines. Heread it.To the point, he thought.As he flipped through the pages, he was both amazed and dismayed by the extentto which Tolland and Rachel had uncovered the meteorite deception. Whoever sawthese printouts would have no doubt what they meant. Fortunately, Delta-Onewould not even need to hit \"redial\" to find out where the printouts had gone.The last fax number was still displayed in the LCD window.A Washington, D.C., prefix.He carefully copied the fax number down, grabbed all the papers, and exited thelab.Tolland's hands felt sweaty on the machine gun as he gripped it, aiming themuzzle at William Pickering's chest. The NRO director was still pressuringRachel to tell him where the data had been sent, and Tolland was starting to getthe uneasy feeling that Pickering was simply trying to buy time. For what?\"The White House and NASA are innocent,\" Pickering repeated. \"Work with me.Don't let my mistakes destroy what little credibility NASA has left. NASA willlook guilty if this gets out. You and I can come to an arrangement. The countryneeds this meteorite. Tell me where you faxed the data before it's too late.\"\"So you can kill someone else?\" Rachel said. \"You make me sick.\"Tolland was amazed with Rachel's fortitude. She despised her father, but sheclearly had no intention of putting the senator in any danger whatsoever.Unfortunately, Rachel's plan to fax her father for help had backfired. Even ifthe senator came into his office, saw the fax, and called the President withnews of the meteorite fraud and told him to call off the attack, nobody at theWhite House would have any idea what Sexton was talking about, or even wherethey were.\"I will only say this one more time,\" Pickering said, fixing Rachel with amenacing glare. \"This situation is too complex for you to fully understand.You've made an enormous mistake by sending that data off this ship. You've putyour country at risk.\"William Pickering was indeed buying time, Tolland now realized. And the reasonwas striding calmly toward them up the starboard side of the boat. Tolland felta flash of fear when he saw the soldier sauntering toward them carrying a stackof papers and a machine gun.Tolland reacted with a decisiveness that shocked even himself. Gripping themachine gun, he wheeled, aimed at the soldier, and pulled the trigger.The gun made an innocuous click.\"I found the fax number,\" the soldier said, handing Pickering a slip of paper.\"And Mr. Tolland is out of ammunition.\"124Sedgewick Sexton stormed up the hallway of the PhilipA. Hart Senate OfficeBuilding. He had no idea how Gabrielle had done it, but she had obviously gotteninto his office. While they were speaking on the phone, Sexton had clearly heardthe distinctive triple-click of his Jourdain clock in the background. All hecould imagine was that Gabrielle's eavesdropping on the SFF meeting hadundermined her trust in him and she had gone digging for evidence.How the hell did she get into my office!Sexton was glad he'd changed his computer password.When he arrived at his private office, Sexton typed in his code to deactivatethe alarm. Then he fumbled for his keys, unlocked the heavy doors, threw themopen, and burst in, intent on catching Gabrielle in the act.But the office was empty and dark, lit only by the glow of his computerscreensaver. He turned on the lights, his eyes scanning. Everything looked inplace. Dead silence except for the triple-tick of his clock.Where the hell is she?He heard something rustle in his private bathroom and raced over, turning on thelight. The bathroom was empty. He looked behind the door. Nothing.Puzzled, Sexton eyed himself in the mirror, wondering if he'd had too much todrink tonight. I heard something. Feeling disoriented and confused, he walkedback into his office.\"Gabrielle?\" he called out. He went down the hall to her office. She wasn'tthere. Her office was dark.A toilet flushed in the ladies' room, and Sexton spun, striding now back in thedirection of the restrooms. He arrived just as Gabrielle was exiting, drying herhands. She jumped when she saw him.\"My God! You scared me!\" she said, looking genuinely frightened. \"What are youdoing here?\"\"You said you were getting NASA documents from your office,\" he declared, eyeingher empty hands. \"Where are they?\"\"I couldn't find them. I looked everywhere. That's what took so long.\"He stared directly into her eyes. \"Were you in my office?\"I owe my life to his fax machine, Gabrielle thought.Only minutes ago she'd been sitting at Sexton's computer, trying to makeprintouts of the images of illegal checks on his computer. The files wereprotected somehow, and she was going to need more time to figure out how toprint them. She would probably still be trying right now if Sexton's fax machinehad not rung, startling her and snapping her back to reality. Gabrielle took itas her cue to get out. Without taking time to see what the incoming fax was, shelogged off Sexton's computer, tidied up, and headed out the way she had come.She was just climbing out of Sexton's bathroom when she heard him coming in.Now, with Sexton standing before her, staring down, she sensed him searching hereyes for a lie. Sedgewick Sexton could smell untruths like nobody Gabrielle hadever met. If she lied to him, Sexton would know.\"You've been drinking,\" Gabrielle said, turning away. How does he know I was inhis office?Sexton put his hands on her shoulders and spun her back around. \"Were you in myoffice?\"Gabrielle felt a rising fear. Sexton had indeed been drinking. His touch wasrough. \"In your office?\" she demanded, forcing a confused laugh. \"How? Why?\"\"I heard my Jourdain in the background when I called you.\"Gabrielle cringed inwardly. His clock? It had not even occurred to her. \"Do youknow how ridiculous that sounds?\"\"I spend all day in that office. I know what my clock sounds like.\"Gabrielle sensed she had to end this immediately. The best defense is a goodoffense. At least that's what Yolanda Cole always said. Placing her hands on herhips, Gabrielle went for him with all she had. She stepped toward him, gettingin his face, glaring. \"Let me get this straight, senator. It's four o'clock inthe morning, you've been drinking, you heard a ticking on your phone, and that'swhy you're here?\" She pointed her finger indignantly down the hall at his door.\"Just for the record, are you accusing me of disarming a federal alarm system,picking two sets of locks, breaking into your office, being stupid enough toanswer my cellphone while in the process of committing a felony, rearming thealarm system on my way out, and then calmly using the ladies' room before I runoff with nothing to show for it? Is that the story here?\"Sexton blinked, wide-eyed.\"There's a reason people shouldn't drink alone,\" Gabrielle said. \"Now do youwant to talk about NASA, or not?\"Sexton felt befuddled as he walked back into his office. He went straight to hiswet bar and poured himself a Pepsi. He sure as hell didn't feel drunk. Could hereally have been wrong about this? Across the room, his Jourdain tickedmockingly. Sexton drained his Pepsi and poured himself another, and one forGabrielle.\"Drink, Gabrielle?\" he asked, turning back into the room. Gabrielle had notfollowed him in. She was still standing in the doorway, rubbing his nose in it.\"Oh, for God's sake! Come in. Tell me what you found out at NASA.\"\"I think I've had enough for tonight,\" she said, sounding distant. \"Let's talktomorrow.\"Sexton was in no mood for games. He needed this information now, and he had nointention of begging for it. He heaved a tired sigh. Extend the bond of trust.It's all about trust. \"I screwed up,\" he said. \"I'm sorry. It's been a hell of aday. I don't know what I was thinking.\"Gabrielle remained in the doorway.Sexton walked to his desk and set Gabrielle's Pepsi down on his blotter. Hemotioned to his leather chair – the position of power. \"Have a seat. Enjoy asoda. I'm going to go stick my head in the sink.\" He headed for the bathroom.Gabrielle still wasn't moving.\"I think I saw a fax in the machine,\" Sexton called over his shoulder as heentered the bathroom. Show her you trust her. \"Have a look at it for me, willyou?\"Sexton closed the door and filled the sink with cold water. He splashed it onhis face and felt no clearer. This had never happened to him before – being sosure, and being so wrong. Sexton was a man who trusted his instincts, and hisinstincts told him Gabrielle Ashe had been in his office.But how? It was impossible.Sexton told himself to forget about it and focus on the matter at hand. NASA. Heneeded Gabrielle right now. This was no time to alienate her. He needed to knowwhat she knew. Forget your instincts. You were wrong.As Sexton dried his face, he threw his head back and took a deep breath. Relax,he told himself. Don't get punchy. He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply again,feeling better.When Sexton exited the bathroom, he was relieved to see Gabrielle had acquiescedand come back into his office. Good, he thought. Now we can get to business.Gabrielle was standing at his fax machine flipping through whatever pages hadcome in. Sexton was confused, however, when he saw her face. It was a mask ofdisorientation and fear.\"What is it?\" Sexton said, moving toward her.Gabrielle teetered, as if she were about to pass out.\"What?\"\"The meteorite...\" she choked, her voice frail as her trembling hand held thestack of fax papers out to him. \"And your daughter... she's in danger.\"Bewildered, Sexton walked over, and took the fax pages from Gabrielle. The topsheet was a handwritten note. Sexton immediately recognized the writing. Thecommuniqué was awkward and shocking in its simplicity.Meteorite is fake. Here's proof. NASA/White House trying to kill me. Help! – RSThe senator seldom felt totally at a loss of understanding, but as he rereadRachel's words, he had no idea what to make of them.The meteorite is a fake? NASA and the White House are trying to kill her?In a deepening haze, Sexton began sifting through the half dozen sheets. Thefirst page was a computerized image whose heading read \"Ground Penetrating Radar(GPR).\" The picture appeared to be an ice-sounding of some sort. Sexton saw theextraction pit they had talked about on television. His eye was drawn to whatlooked like the faint outline of a body floating in the shaft. Then he sawsomething even more shocking – the clear outline of a second shaft directlybeneath where the meteorite had been – as if the stone had been inserted fromunderneath the ice.What in the world?Flipping to the next page, Sexton came face-to-face with a photograph of somesort of living ocean species called a Bathynomous giganteus. He stared in utteramazement. That's the animal from the meteorite fossils!Flipping faster now, he saw a graphic display depicting the ionized hydrogencontent in the meteorite's crust. This page had a handwritten scrawl on it:Slush-hydrogen burn? NASA Expander Cycle Engine?Sexton could not believe his eyes. With the room starting to spin around him, heflipped to the final page – a photo of a rock containing metallic bubbles thatlooked exactly like those in the meteorite. Shockingly, the accompanyingdescription said the rock was the product of oceanic volcanism. A rock from theocean? Sexton wondered. But NASA said chondrules form only in space!Sexton set the sheets down on his desk and collapsed in his chair. It had takenhim only fifteen seconds to piece together everything he was looking at. Theimplications of the images on the papers were crystal clear. Anyone with half abrain could see what these photos proved.The NASA meteorite is a fake!No day in Sexton's career had been filled with such extreme highs and lows.Today had been a roller-coaster ride of hope and despair. Sexton's bafflementover how this enormous scam could possibly have been pulled off evaporated intoirrelevance when he realized what the scam meant for him politically.When I go public with this information, the presidency is mine!In his upwelling of celebration, Senator Sedgewick Sexton had momentarilyforgotten his daughter's claim that she was in trouble.\"Rachel is in danger,\" Gabrielle said. \"Her note says NASA and the White Houseare trying to –\"Sexton's fax machine suddenly began ringing again. Gabrielle wheeled and staredat the machine. Sexton found himself staring too. He could not imagine what elseRachel could be sending him. More proof? How much more could there be? This isplenty!When the fax machine answered the call, however, no pages came through. Themachine, detecting no data signal, had switched to its answering machinefeature.\"Hello,\" Sexton's outbound message crackled. \"This is the office of SenatorSedgewick Sexton. If you are trying to send a fax, you may transmit at any time.If not, you may leave a message at the tone.\"Before Sexton could pick up, the machine beeped.\"Senator Sexton?\" The man's voice had a lucid rawness to it. \"This is WilliamPickering, director of the National Reconnaissance Office. You're probably notin the office at this hour, but I need to speak immediately.\" He paused as ifwaiting for someone to pick up.Gabrielle reached to pick up the receiver.Sexton grabbed her hand and violently yanked it away.Gabrielle looked stunned. \"But that's the director of –\"\"Senator,\" Pickering continued, sounding almost relieved that no one had pickedup. \"I'm afraid I am calling with some very troubling news. I've just receivedword that your daughter Rachel is in extreme danger. I have a team trying tohelp her as we speak. I cannot talk in detail about the situation on the phone,but I was just informed she may have faxed you some data relating to the NASAmeteorite. I have not seen the data, nor do I know what it is, but the peoplethreatening your daughter have just warned me that if you or anyone goes publicwith the information, your daughter will die. I'm sorry to be so blunt, sir; Ido it for clarity's sake. Your daughter's life is being threatened. If she hasindeed faxed you something, do not share it with anyone. Not yet. Yourdaughter's life depends on it. Stay where you are. I will be there shortly.\" Hepaused. \"With luck, senator, all of this will be resolved by the time you wakeup. If, by chance, you get this message before I arrive at your office, staywhere you are and call no one. I am doing everything in my power to get yourdaughter back safely.\"Pickering hung up.Gabrielle was trembling. \"Rachel is a hostage?\"Sexton sensed that even in her disillusionment with him, Gabrielle felt a painedempathy to think of a bright young woman in danger. Oddly, Sexton was havingtrouble mustering the same emotions. Most of him felt like a child who had justbeen given his most wanted Christmas present, and he refused to let anyone yankit out of his hands.Pickering wants me to be quiet about this?He stood a moment, trying to decide what all of this meant. In a cold,calculating side of his mind, Sexton felt the machinery beginning to turn – apolitical computer, playing out every scenario and evaluating each outcome. Heglanced at the stack of faxes in his hands and began to sense the raw power ofthe images. This NASA meteorite had shattered his dream of the presidency. Butit was all a lie. A construct. Now, those who did this would pay. The meteoritethat his enemies had created to destroy him would now make him powerful beyondanyone's wildest imagination. His daughter had seen to that.There is only one acceptable outcome, he knew. Only one course of action for atrue leader to take.Feeling hypnotized by the shining images of his own resurrection, Sexton wasdrifting through a fog as he crossed the room. He went to his copy machine andturned it on, preparing to copy the papers Rachel had faxed him.\"What are you doing?\" Gabrielle demanded, sounding bewildered.\"They won't kill Rachel,\" Sexton declared. Even if something went wrong, Sextonknew losing his daughter to the enemy would only make him more powerful still.Either way he would win. Acceptable risk.\"Who are those copies for?\" Gabrielle demanded. \"William Pickering said not totell anyone!\"Sexton turned from the machine and looked at Gabrielle, amazed by howunattractive he suddenly found her. In that instant, Senator Sexton was anisland. Untouchable. Everything he needed to accomplish his dreams was now inhis hands. Nothing could stop him now. Not claims of bribery. Not rumors of sex.Nothing.\"Go home, Gabrielle. I have no more use for you.\"125It's over, Rachel thought.She and Tolland sat side by side on the deck staring up into the barrel of theDelta soldier's machine gun. Unfortunately, Pickering now knew where Rachel hadsent the fax. The office of Senator Sedgewick Sexton.Rachel doubted her father would ever receive the phone message Pickering hadjust left him. Pickering could probably get to Sexton's office well beforeanyone else this morning. If Pickering could get in, quietly remove the fax, anddelete the phone message before Sexton arrived, there would be no need to harmthe senator. William Pickering was probably one of the few people in Washingtonwho could finagle entry to a U.S. senator's office with no fanfare. Rachel wasalways amazed at what could be accomplished \"in the name of national security.\"Of course if that fails, Rachel thought, Pickering could just fly by and send aHellfire missile through the window and blow up the fax machine. Something toldher this would not be necessary.Sitting close to Tolland now, Rachel was surprised to feel his hand gently slipinto hers. His touch had a tender strength, and their fingers intertwined sonaturally that Rachel felt like they'd done this for a lifetime. All she wantedright now was to lie in his arms, sheltered from the oppressive roar of thenight sea spiraling around them.Never, she realized. It was not to be.Michael Tolland felt like a man who had found hope on the way to the gallows.Life is mocking me.For years since Celia's death, Tolland had endured nights when he'd wanted todie, hours of pain and loneliness that seemed only escapable by ending it all.And yet he had chosen life, telling himself he could make it alone. Today, forthe first time, Tolland had begun to understand what his friends had beentelling him all along.Mike, you don't have to make it alone. You'll find another love.Rachel's hand in his made this irony that much harder to swallow. Fate had crueltiming. He felt as if layers of armor were crumbling away from his heart. For aninstant, on the tired decks of the Goya, Tolland sensed Celia's ghost lookingover him as she often did. Her voice was in the rushing water... speaking thelast words she'd spoken to him in life.\"You're a survivor,\" her voice whispered. \"Promise me you'll find another love.\"\"I'll never want another,\" Tolland had told her.Celia's smile was filled with wisdom. \"You'll have to learn.\"Now, on the deck of the Goya, Tolland realized, he was learning. A deep emotionwelled suddenly in his soul. He realized it was happiness.And with it came an overpowering will to live.Pickering felt oddly detached as he moved toward the two prisoners. He stoppedin front of Rachel, vaguely surprised that this was not harder for him.\"Sometimes,\" he said, \"circumstances raise impossible decisions.\"Rachel's eyes were unyielding. \"You created these circumstances.\"\"War involves casualties,\" Pickering said, his voice firmer now. Ask DianaPickering, or any of those who die every year defending this nation. \"You of allpeople should understand that, Rachel.\" His eyes focused in on her. \"Iacturapaucourm serva multos.\"He could see she recognized the words – almost a cliché in national securitycircles. Sacrifice the few to save the many.Rachel eyed him with obvious disgust. \"And now Michael and I have become part ofyour few?\"Pickering considered it. There was no other way. He turned to Delta-One.\"Release your partner and end this.\"Delta-One nodded.Pickering took a long last look at Rachel and then strode to the ship's nearbyportside railing, staring out at the sea racing by. This was something hepreferred not to watch.Delta-One felt empowered as he gripped his weapon and glanced over at hispartner dangling in the clamps. All that remained was to close the trapdoorsbeneath Delta-Two's feet, free him from the clamps, and eliminate Rachel Sextonand Michael Tolland.Unfortunately, Delta-One had seen the complexity of the control panel near thetrapdoor – a series of unmarked levers and dials that apparently controlled thetrapdoor, the winch motor, and numerous other commands. He had no intention ofhitting the wrong lever and risking his partner's life by mistakenly droppingthe sub into the sea.Eliminate all risk. Never rush.He would force Tolland to perform the actual release. And to ensure he did nottry anything tricky, Delta-One would take out insurance known in his business as\"biological collateral.\"Use your adversaries against one another.Delta-One swung the gun barrel directly into Rachel's face, stopping only inchesfrom her forehead. Rachel closed her eyes, and Delta-One could see Tolland'sfists clench in a protective anger.\"Ms. Sexton, stand up,\" Delta-One said.She did.With the gun firmly on her back, Delta-One marched her over to an aluminum setof portable stairs that led up to the top of the Triton sub from behind. \"Climbup and stand on top of the sub.\"Rachel looked frightened and confused.\"Just do it,\" Delta-One said.Rachel felt like she was moving through a nightmare as she climbed up thealuminum gangway behind the Triton. She stopped at the top, having no desire tostep out over the chasm onto the suspended Triton.\"Get on top of the sub,\" the soldier said, returning to Tolland and pushing thegun against his head.In front of Rachel the soldier who was in the clamps watched her, shifting inpain, obviously eager to get out. Rachel looked at Tolland, who now had a gunbarrel to his head. Get on top of the sub. She had no choice.Feeling like she was edging out onto a precipice overhanging a canyon, Rachelstepped onto the Triton's engine casing, a small flat section behind the roundeddome window. The entire sub hung like a massive plumb bob over the opentrapdoor. Even suspended on its winch cable, the nine-ton sub barely registeredher arrival, swinging only a few millimeters as she steadied herself.\"Okay, let's move,\" the soldier said to Tolland. \"Go to the controls and closethe trapdoor.\"At gunpoint, Tolland began moving toward the control panel with the soldierbehind him. As Tolland came toward her, he was moving slowly, and Rachel couldfeel his eyes fixing hard on her as if trying to send her a message. He lookeddirectly at her and then down at the open hatch on top of the Triton.Rachel glanced down. The hatch at her feet was open, the heavy circular coveringpropped open. She could see down into the one-seater cockpit. He wants me to getin? Sensing she must be mistaken, Rachel looked at Tolland again. He was almostto the control panel. Tolland's eyes locked on her. This time he was lesssubtle.His lips mouthed, \"Jump in! Now!\"Delta-One saw Rachel's motion out of the corner of his eye and wheeled oninstinct, opening fire as Rachel fell through the sub's hatch just below thebarrage of bullets. The open hatch covering rang out as the bullets ricochetedoff the circular portal, sending up a shower of sparks, and slamming the lidclosed on top of her.Tolland, the instant he'd felt the gun leave his back, made his move. He dove tohis left, away from the trapdoor, hitting the deck and rolling just as thesoldier spun back toward him, gun blazing. Bullets exploded behind Tolland as hescrambled for cover behind the ship's stern anchor spool – an enormous motorizedcylinder around which was wound several thousand feet of steel cable connectedto the ship's anchor.Tolland had a plan and would have to act fast. As the soldier dashed toward him,Tolland reached up and grabbed the anchor lock with both hands, yanking down.Instantly the anchor spool began feeding out lengths of cable, and the Goyalurched in the strong current. The sudden movement sent everything and everyoneon the deck staggering sidelong. As the boat accelerated in reverse on thecurrent, the anchor spool doled out cable faster and faster.Come on, baby, Tolland urged.The soldier regained his balance and came for Tolland. Waiting until the lastpossible moment, Tolland braced himself and rammed the lever back up, lockingthe anchor spool. The chain snapped taut, stopping the ship short and sending atremulous shudder throughout the Goya. Everything on deck went flying. Thesoldier staggered to his knees near Tolland. Pickering fell back from therailing onto the deck. The Triton swung wildly on its cable.A grating howl of failing metal tore up from beneath the ship like an earthquakeas the damaged strut finally gave way. The right stern corner of the Goya begancollapsing under its own weight. The ship faltered, tilting on a diagonal like amassive table losing one of its four legs. The noise from beneath was deafening– a wail of twisting, grating metal and pounding surf.White-knuckled inside the Triton cockpit, Rachel held on as the nine-ton machineswayed over the trapdoor in the now steeply inclined deck. Through the base ofthe glass dome she could see the ocean raging below. As she looked up, her eyesscanning the deck for Tolland, she watched a bizarre drama on the deck unfold ina matter of seconds.Only a yard away, trapped in the Triton's claws, the clamped Delta soldier washowling in pain as he bobbed like a puppet on a stick. William Pickeringscrambled across Rachel's field of vision and grabbed on to a cleat on the deck.Near the anchor lever, Tolland was also hanging on, trying not to slide over theedge into the water. When Rachel saw the soldier with the machine gunstabilizing himself nearby, she called out inside the sub. \"Mike, look out!\"But Delta-One ignored Tolland entirely. The soldier was looking back toward theidling helicopter with his mouth open in horror. Rachel turned, following hisgaze. The Kiowa gunship, with its huge rotors still turning, had started toslowly slide forward down the tipping deck. Its long metal skids were actinglike skis on a slope. It was then that Rachel realized the huge machine wasskidding directly toward the Triton.Scrambling up the inclined deck toward the sliding aircraft, Delta-One clamberedinto the cockpit. He had no intention of letting their only means of escapeslide off the deck. Delta-One seized the Kiowa's controls and heaved back on thestick. Lift off! With a deafening roar, the blades accelerated overhead,straining to lift the heavily armed gunship off the deck. Up, goddamn it! Thechopper was sliding directly toward the Triton and Delta-Two suspended in itsgrasp.With its nose tipped forward, the Kiowa's blades were also tipped, and when thechopper lurched off the deck, it sailed more forward than up, acceleratingtoward the Triton like a giant buzz saw. Up! Delta-One pulled the stick, wishinghe could drop the half ton of Hellfire warheads weighing him down. The bladesjust missed the top of Delta-Two's head and the top of the Triton sub, but thechopper was moving too fast. It would never clear the Triton's winch cable.As the Kiowa's 300-rpm steel blades collided with the sub's fifteen-ton capacitybraided steel winch cable, the night erupted with the shriek of metal on metal.The sounds conjured images of epic battle. From the chopper's armored cockpit,Delta-One watched his rotors tear into the sub's cable like a giant lawn mowerrunning over a steel chain. A blinding spray of sparks erupted overhead, and theKiowa's blades exploded. Delta-One felt the chopper bottom out, its strutshitting the deck hard. He tried to control the aircraft, but he had no lift. Thechopper bounded twice down the inclined deck, then slid, crashing into theship's guardrail.For a moment, he thought the rail would hold.Then Delta-One heard the crack. The heavily laden chopper listed over the brink,plummeting into the sea.Inside the Triton, Rachel Sexton sat paralyzed, her body pressed back into thesub's seat. The minisub had been tossed violently as the chopper's rotor wrappedaround the cable, but she had managed to hang on. Somehow the blades had missedthe main body of the sub, but she knew there had to be major damage to thecable. All Rachel could think of at that point was escaping from the sub as fastas she could. The soldier trapped in the clamps stared in at her, delirious,bleeding, and burned from the shrapnel. Beyond him, Rachel saw William Pickeringstill holding on to a cleat on the slanting deck.Where's Michael? She didn't see him. Her panic lasted only an instant as a newfear descended. Overhead, the Triton's shredded winch cable let out an ominouswhipping noise as the braids unraveled. Then, there was a loud snap, and Rachelfelt the cable give way.Momentarily weightless, Rachel hovered above her seat inside the cockpit as thesub hurtled downward. The deck disappeared overhead, and the catwalks under theGoya raced by. The soldier trapped in the claws went white with fear, staring atRachel as the sub accelerated downward.The fall seemed endless.When the sub crashed into the sea beneath the Goya, it plunged hard under thesurf, ramming Rachel down hard into her seat. Her spine compressed as theilluminated ocean raced up over the dome. She felt a suffocating drag as the subslowed to a stop underwater and then raced back toward the surface, bobbing uplike a cork.The sharks hit instantly. From her front-row seat, Rachel sat frozen in place asthe spectacle unfolded only a few feet away.Delta-Two felt the shark's oblong head crash into him with unimaginable force. Arazor sharp clamp tightened on his upper arm, slicing to the bone and lockingon. A flash of white-hot pain exploded as the shark torqued its powerful bodyand shook its head violently, tearing Delta-Two's arm off his body. Otherssharks moved in. Knives stabbing at his legs. Torso. Neck. Delta-Two had nobreath to scream in agony as the sharks ripped huge chunks of his body away. Thelast thing he saw was a crescent-shaped mouth, tilting sideways, a gorge ofteeth clamping down across his face.The world went black.Inside the Triton, the thudding of heavy cartilaginous heads ramming into thedome finally subsided. Rachel opened her eyes. The man was gone. The waterwashing against the window was crimson.Badly battered, Rachel huddled in her chair, knees pulled to her chest. Shecould feel the sub moving. It was drifting on the current, scraping along thelength of the Goya's lower dive deck. She could feel it moving in anotherdirection as well. Down.Outside, the distinctive gurgling of water into the ballast tanks grew louder.The ocean inched higher on the glass in front of her.I'm sinking!A jolt of terror shot through Rachel, and she was suddenly scrambling to herfeet. Reaching overhead, she grabbed the hatch mechanism. If she could climb upon top of the sub, she still had time to jump onto the Goya's dive deck. It wasonly a few feet away.I've got to get out!The hatch mechanism was clearly marked which way to turn it to open. She heaved.The hatch did not budge. She tried again. Nothing. The portal was jammed shut.Bent. As the fear rose in her blood like the sea around her, Rachel heaved onelast time.The hatch did not move.The Triton sank a few inches deeper, bumping the Goya one last time beforedrifting out from underneath the mangled hull... and into the open sea.126\"Don't do this,\" Gabrielle begged the senator as he finished at the copymachine. \"You're risking your daughter's life!\"Sexton blocked out her voice, moving back to his desk now with ten identicalstacks of photocopies. Each stack contained copies of the pages Rachel had faxedhim, including her handwritten note claiming the meteorite was a fake andaccusing NASA and the White House of trying to kill her.The most shocking media kits ever assembled, Sexton thought, as he begancarefully inserting each stack into its own large, white linen envelope. Eachenvelope bore his name, office address, and senatorial seal. There would be nodoubt where this incredible information had originated. The political scandal ofthe century, Sexton thought, and I will be the one to reveal it!Gabrielle was still pleading for Rachel's safety, but Sexton heard only silence.As he assembled the envelopes, he was in his own private world. Every politicalcareer has a defining moment. This is mine.William Pickering's phone message had warned that if Sexton went public,Rachel's life would be in danger. Unfortunately for Rachel, Sexton also knew ifhe went public with proof of NASA's fraud, that single act of boldness wouldland him in the White House with more decisiveness and political drama than everbefore witnessed in American politics.Life is filled with difficult decisions, he thought. And winners are those whomake them.Gabrielle Ashe had seen this look in Sexton's eyes before. Blind ambition. Shefeared it. And with good reason, she now realized. Sexton was obviously preparedto risk his daughter in order to be the first to announce the NASA fraud.\"Don't you see you've already won?\" Gabrielle demanded. \"There's no way ZachHerney and NASA will survive this scandal. No matter who makes it public! Nomatter when it comes out! Wait until you know Rachel is safe. Wait until youtalk to Pickering!\"Sexton was clearly no longer listening to her. Opening his desk drawer, hepulled out a foil sheet on which were affixed dozens of nickel-sized,self-adhesive wax seals with his initials on them. Gabrielle knew he usuallyused these for formal invitations, but he apparently thought a crimson wax sealwould give each envelope an extra touch of drama. Peeling the circular seals offthe foil, Sexton pressed one onto the pleat of each envelope, sealing it like amonogrammed epistle.Gabrielle's heart pulsed now with a new anger. She thought of the digitizedimages of illegal checks in his computer. If she said anything, she knew hewould just delete the evidence. \"Don't do this,\" she said, \"or I'll go publicabout our affair.\"Sexton laughed out loud as he affixed the wax seals. \"Really? And you thinkthey'll believe you – a power-hungry aide denied a post in my administration andlooking for revenge at any cost? I denied our involvement once, and the worldbelieved me. I'll simply deny it again.\"\"The White House has photos,\" Gabrielle declared.Sexton did not even look up. \"They don't have photos. And even if they did,they're meaningless.\" He affixed the final wax seal. \"I have immunity. Theseenvelopes out-trump anything anyone could possibly throw at me.\"Gabrielle knew he was right. She felt utterly helpless as Sexton admired hishandiwork. On his desk sat ten elegant, white linen envelopes, each embossedwith his name and address and secured with a crimson wax seal bearing hisscripted initials. They looked like royal letters. Certainly kings had beencrowned on account of less potent information.Sexton picked up the envelopes and prepared to leave. Gabrielle stepped over andblocked his way. \"You're making a mistake. This can wait.\"Sexton's eyes bored into her. \"I made you, Gabrielle, and now I've unmade you.\"\"That fax from Rachel will give you the presidency. You owe her.\"\"I've given her plenty.\"\"What if something happens to her!\"\"Then she'll cement my sympathy vote.\"Gabrielle could not believe the thought had even crossed his mind, much less hislips. Disgusted, she reached for the phone. \"I'm calling the White –\"Sexton spun and slapped her hard across the face.Gabrielle staggered back, feeling her lip split open. She caught herself,grabbing on to the desk, staring up in astonishment at the man she had onceworshiped.Sexton gave her a long, hard look. \"If you so much as think of crossing me onthis, I will make you regret it for the rest of your life.\" He stoodunflinching, clutching the stack of sealed envelopes under his arm. A harshdanger burned in his eyes.When Gabrielle exited the office building into the cold night air, her lip wasstill bleeding. She hailed a taxi and climbed in. Then, for the first time sinceshe had come to Washington, Gabrielle Ashe broke down and cried.127The Triton fell...Michael Tolland staggered to his feet on the inclined deck and peered over theanchor spool at the frayed winch cable where the Triton used to hang. Wheelingtoward the stern, he scanned the water. The Triton was just now emerging fromunder the Goya on the current. Relieved at least to see the sub intact, Tollandeyed the hatch, wanting nothing more than to see it open up and Rachel climb outunscathed. But the hatch remained closed. Tolland wondered if maybe she had beenknocked out by the violent fall.Even from the deck, Tolland could see the Triton was riding exceptionally low inthe water – far below its normal diving trim waterline. It's sinking. Tollandcould not imagine why, but the reason at the moment was immaterial.I have to get Rachel out. Now.As Tolland stood to dash for the edge of the deck, a shower of machine-gun fireexploded above him, sparking off the heavy anchor spool overhead. He droppedback to his knees. Shit! He peered around the spool only long enough to seePickering on the upper deck, taking aim like a sniper. The Delta soldier haddropped his machine gun while climbing into the doomed helicopter and Pickeringhad apparently recovered it. Now the director had scrambled to the high ground.Trapped behind the spool, Tolland looked back toward the sinking Triton. Comeon, Rachel! Get out! He waited for the hatch to open. Nothing.Looking back to the deck of the Goya, Tolland's eyes measured the open areabetween his position and the stern railing. Twenty feet. A long way without anycover.Tolland took a deep breath and made up his mind. Ripping off his shirt, hehurled it to his right onto the open deck. While Pickering blew the shirt fullof holes, Tolland dashed left, down the inclined deck, banking toward the stern.With a wild leap he launched himself over the railing, off the back of the ship.Arcing high in the air, Tolland heard the bullets whizzing all around him andknew a single graze would make him a shark feast the instant he hit the water.Rachel Sexton felt like a wild animal trapped in a cage. She had tried the hatchagain and again with no luck. She could hear a tank somewhere beneath herfilling with water, and she sensed the sub gaining weight. The darkness of theocean was inching higher up the transparent dome, a black curtain rising inreverse.Through the lower half of the glass, Rachel could see the void of the oceanbeckoning like a tomb. The empty vastness beneath threatened to swallow herwhole. She grabbed the hatch mechanism and tried to twist it open one more time,but it wouldn't budge. Her lungs strained now, the dank stench of excess carbondioxide acrid in her nostrils. Through it all, one recurring thought hauntedher.I'm going to die alone underwater.She scanned the Triton's control panels and levers for something that couldhelp, but all the indicators were black. No power. She was locked in a deadsteel crypt sinking toward the bottom of the sea.The gurgling in the tanks seemed to be accelerating now, and the ocean rose towithin a few feet of the top of the glass. In the distance, across the endlessflat expanse, a band of crimson was inching across the horizon. Morning was onits way. Rachel feared it would be the last light she ever saw. Closing her eyesto block out her impending fate, Rachel felt the terrifying childhood imagesrushing into her mind.Falling through the ice. Sliding underwater.Breathless. Unable to lift herself. Sinking.Her mother calling for her. \"Rachel! Rachel!\"A pounding on the outside of the sub jolted Rachel out of the delirium. Her eyessnapped open.\"Rachel!\" The voice was muffled. A ghostly face appeared against the glass,upside down, dark hair swirling. She could barely make him out in the darkness.\"Michael!\"Tolland surfaced, exhaling in relief to see Rachel moving inside the sub. She'salive. Tolland swam with powerful strokes to the rear of the Triton and climbedup onto the submerged engine platform. The ocean currents felt hot and leadenaround him as he positioned himself to grab the circular portal screw, stayinglow and hoping he was out of range of Pickering's gun.The Triton's hull was almost entirely underwater now, and Tolland knew if hewere going to open the hatch and pull Rachel out, he would have to hurry. He hada ten-inch draw that was diminishing fast. Once the hatch was submerged, openingit would send a torrent of seawater gushing into the Triton, trapping Rachelinside and sending the sub into a free fall to the bottom.\"Now or never,\" he gasped as he grabbed the hatch wheel and heaved itcounterclockwise. Nothing happened. He tried again, throwing all of his forceinto it. Again, the hatch refused to turn.He could hear Rachel inside, on the other side of the portal. Her voice wasstifled, but he sensed her terror. \"I tried!\" she shouted. \"I couldn't turn it!\"The water was lapping across the portal lid now. \"Turn together!\" he shouted toher. \"You're clockwise in there!\" He knew the dial was clearly marked. \"Okay,now!\"Tolland braced himself against the ballast air tanks and strained with all hisenergy. He could hear Rachel below him doing the same. The dial turned a halfinch and ground to a dead stop.Now Tolland saw it. The portal lid was not set evenly in the aperture. Like thelid of a jar that had been placed on crooked and screwed down hard, it wasstuck. Although the rubber seal was properly set, the hatch-dogs were bent,meaning the only way that door was opening was with a welding torch.As the top of the sub sank below the surface, Tolland was filled with a sudden,overwhelming dread. Rachel Sexton would not be escaping from the Triton.Two thousand feet below, the crumpled fuselage of the bomb-laden Kiowa chopperwas sinking fast, a prisoner of gravity and the powerful drag of the deepwatervortex. Inside the cockpit, Delta-One's lifeless body was no longerrecognizable, disfigured by the crushing pressure of the deep.As the aircraft spiraled downward, its Hellfire missiles still attached, theglowing magma dome waited on the ocean floor like a red-hot landing pad. Beneathits three-meter-thick crust, a head of boiling lava simmered at a thousanddegrees Celsius, a volcano waiting to explode.128Tolland stood knee-deep in water on the engine box of the sinking Triton andsearched his brain for some way to save Rachel.Don't let the sub sink!He looked back toward the Goya, wondering if there were any way to get a winchconnected to the Triton to keep it near the surface. Impossible. It was fiftyyards away now, and Pickering was standing high on the bridge like a Romanemperor with a prime seat at some bloody Colosseum spectacle.Think! Tolland told himself. Why is the sub sinking?The mechanics of sub buoyancy were painfully simple: ballast tanks pumped fullof either air or water adjusted the sub's buoyancy to move it up or down in thewater.Obviously, the ballast tanks were filling up.But they shouldn't be!Every sub's ballast tanks were equipped with holes both topside and underneath.The lower openings, called \"flooding holes,\" always remained open, while theholes on top, \"vent valves,\" could be opened and closed to let air escape sowater would flood in.Maybe the Triton's vent valves were open for some reason? Tolland could notimagine why. He floundered across the submerged engine platform, his handsgroping one of the Triton's ballast trim tanks. The vent valves were closed. Butas he felt the valves, his fingers found something else.Bullet holes.Shit! The Triton had been riddled with bullets when Rachel jumped in. Tollandimmediately dove down and swam beneath the sub, running his hand carefullyacross the Triton's more important ballast tank – the negative tank. The Britscalled this tank \"the down express.\" The Germans called it \"putting on leadshoes.\" Either way, the meaning was clear. The negative tank, when filled, tookthe sub down.As Tolland's hand felt the sides of the tank, he encountered dozens of bulletholes. He could feel the water rushing in. The Triton was preparing to dive,whether Tolland liked it or not.The sub was now three feet beneath the surface. Moving to the bow, Tollandpressed his face against the glass and peered through the dome. Rachel wasbanging on the glass and shouting. The fear in her voice made him feelpowerless. For an instant he was back in a cold hospital, watching the woman heloved die and knowing there was nothing he could do. Hovering underwater infront of the sinking sub, Tolland told himself he could not endure this again.You're a survivor, Celia had told him, but Tolland did not want to survivealone... not again.Tolland's lungs ached for air and yet he stayed right there with her. Every timeRachel pounded on the glass, Tolland heard air bubbles gurgling up and the subsank deeper. Rachel was yelling something about water coming in around thewindow.The viewing window was leaking.A bullet hole in the window? It seemed doubtful. His lungs ready to burst,Tolland prepared to surface. As he palmed upward across the huge acrylic window,his fingers hit a piece of loose rubber caulking. A peripheral seal hadapparently been jarred in the fall. This was the reason the cockpit was leaking.More bad news.Clambering to the surface, Tolland sucked in three deep breaths, trying to clearhis thoughts. Water flowing into the cockpit would only accelerate the Triton'sdescent. The sub was already five feet underwater, and Tolland could barelytouch it with his feet. He could feel Rachel pounding desperately on the hull.Tolland could think of only one thing to do. If he dove down to the Triton'sengine box and located the high-pressure air cylinder, he could use it to blowthe negative ballast tank. Although blowing the damaged tank would be anexercise in futility, it might keep the Triton near the surface for anotherminute or so before the perforated tanks flooded again.Then what?With no other immediate option, Tolland prepared to dive. Pulling in anexceptionally deep breath, he expanded his lungs well beyond their naturalstate, almost to the point of pain. More lung capacity. More oxygen. Longerdive. But as he felt his lungs expand, pressuring his rib cage, a strangethought hit him.What if he increased the pressure inside the sub? The viewing dome had a damagedseal. Maybe if Tolland could increase the pressure inside the cockpit, he couldblow the entire viewing dome off the sub and get Rachel out.He exhaled his breath, treading water on the surface a moment, trying to picturethe feasibility. It was perfectly logical, wasn't it? After all, a submarine wasbuilt to be strong in only one direction. They had to withstand enormouspressure from the outside, but almost none from within.Moreover, the Triton used uniform regulator valves to decrease the number ofspare parts the Goya had to carry. Tolland could simply unsnap the high pressurecylinder's charging hose and reroute it into an emergency ventilation supplyregulator on the port side of the sub! Pressurizing the cabin would cause Rachelsubstantial physical pain, but it might just give her a way out.Tolland inhaled and dove.The sub was a good eight feet down now, and the currents and darkness madeorienting himself difficult. Once he found the pressurized tank, Tolland quicklyrerouted the hose and prepared to pump air into the cockpit. As he gripped thestopcock, the reflective yellow paint on the side of the tank reminded him justhow dangerous this maneuver was: CAUTION: COMPRESSED AIR – 3,000 PSI.Three thousand pounds per square inch, Tolland thought. The hope was that theTriton's viewing dome would pop off the sub before the pressure in the cabincrushed Rachel's lungs. Tolland was essentially sticking a high-powered firehose into a water balloon and praying the balloon would break in a hurry.He grabbed the stopcock and made up his mind. Suspended there on the back of thesinking Triton, Tolland turned the stopcock, opening the valve. The hose wentrigid immediately, and Tolland could hear the air flooding the cockpit withenormous force.Inside the Triton, Rachel felt a sudden searing pain slice into her head. Sheopened her mouth to scream, but the air forced itself into her lungs with suchpainful pressure that she thought her chest would explode. Her eyes felt likethey were being rammed backward into her skull. A deafening rumble tore throughher eardrums, pushing her toward unconsciousness. Instinctively, she clenchedher eyes tight and pressed her hands over her ears. The pain was increasing now.Rachel heard a pounding directly in front of her. She forced her eyes open justlong enough to see the watery silhouette of Michael Tolland in the darkness. Hisface was against the glass. He was motioning for her to do something.But what?She could barely see him in the darkness. Her vision was blurred, her eyeballsdistorted from the pressure. Even so, she could tell the sub had sunk beyond thelast flickering fingers of the Goya's underwater lights. Around her was only anendless inky abyss.Tolland spread himself against the window of the Triton and kept banging. Hischest burned for air, and he knew he would have to return to the surface in amatter of seconds.Push on the glass! he willed her. He could hear pressurized air escaping aroundthe glass, bubbling up. Somewhere, the seal was loose. Tolland's hands gropedfor an edge, something to get his fingers under. Nothing.As his oxygen ran out, tunnel vision closed in, and he banged on the glass onelast time. He could not even see her anymore. It was too dark. With the last ofthe air in his lungs, he yelled out underwater.\"Rachel... push... on... the... glass!\"His words came out as a bubbling, muted garble.129Inside the Triton, Rachel's head felt like it was being compressed in some kindof medieval torture vise. Half-standing, stooped beside the cockpit chair, shecould feel death closing in around her. Directly in front of her, thehemispherical viewing dome was empty. Dark. The banging had stopped.Tolland was gone. He had left her.The hiss of pressurized air blasting in overhead reminded her of the deafeningkatabatic wind on Milne. The floor of the sub had a foot of water on it now. Letme out! Thousands of thoughts and memories began streaming through her mind likeflashes of violet light.In the darkness, the sub began to list, and Rachel staggered, losing herbalance. Stumbling over the seat, she fell forward, colliding hard with theinside of the hemispherical dome. A sharp pain erupted in her shoulder. Shelanded in a heap against the window, and as she did, she felt an unexpectedsensation – a sudden decrease in the pressure inside the sub. The tightened drumof Rachel's ears loosened perceptibly, and she actually heard a gurgle of airescape the sub.It took her an instant to realize what had just happened. When she'd fallenagainst the dome, her weight had somehow forced the bulbous sheet outward enoughfor some of the internal pressure to be released around a seal. Obviously, thedome glass was loose! Rachel suddenly realized what Tolland had been trying todo by increasing the pressure inside.He's trying to blow out the window!Overhead, the Triton's pressure cylinder continued to pump. Even as she laythere, she felt the pressure increasing again. This time she almost welcomed it,although she felt the suffocating grip pushing her dangerously close tounconsciousness. Scrambling to her feet, Rachel pressed outward with all herforce on the inside of the glass.This time, there was no gurgle. The glass barely moved.She threw her weight against the window again. Nothing. Her shoulder woundached, and she looked down at it. The blood was dry. She prepared to try again,but she did not have time. Without warning, the crippled sub began to tip –backward. As its heavy engine box overcame the flooded trim tanks, the Tritonrolled onto its back, sinking rear-first now.Rachel fell onto her back against the cockpit's rear wall. Half submerged insloshing water, she stared straight up at the leaking dome, hovering over herlike a giant skylight.Outside was only night... and thousands of tons of ocean pressing down.Rachel willed herself to get up, but her body felt dead and heavy. Again hermind reeled backward in time to the icy grip of a frozen river.\"Fight, Rachel!\" her mother was shouting, reaching down to pull her out of thewater. \"Grab on!\"Rachel closed her eyes. I'm sinking. Her skates felt like lead weights, draggingher down. She could see her mother lying spread-eagle on the ice to disperse herown weight, reaching out.\"Kick, Rachel! Kick with your feet!\"Rachel kicked as best as she could. Her body rose slightly in the icy hole. Aspark of hope. Her mother grabbed on.\"Yes!\" her mother shouted. \"Help me lift you! Kick with your feet!\"With her mother pulling from above, Rachel used the last of her energy to kickwith her skates. It was just enough, and her mother dragged Rachel up to safety.She dragged the soaking Rachel all the way to the snowy bank before collapsingin tears.Now, inside the growing humidity and heat of the sub, Rachel opened her eyes tothe blackness around her. She heard her mother whispering from the grave, hervoice clear even here in the sinking Triton.Kick with your feet.Rachel looked up at the dome overhead. Mustering the last of her courage, Rachelclambered up onto the cockpit chair, which was oriented almost horizontally now,like a dental chair. Lying on her back, Rachel bent her knees, pulled her legsback as far as she could, aimed her feet upward, and exploded forward. With awild scream of desperation and force, she drove her feet into the center of theacrylic dome. Spikes of pain shot into her shins, sending her brain reeling. Herears thundered suddenly, and she felt the pressure equalize with a violent rush.The seal on the left side of the dome gave way, and the huge lens partiallydislodged, swinging open like a barn door.A torrent of water crashed into the sub and drove Rachel back into her chair.The ocean thundered in around her, swirling up under her back, lifting her nowoff the chair, tossing her upside down like a sock in a washing machine. Rachelgroped blindly for something to hold on to, but she was spinning wildly. As thecockpit filled, she could feel the sub begin a rapid free fall for the bottom.Her body rammed upward in the cockpit, and she felt herself pinned. A rush ofbubbles erupted around her, twisting her, dragging her to the left and upward. Aflap of hard acrylic smashed into her hip.All at once she was free.Twisting and tumbling into the endless warmth and watery blackness, Rachel felther lungs already aching for air. Get to the surface! She looked for light butsaw nothing. Her world looked the same in all directions. Blackness. No gravity.No sense of up or down.In that terrifying instant, Rachel realized she had no idea which way to swim.Thousands of feet beneath her, the sinking Kiowa chopper crumpled beneath therelentlessly increasing pressure. The fifteen high-explosive, antitank AGM-114Hellfire missiles still aboard strained against the compression, their copperliner cones and spring-detonation heads inching perilously inward.A hundred feet above the ocean floor, the powerful shaft of the megaplumegrabbed the remains of the chopper and sucked it downward, hurling it againstthe red-hot crust of the magma dome. Like a box of matches igniting in series,the Hellfire missiles exploded, tearing a gaping hole through the top of themagma dome.Having surfaced for air, and then dove again in desperation, Michael Tolland wassuspended fifteen feet underwater scanning the blackness when the Hellfiremissiles exploded. The white flash billowed upward, illuminating an astonishingimage – a freeze-frame he would remember forever.Rachel Sexton hung ten feet below him like a tangled marionette in the water.Beneath her, the Triton sub fell away fast, its dome hanging loose. The sharksin the area scattered for the open sea, clearly sensing the danger this area wasabout to unleash.Tolland's exhilaration at seeing Rachel out of the sub was instantly vanquishedby the realization of what was about to follow. Memorizing her position as thelight disappeared, Tolland dove hard, clawing his way toward her.Thousands of feet down, the shattered crust of the magma dome exploded apart,and the underwater volcano erupted, spewing twelve-hundred-degree-Celsius magmaup into the sea. The scorching lava vaporized all the water it touched, sendinga massive pillar of steam rocketing toward the surface up the central axis ofthe megaplume. Driven by the same kinematic properties of fluid dynamics thatpowered tornadoes, the steam's vertical transfer of energy was counterbalancedby an anticyclonic vorticity spiral that circled the shaft, carrying energy inthe opposite direction.Spiraling around this column of rising gas, the ocean currents startedintensifying, twisting downward. The fleeing steam created an enormous vacuumthat sucked millions of gallons of seawater downward into contact with themagma. As the new water hit bottom, it too turned into steam and needed a way toescape, joining the growing column of exhaust steam and shooting upward, pullingmore water in beneath it. As more water rushed in to take its place, the vortexintensified. The hydrothermal plume elongated, and the towering whirlpool grewstronger with every passing second, its upper rim moving steadily toward thesurface.An oceanic black hole had just been born.Rachel felt like a child in a womb. Hot, wet darkness all engulfing her. Herthoughts were muddled in the inky warmth. Breathe. She fought the reflex. Theflash of light she had seen could only have come from the surface, and yet itseemed so far away. An illusion. Get to the surface. Weakly, Rachel beganswimming in the direction where she had seen the light. She saw more lightnow... an eerie red glow in the distance. Daylight? She swam harder.A hand caught her by the ankle.Rachel half-screamed underwater, almost exhaling the last of her air.The hand pulled her backward, twisting her, pointing her back in the oppositedirection. Rachel felt a familiar hand grasp hers. Michael Tolland was there,pulling her along with him the other way.Rachel's mind said he was taking her down. Her heart said he knew what he wasdoing.Kick with your feet, her mother's voice whispered.Rachel kicked as hard as she could.130Even as Tolland and Rachel broke the surface, he knew it was over. The magmadome erupted. As soon as the top of the vortex reached the surface, the giantunderwater tornado would begin pulling everything down. Strangely, the worldabove the surface was not the quiet dawn he had left only moments ago. The noisewas deafening. Wind slashed at him as if some kind of storm had hit while he wasunderwater.Tolland felt delirious from lack of oxygen. He tried to support Rachel in thewater, but she was being pulled from his arms. The current! Tolland tried tohold on, but the invisible force pulled harder, threatening to tear her fromhim. Suddenly, his grip slipped, and Rachel's body slid through his arms – butupward.Bewildered, Tolland watched Rachel's body rise out of the water.Overhead, the Coast Guard Osprey tilt-rotor airplane hovered and winched Rachelin. Twenty minutes ago, the Coast Guard had gotten a report of an explosion outat sea. Having lost track of the Dolphin helicopter that was supposed to be inthe area, they feared an accident. They typed the chopper's last knowncoordinates into their navigation system and hoped for the best.About a half mile from the illuminated Goya, they saw a field of burningwreckage drifting on the current. It looked like a speedboat. Nearby, a man wasin the water, waving his arms wildly. They winched him in. He was stark naked –all except for one leg, which was covered with duct tape.Exhausted, Tolland looked up at the underbelly of the thundering tilt-rotorairplane. Deafening gusts pounded down off its horizontal propellers. As Rachelrose on a cable, numerous sets of hands pulled her into the fuselage. As Tollandwatched her dragged to safety, his eyes spotted a familiar man crouchedhalf-naked in the doorway.Corky? Tolland's heart soared. You're alive!Immediately, the harness fell from the sky again. It landed ten feet away.Tolland wanted to swim for it, but he could already feel the sucking sensationof the plume. The relentless grip of the sea wrapped around him, refusing to letgo.The current pulled him under. He fought toward the surface, but the exhaustionwas overwhelming. You're a survivor, someone was saying. He kicked his legs,clawing toward the surface. When he broke through into the pounding wind, theharness was still out of reach. The current strained to drag him under. Lookingup into the torrent of swirling wind and noise, Tolland saw Rachel. She wasstaring down, her eyes willing him up toward her.It took Tolland four powerful strokes to reach the harness. With his last ounceof strength, he slid his arm and head up into the loop and collapsed.All at once the ocean was falling away beneath him.Tolland looked down just as the gaping vortex opened. The megaplume had finallyreached the surface.• • •William Pickering stood on the bridge of the Goya and watched in dumbstruck aweas the spectacle unfolded all around him. Off the starboard of the Goya's stern,a huge basinlike depression was forming on the surface of the sea. The whirlpoolwas hundreds of yards across and expanding fast. The ocean spiraled into it,racing with an eerie smoothness over the lip. All around him now, a gutturalmoan reverberated out of the depths. Pickering's mind was blank as he watchedthe hole expanding toward him like the gaping mouth of some epic god hungry forsacrifice.I'm dreaming, Pickering thought.Suddenly, with an explosive hiss that shattered the windows of the Goya'sbridge, a towering plume of steam erupted skyward out of the vortex. A colossalgeyser climbed overhead, thundering, its apex disappearing into the darkenedsky.Instantly, the funnel walls steepened, the perimeter expanding faster now,chewing across the ocean toward him. The stern of the Goya swung hard toward theexpanding cavity. Pickering lost his balance and fell to his knees. Like a childbefore God, he gazed downward into the growing abyss.His final thoughts were for his daughter, Diana. He prayed she had not knownfear like this when she died.The concussion wave from the escaping steam hurled the Osprey sideways. Tollandand Rachel held each other as the pilots recovered, banking low over the doomedGoya. Looking out, they could see William Pickering – the Quaker – kneeling inhis black coat and tie at the upper railing of the doomed ship.As the stern fishtailed out over the brink of the massive twister, the anchorcable finally snapped. With its bow proudly in the air, the Goya slippedbackward over the watery ledge, sucked down the steep spiraling wall of water.Her lights were still glowing as she disappeared beneath the sea.131The Washington morning was clear and crisp.A breeze sent eddies of leaves skittering around the base of the WashingtonMonument. The world's largest obelisk usually awoke to its own peaceful image inthe reflecting pool, but today the morning brought with it a chaos of jostlingreporters, all crowding around the monument's base in anticipation.Senator Sedgewick Sexton felt larger than Washington itself as he stepped fromhis limousine and strode like a lion toward the press area awaiting him at thebase of the monument. He had invited the nation's ten largest media networkshere and promised them the scandal of the decade.Nothing brings out the vultures like the smell of death, Sexton thought.In his hand, Sexton clutched the stack of white linen envelopes, each elegantlywax-embossed with his monogrammed seal. If information was power, then Sextonwas carrying a nuclear warhead.He felt intoxicated as he approached the podium, pleased to see his improvisedstage included two \"fameframes\" – large, free-standing partitions that flankedhis podium like navy-blue curtains – an old Ronald Reagan trick to ensure hestood out against any backdrop.Sexton entered stage right, striding out from behind the partition like an actorout of the wings. The reporters quickly took their seats in the several rows offolding chairs facing his podium. To the east, the sun was just breaking overthe Capitol dome, shooting rays of pink and gold down on Sexton like rays fromheaven.A perfect day to become the most powerful man in the world.\"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,\" Sexton said, laying the envelopes on thelectern before him. \"I will make this as short and painless as possible. Theinformation I am about to share with you is, frankly, quite disturbing. Theseenvelopes contain proof of a deceit at the highest levels of government. I amashamed to say that the President called me half an hour ago and begged me –yes, begged me – not to go public with this evidence.\" He shook his head withdismay. \"And yet, I am a man who believes in the truth. No matter how painful.\"Sexton paused, holding up the envelopes, tempting the seated crowd. Thereporters' eyes followed the envelopes back and forth, a pack of dogs salivatingover some unknown delicacy.The President had called Sexton a half hour ago and explained everything. Herneyhad talked to Rachel, who was safely aboard a plane somewhere. Incredibly, itseemed the White House and NASA were innocent bystanders in this fiasco, a plotmasterminded by William Pickering.Not that it matters, Sexton thought. Zach Herney is still going down hard.Sexton wished he could be a fly on the wall of the White House right now to seethe President's face when he realized Sexton was going public. Sexton had agreedto meet Herney at the White House right now to discuss how best to tell thenation the truth about the meteorite. Herney was probably standing in front of atelevision at this very moment in dumbfounded shock, realizing that there wasnothing the White House could do to stop the hand of fate.\"My friends,\" Sexton said, letting his eyes connect with the crowd. \"I haveweighed this heavily. I have considered honoring the President's desire to keepthis data secret, but I must do what is in my heart.\" Sexton sighed, hanging hishead like a man trapped by history. \"The truth is the truth. I will not presumeto color your interpretation of these facts in any way. I will simply give youthe data at face value.\"In the distance, Sexton heard the beating of huge helicopter rotors. For amoment, he wondered if maybe the President were flying over from the White Housein a panic, hoping to halt the press conference. That would be the icing on thecake, Sexton thought mirthfully. How guilty would Herney appear THEN?\"I do not take pleasure in doing this,\" Sexton continued, sensing his timing wasperfect. \"But I feel it is my duty to let the American people know they havebeen lied to.\"The aircraft thundered in, touching down on the esplanade to their right. WhenSexton glanced over, he was surprised to see it was not the presidentialhelicopter after all, but rather a large Osprey tilt-rotor airplane.The fuselage read: UNITED STATES COAST GUARD.Baffled, Sexton watched as the cabin door opened and a woman emerged. She worean orange Coast Guard parka and looked disheveled, like she'd been through awar. She strode toward the press area. For a moment, Sexton didn't recognizeher. Then it hit him.Rachel? He gaped in shock. What the hell is SHE doing here?A murmur of confusion went through the crowd.Pasting a broad smile on his face, Sexton turned back to the press and raised anapologetic finger. \"If you could give me just one minute? I'm terribly sorry.\"He heaved the weary, good-natured sigh. \"Family first.\"A few of the reporters laughed.With his daughter bearing down fast from his right, Sexton had no doubt thisfather-daughter reunion would best be held in private. Unfortunately, privacywas scarce at the moment. Sexton's eyes darted to the large partition on hisright.Still smiling calmly, Sexton waved to his daughter and stepped away from themicrophone. Moving toward her at an angle, he maneuvered such that Rachel had topass behind the partition to get to him. Sexton met her halfway, hidden from theeyes and ears of the press.\"Honey?\" he said, smiling and opening his arms as Rachel came toward him. \"Whata surprise!\"Rachel walked up and slapped his face.Alone with her father now, ensconced behind the partition, Rachel glared withloathing. She had slapped him hard, but he barely flinched. With chillingcontrol, his phony smile melted away, mutating into an admonishing glower.His voice turned to a demonic whisper. \"You should not be here.\"Rachel saw wrath in his eyes and for the first time in her life felt unafraid.\"I turned to you for help, and you sold me out! I was almost killed!\"\"You're obviously fine.\" His tone was almost disappointed.\"NASA is innocent!\" she said. \"The President told you that! What are you doinghere?\" Rachel's short flight to Washington aboard the Coast Guard Osprey hadbeen punctuated by a flurry of phone calls between herself, the White House, herfather, and even a distraught Gabrielle Ashe. \"You promised Zach Herney you weregoing to the White House!\"\"I am.\" He smirked. \"On election day.\"Rachel felt sickened to think this man was her father. \"What you're about to dois madness.\"\"Oh?\" Sexton chuckled. He turned and motioned behind him to the podium, whichwas visible at the end of the partition. On the podium, a stack of whiteenvelopes sat waiting. \"Those envelopes contain information you sent me, Rachel.You. The President's blood is on your hands.\"\"I faxed you that information when I needed your help! When I thought thePresident and NASA were guilty!\"\"Considering the evidence, NASA certainly appears guilty.\"\"But they are not! They deserve a chance to admit their own mistakes. You'vealready won this election. Zach Herney is finished! You know that. Let the manretain some dignity.\"Sexton groaned. \"So naïve. It's not about winning the election, Rachel, it'sabout power. It's about decisive victory, acts of greatness, crushingopposition, and controlling the forces in Washington so you can get somethingdone.\"\"At what cost?\"\"Don't be so self-righteous. I'm simply presenting the evidence. The people candraw their own conclusions as to who is guilty.\"\"You know how this will look.\"He shrugged. \"Maybe NASA's time has come.\"Senator Sexton sensed the press was getting restless beyond the partition, andhe had no intention of standing here all morning and being lectured by hisdaughter. His moment of glory was waiting.\"We're through here,\" he said. \"I have a press conference to give.\"\"I'm asking you as your daughter,\" Rachel pleaded. \"Don't do this. Think aboutwhat you're about to do. There's a better way.\"\"Not for me.\"A howl of feedback echoed out of the PA system behind him, and Sexton wheeled tosee a late-arriving female reporter, huddled over his podium, attempting toattach a network microphone to one of the goose-neck clips.Why can't these idiots arrive on time? Sexton fumed.In her haste, the reporter knocked Sexton's stack of envelopes to the ground.Goddamn it! Sexton marched over, cursing his daughter for distracting him. Whenhe arrived, the woman was on her hands and knees, collecting the envelopes offthe ground. Sexton couldn't see her face, but she was obviously \"network\" –wearing a full-length cashmere coat, matching scarf, and low-slung mohair beretwith an ABC press pass clipped to it.Stupid bitch, Sexton thought. \"I'll take those,\" he snapped, holding out hishand for the envelopes.The woman scraped up the last of the envelopes and handed them up to Sextonwithout looking up. \"Sorry...,\" she muttered, obviously embarrassed. Hunkeringlow in shame, she scurried off into the crowd.Sexton quickly counted the envelopes. Ten. Good. Nobody was going to steal histhunder today. Regrouping, he adjusted the microphones and gave a joking smileto the crowd. \"I guess I'd better hand these out before someone gets hurt!\"The crowd laughed, looking eager.Sexton sensed his daughter nearby, standing just off-stage behind the partition.\"Don't do this,\" Rachel said to him. \"You'll regret it.\"Sexton ignored her.\"I'm asking you to trust me,\" Rachel said, her voice growing louder. \"It's amistake.\"Sexton picked up his envelopes, straightening the edges.\"Dad,\" Rachel said, intense and pleading now. \"This is your last chance to dowhat's right.\"Do what's right? Sexton covered the microphone and turned as if clearing histhroat. He glanced discreetly over at his daughter. \"You're just like yourmother – idealistic and small. Women simply do not understand the true nature ofpower.\"Sedgewick Sexton had already forgotten his daughter by the time he turned backtoward the jostling media. Head held high, he walked around the podium andhanded the stack of envelopes into the hands of the waiting press. He watchedthe envelopes disseminate rapidly through the crowd. He could hear the sealsbeing broken, the envelopes being torn apart like Christmas presents.A sudden hush came over the crowd.In the silence, Sexton could hear the defining moment of his career.The meteorite is a fraud. And I am the man who revealed it.Sexton knew it would take the press a moment to understand the true implicationsof what they were looking at: GPR images of an insertion shaft in the ice; aliving ocean species almost identical to the NASA fossils; evidence ofchondrules that formed on earth. It all led to one shocking conclusion.\"Sir?\" one reporter stammered, sounding stunned as he looked in his envelope.\"Is this for real?\"Sexton gave a somber sigh. \"Yes, I'm afraid it's very real indeed.\"Murmurs of confusion now spread through the crowd.\"I'll give everyone a moment to look through these pages,\" Sexton said, \"andthen I'll take questions and attempt to shed some light on what you're lookingat.\"\"Senator?\" another reporter asked, sounding utterly bewildered. \"Are theseimages authentic?... Unretouched?\"\"One hundred percent,\" Sexton said, speaking more firmly now. \"I would notpresent the evidence to you otherwise.\"The confusion in the crowd seemed to deepen, and Sexton thought he even heardsome laughter – not at all the reaction he had expected. He was starting to fearhe had overestimated the media's ability to connect the obvious dots.\"Um, senator?\" someone said, sounding oddly amused. \"For the record, you standbehind the authenticity of these images?\"Sexton was getting frustrated. \"My friends, I will say this one last time, theevidence in your hands is one-hundred-percent accurate. And if anyone can proveotherwise, I'll eat my hat!\"Sexton waited for the laugh, but it never came.Dead silence. Blank stares.The reporter who had just spoken walked toward Sexton, shuffling through hisphotocopies as he came forward. \"You're right, senator. This is scandalousdata.\" The reporter paused, scratching his head. \"So I guess we're puzzled as towhy you've decided to share it with us like this, especially after denying it sovehemently earlier.\"Sexton had no idea what the man was talking about. The reporter handed him thephotocopies. Sexton looked at the pages – and for a moment, his mind wenttotally blank.No words came.He was staring at unfamiliar photographs. Black-and-white images. Two people.Naked. Arms and legs intertwined. For an instant, Sexton had no idea what he waslooking at. Then it registered. A cannonball to the gut.In horror, Sexton's head snapped up to the crowd. They were laughing now. Halfof them were already phoning in the story to their news desks.Sexton felt a tap on his shoulder.In a daze, he wheeled.Rachel was standing there. \"We tried to stop you,\" she said. \"We gave you everychance.\" A woman stood beside her.Sexton was trembling as his eyes moved to the woman at Rachel's side. She wasthe reporter in the cashmere coat and mohair beret – the woman who had knockedover his envelopes. Sexton saw her face, and his blood turned to ice.Gabrielle's dark eyes seemed to bore right through him as she reached down andopened her coat to reveal a stack of white envelopes tucked neatly beneath herarm.132The Oval Office was dark, lit only by the soft glow of the brass lamp onPresident Herney's desk. Gabrielle Ashe held her chin high as she stood beforethe President. Outside the window behind him, dusk was gathering on the westlawn.\"I hear you're leaving us,\" Herney said, sounding disappointed.Gabrielle nodded. Although the President had graciously offered her indefinitesanctuary inside the White House away from the press, Gabrielle preferred not toride out this particular storm by hiding out in the eye. She wanted to be as faraway as possible. At least for a while.Herney gazed across his desk at her, looking impressed. \"The choice you madethis morning, Gabrielle...\" He paused, as if at a loss for words. His eyes weresimple and clear – nothing compared to the deep, enigmatic pools that had oncedrawn Gabrielle to Sedgewick Sexton. And yet, even in the backdrop of thispowerful place, Gabrielle saw true kindness in his gaze, an honor and dignityshe would not soon forget.\"I did it for me, too,\" Gabrielle finally said.Herney nodded. \"I owe you my thanks all the same.\" He stood, motioning for herto follow him into the hall. \"I was actually hoping you'd stick around longenough that I could offer you a post on my budgeting staff.\"Gabrielle gave him a dubious look. \"Stop spending and start mending?\"He chuckled. \"Something like that.\"\"I think we both know, sir, that I'm more of a liability to you at the momentthan an asset.\"Herney shrugged. \"Give it a few months. It will all blow over. Plenty of greatmen and women have endured similar situations and gone on to greatness.\" Hewinked. \"A few of them were even U.S. presidents.\"Gabrielle knew he was right. Unemployed for only hours, Gabrielle had alreadyturned down two other job offers today – one from Yolanda Cole at ABC, and theother from St. Martin's Press, who had offered her an obscene advance if shewould publish a tell-all biography. No thanks.As Gabrielle and the President moved down the hallway, Gabrielle thought of thepictures of herself that were now being splashed across televisions.The damage to the country could have been worse, she told herself. Much worse.Gabrielle, after going to ABC to retrieve the photos and borrow Yolanda Cole'spress pass, had snuck back to Sexton's office to assemble the duplicateenvelopes. While inside, she had also printed copies of the donation checks inSexton's computer. After the confrontation at the Washington Monument, Gabriellehad handed copies of the checks to the dumbstruck Senator Sexton and made herdemands. Give the President a chance to announce his meteorite mistake, or therest of this data goes public too. Senator Sexton took one look at the stack offinancial evidence, locked himself in his limousine, and drove off. He had notbeen heard from since.Now, as the President and Gabrielle arrived at the backstage door of theBriefing Room, Gabrielle could hear the waiting throngs beyond. For the secondtime in twenty-four hours, the world was assembled to hear a specialpresidential broadcast.\"What are you going to tell them?\" Gabrielle asked.Herney sighed, his expression remarkably calm. \"Over the years, I've learned onething over and over...\" He put a hand on her shoulder and smiled. \"There's justno substitute for the truth.\"Gabrielle was filled with an unexpected pride as she watched him stride towardthe stage. Zach Herney was on his way to admit the biggest mistake of his life,and oddly, he had never looked more presidential.133When Rachel awoke, the room was dark.A clock glowed 10:14 P.M. The bed was not her own. For several moments, she laymotionless, wondering where she was. Slowly, it all started coming back... themegaplume... this morning at the Washington Monument... the President'sinvitation to stay at the White House.I'm at the White House, Rachel realized. I slept here all day.The Coast Guard chopper, at the President's command, had transported anexhausted Michael Tolland, Corky Marlinson, and Rachel Sexton from theWashington Monument to the White House, where they had been fed a sumptuousbreakfast, been seen to by doctors, and been offered any of the building'sfourteen bedrooms in which to recuperate.All of them had accepted.Rachel could not believe she had slept this long. Turning on the television, shewas stunned to see that President Herney had already completed his pressconference. Rachel and the others had offered to stand beside him when heannounced the meteorite disappointment to the world. We all made the mistaketogether. But Herney had insisted on shouldering the burden alone.\"Sadly,\" one political analyst on TV was saying, \"it seems NASA has discoveredno signs of life from space after all. This marks the second time this decadethat NASA has incorrectly classified a meteorite as showing signs ofextraterrestrial life. This time, however, a number of highly respectedcivilians were also among those fooled.\"\"Normally,\" a second analyst chimed in, \"I would have to say that a deception ofthe magnitude the President described this evening would be devastating for hiscareer... and yet, considering the developments this morning at the WashingtonMonument, I would have to say Zach Herney's chances of taking the presidencylook better than ever.\"The first analyst nodded. \"So, no life in space, but no life in Senator Sexton'scampaign either. And now, as new information surfaces suggesting deep financialtroubles plaguing the senator –\"A knock on the door drew Rachel's attention.Michael, she hoped, quickly turning off the television. She hadn't seen himsince breakfast. On their arrival at the White House, Rachel had wanted nothingmore than to fall asleep in his arms. Although she could tell Michael felt thesame, Corky had intervened, parking himself on Tolland's bed and exuberantlytelling and retelling his story about urinating on himself and saving the day.Finally, utterly exhausted, Rachel and Tolland had given up, heading forseparate bedrooms to sleep.Now, walking toward the door, Rachel checked herself in the mirror, amused tosee how ridiculously she was dressed. All she had found to wear to bed was anold Penn State football jersey in the dresser. It draped down to her knees likea nightshirt.The knocking continued.Rachel opened the door, disappointed to see a female U.S. Secret Service agent.She was fit and cute, wearing a blue blazer. \"Ms. Sexton, the gentleman in theLincoln Bedroom heard your television. He asked me to tell you that as long asyou're already awake...\" She paused, arching her eyebrows, clearly no strangerto night games on the upper floors of the White House.Rachel blushed, her skin tingling. \"Thanks.\"The agent led Rachel down the impeccably appointed hallway to a plain-lookingdoorway nearby.\"The Lincoln Bedroom,\" the agent said. \"And as I am always supposed to sayoutside this door, 'Sleep well, and beware of ghosts.'\"Rachel nodded. The legends of ghosts in the Lincoln Bedroom were as old as theWhite House itself. It was said that Winston Churchill had seen Lincoln's ghosthere, as had countless others, including Eleanor Roosevelt, Amy Carter, actorRichard Dreyfuss, and decades of maids and butlers. President Reagan's dog wassaid to bark outside this door for hours at a time.The thoughts of historical spirits suddenly made Rachel realize what a sacredplace this room was. She felt suddenly embarrassed, standing there in her longfootball jersey, bare-legged, like some college coed sneaking into a boy's room.\"Is this kosher?\" she whispered to the agent. \"I mean this is the LincolnBedroom.\"The agent winked. \"Our policy on this floor is 'Don't ask, don't tell.'\"Rachel smiled. \"Thanks.\" She reached for the door-knob, already feeling theanticipation of what lay beyond.\"Rachel!\" The nasal voice carried down the hallway like a buzz saw.Rachel and the agent turned. Corky Marlinson was hobbling toward them oncrutches, his leg now professionally bandaged. \"I couldn't sleep either!\"Rachel slumped, sensing her romantic tryst about to disintegrate.Corky's eyes inspected the cute Secret Service agent. He flashed her a broadsmile. \"I love women in uniform.\"The agent pulled aside her blazer to reveal a lethal-looking sidearm.Corky backed off. \"Point taken.\" He turned to Rachel. \"Is Mike awake, too? Yougoing in?\" Corky looked eager to join the party.Rachel groaned. \"Actually, Corky...\"\"Dr. Marlinson,\" the Secret Service agent intervened, pulling a note from herblazer. \"According to this note, which was given to me by Mr. Tolland, I haveexplicit orders to escort you down to the kitchen, have our chef make youanything you want, and ask you to explain to me in vivid detail how you savedyourself from certain death by...\" the agent hesitated, grimacing as she readthe note again. \"... by urinating on yourself?\"Apparently, the agent had said the magic words. Corky dropped his crutches onthe spot and put an arm around the woman's shoulders for support, and said, \"Tothe kitchen, love!\"As the indisposed agent helped Corky hobble off down the hall, Rachel had nodoubt Corky Marlinson was in heaven. \"The urine is the key,\" she heard himsaying, \"because those damned telencephalon olfactory lobes can smelleverything!\"The Lincoln Bedroom was dark when Rachel entered. She was surprised to see thebed empty and untouched. Michael Tolland was nowhere to be seen.An antique oil lamp burned near the bed, and in the soft radiance, she couldbarely make out the Brussels carpet... the famous carved rosewood bed... theportrait of Lincoln's wife, Mary Todd... even the desk where Lincoln signed theEmancipation Proclamation.As Rachel closed the door behind her, she felt a clammy draft on her bare legs.Where is he? Across the room, a window was open, the white organza curtainsbillowing. She walked over to close the window, and an eerie whisper murmuredfrom the closet.\"Maaaarrrrrrrry...\"Rachel wheeled.\"Maaaaaarrrrrrrry?\" the voice whispered again. \"Is that you?... Mary ToddLiiiiiincoln?\"Rachel quickly closed the window and turned back toward the closet. Her heartwas racing, although she knew it was foolish. \"Mike, I know that's you.\"\"Noooooo...\" the voice continued. \"I am not Mike... I am... Aaaaabe.\"Rachel put her hands on her hips. \"Oh, really? Honest Abe?\"A muffled laugh. \"Moderately honest Abe... yes.\"Rachel was laughing now too.\"Be afraaaaaaid,\" the voice from the closet moaned. \"Be veeeeeery afraid.\"\"I'm not afraid.\"\"Please be afraid...\" the voice moaned. \"In the human species, the emotions offear and sexual arousal are closely linked.\"Rachel burst out laughing. \"Is this your idea of a turn-on?\"\"Forgiiiive me...\" the voice moaned. \"It's been yeeeeeeears since I've been witha woman.\"\"Evidently,\" Rachel said, yanking the door open.Michael Tolland stood before her with his roguish, lopsided grin. He lookedirresistible wearing a pair of navy blue satin pajamas. Rachel did a double takewhen she saw the presidential seal emblazoned on his chest.\"Presidential pajamas?\"He shrugged. \"They were in the drawer.\"\"And all I had was this football jersey?\"\"You should have chosen the Lincoln Bedroom.\"\"You should have offered!\"\"I heard the mattress was bad. Antique horsehair.\" Tolland winked, motioning toa gift-wrapped package on a marble-topped table. \"This'll make it up to you.\"Rachel was touched. \"For me?\"\"I had one of the presidential aides go out and find this for you. Just arrived.Don't shake it.\"She carefully opened the package, extracting the heavy contents. Inside was alarge crystal bowl in which were swimming two ugly orange goldfish. Rachelstared in confused disappointment. \"You're joking, right?\"\"Helostoma temmincki,\" Tolland said proudly.\"You bought me fish?\"\"Rare Chinese kissing fish. Very romantic.\"\"Fish are not romantic, Mike.\"\"Tell that to these guys. They'll kiss for hours.\"\"Is this supposed to be another turn-on?\"\"I'm rusty on the romance. Can you grade me on effort?\"\"For future reference, Mike, fish are definitely not a turn-on. Try flowers.\"Tolland pulled a bouquet of white lilies from behind his back. \"I tried for redroses,\" he said, \"but I almost got shot sneaking into the Rose Garden.\"As Tolland pulled Rachel's body against his and inhaled the soft fragrance ofher hair, he felt years of quiet isolation dissolving inside him. He kissed herdeeply, feeling her body rise against him. The white lilies fell to their feet,and barriers Tolland had never known he'd built were suddenly melting away.The ghosts are gone.He felt Rachel inching him toward the bed now, her whisper soft in his ear. \"Youdon't really think fish are romantic, do you?\"\"I do,\" he said, kissing her again. \"You should see the jellyfish mating ritual.Incredibly erotic.\"Rachel maneuvered him onto his back on the horsehair mattress, easing herslender body down on top of his.\"And seahorses...,\" Tolland said, breathless as he savored her touch through thethin satin of his pajamas. \"Seahorses perform... an unbelievably sensual danceof love.\"\"Enough fish talk,\" she whispered, unbuttoning his pajamas. \"What can you tellme about the mating rituals of advanced primates?\"Tolland sighed. \"I'm afraid I don't really do primates.\"Rachel shed her football jersey. \"Well, nature boy, I suggest you learn fast.\"EPILOGUEThe NASA transport jet banked high over the Atlantic.Onboard, Administrator Lawrence Ekstrom took a last look at the huge charredrock in the cargo hold. Back to the sea, he thought. Where they found you.On Ekstrom's command, the pilot opened the cargo doors and released the rock.They watched as the mammoth stone plummeted downward behind the plane, arcingacross the sunlit ocean sky and disappearing beneath the waves in a pillar ofsilver spray.The giant stone sank fast.Underwater, at three hundred feet, barely enough light remained to reveal itstumbling silhouette. Passing five hundred feet, the rock plunged into totaldarkness.Racing down.Deeper.It fell for almost twelve minutes.Then, like a meteorite striking the dark side of the moon, the rock crashed intoa vast plain of mud on the ocean floor, kicking up a cloud of silt. As the dustsettled, one of the ocean's thousands of unknown species swam over to inspectthe odd newcomer.Unimpressed, the creature moved on."}]
