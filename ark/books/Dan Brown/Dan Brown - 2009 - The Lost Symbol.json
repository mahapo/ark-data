The skull was hollow, like a bowl, filled with bloodred wine.Drink it, he told himself. You have nothing to fear.As was tradition, he had begun this journey adorned in the ritualistic garb of amedieval heretic being led to the gallows, his loose-fitting shirt gaping opento reveal his pale chest, his left pant leg rolled up to the knee, and his rightsleeve rolled up to the elbow. Around his neck hung a heavy rope noose—a“cable-tow” as the brethren called it. Tonight, however, like the brethrenbearing witness, he was dressed as a master.The assembly of brothers encircling him all were adorned in their full regaliaof lambskin aprons, sashes, and white gloves. Around their necks hung ceremonialjewels that glistened like ghostly eyes in the muted light. Many of these menheld powerful stations in life, and yet the initiate knew their worldly ranksmeant nothing within these walls. Here all men were equals, sworn brotherssharing a mystical bond.As he surveyed the daunting assembly, the initiate wondered who on the outsidewould ever believe that this collection of men would assemble in one place . . .much less this place. The room looked like a holy sanctuary from the ancientworld.The truth, however, was stranger still.I am just blocks away from the White House.This colossal edifice, located at 1733 Sixteenth Street NW in Washington, D.C.,was a replica of a pre-Christian temple—the temple of King Mausolus, theoriginal mausoleum . . . a place to be taken after death. Outside the mainentrance, two seventeen-ton sphinxes guarded the bronze doors. The interior wasan ornate labyrinth of ritualistic chambers, halls, sealed vaults, libraries,and even a hollow wall that held the remains of two human bodies. The initiatehad been told every room in this building held a secret, and yet he knew no roomheld deeper secrets than the gigantic chamber in which he was currently kneelingwith a skull cradled in his palms.The Temple Room.This room was a perfect square. And cavernous. The ceiling soared an astonishingone hundred feet overhead, supported by monolithic columns of green granite. Atiered gallery of dark Russian walnut seats with hand-tooled pigskin encircledthe room. A thirty-three-foot-tall throne dominated the western wall, with aconcealed pipe organ opposite it. The walls were a kaleidoscope of ancientsymbols . . . Egyptian, Hebraic, astronomical, alchemical, and others yetunknown.Tonight, the Temple Room was lit by a series of precisely arranged candles.Their dim glow was aided only by a pale shaft of moonlight that filtered downthrough the expansive oculus in the ceiling and illuminated the room's moststartling feature—an enormous altar hewn from a solid block of polished Belgianblack marble, situated dead center of the square chamber.The secret is how to die, the initiate reminded himself.“It is time,” a voice whispered.The initiate let his gaze climb the distinguished white-robed figure standingbefore him. The Supreme Worshipful Master. The man, in his late fifties, was anAmerican icon, well loved, robust, and incalculably wealthy. His once-dark hairwas turning silver, and his famous visage reflected a lifetime of power and avigorous intellect.“Take the oath,” the Worshipful Master said, his voice soft like falling snow.“Complete your journey.”The initiate's journey, like all such journeys, had begun at the first degree.On that night, in a ritual similar to this one, the Worshipful Master hadblindfolded him with a velvet hoodwink and pressed a ceremonial dagger to hisbare chest, demanding: “Do you seriously declare on your honor, uninfluenced bymercenary or any other unworthy motive, that you freely and voluntarily offeryourself as a candidate for the mysteries and privileges of this brotherhood?”“I do,” the initiate had lied.“Then let this be a sting to your consciousness,” the master had warned him, “aswell as instant death should you ever betray the secrets to be imparted to you.”At the time, the initiate had felt no fear. They will never know my true purposehere.Tonight, however, he sensed a foreboding solemnity in the Temple Room, and hismind began replaying all the dire warnings he had been given on his journey,threats of terrible consequences if he ever shared the ancient secrets he wasabout to learn: Throat cut from ear to ear . . . tongue torn out by its roots .. . bowels taken out and burned . . . scattered to the four winds of heaven . .. heart plucked out and given to the beasts of the field—“Brother,” the gray-eyed master said, placing his left hand on the initiate'sshoulder. “Take the final oath.”Steeling himself for the last step of his journey, the initiate shifted hismuscular frame and turned his attention back to the skull cradled in his palms.The crimson wine looked almost black in the dim candlelight. The chamber hadfallen deathly silent, and he could feel all of the witnesses watching him,waiting for him to take his final oath and join their elite ranks.Tonight, he thought, something is taking place within these walls that has neverbefore occurred in the history of this brotherhood. Not once, in centuries.He knew it would be the spark . . . and it would give him unfathomable power.Energized, he drew a breath and spoke aloud the same words that countless menhad spoken before him in countries all over the world.“May this wine I now drink become a deadly poison to me . . . should I everknowingly or willfully violate my oath.”His words echoed in the hollow space.Then all was quiet.Steadying his hands, the initiate raised the skull to his mouth and felt hislips touch the dry bone. He closed his eyes and tipped the skull toward hismouth, drinking the wine in long, deep swallows. When the last drop was gone, helowered the skull.For an instant, he thought he felt his lungs growing tight, and his heart beganto pound wildly. My God, they know! Then, as quickly as it came, the feelingpassed.A pleasant warmth began to stream through his body. The initiate exhaled,smiling inwardly as he gazed up at the unsuspecting gray-eyed man who hadfoolishly admitted him into this brotherhood's most secretive ranks.Soon you will lose everything you hold most dear."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1The Otis elevator climbing the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower was overflowingwith tourists. Inside the cramped lift, an austere businessman in a pressed suitgazed down at the boy beside him. “You look pale, son. You should have stayed onthe ground.”“I’m okay . . .” the boy answered, struggling to control his anxiety. “I’ll getout on the next level.” I can’t breathe.The man leaned closer. “I thought by now you would have gotten over this.” Hebrushed the child’s cheek affectionately.The boy felt ashamed to disappoint his father, but he could barely hear throughthe ringing in his ears. I can’t breathe. I’ve got to get out of this box!The elevator operator was saying something reassuring about the lift’sarticulated pistons and puddled-iron construction. Far beneath them, the streetsof Paris stretched out in all directions.Almost there, the boy told himself, craning his neck and looking up at theunloading platform. Just hold on.As the lift angled steeply toward the upper viewing deck, the shaft began tonarrow, its massive struts contracting into a tight, vertical tunnel.“Dad, I don’t think—”Suddenly a staccato crack echoed overhead. The carriage jerked, swayingawkwardly to one side. Frayed cables began whipping around the carriage,thrashing like snakes. The boy reached out for his father.“Dad!”Their eyes locked for one terrifying second.Then the bottom dropped out.Robert Langdon jolted upright in his soft leather seat, startling out of thesemiconscious daydream. He was sitting all alone in the enormous cabin of aFalcon 2000EX corporate jet as it bounced its way through turbulence. In thebackground, the dual Pratt & Whitney engines hummed evenly.“Mr. Langdon?” The intercom crackled overhead. “We’re on final approach.”Langdon sat up straight and slid his lecture notes back into his leather daybag.He’d been halfway through reviewing Masonic symbology when his mind had drifted.The daydream about his late father, Langdon suspected, had been stirred by thismorning’s unexpected invitation from Langdon’s longtime mentor, Peter Solomon.The other man I never want to disappoint.The fifty-eight-year-old philanthropist, historian, and scientist had takenLangdon under his wing nearly thirty years ago, in many ways filling the voidleft by Langdon’s father’s death. Despite the man’s influential family dynastyand massive wealth, Langdon had found humility and warmth in Solomon’s soft grayeyes.Outside the window the sun had set, but Langdon could still make out the slendersilhouette of the world’s largest obelisk, rising on the horizon like the spireof an ancient gnomon. The 555-foot marble-faced obelisk marked this nation’sheart. All around the spire, the meticulous geometry of streets and monumentsradiated outward.Even from the air, Washington, D.C., exuded an almost mystical power.Langdon loved this city, and as the jet touched down, he felt a risingexcitement about what lay ahead. The jet taxied to a private terminal somewherein the vast expanse of Dulles International Airport and came to a stop.Langdon gathered his things, thanked the pilots, and stepped out of the jet’sluxurious interior onto the foldout staircase. The cold January air feltliberating.Breathe, Robert, he thought, appreciating the wide-open spaces.A blanket of white fog crept across the runway, and Langdon had the sensation hewas stepping into a marsh as he descended onto the misty tarmac.“Hello! Hello!” a singsong British voice shouted from across the tarmac.“Professor Langdon?”Langdon looked up to see a middle-aged woman with a badge and clipboard hurryingtoward him, waving happily as he approached. Curly blond hair protruded fromunder a stylish knit wool hat.“Welcome to Washington, sir!”Langdon smiled. “Thank you.”“My name is Pam, from passenger services.” The woman spoke with an exuberancethat was almost unsettling. “If you’ll come with me, sir, your car is waiting.”Langdon followed her across the runway toward the Signature terminal, which wassurrounded by glistening private jets. A taxi stand for the rich and famous.“I hate to embarrass you, Professor,” the woman said, sounding sheepish, “butyou are the Robert Langdon who writes books about symbols and religion, aren’tyou?”Langdon hesitated and then nodded.“I thought so!” she said, beaming. “My book group read your book about thesacred feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You doenjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!”Langdon smiled. “Scandal wasn’t really my intention.”The woman seemed to sense Langdon was not in the mood to discuss his work. “I’msorry. Listen to me rattling on. I know you probably get tired of beingrecognized . . . but it’s your own fault.” She playfully motioned to hisclothing. “Your uniform gave you away.”My uniform? Langdon glanced down at his attire. He was wearing his usualcharcoal turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovanloafers . . . his standard attire for the classroom, lecture circuit, authorphotos, and social events.The woman laughed. “Those turtlenecks you wear are so dated. You’d look muchsharper in a tie!”No chance, Langdon thought. Little nooses.Neckties had been required six days a week when Langdon attended Phillips ExeterAcademy, and despite the headmaster’s romantic claims that the origin of thecravat went back to the silk fascalia worn by Roman orators to warm their vocalcords, Langdon knew that, etymologically, cravat actually derived from aruthless band of “Croat” mercenaries who donned knotted neckerchiefs before theystormed into battle. To this day, this ancient battle garb was donned by modernoffice warriors hoping to intimidate their enemies in daily boardroom battles.“Thanks for the advice,” Langdon said with a chuckle. “I’ll consider a tie inthe future.”Mercifully, a professional-looking man in a dark suit got out of a sleek LincolnTown Car parked near the terminal and held up his finger. “Mr. Langdon? I’mCharles with Beltway Limousine.” He opened the passenger door. “Good evening,sir. Welcome to Washington.”Langdon tipped Pam for her hospitality and then climbed into the plush interiorof the Town Car. The driver showed him the temperature controls, the bottledwater, and the basket of hot muffins. Seconds later, Langdon was speeding awayon a private access road. So this is how the other half lives.As the driver gunned the car up Windsock Drive, he consulted his passengermanifest and placed a quick call. “This is Beltway Limousine,” the driver saidwith professional efficiency. “I was asked to confirm once my passenger hadlanded.” He paused. “Yes, sir. Your guest, Mr. Langdon, has arrived, and I willdeliver him to the Capitol Building by seven P.M. You’re welcome, sir.” He hungup.Langdon had to smile. No stone left unturned. Peter Solomon’s attention todetail was one of his most potent assets, allowing him to manage his substantialpower with apparent ease. A few billion dollars in the bank doesn’t hurt either.Langdon settled into the plush leather seat and closed his eyes as the noise ofthe airport faded behind him. The U.S. Capitol was a half hour away, and heappreciated the time alone to gather his thoughts. Everything had happened soquickly today that Langdon only now had begun to think in earnest about theincredible evening that lay ahead.Arriving under a veil of secrecy, Langdon thought, amused by the prospect.Ten miles from the Capitol Building, a lone figure was eagerly preparing forRobert Langdon’s arrival."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2The one who called himself Mal’akh pressed the tip of the needle against hisshaved head, sighing with pleasure as the sharp tool plunged in and out of hisflesh. The soft hum of the electric device was addictive . . . as was the biteof the needle sliding deep into his dermis and depositing its dye.I am a masterpiece.The goal of tattooing was never beauty. The goal was change. From the scarifiedNubian priests of 2000 B.C., to the tattooed acolytes of the Cybele cult ofancient Rome, to the moko scars of the modern Maori, humans have tattooedthemselves as a way of offering up their bodies in partial sacrifice, enduringthe physical pain of embellishment and emerging changed beings.Despite the ominous admonitions of Leviticus 19:28, which forbade the marking ofone’s flesh, tattoos had become a rite of passage shared by millions of peoplein the modern age—everyone from clean-cut teenagers to hard-core drug users tosuburban housewives.The act of tattooing one’s skin was a transformative declaration of power, anannouncement to the world: I am in control of my own flesh. The intoxicatingfeeling of control derived from physical transformation had addicted millions toflesh-altering practices . . . cosmetic surgery, body piercing, bodybuilding,and steroids . . . even bulimia and transgendering. The human spirit cravesmastery over its carnal shell.A single bell chimed on Mal’akh’s grandfather clock, and he looked up. Sixthirty P.M. Leaving his tools, he wrapped the Kiryu silk robe around his naked,six-foot-three body and strode down the hall. The air inside this sprawlingmansion was heavy with the pungent fragrance of his skin dyes and smoke from thebeeswax candles he used to sterilize his needles. The towering young man moveddown the corridor past priceless Italian antiques—a Piranesi etching, aSavonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.He glanced through a floor-to-ceiling window as he passed, admiring theclassical skyline in the distance. The luminous dome of the U.S. Capitol glowedwith solemn power against the dark winter sky.This is where it is hidden, he thought. It is buried out there somewhere.Few men knew it existed . . . and even fewer knew its awesome power or theingenious way in which it had been hidden. To this day, it remained thiscountry’s greatest untold secret. Those few who did know the truth kept ithidden behind a veil of symbols, legends, and allegory.Now they have opened their doors to me, Mal’akh thought.Three weeks ago, in a dark ritual witnessed by America’s most influential men,Mal’akh had ascended to the thirty-third degree, the highest echelon of theworld’s oldest surviving brotherhood. Despite Mal’akh’s new rank, the brethrenhad told him nothing. Nor will they, he knew. That was not how it worked. Therewere circles within circles . . . brotherhoods within brotherhoods. Even ifMal’akh waited years, he might never earn their ultimate trust.Fortunately, he did not need their trust to obtain their deepest secret.My initiation served its purpose.Now, energized by what lay ahead, he strode toward his bedroom. Throughout hisentire home, audio speakers broadcast the eerie strains of a rare recording of acastrato singing the “Lux Aeterna” from the Verdi Requiem—a reminder of aprevious life. Mal’akh touched a remote control to bring on the thundering “DiesIrae.” Then, against a backdrop of crashing timpani and parallel fifths, hebounded up the marble staircase, his robe billowing as he ascended on sinewylegs.As he ran, his empty stomach growled in protest. For two days now, Mal’akh hadfasted, consuming only water, preparing his body in accordance with the ancientways. Your hunger will be satisfied by dawn, he reminded himself. Along withyour pain.Mal’akh entered his bedroom sanctuary with reverence, locking the door behindhim. As he moved toward his dressing area, he paused, feeling himself drawn tothe enormous gilded mirror. Unable to resist, he turned and faced his ownreflection. Slowly, as if unwrapping a priceless gift, Mal’akh opened his robeto unveil his naked form. The vision awed him.I am a masterpiece.His massive body was shaved and smooth. He lowered his gaze first to his feet,which were tattooed with the scales and talons of a hawk. Above that, hismuscular legs were tattooed as carved pillars—his left leg spiraled and hisright vertically striated. Boaz and Jachin. His groin and abdomen formed adecorated archway, above which his powerful chest was emblazoned with thedouble-headed phoenix . . . each head in profile with its visible eye formed byone of Mal’akh’s nipples. His shoulders, neck, face, and shaved head werecompletely covered with an intricate tapestry of ancient symbols and sigils.I am an artifact . . . an evolving icon.One mortal man had seen Mal’akh naked, eighteen hours earlier. The man hadshouted in fear. “Good God, you’re a demon!”“If you perceive me as such,” Mal’akh had replied, understanding as had theancients that angels and demons were identical—interchangeable archetypes—all amatter of polarity: the guardian angel who conquered your enemy in battle wasperceived by your enemy as a demon destroyer.Mal’akh tipped his face down now and got an oblique view of the top of his head.There, within the crownlike halo, shone a small circle of pale, untattooedflesh. This carefully guarded canvas was Mal’akh’s only remaining piece ofvirgin skin. The sacred space had waited patiently . . . and tonight, it wouldbe filled. Although Mal’akh did not yet possess what he required to complete hismasterpiece, he knew the moment was fast approaching.Exhilarated by his reflection, he could already feel his power growing. Heclosed his robe and walked to the window, again gazing out at the mystical citybefore him. It is buried out there somewhere.Refocusing on the task at hand, Mal’akh went to his dressing table and carefullyapplied a base of concealer makeup to his face, scalp, and neck until histattoos had disappeared. Then he donned the special set of clothing and otheritems he had meticulously prepared for this evening. When he finished, hechecked himself in the mirror. Satisfied, he ran a soft palm across his smoothscalp and smiled.It is out there, he thought. And tonight, one man will help me find it.As Mal’akh exited his home, he prepared himself for the event that would soonshake the U.S. Capitol Building. He had gone to enormous lengths to arrange allthe pieces for tonight.And now, at last, his final pawn had entered the game."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3Robert Langdon was busy reviewing his note cards when the hum of the Town Car’stires changed pitch on the road beneath him. Langdon glanced up, surprised tosee where they were.Memorial Bridge already?He put down his notes and gazed out at the calm waters of the Potomac passingbeneath him. A heavy mist hovered on the surface. Aptly named, Foggy Bottom hadalways seemed a peculiar site on which to build the nation’s capital. Of all theplaces in the New World, the forefathers had chosen a soggy riverside marsh onwhich to lay the cornerstone of their utopian society.Langdon gazed left, across the Tidal Basin, toward the gracefully roundedsilhouette of the Jefferson Memorial—America’s Pantheon, as many called it.Directly in front of the car, the Lincoln Memorial rose with rigid austerity,its orthogonal lines reminiscent of Athens’s ancient Parthenon. But it wasfarther away that Langdon saw the city’s centerpiece—the same spire he had seenfrom the air. Its architectural inspiration was far, far older than the Romansor the Greeks.America’s Egyptian obelisk.The monolithic spire of the Washington Monument loomed dead ahead, illuminatedagainst the sky like the majestic mast of a ship. From Langdon’s oblique angle,the obelisk appeared ungrounded tonight . . . swaying against the dreary sky asif on an unsteady sea. Langdon felt similarly ungrounded. His visit toWashington had been utterly unexpected. I woke up this morning anticipating aquiet Sunday at home . . . and now I’m a few minutes away from the U.S. Capitol.This morning at four forty-five, Langdon had plunged into dead-calm water,beginning his day as he always did, swimming fifty laps in the deserted HarvardPool. His physique was not quite what it had been in his college days as awater-polo all-American, but he was still lean and toned, respectable for a manin his forties. The only difference now was the amount of effort it took Langdonto keep it that way.When Langdon arrived home around six, he began his morning ritual ofhand-grinding Sumatra coffee beans and savoring the exotic scent that filled hiskitchen. This morning, however, he was surprised to see the blinking red lighton his voice-mail display. Who calls at six A.M. on a Sunday? He pressed thebutton and listened to the message.“Good morning, Professor Langdon, I’m terribly sorry for this early-morningcall.” The polite voice was noticeably hesitant, with a hint of a southernaccent. “My name is Anthony Jelbart, and I’m Peter Solomon’s executiveassistant. Mr. Solomon told me you’re an early riser . . . he has been trying toreach you this morning on short notice. As soon as you receive this message,would you be so kind as to call Peter directly? You probably have his newprivate line, but if not, it’s 202-329-5746.”Langdon felt a sudden concern for his old friend. Peter Solomon was impeccablywell-bred and courteous, and certainly not the kind of man to call at daybreakon a Sunday unless something was very wrong.Langdon left his coffee half made and hurried toward his study to return thecall.I hope he’s okay.Peter Solomon had been a friend, mentor, and, although only twelve yearsLangdon’s senior, a father figure to him ever since their first meeting atPrinceton University. As a sophomore, Langdon had been required to attend anevening guest lecture by the well-known young historian and philanthropist.Solomon had spoken with a contagious passion, presenting a dazzling vision ofsemiotics and archetypal history that had sparked in Langdon what would laterbecome his lifelong passion for symbols. It was not Peter Solomon’s brilliance,however, but the humility in his gentle gray eyes that had given Langdon thecourage to write him a thank-you letter. The young sophomore had never dreamedthat Peter Solomon, one of America’s wealthiest and most intriguing youngintellectuals, would ever write back. But Solomon did. And it had been thebeginning of a truly gratifying friendship.A prominent academic whose quiet manner belied his powerful heritage, PeterSolomon came from the ultrawealthy Solomon family, whose names appeared onbuildings and universities all over the nation. Like the Rothschilds in Europe,the surname Solomon had always carried the mystique of American royalty andsuccess. Peter had inherited the mantle at a young age after the death of hisfather, and now, at fifty-eight, he had held numerous positions of power in hislife. He currently served as the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Langdonoccasionally ribbed Peter that the lone tarnish on his sterling pedigree was hisdiploma from a second-rate university—Yale.Now, as Langdon entered his study, he was surprised to see that he had receiveda fax from Peter as well.Peter SolomonOFFICE OF THE SECRETARYTHE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTIONGood morning, Robert,I need to speak with you at once. Please call me this morning as soon as you canat 202-329-5746.PeterLangdon immediately dialed the number, sitting down at his hand-carved oak deskto wait as the call went through.“Office of Peter Solomon,” the familiar voice of the assistant answered. “Thisis Anthony. May I help you?”“Hello, this is Robert Langdon. You left me a message earlier—”“Yes, Professor Langdon!” The young man sounded relieved. “Thank you for callingback so quickly. Mr. Solomon is eager to speak to you. Let me tell him you’re onthe line. May I put you on hold?”“Of course.”As Langdon waited for Solomon to get on the line, he gazed down at Peter’s nameatop the Smithsonian letterhead and had to smile. Not many slackers in theSolomon clan. Peter’s ancestral tree burgeoned with the names of wealthybusiness magnates, influential politicians, and a number of distinguishedscientists, some even fellows of London’s Royal Society. Solomon’s only livingfamily member, his younger sister, Katherine, had apparently inherited thescience gene, because she was now a leading figure in a new cutting-edgediscipline called Noetic Science.All Greek to me, Langdon thought, amused to recall Katherine’s unsuccessfulattempt to explain Noetic Science to him at a party at her brother’s home lastyear. Langdon had listened carefully and then replied, “Sounds more like magicthan science.”Katherine winked playfully. “They’re closer than you think, Robert.”Now Solomon’s assistant returned to the phone. “I’m sorry, Mr. Solomon is tryingto get off a conference call. Things are a little chaotic here this morning.”“That’s not a problem. I can easily call back.”“Actually, he asked me to fill you in on his reason for contacting you, if youdon’t mind?”“Of course not.”The assistant inhaled deeply. “As you probably know, Professor, every year herein Washington, the board of the Smithsonian hosts a private gala to thank ourmost generous supporters. Many of the country’s cultural elite attend.”Langdon knew his own bank account had too few zeros to qualify him as culturallyelite, but he wondered if maybe Solomon was going to invite him to attendnonetheless.“This year, as is customary,” the assistant continued, “the dinner will bepreceded by a keynote address. We’ve been lucky enough to secure the NationalStatuary Hall for that speech.”The best room in all of D.C., Langdon thought, recalling a political lecture hehad once attended in the dramatic semicircular hall. It was hard to forget fivehundred folding chairs splayed in a perfect arc, surrounded by thirty-eightlife-size statues, in a room that had once served as the nation’s original Houseof Representatives chamber.“The problem is this,” the man said. “Our speaker has fallen ill and has justinformed us she will be unable to give the address.” He paused awkwardly. “Thismeans we are desperate for a replacement speaker. And Mr. Solomon is hoping youwould consider filling in.”Langdon did a double take. “Me?” This was not at all what he had expected. “I’msure Peter could find a far better substitute.”“You’re Mr. Solomon’s first choice, Professor, and you’re being much too modest.The institution’s guests would be thrilled to hear from you, and Mr. Solomonthought you could give the same lecture you gave on Bookspan TV a few yearsback? That way, you wouldn’t have to prepare a thing. He said your talk involvedsymbolism in the architecture of our nation’s capital—it sounds absolutelyperfect for the venue.”Langdon was not so sure. “If I recall, that lecture had more to do with theMasonic history of the building than—”“Exactly! As you know, Mr. Solomon is a Mason, as are many of his professionalfriends who will be in attendance. I’m sure they would love to hear you speak onthe topic.”I admit it would be easy. Langdon had kept the lecture notes from every talkhe’d ever given. “I suppose I could consider it. What date is the event?”The assistant cleared his throat, sounding suddenly uncomfortable. “Well,actually, sir, it’s tonight.”Langdon laughed out loud. “Tonight?!”“That’s why it’s so hectic here this morning. The Smithsonian is in a deeplyembarrassing predicament . . .” The assistant spoke more hurriedly now. “Mr.Solomon is ready to send a private jet to Boston for you. The flight is only anhour, and you would be back home before midnight. You’re familiar with theprivate air terminal at Boston’s Logan Airport?”“I am,” Langdon admitted reluctantly. No wonder Peter always gets his way.“Wonderful! Would you be willing to meet the jet there at say . . . fiveo’clock?”“You haven’t left me much choice, have you?” Langdon chuckled.“I just want to make Mr. Solomon happy, sir.”Peter has that effect on people. Langdon considered it a long moment, seeing noway out. “All right. Tell him I can do it.”“Outstanding!” the assistant exclaimed, sounding deeply relieved. He gaveLangdon the jet’s tail number and various other information.When Langdon finally hung up, he wondered if Peter Solomon had ever been toldno.Returning to his coffee preparation, Langdon scooped some additional beans intothe grinder. A little extra caffeine this morning, he thought. It’s going to bea long day."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4The U.S. Capitol Building stands regally at the eastern end of the NationalMall, on a raised plateau that city designer Pierre L’Enfant described as “apedestal waiting for a monument.” The Capitol’s massive footprint measures morethan 750 feet in length and 350 feet deep. Housing more than sixteen acres offloor space, it contains an astonishing 541 rooms. The neoclassical architectureis meticulously designed to echo the grandeur of ancient Rome, whose ideals werethe inspiration for America’s founders in establishing the laws and culture ofthe new republic.The new security checkpoint for tourists entering the Capitol Building islocated deep within the recently completed subterranean visitor center, beneatha magnificent glass skylight that frames the Capitol Dome. Newly hired securityguard Alfonso Nuñez carefully studied the male visitor now approaching hischeckpoint. The man had a shaved head and had been lingering in the lobby,completing a phone call before entering the building. His right arm was in asling, and he moved with a slight limp. He was wearing a tattered army-navysurplus coat, which, combined with his shaved head, made Nuñez guess military.Those who had served in the U.S. armed forces were among the most commonvisitors to Washington.“Good evening, sir,” Nuñez said, following the security protocol of verballyengaging any male visitor who entered alone.“Hello,” the visitor said, glancing around at the nearly deserted entry. “Quietnight.”“NFC play-offs,” Nuñez replied. “Everyone’s watching the Redskins tonight.”Nuñez wished he were, too, but this was his first month on the job, and he’ddrawn the short straw. “Metal objects in the dish, please.”As the visitor fumbled to empty the pockets of his long coat with his oneworking hand, Nuñez watched him carefully. Human instinct made specialallowances for the injured and handicapped, but it was an instinct Nuñez hadbeen trained to override.Nuñez waited while the visitor removed from his pockets the usual assortment ofloose change, keys, and a couple of cell phones. “Sprain?” Nuñez asked, eyeingthe man’s injured hand, which appeared to be wrapped in a series of thick Acebandages.The bald man nodded. “Slipped on the ice. A week ago. Still hurts like hell.”“Sorry to hear that. Walk through, please.”The visitor limped through the detector, and the machine buzzed in protest.The visitor frowned. “I was afraid of that. I’m wearing a ring under thesebandages. My finger was too swollen to get it off, so the doctors wrapped rightover it.”“No problem,” Nuñez said. “I’ll use the wand.”Nuñez ran the metal-detection wand over the visitor’s wrapped hand. As expected,the only metal he detected was a large lump on the man’s injured ring finger.Nuñez took his time rubbing the metal detector over every inch of the man’ssling and finger. He knew his supervisor was probably monitoring him on theclosed circuit in the building’s security center, and Nuñez needed this job.Always better to be cautious. He carefully slid the wand up inside the man’ssling.The visitor winced in pain.“Sorry.”“It’s okay,” the man said. “You can’t be too careful these days.”“Ain’t that the truth.” Nuñez liked this guy. Strangely, that counted for a lotaround here. Human instinct was America’s first line of defense againstterrorism. It was a proven fact that human intuition was a more accuratedetector of danger than all the electronic gear in the world—the gift of fear,as one of their security reference books termed it.In this case, Nuñez’s instincts sensed nothing that caused him any fear. Theonly oddity that he noticed, now that they were standing so close, was that thistough-looking guy appeared to have used some kind of self-tanner or concealermakeup on his face. Whatever. Everyone hates to be pale in the winter.“You’re fine,” Nuñez said, completing his sweep and stowing the wand.“Thanks.” The man started collecting his belongings from the tray.As he did, Nuñez noticed that the two fingers protruding from his bandage eachbore a tattoo; the tip of his index finger bore the image of a crown, and thetip of his thumb bore that of a star. Seems everyone has tattoos these days,Nuñez thought, although the pads of his fingertips seemed like painful spots toget them. “Those tats hurt?”The man glanced down at his fingertips and chuckled. “Less than you mightthink.”“Lucky,” Nuñez said. “Mine hurt a lot. I got a mermaid on my back when I was inboot camp.”“A mermaid?” The bald man chuckled.“Yeah,” he said, feeling sheepish. “The mistakes we make in our youth.”“I hear you,” the bald man said. “I made a big mistake in my youth, too. Now Iwake up with her every morning.”They both laughed as the man headed off.Child’s play, Mal’akh thought as he moved past Nuñez and up the escalator towardthe Capitol Building. The entry had been easier than anticipated. Mal’akh’sslouching posture and padded belly had hidden his true physique, while themakeup on his face and hands had hidden the tattoos that covered his body. Thetrue genius, however, was the sling, which disguised the potent object Mal’akhwas transporting into the building.A gift for the one man on earth who can help me obtain what I seek."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5The world’s largest and most technologically advanced museum is also one of theworld’s best-kept secrets. It houses more pieces than the Hermitage, the VaticanMuseum, and the New York Metropolitan . . . combined. Yet despite itsmagnificent collection, few members of the public are ever invited inside itsheavily guarded walls.Located at 4210 Silver Hill Road just outside of Washington, D.C., the museum isa massive zigzag-shaped edifice constructed of five interconnected pods—each podlarger than a football field. The building’s bluish metal exterior barely hintsat the strangeness within—a six-hundred-thousand-square-foot alien world thatcontains a “dead zone,” a “wet pod,” and more than twelve miles of storagecabinets.Tonight, scientist Katherine Solomon was feeling unsettled as she drove herwhite Volvo up to the building’s main security gate.The guard smiled. “Not a football fan, Ms. Solomon?” He lowered the volume onthe Redskins play-off pregame show.Katherine forced a tense smile. “It’s Sunday night.”“Oh, that’s right. Your meeting.”“Is he here yet?” she asked anxiously.He glanced down at his paperwork. “I don’t see him on the log.”“I’m early.” Katherine gave a friendly wave and continued up the winding accessroad to her usual parking spot at the bottom of the small, two-tiered lot. Shebegan collecting her things and gave herself a quick check in the rearviewmirror—more out of force of habit than actual vanity.Katherine Solomon had been blessed with the resilient Mediterranean skin of herancestry, and even at fifty years old she had a smooth olive complexion. Sheused almost no makeup and wore her thick black hair unstyled and down. Like herolder brother, Peter, she had gray eyes and a slender, patrician elegance.You two might as well be twins, people often told them.Their father had succumbed to cancer when Katherine was only seven, and she hadlittle memory of him. Her brother, eight years Katherine’s senior and onlyfifteen when their father died, had begun his journey toward becoming theSolomon patriarch much sooner than anyone had ever dreamed. As expected, though,Peter had grown into the role with the dignity and strength befitting theirfamily name. To this day, he still watched over Katherine as though they werejust kids.Despite her brother’s occasional prodding, and no shortage of suitors, Katherinehad never married. Science had become her life partner, and her work had provenmore fulfilling and exciting than any man could ever hope to be. Katherine hadno regrets.Her field of choice—Noetic Science—had been virtually unknown when she firstheard of it, but in recent years it had started opening new doors ofunderstanding into the power of the human mind.Our untapped potential is truly shocking.Katherine’s two books on Noetics had established her as a leader in this obscurefield, but her most recent discoveries, when published, promised to make NoeticScience a topic of mainstream conversation around the world.Tonight, however, science was the last thing on her mind. Earlier in the day,she had received some truly upsetting information relating to her brother. Istill can’t believe it’s true. She’d thought of nothing else all afternoon.A pattering of light rain drummed on her windshield, and Katherine quicklygathered her things to get inside. She was about to step out of her car when hercell phone rang.She checked the caller ID and inhaled deeply.Then she tucked her hair behind her ears and settled in to take the call.Six miles away, Mal’akh was moving through the corridors of the U.S. CapitolBuilding with a cell phone pressed to his ear. He waited patiently as the linerang.Finally, a woman’s voice answered. “Yes?”“We need to meet again,” Mal’akh said.There was a long pause. “Is everything all right?”“I have new information,” Mal’akh said.“Tell me.”Mal’akh took a deep breath. “That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C.. . . ?”“Yes?”“It can be found.”Katherine Solomon sounded stunned. “You’re telling me—it is real?”Mal’akh smiled to himself. “Sometimes a legend that endures for centuries . . .endures for a reason.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6Is this as close as you can get?” Robert Langdon felt a sudden wave of anxietyas his driver parked on First Street, a good quarter mile from the CapitolBuilding.“Afraid so,” the driver said. “Homeland Security. No vehicles near landmarkbuildings anymore. I’m sorry, sir.”Langdon checked his watch, startled to see it was already 6:50. A constructionzone around the National Mall had slowed them down, and his lecture was to beginin ten minutes.“Weather’s turning,” the driver said, hopping out and opening Langdon’s door forhim. “You’ll want to hurry.” Langdon reached for his wallet to tip the driver,but the man waved him off. “Your host already added a very generous tip to thecharge.”Typical Peter, Langdon thought, gathering his things. “Okay, thanks for theride.”The first few raindrops began to fall as Langdon reached the top of thegracefully arched concourse that descended to the new “underground” visitors’entrance.The Capitol Visitor Center had been a costly and controversial project.Described as an underground city to rival parts of Disney World, thissubterranean space reportedly provided over a half-million square feet of spacefor exhibits, restaurants, and meeting halls.Langdon had been looking forward to seeing it, although he hadn’t anticipatedquite this long a walk. The skies were threatening to open at any moment, and hebroke into a jog, his loafers offering almost no traction on the wet cement. Idressed for a lecture, not a four-hundred-yard downhill dash through the rain!When he arrived at the bottom, he was breathless and panting. Langdon pushedthrough the revolving door, taking a moment in the foyer to catch his breath andbrush off the rain. As he did, he raised his eyes to the newly completed spacebefore him.Okay, I’m impressed.The Capitol Visitor Center was not at all what he had expected. Because thespace was underground, Langdon had been apprehensive about passing through it. Achildhood accident had left him stranded at the bottom of a deep well overnight,and Langdon now lived with an almost crippling aversion to enclosed spaces. Butthis underground space was . . . airy somehow. Light. Spacious.The ceiling was a vast expanse of glass with a series of dramatic light fixturesthat threw a muted glow across the pearl-colored interior finishes.Normally, Langdon would have taken a full hour in here to admire thearchitecture, but with five minutes until showtime, he put his head down anddashed through the main hall toward the security checkpoint and escalators.Relax, he told himself. Peter knows you’re on your way. The event won’t startwithout you.At the security point, a young Hispanic guard chatted with him while Langdonemptied his pockets and removed his vintage watch.“Mickey Mouse?” the guard said, sounding mildly amused.Langdon nodded, accustomed to the comments. The collector’s edition Mickey Mousewatch had been a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. “I wear it toremind me to slow down and take life less seriously.”“I don’t think it’s working,” the guard said with a smile. “You look like you’rein a serious hurry.”Langdon smiled and put his daybag through the X-ray machine. “Which way to theStatuary Hall?”The guard motioned toward the escalators. “You’ll see the signs.”“Thanks.” Langdon grabbed his bag off the conveyor and hurried on.As the escalator ascended, Langdon took a deep breath and tried to gather histhoughts. He gazed up through the rain-speckled glass ceiling at the mountainousform of the illuminated Capitol Dome overhead. It was an astonishing building.High atop her roof, almost three hundred feet in the air, the Statue of Freedompeered out into the misty darkness like a ghostly sentinel. Langdon always foundit ironic that the workers who hoisted each piece of thenineteen-and-a-half-foot bronze statue to her perch were slaves—a Capitol secretthat seldom made the syllabi of high school history classes.This entire building, in fact, was a treasure trove of bizarre arcana thatincluded a “killer bathtub” responsible for the pneumonic murder of VicePresident Henry Wilson, a staircase with a permanent bloodstain over which aninordinate number of guests seemed to trip, and a sealed basement chamber inwhich workers in 1930 discovered General John Alexander Logan’s long-deceasedstuffed horse.No legends were as enduring, however, as the claims of thirteen different ghoststhat haunted this building. The spirit of city designer Pierre L’Enfantfrequently was reported wandering the halls, seeking payment of his bill, nowtwo hundred years overdue. The ghost of a worker who fell from the Capitol Domeduring construction was seen wandering the corridors with a tray of tools. And,of course, the most famous apparition of all, reported numerous times in theCapitol basement—an ephemeral black cat that prowled the substructure’s eeriemaze of narrow passageways and cubicles.Langdon stepped off the escalator and again checked his watch. Three minutes. Hehurried down the wide corridor, following the signs toward the Statuary Hall andrehearsing his opening remarks in his head. Langdon had to admit that Peter’sassistant had been correct; this lecture topic would be a perfect match for anevent hosted in Washington, D.C., by a prominent Mason.It was no secret that D.C. had a rich Masonic history. The cornerstone of thisvery building had been laid in a full Masonic ritual by George Washingtonhimself. This city had been conceived and designed by Master Masons—GeorgeWashington, Ben Franklin, and Pierre L’Enfant—powerful minds who adorned theirnew capital with Masonic symbolism, architecture, and art.Of course, people see in those symbols all kinds of crazy ideas.Many conspiracy theorists claimed the Masonic forefathers had concealed powerfulsecrets throughout Washington along with symbolic messages hidden in the city’slayout of streets. Langdon never paid any attention. Misinformation about theMasons was so commonplace that even educated Harvard students seemed to havesurprisingly warped conceptions about the brotherhood.Last year, a freshman had rushed wild-eyed into Langdon’s classroom with aprintout from the Web. It was a street map of D.C. on which certain streets hadbeen highlighted to form various shapes—satanic pentacles, a Masonic compass andsquare, the head of Baphomet—proof apparently that the Masons who designedWashington, D.C., were involved in some kind of dark, mystical conspiracy.“Fun,” Langdon said, “but hardly convincing. If you draw enough intersectinglines on a map, you’re bound to find all kinds of shapes.”“But this can’t be coincidence!” the kid exclaimed.Langdon patiently showed the student that the same exact shapes could be formedon a street map of Detroit.The kid seemed sorely disappointed.“Don’t be disheartened,” Langdon said. “Washington does have some incrediblesecrets . . . just none on this street map.”The young man perked up. “Secrets? Like what?”“Every spring I teach a course called Occult Symbols. I talk a lot about D.C.You should take the course.”“Occult symbols!” The freshman looked excited again. “So there are devil symbolsin D.C.!”Langdon smiled. “Sorry, but the word occult, despite conjuring images of devilworship, actually means ‘hidden’ or ‘obscured.’ In times of religiousoppression, knowledge that was counterdoctrinal had to be kept hidden or‘occult,’ and because the church felt threatened by this, they redefinedanything ‘occult’ as evil, and the prejudice survived.”“Oh.” The kid slumped.Nonetheless, that spring, Langdon spotted the freshman seated in the front rowas five hundred students bustled into Harvard’s Sanders Theatre, a hollow oldlecture hall with creaking wooden benches.“Good morning, everybody,” Langdon shouted from the expansive stage. He turnedon a slide projector, and an image materialized behind him. “As you’re gettingsettled, how many of you recognize the building in this picture?”“U.S. Capitol!” dozens of voices called out in unison. “Washington, D.C.!”“Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleledfeat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s.”“Awesome!” somebody shouted.Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. “Okay, and howmany of you have ever been to Washington?”A scattering of hands went up.“So few?” Langdon feigned surprise. “And how many of you have been to Rome,Paris, Madrid, or London?”Almost all the hands in the room went up.As usual. One of the rites of passage for American college kids was a summerwith a Eurorail ticket before the harsh reality of real life set in. “It appearsmany more of you have visited Europe than have visited your own capital. Why doyou think that is?”“No drinking age in Europe!” someone in back shouted.Langdon smiled. “As if the drinking age here stops any of you?”Everyone laughed.It was the first day of school, and the students were taking longer than usualto get settled, shifting and creaking in their wooden pews. Langdon lovedteaching in this hall because he always knew how engaged the students weresimply by listening to how much they fidgeted in their pews.“Seriously,” Langdon said, “Washington, D.C., has some of the world’s finestarchitecture, art, and symbolism. Why would you go overseas before visiting yourown capital?”“Ancient stuff is cooler,” someone said.“And by ancient stuff,” Langdon clarified, “I assume you mean castles, crypts,temples, that sort of thing?”Their heads nodded in unison.“Okay. Now, what if I told you that Washington, D.C., has every one of thosethings? Castles, crypts, pyramids, temples . . . it’s all there.”The creaking diminished.“My friends,” Langdon said, lowering his voice and moving to the front of thestage, “in the next hour, you will discover that our nation is overflowing withsecrets and hidden history. And exactly as in Europe, all of the best secretsare hidden in plain view.”The wooden pews fell dead silent.Gotcha.Langdon dimmed the lights and called up his second slide. “Who can tell me whatGeorge Washington is doing here?”The slide was a famous mural depicting George Washington dressed in full Masonicregalia standing before an odd-looking contraption—a giant wooden tripod thatsupported a rope-and-pulley system from which was suspended a massive block ofstone. A group of well-dressed onlookers stood around him.“Lifting that big block of stone?” someone ventured.Langdon said nothing, preferring that a student make the correction if possible.“Actually,” another student offered, “I think Washington is lowering the rock.He’s wearing a Masonic costume. I’ve seen pictures of Masons laying cornerstonesbefore. The ceremony always uses that tripod thing to lower the first stone.”“Excellent,” Langdon said. “The mural portrays the Father of Our Country using atripod and pulley to lay the cornerstone of our Capitol Building on September18, 1793, between the hours of eleven fifteen and twelve thirty.” Langdonpaused, scanning the class. “Can anyone tell me the significance of that dateand time?”Silence.“What if I told you that precise moment was chosen by three famous Masons—GeorgeWashington, Benjamin Franklin, and Pierre L’Enfant, the primary architect forD.C.?”More silence.“Quite simply, the cornerstone was set at that date and time because, amongother things, the auspicious Caput Draconis was in Virgo.”Everyone exchanged odd looks.“Hold on,” someone said. “You mean . . . like astrology?”“Exactly. Although a different astrology than we know today.”A hand went up. “You mean our Founding Fathers believed in astrology?”Langdon grinned. “Big-time. What would you say if I told you the city ofWashington, D.C., has more astrological signs in its architecture than any othercity in the world—zodiacs, star charts, cornerstones laid at preciseastrological dates and times? More than half of the framers of our Constitutionwere Masons, men who strongly believed that the stars and fate were intertwined,men who paid close attention to the layout of the heavens as they structuredtheir new world.”“But that whole thing about the Capitol cornerstone being laid while CaputDraconis was in Virgo—who cares? Can’t that just be coincidence?”“An impressive coincidence considering that the cornerstones of the threestructures that make up Federal Triangle—the Capitol, the White House, theWashington Monument—were all laid in different years but were carefully timed tooccur under this exact same astrological condition.”Langdon’s gaze was met by a room full of wide eyes. A number of heads dippeddown as students began taking notes.A hand in back went up. “Why did they do that?”Langdon chuckled. “The answer to that is an entire semester’s worth of material.If you’re curious, you should take my mysticism course. Frankly, I don’t thinkyou guys are emotionally prepared to hear the answer.”“What?” the person shouted. “Try us!”Langdon made a show of considering it and then shook his head, toying with them.“Sorry, I can’t do that. Some of you are only freshmen. I’m afraid it might blowyour minds.”“Tell us!” everyone shouted.Langdon shrugged. “Perhaps you should join the Masons or Eastern Star and learnabout it from the source.”“We can’t get in,” a young man argued. “The Masons are like a supersecretsociety!”“Supersecret? Really?” Langdon remembered the large Masonic ring that his friendPeter Solomon wore proudly on his right hand. “Then why do Masons wear obviousMasonic rings, tie clips, or pins? Why are Masonic buildings clearly marked? Whyare their meeting times in the newspaper?” Langdon smiled at all the puzzledfaces. “My friends, the Masons are not a secret society . . . they are a societywith secrets.”“Same thing,” someone muttered.“Is it?” Langdon challenged. “Would you consider Coca-Cola a secret society?”“Of course not,” the student said.“Well, what if you knocked on the door of corporate headquarters and asked forthe recipe for Classic Coke?”“They’d never tell you.”“Exactly. In order to learn Coca-Cola’s deepest secret, you would need to jointhe company, work for many years, prove you were trustworthy, and eventuallyrise to the upper echelons of the company, where that information might beshared with you. Then you would be sworn to secrecy.”“So you’re saying Freemasonry is like a corporation?” “Only insofar as they havea strict hierarchy and they take secrecy very seriously.”“My uncle is a Mason,” a young woman piped up. “And my aunt hates it because hewon’t talk about it with her. She says Masonry is some kind of strangereligion.”“A common misperception.”“It’s not a religion?”“Give it the litmus test,” Langdon said. “Who here has taken ProfessorWitherspoon’s comparative religion course?”Several hands went up.“Good. So tell me, what are the three prerequisites for an ideology to beconsidered a religion?”“ABC,” one woman offered. “Assure, Believe, Convert.”“Correct,” Langdon said. “Religions assure salvation; religions believe in aprecise theology; and religions convert nonbelievers.” He paused. “Masonry,however, is batting zero for three. Masons make no promises of salvation; theyhave no specific theology; and they do not seek to convert you. In fact, withinMasonic lodges, discussions of religion are prohibited.”“So . . . Masonry is anti religious?”“On the contrary. One of the prerequisites for becoming a Mason is that you mustbelieve in a higher power. The difference between Masonic spirituality andorganized religion is that the Masons do not impose a specific definition orname on a higher power. Rather than definitive theological identities like God,Allah, Buddha, or Jesus, the Masons use more general terms like Supreme Being orGreat Architect of the Universe. This enables Masons of different faiths togather together.”“Sounds a little far-out,” someone said.“Or, perhaps, refreshingly open-minded?” Langdon offered. “In this age whendifferent cultures are killing each other over whose definition of God isbetter, one could say the Masonic tradition of tolerance and open-mindedness iscommendable.” Langdon paced the stage. “Moreover, Masonry is open to men of allraces, colors, and creeds, and provides a spiritual fraternity that does notdiscriminate in any way.”“Doesn’t discriminate?” A member of the university’s Women’s Center stood up.“How many women are permitted to be Masons, Professor Langdon?”Langdon showed his palms in surrender. “A fair point. Freemasonry had its roots,traditionally, in the stone masons’ guilds of Europe and was therefore a man’sorganization. Several hundred years ago, some say as early as 1703, a women’sbranch called Eastern Star was founded. They have more than a million members.”“Nonetheless,” the woman said, “Masonry is a powerful organization from whichwomen are excluded.”Langdon was not sure how powerful the Masons really were anymore, and he was notgoing to go down that road; perceptions of the modern Masons ranged from theirbeing a group of harmless old men who liked to play dress-up . . . all the wayto an underground cabal of power brokers who ran the world. The truth, no doubt,was somewhere in the middle.“Professor Langdon,” called a young man with curly hair in the back row, “ifMasonry is not a secret society, not a corporation, and not a religion, thenwhat is it?”“Well, if you were to ask a Mason, he would offer the following definition:Masonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols.”“Sounds to me like a euphemism for ‘freaky cult.’ ”“Freaky, you say?”“Hell yes!” the kid said, standing up. “I heard what they do inside those secretbuildings! Weird candlelight rituals with coffins, and nooses, and drinking wineout of skulls. Now that’s freaky!”Langdon scanned the class. “Does that sound freaky to anyone else?”“Yes!” they all chimed in.Langdon feigned a sad sigh. “Too bad. If that’s too freaky for you, then I knowyou’ll never want to join my cult.”Silence settled over the room. The student from the Women’s Center lookeduneasy. “You’re in a cult?”Langdon nodded and lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. “Don’t tellanyone, but on the pagan day of the sun god Ra, I kneel at the foot of anancient instrument of torture and consume ritualistic symbols of blood andflesh.”The class looked horrified.Langdon shrugged. “And if any of you care to join me, come to the Harvard chapelon Sunday, kneel beneath the crucifix, and take Holy Communion.”The classroom remained silent.Langdon winked. “Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do notunderstand.”The tolling of a clock began echoing through the Capitol corridors.Seven o’clock.Robert Langdon was now running. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Passing throughthe House Connecting Corridor, he spotted the entrance to the National StatuaryHall and headed straight for it.As he neared the door, he slowed to a nonchalant stroll and took several deepbreaths. Buttoning his jacket, he lifted his chin ever so slightly and turnedthe corner just as the final chime sounded.Showtime.As Professor Robert Langdon strode into the National Statuary Hall, he raisedhis eyes and smiled warmly. An instant later, his smile evaporated. He stoppeddead in his tracks.Something was very, very wrong."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7Katherine Solomon hurried across the parking lot through the cold rain, wishingshe had worn more than jeans and a cashmere sweater. As she neared thebuilding’s main entrance, the roar of the giant air purifiers got louder. Shebarely heard them, her ears still ringing from the phone call she’d justreceived.That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.Katherine found the notion almost impossible to believe. She and the callerstill had much to discuss and had agreed to do so later that evening.Reaching the main doors, she felt the same sense of excitement she always feltupon entering the gargantuan building. Nobody knows this place is here.The sign on the door announced:SMITHSONIAN MUSEUMSUPPORT CENTER(SMSC)The Smithsonian Institution, despite having more than a dozen massive museums onthe National Mall, had a collection so huge that only 2 percent of it could beon display at any one time. The other 98 percent of the collection had to bestored somewhere. And that somewhere . . . was here.Not surprisingly, this building was home to an astonishingly diverse array ofartifacts—giant Buddhas, handwritten codices, poisoned darts from New Guinea,jewel-encrusted knives, a kayak made of baleen. Equally mind-boggling were thebuilding’s natural treasures—plesiosaur skeletons, a priceless meteoritecollection, a giant squid, even a collection of elephant skulls brought backfrom an African safari by Teddy Roosevelt.But none of this was why the Smithsonian secretary, Peter Solomon, hadintroduced his sister to the SMSC three years ago. He had brought her to thisplace not to behold scientific marvels, but rather to create them. And that wasexactly what Katherine had been doing.Deep within this building, in the darkness of the most remote recesses, was asmall scientific laboratory unlike any other in the world. The recentbreakthroughs Katherine had made here in the field of Noetic Science hadramifications across every discipline—from physics, to history, to philosophy,to religion. Soon everything will change, she thought.As Katherine entered the lobby, the front desk guard quickly stashed his radioand yanked the earplugs from his ears. “Ms. Solomon!” He smiled broadly.“Redskins?”He blushed, looking guilty. “Pregame.”She smiled. “I won’t tell.” She walked to the metal detector and emptied herpockets. When she slid the gold Cartier watch from her wrist, she felt the usualpang of sadness. The timepiece had been a gift from her mother for Katherine’seighteenth birthday. Almost ten years had now passed since her mother had diedviolently . . . passing away in Katherine’s arms.“So, Ms. Solomon?” the guard whispered jokingly. “Are you ever gonna tellanybody what you’re doing back there?”She glanced up. “Someday, Kyle. Not tonight.”“Come on,” he pressed. “A secret lab . . . in a secret museum? You must be doingsomething cool.”Miles beyond cool, Katherine thought as she collected her things. The truth wasthat Katherine was doing science so advanced that it no longer even resembledscience."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8Robert Langdon stood frozen in the doorway of the National Statuary Hall andstudied the startling scene before him. The room was precisely as he rememberedit—a balanced semicircle built in the style of a Greek amphitheater. Thegraceful arched walls of sandstone and Italian plaster were punctuated bycolumns of variegated breccia, interspersed with the nation’s statuarycollection—life-size statues of thirty-eight great Americans standing in asemicircle on a stark expanse of black-and-white marble tile.It was exactly as Langdon had recalled from the lecture he had once attendedhere.Except for one thing.Tonight, the room was empty.No chairs. No audience. No Peter Solomon. Just a handful of tourists millingaround aimlessly, oblivious to Langdon’s grand entrance. Did Peter mean theRotunda? He peered down the south corridor toward the Rotunda and could seetourists milling around in there, too.The echoes of the clock chime had faded. Langdon was now officially late.He hurried back into the hallway and found a docent. “Excuse me, the lecture forthe Smithsonian event tonight? Where is that being held?”The docent hesitated. “I’m not sure, sir. When does it start?”“Now!”The man shook his head. “I don’t know about any Smithsonian event thisevening—not here, at least.”Bewildered, Langdon hurried back toward the center of the room, scanning theentire space. Is Solomon playing some kind of joke? Langdon couldn’t imagine it.He pulled out his cell phone and the fax page from this morning and dialedPeter’s number.His phone took a moment to locate a signal inside the enormous building.Finally, it began to ring.The familiar southern accent answered. “Peter Solomon’s office, this is Anthony.May I help you?”“Anthony!” Langdon said with relief. “I’m glad you’re still there. This isRobert Langdon. There seems to be some confusion about the lecture. I’m standingin the Statuary Hall, but there’s nobody here. Has the lecture been moved to adifferent room?”“I don’t believe so, sir. Let me check.” His assistant paused a moment. “Did youconfirm with Mr. Solomon directly?”Langdon was confused. “No, I confirmed with you, Anthony. This morning!”“Yes, I recall that.” There was a silence on the line. “That was a bit carelessof you, don’t you think, Professor?”Langdon was now fully alert. “I beg your pardon?”“Consider this . . .” the man said. “You received a fax asking you to call anumber, which you did. You spoke to a total stranger who said he was PeterSolomon’s assistant. Then you willingly boarded a private plane to Washingtonand climbed into a waiting car. Is that right?”Langdon felt a chill race through his body. “Who the hell is this? Where isPeter?”“I’m afraid Peter Solomon has no idea you’re in Washington today.” The man’ssouthern accent disappeared, and his voice morphed into a deeper, mellifluouswhisper. “You are here, Mr. Langdon, because I want you here.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9Inside the Statuary Hall, Robert Langdon clutched his cell phone to his ear andpaced in a tight circle. “Who the hell are you?”The man’s reply was a silky calm whisper. “Do not be alarmed, Professor. Youhave been summoned here for a reason.”“Summoned?” Langdon felt like a caged animal. “Try kidnapped!”“Hardly.” The man’s voice was eerily serene. “If I wanted to harm you, you wouldbe dead in your Town Car right now.” He let the words hang for a moment. “Myintentions are purely noble, I assure you. I would simply like to offer you aninvitation.”No thanks. Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years,Langdon’s unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nut-cases, and this onehad just crossed a very serious line. “Look, I don’t know what the hell is goingon here, but I’m hanging up—”“Unwise,” said the man. “Your window of opportunity is very small if you want tosave Peter Solomon’s soul.”Langdon drew a sharp breath. “What did you say?”“I’m sure you heard me.”The way this man had uttered Peter’s name had stopped Langdon cold. “What do youknow about Peter?”“At this point, I know his deepest secrets. Mr. Solomon is my guest, and I canbe a persuasive host.”This can’t be happening. “You don’t have Peter.”“I answered his private cell phone. That should give you pause.”“I’m calling the police.”“No need,” the man said. “The authorities will join you momentarily.”What is this lunatic talking about? Langdon’s tone hardened. “If you have Peter,put him on the phone right now.” ““That’s impossible. Mr. Solomon is trapped in an unfortunate place.” The manpaused. “He is in the Araf.”“Where?” Langdon realized he was clutching his phone so tightly his fingers weregoing numb.“The Araf? Hamistagan? That place to which Dante devoted the canticleimmediately following his legendary Inferno?”The man’s religious and literary references solidified Langdon’s suspicion thathe was dealing with a madman. The second canticle. Langdon knew it well; nobodyescaped Phillips Exeter Academy without reading Dante. “You’re saying you thinkPeter Solomon is . . . in purgatory?”“A crude word you Christians use, but yes, Mr. Solomon is in the in-between.”The man’s words hung in Langdon’s ear. “Are you saying Peter is . . . dead?”“Not exactly, no.”“Not exactly?!” Langdon yelled, his voice echoing sharply in the hall. A familyof tourists looked over at him. He turned away and lowered his voice. “Death isusually an all-or-nothing thing!”“You surprise me, Professor. I expected you to have a better understanding ofthe mysteries of life and death. There is a world in between—a world in whichPeter Solomon is hovering at the moment. He can either return to your world, orhe can move on to the next . . . depending on your actions right now.”Langdon tried to process this. “What do you want from me?”“It’s simple. You have been given access to something quite ancient. Andtonight, you will share it with me.”“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”“No? You pretend not to understand the ancient secrets that have been entrustedto you?”Langdon felt a sudden sinking sensation, now guessing what this was probablyabout. Ancient secrets. He had not uttered a word to anyone about hisexperiences in Paris several years earlier, but Grail fanatics had followed themedia coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was nowprivy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail—perhaps even its location.“Look,” Langdon said, “if this is about the Holy Grail, I can assure you I knownothing more than—”“Don’t insult my intelligence, Mr. Langdon,” the man snapped. “I have nointerest in anything so frivolous as the Holy Grail or mankind’s pathetic debateover whose version of history is correct. Circular arguments over the semanticsof faith hold no interest for me. Those are questions answered only throughdeath.”The stark words left Langdon confused. “Then what the hell is this about?”The man paused for several seconds. “As you may know, there exists within thiscity an ancient portal.”An ancient portal?“And tonight, Professor, you will unlock it for me. You should be honored Icontacted you—this is the invitation of your lifetime. You alone have beenchosen.”And you have lost your mind. “I’m sorry, but you’ve chosen poorly,” Langdonsaid. “I don’t know anything about any ancient portal.”“You don’t understand, Professor. It was not I who chose you . . . it was PeterSolomon.”“What?” Langdon replied, his voice barely a whisper.“Mr. Solomon told me how to find the portal, and he confessed to me that onlyone man on earth could unlock it. And he said that man is you.”“If Peter said that, he was mistaken . . . or lying.”“I think not. He was in a fragile state when he confessed that fact, and I aminclined to believe him.”Langdon felt a stab of anger. “I’m warning you, if you hurt Peter in any—”“It’s far too late for that,” the man said in an amused tone. “I’ve alreadytaken what I need from Peter Solomon. But for his sake, I suggest you providewhat I need from you. Time is of the essence . . . for both of you. I suggestyou find the portal and unlock it. Peter will point the way.”Peter? “I thought you said Peter was in ‘purgatory.’”“As above, so below,” the man said.Langdon felt a deepening chill. This strange response was an ancient Hermeticadage that proclaimed a belief in the physical connection between heaven andearth. As above, so below. Langdon eyed the vast room and wondered howeverything had veered so suddenly out of control tonight. “Look, I don’t knowhow to find any ancient portal. I’m calling the police.”“It really hasn’t dawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?”“No,” Langdon said.“It will,” he replied, chuckling. “Any moment now.”Then the line went dead.Langdon stood rigid for several terrifying moments, trying to process what hadjust happened.Suddenly, in the distance, he heard an unexpected sound.It was coming from the Rotunda.Someone was screaming."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10Robert Langdon had entered the Capitol Rotunda many times in his life, but neverat a full sprint. As he ran through the north entrance, he spotted a group oftourists clustered in the center of the room. A small boy was screaming, and hisparents were trying to console him. Others were crowding around, and severalsecurity guards were doing their best to restore order.“He pulled it out of his sling,” someone said frantically, “and just left itthere!”As Langdon drew nearer, he got his first glimpse of what was causing all thecommotion. Admittedly, the object on the Capitol floor was odd, but its presencehardly warranted screaming.The device on the floor was one Langdon had seen many times. The Harvard artdepartment had dozens of these—life-size plastic models used by sculptors andpainters to help them render the human body’s most complex feature, which,surprisingly, was not the human face but rather the human hand. Someone left amannequin hand in the Rotunda?Mannequin hands, or handequins as some called them, had articulated fingersenabling an artist to pose the hand in whatever position he wanted, which forsophomoric college students was often with the middle finger extended straightup in the air. This handequin, however, had been positioned with its indexfinger and thumb pointing up toward the ceiling.As Langdon drew nearer, though, he realized this handequin was unusual. Itsplastic surface was not smooth like most. Instead, the surface was mottled andslightly wrinkled, and appeared almost . . .Like real skin.Langdon stopped abruptly.Now he saw the blood. My God!The severed wrist appeared to have been skewered onto a spiked wooden base sothat it would stand up. A wave of nausea rushed over him. Langdon inched closer,unable to breathe, seeing now that the tips of the index finger and thumb hadbeen decorated with tiny tattoos. The tattoos, however, were not what heldLangdon’s attention. His gaze moved instantly to the familiar golden ring on thefourth finger.No.Langdon recoiled. His world began to spin as he realized he was looking at thesevered right hand of Peter Solomon."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11Why isn’t Peter answering? Katherine Solomon wondered as she hung up her cellphone. Where is he?For three years, Peter Solomon had always been the first to arrive for theirweekly seven P.M. Sunday-night meetings. It was their private family ritual, away to remain connected before the start of a new week, and for Peter to stayup-to-date on Katherine’s work at the lab.He’s never late, she thought, and he always answers his phone. To make mattersworse, Katherine was still not sure what she was going to say to him when he didfinally arrive. How do I even begin to ask him about what I found out today?Her footsteps clicked rhythmically down the cement corridor that ran like aspine through the SMSC. Known as “The Street,” the corridor connected thebuilding’s five massive storage pods. Forty feet overhead, a circulatory systemof orange ductwork throbbed with the heartbeat of the building—the pulsingsounds of thousands of cubic feet of filtered air being circulated.Normally, during her nearly quarter-mile walk to her lab, Katherine felt calmedby the breathing sounds of the building. Tonight, however, the pulsing had heron edge. What she had learned about her brother today would have troubledanyone, and yet because Peter was the only family she had in the world,Katherine felt especially disturbed to think he might be keeping secrets fromher.As far as she knew, he had kept a secret from her only once . . . a wonderfulsecret that was hidden at the end of this very hallway. Three years ago, herbrother had walked Katherine down this corridor, introducing her to the SMSC byproudly showing off some of the building’s more unusual items—the Mars meteoriteALH-84001, the handwritten pictographic diary of Sitting Bull, a collection ofwax-sealed Ball jars containing original specimens collected by Charles Darwin.At one point, they walked past a heavy door with a small window. Katherinecaught a glimpse of what lay beyond and gasped. “What in the world is that?!”Her brother chuckled and kept walking. “Pod Three. It’s called Wet Pod. Prettyunusual sight, isn’t it?”Terrifying is more like it. Katherine hurried after him. This building was likeanother planet.“What I really want to show you is in Pod Five,” her brother said, guiding herdown the seemingly endless corridor. “It’s our newest addition. It was built tohouse artifacts from the basement of the National Museum of Natural History.That collection is scheduled for relocation here in about five years, whichmeans Pod Five is sitting empty at the moment.”Katherine glanced over. “Empty? So why are we looking at it?”Her brother’s gray eyes flashed a familiar mischief. “It occurred to me thatbecause nobody is using the space, maybe you could use it.”“Me?”“Sure. I thought maybe you could use a dedicated lab space—a facility where youcan actually perform some of the theoretical experiments you’ve been developingfor all these years.”Katherine stared at her brother in shock. “But, Peter, those experiments aretheoretical! To actually perform them would be almost impossible.”“Nothing is impossible, Katherine, and this building is perfect for you. TheSMSC is not just a warehouse of treasures; it’s one of the world’s most advancedscientific research facilities. We’re constantly taking pieces from thecollection and examining them with the best quantitative technologies money canbuy. All the equipment you could possibly need would be here at your disposal.”“Peter, the technologies required to run these experiments are—”“Already in place.” He smiled broadly. “The lab is done.”Katherine stopped short.Her brother pointed down the long corridor. “We’re going to see it now.”Katherine could barely speak. “You . . . you built me a lab?”“It’s my job. The Smithsonian was established to advance scientific knowledge.As secretary, I must take that charge seriously. I believe the experimentsyou’ve proposed have the potential to push the boundaries of science intouncharted territory.” Peter stopped and looked her squarely in the eyes.“Whether or not you were my sister, I would feel obliged to support thisresearch. Your ideas are brilliant. The world deserves to see where they lead.”“Peter, I can’t possibly—”“Okay, relax . . . it was my own money, and nobody’s using Pod Five right now.When you’re done with your experiments, you’ll move out. Besides, Pod Five hassome unique properties that will be perfect for your work.”Katherine could not imagine what a massive, empty pod might offer that wouldserve her research, but she sensed she was about to find out. They had justreached a steel door with boldly stenciled letters:POD 5Her brother inserted his key card into a slot and an electronic keypad lit up.He raised his finger to type his access code, but paused, arching his eyebrowsin the same mischievous way he always had as a boy. “You sure you’re ready?”She nodded. My brother, always the showman.“Stand back.” Peter hit the keys.The steel door hissed loudly open.Beyond the threshold was only inky blackness . . . a yawning void. A hollow moanseemed to echo out of the depths. Katherine felt a cold blast of air emanatingfrom within. It was like staring into the Grand Canyon at night.“Picture an empty airline hangar waiting for a fleet of Airbuses,” her brothersaid, “and you get the basic idea.”Katherine felt herself take a step backward.“The pod itself is far too voluminous to be heated, but your lab is a thermallyinsulated cinder-block room, roughly a cube, located in the farthest corner ofthe pod for maximum separation.”Katherine tried to picture it. A box inside a box. She strained to see into thedarkness, but it was absolute. “How far back?”“Pretty far . . . a football field would fit easily in here. I should warn you,though, the walk is a little unnerving. It’s exceptionally dark.”Katherine peered tentatively around the corner. “No light switch?”“Pod Five is not yet wired for electricity.”“But . . . then how can a lab function?”He winked. “Hydrogen fuel cell.”Katherine’s jaw dropped. “You’re kidding, right?”“Enough clean power to run a small town. Your lab enjoys full radio-frequencyseparation from the rest of the building. What’s more, all pod exteriors aresealed with photo-resistant membranes to protect the artifacts inside from solarradiation. Essentially, this pod is a sealed, energy-neutral environment.”Katherine was starting to comprehend the appeal of Pod 5. Because much of herwork centered on quantifying previously unknown energy fields, her experimentsneeded to be performed in a location isolated from any extraneous radiation or“white noise.” This included interference as subtle as “brain radiation” or“thought emissions” generated by people nearby. For this reason, a universitycampus or hospital lab wouldn’t work, but a deserted pod at the SMSC could nothave been more perfect.“Let’s go back and have a look.” Her brother was grinning as he stepped into thevast darkness. “Just follow me.”Katherine stalled at the threshold. Over a hundred yards in total darkness? Shewanted to suggest a flashlight, but her brother had already disappeared into theabyss.“Peter?” she called.“Leap of faith,” he called back, his voice already fading away. “You’ll findyour way. Trust me.”He’s kidding, right? Katherine’s heart was pounding as she stepped a few feetover the threshold, trying to peer into the darkness. I can’t see a thing!Suddenly the steel door hissed and slammed shut behind her, plunging her intototal blackness. Not a speck of light anywhere. “Peter?!”Silence.You’ll find your way. Trust me.Tentative, she inched forward blindly. Leap of faith? Katherine could not evensee her hand directly in front of her face. She kept moving forward, but withina matter of seconds, she was entirely lost. Where am I going?That was three years ago.Now, as Katherine arrived at the same heavy metal door, she realized how far shehad come since that first night. Her lab—nicknamed the Cube—had become her home,a sanctuary within the depths of Pod 5. Exactly as her brother had predicted,she had found her way through the darkness that night, and every daysince—thanks to an ingeniously simple guidance system that her brother had lether discover for herself.Far more important, her brother’s other prediction had come true as well:Katherine’s experiments had produced astonishing results, particularly in thelast six months, breakthroughs that would alter entire paradigms of thinking.Katherine and her brother had agreed to keep her results absolutely secret untilthe implications were more fully understood. One day soon, however, Katherineknew she would publish some of the most transformative scientific revelations inhuman history.A secret lab in a secret museum, she thought, inserting her key card into thePod 5 door. The keypad lit up, and Katherine typed her PIN.The steel door hissed open.The familiar hollow moan was accompanied by the same blast of cold air. Asalways, Katherine felt her pulse rate start to climb.Strangest commute on earth.Steeling herself for the journey, Katherine Solomon glanced at her watch as shestepped into the void. Tonight, however, a troubled thought followed her inside.Where is Peter?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12Capitol police chief Trent Anderson had overseen security in the U.S. CapitolComplex for over a decade. A burly, square-chested man with a chiseled face andred hair, he kept his hair cropped in a buzz cut, giving him an air of militaryauthority. He wore a visible sidearm as a warning to anyone foolish enough toquestion the extent of his authority.Anderson spent the majority of his time coordinating his small army of policeofficers from a high-tech surveillance center in the basement of the Capitol.Here he oversaw a staff of technicians who watched visual monitors, computerreadouts, and a telephone switchboard that kept him in contact with the manysecurity personnel he commanded.This evening had been unusually quiet, and Anderson was pleased. He had beenhoping to catch a bit of the Redskins game on the flat-panel television in hisoffice. The game had just kicked off when his intercom buzzed.“Chief?”Anderson groaned and kept his eyes on the television as he pressed the button.“Yeah.”“We’ve got some kind of disturbance in the Rotunda. I’ve got officers arrivingnow, but I think you’ll want to have a look.”“Right.” Anderson walked into the security nerve center—a compact, neomodernfacility packed with computer monitors. “What have you got?”The technician was cueing a digital video clip on his monitor. “Rotunda eastbalcony camera. Twenty seconds ago.” He played the clip.Anderson watched over the technician’s shoulder.The Rotunda was almost deserted today, dotted with just a few tourists.Anderson’s trained eye went immediately to the one person who was alone andmoving faster than all the others. Shaved head. Green army-surplus jacket.Injured arm in a sling. Slight limp. Slouched posture. Talking on a cell phone.The bald man’s footfalls echoed crisply on the audio feed until, suddenly,arriving at the exact center of the Rotunda, he stopped short, ended his phonecall, and then knelt down as if to tie his shoe. But instead of tying a shoe, hepulled something out of his sling and set it on the floor. Then he stood up andlimped briskly toward the east exit.Anderson eyed the oddly shaped object the man had left behind. What in theworld? It was about eight inches tall and standing vertically. Anderson crouchedcloser to the screen and squinted. That can’t be what it looks like!As the bald man hurried off, disappearing through the east portico, a little boynearby could be heard saying, “Mommy, that man dropped something.” The boydrifted toward the object but suddenly stopped short. After a long, motionlessbeat, he pointed and let out a deafening scream.Instantly, the police chief spun and ran for the door, barking orders as hewent. “Radio all points! Find the bald guy with the sling and detain him! NOW!”Dashing out of the security center, he bounded up the treads of the well-wornstaircase three at a time. The security feed had shown the bald man with thesling leave the Rotunda via the east portico. The shortest route out of thebuilding would therefore take him through the east-west corridor, which was justahead.I can head him off.As he reached the top of the stairs and rounded the corner, Anderson surveyedthe quiet hallway before him. An elderly couple strolled at the far end, hand inhand. Nearby, a blond tourist wearing a blue blazer was reading a guidebook andstudying the mosaic ceiling outside the House chamber.“Excuse me, sir!” Anderson barked, running toward him. “Have you seen a bald manwith a sling on his arm?”The man looked up from his book with a confused expression.“A bald man with a sling!” Anderson repeated more firmly. “Have you seen him?”The tourist hesitated and glanced nervously toward the far eastern end of thehallway. “Uh . . . yes,” he said. “I think he just ran past me . . . to thatstaircase over there.” He pointed down the hall.Anderson pulled out his radio and yelled into it. “All points! The suspect isheaded for the southeast exit. Converge!” He stowed the radio and yanked hissidearm from its holster, running toward the exit.Thirty seconds later, at a quiet exit on the east side of the Capitol, thepowerfully built blond man in the blue blazer stepped into the damp night air.He smiled, savoring the coolness of the evening.Transformation.It had been so easy.Only a minute ago he had limped quickly out of the Rotunda in an army-surpluscoat. Stepping into a darkened alcove, he shed his coat, revealing the blueblazer he wore underneath. Before abandoning his surplus jacket, he pulled ablond wig from the pocket and fit it snugly on his head. Then he stood upstraight, pulled a slim Washington guidebook from his blazer, and stepped calmlyfrom the niche with an elegant gait.Transformation. This is my gift.As Mal’akh’s mortal legs carried him toward his waiting limousine, he arched hisback, standing to his full six-foot-three height and throwing back hisshoulders. He inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his lungs. He could feel thewings of the tattooed phoenix on his chest opening wide.If they only knew my power, he thought, gazing out at the city. Tonight mytransformation will be complete.Mal’akh had played his cards artfully within the Capitol Building, showingobeisance to all the ancient etiquettes. The ancient invitation has beendelivered. If Langdon had not yet grasped his role here tonight, soon he would."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13For Robert Langdon, the Capitol Rotunda—like St. Peter's Basilica—always had away of taking him by surprise. Intellectually, he knew the room was so largethat the Statue of Liberty could stand comfortably inside it, but somehow theRotunda always felt larger and more hallowed than he anticipated, as if therewere spirits in the air. Tonight, however, there was only chaos.Capitol police officers were sealing the Rotunda while attempting to herddistraught tourists away from the hand. The little boy was still crying. Abright light flashed—a tourist taking a photo of the hand—and several guardsimmediately detained the man, taking his camera and escorting him off. In theconfusion, Langdon felt himself moving forward in a trance, slipping through thecrowd, inching closer to the hand.Peter Solomon's severed right hand was standing upright, the flat plane of thedetached wrist skewered down onto the spike of a small wooden stand. Three ofthe fingers were closed in a fist, while the thumb and index finger were fullyextended, pointing up toward the soaring dome.“Everyone back!” an officer called.Langdon was close enough now that he could see dried blood, which had run downfrom the wrist and coagulated on the wooden base. Postmortem wounds don't bleed. . . which means Peter is alive. Langdon didn't know whether to be relieved ornauseated. Peter's hand was removed while he was alive? Bile rose in his throat.He thought of all the times his dear friend had extended this same hand to shakeLangdon's or offer a warm embrace.For several seconds, Langdon felt his mind go blank, like an untuned televisionset broadcasting only static. The first clear image that broke through wasutterly unexpected.A crown . . . and a star.Langdon crouched down, eyeing the tips of Peter's thumb and index finger.Tattoos? Incredibly, the monster who had done this appeared to have tattooedtiny symbols on Peter's fingertips.On the thumb—a crown. On the index finger—a star.This can't be. The two symbols registered instantly in Langdon's mind,amplifying this already horrific scene into something almost otherworldly. Thesesymbols had appeared together many times in history, and always in the sameplace—on the fingertips of a hand. It was one of the ancient world's mostcoveted and secretive icons.The Hand of the Mysteries.The icon was rarely seen anymore, but throughout history it had symbolized apowerful call to action. Langdon strained to comprehend the grotesque artifactnow before him. Someone crafted the Hand of the Mysteries out of Peter's hand?It was unthinkable. Traditionally, the icon was sculpted in stone or wood orrendered as a drawing. Langdon had never heard of the Hand of the Mysteriesbeing fashioned from actual flesh. The concept was abhorrent.“Sir?” a guard said behind Langdon. “Please step back.”Langdon barely heard him. There are other tattoos. Although he could not see thefingertips of the three clenched fingers, Langdon knew these fingertips wouldbear their own unique markings. That was the tradition. Five symbols in total.Through the millennia, the symbols on the fingertips of the Hand of theMysteries had never changed . . . nor had the hand's iconic purpose.The hand represents . . . an invitation.Langdon felt a sudden chill as he recalled the words of the man who had broughthim here. Professor, tonight you are receiving the invitation of your lifetime.In ancient times, the Hand of the Mysteries actually served as the most covetedinvitation on earth. To receive this icon was a sacred summons to join an elitegroup—those who were said to guard the secret wisdom of all the ages. Theinvitation not only was a great honor, but it signified that a master believedyou were worthy to receive this hidden wisdom. The hand of the master extendedto the initiate.“Sir,” the guard said, putting a firm hand on Langdon's shoulder. “I need you toback up right now.”“I know what this means,” Langdon managed. “I can help you.”“Now!” the guard said.“My friend is in trouble. We have to—”Langdon felt powerful arms pulling him up and leading him away from the hand. Hesimply let it happen . . . feeling too off balance to protest.A formal invitation had just been delivered. Someone was summoning Langdon tounlock a mystical portal that would unveil a world of ancient mysteries andhidden knowledge.But it was all madness.Delusions of a lunatic."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14Mal’akh’s stretch limousine eased away from the U.S. Capitol, moving eastwarddown Independence Avenue. A young couple on the sidewalk strained to see throughthe tinted rear windows, hoping to glimpse a VIP.I’m in front, Mal’akh thought, smiling to himself.Mal’akh loved the feeling of power he got from driving this massive car allalone. None of his other five cars offered him what he needed tonight—theguarantee of privacy. Total privacy. Limousines in this city enjoyed a kind ofunspoken immunity. Embassies on wheels. Police officers who worked near CapitolHill were never certain what power broker they might mistakenly pull over in alimousine, and so most simply chose not to take the chance.As Mal’akh crossed the Anacostia River into Maryland, he could feel himselfmoving closer to Katherine, pulled onward by destiny’s gravity. I am beingcalled to a second task tonight . . . one I had not imagined. Last night, whenPeter Solomon told the last of his secrets, Mal’akh had learned of the existenceof a secret lab in which Katherine Solomon had performed miracles—staggeringbreakthroughs that Mal’akh realized would change the world if they were evermade known.Her work will unveil the true nature of all things.For centuries the “brightest minds” on earth had ignored the ancient sciences,mocking them as ignorant superstitions, arming themselves instead with smugskepticism and dazzling new technologies—tools that led them only further fromthe truth. Every generation’s breakthroughs are proven false by the nextgeneration’s technology. And so it had gone through the ages. The more manlearned, the more he realized he did not know.For millennia, mankind had wandered in the darkness . . . but now, as had beenprophesied, there was a change coming. After hurtling blindly through history,mankind had reached a crossroads. This moment had been predicted long ago,prophesied by the ancient texts, by the primeval calendars, and even by thestars themselves. The date was specific, its arrival imminent. It would bepreceded by a brilliant explosion of knowledge . . . a flash of clarity toilluminate the darkness and give mankind a final chance to veer away from theabyss and take the path of wisdom.I have come to obscure the light, Mal’akh thought. This is my role.Fate had linked him to Peter and Katherine Solomon. The breakthroughs KatherineSolomon had made within the SMSC would risk opening floodgates of new thinking,starting a new Renaissance. Katherine’s revelations, if made public, wouldbecome a catalyst that would inspire mankind to rediscover the knowledge he hadlost, empowering him beyond all imagination.Katherine’s destiny is to light this torch.Mine is to extinguish it."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15In total darkness, Katherine Solomon groped for the outer door of her lab.Finding it, she heaved open the lead-lined door and hurried into the small entryroom. The journey across the void had taken only ninety seconds, and yet herheart was pounding wildly. After three years, you’d think I’d be used to that.Katherine always felt relieved to escape the blackness of Pod 5 and step intothis clean, well-lit space.The “Cube” was a massive windowless box. Every inch of the interior walls andceiling was covered with a stiff mesh of titanium-coated lead fiber, giving theimpression of a giant cage built inside a cement enclosure. Dividers of frostedPlexiglas separated the space into different compartments—a laboratory, acontrol room, a mechanical room, a bathroom, and a small research library.Katherine strode briskly into the main lab. The bright and sterile work spaceglistened with advanced quantitative equipment: paired electro encephalographs,a femtosecond comb, a magneto-optical trap, and quantum-indeterminate electronicnoise REGs, more simply known as Random Event Generators.Despite Noetic Science’s use of cutting-edge technologies, the discoveriesthemselves were far more mystical than the cold, high-tech machines that wereproducing them. The stuff of magic and myth was fast becoming reality as theshocking new data poured in, all of it supporting the basic ideology of NoeticScience—the untapped potential of the human mind.The overall thesis was simple: We have barely scratched the surface of ourmental and spiritual capabilities.Experiments at facilities like the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) inCalifornia and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR) hadcategorically proven that human thought, if properly focused, had the ability toaffect and change physical mass. Their experiments were no “spoon-bending”parlor tricks, but rather highly controlled inquiries that all produced the sameextraordinary result: our thoughts actually interacted with the physical world,whether or not we knew it, effecting change all the way down to the subatomicrealm.Mind over matter.In 2001, in the hours following the horrifying events of September 11, the fieldof Noetic Science made a quantum leap forward. Four scientists discovered thatas the frightened world came together and focused in shared grief on this singletragedy, the outputs of thirty-seven different Random Event Generators aroundthe world suddenly became significantly less random. Somehow, the oneness ofthis shared experience, the coalescing of millions of minds, had affected therandomizing function of these machines, organizing their outputs and bringingorder from chaos.The shocking discovery, it seemed, paralleled the ancient spiritual belief in a“cosmic consciousness”—a vast coalescing of human intention that was actuallycapable of interacting with physical matter. Recently, studies in massmeditation and prayer had produced similar results in Random Event Generators,fueling the claim that human consciousness, as Noetic author Lynne McTaggartdescribed it, was a substance outside the confines of the body . . . a highlyordered energy capable of changing the physical world. Katherine had beenfascinated by McTaggart’s book The Intention Experiment, and her global,Web-based study—theintentionexperiment.com—aimed at discovering how humanintention could affect the world. A handful of other progressive texts had alsopiqued Katherine’s interest.From this foundation, Katherine Solomon’s research had vaulted forward, provingthat “focused thought” could affect literally anything—the growth rate ofplants, the direction that fish swam in a bowl, the manner in which cellsdivided in a petri dish, the synchronization of separately automated systems,and the chemical reactions in one’s own body. Even the crystalline structure ofa newly forming solid was rendered mutable by one’s mind; Katherine had createdbeautifully symmetrical ice crystals by sending loving thoughts to a glass ofwater as it froze. Incredibly, the converse was also true: when she sentnegative, polluting thoughts to the water, the ice crystals froze in chaotic,fractured forms.Human thought can literally transform the physical world.As Katherine’s experiments grew bolder, her results became more astounding. Herwork in this lab had proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that “mind over matter”was not just some New Age self-help mantra. The mind had the ability to alterthe state of matter itself, and, more important, the mind had the power toencourage the physical world to move in a specific direction.We are the masters of our own universe.At the subatomic level, Katherine had shown that particles themselves came inand out of existence based solely on her intention to observe them. In a sense,her desire to see a particle . . . manifested that particle. Heisenberg hadhinted at this reality decades ago, and now it had be come a fundamentalprinciple of Noetic Science. In the words of Lynne McTaggart: “Livingconsciousness somehow is the influence that turns the possibility of somethinginto something real. The most essential ingredient in creating our universe isthe consciousness that observes it.”The most astonishing aspect of Katherine’s work, however, had been therealization that the mind’s ability to affect the physical world could beaugmented through practice. Intention was a learned skill. Like meditation,harnessing the true power of “thought” required practice. More important . . .some people were born more skilled at it than others. And throughout history,there had been those few who had become true masters.This is the missing link between modern science and ancient mysticism.Katherine had learned this from her brother, Peter, and now, as her thoughtsturned back to him, she felt a deepening concern. She walked to the lab’sresearch library and peered in. Empty.The library was a small reading room—two Morris chairs, a wooden table, twofloor lamps, and a wall of mahogany bookshelves that held some five hundredbooks. Katherine and Peter had pooled their favorite texts here, writings oneverything from particle physics to ancient mysticism. Their collection hadgrown into an eclectic fusion of new and old . . . of cutting-edge andhistorical. Most of Katherine’s books bore titles like Quantum Consciousness,The New Physics, and Principles of Neural Science. Her brother’s bore older,more esoteric titles like the Kybalion, the Zohar, The Dancing Wu Li Masters,and a translation of the Sumerian tablets from the British Museum.“The key to our scientific future,” her brother often said, “is hidden in ourpast.” A lifelong scholar of history, science, and mysticism, Peter had been thefirst to encourage Katherine to boost her university science education with anunderstanding of early Hermetic philosophy. She had been only nineteen years oldwhen Peter sparked her interest in the link between modern science and ancientmysticism.“So tell me, Kate,” her brother had asked while she was home on vacation duringher sophomore year at Yale. “What are Elis reading these days in theoreticalphysics?”Katherine had stood in her family’s book-filled library and recited herdemanding reading list.“Impressive,” her brother replied. “Einstein, Bohr, and Hawking are moderngeniuses. But are you reading anything older?”Katherine scratched her head. “You mean like . . . Newton?”He smiled. “Keep going.” At twenty-seven, Peter had already made a name forhimself in the academic world, and he and Katherine had grown to savor this kindof playful intellectual sparring.Older than Newton? Katherine’s head now filled with distant names like Ptolemy,Pythagoras, and Hermes Trismegistus. Nobody reads that stuff anymore.Her brother ran a finger down the long shelf of cracked leather bindings and olddusty tomes. “The scientific wisdom of the ancients was staggering . . . modernphysics is only now beginning to comprehend it all.”“Peter,” she said, “you already told me that the Egyptians understood levers andpulleys long before Newton, and that the early alchemists did work on a par withmodern chemistry, but so what? Today’s physics deals with concepts that wouldhave been unimaginable to the ancients.”“Like what?”“Well . . . like entanglement theory, for one!” Subatomic research had nowproven categorically that all matter was interconnected . . . entangled in asingle unified mesh . . . a kind of universal oneness. “You’re telling me theancients sat around discussing entanglement theory?”“Absolutely!” Peter said, pushing his long, dark bangs out of his eyes.“Entanglement was at the core of primeval beliefs. Its names are as old ashistory itself . . . Dharmakaya, Tao, Brahman. In fact, man’s oldest spiritualquest was to perceive his own entanglement, to sense his own interconnectionwith all things. He has always wanted to become ‘one’ with the universe . . . toachieve the state of ‘at-one-ment.’ ” Her brother raised his eyebrows. “To thisday, Jews and Christians still strive for ‘atonement’ . . . although most of ushave forgotten it is actually ‘at-one-ment’ we’re seeking.”Katherine sighed, having forgotten how hard it was to argue with a man so wellversed in history. “Okay, but you’re talking in generalities. I’m talkingspecific physics.”“Then be specific.” His keen eyes challenged her now.“Okay, how about something as simple as polarity—the positive/negative balanceof the subatomic realm. Obviously, the ancients didn’t underst—”“Hold on!” Her brother pulled down a large dusty text, which he dropped loudlyon the library table. “Modern polarity is nothing but the ‘dual world’ describedby Krishna here in the Bhagavad Gita over two thousand years ago. A dozen otherbooks in here, including the Kybalion, talk about binary systems and theopposing forces in nature.”Katherine was skeptical. “Okay, but if we talk about modern discoveries insubatomics—the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, for example—”“Then we must look here,” Peter said, striding down his long bookshelf andpulling out another text. “The sacred Hindu Vendantic scriptures known as theUpanishads.” He dropped the tome heavily on the first. “Heisenberg andSchrödinger studied this text and credited it with helping them formulate someof their theories.”The showdown continued for several minutes, and the stack of dusty books on thedesk grew taller and taller. Finally Katherine threw up her hands infrustration. “Okay! You made your point, but I want to study cutting-edgetheoretical physics. The future of science! I really doubt Krishna or Vyasa hadmuch to say about superstring theory and multidimensional cosmological models.”“You’re right. They didn’t.” Her brother paused, a smile crossing his lips. “Ifyou’re talking superstring theory . . .” He wandered over to the bookshelf yetagain. “Then you’re talking this book here.” He heaved out a colossalleather-bound book and dropped it with a crash onto the desk.“Thirteenth-century translation of the original medieval Aramaic.”“Superstring theory in the thirteenth century?!” Katherine wasn’t buying it.“Come on!”Superstring theory was a brand-new cosmological model. Based on the most recentscientific observations, it suggested the multidimensional universe was made upnot of three . . . but rather of ten dimensions, which all interacted likevibrating strings, similar to resonating violin strings.Katherine waited as her brother heaved open the book, ran through the ornatelyprinted table of contents, and then flipped to a spot near the beginning of thebook. “Read this.” He pointed to a faded page of text and diagrams.Dutifully, Katherine studied the page. The translation was old-fashioned andvery hard to read, but to her utter amazement, the text and drawings clearlyoutlined the exact same universe heralded by modern superstring theory—aten-dimensional universe of resonating strings. As she continued reading, shesuddenly gasped and recoiled. “My God, it even describes how six of thedimensions are entangled and act as one?!” She took a frightened step backward.“What is this book?!”Her brother grinned. “Something I’m hoping you’ll read one day.” He flipped backto the title page, where an ornately printed plate bore three words.The Complete Zohar.Although Katherine had never read the Zohar, she knew it was the fundamentaltext of early Jewish mysticism, once believed so potent that it was reservedonly for the most erudite rabbis.Katherine eyed the book. “You’re saying the early mystics knew their universehad ten dimensions?”“Absolutely.” He motioned to the page’s illustration of ten intertwined circlescalled Sephiroth. “Obviously, the nomenclature is esoteric, but the physics isvery advanced.”Katherine didn’t know how to respond. “But . . . then why don’t more peoplestudy this?”Her brother smiled. “They will.”“I don’t understand.”“Katherine, we have been born into wonderful times. A change is coming. Humanbeings are poised on the threshold of a new age when they will begin turningtheir eyes back to nature and to the old ways . . . back to the ideas in bookslike the Zohar and other ancient texts from around the world. Powerful truth hasits own gravity and eventually pulls people back to it. There will come a daywhen modern science begins in earnest to study the wisdom of the ancients . . .that will be the day that mankind begins to find answers to the big questionsthat still elude him.”That night, Katherine eagerly began reading her brother’s ancient texts andquickly came to understand that he was right. The ancients possessed profoundscientific wisdom. Today’s science was not so much making “discoveries” as itwas making “rediscoveries.” Mankind, it seemed, had once grasped the true natureof the universe . . . but had let go . . . and forgotten.Modern physics can help us remember! This quest had become Katherine’s missionin life—to use advanced science to rediscover the lost wisdom of the ancients.It was more than academic thrill that kept her motivated. Beneath it all was herconviction that the world needed this understanding . . . now more than ever.At the rear of the lab, Katherine saw her brother’s white lab coat hanging onits hook along with her own. Reflexively, she pulled out her phone to check formessages. Nothing. A voice echoed again in her memory. That which your brotherbelieves is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found. Sometimes a legend thatendures for centuries . . . endures for a reason.“No,” Katherine said aloud. “It can’t possibly be real.”Sometimes a legend was just that—a legend."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16Security chief Trent Anderson stormed back toward the Capitol Rotunda, fuming atthe failure of his security team. One of his men had just found a sling and anarmy-surplus jacket in an alcove near the east portico.The goddamn guy walked right out of here!Anderson had already assigned teams to start scanning exterior video, but by thetime they found anything, this guy would be long gone.Now, as Anderson entered the Rotunda to survey the damage, he saw that thesituation had been contained as well as could be expected. All four entrances tothe Rotunda were closed with as inconspicuous a method of crowd control asSecurity had at its disposal—a velvet swag, an apologetic guard, and a sign thatread THIS ROOM TEMPORARILY CLOSED FOR CLEANING. The dozen or so witnesses wereall being herded into a group on the eastern perimeter of the room, where theguards were collecting cell phones and cameras; the last thing Anderson neededwas for one of these people to send a cell-phone snapshot to CNN.One of the detained witnesses, a tall, dark-haired man in a tweed sport coat,was trying to break away from the group to speak to the chief. The man wascurrently in a heated discussion with the guards.“I’ll speak to him in a moment,” Anderson called over to the guards. “For now,please hold everyone in the main lobby until we sort this out.”Anderson turned his eyes now to the hand, which stood at attention in the middleof the room. For the love of God. In fifteen years on security detail for theCapitol Building, he had seen some strange things. But nothing like this.Forensics had better get here fast and get this thing out of my building.Anderson moved closer, seeing that the bloody wrist had been skewered on aspiked wooden base to make the hand stand up. Wood and flesh, he thought.Invisible to metal detectors. The only metal was a large gold ring, whichAnderson assumed had either been wanded or casually pulled off the dead fingerby the suspect as if it were his own.Anderson crouched down to examine the hand. It looked as if it had belonged to aman of about sixty. The ring bore some kind of ornate seal with a two-headedbird and the number 33. Anderson didn’t recognize it. What really caught his eyewere the tiny tattoos on the tips of the thumb and index finger.A goddamn freak show.“Chief?” One of the guards hurried over, holding out a phone. “Personal call foryou. Security switchboard just patched it through.”Anderson looked at him like he was insane. “I’m in the middle of somethinghere,” he growled.The guard’s face was pale. He covered the mouthpiece and whispered. “It’s CIA.”Anderson did a double take. CIA heard about this already?!“It’s their Office of Security.”Anderson stiffened. Holy shit. He glanced uneasily at the phone in the guard’shand.In Washington’s vast ocean of intelligence agencies, the CIA’s Office ofSecurity was something of a Bermuda Triangle—a mysterious and treacherous regionfrom which all who knew of it steered clear whenever possible. With a seeminglyself-destructive mandate, the OS had been created by the CIA for one strangepurpose—to spy on the CIA itself. Like a powerful internal-affairs office, theOS monitored all CIA employees for illicit behavior: misappropriation of funds,selling of secrets, stealing classified technologies, and use of illegal torturetactics, to name a few.They spy on America’s spies.With investigative carte blanche in all matters of national security, the OS hada long and potent reach. Anderson could not fathom why they would be interestedin this incident at the Capitol, or how they had found out so fast. Then again,the OS was rumored to have eyes everywhere. For all Anderson knew, they had adirect feed of U.S. Capitol security cameras. This incident did not match OSdirectives in any way, although the timing of the call seemed too coincidentalto Anderson to be about anything other than this severed hand.“Chief?”The guard was holding the phone out to him like a hot potato. “You needto take this call right now. It’s . . .” He paused and silently mouthed twosyllables. “SA-TO.”Anderson squinted hard at the man. You’ve got to be kidding. He felt his palmsbegin to sweat. Sato is handling this personally?The overlord of the Office of Security—Director Inoue Sato—was a legend in theintelligence community. Born inside the fences of a Japanese internment camp inManzanar, California, in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, Sato was a toughenedsurvivor who had never forgotten the horrors of war, or the perils ofinsufficient military intelligence. Now, having risen to one of the mostsecretive and potent posts in U.S. intelligence work, Sato had proven anuncompromising patriot as well as a terrifying enemy to any who stood inopposition. Seldom seen but universally feared, the OS director cruised the deepwaters of the CIA like a leviathan who surfaced only to devour its prey.Anderson had met Sato face-to-face only once, and the memory of looking intothose cold black eyes was enough to make him count his blessings that he wouldbe having this conversation by telephone.Anderson took the phone and brought it to his lips. “Director Sato,” he said inas friendly a voice as possible. “This is Chief Anderson. How may I—”“There is a man in your building to whom I need to speak immediately.” The OSdirector’s voice was unmistakable—like gravel grating on a chalkboard. Throatcancer surgery had left Sato with a profoundly unnerving intonation and arepulsive neck scar to match. “I want you to find him for me immediately.”That’s all? You want me to page someone? Anderson felt suddenly hopeful thatmaybe the timing of this call was pure coincidence. “Who are you looking for?”“His name is Robert Langdon. I believe he is inside your building right now.”Langdon? The name sounded vaguely familiar, but Anderson couldn’t quite placeit. He was now wondering if Sato knew about the hand. “I’m in the Rotunda at themoment,” Anderson said, “but we’ve got some tourists here . . . hold on.” Helowered his phone and called out to the group, “Folks, is there anyone here bythe name of Langdon?”After a short silence, a deep voice replied from the crowd of tourists. “Yes.I’m Robert Langdon.”Sato knows all. Anderson craned his neck, trying to see who had spoken up.The same man who had been trying to get to him earlier stepped away from theothers. He looked distraught . . . but familiar somehow.Anderson raised the phone to his lips. “Yes, Mr. Langdon is here.”“Put him on,” Sato said coarsely.Anderson exhaled. Better him than me. “Hold on.” He waved Langdon over. AsLangdon approached, Anderson suddenly realized why the name sounded familiar. Ijust read an article about this guy. What the hell is he doing here?Despite Langdon’s six-foot frame and athletic build, Anderson saw none of thecold, hardened edge he expected from a man famous for surviving an explosion atthe Vatican and a manhunt in Paris. This guy eluded the French police . . . inloafers? He looked more like someone Anderson would expect to find hearthside insome Ivy League library reading Dostoyevsky.“Mr. Langdon?”Anderson said, walking halfway to meet him. “I’m Chief Anderson. Ihandle security here. You have a phone call.”“For me?” Langdon’s blue eyes looked anxious and uncertain.Anderson held out the phone. “It’s the CIA’s Office of Security.”“I’ve never heard of it.”Anderson smiled ominously. “Well, sir, it’s heard of you.”Langdon put the phone to his ear. “Yes?”“Robert Langdon?” Director Sato’s harsh voice blared in the tiny speaker, loudenough that Anderson could hear.“Yes?” Langdon replied.Anderson stepped closer to hear what Sato was saying.“This is Director Inoue Sato, Mr. Langdon. I am handling a crisis at the moment,and I believe you have information that can help me.”Langdon looked hopeful. “Is this about Peter Solomon? Do you know where he is?!”Peter Solomon? Anderson felt entirely out of the loop.“Professor,” Sato replied. “I am asking the questions at the moment.”“Peter Solomon is in very serious trouble,” Langdon exclaimed. “Some madmanjust—”“Excuse me,” Sato said, cutting him off.Anderson cringed. Bad move. Interrupting a top CIA official’s line ofquestioning was a mistake only a civilian would make. I thought Langdon wassupposed to be smart.“Listen carefully,” Sato said. “As we speak, this nation is facing a crisis. Ihave been advised that you have information that can help me avert it. Now, I amgoing to ask you again. What information do you possess?”Langdon looked lost. “Director, I have no idea what you’re talking about. AllI’m concerned with is finding Peter and—”“No idea?” Sato challenged.Anderson saw Langdon bristle. The professor now took a more aggressive tone.“No, sir. No damned idea at all.” Anderson winced. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. RobertLangdon had just made a very costly mistake in dealing with Director Sato.Incredibly, Anderson now realized it was too late. To his astonishment, DirectorSato had just appeared on the far side of the Rotunda, and was approaching fastbehind Langdon. Sato is in the building! Anderson held his breath and braced forimpact. Langdon has no idea.The director’s dark form drew closer, phone held to ear, black eyes locked liketwo lasers on Langdon’s back.Langdon clutched the police chief’s phone and felt a rising frustration as theOS director pressed him. “I’m sorry, sir,” Langdon said tersely, “but I can’tread your mind. What do you want from me?”“What do I want from you?” The OS director’s grating voice crackled throughLangdon’s phone, scraping and hollow, like that of a dying man with strepthroat.As the man spoke, Langdon felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned and his eyeswere drawn down . . . directly into the face of a tiny Japanese woman. She had afierce expression, a mottled complexion, thinning hair, tobacco-stained teeth,and an unsettling white scar that sliced horizontally across her neck. Thewoman’s gnarled hand held a cell phone to her ear, and when her lips moved,Langdon heard the familiar raspy voice through his cell phone.“What do I want from you, Professor?” She calmly closed her phone and glared athim. “For starters, you can stop calling me ‘sir.’ ”Langdon stared, mortified. “Ma’am, I . . . apologize. Our connection was poorand—”“Our connection was fine, Professor,” she said. “And I have an extremely lowtolerance for bullshit.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17Director Inoue Sato was a fearsome specimen—a bristly tempest of a woman whostood a mere four feet ten inches. She was bone thin, with jagged features and adermatological condition known as vitiligo, which gave her complexion themottled look of coarse granite blotched with lichen. Her rumpled blue pantsuithung on her emaciated frame like a loose sack, the open-necked blouse doingnothing to hide the scar across her neck. It had been noted by her coworkersthat Sato’s only acquiescence to physical vanity appeared to be that of pluckingher substantial mustache.For over a decade, Inoue Sato had overseen the CIA’s Office of Security. Shepossessed an off-the-chart IQ and chillingly accurate instincts, a combinationwhich girded her with a self-confidence that made her terrifying to anyone whocould not perform the impossible. Not even a terminal diagnosis of aggressivethroat cancer had knocked her from her perch. The battle had cost her one monthof work, half her voice box, and a third of her body weight, but she returned tothe office as if nothing had happened. Inoue Sato appeared to be indestructible.Robert Langdon suspected he was probably not the first to mistake Sato for a manon the phone, but the director was still glaring at him with simmering blackeyes.“Again, my apologies, ma’am,” Langdon said. “I’m still trying to get my bearingshere—the person who claims to have Peter Solomon tricked me into coming to D.C.this evening.” He pulled the fax from his jacket. “This is what he sent meearlier. I wrote down the tail number of the plane he sent, so maybe if you callthe FAA and track the—”Sato’s tiny hand shot out and snatched the sheet of paper. She stuck it in herpocket without even opening it. “Professor, I am running this investigation, anduntil you start telling me what I want to know, I suggest you not speak unlessspoken to.”Sato now spun to the police chief.“Chief Anderson,” she said, stepping entirely too close and staring up at himthrough tiny black eyes, “would you care to tell me what the hell is going onhere? The guard at the east gate told me you found a human hand on the floor. Isthat true?”Anderson stepped to the side and revealed the object in the center of the floor.“Yes, ma’am, only a few minutes ago.”She glanced at the hand as if it were nothing more than a misplaced piece ofclothing. “And yet you didn’t mention it to me when I called?”“I . . . I thought you knew.”“Do not lie to me.”Anderson wilted under her gaze, but his voice remained confident. “Ma’am, thissituation is under control.”“I really doubt that,” Sato said, with equal confidence.“A forensics team is on the way. Whoever did this may have left fingerprints.”Sato looked skeptical. “I think someone clever enough to walk through yoursecurity checkpoint with a human hand is probably clever enough not to leavefingerprints.”“That may be true, but I have a responsibility to investigate.”“Actually, I am relieving you of your responsibility as of this moment. I’mtaking over.”Anderson stiffened. “This is not exactly OS domain, is it?”“Absolutely. This is an issue of national security.”Peter’s hand? Langdon wondered, watching their exchange in a daze. Nationalsecurity? Langdon was sensing that his own urgent goal of finding Peter was notSato’s. The OS director seemed to be on another page entirely.Anderson looked puzzled as well. “National security? With all due respect,ma’am—”“The last I checked,” she interrupted, “I outrank you. I suggest you do exactlyas I say, and that you do it without question.”Anderson nodded and swallowed hard. “But shouldn’t we at least print the fingersto confirm the hand belongs to Peter Solomon?”“I’ll confirm it,” Langdon said, feeling a sickening certainty. “I recognize hisring . . . and his hand.” He paused. “The tattoos are new, though. Someone didthat to him recently.”“I’m sorry?” Sato looked unnerved for the first time since arriving. “The handis tattooed?”Langdon nodded. “The thumb has a crown. And the index finger a star.”Sato pulled out a pair of glasses and walked toward the hand, circling like ashark.“Also,” Langdon said, “although you can’t see the other three fingers, I’mcertain they will have tattoos on the fingertips as well.”Sato looked intrigued by the comment and motioned to Anderson. “Chief, can youlook at the other fingertips for us, please?”Anderson crouched down beside the hand, being careful not to touch it. He puthis cheek near the floor and looked up under the clenched fingertips. “He’sright, ma’am. All of the fingertips have tattoos, although I can’t quite seewhat the other—”“A sun, a lantern, and a key,” Langdon said flatly.Sato turned fully to Langdon now, her small eyes appraising him. “And howexactly would you know that?”Langdon stared back. “The image of a human hand, marked in this way on thefingertips, is a very old icon. It’s known as ‘the Hand of the Mysteries.’ ”Anderson stood up abruptly. “This thing has a name?”Langdon nodded. “It’s one of the most secretive icons of the ancient world.”Sato cocked her head. “Then might I ask what the hell it’s doing in the middleof the U.S. Capitol?”Langdon wished he would wake up from this nightmare. “Traditionally, ma’am, itwas used as an invitation.”“An invitation . . . to what?” she demanded.Langdon looked down at the symbols on his friend’s severed hand. “For centuries,the Hand of the Mysteries served as a mystical summons. Basically, it’s aninvitation to receive secret knowledge—protected wisdom known only to an elitefew.”Sato folded her thin arms and stared up at him with jet-black eyes. “Well,Professor, for someone who claims to have no clue why he’s here . . . you’redoing quite well so far.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18Katherine Solomon donned her white lab coat and began her usual arrivalroutine—her “rounds” as her brother called them.Like a nervous parent checking on a sleeping baby, Katherine poked her head intothe mechanical room. The hydrogen fuel cell was running smoothly, its backuptanks all safely nestled in their racks.Katherine continued down the hall to the data-storage room. As always, the tworedundant holographic backup units hummed safely within theirtemperature-controlled vault. All of my research, she thought, gazing in throughthe three-inch-thick shatterproof glass. Holographic data-storage devices,unlike their refrigerator-size ancestors, looked more like sleek stereocomponents, each perched atop a columnar pedestal.Both of her lab’s holographic drives were synchronized and identical—serving asredundant backups to safeguard identical copies of her work. Most backupprotocols advocated a secondary backup system off-site in case of earthquake,fire, or theft, but Katherine and her brother agreed that secrecy was paramount;once this data left the building to an off-site server, they could no longer becertain it would stay private.Content that everything was running smoothly here, she headed back down thehallway. As she rounded the corner, however, she spotted something unexpectedacross the lab. What in the world? A muted glow was glinting off all theequipment. She hurried in to have a look, surprised to see light emanating frombehind the Plexiglas wall of the control room.He’s here. Katherine flew across the lab, arriving at the control-room door andheaving it open. “Peter!” she said, running in. The plump woman seated at thecontrol room’s terminal jumped up. “Oh my God! Katherine! You scared me!”Trish Dunne—the only other person on earth allowed back here—was Katherine’smetasystems analyst and seldom worked weekends. The twenty-six-year-old redheadwas a genius data modeler and had signed a nondisclosure document worthy of theKGB. Tonight, she was apparently analyzing data on the control room’s plasmawall—a huge flat-screen display that looked like something out of NASA missioncontrol.“Sorry,” Trish said. “I didn’t know you were here yet. I was trying to finish upbefore you and your brother arrived.”“Have you spoken to him? He’s late and he’s not answering his phone.”Trish shook her head. “I bet he’s still trying to figure out how to use that newiPhone you gave him.”Katherine appreciated Trish’s good humor, and Trish’s presence here had justgiven her an idea. “Actually, I’m glad you’re in tonight. You might be able tohelp me with something, if you don’t mind?”“Whatever it is, I’m sure it beats football.”Katherine took a deep breath, calming her mind. “I’m not sure how to explainthis, but earlier today, I heard an unusual story . . .”Trish Dunne didn’t know what story Katherine Solomon had heard, but clearly ithad her on edge. Her boss’s usually calm gray eyes looked anxious, and she hadtucked her hair behind her ears three times since entering the room—a nervous“tell,” as Trish called it. Brilliant scientist. Lousy poker player.“To me,” Katherine said, “this story sounds like fiction . . . an old legend.And yet . . .” She paused, tucking a wisp of hair behind her ears once again.“And yet?”Katherine sighed. “And yet I was told today by a trusted source that the legendis true.”“Okay . . .” Where is she going with this?“I’m going to talk to my brother about it, but it occurs to me that maybe youcan help me shed some light on it before I do. I’d love to know if this legendhas ever been corroborated anywhere else in history.”“In all of history?”Katherine nodded. “Anywhere in the world, in any language, at any point inhistory.”Strange request, Trish thought, but certainly feasible. Ten years ago, the taskwould have been impossible. Today, however, with the Internet, the World WideWeb, and the ongoing digitization of the great libraries and museums in theworld, Katherine’s goal could be achieved by using a relatively simple searchengine equipped with an army of translation modules and some well-chosenkeywords.“No problem,” Trish said. Many of the lab’s research books contained passages inancient languages, and so Trish was often asked to write specialized OpticalCharacter Recognition translation modules to generate English text from obscurelanguages. She had to be the only metasystems specialist on earth who had builtOCR translation modules in Old Frisian, Maek, and Akkadian.The modules would help, but the trick to building an effective search spider wasall in choosing the right key words. Unique but not overly restrictive.Katherine looked to be a step ahead of Trish and was already jotting downpossible keywords on a slip of paper. Katherine had written down several whenshe paused, thought a moment, and then wrote several more. “Okay,” she finallysaid, handing Trish the slip of paper.Trish perused the list of search strings, and her eyes grew wide. What kind ofcrazy legend is Katherine investigating? “You want me to search for all of thesekey phrases?” One of the words Trish didn’t even recognize. Is that evenEnglish? “Do you really think we’ll find all of these in one place? Verbatim?”“I’d like to try.”Trish would have said impossible, but the I-word was banned here. Katherineconsidered it a dangerous mind-set in a field that often transformedpreconceived falsehoods into confirmed truths. Trish Dunne seriously doubtedthis key-phrase search would fall into that category.“How long for results?” Katherine asked.“A few minutes to write the spider and launch it. After that, maybe fifteen forthe spider to exhaust itself.”“So fast?” Katherine looked encouraged.Trish nodded. Traditional search engines often required a full day to crawlacross the entire online universe, find new documents, digest their content, andadd it to their searchable database. But this was not the kind of search spiderTrish would write.“I’ll write a program called a delegator,” Trish explained. “It’s not entirelykosher, but it’s fast. Essentially, it’s a program that orders other people’ssearch engines to do our work. Most databases have a search function builtin—libraries, museums, universities, governments. So I write a spider that findstheir search engines, inputs your keywords, and asks them to search. This way,we harness the power of thousands of engines, working in unison.”Katherine looked impressed. “Parallel processing.”A kind of metasystem. “I’ll call you if I get anything.”“I appreciate it,Trish.” Katherine patted her on the back and headed for thedoor. “I’ll be in the library.”Trish settled in to write the program. Coding a search spider was a menial taskfar below her skill level, but Trish Dunne didn’t care. She would do anythingfor Katherine Solomon. Sometimes Trish still couldn’t believe the good fortunethat had brought her here.You’ve come a long way, baby.Just over a year ago, Trish had quit her job as a metasystems analyst in one ofthe high-tech industry’s many cubicle farms. In her off-hours, she did somefreelance programming and started an industry blog—“Future Applications inComputational Metasystem Analysis”—although she doubted anyone read it. Then oneevening her phone rang.“Trish Dunne?” a woman’s voice asked politely.“Yes, who’s calling, please?”“My name is Katherine Solomon.”Trish almost fainted on the spot. Katherine Solomon? “I just read yourbook—Noetic Science: Modern Gateway to Ancient Wisdom—and I wrote about it on myblog!”“Yes, I know,” the woman replied graciously. “That’s why I’m calling.”Of course it is, Trish realized, feeling dumb. Even brilliant scientists Googlethemselves.“Your blog intrigues me,” Katherine told her. “I wasn’t aware metasystemsmodeling had come so far.”“Yes, ma’am,” Trish managed, starstruck. “Data models are an explodingtechnology with far-reaching applications.”For several minutes, the two women chatted about Trish’s work in metasystems,discussing her experience analyzing, modeling, and predicting the flow ofmassive data fields.“Obviously, your book is way over my head,” Trish said, “but I understood enoughto see an intersection with my metasystems work.”“Your blog said you believe metasystems modeling can transform the study ofNoetics?”“Absolutely. I believe metasystems could turn Noetics into real science.”“Real science?” Katherine’s tone hardened slightly. “As opposed to . . . ?”Oh shit, that came out wrong. “Um, what I meant is that Noetics is more . . .esoteric.”Katherine laughed. “Relax, I’m kidding. I get that all the time.”I’m not surprised, Trish thought. Even the Institute of Noetic Sciences inCalifornia described the field in arcane and abstruse language, defining it asthe study of mankind’s “direct and immediate access to knowledge beyond what isavailable to our normal senses and the power of reason.”The word noetic, Trish had learned, derived from the ancient Greeknous—translating roughly to “inner knowledge” or “intuitive consciousness.”“I’m interested in your metasystems work,” Katherine said, “and how it mightrelate to a project I’m working on. Any chance you’d be willing to meet? I’dlove to pick your brain.”Katherine Solomon wants to pick my brain? It felt like Maria Sharapova hadcalled for tennis tips.The next day a white Volvo pulled into Trish’s driveway and an attractive,willowy woman in blue jeans got out. Trish immediately felt two feet tall.Great, she groaned. Smart, rich, and thin—and I’m supposed to believe God isgood? But Katherine’s unassuming air set Trish instantly at ease.The two of them settled in on Trish’s huge back porch overlooking an impressivepiece of property.“Your house is amazing,” Katherine said.“Thanks. I got lucky in college and licensed some software I’d written.”“Metasystems stuff?”“A precursor to metasystems. Following 9/11, the government was intercepting andcrunching enormous data fields—civilian e-mail, cell phone, fax, text, Websites—sniffing for keywords associated with terrorist communications. So I wrotea piece of software that let them process their data field in a second way . . .pulling from it an additional intelligence product.” She smiled. “Essentially,my software let them take America’s temperature.”“I’m sorry?”Trish laughed. “Yeah, sounds crazy, I know. What I mean is that it quantifiedthe nation’s emotional state. It offered a kind of cosmic consciousnessbarometer, if you will.” Trish explained how, using a data field of the nation’scommunications, one could assess the nation’s mood based on the “occurrencedensity” of certain keywords and emotional indicators in the data field. Happiertimes had happier language, and stressful times vice versa. In the event, forexample, of a terrorist attack, the government could use data fields to measurethe shift in America’s psyche and better advise the president on the emotionalimpact of the event.“Fascinating,” Katherine said, stroking her chin. “So essentially you’reexamining a population of individuals . . . as if it were a single organism.”“Exactly. A metasystem. A single entity defined by the sum of its parts. Thehuman body, for example, consists of millions of individual cells, each withdifferent attributes and different purposes, but it functions as a singleentity.”Katherine nodded enthusiastically. “Like a flock of birds or a school of fishmoving as one. We call it convergence or entanglement.”Trish sensed her famous guest was starting to see the potential of metasystemprogramming in her own field of Noetics. “My software,” Trish explained, “wasdesigned to help government agencies better evaluate and respond appropriatelyto wide-scale crises—pandemic diseases, national tragedies, terrorism, that sortof thing.” She paused. “Of course, there’s always the potential that it could beused in other directions . . . perhaps to take a snapshot of the nationalmind-set and predict the outcome of a national election or the direction thestock market will move at the opening bell.”“Sounds powerful.”Trish motioned to her big house. “The government thought so.”Katherine’s gray eyes focused in on her now. “Trish, might I ask about theethical dilemma posed by your work?”“What do you mean?”“I mean you created a piece of software that can easily be abused. Those whopossess it have access to powerful information not available to everyone. Youdidn’t feel any hesitation creating it?”Trish didn’t blink. “Absolutely not. My software is no different than say . . .a flight simulator program. Some users will practice flying first-aid missionsinto underdeveloped countries. Some users will practice flying passenger jetsinto skyscrapers. Knowledge is a tool, and like all tools, its impact is in thehands of the user.”Katherine sat back, looking impressed. “So let me ask you a hypotheticalquestion.”Trish suddenly sensed their conversation had just turned into a job interview.Katherine reached down and picked up a tiny speck of sand off the deck, holdingit up for Trish to see. “It occurs to me,” she said, “that your metasystems workessentially lets you calculate the weight of an entire sandy beach . . . byweighing one grain at a time.”“Yes, basically that’s right.”“As you know, this little grain of sand has mass. A very small mass, but massnonetheless.”Trish nodded.“And because this grain of sand has mass, it therefore exerts gravity. Again,too small to feel, but there.”“Right.”“Now,” Katherine said, “if we take trillions of these sand grains and let themattract one another to form . . . say, the moon, then their combined gravity isenough to move entire oceans and drag the tides back and forth across ourplanet.”Trish had no idea where this was headed, but she liked what she was hearing.“So let’s take a hypothetical,” Katherine said, discarding the sand grain. “Whatif I told you that a thought . . . any tiny idea that forms in your mind . . .actually has mass? What if I told you that a thought is an actual thing, ameasurable entity, with a measurable mass? A minuscule mass, of course, but massnonetheless. What are the implications?”“Hypothetically speaking? Well, the obvious implications are . . . if a thoughthas mass, then a thought exerts gravity and can pull things toward it.”Katherine smiled. “You’re good. Now take it a step further. What happens if manypeople start focusing on the same thought? All the occurrences of that samethought begin to merge into one, and the cumulative mass of this thought beginsto grow. And therefore, its gravity grows.”“Okay.”“Meaning . . . if enough people begin thinking the same thing, then thegravitational force of that thought becomes tangible . . . and it exerts actualforce.” Katherine winked. “And it can have a measurable effect in our physicalworld.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19Director Inoue Sato stood with her arms folded, her eyes locked skeptically onLangdon as she processed what he had just told her. “He said he wants you tounlock an ancient portal? What am I supposed to do with that, Professor?”Langdon shrugged weakly. He was feeling ill again and tried not to look down athis friend’s severed hand. “That’s exactly what he told me. An ancient portal .. . hidden somewhere in this building. I told him I knew of no portal.”“Then why does he think you can find it?”“Obviously, he’s insane.” He said Peter would point the way. Langdon looked downat Peter’s upstretched finger, again feeling repulsed by his captor’s sadisticplay on words. Peter will point the way. Langdon had already permitted his eyesto follow the pointing finger up to the dome overhead. A portal? Up there?Insane.“This man who called me,” Langdon told Sato, “was the only one who knew I wascoming to the Capitol tonight, so whoever informed you I was here tonight,that’s your man. I recommend—”“Where I got my information is not your concern,” Sato interrupted, voicesharpening. “My top priority at the moment is to cooperate with this man, and Ihave information suggesting you are the only one who can give him what hewants.”“And my top priority is to find my friend,” Langdon replied, frustrated.Sato inhaled deeply, her patience clearly being tested. “If we want to find Mr.Solomon, we have one course of action, Professor—to start cooperating with theone person who seems to know where he is.” Sato checked her watch. “Our time islimited. I can assure you it is imperative we comply with this man’s demandsquickly.”“How?” Langdon asked, incredulous. “By locating and unlocking an ancient portal?There is no portal, Director Sato. This guy’s a lunatic.”Sato stepped close, less than a foot from Langdon. “If I may point this out . .. your lunatic deftly manipulated two fairly smart individuals already thismorning.” She stared directly at Langdon and then glanced at Anderson. “In mybusiness, one learns there is a fine line between insanity and genius. We wouldbe wise to give this man a little respect.”“He cut off a man’s hand!”“My point exactly. That is hardly the act of an uncommitted or uncertainindividual. More important, Professor, this man obviously believes you can helphim. He brought you all the way to Washington—and he must have done it for areason.”“He said the only reason he thinks I can unlock this ‘portal’ is that Peter toldhim I can unlock it,” Langdon countered.“And why would Peter Solomon say that if it weren’t true?”“I’m sure Peter said no such thing. And if he did, then he did so under duress.He was confused . . . or frightened.”“Yes. It’s called interrogational torture, and it’s quite effective. All themore reason Mr. Solomon would tell the truth.” Sato spoke as if she’d hadpersonal experience with this technique. “Did he explain why Peter thinks youalone can unlock the portal?”Langdon shook his head.“Professor, if your reputations are correct, then you and Peter Solomon bothshare an interest in this sort of thing—secrets, historical esoterica,mysticism, and so on. In all of your discussions with Peter, he never oncementioned to you anything about a secret portal in Washington, D.C.?”Langdon could scarcely believe he was being asked this question by ahigh-ranking officer of the CIA. “I’m certain of it. Peter and I talk about somepretty arcane things, but believe me, I’d tell him to get his head examined ifhe ever told me there was an ancient portal hidden anywhere at all. Particularlyone that leads to the Ancient Mysteries.”She glanced up. “I’m sorry? The man told you specifically what this portal leadsto?”“Yes, but he didn’t have to.” Langdon motioned to the hand. “The Hand of theMysteries is a formal invitation to pass through a mystical gateway and acquireancient secret knowledge—powerful wisdom known as the Ancient Mysteries . . . orthe lost wisdom of all the ages.”“So you’ve heard of the secret he believes is hidden here.”“A lot of historians have heard of it.”“Then how can you say the portal does not exist?”“With respect, ma’am, we’ve all heard of the Fountain of Youth and Shangri-la,but that does not mean they exist.”The loud squawk of Anderson’s radio interrupted them.“Chief?” the voice on the radio said.Anderson snatched his radio from his belt. “Anderson here.”“Sir, we’ve completed a search of the grounds. There’s no one here that fits thedescription. Any further orders, sir?”Anderson shot a quick glance at Sato, clearly expecting a reprimand, butDirector Sato seemed uninterested. Anderson moved away from Langdon and Sato,speaking quietly into his radio.Sato’s unwavering focus remained on Langdon. “You’re saying the secret hebelieves is hidden in Washington . . . is a fantasy?”Langdon nodded. “A very old myth. The secret of the Ancient Mysteries ispre-Christian, actually. Thousands of years old.”“And yet it’s still around?”“As are many equally improbable beliefs.” Langdon often reminded his studentsthat most modern religions included stories that did not hold up to scientificscrutiny: everything from Moses parting the Red Sea . . . to Joseph Smith usingmagic eyeglasses to translate the Book of Mormon from a series of gold plates hefound buried in upstate New York. Wide acceptance of an idea is not proof of itsvalidity.“I see. So what exactly are these . . . Ancient Mysteries?”Langdon exhaled. Have you got a few weeks? “In short, the Ancient Mysteriesrefer to a body of secret knowledge that was amassed long ago. One intriguingaspect of this knowledge is that it allegedly enables its practitioners toaccess powerful abilities that lie dormant in the human mind. The enlightenedAdepts who possessed this knowledge vowed to keep it veiled from the massesbecause it was considered far too potent and dangerous for the uninitiated.”“Dangerous in what way?”“The information was kept hidden for the same reason we keep matches fromchildren. In the correct hands, fire can provide illumination . . . but in thewrong hands, fire can be highly destructive.”Sato took off her glasses and studied him. “Tell me, Professor, do you believesuch powerful information could truly exist?”Langdon was not sure how to respond. The Ancient Mysteries had always been thegreatest paradox of his academic career. Virtually every mystical tradition onearth revolved around the idea that there existed arcane knowledge capable ofimbuing humans with mystical, almost godlike, powers: tarot and I Ching gave menthe ability to see the future; alchemy gave men immortality through the fabledPhilosopher’s Stone; Wicca permitted advanced practitioners to cast powerfulspells. The list went on and on.As an academic, Langdon could not deny the historical record of thesetraditions—troves of documents, artifacts, and artwork that, indeed, clearlysuggested the ancients had a powerful wisdom that they shared only throughallegory, myths, and symbols, ensuring that only those properly initiated couldaccess its power. Nonetheless, as a realist and a skeptic, Langdon remainedunconvinced.“Let’s just say I’m a skeptic,” he told Sato. “I have never seen anything in thereal world to suggest the Ancient Mysteries are anything other than legend—arecurring mythological archetype. It seems to me that if it were possible forhumans to acquire miraculous powers, there would be evidence. And yet, so far,history has given us no men with superhuman powers.”Sato arched her eyebrows. “That’s not entirely true.”Langdon hesitated, realizing that for many religious people, there was indeed aprecedent for human gods, Jesus being the most obvious. “Admittedly,” he said,“there are plenty of educated people who believe this empowering wisdom trulyexists, but I’m not yet convinced.”“Is Peter Solomon one of those people?” Sato asked, glancing toward the hand onthe floor.Langdon could not bring himself to look at the hand. “Peter comes from a familylineage that has always had a passion for all things ancient and mystical.”“Was that a yes?” Sato asked.“I can assure you that even if Peter believes the Ancient Mysteries are real, hedoes not believe they are accessible through some kind of portal hidden inWashington, D.C. He understands metaphorical symbolism, which is something hiscaptor apparently does not.”Sato nodded. “So you believe this portal is a metaphor.”“Of course,” Langdon said. “In theory, anyway. It’s a very common metaphor—amystical portal through which one must travel to become enlightened. Portals anddoorways are common symbolic constructs that represent transformative rites ofpassage. To look for a literal portal would be like trying to locate the actualGates of Heaven.”Sato seemed to consider this momentarily. “But it sounds like Mr. Solomon’scaptor believes you can unlock an actual portal.”Langdon exhaled. “He’s made the same error many zealots make—confusing metaphorwith a literal reality.” Similarly, early alchemists had toiled in vain totransform lead into gold, never realizing that lead-to-gold was nothing but ametaphor for tapping into true human potential—that of taking a dull, ignorantmind and transforming it into a bright, enlightened one.Sato motioned to the hand. “If this man wants you to locate some kind of portalfor him, why wouldn’t he simply tell you how to find it? Why all the dramatics?Why give you a tattooed hand?”Langdon had asked himself the same question and the answer was unsettling.“Well, it seems the man we are dealing with, in addition to being mentallyunstable, is also highly educated. This hand is proof that he is well versed inthe Mysteries as well as their codes of secrecy. Not to mention with the historyof this room.”“I don’t understand.”“Everything he has done tonight was done in perfect accordance with ancientprotocols. Traditionally, the Hand of the Mysteries is a sacred invitation, andtherefore it must be presented in a sacred place.”Sato’s eyes narrowed. “This is the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol Building,Professor, not some sacred shrine to ancient mystical secrets.”“Actually, ma’am,” Langdon said, “I know a great number of historians who woulddisagree with you.”At that moment, across town, Trish Dunne was seated in the glow of the plasmawall inside the Cube. She finished preparing her search spider and typed in thefive key phrases Katherine had given her.Here goes nothing.Feeling little optimism, she launched the spider, effectively commencing aworldwide game of Go Fish. At blinding speed, the phrases were now beingcompared to texts all over the world . . . looking for a perfect match.Trish couldn’t help but wonder what this was all about, but she had come toaccept that working with the Solomons meant never quite knowing the entirestory."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20Robert Langdon stole an anxious glance at his wristwatch: 7:58 P.M. The smilingface of Mickey Mouse did little to cheer him up. I’ve got to find Peter. We’rewasting time.Sato had stepped aside for a moment to take a phone call, but now she returnedto Langdon. “Professor, am I keeping you from something?”“No, ma’am,” Langdon said, pulling his sleeve down over his watch. “I’m justextremely concerned about Peter.”“I can understand, but I assure you the best thing you can do to help Peter isto help me understand the mind-set of his captor.”Langdon was not so sure, but he sensed he was not going anywhere until the OSdirector got the information she desired.“A moment ago,” Sato said, “you suggested this Rotunda is somehow sacred to theidea of these Ancient Mysteries?”“Yes, ma’am.”“Explain that to me.”Langdon knew he would have to choose his words sparingly. He had taught forentire semesters on the mystical symbolism of Washington, D.C., and there was analmost inexhaustible list of mystical references in this building alone.America has a hidden past.Every time Langdon lectured on the symbology of America, his students wereconfounded to learn that the true intentions of our nation’s forefathers hadabsolutely nothing to do with what so many politicians now claimed.America’s intended destiny has been lost to history.The forefathers who founded this capital city first named her “Rome.” They hadnamed her river the Tiber and erected a classical capital of pantheons andtemples, all adorned with images of history’s great gods and goddesses—Apollo,Minerva, Venus, Helios, Vulcan, Jupiter. In her center, as in many of the greatclassical cities, the founders had erected an enduring tribute to theancients—the Egyptian obelisk. This obelisk, larger even than Cairo’s orAlexandria’s, rose 555 feet into the sky, more than thirty stories, proclaimingthanks and honor to the demigod forefather for whom this capital city took itsnewer name.Washington.Now, centuries later, despite America’s separation of church and state, thisstate-sponsored Rotunda glistened with ancient religious symbolism. There wereover a dozen different gods in the Rotunda—more than the original Pantheon inRome. Of course, the Roman Pantheon had been converted to Christianity in 609 .. . but this pantheon was never converted; vestiges of its true history stillremained in plain view.“As you may know,” Langdon said, “this Rotunda was designed as a tribute to oneof Rome’s most venerated mystical shrines. The Temple of Vesta.”“As in the vestal virgins?” Sato looked doubtful that Rome’s virginal guardiansof the flame had anything to do with the U.S. Capitol Building.“The Temple of Vesta in Rome,” Langdon said, “was circular, with a gaping holein the floor, through which the sacred fire of enlightenment could be tended bya sisterhood of virgins whose job it was to ensure the flame never went out.”Sato shrugged. “This Rotunda is a circle, but I see no gaping hole in thisfloor.”“No, not anymore, but for years the center of this room had a large openingprecisely where Peter’s hand is now.” Langdon motioned to the floor. “In fact,you can still see the marks in the floor from the railing that kept people fromfalling in.”“What?” Sato demanded, scrutinizing the floor. “I’ve never heard that.”“Looks like he’s right.” Anderson pointed out the circle of iron nubs where theposts had once been. “I’ve seen these before, but I never had any idea why theywere there.”You’re not alone, Langdon thought, imagining the thousands of people every day,including famous lawmakers, who strode across the center of the Rotunda havingno idea there was once a day when they would have plunged down into the CapitolCrypt—the level beneath the Rotunda floor.“The hole in the floor,” Langdon told them, “was eventually covered, but for agood while, those who visited the Rotunda could see straight down to the firethat burned below.”Sato turned. “Fire? In the U.S. Capitol?”“More of a large torch, actually—an eternal flame that burned in the cryptdirectly beneath us. It was supposed to be visible through the hole in thefloor, making this room a modern Temple of Vesta. This building even had its ownvestal virgin—a federal employee called the Keeper of the Crypt—who successfullykept the flame burning for fifty years, until politics, religion, and smokedamage snuffed out the idea.”Both Anderson and Sato looked surprised.Nowadays, the only reminder that a flame once burned here was the four-pointedstar compass embedded in the crypt floor one story below them—a symbol ofAmerica’s eternal flame, which once shed illumination toward the four corners ofthe New World.“So, Professor,” Sato said, “your contention is that the man who left Peter’shand here knew all this?”“Clearly. And much, much more. There are symbols all over this room that reflecta belief in the Ancient Mysteries.”“Secret wisdom,” Sato said with more than a hint of sarcasm in her voice.“Knowledge that lets men acquire godlike powers?”“Yes, ma’am.”“That hardly fits with the Christian underpinnings of this country.”“So it would seem, but it’s true. This transformation of man into God is calledapotheosis. Whether or not you’re aware of it, this theme—transforming man intogod—is the core element in this Rotunda’s symbolism.”“Apotheosis?” Anderson spun with a startled look of recognition.“Yes.” Anderson works here. He knows. “The word apotheosis literally means‘divine transformation’—that of man becoming God. It’s from the ancient Greek:apo—‘to become,’ theos—‘god.’ ”Anderson looked amazed. “Apotheosis means ‘to become God’? I had no idea.”“What am I missing?” Sato demanded.“Ma’am,” Langdon said, “the largest painting in this building is called TheApotheosis of Washington. And it clearly depicts George Washington beingtransformed into a god.”Sato looked doubtful. “I’ve never seen anything of the sort.”“Actually, I’m sure you have.” Langdon raised his index finger, pointingstraight up. “It’s directly over your head.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21The Apotheosis of Washington—a 4,664-square-foot fresco that covers the canopyof the Capitol Rotunda—was completed in 1865 by Constantino Brumidi.Known as “The Michelangelo of the Capitol,” Brumidi had laid claim to theCapitol Rotunda in the same way Michelangelo had laid claim to the SistineChapel, by painting a fresco on the room’s most lofty canvas—the ceiling. LikeMichelangelo, Brumidi had done some of his finest work inside the Vatican.Brumidi, however, immigrated to America in 1852, abandoning God’s largest shrinein favor of a new shrine, the U.S. Capitol, which now glistened with examples ofhis mastery—from the trompe l’oeil of the Brumidi Corridors to the friezeceiling of the Vice President’s Room. And yet it was the enormous image hoveringabove the Capitol Rotunda that most historians considered to be Brumidi’smasterwork.Robert Langdon gazed up at the massive fresco that covered the ceiling. Heusually enjoyed his students’ startled reactions to this fresco’s bizarreimagery, but at the moment he simply felt trapped in a nightmare he had yet tounderstand.Director Sato was standing next to him with her hands on her hips, frowning upat the distant ceiling. Langdon sensed she was having the same reaction many hadwhen they first stopped to examine the painting at the core of their nation.Utter confusion.You’re not alone, Langdon thought. For most people, The Apotheosis of Washingtongot stranger and stranger the longer they looked at it. “That’s GeorgeWashington on the central panel,” Langdon said, pointing 180 feet upward intothe middle of the dome. “As you can see, he’s dressed in white robes, attendedby thirteen maidens, and ascending on a cloud above mortal man. This is themoment of his apotheosis . . . his transformation into a god.”Sato and Anderson said nothing.“Nearby,” Langdon continued, “you can see a strange, anachronistic series offigures: ancient gods presenting our forefathers with advanced knowledge.There’s Minerva giving technological inspiration to our nation’s greatinventors—Ben Franklin, Robert Fulton, Samuel Morse.” Langdon pointed them outone by one. “And over there is Vulcan helping us build a steam engine. Besidethem is Neptune demonstrating how to lay the transatlantic cable. Beside that isCeres, goddess of grain and root of our word cereal; she’s sitting on theMcCormick reaper, the farming breakthrough that enabled this country to become aworld leader in food production. The painting quite overtly portrays ourforefathers receiving great wisdom from the gods.” He lowered his head, lookingat Sato now. “Knowledge is power, and the right knowledge lets man performmiraculous, almost godlike tasks.”Sato dropped her gaze back down to Langdon and rubbed her neck. “Laying a phonecable is a far cry from being a god.”“Perhaps to a modern man,” Langdon replied. “But if George Washington knew thatwe had become a race that possessed the power to speak to one another acrossoceans, fly at the speed of sound, and set foot on our moon, he would assumethat we had become gods, capable of miraculous tasks.” He paused. “In the wordsof futurist Arthur C. Clarke, ‘Any sufficiently advanced technology isindistinguishable from magic.’ ”Sato pursed her lips, apparently deep in thought. She glanced down at the hand,and then followed the direction of the outstretched index finger up into thedome. “Professor, you were told, ‘Peter will point the way.’ Is that correct?”“Yes, ma’am, but—”“Chief,” Sato said, turning away from Langdon, “can you get us a closer look atthe painting?”Anderson nodded. “There’s a catwalk around the interior of the dome.” Langdonlooked way, way up to the tiny railing visible just beneath the painting andfelt his body go rigid. “There’s no need to go up there.” He had experiencedthat seldom-visited catwalk once before, as the guest of a U.S. senator and hiswife, and he had almost fainted from the dizzying height and perilous walkway.“No need?” Sato demanded. “Professor, we have a man who believes this roomcontains a portal that has the potential to make him a god; we have a ceilingfresco that symbolizes the transformation of a man into a god; and we have ahand pointing straight at that painting. It seems everything is urging usupward.”“Actually,” Anderson interjected, glancing up, “not many people know this, butthere is one hexagonal coffer in the dome that actually swings open like aportal, and you can peer down through it and—”“Wait a second,” Langdon said, “you’re missing the point. The portal this man islooking for is a figurative portal—a gateway that doesn’t exist. When he said,‘Peter will point the way,’ he was talking in metaphorical terms. Thispointing-hand gesture—with its index finger and thumb extended upward—is awell-known symbol of the Ancient Mysteries, and it appears all over the world inancient art. This same gesture appears in three of Leonardo da Vinci’s mostfamous encoded masterpieces—The Last Supper, Adoration of the Magi, and SaintJohn the Baptist. It’s a symbol of man’s mystical connection to God.” As above,so below. The madman’s bizarre choice of words was starting to feel morerelevant now.“I’ve never seen it before,” Sato said.Then watch ESPN, Langdon thought, always amused to see professional athletespoint skyward in gratitude to God after a touchdown or home run. He wondered howmany knew they were continuing a pre-Christian mystical tradition ofacknowledging the mystical power above, which, for one brief moment, hadtransformed them into a god capable of miraculous feats.“If it’s of any help,” Langdon said, “Peter’s hand is not the first such hand tomake an appearance in this Rotunda.”Sato eyed him like he was insane. “I beg your pardon?”Langdon motioned to her BlackBerry. “Google ‘George Washington Zeus.’ ”Sato looked uncertain but started typing. Anderson inched toward her, lookingover her shoulder intently.Langdon said, “This Rotunda was once dominated by a massive sculpture of abare-chested George Washington . . . depicted as a god. He sat in the same exactpose as Zeus in the Pantheon, bare chest exposed, left hand holding a sword,right hand raised with thumb and finger extended.”Sato had apparently found an online image, because Anderson was staring at herBlackBerry in shock. “Hold on, that’s George Washington?”“Yes,” Langdon said. “Depicted as Zeus.”“Look at his hand,” Anderson said, still peering over Sato’s shoulder. “Hisright hand is in the same exact position as Mr. Solomon’s.”As I said, Langdon thought, Peter’s hand is not the first to make an appearancein this room. When Horatio Greenough’s statue of a naked George Washington wasfirst unveiled in the Rotunda, many joked that Washington must be reachingskyward in a desperate attempt to find some clothes. As American religiousideals changed, however, the joking criticism turned to controversy, and thestatue was removed, banished to a shed in the east garden. Currently, it madeits home at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, where thosewho saw it had no reason to suspect that it was one of the last vestigial linksto a time when the father of the country had watched over the U.S. Capitol as agod . . . like Zeus watching over the Pantheon.Sato began dialing a number on her BlackBerry, apparently seeing this as anopportune moment to check in with her staff. “What have you got?” She listenedpatiently. “I see . . .” She glanced directly at Langdon, then at Peter’s hand.“You’re certain?” She listened a moment longer. “Okay, thanks.” She hung up andturned back toward Langdon. “My support staff did some research and confirms theexistence of your so-called Hand of the Mysteries, corroborating everything yousaid: five fingertip markings—the star, the sun, the key, the crown, and thelantern—as well as the fact that this hand served as an ancient invitation tolearn secret wisdom.”“I’m glad,” Langdon said.“Don’t be,” she replied curtly. “It appears we’re now at a dead end until youshare whatever it is you’re still not telling me.”“Ma’am?”Sato stepped toward him. “We’ve come full circle, Professor. You’ve told menothing I could not have learned from my own staff. And so I will ask you oncemore. Why were you brought here tonight? What makes you so special? What is itthat you alone know?”“We’ve been through this,” Langdon fired back. “I don’t know why this guy thinksI know anything at all!”Langdon was half tempted to demand how the hell Sato knew that he was in theCapitol tonight, but they’d been through that, too. Sato isn’t talking. “If Iknew the next step,” he told her, “I’d tell you. But I don’t. Traditionally, theHand of the Mysteries is extended by a teacher to a student. And then, shortlyafterward, the hand is followed up with a set of instructions . . . directionsto a temple, the name of the master who will teach you—something! But all thisguy left for us is five tattoos! Hardly—” Langdon stopped short.Sato eyed him. “What is it?”Langdon’s eyes shot back to the hand. Five tattoos. He now realized that what hewas saying might not be entirely true.“Professor?” Sato pressed.Langdon inched toward the gruesome object. Peter will point the way.“Earlier, it crossed my mind that maybe this guy had left an object clenched inPeter’s palm—a map, or a letter, or a set of directions.”“He didn’t,” Anderson said. “As you can see, those three fingers are notclenched tightly.”“You’re right,” Langdon said. “But it occurs to me . . .” He crouched down now,trying to see up under the fingers to the hidden part of Peter’s palm. “Maybeit’s not written on paper.”“Tattooed?” Anderson said.Langdon nodded.“Do you see anything on the palm?” Sato asked.Langdon crouched lower, trying to peer up under the loosely clenched fingers.“The angle is impossible. I can’t—”“Oh, for heaven’s sake,” Sato said, moving toward him. “Just open the damnedthing!”Anderson stepped in front of her. “Ma’am! We should really wait for forensicsbefore we touch—”“I want some answers,” Sato said, pushing past him. She crouched down, edgingLangdon away from the hand.Langdon stood up and watched in disbelief as Sato pulled a pen from her pocket,sliding it carefully under the three clenched fingers. Then, one by one, shepried each finger upward until the hand stood fully open, with its palm visible.She glanced up at Langdon, and a thin smile spread across her face. “Rightagain, Professor.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22Pacing the library, Katherine Solomon pulled back the sleeve of her lab coat andchecked her watch. She was not a woman accustomed to waiting, but at the moment,she felt as if her whole world were on hold. She was waiting for Trish’ssearch-spider results, she was waiting for word from her brother, and also, shewas waiting for a callback from the man who was responsible for this entiretroubling situation.I wish he hadn’t told me, she thought. Normally, Katherine was extremely carefulabout making new acquaintances, and although she had met this man for the firsttime only this afternoon, he had earned her trust in a matter of minutes.Completely.His call had come this afternoon while Katherine was at home enjoying her usualSunday-afternoon pleasure of catching up on the week’s scientific journals.“Ms. Solomon?” an unusually airy voice had said. “My name is Dr. ChristopherAbaddon. I was hoping I might speak to you for a moment about your brother?”“I’m sorry, who is this?” she had demanded. And how did you get my privatecell-phone number?“Dr. Christopher Abaddon?”Katherine did not recognize the name.The man cleared his throat, as if the situation had just become awkward. “Iapologize, Ms. Solomon. I was under the impression your brother had told youabout me. I’m his doctor. Your cell number was listed as his emergency contact.”Katherine’s heart skipped. Emergency contact? “Is something wrong?”“No . . . I don’t think so,” the man said. “Your brother missed an appointmentthis morning, and I can’t reach him on any of his numbers. He never missesappointments without calling, and I’m just a little worried. I hesitated tophone you, but—”“No, no, not at all, I appreciate the concern.” Katherine was still trying toplace the doctor’s name. “I haven’t spoken to my brother since yesterdaymorning, but he probably just forgot to turn on his cell.” Katherine hadrecently given him a new iPhone, and he still hadn’t taken the time to figureout how to use it.“You say you’re his doctor?” she asked. Does Peter have an illness he’s keepingfrom me?There was a weighty pause on the line. “I’m terribly sorry, but I’ve obviouslyjust made a rather serious professional error by calling you. Your brother toldme you were aware of his visits to me, but now I see that’s not the case.”My brother lied to his doctor? Katherine’s concern was now growing steadily. “Ishe sick?”“I’m sorry, Ms. Solomon, doctor-patient confidentiality precludes me fromdiscussing your brother’s condition, and I’ve already said too much by admittinghe is my patient. I’m going to hang up now, but if you hear from him today,please ask him to call me so I know he’s okay.”“Wait!” Katherine said. “Please tell me what’s wrong with Peter!”Dr. Abaddon exhaled, sounding displeased with his mistake. “Ms. Solomon, I canhear you’re upset, and I don’t blame you. I’m sure your brother is fine. He wasin my office just yesterday.”“Yesterday? And he’s scheduled again today? This sounds urgent.”The man heaved a sigh. “I suggest we give him a little more time before we—”“I’m coming by your office right now,” Katherine said, heading for the door.“Where are you located?”Silence.“Dr. Christopher Abaddon?” Katherine said. “I can look up your address myself,or you can simply give it to me. Either way, I’m coming over.”The doctor paused. “If I meet with you, Ms. Solomon, would you please do me thecourtesy of saying nothing to your brother until I’ve had a chance to explain mymisstep?”“That’s fine.”“Thank you. My office is in Kalorama Heights.” He gave her an address.Twenty minutes later, Katherine Solomon was navigating the stately streets ofKalorama Heights. She had phoned all of her brother’s numbers with no reply. Shedid not feel overly concerned about her brother’s whereabouts, and yet, the newsthat he was secretly seeing a doctor . . . was troubling.When Katherine finally located the address, she stared up at the building inconfusion. This is a doctor’s office?The opulent mansion before her had a wrought-iron security fence, electroniccameras, and lush grounds. As she slowed to double-check the address, one of thesecurity cameras rotated toward her, and the gate swung open. Tentatively,Katherine drove up the driveway and parked next to a six-car garage and astretch limo.What kind of doctor is this guy?As she got out of her car, the front door of the mansion opened, and an elegantfigure drifted out onto the landing. He was handsome, exceptionally tall, andyounger than she had imagined. Even so, he projected the sophistication andpolish of an older man. He was impeccably dressed in a dark suit and tie, andhis thick blond hair was immaculately coiffed.“Ms. Solomon, I’m Dr. Christopher Abaddon,” he said, his voice a breathywhisper. When they shook hands, his skin felt smooth and well tended.“Katherine Solomon,” she said, trying not to stare at his skin, which wasunusually smooth and bronzed. Is he wearing makeup?Katherine felt a growing disquiet as she stepped into the home’s beautifullyappointed foyer. Classical music played softly in the background, and it smelledas if someone had burned incense. “This is lovely,” she said, “although Iexpected more of . . . an office.”“I’m fortunate to work out of my home.” The man led her into a living room,where there was a crackling fire. “Please make yourself comfortable. I’m juststeeping some tea. I’ll bring it out, and we can talk.” He strode toward thekitchen and disappeared.Katherine Solomon did not sit. Female intuition was a potent instinct that shehad learned to trust, and something about this place was making her skin crawl.She saw nothing that looked anything like any doctor’s office she had ever seen.The walls of this antique-adorned living room were covered with classical art,primarily paintings with strange mythical themes. She paused before a largecanvas depicting the Three Graces, whose nude bodies were spectacularly renderedin vivid colors.“That’s the original Michael Parkes oil.” Dr. Abaddon appeared without warningbeside her, holding a tray of steaming tea. “I thought we’d sit by the fire?” Heled her over to the living room and offered her a seat. “There’s no reason to benervous.”“I’m not nervous,” Katherine said entirely too quickly.He gave her a reassuring smile. “Actually, it is my business to know when peopleare nervous.”“I beg your pardon?”“I’m a practicing psychiatrist, Ms. Solomon. That is my profession. I’ve beenseeing your brother for almost a year now. I’m his therapist.”Katherine could only stare. My brother is in therapy?“Patients often choose to keep their therapy to themselves,” the man said. “Imade a mistake by calling you, although in my defense, your brother did misleadme.”“I . . . I had no idea.”“I apologize if I made you nervous,” he said, sounding embarrassed. “I noticedyou studying my face when we met, and yes, I do wear makeup.” He touched his owncheek, looking self-conscious. “I have a dermatological condition, which Iprefer to hide. My wife usually puts the makeup on for me, but when she’s nothere, I have to rely on my own heavy touch.”Katherine nodded, too embarrassed to speak.“And this lovely hair . . .” He touched his lush blond mane. “A wig. My skincondition affected my scalp follicles as well, and all my hair jumped ship.” Heshrugged. “I’m afraid my one sin is vanity.”“Apparently mine is rudeness,” Katherine said.“Not at all.” Dr. Abaddon’s smile was disarming. “Shall we start over? Perhapswith some tea?”They sat in front of the fire and Abaddon poured tea. “Your brother got me inthe habit of serving tea during our sessions. He said the Solomons are teadrinkers.”“Family tradition,” Katherine said. “Black, please.”They sipped their tea and made small talk for a few minutes, but Katherine waseager for information about her brother. “Why was my brother coming to you?” sheasked. And why didn’t he tell me? Admittedly, Peter had endured more than hisfair share of tragedy in his life—losing his father at a young age, and then,within a span of five years, burying his only son and then his mother. Even so,Peter had always found a way to cope.Dr. Abaddon took a sip of tea. “Your brother came to me because he trusts me. Wehave a bond beyond that of normal patient and doctor.” He motioned to a frameddocument near the fireplace. It looked like a diploma, until Katherine spied thedouble-headed phoenix.“You’re a Mason?” The highest degree, no less.“Peter and I are brothers of sorts.”“You must have done something important to be invited into the thirty-thirddegree.”“Not really,” he said. “I have family money, and I give a lot of money toMasonic charities.”Katherine now realized why her brother trusted this young doctor. A Mason withfamily money, interested in philanthropy and ancient mythology?Dr. Abaddon had more in common with her brother than she had initially imagined.“When I asked why my brother came to you,” she said, “I didn’t mean why did hechoose you. I meant, why is he seeking the services of a psychiatrist?”Dr. Abaddon smiled. “Yes, I know. I was trying to sidestep the questionpolitely. It’s really not something I should be discussing.” He paused.“Although I must say I’m puzzled that your brother would keep our discussionsfrom you, considering that they relate so directly to your research.”“My research?” Katherine said, taken totally off guard. My brother talks aboutmy research?“Recently, your brother came to me looking for a professional opinion about thepsychological impact of the breakthroughs you are making in your lab.”Katherine almost choked on the tea. “Really? I’m . . . surprised,” she managed.What is Peter thinking? He told his shrink about my work?! Their securityprotocol involved not discussing with anyone what Katherine was working on.Moreover, the confidentiality had been her brother’s idea.“Certainly you are aware, Ms. Solomon, that your brother is deeply concernedabout what will happen when your research goes public. He sees the potential fora significant philosophical shift in the world . . . and he came here to discussthe possible ramifications . . . from a psychological perspective.”“I see,” Katherine said, her teacup now shaking slightly.“The questions we discuss are challenging ones: What happens to the humancondition if the great mysteries of life are finally revealed? What happens whenthose beliefs that we accept on faith . . . are suddenly categorically proven asfact? Or disproved as myth? One could argue that there exist certain questionsthat are best left unanswered.”Katherine could not believe what she was hearing, and yet she kept her emotionsin check. “I hope you don’t mind, Dr. Abaddon, but I’d prefer not to discuss thedetails of my work. I have no immediate plans to make anything public. For thetime being, my discoveries will remain safely locked in my lab.”“Interesting.” Abaddon leaned back in his chair, lost in thought for a moment.“In any event, I asked your brother to come back today because yesterday hesuffered a bit of a break. When that happens, I like to have clients—”“Break?” Katherine’s heart was pounding. “As in breakdown?” She couldn’t imagineher brother breaking down over anything.Abaddon reached out kindly. “Please, I can see I’ve upset you. I’m sorry.Considering these awkward circumstances, I can understand how you might feelentitled to answers.”“Whether I’m entitled or not,” Katherine said, “my brother is all I have left ofmy family. Nobody knows him better than I do, so if you tell me what the hellhappened, maybe I can help you. We all want the same thing—what’s best forPeter.”Dr. Abaddon fell silent for several long moments and then began slowly noddingas if Katherine might have a point. Finally, he spoke. “For the record, Ms.Solomon, if I decide to share this information with you, I would do so onlybecause I think your insights might help me assist your brother.”“Of course.”Abaddon leaned forward, putting his elbows on his knees. “Ms. Solomon, as longas I’ve been seeing your brother, I’ve sensed in him a deep struggle withfeelings of guilt. I’ve never pressed him on it because that’s not why he comesto me. And yet yesterday, for a number of reasons, I finally asked him aboutit.” Abaddon locked eyes with her. “Your brother opened up, rather dramaticallyand unexpectedly. He told me things I had not expected to hear . . . includingeverything that happened the night your mother died.”Christmas Eve—almost exactly ten years ago. She died in my arms.“He told me your mother was murdered during a robbery attempt at your home? Aman broke in looking for something he believed your brother was hiding?”“That’s correct.”Abaddon’s eyes were appraising her. “Your brother said he shot the man dead?”“Yes.”Abaddon stroked his chin. “Do you recall what the intruder was looking for whenhe broke into your home?”Katherine had tried in vain for ten years to block out the memory. “Yes, hisdemand was very specific. Unfortunately, none of us knew what he was talkingabout. His demand never made sense to any of us.”“Well, it made sense to your brother.”“What?” Katherine sat up.“At least according to the story he told me yesterday, Peter knew exactly whatthe intruder was looking for. And yet your brother did not want to hand it over,so he pretended not to understand.”“That’s absurd. Peter couldn’t possibly have known what the man wanted. Hisdemands made no sense!”“Interesting.” Dr. Abaddon paused and took a few notes. “As I mentioned,however, Peter told me he did know. Your brother believes if he had onlycooperated with the intruder, maybe your mother would be alive today. Thisdecision is the source of all his guilt.”Katherine shook her head. “That’s crazy . . .”Abaddon slumped, looking troubled. “Ms. Solomon, this has been useful feedback.As I feared, your brother seems to have had a little break with reality. I mustadmit, I was afraid this might be the case. That’s why I asked him to come backtoday. These delusional episodes are not uncommon when they relate to traumaticmemories.”Katherine shook her head again. “Peter is far from delusional, Dr. Abaddon.”“I would agree, except . . .”“Except what?”“Except that his recounting of the attack was just the beginning . . . a tinyfraction of the long and far-fetched tale he told me.”Katherine leaned forward in her seat. “What did Peter tell you?”Abaddon gave a sad smile. “Ms. Solomon, let me ask you this. Has your brotherever discussed with you what he believes is hidden here in Washington, D.C. . .. or the role he believes he plays in protecting a great treasure . . . of lostancient wisdom?”Katherine’s jaw fell open. “What in the world are you talking about?”Dr. Abaddon heaved a long sigh. “What I am about to tell you will be a bitshocking, Katherine.” He paused and locked eyes with her. “But it will beimmeasurably helpful if you can tell me anything you may know about it.” Hereached for her cup. “More tea?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23Another tattoo.Langdon crouched anxiously beside Peter’s open palm and examined the seven tinysymbols that had been hidden beneath the lifeless clenched fingers.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_003_r1.jpg]“They appear to be numbers,” Langdon said, surprised. “Although I don’trecognize them.”“The first is a Roman numeral,” Anderson said.“Actually, I don’t think so,” Langdon corrected. “The Roman numeral I-I-I-Xdoesn’t exist. It would be written V-I-I.”“How about the rest of it?” Sato asked.“I’m not sure. It looks like eight-eight-five in Arabic numbers.”“Arabic?” Anderson asked. “They look like normal numbers.”“Our normal numbers are Arabic.” Langdon had become so accustomed to clarifyingthis point for his students that he’d actually prepared a lecture about thescientific advances made by early Middle Eastern cultures, one of them being ourmodern numbering system, whose advantages over Roman numerals included‘positional notation’ and the invention of the number zero. Of course, Langdonalways ended this lecture with a reminder that Arab culture had also givenmankind the word al-kuhl—the favorite beverage of Harvard freshmen—known asalcohol.Langdon scrutinized the tattoo, feeling puzzled. “And I’m not even sure aboutthe eight-eight-five. The rectilinear writing looks unusual. Those may not benumbers.”“Then what are they? Sato asked.“I’m not sure. The whole tattoo looks almost . . . runic.”“Meaning?” Sato asked.“Runic alphabets are composed solely of straight lines. Their letters are calledrunes and were often used for carving in stone because curves were too difficultto chisel.”“If these are runes,” Sato said, “what is their meaning?”Langdon shook his head. His expertise extended only to the most rudimentaryrunic alphabet—Futhark—a third-century Teutonic system, and this was notFuthark. “To be honest, I’m not even sure these are runes. You’d need to ask aspecialist. There are dozens of different forms—Hälsinge, Manx, the ‘dotted’Stungnar—”“Peter Solomon is a Mason, is he not?”Langdon did a double take. “Yes, but what does that have to do with this?” Hestood up now, towering over the tiny woman.“You tell me. You just said that runic alphabets are used for stone carvings,and it is my understanding that the original Freemasons were stone craftsmen. Imention this only because when I asked my office to search for a connectionbetween the Hand of the Mysteries and Peter Solomon, their search returned onelink in particular.” She paused, as if to emphasize the importance of herfinding. “The Masons.”Langdon exhaled, fighting the impulse to tell Sato the same thing he constantlytold his students: “Google” is not a synonym for “research.” In these days ofmassive, worldwide keyword searches, it seemed everything was linked toeverything. The world was becoming one big entangled web of information that wasgetting denser every day.Langdon maintained a patient tone. “I’m not surprised the Masons appeared inyour staff’s search. Masons are a very obvious link between Peter Solomon andany number of esoteric topics.”“Yes,” Sato said, “which is another reason I have been surprised this eveningthat you have not yet mentioned the Masons. After all, you’ve been talking aboutsecret wisdom protected by an enlightened few. That sounds very Masonic, does itnot?”“It does . . . and it also sounds very Rosicrucian, Kabbalistic, Alumbradian,and any number of other esoteric groups.”“But Peter Solomon is a Mason—a very powerful Mason, at that. It seems theMasons would come to mind if we were talking about secrets. Heaven knows theMasons love their secrets.”Langdon could hear the distrust in her voice, and he wanted no part of it. “Ifyou want to know anything about the Masons, you would be far better served toask a Mason.”“Actually,” Sato said, “I’d prefer to ask someone I can trust.”Langdon found the comment both ignorant and offensive. “For the record, ma’am,the entire Masonic philosophy is built on honesty and integrity. Masons areamong the most trustworthy men you could ever hope to meet.”“I have seen persuasive evidence to the contrary.”Langdon was liking Director Sato less and less with each passing moment. He hadspent years writing about the Masons’ rich tradition of metaphorical iconographyand symbols, and knew that Masons had always been one of the most unfairlymaligned and misunderstood organizations in the world. Regularly accused ofeverything from devil worship to plotting a one-world government, the Masonsalso had a policy of never responding to their critics, which made them an easytarget.“Regardless,” Sato said, her tone biting, “we are again at an impasse, Mr.Langdon. It seems to me there is either something you are missing . . . orsomething you are not telling me. The man we’re dealing with said that PeterSolomon chose you specifically.” She leveled a cold stare at Langdon. “I thinkit’s time we move this conversation to CIA headquarters. Maybe we’ll have moreluck there.”Sato’s threat barely registered with Langdon. She had just said something thathad lodged in his mind. Peter Solomon chose you. The comment, combined with themention of Masons, had hit Langdon strangely. He looked down at the Masonic ringon Peter’s finger. The ring was one of Peter’s most prized possessions—a Solomonfamily heirloom that bore the symbol of the double-headed phoenix—the ultimatemystical icon of Masonic wisdom. The gold glinted in the light, sparking anunexpected memory.Langdon gasped, recalling the eerie whisper of Peter’s captor: It really hasn’tdawned on you yet, has it? Why you were chosen?Now, in one terrifying moment, Langdon’s thoughts snapped into focus and the foglifted.All at once, Langdon’s purpose here was crystal clear.Ten miles away, driving south on Suitland Parkway, Mal’akh heard a distinctivevibration on the seat beside him. It was Peter Solomon’s iPhone, which hadproven a powerful tool today. The visual caller ID now displayed the image of anattractive middle-aged woman with long black hair.INCOMING CALL—KATHERINE SOLOMONMal’akh smiled, ignoring the call. Destiny pulls me closer.He had lured Katherine Solomon to his home this afternoon for one reason only—todetermine if she had information that could assist him . . . perhaps a familysecret that might help Mal’akh locate what he sought. Clearly, however,Katherine’s brother had told her nothing of what he had been guarding all theseyears.Even so, Mal’akh had learned something else from Katherine. Something that hasearned her a few extra hours of life today. Katherine had confirmed for him thatall of her research was in one location, safely locked inside her lab.I must destroy it.Katherine’s research was poised to open a new door of understanding, and oncethe door was opened even a crack, others would follow. It would just be a matterof time before everything changed. I cannot let that happen. The world must stayas it is . . . adrift in ignorant darkness.The iPhone beeped, indicating Katherine had left a voice mail. Mal’akh retrievedit.“Peter, it’s me again.” Katherine’s voice sounded concerned. “Where are you? I’mstill thinking about my conversation with Dr. Abaddon . . . and I’m worried. Iseverything okay? Please call me. I’m at the lab.”The voice mail ended.Mal’akh smiled. Katherine should worry less about her brother, and more aboutherself. He turned off Suitland Parkway onto Silver Hill Road. Less than a milelater, in the darkness, he spotted the faint outline of the SMSC nestled in thetrees off the highway to his right. The entire complex was surrounded by a highrazor-wire fence.A secure building? Mal’akh chuckled to himself. I know someone who will open thedoor for me."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24The revelation crashed over Langdon like a wave.I know why I am here.Standing in the center of the Rotunda, Langdon felt a powerful urge to turn andrun away . . . from Peter’s hand, from the shining gold ring, from thesuspicious eyes of Sato and Anderson. Instead, he stood dead still, clingingmore tightly to the leather daybag that hung on his shoulder. I’ve got to getout of here.His jaw clenched as his memory began replaying the scene from that cold morning,years ago in Cambridge. It was six A.M. and Langdon was entering his classroomas he always did following his ritual morning laps in the Harvard Pool. Thefamiliar smells of chalk dust and steam heat greeted him as he crossed thethreshold. He took two steps toward his desk but stopped short.A figure was waiting there for him—an elegant gentleman with an aquiline faceand regal gray eyes.“Peter?” Langdon stared in shock.Peter Solomon’s smile flashed white in the dimly lit room. “Good morning,Robert. Surprised to see me?” His voice was soft, and yet there was power there.Langdon hurried over and warmly shook his friend’s hand. “What in the world is aYale blue blood doing on the Crimson campus before dawn?”“Covert mission behind enemy lines,” Solomon said, laughing. He motioned toLangdon’s trim waistline. “Laps are paying off. You’re in good shape.”“Just trying to make you feel old,” Langdon said, toying with him. “It’s greatto see you, Peter. What’s up?”“Short business trip,” the man replied, glancing around the deserted classroom.“I’m sorry to drop in on you like this, Robert, but I have only a few minutes.There’s something I needed to ask you . . . in person. A favor.”That’s a first. Langdon wondered what a simple college professor could possiblydo for the man who had everything. “Anything at all,” he replied, pleased forany opportunity to do something for someone who had given him so much,especially when Peter’s life of good fortune had also been marred by so muchtragedy.Solomon lowered his voice. “I was hoping you would consider looking aftersomething for me.”Langdon rolled his eyes. “Not Hercules, I hope.” Langdon had once agreed to takecare of Solomon’s hundred-fifty-pound mastiff, Hercules, during Solomon’stravels. While at Langdon’s home, the dog apparently had become homesick for hisfavorite leather chew toy and had located a worthy substitute in Langdon’sstudy—an original vellum, hand-calligraphed, illuminated Bible from the 1600s.Somehow “bad dog” didn’t quite seem adequate.“You know, I’m still searching for a replacement,” Solomon said, smilingsheepishly.“Forget it. I’m glad Hercules got a taste of religion.”Solomon chuckled but seemed distracted. “Robert, the reason I came to see you isI’d like you to keep an eye on something that is quite valuable to me. Iinherited it a while back, but I’m no longer comfortable leaving it in my homeor in my office.”Langdon immediately felt uncomfortable. Anything “quite valuable” in PeterSolomon’s world had to be worth an absolute fortune. “How about a safe-depositbox?” Doesn’t your family have stock in half the banks in America?“That would involve paperwork and bank employees; I’d prefer a trusted friend.And I know you can keep secrets.” Solomon reached in his pocket and pulled out asmall package, handing it to Langdon.Considering the dramatic preamble, Langdon had expected something moreimpressive. The package was a small cube-shaped box, about three inches square,wrapped in faded brown packing paper and tied with twine. From the package’sheavy weight and size, it felt like its contents must be rock or metal. This isit? Langdon turned the box in his hands, now noticing the twine had beencarefully secured on one side with an embossed wax seal, like an ancient edict.The seal bore a double-headed phoenix with the number 33 emblazoned on itschest—the traditional symbol of the highest degree of Freemasonry.“Really, Peter,” Langdon said, a lopsided grin creeping across his face. “You’rethe Worshipful Master of a Masonic lodge, not the pope. Sealing packages withyour ring?”Solomon glanced down at his gold ring and gave a chuckle. “I didn’t seal thispackage, Robert. My great-grandfather did. Almost a century ago.”Langdon’s head snapped up. “What?!”Solomon held up his ring finger. “This Masonic ring was his. After that, it wasmy grandfather’s, then my father’s . . . and eventually mine.”Langdon held up the package. “Your great-grandfather wrapped this a century agoand nobody has opened it?”“That’s right.”“But . . . why not?”Solomon smiled. “Because it’s not time.”Langdon stared. “Time for what?”“Robert, I know this will sound odd, but the less you know, the better. Just putthis package somewhere safe, and please tell no one I gave it to you.”Langdon searched his mentor’s eyes for a glint of playfulness. Solomon had apropensity for dramatics, and Langdon wondered if he wasn’t being played a bithere. “Peter, are you sure this isn’t just a clever ploy to make me think I’vebeen entrusted with some kind of ancient Masonic secret so I’ll be curious anddecide to join?”“The Masons do not recruit, Robert, you know that. Besides, you’ve already toldme you’d prefer not to join.”This was true. Langdon had great respect for Masonic philosophy and symbolism,and yet he had decided never to be initiated; the order’s vows of secrecy wouldprevent him from discussing Freemasonry with his students. It had been for thissame reason that Socrates had refused to formally participate in the EleusinianMysteries.As Langdon now regarded the mysterious little box and its Masonic seal, he couldnot help but ask the obvious question. “Why not entrust this to one of yourMasonic brothers?”“Let’s just say I have an instinct it would be safer stored outside thebrotherhood. And please don’t let the size of this package fool you. If what myfather told me is correct, then it contains something of substantial power.” Hepaused. “A talisman, of sorts.”Did he say a talisman? By definition, a talisman was an object with magicalpowers. Traditionally, talismans were used for bringing luck, warding off evilspirits, or aiding in ancient rituals. “Peter, you do realize that talismanswent out of vogue in the Middle Ages, right?”Peter laid a patient hand on Langdon’s shoulder. “I know how this sounds,Robert. I’ve known you a long time, and your skepticism is one of your greateststrengths as an academic. It is also your greatest weakness. I know you wellenough to know you’re not a man I can ask to believe . . . only to trust. So nowI am asking you to trust me when I tell you this talisman is powerful. I wastold it can imbue its possessor with the ability to bring order from chaos.”Langdon could only stare. The idea of “order from chaos” was one of the greatMasonic axioms. Ordo ab chao. Even so, the claim that a talisman could impartany power at all was absurd, much less the power to bring order from chaos.“This talisman,” Solomon continued, “would be dangerous in the wrong hands, andunfortunately, I have reason to believe powerful people want to steal it fromme.” His eyes were as serious as Langdon could ever recall. “I would like you tokeep it safe for me for a while. Can you do that?”That night, Langdon sat alone at his kitchen table with the package and tried toimagine what could possibly be inside. In the end, he simply chalked it up toPeter’s eccentricity and locked the package in his library’s wall safe,eventually forgetting all about it.That was . . . until this morning.The phone call from the man with the southern accent.“Oh, Professor, I almost forgot!” the assistant had said after giving Langdonthe specifics of his travel arrangements to D.C. “There is one more thing Mr.Solomon requested.”“Yes?” Langdon replied, his mind already moving to the lecture he had justagreed to give.“Mr. Solomon left a note here for you.” The man began reading awkwardly, as iftrying to decipher Peter’s penmanship. “‘Please ask Robert . . . to bring . . .the small, sealed package I gave him many years ago.’ ” The man paused. “Doesthis make any sense to you?”Langdon felt surprised as he recalled the small box that had been sitting in hiswall safe all this time. “Actually, yes. I know what Peter means.”“And you can bring it?”“Of course. Tell Peter I’ll bring it.”“Wonderful.” The assistant sounded relieved. “Enjoy your speech tonight. Safetravels.”Before leaving home, Langdon had dutifully retrieved the wrapped package fromthe back of his safe and placed it in his shoulder bag.Now he was standing in the U.S. Capitol, feeling certain of only one thing.Peter Solomon would be horrified to know how badly Langdon had failed him."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25My God, Katherine was right. As usual.Trish Dunne stared in amazement at the search-spider results that werematerializing on the plasma wall before her. She had doubted the search wouldturn up any results at all, but in fact, she now had over a dozen hits. And theywere still coming in.One entry in particular looked quite promising.Trish turned and shouted in the direction of the library. “Katherine? I thinkyou’ll want to see this!”It had been a couple of years since Trish had run a search spider like this, andtonight’s results astounded her. A few years ago, this search would have been adead end. Now, however, it seemed that the quantity of searchable digitalmaterial in the world had exploded to the point where someone could findliterally anything. Incredibly, one of the keywords was a word Trish had nevereven heard before . . . and the search even found that.Katherine rushed through the control-room door. “What have you got?”“A bunch of candidates.” Trish motioned to the plasma wall. “Every one of thesedocuments contains all of your key phrases verbatim.”Katherine tucked her hair behind her ear and scanned the list.“Before you get too excited,” Trish added, “I can assure you that most of thesedocuments are not what you’re looking for. They’re what we call black holes.Look at the file sizes. Absolutely enormous. They’re things like compressedarchives of millions of e-mails, giant unabridged encyclopedia sets, globalmessage boards that have been running for years, and so forth. By virtue oftheir size and diverse content, these files contain so many potential keywordsthat they suck in any search engine that comes anywhere near them.”Katherine pointed to one of the entries near the top of the list. “How aboutthat one?”Trish smiled. Katherine was a step ahead, having found the sole file on the listthat had a small file size. “Good eyes. Yeah, that’s really our only candidateso far. In fact, that file’s so small it can’t be more than a page or so.”“Open it.” Katherine’s tone was intense.Trish could not imagine a one-page document containing all the strange searchstrings Katherine had provided. Nonetheless, when she clicked and opened thedocument, the key phrases were there . . . crystal clear and easy to spot in thetext.Katherine strode over, eyes riveted to the plasma wall. “This document is . . .redacted?”Trish nodded. “Welcome to the world of digitized text.”Automatic redaction had become standard practice when offering digitizeddocuments. Redaction was a process wherein a server allowed a user to search theentire text, but then revealed only a small portion of it—a teaser of sorts—onlythat text immediately flanking the requested keywords. By omitting the vastmajority of the text, the server avoided copyright infringement and also sentthe user an intriguing message: I have the information you’re searching for, butif you want the rest of it, you’ll have to buy it from me.“As you can see,” Trish said, scrolling through the heavily abridged page, “thedocument contains all of your key phrases.”Katherine stared up at the redaction in silence.Trish gave her a minute and then scrolled back to the top of the page. Each ofKatherine’s key phrases was underlined in capital letters and accompanied by asmall sample of teaser text—the two words that appeared on either side of therequested phrase.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_004_r1.jpg]image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_005_r1.jpg]Trish could not imagine what this document was referring to. And what the heckis a “symbolon”?Katherine stepped eagerly toward the screen. “Where did this document come from?Who wrote it?”Trish was already working on it. “Give me a second. I’m trying to chase down thesource.”“I need to know who wrote this,” Katherine repeated, her voice intense. “I needto see the rest of it.”“I’m trying,” Trish said, startled by the edge in Katherine’s tone.Strangely, the file’s location was not displaying as a traditional Web addressbut rather as a numeric Internet Protocol address. “I can’t unmask the IP,”Trish said. “The domain name’s not coming up. Hold on.” She pulled up herterminal window. “I’ll run a traceroute.”Trish typed the sequence of commands to ping all the “hops” between her controlroom’s machine and whatever machine was storing this document.“Tracing now,” she said, executing the command.Traceroutes were extremely fast, and a long list of network devices appearedalmost instantly on the plasma wall. Trish scanned down . . . down . . . throughthe path of routers and switches that connected her machine to . . .What the hell? Her trace had stopped before reaching the document’s server. Herping, for some reason, had hit a network device that swallowed it rather thanbouncing it back. “It looks like my traceroute got blocked,” Trish said. Is thateven possible?“Run it again.”Trish launched another traceroute and got the same result. “Nope. Dead end. It’slike this document is on a server that is untraceable.” She looked at the lastfew hops before the dead end. “I can tell you, though, it’s located somewhere inthe D.C. area.”“You’re kidding.”“Not surprising,” Trish said. “These spider programs spiral out geographically,meaning the first results are always local. Besides, one of your search stringswas ‘Washington, D.C.’ ”“How about a ‘who is’ search?” Katherine prompted. “Wouldn’t that tell you whoowns the domain?”A bit lowbrow, but not a bad idea. Trish navigated to the “who is” database andran a search for the IP, hoping to match the cryptic numbers to an actual domainname. Her frustration was now tempered by rising curiosity. Who has thisdocument? The “who is” results appeared quickly, showing no match, and Trishheld up her hands in defeat. “It’s like this IP address doesn’t exist. I can’tget any information about it at all.”“Obviously the IP exists. We’ve just searched a document that’s stored there!”True. And yet whoever had this document apparently preferred not to share his orher identity. “I’m not sure what to tell you. Systems traces aren’t really mything, and unless you want to call in someone with hacking skills, I’m at aloss.”“Do you know someone?”Trish turned and stared at her boss. “Katherine, I was kidding. It’s not exactlya great idea.”“But it is done?” She checked her watch.“Um, yeah . . . all the time. Technically it’s pretty easy.”“Who do you know?”“Hackers?” Trish laughed nervously. “Like half the guys at my old job.”“Anyone you trust?”Is she serious? Trish could see Katherine was dead serious. “Well, yeah,” shesaid hurriedly. “I know this one guy we could call. He was our systems securityspecialist—serious computer geek. He wanted to date me, which kind of sucked,but he’s a good guy, and I’d trust him. Also, he does freelance.”“Can he be discreet?”“He’s a hacker. Of course he can be discreet. That’s what he does. But I’m surehe’d want at least a thousand bucks to even look—”“Call him. Offer him double for fast results.”Trish was not sure what made her more uncomfortable—helping Katherine Solomonhire a hacker . . . or calling a guy who probably still found it impossible tobelieve a pudgy, redheaded metasystems analyst would rebuff his romanticadvances. “You’re sure about this?”“Use the phone in the library,” Katherine said. “It’s got a blocked number. Andobviously don’t use my name.”“Right.” Trish headed for the door but paused when she heard Katherine’s iPhonechirp. With luck, the incoming text message might be information that wouldgrant Trish a reprieve from this distasteful task. She waited as Katherinefished the iPhone from her lab coat’s pocket and eyed the screen.Katherine Solomon felt a wave of relief to see the name on her iPhone.At last.PETER SOLOMON“It’s a text message from my brother,” she said, glancing over at Trish.Trish looked hopeful. “So maybe we should ask him about all this . . . before wecall a hacker?”Katherine eyed the redacted document on the plasma wall and heard Dr. Abaddon’svoice. That which your brother believes is hidden in D.C. . . . it can be found.Katherine had no idea what to believe anymore, and this document representedinformation about the far-fetched ideas with which Peter had apparently becomeobsessed.Katherine shook her head. “I want to know who wrote this and where it’s located.Make the call.”Trish frowned and headed for the door.Whether or not this document would be able to explain the mystery of what herbrother had told Dr. Abaddon, there was at least one mystery that had beensolved today. Her brother had finally learned how to use the text-messagingfeature on the iPhone Katherine had given him.“And alert the media,” Katherine called after Trish. “The great Peter Solomonjust sent his first text message.”In a strip-mall parking lot across the street from the SMSC, Mal’akh stoodbeside his limo, stretching his legs and waiting for the phone call he knewwould be coming. The rain had stopped, and a winter moon had started to breakthrough the clouds. It was the same moon that had shone down on Mal’akh throughthe oculus of the House of the Temple three months ago during his initiation.The world looks different tonight.As he waited, his stomach growled again. His two-day fast, althoughuncomfortable, was critical to his preparation. Such were the ancient ways. Soonall physical discomforts would be inconsequential.As Mal’akh stood in the cold night air, he chuckled to see that fate haddeposited him, rather ironically, directly in front of a tiny church. Here,nestled between Sterling Dental and a minimart, was a tiny sanctuary.LORD’S HOUSE OF GLORY.Mal’akh gazed at the window, which displayed part of the church’s doctrinalstatement: WE BELIEVE THAT JESUS CHRIST WAS BEGOTTEN BY THE HOLY SPIRIT, ANDBORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY, AND IS BOTH TRUE MAN AND GOD.Mal’akh smiled. Yes, Jesus is indeed both—man and God—but a virgin birth is notthe prerequisite for divinity. That is not how it happens.The ring of a cell phone cut the night air, quickening his pulse. The phone thatwas now ringing was Mal’akh’s own—a cheap disposable phone he had purchasedyesterday. The caller ID indicated it was the call he had been anticipating.A local call, Mal’akh mused, gazing out across Silver Hill Road toward the faintmoonlit outline of a zigzag roofline over the treetops. Mal’akh flipped open hisphone.“This is Dr. Abaddon,” he said, tuning his voice deeper.“It’s Katherine,” the woman’s voice said. “I finally heard from my brother.”“Oh, I’m relieved. How is he?”“He’s on his way to my lab right now,” Katherine said. “In fact, he suggestedyou join us.”“I’m sorry?” Mal’akh feigned hesitation. “In your . . . lab?”“He must trust you deeply. He never invites anyone back there.”“I suppose maybe he thinks a visit might help our discussions, but I feel likeit’s an intrusion.”“If my brother says you’re welcome, then you’re welcome. Besides, he said he hasa lot to tell us both, and I’d love to get to the bottom of what’s going on.”“Very well, then. Where exactly is your lab?”“At the Smithsonian Museum Support Center. Do you know where that is?”“No,” Mal’akh said, staring across the parking lot at the complex. “I’m actuallyin my car right now, and I have a guidance system. What’s the address?”“Forty-two-ten Silver Hill Road.”“Okay, hold on. I’ll type it in.” Mal’akh waited for ten seconds and then said,“Ah, good news, it looks like I’m closer than I thought. The GPS says I’m onlyabout ten minutes away.”“Great. I’ll phone the security gate and tell them you’re coming through.”“Thank you.”“I’ll see you shortly.”Mal’akh pocketed the disposable phone and looked out toward the SMSC. Was I rudeto invite myself? Smiling, he now pulled out Peter Solomon’s iPhone and admiredthe text message he had sent Katherine several minutes earlier.Got your messages. All’s fine. Busy day. Forgot appointment with Dr. Abaddon.Sorry not to mention him sooner. Long story. Am headed to lab now. If available,have Dr. Abaddon join us inside. I trust him fully, and I have much to tell youboth. —PeterNot surprisingly, Peter’s iPhone now pinged with an incoming reply fromKatherine.peter, congrats on learning to text! relieved you’re okay. spoke to dr. A., andhe is coming to lab. see you shortly! —kClutching Solomon’s iPhone, Mal’akh crouched down under his limousine and wedgedthe phone between the front tire and the pavement. This phone had served Mal’akhwell . . . but now it was time it became untraceable. He climbed behind thewheel, put the car in gear, and crept forward until he heard the sharp crack ofthe iPhone imploding.Mal’akh put the car back in park and stared out at the distant silhouette of theSMSC. Ten minutes. Peter Solomon’s sprawling warehouse housed over thirtymillion treasures, but Mal’akh had come here tonight to obliterate only the twomost valuable.All of Katherine Solomon’s research.And Katherine Solomon herself."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26Professor Langdon?” Sato said. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost. Are youokay?”Langdon hoisted his daybag higher onto his shoulder and laid his hand on top ofit, as if somehow this might better hide the cube-shaped package he wascarrying. He could feel his face had gone ashen. “I’m . . . just worried aboutPeter.”Sato cocked her head, eyeing him askew.Langdon felt a sudden wariness that Sato’s involvement tonight might relate tothis small package that Solomon had entrusted to him. Peter had warned Langdon:Powerful people want to steal this. It would be dangerous in the wrong hands.Langdon couldn’t imagine why the CIA would want a little box containing atalisman . . . or even what the talisman could be. Ordo ab chao?Sato stepped closer, her black eyes probing. “I sense you’ve had a revelation?”Langdon felt himself sweating now. “No, not exactly.”“What’s on your mind?”“I just . . .” Langdon hesitated, having no idea what to say. He had nointention of revealing the existence of the package in his bag, and yet if Satotook him to the CIA, his bag most certainly would be searched on the way in.“Actually . . .” he fibbed, “I have another idea about the numbers on Peter’shand.”Sato’s expression revealed nothing. “Yes?” She glanced over at Anderson now, whowas just arriving from greeting the forensics team that had finally arrived.Langdon swallowed hard and crouched down beside the hand, wondering what hecould possibly come up with to tell them. You’re a teacher, Robert—improvise! Hetook one last look at the seven tiny symbols, hoping for some sort ofinspiration.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_003_r1.jpg]Nothing. Blank.As Langdon’s eidetic memory skimmed through his mental encyclopedia of symbols,he could find only one possible point to make. It was something that hadoccurred to him initially, but had seemed unlikely. At the moment, however, hehad to buy time to think.“Well,” he began, “a symbologist’s first clue that he’s on the wrong track whendeciphering symbols and codes is when he starts interpreting symbols usingmultiple symbolic languages. For example, when I told you this text was Romanand Arabic, that was a poor analysis because I used multiple symbolic systems.The same is true for Roman and runic.”Sato crossed her arms and arched her eyebrows as if to say, “Go on.”“In general, communications are made in one language, not multiple languages,and so a symbologist’s first job with any text is to find a single consistentsymbolic system that applies to the entire text.”“And you see a single system now?”“Well, yes . . . and no.” Langdon’s experience with the rotational symmetry ofambigrams had taught him that symbols sometimes had meanings from multipleangles. In this case, he realized there was indeed a way to view all sevensymbols in a single language. “If we manipulated the hand slightly, the languagewill become consistent.” Eerily, the manipulation Langdon was about to performwas one that seemed to have been suggested by Peter’s captor already when hespoke the ancient Hermetic adage. As above, so below.Langdon felt a chill as he reached out and grasped the wooden base on whichPeter’s hand was secured. Gently, he turned the base upside down so that Peter’sextended fingers were now pointing straight down. The symbols on the palminstantly transformed themselves.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_009_r1.jpg]“From this angle,” Langdon said, “X-I-I-I becomes a valid Romannumeral—thirteen. Moreover, the rest of the characters can be interpreted usingthe Roman alphabet—SBB.” Langdon assumed the analysis would elicit blank shrugs,but Anderson’s expression immediately changed.“SBB?” the chief demanded.Sato turned to Anderson. “If I’m not mistaken, that sounds like a familiarnumbering system here in the Capitol Building.”Anderson looked pale. “It is.”Sato gave a grim smile and nodded to Anderson. “Chief, follow me, please. I’dlike a word in private.”As Director Sato led Chief Anderson out of earshot, Langdon stood alone inbewilderment. What the hell is going on here? And what is SBB XIII?Chief Anderson wondered how this night could possibly get any stranger. The handsays SBB13? He was amazed any outsider had even heard of SBB . . . much lessSBB13. Peter Solomon’s index finger, it seemed, was not directing them upward asit had appeared . . . but rather was pointing in quite the opposite direction.Director Sato led Anderson over to a quiet area near the bronze statue of ThomasJefferson. “Chief,” she said, “I trust you know exactly where SBB Thirteen islocated?”“Of course.”“Do you know what’s inside?”“No, not without looking. I don’t think it’s been used in decades.”“Well, you’re going to open it up.”Anderson did not appreciate being told what he would do in his own building.“Ma’am, that may be problematic. I’ll have to check the assignment roster first.As you know, most of the lower levels are private offices or storage, andsecurity protocol regarding private—”“You will unlock SBB Thirteen for me,” Sato said, “or I will call OS and send ina team with a battering ram.”Anderson stared at her a long moment and then pulled out his radio, raising itto his lips. “This is Anderson. I need someone to unlock the SBB. Have someonemeet me there in five minutes.”The voice that replied sounded confused. “Chief, confirming you said SBB?”“Correct. SBB. Send someone immediately. And I’ll need a flashlight.” He stowedhis radio. Anderson’s heart was pounding as Sato stepped closer, lowering hervoice even further.“Chief, time is short,” she whispered, “and I want you to get us down to SBBThirteen as quickly as possible.”“Yes, ma’am.”“I also need something else from you.”In addition to breaking and entering? Anderson was in no position to protest,and yet it had not gone unnoticed by him that Sato had arrived within minutes ofPeter’s hand appearing in the Rotunda, and that she now was using the situationto demand access to private sections of the U.S. Capitol. She seemed so farahead of the curve tonight that she was practically defining it.Sato motioned across the room toward the professor. “The duffel bag on Langdon’sshoulder.”Anderson glanced over. “What about it?”“I assume your staff X-rayed that bag when Langdon entered the building?”“Of course. All bags are scanned.”“I want to see that X-ray. I want to know what’s in his bag.”Anderson looked over at the bag Langdon had been carrying all evening. “But . .. wouldn’t it be easier just to ask him?”“What part of my request was unclear?”Anderson pulled out his radio again and called in her request. Sato gaveAnderson her BlackBerry address and requested that his team e-mail her a digitalcopy of the X-ray as soon as they had located it. Reluctantly Anderson complied.Forensics was now collecting the severed hand for the Capitol Police, but Satoordered them to deliver it directly to her team at Langley. Anderson was tootired to protest. He had just been run over by a tiny Japanese steamroller.“And I want that ring,” Sato called over to Forensics.The chief technician seemed ready to question her but thought better of it. Heremoved the gold ring from Peter’s hand, placed it in a clear specimen bag, andgave it to Sato. She slipped it into her jacket pocket, and then turned toLangdon.“We’re leaving, Professor. Bring your things.”“Where are we going?” Langdon replied.“Just follow Mr. Anderson.”Yes, Anderson thought, and follow me closely. The SBB was a section of theCapitol that few ever visited. To reach it, they would pass through a sprawlinglabyrinth of tiny chambers and tight passages buried beneath the crypt. AbrahamLincoln’s youngest son, Tad, had once gotten lost down there and almostperished. Anderson was starting to suspect that if Sato had her way, RobertLangdon might suffer a similar fate."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27Systems security specialist Mark Zoubianis had always prided himself on hisability to multitask. At the moment, he was seated on his futon along with a TVremote, a cordless phone, a laptop, a PDA, and a large bowl of Pirate’s Booty.With one eye on the muted Redskins game and one eye on his laptop, Zoubianis wasspeaking on his Bluetooth headset with a woman he had not heard from in over ayear.Leave it to Trish Dunne to call on the night of a play-off game.Confirming her social ineptitude yet again, his former colleague had chosen theRedskins game as a perfect moment to chat him up and request a favor. After somebrief small talk about the old days and how she missed his great jokes, Trishhad gotten to her point: she was trying to unmask a hidden IP address, probablythat of a secure server in the D.C. area. The server contained a small textdocument, and she wanted access to it . . . or at the very least, someinformation about whose document it was.Right guy, wrong timing, he had told her. Trish then showered him with herfinest geek flattery, most of which was true, and before Zoubianis knew it, hewas typing a strange-looking IP address into his laptop.Zoubianis took one look at the number and immediately felt uneasy. “Trish, thisIP has a funky format. It’s written in a protocol that isn’t even publiclyavailable yet. It’s probably gov intel or military.”“Military?” Trish laughed. “Believe me, I just pulled a redacted document offthis server, and it was not military.” Zoubianis pulled up his terminal windowand tried a traceroute. “You said your traceroute died?”“Yeah. Twice. Same hop.”“Mine, too.” He pulled up a diagnostic probe and launched it. “And what’s sointeresting about this IP?”“I ran a delegator that tapped a search engine at this IP and pulled a redacteddocument. I need to see the rest of the document. I’m happy to pay them for it,but I can’t figure out who owns the IP or how to access it.”Zoubianis frowned at his screen. “Are you sure about this? I’m running adiagnostic, and this firewall coding looks . . . pretty serious.”“That’s why you get the big bucks.”Zoubianis considered it. They’d offered him a fortune for a job this easy. “Onequestion, Trish. Why are you so hot on this?”Trish paused. “I’m doing a favor for a friend.”“Must be a special friend.”“She is.”Zoubianis chuckled and held his tongue. I knew it.“Look,” Trish said, sounding impatient. “Are you good enough to unmask this IP?Yes or no?”“Yes, I’m good enough. And yes, I know you’re playing me like a fiddle.”“How long will it take you?”“Not long,” he said, typing as he spoke. “I should be able to get into a machineon their network within ten minutes or so. Once I’m in and know what I’m lookingat, I’ll call you back.”“I appreciate it. So, are you doing well?”Now she asks? “Trish, for God’s sake, you called me on the night of a play-offgame and now you want to chat? Do you want me to hack this IP or not?”“Thanks, Mark. I appreciate it. I’ll be waiting for your call.”“Fifteen minutes.” Zoubianis hung up, grabbed his bowl of Pirate’s Booty, andunmuted the game.Women."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28Where are they taking me?As Langdon hurried with Anderson and Sato into the depths of the Capitol, hefelt his heart rate increasing with each downward step. They had begun theirjourney through the west portico of the Rotunda, descending a marble staircaseand then doubling back through a wide doorway into the famous chamber directlybeneath the Rotunda floor.The Capitol Crypt.The air was heavier here, and Langdon was already feeling claustrophobic. Thecrypt’s low ceiling and soft uplighting accentuated the robust girth of theforty Doric columns required to support the vast stone floor directly overhead.Relax, Robert.“This way,” Anderson said, moving quickly as he angled to the left across thewide circular space.Thankfully, this particular crypt contained no bodies. Instead it containedseveral statues, a model of the Capitol, and a low storage area for the woodencatafalque on which coffins were laid for state funerals. The entourage hurriedthrough, without even a glance at the four-pointed marble compass in the centerof the floor where the Eternal Flame had once burned.Anderson seemed to be in a hurry, and Sato once again had her head buried in herBlackBerry. Cellular service, Langdon had heard, was boosted and broadcast toall corners of the Capitol Building to support the hundreds of government phonecalls that took place here every day.After diagonally crossing the crypt, the group entered a dimly lit foyer andbegan winding through a convoluted series of hallways and dead ends. The warrenof passages contained numbered doorways, each of which bore an identificationnumber. Langdon read the doors as they snaked their way around.S154 . . . S153 . . . S152 . . .He had no idea what lay behind these doors, but at least one thing now seemedclear—the meaning of the tattoo on Peter Solomon’s palm.SBB13 appeared to be a numbered doorway somewhere in the bowels of the U.S.Capitol Building.“What are all these doorways?” Langdon asked, clutching his daybag tightly tohis ribs and wondering what Solomon’s tiny package could possibly have to dowith a door marked SBB13.“Offices and storage,” Anderson said. “Private offices and storage,” he added,glancing back at Sato.Sato did not even glance up from her BlackBerry.“They look tiny,” Langdon said.“Glorified closets, most of them, but they’re still some of the mostsought-after real estate in D.C. This is the heart of the original Capitol, andthe old Senate chamber is two stories above us.”“And SBB Thirteen?” Langdon asked. “Whose office is that?”“Nobody’s. The SBB is a private storage area, and I must say, I’m puzzled how—”“Chief Anderson,” Sato interrupted without looking up from her BlackBerry. “Justtake us there, please.”Anderson clenched his jaw and guided them on in silence through what was nowfeeling like a hybrid self-storage facility and epic labyrinth. On almost everywall, directional signs pointed back and forth, apparently attempting to locatespecific office blocks in this network of hallways.S142 to S152 . . .ST1 to ST70 . . .H1 to H166 & HT1 to HT67 . . .Langdon doubted he could ever find his way out of here alone. This place is amaze. From all he could gather, office numbers began with either an S or an Hdepending on whether they were on the Senate side of the building or the Houseside. Areas designated ST and HT were apparently on a level that Anderson calledTerrace Level.Still no signs for SBB.Finally they arrived at a heavy steel security door with a key-card entry box.SB LevelLangdon sensed they were getting closer.Anderson reached for his key card but hesitated, looking uncomfortable withSato’s demands.“Chief,” Sato prompted. “We don’t have all night.”Anderson reluctantly inserted his key card. The steel door released. He pushedit open, and they stepped through into the foyer beyond. The heavy door clickedshut behind them.Langdon wasn’t sure what he had hoped to see in this foyer, but the sight infront of him was definitely not it. He was staring at a descending stairway.“Down again?” he said, stopping short. “There’s a level under the crypt?”“Yes,” Anderson said. “SB stands for ‘Senate Basement.’ ”Langdon groaned. Terrific."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29The headlights winding up the SMSC’s wooded access road were the first the guardhad seen in the last hour. Dutifully, he turned down the volume on his portableTV set and stashed his snacks beneath the counter. Lousy timing. The Redskinswere completing their opening drive, and he didn’t want to miss it.As the car drew closer, the guard checked the name on the notepad in front ofhim.Dr. Christopher Abaddon.Katherine Solomon had just called to alert Security of this guest’s imminentarrival. The guard had no idea who this doctor might be, but he was apparentlyvery good at doctoring; he was arriving in a black stretch limousine. The long,sleek vehicle rolled to a stop beside the guardhouse, and the driver’s tintedwindow lowered silently.“Good evening,” the chauffeur said, doffing his cap. He was a powerfully builtman with a shaved head. He was listening to the football game on his radio. “Ihave Dr. Christopher Abaddon for Ms. Katherine Solomon?”The guard nodded. “Identification, please.”The chauffeur looked surprised. “I’m sorry, didn’t Ms. Solomon call ahead?”The guard nodded, stealing a glance at the television. “I’m still required toscan and log visitor identification. Sorry, regulations. I’ll need to see thedoctor’s ID.”“Not a problem.” The chauffeur turned backward in his seat and spoke in hushedtones through the privacy screen. As he did, the guard stole another peek at thegame. The Redskins were breaking from the huddle now, and he hoped to get thislimo through before the next play.The chauffeur turned forward again and held out the ID that he’d apparently justreceived through the privacy screen.The guard took the card and quickly scanned it into his system. The D.C.driver’s license showed one Christopher Abaddon from Kalorama Heights. The photodepicted a handsome blond gentleman wearing a blue blazer, a necktie, and asatin pocket square. Who the hell wears a pocket square to the DMV?A muffled cheer went up from the television set, and the guard wheeled just intime to see a Redskins player dancing in the end zone, his finger pointedskyward. “I missed it,” the guard grumbled, returning to the window.“Okay,” he said, returning the license to the chauffeur. “You’re all set.”As the limo pulled through, the guard returned to his TV, hoping for a replay.As Mal’akh drove his limo up the winding access road, he couldn’t help butsmile. Peter Solomon’s secret museum had been simple to breach. Sweeter still,tonight was the second time in twenty-four hours that Mal’akh had broken intoone of Solomon’s private spaces. Last night, a similar visit had been made toSolomon’s home.Although Peter Solomon had a magnificent country estate in Potomac, he spentmuch of his time in the city at his penthouse apartment at the exclusiveDorchester Arms. His building, like most that catered to the super-rich, was averitable fortress. High walls. Guard gates. Guest lists. Secured undergroundparking.Mal’akh had driven this very limousine up to the building’s guardhouse, doffedhis chauffeur’s cap from his shaved head, and proclaimed, “I have Dr.Christopher Abaddon. He is an invited guest of Mr. Peter Solomon.” Mal’akh spokethe words as if he were announcing the Duke of York.The guard checked a log and then Abaddon’s ID. “Yes, I see Mr. Solomon isexpecting Dr. Abaddon.” He pressed a button and the gate opened. “Mr. Solomon isin the penthouse apartment. Have your guest use the last elevator on the right.It goes all the way up.”“Thank you.” Mal’akh tipped his hat and drove through.As he wound deep into the garage, he scanned for security cameras. Nothing.Apparently, those who lived here were neither the kind of people who broke intocars nor the kind of people who appreciated being watched.Mal’akh parked in a dark corner near the elevators, lowered the divider betweenthe driver’s compartment and the passenger compartment, and slithered throughthe opening into the back of the limo. Once in back, he got rid of hischauffeur’s cap and donned his blond wig. Straightening his jacket and tie, hechecked the mirror to make sure he had not smeared his makeup. Mal’akh was notabout to take any chances. Not tonight.I have waited too long for this.Seconds later, Mal’akh was stepping into the private elevator. The ride to thetop was silent and smooth. When the door opened, he found himself in an elegant,private foyer. His host was already waiting.“Dr. Abaddon, welcome.”Mal’akh looked into the man’s famous gray eyes and felt his heart begin to race.“Mr. Solomon, I appreciate your seeing me.”“Please, call me Peter.” The two men shook hands. As Mal’akh gripped the olderman’s palm, he saw the gold Masonic ring on Solomon’s hand . . . the same handthat had once aimed a gun at Mal’akh. A voice whispered from Mal’akh’s distantpast. If you pull that trigger, I will haunt you forever.“Please come in,” Solomon said, ushering Mal’akh into an elegant living roomwhose expansive windows offered an astonishing view of the Washington skyline.“Do I smell tea steeping?” Mal’akh asked as he entered.Solomon looked impressed. “My parents always greeted guests with tea. I’vecarried on that tradition.” He led Mal’akh into the living room, where a teaservice was waiting in front of the fire. “Cream and sugar?”“Black, thank you.”Again Solomon looked impressed. “A purist.” He poured them both a cup of blacktea. “You said you needed to discuss something with me that was sensitive innature and could be discussed only in private.”“Thank you. I appreciate your time.”“You and I are Masonic brothers now. We have a bond. Tell me how I can helpyou.”“First, I would like to thank you for the honor of the thirty-third degree a fewmonths ago. This is deeply meaningful to me.”“I’m glad, but please know that those decisions are not mine alone. They are byvote of the Supreme Council.”“Of course.” Mal’akh suspected Peter Solomon had probably voted against him, butwithin the Masons, as with all things, money was power. Mal’akh, after achievingthe thirty-second degree in his own lodge, had waited only a month before makinga multimillion-dollar donation to charity in the name of the Masonic GrandLodge. The unsolicited act of selflessness, as Mal’akh anticipated, was enoughto earn him a quick invitation into the elite thirty-third degree. And yet Ihave learned no secrets.Despite the age-old whispers—“All is revealed at the thirty-thirddegree”—Mal’akh had been told nothing new, nothing of relevance to his quest.But he had never expected to be told. The inner circle of Freemasonry containedsmaller circles still . . . circles Mal’akh would not see for years, if ever. Hedidn’t care. His initiation had served its purpose. Something unique hadhappened within that Temple Room, and it had given Mal’akh power over all ofthem. I no longer play by your rules.“You do realize,” Mal’akh said, sipping his tea, “that you and I met many yearsago.”Solomon looked surprised. “Really? I don’t recall.”“It was quite a long time ago.” And Christopher Abaddon is not my real name.“I’m so sorry. My mind must be getting old. Remind me how I know you?”Mal’akh smiled one last time at the man he hated more than any other man onearth. “It’s unfortunate that you don’t recall.”In one fluid motion, Mal’akh pulled a small device from his pocket and extendedit outward, driving it hard into the man’s chest. There was a flash of bluelight, the sharp sizzle of the stun-gun discharge, and a gasp of pain as onemillion volts of electricity coursed through Peter Solomon’s body. His eyes wentwide, and he slumped motionless in his chair. Mal’akh stood up now, toweringover the man, salivating like a lion about to consume his injured prey.Solomon was gasping, straining to breathe.Mal’akh saw fear in his victim’s eyes and wondered how many people had ever seenthe great Peter Solomon cower. Mal’akh savored the scene for several longseconds. He took a sip of tea, waiting for the man to catch his breath.Solomon was twitching, attempting to speak. “Wh-why?” he finally managed.“Why do you think?” Mal’akh demanded.Solomon looked truly bewildered. “You want . . . money?”Money? Mal’akh laughed and took another sip of tea. “I gave the Masons millionsof dollars; I have no need of wealth.” I come for wisdom, and he offers mewealth.“Then what . . . do you want?”“You possess a secret. You will share it with me tonight.”Solomon struggled to lift his chin so he could look Mal’akh in the eye. “I don’t. . . understand.”“No more lies!” Mal’akh shouted, advancing to within inches of the paralyzedman. “I know what is hidden here in Washington.”Solomon’s gray eyes were defiant. “I have no idea what you’re talking about!”Mal’akh took another sip of tea and set the cup on a coaster. “You spoke thosesame words to me ten years ago, on the night of your mother’s death.”Solomon’s eyes shot wide open. “You . . . ?”“She didn’t have to die. If you had given me what I demanded . . .”The older man’s face contorted in a mask of horrified recognition . . . anddisbelief.“I warned you,” Mal’akh said, “if you pulled the trigger, I would haunt youforever.”“But you’re—”Mal’akh lunged, driving the Taser hard into Solomon’s chest again. There wasanother flash of blue light, and Solomon went completely limp.Mal’akh put the Taser back in his pocket and calmly finished his tea. When hewas done, he dabbed his lips with a monogrammed linen napkin and peered down athis victim. “Shall we go?”Solomon’s body was motionless, but his eyes were wide and engaged.Mal’akh got down close and whispered in the man’s ear. “I’m taking you to aplace where only truth remains.”Without another word, Mal’akh wadded up the monogrammed napkin and stuffed itinto Solomon’s mouth. Then he hoisted the limp man onto his broad shoulders andheaded for the private elevator. On his way out, he picked up Solomon’s iPhoneand keys from the hall table.Tonight you will tell me all your secrets, Mal’akh thought. Including why youleft me for dead all those years ago."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30SB level.Senate basement.Robert Langdon’s claustrophobia gripped him more tightly with every hasteningstep of their descent. As they moved deeper into the building’s originalfoundation, the air became heavy, and the ventilation seemed nonexistent. Thewalls down here were an uneven blend of stone and yellow brick.Director Sato typed on her BlackBerry as they walked. Langdon sensed a suspicionin her guarded manner, but the feeling was quickly becoming reciprocal. Satostill hadn’t told him how she knew Langdon was here tonight. An issue ofnational security? He had a hard time understanding any relation between ancientmysticism and national security. Then again, he had a hard time understandingmuch of anything about this situation.Peter Solomon entrusted me with a talisman . . . a deluded lunatic tricked meinto bringing it to the Capitol and wants me to use it to unlock a mysticalportal . . . possibly in a room called SBB13.Not exactly a clear picture.As they pressed on, Langdon tried to shake from his mind the horrible image ofPeter’s tattooed hand, transformed into the Hand of the Mysteries. The gruesomepicture was accompanied by Peter’s voice: The Ancient Mysteries, Robert, havespawned many myths . . . but that does not mean they themselves are fiction.Despite a career studying mystical symbols and history, Langdon had alwaysstruggled intellectually with the idea of the Ancient Mysteries and their potentpromise of apotheosis.Admittedly, the historical record contained indisputable evidence that secretwisdom had been passed down through the ages, apparently having come out of theMystery Schools in early Egypt. This knowledge moved underground, resurfacing inRenaissance Europe, where, according to most accounts, it was entrusted to anelite group of scientists within the walls of Europe’s premier scientific thinktank—the Royal Society of London—enigmatically nicknamed the Invisible College.This concealed “college” quickly became a brain trust of the world’s mostenlightened minds—those of Isaac Newton, Francis Bacon, Robert Boyle, and evenBenjamin Franklin. Today, the list of modern “fellows” was no lessimpressive—Einstein, Hawking, Bohr, and Celsius. These great minds had all madequantum leaps in human understanding, advances that, according to some, were theresult of their exposure to ancient wisdom hidden within the Invisible College.Langdon doubted this was true, although certainly there had been an unusualamount of “mystical work” taking place within those walls.The discovery of Isaac Newton’s secret papers in 1936 had stunned the world byrevealing Newton’s all-consuming passion for the study of ancient alchemy andmystical wisdom. Newton’s private papers included a handwritten letter to RobertBoyle in which he exhorted Boyle to keep “high silence” regarding the mysticalknowledge they had learned. “It cannot be communicated,” Newton wrote, “withoutimmense damage to the world.”The meaning of this strange warning was still being debated today.“Professor,” Sato said suddenly, glancing up from her BlackBerry, “despite yourinsistence that you have no idea why you’re here tonight, perhaps you could shedlight on the meaning of Peter Solomon’s ring.”“I can try,” Langdon said, refocusing.She produced the specimen bag and handed it to Langdon. “Tell me about thesymbols on his ring.”Langdon examined the familiar ring as they moved through the desertedpassageway. Its face bore the image of a double-headed phoenix holding a bannerproclaiming ORDO AB CHAO, and its chest was emblazoned with the number 33. “Thedouble-headed phoenix with the number thirty-three is the emblem of the highestMasonic degree.” Technically, this prestigious degree existed solely within theScottish Rite. Nonetheless, the rites and degrees of Masonry were a complexhierarchy that Langdon had no desire to detail for Sato tonight. “Essentially,the thirty-third degree is an elite honor reserved for a small group of highlyaccomplished Masons. All the other degrees can be attained by successfulcompletion of the previous degree, but ascension to the thirty-third degree iscontrolled. It’s by invitation only.”“So you were aware that Peter Solomon was a member of this elite inner circle?”“Of course. Membership is hardly a secret.”“And he is their highest-ranking official?”“Currently, yes. Peter heads the Supreme Council Thirty-third Degree, which isthe governing body of the Scottish Rite in America.” Langdon always lovedvisiting their headquarters—the House of the Temple—a classical masterpiecewhose symbolic ornamentation rivaled that of Scotland’s Rosslyn Chapel.“Professor, did you notice the engraving on the ring’s band? It bears the words‘All is revealed at the thirty-third degree.’ ”Langdon nodded. “It’s a common theme in Masonic lore.”“Meaning, I assume, that if a Mason is admitted to this highest thirty-thirddegree, then something special is revealed to him?”“Yes, that’s the lore, but probably not the reality. There’s always beenconspiratorial conjecture that a select few within this highest echelon ofMasonry are made privy to some great mystical secret. The truth, I suspect, isprobably far less dramatic.”Peter Solomon often made playful allusions to the existence of a preciousMasonic secret, but Langdon always assumed it was just a mischievous attempt tocoax him into joining the brotherhood. Unfortunately, tonight’s events had beenanything but playful, and there had been nothing mischievous about theseriousness with which Peter had urged Langdon to protect the sealed package inhis daybag.Langdon glanced forlornly at the plastic bag containing Peter’s gold ring.“Director,” he asked, “would you mind if I held on to this?”She looked over. “Why?”“It’s very valuable to Peter, and I’d like to return it to him tonight.”She looked skeptical. “Let’s hope you get that chance.”“Thanks.” Langdon pocketed the ring.“Another question,” Sato said as they hastened deeper into the labyrinth. “Mystaff said that while cross-checking the concepts of the ‘thirty-third degree’and ‘portal’ with Masonry, they turned up literally hundreds of references to a‘pyramid’?”“That’s not surprising, either,” Langdon said. “The pyramid builders of Egyptare the forerunners of the modern stonemasons, and the pyramid, along withEgyptian themes, is very common in Masonic symbolism.”“Symbolizing what?”“The pyramid essentially represents enlightenment. It’s an architectural symbolemblematic of ancient man’s ability to break free from his earthly plane andascend upward toward heaven, toward the golden sun, and ultimately, toward thesupreme source of illumination.”She waited a moment. “Nothing else?”Nothing else?! Langdon had just described one of history’s most elegant symbols.The structure through which man elevated himself into the realm of the gods.“According to my staff,” she said, “it sounds like there is a much more relevantconnection tonight. They tell me there exists a popular legend about a specificpyramid here in Washington—a pyramid that relates specifically to the Masons andthe Ancient Mysteries?”Langdon now realized what she was referring to, and he tried to dispel thenotion before they wasted any more time. “I am familiar with the legend,Director, but it’s pure fantasy. The Masonic Pyramid is one of D.C.’s mostenduring myths, probably stemming from the pyramid on the Great Seal of theUnited States.”“Why didn’t you mention it earlier?”Langdon shrugged. “Because it has no basis in fact. Like I said, it’s a myth.One of many associated with the Masons.”“And yet this particular myth relates directly to the Ancient Mysteries?”“Sure, as do plenty of others. The Ancient Mysteries are the foundation forcountless legends that have survived in history—stories about powerful wisdomprotected by secret guardians like the Templars, the Rosicrucians, theIlluminati, the Alumbrados—the list goes on and on. They are all based on theAncient Mysteries . . . and the Masonic Pyramid is just one example.”“I see,” Sato said. “And what does this legend actually say?”Langdon considered it for a few steps and then replied, “Well, I’m no specialistin conspiracy theory, but I am educated in mythology, and most accounts gosomething like this: The Ancient Mysteries—the lost wisdom of the ages—have longbeen considered mankind’s most sacred treasure, and like all great treasures,they have been carefully protected. The enlightened sages who understood thetrue power of this wisdom learned to fear its awesome potential. They knew thatif this secret knowledge were to fall into uninitiated hands, the results couldbe devastating; as we said earlier, powerful tools can be used either for goodor for evil. So, in order to protect the Ancient Mysteries, and mankind in theprocess, the early practitioners formed secret fraternities. Inside thesebrotherhoods, they shared their wisdom only with the properly initiated, passingthe wisdom from sage to sage. Many believe we can look back and see thehistorical remnants of those who mastered the Mysteries . . . in the stories ofsorcerers, magicians, and healers.”“And the Masonic Pyramid?” Sato asked. “How does that fit in?”“Well,” Langdon said, striding faster now to keep pace, “this is where historyand myth begin to merge. According to some accounts, by the sixteenth century inEurope, almost all of these secret fraternities had become extinct, most of themexterminated by a growing tide of religious persecution. The Freemasons, it issaid, became the last surviving custodians of the Ancient Mysteries.Understandably, they feared that if their own brotherhood one day died off likeits predecessors, the Ancient Mysteries would be lost for all time.”“And the pyramid?” Sato again pressed.Langdon was getting to it. “The legend of the Masonic Pyramid is quite simple.It states that the Masons, in order to fulfill their responsibility ofprotecting this great wisdom for future generations, decided to hide it in agreat fortress.” Langdon tried to gather his recollections of the story. “Again,I stress this is all myth, but allegedly, the Masons transported their secretwisdom from the Old World to the New World—here, to America—a land they hopedwould remain free from religious tyranny. And here they built an impenetrablefortress—a hidden pyramid—designed to protect the Ancient Mysteries until thetime that all of mankind was ready to handle the awesome power that this wisdomcould communicate. According to the myth, the Masons crowned their great pyramidwith a shining, solid-gold capstone as symbol of the precious treasurewithin—the ancient wisdom capable of empowering mankind to his full humanpotential. Apotheosis.”“Quite a story,” Sato said.“Yes. The Masons fall victim to all kinds of crazy legends.”“Obviously you don’t believe such a pyramid exists.”“Of course not,” Langdon replied. “There’s no evidence whatsoever to suggestthat our Masonic forefathers built any kind of pyramid in America, much less inD.C. It’s pretty difficult to hide a pyramid, especially one large enough tohold all the lost wisdom of the ages.”The legend, as Langdon recalled, never explained exactly what was supposed to beinside the Masonic Pyramid—whether it was ancient texts, occult writings,scientific revelations, or something far more mysterious—but the legend did saythat the precious information inside was ingeniously encoded . . . andunderstandable only to the most enlightened souls.“Anyway,” Langdon said, “this story falls into a category we symbologists callan ‘archetypal hybrid’—a blend of other classic legends, borrowing so manyelements from popular mythology that it could only be a fictional construct . .. not historical fact.”When Langdon taught his students about archetypal hybrids, he used the exampleof fairy tales, which were recounted across generations and exaggerated overtime, borrowing so heavily from one another that they evolved into homogenizedmorality tales with the same iconic elements—virginal damsels, handsome princes,impenetrable fortresses, and powerful wizards. By way of fairy tales, thisprimeval battle of “good vs. evil” is ingrained into us as children through ourstories: Merlin vs. Morgan le Fay, Saint George vs. the Dragon, David vs.Goliath, Snow White vs. the Witch, and even Luke Skywalker battling Darth Vader.Sato scratched her head as they turned a corner and followed Anderson down ashort flight of stairs. “Tell me this. If I’m not mistaken, pyramids were onceconsidered mystical portals through which the deceased pharaohs could ascend tothe gods, were they not?”“True.”Sato stopped short and caught Langdon’s arm, glaring up at him with anexpression somewhere between surprise and disbelief. “You’re saying PeterSolomon’s captor told you to find a hidden portal, and it didn’t occur to youthat he was talking about the Masonic Pyramid from this legend?”“By any name, the Masonic Pyramid is a fairy tale. It’s purely fantasy.”Sato stepped closer to him now, and Langdon could smell her cigarette breath. “Iunderstand your position on that, Professor, but for the sake of myinvestigation, the parallel is hard to ignore. A portal leading to secretknowledge? To my ear, this sounds a lot like what Peter Solomon’s captor claimsyou, alone, can unlock.”“Well, I can hardly believe—”“What you believe is not the point. No matter what you believe, you must concedethat this man might himself believe that the Masonic Pyramid is real.”“The man’s a lunatic! He may well believe that SBB Thirteen is the entrance to agiant underground pyramid that contains all the lost wisdom of the ancients!”Sato stood perfectly still, her eyes seething. “The crisis I am facing tonightis not a fairy tale, Professor. It is quite real, I assure you.”A cold silence hung between them.“Ma’am?” Anderson finally said, gesturing to another secure door ten feet away.“We’re almost there, if you’d like to continue.” Sato finally broke eye contactwith Langdon, motioning for Anderson to move on. They followed the securitychief through the secure doorway, which deposited them in a narrow passage.Langdon looked left and then right.You’ve got to be kidding.He was standing in the longest hallway he had ever seen."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31Trish Dunne felt the familiar surge of adrenaline as she exited the brightlights of the Cube and moved into the raw darkness of the void. The SMSC’s frontgate had just called to say that Katherine’s guest, Dr. Abaddon, had arrived andrequired an escort back to Pod 5. Trish had offered to bring him back, mostlyout of curiosity. Katherine had said very little about the man who would bevisiting them, and Trish was intrigued. The man was apparently someone PeterSolomon trusted deeply; the Solomons never invited anyone back to the Cube. Thiswas a first.I hope he handles the crossing okay, Trish thought as she moved through thefrigid darkness. The last thing she needed was Katherine’s VIP panicking when herealized what he had to do to get to the lab. The first time is always theworst.Trish’s first time had been about a year ago. She had accepted Katherine’s joboffer, signed a nondisclosure, and then come to the SMSC with Katherine to seethe lab. The two women had walked the length of “The Street,” arriving at ametal door marked POD 5. Even though Katherine had tried to prepare her bydescribing the lab’s remote location, Trish was not ready for what she saw whenthe pod door hissed open.The void.Katherine stepped over the threshold, walked a few feet into the perfectblackness, and then motioned for Trish to follow. “Trust me. You won’t getlost.”Trish pictured herself wandering in a pitch-black, stadium-size room and broke asweat at the mere thought.“We have a guidance system to keep you on track.” Katherine pointed to thefloor. “Very low-tech.”Trish squinted through the darkness at the rough cement floor. It took a momentto see it in the darkness, but there was a narrow carpet runner that had beenlaid down in a straight line. The carpet ran like a roadway, disappearing intothe darkness.“See with your feet,” Katherine said, turning and walking off. “Just followright behind me.”As Katherine disappeared into the blackness, Trish swallowed her fear andfollowed. This is insane! She had taken only a few steps down the carpet whenthe Pod 5 door swung shut behind her, snuffing out the last faint hint of light.Pulse racing, Trish turned all of her attention to the feeling of the carpetbeneath her feet. She had ventured only a handful of steps down the soft runnerwhen she felt the side of her right foot hit hard cement. Startled, sheinstinctively corrected to the left, getting both feet back on soft carpet.Katherine’s voice materialized up ahead in the blackness, her words almostentirely swallowed by the lifeless acoustics of this abyss. “The human body isamazing,” she said. “If you deprive it of one sensory input, the other sensestake over, almost instantly. Right now, the nerves in your feet are literally‘tuning’ themselves to become more sensitive.”Good thing, Trish thought, correcting course again.They walked in silence for what seemed entirely too long. “How much farther?”Trish finally asked.“We’re about halfway.” Katherine’s voice sounded more distant now.Trish sped up, doing her best to stay composed, but the breadth of the darknessfelt like it would engulf her. I can’t see one millimeter in front of my face!“Katherine? How do you know when to stop walking?”“You’ll know in a moment,” Katherine said.That was a year ago, and now, tonight, Trish was once again in the void, headingin the opposite direction, out to the lobby to retrieve her boss’s guest. Asudden change in carpet texture beneath her feet alerted her that she was threeyards from the exit. The warning track, as it was called by Peter Solomon, anavid baseball fan. Trish stopped short, pulled out her key card, and groped inthe darkness along the wall until she found the raised slot and inserted hercard.The door hissed open.Trish squinted into the welcoming light of the SMSC hallway.Made it . . . again.Moving through the deserted corridors, Trish found herself thinking about thebizarre redacted file they had found on a secure network. Ancient portal? Secretlocation underground? She wondered if Mark Zoubianis was having any luckfiguring out where the mysterious document was located.Inside the control room, Katherine stood in the soft glow of the plasma wall andgazed up at the enigmatic document they had uncovered. She had isolated her keyphrases now and felt increasingly certain that the document was talking aboutthe same far-flung legend that her brother had apparently shared with Dr.Abaddon.. . . secret location UNDERGROUND where the . . .. . . somewhere in WASHINGTON, D.C., the coordinates . . .. . . uncovered an ANCIENT PORTAL that led . . .. . . warning the PYRAMID holds dangerous . . .. . . decipher this ENGRAVED SYMBOLON to unveil . . .I need to see the rest of the file, Katherine thought.She stared a moment longer and then flipped the plasma wall’s power switch.Katherine always turned off this energy-intensive display so as not to waste thefuel cell’s liquid hydrogen reserves.She watched as her keywords slowly faded, collapsing down into a tiny white dot,which hovered in the middle of the wall and then finally twinkled out.She turned and walked back toward her office. Dr. Abaddon would be arrivingmomentarily, and she wanted to make him feel welcome."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 32“Almost there,” Anderson said, guiding Langdon and Sato down the seeminglyendless corridor that ran the entire length of the Capitol’s eastern foundation.“In Lincoln’s day, this passage had a dirt floor and was filled with rats.”Langdon felt grateful the floor had been tiled; he was not a big fan of rats.The group continued on, their footfalls drumming up an eerie, uneven echo in thelong passageway. Doorways lined the long hallway, some closed but many ajar.Many of the rooms down on this level looked abandoned. Langdon noticed thenumbers on the doors were now descending and, after a while, seemed to berunning out.SB4 . . . SB3 . . . SB2 . . . SB1 . . .They continued past an unmarked door, but Anderson stopped short when thenumbers began ascending again.HB1 . . . HB2 . . .“Sorry,” Anderson said. “Missed it. I almost never come down this deep.”The group backed up a few yards to an old metal door, which Langdon now realizedwas located at the hallway’s central point—the meridian that divided the SenateBasement (SB) and the House Basement (HB). As it turned out, the door was indeedmarked, but its engraving was so faded, it was almost imperceptible.SBB“Here we are,” Anderson said. “Keys will be arriving any moment.”Sato frowned and checked her watch.Langdon eyed the SBB marking and asked Anderson, “Why is this space associatedwith the Senate side even though it’s in the middle?”Anderson looked puzzled. “What do you mean?”“It says SBB, which begins with an S, not an H.”Anderson shook his head. “The S in SBB doesn’t stand for Senate. It—”“Chief?” a guard called out in the distance. He came jogging up the hallwaytoward them, holding out a key. “Sorry, sir, it took a few minutes. We couldn’tlocate the main SBB key. This is a spare from an auxiliary box.”“The original is missing?” Anderson said, sounding surprised.“Probably lost,” the guard replied, arriving out of breath. “Nobody hasrequested access down here for ages.”Anderson took the key. “No secondary key for SBB Thirteen?”“Sorry, so far we’re not finding keys for any of the rooms in the SBB.MacDonald’s on it now.” The guard pulled out his radio and spoke into it. “Bob?I’m with the chief. Any additional info yet on the key for SBB Thirteen?”The guard’s radio crackled, and a voice replied, “Actually, yeah. It’s strange.I’m seeing no entries since we computerized, but the hard logs indicate all thestorage rooms in the SBB were cleaned out and abandoned more than twenty yearsago. They’re now listed as unused space.” He paused. “All except for SBBThirteen.”Anderson grabbed the radio. “This is the chief. What do you mean, all except SBBThirteen?”“Well, sir,” the voice replied, “I’ve got a handwritten notation here thatdesignates SBB Thirteen as ‘private.’ It was a long time ago, but it’s writtenand initialed by the Architect himself.”The term Architect, Langdon knew, was not a reference to the man who haddesigned the Capitol, but rather to the man who ran it. Similar to a buildingmanager, the man appointed as Architect of the Capitol was in charge ofeverything including maintenance, restoration, security, hiring personnel, andassigning offices.“The strange thing . . .” the voice on the radio said, “is that the Architect’snotation indicates that this ‘private space’ was set aside for the use of PeterSolomon.”Langdon, Sato, and Anderson all exchanged startled looks.“I’m guessing, sir,” the voice continued, “that Mr. Solomon has our primary keyto the SBB as well as any keys to SBB Thirteen.”Langdon could not believe his ears. Peter has a private room in the basement ofthe Capitol? He had always known Peter Solomon had secrets, but this wassurprising even to Langdon.“Okay,” Anderson said, clearly unamused. “We’re hoping to get access to SBBThirteen specifically, so keep looking for a secondary key.” “Will do, sir. We’re also working on the digital image that you requested—”“Thank you,” Anderson interrupted, pressing the talk button and cutting him off.“That will be all. Send that file to Director Sato’s BlackBerry as soon as youhave it.”“Understood, sir.” The radio went silent.Anderson handed the radio back to the guard in front of them.The guard pulled out a photocopy of a blueprint and handed it to his chief.“Sir, the SBB is in gray, and we’ve notated with an X which room is SBBThirteen, so it shouldn’t be hard to find. The area is quite small.”Anderson thanked the guard and turned his focus to the blueprint as the youngman hurried off. Langdon looked on, surprised to see the astonishing number ofcubicles that made up the bizarre maze beneath the U.S. Capitol.Anderson studied the blueprint for a moment, nodded, and then stuffed it intohis pocket. Turning to the door marked SBB, he raised the key, but hesitated,looking uneasy about opening it. Langdon felt similar misgivings; he had no ideawhat was behind this door, but he was quite certain that whatever Solomon hadhidden down here, he wanted to keep private. Very private.Sato cleared her throat, and Anderson got the message. The chief took a deepbreath, inserted the key, and tried to turn it. The key didn’t move. For a splitsecond, Langdon felt hopeful the key was wrong. On the second try, though, thelock turned, and Anderson heaved the door open.As the heavy door creaked outward, damp air rushed out into the corridor.Langdon peered into the darkness but could see nothing at all.“Professor,” Anderson said, glancing back at Langdon as he groped blindly for alight switch. “To answer your question, the S in SBB doesn’t stand for Senate.It stands for sub.”“Sub?” Langdon asked, puzzled.Anderson nodded and flicked the switch just inside the door. A single bulbilluminated an alarmingly steep staircase descending into inky blackness. “SBBis the Capitol’s subbasement.”image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_006_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 33Systems security specialist Mark Zoubianis was sinking deeper into his futon andscowling at the information on his laptop screen.What the hell kind of address is this?His best hacking tools were entirely ineffective at breaking into the documentor at unmasking Trish’s mysterious IP address. Ten minutes had passed, andZoubianis’s program was still pounding away in vain at the network firewalls.They showed little hope of penetration. No wonder they’re overpaying me. He wasabout to retool and try a different approach when his phone rang.Trish, for Christ’s sake, I said I’d call you. He muted the football game andanswered. “Yeah?”“Is this Mark Zoubianis?” a man asked. “At 357 Kingston Drive in Washington?”Zoubianis could hear other muffled conversations in the background. Atelemarketer during the play-offs? Are they insane? “Let me guess, I won a weekin Anguilla?”“No,” the voice replied with no trace of humor. “This is systems security forthe Central Intelligence Agency. We would like to know why you are attempting tohack one of our classified databases?”Three stories above the Capitol Building’s subbasement, in the wide-open spacesof the visitor center, security guard Nuñez locked the main entry doors as hedid every night at this time. As he headed back across the expansive marblefloors, he thought of the man in the army-surplus jacket with the tattoos.I let him in. Nuñez wondered if he would have a job tomorrow.As he headed toward the escalator, a sudden pounding on the outside doors causedhim to turn. He squinted back toward the main entrance and saw an elderlyAfrican American man outside, rapping on the glass with his open palm andmotioning to be let in.Nuñez shook his head and pointed to his watch.The man pounded again and stepped into the light. He was immaculately dressed ina blue suit and had close-cropped graying hair. Nuñez’s pulse quickened. Holyshit. Even at a distance, Nuñez now recognized who this man was. He hurried backto the entrance and unlocked the door. “I’m sorry, sir. Please, please come in.”Warren Bellamy—Architect of the Capitol—stepped across the threshold and thankedNuñez with a polite nod. Bellamy was lithe and slender, with an erect postureand piercing gaze that exuded the confidence of a man in full control of hissurroundings. For the last twenty-five years, Bellamy had served as thesupervisor of the U.S. Capitol.“May I help you, sir?” Nuñez asked.“Thank you, yes.” Bellamy enunciated his words with crisp precision. As anortheastern Ivy League graduate, his diction was so exacting he sounded almostBritish. “I’ve just learned that you had an incident here this evening.” Helooked deeply concerned.“Yes, sir. It was—”“Where’s Chief Anderson?”“Downstairs with Director Sato from the CIA’s Office of Security.”Bellamy’s eyes widened with concern. “The CIA is here?”“Yes, sir. Director Sato arrived almost immediately after the incident.”“Why?” Bellamy demanded.Nuñez shrugged. As if I was going to ask?Bellamy strode directly toward the escalators. “Where are they?”“They just went to the lower levels.” Nuñez hastened after him.Bellamy glanced back with a look of concern. “Downstairs? Why?” “I don’t reallyknow—I just heard it on my radio.”Bellamy was moving faster now. “Take me to them right away.”“Yes, sir.”As the two men hurried across the open expanse, Nuñez caught a glimpse of alarge golden ring on Bellamy’s finger.Nuñez pulled out his radio. “I’ll alert the chief that you’re coming down.”“No.” Bellamy’s eyes flashed dangerously. “I’d prefer to be unannounced.”Nuñez had made some big mistakes tonight, but failing to alert Chief Andersonthat the Architect was now in the building would be his last. “Sir?” he said,uneasy. “I think Chief Anderson would prefer—”“You are aware that I employ Mr. Anderson?” Bellamy said.Nuñez nodded.“Then I think he would prefer you obey my wishes.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 34Trish Dunne entered the SMSC lobby and looked up with surprise. The guestwaiting here looked nothing like the usual bookish, flannel-clad doctors whoentered this building—those of anthropology, oceanography, geology, and otherscientific fields. Quite to the contrary, Dr. Abaddon looked almost aristocraticin his impeccably tailored suit. He was tall, with a broad torso, well-tannedface, and perfectly combed blond hair that gave Trish the impression he was moreaccustomed to luxuries than to laboratories.“Dr. Abaddon, I presume?” Trish said, extending her hand.The man looked uncertain, but he took Trish’s plump hand in his broad palm. “I’msorry. And you are?”“Trish Dunne,” she replied. “I’m Katherine’s assistant. She asked me to escortyou back to her lab.”“Oh, I see.” The man smiled now. “Very nice to meet you, Trish. My apologies ifI seemed confused. I was under the impression Katherine was here alone thisevening.” He motioned down the hall. “But I’m all yours. Lead the way.”Despite the man’s quick recovery, Trish had seen the flash of disappointment inhis eyes. She now suspected the motive for Katherine’s secrecy earlier about Dr.Abaddon. A budding romance, maybe? Katherine never discussed her social life,but her visitor was attractive and well-groomed, and although younger thanKatherine, he clearly came from her world of wealth and privilege. Nonetheless,whatever Dr. Abaddon had imagined tonight’s visit might entail, Trish’s presencedid not seem to be part of his plan.At the lobby’s security checkpoint, a lone guard quickly pulled off hisheadphones, and Trish could hear the Redskins game blaring. The guard put Dr.Abaddon through the usual visitor routine of metal detectors and temporarysecurity badges.“Who’s winning?” Dr. Abaddon said affably as he emptied his pockets of a cellphone, some keys, and a cigarette lighter.“Skins by three,” the guard said, sounding eager to get back. “Helluva game.”“Mr. Solomon will be arriving shortly,” Trish told the guard. “Would you pleasesend him back to the lab once he arrives?”“Will do.” The guard gave an appreciative wink as they passed through. “Thanksfor the heads-up. I’ll look busy.”Trish’s comment had been not only for the benefit of the guard but also toremind Dr. Abaddon that Trish was not the only one intruding on his privateevening here with Katherine.“So how do you know Katherine?” Trish asked, glancing up at the mysteriousguest.Dr. Abaddon chuckled. “Oh, it’s a long story. We’ve been working on somethingtogether.”Understood, Trish thought. None of my business.“This is an amazing facility,” Abaddon said, glancing around as they moved downthe massive corridor. “I’ve never actually been here.”His airy tone was becoming more genial with every step, and Trish noticed he wasactively taking it all in. In the bright lights of the hallway, she also noticedthat his face looked like he had a fake tan. Odd. Nonetheless, as they navigatedthe deserted corridors, Trish gave him a general synopsis of the SMSC’s purposeand function, including the various pods and their contents.The visitor looked impressed. “Sounds like this place has a treasure trove ofpriceless artifacts. I would have expected guards posted everywhere.”“No need,” Trish said, motioning to the row of fish-eye lenses lining theceiling high above. “Security here is automated. Every inch of this corridor isrecorded twenty-four/seven, and this corridor is the spine of the facility. It’simpossible to access any of the rooms off this corridor without a key card andPIN number.”“Efficient use of cameras.”“Knock on wood, we’ve never had a theft. Then again, this is not the kind ofmuseum anyone would rob—there’s not much call on the black market for extinctflowers, Inuit kayaks, or giant squid carcasses.”Dr. Abaddon chuckled. “I suppose you’re right.”“Our biggest security threat is rodents and insects.” Trish explained how thebuilding prevented insect infestations by freezing all SMSC refuse and also byan architectural feature called a “dead zone”—an inhospitable compartmentbetween double walls, which surrounded the entire building like a sheath.“Incredible,” Abaddon said. “So, where is Katherine and Peter’s lab?”“Pod Five,” Trish said. “It’s all the way at the end of this hallway.”Abaddon halted suddenly, spinning to his right, toward a small window. “My word!Will you look at that!”Trish laughed. “Yeah, that’s Pod Three. They call it Wet Pod.”“Wet?” Abaddon said, face pressed to the glass.“There are over three thousand gallons of liquid ethanol in there. Remember thegiant squid carcass I mentioned earlier?”“That’s the squid?!” Dr. Abaddon turned from the window momentarily, his eyeswide. “It’s huge!”“A female Architeuthis,” Trish said. “She’s over forty feet.”Dr. Abaddon, apparently enraptured by the sight of the squid, seemed unable topull his eyes away from the glass. For a moment, the grown man reminded Trish ofa little boy at a pet-store window, wishing he could go in and see a puppy. Fiveseconds later, he was still staring longingly through the window.“Okay, okay,” Trish finally said, laughing as she inserted her key card andtyped her PIN number. “Come on. I’ll show you the squid.”As Mal’akh stepped into the dimly lit world of Pod 3, he scanned the walls forsecurity cameras. Katherine’s pudgy little assistant began rattling on about thespecimens in this room. Mal’akh tuned her out. He had no interest whatsoever ingiant squids. His only interest was in using this dark, private space to solvean unexpected problem."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 35The wooden stairs descending to the Capitol’s subbasement were as steep andshallow as any stairs Langdon had ever traversed. His breathing was faster now,and his lungs felt tight. The air down here was cold and damp, and Langdoncouldn’t help but flash on a similar set of stairs he had taken a few years backinto the Vatican’s Necropolis. The City of the Dead.Ahead of him, Anderson led the way with his flashlight. Behind Langdon, Satofollowed closely, her tiny hands occasionally pressing into Langdon’s back. I’mgoing as fast as I can. Langdon inhaled deeply, trying to ignore the crampedwalls on either side of him. There was barely room for his shoulders on thisstaircase, and his daybag now scraped down the sidewall.“Maybe you should leave your bag above,” Sato offered behind him.“I’m fine,” Langdon replied, having no intention of letting it out of his sight.He pictured Peter’s little package and could not begin to imagine how it mightrelate to anything in the subbasement of the U.S. Capitol.“Just a few more steps,” Anderson said. “Almost there.”The group had descended into darkness, moving beyond the reach of thestaircase’s lone lightbulb. When Langdon stepped off the final wooden tread, hecould feel that the floor beneath his feet was dirt. Journey to the center ofthe Earth. Sato stepped down behind him.Anderson now raised his beam, examining their surroundings. The subbasement wasless of a basement than it was an ultranarrow corridor that ran perpendicular tothe stairs. Anderson shone his light left and then right, and Langdon could seethe passage was only about fifty feet long and lined on both sides with smallwooden doors. The doors abutted one another so closely that the rooms behindthem could not have been more than ten feet wide.ACME Storage meets the Catacombs of Domatilla, Langdon thought as Andersonconsulted the blueprint. The tiny section depicting the subbasement was markedwith an X to show the location of SBB13. Langdon couldn’t help but notice thatthe layout was identical to a fourteen-tomb mausoleum—seven vaults facing sevenvaults—with one removed to accommodate the stairs they had just descended.Thirteen in all.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_007_r1.jpg]He suspected America’s “thirteen” conspiracy theorists would have a field day ifthey knew there were exactly thirteen storage rooms buried beneath the U.S.Capitol. Some found it suspicious that the Great Seal of the United States hadthirteen stars, thirteen arrows, thirteen pyramid steps, thirteen shieldstripes, thirteen olive leaves, thirteen olives, thirteen letters in annuitcoeptis, thirteen letters in e pluribus unum, and on and on.“It does look abandoned,” Anderson said, shining the beam into the chamberdirectly in front of them. The heavy wooden door was wide open. The shaft oflight illuminated a narrow stone chamber—about ten feet wide by some thirty feetdeep—like a dead-end hallway to nowhere. The chamber contained nothing more thana couple of old collapsed wooden boxes and some crumpled packing paper.Anderson shone his light on a copper plate mounted on the door. The plate wascovered with verdigris, but the old marking was legible:SBB IV“SBB Four,” Anderson said.“Which one is SBB Thirteen?” Sato asked, faint wisps of steam curling out of hermouth in the cold subterranean air.Anderson turned the beam toward the south end of the corridor. “Down there.”Langdon peered down the narrow passage and shivered, feeling a light sweatdespite the cold.As they moved through the phalanx of doorways, all of the rooms looked the same,doors ajar, apparently abandoned long ago. When they reached the end of theline, Anderson turned to his right, raising the beam to peer into room SBB13.The flashlight beam, however, was impeded by a heavy wooden door.Unlike the others, the door to SBB13 was closed.This final door looked exactly like the others—heavy hinges, iron handle, and acopper number plate encrusted with green. The seven characters on the numberplate were the same characters on Peter’s palm upstairs.SBB XIIIPlease tell me the door is locked, Langdon thought.Sato spoke without hesitation. “Try the door.”The police chief looked uneasy, but he reached out, grasped the heavy ironhandle, and pushed down on it. The handle didn’t budge. He shone the light now,illuminating a heavy, old-fashioned lock plate and keyhole.“Try the master key,” Sato said.Anderson produced the main key from the entry door upstairs, but it was not evenclose to fitting.“Am I mistaken,” Sato said, her tone sarcastic, “or shouldn’t Security haveaccess to every corner of a building in case of emergency?”Anderson exhaled and looked back at Sato. “Ma’am, my men are checking for asecondary key, but—”“Shoot the lock,” she said, nodding toward the key plate beneath the lever.Langdon’s pulse leaped.Anderson cleared his throat, sounding uneasy. “Ma’am, I’m waiting for news on asecondary key. I am not sure I’m comfortable blasting our way into—”“Perhaps you’d be more comfortable in prison for obstructing a CIAinvestigation?”Anderson looked incredulous. After a long beat, he reluctantly handed the lightto Sato and unsnapped his holster.“Wait!” Langdon said, no longer able to stand idly by. “Think about it. Petergave up his right hand rather than reveal whatever might be behind this door.Are you sure we want to do this? Unlocking this door is essentially complyingwith the demands of a terrorist.”“Do you want to get Peter Solomon back?” Sato asked.“Of course, but—”“Then I suggest you do exactly what his captor is requesting.”“Unlock an ancient portal? You think this is the portal?”Sato shone the light in Langdon’s face. “Professor, I have no idea what the hellthis is. Whether it’s a storage unit or the secret entrance to an ancientpyramid, I intend to open it. Do I make myself clear?”Langdon squinted into the light and finally nodded.Sato lowered the beam and redirected it at the door’s antique key plate. “Chief?Go ahead.”Still looking averse to the plan, Anderson extracted his sidearm very, veryslowly, gazing down at it with uncertainty.“Oh, for God’s sake!” Sato’s tiny hands shot out, and she grabbed the weaponfrom him. She stuffed the flashlight into his now empty palm. “Shine the damnedlight.” She handled the gun with the confidence of someone who had trained withweapons, wasting no time turning off the pistol’s safety, cocking the weapon,and aiming at the lock.“Wait!” Langdon yelled, but he was too late.The gun roared three times.Langdon’s eardrums felt like they had exploded. Is she insane?! The gunshots inthe tiny space had been deafening.Anderson also looked shaken, his hand wavering a bit as he shone the flashlighton the bullet-riddled door.The lock mechanism was now in tatters, the wood surrounding it entirelypulverized. The lock had released, the door now having fallen ajar.Sato extended the pistol and pressed the tip of the barrel against the door,giving it a push. The door swung fully into the blackness beyond.Langdon peered in but could see nothing in the darkness. What in the world isthat smell? An unusual, fetid odor wafted out of the darkness.Anderson stepped into the doorway and shone the light on the floor, tracingcarefully down the length of the barren dirt floor. This room was like theothers—a long, narrow space. The sidewalls were rugged stone, giving the roomthe feel of an ancient prison cell. But that smell . . .“There’s nothing here,” Anderson said, moving the beam farther down the chamberfloor. Finally, as the beam reached the end of the floor, he raised it up toilluminate the chamber’s farthest wall.“My God . . . !” Anderson shouted.Everyone saw it and jumped back.Langdon stared in disbelief at the deepest recess of the chamber.To his horror, something was staring back."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36“What in God’s name . . . ?” At the threshold of SBB13, Anderson fumbled withhis light and retreated a step.Langdon also recoiled, as did Sato, who looked startled for the first time allnight.Sato aimed the gun at the back wall and motioned for Anderson to shine the lightagain. Anderson raised the light. The beam was dim by the time it reached thefar wall, but the light was enough to illuminate the shape of a pallid andghostly face, staring back at them through lifeless sockets.A human skull.The skull sat atop a rickety wooden desk positioned against the rear wall of thechamber. Two human leg bones sat beside the skull, along with a collection ofother items that were meticulously arranged on the desk in shrinelike fashion—anantique hourglass, a crystal flask, a candle, two saucers of pale powder, and asheet of paper. Propped against the wall beside the desk stood the fearsomeshape of a long scythe, its curved blade as familiar as that of the grim reaper.Sato stepped into the room. “Well, now . . . it appears Peter Solomon keeps moresecrets than I imagined.”Anderson nodded, inching after her. “Talk about skeletons in your closet.” Heraised the light and surveyed the rest of the empty chamber. “And that smell?”he added, crinkling his nose. “What is it?”“Sulfur,” Langdon replied evenly behind them. “There should be two saucers onthe desk. The saucer on the right will contain salt. And the other sulfur.”Sato wheeled in disbelief. “How the hell would you know that?!”“Because, ma’am, there are rooms exactly like this all over the world.”One story above the subbasement, Capitol security guard Nuñez escorted theArchitect of the Capitol, Warren Bellamy, down the long hallway that ran thelength of the eastern basement. Nuñez could have sworn that he had just heardthree gunshots down here, muffled and underground.There’s no way.“Subbasement door is open,” Bellamy said, squinting down the hallway at a doorthat stood ajar in the distance.Strange evening indeed, Nuñez thought. Nobody goes down there. “I’ll be glad tofind out what’s going on,” he said, reaching for his radio.“Go back to your duties,” Bellamy said. “I’m fine from here.”Nuñez shifted uneasily. “You sure?”Warren Bellamy stopped, placing a firm hand on Nuñez’s shoulder. “Son, I’veworked here for twenty-five years. I think I can find my way.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 37Mal’akh had seen some eerie spaces in his life, but few rivaled the unearthlyworld of Pod 3. Wet Pod. The massive room looked as if a mad scientist had takenover a Walmart and packed every aisle and shelf with specimen jars of all shapesand sizes. Lit like a photographic darkroom, the space was bathed in a reddishhaze of “safelight” that emanated from beneath the shelves, filtering upward andilluminating the ethanol-filled containers. The clinical smell of preservativechemicals was nauseating.“This pod houses over twenty thousand species,” the chubby girl was saying.“Fish, rodents, mammals, reptiles.”“All dead, I hope?” Mal’akh asked, making a show of sounding nervous.The girl laughed. “Yes, yes. All very much dead. I’ll admit, I didn’t dare comein for at least six months after I started work.”Mal’akh could understand why. Everywhere he looked there were specimen jars ofdead life-forms—salamanders, jellyfish, rats, bugs, birds, and other things hecould not begin to identify. As if this collection were not unsettling enough onits own, the hazy red safelights that protected these photosensitive specimensfrom long-term light exposure gave the visitor the feeling he was standinginside a giant aquarium, where lifeless creatures were somehow congregating towatch from the shadows.“That’s a coelacanth,” the girl said, pointing to a big Plexiglas container thatheld the ugliest fish Mal’akh had ever seen. “They were thought to be extinctwith the dinosaurs, but this was caught off Africa a few years back and donatedto the Smithsonian.”Lucky you, Mal’akh thought, barely listening. He was busy scanning the walls forsecurity cameras. He saw only one—trained on the entry door—not surprising,considering that entrance was probably the only way in.“And here is what you wanted to see . . .” she said, leading him to the gianttank he had seen from the window. “Our longest specimen.” She swept her arm outover the vile creature like a game-show host displaying a new car.“Architeuthis.”The squid tank looked like a series of glass phone booths had been laid on theirsides and fused end to end. Within the long, clear Plexiglas coffin hovered asickeningly pale and amorphous shape. Mal’akh gazed down at the bulbous, saclikehead and its basketball-size eyes. “Almost makes your coelacanth look handsome,”he said.“Wait till you see her lit.”Trish flipped back the long lid of the tank. Ethanol fumes wafted out as shereached down into the tank and flipped a switch just above the liquid line. Astring of fluorescent lights flickered to life along the entire base of thetank. Architeuthis was now shining in all her glory—a colossal head attached toa slithery mass of decaying tentacles and razor-sharp suckers.She began talking about how Architeuthis could beat a sperm whale in a fight.Mal’akh heard only empty prattling.The time had come.Trish Dunne always felt a bit uneasy in Pod 3, but the chill that had just runthrough her felt different.Visceral. Primal.She tried to ignore it, but it grew quickly now, clawing deeply at her. AlthoughTrish could not seem to place the source of her anxiety, her gut was clearlytelling her it was time to leave.“Anyhow, that’s the squid,” she said, reaching into the tank and turning off thedisplay light. “We should probably get back to Katherine’s—”A broad palm clamped hard over her mouth, yanking her head back. Instantly, apowerful arm was wrapped around her torso, pinning her against a rock-hardchest. For a split second, Trish went numb with shock.Then came the terror.The man groped across her chest, grabbing her key card and yanking down hard.The cord burned the back of her neck before snapping. The key card fell on thefloor at their feet. She fought, trying to twist away, but she was no match forthe man’s size and strength. She tried to scream, but his hand remained tightlyacross her mouth. He leaned down and placed his mouth next to her ear,whispering, “When I take my hand off your mouth, you will not scream, is thatclear?”She nodded vigorously, her lungs burning for air. I can’t breathe!The man removed his hand from her mouth, and Trish gasped, inhaling deeply.“Let me go!” she demanded, breathless. “What the hell are you doing?”“Tell me your PIN number,” the man said.Trish felt totally at a loss. Katherine! Help! Who is this man?! “Security cansee you!” she said, knowing full well they were out of range of the cameras. Andnobody is watching anyway.“Your PIN number,” the man repeated. “The one that matches your key card.”An icy fear churned in her gut, and Trish spun violently, wriggling an arm freeand twisting around, clawing at the man’s eyes. Her fingers hit flesh and rakeddown one cheek. Four dark gashes opened on his flesh where she scratched him.Then she realized the dark stripes on his flesh were not blood. The man waswearing makeup, which she had just scratched off, revealing dark tattoos hiddenunderneath.Who is this monster?!With seemingly superhuman strength, the man spun her around and hoisted her up,pushing her out over the open squid tank, her face now over the ethanol. Thefumes burned her nostrils.“What is your PIN number?” he repeated.Her eyes burned, and she could see the pale flesh of the squid submerged beneathher face.“Tell me,” he said, pushing her face closer to the surface. “What is it?”Her throat was burning now. “Zero-eight-zero-four!” she blurted, barely able tobreathe. “Let me go! Zero-eight-zero-four!”“If you’re lying,” he said, pushing down farther, her hair in the ethanol now.“I’m not lying!” she said, coughing. “August 4! It’s my birthday!”“Thank you, Trish.”His powerful hands clasped her head tighter, and a crushing force rammed herdownward, plunging her face into the tank. Searing pain burned her eyes. The manpressed down harder, driving her whole head under the ethanol. Trish felt herface pressing into the fleshy head of the squid.Summoning all of her strength, she bucked violently, arching backward, trying topull her head out of the tank. But the powerful hands did not budge.I have to breathe!She remained submerged, straining not to open her eyes or mouth. Her lungsburned as she fought the powerful urge to breathe in. No! Don’t! But Trish’sinhalation reflex finally took over.Her mouth flew open, and her lungs expanded violently, attempting to suck in theoxygen that her body craved. In a searing rush, a wave of ethanol poured intoher mouth. As the chemicals gushed down her throat into her lungs, Trish felt apain like nothing she had ever imagined possible. Mercifully, it lasted only afew seconds before her world went black.Mal’akh stood beside the tank, catching his breath and surveying the damage.The lifeless woman lay slumped over the rim of the tank, her face stillsubmerged in ethanol. Seeing her there, Mal’akh flashed on the only other womanhe had ever killed.Isabel Solomon.Long ago. Another life.Mal’akh gazed down now at the woman’s flaccid corpse. He grabbed her ample hipsand lifted with his legs, hoisting her up, pushing forward, until she began toslide over the rim of the squid tank. Trish Dunne slithered headfirst down intothe ethanol. The rest of her body followed, sloshing down. Gradually, theripples subsided, leaving the woman hovering limp over the huge sea creature. Asher clothing got heavier, she began to sink, slipping into the darkness. Bit bybit, Trish Dunne’s body settled on top of the great beast.Mal’akh wiped his hands and replaced the Plexiglas lid, sealing the tank.Wet Pod has a new specimen.He retrieved Trish’s key card from the floor and slipped it in his pocket: 0804.When Mal’akh had first seen Trish in the lobby, he’d seen a liability. Then he’drealized her key card and password were his insurance. If Katherine’sdata-storage room was as secure as Peter had implied, then Mal’akh wasanticipating some challenges persuading Katherine to unlock it for him. I nowhave my own set of keys. He was pleased to know he would no longer have to wastetime bending Katherine to his will.As Mal’akh stood up straight, he saw his own reflection in the window and couldtell his makeup was badly mangled. It didn’t matter anymore. By the timeKatherine put it all together, it would be too late."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38“This room is Masonic?” Sato demanded, turning from the skull and staring atLangdon in the darkness.Langdon nodded calmly. “It’s called a Chamber of Reflection. These rooms aredesigned as cold, austere places in which a Mason can reflect on his ownmortality. By meditating on the inevitability of death, a Mason gains a valuableperspective on the fleeting nature of life.”Sato looked around the eerie space, apparently not convinced. “This is some kindof meditation room?”“Essentially, yes. These chambers always incorporate the same symbols—skull andcrossed bones, scythe, hourglass, sulfur, salt, blank paper, a candle, etcetera. The symbols of death inspire Masons to ponder how better to lead theirlives while on this earth.”“It looks like a death shrine,” Anderson said.That’s kind of the point. “Most of my symbology students have the same reactionat first.” Langdon often assigned them Symbols of Freemasonry by Beresniak,which contained beautiful photos of Chambers of Reflection.“And your students,” Sato demanded, “don’t find it unnerving that Masonsmeditate with skulls and scythes?”“No more unnerving than Christians praying at the feet of a man nailed to across, or Hindus chanting in front of a four-armed elephant named Ganesh.Misunderstanding a culture’s symbols is a common root of prejudice.”Sato turned away, apparently in no mood for a lecture. She moved toward thetable of artifacts. Anderson tried to light her way with the flashlight, but thebeam was beginning to dim. He tapped the heel of the light and coaxed it to burna little brighter.As the threesome moved deeper into the narrow space, the pungent tang of sulfurfilled Langdon’s nostrils. The subbasement was damp, and the humidity in the airwas activating the sulfur in the bowl. Sato arrived at the table and stared downat the skull and accompanying objects.Anderson joined her, doing his best to light the desk with the weakening beam ofhis flashlight.Sato examined everything on the table and then placed her hands on her hips,sighing. “What is all this junk?”The artifacts in this room, Langdon knew, were carefully selected and arranged.“Symbols of transformation,” he told her, feeling confined as he inched forwardand joined them at the table. “The skull, or caput mortuum, represents man’sfinal transformation through decay; it’s a reminder that we all shed our mortalflesh one day. The sulfur and salt are alchemical catalysts that facilitatetransformation. The hourglass represents the transformational power of time.” Hemotioned to the unlit candle. “And this candle represents the formativeprimordial fire and the awakening of man from his ignorantslumber—transformation through illumination.”“And . . . that?” Sato asked, pointing into the corner.Anderson swung his dimming flashlight beam to the giant scythe that leanedagainst the back wall.“Not a death symbol, as most assume,” Langdon said. “The scythe is actually asymbol of the transformative nourishment of nature—the reaping of nature’sgifts.”Sato and Anderson fell silent, apparently trying to process their bizarresurroundings.Langdon wanted nothing more than to get out of the place. “I realize this roommay seem unusual,” he told them, “but there’s nothing to see here; it’s reallyquite normal. A lot of Masonic lodges have chambers exactly like this one.”“But this is not a Masonic lodge!”Anderson declared. “It’s the U.S. Capitol, andI’d like to know what the hell this room is doing in my building.”“Sometimes Masons set aside rooms like this in their offices or private homes asmeditation spaces. It is not uncommon.” Langdon knew a heart surgeon in Bostonwho had converted a closet in his office into a Masonic Chamber of Reflection sohe could ponder mortality before going into surgery.Sato looked troubled. “You’re saying Peter Solomon comes down here to reflect ondeath?”“I really don’t know,” Langdon said sincerely. “Maybe he created it as asanctuary for his Masonic brothers who work in the building, giving them aspiritual sanctuary away from the chaos of the material world . . . a place fora powerful lawmaker to reflect before making decisions that affect his fellowman.”“Lovely sentiment,” Sato said, her tone sarcastic, “but I have a feelingAmericans might have a problem with their leaders praying in closets withscythes and skulls.”Well, they shouldn’t, Langdon thought, imagining how different a world it mightbe if more leaders took time to ponder the finality of death before racing offto war.Sato pursed her lips and carefully surveyed all four corners of the candle litchamber. “There must be something in here besides human bones and bowls ofchemicals, Professor. Someone transported you all the way from your home inCambridge to be in this precise room.”Langdon clutched his daybag to his side, still unable to imagine how the packagehe carried might relate to this chamber. “Ma’am, I’m sorry, but I don’t seeanything out of the ordinary here.” Langdon hoped that now at last they couldget to the business of trying to find Peter.Anderson’s light flickered again, and Sato spun on him, her temper starting toshow. “For Christ’s sake, is it too much to ask?” She plunged her hand into herpocket and yanked out a cigarette lighter. Striking her thumb on the flint, sheheld out the flame and lit the desk’s lone candle. The wick sputtered and thencaught, spreading a ghostly luminescence throughout the constricted space. Longshadows raked the stone walls. As the flame grew brighter, an unexpected sightmaterialized before them.“Look!” Anderson said, pointing.In the candlelight, they could now see a faded patch of graffiti—seven capitalletters scrawled across the rear wall.VITRIOL“An odd choice of word,” Sato said as the candlelight cast a frighteningskull-shaped silhouette across the letters.“Actually, it’s an acronym,” Langdon said. “It’s written on the rear wall ofmost chambers like this as a shorthand for the Masonic meditative mantra: Visitainteriora terrae, rectificando invenies occultum lapidem.”Sato eyed him, looking almost impressed. “Meaning?”“Visit the interior of the earth, and by rectifying, you will find the hiddenstone.”Sato’s gaze sharpened. “Does the hidden stone have any connection to a hiddenpyramid?”Langdon shrugged, not wanting to encourage the comparison. “Those who enjoyfantasizing about hidden pyramids in Washington would tell you that occultumlapidem refers to the stone pyramid, yes. Others will tell you it’s a referenceto the Philosopher’s Stone—a substance alchemists believed could bring themeverlasting life or turn lead into gold. Others claim it’s a reference to theHoly of Holies, a hidden stone chamber at the core of the Great Temple. Some sayit’s a Christian reference to the hidden teachings of Saint Peter—the Rock.Every esoteric tradition interprets ‘the stone’ in its own way, but invariablythe occultum lapidem is a source of power and enlightenment.”Anderson cleared his throat. “Is it possible Solomon lied to this guy? Maybe hetold him there was something down here . . . and there really isn’t.”Langdon was having similar thoughts.Without warning, the candle flame flickered, as if caught by a draft. It dimmedfor a moment and then recovered, burning brightly again.“That’s odd,” Anderson said. “I hope no one closed the door upstairs.” He strodeout of the chamber into the darkness of the hallway. “Hello?”Langdon barely noticed him leave. His gaze had been drawn suddenly to the rearwall. What just happened?“Did you see that?” Sato asked, also staring with alarm at the wall.Langdon nodded, his pulse quickening. What did I just see?A moment earlier, the rear wall seemed to have shimmered, as if a ripple ofenergy had passed through it.Anderson now strode back into the room. “No one’s out there.” As he entered, thewall shimmered again. “Holy shit!” he exclaimed, jumping back.All three stood mute for a long moment, staring in unison at the back wall.Langdon felt another chill run through him as he realized what they were seeing.He reached out tentatively, until his fingertips touched the rear surface of thechamber. “It’s not a wall,” he said.Anderson and Sato stepped closer, peering intently.“It’s a canvas,” Langdon said.“But it billowed,” Sato said quickly.Yes, in a very strange way. Langdon examined the surface more closely. The sheenon the canvas had refracted the candlelight in a startling manner because thecanvas had just billowed away from the room . . . fluttering backward throughthe plane of the rear wall.Langdon extended his outstretched fingers very gently, pressing the canvasbackward. Startled, he yanked his hand back. There’s an opening!“Pull it aside,” Sato ordered.Langdon’s heart pounded wildly now. He reached up and clutched the edge of thecanvas banner, slowly pulling the fabric to one side. He stared in disbelief atwhat lay hidden behind it. My God.Sato and Anderson stood in stunned silence as they looked through the opening inthe rear wall.Finally, Sato spoke. “It appears we’ve just found our pyramid.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 39Robert Langdon stared at the opening in the rear wall of the chamber. Hiddenbehind the canvas banner, a perfectly square hole had been hollowed out of thewall. The opening, about three feet across, appeared to have been created byremoving a series of bricks. For a moment, in the darkness, Langdon thought thehole was a window to a room beyond.Now he saw it was not.The opening extended only a few feet into the wall before terminating. Like arough-hewn cubbyhole, the recessed niche reminded Langdon of a museum alcovedesigned to hold a statuette. Fittingly, this niche displayed one small object.About nine inches tall, it was a piece of carved, solid granite. The surface waselegant and smooth with four polished sides that shone in the candlelight.Langdon could not fathom what it was doing here. A stone pyramid?“From your look of surprise,” Sato said, sounding self-satisfied, “I take itthis object is not typical within a Chamber of Reflection?”Langdon shook his head.“Then perhaps you would like to reassess your previous claims regarding thelegend of a Masonic Pyramid hidden in Washington?” Her tone now was almost smug.“Director,” Langdon replied instantly, “this little pyramid is not the MasonicPyramid.”“So it is merely coincidence that we found a pyramid hidden at the heart of theU.S. Capitol in a secret chamber belonging to a Masonic leader?”Langdon rubbed his eyes and tried to think clearly. “Ma’am, this pyramid doesn’tresemble the myth in any way. The Masonic Pyramid is described as enormous, witha tip forged of solid gold.”Moreover, Langdon knew, this little pyramid—with its flat top—was not even atrue pyramid. Without its tip, this was another symbol entirely. Known as anUnfinished Pyramid, it was a symbolic reminder that man’s ascent to his fullhuman potential was always a work in progress. Though few realized it, thissymbol was the most widely published symbol on earth. Over twenty billion inprint. Adorning every one-dollar bill in circulation, the Unfinished Pyramidwaited patiently for its shining capstone, which hovered above it as a reminderof America’s yet-unfulfilled destiny and the work yet to be done, both as acountry and as individuals.“Lift it down,” Sato said to Anderson, motioning to the pyramid. “I want acloser look.” She began making room on the desk by shoving the skull and crossedbones to one side with no reverence whatsoever.Langdon was starting to feel like they were common grave robbers, desecrating apersonal shrine.Anderson maneuvered past Langdon, reached into the niche, and clamped his largepalms on either side of the pyramid. Then, barely able to lift at this awkwardangle, he slid the pyramid toward him and lowered it with a hard thud onto thewooden desk. He stepped back to give Sato room.The director repositioned the candle close to the pyramid and studied itspolished surface. Slowly, she ran her tiny fingers over it, examining every inchof the flat top, and then the sides. She wrapped her hands around to feel theback, then frowned in apparent disappointment. “Professor, earlier you said theMasonic Pyramid was constructed to protect secret information.”“That’s the legend, yes.”“So, hypothetically speaking, if Peter’s captor believed this was the MasonicPyramid, he would believe it contained powerful information.”Langdon nodded, exasperated. “Yes, although even if he found this information,he probably would not be able to read it. According to legend, the contents ofthe pyramid are encoded, making them indecipherable . . . except to the mostworthy.”“I beg your pardon?”Despite Langdon’s growing impatience, he replied with an even tone.“Mythological treasures are always protected by tests of worthiness. As you mayrecall, in the legend of the Sword in the Stone, the stone refuses to give upthe sword except to Arthur, who was spiritually prepared to wield the sword’sawesome power. The Masonic Pyramid is based on the same idea. In this case, theinformation is the treasure, and it is said to be written in an encodedlanguage—a mystical tongue of lost words—legible only to the worthy.”A faint smile crossed Sato’s lips. “That may explain why you were summoned heretonight.”“I’m sorry?”Calmly, Sato rotated the pyramid in place, turning it a full 180 degrees. Thepyramid’s fourth side now shone in the candlelight.Robert Langdon stared at it with surprise.“It appears,” Sato said, “that someone believes you’re worthy.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 40What’s taking Trish so long?Katherine Solomon checked her watch again. She’d forgotten to warn Dr. Abaddonabout the bizarre commute to her lab, but she couldn’t imagine the darkness hadslowed them down this much. They should have arrived by now.Katherine walked over to the exit and heaved open the lead-lined door, staringout into the void. She listened for a moment, but heard nothing.“Trish?” she called out, her voice swallowed by the darkness.Silence.Puzzled, she closed the door, took out her cell phone, and called the lobby.“This is Katherine. Is Trish out there?”“No, ma’am,” the lobby guard said. “She and your guest headed back about tenminutes ago.”“Really? I don’t think they’re even inside Pod Five yet.”“Hold on. I’ll check.” Katherine could hear the guard’s fingers clicking on hiscomputer keyboard. “You’re right. According to Ms. Dunne’s key-card logs, shehas not yet opened the Pod Five door. Her last access event was about eightminutes ago . . . at Pod Three. I guess she’s giving your guest a little tour onhis way in.”Katherine frowned. Apparently. The news was a bit odd, but at least she knewTrish wouldn’t be long in Pod 3. The smell in there is terrible. “Thanks. Has mybrother arrived yet?”“No, ma’am, not yet.”“Thank you.”As Katherine hung up, she felt an unexpected twinge of trepidation. The uneasyfeeling made her pause, but only for a moment. It was the same exact disquietshe’d felt earlier when she stepped into Dr. Abaddon’s house. Embarrassingly,her feminine intuition had failed her there. Badly.It’s nothing, Katherine told herself."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 41Robert Langdon studied the stone pyramid. This isn’t possible.“An ancient encoded language,” Sato said without looking up. “Tell me, does thisqualify?”On the newly exposed face of the pyramid, a series of sixteen characters wasprecisely engraved into the smooth stone.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_010_r1.jpg]Beside Langdon, Anderson’s mouth now gaped open, mirroring Langdon’s own shock.The security chief looked like he had just seen some kind of alien keypad.“Professor?” Sato said. “I assume you can read this?”Langdon turned. “Why would you assume that?”“Because you were brought here, Professor. You were chosen. This inscriptionappears to be a code of some sort, and considering your reputation, it seemsobvious to me that you were brought here to decipher it.”Langdon had to admit that after his experiences in Rome and Paris, he’d receiveda steady flow of requests asking for his help deciphering some of history’sgreat unsolved codes—the Phaistos Disk, the Dorabella Cipher, the mysteriousVoynich Manuscript.Sato ran her finger over the inscription. “Can you tell me the meaning of theseicons?”They’re not icons, Langdon thought. They’re symbols. The language was one he hadrecognized immediately—an encrypted cipher language from the seventeenthcentury. Langdon knew very well how to break it. “Ma’am,” he said, feelinghesitant, “this pyramid is Peter’s private property.”“Private or not, if this code is indeed the reason you were brought toWashington, I am not giving you a choice in the matter. I want to know what itsays.”Sato’s BlackBerry pinged loudly, and she yanked the device from her pocket,studying the incoming message for several moments. Langdon was amazed that theCapitol Building’s internal wireless network provided service this far down.Sato grunted and raised her eyebrows, giving Langdon an odd look.“Chief Anderson?” she said, turning to him. “A word in private, if I may?” Thedirector motioned for Anderson to join her, and they disappeared into thepitch-black hallway, leaving Langdon alone in the flickering candlelight ofPeter’s Chamber of Reflection.Chief Anderson wondered when this night would end. A severed hand in my Rotunda?A death shrine in my basement? Bizarre engravings on a stone pyramid? Somehow,the Redskins game no longer felt significant.As he followed Sato into the darkness of the hall, Anderson flicked on hisflashlight. The beam was weak but better than nothing. Sato led him down thehall a few yards, out of sight of Langdon.“Have a look at this,” she whispered, handing Anderson her BlackBerry.Anderson took the device and squinted at the illuminated screen. It displayed ablack-and-white image—the X-ray of Langdon’s bag that Anderson had requested besent to Sato. As in all X-rays, the objects of greatest density appeared in thebrightest white. In Langdon’s bag, a lone item outshone everything else.Obviously extremely dense, the object glowed like a dazzling jewel in a murkyjumble of other items. Its shape was unmistakable.He’s been carrying that all night? Anderson looked over at Sato in surprise.“Why didn’t Langdon mention this?”“Damned good question,” Sato whispered.“The shape . . . it can’t be coincidence.”“No,” Sato said, her tone angry now. “I would say not.”A faint rustle in the corridor drew Anderson’s attention. Startled, he pointedhis flashlight down the black passageway. The dying beam revealed only adeserted corridor, lined with open doors.“Hello?” Anderson said. “Is somebody there?”Silence.Sato gave him an odd look, apparently having heard nothing.Anderson listened a moment longer and then shook it off. I’ve got to get out ofhere.Alone in the candlelit chamber, Langdon ran his fingers over the sharply carvededges of the pyramid’s engraving. He was curious to know what the message said,and yet he was not about to intrude on Peter Solomon’s privacy any more thanthey already had. And why would this lunatic care about this small pyramidanyway?“We have a problem, Professor,” Sato’s voice declared loudly behind him. “I’vejust received a new piece of information, and I’ve had enough of your lies.”Langdon turned to see the OS director marching in, BlackBerry in hand and firein her eyes. Taken aback, Langdon looked to Anderson for help, but the chief wasnow standing guard at the door, his expression unsympathetic. Sato arrived infront of Langdon and thrust her BlackBerry in his face.Bewildered, Langdon looked at the screen, which displayed an invertedblack-and-white photograph, like a ghostly film negative. The photo looked likea jumble of objects, and one of them shone very brightly. Though askew and offcenter, the brightest object was clearly a little, pointed pyramid.A tiny pyramid? Langdon looked at Sato. “What is this?”The question seemed only to incense Sato further. “You’re pretending you don’tknow?”Langdon’s temper flared. “I’m not pretending anything! I’ve never seen thisbefore in my life!”“Bullshit!” Sato snapped, her voice cutting through the musty air. “You’ve beencarrying it in your bag all night!”“I—” Langdon stalled midsentence. His eyes moved slowly down to the daybag onhis shoulder. Then he raised them again to the BlackBerry. My God . . . thepackage. He looked more closely at the image. Now he saw it. A ghostly cube,enclosing the pyramid. Stunned, Langdon realized he was looking at an X-ray ofhis bag . . . and also of Peter’s mysterious cube-shaped package. The cube was,in fact, a hollow box . . . a small pyramid.Langdon opened his mouth to speak, but his words failed him. He felt the breathgo out of his lungs as a new revelation struck him.Simple. Pure. Devastating.My God. He looked back at the truncated stone pyramid on the desk. Its apex wasflat—a small square area—a blank space symbolically awaiting its final piece . .. that piece which would transform it from an Unfinished Pyramid into a TruePyramid.Langdon now realized the tiny pyramid he was carrying was not a pyramid at all.It’s a capstone. At that instant, he knew why he alone could unlock themysteries of this pyramid.I hold the final piece.And it is indeed . . . a talisman.When Peter had told Langdon the package contained a talisman, Langdon hadlaughed. Now he realized his friend was right. This tiny capstone was atalisman, but not the magic kind . . . the far older kind. Long before talismanhad magical connotations, it had another meaning—“completion.” From the Greektelesma, meaning “complete,” a talisman was any object or idea that completedanother and made it whole. The finishing element. A capstone, symbolicallyspeaking, was the ultimate talisman, transforming the Unfinished Pyramid into asymbol of completed perfection.Langdon now felt an eerie convergence that forced him to accept one very strangetruth: with the exception of its size, the stone pyramid in Peter’s Chamber ofReflection seemed to be transforming itself, bit by bit, into something vaguelyresembling the Masonic Pyramid of legend.From the brightness with which the capstone shone on the X-ray, Langdonsuspected it was made of metal . . . a very dense metal. Whether or not it wassolid gold, he had no way of knowing, and he was not about to let his mind startplaying tricks on him. This pyramid is too small. The code’s too easy to read.And . . . it’s a myth, for heaven’s sake!Sato was watching him. “For a bright man, Professor, you’ve made some dumbchoices tonight. Lying to an intelligence director? Intentionally obstructing aCIA investigation?”“I can explain, if you’ll let me.”“You will be explaining at CIA headquarters. As of this moment, I am detainingyou.”Langdon’s body went rigid. “You can’t possibly be serious.”“Deadly serious. I made it very clear to you that the stakes tonight were high,and you chose not to cooperate. I strongly suggest you start thinking aboutexplaining the inscription on this pyramid, because when we arrive at the CIA .. .” She raised her BlackBerry and took a close-up snapshot of the engraving onthe stone pyramid. “My analysts will have had a head start.”Langdon opened his mouth to protest, but Sato was already turning to Anderson atthe door. “Chief,” she said, “put the stone pyramid in Langdon’s bag and carryit. I’ll handle taking Mr. Langdon into custody. Your weapon, if I may?”Anderson was stone-faced as he advanced into the chamber, unsnapping hisshoulder holster as he came. He gave his gun to Sato, who immediately aimed itat Langdon.Langdon watched as if in a dream. This cannot be happening.Anderson now came to Langdon and removed the daybag from his shoulder, carryingit over to the desk and setting it on the chair. He unzipped the bag, propped itopen, and then hoisted the heavy stone pyramid off the desk and into the bag,along with Langdon’s notes and the tiny package.Suddenly there was a rustle of movement in the hallway. A dark outline of a manmaterialized in the doorway, rushing into the chamber and approaching fastbehind Anderson. The chief never saw him coming. In an instant, the stranger hadlowered his shoulder and crashed into Anderson’s back. The chief launchedforward, his head cracking into the edge of the stone niche. He fell hard,crumpling on the desk, sending bones and artifacts flying. The hourglassshattered on the floor. The candle toppled to the floor, still burning.Sato reeled amid the chaos, raising the gun, but the intruder grabbed a femurand lashed out with it, striking her shoulder with the leg bone. Sato let out acry of pain and fell back, dropping the weapon. The newcomer kicked the gun awayand then wheeled toward Langdon. The man was tall and slender, an elegantAfrican American whom Langdon had never seen before in his life.“Grab the pyramid!” the man commanded. “Follow me!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 42The African American man leading Langdon through the Capitol’s subterranean mazewas clearly someone of power. Beyond knowing his way through all the sidecorridors and back rooms, the elegant stranger carried a key ring that seemed tounlock every door that blocked their way.Langdon followed, quickly running up an unfamiliar staircase. As they climbed,he felt the leather strap of his daybag cutting hard into his shoulder. Thestone pyramid was so heavy that Langdon feared the bag’s strap might break.The past few minutes defied all logic, and now Langdon found himself moving oninstinct alone. His gut told him to trust this stranger. Beyond saving Langdonfrom Sato’s arrest, the man had taken dangerous action to protect PeterSolomon’s mysterious pyramid. Whatever the pyramid may be. While his motivationremained a mystery, Langdon had glimpsed a telltale shimmer of gold on the man’shand—a Masonic ring—the double-headed phoenix and the number 33. This man andPeter Solomon were more than trusted friends. They were Masonic brothers of thehighest degree.Langdon followed him to the top of the stairs, into another corridor, and thenthrough an unmarked door into a utilitarian hallway. They ran past supply boxesand bags of garbage, veering off suddenly through a service door that depositedthem in an utterly unexpected world—a plush movie theater of some sort. Theolder man led the way up the side aisle and out the main doors into the light ofa large atrium. Langdon now realized they were in the visitor center throughwhich he had entered earlier tonight.Unfortunately, so was a Capitol police officer.As they came face-to-face with the officer, all three men stopped, staring atone another. Langdon recognized the young Hispanic officer from the X-raymachine earlier tonight.“Officer Nuñez,” the African American man said. “Not a word. Follow me.”The guard looked uneasy but obeyed without question.Who is this guy?The three of them hurried toward the southeast corner of the visitor center,where they arrived at a small foyer and a set of heavy doors blocked with orangepylons. The doors were sealed with masking tape, apparently to keep the dust ofwhatever was happening beyond out of the visitor center. The man reached up andpeeled off the tape on the door. Then he flipped through his key ring as hespoke to the guard. “Our friend Chief Anderson is in the subbasement. He may beinjured. You’ll want to check on him.”“Yes, sir.” Nuñez looked as baffled as he did alarmed.“Most important, you did not see us.” The man found a key, took it off the keyring, and used it to turn the heavy dead bolt. He pulled open the steel door andtossed the key to the guard. “Lock this door behind us. Put the tape back on asbest as you can. Pocket the key and say nothing. To anyone. Including the chief.Is that clear, Officer Nuñez?”The guard eyed the key as if he’d just been entrusted with a precious gem. “Itis, sir.”The man hurried through the door, and Langdon followed. The guard locked theheavy bolt behind them, and Langdon could hear him re-applying the masking tape.“Professor Langdon,” the man said as they strode briskly down a modern-lookingcorridor that was obviously under construction. “My name is Warren Bellamy.Peter Solomon is a dear friend of mine.”Langdon shot a startled glance at the stately man. You’re Warren Bellamy?Langdon had never met the Architect of the Capitol, but he certainly knew theman’s name.“Peter speaks very highly of you,” Bellamy said, “and I’m sorry we are meetingunder these dreadful circumstances.”“Peter is in terrible trouble. His hand . . .”“I know.” Bellamy sounded grim. “That’s not the half of it, I’m afraid.”They reached the end of the lit section of corridor, and the passageway took anabrupt left. The remaining length of corridor, wherever it went, waspitch-black.“Hold on,” Bellamy said, disappearing into a nearby electrical room from which atangle of heavy-duty orange extension cords snaked out, running away from theminto the darkness of the corridor. Langdon waited while Bellamy rooted aroundinside. The Architect must have located the switch that sent power to theextension cords, because suddenly the route before them became illuminated.Langdon could only stare.Washington, D.C.—like Rome—was a city laced with secret passageways andunderground tunnels. The passage before them now reminded Langdon of thepassetto tunnel connecting the Vatican to Castel Sant’Angelo. Long. Dark.Narrow. Unlike the ancient passetto, however, this passage was modern and notyet complete. It was a slender construction zone that was so long it seemed tonarrow to nothing at its distant end. The only lighting was a string ofintermittent construction bulbs that did little more than accentuate thetunnel’s impossible length.Bellamy was already heading down the passage. “Follow me. Watch your step.”Langdon felt himself fall into step behind Bellamy, wondering where on earththis tunnel led.At that moment, Mal’akh stepped out of Pod 3 and strode briskly down thedeserted main corridor of the SMSC toward Pod 5. He clutched Trish’s key card inhis hand and quietly whispered, “Zero-eight-zero-four.”Something else was cycling through his mind as well. Mal’akh had just receivedan urgent message from the Capitol Building. My contact has run into unforeseendifficulties. Even so, the news remained encouraging: Robert Langdon nowpossessed both the pyramid and the capstone. Despite the unexpected way in whichit had happened, the crucial pieces were falling into place. It was almost as ifdestiny itself were guiding tonight’s events, ensuring Mal’akh’s victory."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 43Langdon hurried to keep pace with Warren Bellamy’s brisk footsteps as they movedwithout a word down the long tunnel. So far, the Architect of the Capitolappeared far more intent on putting distance between Sato and this stone pyramidthan he did on explaining to Langdon what was going on. Langdon had a growingapprehension that there was far more going on than he could imagine.The CIA? The Architect of the Capitol? Two Thirty-third-degree Masons?The shrill sound of Langdon’s cell phone cut the air. He pulled his phone fromhis jacket. Uncertain, he answered. “Hello?” The voice that spoke was an eerie,familiar whisper. “Professor, I hear you had unexpected company.”Langdon felt an icy chill. “Where the hell is Peter?!” he demanded, his wordsreverberating in the enclosed tunnel. Beside him, Warren Bellamy glanced over,looking concerned and motioning for Langdon to keep walking.“Don’t worry,” the voice said. “As I told you, Peter is somewhere safe.”“You cut off his hand, for God’s sake! He needs a doctor!”“He needs a priest,” the man replied. “But you can save him. If you do as Icommand, Peter will live. I give you my word.”“The word of a madman means nothing to me.”“Madman? Professor, surely you appreciate the reverence with which I haveadhered to the ancient protocols tonight. The Hand of the Mysteries guided youto a portal—the pyramid that promises to unveil ancient wisdom. I know you nowpossess it.”“You think this is the Masonic Pyramid?” Langdon demanded. “It’s a chunk ofrock.”There was silence on the other end of the line. “Mr. Langdon, you’re too smartto play dumb. You know very well what you’ve uncovered tonight. A stone pyramid. . . hidden at the core of Washington, D.C. . . . by a powerful Mason?”“You’re chasing a myth! Whatever Peter told you, he told you in fear.The Legend of the Masonic Pyramid is fiction. The Masons never built any pyramidto protect secret wisdom. And even if they did, this pyramid is far too small tobe what you think it is.”The man chuckled. “I see Peter has told you very little. Nonetheless, Mr.Langdon, whether or not you choose to accept what it is you now possess, youwill do as I say. I am well aware that the pyramid you are carrying has anencrypted engraving. You will decipher that engraving for me. Then, and onlythen, will I return Peter Solomon to you.”“Whatever you believe this engraving reveals,” Langdon said, “it won’t be theAncient Mysteries.”“Of course not,” he replied. “The mysteries are far too vast to be written onthe side of a little stone pyramid.”The response caught Langdon off guard. “But if this engraving is not the AncientMysteries, then this pyramid is not the Masonic Pyramid. Legend clearly statesthe Masonic Pyramid was constructed to protect the Ancient Mysteries.”The man’s tone was condescending now. “Mr. Langdon, the Masonic Pyramid wasconstructed to preserve the Ancient Mysteries, but with a twist you’veapparently not yet grasped. Did Peter never tell you? The power of the MasonicPyramid is not that it reveals the mysteries themselves . . . but rather that itreveals the secret location where the mysteries are buried.”Langdon did a double take.“Decipher the engraving,” the voice continued, “and it will tell you the hidingplace of mankind’s greatest treasure.” He laughed. “Peter did not entrust youwith the treasure itself, Professor.”Langdon came to an abrupt halt in the tunnel. “Hold on. You’re saying thispyramid is . . . a map?” Bellamy jolted to a stop now, too, his expression one of shock and alarm.Clearly, the caller had just hit a raw nerve. The pyramid is a map.“This map,” the voice whispered, “or pyramid, or portal, or whatever you chooseto call it . . . was created long ago to ensure the hiding place of the AncientMysteries would never be forgotten . . . that it would never be lost tohistory.”“A grid of sixteen symbols doesn’t look much like a map.”“Appearances can be deceiving, Professor. But regardless, you alone have thepower to read that inscription.”“You’re wrong,” Langdon fired back, picturing the simplistic cipher. “Anyonecould decipher this engraving. It’s not very sophisticated.”“I suspect there is more to the pyramid than meets the eye. Regardless, youalone possess the capstone.”Langdon pictured the little capstone in his bag. Order from chaos? He didn’tknow what to believe anymore, but the stone pyramid in his bag seemed to begetting heavier with every passing moment.Mal’akh pressed the cell phone to his ear, enjoying the sound of Langdon’sanxious breathing on the other end. “Right now, I have business to attend to,Professor, and so do you. Call me as soon as you have deciphered the map. Wewill go together to the hiding place and make our trade. Peter’s life . . . forall the wisdom of the ages.”“I will do nothing,” Langdon declared. “Especially not without proof Peter isalive.”“I suggest you not test me. You are a very small cog in a vast machine. If youdisobey me, or attempt to find me, Peter will die. This I swear.”“For all I know, Peter is already dead.”“He is very much alive, Professor, but he desperately needs your help.”“What are you really looking for?” Langdon shouted into the phone.Mal’akh paused before answering. “Many people have pursued the Ancient Mysteriesand debated their power. Tonight, I will prove the mysteries are real.”Langdon was silent.“I suggest you get to work on the map immediately,” Mal’akh said. “I need thisinformation today.”“Today?! It’s already after nine o’clock!”“Exactly. Tempus fugit.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 44New York editor Jonas Faukman was just turning off the lights in his Manhattanoffice when his phone rang. He had no intention of picking up at this hour—thatis, until he glimpsed the caller-ID display. This ought to be good, he thought,reaching for the receiver.“Do we still publish you?” Faukman asked, half serious.“Jonas!” Robert Langdon’s voice sounded anxious. “Thank God you’re there. I needyour help.”Faukman’s spirits lifted. “You’ve got pages for me to edit, Robert?” Finally?“No, I need information. Last year, I connected you with a scientist namedKatherine Solomon, the sister of Peter Solomon?”Faukman frowned. No pages.“She was looking for a publisher for a book on Noetic Science? Do you rememberher?”Faukman rolled his eyes. “Sure. I remember. And thanks a million for thatintroduction. Not only did she refuse to let me read the results of herresearch, she didn’t want to publish anything until some magical date in thefuture.”“Jonas, listen to me, I don’t have time. I need Katherine’s phone number. Rightnow. Do you have it?”“I’ve got to warn you . . . you’re acting a little desperate. She’s greatlooking, but you’re not going to impress her by—”“This is no joke, Jonas, I need her number now.”“All right . . . hold on.” Faukman and Langdon had been close friends for enoughyears that Faukman knew when Langdon was serious. Jonas typed the name KatherineSolomon into a search window and began scanning the company’s e-mail server.“I’m looking now,” Faukman said. “And for what it’s worth, when you call her,you may not want to call from the Harvard Pool. It sounds like you’re in anasylum.”“I’m not at the pool. I’m in a tunnel under the U.S. Capitol.”Faukman sensed from Langdon’s voice that he was not joking. What is it with thisguy? “Robert, why can’t you just stay home and write?” His computer pinged.“Okay, hold on . . . I got it.” He moused through the old e-mail thread. “Itlooks like all I have is her cell.”“I’ll take it.”Faukman gave him the number.“Thanks, Jonas,” Langdon said, sounding grateful. “I owe you one.”“You owe me a manuscript, Robert. Do you have any idea how long—”The line went dead.Faukman stared at the receiver and shook his head. Book publishing would be somuch easier without the authors."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 45Katherine Solomon did a double take when she saw the name on her caller ID. Shehad imagined the incoming call was from Trish, checking in to explain why sheand Christopher Abaddon were taking so long. But the caller was not Trish.Far from it.Katherine felt a blushing smile cross her lips. Could tonight get any stranger?She flipped open her phone.“Don’t tell me,” she said playfully. “Bookish bachelor seeking single NoeticScientist?”“Katherine!” The deep voice belonged to Robert Langdon. “Thank God you’re okay.”“Of course I’m okay,” she replied, puzzled. “Other than the fact that you nevercalled me after that party at Peter’s house last summer.”“Something has happened tonight. Please listen.” His normally smooth voicesounded ragged. “I’m so sorry to have to tell you this . . . but Peter is inserious trouble.”Katherine’s smile disappeared. “What are you talking about?”“Peter . . .” Langdon hesitated as if searching for words. “I don’t know how tosay it, but he’s been . . . taken. I’m not sure how or by whom, but—”“Taken?” Katherine demanded. “Robert, you’re scaring me. Taken . . . where?”“Taken captive.” Langdon’s voice cracked as if he were overwhelmed. “It musthave happened earlier today or maybe yesterday.”“This isn’t funny,” she said angrily. “My brother is fine. I just spoke to himfifteen minutes ago!”“You did?!” Langdon sounded stunned.“Yes! He just texted me to say he was coming to the lab.”“He texted you . . .” Langdon thought out loud. “But you didn’t actually hearhis voice?”“No, but—”“Listen to me. The text you received was not from your brother. Someone hasPeter’s phone. He’s dangerous. Whoever it is tricked me into coming toWashington tonight.”“Tricked you? You’re not making any sense!”“I know, I’m so sorry.” Langdon seemed uncharacteristically disorientated.“Katherine, I think you could be in danger.”Katherine Solomon was sure that Langdon would never joke about something likethis, and yet he sounded like he had lost his mind. “I’m fine,” she said. “I’mlocked inside a secure building!”“Read me the message you got from Peter’s phone. Please.”Bewildered, Katherine pulled up the text message and read it to Langdon, feelinga chill as she came to the final part referencing Dr. Abaddon. “‘If available,have Dr. Abaddon join us inside. I trust him fully . . .’ ”“Oh God . . .” Langdon’s voice was laced with fear. “Did you invite this maninside?”“Yes! My assistant just went out to the lobby to get him. I expect them backany—”“Katherine, get out!” Langdon yelled. “Now!”At the other side of the SMSC, inside the security room, a phone began ringing,drowning out the Redskins game. The guard reluctantly pulled out his earbuds onemore time.“Lobby,” he answered. “This is Kyle.”“Kyle, it’s Katherine Solomon!” Her voice sounded anxious, out of breath.“Ma’am, your brother has not yet—”“Where’s Trish?!” she demanded. “Can you see her on the monitors?”The guard rolled his chair over to look at the screens. “She hasn’t gotten backto the Cube yet?”“No!” Katherine shouted, sounding alarmed.The guard now realized that Katherine Solomon was out of breath, as if she wererunning. What’s going on back there?The guard quickly worked the video joystick, skimming through frames of digitalvideo at rapid speed. “Okay, hold on, scrolling through playback . . . I’ve gotTrish with your guest leaving the lobby . . . they move down the Street . . .fast-forwarding . . . okay, they’re going into Wet Pod . . . Trish uses her keycard to unlock the door . . . both of them step into Wet Pod . . .fast-forwarding . . . okay, here they are coming out of Wet Pod just a minuteago . . . heading down . . .” He cocked his head, slowing the playback. “Wait aminute. That’s odd.”“What?”“The gentleman came out of Wet Pod alone.”“Trish stayed inside?”“Yes, it looks that way. I’m watching your guest now . . . he’s in the hall onhis own.”“Where is Trish?” Katherine asked more frantically.“I don’t see her on the video feed,” he replied, an edge of anxiety creepinginto his voice. He looked back at the screen and noticed that the man’s jacketsleeves appeared to be wet . . . all the way up to his elbows. What in the worlddid he do in Wet Pod? The guard watched as the man began to move purposefullydown the main hallway toward Pod 5, clutching in his hand what looked like . . .a key card.The guard felt the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. “Ms. Solomon,we’ve got a serious problem.”Tonight was a night of firsts for Katherine Solomon.In two years, she had never used her cell phone inside the void. Nor had sheever crossed the void at a dead run. At the moment, however, Katherine had acell phone pressed to her ear while she was dashing blindly along the endlesslength of carpet. Each time she felt a foot stray from the carpet, she correctedback to center, racing on through the sheer darkness.“Where is he now?” Katherine asked the guard, breathless.“Checking now,” the guard replied. “Fast-forwarding . . . okay, here he iswalking down the hall . . . moving toward Pod Five . . .”Katherine ran harder, hoping to reach the exit before she got trapped back here.“How long until he gets to the Pod Five entrance?”The guard paused. “Ma’am, you don’t understand. I’m still fast-forwarding. Thisis recorded playback. This already happened.” He paused. “Hold on, let me checkthe entry event monitor.” He paused and then said, “Ma’am, Ms. Dunne’s key cardshows a Pod Five entry event about a minute ago.”Katherine slammed on the brakes, sliding to a halt in the middle of the abyss.“He already unlocked Pod Five?” she whispered into the phone.The guard was typing frantically. “Yes, it looks like he entered . . . ninetyseconds ago.”Katherine’s body went rigid. She stopped breathing. The darkness felt suddenlyalive all around her.He’s in here with me.In an instant, Katherine realized that the only light in the entire space wascoming from her cell phone, illuminating the side of her face. “Send help,” shewhispered to the guard. “And get to Wet Pod to help Trish.” Then she quietlyclosed her phone, extinguishing the light.Absolute darkness settled around her.She stood stock-still and breathed as quietly as possible. After a few seconds,the pungent scent of ethanol wafted out of the darkness in front of her. Thesmell got stronger. She could sense a presence, only a few feet in front of heron the carpet. In the silence, the pounding of Katherine’s heart seemed loudenough to give her away. Silently, she stepped out of her shoes and inched toher left, sidestepping off the carpet. The cement felt cold under her feet. Shetook one more step to clear the carpet.One of her toes cracked.It sounded like a gunshot in the stillness.Only a few yards away, a rustle of clothing suddenly came at her out of thedarkness. Katherine bolted an instant too late and a powerful arm snagged her,groping in the darkness, hands violently attempting to gain purchase. She spunaway as a viselike grip caught her lab coat, yanking her backward, reeling herin.Katherine threw her arms backward, slithering out of her lab coat and slippingfree. Suddenly, with no idea anymore which way was out, Katherine Solomon foundherself dashing, dead blind, across an endless black abyss."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 46Despite containing what many have called “the most beautiful room in the world,”the Library of Congress is known less for its breathtaking splendor than for itsvast collections. With over five hundred miles of shelves—enough to stretch fromWashington, D.C., to Boston—it easily claims the title of largest library onearth. And yet still it expands, at a rate of over ten thousand items per day.As an early repository for Thomas Jefferson’s personal collection of books onscience and philosophy, the library stood as a symbol of America’s commitment tothe dissemination of knowledge. One of the first buildings in Washington to haveelectric lights, it literally shone like a beacon in the darkness of the NewWorld.As its name implies, the Library of Congress was established to serve Congress,whose venerated members worked across the street in the Capitol Building. Thisage-old bond between library and Capitol had been fortified recently by theconstruction of a physical connection—a long tunnel beneath Independence Avenuethat linked the two buildings.Tonight, inside this dimly lit tunnel, Robert Langdon followed Warren Bellamythrough a construction zone, trying to quell his own deepening concern forKatherine. This lunatic is at her lab?! Langdon didn’t even want to imagine why.When he had called to warn her, Langdon had told Katherine exactly where to meethim before they hung up. How much longer is this damned tunnel? His head achednow, a roiling torrent of interconnected thoughts: Katherine, Peter, the Masons,Bellamy, pyramids, ancient prophecy . . . and a map.Langdon shook it all off and pressed on. Bellamy promised me answers.When the two men finally reached the end of the passage, Bellamy guided Langdonthrough a set of double doors that were still under construction. Finding no wayto lock the unfinished doors behind them, Bellamy improvised, grabbing analuminum ladder from the construction supplies and leaning it precariouslyagainst the outside of the door. Then he balanced a metal bucket on top. Ifanyone opened the door, the bucket would crash loudly to the floor.That’s our alarm system? Langdon eyed the perched bucket, hoping Bellamy had amore comprehensive plan for their safety tonight. Everything had happened sofast, and Langdon was only now starting to process the repercussions of hisfleeing with Bellamy. I’m a fugitive from the CIA.Bellamy led the way around a corner, where the two men began ascending a widestaircase that was cordoned off with orange pylons. Langdon’s daybag weighed himdown as he climbed. “The stone pyramid,” he said, “I still don’t understand—”“Not here,” Bellamy interrupted. “We’ll examine it in the light. I know a safeplace.”Langdon doubted such a place existed for anyone who had just physicallyassaulted the director of the CIA’s Office of Security.As the two men reached the top of the stairs, they entered a wide hallway ofItalian marble, stucco, and gold leaf. The hall was lined with eight pairs ofstatues—all depicting the goddess Minerva. Bellamy pressed on, leading Langdoneastward, through a vaulted archway, into a far grander space.Even in the dim, after-hours lighting, the library’s great hall shone with theclassical grandeur of an opulent European palace. Seventy-five feet overhead,stained-glass skylights glistened between paneled beams adorned with rare“aluminum leaf”—a metal that was considered to be more precious than gold at onetime. Beneath that, a stately course of paired pillars lined the second-floorbalcony, accessible by two magnificent curling staircases whose newel postssupported giant bronze female figures raising torches of enlightenment.In a bizarre attempt to reflect this theme of modern enlightenment and yet staywithin the decorative register of Renaissance architecture, the stairwaybanisters had been carved with cupidlike putti portrayed as modern scientists.An angelic electrician holding a telephone? A cherubic entomologist with aspecimen box? Langdon wondered what Bernini would have thought.“We’ll talk over here,” Bellamy said, leading Langdon past the bulletproofdisplay cases that contained the library’s two most valuable books—the GiantBible of Mainz, handwritten in the 1450s, and America’s copy of the GutenbergBible, one of only three perfect vellum copies in the world. Fittingly, thevaulted ceiling overhead bore John White Alexander’s six-panel painting titledThe Evolution of the Book.Bellamy strode directly to a pair of elegant double doors at the center rear ofthe east-corridor wall. Langdon knew what room lay beyond those doors, but itseemed a strange choice for a conversation. Notwithstanding the irony of talkingin a space filled with “Silence Please” signs, this room hardly seemed like a“safe place.” Located dead center of the library’s cruciform-shaped floor plan,this chamber served as the heart of the building. Hiding in here was likebreaking into a cathedral and hiding on the altar.Nonetheless, Bellamy unlocked the doors, stepped into the darkness beyond, andgroped for the lights. When he flipped the switch, one of America’s greatarchitectural masterpieces seemed to materialize out of thin air.The famous reading room was a feast for the senses. A voluminous octagon rose160 feet at its center, its eight sides finished in chocolate-brown Tennesseemarble, cream-colored Siena marble, and apple-red Algerian marble. Because itwas lit from eight angles, no shadows fell anywhere, creating the effect thatthe room itself was glowing.“Some say it’s the most striking room in Washington,” Bellamy said, usheringLangdon inside.Maybe in the whole world, Langdon thought as he stepped across the threshold. Asalways, his gaze first ascended straight up to the towering central collar,where rays of arabesque coffers curled down the dome to an upper balcony.Encircling the room, sixteen bronze “portrait” statues peered down from thebalustrade. Beneath them, a stunning arcade of archways formed a lower balcony.Down at floor level, three concentric circles of burnished wood desks radiatedout from the massive octagonal circulation desk.Langdon returned his focus to Bellamy, who was now propping the room’s doubledoors wide open. “I thought we were hiding,” Langdon said, confused.“If anyone enters the building,” Bellamy said, “I want to hear them coming.”“But won’t they find us instantly in here?”“No matter where we hide, they’ll find us. But if anyone corners us in thisbuilding, you’ll be very glad I chose this room.”Langdon had no idea why, but Bellamy apparently wasn’t looking to discuss it. Hewas already on the move toward the center of the room, where he selected one ofthe available reading desks, pulled up two chairs, and flipped on the readinglight. Then he motioned to Langdon’s bag.“Okay, Professor, let’s have a closer look.”Not wanting to risk scratching its polished surface with a rough piece ofgranite, Langdon hoisted his entire bag onto the desk and unzipped it, foldingthe sides all the way down to reveal the pyramid inside. Warren Bellamy adjustedthe reading lamp and studied the pyramid carefully. He ran his fingers over theunusual engraving.“I assume you recognize this language?” Bellamy asked.“Of course,” Langdon replied, eyeing the sixteen symbols.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_010_r1.jpg]Known as the Freemason’s Cipher, this encoded language had been used for privatecommunication among early Masonic brothers. The encryption method had beenabandoned long ago for one simple reason—it was much too easy to break. Most ofthe students in Langdon’s senior symbology seminar could break this code inabout five minutes. Langdon, with a pencil and paper, could do it in under sixtyseconds.The notorious breakability of this centuries-old encryption scheme now presenteda couple of paradoxes. First, the claim that Langdon was the only person onearth who could break it was absurd. Second, for Sato to suggest that a Masoniccipher was an issue of national security was like her suggesting our nuclearlaunch codes were encrypted with a Cracker Jack decoder ring. Langdon was stillstruggling to believe any of it. This pyramid is a map? Pointing to the lostwisdom of the ages?“Robert,” Bellamy said, his tone grave. “Did Director Sato tell you why she isso interested in this?”Langdon shook his head. “Not specifically. She just kept saying it was an issueof national security. I assume she’s lying.”“Perhaps,” Bellamy said, rubbing the back of his neck. He seemed to bestruggling with something. “But there is a far more troubling possibility.” Heturned to look Langdon in the eye. “It’s possible that Director Sato hasdiscovered this pyramid’s true potential.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 47The blackness engulfing Katherine Solomon felt absolute.Having fled the familiar safety of the carpet, she was now groping blindlyforward, her outstretched hands touching only empty space as she staggereddeeper into the desolate void. Beneath her stockinged feet, the endless expanseof cold cement felt like a frozen lake . . . a hostile environment from whichshe now needed to escape.No longer smelling ethanol, she stopped and waited in darkness. Standing deadstill, she listened, willing her heart to stop pounding so loudly. The heavyfootsteps behind her seemed to have stopped. Did I lose him? Katherine closedher eyes and tried to imagine where she was. Which direction did I run? Where isthe door? It was no use. She was so turned around now that the exit could beanywhere.Fear, Katherine had once heard, acted as a stimulant, sharpening the mind’sability to think. Right now, however, her fear had turned her mind into atumbling torrent of panic and confusion. Even if I find the exit, I can’t getout. Her key card had been lost when she’d shed her lab coat. Her only hopeseemed to be that she was now a needle in a haystack—a single point on athirty-thousand-square-foot grid. Despite the overwhelming urge to flee,Katherine’s analytical mind told her instead to make the only logical move—nomove at all. Stay still. Don’t make a sound. The security guard was on his way,and for some unknown reason, her attacker smelled strongly of ethanol. If hegets too close, I’ll know it.As Katherine stood in silence, her mind raced over what Langdon had said. Yourbrother . . . he’s been taken. She felt a bead of cold sweat materialize on herarm and trickle down, toward the cell phone still clenched in her right hand. Itwas a danger she had forgotten to consider. If the phone rang, it would giveaway her position, and she could not turn it off without opening it andilluminating the display.Set down the phone . . . and move away from it.But it was too late. The smell of ethanol approached on her right. And now itgrew stronger. Katherine struggled to stay calm, forcing herself to override theinstinct to run. Carefully, slowly, she took one step to her left. The faintrustle of her clothing was apparently all her attacker needed. She heard himlunge, and the smell of ethanol washed over her as a powerful hand grabbed ather shoulder. She twisted away, raw terror gripping her. Mathematicalprobability went out the window, and Katherine broke into a blind sprint. Sheveered hard to the left, changing course, dashing blindly now into the void.The wall materialized out of nowhere.Katherine hit it hard, knocking the wind from her lungs. Pain blossomed in herarm and shoulder, but she managed to stay on her feet. The oblique angle atwhich she had collided with the wall had spared her the full force of the blow,but it was little comfort now. The sound had echoed everywhere. He knows where Iam. Doubled over in pain, she turned her head and stared out into the blacknessof the pod and sensed him staring back at her.Change your location. Now!Still struggling to catch her breath, she began moving down the wall, touchingher left hand quietly to each exposed steel stud as she passed. Stay along thewall. Slip past him before he corners you. In her right hand, Katherine stillclutched her cell phone, ready to hurl it as a projectile if need be.Katherine was in no way prepared for the sound she heard next—the clear rustleof clothing directly in front of her . . . against the wall. She froze,stock-still, and stopped breathing. How could he be on the wall already? Shefelt a faint puff of air, laced with the stench of ethanol. He’s moving down thewall toward me!Katherine backed up several steps. Then, turning silently 180 degrees, she beganmoving quickly in the opposite direction down the wall. She moved twenty feet orso when the impossible happened. Once again, directly in front of her, along thewall, she heard the rustling sound of clothing. Then came the same puff of airand the smell of ethanol. Katherine Solomon froze in place.My God, he’s everywhere!Bare-chested, Mal’akh stared into the darkness.The smell of ethanol on his sleeves had proven a liability, and so he hadtransformed it into an asset, stripping off his shirt and jacket and using themto help corner his prey. Throwing his jacket against the wall to the right, hehad heard Katherine stop short and change direction. Now, having thrown hisshirt ahead to the left, Mal’akh had heard her stop again. He had effectivelycorralled Katherine against the wall by establishing points beyond which shedared not pass.Now he waited, ears straining in the silence. She has only one direction she canmove—directly toward me. Even so, Mal’akh heard nothing. Either Katherine wasparalyzed with fear, or she had decided to stand still and wait for help toenter Pod 5. Either way she loses. Nobody would be entering Pod 5 anytime soon;Mal’akh had disabled the outer keypad with a very crude, yet very effective,technique. After using Trish’s key card, he had rammed a single dime deep intothe key-card slot to prevent any other key-card use without first dismantlingthe entire mechanism.You and I are alone, Katherine . . . for as long as this takes.Mal’akh inched silently forward, listening for any movement. Katherine Solomonwould die tonight in the darkness of her brother’s museum. A poetic end. Mal’akhlooked forward to sharing the news of Katherine’s death with her brother. Theold man’s anguish would be long-awaited revenge.Suddenly in the darkness, to Mal’akh’s great surprise, he saw a tiny glow in thedistance and realized Katherine had just made a deadly error in judgment. She’sphoning for help?! The electronic display that had just flickered to life washovering waist high, about twenty yards ahead, like a shining beacon on a vastocean of black. Mal’akh had been prepared to wait Katherine out, but now hewouldn’t have to.Mal’akh sprang into motion, racing toward the hovering light, knowing he had toreach her before she could complete her call for help. He was there in a matterof seconds, and he lunged, arms outstretched on either side of her glowing cellphone, preparing to engulf her.Mal’akh’s fingers jammed into a solid wall, bending backward and almostbreaking. His head collided next, crashing into a steel beam. He cried out inpain as he crumpled beside the wall. Cursing, he clambered back to his feet,pulling himself up by the waist-high, horizontal strut on which KatherineSolomon had cleverly placed her open cell phone.Katherine was running again, this time with no concern for the noise her handwas making as it bounced rhythmically off the evenly spaced metal studs of Pod5. Run! If she followed the wall all the way around the pod, she knew thatsooner or later she would feel the exit door.Where the hell is the guard?The even spacing of the studs continued as she ran with her left hand on thesidewall and her right out in front of her for protection. When will I reach thecorner? The sidewall seemed to go on and on, but suddenly the rhythm of thestuds was broken. Her left hand hit empty space for several long strides, andthen the studs began again. Katherine slammed on the brakes and backed up,feeling her way across the smooth metal panel. Why are there no studs here?She could hear her attacker lumbering loudly after her now, groping his way downthe wall in her direction. Even so, it was a different sound that scaredKatherine even more—the distant rhythmic banging of a security guard poundinghis flashlight against the Pod 5 door.The guard can’t get in?While the thought was terrifying, the location of his banging—diagonally to herright—instantly oriented Katherine. She could now picture where in Pod 5 she waslocated. The visual flash brought with it an unexpected realization. She nowknew what this flat panel on the wall was.Every pod was equipped with a specimen bay—a giant movable wall that could beretracted for transporting oversize specimens in and out of the pods. Like thoseof an airplane hangar, this door was mammoth, and Katherine in her wildestdreams had never imagined needing to open it. At the moment, though, it seemedlike her only hope.Is it even operable?Katherine fumbled blindly in the blackness, searching the bay door until shefound the large metal handle. Grasping it, she threw her weight backward, tryingto slide open the door. Nothing. She tried again. It didn’t budge.She could hear her attacker closing faster now, homing in on the sounds of herefforts. The bay door is locked! Wild with panic, she slid her hands all overthe door, feeling the surface for any latch or lever. She suddenly hit what feltlike a vertical pole. She followed it down to the floor, crouching, and couldfeel it was inserted into a hole in the cement. A security rod! She stood up,grabbed the pole, and, lifting with her legs, slid the rod up and out of thehole.He’s almost here!Katherine groped now for the handle, found it again, and heaved back on it withall her might. The massive panel seemed barely to move, and yet a sliver ofmoonlight now sliced into Pod 5. Katherine pulled again. The shaft of light fromoutside the building grew wider. A little more! She pulled one last time,sensing her attacker was now only a few feet away.Leaping toward the light, Katherine wriggled her slender body sideways into theopening. A hand materialized in the darkness, clawing at her, trying to pull herback inside. She heaved herself through the opening, pursued by a massive barearm that was covered with tattooed scales. The terrifying arm writhed like anangry snake trying to seize her.Katherine spun and fled down the long, pale outer wall of Pod 5. The bed ofloose stones that surrounded the entire perimeter of the SMSC cut into herstockinged feet as she ran, but she pressed on, heading for the main entrance.The night was dark, but with her eyes fully dilated from the utter blackness ofPod 5, she could see perfectly—almost as if it were daylight. Behind her, theheavy bay door ground open, and she heard heavy footsteps accelerating inpursuit down the side of the building. The footsteps seemed impossibly fast.I’ll never outrun him to the main entrance. She knew her Volvo was closer, buteven that would be too far. I’m not going to make it.Then Katherine realized she had one final card to play.As she neared the corner of Pod 5, she could hear his footsteps quicklyovertaking her in the darkness. Now or never. Instead of rounding the corner,Katherine suddenly cut hard to her left, away from the building, out onto thegrass. As she did so, she closed her eyes tightly, placed both hands over herface, and began running totally blind across the lawn.The motion-activated security lighting that blazed to life around Pod 5transformed night into day instantly. Katherine heard a scream of pain behindher as the brilliant floodlights seared into her assailant’s hyper dilatedpupils with over twenty-five-million candlepower of light. She could hear himstumbling on the loose stones.Katherine kept her eyes tightly closed, trusting herself on the open lawn. Whenshe sensed she was far enough away from the building and the lights, she openedher eyes, corrected her course, and ran like hell through the dark.Her Volvo’s keys were exactly where she always left them, in the center console.Breathless, she seized the keys in her trembling hands and found the ignition.The engine roared to life, and her headlights flipped on, illuminating aterrifying sight.A hideous form raced toward her.Katherine froze for an instant.The creature caught in her headlights was a bald and bare-chested animal, itsskin covered with tattooed scales, symbols, and text. He bellowed as he ran intothe glare, raising his hands before his eyes like a cave-dwelling beast seeingsunlight for the first time. She reached for the gearshift but suddenly he wasthere, hurling his elbow through her side window, sending a shower of safetyglass into her lap.A massive scale-covered arm burst through her window, groping half blind,finding her neck. She threw the car in reverse, but her attacker had latched onto her throat, squeezing with unimaginable force. She turned her head in anattempt to escape his grasp, and suddenly she was staring at his face. Threedark stripes, like fingernail scratches, had torn through his face makeup toreveal the tattoos beneath. His eyes were wild and ruthless.“I should have killed you ten years ago,” he growled. “The night I killed yourmother.”As his words registered, Katherine was seized by a horrifying memory: that ferallook in his eyes—she had seen it before. It’s him. She would have screamed hadit not been for the viselike grip around her neck.She smashed her foot onto the accelerator, and the car lurched backward, almostsnapping her neck as he was dragged beside her car. The Volvo careened up aninclined median, and Katherine could feel her neck about to give way beneath hisweight. Suddenly tree branches were scraping the side of her car, slappingthrough the side windows, and the weight was gone.The car burst through the evergreens and out into the upper parking lot, whereKatherine slammed on the brakes. Below her, the half-naked man clambered to hisfeet, staring into her headlights. With a terrifying calm, he raised a menacingscale-covered arm and pointed directly at her.Katherine’s blood coursed with raw fear and hatred as she spun the wheel and hitthe gas. Seconds later, she was fishtailing out onto Silver Hill Road."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 48In the heat of the moment, Capitol police officer Nuñez had seen no option butto help the Capitol Architect and Robert Langdon escape.

Both of them were standing with the videosurveillance team, reviewing digital playback files in an attempt to locateLangdon and Bellamy.“Check the playback on every hallway and exit,” Sato demanded. “I want to knowwhere they went!”Nuñez felt ill as he looked on. He knew it would be only a matter of minutesbefore they found the right video clip and learned the truth. I helped themescape. Making matters worse was the arrival of a four-man CIA field team thatwas now staging nearby, prepping to go after Langdon and Bellamy. These guyslooked nothing like the Capitol Police. These guys were dead-serious soldiers .. . black camouflage, night vision, futuristic-looking handguns.Nuñez felt like he would throw up. Making up his mind, he motioned discreetly toChief Anderson. “A word, Chief?”“What is it?” Anderson followed Nuñez into the hall.“Chief, I made a bad mistake,” Nuñez said, breaking a sweat. “I’m sorry, and I’mresigning.” You’ll fire me in a few minutes anyway.“I beg your pardon?”Nuñez swallowed hard. “Earlier, I saw Langdon and Architect Bellamy in thevisitor center on their way out of the building.”“What?!” Anderson bellowed. “Why didn’t you say something?!”“The Architect told me not to say a word.”“You work for me, goddamm it!” Anderson’s voice echoed down the corridor.“Bellamy smashed my head into a wall, for Christ’s sake!”Nuñez handed Anderson the key that the Architect had given him.“What is this?” Anderson demanded.“A key to the new tunnel under Independence Avenue. Architect Bellamy had it.That’s how they escaped.”Anderson stared down at the key, speechless.Sato poked her head out into the hallway, eyes probing. “What’s going on outhere?”Nuñez felt himself go pale. Anderson was still holding the key, and Sato clearlyhad seen it. As the hideous little woman drew near, Nuñez improvised as best ashe could, hoping to protect his chief. “I found a key on the floor in thesubbasement. I was just asking Chief Anderson if he knew what it might go to.”Sato arrived, eyeing the key. “And does the chief know?”Nuñez glanced up at Anderson, who was clearly weighing all his options beforespeaking. Finally, the chief shook his head. “Not offhand. I’d have to checkthe—”“Don’t bother,” Sato said. “This key unlocks a tunnel off the visitor center.”“Really?” Anderson said. “How do you know that?”“We just found the surveillance clip. Officer Nuñez here helped Langdon andBellamy escape and then relocked that tunnel door behind them. Bellamy gaveNuñez that key.”Anderson turned to Nuñez with a flare of anger. “Is this true?!”Nuñez nodded vigorously, doing his best to play along. “I’m sorry, sir. TheArchitect told me not to tell a soul!”“I don’t give a damn what the Architect told you!” Anderson yelled. “I expect—”“Shut up, Trent,” Sato snapped. “You’re both lousy liars. Save it for your CIAinquisition.” She snatched the Architect’s tunnel key from Anderson. “You’redone here.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 49Robert Langdon hung up his cell phone, feeling increasingly worried. Katherine’snot answering her cell? Katherine had promised to call him as soon as she wassafely out of the lab and on her way to meet him here, but she had never doneso.Bellamy sat beside Langdon at the reading-room desk. He, too, had just made acall, his to an individual he claimed could offer them sanctuary—a safe place tohide. Unfortunately, this person was not answering either, and so Bellamy hadleft an urgent message, telling him to call Langdon’s cell phone right away.“I’ll keep trying,” he said to Langdon, “but for the moment, we’re on our own.And we need to discuss a plan for this pyramid.”The pyramid. For Langdon, the spectacular backdrop of the reading room had allbut disappeared, his world constricting now to include only what was directly infront of him—a stone pyramid, a sealed package containing a capstone, and anelegant African American man who had materialized out of the darkness andrescued him from the certainty of a CIA interrogation.Langdon had expected a modicum of sanity from the Architect of the Capitol, butnow it seemed Warren Bellamy was no more rational than the madman claiming Peterwas in purgatory. Bellamy was insisting this stone pyramid was, in fact, theMasonic Pyramid of legend. An ancient map? That guides us to powerful wisdom?“Mr. Bellamy,” Langdon said politely, “this idea that there exists some kind ofancient knowledge that can imbue men with great power . . . I simply can’t takeit seriously.”Bellamy’s eyes looked both disappointed and earnest, making Langdon’s skepticismall the more awkward. “Yes, Professor, I had imagined you might feel this way,but I suppose I should not be surprised. You are an outsider looking in. Thereexist certain Masonic realities that you will perceive as myth because you arenot properly initiated and prepared to understand them.”Now Langdon felt patronized. I wasn’t a member of Odysseus’s crew, but I’mcertain the Cyclops is a myth. “Mr. Bellamy, even if the legend is true . . .this pyramid cannot possibly be the Masonic Pyramid.”“No?” Bellamy ran a finger across the Masonic cipher on the stone. “It looks tome like it fits the description perfectly. A stone pyramid with a shining metalcapstone, which, according to Sato’s X-ray, is exactly what Peter entrusted toyou.” Bellamy picked up the little cube-shaped package, weighing it in his hand.“This stone pyramid is less than a foot tall,” Langdon countered. “Every versionof the story I’ve ever heard describes the Masonic Pyramid as enormous.”Bellamy had clearly anticipated this point. “As you know, the legend speaks of apyramid rising so high that God Himself can reach out and touch it.”“Exactly.”“I can see your dilemma, Professor. However, both the Ancient Mysteries andMasonic philosophy celebrate the potentiality of God within each of us.Symbolically speaking, one could claim that anything within reach of anenlightened man . . . is within reach of God.”Langdon felt unswayed by the wordplay.“Even the Bible concurs,” Bellamy said. “If we accept, as Genesis tells us, that‘God created man in his own image,’ then we also must accept what thisimplies—that mankind was not created inferior to God. In Luke 17:20 we are told,‘The kingdom of God is within you.’ ”“I’m sorry, but I don’t know any Christians who consider themselves God’sequal.”“Of course not,” Bellamy said, his tone hardening. “Because most Christians wantit both ways. They want to be able to proudly declare they are believers in theBible and yet simply ignore those parts they find too difficult or tooinconvenient to believe.”Langdon made no response.“Anyhow,” Bellamy said, “the Masonic Pyramid’s age-old description as being tallenough to be touched by God . . . this has long led to misinterpretations aboutits size. Conveniently, it keeps academics like yourself insisting the pyramidis a legend, and nobody searches for it.”Langdon looked down at the stone pyramid. “I apologize that I’m frustratingyou,” he said. “I’ve simply always thought of the Masonic Pyramid as a myth.”“Does it not seem perfectly fitting to you that a map created by stonemasonswould be carved in stone? Throughout history, our most important guideposts havealways been carved in stone—including the tablets God gave Moses—TenCommandments to guide our human conduct.”“I understand, and yet it is always referred to as the Legend of the MasonicPyramid. Legend implies it is mythical.”“Yes, legend.” Bellamy chuckled. “I’m afraid you’re suffering from the sameproblem Moses had.”“I’m sorry?”Bellamy looked almost amused as he turned in his seat, glancing up at thesecond-tier balcony, where sixteen bronze statues peered down at them. “Do yousee Moses?”Langdon gazed up at the library’s celebrated statue of Moses. “Yes.”“He has horns.”“I’m aware of that.”“But do you know why he has horns?”Like most teachers, Langdon did not enjoy being lectured to. The Moses abovethem had horns for the same reason thousands of Christian images of Moses hadhorns—a mistranslation of the book of Exodus. The original Hebrew text describedMoses as having “karan ’ohr panav”—“facial skin that glowed with rays oflight”—but when the Roman Catholic Church created the official Latin translationof the Bible, the translator bungled Moses’s description, rendering it as“cornuta esset facies sua,” meaning “his face was horned.” From that moment on,artists and sculptors, fearing reprisals if they were not true to the Gospels,began depicting Moses with horns.“It was a simple mistake,” Langdon replied. “A mistranslation by Saint Jeromearound four hundred A.D.” Bellamy looked impressed. “Exactly. A mistranslation.And the result is . . . poor Moses is now misshapen for all history.”“Misshapen” was a nice way to put it. Langdon, as a child, had been terrifiedwhen he saw Michelangelo’s diabolical “horned Moses”—the centerpiece of Rome’sBasilica of St. Peter in Chains.“I mention the horned Moses,” Bellamy now said, “to illustrate how a singleword, misunderstood, can rewrite history.”You’re preaching to the choir, Langdon thought, having learned the lessonfirsthand in Paris a number of years back. SanGreal: Holy Grail. SangReal: RoyalBlood.“In the case of the Masonic Pyramid,” Bellamy continued, “people heard whispersabout a ‘legend.’ And the idea stuck. The Legend of the Masonic Pyramid soundedlike a myth. But the word legend was referring to something else. It had beenmisconstrued. Much like the word talisman.” He smiled. “Language can be veryadept at hiding the truth.”“That’s true, but you’re losing me here.”“Robert, the Masonic Pyramid is a map. And like every map, it has a legend—a keythat tells you how to read it.” Bellamy took the cube-shaped package and held itup. “Don’t you see? This capstone is the legend to the pyramid. It is the keythat tells you how to read the most powerful artifact on earth . . . a map thatunveils the hiding place of mankind’s greatest treasure—the lost wisdom of theages.”Langdon fell silent.“I humbly submit,” Bellamy said, “that your towering Masonic Pyramid is onlythis . . . a modest stone whose golden capstone reaches high enough to betouched by God. High enough that an enlightened man can reach down and touchit.”Silence hung between the two men for several seconds.Langdon felt an unexpected pulse of excitement as he looked down at the pyramid,seeing it in a new light. His eyes moved again to the Masonic cipher. “But thiscode . . . it seems so . . .”“Simple?”Langdon nodded. “Almost anyone could decipher this.”Bellamy smiled and retrieved a pencil and paper for Langdon. “Then perhaps youshould enlighten us?”Langdon felt uneasy about reading the code, and yet considering thecircumstances, it seemed a minor betrayal of Peter’s trust. Moreover, whateverthe engraving said, he could not imagine that it unveiled a secret hiding placeof anything at all . . . much less that of one of history’s greatest treasures.Langdon accepted the pencil from Bellamy and tapped it on his chin as he studiedthe cipher. The code was so simple that he barely needed pencil and paper. Evenso, he wanted to ensure he made no mistakes, and so he dutifully put pencil topaper and wrote down the most common decryption key for a Masonic cipher. Thekey consisted of four grids—two plain and two dotted—with the alphabet runningthrough them in order. Each letter of the alphabet was now positioned inside auniquely shaped “enclosure” or “pen.” The shape of each letter’s enclosurebecame the symbol for that letter.The scheme was so simple, it was almost infantile.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_011_r1.jpg]Langdon double-checked his handiwork. Feeling confident the decryption key wascorrect, he now turned his attention back to the code inscribed on the pyramid.To decipher it, all he had to do was to find the matching shape on hisdecryption key and write down the letter inside it.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_010_r1.jpg]The first character on the pyramid looked like a down arrow or a chalice.Langdon quickly found the chalice-shaped segment on the decryption key. It waslocated in the lower left-hand corner and enclosed the letter S.Langdon wrote down S.The next symbol on the pyramid was a dotted square missing its right side. Thatshape on the decryption grid enclosed the letter O.He wrote down O.The third symbol was a simple square, which enclosed the letter E.Langdon wrote down E.S O E . . .He continued, picking up speed until he had completed the entire grid.Now, as he gazed down at his finished translation, Langdon let out a puzzledsigh. Hardly what I’d call a eureka moment.Bellamy’s face showed the hint of a smile. “As you know, Professor, the AncientMysteries are reserved only for the truly enlightened.”“Right,” Langdon said, frowning. Apparently, I don’t qualify."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 50In a basement office deep inside CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the samesixteen-character Masonic cipher glowed brightly on a high-definition computermonitor. Senior OS analyst Nola Kaye sat alone and studied the image that hadbeen e-mailed to her ten minutes ago by her boss, Director Inoue Sato.Is this some kind of joke? Nola knew it was not, of course; Director Sato had nosense of humor, and the events of tonight were anything but a joking matter.Nola’s high-level clearance within the CIA’s all-seeing Office of Security hadopened her eyes to the shadow worlds of power. But what Nola had witnessed inthe last twenty-four hours had changed her impressions forever of the secretsthat powerful men kept.“Yes, Director,” Nola now said, cradling the phone on her shoulder as she talkedto Sato. “The engraving is indeed the Masonic cipher. However, the cleartext ismeaningless. It appears to be a grid of random letters.” She gazed down at herdecryption.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_012_r1.jpg]“It must say something,” Sato insisted.“Not unless it has a second layer of encryption that I’m not aware of.”“Any guesses?” Sato asked.“It’s a grid-based matrix, so I could run the usual—Vigenère, grilles,trellises, and so forth—but no promises, especially if it’s a onetime pad.”“Do what you can. And do it fast. How about the X-ray?”Nola swiveled her chair to a second system, which displayed a standard securityX-ray of someone’s bag. Sato had requested information on what appeared to be asmall pyramid inside a cube-shaped box. Normally, a two-inch-tall object wouldnot be an issue of national security unless it was made of enriched plutonium.This one was not. It was made of something almost equally startling.“Image-density analysis was conclusive,” Nola said. “Nineteen-point-three gramsper cubic centimeter. It’s pure gold. Very, very valuable.”“Anything else?”“Actually, yes. The density scan picked up minor irregularities on the surfaceof the gold pyramid. It turns out the gold is engraved with text.”“Really?” Sato sounded hopeful. “What does it say?”“I can’t tell yet. The inscription is extremely faint. I’m trying to enhancewith filters, but the resolution on the X-ray is not great.”“Okay, keep trying. Call me when you have something.”“Yes, ma’am.”“And, Nola?” Sato’s tone turned ominous. “As with everything you have learned inthe last twenty-four hours, the images of the stone pyramid and gold capstoneare classified at the highest levels of security. You are to consult no one. Youreport to me directly. I want to make sure that is clear.”“Of course, ma’am.”“Good. Keep me posted.” Sato hung up.Nola rubbed her eyes and looked blearily back at her computer screens. She hadnot slept in over thirty-six hours, and she knew damn well she would not sleepagain until this crisis had reached its conclusion.Whatever that may be.Back at the Capitol Visitor Center, four black-clad CIA field-op specialistsstood at the entrance to the tunnel, peering hungrily down the dimly lit shaftlike a pack of dogs eager for the hunt.Sato approached, having just hung up from a call. “Gentlemen,” she said, stillholding the Architect’s key, “are your mission parameters clear?”“Affirmative,” the lead agent replied. “We have two targets. The first is anengraved stone pyramid, approximately one foot tall. The second is a smaller,cube-shaped package, approximately two inches tall. Both were last seen inRobert Langdon’s shoulder bag.”“Correct,” Sato said. “These two items must be retrieved quickly and intact. Doyou have any questions?”“Parameters for use of force?”Sato’s shoulder was still throbbing from where Bellamy had struck her with abone. “As I said, it is of critical importance that these items be retrieved.”“Understood.” The four men turned and headed into the darkness of the tunnel.Sato lit a cigarette and watched them disappear."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 51Katherine Solomon had always been a prudent driver, but now she was pushing herVolvo at over ninety as she fled blindly up the Suitland Parkway. Her tremblingfoot had been lodged on the accelerator for a full mile before her panic beganto lift. She now realized her uncontrollable shivering was no longer solely fromfear.I’m freezing.The wintry night air was gushing through her shattered window, buffeting herbody like an arctic wind. Her stockinged feet were numb, and she reached downfor her spare pair of shoes, which she kept beneath the passenger seat. As shedid, she felt a stab of pain from the bruise on her throat, where the powerfulhand had latched on to her neck.The man who had smashed through her window bore no resemblance to theblond-haired gentleman whom Katherine knew as Dr. Christopher Abaddon. His thickhair and smooth, tanned complexion had disappeared. His shaved head, bare chest,and makeup-smeared face had been unveiled as a terrifying tapestry of tattoos.She heard his voice again, whispering to her in the howl of wind outside herbroken window. Katherine, I should have killed you years ago . . . the night Ikilled your mother.Katherine shivered, feeling no doubt. That was him. She had never forgotten thelook of fiendish violence in his eyes. Nor had she ever forgotten the sound ofher brother’s single gunshot, which had killed this man, propelling him off ahigh ledge into the frozen river below, where he plummeted through the ice andnever resurfaced. Investigators had searched for weeks, never finding his body,and finally decided it had been washed away by the current out to the ChesapeakeBay.They were wrong, she now knew. He is still alive.And he’s back.Katherine felt angst-ridden as the memories flooded back. It was almost exactlyten years ago. Christmas Day. Katherine, Peter, and their mother—her entirefamily—were gathered at their sprawling stone mansion in Potomac, nestled on atwo-hundred-acre wooded estate with its own river running through it.As was tradition, their mother worked diligently in the kitchen, rejoicing inthe holiday custom of cooking for her two children. Even at seventy-five yearsof age, Isabel Solomon was an exuberant cook, and tonight the mouthwateringsmells of roast venison, parsnip gravy, and garlic mashed potatoes waftedthrough the house. While Mother prepared the feast, Katherine and her brotherrelaxed in the conservatory, discussing Katherine’s latest fascination—a newfield called Noetic Science. An unlikely fusion of modern particle physics andancient mysticism, Noetics had absolutely captivated Katherine’s imagination.Physics meets philosophy.Katherine told Peter about some of the experiments she was dreaming up, and shecould see in his eyes that he was intrigued. Katherine felt particularly pleasedto give her brother something positive to think about this Christmas, since theholiday had also become a painful reminder of a terrible tragedy.Peter’s son, Zachary.Katherine’s nephew’s twenty-first birthday had been his last. The family hadbeen through a nightmare, and it seemed that her brother was only now finallylearning how to laugh again.Zachary had been a late bloomer, frail and awkward, a rebellious and angryteenager. Despite his deeply loving and privileged upbringing, the boy seemeddetermined to detach himself from the Solomon “establishment.” He was kicked outof prep school, partied hard with the “celebrati,” and shunned his parents’exhaustive attempts to provide him firm and loving guidance.He broke Peter’s heart.Shortly before Zachary’s eighteenth birthday, Katherine had sat down with hermother and brother and listened to them debating whether or not to withholdZachary’s inheritance until he was more mature. The Solomon inheritance—acenturies-old tradition in the family—bequeathed a staggeringly generous pieceof the Solomon wealth to every Solomon child on his or her eighteenth birthday.The Solomons believed that an inheritance was more helpful at the beginning ofsomeone’s life than at the end. Moreover, placing large pieces of the Solomonfortune in the hands of eager young descendants had been the key to growing thefamily’s dynastic wealth.In this case, however, Katherine’s mother argued that it was dangerous to givePeter’s troubled son such a large sum of money. Peter disagreed.“The Solomon inheritance,” her brother had said, “is a family tradition thatshould not be broken. This money may well force Zachary to be more responsible.”Sadly, her brother had been wrong.The moment Zachary received the money, he broke from the family, disappearingfrom the house without taking any of his belongings. He surfaced a few monthslater in the tabloids: TRUST FUND PLAYBOY LIVING EUROPEAN HIGH LIFE.The tabloids took joy in documenting Zachary’s spoiled life of debauchery. Thephotos of wild parties on yachts and drunken disco stupors were hard for theSolomons to take, but the photos of their wayward teen turned from tragic tofrightening when the papers reported Zachary had been caught carrying cocaineacross a border in Eastern Europe: SOLOMON MILLIONAIRE IN TURKISH PRISON.The prison, they learned, was called Soganlik—a brutal F-class detention centerlocated in the Kartal district outside of Istanbul. Peter Solomon, fearing forhis son’s safety, flew to Turkey to retrieve him. Katherine’s distraught brotherreturned empty-handed, having been forbidden even to visit with Zachary. Theonly promising news was that Solomon’s influential contacts at the U.S. StateDepartment were working on getting him extradited as quickly as possible.Two days later, however, Peter received a horrifying international phone call.The next morning, headlines blared: SOLOMON HEIR MURDERED IN PRISON.The prison photos were horrific, and the media callously aired them all, evenlong after the Solomons’ private burial ceremony. Peter’s wife never forgave himfor failing to free Zachary, and their marriage came to an end six months later.Peter had been alone ever since.It was years later that Katherine, Peter, and their mother, Isabel, weregathered quietly for Christmas. The pain was still a presence in their family,but mercifully it was fading with each passing year. The pleasant rattle of potsand pans now echoed from the kitchen as their mother prepared the traditionalfeast. Out in the conservatory, Peter and Katherine were enjoying a baked Brieand relaxed holiday conversation.Then came an utterly unexpected sound.“Hello, Solomons,” an airy voice said behind them.Startled, Katherine and her brother spun to see an enormous muscular figurestepping into the conservatory. He wore a black ski mask that covered all of hisface except his eyes, which shone with feral ferocity.Peter was on his feet in an instant. “Who are you?! How did you get in here?!”“I knew your little boy, Zachary, in prison. He told me where this key washidden.” The stranger held up an old key and grinned like a beast. “Right beforeI bludgeoned him to death.”Peter’s mouth fell open.A pistol appeared, aimed directly at Peter’s chest. “Sit.”Peter fell back into his chair.As the man moved into the room, Katherine was frozen in place. Behind his mask,the man’s eyes were wild like those of a rabid animal.“Hey!” Peter yelled, as if trying to warn their mother in the kitchen. “Whoeveryou are, take what you want, and get out!”The man leveled his gun at Peter’s chest. “And what is it you think I want?”“Just tell me how much,” Solomon said. “We don’t have money in the house, but Ican—”The monster laughed. “Do not insult me. I have not come for money. I have cometonight for Zachary’s other birthright.” He grinned. “He told me about thepyramid.”Pyramid? Katherine thought in bewildered terror. What pyramid?Her brother was defiant. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”“Don’t play dumb with me! Zachary told me what you keep in your study vault. Iwant it. Now.”“Whatever Zachary told you, he was confused,” Peter said. “I don’t know whatyou’re talking about!”“No?” The intruder turned and aimed the gun at Katherine’s face. “How aboutnow?”Peter’s eyes filled with terror. “You must believe me! I don’t know what it isyou want!”“Lie to me one more time,” he said, still aiming at Katherine, “and I swear Iwill take her from you.” He smiled. “And from what Zachary said, your littlesister is more precious to you than all your—”“What’s going on?!” Katherine’s mother shouted, marching into the room withPeter’s Browning Citori shotgun—which she aimed directly at the man’s chest. Theintruder spun toward her, and the feisty seventy-five-year-old woman wasted notime. She fired a deafening blast of pellets. The intruder staggered backward,firing his handgun wildly in all directions, shattering windows as he fell andcrashed through the glass doorway, dropping the pistol as he fell.Peter was instantly in motion, diving on the loose handgun. Katherine hadfallen, and Mrs. Solomon hurried to her side, kneeling beside her. “My God, areyou hurt?!”Katherine shook her head, mute with shock. Outside the shattered glass door, themasked man had clambered to his feet and was running into the woods, clutchinghis side as he ran. Peter Solomon glanced back to make sure his mother andsister were safe, and seeing they were fine, he held the pistol and raced outthe door after the intruder.Katherine’s mother held her hand, trembling. “Thank heavens you’re okay.” Thensuddenly her mother pulled away. “Katherine? You’re bleeding! There’s blood!You’re hurt!”Katherine saw the blood. A lot of blood. It was all over her. But she felt nopain.Her mother frantically searched Katherine’s body for a wound. “Where does ithurt!”“Mom, I don’t know, I don’t feel anything!”Then Katherine saw the source of the blood, and she went cold. “Mom, it’s not me. . .” She pointed to the side of her mother’s white satin blouse, where bloodwas running freely, and a small tattered hole was visible. Her mother glanceddown, looking more confused than anything else. She winced and shrank back, asif the pain had just hit her.“Katherine?” Her voice was calm, but suddenly it carried the weight of herseventy-five years. “I need you to call an ambulance.”Katherine ran to the hall phone and called for help. When she got back to theconservatory, she found her mother lying motionless in a pool of blood. She ranto her, crouching down, cradling her mother’s body in her arms.Katherine had no idea how much time had passed when she heard the distantgunshot in the woods. Finally, the conservatory door burst open, and herbrother, Peter, rushed in, eyes wild, gun still in his hand. When he sawKatherine sobbing, holding their lifeless mother in her arms, his face contortedin anguish. The scream that echoed through the conservatory was a soundKatherine Solomon would never forget."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 52Mal’akh could feel the tattooed muscles on his back rippling as he sprinted backaround the building toward the open bay door of Pod 5.I must gain access to her lab.Katherine’s escape had been unanticipated . . . and problematic. Not only didshe know where Mal’akh lived, she now knew his true identity . . . and that hewas the one who had invaded their home a decade earlier.Mal’akh had not forgotten that night either. He had come within inches ofpossessing the pyramid, but destiny had obstructed him. I was not yet ready. Buthe was ready now. More powerful. More influential. Having endured unthinkablehardship in preparation for his return, Mal’akh was poised tonight to fulfillhis destiny at last. He felt certain that before the night was over, he wouldindeed be staring into the dying eyes of Katherine Solomon.As Mal’akh reached the bay door, he reassured himself that Katherine had nottruly escaped; she had only prolonged the inevitable. He slid through theopening and strode confidently across the darkness until his feet hit thecarpet. Then he took a right turn and headed for the Cube. The banging on thedoor of Pod 5 had stopped, and Mal’akh suspected the guard was now trying toremove the dime Mal’akh had jammed into the key panel to render it useless.When Mal’akh reached the door that led into the Cube, he located the outerkeypad and inserted Trish’s key card. The panel lit up. He entered Trish’s PINand went inside. The lights were all ablaze, and as he moved into the sterilespace, he squinted in amazement at the dazzling array of equipment. Mal’akh wasno stranger to the power of technology; he performed his own breed of science inthe basement of his home, and last night some of that science had borne fruit.The Truth.Peter Solomon’s unique confinement—trapped alone in the in-between—had laid bareall of the man’s secrets. I can see his soul. Mal’akh had learned certainsecrets he anticipated, and others he had not, including the news aboutKatherine’s lab and her shocking discoveries. Science is getting close, Mal’akhhad realized. And I will not allow it to light the way for the unworthy.Katherine’s work here had begun using modern science to answer ancientphilosophical questions. Does anyone hear our prayers? Is there life afterdeath? Do humans have souls? Incredibly, Katherine had answered all of thesequestions, and more. Scientifically. Conclusively. The methods she used wereirrefutable. Even the most skeptical of people would be persuaded by the resultsof her experiments. If this information were published and made known, afundamental shift would begin in the consciousness of man. They will start tofind their way. Mal’akh’s last task tonight, before his transformation, was toensure that this did not happen.As he moved through the lab, Mal’akh located the data room that Peter had toldhim about. He peered through the heavy glass walls at the two holographicdata-storage units. Exactly as he said they would be. Mal’akh found it hard toimagine that the contents of these little boxes could change the course of humandevelopment, and yet Truth had always been the most potent of all the catalysts.Eyeing the holographic storage units, Mal’akh produced Trish’s key card andinserted it in the door’s security panel. To his surprise, the panel did notlight up. Apparently, access to this room was not a trust extended to TrishDunne. He now reached for the key card he had found in Katherine’s lab-coatpocket. When he inserted this one, the panel lit up.Mal’akh had a problem. I never got Katherine’s PIN. He tried Trish’s PIN, but itdidn’t work. Stroking his chin, he stepped back and examined thethree-inch-thick Plexiglas door. Even with an ax, he knew he would be unable tobreak through and obtain the drives he needed to destroy.Mal’akh had planned for this contingency, however.Inside the power-supply room, exactly as Peter had described, Mal’akh locatedthe rack holding several metal cylinders resembling large scuba tanks. Thecylinders bore the letters LH, the number 2, and the universal symbol forcombustible. One of the canisters was connected to the lab’s hydrogen fuel cell.Mal’akh left one canister connected and carefully heaved one of the reservecylinders down onto a dolly beside the rack. Then he rolled the cylinder out ofthe power-supply room, across the lab, to the Plexiglas door of the data-storageroom. Although this location would certainly be plenty close enough, he hadnoticed one weakness in the heavy Plexiglas door—the small space between thebottom and the jamb.At the threshold, he carefully laid the canister on its side and slid theflexible rubber tube beneath the door. It took him a moment to remove the safetyseals and access the cylinder’s valve, but once he did, ever so gently, heuncocked the valve. Through the Plexiglas, he could see the clear, bubblingliquid begin draining out of the tube onto the floor inside the storage room.Mal’akh watched the puddle expand, oozing across the floor, steaming andbubbling as it grew. Hydrogen remained in liquid form only when it was cold, andas it warmed up, it would start to boil off. The resulting gas, conveniently,was even more flammable than the liquid.Remember the Hindenburg.Mal’akh hurried now into the lab and retrieved the Pyrex jug of Bunsen-burnerfuel—a viscous, highly flammable, yet noncombustible oil. He carried it to thePlexiglas door, pleased to see the liquid hydrogen canister was still draining,the puddle of boiling liquid inside the data-storage room now covering theentire floor, encircling the pedestals that supported the holographic storageunits. A whitish mist now rose from the boiling puddle as the liquid hydrogenbegan turning to gas . . . filling the small space.Mal’akh raised the jug of Bunsen-burner fuel and squirted a healthy amount onthe hydrogen canister, the tubing, and into the small opening beneath the door.Then, very carefully, he began backing out of the lab, leaving an unbrokenstream of oil on the floor as he went.The dispatch operator handling 911 calls for Washington, D.C., had beenunusually busy tonight. Football, beer, and a full moon, she thought as yetanother emergency call appeared on her screen, this one from a gas-station payphone on the Suitland Parkway in Anacostia. A car accident probably.“Nine-one-one,” she answered. “What is your emergency?”“I was just attacked at the Smithsonian Museum Support Center,” a panickedwoman’s voice said. “Please send the police! Forty-two-ten Silver Hill Road!”“Okay, slow down,” the operator said. “You need to—”“I need you to send officers also to a mansion in Kalorama Heights where I thinkmy brother may be held captive!”The operator sighed. Full moon."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 53As I tried to tell you,” Bellamy was saying to Langdon, “there is more to thispyramid than meets the eye.”Apparently so. Langdon had to admit that the stone pyramid sitting in hisunzipped daybag looked much more mysterious to him now. His decryption of theMasonic cipher had rendered a seemingly meaningless grid of letters.Chaos.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_012_r1.jpg]For a long while, Langdon examined the grid, searching for any hint of meaningwithin the letters—hidden words, anagrams, clues of any sort—but he foundnothing.“The Masonic Pyramid,” Bellamy explained, “is said to guard its secrets behindmany veils. Each time you pull back a curtain, you face another. You haveunveiled these letters, and yet they tell you nothing until you peel backanother layer. Of course, the way to do that is known only to the one who holdsthe capstone. The capstone, I suspect, has an inscription as well, which tellsyou how to decipher the pyramid.”Langdon glanced at the cube-shaped package on the desk. From what Bellamy hadsaid, Langdon now understood that the capstone and pyramid were a “segmentedcipher”—a code broken into pieces. Modern cryptologists used segmented ciphersall the time, although the security scheme had been invented in ancient Greece.The Greeks, when they wanted to store secret information, inscribed it on a claytablet and then shattered the tablet into pieces, storing each piece in aseparate location. Only when all the pieces were gathered together could thesecrets be read. This kind of inscribed clay tablet—called a symbolon—was infact the origin of the modern word symbol.“Robert,” Bellamy said, “this pyramid and capstone have been kept apart forgenerations, ensuring the secret’s safety.” His tone turned rueful. “Tonight,however, the pieces have come dangerously close. I’m sure I don’t have to saythis . . . but it is our duty to ensure this pyramid is not assembled.”Langdon found Bellamy’s sense of drama to be somewhat overwrought. Is hedescribing the capstone and pyramid . . . or a detonator and nuclear bomb? Hestill couldn’t quite accept Bellamy’s claims, but it hardly seemed to matter.“Even if this is the Masonic Pyramid, and even if this inscription does somehowreveal the location of ancient knowledge, how could that knowledge possiblyimpart the kind of power it is said to impart?”“Peter always told me you were a hard man to convince—an academic who prefersproof to speculation.”“You’re saying you do believe that?” Langdon demanded, feeling impatient now.“Respectfully . . . you are a modern, educated man. How could you believe such athing?”Bellamy gave a patient smile. “The craft of Freemasonry has given me a deeprespect for that which transcends human understanding. I’ve learned never toclose my mind to an idea simply because it seems miraculous.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 54Frantically, the SMSC perimeter patrolman dashed down the gravel pathway thatran along the outside of the building. He’d just received a call from an officerinside saying that the keypad to Pod 5 had been sabotaged, and that a securitylight indicated that Pod 5’s specimen bay door was now open.What the hell is going on?!As he arrived at the specimen bay, sure enough he found the door open a coupleof feet. Bizarre, he thought. This can only be unlocked from the inside. He tookthe flashlight off his belt and shone it into the inky blackness of the pod.Nothing. Having no desire to step into the unknown, he moved only as far as thethreshold and then stuck the flashlight through the opening, swinging it to theleft, and then to the—Powerful hands seized his wrist and yanked him into the blackness. The guardfelt himself being spun around by an invisible force. He smelled ethanol. Theflashlight flew out of his hand, and before he could even process what washappening, a rock-hard fist collided with his sternum. The guard crumpled to thecement floor . . . groaning in pain as a large black form stepped away from him.The guard lay on his side, gasping and wheezing for breath. His flashlight laynearby, its beam spilling across the floor and illuminating what appeared to bea metal can of some sort. The can’s label said it was fuel oil for a Bunsenburner.A cigarette lighter sparked, and the orange flame illuminated a vision thathardly seemed human. Jesus Christ! The guard barely had time to process what hewas seeing before the bare-chested creature knelt down and touched the flame tothe floor.Instantly, a strip of fire materialized, leaping away from them, racing into thevoid. Bewildered, the guard looked back, but the creature was already slippingout the open bay door into the night.The guard managed to sit up, wincing in pain as his eyes followed the thinribbon of fire. What the hell?! The flame looked too small to be trulydangerous, and yet now he saw something utterly terrifying. The fire was nolonger illuminating only the darkened void. It had traveled all the way to theback wall, where it was now illuminating a massive cinder-block structure. Theguard had never been permitted inside Pod 5, but he knew very well what thisstructure must be.The Cube.Katherine Solomon’s lab.The flame raced in a straight line directly to the lab’s outer door. The guardclambered to his feet, knowing full well that the ribbon of oil probablycontinued beneath the lab door . . . and would soon start a fire inside. But ashe turned to run for help, he felt an unexpected puff of air sucking past him.For a brief instant, all of Pod 5 was bathed in light.The guard never saw the hydrogen fireball erupting skyward, ripping the roof offPod 5 and billowing hundreds of feet into the air. Nor did he see the skyraining fragments of titanium mesh, electronic equipment, and droplets of meltedsilicon from the lab’s holographic storage units.Katherine Solomon was driving north when she saw the sudden flash of light inher rearview mirror. A deep rumble thundered through the night air, startlingher.Fireworks? she wondered. Do the Redskins have a halftime show?She refocused on the road, her thoughts still on the 911 call she’d placed fromthe deserted gas station’s pay phone.Katherine had successfully convinced the 911 dispatcher to send the police tothe SMSC to investigate a tattooed intruder and, Katherine prayed, to find herassistant, Trish. In addition, she urged the dispatcher to check Dr. Abaddon’saddress in Kalorama Heights, where she thought Peter was being held hostage.Unfortunately, Katherine had been unable to obtain Robert Langdon’s unlistedcell-phone number. So now, seeing no other option, she was speeding toward theLibrary of Congress, where Langdon had told her he was headed.The terrifying revelation of Dr. Abaddon’s true identity had changed everything.Katherine had no idea what to believe anymore. All she knew for certain was thatthe same man who had killed her mother and nephew all those years ago had nowcaptured her brother and had come to kill her. Who is this madman? What does hewant? The only answer she could come up with made no sense. A pyramid? Equallyconfusing was why this man had come to her lab tonight. If he wanted to hurther, why hadn’t he done so in the privacy of his own home earlier today? Why goto the trouble of sending a text message and risk breaking into her lab?Unexpectedly, the fireworks in her rearview mirror grew brighter, the initialflash followed by an unexpected sight—a blazing orange fireball that Katherinecould see rising above the tree line. What in the world?! The fireball wasaccompanied by dark black smoke . . . and it was nowhere near the Redskins’FedEx Field. Bewildered, she tried to determine what industry might be locatedon the other side of those trees . . . just southeast of the parkway.Then, like an oncoming truck, it hit her."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 55Warren Bellamy stabbed urgently at the buttons on his cell phone, trying againto make contact with someone who could help them, whoever that might be.Langdon watched Bellamy, but his mind was with Peter, trying to figure out howbest to find him. Decipher the engraving, Peter’s captor had commanded, and itwill tell you the hiding place of mankind’s greatest treasure . . . We will gotogether . . . and make our trade.Bellamy hung up, frowning. Still no answer.“Here’s what I don’t understand,” Langdon said. “Even if I could somehow acceptthat this hidden wisdom exists . . . and that this pyramid somehow points to itsunderground location . . . what am I looking for? A vault? A bunker?”Bellamy sat quietly for a long moment. Then he gave a reluctant sigh and spokeguardedly. “Robert, according to what I’ve heard through the years, the pyramidleads to the entrance of a spiral staircase.”“A staircase?”“That’s right. A staircase that leads down into the earth . . . many hundreds offeet.”Langdon could not believe what he was hearing. He leaned closer.“I’ve heard it said that the ancient wisdom is buried at the bottom.”Robert Langdon stood up and began pacing. A spiral staircase descending hundredsof feet into the earth . . . in Washington, D.C. “And nobody has ever seen thisstaircase?”“Allegedly the entrance has been covered with an enormous stone.”Langdon sighed. The idea of a tomb covered with an enormous stone was right outof the biblical accounts of Jesus’ tomb. This archetypal hybrid was thegrandfather of them all. “Warren, do you believe this secret mystical staircaseinto the earth exists?”“I’ve never seen it personally, but a few of the older Masons swear it exists. Iwas trying to call one of them just now.”Langdon continued pacing, uncertain what to say next.“Robert, you leave me a difficult task with respect to this pyramid.” WarrenBellamy’s gaze hardened in the soft glow of the reading lamp. “I know of no wayto force a man to believe what he does not want to believe. And yet I hope youunderstand your duty to Peter Solomon.”Yes, I have a duty to help him, Langdon thought.“I don’t need you to believe in the power this pyramid can unveil. Nor do I needyou to believe in the staircase it supposedly leads to. But I do need you tobelieve that you are morally obliged to protect this secret . . . whatever itmay be.” Bellamy motioned to the little cube-shaped package. “Peter entrustedthe capstone to you because he had faith you would obey his wishes and keep itsecret. And now you must do exactly that, even if it means sacrificing Peter’slife.”Langdon stopped short and wheeled around. “What?!”Bellamy remained seated, his expression pained but resolute. “It’s what he wouldwant. You need to forget Peter. He’s gone. Peter did his job, doing the best hecould to protect the pyramid. Now it is our job to make sure his efforts werenot in vain.”“I can’t believe you’re saying this!” Langdon exclaimed, temper flaring. “Evenif this pyramid is everything you say it is, Peter is your Masonic brother.You’re sworn to protect him above all else, even your country!”“No, Robert. A Mason must protect a fellow Mason above all things . . . exceptone—the great secret our brotherhood protects for all mankind. Whether or not Ibelieve this lost wisdom has the potential that history suggests, I have taken avow to keep it out of the hands of the unworthy. And I would not give it over toanyone . . . even in exchange for Peter Solomon’s life.”“I know plenty of Masons,” Langdon said angrily, “including the most advanced,and I’m damned sure these men are not sworn to sacrifice their lives for thesake of a stone pyramid. And I’m also damned sure none of them believes in asecret staircase that descends to a treasure buried deep in the earth.”“There are circles within circles, Robert. Not everyone knows everything.”Langdon exhaled, trying to control his emotions. He, like everyone, had heardthe rumors of elite circles within the Masons. Whether or not it was true seemedirrelevant in the face of this situation. “Warren, if this pyramid and capstonetruly reveal the ultimate Masonic secret, then why would Peter involve me? I’mnot even a brother . . . much less part of any inner circle.”“I know, and I suspect that is precisely why Peter chose you to guard it. Thispyramid has been targeted in the past, even by those who infiltrated ourbrotherhood with unworthy motives. Peter’s choice to store it outside thebrotherhood was a clever one.”“Were you aware I had the capstone?” Langdon asked.“No. And if Peter told anyone at all, it would have been only one man.” Bellamypulled out his cell phone and hit redial. “And so far, I’ve been unable to reachhim.” He got a voice-mail greeting and hung up. “Well, Robert, it looks like youand I are on our own for the moment. And we have a decision to make.”Langdon looked at his Mickey Mouse watch. 9:42 P.M. “You do realize that Peter’scaptor is waiting for me to decipher this pyramid tonight and tell him what itsays.”Bellamy frowned. “Great men throughout history have made deep personalsacrifices to protect the Ancient Mysteries. You and I must do the same.” Hestood up now. “We should keep moving. Sooner or later Sato will figure out wherewe are.”“What about Katherine?!” Langdon demanded, not wanting to leave. “I can’t reachher, and she never called.”“Obviously, something happened.”“But we can’t just abandon her!”“Forget Katherine!” Bellamy said, his voice commanding now. “Forget Peter!Forget everyone! Don’t you understand, Robert, that you’ve been entrusted with aduty that is bigger than all of us—you, Peter, Katherine, myself?” He lockedeyes with Langdon. “We need to find a safe place to hide this pyramid andcapstone far from—”A loud metallic crash echoed in the direction of the great hall.Bellamy wheeled, eyes filling with fear. “That was fast.”Langdon turned toward the door. The sound apparently had come from the metalbucket that Bellamy had placed on the ladder blocking the tunnel doors. They’recoming for us.Then, quite unexpectedly, the crash echoed again.And again.And again.The homeless man on the bench in front of the Library of Congress rubbed hiseyes and watched the strange scene unfolding before him.A white Volvo had just jumped the curb, lurched across the deserted pedestrianwalkway, and screeched to a halt at the foot of the library’s main entrance. Anattractive, dark-haired woman had leaped out, anxiously surveyed the area, and,spotting the homeless man, had shouted, “Do you have a phone?”Lady, I don’t have a left shoe.Apparently realizing as much, the woman dashed up the staircase toward thelibrary’s main doors. Arriving at the top of the stairs, she grabbed the handleand tried desperately to open each of the three giant doors.The library’s closed, lady.But the woman didn’t seem to care. She seized one of the heavy ring-shapedhandles, heaved it backward, and let it fall with a loud crash against the door.Then she did it again. And again. And again.Wow, the homeless man thought, she must really need a book."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 56When Katherine Solomon finally saw the massive bronze doors of the library swingopen before her, she felt as if an emotional floodgate had burst. All the fearand confusion she had bottled up tonight came pouring through.The figure in the library doorway was Warren Bellamy, a friend and confidant ofher brother’s. But it was the man behind Bellamy in the shadows whom Katherinefelt happiest to see. The feeling was apparently mutual. Robert Langdon’s eyesfilled with relief as she rushed through the doorway . . . directly into hisarms.As Katherine lost herself in the comforting embrace of an old friend, Bellamyclosed the front door. She heard the heavy lock click into place, and at lastshe felt safe. Tears came unexpectedly, but she fought them back.Langdon held her. “It’s okay,” he whispered. “You’re okay.”Because you saved me, Katherine wanted to tell him. He destroyed my lab . . .all my work. Years of research . . . up in smoke. She wanted to tell himeverything, but she could barely breathe.“We’ll find Peter.” Langdon’s deep voice resonated against her chest, comfortingher somehow. “I promise.”I know who did this! Katherine wanted to yell. The same man who killed my motherand nephew! Before she could explain herself, an unexpected sound broke thesilence of the library.The loud crash echoed up from beneath them in a vestibule stairwell—as if alarge metal object had fallen on a tile floor.

The threesome arrived at a reading desk where a leather bag satbeneath a light. Beside the bag, there was a tiny cube-shaped package, whichBellamy scooped up and placed inside the bag, alongside a—Katherine stopped short. A pyramid?Although she had never seen this engraved stone pyramid, she felt her entirebody recoil in recognition. Somehow her gut knew the truth. Katherine Solomonhad just come face-to-face with the object that had so deeply damaged her life.The pyramid.Bellamy zipped up the bag and handed it to Langdon. “Don’t let this out of yoursight.”A sudden explosion rocked the room’s outer doors. The tinkling of shatteredglass followed.“This way!” Bellamy spun, looking scared now as he rushed them over to thecentral circulation desk—eight counters around a massive octagonal cabinet. Heguided them in behind the counters and then pointed to an opening in thecabinet. “Get in there!”“In there?” Langdon demanded. “They’ll find us for sure!”“Trust me,” Bellamy said. “It’s not what you think.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 57Mal’akh gunned his limousine north toward Kalorama Heights. The explosion inKatherine’s lab had been bigger than he had anticipated, and he had been luckyto escape unscathed. Conveniently, the ensuing chaos had enabled him to slip outwithout opposition, powering his limousine past a distracted gate guard who wasbusy yelling into a telephone.I’ve got to get off the road, he thought. If Katherine hadn’t yet phoned thepolice, the explosion would certainly draw their attention. And a shirtless mandriving a limousine would be hard to miss.After years of preparation, Mal’akh could scarcely believe the night was nowupon him. The journey to this moment had been a long, difficult one. What beganyears ago in misery . . . will end tonight in glory.On the night it all began, he had not had the name Mal’akh. In fact, on thenight it all began, he had not had any name at all. Inmate 37. Like most of theprisoners at the brutal Soganlik Prison outside of Istanbul, Inmate 37 was herebecause of drugs.He had been lying on his bunk in a cement cell, hungry and cold in the darkness,wondering how long he would be incarcerated. His new cellmate, whom he’d metonly twenty-four hours ago, was sleeping in the bunk above him. The prisonadministrator, an obese alcoholic who hated his job and took it out on theinmates, had just killed all the lights for the night.It was almost ten o’clock when Inmate 37 heard the conversation filtering inthrough the ventilation shaft. The first voice was unmistakably clear—thepiercing, belligerent accent of the prison administrator, who clearly did notappreciate being woken up by a late-night visitor.“Yes, yes, you’ve come a long way,” he was saying, “but there are no visitorsfor the first month. State regulations. No exceptions.”The voice that replied was soft and refined, filled with pain. “Is my son safe?”“He is a drug addict.”“Is he being treated well?”“Well enough,” the administrator said. “This is not a hotel.”There was a pained pause. “You do realize the U.S. State Department will requestextradition.”“Yes, yes, they always do. It will be granted, although the paperwork might takeus a couple of weeks . . . or even a month . . . depending.”“Depending on what?”“Well,” the administrator said, “we are understaffed.” He paused. “Of course,sometimes concerned parties like yourself make donations to the prison staff tohelp us push things through more quickly.”The visitor did not reply.“Mr. Solomon,” the administrator continued, lowering his voice, “for a man likeyourself, for whom money is no object, there are always options. I know peoplein government. If you and I work together, we may be able to get your son out ofhere . . . tomorrow, with all the charges dropped. He would not even have toface prosecution at home.”The response was immediate. “Forgetting the legal ramifications of yoursuggestion, I refuse to teach my son that money solves all problems or thatthere is no accountability in life, especially in a serious matter like this.”“You’d like to leave him here?”“I’d like to speak to him. Right now.”“As I said, we have rules. Your son is unavailable to you . . . unless you wouldlike to negotiate his immediate release.”A cold silence hung for several moments. “The State Department will becontacting you. Keep Zachary safe. I expect him on a plane home within the week.Good night.”The door slammed.Inmate 37 could not believe his ears. What kind of father leaves his son in thishellhole in order to teach him a lesson? Peter Solomon had even rejected anoffer to clear Zachary’s record.It was later that night, lying awake in his bunk, that Inmate 37 had realizedhow he would free himself. If money was the only thing separating a prisonerfrom freedom, then Inmate 37 was as good as free. Peter Solomon might not bewilling to part with money, but as anyone who read the tabloids knew, his son,Zachary, had plenty of money, too. The next day, Inmate 37 spoke privately tothe administrator and suggested a plan—a bold, ingenious scheme that would givethem both exactly what they wanted.“Zachary Solomon would have to die for this to work,” explained Inmate 37. “Butwe could both disappear immediately. You could retire to the Greek Islands. Youwould never see this place again.”After some discussion, the two men shook hands. Soon Zachary Solomon will bedead, Inmate 37 thought, smiling to think how easy it would be.It was two days later that the State Department contacted the Solomon familywith the horrific news. The prison snapshots showed their son’s brutallybludgeoned body, lying curled and lifeless on the floor of his prison cell. Hishead had been bashed in by a steel bar, and the rest of him was battered andtwisted beyond what was humanly imaginable. He appeared to have been torturedand finally killed. The prime suspect was the prison administrator himself, whohad disappeared, probably with all of the murdered boy’s money. Zachary hadsigned papers moving his vast fortune into a private numbered account, which hadbeen emptied immediately following his death. There was no telling where themoney was now.Peter Solomon flew to Turkey on a private jet and returned with their son’scasket, which they buried in the Solomon family cemetery. The prisonadministrator was never found. Nor would he be, Inmate 37 knew. The Turk’srotund body was now resting at the bottom of the Sea of Marmara, feeding theblue manna crabs that migrated in through the Bosporus Strait. The vast fortunebelonging to Zachary Solomon had all been moved to an untraceable numberedaccount. Inmate 37 was a free man again—a free man with a massive fortune.The Greek Islands were like heaven. The light. The water. The women.There was nothing money couldn’t buy—new identities, new passports, new hope. Hechose a Greek name—Andros Dareios—Andros meaning “warrior,” and Dareios meaning“wealthy.” The dark nights in prison had frightened him, and Andros vowed neverto go back. He shaved off his shaggy hair and shunned the drug world entirely.He began life anew—exploring never-before-imagined sensual pleasures. Theserenity of sailing alone on the ink-blue Aegean Sea became his new herointrance; the sensuality of sucking moist arni souvlakia right off the skewerbecame his new Ecstasy; and the rush of cliff diving into the foam-filledravines of Mykonos became his new cocaine.I am reborn.Andros bought a sprawling villa on the island of Syros and settled in among thebella gente in the exclusive town of Possidonia. This new world was a communitynot only of wealth, but of culture and physical perfection. His neighbors tookgreat pride in their bodies and minds, and it was contagious. The newcomersuddenly found himself jogging on the beach, tanning his pale body, and readingbooks. Andros read Homer’s Odyssey, captivated by the images of powerful bronzemen doing battle on these islands. The next day, he began lifting weights, andwas amazed to see how quickly his chest and arms grew larger. Gradually, hebegan to feel women’s eyes on him, and the admiration was intoxicating. Helonged to grow stronger still. And he did. With the help of aggressive cycles ofsteroids intermixed with black-market growth hormones and endless hours ofweight lifting, Andros transformed himself into something he had never imaginedhe could be—a perfect male specimen. He grew in both height and musculature,developing flawless pectorals and massive, sinewy legs, which he kept perfectlytanned.Everyone was looking now.As Andros had been warned, the heavy steroids and hormones changed not only hisbody, but also his voice box, giving him an eerie, breathy whisper, which madehim feel more mysterious. The soft, enigmatic voice, combined with his new body,his wealth, and his refusal to speak about his mysterious past, served as catnipfor the women who met him. They gave themselves willingly, and he satisfied themall—from fashion models visiting his island on photo shoots, to nubile Americancollege girls on vacation, to the lonely wives of his neighbors, to theoccasional young man. They could not get enough.I am a masterpiece.As the years passed, however, Andros’s sexual adventures began to lose theirthrill. As did everything. The island’s sumptuous cuisine lost its taste, booksno longer held his interest, and even the dazzling sunsets from his villa lookeddull. How could this be? He was only in his midtwenties, and yet he felt old.What more is there to life? He had sculpted his body into a masterpiece; he hadeducated himself and nourished his mind with culture; he had made his home inparadise; and he had the love of anyone he desired.And yet, incredibly, he felt as empty as he had in that Turkish prison.What is it I am missing?The answer had come to him several months later. Andros was sitting alone in hisvilla, absently surfing channels in the middle of the night, when he stumbledacross a program about the secrets of Freemasonry. The show was poorly done,posing more questions than answers, and yet he found himself intrigued by theplethora of conspiracy theories surrounding the brotherhood. The narratordescribed legend after legend.Freemasons and the New World Order . . .The Great Masonic Seal of the United States . . .The P2 Masonic Lodge . . .The Lost Secret of Freemasonry . . .The Masonic Pyramid . . .Andros sat up, startled. Pyramid. The narrator began recounting the story of amysterious stone pyramid whose encrypted engraving promised to lead to lostwisdom and unfathomable power. The story, though seemingly implausible, sparkedin him a distant memory . . . a faint recollection from a much darker time.Andros remembered what Zachary Solomon had heard from his father about amysterious pyramid.Could it be? Andros strained to recall the details.When the show ended, he stepped out onto the balcony, letting the cool air clearhis mind. He remembered more now, and as it all came back, he began to sensethere might be some truth to this legend after all. And if so, then ZacharySolomon—although long dead—still had something to offer.What do I have to lose?Three weeks later, his timing carefully planned, Andros stood in the frigid coldoutside the conservatory of the Solomons’ Potomac estate. Through the glass, hecould see Peter Solomon chatting and laughing with his sister, Katherine. Itlooks like they’ve had no trouble forgetting Zachary, he thought.Before he pulled the ski mask over his face, Andros took a hit of cocaine, hisfirst in ages. He felt the familiar rush of fearlessness. He pulled out ahandgun, used an old key to unlock the door, and stepped inside. “Hello,Solomons.”Unfortunately, the night had not gone as Andros had planned. Rather thanobtaining the pyramid for which he had come, he found himself riddled with birdshot and fleeing across the snow-covered lawn toward the dense woods. To hissurprise, behind him, Peter Solomon was giving chase, pistol glinting in hishand. Andros dashed into the woods, running down a trail along the edge of adeep ravine. Far below, the sounds of a waterfall echoed up through the crispwinter air. He passed a stand of oak trees and rounded a corner to his left.Seconds later, he was skidding to a stop on the icy path, narrowly escapingdeath.My God!Only feet in front of him, the path ended, plunging straight down into an icyriver far below. The large boulder at the side of the path had been carved bythe unskilled hand of a child:image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_013_r1.jpg]On the far side of the ravine, the path continued on. So where’s the bridge?!The cocaine was no longer working. I’m trapped! Panicking now, Andros turned toflee back up the path, but he found himself facing Peter Solomon, who stoodbreathless before him, pistol in hand.Andros looked at the gun and took a step backward. The drop behind him was atleast fifty feet to an ice-covered river. The mist from the waterfall upstreambillowed around them, chilling him to the bone.“Zach’s bridge rotted out long ago,” Solomon said, panting. “He was the only onewho ever came down this far.” Solomon held the gun remarkably steady. “Why didyou kill my son?”“He was nothing,” Andros replied. “A drug addict. I did him a favor.”Solomon moved closer, gun aimed directly at Andros’s chest. “Perhaps I should doyou the same favor.” His tone was surprisingly fierce. “You bludgeoned my son todeath. How does a man do such a thing?”“Men do the unthinkable when pushed to the brink.”“You killed my son!”“No,” Andros replied, hotly now. “You killed your son. What kind of man leaveshis son in a prison when he has the option to get him out! You killed your son!Not me.”“You know nothing!” Solomon yelled, his voice filled with pain.You’re wrong, Andros thought. I know everything.Peter Solomon drew closer, only five yards away now, gun leveled. Andros’s chestwas burning, and he could tell he was bleeding badly. The warmth ran down overhis stomach. He looked over his shoulder at the drop. Impossible. He turned backto Solomon. “I know more about you than you think,” he whispered. “I know youare not the kind of man who kills in cold blood.”Solomon stepped closer, taking dead aim.“I’m warning you,” Andros said, “if you pull that trigger, I will haunt youforever.”“You already will.” And with that, Solomon fired.As he raced his black limousine back toward Kalorama Heights, the one who nowcalled himself Mal’akh reflected on the miraculous events that had delivered himfrom certain death atop that icy ravine. He had been transformed forever. Thegunshot had echoed only for an instant, and yet its effects had reverberatedacross decades. His body, once tanned and perfect, was now marred by scars fromthat night . . . scars he kept hidden beneath the tattooed symbols of his newidentity.I am Mal’akh.This was my destiny all along.He had walked through fire, been reduced to ashes, and then emerged again . . .transformed once more. Tonight would be the final step of his long andmagnificent journey."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 58The coyly nicknamed explosive Key4 had been developed by Special Forcesspecifically for opening locked doors with minimal collateral damage. Consistingprimarily of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine with a diethylhexyl plasticizer, itwas essentially a piece of C-4 rolled into paper-thin sheets for insertion intodoorjambs. In the case of the library’s reading room, the explosive had workedperfectly.Operation leader Agent Turner Simkins stepped over the wreckage of the doors andscanned the massive octagonal room for any signs of movement. Nothing.“Kill the lights,” Simkins said.A second agent found the wall panel, threw the switches, and plunged the roominto darkness. In unison, all four men reached up and yanked down theirnight-vision headgear, adjusting the goggles over their eyes. They stoodmotionless, surveying the reading room, which now materialized in shades ofluminescent green inside their goggles.The scene remained unchanged.Nobody made a dash for it in the dark.The fugitives were probably unarmed, and yet the field team entered the roomwith weapons raised. In the darkness, their firearms projected four menacingrods of laser light. The men washed the beams in all directions, across thefloor, up the far walls, into the balconies, probing the darkness. Oftentimes, amere glimpse of a laser-sighted weapon in a darkened room was enough to induceinstant surrender.Apparently not tonight.Still no movement.Agent Simkins raised his hand, motioning his team into the space. Silently, themen fanned out. Moving cautiously up the center aisle, Simkins reached up andflipped a switch on his goggles, activating the newest addition to the CIA’sarsenal. Thermal imaging had been around for years, but recent advances inminiaturization, differential sensitivity, and dual-source integration hadfacilitated a new generation of vision enhancing equipment that gave fieldagents eyesight that bordered on superhuman.We see in the dark. We see through walls. And now . . . we see back in time.Thermal-imaging equipment had become so sensitive to heat differentials that itcould detect not only a person’s location . . . but their previous locations.The ability to see into the past often proved the most valuable asset of all.And tonight, once again, it proved its worth. Agent Simkins now spied a thermalsignature at one of the reading desks. The two wooden chairs luminesced in hisgoggles, registering a reddish-purple color, indicating those chairs were warmerthan the other chairs in the room. The desk lamp’s bulb glowed orange. Obviouslythe two men had been sitting at the desk, but the question now was in whichdirection they had gone.He found his answer on the central counter that surrounded the large woodenconsole in the middle of the room. A ghostly handprint, glowing crimson.Weapon raised, Simkins moved toward the octagonal cabinet, training his lasersight across the surface. He circled until he saw an opening in the side of theconsole. Did they really corner themselves in a cabinet? The agent scanned thetrim around the opening and saw another glowing handprint on it. Clearly someonehad grabbed the doorjamb as he ducked inside the console.The time for silence was over.“Thermal signature!” Simkins shouted, pointing at the opening. “Flanksconverge!”His two flanks moved in from opposite sides, effectively surrounding theoctagonal console.Simkins moved toward the opening. Still ten feet away, he could see a lightsource within. “Light inside the console!” he shouted, hoping the sound of hisvoice might convince Mr. Bellamy and Mr. Langdon to exit the cabinet with theirhands up.Nothing happened.Fine, we’ll do this the other way.As Simkins drew closer to the opening, he could hear an unexpected hum rumblingfrom within. It sounded like machinery. He paused, trying to imagine what couldbe making such a noise in such a small space. He inched closer, now hearingvoices over the sound of machinery. Then, just as he arrived at the opening, thelights inside went out.Thank you, he thought, adjusting his night vision. Advantage, us.Standing at the threshold, he peered through the opening. What lay beyond wasunexpected. The console was less of a cabinet than a raised ceiling over a steepset of stairs that descended into a room below. The agent aimed his weapon downthe stairs and began descending. The hum of machinery grew louder with everystep.What the hell is this place?The room beneath the reading room was a small, industrial-looking space. The humhe heard was indeed machinery, although he was not sure whether it was runningbecause Bellamy and Langdon had activated it, or because it ran around theclock. Either way, it clearly made no difference. The fugitives had left theirtelltale heat signatures on the room’s lone exit—a heavy steel door whose keypadshowed four clear fingerprints glowing on the numbers. Around the door, sliversof glowing orange shone beneath the doorjamb, indicating that lights wereilluminated on the other side.“Blow the door,” Simkins said. “This was their escape route.”It took eight seconds to insert and detonate a sheet of Key4. When the smokecleared, the field-team agents found themselves peering into a strangeunderground world known here as “the stacks.”The Library of Congress had miles and miles of bookshelves, most of themunderground. The endless rows of shelves looked like some kind of “infinity”optical illusion created with mirrors.A sign announcedTEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTKeep this door closed at all times.Simkins pushed through the mangled doors and felt cool air beyond. He couldn’thelp but smile. Could this get any easier? Heat signatures in controlledenvironments showed up like solar flares, and already his goggles revealed aglowing red smear on a banister up ahead, which Bellamy or Langdon had grabbedon to while running past.“You can run,” he whispered to himself, “but you can’t hide.”As Simkins and his team advanced into the maze of stacks, he realized theplaying field was tipped so heavily in his favor that he would not even need hisgoggles to track his prey. Under normal circumstances, this maze of stacks wouldhave been a respectable hiding place, but the Library of Congress usedmotion-activated lights to save energy, and the fugitives’ escape route was nowlit up like a runway. A narrow strip of illumination stretched into thedistance, dodging and weaving as it went.All the men ripped off their goggles. Surging ahead on well-trained legs, thefield team followed the trail of lights, zigging and zagging through a seeminglyendless labyrinth of books. Soon Simkins began seeing lights flickering on inthe darkness up ahead. We’re gaining. He pushed harder, faster, until he heardfootsteps and labored breathing ahead. Then he saw a target.“I’ve got visual!” he yelled.The lanky form of Warren Bellamy was apparently bringing up the rear. The primlydressed African American staggered through the stacks, obviously out of breath.It’s no use, old man.“Stop right there, Mr. Bellamy!” Simkins yelled.Bellamy kept running, turning sharp corners, weaving through the rows of books.At every turn, the lights kept coming on over his head.As the team drew within twenty yards, they shouted again to stop, but Bellamyran on.“Take him down!” Simkins commanded.The agent carrying the team’s nonlethal rifle raised it and fired. Theprojectile that launched down the aisle and wrapped itself around Bellamy’s legswas nicknamed Silly String, but there was nothing silly about it. A militarytechnology invented at Sandia National Laboratories, this nonlethal“incapacitant” was a thread of gooey polyurethane that turned rock hard oncontact, creating a rigid web of plastic across the back of the fugitive’sknees. The effect on a running target was that of jamming a stick into thespokes of a moving bike. The man’s legs seized midstride, and he pitchedforward, crashing to the floor. Bellamy slid another ten feet down a darkenedaisle before coming to a stop, the lights above him flickering unceremoniouslyto life.“I’ll deal with Bellamy,” Simkins shouted. “You keep going after Langdon! Hemust be up ahead some—” The team leader stopped, now seeing that the librarystacks ahead of Bellamy were all pitch-black. Obviously, there was no one elserunning in front of Bellamy. He’s alone?Bellamy was still on his chest, breathing heavily, his legs and ankles alltangled with hardened plastic. The agent walked over and used his foot to rollthe old man over onto his back.“Where is he?!” the agent demanded.Bellamy’s lip was bleeding from the fall. “Where is who?”Agent Simkins lifted his foot and placed his boot squarely on Bellamy’s pristinesilk tie. Then he leaned in, applying some pressure. “Believe me, Mr. Bellamy,you do not want to play this game with me.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 59Robert Langdon felt like a corpse.He lay supine, hands folded on his chest, in total darkness, trapped in the mostconfined of spaces. Although Katherine lay nearby in a similar position near hishead, Langdon could not see her. He had his eyes closed to prevent himself fromcatching even a fleeting glimpse of his frightening predicament.The space around him was small.Very small.Sixty seconds ago, with the double doors of the reading room crashing down, heand Katherine had followed Bellamy into the octagonal console, down a steep setof stairs, and into the unexpected space below.Langdon had realized at once where they were. The heart of the library’scirculation system. Resembling a small airport baggage distribution center, thecirculation room had numerous conveyor belts that angled off in differentdirections. Because the Library of Congress was housed in three separatebuildings, books requested in the reading room often had to be transported greatdistances by a system of conveyors through a web of underground tunnels.Bellamy immediately crossed the room to a steel door, where he inserted his keycard, typed a sequence of buttons, and pushed open the door. The space beyondwas dark, but as the door opened, a span of motion-sensor lights flickered tolife.When Langdon saw what lay beyond, he realized he was looking at something fewpeople ever saw. The Library of Congress stacks. He felt encouraged by Bellamy’splan. What better place to hide than in a giant labyrinth?Bellamy did not guide them into the stacks, however. Instead, he propped thedoor open with a book and turned back to face them. “I had hoped to be able toexplain a lot more to you, but we have no time.” He gave Langdon his key card.“You’ll need this.”“You’re not coming with us?” Langdon asked.Bellamy shook his head. “You’ll never make it unless we split up. The mostimportant thing is to keep that pyramid and capstone in safe hands.”Langdon saw no other way out except the stairs back up to the reading room. “Andwhere are you going?”“I’ll coax them into the stacks away from you,” Bellamy said. “It’s all I can doto help you escape.”Before Langdon could ask where he and Katherine were supposed to go, Bellamy washeaving a large crate of books off one of the conveyors. “Lie on the belt,”Bellamy said. “Keep your hands in.”Langdon stared. You cannot be serious! The conveyor belt extended a shortdistance then disappeared into a dark hole in the wall. The opening looked largeenough to permit passage of a crate of books, but not much more. Langdon glancedback longingly at the stacks.“Forget it,” Bellamy said. “The motion-sensor lights will make it impossible tohide.”“Thermal signature!” a voice upstairs shouted. “Flanks converge!”Katherine apparently had heard all she needed to hear. She climbed onto theconveyor belt with her head only a few feet from the opening in the wall. Shecrossed her hands over her chest like a mummy in a sarcophagus.Langdon stood frozen.“Robert,” Bellamy urged, “if you won’t do this for me, do it for Peter.”The voices upstairs sounded closer now.As if in a dream, Langdon moved to the conveyor. He slung his daybag onto thebelt and then climbed on, placing his head at Katherine’s feet. The hard rubberconveyor felt cold against his back. He stared at the ceiling and felt like ahospital patient preparing for insertion headfirst into an MRI machine.“Keep your phone on,” Bellamy said. “Someone will call soon . . . and offerhelp. Trust him.”Someone will call? Langdon knew that Bellamy had been trying to reach someonewith no luck and had left a message earlier. And only moments ago, as theyhurried down the spiral staircase, Bellamy had tried one last time and gottenthrough, speaking very briefly in hushed tones and then hanging up.“Follow the conveyor to the end,” Bellamy said. “And jump off quickly before youcircle back. Use my key card to get out.”“Get out of where?!” Langdon demanded.But Bellamy was already pulling levers. All the different conveyors in the roomhummed to life. Langdon felt himself jolt into motion, and the ceiling beganmoving overhead.God save me.As Langdon approached the opening in the wall, he looked back and saw WarrenBellamy race through the doorway into the stacks, closing the door behind him.An instant later, Langdon slid into the darkness, swallowed up by the library .. . just as a glowing red laser dot came dancing down the stairs."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 60The underpaid female security guard from Preferred Security double-checked theKalorama Heights address on her call sheet. This is it? The gated drivewaybefore her belonged to one of the neighborhood’s largest and quietest estates,and so it seemed odd that 911 had just received an urgent call about it.As usual with unconfirmed call-ins, 911 had contacted the local alarm companybefore bothering the police. The guard often thought the alarm company’smotto—“Your first line of defense”—could just as easily have been “False alarms,pranks, lost pets, and complaints from wacky neighbors.”Tonight, as usual, the guard had arrived with no details about the specificconcern. Above my pay grade. Her job was simply to show up with her yellowbubble light spinning, assess the property, and report anything unusual.Normally, something innocuous had tripped the house alarm, and she would use heroverride keys to reset it. This house, however, was silent. No alarm. From theroad, everything looked dark and peaceful.The guard buzzed the intercom at the gate, but got no answer. She typed heroverride code to open the gate and pulled into the driveway. Leaving her enginerunning and her bubble light spinning, she walked up to the front door and rangthe bell. No answer. She saw no lights and no movement.Reluctantly following procedure, she flicked on her flashlight to begin her trekaround the house to check the doors and windows for signs of break-in. As sherounded the corner, a black stretch limousine drove past the house, slowing fora moment before continuing on. Rubbernecking neighbors.Bit by bit, she made her way around the house, but saw nothing out of place. Thehouse was bigger than she had imagined, and by the time she reached thebackyard, she was shivering from the cold. Obviously there was nobody home.“Dispatch?” she called in on her radio. “I’m on the Kalorama Heights call?Owners aren’t home. No signs of trouble. Finished the perimeter check. Noindication of an intruder. False alarm.”“Roger that,” the dispatcher replied. “Have a good night.”The guard put her radio back on her belt and began retracing her steps, eager toget back to the warmth of her vehicle. As she did so, however, she spottedsomething she had missed earlier—a tiny speck of bluish light on the back of thehouse.Puzzled, she walked over to it, now seeing the source—a low transom window,apparently to the home’s basement. The glass of the window had been blacked out,coated on the inside with an opaque paint. Some kind of darkroom maybe? Thebluish glow she had seen was emanating through a tiny spot on the window wherethe black paint had started to peel.She crouched down, trying to peer through, but she couldn’t see much through thetiny opening. She tapped on the glass, wondering if maybe someone was workingdown there.“Hello?” she shouted.There was no answer, but as she knocked on the window, the paint chip suddenlydetached and fell off, affording her a more complete view. She leaned in, nearlypressing her face to the window as she scanned the basement. Instantly, shewished she hadn’t.What in the name of God?!Transfixed, she remained crouched there for a moment, staring in abject horrorat the scene before her. Finally, trembling, the guard groped for the radio onher belt.She never found it.A sizzling pair of Taser prongs slammed into the back of her neck, and a searingpain shot through her body. Her muscles seized, and she pitched forward, unableeven to close her eyes before her face hit the cold ground."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 61Tonight was not the first time Warren Bellamy had been blindfolded. Like all ofhis Masonic brothers, he had worn the ritual “hoodwink” during his ascent to theupper echelons of Masonry. That, however, had taken place among trusted friends.Tonight was different. These rough-handed men had bound him, placed a bag on hishead, and were now marching him through the library stacks.The agents had physically threatened Bellamy and demanded to know thewhereabouts of Robert Langdon. Knowing his aging body couldn’t take muchpunishment, Bellamy had told his lie quickly.“Langdon never came down here with me!” he had said, gasping for air. “I toldhim to go up to the balcony and hide behind the Moses statue, but I don’t knowwhere he is now!” The story apparently had been convincing, because two of theagents had run off in pursuit. Now the remaining two agents were marching him insilence through the stacks.Bellamy’s only solace was in knowing Langdon and Katherine were whisking thepyramid off to safety. Soon Langdon would be contacted by a man who could offersanctuary. Trust him. The man Bellamy had called knew a great deal about theMasonic Pyramid and the secret it held—the location of a hidden spiral staircasethat led down into the earth to the hiding place of potent ancient wisdom buriedlong ago. Bellamy had finally gotten through to the man as they were escapingthe reading room, and he felt confident that his short message would beunderstood perfectly.Now, as he moved in total darkness, Bellamy pictured the stone pyramid andgolden capstone in Langdon’s bag. It has been many years since those two pieceswere in the same room.Bellamy would never forget that painful night. The first of many for Peter.Bellamy had been asked to come to the Solomon estate in Potomac for ZacharySolomon’s eighteenth birthday. Zachary, despite being a rebellious child, was aSolomon, which meant tonight, following family tradition, he would receive hisinheritance. Bellamy was one of Peter’s dearest friends and a trusted Masonicbrother, and therefore was asked to attend as a witness. But it was not only thetransference of money that Bellamy had been asked to witness. There was far morethan money at stake tonight.Bellamy had arrived early and waited, as requested, in Peter’s private study.The wonderful old room smelled of leather, wood fires, and loose-leaf tea.Warren was seated when Peter led his son, Zachary, into the room. When thescrawny eighteen-year-old saw Bellamy, he frowned. “What are you doing here?”“Bearing witness,” Bellamy offered. “Happy birthday, Zachary.”The boy mumbled and looked away.“Sit down, Zach,” Peter said.Zachary sat in the solitary chair facing his father’s huge wooden desk. Solomonbolted the study door. Bellamy took a seat off to one side.Solomon addressed Zachary in a serious tone. “Do you know why you’re here?”“I think so,” Zachary said.Solomon sighed deeply. “I know you and I have not seen eye to eye for quite sometime, Zach. I’ve done my best to be a good father and to prepare you for thismoment.”Zachary said nothing.“As you know, every Solomon child, upon reaching adulthood, is presented withhis or her birthright—a share of the Solomon fortune—which is intended to be aseed . . . a seed for you to nurture, make grow, and use to help nourishmankind.”Solomon walked to a vault in the wall, unlocked it, and removed a large blackfolder. “Son, this portfolio contains everything you need to legally transferyour financial inheritance into your own name.” He laid it on the desk. “The aimis that you use this money to build a life of productivity, prosperity, andphilanthropy.”Zachary reached for the folder. “Thanks.”“Hold on,” his father said, putting his hand on the portfolio. “There’ssomething else I need to explain.”Zachary shot his father a contemptuous look and slumped back down.“There are aspects of the Solomon inheritance of which you are not yet aware.”His father was staring straight into Zachary’s eyes now. “You are my firstborn,Zachary, which means you are entitled to a choice.”The teenager sat up, looking intrigued.“It is a choice that may well determine the direction of your future, and so Iurge you to ponder it carefully.”“What choice?”His father took a deep breath. “It is the choice . . . between wealth orwisdom.”Zachary gave him a blank stare. “Wealth or wisdom? I don’t get it.”Solomon stood, walking again to the vault, where he pulled out a heavy stonepyramid with Masonic symbols carved into it. Peter heaved the stone onto thedesk beside the portfolio. “This pyramid was created long ago and has beenentrusted to our family for generations.”“A pyramid?” Zachary didn’t look very excited.“Son, this pyramid is a map . . . a map that reveals the location of one ofhumankind’s greatest lost treasures. This map was created so that the treasurecould one day be rediscovered.” Peter’s voice swelled now with pride. “Andtonight, following tradition, I am able to offer it to you . . . under certainconditions.”Zachary eyed the pyramid suspiciously. “What’s the treasure?”Bellamy could tell that this coarse question was not what Peter had hoped for.Nonetheless, his demeanor remained steady.“Zachary, it’s hard to explain without a lot of background. But this treasure .. . in essence . . . is something we call the Ancient Mysteries.”Zachary laughed, apparently thinking his father was joking.Bellamy could see the melancholy growing now in Peter’s eyes.“This is very difficult for me to describe, Zach. Traditionally, by the time aSolomon is eighteen years of age, he is about to embark on his years of highereducation in—”“I told you!” Zachary fired back. “I’m not interested in college!”“I don’t mean college,” his father said, his voice still calm and quiet. “I’mtalking about the brotherhood of Freemasonry. I’m talking about an education inthe enduring mysteries of human science. If you had plans to join me withintheir ranks, you would be on the verge of receiving the education necessary tounderstand the importance of your decision tonight.”Zachary rolled his eyes. “Spare me the Masonic lecture again. I know I’m thefirst Solomon who doesn’t want to join. But so what? Don’t you get it? I have nointerest in playing dress-up with a bunch of old men!”His father was silent for a long time, and Bellamy noticed the fine age linesthat had started to appear around Peter’s still-youthful eyes.“Yes, I get it,” Peter finally said. “Times are different now. I understand thatMasonry probably appears strange to you, or maybe even boring. But I want you toknow, that doorway will always be open for you should you change your mind.”“Don’t hold your breath,” Zach grumbled.“That’s enough!” Peter snapped, standing up. “I realize life has been a strugglefor you, Zachary, but I am not your only guidepost. There are good men waitingfor you, men who will welcome you within the Masonic fold and show you your truepotential.”Zachary chuckled and glanced over at Bellamy. “Is that why you’re here, Mr.Bellamy? So you Masons can gang up on me?”Bellamy said nothing, instead directing a respectful gaze back at PeterSolomon—a reminder to Zachary of who held the power in this room.Zachary turned back to his father.“Zach,” Peter said, “we’re getting nowhere . . . so let me just tell you this.Whether or not you comprehend the responsibility being offered to you tonight,it is my family obligation to present it.” He motioned to the pyramid. “It is arare privilege to guard this pyramid. I urge you to consider this opportunityfor a few days before making your decision.”“Opportunity?” Zachary said. “Babysitting a rock?”“There are great mysteries in this world, Zach,” Peter said with a sigh.“Secrets that transcend your wildest imagination. This pyramid protects thosesecrets. And even more important, there will come a time, probably within yourlifetime, when this pyramid will at last be deciphered and its secretsunearthed. It will be a moment of great human transformation . . . and you havea chance to play a role in that moment. I want you to consider it verycarefully. Wealth is commonplace, but wisdom is rare.” He motioned to theportfolio and then to the pyramid. “I beg you to remember that wealth withoutwisdom can often end in disaster.”Zachary looked like he thought his father was insane. “Whatever you say, Dad,but there’s no way I’m giving up my inheritance for this.” He gestured to thepyramid.Peter folded his hands before him. “If you choose to accept the responsibility,I will hold your money and the pyramid for you until you have successfullycompleted your education within the Masons. This will take years, but you willemerge with the maturity to receive both your money and this pyramid. Wealth andwisdom. A potent combination.”Zachary shot up. “Jesus, Dad! You don’t give up, do you? Can’t you see that Idon’t give a damn about the Masons or stone pyramids and ancient mysteries?” Hereached down and scooped up the black portfolio, waving it in front of hisfather’s face. “This is my birthright! The same birthright of the Solomons whocame before me! I can’t believe you’d try to trick me out of my inheritance withlame stories about ancient treasure maps!” He tucked the portfolio under his armand marched past Bellamy to the study’s patio door.“Zachary, wait!” His father rushed after him as Zachary stalked out into thenight. “Whatever you do, you can never speak of the pyramid you have seen!”Peter Solomon’s voice cracked. “Not to anyone! Ever!”But Zachary ignored him, disappearing into the night.Peter Solomon’s gray eyes were filled with pain as he returned to his desk andsat heavily in his leather chair. After a long silence, he looked up at Bellamyand forced a sad smile. “That went well.”Bellamy sighed, sharing in Solomon’s pain. “Peter, I don’t mean to soundinsensitive . . . but . . . do you trust him?”Solomon stared blankly into space.“I mean . . .” Bellamy pressed, “not to say anything about the pyramid?”Solomon’s face was blank. “I really don’t know what to say, Warren. I’m not sureI even know him anymore.”Bellamy rose and walked slowly back and forth before the large desk. “Peter, youhave followed your family duty, but now, considering what just happened, I thinkwe need to take precautions. I should return the capstone to you so you can finda new home for it. Someone else should watch over it.”“Why?” Solomon asked.“If Zachary tells anyone about the pyramid . . . and mentions my being presenttonight . . .”“He knows nothing of the capstone, and he’s too immature to know the pyramid hasany significance. We don’t need a new home for it. I’ll keep the pyramid in myvault. And you will keep the capstone wherever you keep it. As we always have.”It was six years later, on Christmas Day, with the family still healing fromZachary’s death, that the enormous man claiming to have killed him in prisonbroke into the Solomon estate. The intruder had come for the pyramid, but he hadtaken with him only Isabel Solomon’s life.Days later, Peter summoned Bellamy to his office. He locked the door and tookthe pyramid out of his vault, setting it on the desk between them. “I shouldhave listened to you.”Bellamy knew Peter was racked with guilt over this. “It wouldn’t have mattered.”Solomon drew a tired breath. “Did you bring the capstone?”Bellamy pulled a small cube-shaped package from his pocket. The faded brownpaper was tied with twine and bore a wax seal of Solomon’s ring. Bellamy laidthe package on the desk, knowing the two halves of the Masonic Pyramid werecloser together tonight than they should be. “Find someone else to watch this.Don’t tell me who it is.”Solomon nodded.“And I know where you can hide the pyramid,” Bellamy said. He told Solomon aboutthe Capitol Building subbasement. “There’s no place in Washington more secure.”Bellamy recalled Solomon liking the idea right away because it felt symbolicallyapt to hide the pyramid in the symbolic heart of our nation. Typical Solomon,Bellamy had thought. The idealist even in a crisis.Now, ten years later, as Bellamy was being shoved blindly through the Library ofCongress, he knew the crisis tonight was far from over. He also now knew whomSolomon had chosen to guard the capstone . . . and he prayed to God that RobertLangdon was up to the job."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 62I’m under Second Street.Langdon’s eyes remained tightly shut as the conveyor rumbled through thedarkness toward the Adams Building. He did his best not to picture the tons ofearth overhead and the narrow tube through which he was now traveling. He couldhear Katherine breathing several yards ahead of him, but so far, she had notuttered a word.She’s in shock. Langdon was not looking forward to telling her about herbrother’s severed hand. You have to, Robert. She needs to know.“Katherine?” Langdon finally said, without opening his eyes. “Are you okay?”A tremulous, disembodied voice replied somewhere up ahead. “Robert, the pyramidyou’re carrying. It’s Peter’s, isn’t it?”“Yes,” Langdon replied.A long silence followed. “I think . . . that pyramid is why my mother wasmurdered.”Langdon was well aware that Isabel Solomon had been murdered ten years ago, buthe didn’t know the details, and Peter had never mentioned anything about apyramid. “What are you talking about?”Katherine’s voice filled with emotion as she recounted the harrowing events ofthat night, how the tattooed man had broken into their estate. “It was a longtime ago, but I’ll never forget that he demanded a pyramid. He said he heardabout the pyramid in prison, from my nephew, Zachary . . . right before hekilled him.”Langdon listened in amazement. The tragedy within the Solomon family was almostbeyond belief. Katherine continued, telling Langdon that she had always believedthe intruder was killed that night . . . that is, until this same man hadresurfaced today, posing as Peter’s psychiatrist and luring Katherine to hishome. “He knew private things about my brother, my mother’s death, and even mywork,” she said anxiously, “things he could only have learned from my brother.And so I trusted him . . . and that’s how he got inside the Smithsonian MuseumSupport Center.” Katherine took a deep breath and told Langdon she was nearlycertain the man had destroyed her lab tonight.Langdon listened in utter shock. For several moments, the two of them laytogether in silence on the moving conveyor. Langdon knew he had an obligation toshare with Katherine the rest of tonight’s terrible news. He began slowly, andas gently as he possibly could he told her how her brother had entrusted himwith a small package years earlier, how Langdon had been tricked into bringingthis package to Washington tonight, and finally, about her brother’s hand havingbeen found in the Rotunda of the Capitol Building.Katherine’s reaction was deafening silence.Langdon could tell she was reeling, and he wished he could reach out and comforther, but lying end to end in the narrow blackness made it impossible. “Peter’sokay,” he whispered. “He’s alive, and we’ll get him back.” Langdon tried to giveher hope. “Katherine, his captor promised me your brother would be returnedalive . . . as long as I decipher the pyramid for him.”Still Katherine said nothing.Langdon kept talking. He told her about the stone pyramid, its Masonic cipher,the sealed capstone, and, of course, about Bellamy’s claims that this pyramidwas in fact the Masonic Pyramid of legend . . . a map that revealed the hidingplace of a long spiral staircase that led deep into the earth . . . downhundreds of feet to a mystical ancient treasure that had been buried inWashington long ago.Katherine finally spoke, but her voice was flat and emotionless. “Robert, openyour eyes.”Open my eyes? Langdon had no desire to have even the slightest glimpse of howcramped this space really was.“Robert!” Katherine demanded, urgently now. “Open your eyes! We’re here!”Langdon’s eyes flew open as his body emerged through an opening similar to theone it had entered at the other end. Katherine was already climbing off theconveyor belt. She lifted his daybag off the belt as Langdon swung his legs overthe edge and jumped down onto the tile floor just in time, before the conveyorturned the corner and headed back the way it came. The space around them was acirculation room much like the one they had come from in the other building. Asmall sign read ADAMS BUILDING: CIRCULATION ROOM 3.Langdon felt like he had just emerged from some kind of subterranean birthcanal. Born again. He turned immediately to Katherine. “Are you okay?”Her eyes were red, and she had obviously been crying, but she nodded with aresolute stoicism. She picked up Langdon’s daybag and carried it across the roomwithout a word, setting it on a cluttered desk. She lit the desk’s halogen clamplamp, unzipped the bag, folded down the sides, and peered inside.The granite pyramid looked almost austere in the clean halogen light. Katherineran her fingers over the engraved Masonic cipher, and Langdon sensed deepemotion churning within her. Slowly, she reached into the daybag and pulled outthe cube-shaped package. She held it under the light, examining it closely.“As you can see,” Langdon quietly said, “the wax seal is embossed with Peter’sMasonic ring. He said this ring was used to seal the package more than a centuryago.”Katherine said nothing.“When your brother entrusted the package to me,” Langdon told her, “he said itwould give me the power to create order out of chaos. I’m not entirely sure whatthat means, but I’ve got to assume the capstone reveals something important,because Peter was insistent that it not fall into the wrong hands. Mr. Bellamyjust told me the same thing, urging me to hide the pyramid and not let anyoneopen the package.”Katherine turned now, looking angry. “Bellamy told you not to open the package?”“Yes. He was adamant.”Katherine looked incredulous. “But you said this capstone is the only way we candecipher the pyramid, right?”“Probably, yes.”Katherine’s voice was rising now. “And you said deciphering the pyramid is whatyou were told to do. It’s the only way we can get Peter back, right?”Langdon nodded.“Then, Robert, why wouldn’t we open the package and decipher this thing rightnow?!”Langdon didn’t know how to respond. “Katherine, I had the same exact reaction,and yet Bellamy told me that keeping this pyramid’s secret intact was moreimportant than anything . . . including your brother’s life.”Katherine’s pretty features hardened, and she tucked a wisp of hair behind herears. When she spoke, her voice was resolved. “This stone pyramid, whatever itis, has cost me my entire family. First my nephew, Zachary, then my mother, andnow my brother.And let’s face it, Robert, if you hadn’t called tonight to warnme . . .”Langdon could feel himself trapped between Katherine’s logic and Bellamy’ssteadfast urging.“I may be a scientist,” she said, “but I also come from a family of well-knownMasons. Believe me, I’ve heard all the stories about the Masonic Pyramid and itspromise of some great treasure that will enlighten mankind. Honestly, I find ithard to imagine such a thing exists. However, if it does exist . . . perhapsit’s time to unveil it.” Katherine slid a finger beneath the old twine on thepackage.Langdon jumped. “Katherine, no! Wait!”She paused, but her finger remained beneath the string. “Robert, I’m not goingto let my brother die for this. Whatever this capstone says . . . whatever losttreasures this engraving might reveal . . . those secrets end tonight.”With that, Katherine yanked defiantly on the twine, and the brittle wax sealexploded."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 63In a quiet neighborhood just west of Embassy Row in Washington, there exists amedieval-style walled garden whose roses, it is said, spring fromtwelfth-century plants. The garden’s Carderock gazebo—known as Shadow House—sitselegantly amid meandering pathways of stones dug from George Washington’sprivate quarry.Tonight the silence of the gardens was broken by a young man who rushed throughthe wooden gate, shouting as he came.“Hello?” he called out, straining to see in the moonlight. “Are you in here?”The voice that replied was frail, barely audible. “In the gazebo . . . justtaking some air.”The young man found his withered superior seated on the stone bench beneath ablanket. The hunched old man was tiny, with elfin features. The years had benthim in two and stolen his eyesight, but his soul remained a force to be reckonedwith.Catching his breath, the young man told him, “I just . . . took a call . . .from your friend . . . Warren Bellamy.”“Oh?” The old man perked up. “About what?”“He didn’t say, but he sounded like he was in a big hurry. He told me he leftyou a message on your voice mail, which you need to listen to right away.”“That’s all he said?”“Not quite.” The young man paused. “He told me to ask you a question.” A verystrange question. “He said he needed your response right away.”The old man leaned closer. “What question?”As the young man spoke Mr. Bellamy’s question, the pall that crossed the oldman’s face was visible even in the moonlight. Immediately, he threw off hisblanket and began struggling to his feet.“Please help me inside. Right away.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 64No more secrets, thought Katherine Solomon.On the table in front of her, the wax seal that had been intact for generationsnow lay in pieces. She finished removing the faded brown paper from herbrother’s precious package. Beside her, Langdon looked decidedly uneasy.From within the paper, Katherine extracted a small box made of gray stone.Resembling a polished granite cube, the box had no hinges, no latch, and noapparent way inside. It reminded Katherine of a Chinese puzzle box.“It looks like a solid block,” she said, running her fingers over the edges.“Are you sure the X-ray showed it was hollow? With a capstone inside?”“It did,” Langdon said, moving next to Katherine and scrutinizing the mysteriousbox. He and Katherine peered at the box from different angles, attempting tofind a way in.“Got it,” Katherine said as her fingernail located the hidden slit along one ofthe box’s top edges. She set the box down on the desk and then carefully priedopen the lid, which rose smoothly, like the top of a fine jewelry box.When the lid fell back, Langdon and Katherine both drew audible breaths. Theinterior of the box seemed to be glowing. The inside was shining with an almostsupernatural effulgence. Katherine had never seen a piece of gold this large,and it took her an instant to realize that the precious metal was simplyreflecting the radiance of the desk lamp.“It’s spectacular,” she whispered. Despite being sealed in a dark stone cube forover a century, the capstone had not faded or tarnished in any way. Gold resiststhe entropic laws of decay; that’s one of the reasons the ancients considered itmagical. Katherine felt her pulse quicken as she leaned forward, peering downover the small golden point. “There’s an inscription.”Langdon moved closer, their shoulders now touching. His blue eyes flashed withcuriosity. He had told Katherine about the ancient Greek practice of creating asymbolon—a code broken into parts—and how this capstone, long separated from thepyramid itself, would hold the key to deciphering the pyramid. Allegedly, thisinscription, whatever it said, would bring order from this chaos.Katherine held the little box up to the light and peered straight down over thecapstone.Though small, the inscription was perfectly visible—a small bit of elegantlyengraved text on the face of one side. Katherine read the six simple words.Then she read them again.“No!” she declared. “That can’t be what it says!”Across the street, Director Sato hurried up the long walkway outside the CapitolBuilding toward her rendezvous point on First Street. The update from her fieldteam had been unacceptable. No Langdon. No pyramid. No capstone. Bellamy was incustody, but he was not telling them the truth. At least not yet.I’ll make him talk.She glanced back over her shoulder at one of Washington’s newest vistas—theCapitol Dome framed above the new visitor center. The illuminated dome onlyaccentuated the significance of what was truly at stake tonight. Dangeroustimes.Sato was relieved to hear her cell phone ring and see her analyst’s ID on thescreen.“Nola,” Sato answered. “What have you got?”Nola Kaye gave her the bad news. The X-ray of the capstone’s inscription was toofaint to read, and the image-enhancing filters had not helped. Shit. Sato chewedat her lip. “How about the sixteen-letter grid?”“I’m still trying,” Nola said, “but so far I’ve found no secondary encryptionscheme that’s applicable. I’ve got a computer reshuffling the letters in thegrid and looking for anything identifiable, but there are over twenty trillionpossibilities.”“Stay on it. Let me know.” Sato hung up, scowling. Her hopes of deciphering thepyramid using only a photograph and X-ray were fading fast. I need that pyramidand capstone . . . and I’m running out of time.Sato arrived at First Street just as a black Escalade SUV with dark windowsroared across the double yellow and skidded to a stop in front of her at theirrendezvous point. A lone agent got out.“Any word yet on Langdon?” Sato demanded.“Confidence is high,” the man said, emotionless. “Backup just arrived. Alllibrary exits are surrounded. We even have air support coming in. We’ll flushhim with tear gas, and he’ll have nowhere to run.”“And Bellamy?”“Tied up in the backseat.”Good. Her shoulder was still smarting.The agent handed Sato a plastic Ziploc bag containing cell phone, keys, andwallet. “Bellamy’s effects.”“Nothing else?”“No, ma’am. The pyramid and package must still be with Langdon.”“Okay,” Sato said. “Bellamy knows plenty he’s not telling. I’d like to questionhim personally.”“Yes, ma’am. To Langley, then?”Sato took a deep breath and paced a moment beside the SUV. Strict protocolsgoverned the interrogation of U.S. civilians, and questioning Bellamy was highlyillegal unless it was done at Langley on video with witnesses, attorneys, blah,blah, blah . . . “Not Langley,” she said, trying to think of somewhere closer.And more private.The agent said nothing, standing at attention beside the idling SUV, waiting fororders.Sato lit a cigarette, took a long drag, and gazed down at the Ziploc bag ofBellamy’s items. His key ring, she had noticed, included an electronic fobadorned with four letters—USBG. Sato knew, of course, which government buildingthis fob accessed. The building was very close and, at this hour, very private.She smiled and pocketed the fob. Perfect.When she told the agent where she wanted to take Bellamy, she expected the manto look surprised, but he simply nodded and opened the passenger door for her,his cold stare revealing nothing.Sato loved professionals.Langdon stood in the basement of the Adams Building and stared in disbelief atthe elegantly inscribed words on the face of the golden capstone.That’s all it says?Beside him, Katherine held the capstone under the light and shook her head.“There’s got to be more,” she insisted, sounding cheated. “This is what mybrother has been protecting all these years?”Langdon had to admit he was mystified. According to Peter and Bellamy, thiscapstone was supposed to help them decipher the stone pyramid. In light of thoseclaims, Langdon had expected something illuminating and helpful. More likeobvious and useless. Once again, he read the six words delicately inscribed onthe face of the capstone.Thesecret hideswithin The OrderThe secret hides within The Order?At first glance, the inscription appeared to be stating the obvious—that theletters on the pyramid were out of “order” and that their secret lay in findingtheir proper sequence. This reading, however, in addition to being self-evident,seemed unlikely for another reason. “The words the and order are capitalized,”Langdon said.Katherine nodded blankly. “I saw that.”The secret hides within The Order. Langdon could think of only one logicalimplication. “ ‘The Order’ must be referencing the Masonic Order.”“I agree,” Katherine said, “but it’s still no help. It tells us nothing.”Langdon had to concur. After all, the entire story of the Masonic Pyramidrevolved around a secret hidden within the Masonic Order.“Robert, didn’t my brother tell you this capstone would give you power to seeorder where others saw only chaos?”He nodded in frustration. For the second time tonight, Robert Langdon wasfeeling unworthy."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 65Once Mal’akh had finished dealing with his unexpected visitor—a female securityguard from Preferred Security—he fixed the paint on the window through which shehad glimpsed his sacred work space.Now, ascending out of the soft blue haze of the basement, he emerged through ahidden doorway into his living room. Inside, he paused, admiring his spectacularpainting of the Three Graces and savoring the familiar smells and sounds of hishome.Soon I will be leaving forever. Mal’akh knew that after tonight he would beunable to return to this place. After tonight, he thought, smiling, I will haveno need for this place.He wondered if Robert Langdon yet understood the true power of the pyramid . . .or the importance of the role for which fate had chosen him. Langdon has yet tocall me, Mal’akh thought, after double-checking for messages on his disposablephone. It was now 10:02 P.M. He has less than two hours.Mal’akh went upstairs to his Italian-marble bathroom and turned on the steamshower to let it heat up. Methodically, he stripped off his clothes, eager tobegin his cleansing ritual.He drank two glasses of water to calm his starving stomach. Then he walked tothe full-length mirror and studied his naked body. His two days of fasting hadaccentuated his musculature, and he could not help but admire that which he hadbecome. By dawn, I will be so much more."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 66“We should get out of here,” Langdon said to Katherine. “It’s only a matter oftime before they figure out where we are.” He hoped Bellamy had managed toescape.Katherine still seemed fixated on the gold capstone, looking incredulous thatthe inscription was so unhelpful. She had taken the capstone out of the box,examined every side, and was now carefully putting it back in the box.The secret hides within The Order, Langdon thought. Big help.Langdon found himself wondering now if perhaps Peter had been misinformed aboutthe contents of the box. This pyramid and capstone had been created long beforePeter was born, and Peter was simply doing as his forefathers had told him,keeping a secret that was probably as much a mystery to him as it was to Langdonand Katherine.What did I expect? Langdon wondered. The more he learned tonight about theLegend of the Masonic Pyramid, the less plausible it all seemed. I’m searchingfor a hidden spiral staircase covered by a huge stone? Something told Langdon hewas chasing shadows. Nonetheless, deciphering this pyramid seemed his bestchance at saving Peter.“Robert, does the year 1514 mean anything to you?”Fifteen-fourteen? The question seemed apropos of nothing. Langdon shrugged. “No.Why?”Katherine handed him the stone box. “Look. The box is dated. Have a look underthe light.”Langdon took a seat at the desk and studied the cube-shaped box beneath thelight. Katherine put a soft hand on his shoulder, leaning in to point out thetiny text she had found carved on the exterior of the box, near the bottomcorner of one side.“Fifteen-fourteen A.D.,” she said, pointing into the box.Sure enough, the carving depicted the number 1514, followed by an unusualstylization of the letters A and D.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_014_r1.jpg]“This date,” Katherine was saying, sounding suddenly hopeful, “maybe it’s thelink we’re missing? This dated cube looks a lot like a Masonic cornerstone, somaybe it’s pointing to a real cornerstone? Maybe to a building built in 1514A.D.?”Langdon barely heard her.Fifteen-fourteen A.D. is not a date.The symbol image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_015_r1.jpg], as any scholar ofmedieval art would recognize, was a well-known symbature—a symbol used in placeof a signature. Many of the early philosophers, artists, and authors signedtheir work with their own unique symbol or monogram rather than their name. Thispractice added a mysterious allure to their work and also protected them frompersecution should their writings or artwork be deemed counterestablishment.In the case of this symbature, the letters A.D. did not stand for Anno Domini .. . they were German for something else entirely.Langdon instantly saw all the pieces fall into place. Within seconds, he wascertain he knew exactly how to decipher the pyramid. “Katherine, you did it,” hesaid, packing up. “That’s all we needed. Let’s go. I’ll explain on the way.”Katherine looked amazed. “The date 1514 A.D. actually means something to you?”Langdon winked at her and headed for the door. “A.D. isn’t a date, Katherine.It’s a person.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 67West of Embassy Row, all was silent again inside the walled garden with itstwelfth-century roses and Shadow House gazebo. On the other side of an entryroad, the young man was helping his hunched superior walk across an expansivelawn.He’s letting me guide him?Normally, the blind old man refused help, preferring to navigate by memory alonewhile on the grounds of his sanctuary. Tonight, however, he was apparently in ahurry to get inside and return Warren Bellamy’s phone call.“Thank you,” the old man said as they entered the building that held his privatestudy. “I can find my way from here.”“Sir, I would be happy to stay and help—”“That’s all for tonight,” he said, letting go of his helper’s arm and shufflinghurriedly off into the darkness. “Good night.”The young man exited the building and walked back across the great lawn to hismodest dwelling on the grounds. By the time he entered his flat, he could feelhis curiosity gnawing at him. The old man clearly had been upset by the questionposed by Mr. Bellamy . . . and yet the question had seemed strange, almostmeaningless.Is there no help for the widow’s son?In his wildest imagination, he could not guess what this could mean. Puzzled, hewent to his computer and typed in a search for this precise phrase.To his great surprise, page after page of references appeared, all citing thisexact question. He read the information in wonderment. It seemed Warren Bellamywas not the first person in history to ask this strange question. These samewords had been uttered centuries ago . . . by King Solomon as he mourned amurdered friend. The question was allegedly still spoken today by Masons, whoused it as a kind of encoded cry for help. Warren Bellamy, it seemed, wassending a distress call to a fellow Mason."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 68Albrecht Dürer?Katherine was trying to put the pieces together as she hurried with Langdonthrough the basement of the Adams Building. A.D. stands for Albrecht Dürer? Thefamous sixteenth-century German engraver and painter was one of her brother’sfavorite artists, and Katherine was vaguely familiar with his work. Even so, shecould not imagine how Dürer would be any help to them in this case. For onething, he’s been dead more than four hundred years.“Dürer is symbolically perfect,” Langdon was saying as they followed the trailof illuminated EXIT signs. “He was the ultimate Renaissance mind—artist,philosopher, alchemist, and a lifelong student of the Ancient Mysteries. To thisday, nobody fully understands the messages hidden in Dürer’s art.”“That may be true,” she said. “But how does ‘1514 Albrecht Dürer’ explain how todecipher the pyramid?” They reached a locked door, and Langdon used Bellamy’skey card to get through.“The number 1514,” Langdon said as they hurried up the stairs, “is pointing usto a very specific piece of Dürer’s work.” They came into a huge corridor.Langdon glanced around and then pointed left. “This way.” They moved quicklyagain. “Albrecht Dürer actually hid the number 1514 in his most mysterious pieceof art—Melencolia I—which he completed in the year 1514. It’s considered theseminal work of the Northern European Renaissance.”Peter had once shown Katherine Melencolia I in an old book on ancient mysticism,but she didn’t recall any hidden number 1514.“As you may know,” Langdon said, sounding excited, “Melencolia I depictsmankind’s struggle to comprehend the Ancient Mysteries. The symbolism inMelencolia I is so complex it makes Leonardo da Vinci look overt.”Katherine stopped abruptly and looked at Langdon. “Robert, Melencolia I is herein Washington. It hangs in the National Gallery.”“Yes,” he said with a smile, “and something tells me that’s not a coincidence.The gallery is closed at this hour, but I know the curator and—”“Forget it, Robert, I know what happens when you go to museums.” Katherineheaded off into a nearby alcove, where she saw a desk with a computer.Langdon followed, looking unhappy.“Let’s do this the easier way.” It seemed Professor Langdon, the artconnoisseur, was having an ethical dilemma about using the Internet when anoriginal was so nearby. Katherine stepped behind the desk and powered up thecomputer. When the machine finally came to life, she realized she had anotherproblem. “There’s no icon for a browser.”“It’s an internal library network.” Langdon pointed to an icon on the desktop.“Try that.”Katherine clicked on the icon marked DIGITAL COLLECTIONS. The computer accesseda new screen, and Langdon pointed again. Katherine clicked on his choice oficon: FINE PRINTS COLLECTION. The screen refreshed. FINE PRINTS: SEARCH.“Type in ‘Albrecht Dürer.’ ”Katherine entered the name and then clicked the search key. Within seconds, thescreen began displaying a series of thumbnail images. All of the images lookedto be similar in style—intricate black-and-white engravings. Dürer hadapparently done dozens of similar engravings.Katherine scanned the alphabetical list of his artwork.Adam and EveBetrayal of ChristFour Horsemen of the ApocalypseGreat PassionLast SupperSeeing all the biblical titles, Katherine recalled that Dürer practicedsomething called Mystic Christianity—a fusion of early Christianity, alchemy,astrology, and science.Science . . .The image of her lab in flames rushed through her mind. She could barely processthe long-term ramifications, but for the moment, her thoughts turned to herassistant, Trish. I hope she made it out.Langdon was saying something about Dürer’s version of the Last Supper, butKatherine was barely listening. She had just seen the link for Melencolia I.She clicked the mouse, and the page refreshed with general information.Melencolia I, 1514Albrecht Dürer(engraving on laid paper)Rosenwald CollectionNational Gallery of ArtWashington, D.C.When she scrolled down, a high-res digital image of Dürer’s masterpiece appearedin all its glory.Katherine stared in bewilderment, having forgotten just how strange it was.Langdon gave an understanding chuckle. “As I said, it’s cryptic.”Melencolia I consisted of a brooding figure with giant wings, seated in front ofa stone building, surrounded by the most disparate and bizarre collection ofobjects imaginable—measuring scales, an emaciated dog, carpenter’s tools, anhourglass, various geometric solids, a hanging bell, a putto, a blade, a ladder.Katherine vaguely recalled her brother telling her that the winged figure was arepresentation of “human genius”—a great thinker with chin in hand, lookingdepressed, still unable to achieve enlightenment. The genius is surrounded withall of the symbols of his human intellect—objects of science, math, philosophy,nature, geometry, even carpentry—and yet is still unable to climb the ladder totrue enlightenment. Even the human genius has difficulty comprehending theAncient Mysteries.“Symbolically,” Langdon said, “this represents mankind’s failed attempt totransform human intellect into godlike power. In alchemical terms, it representsour inability to turn lead into gold.”“Not a particularly encouraging message,” Katherine agreed. “So how does it helpus?” She did not see the hidden number 1514 that Langdon was talking about.“Order from chaos,” Langdon said, flashing a lopsided grin. “Just as yourbrother promised.” He reached in his pocket and pulled out the grid of lettershe had written earlier from the Masonic cipher. “Right now, this grid ismeaningless.” He spread the paper out on the desk.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_012_r1.jpg]Katherine eyed the grid. Definitely meaningless.“But Dürer will transform it.”“And how might he do that?”“Linguistic alchemy.” Langdon motioned to the computer screen. “Look carefully.Hidden in this masterpiece is something that will make sense of our sixteenletters.” He waited. “Do you see it yet? Look for the number 1514.”Katherine was in no mood to play classroom. “Robert, I see nothing—an orb, aladder, a knife, a polyhedron, a scale? I give up.”“Look! There in the background. Carved into that building behind the angel?Beneath the bell? Dürer engraved a square that is full of numbers.”Katherine now saw the square that contained numbers, among them 1514.“Katherine, that square is the key to deciphering the pyramid!”She shot him a surprised look. “That’s not just any square,” Langdon said,grinning.“That, Ms. Solomon, is a magic square.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 69Where the hell are they taking me?Bellamy was still blindfolded in the back of an SUV. After a short stopsomewhere close to the Library of Congress, the vehicle had continued on . . .but only for a minute. Now the SUV had stopped again, having again traveled onlyabout a block.Bellamy heard muffled voices talking.“Sorry . . . impossible . . .” an authoritative voice was saying. “ . . . closedat this hour . . .”The man driving the SUV replied with equal authority. “CIA investigation . . .national security . . .” Apparently the exchange of words and IDs waspersuasive, because the tone shifted immediately.“Yes, of course . . . service entrance . . .” There was the loud grinding ofwhat sounded like a garage door, and as it opened, the voice added, “Shall Iaccompany you? Once you’re inside, you won’t be able to get through—”“No. We have access already.”If the guard was surprised, it was too late. The SUV was moving again. Itadvanced about fifty yards and then came to a stop. The heavy door rumbledclosed again behind them.Silence.Bellamy realized he was trembling.With a bang, the SUV’s rear hatch flew open. Bellamy felt a sharp pain in hisshoulders as someone dragged him out by his arms, then lifted him to his feet.Without a word, a powerful force led him across a wide expanse of pavement.There was a strange, earthy smell here that he could not place. There werefootsteps of someone else walking with them, but whoever it was had yet tospeak.They stopped at a door, and Bellamy heard an electronic ping. The door clickedopen. Bellamy was manhandled through several corridors and could not help butnotice that the air was warmer and more humid. An indoor pool, maybe? No. Thesmell in the air was not chlorine . . . it was far more earthy and primal.Where the hell are we?! Bellamy knew he could not be more than a block or twofrom the Capitol Building. Again they stopped, and again he heard the electronicbeep of a security door. This one slid open with a hiss. As they pushed himthrough, the smell that hit him was unmistakable.Bellamy now realized where they were. My God! He came here often, although neverthrough the service entrance. This magnificent glass building was only threehundred yards from the Capitol Building and was technically part of the CapitolComplex. I run this place! Bellamy now realized it was his own key fob that wasgiving them access.Powerful arms pushed him through the doorway, leading him down a familiar,winding walkway. The heavy, damp warmth of this place usually felt comforting tohim. Tonight, he was sweating.What are we doing here?!Bellamy was halted suddenly and seated on a bench. The man with the musclesunhooked his handcuffs only long enough to reaffix them to the bench behind hisback.“What do you want from me?” Bellamy demanded, heart pounding wildly.The only response he received was the sound of boots walking off and the glassdoor sliding shut.Then silence.Dead silence.They’re just going to leave me here? Bellamy was sweating more heavily now as hestruggled to release his hands. I can’t even take off my blindfold?“Help!” he shouted. “Anybody!”Even as he called out in panic, Bellamy knew nobody was going to hear him. Thismassive glass room—known as the Jungle—was entirely airtight when the doors wereclosed.They left me in the Jungle, he thought. Nobody will find me until morning.Then he heard it.The sound was barely audible, but it terrified Bellamy like no sound he had everheard in his life. Something breathing. Very close.He was not alone on the bench.The sudden hiss of a sulfur match sizzled so close to his face that he couldfeel the heat. Bellamy recoiled, instinctively yanking hard at his chains.Then, without warning, a hand was on his face, removing his blindfold.The flame before him reflected in the black eyes of Inoue Sato as she pressedthe match against the cigarette dangling from her lips, only inches away fromBellamy’s face.She glared at him in the moonlight that filtered down through the glass ceiling.She looked pleased to see his fear.“So, Mr. Bellamy,” Sato said, shaking out the match. “Where shall we begin?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 70A magic square. Katherine nodded as she eyed the numbered square in Dürer’sengraving. Most people would have thought Langdon had lost his mind, butKatherine had quickly realized he was right.The term magic square referred not to something mystical but to somethingmathematical—it was the name given to a grid of consecutive numbers arranged insuch a way that all the rows, columns, and diagonals added up to the same thing.Created some four thousand years ago by mathematicians in Egypt and India, magicsquares were still believed by some to hold magical powers. Katherine had readthat even nowadays devout Indians drew special three-by-three magic squarescalled the Kubera Kolam on their pooja altars. Primarily, though, modern man hadrelegated magic squares to the category of “recreational mathematics,” somepeople still deriving pleasure from the quest to discover new “magical”configurations. Sudoku for geniuses.Katherine quickly analyzed Dürer’s square, adding up the numbers in several rowsand columns.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_016_r1.jpg]“Thirty-four,” she said. “Every direction adds up to thirty-four.”“Exactly,” Langdon said. “But did you know that this magic square is famousbecause Dürer accomplished the seemingly impossible?” He quickly showedKatherine that in addition to making the rows, columns, and diagonals add up tothirty-four, Dürer had also found a way to make the four quadrants, the fourcenter squares, and even the four corner squares add up to that number. “Mostamazing, though, was Dürer’s ability to position the numbers 15 and 14 togetherin the bottom row as an indication of the year in which he accomplished thisincredible feat!”Katherine scanned the numbers, amazed by all the combinations.Langdon’s tone grew more excited now. “Extraordinarily, Melencolia I representsthe very first time in history that a magic square appeared in European art.Some historians believe this was Dürer’s encoded way of indicating that theAncient Mysteries had traveled outside the Egyptian Mystery Schools and were nowheld by the European secret societies.” Langdon paused. “Which brings us back to. . . this.”He motioned to the slip of paper bearing the grid of letters from the stonepyramid.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_012_r1.jpg]“I assume the layout looks familiar now?” Langdon asked.“Four-by-four square.”Langdon picked up the pencil and carefully transcribed Dürer’s numbered magicsquare onto the slip of paper, directly beside the lettered square. Katherinewas now seeing just how easy this was going to be. He stood poised, pencil inhand, and yet . . . strangely, after all this enthusiasm, he seemed to hesitate.“Robert?”He turned to her, his expression one of trepidation. “Are you sure we want to dothis? Peter expressly—”“Robert, if you don’t want to decipher this engraving, then I will.” She heldout her hand for the pencil.Langdon could tell there would be no deterring her and so he acquiesced, turninghis attention back to the pyramid. Carefully, he superimposed the magic squareover the pyramid’s grid of letters and assigned each letter a number. Then hecreated a new grid, placing the Masonic cipher’s letters in the new order asdefined by the sequence in Dürer’s magic square.When Langdon was finished, they both examined the result.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_017_r1.jpg]Katherine immediately felt confused. “It’s still gibberish.”Langdon remained silent a long moment. “Actually, Katherine, it’s notgibberish.” His eyes brightened again with the thrill of discovery. “It’s . . .Latin.”In a long, dark corridor, an old blind man shuffled as quickly as he couldtoward his office. When he finally arrived, he collapsed in his desk chair, hisold bones grateful for the reprieve. His answering machine was beeping. Hepressed the button and listened.“It’s Warren Bellamy,” said the hushed whisper of his friend and Masonicbrother. “I’m afraid I have alarming news . . .”Katherine Solomon’s eyes shot back to the grid of letters, reexamining the text.Sure enough, a Latin word now materialized before her eyes. Jeova.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_017_r1.jpg]Katherine had not studied Latin, but this word was familiar from her reading ofancient Hebrew texts. Jeova. Jehovah. As her eyes continued to trace downward,reading the grid like a book, she was surprised to realize she could read theentire text of the pyramid.Jeova Sanctus Unus.She knew its meaning at once. This phrase was ubiquitous in modern translationsof Hebrew scripture. In the Torah, the God of the Hebrews was known by manynames—Jeova, Jehovah, Jeshua, Yahweh, the Source, the Elohim—but many Romantranslations had consolidated the confusing nomenclature into a single Latinphrase: Jeova Sanctus Unus.“One true God?” she whispered to herself. The phrase certainly did not seem likesomething that would help them find her brother. “That’s this pyramid’s secretmessage? One true God? I thought this was a map.”Langdon looked equally perplexed, the excitement in his eyes evaporating. “Thisdecryption obviously is correct, but . . .”“The man who has my brother wants to know a location.” She tucked her hairbehind her ear. “This is not going to make him very happy.”“Katherine,” Langdon said, heaving a sigh. “I’ve been afraid of this. All night,I’ve had a feeling we’re treating as reality a collection of myths andallegories. Maybe this inscription is pointing to a metaphoricallocation—telling us that the true potential of man can be accessed only throughthe one true God.”“But that makes no sense!” Katherine replied, her jaw now clenched infrustration. “My family protected this pyramid for generations! One true God?That’s the secret? And the CIA considers this an issue of national security?Either they’re lying or we’re missing something!”Langdon shrugged in accord.Just then, his phone began to ring.In a cluttered office lined with old books, the old man hunched over his desk,clutching a phone receiver in his arthritic hand.The line rang and rang.At last, a tentative voice answered. “Hello?” The voice was deep but uncertain.The old man whispered, “I was told you require sanctuary.”The man on the line seemed startled. “Who is this? Did Warren Bell—”“No names, please,” the old man said. “Tell me, have you successfully protectedthe map that was entrusted to you?”A startled pause. “Yes . . . but I don’t think it matters. It doesn’t say much.If it is a map, it seems to be more metaphorical than—”“No, the map is quite real, I assure you. And it points to a very real location.You must keep it safe. I cannot impress upon you enough how important this is.You are being pursued, but if you can travel unseen to my location, I willprovide sanctuary . . . and answers.”The man hesitated, apparently uncertain.“My friend,” the old man began, choosing his words carefully. “There is a refugein Rome, north of the Tiber, which contains ten stones from Mount Sinai, onefrom heaven itself, and one with the visage of Luke’s dark father. Do you knowmy location?”There was a long pause on the line, and then the man replied, “Yes, I do.”The old man smiled. I thought you might, Professor. “Come at once. Make sureyou’re not followed.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 71Mal’akh stood naked in the billowing warmth of his steam shower. He felt pureagain, having washed off the last remaining scent of ethanol. As theeucalyptus-infused vapors permeated his skin, he could feel his pores opening tothe heat. Then he began his ritual.First, he rubbed depilatory chemicals across his tattooed body and scalp,removing any traces of body hair. Hairless were the gods of the seven islands ofHeliades. Then he massaged Abramelin oil into his softened and receptive flesh.Abramelin is the sacred oil of the great Magi. Then he turned his shower leverhard to the left, and the water turned ice cold. He stood beneath the frigidwater for a full minute to close his pores and trap the heat and energy withinhis core. The cold served as a reminder of the icy river in which thistransformation had begun.When he stepped from the shower, he was shivering, but within seconds, his coreheat emanated up through his layers of flesh and warmed him. Mal’akh’s insidesfelt like a furnace. He stood naked before the mirror and admired his form . . .perhaps the last time he would see himself as a mere mortal.His feet were the talons of a hawk. His legs—Boaz and Jachin—were the ancientpillars of wisdom. His hips and abdomen were the archways of mystical power.Hanging beneath the archway, his massive sex organ bore the tattooed symbols ofhis destiny. In another life, this heavy shaft of flesh had been his source ofcarnal pleasure. But no longer.I have been purified.Like the mystical eunuch monks of Katharoi, Mal’akh had removed his testicles.He had sacrificed his physical potency for a more worthy one. Gods have nogender. Having shed the human imperfection of gender along with the earthly pullof sexual temptation, Mal’akh had become like Ouranos, Attis, Sporus, and thegreat castrati magicians of Arthurian legend. Every spiritual metamorphosis ispreceded by a physical one. Such was the lesson of all the great gods . . . fromOsiris, to Tammuz, to Jesus, to Shiva, to the Buddha himself.I must shed the man who clothes me.Abruptly, Mal’akh drew his gaze upward, past the double-headed phoenix on hischest, past the collage of ancient sigils adorning his face, and directly to thetop of his head. He tipped his head toward the mirror, barely able to see thecircle of bare flesh that waited there. This location on the body was sacred.Known as the fontanel, it was the one area of the human skull that remained openat birth. An oculus to the brain. Although this physiological portal closeswithin a matter of months, it remains a symbolic vestige of the lost connectionbetween the outer and inner worlds.Mal’akh studied the sacred patch of virginal skin, which was enclosed by thecrownlike circle of an ouroboros—a mystical snake devouring its own tail. Thebare flesh seemed to stare back at him . . . bright with promise.Robert Langdon soon would uncover the great treasure that Mal’akh required. OnceMal’akh possessed it, the void on top of his head would be filled, and he wouldat last be prepared for his final transformation.Mal’akh padded across his bedroom and took from his bottom drawer a long stripof white silk. As he had done many times before, he wrapped it around his groinand buttocks. Then he went downstairs.In his office, his computer had received an e-mail message.It was from his contact:WHAT YOU REQUIRE IS NOW WITHIN REACH.I WILL CONTACT YOU WITHIN THE HOUR. PATIENCE.Mal’akh smiled. It was time to make final preparations."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 72The CIA field agent was in a foul mood as he descended from the reading-roombalcony. Bellamy lied to us. The agent had seen no heat signatures whatsoeverupstairs near the Moses statue, nor anywhere else upstairs for that matter.So where the hell did Langdon go?The agent retraced his steps now to the only place they’d spotted any heatsignatures at all—the library’s distribution hub. He descended the stairs again,moving beneath the octagonal console. The noise of the rumbling conveyors wasgrating. Advancing into the space, he flipped down his thermal goggles andscanned the room. Nothing. He looked toward the stacks, where the mangled doorstill showed hot from the explosion. Other than that, he saw no—Holy shit!The agent jumped back as an unexpected luminescence drifted into his field ofvision. Like a pair of ghosts, the dimly glowing imprints of two humanoids hadjust emerged from the wall on a conveyor belt. Heat signatures.Stunned, the agent watched as the two apparitions circled the room on theconveyor loop and then disappeared headfirst into a narrow hole in the wall.They rode the conveyor out? That’s insanity.In addition to realizing they had just lost Robert Langdon through a hole in thewall, the field agent was now aware that he had another problem. Langdon’s notalone?He was just about to switch on his transceiver and call the team leader, but theteam leader beat him to it.“All points, we’ve got an abandoned Volvo on the plaza in front of the library.Registered to one Katherine Solomon. Eyewitness says she entered the library notlong ago. We suspect she’s with Robert Langdon. Director Sato has ordered thatwe find them both immediately.”“I’ve got heat signatures for both of them!” shouted the field agent in thedistribution room. He explained the situation.“For Christ’s sake!” the team leader replied. “Where the hell does the conveyorgo?”The field agent was already consulting the employee reference schematic on thebulletin board. “Adams Building,” he replied. “One block from here.”“All points. Redirect to the Adams Building! NOW!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 73Sanctuary. Answers.The words echoed in Langdon’s mind as he and Katherine burst through a side doorof the Adams Building and out into the cold winter night. The mysterious callerhad conveyed his location cryptically, but Langdon had understood. Katherine’sreaction to their destination had been surprisingly sanguine: Where better tofind One True God?Now the question was how to get there.Langdon spun in place, trying to get his bearings. It was dark, but thankfullythe weather had cleared. They were standing in a small courtyard. In thedistance, the Capitol Dome looked startlingly far away, and Langdon realizedthis was the first moment he had stepped outside since arriving at the Capitolseveral hours ago.So much for my lecture.“Robert, look.” Katherine pointed toward the silhouette of the JeffersonBuilding.Langdon’s first reaction on seeing the building was astonishment that they hadtraveled so far underground on a conveyor belt. His second reaction, however,was alarm. The Jefferson Building was now abuzz with activity—trucks and carspulling in, men shouting. Is that a searchlight?Langdon grabbed Katherine’s hand. “Come on.”They ran northeast across the courtyard, quickly disappearing from view behindan elegant U-shaped building, which Langdon realized was the Folger ShakespeareLibrary. This particular building seemed appropriate camouflage for themtonight, as it housed the original Latin manuscript of Francis Bacon’s NewAtlantis, the utopian vision on which the American forefathers had allegedlymodeled a new world based on ancient knowledge. Even so, Langdon would not bestopping.We need a cab.They arrived at the corner of Third Street and East Capitol. The traffic wassparse, and Langdon felt fading hope as he scanned for taxis. He and Katherinehurried northward on Third Street, putting distance between themselves and theLibrary of Congress. It was not until they had gone an entire block that Langdonfinally spotted a cab rounding the corner. He flagged it down, and the cabpulled over.Middle Eastern music played on his radio, and the young Arab driver gave them afriendly smile. “Where to?” the driver asked as they jumped into the car.“We need to go to—”“Northwest!” Katherine interjected, pointing up Third Street away from theJefferson Building. “Drive toward Union Station, then left on MassachusettsAvenue. We’ll tell you when to stop.”The driver shrugged, closed the Plexiglas divider, and turned his music back on.Katherine shot Langdon an admonishing look as if to say: “Leave no trail.” Shepointed out the window, directing Langdon’s attention to a black helicopter thatwas skimming in low, approaching the area. Shit. Sato was apparently deadserious about recovering Solomon’s pyramid.As they watched the helicopter land between the Jefferson and Adams buildings,Katherine turned to him, looking increasingly worried. “Can I see your cellphone for a second?”Langdon handed her his phone.“Peter told me you have an eidetic memory?” she said, rolling down her window.“And that you remember every phone number you’ve ever dialed?”“That’s true, but—”Katherine hurled his phone out into the night. Langdon spun in his seat andwatched as his cell phone cartwheeled and splintered into pieces on the pavementbehind them. “Why did you do that!”“Off the grid,” Katherine said, her eyes grave. “This pyramid is our only hopeof finding my brother, and I have no intention of letting the CIA steal it fromus.”In the front seat, Omar Amirana bobbed his head and hummed along with his music.Tonight had been slow, and he felt blessed to finally have a fare. His cab wasjust passing Stanton Park, when the familiar voice of his company dispatchercrackled over the radio.“This is Dispatch. All vehicles in the area of the National Mall. We have justreceived a bulletin from government authorities regarding two fugitives in thearea of the Adams Building . . .”Omar listened in amazement as Dispatch described the precise couple in his cab.He stole an uneasy glance in his rearview mirror. Omar had to admit, the tallguy did look familiar somehow. Did I see him on America’s Most Wanted?Gingerly, Omar reached for his radio handset. “Dispatch?” he said, speakingquietly into the transceiver. “This is cab one-three-four. The two people youasked about—they are in my cab . . . right now.”Dispatch immediately advised Omar what to do. Omar’s hands were trembling as hecalled the phone number Dispatch had given him. The voice that answered wastight and efficient, like that of a soldier.“This is Agent Turner Simkins, CIA field ops. Who is this?”“Um . . . I’m the taxi driver?” Omar said. “I was told to call about the two—”“Are the fugitives currently in your vehicle? Answer only yes or no.”“Yes.”“Can they hear this conversation? Yes or no?”“No. The slider is—”“Where are you taking them?”“Northwest on Massachusetts.”“Specific destination?”“They didn’t say.”The agent hesitated. “Is the male passenger carrying a leather bag?”Omar glanced in the rearview mirror, and his eyes went wide. “Yes! That bagdoesn’t have explosives or anything in—”“Listen carefully,” the agent said. “You are in no danger so long as you followmy directions exactly. Is that clear?”“Yes, sir.”“What is your name?”“Omar,” he said, breaking a sweat.“Listen, Omar,” the man said calmly. “You’re doing great. I want you to drive asslowly as possible while I get my team out in front of you. Do you understand?”“Yes, sir.”“Also, is your cab equipped with an intercom system so you can communicate withthem in the backseat?”“Yes, sir.”“Good. Here’s what I want you to do.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 74The Jungle, as it is known, is the centerpiece of the U.S. Botanic Garden(USBG)—America’s living museum—located adjacent to the U.S. Capitol Building.Technically a rain forest, the Jungle is housed in a towering greenhouse,complete with soaring rubber trees, strangler figs, and a canopy catwalk formore daring tourists.Normally, Warren Bellamy felt nurtured by the Jungle’s earthy smells and thesunlight glinting through the mist that filtered down from the vapor nozzles inthe glass ceiling. Tonight, however, lit only by moonlight, the Jungle terrifiedhim. He was sweating profusely, writhing against the cramps that now stabbed athis arms, still pinned painfully behind him.Director Sato paced before him, puffing calmly on her cigarette—the equivalentof ecoterrorism in this carefully calibrated environment. Her face looked almostdemonic in the smoke-filled moonlight that streamed down through the glassceiling overhead.“So then,” Sato continued, “when you arrived at the Capitol tonight, and youdiscovered that I was already there . . . you made a decision. Rather thanmaking your presence known to me, you descended quietly into the SBB, where, atgreat risk to yourself, you attacked Chief Anderson and myself, and you helpedLangdon escape with the pyramid and capstone.” She rubbed her shoulder. “Aninteresting choice.”A choice I would make again, Bellamy thought. “Where is Peter?” he demandedangrily.“How would I know?” Sato said.“You seem to know everything else!” Bellamy fired back at her, making no attemptto hide his suspicion that she was somehow behind all this. “You knew to go tothe Capitol Building. You knew to find Robert Langdon. And you even knew toX-ray Langdon’s bag to find the capstone. Obviously, someone is giving you a lotof inside information.”Sato laughed coldly and stepped closer to him. “Mr. Bellamy, is that why youattacked me? Do you think I’m the enemy? Do you think I’m trying to steal yourlittle pyramid?” Sato took a drag on her cigarette and blew the smoke out of hernostrils. “Listen carefully. No one understands better than I do the importanceof keeping secrets. I believe, as you do, that there is certain information towhich the masses should not be privy. Tonight, however, there are forces at workthat I fear you have not yet grasped. The man who kidnapped Peter Solomon holdsenormous power . . . a power that you apparently have yet to realize. Believeme, he is a walking time bomb . . . capable of initiating a series of eventsthat will profoundly change the world as you know it.”“I don’t understand.” Bellamy shifted on the bench, his arms aching in hishandcuffs.“You don’t need to understand. You need to obey. Right now, my only hope ofaverting a major disaster is to cooperate with this man . . . and to give himexactly what he wants. Which means, you are going to call Mr. Langdon and tellhim to turn himself in, along with the pyramid and capstone. Once Langdon is inmy custody, he will decrypt the pyramid’s inscription, obtain whateverinformation this man is demanding, and provide him with exactly what he wants.”The location of the spiral staircase that leads to the Ancient Mysteries? “Ican’t do that. I’ve taken vows of secrecy.”Sato erupted. “I don’t give a damn what you’ve vowed, I will throw you in prisonso fast—”“Threaten me all you like,” Bellamy said defiantly. “I will not help you.”Sato took a deep breath and spoke now in a fearsome whisper. “Mr. Bellamy, youhave no idea what’s really going on tonight, do you?”The tense silence hung for several seconds, finally broken by the sound ofSato’s phone. She plunged her hand into her pocket and eagerly snatched it out.“Talk to me,” she answered, listening carefully to the reply. “Where is theirtaxi now? How long? Okay, good. Bring them to the U.S. Botanic Garden. Serviceentrance. And make sure you get me that god-damn pyramid and capstone.”Sato hung up and turned back to Bellamy with a smug smile. “Well then . . . itseems you’re fast outliving your usefulness.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 75Robert Langdon stared blankly into space, feeling too tired to urge theslow-moving taxi driver to pick up the pace. Beside him, Katherine had fallensilent, too, looking frustrated by their lack of understanding of what made thepyramid so special. They had again been through everything they knew about thepyramid, the capstone, and the evening’s strange events; they still had no ideasas to how this pyramid could possibly be considered a map to anything at all.Jeova Sanctus Unus? The secret hides within The Order?Their mysterious contact had promised them answers if they could meet him at aspecific place. A refuge in Rome, north of the Tiber. Langdon knew theforefathers’ “new Rome” had been renamed Washington early in her history, andyet vestiges of their original dream remained: the Tiber’s waters still flowedinto the Potomac; senators still convened beneath a replica of St. Peter’s dome;and Vulcan and Minerva still watched over the Rotunda’s long-extinguished flame.The answers sought by Langdon and Katherine were apparently waiting for themjust a few miles ahead. Northwest on Massachusetts Avenue. Their destination wasindeed a refuge . . . north of Washington’s Tiber Creek. Langdon wished thedriver would speed up.Abruptly, Katherine jolted upright in her seat, as if she had made a suddenrealization. “Oh my God, Robert!” She turned to him, her face going white. Shehesitated a moment and then spoke emphatically. “We’re going the wrong way!”“No, this is right,” Langdon countered. “It’s northwest on Massachu—”“No! I mean we’re going to the wrong place!”Langdon was mystified. He had already told Katherine how he knew what locationwas being described by the mysterious caller. It contains ten stones from MountSinai, one from heaven itself, and one with the visage of Luke’s dark father.Only one building on earth could make those claims. And that was exactly wherethis taxi was headed.“Katherine, I’m certain the location is correct.”“No!” she shouted. “We don’t need to go there anymore. I figured out the pyramidand capstone! I know what this is all about!”Langdon was amazed. “You understand it?”“Yes! We have to go to Freedom Plaza instead!”Now Langdon was lost. Freedom Plaza, although nearby, seemed totally irrelevant.“Jeova Sanctus Unus!” Katherine said. “The One True God of the Hebrews. Thesacred symbol of the Hebrews is the Jewish star—the Seal of Solomon—an importantsymbol to the Masons!” She fished a dollar bill out of her pocket. “Give me yourpen.”Bewildered, Langdon pulled a pen from his jacket.“Look.” She spread the bill out on her thigh and took his pen, pointing to theGreat Seal on the back. “If you superimpose Solomon’s seal on the Great Seal ofthe United States . . .” She drew the symbol of a Jewish star precisely over thepyramid. “Look what you get!”Langdon looked down at the bill and then back at Katherine as if she were mad.“Robert, look more closely! Don’t you see what I’m pointing at?”He glanced back at the drawing.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_018_r1.jpg]What in the world is she getting at? Langdon had seen this image before. It waspopular among conspiracy theorists as “proof” that the Masons held secretinfluence over our early nation. When the six-pointed star was laid perfectlyover the Great Seal of the United States, the star’s top vertex fit perfectlyover the Masonic all-seeing eye . . . and, quite eerily, the other five verticesclearly pointed to the letters M-A-S-O-N.“Katherine, that’s just a coincidence, and I still don’t see how it has anythingto do with Freedom Plaza.”“Look again!” she said, sounding almost angry now. “You’re not looking where Iam pointing! Right there. Don’t you see it?”An instant later, Langdon saw it.CIA field-operations leader Turner Simkins stood outside the Adams Building andpressed his cell phone tightly to his ear, straining to hear the conversationnow taking place in the back of the taxi. Something just happened. His team wasabout to board the modified Sikorsky UH-60 helicopter to head northwest and setup a roadblock, but now it seemed the situation had suddenly changed.Seconds ago, Katherine Solomon had begun insisting they were going to the wrongdestination. Her explanation—something about the dollar bill and Jewishstars—made no sense to the team leader, nor, apparently, to Robert Langdon. Atleast at first. Now, however, Langdon seemed to have grasped her meaning.“My God, you’re right!” Langdon blurted. “I didn’t see it earlier!”Suddenly Simkins could hear someone banging on the driver’s divider, and then itslid open. “Change of plans,” Katherine shouted to the driver. “Take us toFreedom Plaza!”“Freedom Plaza?” the cabbie said, sounding nervous. “Not northwest onMassachusetts?”“Forget that!” Katherine shouted. “Freedom Plaza! Go left here! Here! HERE!”Agent Simkins heard the cab screeching around a corner. Katherine was talkingexcitedly again to Langdon, saying something about the famous bronze cast of theGreat Seal embedded in the plaza.“Ma’am, just to confirm,” the cabbie’s voice interjected, sounding tense. “We’regoing to Freedom Plaza—on the corner of Pennsylvania and Thirteenth?”“Yes!” Katherine said. “Hurry!”“It’s very close. Two minutes.”Simkins smiled. Nicely done, Omar. As he dashed toward the idling helicopter, heshouted to his team. “We’ve got them! Freedom Plaza! Move!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 76Freedom Plaza is a map.Located at the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and Thirteenth Street, the plaza’svast surface of inlaid stone depicts the streets of Washington as they wereoriginally envisioned by Pierre L’Enfant. The plaza is a popular touristdestination not only because the giant map is fun to walk on, but also becauseMartin Luther King Jr., for whom Freedom Plaza is named, wrote much of his “IHave a Dream” speech in the nearby Willard Hotel.D.C. cabdriver Omar Amirana brought tourists to Freedom Plaza all the time, buttonight, his two passengers were obviously no ordinary sightseers. The CIA ischasing them? Omar had barely come to a stop at the curb before the man andwoman had jumped out.“Stay right here!” the man in the tweed coat told Omar. “We’ll be right back!”Omar watched the two people dash out onto the wide-open spaces of the enormousmap, pointing and shouting as they scanned the geometry of intersecting streets.Omar grabbed his cell phone off the dashboard. “Sir, are you still there?”“Yes, Omar!” a voice shouted, barely audible over a thundering noise on his endof the line. “Where are they now?”“Out on the map. It seems like they’re looking for something.”“Do not let them out of your sight,” the agent shouted. “I’m almost there!”Omar watched as the two fugitives quickly found the plaza’s famous GreatSeal—one of the largest bronze medallions ever cast. They stood over it a momentand quickly began pointing to the southwest. Then the man in tweed came racingback toward the cab. Omar quickly set his phone down on the dashboard as the manarrived, breathless.“Which direction is Alexandria, Virginia?” he demanded.“Alexandria?” Omar pointed southwest, the exact same direction the man and womanhad just pointed toward.“I knew it!” the man whispered beneath his breath. He spun and shouted back tothe woman. “You’re right! Alexandria!”The woman now pointed across the plaza to an illuminated “Metro” sign nearby.“The Blue Line goes directly there. We want King Street Station!”Omar felt a surge of panic. Oh no.The man turned back to Omar and handed him entirely too many bills for the fare.“Thanks. We’re all set.” He hoisted his leather bag and ran off.“Wait! I can drive you! I go there all the time!”But it was too late. The man and woman were already dashing across the plaza.They disappeared down the stairs into the Metro Center subway station.Omar grabbed his cell phone. “Sir! They ran down into the subway! I couldn’tstop them! They’re taking the Blue Line to Alexandria!”“Stay right there!” the agent shouted. “I’ll be there in fifteen seconds!”Omar looked down at the wad of bills the man had given him. The bill on top wasapparently the one they had been writing on. It had a Jewish star on top of theGreat Seal of the United States. Sure enough, the star’s points fell on lettersthat spelled MASON.Without warning, Omar felt a deafening vibration all around him, as if a tractortrailer were about to collide with his cab. He looked up, but the street wasdeserted. The noise increased, and suddenly a sleek black helicopter droppeddown out of the night and landed hard in the middle of the plaza map.A group of black-clad men jumped out. Most ran toward the subway station, butone came dashing toward Omar’s cab. He yanked open the passenger door. “Omar? Isthat you?”Omar nodded, speechless.“Did they say where they were headed?” the agent demanded.“Alexandria! King Street Station,” Omar blurted. “I offered to drive, but—”“Did they say where in Alexandria they were going?”“No! They looked at the medallion of the Great Seal on the plaza, then theyasked about Alexandria, and they paid me with this.” He handed the agent thedollar bill with the bizarre diagram. As the agent studied the bill, Omarsuddenly put it all together. The Masons! Alexandria! One of the most famousMasonic buildings in America was in Alexandria. “That’s it!” he blurted. “TheGeorge Washington Masonic Memorial! It’s directly across from King StreetStation!”“That it is,” the agent said, apparently having just come to the samerealization as the rest of the agents came sprinting back from the station.“We missed them!” one of the men yelled. “Blue Line just left! They’re not downthere!”Agent Simkins checked his watch and turned back to Omar. “How long does thesubway take to Alexandria?”“Ten minutes at least. Probably more.”“Omar, you’ve done an excellent job. Thank you.”“Sure. What’s this all about?!”But Agent Simkins was already running back to the chopper, shouting as he went.“King Street Station! We’ll get there before they do!”Bewildered, Omar watched the great black bird lift off. It banked hard to thesouth across Pennsylvania Avenue, and then thundered off into the night.Underneath the cabbie’s feet, a subway train was picking up speed as it headedaway from Freedom Plaza. On board, Robert Langdon and Katherine Solomon satbreathless, neither one saying a word as the train whisked them toward theirdestination."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 77The memory always began the same way.He was falling . . . plummeting backward toward an ice-covered river at thebottom of a deep ravine. Above him, the merciless gray eyes of Peter Solomonstared down over the barrel of Andros’s handgun. As he fell, the world above himreceded, everything disappearing as he was enveloped by the cloud of billowingmist from the waterfall upstream.For an instant, everything was white, like heaven.Then he hit the ice.Cold. Black. Pain.He was tumbling . . . being dragged by a powerful force that pounded himrelentlessly across rocks in an impossibly cold void. His lungs ached for air,and yet his chest muscles had contracted so violently in the cold that he wasunable even to inhale.I’m under the ice.The ice near the waterfall was apparently thin on account of the turbulentwater, and Andros had broken directly through it. Now he was being washeddownstream, trapped beneath a transparent ceiling. He clawed at the underside ofthe ice, trying to break out, but he had no leverage. The searing pain from thebullet hole in his shoulder was evaporating, as was the sting of the bird shot;both were blotted out now by the crippling throb of his body going numb.The current was accelerating, slingshotting him around a bend in the river. Hisbody screamed for oxygen. Suddenly he was tangled in branches, lodged against atree that had fallen into the water. Think! He groped wildly at the branch,working his way toward the surface, finding the spot where the branch pierced upthrough the ice. His fingertips found the tiny space of open water surroundingthe branch, and he pulled at the edges, trying to break the hole wider; once,twice, the opening was growing, now several inches across.Propping himself against the branch, he tipped his head back and pressed hismouth against the small opening. The winter air that poured into his lungs feltwarm. The sudden burst of oxygen fueled his hope. He planted his feet on thetree trunk and pressed his back and shoulders forcefully upward. The ice aroundthe fallen tree, perforated by branches and debris, was weakened already, and ashe drove his powerful legs into the trunk, his head and shoulders broke throughthe ice, crashing up into the winter night. Air poured into his lungs. Stillmostly submerged, he wriggled desperately upward, pushing with his legs, pullingwith his arms, until finally he was out of the water, lying breathless on thebare ice.Andros tore off his soaked ski mask and pocketed it, glancing back upstream forPeter Solomon. The bend in the river obscured his view. His chest was burningagain. Quietly, he dragged a small branch over the hole in the ice in order tohide it. The hole would be frozen again by morning.As Andros staggered into the woods, it began to snow. He had no idea how far hehad run when he stumbled out of the woods onto an embankment beside a smallhighway. He was delirious and hypothermic. The snow was falling harder now, anda single set of headlights approached in the distance. Andros waved wildly, andthe lone pickup truck immediately pulled over. It had Vermont plates. An old manin a red plaid shirt jumped out.Andros staggered toward him, holding his bleeding chest. “A hunter . . . shotme! I need a . . . hospital!”Without hesitation, the old man helped Andros up into the passenger seat of thetruck and turned up the heater. “Where’s the nearest hospital?!”Andros had no idea, but he pointed south. “Next exit.” We’re not going to ahospital.The old man from Vermont was reported missing the next day, but nobody had anyidea where on his journey from Vermont he might have disappeared in the blindingsnowstorm. Nor did anyone link his disappearance to the other news story thatdominated the headlines the next day—the shocking murder of Isabel Solomon.When Andros awoke, he was lying in a desolate bedroom of a cheap motel that hadbeen boarded up for the season. He recalled breaking in and binding his woundswith torn bedsheets, and then burrowing into a flimsy bed beneath a pile ofmusty blankets. He was famished.He limped to the bathroom and saw the pile of bloody bird-shot pellets in thesink. He vaguely recalled prying them out of his chest. Raising his eyes to thedirty mirror, he reluctantly unwrapped his bloody bandages to survey the damage.The hard muscles of his chest and abdomen had stopped the bird shot frompenetrating too deep, and yet his body, once perfect, was now ruined withwounds. The single bullet fired by Peter Solomon had apparently gone cleanlythrough his shoulder, leaving a bloody crater.Making matters worse, Andros had failed to obtain that for which he had traveledall this distance. The pyramid. His stomach growled, and he limped outside tothe man’s truck, hoping maybe to find food. The pickup was now covered withheavy snow, and Andros wondered how long he had been sleeping in this old motel.Thank God I woke up. Andros found no food anywhere in the front seat, but he didfind some arthritis painkillers in the glove compartment. He took a handful,washing them down with several mouthfuls of snow.I need food.A few hours later, the pickup that pulled out from behind the old motel lookednothing like the truck that had pulled in two days earlier. The cab cap wasmissing, as were the hubcaps, bumper stickers, and all of the trim. The Vermontplates were gone, replaced by those from an old maintenance truck Andros hadfound parked by the motel Dumpster, into which he had thrown all the bloodysheets, bird shot, and other evidence that he had ever been at the motel.Andros had not given up on the pyramid, but for the moment it would have towait. He needed to hide, heal, and above all, eat. He found a roadside dinerwhere he gorged himself on eggs, bacon, hash browns, and three glasses of orangejuice. When he was done, he ordered more food to go. Back on the road, Androslistened to the truck’s old radio. He had not seen a television or newspapersince his ordeal, and when he finally heard a local news station, the reportstunned him.“FBI investigators,” a news announcer said, “continue their search for the armedintruder who murdered Isabel Solomon in her Potomac home two days ago. Themurderer is believed to have fallen through the ice and been washed out to sea.”Andros froze. Murdered Isabel Solomon? He drove on in bewildered silence,listening to the full report.It was time to get far, far away from this place.The Upper West Side apartment offered breathtaking views of Central Park. Androshad chosen it because the sea of green outside his window reminded him of hislost view of the Adriatic. Although he knew he should be happy to be alive, hewas not. The emptiness had never left him, and he found himself fixated on hisfailed attempt to steal Peter Solomon’s pyramid.Andros had spent long hours researching the Legend of the Masonic Pyramid, andalthough nobody seemed to agree on whether or not the pyramid was real, they allconcurred on its famous promise of vast wisdom and power. The Masonic Pyramid isreal, Andros told himself. My inside information is irrefutable.Fate had placed the pyramid within Andros’s reach, and he knew that ignoring itwas like holding a winning lottery ticket and never cashing it in. I am the onlynon-Mason alive who knows the pyramid is real . . . as well as the identity ofthe man who guards it.Months had passed, and although his body had healed, Andros was no longer thecocky specimen he had been in Greece. He had stopped working out, and he hadstopped admiring himself naked in the mirror. He felt as if his body werebeginning to show signs of age. His once-perfect skin was a patchwork of scars,and this only depressed him further. He still relied on the painkillers that hadnursed him through his recovery, and he felt himself slipping back to thelifestyle that had put him in Soganlik Prison. He didn’t care. The body craveswhat the body craves.One night, he was in Greenwich Village buying drugs from a man whose forearm hadbeen tattooed with a long, jagged lightning bolt. Andros asked him about it, andthe man told him the tattoo was covering a long scar he had gotten in a caraccident. “Seeing the scar every day reminded me of the accident,” the dealersaid, “and so I tattooed over it with a symbol of personal power. I took backcontrol.”That night, high on his new stash of drugs, Andros staggered into a local tattooparlor and took off his shirt. “I want to hide these scars,” he announced. Iwant to take back control.“Hide them?” The tattoo artist eyed his chest. “With what?”“Tattoos.”“Yes . . . I mean tattoos of what?”Andros shrugged, wanting nothing more than to hide the ugly reminders of hispast. “I don’t know. You choose.”The artist shook his head and handed Andros a pamphlet on the ancient and sacredtradition of tattooing. “Come back when you’re ready.”Andros discovered that the New York Public Library had in its collectionfifty-three books on tattooing, and within a few weeks, he had read them all.Having rediscovered his passion for reading, he began carrying entire backpacksof books back and forth between the library and his apartment, where hevoraciously devoured them while overlooking Central Park.These books on tattoos had opened a door to a strange world Andros had neverknown existed—a world of symbols, mysticism, mythology, and the magical arts.The more he read, the more he realized how blind he had been. He began keepingnotebooks of his ideas, his sketches, and his strange dreams. When he could nolonger find what he wanted at the library, he paid rare-book dealers to purchasefor him some of the most esoteric texts on earth.De Praestigiis Daemonum . . . Lemegeton . . . Ars Almadel . . . Grimorium Verum. . . Ars Notoria . . . and on and on. He read them all, becoming more and morecertain that the world still had many treasures yet to offer him. There aresecrets out there that transcend human understanding.Then he discovered the writings of Aleister Crowley—a visionary mystic from theearly 1900s—whom the church had deemed “the most evil man who ever lived.” Greatminds are always feared by lesser minds. Andros learned about the power ofritual and incantation. He learned that sacred words, if properly spoken,functioned like keys that opened gateways to other worlds. There is a shadowuniverse beyond this one . . . a world from which I can draw power. And althoughAndros longed to harness that power, he knew there were rules and tasks to becompleted beforehand.Become something holy, Crowley wrote. Make yourself sacred.The ancient rite of “sacred making” had once been the law of the land. From theearly Hebrews who made burnt offerings at the Temple, to the Mayans who beheadedhumans atop the pyramids of Chichén Itzá, to Jesus Christ, who offered his bodyon the cross, the ancients understood God’s requirement for sacrifice. Sacrificewas the original ritual by which humans drew favor from the gods and madethemselves holy.Sacra—sacred.Face— make.Even though the rite of sacrifice had been abandoned eons ago, its powerremained. There had been a handful of modern mystics, including AleisterCrowley, who practiced the Art, perfecting it over time, and transformingthemselves gradually into something more. Andros craved to transform himself asthey had. And yet he knew he would have to cross a dangerous bridge to do so.Blood is all that separates the light from the dark.One night, a crow flew through Andros’s open bathroom window and got trapped inhis apartment. Andros watched the bird flutter around for a while and thenfinally stop, apparently accepting its inability to escape. Andros had learnedenough to recognize a sign. I am being urged onward.Clutching the bird in one hand, he stood at the makeshift altar in his kitchenand raised a sharp knife, speaking aloud the incantation he had memorized.“Camiach, Eomiahe, Emial, Macbal, Emoii, Zazean . . . by the most holy names ofthe angels in the Book of Assamaian, I conjure thee that thou assist me in thisoperation by the power of the One True God.”Andros now lowered the knife and carefully pierced the large vein on the rightwing of the panicked bird. The crow began to bleed. As he watched the stream ofred liquid flowing down into the metal cup he had placed as a receptacle, hefelt an unexpected chill in the air. Nonetheless, he continued.“Almighty Adonai, Arathron, Ashai, Elohim, Elohi, Elion, Asher Eheieh, Shaddai .. . be my aid, so that this blood may have power and efficacy in all wherein Ishall wish, and in all that I shall demand.”That night, he dreamed of birds . . . of a giant phoenix rising from a billowingfire. The next morning, he awoke with an energy he had not felt since childhood.He went running in the park, faster and farther than he’d imagined possible.When he could run no longer, he stopped to do pushups and sit-ups. Countlessrepetitions. Still he had energy.That night, again, he dreamed of the phoenix.Autumn had fallen again on Central Park, and the wildlife were scurrying aboutsearching for food for winter. Andros despised the cold, and yet his carefullyhidden traps were now overflowing with live rats and squirrels. He took themhome in his backpack, performing rituals of increasing complexity.Emanual, Massiach, Yod, He, Vaud . . . please find me worthy.The blood rituals fueled his vitality. Andros felt younger every day. Hecontinued to read day and night—ancient mystical texts, epic medieval poems, theearly philosophers—and the more he learned about the true nature of things, themore he realized that all hope for mankind was lost. They are blind . . .wandering aimlessly in a world they will never understand.Andros was still a man, but he sensed he was evolving into something else.Something greater. Something sacred. His massive physique had emerged fromdormancy, more powerful now than ever before. He finally understood its truepurpose. My body is but a vessel for my most potent treasure . . . my mind.Andros knew his true potential had not yet been realized, and he delved deeper.What is my destiny? All the ancient texts spoke of good and evil . . . and ofman’s need to choose between them. I made my choice long ago, he knew, and yethe felt no remorse. What is evil, if not a natural law? Darkness followed light.Chaos followed order. Entropy was fundamental. Everything decayed. The perfectlyordered crystal eventually turned into random particles of dust.There are those who create . . . and those who destroy.It was not until Andros read John Milton’s Paradise Lost that he saw his destinymaterialize before him. He read of the great fallen angel . . . the warriordemon who fought against the light . . . the valiant one . . . the angel calledMoloch.Moloch walked the earth as a god. The angel’s name, Andros later learned, whentranslated to the ancient tongue, became Mal’akh.And so shall I.Like all great transformations, this one had to begin with a sacrifice . . . butnot of rats, nor birds. No, this transformation required a true sacrifice.There is but one worthy sacrifice.Suddenly he had a sense of clarity unlike anything he had ever experienced inhis life. His entire destiny had materialized. For three straight days hesketched on an enormous sheet of paper. When he was done, he had created ablueprint of what he would become.He hung the life-size sketch on his wall and gazed into it as if into a mirror.I am a masterpiece.The next day, he took his drawing to the tattoo parlor.He was ready."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 78The George Washington Masonic Memorial stands atop Shuter’s Hill in Alexandria,Virginia. Built in three distinct tiers of increasing architectural complexityfrom bottom to top—Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian—the structure stands as aphysical symbol of man’s intellectual ascent. Inspired by the ancient Pharoslighthouse of Alexandria, Egypt, this soaring tower is capped by an Egyptianpyramid with a flamelike finial.Inside the spectacular marble foyer sits a massive bronze of George Washingtonin full Masonic regalia, along with the actual trowel he used to lay thecornerstone of the Capitol Building. Above the foyer, nine different levels bearnames like the Grotto, the Crypt Room, and the Knights Templar Chapel. Among thetreasures housed within these spaces are over twenty thousand volumes of Masonicwritings, a dazzling replica of the Ark of the Covenant, and even a scale modelof the throne room in King Solomon’s Temple.CIA agent Simkins checked his watch as the modified UH-60 chopper skimmed in lowover the Potomac. Six minutes until their train arrives. He exhaled and gazedout the window at the shining Masonic Memorial on the horizon. He had to admit,the brilliantly shining tower was as impressive as any building on the NationalMall. Simkins had never been inside the memorial, and tonight would be nodifferent. If all went according to plan, Robert Langdon and Katherine Solomonwould never make it out of the subway station.“Over there!” Simkins shouted to the pilot, pointing down at the King Streetsubway station across from the memorial. The pilot banked the helicopter and setit down on a grassy area at the foot of Shuter’s Hill.Pedestrians looked up in surprise as Simkins and his team piled out, dashedacross the street, and ran down into King Street Station. In the stairwell,several departing passengers leaped out of the way, plastering themselves to thewalls as the phalanx of armed men in black thundered past them.The King Street Station was larger than Simkins had anticipated, apparentlyserving several different lines—Blue, Yellow, and Amtrak. He raced over to theMetro map on the wall, found Freedom Plaza and the direct line to this location.“Blue Line, southbound platform!” Simkins shouted. “Get down there and cleareveryone out!” His team dashed off.Simkins rushed over to the ticket booth, flashed his identification, and shoutedto the woman inside. “The next train from Metro Center—what time is it due?!”The woman inside looked frightened. “I’m not sure. Blue Line arrives everyeleven minutes. There’s no set schedule.”“How long since the last train?”“Five . . . six minutes, maybe? No more than that.”Turner did the math. Perfect. The next train had to be Langdon’s.Inside a fast-moving subway car, Katherine Solomon shifted uncomfortably on thehard plastic seat. The bright fluorescent lights overhead hurt her eyes, and shefought the impulse to let her eyelids close, even for a second. Langdon satbeside her in the empty car, staring blankly down at the leather bag at hisfeet. His eyelids looked heavy, too, as if the rhythmic sway of the moving carwere lulling him into a trance.Katherine pictured the strange contents of Langdon’s bag. Why does the CIA wantthis pyramid? Bellamy had said that Sato might be pursuing the pyramid becauseshe knew its true potential. But even if this pyramid somehow did reveal thehiding place of ancient secrets, Katherine found it hard to believe that itspromise of primeval mystical wisdom would interest the CIA.Then again, she reminded herself, the CIA had been caught several times runningparapsychological or psi programs that bordered on ancient magic and mysticism.In 1995, the “Stargate/Scannate” scandal had exposed a classified CIA technologycalled remote viewing—a kind of telepathic mind travel that enabled a “viewer”to transport his mind’s eye to any location on earth and spy there, withoutbeing physically present. Of course, the technology was nothing new. Mysticscalled it astral projection, and yogis called it out-of-body experience.Unfortunately, horrified American taxpayers called it absurd, and the programhad been scuttled. At least publicly.Ironically, Katherine saw remarkable connections between the CIA’s failedprograms and her own breakthroughs in Noetic Science.Katherine felt eager to call the police and find out if they had discoveredanything in Kalorama Heights, but she and Langdon were phoneless now, and makingcontact with the authorities would probably be a mistake anyway; there was notelling how far Sato’s reach extended.Patience, Katherine. Within minutes, they would be in a safe hiding place,guests of a man who had assured them he could provide answers. Katherine hopedhis answers, whatever they might be, would help her save her brother.“Robert?” she whispered, glancing up at the subway map. “Next stop is ours.”Langdon emerged slowly from his daydream. “Right, thanks.” As the train rumbledtoward the station, he collected his daybag and gave Katherine an uncertainglance. “Let’s just hope our arrival is uneventful.”By the time Turner Simkins dashed down to join his men, the subway platform hadbeen entirely cleared, and his team was fanning out, taking up positions behindthe support pillars that ran the length of the platform. A distant rumble echoedin the tunnel at the other end of the platform, and as it grew louder, Simkinsfelt the push of stale warm air billowing around him.No escape, Mr. Langdon.Simkins turned to the two agents he had told to join him on the platform.“Identification and weapons out. These trains are automated, but they all have aconductor who opens the doors. Find him.”The train’s headlamp now appeared down the tunnel, and the sound of squealingbrakes pierced the air. As the train burst into the station and began slowingdown, Simkins and his two agents leaned out over the track, waving CIAidentification badges and straining to make eye contact with the conductorbefore he could open the doors.The train was closing fast. In the third car, Simkins finally saw the startledface of the conductor, who was apparently trying to figure out why three men inblack were all waving identification badges at him. Simkins jogged toward thetrain, which was now nearing a full stop.“CIA!” Simkins shouted, holding up his ID. “Do NOT open the doors!” As the trainglided slowly past him, he went toward the conductor’s car, shouting in at him.“Do not open your doors! Do you understand?! Do NOT open your doors!”The train came to a full stop, its wide-eyed conductor nodding repeatedly.“What’s wrong?!” the man demanded through his side window.“Don’t let this train move,” Simkins said. “And don’t open the doors.”“Okay.”“Can you let us into the first car?”The conductor nodded. Looking fearful, he stepped out of the train, closing thedoor behind him. He escorted Simkins and his men to the first car, where hemanually opened the door.“Lock it behind us,” Simkins said, pulling his weapon. Simkins and his menstepped quickly into the stark light of the first car. The conductor locked thedoor behind them.The first car contained only four passengers—three teenage boys and an oldwoman—all of whom looked understandably startled to see three armed menentering. Simkins held up his ID. “Everything’s fine. Just stay seated.”Simkins and his men now began their sweep, pushing toward the back of the sealedtrain one car at a time—“squeezing toothpaste,” as it was called during histraining at the Farm. Very few passengers were on this train, and halfway to theback, the agents still had seen nobody even remotely resembling the descriptionof Robert Langdon and Katherine Solomon. Nonetheless, Simkins remainedconfident. There was absolutely no place to hide on a subway car. No bathrooms,no storage, and no alternative exits. Even if the targets had seen them boardthe train and fled to the back, there was no way out. Prying open a door wasalmost impossible, and Simkins had men watching the platform and both sides ofthe train anyway.Patience.By the time Simkins reached the second-to-last car, however, he was feelingedgy. This penultimate car had only one passenger—a Chinese man. Simkins and hisagents moved through, scanning for any place to hide. There was none.“Last car,” Simkins said, raising his weapon as the threesome moved toward thethreshold of the train’s final section. As they stepped into the last car, allthree of them immediately stopped and stared.What the . . . ?! Simkins raced to the rear of the deserted cabin, searchingbehind all the seats. He spun back to his men, blood boiling. “Where the helldid they go?!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 79Eight miles due north of Alexandria, Virginia, Robert Langdon and KatherineSolomon strode calmly across a wide expanse of frost-covered lawn.“You should be an actress,” Langdon said, still impressed by Katherine’s quickthinking and improvisational skills.“You weren’t half bad yourself.” She gave him a smile.At first, Langdon had been mystified by Katherine’s abrupt antics in the taxi.Without warning, she had suddenly demanded they go to Freedom Plaza based onsome revelation about a Jewish star and the Great Seal of the United States. Shedrew a well-known conspiracy-theory image on a dollar bill and then insistedLangdon look closely where she was pointing.Finally, Langdon realized that Katherine was pointing not at the dollar bill butat a tiny indicator bulb on the back of the driver’s seat. The bulb was socovered with grime that he had not even noticed it. As he leaned forward,however, he could see that the bulb was illuminated, emitting a dull red glow.He could also see the two faint words directly beneath the lit bulb.—INTERCOM ON—Startled, Langdon glanced back at Katherine, whose frantic eyes were urging himto look into the front seat. He obeyed, stealing a discreet glance through thedivider. The cabby’s cell phone was on the dash, wide open, illuminated, facingthe intercom speaker. An instant later, Langdon understood Katherine’s actions.They know we’re in this cab . . . they’ve been listening to us.Langdon had no idea how much time he and Katherine had until their taxi wasstopped and surrounded, but he knew they had to act fast. Instantly, he’d begunplaying along, realizing that Katherine’s desire to go to Freedom Plaza hadnothing to do with the pyramid but rather with its being a large subwaystation—Metro Center—from which they could take the Red, Blue, or Orange linesin any of six different directions.They jumped out of the taxi at Freedom Plaza, and Langdon took over, doing someimprovising of his own, leaving a trail to the Masonic Memorial in Alexandriabefore he and Katherine ran down into the subway station, dashing past the BlueLine platforms and continuing on to the Red Line, where they caught a train inthe opposite direction.Traveling six stops northbound to Tenleytown, they emerged all alone into aquiet, upscale neighborhood. Their destination, the tallest structure for miles,was immediately visible on the horizon, just off Massachusetts Avenue on a vastexpanse of manicured lawn.Now “off the grid,” as Katherine called it, the two of them walked across thedamp grass. On their right was a medieval-style garden, famous for its ancientrosebushes and Shadow House gazebo. They moved past the garden, directly towardthe magnificent building to which they had been summoned. A refuge containingten stones from Mount Sinai, one from heaven itself, and one with the visage ofLuke’s dark father.“I’ve never been here at night,” Katherine said, gazing up at the brightly littowers. “It’s spectacular.”Langdon agreed, having forgotten how impressive this place truly was. Thisneo-Gothic masterpiece stood at the north end of Embassy Row. He hadn’t beenhere for years, not since writing a piece about it for a kids’ magazine in hopesof generating some excitement among young Americans to come see this amazinglandmark. His article—“Moses, Moon Rocks, and Star Wars”—had been part of thetourist literature for years.Washington National Cathedral, Langdon thought, feeling an unexpectedanticipation at being back after all these years. Where better to ask about OneTrue God?“This cathedral really has ten stones from Mount Sinai?” Katherine asked, gazingup at the twin bell towers.Langdon nodded. “Near the main altar. They symbolize the Ten Commandments givento Moses on Mount Sinai.”“And there’s a lunar rock?”A rock from heaven itself. “Yes. One of the stained-glass windows is called theSpace Window and has a fragment of moon rock embedded in it.”“Okay, but you can’t be serious about the last thing.” Katherine glanced over,her pretty eyes flashing skepticism. “A statue of . . . Darth Vader?”Langdon chuckled. “Luke Skywalker’s dark father? Absolutely. Vader is one of theNational Cathedral’s most popular grotesques.” He pointed high into the westtowers. “Tough to see him at night, but he’s there.”“What in the world is Darth Vader doing on Washington National Cathedral?”“A contest for kids to carve a gargoyle that depicted the face of evil. Darthwon.”They reached the grand staircase to the main entrance, which was set back in aneighty-foot archway beneath a breathtaking rose window. As they began climbing,Langdon’s mind shifted to the mysterious stranger who had called him. No names,please . . . Tell me, have you successfully protected the map that was entrustedto you? Langdon’s shoulder ached from carrying the heavy stone pyramid, and hewas looking forward to setting it down. Sanctuary and answers.As they approached the top of the stairs, they were met with an imposing pair ofwooden doors. “Do we just knock?” Katherine asked.Langdon had been wondering the same thing, except that now one of the doors wascreaking open.“Who’s there?” a frail voice said. The face of a withered old man appeared inthe doorway. He wore priest’s robes and a blank stare. His eyes were opaque andwhite, clouded with cataracts.“My name is Robert Langdon,” he replied. “Katherine Solomon and I are seekingsanctuary.”The blind man exhaled in relief. “Thank God. I’ve been expecting you.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 80Warren Bellamy felt a sudden ray of hope.Inside the Jungle, Director Sato had just received a phone call from a fieldagent and had immediately flown into a tirade. “Well, you damn well better findthem!” she shouted into her phone. “We’re running out of time!” She had hung upand was now stalking back and forth in front of Bellamy as if trying to decidewhat to do next.Finally, she stopped directly in front of him and turned. “Mr. Bellamy, I’mgoing to ask you this once, and only once.” She stared deep into his eyes. “Yesor no—do you have any idea where Robert Langdon might have gone?”Bellamy had more than a good idea, but he shook his head. “No.”Sato’s piercing gaze had never left his eyes. “Unfortunately, part of my job isto know when people are lying.”Bellamy averted his eyes. “Sorry, I can’t help you.”“Architect Bellamy,” Sato said, “tonight just after seven P.M., you were havingdinner in a restaurant outside the city when you received a phone call from aman who told you he had kidnapped Peter Solomon.”Bellamy felt an instant chill and returned his eyes to hers. How could youpossibly know that?!“The man,” Sato continued, “told you that he had sent Robert Langdon to theCapitol Building and given Langdon a task to complete . . . a task that requiredyour help. He warned that if Langdon failed in this task, your friend PeterSolomon would die. Panicked, you called all of Peter’s numbers but failed toreach him. Understandably, you then raced to the Capitol.”Bellamy could not imagine how Sato knew about this phone call.“As you fled the Capitol,” Sato said behind the smoldering tip of her cigarette,“you sent a text message to Solomon’s kidnapper, assuring him that you andLangdon had been successful in obtaining the Masonic Pyramid.”Where is she getting her information? Bellamy wondered. Not even Langdon knows Isent that text message. Immediately after entering the tunnel to the Library ofCongress, Bellamy had stepped into the electrical room to plug in theconstruction lighting. In the privacy of that moment, he had decided to send aquick text message to Solomon’s captor, telling him about Sato’s involvement,but reassuring him that he—Bellamy—and Langdon had obtained the Masonic Pyramidand would indeed cooperate with his demands. It was a lie, of course, butBellamy hoped the reassurance might buy time, both for Peter Solomon and also tohide the pyramid.“Who told you I sent a text?” Bellamy demanded.Sato tossed Bellamy’s cell phone on the bench next to him. “Hardly rocketscience.”Bellamy now remembered his phone and keys had been taken from him by the agentswho captured him.“As for the rest of my inside information,” Sato said, “the Patriot Act gives methe right to place a wiretap on the phone of anyone I consider a viable threatto national security. I consider Peter Solomon to be such a threat, and lastnight I took action.”Bellamy could barely get his mind around what she was telling him. “You’retapping Peter Solomon’s phone?”“Yes. This is how I knew the kidnapper called you at the restaurant. You calledPeter’s cell phone and left an anxious message explaining what had justhappened.”Bellamy realized she was right.“We had also intercepted a call from Robert Langdon, who was in the CapitolBuilding, deeply confused to learn he had been tricked into coming there. I wentto the Capitol at once, arriving before you because I was closer. As for how Iknew to check the X-ray of Langdon’s bag . . . in light of my realization thatLangdon was involved in all of this, I had my staff reexamine a seeminglyinnocuous early-morning call between Langdon and Peter Solomon’s cell phone, inwhich the kidnapper, posing as Solomon’s assistant, persuaded Langdon to comefor a lecture and also to bring a small package that Peter had entrusted to him.When Langdon was not forthcoming with me about the package he was carrying, Irequested the X-ray of his bag.”Bellamy could barely think. Admittedly, everything Sato was saying was feasible,and yet something was not adding up. “But . . . how could you possibly thinkPeter Solomon is a threat to national security?”“Believe me, Peter Solomon is a serious national-security threat,” she snapped.“And frankly, Mr. Bellamy, so are you.”Bellamy sat bolt upright, the handcuffs chafing against his wrists. “I beg yourpardon?!”She forced a smile. “You Masons play a risky game. You keep a very, verydangerous secret.”Is she talking about the Ancient Mysteries?“Thankfully, you’ve always done a good job of keeping your secrets hidden.Unfortunately, recently you’ve been careless, and tonight, your most dangeroussecret is about to be unveiled to the world. And unless we can stop that fromhappening, I assure you the results will be catastrophic.”Bellamy stared in bewilderment.“If you had not attacked me,” Sato said, “you would have realized that you and Iare on the same team.”The same team. The words sparked in Bellamy an idea that seemed almostimpossible to fathom. Is Sato a member of Eastern Star? The Order of the EasternStar—often considered a sister organization to the Masons—embraced a similarmystical philosophy of benevolence, secret wisdom, and spiritualopen-mindedness. The same team? I’m in handcuffs! She’s tapping Peter’s phone!“You will help me stop this man,” Sato said. “He has the potential to bringabout a cataclysm from which this country might not recover.” Her face was likestone.“Then why aren’t you tracking him?”Sato looked incredulous. “Do you think I’m not trying? My trace on Solomon’scell phone went dead before we got a location. His other number appears to be adisposable phone—which is almost impossible to track. The private-jet companytold us that Langdon’s flight was booked by Solomon’s assistant, on Solomon’scell phone, with Solomon’s Marquis Jet card. There is no trail. Not that itmatters anyway. Even if we find out exactly where he is, I can’t possibly riskmoving in and trying to grab him.”“Why not?!”“I’d prefer not to share that, as the information is classified,” Sato said,patience clearly waning. “I am asking you to trust me on this.”“Well, I don’t!”Sato’s eyes were like ice. She turned suddenly and shouted across the Jungle.“Agent Hartmann! The briefcase, please.”Bellamy heard the hiss of the electronic door, and an agent strode into theJungle. He was carrying a sleek titanium briefcase, which he set on the groundbeside the OS director.“Leave us,” Sato said.As the agent departed, the door hissed again, and then everything fell silent.Sato picked up the metal case, laid it across her lap, and popped the clasps.Then she raised her eyes slowly to Bellamy. “I did not want to do this, but ourtime is running out, and you’ve left me no choice.”Bellamy eyed the strange briefcase and felt a swell of fear. Is she going totorture me? He strained at his cuffs again. “What’s in that case?!”Sato smiled grimly. “Something that will persuade you to see things my way. Iguarantee it.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 81The subterranean space in which Mal’akh performed the Art was ingeniouslyhidden. His home’s basement, to those who entered, appeared quite normal—atypical cellar with boiler, fuse box, woodpile, and a hodgepodge of storage.This visible cellar, however, was only a portion of Mal’akh’s underground space.A sizable area had been walled off for his clandestine practices.Mal’akh’s private work space was a suite of small rooms, each with a specializedpurpose. The area’s sole entrance was a steep ramp secretly accessible throughhis living room, making the area’s discovery virtually impossible.Tonight, as Mal’akh descended the ramp, the tattooed sigils and signs on hisflesh seemed to come alive in the cerulean glow of his basement’s specializedlighting. Moving into the bluish haze, he walked past several closed doors andheaded directly for the largest room at the end of the corridor.The “sanctum sanctorum,” as Mal’akh liked to call it, was a perfect twelve-footsquare. Twelve are the signs of the zodiac. Twelve are the hours of the day.Twelve are the gates of heaven. In the center of the chamber was a stone table,a seven-by-seven square. Seven are the seals of Revelation. Seven are the stepsof the Temple. Centered over the table hung a carefully calibrated light sourcethat cycled through a spectrum of preordained colors, completing its cycle everysix hours in accordance with the sacred Table of Planetary Hours. The hour ofYanor is blue. The hour of Nasnia is red. The hour of Salam is white.Now was the hour of Caerra, meaning the light in the room had modulated to asoft purplish hue. Wearing only a silken loincloth wrapped around his buttocksand neutered sex organ, Mal’akh began his preparations.He carefully combined the suffumigation chemicals that he would later ignite tosanctify the air. Then he folded the virgin silk robe that he would eventuallydon in place of his loincloth. And finally, he purified a flask of water for theanointing of his offering. When he was done, he placed all of these preparedingredients on a side table.Next he went to a shelf and retrieved a small ivory box, which he carried to theside table and placed with the other items. Although he was not yet ready to useit, he could not resist opening the lid and admiring this treasure.The knife.Inside the ivory box, nestled in a cradle of black velvet, shone the sacrificialknife that Mal’akh had been saving for tonight. He had purchased it for $1.6million on the Middle Eastern antiquities black market last year.The most famous knife in history.Unimaginably old and believed lost, this precious blade was made of iron,attached to a bone handle. Over the ages, it had been in the possession ofcountless powerful individuals. In recent decades, however, it had disappeared,languishing in a secret private collection. Mal’akh had gone to enormous lengthsto obtain it. The knife, he suspected, had not drawn blood for decades . . .possibly centuries. Tonight, this blade would again taste the power of thesacrifice for which it was honed.Mal’akh gently lifted the knife from its cushioned compartment and reverentlypolished the blade with a silk cloth soaked in purified water. His skills hadprogressed greatly since his first rudimentary experiments in New York. The darkArt that Mal’akh practiced had been known by many names in many languages, butby any name, it was a precise science. This primeval technology had once heldthe key to the portals of power, but it had been banished long ago, relegated tothe shadows of occultism and magic. Those few who still practiced this Art wereconsidered madmen, but Mal’akh knew better. This is not work for those with dullfaculties. The ancient dark Art, like modern science, was a discipline involvingprecise formulas, specific ingredients, and meticulous timing.This Art was not the impotent black magic of today, often practicedhalfheartedly by curious souls. This Art, like nuclear physics, had thepotential to unleash enormous power. The warnings were dire: The unskilledpractitioner runs the risk of being struck by a reflux current and destroyed.Mal’akh finished admiring the sacred blade and turned his attention to a lonesheet of thick vellum lying on the table before him. He had made this vellumhimself from the skin of a baby lamb. As was the protocol, the lamb was pure,having not yet reached sexual maturity. Beside the vellum was a quill pen he hadmade from the feather of a crow, a silver saucer, and three glimmering candlesarranged around a solid-brass bowl. The bowl contained one inch of thick crimsonliquid.The liquid was Peter Solomon’s blood.Blood is the tincture of eternity.Mal’akh picked up the quill pen, placed his left hand on the vellum, and dippingthe quill tip in the blood, he carefully traced the outline of his open palm.When he was done, he added the five symbols of the Ancient Mysteries, one oneach fingertip of the drawing.The crown . . . to represent the king I shall become.The star . . . to represent the heavens which have ordained my destiny.The sun . . . to represent the illumination of my soul.The lantern . . . to represent the feeble light of human understanding.And the key . . . to represent the missing piece, that which tonight I shall atlast possess.Mal’akh completed his blood tracing and held up the vellum, admiring his work inthe light of the three candles. He waited until the blood was dry and thenfolded the thick vellum three times. While chanting an ethereal ancientincantation, Mal’akh touched the vellum to the third candle, and it burst intoflames. He set the flaming vellum on the silver saucer and let it burn. As itdid, the carbon in the animal skin dissolved to a powdery black char. When theflame went out, Mal’akh carefully tapped the ashes into the brass bowl of blood.Then he stirred the mixture with the crow’s feather.The liquid turned a deeper crimson, nearly black.Holding the bowl in both palms, Mal’akh raised it over his head and gave thanks,intoning the blood eukharistos of the ancients. Then he carefully poured theblackened mixture into a glass vial and corked it. This would be the ink withwhich Mal’akh would inscribe the untattooed flesh atop his head and complete hismasterpiece."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 82Washington National Cathedral is the sixth-largest cathedral in the world andsoars higher than a thirty-story skyscraper. Embellished with over two hundredstained-glass windows, a fifty-three-bell carillon, and a 10,647-pipe organ,this Gothic masterpiece can accommodate more than three thousand worshippers.Tonight, however, the great cathedral was deserted.Reverend Colin Galloway—dean of the cathedral—looked like he had been aliveforever. Stooped and withered, he wore a simple black cassock and shuffledblindly ahead without a word. Langdon and Katherine followed in silence throughthe darkness of the four-hundred-foot-long nave’s central aisle, which wascurved ever so slightly to the left to create a softening optical illusion. Whenthey reached the Great Crossing, the dean guided them through the roodscreen—the symbolic divider between the public area and the sanctuary beyond.The scent of frankincense hung in the air of the chancel. This sacred space wasdark, illuminated only by indirect reflections in the foliated vaults overhead.Flags of the fifty states hung above the quire, which was ornately appointedwith several carved reredos depicting biblical events. Dean Galloway continuedon, apparently knowing this walk by heart. For a moment, Langdon thought theywere headed straight for the high altar, where the ten stones from Mount Sinaiwere embedded, but the old dean finally turned left and groped his way through adiscreetly hidden door that led into an administrative annex.They moved down a short hallway to an office door bearing a brass nameplate:THE REVEREND DR. COLIN GALLOWAYCATHEDRAL DEANGalloway opened the door and turned on the lights, apparently accustomed toremembering this courtesy for his guests. He ushered them in and closed thedoor.The dean’s office was small but elegant, with high bookshelves, a desk, a carvedarmoire, and a private bathroom. On the walls hung sixteenth-century tapestriesand several religious paintings. The old dean motioned to the two leather chairsdirectly opposite his desk. Langdon sat with Katherine and felt grateful finallyto set his heavy shoulder bag on the floor at his feet.Sanctuary and answers, Langdon thought, settling into the comfortable chair.The aged man shuffled around behind his desk and eased himself down into hishigh-backed chair. Then, with a weary sigh, he raised his head, staring blanklyout at them through clouded eyes. When he spoke, his voice was unexpectedlyclear and strong.“I realize we have never met,” the old man said, “and yet I feel I know youboth.” He took out a handkerchief and dabbed his mouth. “Professor Langdon, I amfamiliar with your writings, including the clever piece you did on the symbolismof this cathedral. And, Ms. Solomon, your brother, Peter, and I have beenMasonic brothers for many years now.”“Peter is in terrible trouble,” Katherine said.“So I have been told.” The old man sighed. “And I will do everything in my powerto help you.”Langdon saw no Masonic ring on the dean’s finger, and yet he knew many Masons,especially those within the clergy, chose not to advertise their affiliation.As they began to talk, it became clear that Dean Galloway already knew some ofthe night’s events from Warren Bellamy’s phone message. As Langdon and Katherinefilled him in on the rest, the dean looked more and more troubled.“And this man who has taken our beloved Peter,” the dean said, “he is insistingyou decipher the pyramid in exchange for Peter’s life?”“Yes,” Langdon said. “He thinks it’s a map that will lead him to the hidingplace of the Ancient Mysteries.”The dean turned his eerie, opaque eyes toward Langdon. “My ears tell me you donot believe in such things.”Langdon did not want to waste time going down this road. “It doesn’t matter whatI believe. We need to help Peter. Unfortunately, when we deciphered the pyramid,it pointed nowhere.”The old man sat straighter. “You’ve deciphered the pyramid?”Katherine interceded now, quickly explaining that despite Bellamy’s warnings andher brother’s request that Langdon not unwrap the package, she had done so,feeling her first priority was to help her brother however she could. She toldthe dean about the golden capstone, Albrecht Dürer’s magic square, and how itdecrypted the sixteen-letter Masonic cipher into the phrase Jeova Sanctus Unus.“That’s all it says?” the dean asked. “One True God?”“Yes, sir,” Langdon replied. “Apparently the pyramid is more of a metaphoricalmap than a geographic one.”The dean held out his hands. “Let me feel it.”Langdon unzipped his bag and pulled out the pyramid, which he carefully hoistedup on the desk, setting it directly in front of the reverend.Langdon and Katherine watched as the old man’s frail hands examined every inchof the stone—the engraved side, the smooth base, and the truncated top. When hewas finished, he held out his hands again. “And the capstone?”Langdon retrieved the small stone box, set it on the desk, and opened the lid.Then he removed the capstone and placed it into the old man’s waiting hands. Thedean performed a similar examination, feeling every inch, pausing on thecapstone’s engraving, apparently having some trouble reading the small,elegantly inscribed text.“‘The secret hides within The Order,’” Langdon offered. “And the words the andorder are capitalized.”The old man’s face was expressionless as he positioned the capstone on top ofthe pyramid and aligned it by sense of touch. He seemed to pause a moment, as ifin prayer, and reverently ran his palms over the complete pyramid several times.Then he reached out and located the cube-shaped box, taking it in his hands,feeling it carefully, his fingers probing inside and out.When he was done, he set down the box and leaned back in his chair. “So tellme,” he demanded, his voice suddenly stern. “Why have you come to me?”The question took Langdon off guard. “We came, sir, because you told us to. AndMr. Bellamy said we should trust you.”“And yet you did not trust him?”“I’m sorry?”The dean’s white eyes stared directly through Langdon. “The package containingthe capstone was sealed. Mr. Bellamy told you not to open it, and yet you did.In addition, Peter Solomon himself told you not to open it. And yet you did.”“Sir,” Katherine intervened, “we were trying to help my brother. The man who hashim demanded we decipher—”“I can appreciate that,” the dean declared, “and yet what have you achieved byopening the package? Nothing. Peter’s captor is looking for a location, and hewill not be satisfied with the answer of Jeova Sanctus Unus.”“I agree,” Langdon said, “but unfortunately that’s all the pyramid says. As Imentioned, the map seems to be more figurative than—”“You’re mistaken, Professor,” the dean said. “The Masonic Pyramid is a real map.It points to a real location. You do not understand that, because you have notyet deciphered the pyramid fully. Not even close.”Langdon and Katherine exchanged startled looks.The dean laid his hands back on the pyramid, almost caressing it. “This map,like the Ancient Mysteries themselves, has many layers of meaning. Its truesecret remains veiled from you.”“Dean Galloway,” Langdon said, “we’ve been over every inch of the pyramid andcapstone, and there’s nothing else to see.”“Not in its current state, no. But objects change.”“Sir?”“Professor, as you know, the promise of this pyramid is one of miraculoustransformative power. Legend holds that this pyramid can change its shape . . .alter its physical form to reveal its secrets. Like the famed stone thatreleased Excalibur into the hands of King Arthur, the Masonic Pyramid cantransform itself if it so chooses . . . and reveal its secret to the worthy.”Langdon now sensed that the old man’s advanced years had perhaps robbed him ofhis faculties. “I’m sorry, sir. Are you saying this pyramid can undergo aliteral physical transformation?”“Professor, if I were to reach out with my hand and transform this pyramid rightbefore your eyes, would you believe what you had witnessed?”Langdon had no idea how to respond. “I suppose I would have no choice.”“Very well, then. In a moment, I shall do exactly that.” He dabbed his mouthagain. “Let me remind you that there was an era when even the brightest mindsperceived the earth as flat. For if the earth were round, then surely the oceanswould spill off. Imagine how they would have mocked you if you proclaimed, ‘Notonly is the world a sphere, but there is an invisible, mystical force that holdseverything to its surface’!”“There’s a difference,” Langdon said, “between the existence of gravity . . .and the ability to transform objects with a touch of your hand.”“Is there? Is it not possible that we are still living in the Dark Ages, stillmocking the suggestion of ‘mystical’ forces that we cannot see or comprehend.History, if it has taught us anything at all, has taught us that the strangeideas we deride today will one day be our celebrated truths. I claim I cantransform this pyramid with a touch of my finger, and you question my sanity. Iwould expect more from an historian. History is replete with great minds whohave all proclaimed the same thing . . . great minds who have all insisted thatman possesses mystical abilities of which he is unaware.”Langdon knew the dean was correct. The famous Hermetic aphorism—Know ye not thatye are gods?—was one of the pillars of the Ancient Mysteries. As above, so below. . . Man created in God’s image . . . Apotheosis. This persistent message ofman’s own divinity—of his hidden potential—was the recurring theme in theancient texts of countless traditions. Even the Holy Bible cried out in Psalms82:6: Ye are gods!“Professor,” the old man said, “I realize that you, like many educated people,live trapped between worlds—one foot in the spiritual, one foot in the physical.Your heart yearns to believe . . . but your intellect refuses to permit it. Asan academic, you would be wise to learn from the great minds of history.” Hepaused and cleared his throat. “If I’m remembering correctly, one of thegreatest minds ever to live proclaimed: ‘That which is impenetrable to us reallyexists. Behind the secrets of nature remains something subtle, intangible, andinexplicable. Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehendis my religion.’ ”“Who said that?” Langdon said. “Gandhi?”“No,” Katherine interjected. “Albert Einstein.”Katherine Solomon had read every word Einstein had ever written and was struckby his profound respect for the mystical, as well as his predictions that themasses would one day feel the same. The religion of the future, Einstein hadpredicted, will be a cosmic religion. It will transcend personal God and avoiddogma and theology.Robert Langdon appeared to be struggling with the idea. Katherine could sensehis rising frustration with the old Episcopal priest, and she understood. Afterall, they had traveled here for answers, and they had found instead a blind manwho claimed he could transform objects with a touch of his hands. Even so, theold man’s overt passion for mystical forces reminded Katherine of her brother.“Father Galloway,” Katherine said, “Peter is in trouble. The CIA is chasing us.And Warren Bellamy sent us to you for help. I don’t know what this pyramid saysor where it points, but if deciphering it means that we can help Peter, we needto do that. Mr. Bellamy may have preferred to sacrifice my brother’s life tohide this pyramid, but my family has experienced nothing but pain because of it.Whatever secret it may hold, it ends tonight.”“You are correct,” the old man replied, his tone dire. “It will all end tonight.You’ve guaranteed that.” He sighed. “Ms. Solomon, when you broke the seal onthat box, you set in motion a series of events from which there will be noreturn. There are forces at work tonight that you do not yet comprehend. Thereis no turning back.”Katherine stared dumbfounded at the reverend. There was something apocalypticabout his tone, as if he were referring to the Seven Seals of Revelation orPandora’s box.“Respectfully, sir,” Langdon interceded, “I can’t imagine how a stone pyramidcould set in motion anything at all.”“Of course you can’t, Professor.” The old man stared blindly through him. “Youdo not yet have eyes to see.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 83In the moist air of the Jungle, the Architect of the Capitol could feel thesweat now rolling down his back. His handcuffed wrists ached, but all of hisattention remained riveted on the ominous titanium briefcase that Sato had justopened on the bench between them.The contents of this case, Sato had told him, will persuade you to see things myway. I guarantee it.The tiny Asian woman had unclasped the metal case away from Bellamy’s line ofsight, and he had yet to see its contents, but his imagination was running wild.Sato’s hands were doing something inside the case, and Bellamy half expected herto extract a series of glistening, razor-sharp tools.Suddenly a light source flickered inside the case, growing brighter,illuminating Sato’s face from beneath. Her hands kept moving inside, and thelight changed hue. After a few moments, she removed her hands, grasped theentire case, and turned it toward Bellamy so he could see inside.Bellamy found himself squinting into the glow of what appeared to be some kindof futuristic laptop with a handheld phone receiver, two antennae, and a doublekeyboard. His initial surge of relief turned quickly to confusion.The screen bore the CIA logo and the text:SECURE LOG-INUSER: INOUE SATOSECURITY CLEARANCE: LEVEL 5Beneath the laptop’s log-in window, a progress icon was spinning:ONE MOMENT PLEASE . . .DECRYPTING FILE . . .Bellamy’s gaze shot back up to Sato, whose eyes were locked on his. “I had notwanted to show you this,” she said. “But you’ve left me no choice.”The screen flickered again, and Bellamy glanced back down as the file opened,its contents filling the entire LCD.For several moments, Bellamy stared at the screen, trying to make sense of whathe was looking at. Gradually, as it began to dawn on him, he felt the blooddraining from his face. He stared in horror, unable to look away. “But this is .. . impossible!” he exclaimed. “How . . . could this be!”Sato’s face was grim. “You tell me, Mr. Bellamy. You tell me.”As the Architect of the Capitol began to fully comprehend the ramifications ofwhat he was seeing, he could feel his entire world teetering precariously on thebrink of disaster.My God . . . I’ve made a terrible, terrible mistake!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 84Dean Galloway felt alive.Like all mortals, he knew the time was coming when he would shed his mortalshell, but tonight was not the night. His corporeal heart was beating strong andfast . . . and his mind felt sharp. There is work to be done.As he ran his arthritic hands across the pyramid’s smooth surfaces, he couldscarcely believe what he was feeling. I never imagined I would live to witnessthis moment. For generations, the pieces of the symbolon map had been keptsafely apart from one another. Now they were united at last. Galloway wonderedif this was the foretold time.Strangely, fate had selected two non-Masons to assemble the pyramid. Somehow,this seemed fitting. The Mysteries are moving out of the inner circles . . . outof darkness . . . into the light.“Professor,” he said, turning his head in the direction of Langdon’s breathing.“Did Peter tell you why he wanted you to watch over the little package?”“He said powerful people wanted to steal it from him,” Langdon replied.The dean nodded. “Yes, Peter told me the same thing.”“He did?” Katherine said suddenly on his left. “You and my brother spoke aboutthis pyramid?”“Of course,” Galloway said. “Your brother and I have spoken on many things. Iwas once the Worshipful Master at the House of the Temple, and he comes to mefor guidance at times. It was about a year ago that he came to me, deeplytroubled. He sat exactly where you are now, and he asked me if I believed insupernatural premonitions.”“Premonitions?” Katherine sounded concerned. “You mean like . . . visions?”“Not exactly. It was more visceral. Peter said he was feeling the growingpresence of a dark force in his life. He sensed something was watching him . . .waiting . . . intending to do him great harm.”“Obviously he was right,” Katherine said, “considering that the same man whokilled our mother and Peter’s son had come to Washington and become one ofPeter’s own Masonic brothers.”“True,” Langdon said, “but it doesn’t explain the involvement of the CIA.”Galloway was not so sure. “Men in power are always interested in greater power.”“But . . . the CIA?” Langdon challenged. “And mystical secrets? Somethingdoesn’t add up.”“Sure it does,” Katherine said. “The CIA thrives on technological advancementand has always experimented with the mystical sciences—ESP, remote viewing,sensory deprivation, pharmacologically induced highly mentalized states. It’sall the same thing—tapping the unseen potential of the human mind. If there’sone thing I’ve learned from Peter, it’s this: Science and mysticism are veryclosely related, distinguishable only by their approaches. They have identicalgoals . . . but different methods.”“Peter tells me,” Galloway said, “that your field of study is a kind of modernmystical science?”“Noetics,” Katherine said, nodding. “And it’s proving man has powers unlikeanything we can imagine.” She motioned to a stained-glass window depicting thefamiliar image of the “Luminous Jesus,” that of Christ with rays of lightflowing from his head and hands. “In fact, I just used a supercooledcharge-coupled device to photograph the hands of a faith healer at work. Thephotos looked a lot like the image of Jesus in your stained-glass window . . .streams of energy pouring through the healer’s fingertips.”The well-trained mind, Galloway thought, hiding a smile. How do you think Jesushealed the sick?“I realize,” Katherine said, “that modern medicine ridicules healers andshamans, but I saw this with my own eyes. My CCD cameras clearly photographedthis man transmitting a massive energy field from his fingertips . . . andliterally changing the cellular makeup of his patient. If that’s not godlikepower, then I don’t know what is.”Dean Galloway let himself smile. Katherine had the same fiery passion as herbrother. “Peter once compared Noetic Scientists to the early explorers who weremocked for embracing the heretical notion of a spherical earth. Almostovernight, these explorers went from fools to heroes, discovering unchartedworlds and expanding the horizons of everyone on the planet. Peter thinks youwill do this as well. He has very high hopes for your work. After all, everygreat philosophical shift in history began with a single bold idea.”Galloway knew, of course, that one needn’t go to a lab to witness proof of thisbold new idea, this proposal of man’s untapped potential. This very cathedralheld healing prayer circles for the sick, and repeatedly had witnessed trulymiraculous results, medically documented physical transformations. The questionwas not whether God had imbued man with great powers . . . but rather how weliberate those powers.The old dean placed his hands reverently around the sides of the Masonic Pyramidand spoke very quietly. “My friends, I do not know exactly where this pyramidpoints . . . but I do know this. There is a great spiritual treasure buried outthere somewhere . . . a treasure that has waited patiently in darkness forgenerations. I believe it is a catalyst that has the power to transform thisworld.” He now touched the golden tip of the capstone. “And now that thispyramid is assembled . . . the time is fast approaching. And why shouldn’t it?The promise of a great transformational enlightenment has been prophesiedforever.”“Father,” Langdon said, his tone challenging, “we’re all familiar with theRevelation of Saint John and the literal meaning of the Apocalypse, but biblicalprophecy hardly seems—”“Oh, heavens, the Book of Revelation is a mess!” the dean said. “Nobody knowshow to read that. I’m talking about clear minds writing in clear language—thepredictions of Saint Augustine, Sir Francis Bacon, Newton, Einstein, the listgoes on and on, all anticipating a transformative moment of enlightenment. EvenJesus himself said, ‘Nothing is hidden that will not be made known, nor secretthat will not come to light.’”“It’s a safe prediction to make,” Langdon said. “Knowledge grows exponentially.The more we know, the greater our ability to learn, and the faster we expand ourknowledge base.”“Yes,” Katherine added. “We see this in science all the time. Each newtechnology we invent becomes a tool with which to invent new technologies . . .and it snowballs. That’s why science has advanced more in the last five yearsthan in the previous five thousand. Exponential growth. Mathematically, as timepasses, the exponential curve of progress becomes almost vertical, and newdevelopment occurs incredibly fast.”Silence fell in the dean’s office, and Galloway sensed that his two guests stillhad no idea how this pyramid could possibly help them reveal anything further.That is why fate brought you to me, he thought. I have a role to play.For many years, the Reverend Colin Galloway, along with his Masonic brothers,had played the role of gatekeeper. Now it was all changing.I am no longer a gatekeeper . . . I am a guide.“Professor Langdon?” Galloway said, reaching out across his desk. “Take my handif you will.”Robert Langdon felt uncertain as he stared across at Dean Galloway’soutstretched palm.Are we going to pray?Politely, Langdon reached out and placed his right hand in the dean’s witheredhand. The old man grasped it firmly but did not begin to pray. Instead, he foundLangdon’s index finger and guided it downward into the stone box that had oncehoused the golden capstone.“Your eyes have blinded you,” the dean said. “If you saw with your fingertips asI do, you would realize this box has something left to teach you.”Dutifully, Langdon worked his fingertip around the inside of the box, but hefelt nothing. The inside was perfectly smooth.“Keep looking,” Galloway prompted.Finally, Langdon’s fingertip felt something—a tiny raised circle—a minuscule dotin the center of the base of the box. He removed his hand and peered inside. Thelittle circle was virtually invisible to the naked eye. What is that?“Do you recognize that symbol?” Galloway asked.“Symbol?” Langdon replied. “I can barely see anything at all.”“Push down on it.”Langdon did as he asked, pressing his fingertip down onto the spot. What does hethink will happen?“Hold your finger down,” the dean said. “Apply pressure.”Langdon glanced over at Katherine, who looked puzzled as she tucked a wisp ofhair behind her ears.A few seconds later, the old dean finally nodded. “Okay, remove your hand. Thealchemy is complete.”Alchemy? Robert Langdon removed his hand from the stone box and sat inbewildered silence. Nothing had changed at all. The box just sat there on thedesk.“Nothing,” Langdon said.“Look at your fingertip,” the dean replied. “You should see a transformation.”Langdon looked at his finger, but the only transformation he could see was thathe now had an indentation on his skin made by the circular nubbin—a tiny circlewith a dot in the middle.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_019_r1.jpg]“Now do you recognize this symbol?” the dean asked.Although Langdon recognized the symbol, he was more impressed that the dean hadbeen able to feel the detail of it. Seeing with one’s fingertips was apparentlya learned skill.“It’s alchemical,” Katherine said, sliding her chair closer and examiningLangdon’s finger. “It’s the ancient symbol for gold.”“Indeed it is.” The dean smiled and patted the box. “Professor, congratulations.You have just achieved what every alchemist in history has strived for. From aworthless substance, you’ve created gold.”Langdon frowned, unimpressed. The little parlor trick seemed to be no help atall. “An interesting idea, sir, but I’m afraid this symbol—a circle with a rounddot in the middle—has dozens of meanings. It’s called a circumpunct, and it’sone of the most widely used symbols in history.”“What are you talking about?” the dean asked, sounding skeptical.Langdon was stunned that a Mason was not more familiar with the spiritualimportance of this symbol. “Sir, the circumpunct has countless meanings. Inancient Egypt, it was the symbol for Ra—the sun god—and modern astronomy stilluses it as the solar symbol. In Eastern philosophy, it represents the spiritualinsight of the Third Eye, the divine rose, and the sign of illumination. TheKabbalists use it to symbolize the Kether—the highest Sephiroth and ‘the mosthidden of all hidden things.’ Early mystics called it the Eye of God and it’sthe origin of the All-Seeing Eye on the Great Seal. The Pythagoreans used thecircumpunct as the symbol of the Monad—the Divine Truth, the Prisca Sapientia,the at-one-ment of mind and soul, and the—”“Enough!” Dean Galloway was chuckling now. “Professor, thank you. You arecorrect, of course.”Langdon now realized he had just been played. He knew all that.“The circumpunct,” Galloway said, still smiling to himself, “is essentially thesymbol of the Ancient Mysteries. For this reason, I would suggest that itspresence in this box is not mere coincidence. Legend holds that the secrets ofthis map are hidden in the smallest of details.”“Fine,” Katherine said, “but even if this symbol was inscribed thereintentionally, it doesn’t bring us any closer to deciphering the map, does it?”“You mentioned earlier that the wax seal you broke was embossed with Peter’sring?”“That’s correct.”“And you said you have that ring with you?”“I do.” Langdon reached into his pocket, found the ring, took it out of theplastic bag, and placed it on the desk in front of the dean.Galloway picked up the ring and began feeling its surfaces. “This unique ringwas created at the same time as the Masonic Pyramid, and traditionally, it isworn by the Mason in charge of protecting the pyramid. Tonight, when I felt thetiny circumpunct on the bottom of the stone box, I realized that the ring is, infact, part of the symbolon.”“It is?”“I’m certain of it. Peter is my closest friend, and he wore this ring for manyyears. I am quite familiar with it.” He handed the ring to Langdon. “See foryourself.”Langdon took the ring and examined it, running his fingers over thedouble-headed phoenix, the number 33, the words ORDO AB CHAO, and also the wordsAll is revealed at the thirty-third degree. He felt nothing helpful. Then, ashis fingers traced down around the outside of the band, he stopped short.Startled, he turned the ring over and eyed the very bottom of its band.“Did you find it?” Galloway said.“I think so, yes!” Langdon said.Katherine slid her chair closer. “What?”“The degree sign on the band,” Langdon said, showing her. “It’s so small thatyou don’t really notice it with your eyes, but if you feel it, you can tell it’sactually indented—like a tiny circular incision.” The degree sign was centeredon the bottom of the band . . . and admittedly looked to be the same size as theraised nubbin in the bottom of the cube.“Is it the same size?” Katherine moved closer still, sounding excited now.“There’s one way to find out.” He took the ring and lowered it into the box,aligning the two tiny circles. As he pushed down, the raised circle on the boxslid into the ring’s opening, and there was a faint but decisive click.They all jumped.Langdon waited, but nothing happened.“What was that?!” the priest said.“Nothing,” Katherine replied. “The ring locked into place . . . but nothing elsehappened.”“No great transformation?” Galloway looked puzzled.We’re not done, Langdon realized, gazing down at the ring’s embossed insignia—adouble-headed phoenix and the number 33. All is revealed at the thirty-thirddegree. His mind filled with thoughts of Pythagoras, sacred geometry, andangles; he wondered if perhaps degrees had a mathematical meaning.Slowly, heart beating faster now, he reached down and grasped the ring, whichwas affixed to the base of the cube. Then, slowly, he began turning the ring tothe right. All is revealed at the thirty-third degree.He turned the ring ten degrees . . . twenty degrees . . . thirty degrees—What happened next, Langdon never saw coming."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 85Transformation.Dean Galloway heard it happen, and so he didn’t need to see it.Across the desk from him, Langdon and Katherine were dead silent, no doubtstaring in mute astonishment at the stone cube, which had just transformeditself loudly before their very eyes.Galloway couldn’t help but smile. He had anticipated the result, and although hestill had no idea how this development would ultimately help them solve theriddle of the pyramid, he was enjoying the rare chance to teach a Harvardsymbologist something about symbols.“Professor,” the dean said, “few people realize that the Masons venerate theshape of the cube—or ashlar, as we call it—because it is a three-dimensionalrepresentation of another symbol . . . a much older, two-dimensional symbol.”Galloway didn’t need to ask if the professor recognized the ancient symbol nowlying before them on the desk. It was one of the most famous symbols in theworld.Robert Langdon’s thoughts churned as he stared at the transformed box on thedesk in front of him. I had no idea . . .Moments ago, he had reached into the stone box, grasped the Masonic ring, andgently turned it. As he rotated the ring through thirty-three degrees, the cubehad suddenly changed before his eyes. The square panels that made up the sidesof the box fell away from one another as their hidden hinges released. The boxcollapsed all at once, its side panels and lid falling outward, slapping loudlyon the desk.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_020_r1.jpg]The cube becomes a cross, Langdon thought. Symbolic alchemy.Katherine looked bewildered by the sight of the collapsed cube. “The MasonicPyramid relates to . . . Christianity?”For a moment, Langdon had wondered the same thing. After all, the Christiancrucifix was a respected symbol within the Masons, and certainly there wereplenty of Christian Masons. However, Masons were also Jews, Muslims, Buddhists,Hindus, and those who had no name for their God. The presence of an exclusivelyChristian symbol seemed restrictive. Then the true meaning of this symbol haddawned on him.“It’s not a crucifix,” Langdon said, standing up now. “The cross with thecircumpunct in the middle is a binary symbol—two symbols fused to create one.”“What are you saying?” Katherine’s eyes followed him as he paced the room.“The cross,” Langdon said, “was not a Christian symbol until the fourth century.Long before that, it was used by the Egyptians to represent the intersection oftwo dimensions—the human and the celestial. As above, so below. It was a visualrepresentation of the juncture where man and God become one.”“Okay.”“The circumpunct,” Langdon said, “we already know has many meanings—one of itsmost esoteric being the rose, the alchemical symbol for perfection. But, whenyou place a rose on the center of a cross, you create another symbolentirely—the Rose Cross.”Galloway reclined in his chair, smiling. “My, my. Now you’re cooking.”Katherine stood now, too. “What am I missing?”“The Rose Cross,” Langdon explained, “is a common symbol in Freemasonry. Infact, one of the degrees of the Scottish Rite is called ‘Knights of the RoseCross’ and honors the early Rosicrucians, who contributed to Masonic mysticalphilosophy. Peter may have mentioned the Rosicrucians to you. Dozens of greatscientists were members—John Dee, Elias Ashmole, Robert Fludd—”“Absolutely,” Katherine said. “I’ve read all of the Rosicrucian manifestos in myresearch.”Every scientist should, Langdon thought. The Order of the Rose Cross—or moreformally the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis—had an enigmatic historythat had greatly influenced science and closely paralleled the legend of theAncient Mysteries . . . early sages possessing secret wisdom that was passeddown through the ages and studied by only the brightest minds. Admittedly,history’s list of famous Rosicrucians was a who’s who of European Renaissanceluminaries: Paracelsus, Bacon, Fludd, Descartes, Pascal, Spinoza, Newton,Leibniz.According to Rosicrucian doctrine, the order was “built on esoteric truths ofthe ancient past,” truths which had to be “concealed from the average man” andwhich promised great insight into “the spiritual realm.” The brotherhood’ssymbol had blossomed over the years into a flowering rose on an ornate cross,but it had begun as a more modest dotted circle on an unadorned cross—thesimplest manifestation of the rose on the simplest manifestation of the cross.“Peter and I often discuss Rosicrucian philosophy,” Galloway told Katherine.As the dean began outlining the interrelationship between Masonry andRosicrucianism, Langdon felt his attention drawn back to the same naggingthought he’d had all night. Jeova Sanctus Unus. This phrase is linked to alchemysomehow. He still could not remember exactly what Peter had told him about thephrase, but for some reason, the mention of Rosicrucianism seemed to haverekindled the thought. Think, Robert!“The Rosicrucian founder,” Galloway was saying, “was allegedly a German mysticwho went by the name Christian Rosenkreuz—a pseudonym obviously, perhaps evenfor Francis Bacon, who some historians believe founded the group himself,although there is no proof of—”“A pseudonym!” Langdon declared suddenly, startling even himself. “That’s it!Jeova Sanctus Unus! It’s a pseudonym!”“What are you talking about?” Katherine demanded.Langdon’s pulse had quickened now. “All night, I’ve been trying to remember whatPeter told me about Jeova Sanctus Unus and its relationship to alchemy. FinallyI remembered! It’s not about alchemy so much as about an alchemist! A veryfamous alchemist!”Galloway chuckled. “It’s about time, Professor. I mentioned his name twice andalso the word pseudonym.”Langdon stared at the old dean. “You knew?”“Well, I had my suspicions when you told me the engraving said Jeova SanctusUnus and had been decrypted using Dürer’s alchemical magic square, but when youfound the Rose Cross, I was certain. As you probably know, the personal papersof the scientist in question included a very heavily annotated copy of theRosicrucian manifestos.”“Who?” Katherine asked.“One of the world’s greatest scientists!” Langdon replied. “He was an alchemist,a member of the Royal Society of London, a Rosicrucian, and he signed some ofhis most secretive science papers with a pseudonym—‘Jeova Sanctus Unus’!”“One True God?” Katherine said. “Modest guy.”“Brilliant guy, actually,” Galloway corrected. “He signed his name that waybecause, like the ancient Adepts, he understood himself as divine. In addition,because the sixteen letters in Jeova Sanctus Unus could be rearranged to spellhis name in Latin, making it a perfect pseudonym.”Katherine now looked puzzled. “Jeova Sanctus Unus is an anagram of a famousalchemist’s name in Latin?”Langdon grabbed a piece of paper and pencil off the dean’s desk, writing as hetalked. “Latin interchanges the letters J for I and the letter V for U, whichmeans Jeova Sanctus Unus can actually be perfectly rearranged to spell thisman’s name.”Langdon wrote down sixteen letters: Isaacus Neutonuus.He handed the slip of paper to Katherine and said, “I think you’ve heard ofhim.”“Isaac Newton?” Katherine demanded, looking at the paper. “That’s what theengraving on the pyramid was trying to tell us!”For a moment, Langdon was back in Westminster Abbey, standing at Newton’spyramidical tomb, where he had experienced a similar epiphany. And tonight, thegreat scientist surfaces again. It was no coincidence, of course . . . thepyramids, mysteries, science, hidden knowledge . . . it was all intertwined.Newton’s name had always been a recurring guidepost for those seeking secretknowledge.“Isaac Newton,” Galloway said, “must have something to do with how to decipherthe meaning of the pyramid. I can’t imagine what it would be, but—”“Genius!” Katherine exclaimed, her eyes going wide. “That’s how we transform thepyramid!”“You understand?” Langdon said.“Yes!” she said. “I can’t believe we didn’t see it! It has been staring us rightin the face. A simple alchemical process. I can transform this pyramid usingbasic science! Newtonian science!”Langdon strained to understand.“Dean Galloway,” Katherine said. “If you read the ring, it says—”“Stop!” The old dean suddenly raised his finger in the air and motioned forsilence. Gently, he cocked his head to the side, as if he were listening tosomething. After a moment, he stood up abruptly. “My friends, this pyramidobviously has secrets left to reveal. I don’t know what Ms. Solomon is gettingat, but if she knows your next step, then I have played my role. Pack up yourthings and say no more to me. Leave me in darkness for the moment. I wouldprefer to have no information to share should our visitors try to force me.”“Visitors?” Katherine said, listening. “I don’t hear anyone.”“You will,” Galloway said, heading for the door. “Hurry.”Across town, a cell tower was attempting to contact a phone that lay in pieceson Massachusetts Avenue. Finding no signal, it redirected the call to voicemail.“Robert!” Warren Bellamy’s panicked voice shouted. “Where are you?! Call me!Something terrible is happening!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 86In the cerulean glow of his basement lights, Mal’akh stood at the stone tableand continued his preparations. As he worked, his empty stomach growled. He paidno heed. His days of servitude to the whims of his flesh were behind him.Transformation requires sacrifice.Like many of history’s most spiritually evolved men, Mal’akh had committed tohis path by making the noblest of flesh sacrifices. Castration had been lesspainful than he had imagined. And, he had learned, far more common. Every year,thousands of men underwent surgical gelding—orchiectomy, as the process wasknown—their motivations ranging from transgender issues, to curbing sexualaddictions, to deep-seated spiritual beliefs. For Mal’akh, the reasons were ofthe highest nature. Like the mythological self-castrated Attis, Mal’akh knewthat achieving immortality required a clean break with the material world ofmale and female.The androgyne is one.Nowadays, eunuchs were shunned, although the ancients understood the inherentpower of this transmutational sacrifice. Even the early Christians had heardJesus Himself extol its virtues in Matthew 19:12: “There are those who have madethemselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able toaccept this, let him accept it.”Peter Solomon had made a flesh sacrifice, although a single hand was a smallprice in the grand scheme. By night’s end, however, Solomon would be sacrificingmuch, much more.In order to create, I must destroy.Such was the nature of polarity.Peter Solomon, of course, deserved the fate that awaited him tonight. It wouldbe a fitting end. Long ago, he had played the pivotal role in Mal’akh’s mortallife path. For this reason, Peter had been chosen to play the pivotal role inMal’akh’s great transformation. This man had earned all the horror and pain hewas about to endure. Peter Solomon was not the man the world believed he was.He sacrificed his own son.Peter Solomon had once presented his son, Zachary, with an impossiblechoice—wealth or wisdom. Zachary chose poorly. The boy’s decision had begun achain of events that eventually dragged the young man into the depths of hell.Soganlik Prison. Zachary Solomon had died in that Turkish prison. The wholeworld knew the story . . . but what they didn’t know was that Peter Solomoncould have saved his son.I was there, Mal’akh thought. I heard it all.Mal’akh had never forgotten that night. Solomon’s brutal decision had meant theend of his son, Zach, but it had been the birth of Mal’akh.Some must die that others may live.As the light over Mal’akh’s head began changing color again, he realized thehour was late. He completed his preparations and headed back up the ramp. It wastime to attend to matters of the mortal world."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 87All is revealed at the thirty-third degree, Katherine thought as she ran. I knowhow to transform the pyramid! The answer had been right in front of them allnight.Katherine and Langdon were alone now, dashing through the cathedral’s annex,following signs for “The Garth.” Now, exactly as the dean had promised, theyburst out of the cathedral into a massive, walled-in courtyard.The cathedral garth was a cloistered, pentagonal garden with a bronze postmodernfountain. Katherine was amazed how loudly the fountain’s flowing water seemed tobe reverberating in the courtyard. Then she realized it was not the fountain shewas hearing.“Helicopter!” she shouted as a beam of light pierced the night sky above them.“Get under that portico!”The dazzling glare of a searchlight flooded the garth just as Langdon andKatherine reached the other side, slipping beneath a Gothic arch into a tunnelthat led to the outside lawn. They waited, huddled in the tunnel, as thehelicopter passed overhead and began circling the cathedral in wide arcs.“I guess Galloway was right about hearing visitors,” Katherine said, impressed.Bad eyes make for great ears. Her own ears now pounded rhythmically with herracing pulse.“This way,” Langdon said, clutching his daybag and moving through the passage.Dean Galloway had given them a single key and a clear set of directions.Unfortunately, when they reached the end of the short tunnel, they foundthemselves separated from their destination by a wide-open expanse of lawn,currently flooded with light from the helicopter overhead.“We can’t get across,” Katherine said.“Hold on . . . look.” Langdon pointed to a black shadow that was materializingon the lawn to their left. The shadow began as an amorphous blob, but it wasgrowing quickly, moving in their direction, becoming more defined, rushing atthem faster and faster, stretching, and finally transforming itself into amassive black rectangle crowned by two impossibly tall spires.“The cathedral facade is blocking the searchlight,” Langdon said.“They’re landing out in front!”Langdon grabbed Katherine’s hand. “Run! Now!”Inside the cathedral, Dean Galloway felt a lightness in his step that he had notfelt in years. He moved through the Great Crossing, down the nave toward thenarthex and the front doors.He could hear the helicopter hovering in front of the cathedral now, and heimagined its lights coming through the rose window in front of him, throwingspectacular colors all over the sanctuary. He recalled the days when he couldsee color. Ironically, the lightless void that had become his world hadilluminated many things for him. I see more clearly now than ever.Galloway had been called to God as a young man and over his lifetime had lovedthe church as much as any man could. Like many of his colleagues who had giventheir lives in earnest to God, Galloway was weary. He had spent his lifestraining to be heard above the din of ignorance.What did I expect?From the Crusades, to the Inquisition, to American politics—the name Jesus hadbeen hijacked as an ally in all kinds of power struggles. Since the beginning oftime, the ignorant had always screamed the loudest, herding the unsuspectingmasses and forcing them to do their bidding. They defended their worldly desiresby citing Scripture they did not understand. They celebrated their intoleranceas proof of their convictions. Now, after all these years, mankind had finallymanaged to utterly erode everything that had once been so beautiful about Jesus.Tonight, encountering the symbol of the Rose Cross had fueled him with greathope, reminding him of the prophecies written in the Rosicrucian manifestos,which Galloway had read countless times in the past and could still recall.Chapter One: Jehova will redeem humanity by revealing those secrets which hepreviously reserved only for the elect.Chapter Four: The whole world shall become as one book and all thecontradictions of science and theology shall be reconciled.Chapter Seven: Before the end of the world, God shall create a great flood ofspiritual light to alleviate the suffering of humankind.Chapter Eight: Before this revelation is possible, the world must sleep away theintoxication of her poisoned chalice, which was filled with the false life ofthe theological vine.Galloway knew the church had long ago lost her way, and he had dedicated hislife to righting her course. Now, he realized, the moment was fast approaching.It is always darkest before the dawn.CIA field agent Turner Simkins was perched on the strut of the Sikorskyhelicopter as it touched down on the frosty grass. He leaped off, joined by hismen, and immediately waved the chopper back up into the air to keep an eye onall the exits.Nobody leaves this building.As the chopper rose back into the night sky, Simkins and his team ran up thestairs to the cathedral’s main entrance. Before he could decide which of the sixdoors to pound on, one of them swung open.“Yes?” a calm voice said from the shadows.Simkins could barely make out the hunched figure in priest’s robes. “Are youDean Colin Galloway?”“I am,” the old man replied.“I’m looking for Robert Langdon. Have you seen him?”The old man stepped forward now, staring past Simkins with eerie blank eyes.“Now, wouldn’t that be a miracle.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 88Time is running out.Security analyst Nola Kaye was already on edge, and the third mug of coffee shewas now drinking had begun coursing through her like an electric current.No word yet from Sato.Finally, her phone rang, and Nola leaped on it. “OS,” she answered. “Nola here.”“Nola, it’s Rick Parrish in systems security.”Nola slumped. No Sato. “Hi, Rick. What can I do for you?”“I wanted to give you a heads-up—our department may have information relevant towhat you’re working on tonight.”Nola set down her coffee. How the hell do you know what I’m working on tonight?“I beg your pardon?”“Sorry, it’s the new CI program we’re beta-testing,” Parrish said. “It keepsflagging your workstation number.”Nola now realized what he was talking about. The Agency was currently running anew piece of “collaborative integration” software designed to provide real-timealerts to disparate CIA departments when they happened to be processing relateddata fields. In an era of time-sensitive terrorist threats, the key to thwartingdisaster was often as simple as a heads-up telling you that the guy down thehall was analyzing the very data you needed. As far as Nola was concerned, thisCI software had proven more of a distraction than any real help—constantinterruption software, she called it.“Right, I forgot,” Nola said. “What have you got?” She was positive that nobodyelse in the building knew about this crisis, much less could be working on it.The only computer work Nola had done tonight was historical research for Sato onesoteric Masonic topics. Nonetheless, she was obliged to play the game.“Well, it’s probably nothing,” Parrish said, “but we stopped a hacker tonight,and the CI program keeps suggesting I share the information with you.”A hacker? Nola sipped her coffee. “I’m listening.”“About an hour ago,” Parrish said, “we snagged a guy named Zoubianis trying toaccess a file on one of our internal databases. This guy claims it was a job forhire and that he has no idea why he was being paid to access this particularfile or even that it was on a CIA server.”“Okay.”“We finished questioning him, and he’s clean. But here’s the weird thing—thesame file he was targeting had been flagged earlier tonight by an internalsearch engine. It looks like someone piggybacked into our system, ran a specifickeyword search, and generated a redaction. The thing is, the keywords they usedare really strange. And there’s one in particular that the CI flagged as ahigh-priority match—one that’s unique to both of our data sets.” He paused. “Doyou know the word . . . symbolon?”Nola jolted upright, spilling coffee on her desk.“The other keywords are just as unusual,” Parrish continued. “Pyramid, portal—”“Get down here,” Nola commanded, mopping up her desk. “And bring everythingyou’ve got!”“These words actually mean something to you?”“NOW!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 89Cathedral College is an elegant, castlelike edifice located adjacent to theNational Cathedral. The College of Preachers, as it was originally envisioned bythe first Episcopal bishop of Washington, was founded to provide ongoingeducation for clergy after their ordination. Today, the college offers a widevariety of programs on theology, global justice, healing, and spirituality.Langdon and Katherine had made the dash across the lawn and used Galloway’s keyto slip inside just as the helicopter rose back over the cathedral, itsfloodlights turning night back into day. Now, standing breathless inside thefoyer, they surveyed their surroundings. The windows provided sufficientillumination, and Langdon saw no reason to turn the lights on and take a chanceof broadcasting their whereabouts to the helicopter overhead. As they moved downthe central hallway, they passed a series of conference halls, classrooms, andsitting areas. The interior reminded Langdon of the neo-Gothic buildings of YaleUniversity—breathtaking on the outside, and yet surprisingly utilitarian on theinside, their period elegance having been retrofitted to endure heavy foottraffic.“Down here,” Katherine said, motioning toward the far end of the hall.Katherine had yet to share with Langdon her new revelation regarding thepyramid, but apparently the reference to Isaacus Neutonuus had sparked it. Allshe had said as they crossed the lawn was that the pyramid could be transformedusing simple science. Everything she needed, she believed, could probably befound in this building. Langdon had no idea what she needed or how Katherineintended to transform a solid piece of granite or gold, but considering he hadjust witnessed a cube metamorphose into a Rosicrucian cross, he was willing tohave faith.They reached the end of the hall and Katherine frowned, apparently not seeingwhat she wanted. “You said this building has dormitory facilities?”“Yes, for residential conferences.”“So they must have a kitchen in here somewhere, right?”“You’re hungry?”She frowned back at him. “No, I need a lab.”Of course you do. Langdon spotted a descending staircase that bore a promisingsymbol. America’s favorite pictogram.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_021_r1.jpg]The basement kitchen was industrial looking—lots of stainless steel and bigbowls—clearly designed to cook for large groups. The kitchen had no windows.Katherine closed the door and flipped on the lights. The exhaust fans came onautomatically.She began rooting around in the cupboards for whatever it was she needed.“Robert,” she directed, “put the pyramid out on the island, if you would.”Feeling like the novice sous chef taking orders from Daniel Boulud, Langdon didas he was told, removing the pyramid from his bag and placing the gold capstoneon top of it. When he finished, Katherine was busy filling an enormous pot withhot tap water.“Would you please lift this to the stove for me?”Langdon heaved the sloshing pot onto the stove as Katherine turned on the gasburner and cranked up the flame.“Are we doing lobsters?” he asked hopefully.“Very funny. No, we’re doing alchemy. And for the record, this is a pasta pot,not a lobster pot.” She pointed to the perforated strainer insert that she hadremoved from the pot and placed on the island beside the pyramid.Silly me. “And boiling pasta is going to help us decipher the pyramid?”Katherine ignored the comment, her tone turning serious. “As I’m sure you know,there is a historical and symbolic reason the Masons chose thirty-three as theirhighest degree.”“Of course,” Langdon said. In the days of Pythagoras, six centuries beforeChrist, the tradition of numerology hailed the number 33 as the highest of allthe Master Numbers. It was the most sacred figure, symbolizing Divine Truth. Thetradition lived on within the Masons . . . and elsewhere. It was no coincidencethat Christians were taught that Jesus was crucified at age thirty-three,despite no real historical evidence to that effect. Nor was it coincidence thatJoseph was said to have been thirty-three when he married the Virgin Mary, orthat Jesus accomplished thirty-three miracles, or that God’s name was mentionedthirty-three times in Genesis, or that, in Islam, all the dwellers of heavenwere permanently thirty-three years old.“Thirty-three,” Katherine said, “is a sacred number in many mysticaltraditions.”“Correct.” Langdon still had no idea what this had to do with a pasta pot.“So it should come as no surprise to you that an early alchemist, Rosicrucian,and mystic like Isaac Newton also considered the number thirty-three special.”“I’m sure he did,” Langdon replied. “Newton was deep into numerology, prophecy,and astrology, but what does—”“All is revealed at the thirty-third degree.”Langdon pulled Peter’s ring from his pocket and read the inscription. Then heglanced back at the pot of water. “Sorry, you lost me.”“Robert, earlier tonight, we all assumed ‘thirty-third degree’ referred to theMasonic degree, and yet when we rotated that ring thirty-three degrees, the cubetransformed and revealed a cross. At that moment, we realized the word degreewas being used in another sense.”“Yes. Degrees of arc.”“Exactly. But degree has a third meaning as well.”Langdon eyed the pot of water on the stove. “Temperature.”“Exactly!” she said. “It was right in front of us all night. ‘All is revealed atthe thirty-third degree.’ If we bring this pyramid’s temperature to thirty-threedegrees . . . it may just reveal something.”Langdon knew Katherine Solomon was exceptionally bright, and yet she seemed tobe missing a rather obvious point. “If I’m not mistaken, thirty-three degrees isalmost freezing. Shouldn’t we be putting the pyramid in the freezer?”Katherine smiled. “Not if we want to follow the recipe written by the greatalchemist and Rosicrucian mystic who signed his papers Jeova Sanctus Unus.”Isaacus Neutonuus wrote recipes?“Robert, temperature is the fundamental alchemical catalyst, and it was notalways measured in Fahrenheit and Celsius. There are far older temperaturescales, one of them invented by Isaac—”“The Newton Scale!” Langdon said, realizing she was right.“Yes! Isaac Newton invented an entire system of quantifying temperature basedentirely on natural phenomena. The temperature of melting ice was Newton’s basepoint, and he called it ‘the zeroth degree.’ ” She paused. “I suppose you canguess what degree he assigned the temperature of boiling water—the king of allalchemical processes?”“Thirty-three.”“Yes, thirty-three! The thirty-third degree. On the Newton Scale, thetemperature of boiling water is thirty-three degrees. I remember asking mybrother once why Newton chose that number. I mean, it seemed so random. Boilingwater is the most fundamental alchemical process, and he chose thirty-three? Whynot a hundred? Why not something more elegant? Peter explained that, to a mysticlike Isaac Newton, there was no number more elegant than thirty-three.”All is revealed at the thirty-third degree. Langdon glanced at the pot of waterand then over at the pyramid. “Katherine, the pyramid is made out of solidgranite and solid gold. Do you really think boiling water is hot enough totransform it?”The smile on her face told Langdon that Katherine knew something he did notknow. Confidently, she walked over to the island, lifted the gold-capped,granite pyramid, and set it in the strainer. Then she carefully lowered it intothe bubbling water. “Let’s find out, shall we?”High above the National Cathedral, the CIA pilot locked the helicopter inauto-hover mode and surveyed the perimeter of the building and the grounds. Nomovement. His thermal imaging couldn’t penetrate the cathedral stone, and so hecouldn’t tell what the team was doing inside, but if anyone tried to slip out,the thermal would pick it up.It was sixty seconds later that a thermal sensor pinged. Working on the sameprinciple as home-security systems, the detector had identified a strongtemperature differential. Usually this meant a human form moving through a coolspace, but what appeared on the monitor was more of a thermal cloud, a patch ofhot air drifting across the lawn. The pilot found the source, an active vent onthe side of Cathedral College.Probably nothing, he thought. He saw these kinds of gradients all the time.Someone cooking or doing laundry. As he was about to turn away, though, herealized something odd. There were no cars in the parking lot and no lights onanywhere in the building.He studied the UH-60’s imaging system for a long moment. Then he radioed down tohis team leader. “Simkins, it’s probably nothing, but . . .”“Incandescent temperature indicator!” Langdon had to admit, it was clever.“It’s simple science,” Katherine said. “Different substances incandesce atdifferent temperatures. We call them thermal markers. Science uses these markersall the time.”Langdon gazed down at the submerged pyramid and capstone. Wisps of steam werebeginning to curl over the bubbling water, although he was not feeling hopeful.He glanced at his watch, and his heart rate accelerated: 11:45 P.M. “You believesomething here will luminesce as it heats up?”“Not luminesce, Robert. Incandesce. There’s a big difference. Incandescence iscaused by heat, and it occurs at a specific temperature. For example, when steelmanufacturers temper beams, they spray a grid on them with a transparent coatingthat incandesces at a specific target temperature so they know when the beamsare done. Think of a mood ring. Just put it on your finger, and it changes colorfrom body heat.”“Katherine, this pyramid was built in the 1800s! I can understand a craftsmanmaking hidden release hinges in a stone box, but applying some kind oftransparent thermal coating?”“Perfectly feasible,” she said, glancing hopefully at the submerged pyramid.“The early alchemists used organic phosphors all the time as thermal markers.The Chinese made colored fireworks, and even the Egyptians—” Katherine stoppedmidsentence, staring intently into the roiling water.“What?” Langdon followed her gaze into the turbulent water but saw nothing atall.Katherine leaned in, staring more intently into the water. Suddenly she turnedand ran across the kitchen toward the door.“Where are you going?” Langdon shouted.She slid to a stop at the kitchen light switch, flipped it off. The lights andexhaust fan went off, plunging the room into total darkness and silence. Langdonturned back to the pyramid and peered through the steam at the capstone beneaththe water. By the time Katherine made it back to his side, his mouth had fallenopen in disbelief.Exactly as Katherine had predicted, a small section of the metal capstone wasstarting to glow beneath the water. Letters were starting to appear, and theywere getting brighter as the water heated up.“Text!” Katherine whispered.Langdon nodded, dumbstruck. The glowing words were materializing just beneaththe engraved inscription on the capstone. It looked like only three words, andalthough Langdon could not yet read what the words said, he wondered if theywould unveil everything they had been looking for tonight. The pyramid is a realmap, Galloway had told them, and it points to a real location.As the letters shone brighter, Katherine turned off the gas, and the waterslowly stopped churning. The capstone now came into focus beneath the water’scalm surface.Three shining words were clearly legible."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 90In the dim light of the Cathedral College kitchen, Langdon and Katherine stoodover the pot of water and stared at the transformed capstone beneath thesurface. On the side of the golden capstone, an incandescent message wasglowing.Langdon read the shining text, scarcely able to believe his eyes. He knew thepyramid was rumored to reveal a specific location . . . but he had neverimagined that the location would be quite this specific.Eight Franklin Square“A street address,” he whispered, stunned.Katherine looked equally amazed. “I don’t know what’s there, do you?”Langdon shook his head. He knew Franklin Square was one of the older sections ofWashington, but he wasn’t familiar with the address. He looked at the tip of thecapstone, and read downward, taking in the entire text.Thesecret hideswithin The OrderEight Franklin SquareIs there some kind of Order on Franklin Square?Is there a building that hides the opening to a deep spiral staircase?Whether or not there was actually something buried at that address, Langdon hadno idea. The important issue at this point was that he and Katherine haddeciphered the pyramid and now possessed the information required to negotiatePeter’s release.And not a moment too soon.The glowing arms on Langdon’s Mickey Mouse watch indicated that they had lessthan ten minutes to spare.“Make the call,” Katherine said, motioning to a phone on the wall in thekitchen. “Now!”The sudden arrival of this moment startled Langdon, and he found himselfhesitating.“Are we sure about this?”“I most certainly am.”“I’m not telling him anything until we know Peter is safe.”“Of course not. You remember the number, right?”Langdon nodded and made his way over to the kitchen phone. He lifted thereceiver and dialed the man’s cell-phone number. Katherine came over and placedher head next to his so she could listen in. As the line began to ring, Langdonprepared himself for the eerie whisper of the man who had tricked him earliertonight.Finally, the call connected.There was no greeting, though. No voice. Only the sound of breathing at theother end.Langdon waited and then finally spoke. “I have the information you want, but ifyou want it, you’ll have to give us Peter.”“Who is this?” a woman’s voice replied.Langdon jumped. “Robert Langdon,” he said reflexively. “Who are you?” For aninstant he thought he must have dialed incorrectly.“Your name is Langdon?” The woman sounded surprised. “There’s someone hereasking for you.”What? “I’m sorry, who is this?”“Officer Paige Montgomery with Preferred Security.” Her voice seemed shaky.“Maybe you can help us with this. About an hour ago, my partner responded to a911 call in Kalorama Heights . . . a possible hostage situation. I lost allcontact with her, and so I called backup and came to check the residence. Wefound my partner dead in the backyard. The home owner was gone, and so we brokein. A cell phone was ringing on the hall table, and I—”“You’re inside?” Langdon demanded.“Yes, and the 911 tip . . . was a good one,” the woman stammered. “Sorry if Isound rattled, but my partner’s dead, and we found a man being held here againsthis will. He’s in bad shape, and we’re working on him now. He’s been asking fortwo people—one named Langdon and one named Katherine.”“That’s my brother!” Katherine blurted into the receiver, pressing her headcloser to Langdon’s. “I made the 911 call! Is he okay?!”“Actually, ma’am, he’s . . .” The woman’s voice cracked. “He’s in bad shape.He’s missing his right hand . . .”“Please,” Katherine urged. “I want to talk to him!”“They’re working on him at the moment. He’s in and out of consciousness. Ifyou’re anywhere in the area, you should get over here. He obviously wants to seeyou.”“We’re about six minutes away!” Katherine said.“Then I suggest you hurry.” There was a muffled noise in the background, and thewoman then returned to the line. “Sorry, it looks like I’m needed. I’ll speak toyou when you arrive.”The line went dead."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 91Inside Cathedral College, Langdon and Katherine bounded up the basement stairsand hurried down a darkened hallway looking for a front exit. No longer did theyhear the sounds of helicopter blades overhead, and Langdon felt hopeful theycould slip out unseen and find their way up to Kalorama Heights to see Peter.They found him. He’s alive.Thirty seconds earlier, when they’d hung up with the female security guard,Katherine had hurriedly hoisted the steaming pyramid and capstone out of thewater. The pyramid was still dripping when she lowered it into Langdon’s leatherbag. Now he could feel the heat radiating through the leather.Excitement over Peter’s discovery had temporarily trumped any further reflectionon the capstone’s glowing message—Eight Franklin Square— but there would be timefor that once they got to Peter.As they rounded the corner at the top of the stairs, Katherine stopped short andpointed into a sitting room across the hall. Through the bay window, Langdoncould see a sleek black helicopter sitting silent on the lawn. A lone pilotstood beside it, facing away from them and talking on his radio. There was alsoa black Escalade with tinted windows parked nearby.Staying in the shadows, Langdon and Katherine moved into the sitting room, andpeered out the window to see if they could see the rest of the field team.Thankfully, the huge lawn outside the National Cathedral was empty.“They must be inside the cathedral,” Langdon said.“They’re not,” a deep voice said behind them.Langdon and Katherine wheeled around to see who had spoken. In the doorway ofthe sitting room, two black-clad figures aimed laser-sighted rifles at them.Langdon could see a glowing red dot dancing on his chest.“Nice to see you again, Professor,” said a familiar raspy voice. The agentsparted, and the tiny form of Director Sato sliced effortlessly through, crossingthe sitting room and stopping directly in front of Langdon. “You’ve made someexceedingly poor choices tonight.”“The police found Peter Solomon,” Langdon declared forcefully. “He’s in badshape, but he’ll live. It’s over.”If Sato was surprised Peter had been found, she did not show it. Her eyes wereunflinching as she walked to Langdon and stopped only inches away. “Professor, Ican assure you, this is nowhere near over. And if the police are now involved,it has only become more serious. As I told you earlier this evening, this is anextremely delicate situation. You never should have run away with that pyramid.”“Ma’am,” Katherine blurted, “I need to see my brother. You can have the pyramid,but you must let—”“I must?” Sato demanded, spinning to Katherine. “Ms. Solomon, I assume?” Shestared at Katherine with fire in her eyes and then turned back to Langdon. “Putthe leather bag on the table.”Langdon glanced down at the pair of laser sights on his chest. He set theleather bag on the coffee table. An agent approached cautiously, unzipped thebag, and pulled the two sides apart. A little puff of trapped steam billowed upout of the bag. He aimed his light inside, stared for a long, puzzled moment,and then nodded to Sato.Sato walked over and peered into the bag. The wet pyramid and capstone glistenedin the beam of the flashlight. Sato crouched down, looking very closely at thegolden capstone, which Langdon realized she had only seen in X-ray.“The inscription,” Sato demanded. “Does it mean anything to you? ‘The secrethides within The Order’?”“We’re not sure, ma’am.”“Why is the pyramid steaming hot?”“We submerged it in boiling water,” Katherine said without hesitation. “It waspart of the process of deciphering the code. We’ll tell you everything, butplease let us go see my brother. He’s been through—”“You boiled the pyramid?” Sato demanded.“Turn off the flashlight,” Katherine said. “Look at the capstone. You canprobably still see.”The agent flicked off his light, and Sato knelt down before the capstone. Evenfrom where Langdon was standing, he could see that the text on the capstone wasstill glowing slightly.“Eight Franklin Square?” Sato said, sounding amazed.“Yes, ma’am. That text was written with an incandescent lacquer or something.The thirty-third degree was actually—”“And the address?” Sato demanded. “Is this what this guy wants?”“Yes,” Langdon said. “He believes the pyramid is a map that will tell him thelocation of a great treasure—the key to unlocking the Ancient Mysteries.”Sato looked again at the capstone, her expression one of disbelief. “Tell me,”she said, fear creeping into her voice, “have you contacted this man yet? Haveyou already given him this address?”“We tried.” Langdon explained what had happened when they called the man’s cellphone.Sato listened, running her tongue over her yellow teeth as he spoke. Despitelooking ready to erupt with anger over the situation, she turned to one of heragents and spoke in a restrained whisper. “Send him in. He’s in the SUV.”The agent nodded and spoke into his transceiver.“Send who in?” Langdon said.“The only person who has any hope of fixing the goddamn mess you made!”“What mess?” Langdon fired back. “Now that Peter is safe, everything is—”“For Christ’s sake!” Sato exploded. “This is not about Peter! I tried to tellyou that at the Capitol Building, Professor, but you chose to work against merather than with me! Now you’ve made an ungodly mess! When you destroyed yourcell phone, which, by the way, we were tracking, you cut off your communicationwith this man. And this address you uncovered—whatever the hell it is—thisaddress was our one chance to catch this lunatic. I needed you to play his game,to provide him with this address so we would know where the hell to catch him!”Before Langdon could reply, Sato directed the remainder of her wrath atKatherine.“And you, Ms. Solomon! You knew where this maniac lived? Why didn’t you tell me?You sent a rent-a-cop to this man’s house? Don’t you see you’ve ruined anychance we had of catching him there? I’m glad your brother is safe, but let metell you this, we are facing a crisis tonight whose ramifications far outreachyour family. They will be felt all around the world. The man who took yourbrother has enormous power, and we need to catch him immediately.”As she finished her tirade, the tall, elegant silhouette of Warren Bellamyemerged from the shadows and stepped into the sitting room. He looked rumpled,bruised, and shaken . . . like he’d been through hell.“Warren!” Langdon stood up. “Are you okay?”“No,” he replied. “Not really.”“Did you hear? Peter is safe!”Bellamy nodded, looking dazed, as if nothing mattered anymore. “Yes, I justheard your conversation. I’m glad.”“Warren, what the hell is going on?”Sato intervened. “You boys can catch up in a minute. Right now, Mr. Bellamy isgoing to reach out to this lunatic and communicate with him. Just like he’s beendoing all night.”Langdon felt lost. “Bellamy hasn’t been communicating with this guy tonight!This guy doesn’t even know Bellamy is involved!”Sato turned to Bellamy and raised her eyebrows.Bellamy sighed. “Robert, I’m afraid I haven’t been entirely honest with you thisevening.” Langdon could only stare. “I thought I was doing the right thing . ..” Bellamy said, looking frightened.“Well,” Sato said, “now you will do the right thing . . . and we’d all betterpray to God it works.” As if to substantiate Sato’s portentous tone, the mantelclock began chiming the hour. Sato took out a Ziploc bag of items and tossed itto Bellamy. “Here’s your stuff. Does your cell phone take photos?”“Yes, ma’am.”“Good. Hold up the capstone.”The message Mal’akh had just received was from his contact—Warren Bellamy—theMason he had sent to the Capitol Building earlier tonight to assist RobertLangdon. Bellamy, like Langdon, wanted Peter Solomon back alive and had assuredMal’akh he would help Langdon acquire and decipher the pyramid. All night,Mal’akh had been receiving e-mail updates, which had been automaticallyforwarded to his cell phone.This should be interesting, Mal’akh thought, opening the message.From: Warren Bellamygot separated from langdonbut finally have info youdemanded. proof attached.call for missing piece. —wb—one attachment (jpeg)—Call for missing piece? Mal’akh wondered, opening the attachment.The attachment was a photo.When Mal’akh saw it, he gasped out loud, and he could feel his heart startpounding with excitement. He was looking at a close-up of a tiny golden pyramid.The legendary capstone! The ornate engraving on the face carried a promisingmessage: The secret hides within The Order.Beneath the inscription, Mal’akh now saw something that stunned him. Thecapstone seemed to be glowing. In disbelief, he stared at the faintly radianttext and realized that the legend was literally true: The Masonic Pyramidtransforms itself to reveal its secret to the worthy.How this magical transformation had occurred, Mal’akh had no idea, and he didn’tcare. The glowing text was clearly pointing to a specific location in D.C.,exactly as prophesied. Franklin Square. Unfortunately, the photo of the capstonealso included Warren Bellamy’s index finger, which was strategically positionedon the capstone to block out a critical piece of information.Thesecret hideswithin The Orderimage [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_022_r1.jpg] Franklin SquareCall for missing piece. Mal’akh now understood Bellamy’s meaning.The Architect of the Capitol had been cooperative all night, but now he hadchosen to play a very dangerous game."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 92Beneath the watchful gaze of several armed CIA agents, Langdon, Katherine, andBellamy waited with Sato in the Cathedral College sitting room. On the coffeetable before them, Langdon’s leather bag was still open, the golden capstonepeeking out the top. The words Eight Franklin Square had now faded away, leavingno evidence that they had ever existed.Katherine had pleaded with Sato to let her go see her brother, but Sato hadsimply shaken her head, eyes fixed on Bellamy’s cell phone. It sat on the coffeetable and had yet to ring.Why didn’t Bellamy just tell me the truth? Langdon wondered. Apparently, theArchitect had been in contact with Peter’s captor all night, reassuring him thatLangdon was making progress deciphering the pyramid. It was a bluff, an attemptto buy time for Peter. In fact, Bellamy was doing all he could to interfere withanyone who threatened to unveil the pyramid’s secret. Now, however, it seemedthat Bellamy had switched sides. He and Sato were now prepared to risk thepyramid’s secret in hopes of catching this man.“Take your hands off me!” shouted an elderly voice in the hall. “I’m blind, notinept! I know my way through the college!” Dean Galloway was still protestingloudly as a CIA agent manhandled him into the sitting room and forced him intoone of the chairs.“Who’s here?” Galloway demanded, his blank eyes staring dead ahead. “It soundslike a lot of you. How many do you need to detain an old man? Really now!”“There are seven of us,” Sato declared. “Including Robert Langdon, KatherineSolomon, and your Masonic brother Warren Bellamy.”Galloway slumped, all his bluster gone.“We’re okay,” Langdon said. “And we just heard that Peter is safe. He’s in badshape, but the police are with him.”“Thank heavens,” Galloway said. “And the—”A loud rattling caused everyone in the room to jump. It was Bellamy’s cell phonevibrating against the coffee table. Everyone fell silent.“Okay, Mr. Bellamy,” Sato said. “Don’t blow it. You know the stakes.”Bellamy took a deep breath and exhaled. Then he reached down and pressed thespeakerphone button to connect the call.“Bellamy here,” he said, speaking loudly toward the phone on the coffee table.The voice that crackled back through the speaker was familiar, an airy whisper.It sounded like he was calling from a hands-free speakerphone inside a car.“It’s past midnight, Mr. Bellamy. I was about to put Peter out of his misery.”There was an uneasy silence in the room. “Let me talk to him.”“Impossible,” the man replied. “We’re driving. He’s tied up in the trunk.”Langdon and Katherine exchanged looks and then began shaking their heads ateveryone. He’s bluffing! He no longer has Peter!Sato motioned for Bellamy to keep pressing.“I want proof that Peter’s alive,” Bellamy said. “I’m not giving you the restof—”“Your Worshipful Master needs a doctor. Don’t waste time with negotiations. Tellme the street number on Franklin Square, and I’ll bring Peter to you there.”“I told you, I want—”“Now!” the man exploded. “Or I will pull over and Peter Solomon dies thisinstant!”“You listen to me,” Bellamy said forcefully. “If you want the rest of theaddress, you’ll play by my rules. Meet me at Franklin Square. Once you deliverPeter alive, I’ll tell you the number of the building.”“How do I know you won’t bring the authorities?”“Because I can’t risk double-crossing you. Peter’s life is not the only card youhold. I know what’s really at stake tonight.”“You do realize,” the man on the phone said, “that if I sense so much as a hintof anyone other than you at Franklin Square, I will keep driving, and you willnever find even a trace of Peter Solomon. And of course . . . that will be theleast of your worries.”“I’ll come alone,” Bellamy replied somberly. “When you turn over Peter, I’llgive you everything you need.”“Center of the square,” the man said. “It will take me at least twenty minutesto get there. I suggest you wait for me as long as it takes.”The line went dead.Instantly, the room sprang to life. Sato began shouting orders. Several fieldagents grabbed their radios and headed for the door. “Move! Move!”In the chaos, Langdon looked to Bellamy for some kind of explanation as to whatwas actually going on tonight, but the older man was already being hurried outthe door.“I need to see my brother!” Katherine shouted. “You have to let us go!”Sato walked over to Katherine. “I don’t have to do anything, Ms. Solomon. Isthat clear?”Katherine stood her ground and looked desperately into Sato’s small eyes.“Ms. Solomon, my top priority is apprehending the man at Franklin Square, andyou will sit here with one of my men until I accomplish that task. Then, andonly then, will we deal with your brother.”“You’re missing the point,” Katherine said. “I know exactly where this manlives! It’s literally five minutes up the road in Kalorama Heights, and therewill be evidence there that will help you! Besides, you said you want to keepthis quiet. Who knows what Peter will start telling the authorities once he’sstabilized.”Sato pursed her lips, apparently registering Katherine’s point. Outside, thechopper blades began winding up. Sato frowned and then turned to one of her men.“Hartmann, you take the Escalade. Transport Ms. Solomon and Mr. Langdon toKalorama Heights. Peter Solomon is not to speak to anyone. Is that understood?”“Yes, ma’am,” the agent said.“Call me when you get there. Tell me what you find. And don’t let these two outof your sight.”Agent Hartmann gave a quick nod, pulled out the Escalade keys, and headed forthe door.Katherine was right behind him.Sato turned to Langdon. “I’ll see you shortly, Professor. I know you think I’mthe enemy, but I can assure you that’s not the case. Get to Peter at once. Thisisn’t over yet.”Off to one side of Langdon, Dean Galloway was sitting quietly at the coffeetable. His hands had found the stone pyramid, which was still sitting inLangdon’s open leather bag on the table in front of him. The old man was runninghis hands over the stone’s warm surface.Langdon said, “Father, are you coming to see Peter?”“I’d just slow you down.” Galloway removed his hands from the bag and zipped itup around the pyramid. “I’ll stay right here and pray for Peter’s recovery. Wecan all speak later. But when you show Peter the pyramid, would you please tellhim something for me?”“Of course.” Langdon hoisted the bag onto his shoulder.“Tell him this.” Galloway cleared his throat. “The Masonic Pyramid has alwayskept her secret . . . sincerely.”“I don’t understand.”The old man winked. “Just tell Peter that. He will understand.”With that, Dean Galloway bowed his head and began praying.Perplexed, Langdon left him there and hurried outside. Katherine was already inthe front seat of the SUV giving the agent directions. Langdon climbed in backand had barely closed the door before the giant vehicle was rocketing across thelawn, racing northward to Kalorama Heights."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 93Franklin Square is located in the northwest quadrant of downtown Washington,bordered by K and Thirteenth streets. It is home to many historic buildings,most notably the Franklin School, from which Alexander Graham Bell sent theworld’s first wireless message in 1880.High above the square, a fast-moving UH-60 helicopter approached from the west,having completed its journey from the National Cathedral in a matter of minutes.Plenty of time, Sato thought, peering down at the square below. She knew it wascritical that her men got into position undetected before their target arrived.He said he wouldn’t be here for at least twenty minutes.On Sato’s command, the pilot performed a “touch-hover” on the roof of thetallest building around—the renowned One Franklin Square—a towering andprestigious office building with two gold spires on top. The maneuver wasillegal, of course, but the chopper was there only a few seconds, and its skidsbarely touched the gravel rooftop. Once everyone had jumped out, the pilotimmediately lifted off, banking to the east, where he would climb to “silentaltitude” and provide invisible support from above.Sato waited as her field team collected their things and prepared Bellamy forhis task. The Architect was still looking dazed from having seen the file onSato’s secure laptop. As I said . . . an issue of national security. Bellamy hadquickly understood Sato’s meaning and was now fully cooperative.“All set, ma’am,” Agent Simkins said.On Sato’s command, the agents ushered Bellamy across the rooftop and disappeareddown a stairwell, heading for ground level to take up their positions.Sato walked to the edge of the building and gazed down. The rectangular woodedpark below filled the entire block. Plenty of cover. Sato’s team fullyunderstood the importance of making an undetected intercept. If their targetsensed a presence here and decided just to slip away . . . the director didn’teven want to think about it.The wind up here was gusty and cold. Sato wrapped her arms around herself, andplanted her feet firmly to avoid getting blown over the edge. From this highvantage point, Franklin Square looked smaller than she recalled, with fewerbuildings. She wondered which building was Eight Franklin Square. This wasinformation she had requested from her analyst Nola, from whom she expected wordat any moment.Bellamy and the agents now appeared, looking like ants fanning out into thedarkness of the wooded area. Simkins positioned Bellamy in a clearing near thecenter of the deserted park. Then Simkins and his team melted into the naturalcover, disappearing from view. Within seconds, Bellamy was alone, pacing andshivering in the light of a streetlamp near the center of the park.Sato felt no pity.She lit a cigarette and took a long drag, savoring the warmth as it permeatedher lungs. Satisfied that everything below was in order, she stepped back fromthe edge to await her two phone calls—one from her analyst Nola and one fromAgent Hartmann, whom she had sent to Kalorama Heights."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 94Slow down! Langdon gripped the backseat of the Escalade as it flew around acorner, threatening to tip up on two tires. CIA agent Hartmann was either eagerto show off his driving skills to Katherine, or he had orders to get to PeterSolomon before Solomon recuperated enough to say anything he shouldn’t say tothe local authorities.The high-speed game of beat-the-red-light on Embassy Row had been worrisomeenough, but now they were racing through the winding residential neighborhood ofKalorama Heights. Katherine shouted directions as they went, having been to thisman’s house earlier that afternoon.With every turn, the leather bag at Langdon’s feet rocked back and forth, andLangdon could hear the clank of the capstone, which had clearly been jarred fromthe top of the pyramid and was now bouncing around in the bottom of his bag.Fearing it might get damaged, he fished around inside until he found it. It wasstill warm, but the glowing text had now faded and disappeared, returning to itsoriginal engraving:The secret hides within The Order.As Langdon was about to place the capstone in a side pocket, he noticed itselegant surface was covered with tiny white gobs of something. Puzzled, he triedto wipe them off, but they were stuck on and hard to the touch . . . likeplastic. What in the world? He could now see that the surface of the stonepyramid itself was also covered with the little white dots. Langdon used hisfingernail and picked one off, rolling it between his fingers.“Wax?” he blurted.Katherine glanced over her shoulder. “What?”“There are bits of wax all over the pyramid and capstone. I don’t understand it.Where could that possibly have come from?”“Something in your bag, maybe?”“I don’t think so.”As they rounded a corner, Katherine pointed through the windshield and turned toAgent Hartmann. “That’s it! We’re here.”Langdon glanced up and saw the spinning lights of a security vehicle parked in adriveway up ahead. The driveway gate was pulled aside and the agent gunned theSUV inside the compound.The house was a spectacular mansion. Every light inside was ablaze, and thefront door was wide open. A half-dozen vehicles were parked haphazardly in thedriveway and on the lawn, apparently having arrived in a hurry. Some of the carswere still running and had their headlights shining, most on the house, but oneaskew, practically blinding them as they drove in.Agent Hartmann skidded to a stop on the lawn beside a white sedan with abrightly colored decal: PREFERRED SECURITY. The spinning lights and the highbeams in their face made it hard to see.Katherine immediately jumped out and raced for the house. Langdon heaved his bagonto his shoulder without taking the time to zip it up. He followed Katherine ata jog across the lawn toward the open front door. The sounds of voices echoedwithin. Behind Langdon, the SUV chirped as Agent Hartmann locked the vehicle andhurried after them.Katherine bounded up the porch stairs, through the main door, and disappearedinto the entryway. Langdon crossed the threshold behind her and could seeKatherine was already moving across the foyer and down the main hallway towardthe sound of voices. Beyond her, visible at the end of the hall, was adining-room table where a woman in a security uniform was sitting with her backto them.“Officer!” Katherine shouted as she ran. “Where is Peter Solomon?”Langdon rushed after her, but as he did so, an unexpected movement caught hiseye. To his left, through the living-room window, he could see the driveway gatewas now swinging shut. Odd. Something else caught his eye . . . something thathad been hidden from him by the glare of the spinning lights and the blindinghigh beams when they drove in. The half-dozen cars parked haphazardly in thedriveway looked nothing like the police cars and emergency vehicles Langdon hadimagined they were.A Mercedes? . . . a Hummer? . . . a Tesla Roadster?In that instant, Langdon also realized the voices he heard in the house werenothing but a television blaring in the direction of the dining room.Wheeling in slow motion, Langdon shouted down the hallway. “Katherine, wait!”But as he turned, he could see that Katherine Solomon was no longer running.She was airborne."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 95Katherine Solomon knew she was falling . . . but she couldn’t figure out why.She had been running down the hall toward the security guard in the dining roomwhen suddenly her feet had become entangled in an invisible obstacle, and herentire body had lurched forward, sailing through the air.Now she was returning to earth . . . in this case, a hardwood floor.Katherine crashed down on her stomach, the wind driven violently from her lungs.Above her, a heavy coat tree teetered precariously and then toppled over, barelymissing her on the floor. She raised her head, still gasping for breath, puzzledto see that the female security guard in the chair had not moved a muscle.Stranger still, the toppled coat tree appeared to have a thin wire attached tothe bottom, which had been stretched across the hallway.Why in the world would someone . . . ?“Katherine!” Langdon was shouting to her, and as Katherine rolled onto her sideand looked back at him, she felt her blood turn to ice. Robert! Behind you! Shetried to scream, but she was still gasping for breath. All she could do waswatch in terrifying slow motion as Langdon rushed down the hall to help her,completely unaware that behind him, Agent Hartmann was staggering across thethreshold and clutching his throat. Blood sprayed through Hartmann’s hands as hegroped at the handle of a long screwdriver that protruded from his neck.As the agent pitched forward, his attacker came into full view.My God . . . no!Naked except for a strange undergarment that looked like a loincloth, themassive man had apparently been hiding in the foyer. His muscular body wascovered from head to toe with strange tattoos. The front door was swingingclosed, and he was rushing down the hall after Langdon.Agent Hartmann hit the floor just as the front door slammed shut. Langdon lookedstartled and whirled around, but the tattooed man was already on him, thrustingsome kind of device into his back. There was a flash of light and a sharpelectrical sizzle, and Katherine saw Langdon go rigid. Eyes frozen wide, Langdonlurched forward, collapsing down in a paralyzed heap. He fell hard on top of hisleather bag, the pyramid tumbling out onto the floor.Without so much as a glance down at his victim, the tattooed man stepped overLangdon and headed directly for Katherine. She was already crawling backwardinto the dining room, where she collided with a chair. The female securityguard, who had been propped in that chair, now wobbled and dropped to the floorin a heap beside her. The woman’s lifeless expression was one of terror. Hermouth was stuffed with a rag.The enormous man had reached her before Katherine had time to react. He seizedher by the shoulders with impossible strength. His face, no longer covered bymakeup, was an utterly terrifying sight. His muscles flexed, and she feltherself being flipped over onto her stomach like a rag doll. A heavy knee groundinto her back, and for a moment, she thought she would break in two. He grabbedher arms and pulled them backward.With her head now turned to one side and her cheek pressed into the carpet,Katherine could see Langdon, his body still jerking, facing away from her.Beyond that, Agent Hartmann lay motionless in the foyer.Cold metal pinched Katherine’s wrists, and she realized she was being bound withwire. In terror, she tried to pull away, but doing so sent searing pain into herhands.“This wire will cut you if you move,” the man said, finishing with her wristsand moving down to her ankles with frightening efficiency.Katherine kicked at him, and he threw a powerful fist into the back of her rightthigh, crippling her leg. Within seconds, her ankles were bound.“Robert!” she now managed to call out.Langdon was groaning on the floor in the hallway. He lay crumpled on his leatherbag with the stone pyramid lying on its side near his head. Katherine realizedthe pyramid was her last hope.“We deciphered the pyramid!” she told her attacker. “I’ll tell you everything!”“Yes, you will.” With that, he pulled the cloth from the dead woman’s mouth andfirmly stuffed it into Katherine’s.It tasted like death.Robert Langdon’s body was not his own. He lay, numb and immobile, his cheekpressed against the hardwood floor. He had heard enough about stun guns to knowthey crippled their victims by temporarily overloading the nervous system. Theiraction—something called electromuscular disruption—might as well have been abolt of lightning. The excruciating jolt of pain seemed to penetrate everymolecule of his body. Now, despite his mind’s focused intention, his musclesrefused to obey the command he was sending them.Get up!Facedown, paralyzed on the floor, Langdon was gulping shallow breaths, scarcelyable to inhale. He had yet to lay eyes on the man who had attacked him, but hecould see Agent Hartmann lying in an expanding pool of blood. Langdon had heardKatherine struggling and arguing, but moments ago her voice had become muffled,as if the man had stuffed something in her mouth.Get up, Robert! You’ve got to help her!Langdon’s legs were tingling now, a fiery and painful recovery of feeling, butstill they refused to cooperate. Move! His arms twitched as sensation started tocome back, along with feeling in his face and neck. With great effort, hemanaged to rotate his head, dragging his cheek roughly across the hardwood flooras he turned his head to look down into the dining room.Langdon’s sight line was impeded—by the stone pyramid, which had toppled out ofhis bag and was lying sideways on the floor, its base inches from his face.For an instant, Langdon didn’t understand what he was looking at. The square ofstone before him was obviously the base of the pyramid, and yet it lookedsomehow different. Very different. It was still square, and still stone . . .but it was no longer flat and smooth. The base of the pyramid was covered withengraved markings. How is this possible? He stared for several seconds,wondering if he was hallucinating. I looked at the base of this pyramid a dozentimes . . . and there were no markings!Langdon now realized why.His breathing reflex kick-started, and he drew a sudden gasp of air, realizingthat the Masonic Pyramid had secrets yet to share. I have witnessed anothertransformation.In a flash, Langdon understood the meaning of Galloway’s last request. TellPeter this: The Masonic Pyramid has always kept her secret . . . sincerely. Thewords had seemed strange at the time, but now Langdon understood that DeanGalloway was sending Peter a code. Ironically, this same code had been a plottwist in a mediocre thriller Langdon had read years ago.Sin-cere.Since the days of Michelangelo, sculptors had been hiding the flaws in theirwork by smearing hot wax into the cracks and then dabbing the wax with stonedust. The method was considered cheating, and therefore, any sculpture “withoutwax”—literally sine cera—was considered a “sincere” piece of art. The phrasestuck. To this day we still sign our letters “sincerely” as a promise that wehave written “without wax” and that our words are true.The engravings on the base of this pyramid had been concealed by the samemethod. When Katherine followed the capstone’s directions and boiled thepyramid, the wax melted away, revealing the writing on the base. Galloway hadrun his hands over the pyramid in the sitting room, apparently feeling themarkings exposed on the bottom.Now, if only for an instant, Langdon had forgotten all the danger he andKatherine faced. He stared at the incredible array of symbols on the base of thepyramid. He had no idea what they meant . . . or what they would ultimatelyreveal, but one thing was for certain. The Masonic Pyramid has secrets left totell. Eight Franklin Square is not the final answer.Whether it was this adrenaline-filled revelation or simply the extra few secondslying there, Langdon did not know, but he suddenly felt control returning to hisbody.Painfully, he swept an arm to one side, pushing the leather bag out of the wayto clear his sight line into the dining room.To his horror, he saw that Katherine had been tied up, and a large rag had beenstuffed deep into her mouth. Langdon flexed his muscles, trying to climb to hisknees, but a moment later, he froze in utter disbelief. The dining-room doorwayhad just filled with a chilling sight—a human form unlike anything Langdon hadever seen.What in the name of God . . . ?!Langdon rolled, kicking with his legs, trying to back away, but the hugetattooed man grabbed him, flipping him onto his back and straddling his chest.He placed his knees on Langdon’s biceps, pinning Langdon pain fully to thefloor. The man’s chest bore a rippling double-headed phoenix. His neck, face,and shaved head were covered with a dazzling array of unusually intricatesymbols—sigils, Langdon knew—which were used in the rituals of dark ceremonialmagic.Before Langdon could process anything more, the huge man clasped Langdon’s earsbetween his palms, lifted his head up off the floor, and, with incredible force,smashed it back down onto the hardwood.Everything went black."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 96Mal’akh stood in his hallway and surveyed the carnage around him. His homelooked like a battlefield.Robert Langdon lay unconscious at his feet.Katherine Solomon was bound and gagged on the dining-room floor.The corpse of a female security guard lay crumpled nearby, having toppled offthe chair where she was propped. This female guard, eager to save her own life,had done exactly as Mal’akh commanded. With a knife to her throat, she hadanswered Mal’akh’s cell phone and told the lie that had coaxed Langdon andKatherine to come racing out here. She had no partner, and Peter Solomon wascertainly not okay. As soon as the woman had given her performance, Mal’akh hadquietly strangled her.To complete the illusion that Mal’akh was not home, he had phoned Bellamy usingthe hands-free speaker in one of his cars. I’m on the road, he had told Bellamyand whoever else had been listening. Peter is in my trunk. In fact, Mal’akh wasdriving only between his garage and his front yard, where he had left several ofhis myriad cars parked askew with the headlights on and the engines running.The deception had worked perfectly.Almost.The only wrinkle was the bloody black-clad heap in the foyer with a screwdriverprotruding from his neck. Mal’akh searched the corpse and had to chuckle when hefound a high-tech transceiver and cell phone with a CIA logo. It seems even theyare aware of my power. He removed the batteries and crushed both devices with aheavy bronze doorstop.Mal’akh knew he had to move quickly now, especially if the CIA was involved. Hestrode back over to Langdon. The professor was out cold and would be for awhile. Mal’akh’s eyes moved with trepidation now to the stone pyramid on thefloor beside the professor’s open bag. His breath caught, and his heart pounded.I have waited for years . . .His hands trembled slightly as he reached down and picked up the MasonicPyramid. As he ran his fingers slowly across the engravings, he felt awed bytheir promise. Before he became too entranced, he put the pyramid back inLangdon’s bag with the capstone and zipped it up.I will assemble the pyramid soon . . . in a much safer location.He threw Langdon’s bag over his shoulder and then tried to hoist Langdonhimself, but the professor’s toned physique weighed much more than anticipated.Mal’akh settled on grabbing him beneath the armpits and dragging him across thefloor. He’s not going to like where he ends up, Mal’akh thought.As he dragged Langdon off, the television in the kitchen blared. The sound ofvoices from the TV had been part of the deception, and Mal’akh had yet to turnit off. The station was now broadcasting a televangelist leading hiscongregation in the Lord’s Prayer. Mal’akh wondered if any of his hypnotizedviewers had any idea where this prayer really came from.“ . . . On earth as it is in heaven . . .” the group intoned.Yes, Mal’akh thought. As above, so below.“ . . . And lead us not into temptation . . .”Help us master the weakness of our flesh.“ . . . Deliver us from evil . . .” they all beseeched.Mal’akh smiled. That could be difficult. The darkness is growing. Even so, hehad to give them credit for trying. Humans who spoke to invisible forces andrequested help were a dying breed in this modern world.Mal’akh was dragging Langdon across the living room when the congregationdeclared, “Amen!”Amon, Mal’akh corrected. Egypt is the cradle of your religion. The god Amon wasthe prototype for Zeus . . . for Jupiter . . . and for every modern face of God.To this day, every religion on earth shouted out a variation of his name. Amen!Amin! Aum!The televangelist began quoting verses from the Bible describing hierarchies ofangels, demons, and spirits that ruled in heaven and hell. “Protect your soulsfrom evil forces!” he warned them. “Lift your hearts in prayer! God and hisangels will hear you!”He’s right, Mal’akh knew. But so will the demons.Mal’akh had learned long ago that through proper application of the Art, apractitioner could open a portal to the spiritual realm. The invisible forcesthat existed there, much like man himself, came in many forms, both good andevil. Those of Light healed, protected, and sought to bring order to theuniverse. Those of Dark functioned oppositely . . . bringing destruction andchaos.If properly summoned, the invisible forces could be persuaded to do apractitioner’s bidding on earth . . . thus instilling him with seeminglysupernatural power. In exchange for helping the summoner, these forces requiredofferings—prayers and praise for those of Light . . . and the spilling of bloodfor those of Dark.The greater the sacrifice, the greater the power that is transferred. Mal’akhhad begun his practice with the blood of inconsequential animals. Over time,however, his choices for sacrifice had become more bold. Tonight, I take thefinal step.“Beware!” the preacher shouted, warning of the coming Apocalypse. “The finalbattle for the souls of man will soon be fought!”Indeed, Mal’akh thought. And I shall become its greatest warrior.This battle, of course, had begun long, long ago. In ancient Egypt, those whoperfected the Art had become the great Adepts of history, evolving beyond themasses to become true practitioners of Light. They moved as gods on earth. Theybuilt great temples of initiation to which neophytes traveled from around theworld to partake of the wisdom. There arose a race of golden men. For a briefspan of time, mankind seemed poised to elevate himself and transcend his earthlybonds.The golden age of the Ancient Mysteries.And yet man, being of the flesh, was susceptible to the sins of hubris, hatred,impatience, and greed. Over time, there were those who corrupted the Art,perverting it and abusing its power for personal gain. They began using thisperverted version to summon dark forces. A different Art evolved . . . a morepotent, immediate, and intoxicating influence.Such is my Art.Such is my Great Work.The illuminated Adepts and their esoteric fraternities witnessed the rising eviland saw that man was not using his newfound knowledge for the good of hisspecies. And so they hid their wisdom to keep it from the eyes of the unworthy.Eventually, it was lost to history.With this came the Great Fall of Man.And a lasting darkness.To this day, the noble descendants of the Adepts soldiered on, grasping blindlyfor the Light, trying to recapture the lost power of their past, trying to keepthe darkness at bay. They were the priests and priestesses of the churches,temples, and shrines of all the religions on earth. Time had erased the memories. . . detached them from their past. They no longer knew the Source from whichtheir potent wisdom had once flowed. When they were asked about the divinemysteries of their forebears, the new custodians of faith vociferously disownedthem, condemning them as heresy.Have they truly forgotten? Mal’akh wondered.Echoes of the ancient Art still resonated in every corner of the globe, from themystical Kabbalists of Judaism to the esoteric Sufis of Islam. Vestiges remainedin the arcane rituals of Christianity, in its god-eating rites of HolyCommunion, its hierarchies of saints, angels, and demons, its chanting andincantation, its holy calendar’s astrological underpinnings, its consecratedrobes, and in its promise of everlasting life. Even now, its priests dispelledevil spirits by swinging smoke-filled censers, ringing sacred bells, andsprinkling holy water. Christians still practiced the supernatural craft ofexorcism—an early practice of their faith that required the ability not only tocast out demons but to summon them.And yet they cannot see their past?Nowhere was the church’s mystical past more evident than at her epicenter. InVatican City, at the heart of St. Peter’s Square, stood the great Egyptianobelisk. Carved thirteen hundred years before Jesus took his first breath—thisnuminous monolith had no relevance there, no link to modern Christianity. Andyet there it was. At the core of Christ’s church. A stone beacon, screaming tobe heard. A reminder to those few sages who remembered where it all began. Thischurch, born of the womb of the Ancient Mysteries, still bore her rites andsymbols.One symbol above all.Adorning her altars, vestments, spires, and Scripture was the singular image ofChristianity—that of a precious, sacrificed human being. Christianity, more thanany other faith, understood the transformative power of sacrifice. Even now, tohonor the sacrifice made by Jesus, his followers proffered their own feeblegestures of personal sacrifice . . . fasting, Lenten renunciation, tithing.All of those offerings are impotent, of course. Without blood . . . there is notrue sacrifice.The powers of darkness had long embraced blood sacrifice, and in doing so, theyhad grown so strong that the powers of goodness now struggled to keep them incheck. Soon the Light would be entirely consumed, and the practitioners ofdarkness would move freely through the minds of men."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 97“Eight Franklin Square must exist,” Sato insisted. “Look it up again!”Nola Kaye sat at her desk and adjusted her headset. “Ma’am, I’ve checkedeverywhere . . . that address doesn’t exist in D.C.”“But I’m on the roof of One Franklin Square,” Sato said. “There has to be anEight!”Director Sato’s on a roof? “Hold on.” Nola began running a new search.

The address is actually 1301 KStreet.”The news seemed to confound the director. “Nola, I don’t have time toexplain—the pyramid clearly points to the address Eight Franklin Square.”Nola sat bolt upright. The pyramid points to a specific location?“The inscription,” Sato continued, “reads: ‘The secret hides within TheOrder—Eight Franklin Square.’”Nola could scarcely imagine. “An order like . . . a Masonic or fraternal order?”“I assume so,” Sato replied.Nola thought a moment, and then began typing again. “Ma’am, maybe the streetnumbers on the square changed over the years? I mean, if this pyramid is as oldas legend claims, maybe the numbers on Franklin Square were different when thepyramid was built? I’m now running a search without the number eight . . . for .. . ‘the order’ . . . ‘Franklin Square’ . . . and ‘Washington, D.C.’ . . . andthis way, we might get some idea if there’s—” She stalled midsentence as thesearch results appeared.“What have you got?” Sato demanded.Nola stared at the first result on the list—a spectacular image of the GreatPyramid of Egypt—which served as the thematic backdrop for the home pagededicated to a building on Franklin Square. The building was unlike any otherbuilding on the square.Or in the entire city, for that matter.What stopped Nola cold was not the building’s bizarre architecture, but ratherthe description of its purpose. According to the Web site, this unusual edificewas built as a sacred mystical shrine, designed by . . . and designed for . . .an ancient secret order."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 98Robert Langdon regained consciousness with a crippling headache.Where am I?Wherever he was, it was dark. Deep-cave dark, and deathly silent.He was lying on his back with his arms at his side. Confused, he tried movinghis fingers and toes, relieved to find they moved freely with no pain. Whathappened? With the exception of his headache and the profound darkness,everything seemed more or less normal.Almost everything.Langdon realized he was lying on a hard floor that felt unusually smooth, like asheet of glass. Stranger still, he could feel that the slick surface was indirect contact with his bare flesh . . . shoulders, back, buttocks, thighs,calves. Am I naked? Puzzled, he ran his hands over his body.Jesus! Where the hell are my clothes?In the darkness, the cobwebs began to lift, and Langdon saw flashes of memory .. . frightening snapshots . . . a dead CIA agent . . . the face of a tattooedbeast . . . Langdon’s head smashing into the floor. The images came faster . . .and now he recalled the sickening image of Katherine Solomon bound and gagged onthe dining-room floor.My God!Langdon sat bolt upright, and as he did, his forehead smashed into somethingsuspended only inches above him. Pain exploded through his skull and he fellback, teetering near unconsciousness. Groggy, he reached up with his hands,groping in the darkness to find the obstacle. What he found made no sense tohim. It seemed this room’s ceiling was less than a foot above him. What in theworld? As he spread his arms to his sides in an attempt to roll over, both ofhis hands hit sidewalls.The truth now dawned on him. Robert Langdon was not in a room at all.I’m in a box!In the darkness of his small, coffinlike container, Langdon began poundingwildly with his fist. He shouted over and over for help. The terror that grippedhim deepened with each passing instant until it was intolerable.I have been buried alive.The lid of Langdon’s strange coffin refused to budge, even with the full forceof his arms and legs pushing upward in wild panic. The box, from all he couldtell, was made of heavy fiberglass. Airtight. Soundproof. Lightproof.Escape-proof.I am going to suffocate alone in this box.He thought of the deep well into which he had fallen as a young boy, and of theterrifying night he spent treading water alone in the darkness of a bottomlesspit. That trauma had scarred Langdon’s psyche, burdening him with anoverwhelming phobia of enclosed spaces.Tonight, buried alive, Robert Langdon was living his ultimate nightmare.Katherine Solomon trembled in silence on the floor of Mal’akh’s dining room. Thesharp wire around her wrists and ankles had already cut into her, and theslightest movements seemed only to tighten her bonds.The tattooed man had brutally knocked Langdon unconscious and dragged his limpbody across the floor along with his leather bag and the stone pyramid. Wherethey had gone, Katherine had no idea. The agent who had accompanied them wasdead. She had not heard a sound in many minutes, and she wondered if thetattooed man and Langdon were still inside the house. She had been trying toscream for help, but with each attempt, the rag in her mouth crept backdangerously closer to her windpipe.Now she felt approaching footsteps on the floor, and she turned her head, hopingagainst hope that someone was coming to help. The massive silhouette of hercaptor materialized in the hallway. Katherine recoiled as she flashed on theimage of him standing in her family home ten years earlier.He killed my family.Now he strode toward her. Langdon was nowhere to be seen. The man crouched downand gripped her around the waist, hoisting her roughly onto his shoulder. Thewire sliced into her wrists, and the rag muffled her muted cries of pain. Hecarried her down the hallway toward the living room, where, earlier today, thetwo of them had calmly sipped tea together.Where is he taking me?!He carried Katherine across the living room and stopped directly in front of thelarge oil painting of the Three Graces that she had admired this afternoon.“You mentioned you liked this painting,” the man whispered, his lips practicallytouching her ear. “I’m glad. It may be the last thing of beauty you see.”With that, he reached out and pressed his palm into the right side of theenormous frame. To Katherine’s shock, the painting rotated into the wall,turning on a central pivot like a revolving door. A hidden doorway.Katherine tried to wriggle free, but the man held her firmly, carrying herthrough the opening behind the canvas. As the Three Graces pivoted shut behindthem, she could see heavy insulation on the back of the canvas. Whatever soundswere made back here were apparently not meant to be heard by the outside world.The space behind the painting was cramped, more like a hallway than a room. Theman carried her to the far side and opened a heavy door, carrying her through itonto a small landing. Katherine found herself looking down a narrow ramp into adeep basement. She drew a breath to scream, but the rag was choking her.The incline was steep and narrow. The walls on either side were made of cement,awash in a bluish light that seemed to emanate from below. The air that waftedup was warm and pungent, laden with an eerie blend of smells . . . the sharpbite of chemicals, the smooth calm of incense, the earthy musk of human sweat,and, pervading it all, a distinct aura of visceral, animal fear.“Your science impressed me,” the man whispered as they reached the bottom of theramp. “I hope mine impresses you.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 99CIA field agent Turner Simkins crouched in the darkness of Franklin Park andkept his steady gaze on Warren Bellamy. Nobody had taken the bait yet, but itwas still early.Simkins’s transceiver beeped, and he activated it, hoping one of his men hadspotted something. But it was Sato. She had new information.Simkins listened and agreed with her concern. “Hold on,” he said. “I’ll see if Ican get a visual.” He crawled through the bushes in which he was hiding andpeered back in the direction from which he had entered the square. After somemaneuvering, he finally opened a sight line.Holy shit.He was staring at a building that looked like an Old World mosque. Nestledbetween two much larger buildings, the Moorish facade was made of gleamingterra-cotta tile laid in intricate multicolored designs. Above the three massivedoors, two tiers of lancet windows looked as if Arabian archers might appear andopen fire if anyone approached uninvited.“I see it,” Simkins said.“Any activity?”“Nothing.”“Good. I need you to reposition and watch it very carefully. It’s called theAlmas Shrine Temple, and it’s the headquarters of a mystical order.”Simkins had worked in the D.C. area for a long time but was not familiar withthis temple or any ancient mystical order headquartered on Franklin Square.“This building,” Sato said, “belongs to a group called the Ancient Arabic Orderof Nobles of the Mystic Shrine.”“Never heard of them.”“I think you have,” Sato said. “They’re an appendant body of the Masons, morecommonly known as the Shriners.”Simkins shot a dubious glance at the ornate building. The Shriners? The guys whobuild hospitals for kids? He could imagine no “order” less ominous sounding thana fraternity of philanthropists who wore little red fezzes and marched inparades.Even so, Sato’s concerns were valid. “Ma’am, if our target realizes that thisbuilding is in fact ‘The Order’ on Franklin Square, he won’t need the address.He’ll simply bypass the rendezvous and go directly to the correct location.”“My thoughts exactly. Keep an eye on the entrance.”“Yes, ma’am.”“Any word from Agent Hartmann in Kalorama Heights?”“No, ma’am. You asked him to phone you directly.”“Well, he hasn’t.”Odd, Simkins thought, checking his watch. He’s overdue."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 100Robert Langdon lay shivering, naked and alone in total blackness. Paralyzed byfear, he was no longer pounding or shouting. Instead, he had closed his eyes andwas doing his best to control his hammering heart and his panicked breathing.You are lying beneath a vast, nighttime sky, he tried to convince himself. Thereis nothing above you but miles of wide-open space.This calming visualization had been the only way he had managed to survive arecent stint in an enclosed MRI machine . . . that and a triple dose of Valium.Tonight, however, the visualization was having no effect whatsoever.The rag in Katherine Solomon’s mouth had shifted backward and was all butchoking her. Her captor had carried her down a narrow ramp and into a darkbasement corridor. At the far end of the hall, she had glimpsed a room lit withan eerie reddish-purple light, but they’d never made it that far. The man hadstopped instead at a small side room, carried her inside, and placed her on awooden chair. He had set her down with her bound wrists behind the chair back soshe could not move.Now Katherine could feel the wire on her wrists slicing deeper into her flesh.The pain barely registered next to the rising panic she was feeling over beingunable to breathe. The cloth in her mouth was slipping deeper into her throat,and she felt herself gagging reflexively. Her vision started to tunnel.Behind her, the tattooed man closed the room’s lone door and flipped on thelight. Katherine’s eyes were watering profusely now, and she could no longerdifferentiate objects in her immediate surroundings. Everything had become ablur.A distorted vision of colorful flesh appeared before her, and Katherine felt hereyes starting to flutter as she teetered on the brink of unconsciousness. Ascale-covered arm reached out and yanked the rag from her mouth.Katherine gasped, inhaling deep breaths, coughing and choking as her lungsflooded with precious air. Slowly, her vision began to clear, and she foundherself looking into the demon’s face. The visage was barely human. Blanketinghis neck, face, and shaved head was an astounding pattern of bizarre tattooedsymbols. With the exception of a small circle on top of his head, every inch ofhis body appeared to be decorated. A massive double-headed phoenix on his chestglared at her through nipple eyes like some kind of ravenous vulture, patientlywaiting for her death.“Open your mouth,” the man whispered.Katherine stared at the monster with total revulsion. What?“Open your mouth,” the man repeated. “Or the cloth goes back in.”Trembling, Katherine opened her mouth. The man extended his thick, tattooedindex finger, inserting it between her lips. When he touched her tongue,Katherine thought she would vomit. He extracted his wet finger and raised it tothe top of his shaved head. Closing his eyes, he massaged her saliva into hissmall circular patch of untattooed flesh.Repulsed, Katherine looked away.The room in which she was sitting appeared to be a boiler room of somesort—pipes on the walls, gurgling sounds, fluorescent lights. Before she couldtake in her surroundings, though, her gaze stopped dead on something beside heron the floor. A pile of clothing—turtleneck, tweed sport coat, loafers, MickeyMouse watch.“My God!” She wheeled back to the tattooed animal before her. “What have youdone with Robert?!”“Shh,” the man whispered. “Or he’ll hear you.” He stepped to one side andmotioned behind him.Langdon was not there. All Katherine saw was a huge black fiberglass box. Itsshape bore an unsettling resemblance to the heavy crates in which corpses wereshipped back from war. Two massive clasps firmly locked the box shut.“He’s inside?!” Katherine blurted. “But . . . he’ll suffocate!”“No, he won’t,” the man said, pointing to a series of transparent pipes that ranalong the wall into the bottom of the crate. “He’ll only wish he could.”In total darkness, Langdon listened intently to the muffled vibrations he nowheard from the outside world. Voices? He began pounding on the box and shoutingat the top of his lungs. “Help! Can anyone hear me?!”Far off, a muted voice called out. “Robert! My God, no! NO!”He knew the voice. It was Katherine, and she sounded terrified. Even so, it wasa welcome sound. Langdon drew a breath to call out to her, but he stopped short,feeling an unexpected sensation at the back of his neck. A faint breeze seemedto be emanating from the bottom of the box. How is that possible? He lay verystill, taking stock. Yes, definitely. He could feel the tiny hairs on the backof his neck being tickled by air movement.Instinctively, Langdon began feeling along the floor of the box, searching forthe source of the air. It took only a moment to locate. There’s a tiny vent! Thesmall perforated opening felt similar to a drain plate on a sink or tub, exceptthat a soft, steady breeze was now coming up through it.He’s pumping air in for me. He doesn’t want me to suffocate.Langdon’s relief was short-lived. A terrifying sound was now emanating upthrough the holes in the vent. It was the unmistakable gurgle of flowing liquid. . . coming his way.Katherine stared in disbelief at the clear shaft of liquid that was progressingdown one of the pipes toward Langdon’s crate. The scene looked like some kind oftwisted stage magician’s act.He’s pumping water into the crate?!Katherine strained at her bonds, ignoring the deep bite of the wires around herwrists. All she could do was look on in panic. She could hear Langdon poundingin desperation, but as the water reached the underside of the container, thepounding stopped. There was a moment of terrified silence. Then the poundingstarted again with renewed desperation.“Let him out!” Katherine begged. “Please! You can’t do this!”“Drowning is a terrible death, you know.” The man spoke calmly as he pacedaround her in circles. “Your assistant, Trish, could tell you that.”Katherine heard his words, but she could barely process them.“You may remember that I almost drowned once,” the man whispered. “It was onyour family’s estate in Potomac. Your brother shot me, and I fell through theice, out at Zach’s bridge.”Katherine glared at him, filled with loathing. The night you killed my mother.“The gods protected me that night,” he said. “And they showed me the way . . .to become one of them.”The water gurgling into the box behind Langdon’s head felt warm . . . bodytemperature. The fluid was already several inches deep and had completelyswallowed the back of his naked body. As it began creeping up his rib cage,Langdon felt a stark reality closing in fast.I’m going to die.With renewed panic, he raised his arms and began pounding wildly again."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 101“You’ve got to let him out!” Katherine begged, crying now. “We’ll do whateveryou want!” She could hear Langdon pounding more frantically as the water flowedinto his container.The tattooed man just smiled. “You’re easier than your brother. The things I hadto do to get Peter to tell me his secrets . . .”“Where is he?!” she demanded. “Where is Peter?! Tell me! We did exactly what youwanted! We solved the pyramid and—”“No, you did not solve the pyramid. You played a game. You withheld informationand brought a government agent to my home. Hardly behavior I intend to reward.”“We didn’t have a choice,” she replied, choking back the tears. “The CIA islooking for you. They made us travel with an agent. I’ll tell you everything.Just let Robert out!” Katherine could hear Langdon shouting and pounding in thecrate, and she could see the water flowing through the pipe. She knew he didn’thave a lot of time.In front of her, the tattooed man spoke calmly, stroking his chin. “I assumethere are agents waiting for me at Franklin Square?”Katherine said nothing, and the man placed his massive palms on her shoulders,slowly pulling her forward. With her arms still wire-bound be hind the chairback, her shoulders strained, burning with pain, threatening to dislocate.“Yes!” Katherine said. “There are agents at Franklin Square!”He pulled harder. “What is the address on the capstone?”The pain in her wrists and shoulders grew unbearable, but Katherine saidnothing.“You can tell me now, Katherine, or I’ll break your arms and ask you again.”“Eight!” she gasped in pain. “The missing number is eight! The capstone says:‘The secret hides within The Order—Eight Franklin Square!’ I swear it. I don’tknow what else to tell you! It’s Eight Franklin Square!”The man still did not release her shoulders.“That’s all I know!” Katherine said. “That’s the address! Let go of me! LetRobert out of that tank!”“I would . . .” the man said, “but there’s one problem. I can’t go to EightFranklin Square without being caught. Tell me, what’s at that address?”“I don’t know!”“And the symbols on the base of the pyramid? On the underside? Do you know theirmeaning?”“What symbols on the base?” Katherine had no idea what he was talking about.“The bottom has no symbols. It’s smooth, blank stone!”Apparently immune to the muffled cries for help emanating from the coffinlikecrate, the tattooed man calmly padded over to Langdon’s day-bag and retrievedthe stone pyramid. Then he returned to Katherine and held it up before her eyesso she could see the base.When Katherine saw the engraved symbols, she gasped in bewilderment.But . . . that’s impossible!image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_023_r1.jpg]The bottom of the pyramid was entirely covered with intricate carvings. Therewas nothing there before! I’m sure of it! She had no idea what these symbolscould possibly mean. They seemed to span every mystical tradition, includingmany she could not even place.Total chaos.“I . . . have no idea what this means,” she said.“Nor do I,” her captor said. “Fortunately, we have a specialist at ourdisposal.” He glanced at the crate. “Let’s ask him, shall we?” He carried thepyramid toward the crate.For a brief instant of hope, Katherine thought he was going to unclasp the lid.Instead, he sat calmly on top of the box, reached down, and slid a small panelto one side, revealing a Plexiglas window in the top of the tank.Light!Langdon covered his eyes, squinting into the ray of light that now streamed infrom above. As his eyes adjusted, hope turned to confusion. He was looking upthrough what appeared to be a window in the top of his crate. Through thewindow, he saw a white ceiling and a fluorescent light.Without warning, the tattooed face appeared above him, peering down.“Where is Katherine?!” Langdon shouted. “Let me out!”The man smiled. “Your friend Katherine is here with me,” the man said. “I havethe power to spare her life. Your life as well. But your time is short, so Isuggest you listen carefully.”Langdon could barely hear him through the glass, and the water had risen higher,creeping across his chest.“Are you aware,” the man asked, “that there are symbols on the base of thepyramid?”“Yes!” Langdon shouted, having seen the extensive array of symbols when thepyramid had lain on the floor upstairs. “But I have no idea what they mean! Youneed to go to Eight Franklin Square! The answer is there! That’s what thecapstone—”“Professor, you and I both know the CIA is waiting for me there. I have nointention of walking into a trap. Besides, I didn’t need the street number.There is only one building on that square that could possibly be relevant—theAlmas Shrine Temple.” He paused, staring down at Langdon. “The Ancient ArabicOrder of Nobles of the Mystic Shrine.”Langdon was confused. He was familiar with the Almas Temple, but he hadforgotten it was on Franklin Square. The Shriners are . . . “The Order”? Theirtemple sits atop a secret staircase? It made no historical sense whatsoever, butLangdon was in no position at the moment to debate history. “Yes!” he shouted.“That must be it! The secret hides within The Order!”“You’re familiar with the building?”“Absolutely!” Langdon raised his throbbing head to keep his ears above thequickly rising liquid. “I can help you! Let me out!”“So you believe you can tell me what this temple has to do with the symbols onthe base of the pyramid?”“Yes! Let me just look at the symbols!”“Very well, then. Let’s see what you come up with.”Hurry! With the warm liquid rising around him, Langdon pushed up on the lid,willing the man to unclasp it. Please! Hurry! But the lid never opened. Instead,the base of the pyramid suddenly appeared, hovering above the Plexiglas window.Langdon stared up in panic.“I trust this view is close enough for you?”The man held the pyramid in histattooed hands. “Think fast, Professor. I’m guessing you have less than sixtyseconds.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 102Robert Langdon had often heard it said that an animal, when cornered, wascapable of miraculous feats of strength. Nonetheless, when he threw his fullforce into the underside of his crate, nothing budged at all. Around him, theliquid continued rising steadily. With no more than six inches of breathing roomleft, Langdon had lifted his head into the pocket of air that remained. He wasnow face-to-face with the Plexiglas window, his eyes only inches away from theunderside of the stone pyramid whose baffling engraving hovered above him.I have no idea what this means.Concealed for over a century beneath a hardened mixture of wax and stone dust,the Masonic Pyramid’s final inscription was now laid bare. The engraving was aperfectly square grid of symbols from every tradition imaginable—alchemical,astrological, heraldic, angelic, magical, numeric, sigilic, Greek, Latin. As atotality, this was symbolic anarchy—a bowl of alphabet soup whose letters camefrom dozens of different languages, cultures, and time periods.Total chaos.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_023_r1.jpg]Symbologist Robert Langdon, in his wildest academic interpretations, could notfathom how this grid of symbols could be deciphered to mean anything at all.Order from this chaos? Impossible.The liquid was now creeping over his Adam’s apple, and Langdon could feel hislevel of terror rising along with it. He continued banging on the tank. Thepyramid stared back at him tauntingly.In frantic desperation, Langdon focused every bit of his mental energy on thechessboard of symbols. What could they possibly mean? Unfortunately, theassortment seemed so disparate that he could not even imagine where to begin.They’re not even from the same eras in history!Outside the tank, her voice muffled but audible, Katherine could be heardtearfully begging for Langdon’s release. Despite his failure to see a solution,the prospect of death seemed to motivate every cell in his body to find one. Hefelt a strange clarity of mind, unlike anything he had ever experienced. Think!He scanned the grid intensely, searching for some clue—a pattern, a hidden word,a special icon, anything at all—but he saw only a grid of unrelated symbols.Chaos.With each passing second, Langdon had begun to feel an eerie numbness overtakinghis body. It was as if his very flesh were preparing to shield his mind from thepain of death. The water was now threatening to pour into his ears, and helifted his head as far as he could, pushing it against the top of the crate.Frightening images began flashing before his eyes. A boy in New England treadingwater at the bottom of a dark well. A man in Rome trapped beneath a skeleton inan overturned coffin.Katherine’s shouts were growing more frantic. From all Langdon could hear, shewas trying to reason with a madman—insisting that Langdon could not be expectedto decipher the pyramid without going to visit the Almas Temple. “That buildingobviously holds the missing piece to this puzzle! How can Robert decipher thepyramid without all the information?!”Langdon appreciated her efforts, and yet he felt certain that “Eight FranklinSquare” was not pointing to the Almas Temple. The time line is all wrong!According to legend, the Masonic Pyramid was created in the mid-1800s, decadesbefore the Shriners even existed. In fact, Langdon realized, it was probablybefore the square was even called Franklin Square. The capstone could notpossibly have been pointing to an unbuilt building at a nonexistent address.Whatever “Eight Franklin Square” was pointing to . . . it had to exist in 1850.Unfortunately, Langdon was drawing a total blank.He probed his memory banks for anything that could possibly fit the time line.Eight Franklin Square? Something that was in existence in 1850? Langdon came upwith nothing. The liquid was trickling into his ears now. Fighting his terror,he stared up at the grid of symbols on the glass. I don’t understand theconnection! In a petrified frenzy, his mind began spewing all the far-flungparallels it could generate.Eight Franklin Square . . . squares . . . this grid of symbols is a square . . .the square and the compass are Masonic symbols . . . Masonic altars are square .. . squares have ninety-degree angles. The water kept rising, but Langdonblocked it out. Eight Franklin . . . eight . . . this grid is eight-by-eight . .. Franklin has eight letters . . . “The Order” has eight letters . . . 8 is therotated symbol ∞ for infinity . . . eight is the number of destruction innumerology . . .Langdon had no idea.Outside the tank, Katherine was still pleading, but Langdon’s hearing was nowintermittent as the water was sloshing around his head.“ . . . impossible without knowing . . . capstone’s message clearly . . . thesecret hides within—”Then she was gone.Water poured into Langdon’s ears, blotting out the last of Katherine’s voice. Asudden womblike silence engulfed him, and Langdon realized he truly was going todie.The secret hides within—Katherine’s final words echoed through the hush of his tomb.The secret hides within . . .Strangely, Langdon realized he had heard these exact words many times before.The secret hides . . . within.Even now, it seemed, the Ancient Mysteries were taunting him. “The secret hideswithin” was the core tenet of the mysteries, urging man kind to seek God not inthe heavens above . . . but rather within himself. The secret hides within. Itwas the message of all the great mystical teachers.The kingdom of God is within you, said Jesus Christ.Know thyself, said Pythagoras.Know ye not that ye are gods, said Hermes Trismegistus.The list went on and on . . .All the mystical teachings of the ages had attempted to convey this one idea.The secret hides within. Even so, mankind continued looking to the heavens forthe face of God.This realization, for Langdon, now became an ultimate irony. Right now, with hiseyes facing the heavens like all the blind men who preceded him, Robert Langdonsuddenly saw the light.It hit him like a bolt from above.Thesecret hideswithin The OrderEight Franklin SquareIn a flash he understood.The message on the capstone was suddenly crystal clear. Its meaning had beenstaring him in the face all night. The text on the capstone, like the MasonicPyramid itself, was a symbolon—a code in pieces—a message written in parts. Thecapstone’s meaning was camouflaged in so simple a manner that Langdon couldscarcely believe he and Katherine had not spotted it.More astonishing still, Langdon now realized that the message on the capstonedid indeed reveal exactly how to decipher the grid of symbols on the base of thepyramid. It was so very simple. Exactly as Peter Solomon had promised, thegolden capstone was a potent talisman with the power to bring order from chaos.Langdon began pounding on the lid and shouting, “I know! I know!”Above him, the stone pyramid lifted off and hovered away. In its place, thetattooed face reappeared, its chilling visage staring down through the smallwindow.“I solved it!” Langdon shouted. “Let me out!”When the tattooed man spoke, Langdon’s submerged ears heard nothing. His eyes,however, saw the lips speak two words. “Tell me.”“I will!” Langdon screamed, the water almost to his eyes. “Let me out! I’llexplain everything!” It’s so simple.The man’s lips moved again. “Tell me now . . . or die.”With the water rising through the final inch of air space, Langdon tipped hishead back to keep his mouth above the waterline. As he did so, warm liquidpoured into his eyes, blurring his vision. Arching his back, he pressed hismouth against the Plexiglas window.Then, with his last few seconds of air, Robert Langdon shared the secret of howto decipher the Masonic Pyramid.As he finished speaking, the liquid rose around his lips. Instinctively, Langdondrew a final breath and clamped his mouth shut. A moment later, the fluidcovered him entirely, reaching the top of his tomb and spreading out across thePlexiglas.He did it, Mal’akh realized. Langdon figured out how to solve the pyramid.The answer was so simple. So obvious.Beneath the window, the submerged face of Robert Langdon stared up at him withdesperate and beseeching eyes.Mal’akh shook his head at him and slowly mouthed the words: “Thank you,Professor. Enjoy the afterlife.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 103As a serious swimmer, Robert Langdon had often wondered what it would feel liketo drown. He now knew he was going to learn firsthand. Although he could holdhis breath longer than most people, he could already feel his body reacting tothe absence of air. Carbon dioxide was accumulating in his blood, bringing withit the instinctual urge to inhale. Do not breathe! The reflex to inhale wasincreasing in intensity with each passing moment. Langdon knew very soon hewould reach what was called the breath-hold breakpoint—that critical moment atwhich a person could no longer voluntarily hold his breath.Open the lid! Langdon’s instinct was to pound and struggle, but he knew betterthan to waste valuable oxygen. All he could do was stare up through the blur ofwater above him and hope. The world outside was now only a hazy patch of lightabove the Plexiglas window. His core muscles had begun burning, and he knewhypoxia was setting in.Suddenly a beautiful and ghostly face appeared, gazing down at him. It wasKatherine, her soft features looking almost ethereal through the veil of liquid.Their eyes met through the Plexiglas window, and for an instant, Langdon thoughthe was saved. Katherine! Then he heard her muted cries of horror and realizedshe was being held there by their captor. The tattooed monster was forcing herto bear witness to what was about to happen.Katherine, I’m sorry . . .In this strange, dark place, trapped underwater, Langdon strained to comprehendthat these would be his final moments of life. Soon he would cease to exist . .. everything he was . . . or had ever been . . . or would ever be . . . wasending. When his brain died, all of the memories held in his gray matter, alongwith all of the knowledge he had acquired, would simply evaporate in a flood ofchemical reactions.In this moment, Robert Langdon realized his true insignificance in the universe.It was as lonely and humbling a feeling as he had ever experienced. Almostthankfully, he could feel the breath-hold breakpoint arriving.The moment was upon him.Langdon’s lungs forced out their spent contents, collapsing in eager preparationto inhale. Still he held out an instant longer. His final second. Then, like aman no longer able to hold his hand to a burning stove, he gave himself over tofate.Reflex overruled reason.His lips parted.His lungs expanded.And the liquid came pouring in.The pain that filled his chest was greater than Langdon had ever imagined. Theliquid burned as it poured into his lungs. Instantly, the pain shot upward intohis skull, and he felt like his head was being crushed in a vise. There wasgreat thundering in his ears, and through it all, Katherine Solomon wasscreaming.There was a blinding flash of light.And then blackness.Robert Langdon was gone."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 104It’s over.Katherine Solomon had stopped screaming. The drowning she had just witnessed hadleft her catatonic, virtually paralyzed with shock and despair.Beneath the Plexiglas window, Langdon’s dead eyes stared past her into emptyspace. His frozen expression was one of pain and regret. The last tiny airbubbles trickled out of his lifeless mouth, and then, as if consenting to giveup his ghost, the Harvard professor slowly began sinking to the bottom of thetank . . . where he disappeared into the shadows.He’s gone. Katherine felt numb.The tattooed man reached down, and with pitiless finality, he slid the smallviewing window closed, sealing Langdon’s corpse inside.Then he smiled at her. “Shall we?”Before Katherine could respond, he hoisted her grief-stricken body onto hisshoulder, turned out the light, and carried her out of the room. With a fewpowerful strides, he transported her to the end of the hall, into a large spacethat seemed to be bathed in a reddish-purple light. The room smelled likeincense. He carried her to a square table in the center of the room and droppedher hard on her back, knocking the wind out of her. The surface felt rough andcold. Is this stone?Katherine had hardly gotten her bearings before the man had removed the wirefrom her wrists and ankles. Instinctively, she attempted to fight him off, buther cramped arms and legs barely responded. He now began strapping her to thetable with heavy leather bands, cinching one strap across her knees and thenbuckling a second across her hips, pinning her arms at her sides. Then he placeda final strap across her sternum, just above her breasts.It had all taken only moments, and Katherine was again immobilized. Her wristsand ankles throbbed now as the circulation returned to her limbs.“Open your mouth,” the man whispered, licking his own tattooed lips.Katherine clenched her teeth in revulsion.The man again reached out with his index finger and ran it slowly around herlips, making her skin crawl. She clenched her teeth tighter. The tattooed manchuckled and, using his other hand, found a pressure point on her neck andsqueezed. Katherine’s jaw instantly dropped open. She could feel his fingerentering her mouth and running along her tongue. She gagged and tried to biteit, but the finger was already gone. Still grinning, he raised his moistfingertip before her eyes. Then he closed his eyes and, once again, rubbed hersaliva into the bare circle of flesh on his head.The man sighed and slowly opened his eyes. Then, with an eerie calm, he turnedand left the room.In the sudden silence, Katherine could feel her heart pounding. Directly overher, an unusual series of lights seemed to be modulating from purple red to adeep crimson, illuminating the room’s low ceiling. When she saw the ceiling, allshe could do was stare. Every inch was covered with drawings. The mind-bogglingcollage above her appeared to depict the celestial sky. Stars, planets, andconstellations mingled with astrological symbols, charts, and formulas. Therewere arrows predicting elliptical orbits, geometric symbols indicating angles ofascension, and zodiacal creatures peering down at her. It looked like a madscientist had gotten loose in the Sistine Chapel.Turning her head, Katherine looked away, but the wall to her left was no better.A series of candles on medieval floor stands shed a flickering glow on a wallthat was completely hidden beneath pages of text, photos, and drawings. Some ofthe pages looked like papyrus or vellum torn from ancient books; others wereobviously from newer texts; mixed in were photographs, drawings, maps, andschematics; all of them appeared to have been glued to the wall with meticulouscare. A spiderweb of strings had been thumbtacked across them, interconnectingthem in limitless chaotic possibilities.Katherine again looked away, turning her head in the other direction.Unfortunately, this provided the most terrifying view of all.Adjacent to the stone slab on which she was strapped, there stood a small sidecounter that instantly reminded her of an instrument table from a hospitaloperating room. On the counter was arranged a series of objects—among them asyringe, a vial of dark liquid . . . and a large knife with a bone handle and ablade hewn of iron burnished to an unusually high shine.My God . . . what is he planning to do to me?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 105When CIA systems security specialist Rick Parrish finally loped into Nola Kaye’soffice, he was carrying a single sheet of paper.“What took you so long?!” Nola demanded. I told you to come down immediately!“Sorry,” he said, pushing up his bottle-bottom glasses on his long nose. “I wastrying to gather more information for you, but—”“Just show me what you’ve got.”Parrish handed her the printout. “It’s a redaction, but you get the gist.”Nola scanned the page in amazement.“I’m still trying to figure out how a hacker got access,” Parrish said, “but itlooks like a delegator spider hijacked one of our search—”“Forget that!” Nola blurted, glancing up from the page. “What the hell is theCIA doing with a classified file about pyramids, ancient portals, and engravedsymbolons?”“That’s what took me so long. I was trying to see what document was beingtargeted, so I traced the file path.” Parrish paused, clearing his throat. “Thisdocument turns out to be on a partition personally assigned to . . . the CIAdirector himself.”Nola wheeled, staring in disbelief. Sato’s boss has a file about the MasonicPyramid? She knew that the current director, along with many other top CIAexecutives, was a high-ranking Mason, but Nola could not imagine any of themkeeping Masonic secrets on a CIA computer.Then again, considering what she had witnessed in the last twenty-four hours,anything was possible.Agent Simkins was lying on his stomach, ensconced in the bushes of FranklinSquare. His eyes were trained on the columned entry of the Almas Temple.Nothing. No lights had come on inside, and no one had approached the door. Heturned his head and checked on Bellamy. The man was pacing alone in the middleof the park, looking cold. Really cold. Simkins could see him shaking andshivering.His phone vibrated. It was Sato.“How overdue is our target?” she demanded.Simkins checked his chronograph. “Target said twenty minutes. It’s been almostforty. Something’s wrong.”“He’s not coming,” Sato said. “It’s over.”Simkins knew she was right. “Any word from Hartmann?”“No, he never checked in from Kalorama Heights. I can’t reach him.”Simkins stiffened. If this was true, then something was definitely wrong.“I just called field support,” Sato said, “and they can’t find him either.”Holy shit. “Do they have a GPS location on the Escalade?”“Yeah. A residential address in Kalorama Heights,” Sato said. “Gather your men.We’re pulling out.”Sato clicked off her phone and gazed out at the majestic skyline of her nation’scapital. An icy wind whipped through her light jacket, and she wrapped her armsaround herself to stay warm. Director Inoue Sato was not a woman who often feltcold . . . or fear. At the moment, however, she was feeling both."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 106Mal’akh wore only his silk loincloth as he dashed up the ramp, through the steeldoor, and out through the painting into his living room. I need to preparequickly. He glanced over at the dead CIA agent in the foyer. This home is nolonger safe.Carrying the stone pyramid in one hand, Mal’akh strode directly to hisfirst-floor study and sat down at his laptop computer. As he logged in, hepictured Langdon downstairs and wondered how many days or even weeks would passbefore the submerged corpse was discovered in the secret basement. It made nodifference. Mal’akh would be long gone by then.Langdon has served his role . . . brilliantly.Not only had Langdon reunited the pieces of the Masonic Pyramid, he had figuredout how to solve the arcane grid of symbols on the base. At first glance, thesymbols seemed indecipherable . . . and yet the answer was simple . . . staringthem in the face.Mal’akh’s laptop sprang to life, the screen displaying the same e-mail he hadreceived earlier—a photograph of a glowing capstone, partially blocked by WarrenBellamy’s finger.Thesecret hideswithin The Order.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_022_r1.jpg] Franklin Square.Eight . . . Franklin Square, Katherine had told Mal’akh. She had also admittedthat CIA agents were staking out Franklin Square, hoping to capture Mal’akh andalso figure out what order was being referenced by the capstone. The Masons? TheShriners? The Rosicrucians?None of these, Mal’akh now knew. Langdon saw the truth.Ten minutes earlier, with liquid rising around his face, the Harvard professorhad figured out the key to solving the pyramid. “The Order Eight FranklinSquare!” he had shouted, terror in his eyes. “The secret hides within The OrderEight Franklin Square!”At first, Mal’akh failed to understand his meaning.“It’s not an address!” Langdon yelled, his mouth pressed to the Plexiglaswindow. “The Order Eight Franklin Square! It’s a magic square!” Then he saidsomething about Albrecht Dürer . . . and how the pyramid’s first code was a clueto breaking this final one.Mal’akh was familiar with magic squares—kameas, as the early mystics calledthem. The ancient text De Occulta Philosophia described in detail the mysticalpower of magic squares and the methods for designing powerful sigils based onmagical grids of numbers. Now Langdon was telling him that a magic square heldthe key to deciphering the base of the pyramid?“You need an eight-by-eight magic square!” the professor had been yelling, hislips the only part of his body above the liquid. “Magic squares are categorizedin orders! A three-by-three square is an ‘order three’! A four-by-four square isan ‘order four’! You need an ‘order eight’!”The liquid had been about to engulf Langdon entirely, and the professor drew onelast desperate breath and shouted out something about a famous Mason . . . anAmerican forefather . . . a scientist, mystic, mathematician, inventor . . . aswell as the creator of the mystical kamea that bore his name to this day.Franklin.In a flash, Mal’akh knew Langdon was right.Now, breathless with anticipation, Mal’akh sat upstairs at his laptop. He ran aquick Web search, received dozens of hits, chose one, and began reading.THE ORDER EIGHT FRANKLIN SQUAREOne of history’s best-known magic squares is the order-eight square published in1769 by American scientist Benjamin Franklin, and which became famous for itsinclusion of never-before-seen “bent diagonal summations.” Franklin’s obsessionwith this mystical art form most likely stemmed from his personal associationswith the prominent alchemists and mystics of his day, as well as his own beliefin astrology, which were the underpinnings for the predictions made in his PoorRichard’s Almanack.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_024_r1.jpg]Mal’akh studied Franklin’s famous creation—a unique arrangement of the numbers 1through 64—in which every row, column, and diagonal added up to the same magicalconstant. The secret hides within The Order Eight Franklin Square.Mal’akh smiled. Trembling with excitement, he grabbed the stone pyramid andflipped it over, examining the base.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_023_r1.jpg]These sixty-four symbols needed to be reorganized and arranged in a differentorder, their sequence defined by the numbers in Franklin’s magic square.Although Mal’akh could not imagine how this chaotic grid of symbols wouldsuddenly make sense in a different order, he had faith in the ancient promise.Ordo ab chao.Heart racing, he took out a sheet of paper and quickly drew an emptyeight-by-eight grid. Then he began inserting the symbols, one by one, in theirnewly defined positions. Almost immediately, to his astonishment, the grid beganmaking sense.Order from chaos!He completed the entire decryption and stared in disbelief at the solutionbefore him. A stark image had taken shape. The jumbled grid had been transformed. . . reorganized . . . and although Mal’akh could not grasp the meaning of theentire message, he understood enough . . . enough to know exactly where he wasnow headed.The pyramid points the way.The grid pointed to one of the world’s great mystical locations. Incredibly, itwas the same location at which Mal’akh had always fantasized he would completehis journey.Destiny."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 107The stone table felt cold beneath Katherine Solomon’s back.Horrifying images of Robert’s death continued to swirl through her mind, alongwith thoughts of her brother. Is Peter dead, too? The strange knife on thenearby table kept bringing flashes of what might lie in store for her as well.Is this really the end?Oddly, her thoughts turned abruptly to her research . . . to Noetic Science . .. and to her recent breakthroughs. All of it lost . . . up in smoke. She wouldnever be able to share with the world everything she had learned. Her mostshocking discovery had taken place only a few months ago, and the results hadthe potential to redefine the way humans thought about death. Strangely,thinking now of that experiment . . . was bringing her an unexpected solace.As a young girl, Katherine Solomon had often wondered if there was life afterdeath. Does heaven exist? What happens when we die? As she grew older, herstudies in science quickly erased any fanciful notions of heaven, hell, or theafterlife. The concept of “life after death,” she came to accept, was a humanconstruct . . . a fairy tale designed to soften the horrifying truth that wasour mortality.Or so I believed . . .A year ago, Katherine and her brother had been discussing one of philosophy’smost enduring questions—the existence of the human soul—specifically the issueof whether or not humans possessed some kind of consciousness capable ofsurvival outside of the body.They both sensed that such a human soul probably did exist. Most ancientphilosophies concurred. Buddhist and Brahminical wisdom endorsedmetempsychosis—the transmigration of the soul into a new body after death;Platonists defined the body as a “prison” from which the soul escaped; and theStoics called the soul apospasma tou theu—“a particle of God”—and believed itwas recalled by God upon death.The existence of the human soul, Katherine noted with some frustration, wasprobably a concept that would never be scientifically proven. Confirming that aconsciousness survived outside the human body after death was akin to exhaling apuff of smoke and hoping to find it years later.After their discussion, Katherine had a strange notion. Her brother hadmentioned the Book of Genesis and its description of the soul as Neshemah—a kindof spiritual “intelligence” that was separate from the body. It occurred toKatherine that the word intelligence suggested the presence of thought. NoeticScience clearly suggested that thoughts had mass, and so it stood to reason,then, that the human soul might therefore also have mass.Can I weigh a human soul?The notion was impossible, of course . . . foolish even to ponder.It was three days later that Katherine suddenly woke up from a dead sleep andsat bolt upright in bed. She jumped up, drove to her lab, and immediately beganwork designing an experiment that was both startlingly simple . . . andfrighteningly bold.She had no idea if it would work, and she decided not to tell Peter about heridea until her work was complete. It took four months, but finally Katherinebrought her brother into the lab. She wheeled out a large piece of gear that shehad been keeping hidden in the back storage room.“I designed and built it myself,” she said, showing Peter her invention. “Anyguesses?”Her brother stared at the strange machine. “An incubator?”Katherine laughed and shook her head, although it was a reasonable guess. Themachine did look a bit like the transparent incubators for premature babies onesaw in hospitals. This machine, however, was adult size—a long, airtight, clearplastic capsule, like some kind of futuristic sleeping pod. It sat atop a largepiece of electronic gear.“See if this helps you guess,” Katherine said, plugging the contraption into apower source. A digital display lit up on the machine, its numbers jumpingaround as she carefully calibrated some dials.When she was done, the display read:0.0000000000 kg“A scale?” Peter asked, looking puzzled.“Not just any scale.” Katherine took a tiny scrap of paper off a nearby counterand laid it gently on top of the capsule. The numbers on the display jumpedaround again and then settled on a new reading..0008194325 kg“High-precision microbalance,” she said. “Resolution down to a few micrograms.”Peter still looked puzzled. “You built a precise scale for . . . a person?”“Exactly.” She lifted the transparent lid on the machine. “If I place a personinside this capsule and close the lid, the individual is in an entirely sealedsystem. Nothing gets in or out. No gas, no liquid, no dust particles. Nothingcan escape—not the person’s breath exhalations, evaporating sweat, body fluids,nothing.”Peter ran a hand through his thick head of silver hair, a nervous mannerismshared by Katherine. “Hmm . . . obviously a person would die in there prettyquickly.”She nodded. “Six minutes or so, depending on their breathing rate.”He turned to her. “I don’t get it.”She smiled. “You will.”Leaving the machine behind, Katherine led Peter into the Cube’s control room andsat him down in front of the plasma wall. She began typing and accessed a seriesof video files stored on the holographic drives. When the plasma wall flickeredto life, the image before them looked like home-video footage.The camera panned across a modest bedroom with an unmade bed, medicationbottles, a respirator, and a heart monitor. Peter looked baffled as the camerakept panning and finally revealed, near the center of the bedroom, Katherine’sscale contraption.Peter’s eyes widened. “What the . . . ?”The capsule’s transparent lid was open, and a very old man in an oxygen mask layinside. His elderly wife and a hospice worker stood beside the pod. The man’sbreathing was labored, and his eyes were closed.“The man in the capsule was a science teacher of mine at Yale,” Katherine said.“He and I have kept in touch over the years. He’s been very ill. He always saidhe wanted to donate his body to science, so when I explained my idea for thisexperiment, he immediately wanted to be a part of it.”Peter was apparently mute with shock as he stared at the scene unfolding beforethem.The hospice worker now turned to the man’s wife. “It’s time. He’s ready.”The old woman dabbed her tearful eyes and nodded with a resolute calm. “Okay.”Very gently, the hospice worker reached into the pod and removed the man’soxygen mask. The man stirred slightly, but his eyes remained closed. Now theworker wheeled the respirator and other equipment off to the side, leaving theold man in the capsule totally isolated in the center of the room.The dying man’s wife now approached the pod, leaned down, and gently kissed herhusband’s forehead. The old man did not open his eyes, but his lips moved, everso slightly, into a faint, loving smile.Without his oxygen mask, the man’s breathing was quickly becoming more labored.The end was obviously near. With an admirable strength and calm, the man’s wifeslowly lowered the transparent lid of the capsule and sealed it shut, exactly asKatherine had taught her.Peter recoiled in alarm. “Katherine, what in the name of God?!”“It’s okay,” Katherine whispered. “There’s plenty of air in the capsule.” Shehad seen this video dozens of times now, but it still made her pulse race. Shepointed to the scale beneath the dying man’s sealed pod. The digital numbersread:51.4534644 kg“That’s his body weight,” Katherine said.The old man’s breathing became more shallow, and Peter inched forward,transfixed.“This is what he wanted,” Katherine whispered. “Watch what happens.”The man’s wife had stepped back and was now seated on the bed, silently lookingon with the hospice worker.Over the course of the next sixty seconds, the man’s shallow breathing grewfaster, until all at once, as if the man himself had chosen the moment, hesimply took his last breath. Everything stopped.It was over.The wife and hospice worker quietly comforted each other.Nothing else happened.After a few seconds, Peter glanced over at Katherine in apparent confusion.Wait for it, she thought, redirecting Peter’s gaze to the capsule’s digitaldisplay, which still quietly glowed, showing the dead man’s weight.Then it happened.When Peter saw it, he jolted backward, almost falling out of his chair. “But . .. that’s . . .” He covered his mouth in shock. “I can’t . . .”It was seldom that the great Peter Solomon was speechless. Katherine’s reactionhad been similar the first few times she saw what had happened.Moments after the man’s death, the numbers on the scale had decreased suddenly.The man had become lighter immediately after his death. The weight change wasminuscule, but it was measurable . . . and the implications were utterlymind-boggling.Katherine recalled writing in her lab notes with a trembling hand: “There seemsto exist an invisible ‘material’ that exits the human body at the moment ofdeath. It has quantifiable mass which is unimpeded by physical barriers. I mustassume it moves in a dimension I cannot yet perceive.”From the expression of shock on her brother’s face, Katherine knew he understoodthe implications. “Katherine . . .” he stammered, blinking his gray eyes as ifto make sure he was not dreaming. “I think you just weighed the human soul.”There was a long silence between them.Katherine sensed that her brother was attempting to process all the stark andwondrous ramifications. It will take time. If what they had just witnessed wasindeed what it seemed to be—that is, evidence that a soul or consciousness orlife force could move outside the realm of the body—then a startling new lighthad just been shed on countless mystical questions: transmigration, cosmicconsciousness, near-death experiences, astral projection, remote viewing, luciddreaming, and on and on. Medical journals were filled with stories of patientswho had died on the operating table, viewed their bodies from above, and thenbeen brought back to life.Peter was silent, and Katherine now saw he had tears in his eyes. Sheunderstood. She had cried, too. Peter and Katherine had lost loved ones, and foranyone in that position, the faintest hint of the human spirit continuing afterdeath brought a glimmer of hope.He’s thinking of Zachary, Katherine thought, recognizing the deep melancholy inher brother’s eyes. For years Peter had carried the burden of responsibility forhis son’s death. He had told Katherine many times that leaving Zachary in prisonhad been the worst mistake of his life, and that he would never find a way toforgive himself.A slamming door drew Katherine’s attention, and suddenly she was back in thebasement, lying on a cold stone table. The metal door at the top of the ramp hadclosed loudly, and the tattooed man was coming back down. She could hear himentering one of the rooms down the hall, doing something inside, and thencontinuing along the hall toward the room she was in. As he entered, she couldsee that he was pushing something in front of him. Something heavy . . . onwheels. As he stepped into the light, she stared in disbelief. The tattooed manwas pushing a person in a wheelchair.Intellectually, Katherine’s brain recognized the man in the chair. Emotionally,her mind could barely accept what she was looking at.Peter?She didn’t know whether to be overjoyed that her brother was alive . . . orutterly horrified. Peter’s body had been shaved smooth. His mane of thick silverhair was all gone, as were his eyebrows, and his smooth skin glistened as if ithad been oiled. He wore a black silk gown. Where his right hand should havebeen, he had only a stump, wrapped in a clean, fresh bandage. Her brother’spain-laden eyes reached out to hers, filled with regret and sorrow.“Peter!” Her voice cracked.Her brother tried to speak but made only muffled, guttural noises. Katherine nowrealized he was bound to the wheelchair and had been gagged.The tattooed man reached down and gently stroked Peter’s shaved scalp. “I’veprepared your brother for a great honor. He has a role to play tonight.”Katherine’s entire body went rigid. No . . .“Peter and I will be leaving in a moment, but I thought you’d want to saygood-bye.”“Where are you taking him?” she said weakly.He smiled. “Peter and I must journey to the sacred mountain. That is where thetreasure lies. The Masonic Pyramid has revealed the location. Your friend RobertLangdon was most helpful.”Katherine looked into her brother’s eyes. “He killed . . . Robert.”Her brother’s expression contorted in agony, and he shook his head violently, asif unable to bear any more pain.“Now, now, Peter,” the man said, again stroking Peter’s scalp. “Don’t let thisruin the moment. Say good-bye to your little sister. This is your final familyreunion.”Katherine felt her mind welling with desperation. “Why are you doing this?!” sheshouted at him. “What have we ever done to you?! Why do you hate my family somuch?!”The tattooed man came over and placed his mouth right next to her ear. “I havemy reasons, Katherine.” Then he walked to the side table and picked up thestrange knife. He brought it over to her and ran the burnished blade across hercheek. “This is arguably the most famous knife in history.”Katherine knew of no famous knives, but it looked foreboding and ancient. Theblade felt razor sharp.“Don’t worry,” he said. “I have no intention of wasting its power on you.I’m saving it for a more worthy sacrifice . . . in a more sacred place.” Heturned to her brother. “Peter, you recognize this knife, don’t you?”Her brother’s eyes were wide with a mixture of fear and disbelief.“Yes, Peter, this ancient artifact still exists. I obtained it at great expense. . . and I have been saving it for you. At long last, you and I can end ourpainful journey together.”With that, he wrapped the knife carefully in a cloth with all of his otheritems—incense, vials of liquid, white satin cloths, and other ceremonialobjects. He then placed the wrapped items inside Robert Langdon’s leather bagalong with the Masonic Pyramid and capstone. Katherine looked on helplessly asthe man zipped up Langdon’s daybag and turned to her brother.“Carry this, Peter, would you?” He set the heavy bag on Peter’s lap.Next, the man walked over to a drawer and began rooting around. She could hearsmall metal objects clinking. When he returned, he took her right arm, steadyingit. Katherine couldn’t see what he was doing, but Peter apparently could, and heagain started bucking wildly.Katherine felt a sudden, sharp pinch in the crook of her right elbow, and aneerie warmth ran down around it. Peter was making anguished, strangled soundsand trying in vain to get out of the heavy chair. Katherine felt a cold numbnessspreading through her forearm and fingertips below the elbow.When the man stepped aside, Katherine saw why her brother was so horrified. Thetattooed man had inserted a medical needle into her vein, as if she were givingblood. The needle, however, was not attached to a tube. Instead, her blood wasnow flowing freely out of it . . . running down her elbow, forearm, and onto thestone table.“A human hourglass,” the man said, turning to Peter. “In a short while, when Iask you to play your role, I want you to picture Katherine . . . dying alonehere in the dark.”Peter’s expression was one of total torment.“She will stay alive,” the man said, “for about an hour or so. If you cooperatewith me quickly, I will have enough time to save her. Of course, if you resistme at all . . . your sister will die here alone in the dark.”Peter bellowed unintelligibly through his gag.“I know, I know,” the tattooed man said, placing a hand on Peter’s shoulder,“this is hard for you. But it shouldn’t be. After all, this is not the firsttime you will abandon a family member.” He paused, bending over and whisperingin Peter’s ear. “I’m thinking, of course, of your son, Zachary, in Soganlikprison.”Peter pulled against his restraints and let out another muffled scream throughthe cloth in his mouth.“Stop it!” Katherine shouted.“I remember that night well,” the man taunted as he finished packing. “I heardthe whole thing. The warden offered to let your son go, but you chose to teachZachary a lesson . . . by abandoning him. Your boy learned his lesson, allright, didn’t he?” The man smiled. “His loss . . . was my gain.”The man now retrieved a linen cloth and stuffed it deep into Katherine’s mouth.“Death,” he whispered to her, “should be a quiet thing.”Peter struggled violently. Without another word, the tattooed man slowly backedPeter’s wheelchair out of the room, giving Peter a long, last look at hissister.Katherine and Peter locked eyes one final time.Then he was gone.Katherine could hear them going up the ramp and through the metal door. As theyexited, she heard the tattooed man lock the metal door behind him and continueon through the painting of the Three Graces. A few minutes later, she heard acar start.Then the mansion fell silent.All alone in the dark, Katherine lay bleeding."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 108Robert Langdon’s mind hovered in an endless abyss.No light.

The driveway gate was closed, and thehouse was dark and quiet.Sato gave the signal to touch down.The aircraft landed hard on the front lawn amid several other vehicles . . . oneof them a security sedan with a bubble light on top.Simkins and his team jumped out, drew their weapons, and dashed up onto theporch. Finding the front door locked, Simkins cupped his hands and peeredthrough a window. The foyer was dark, but Simkins could make out the faintshadow of a body on the floor.“Shit,” he whispered. “It’s Hartmann.”One of his agents grabbed a chair off the porch and heaved it through the baywindow. The sound of shattering glass was barely audible over the roar of thehelicopter behind them. Seconds later, they were all inside. Simkins rushed tothe foyer and knelt over Hartmann to check his pulse. Nothing. There was bloodeverywhere. Then he saw the screwdriver in Hartmann’s throat.Jesus. He stood up and motioned to his men to begin a full search.The agents fanned out across the first floor, their laser sights probing thedarkness of the luxurious house. They found nothing in the living room or study,but in the dining room, to their surprise, they discovered a strangled femalesecurity guard. Simkins was fast losing hope that Robert Langdon and KatherineSolomon were alive. This brutal killer clearly had set a trap, and if he hadmanaged to kill a CIA agent and an armed security guard, then it seemed aprofessor and a scientist had no chance.Once the first floor was secure, Simkins sent two agents to search upstairs.Meanwhile, he found a set of basement stairs off the kitchen and descended. Atthe bottom of the stairs, he threw on the lights. The basement was spacious andspotless, as if it were hardly ever used. Boilers, bare cement walls, a fewboxes. Nothing here at all. Simkins headed back up to the kitchen just as hismen were coming down from the second floor. Everyone shook their heads.The house was deserted.No one home. And no more bodies.Simkins radioed Sato with the all-clear and the grim update.When he got to the foyer, Sato was already climbing the stairs onto the porch.Warren Bellamy was visible behind her, sitting dazed and alone in the helicopterwith Sato’s titanium briefcase at his feet. The OS director’s secure laptopprovided her with worldwide access to CIA computer systems via encryptedsatellite uplinks. Earlier tonight, she had used this computer to share withBellamy some kind of information that had stunned the man into cooperatingfully. Simkins had no idea what Bellamy had seen, but whatever it was, theArchitect had been visibly shell-shocked ever since.As Sato entered the foyer, she paused a moment, bowing her head over Hartmann’sbody. A moment later, she raised her eyes and fixed them on Simkins. “No sign ofLangdon or Katherine? Or Peter Solomon?”Simkins shook his head. “If they’re still alive, he took them with him.”“Did you see a computer in the house?”“Yes, ma’am. In the office.”“Show me.”Simkins led Sato out of the foyer and into the living room. The plush carpet wascovered with broken glass from the shattered bay window. They walked past afireplace, a large painting, and several bookshelves to an office door. Theoffice was wood paneled, with an antique desk and a large computer monitor. Satowalked around behind the desk and eyed the screen, immediately scowling.“Damn it,” she said under her breath.Simkins circled around and looked at the screen. It was blank. “What’s wrong?”Sato pointed to an empty docking station on the desk. “He uses a laptop. He tookit with him.”Simkins didn’t follow. “Does he have information you want to see?”“No,” Sato replied, her tone grave. “He has information I want nobody to see.”Downstairs in the hidden basement, Katherine Solomon had heard the sounds ofhelicopter blades followed by breaking glass and heavy boots on the floor aboveher. She tried to cry out for help, but the gag in her mouth made it impossible.She could barely make a sound. The harder she tried, the faster the blood beganflowing from her elbow.She was feeling short of breath and a little dizzy.Katherine knew she needed to calm down. Use your mind, Katherine. With all ofher intention, she coaxed herself into a meditative state.Robert Langdon’s mind floated through the emptiness of space. He peered into theinfinite void, searching for any points of reference. He found nothing.Total darkness. Total silence. Total peace.There was not even the pull of gravity to tell him which way was up.His body was gone.This must be death.Time seemed to be telescoping, stretching and compressing, as if it had nobearings in this place. He had lost all track of how much time had passed.Ten seconds? Ten minutes? Ten days?Suddenly, however, like distant fiery explosions in far-off galaxies, memoriesbegan to materialize, billowing toward Langdon like shock waves across a vastnothingness.All at once, Robert Langdon began to remember. The images tore through him . . .vivid and disturbing. He was staring up at a face that was covered with tattoos.A pair of powerful hands lifted his head and smashed it into the floor.Pain erupted . . . and then darkness.Gray light.Throbbing.Wisps of memory.

With luck, one of them might have been properlypositioned to get photos of this home tonight . . . possibly capturing a vehicleleaving the place in the last half hour.“Sorry, ma’am,” the satellite technician said. “No coverage of those coordinatestonight. Do you want to make a reposition request?”“No thanks. Too late.” She hung up.Sato exhaled, now having no idea how they would figure out where their targethad gone. She walked out to the foyer, where her men had bagged Agent Hartmann’sbody and were carrying it toward the chopper. Sato had ordered Agent Simkins togather his men and prepare for the return to Langley, but Simkins was in theliving room on his hands and knees. He looked like he was ill.“You okay?”He glanced up, an odd look on his face. “Did you see this?” He pointed at theliving-room floor.Sato came over and looked down at the plush carpet. She shook her head, seeingnothing.“Crouch down,” Simkins said. “Look at the nap of the carpet.”She did. After a moment, she saw it. The fibers of the carpet looked like theyhad been mashed down . . . depressed along two straight lines as if the wheelsof something heavy had been rolled across the room.“The strange thing,” Simkins said, “is where the tracks go.” He pointed.Sato’s gaze followed the faint parallel lines across the living-room carpet. Thetracks seemed to disappear beneath a large floor-to-ceiling painting that hungbeside the fireplace. What in the world?Simkins walked over to the painting and tried to lift it down from the wall. Itdidn’t budge. “It’s fixed,” he said, now running his fingers around the edges.“Hold on, there’s something underneath . . .” His finger hit a small leverbeneath the bottom edge, and something clicked.Sato stepped forward as Simkins pushed the frame and the entire painting rotatedslowly on its center, like a revolving door.He raised his flashlight and shined it into the dark space beyond.Sato’s eyes narrowed. Here we go.At the end of a short corridor stood a heavy metal door.The memories that had billowed through the blackness of Langdon’s mind had comeand gone. In their wake, a trail of red-hot sparks was swirling, along with thesame eerie, distant whisper.Verbum significatium . . . Verbum omnificum . . . Verbum perdo.The chanting continued like the drone of voices in a medieval canticle.Verbum significatium . . . Verbum omnificum. The words now tumbled through theempty void, fresh voices echoing all around him.Apocalypsis . . . Franklin . . . Apocalypsis . . . Verbum . . . Apocalypsis . ..Without warning, a mournful bell began tolling somewhere in the distance. Thebell rang on and on, growing louder. It tolled more urgently now, as if hopingLangdon would understand, as if urging his mind to follow."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 111The tolling bell in the clock tower rang for three full minutes, rattling thecrystal chandelier that hung above Langdon’s head. Decades ago, he had attendedlectures in this well-loved assembly hall at Phillips Exeter Academy. Today,however, he was here to listen to a dear friend address the student body. As thelights dimmed, Langdon took a seat against the back wall, beneath a pantheon ofheadmaster portraits.A hush fell across the crowd.In total darkness, a tall, shadowy figure crossed the stage and took the podium.“Good morning,” the faceless voice whispered into the microphone.Everyone sat up, straining to see who was addressing them.A slide projector flashed to life, revealing a faded sepia photograph—a dramaticcastle with a red sandstone facade, high square towers, and Gothicembellishments.The shadow spoke again. “Who can tell me where this is?”“England!” a girl declared in the darkness. “This facade is a blend of earlyGothic and late Romanesque, making this the quintessential Norman castle andplacing it in England at about the twelfth century.”“Wow,” the faceless voice replied. “Someone knows her architecture.”Quiet groans all around.“Unfortunately,” the shadow added, “you missed by three thousand miles and halfa millennium.”The room perked up.The projector now flashed a full-color, modern photo of the same castle from adifferent angle. The castle’s Seneca Creek sandstone towers dominated theforeground, but in the background, startlingly close, stood the majestic, white,columned dome of the U.S. Capitol Building.“Hold on!” the girl exclaimed. “There’s a Norman castle in D.C.?!”“Since 1855,” the voice replied. “Which is when this next photo was taken.”A new slide appeared—a black-and-white interior shot, depicting a massivevaulted ballroom, furnished with animal skeletons, scientific display cases,glass jars with biological samples, archaeological artifacts, and plaster castsof prehistoric reptiles.“This wondrous castle,” the voice said, “was America’s first real sciencemuseum. It was a gift to America from a wealthy British scientist who, like ourforefathers, believed our fledgling country could become the land ofenlightenment. He bequeathed to our forefathers a massive fortune and asked themto build at the core of our nation ‘an establishment for the increase anddiffusion of knowledge.’ ” He paused a long moment. “Who can tell me the name ofthis generous scientist?”A timid voice in front ventured, “James Smithson?”A whisper of recognition rippled through the crowd.“Smithson indeed,” the man on stage replied. Peter Solomon now stepped into thelight, his gray eyes flashing playfully. “Good morning. My name is PeterSolomon, and I am secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.”The students broke into wild applause.In the shadows, Langdon watched with admiration as Peter captivated the youngminds with a photographic tour of the Smithsonian Institution’s early history.The show began with Smithsonian Castle, its basement science labs, corridorslined with exhibits, a salon full of mollusks, scientists who called themselves“the curators of crustaceans,” and even an old photo of the castle’s two mostpopular residents—a pair of now-deceased owls named Diffusion and Increase. Thehalf-hour slide show ended with an impressive satellite photo of the NationalMall, now lined with enormous Smithsonian museums.“As I said when I began,” Solomon stated in conclusion, “James Smithson and ourforefathers envisioned our great country to be a land of enlightenment. Ibelieve today they would be proud. Their great Smithsonian Institution stands asa symbol of science and knowledge at the very core of America. It is a living,breathing, working tribute to our forefathers’ dream for America—a countryfounded on the principles of knowledge, wisdom, and science.”Solomon clicked off the slides to an energetic round of applause. Thehouselights came up, along with dozens of eager hands with questions.Solomon called on a small red-haired boy in the middle.“Mr. Solomon?” the boy said, sounding puzzled. “You said our forefathers fledthe religious oppression of Europe to establish a country on the principles ofscientific advancement.”“That’s correct.”“But . . . I was under the impression our forefathers were devoutly religiousmen who founded America as a Christian nation.”Solomon smiled. “My friends, don’t get me wrong, our forefathers were deeplyreligious men, but they were Deists—men who believed in God, but in a universaland open-minded way. The only religious ideal they put forth was religiousfreedom.” He pulled the microphone from the podium and strode out to the edge ofthe stage. “America’s forefathers had a vision of a spiritually enlightenedutopia, in which freedom of thought, education of the masses, and scientificadvancement would replace the darkness of outdated religious superstition.”A blond girl in back raised her hand.“Yes?”“Sir,” the girl said, holding up her cell phone, “I’ve been researching youonline, and Wikipedia says you’re a prominent Freemason.”Solomon held up his Masonic ring. “I could have saved you the data charges.”The students laughed.“Yes, well,” the girl continued, hesitating, “you just mentioned ‘outdatedreligious superstition,’ and it seems to me that if anyone is responsible forpropagating outdated superstitions . . . it would be the Masons.”Solomon seemed unfazed. “Oh? How so?”“Well, I’ve read a lot about Masonry, and I know you’ve got a lot of strangeancient rituals and beliefs. This article online even says that Masons believein the power of some kind of ancient magical wisdom . . . which can elevate manto the realm of the gods?”Everyone turned and stared at the girl as if she were nuts.“Actually,” Solomon said, “she’s right.”The kids all spun around and faced front, eyes widening.Solomon suppressed a smile and asked the girl, “Does it offer any otherWiki-wisdom about this magical knowledge?”The girl looked uneasy now, but she began to read from the Web site. “‘To ensurethis powerful wisdom could not be used by the unworthy, the early adepts wrotedown their knowledge in code . . . cloaking its potent truth in a metaphoricallanguage of symbols, myth, and allegory. To this day, this encrypted wisdom isall around us . . . encoded in our mythology, our art, and the occult texts ofthe ages. Unfortunately, modern man has lost the ability to decipher thiscomplex network of symbolism . . . and the great truth has been lost.’”Solomon waited. “That’s all?”The girl shifted in her seat. “Actually, there is a little bit more.”“I should hope so. Please . . . tell us.”The girl looked hesitant, but she cleared her throat and continued. “‘Accordingto legend, the sages who encrypted the Ancient Mysteries long ago left behind akey of sorts . . . a password that could be used to unlock the encryptedsecrets. This magical password—known as the verbum significatium—is said to holdthe power to lift the darkness and unlock the Ancient Mysteries, opening them toall human understanding.’ ”Solomon smiled wistfully. “Ah, yes . . . the verbum significatium.” He staredinto space for a moment and then lowered his eyes again to the blond girl. “Andwhere is this wonderful word now?”The girl looked apprehensive, clearly wishing she had not challenged their guestspeaker. She finished reading. “ ‘Legend holds that the verbum significatium isburied deep underground, where it waits patiently for a pivotal moment inhistory . . . a moment when mankind can no longer survive without the truth,knowledge, and wisdom of the ages. At this dark crossroads, mankind will at lastunearth the Word and herald in a wondrous new age of enlightenment.’ ”The girl turned off her phone and shrank down in her seat.After a long silence, another student raised his hand. “Mr. Solomon, you don’tactually believe that, right?”Solomon smiled. “Why not? Our mythologies have a long tradition of magic wordsthat provide insight and godlike powers. To this day, children still shout‘abracadabra’ in hopes of creating something out of nothing. Of course, we’veall forgotten that this word is not a toy; it has roots in ancient Aramaicmysticism—Avrah KaDabra—meaning ‘I create as I speak.’ ”Silence.“But, sir,” the student now pressed, “surely you don’t believe that a singleword . . . this verbum significatium . . . whatever it is . . . has the power tounlock ancient wisdom . . . and bring about a worldwide enlightenment?”Peter Solomon’s face revealed nothing. “My own beliefs should not concern you.What should concern you is that this prophecy of a coming enlightenment isechoed in virtually every faith and philosophical tradition on earth. Hinduscall it the Krita Age, astrologers call it the Age of Aquarius, the Jewsdescribe the coming of the Messiah, theosophists call it the New Age,cosmologists call it Harmonic Convergence and predict the actual date.”“December 21, 2012!” someone called.“Yes, unnervingly soon . . . if you’re a believer in Mayan math.”Langdon chuckled, recalling how Solomon, ten years ago, had correctly predictedthe current spate of television specials predicting that the year 2012 wouldmark the End of the World.“Timing aside,” Solomon said, “I find it wondrous to note that throughouthistory, all of mankind’s disparate philosophies have all concurred on onething—that a great enlightenment is coming. In every culture, in every era, inevery corner of the world, the human dream has focused on the same exactconcept—the coming apotheosis of man . . . the impending transformation of ourhuman minds into their true potentiality.” He smiled. “What could possiblyexplain such a synchronicity of beliefs?”“Truth,” said a quiet voice in the crowd.Solomon wheeled. “Who said that?”The hand that went up belonged to a tiny Asian boy whose soft features suggestedhe might be Nepalese or Tibetan. “Maybe there is a universal truth embedded ineveryone’s soul. Maybe we all have the same story hiding inside, like a sharedconstant in our DNA. Maybe this collective truth is responsible for thesimilarity in all of our stories.”Solomon was beaming as he pressed his hands together and bowed reverently to theboy. “Thank you.”Everyone was quiet.“Truth,” Solomon said, addressing the room. “Truth has power. And if we allgravitate toward similar ideas, maybe we do so because those ideas are true . .. written deep within us. And when we hear the truth, even if we don’tunderstand it, we feel that truth resonate within us . . . vibrating with ourunconscious wisdom. Perhaps the truth is not learned by us, but rather, thetruth is re-called . . . re-membered . . . re-cognized . . . as that which isalready inside us.”The silence in the hall was complete.Solomon let it sit for a long moment, then quietly said, “In closing, I shouldwarn you that unveiling the truth is never easy. Throughout history, everyperiod of enlightenment has been accompanied by darkness, pushing in opposition.Such are the laws of nature and balance. And if we look at the darkness growingin the world today, we have to realize that this means there is equal lightgrowing. We are on the verge of a truly great period of illumination, and all ofus—all of you—are profoundly blessed to be living through this pivotal moment ofhistory. Of all the people who have ever lived, in all the eras in history . . .we are in that narrow window of time during which we will bear witness to ourultimate renaissance. After millennia of darkness, we will see our sciences, ourminds, and even our religions unveil the truth.”Solomon was about to get a hearty round of applause when he held up his hand forsilence. “Miss?” He pointed directly to the contentious blond girl in back withthe cell phone. “I know you and I didn’t agree on much, but I want to thank you.Your passion is an important catalyst in the coming changes. Darkness feeds onapathy . . . and conviction is our most potent antidote. Keep studying yourfaith. Study the Bible.” He smiled. “Especially the final pages.”“The Apocalypse?” she said.“Absolutely. The Book of Revelation is a vibrant example of our shared truth.The last book of the Bible tells the identical story as countless othertraditions. They all predict the coming unveiling of great wisdom.”Someone else said, “But isn’t the Apocalypse about the end of the world? Youknow, the Antichrist, Armageddon, the final battle between good and evil?”Solomon chuckled. “Who here studies Greek?”Several hands went up.“What does the word apocalypse literally mean?”“It means,” one student began, and then paused as if surprised. “Apocalypsemeans ‘to unveil’ . . . or ‘to reveal.’ ”Solomon gave the boy a nod of approval. “Exactly. The Apocalypse is literally areveal-ation. The Book of Reveal-ation in the Bible predicts an unveiling ofgreat truth and unimaginable wisdom. The Apocalypse is not the end of the world,but rather it is the end of the world as we know it. The prophecy of theApocalypse is just one of the Bible’s beautiful messages that has beendistorted.” Solomon stepped to the front of the stage. “Believe me, theApocalypse is coming . . . and it will be nothing like what we were taught.”High over his head, the bell began to toll.The students erupted into bewildered and thunderous applause."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 112Katherine Solomon was teetering on the edge of consciousness when she was joltedby the shock wave of a deafening explosion.Moments later, she smelled smoke.Her ears were ringing.There were muffled voices. Distant. Shouting. Footsteps. Suddenly she wasbreathing more clearly. The cloth had been pulled from her mouth.“You’re safe,” a man’s voice whispered. “Just hold on.”She expected the man to pull the needle out of her arm but instead he wasyelling orders. “Bring the medical kit . . . attach an IV to the needle . . .infuse lactated Ringer’s solution . . . get me a blood pressure.” As the manbegan checking her vital signs, he said, “Ms. Solomon, the person who did thisto you . . . where did he go?”Katherine tried to speak, but she could not.“Ms. Solomon?” the voice repeated. “Where did he go?”Katherine tried to pry her eyes open, but she felt herself fading.“We need to know where he went,” the man urged.Katherine whispered three words in response, although she knew they made nosense. “The . . . sacred . . . mountain.”Director Sato stepped over the mangled steel door and descended a wooden rampinto the hidden basement. One of her agents met her at the bottom.“Director, I think you’ll want to see this.”Sato followed the agent into a small room off the narrow hallway. The room wasbrightly lit and barren, except for a pile of clothing on the floor. Sherecognized Robert Langdon’s tweed coat and loafers.Her agent pointed toward the far wall at a large, casketlike container.What in the world?Sato moved toward the container, seeing now that it was fed by a clear plasticpipe that ran through the wall. Warily, she approached the tank.Now she could see that it had a small slider on top. She reached down and slidthe covering to one side, revealing a small portal-like window.Sato recoiled.Beneath the Plexiglas . . . floated the submerged, vacant face of ProfessorRobert Langdon.Light!The endless void in which Langdon hovered was suddenly filled by a blinding sun.Rays of white-hot light streamed across the blackness of space, burning into hismind.The light was everywhere.Suddenly, within the radiant cloud before him, a beautiful silhouette appeared.It was a face . . . blurry and indistinct . . . two eyes staring at him acrossthe void. Streams of light surrounded the face, and Langdon wondered if he waslooking into the face of God.Sato stared down into the tank, wondering if Professor Langdon had any idea whathad happened. She doubted it. After all, disorientation was the entire purposeof this technology.Sensory-deprivation tanks had been around since the fifties and were still apopular getaway for wealthy New Age experimenters. “Floating,” as it was called,offered a transcendental back-to-the-womb experience . . . a kind of meditativeaid that quieted brain activity by removing all sensory input—light, sound,touch, and even the pull of gravity. In traditional tanks, the person wouldfloat on his back in a hyperbuoyant saline solution that kept his face above thewater so he could breathe.In recent years, however, these tanks had taken a quantum leap.Oxygenated perfluorocarbons.This new technology—known as Total Liquid Ventilation (TLV)—was socounterintuitive that few believed it existed.Breathable liquid.Liquid breathing had been a reality since 1966, when Leland C. Clarksuccessfully kept alive a mouse that had been submerged for several hours in anoxygenated perfluorocarbon. In 1989, TLV technology made a dramatic appearancein the movie The Abyss, although few viewers realized that they were watchingreal science.Total Liquid Ventilation had been born of modern medicine’s attempts to helppremature babies breathe by returning them to the liquid-filled state of thewomb. Human lungs, having spent nine months in utero, were no strangers to aliquid-filled state. Perfluorocarbons had once been too viscous to be fullybreathable, but modern breakthroughs had made breathable liquids almost theconsistency of water.The CIA’s Directorate of Science and Technology—“the Wizards of Langley,” asthey were known within the intelligence community—had worked extensively withoxygenated perfluorocarbons to develop technologies for the U.S. military. Thenavy’s elite deep-ocean diving teams found that breathing oxygenated liquid,rather than the usual heliox or trimix, gave them the ability to dive to muchgreater depths without risk of pressure sickness. Similarly, NASA and the airforce had learned that pilots equipped with a liquid breathing apparatus ratherthan a traditional oxygen tank could withstand far higher g-forces than usualbecause liquid spread the g-force more evenly throughout the internal organsthan gas did.Sato had heard that there were now “extreme experience labs” where one could trythese Total Liquid Ventilation tanks—“Meditation Machines,” as they were called.This particular tank had probably been installed for its owner’s privateexperimentation, although the addition of heavy, lockable latches left littledoubt in Sato’s mind that this tank had also been used for darker applications .. . an interrogation technique with which the CIA was familiar.The infamous interrogation technique of water boarding was highly effectivebecause the victim truly believed he was drowning. Sato knew of severalclassified operations in which sensory-deprivation tanks like these had beenused to enhance that illusion to terrifying new levels. A victim submerged inbreathable liquid could literally be “drowned.” The panic associated with thedrowning experience usually made the victim unaware that the liquid he wasbreathing was slightly more viscous than water. When the liquid poured into hislungs, he would often black out from fear, and then awaken in the ultimate“solitary confinement.”Topical numbing agents, paralysis drugs, and hallucinogens were mixed with thewarm oxygenated liquid to give the prisoner the sense he was entirely separatedfrom his body. When his mind sent commands to move his limbs, nothing happened.The state of being “dead” was terrifying on its own, but the true disorientationcame from the “rebirthing” process, which, with the aid of bright lights, coldair, and deafening noise, could be extremely traumatic and painful. After ahandful of rebirths and subsequent drownings, the prisoner became sodisorientated that he had no idea if he was alive or dead . . . and he wouldtell the interrogator absolutely anything.Sato wondered if she should wait for a medical team to extract Langdon, but sheknew she didn’t have time. I need to know what he knows.“Turn out the lights,” she said. “And find me some blankets.”The blinding sun had vanished.The face had also disappeared.The blackness had returned, but Langdon could now hear distant whispers echoingacross the light-years of emptiness. Muffled voices . . . unintelligible words.There were vibrations now . . . as if the world were about to shake apart.Then it happened.Without warning, the universe was ripped in two. An enormous chasm opened in thevoid . . . as if space itself had ruptured at the seams. A grayish mist pouredthrough the opening, and Langdon saw a terrifying sight. Disembodied hands weresuddenly reaching for him, grabbing his body, trying to yank him out of hisworld.No! He tried to fight them off, but he had no arms . . . no fists. Or did he?Suddenly he felt his body materializing around his mind. His flesh had returnedand it was being seized by powerful hands that were dragging him upward. No!Please!But it was too late.Pain racked his chest as the hands heaved him through the opening. His lungsfelt like they were filled with sand. I can’t breathe! He was suddenly on hisback on the coldest, hardest surface he could imagine. Something was pressing onhis chest, over and over, hard and painful. He was spewing out the warmth.I want to go back.He felt like he was a child being born from a womb.He was convulsing, coughing up liquid. He felt pain in his chest and neck.Excruciating pain. His throat was on fire. People were talking, trying towhisper, but it was deafening. His vision was blurred, and all he could see wasmuted shapes. His skin felt numb, like dead leather.His chest felt heavier now . . . pressure. I can’t breathe!He was coughing up more liquid. An overwhelming gag reflex seized him, and hegasped inward. Cold air poured into his lungs, and he felt like a newborn takinghis first breath on earth. This world was excruciating. All Langdon wanted wasto return to the womb.Robert Langdon had no idea how much time had passed. He could feel now that hewas lying on his side, wrapped in towels and blankets on a hard floor. Afamiliar face was gazing down at him . . . but the streams of glorious lightwere gone. The echoes of distant chanting still hung in his mind.Verbum significatium . . . Verbum omnificum . . .“Professor Langdon,” someone whispered. “Do you know where you are?”Langdon nodded weakly, still coughing.More important, he had begun to realize what was going on tonight."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 113Wrapped in wool blankets, Langdon stood on wobbly legs and stared down at theopen tank of liquid. His body had returned to him, although he wished it hadnot. His throat and lungs burned. This world felt hard and cruel.Sato had just explained the sensory-deprivation tank . . . adding that if shehad not pulled him out, he would have died of starvation, or worse. Langdon hadlittle doubt that Peter had endured a similar experience. Peter is in thein-between, the tattooed man had told him earlier tonight. He is in purgatory .. . Hamistagan. If Peter had endured more than one of those birthing processes,Langdon would not have been surprised if Peter had told his captor anything hehad wanted to know.Sato motioned for Langdon to follow her, and he did, trudging slowly down anarrow hall, deeper into this bizarre lair that he was now seeing for the firsttime. They entered a square room with a stone table and eerie-colored lighting.Katherine was here, and Langdon heaved a sigh of relief. Even so, the scene wasworrisome.Katherine was lying on her back on a stone table. Blood-soaked towels lay on thefloor. A CIA agent was holding an IV bag above her, the tube connected to herarm.She was sobbing quietly.“Katherine?” Langdon croaked, barely able to speak.She turned her head, looking disorientated and confused. “Robert?!” Her eyeswidened with disbelief and then joy. “But I . . . saw you drown!”He moved toward the stone table.Katherine pulled herself to a seated position, ignoring her IV tube and themedical objections of the agent. Langdon reached the table, and Katherinereached out, wrapping her arms around his blanket-clad body, holding him close.“Thank God,” she whispered, kissing his cheek. Then she kissed him again,squeezing him as though she didn’t believe he was real. “I don’t understand . .. how . . .”Sato began saying something about sensory-deprivation tanks and oxygenatedperfluorocarbons, but Katherine clearly wasn’t listening. She just held Langdonclose.“Robert,” she said, “Peter’s alive.” Her voice wavered as she recounted herhorrifying reunion with Peter. She described his physical condition—thewheelchair, the strange knife, the allusions to some kind of “sacrifice,” andhow she had been left bleeding as a human hourglass to persuade Peter tocooperate quickly.Langdon could barely speak. “Do you . . . have any idea where . . . they went?!”“He said he was taking Peter to the sacred mountain.”Langdon pulled away and stared at her.Katherine had tears in her eyes. “He said he had deciphered the grid on thebottom of the pyramid, and that the pyramid told him to go to the sacredmountain.”“Professor,” Sato pressed, “does that mean anything to you?”Langdon shook his head. “Not at all.” Still, he felt a surge of hope. “But if hegot the information off the bottom of the pyramid, we can get it, too.” I toldhim how to solve it.Sato shook her head. “The pyramid’s gone. We’ve looked. He took it with him.”Langdon remained silent a moment, closing his eyes and trying to recall what hehad seen on the base of the pyramid. The grid of symbols had been one of thelast images he had seen before drowning, and trauma had a way of burningmemories deeper into the mind. He could recall some of the grid, definitely notall of it, but maybe enough?He turned to Sato and said hurriedly, “I may be able to remember enough, but Ineed you to look up something on the Internet.”She pulled out her BlackBerry.“Run a search for ‘The Order Eight Franklin Square.’ ”Sato gave him a startled look but began typing without questions.Langdon’s vision was still blurry, and he was only now starting to process hisstrange surroundings. He realized that the stone table on which they wereleaning was covered with old bloodstains, and the wall to his right was entirelyplastered with pages of text, photos, drawings, maps, and a giant web of stringsinterconnecting them.My God.Langdon moved toward the strange collage, still clutching the blankets aroundhis body. Tacked on the wall was an utterly bizarre collection ofinformation—pages from ancient texts ranging from black magic to ChristianScripture, drawings of symbols and sigils, pages of conspiracy-theory Web sites,and satellite photos of Washington, D.C., scrawled with notes and questionmarks. One of the sheets was a long list of words in many languages. Herecognized some of them as sacred Masonic words, others as ancient magic words,and others from ceremonial incantations.Is that what he’s looking for?A word?Is it that simple?Langdon’s long-standing skepticism about the Masonic Pyramid was based largelyon what it allegedly revealed—the location of the Ancient Mysteries. Thisdiscovery would have to involve an enormous vault filled with thousands uponthousands of volumes that had somehow survived the long-lost ancient librariesin which they had once been stored. It all seemed impossible. A vault that big?Beneath D.C.? Now, however, his recollection of Peter’s lecture at PhillipsExeter, combined with these lists of magic words, had opened another startlingpossibility.Langdon most definitely did not believe in the power of magic words . . . andyet it seemed pretty clear that the tattooed man did. His pulse quickened as heagain scanned the scrawled notes, the maps, the texts, the printouts, and allthe interconnected strings and sticky notes.Sure enough, there was one recurring theme.My God, he’s looking for the verbum significatium . . . the Lost Word. Langdonlet the thought take shape, recalling fragments of Peter’s lecture. The LostWord is what he’s looking for! That’s what he believes is buried here inWashington.Sato arrived beside him. “Is this what you asked for?” She handed him herBlackBerry.Langdon looked at the eight-by-eight grid of numbers on the screen. “Exactly.”He grabbed a piece of scrap paper. “I’ll need a pen.”Sato handed him one from her pocket. “Please hurry.”Inside the basement office of the Directorate of Science and Technology, NolaKaye was once again studying the redacted document brought to her by sys-secRick Parrish. What the hell is the CIA director doing with a file about ancientpyramids and secret underground locations?She grabbed the phone and dialed.Sato answered instantly, sounding tense. “Nola, I was just about to call you.”“I have new information,” Nola said. “I’m not sure how this fits, but I’vediscovered there’s a redacted—”“Forget it, whatever it is,” Sato interrupted. “We’re out of time. We failed toapprehend the target, and I have every reason to believe he’s about to carry outhis threat.”Nola felt a chill.“The good news is we know exactly where he’s going.” Sato took a deep breath.“The bad news is that he’s carrying a laptop with him.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 114Less than ten miles away, Mal’akh tucked the blanket around Peter Solomon andwheeled him across a moonlit parking lot into the shadow of an enormousbuilding. The structure had exactly thirty-three outer columns . . . eachprecisely thirty-three feet tall. The mountainous structure was deserted at thishour, and nobody would ever see them back here. Not that it mattered. From adistance, no one would think twice about a tall, kindly-looking man in a longblack coat taking a bald invalid for an evening stroll.When they reached the rear entrance, Mal’akh wheeled Peter up close to thesecurity keypad. Peter stared at it defiantly, clearly having no intention ofentering the code.Mal’akh laughed. “You think you’re here to let me in? Have you forgotten so soonthat I am one of your brethren?” He reached out and typed the access code thathe had been given after his initiation to the thirty-third degree.The heavy door clicked open.Peter groaned and began struggling in the wheelchair.“Peter, Peter,” Mal’akh cooed. “Picture Katherine. Be cooperative, and she willlive. You can save her. I give you my word.”Mal’akh wheeled his captive inside and relocked the door behind them, his heartracing now with anticipation. He pushed Peter through some hallways to anelevator and pressed the call button. The doors opened, and Mal’akh backed in,pulling the wheelchair along with him. Then, making sure Peter could see what hewas doing, he reached out and pressed the uppermost button.A look of deepening dread crossed Peter’s tortured face.“Shh . . .” Mal’akh whispered, gently stroking Peter’s shaved head as theelevator doors closed. “As you well know . . . the secret is how to die.”I can’t remember all the symbols!Langdon closed his eyes, doing his best to recall the precise locations of thesymbols on the bottom of the stone pyramid, but even his eidetic memory did nothave that degree of recall. He wrote down the few symbols he could remember,placing each one in the location indicated by Franklin’s magic square.So far, however, he saw nothing that made any sense.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_025_r1.jpg]“Look!” Katherine urged. “You must be on the right track. The first row is allGreek letters—the same kinds of symbols are being arranged together!”Langdon had noticed this, too, but he could not think of any Greek word that fitthat configuration of letters and spaces. I need the first letter. He glancedagain at the magic square, trying to recall the letter that had been in thenumber one spot near the lower left corner. Think! He closed his eyes, trying topicture the base of the pyramid. The bottom row . . . next to the left-handcorner . . . what letter was there?For an instant, Langdon was back in the tank, racked with terror, staring upthrough the Plexiglas at the bottom of the pyramid.Now, suddenly, he saw it. He opened his eyes, breathing heavily. “The firstletter is H!”Langdon turned back to the grid and wrote in the first letter. The word wasstill incomplete, but he had seen enough. Suddenly he realized what the wordmight be.Ηερεδοµ!Pulse pounding, Langdon typed a new search into the BlackBerry. He entered theEnglish equivalent of this well-known Greek word. The first hit that appearedwas an encyclopedia entry. He read it and knew it had to be right.HEREDOM n. a significant word in “high degree” Freemasonry, from French RoseCroix rituals, where it refers to a mythical mountain in Scotland, the legendarysite of the first such Chapter. From the Greek Ηερεδοµ originating fromHieros-domos, Greek for Holy House.“That’s it!” Langdon exclaimed, incredulous. “That’s where they went!”Sato had been reading over his shoulder and looked lost. “To a mythical mountainin Scotland?!”Langdon shook his head. “No, to a building in Washington whose code name isHeredom.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 115The House of the Temple—known among its brethren as Heredom—had always been thecrown jewel of the Masonic Scottish Rite in America. With its steeply sloped,pyramidical roof, the building was named for an imaginary Scottish mountain.Mal’akh knew, however, there was nothing imaginary about the treasure hiddenhere.This is the place, he knew. The Masonic Pyramid has shown the way.As the old elevator slowly made its way to the third floor, Mal’akh took out thepiece of paper on which he had reorganized the grid of symbols using theFranklin Square. All the Greek letters had now shifted to the first row . . .along with one simple symbol.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_026_r1.jpg]The message could not have been more clear.Beneath the House of the Temple.Heredom↓The Lost Word is here . . . somewhere.Although Mal’akh did not know precisely how to locate it, he was confident thatthe answer lay in the remaining symbols on the grid. Conveniently, when it cameto unlocking the secrets of the Masonic Pyramid and of this building, no one wasmore qualified to help than Peter Solomon. The Worshipful Master himself.Peter continued to struggle in the wheelchair, making muffled sounds through hisgag.“I know you’re worried about Katherine,” Mal’akh said. “But it’s almost over.”For Mal’akh, the end felt like it had arrived very suddenly. After all the yearsof pain and planning, waiting and searching . . . the moment had now arrived.The elevator began to slow, and he felt a rush of excitement.The carriage jolted to a stop.The bronze doors slid open, and Mal’akh gazed out at the glorious chamber beforethem. The massive square room was adorned with symbols and bathed in moonlight,which shone down through the oculus at the pinnacle of the ceiling high above.I have come full circle, Mal’akh thought.The Temple Room was the same place in which Peter Solomon and his brethren hadso foolishly initiated Mal’akh as one of their own. Now the Masons’ most sublimesecret—something that most of the brethren did not even believe existed—wasabout to be unearthed.“He won’t find anything,” Langdon said, still feeling groggy and disorientatedas he followed Sato and the others up the wooden ramp out of the basement.“There is no actual Word. It’s all a metaphor—a symbol of the AncientMysteries.”Katherine followed, with two agents assisting her weakened body up the ramp.As the group moved gingerly through the wreckage of the steel door, through therotating painting, and into the living room, Langdon explained to Sato that theLost Word was one of Freemasonry’s most enduring symbols—a single word, writtenin an arcane language that man could no longer decipher. The Word, like theMysteries themselves, promised to unveil its hidden power only to thoseenlightened enough to decrypt it. “It is said,” Langdon concluded, “that if youcan possess and understand the Lost Word . . . then the Ancient Mysteries willbecome clear to you.”Sato glanced over. “So you believe this man is looking for a word?”Langdon had to admit it sounded absurd at face value, and yet it answered a lotof questions. “Look, I’m no specialist in ceremonial magic,” he said, “but fromthe documents on his basement walls . . . and from Katherine’s description ofthe untattooed flesh on his head . . . I’d say he’s hoping to find the Lost Wordand inscribe it on his body.”Sato moved the group toward the dining room. Outside, the helicopter was warmingup, its blades thundering louder and louder.Langdon kept talking, thinking aloud. “If this guy truly believes he is about tounlock the power of the Ancient Mysteries, no symbol would be more potent in hismind than the Lost Word. If he could find it and inscribe it on the top of hishead—a sacred location in itself—then he would no doubt consider himselfperfectly adorned and ritualistically prepared to . . .” He paused, seeingKatherine blanch at the thought of Peter’s impending fate.“But, Robert,” she said weakly, her voice barely audible over the helicopterblades. “This is good news, right? If he wants to inscribe the Lost Word on thetop of his head before he sacrifices Peter, then we have time. He won’t killPeter until he finds the Word. And, if there is no Word . . .”Langdon tried to look hopeful as the agents helped Katherine into a chair.“Unfortunately, Peter still thinks you’re bleeding to death. He thinks the onlyway to save you is to cooperate with this lunatic . . .probably to help him findthe Lost Word.”“So what?” she insisted. “If the Word doesn’t exist—”“Katherine,” Langdon said, staring deeply into her eyes. “If I believed you weredying, and if someone promised me I could save you by finding the Lost Word,then I would find this man a word—any word—and then I’d pray to God he kept hispromise.”“Director Sato!” an agent shouted from the next room. “You’d better see this!”Sato hurried out of the dining room and saw one of her agents coming down thestairs from the bedroom. He was carrying a blond wig. What the hell?“Man’s hairpiece,” he said, handing it to her. “Found it in the dressing room.Have a close look.”The blond wig was much heavier than Sato expected. The skullcap seemed to bemolded of a thick gel. Strangely, the underside of the wig had a wire protrudingfrom it.“Gel-pack battery that molds to your scalp,” the agent said. “Powers afiber-optic pinpoint camera hidden in the hair.”“What?” Sato felt around with her fingers until she found the tiny camera lensnestled invisibly within the blond bangs. “This thing’s a hidden camera?”“Video camera,” the agent said. “Stores footage on this tiny solid-state card.”He pointed to a stamp-size square of silicon embedded in the skullcap. “Probablymotion activated.”Jesus, she thought. So that’s how he did it.This sleek version of the “flower in the lapel” secret camera had played a keyrole in the crisis the OS director was facing tonight. She glared at it a momentlonger and then handed it back to the agent.“Keep searching the house,” she said. “I want every bit of information you canfind on this guy. We know his laptop is missing, and I want to know exactly howhe plans to connect it to the outside world while he’s on the move. Search hisstudy for manuals, cables, anything at all that might give us a clue about hishardware.”“Yes, ma’am.” The agent hurried off.Time to move out. Sato could hear the whine of the helicopter blades at fullpitch. She hurried back to the dining room, where Simkins had now ushered WarrenBellamy in from the helicopter and was gathering intel from him about thebuilding to which they believed their target had gone.House of the Temple.“The front doors are sealed from within,” Bellamy was saying, still wrapped in afoil blanket and shivering visibly from his time outside in Franklin Square.“The building’s rear entrance is your only way in. It’s got a keypad with anaccess PIN known only to the brothers.”“What’s the PIN?” Simkins demanded, taking notes.Bellamy sat down, looking too feeble to stand. Through chattering teeth, herecited his access code and then added, “The address is 1733 Sixteenth, butyou’ll want the access drive and parking area, behind the building. Kind oftricky to find, but—”“I know exactly where it is,” Langdon said. “I’ll show you when we get there.”Simkins shook his head. “You’re not coming, Professor. This is a military—”“The hell I’m not!” Langdon fired back. “Peter’s in there! And that building’s alabyrinth! Without someone to lead you in, you’ll take ten minutes to find yourway up to the Temple Room!”“He’s right,” Bellamy said. “It’s a maze. There is an elevator, but it’s old andloud and opens in full view of the Temple Room. If you hope to move in quietly,you’ll need to ascend on foot.”“You’ll never find your way,” Langdon warned. “From that rear entrance, you’renavigating through the Hall of Regalia, the Hall of Honor, the middle landing,the Atrium, the Grand Stair—”“Enough,” Sato said. “Langdon’s coming.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 116The energy was growing.Mal’akh could feel it pulsing within him, moving up and down his body as hewheeled Peter Solomon toward the altar. I will exit this building infinitelymore powerful than when I entered. All that remained now was to locate the finalingredient.“Verbum significatium,” he whispered to himself. “Verbum omnificum.”Mal’akh parked Peter’s wheelchair beside the altar and then circled around andunzipped the heavy daybag that sat on Peter’s lap. Reaching inside, he liftedout the stone pyramid and held it up in the moonlight, directly in front ofPeter’s eyes, showing him the grid of symbols engraved on the bottom. “All theseyears,” he taunted, “and you never knew how the pyramid kept her secrets.”Mal’akh set the pyramid carefully on the corner of the altar and returned to thebag. “And this talisman,” he continued, extracting the golden capstone, “didindeed bring order from chaos, exactly as promised.” He placed the metalcapstone carefully atop the stone pyramid, and then stepped back to give Peter aclear view. “Behold, your symbolon is complete.”Peter’s face contorted, and he tried in vain to speak.“Good. I can see you have something you’d like to tell me.” Mal’akh roughlyyanked out the gag.Peter Solomon coughed and gasped for several seconds before he finally managedto speak. “Katherine . . .”“Katherine’s time is short. If you want to save her, I suggest you do exactly asI say.” Mal’akh suspected she was probably already dead, or if not, very close.It made no difference. She was lucky to have lived long enough to say good-byeto her brother.“Please,” Peter begged, his voice ragged. “Send an ambulance for her . . .”“I will do exactly that. But first you must tell me how to access the secretstaircase.”Peter’s expression turned to one of disbelief. “What?!”“The staircase. Masonic legend speaks of stairs that descend hundreds of feet tothe secret location where the Lost Word is buried.”Peter now looked panicked.“You know the legend,” Mal’akh baited. “A secret staircase hidden beneath astone.” He pointed to the central altar—a huge block of granite with a gildedinscription in Hebrew: GOD SAID, “LET THERE BE LIGHT” AND THERE WAS LIGHT.“Obviously, this is the right place. The entrance to the staircase must behidden on one of the floors beneath us.”“There is no secret staircase in this building!” Peter shouted.Mal’akh smiled patiently and motioned upward. “This building is shaped like apyramid.” He pointed to the four-sided vaulted ceiling that angled up to thesquare oculus in the center.“Yes, the House of the Temple is a pyramid, but what does—”“Peter, I have all night.” Mal’akh smoothed his white silk robe over his perfectbody. “Katherine, however, does not. If you want her to live, you will tell mehow to access the staircase.”“I already told you,” he declared, “there is no secret staircase in thisbuilding!”“No?” Mal’akh calmly produced the sheet of paper on which he had reorganized thegrid of symbols from the base of the pyramid. “This is the Masonic Pyramid’sfinal message. Your friend Robert Langdon helped me decipher it.”Mal’akh raised the paper and held it in front of Peter’s eyes. The WorshipfulMaster inhaled sharply when he saw it. Not only had the sixty-four symbols beenorganized into clearly meaningful groups . . . but an actual image hadmaterialized out of the chaos.An image of a staircase . . . beneath a pyramid.Peter Solomon stared in disbelief at the grid of symbols before him. The MasonicPyramid had kept its secret for generations. Now, suddenly, it was beingunveiled, and he felt a cold sense of foreboding in the pit of his stomach.The pyramid’s final code.At a glance, the true meaning of these symbols remained a mystery to Peter, andyet he could immediately understand why the tattooed man believed what hebelieved.He thinks there is a hidden staircase beneath the pyramid called Heredom. Hemisunderstands these symbols.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_027_r1.jpg]“Where is it?” the tattooed man demanded. “Tell me how to find the staircase,and I will save Katherine.”I wish I could do that, Peter thought. But the staircase is not real. The mythof the staircase was purely symbolic . . . part of the great allegories ofMasonry. The Winding Staircase, as it was known, appeared on the second-degreetracing boards. It represented man’s intellectual climb toward the Divine Truth.Like Jacob’s ladder, the Winding Staircase was a symbol of the pathway to heaven. . . the journey of man toward God . . . the connection between the earthly andspiritual realms. Its steps represented the many virtues of the mind.He should know that, Peter thought. He endured all the initiations.Every Masonic initiate learned of the symbolic staircase that he could ascend,enabling him “to participate in the mysteries of human science.” Freemasonry,like Noetic Science and the Ancient Mysteries, revered the untapped potential ofthe human mind, and many of Masonry’s symbols related to human physiology.The mind sits like a golden capstone atop the physical body. The Philosopher’sStone. Through the staircase of the spine, energy ascends and descends,circulating, connecting the heavenly mind to the physical body.Peter knew it was no coincidence that the spine was made up of exactlythirty-three vertebrae. Thirty-three are the degrees of Masonry. The base of thespine, or sacrum, literally meant “sacred bone.” The body is indeed a temple.The human science that Masons revered was the ancient understanding of how touse that temple for its most potent and noble purpose.Unfortunately, explaining the truth to this man was not going to help Katherineat all. Peter gazed down at the grid of symbols and gave a defeated sigh.“You’re right,” he lied. “There is indeed a secret staircase beneath thisbuilding. And as soon as you send help to Katherine, I’ll take you to it.”The man with the tattoos simply stared at him.Solomon glared back, eyes defiant. “Either save my sister and learn the truth .. . or kill us both and remain ignorant forever!”The man quietly lowered the paper and shook his head. “I’m not happy with you,Peter. You failed your test. You still take me for a fool. Do you truly believeI don’t understand what it is I seek? Do you think I have not yet grasped mytrue potential?”With that, the man turned his back and slipped off his robe. As the white silkfluttered to the floor, Peter saw for the first time the long tattoo running upthe man’s spine.Dear God . . .Winding up from the man’s white loincloth, an elegant spiral staircase ascendedthe middle of his muscular back. Each stair was positioned on a differentvertebra. Speechless, Peter let his eyes ascend the staircase, all the way up tothe base of the man’s skull.Peter could only stare.The tattooed man now tipped his shaved head backward, revealing the circle ofbare flesh on the pinnacle of his skull. The virgin skin was bordered by asingle snake, looped in a circle, consuming itself.At-one-ment.Slowly now, the man lowered his head and turned to face Peter. The massivedouble-headed phoenix on his chest stared out through dead eyes.“I am looking for the Lost Word,” the man said. “Are you going to help me . . .or are you and your sister going to die?”You know how to find it, Mal’akh thought. You know something you’re not tellingme.Peter Solomon had revealed things under interrogation that he probably didn’teven recall now. The repeated sessions in and out of the deprivation tank hadleft him delirious and compliant. Incredibly, when he spilled his guts,everything he told Mal’akh had been consistent with the legend of the Lost Word.The Lost Word is not a metaphor . . . it is real. The Word is written in anancient language . . . and has been hidden for ages. The Word is capable ofbringing unfathomable power to anyone who grasps its true meaning. The Wordremains hidden to this day . . . and the Masonic Pyramid has the power to unveilit.“Peter,” Mal’akh now said, staring into his captive’s eyes, “when you looked atthat grid of symbols . . . you saw something. You had a revelation. This gridmeans something to you. Tell me.”“I will tell you nothing until you send help to Katherine!”Mal’akh smiled at him. “Believe me, the prospect of losing your sister is theleast of your worries right now.” Without another word, he turned to Langdon’sdaybag and started removing the items he had packed in his basement. Then hebegan meticulously arranging them on the sacrificial altar.A folded silk cloth. Pure white.A silver censer. Egyptian myrrh.A vial of Peter’s blood. Mixed with ash.A black crow’s feather. His sacred stylus.The sacrificial knife. Forged of iron from a meteorite in the desert of Canaan.“You think I am afraid to die?” Peter shouted, his voice racked with anguish.“If Katherine is gone, I have nothing left! You’ve murdered my entire family!You’ve taken everything from me!”“Not everything,” Mal’akh replied. “Not yet.” He reached into the day-bag andpulled out the laptop from his study. He turned it on and looked over at hiscaptive. “I’m afraid you have not yet grasped the true nature of yourpredicament.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 117Langdon felt his stomach drop as the CIA helicopter leaped off the lawn, bankedhard, and accelerated faster than he ever imagined a helicopter could move.Katherine had stayed behind to recuperate with Bellamy while one of the CIAagents searched the mansion and waited for a backup team.Before Langdon left, she had kissed him on the cheek and whispered, “Be safe,Robert.”Now Langdon was holding on for dear life as the military helicopter finallyleveled out and raced toward the House of the Temple.Seated beside him, Sato was yelling up to the pilot. “Head for Dupont Circle!”she shouted over the deafening noise. “We’ll set down there!”Startled, Langdon turned to her. “Dupont?! That’s blocks from the House of theTemple! We can land in the Temple parking lot!”Sato shook her head. “We need to enter the building quietly. If our target hearsus coming—”“We don’t have time!” Langdon argued. “This lunatic is about to murder Peter!Maybe the sound of the helicopter will scare him and make him stop!”Sato stared at him with ice-cold eyes. “As I have told you, Peter Solomon’ssafety is not my primary objective. I believe I’ve made that clear.”Langdon was in no mood for another national-security lecture. “Look, I’m theonly one on board who knows his way through that building—”“Careful, Professor,” the director warned. “You are here as a member of my team,and I will have your complete cooperation.” She paused a moment and then added,“In fact, it might be wise if I now apprised you fully of the severity of ourcrisis tonight.”Sato reached under her seat and pulled out a sleek titanium briefcase, which sheopened to reveal an unusually complicated-looking computer. When she turned iton, a CIA logo materialized along with a log-in prompt.As Sato logged in, she asked, “Professor, do you remember the blond hairpiece wefound in the man’s home?”“Yes.”“Well, hidden within that wig was a tiny fiber-optic camera . . . concealed inthe bangs.”“A hidden camera? I don’t understand.”Sato looked grim. “You will.” She launched a file on the laptop.ONE MOMENT PLEASE . . .DECRYPTING FILE . . .A video window popped up, filling the entire screen. Sato lifted the briefcaseand set it on Langdon’s thighs, giving him a front-row seat.An unusual image materialized on the screen.Langdon recoiled in surprise. What the hell?!Murky and dark, the video was of a blindfolded man. He was dressed in the garbof a medieval heretic being led to the gallows—noose around his neck, left pantleg rolled up to the knee, right sleeve rolled up to the elbow, and his shirtgaping open to reveal his bare chest.Langdon stared in disbelief. He had read enough about Masonic rituals torecognize exactly what he was looking at.A Masonic initiate . . . preparing to enter the first degree.The man was very muscular and tall, with a familiar blond hairpiece and deeplytanned skin. Langdon recognized his features at once. The man’s tattoos hadobviously been concealed beneath bronzing makeup. He was standing before afull-length mirror videotaping his reflection through the camera concealed inhis wig.But . . . why?The screen faded to black.New footage appeared. A small, dimly lit, rectangular chamber. A dramaticchessboard floor of black-and-white tile. A low wooden altar, flanked on threesides by pillars, atop which burned flickering candles.Langdon felt a sudden apprehension.Oh my God.Filming in the erratic style of an amateur home video, the camera now panned upto the periphery of the room to reveal a small group of men observing theinitiate. The men were dressed in ritual Masonic regalia. In the darkness,Langdon could not make out their faces, but he had no doubt where this ritualwas taking place.The traditional layout of this Lodge Room could have been anywhere in the world,but the powder-blue triangular pediment above the master’s chair revealed it asthe oldest Masonic lodge in D.C.—Potomac Lodge No. 5—home of George Washingtonand the Masonic forefathers who laid the cornerstone for the White House and theCapitol Building.The lodge was still active today.Peter Solomon, in addition to overseeing the House of the Temple, was the masterof his local lodge. And it was at lodges like this one that a Masonic initiate’sjourney always began . . . where he underwent the first three degrees ofFreemasonry.“Brethren,” Peter’s familiar voice declared, “in the name of the Great Architectof the Universe, I open this lodge for the practice of Masonry in the firstdegree!”A gavel rapped loudly.Langdon watched in utter disbelief as the video progressed through a quickseries of dissolves featuring Peter Solomon performing some of the ritual’sstarker moments.Pressing a shining dagger to the initiate’s bare chest . . . threateningimpalement should the initiate “inappropriately reveal the Mysteries of Masonry”. . . describing the black-and-white floor as representing “the living and thedead” . . . outlining punishments that included “having one’s throat cut across,one’s tongue torn out by its roots, and one’s body buried in the rough sands ofthe sea . . .”Langdon stared. Am I really witnessing this? Masonic initiation rites hadremained shrouded in secrecy for centuries. The only descriptions that had everbeen leaked were written by a handful of estranged brothers. Langdon had readthose accounts, of course, and yet to see an initiation with his own eyes . . .this was a much different story.Especially edited this way. Langdon could already tell that the video was anunfair piece of propaganda, omitting all the noblest aspects of the initiationand highlighting only the most disconcerting. If this video were released,Langdon knew it would become an Internet sensation over night. The anti-Masonicconspiracy theorists would feed on this like sharks. The Masonic organization,and especially Peter Solomon, would find themselves embroiled in a firestorm ofcontroversy and a desperate effort at damage control . . . even though theritual was innocuous and purely symbolic.Eerily, the video included a biblical reference to human sacrifice . . . “thesubmission of Abraham to the Supreme Being by proffering Isaac, his firstbornson.” Langdon thought of Peter and willed the helicopter to fly faster.The video footage shifted now.Same room. Different night. A larger group of Masons looking on. Peter Solomonwas observing from the master’s chair. This was the second degree. More intensenow. Kneeling at the altar . . . vowing to “forever conceal the enigmas existingwithin Freemasonry” . . . consenting to the penalty of “having one’s chestcavity ripped open and pulsing heart cast upon the surface of the earth as offalfor the ravenous beasts” . . .Langdon’s own heart was pulsing wildly now as the video shifted yet again.Another night. A much larger crowd. A coffin-shaped “tracing board” on thefloor.The third degree.This was the death ritual—the most rigorous of all the degrees—the moment inwhich the initiate was forced “to face the final challenge of personalextinction.” This grueling interrogation was in fact the source of the commonphrase to give someone the third degree. And although Langdon was very familiarwith academic accounts of it, he was in no way prepared for what he now saw.The murder.In violent, rapid intercuts, the video displayed a chilling, victim’spoint-of-view account of the initiate’s brutal murder. There were simulatedblows to his head, including one with a Mason’s stone maul. All the while, adeacon mournfully told the story of “the widow’s son”—Hiram Abiff—the masterArchitect of King Solomon’s temple, who chose to die rather than reveal thesecret wisdom he possessed.The attack was mimed, of course, and yet its effect on camera was bloodcurdling.After the deathblow, the initiate—now “dead to his former self”—was lowered intohis symbolic coffin, where his eyes were shut and his arms were crossed likethose of a corpse. The Masonic brothers rose and mournfully circled his deadbody while a pipe organ played a march of the dead.The macabre scene was deeply disturbing.And it only got worse.As the men gathered around their slain brother, the hidden camera clearlydisplayed their faces. Langdon now realized that Solomon was not the only famousman in the room. One of the men peering down at the initiate in his coffin wason television almost daily.A prominent U.S. senator.Oh God . . .The scene changed yet again. Outside now . . . nighttime . . . the same jumpyvideo footage . . . the man was walking down a city street . . . strands ofblond hair blowing in front of the camera . . . turning a corner . . .the cameraangle lowering to something in the man’s hand . . . a dollar bill . . . aclose-up focusing on the Great Seal . . . the all-seeing eye . . . theunfinished pyramid . . . and then, abruptly, pulling away to reveal a similarshape in the distance . . . a massive pyramidical building . . . with slopingsides rising to a truncated top.The House of the Temple.A soul-deep dread swelled within him.The video kept moving . . . the man hurrying toward the building now . . . upthe multitiered staircase . . . toward the giant bronze doors . . . between thetwo seventeen-ton sphinx guardians.A neophyte entering the pyramid of initiation.Darkness now.A powerful pipe organ played in the distance . . . and a new image materialized.The Temple Room.Langdon swallowed hard.On-screen, the cavernous space was alive with electricity. Beneath the oculus,the black marble altar shone in the moonlight. Assembled around it, seated onhand-tooled pigskin chairs, awaited a somber council of distinguishedthirty-third-degree Masons, present to bear witness. The video now panned acrosstheir faces with slow and deliberate intention.Langdon stared in horror.Although he had not seen this coming, what he was looking at made perfect sense.A gathering of the most decorated and accomplished Masons in the most powerfulcity on earth would logically include many influential and well-knownindividuals. Sure enough, seated around the altar, adorned in their long silkgloves, Masonic aprons, and glistening jewels, were some of the country’s mostpowerful men.Two Supreme Court justices . . .The secretary of defense . . .The speaker of the House . . .Langdon felt ill as the video continued panning across the faces of those inattendance.Three prominent senators . . . including the majority leader . . .The secretary of homeland security . . .And . . .The director of the CIA . . .Langdon wanted only to look away, but he could not. The scene was utterlymesmerizing, alarming even to him. In an instant, he had come to understand thesource of Sato’s anxiety and concern.Now, on-screen, the shot dissolved into a single shocking image.A human skull . . . filled with dark crimson liquid. The famed caput mortuum wasbeing offered forth to the initiate by the slender hands of Peter Solomon, whosegold Masonic ring glinted in the candlelight. The red liquid was wine . . . andyet it shimmered like blood. The visual effect was frightful.The Fifth Libation, Langdon realized, having read firsthand accounts of thissacrament in John Quincy Adams’s Letters on the Masonic Institution. Even so, tosee it happen . . . to see it calmly witnessed by America’s most powerful men .. . this was as arresting an image as any Langdon had ever seen.The initiate took the skull in his hands . . . his face reflected in the calmsurface of the wine. “May this wine I now drink become a deadly poison to me,”he declared, “should I ever knowingly or willfully violate my oath.”Obviously, this initiate had intended to violate his oath beyond allimagination.Langdon could barely get his mind around what would happen if this video weremade public. No one would understand. The government would be thrown intoupheaval. The airwaves would be filled with the voices of anti-Masonic groups,fundamentalists, and conspiracy theorists spewing hatred and fear, launching aPuritan witch hunt all over again.The truth will be twisted, Langdon knew. As it always is with the Masons.The truth was that the brotherhood’s focus on death was in fact a boldcelebration of life. Masonic ritual was designed to awaken the slumbering maninside, lifting him from his dark coffin of ignorance, raising him into thelight, and giving him eyes to see. Only through the death experience could manfully understand his life experience. Only through the realization that his dayson earth were finite could he grasp the importance of living those days withhonor, integrity, and service to his fellow man.Masonic initiations were startling because they were meant to be transformative.Masonic vows were unforgiving because they were meant to be reminders that man’shonor and his “word” were all he could take from this world. Masonic teachingswere arcane because they were meant to be universal . . . taught through acommon language of symbols and metaphors that transcended religions, cultures,and races . . . creating a unified “worldwide consciousness” of brotherly love.For a brief instant, Langdon felt a glimmer of hope. He tried to assure himselfthat if this video were to leak out, the public would be open-minded andtolerant, realizing that all spiritual rituals included aspects that would seemfrightening if taken out of context—crucifixion reenactments, Jewishcircumcision rites, Mormon baptisms of the dead, Catholic exorcisms, Islamicniqab, shamanic trance healing, the Jewish Kaparot ceremony, even the eating ofthe figurative body and blood of Christ.I’m dreaming, Langdon knew. This video will create chaos. He could imagine whatwould happen if the prominent leaders of Russia or the Islamic world were seenin a video, pressing knives to bare chests, swearing violent oaths, performingmock murders, lying in symbolic coffins, and drinking wine from a human skull.The global outcry would be instantaneous and overwhelming.God help us . . .On-screen now, the initiate was raising the skull to his lips. He tipped itbackward . . . draining the blood-red wine . . . sealing his oath. Then helowered the skull and gazed out at the assembly around him. America’s mostpowerful and trusted men gave contented nods of acceptance.“Welcome, brother,” Peter Solomon said.As the image faded to black, Langdon realized he had stopped breathing.Without a word, Sato reached over, closed the briefcase, and lifted it off hislap. Langdon turned to her trying to speak, but he could find no words. Itdidn’t matter. Understanding was written all over his face. Sato was right.Tonight was a national-security crisis . . . of unimaginable proportions."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 118Dressed in his loincloth, Mal’akh padded back and forth in front of PeterSolomon’s wheelchair. “Peter,” he whispered, enjoying every moment of hiscaptive’s horror, “you forgot you have a second family . . . your Masonicbrothers. And I will destroy them, too . . . unless you help me.”Solomon looked almost catatonic in the glow of the laptop sitting atop histhighs. “Please,” he finally stammered, glancing up. “If this video gets out . ..”“If?” Mal’akh laughed. “If it gets out?” He motioned to the small cellular modemplugged into the side of his laptop. “I’m connected to the world.”“You wouldn’t . . .”I will, Mal’akh thought, enjoying Solomon’s horror. “You have the power to stopme,” he said. “And to save your sister. But you have to tell me what I want toknow. The Lost Word is hidden somewhere, Peter, and I know this grid revealsexactly where to find it.”Peter glanced at the grid of symbols again, his eyes revealing nothing.“Perhaps this will help to inspire you.” Mal’akh reached over Peter’s shouldersand hit a few keys on the laptop. An e-mail program launched on the screen, andPeter stiffened visibly. The screen now displayed an e-mail that Mal’akh hadcued earlier tonight—a video file addressed to a long list of major medianetworks.Mal’akh smiled. “I think it’s time we share, don’t you?”“Don’t!”Mal’akh reached down and clicked the send button on the program. Peter jerkedagainst his bonds, trying unsuccessfully to knock the laptop to the floor.“Relax, Peter,” Mal’akh whispered. “It’s a massive file. It will take a fewminutes to go out.” He pointed to the progress bar:SENDING MESSAGE: 2% COMPLETE“If you tell me what I want to know, I’ll stop the e-mail, and nobody will eversee this.”Peter was ashen as the task bar inched forward.SENDING MESSAGE: 4% COMPLETEMal’akh now lifted the computer from Peter’s lap and set it on one of the nearbypigskin chairs, turning the screen so the other man could watch the progress.Then he returned to Peter’s side and laid the page of symbols in his lap. “Thelegends say the Masonic Pyramid will unveil the Lost Word. This is the pyramid’sfinal code. I believe you know how to read it.”Mal’akh glanced over at the laptop.SENDING MESSAGE: 8% COMPLETEMal’akh returned his eyes to Peter. Solomon was staring at him, his gray eyesblazing now with hatred.Hate me, Mal’akh thought. The greater the emotion, the more potent the energythat will be released when the ritual is completed.At Langley, Nola Kaye pressed the phone to her ear, barely able to hear Satoover the noise of the helicopter.“They said it’s impossible to stop the file transfer!” Nola shouted. “To shutdown local ISPs would take at least an hour, and if he’s got access to awireless provider, killing the ground-based Internet won’t stop him from sendingit anyway.”Nowadays, stopping the flow of digital information had become nearly impossible.There were too many access routes to the Internet. Between hard lines, Wi-Fi hotspots, cellular modems, SAT phones, superphones, and e-mail-equipped PDAs, theonly way to isolate a potential data leak was by destroying the source machine.“I pulled the spec sheet on the UH-60 you’re flying,” Nola said, “and it lookslike you’re equipped with EMP.”Electromagnetic-pulse or EMP guns were now commonplace among law enforcementagencies, which used them primarily to stop car chases from a safe distance. Byfiring a highly concentrated pulse of electromagnetic radiation, an EMP guncould effectively fry the electronics of any device it targeted—cars, cellphones, computers. According to Nola’s spec sheet, the UH-60 had achassis-mounted, laser-sighted, six-gigahertz magnetron with a fifty-dB-gainhorn that yielded a ten-gigawatt pulse. Discharged directly at a laptop, thepulse would fry the computer’s motherboard and instantly erase the hard drive.“EMP will be useless,” Sato yelled back. “Target is inside a stone building. Nosight lines and thick EM shielding. Do you have any indication yet if the videohas gone out?”Nola glanced at a second monitor, which was running a continuous search forbreaking news stories about the Masons. “Not yet, ma’am. But if it goes public,we’ll know within seconds.”“Keep me posted.” Sato signed off.Langdon held his breath as the helicopter dropped from the sky toward DupontCircle. A handful of pedestrians scattered as the aircraft descended through anopening in the trees and landed hard on the lawn just south of the famoustwo-tiered fountain designed by the same two men who created the LincolnMemorial.Thirty seconds later, Langdon was riding shotgun in a commandeered Lexus SUV,tearing up New Hampshire Avenue toward the House of the Temple.Peter Solomon was desperately trying to figure out what to do. All he could seein his mind were the images of Katherine bleeding in the basement . . . and ofthe video he had just witnessed. He turned his head slowly toward the laptop onthe pigskin chair several yards away. The progress bar was almost a third of theway filled.SENDING MESSAGE: 29% COMPLETEThe tattooed man was now walking slow circles around the square altar, swinginga lit censer and chanting to himself. Thick puffs of white smoke swirled uptoward the skylight. The man’s eyes were wide now, and he seemed to be in ademonic trance. Peter turned his gaze to the ancient knife that sat waiting onthe white silk cloth spread across the altar.Peter Solomon had no doubt that he would die in this temple tonight. Thequestion was how to die. Would he find a way to save his sister and hisbrotherhood . . . or would his death be entirely in vain?He glanced down at the grid of symbols. When he had first laid eyes on the grid,the shock of the moment had blinded him . . . preventing his vision frompiercing the veil of chaos . . . to glimpse the startling truth. Now, however,the real significance of these symbols had become crystal clear to him. He hadseen the grid in an entirely new light.Peter Solomon knew exactly what he needed to do.Taking a deep breath, he gazed up at the moon through the oculus above. Then hebegan to speak.All great truths are simple.Mal’akh had learned that long ago.The solution that Peter Solomon was now explaining was so graceful and pure thatMal’akh was sure that it could only be true. Incredibly, the solution to thepyramid’s final code was far simpler than he had ever imagined.The Lost Word was right before my eyes.In an instant, a bright ray of light pierced the murkiness of the history andmyth surrounding the Lost Word. As promised, the Lost Word was indeed written inan ancient language and bore mystical power in every philosophy, religion, andscience ever known to man. Alchemy, astrology, Kabbalah, Christianity, Buddhism,Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry, astronomy, physics, Noetics . . .Standing now in this initiation chamber atop the great pyramid of Heredom,Mal’akh gazed upon the treasure he had sought all these years, and he knew hecould not have prepared himself more perfectly.Soon I am complete.The Lost Word is found.In Kalorama Heights, a lone CIA agent stood amid a sea of garbage that he haddumped out of the trash bins that had been found in the garage.“Ms. Kaye?” he said, speaking to Sato’s analyst on the phone. “Good thinking tosearch his garbage. I think I just found something.”Inside the house, Katherine Solomon was feeling stronger with every passingmoment. The infusion of lactated Ringer’s solution had successfully raised herblood pressure and quelled her throbbing headache. She was resting now, seatedin the dining room, with explicit instructions to remain still. Her nerves feltfrayed, and she was increasingly anxious for news about her brother.Where is everybody? The CIA’s forensics team had not yet arrived, and the agentwho had stayed behind was still off searching the premises. Bellamy had beensitting with her in the dining room, still wrapped in a foil blanket, but he,too, had wandered off to look for any information that might help the CIA savePeter.Unable to sit idly, Katherine pulled herself to her feet, teetered, and theninched slowly toward the living room. She found Bellamy in the study. TheArchitect was standing at an open drawer, his back to her, apparently tooengrossed in its contents to hear her enter.She walked up behind him. “Warren?”The old man lurched and turned, quickly shutting the drawer with his hip. Hisface was lined with shock and grief, his cheeks streaked with tears.“What’s wrong?!” She glanced down at the drawer. “What is it?”Bellamy seemed unable to speak. He had the look of a man who had just seensomething he deeply wished he had not.“What’s in the drawer?” she demanded.Bellamy’s tear-filled eyes held hers for a long, sorrowful moment. Finally hespoke. “You and I wondered why . . . why this man seemed to hate your family.”Katherine’s brow furrowed. “Yes?”“Well . . .” Bellamy’s voice caught. “I just found the answer.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 119In the chamber at the top of the House of the Temple, the one who called himselfMal’akh stood before the great altar and gently massaged the virgin skin atophis head. Verbum significatium, he chanted in preparation. Verbum omnificum. Thefinal ingredient had been found at last.The most precious treasures are often the simplest.Above the altar, wisps of fragrant smoke now swirled, billowing up from thecenser. The suffumigations ascended through the shaft of moonlight, clearing achannel skyward through which a liberated soul could travel freely.The time had come.Mal’akh retrieved the vial of Peter’s darkened blood and uncorked it. With hiscaptive looking on, he dipped the nib of the crow’s feather into the crimsontincture and raised it to the sacred circle of flesh atop his head. He paused amoment . . . thinking of how long he had waited for this night. His greattransformation was finally at hand. When the Lost Word is written on the mind ofman, he is then ready to receive unimaginable power. Such was the ancientpromise of apotheosis. So far, mankind had been unable to realize that promise,and Mal’akh had done what he could to keep it that way.With a steady hand, Mal’akh touched the nib of the feather to his skin. Heneeded no mirror, no assistance, only his sense of touch, and his mind’s eye.Slowly, meticulously, he began inscribing the Lost Word inside the circularouroboros on his scalp.Peter Solomon looked on with an expression of horror.When Mal’akh finished, he closed his eyes, set down the feather, and let the airout of his lungs entirely. For the first time in his life, he felt a sensationhe had never known.I am complete.I am at one.Mal’akh had worked for years on the artifact that was his body, and now, as heneared his moment of final transformation, he could feel every line that hadever been inscribed on his flesh. I am a true masterpiece. Perfect and complete.“I gave you what you asked for.” Peter’s voice intruded. “Send help toKatherine. And stop that file.”Mal’akh opened his eyes and smiled. “You and I are not quite finished.” Heturned to the altar and picked up the sacrificial knife, running his fingeracross the sleek iron blade. “This ancient knife was commissioned by God,” hesaid, “for use in a human sacrifice. You recognized it earlier, no?”Solomon’s gray eyes were like stone. “It is unique, and I’ve heard the legend.”“Legend? The account appears in Holy Scripture. You don’t believe it’s true?”Peter just stared.Mal’akh had spent a fortune locating and obtaining this artifact. Known as theAkedah knife, it had been crafted over three thousand years ago from an ironmeteorite that had fallen to earth. Iron from heaven, as the early mysticscalled it. It was believed to be the exact knife used by Abraham at theAkedah—the near sacrifice of his son Isaac on Mount Moriah—as depicted inGenesis. The knife’s astounding history included possession by popes, Nazimystics, European alchemists, and private collectors.They protected and admired it, Mal’akh thought, but none dared unleash its truepower by using it for its real purpose. Tonight, the Akedah knife would fulfillits destiny.The Akedah had always been sacred in Masonic ritual. In the very first degree,Masons celebrated “the most august gift ever offered to God . . . the submissionof Abraham to the volitions of the supreme being by proffering Isaac, hisfirstborn . . .”The weight of the blade felt exhilarating in Mal’akh’s hand as he crouched downand used the freshly sharpened knife to sever the ropes binding Peter to hiswheelchair. The bonds fell to the floor.Peter Solomon winced in pain as he attempted to shift his cramped limbs. “Whyare you doing this to me? What do you think this will accomplish?”“You of all people should understand,” Mal’akh replied. “You study the ancientways. You know that the power of the mysteries relies on sacrifice . . . onreleasing a human soul from its body. It has been this way since the beginning.”“You know nothing of sacrifice,” Peter said, his voice seething with pain andloathing.Excellent, Mal’akh thought. Feed your hatred. It will only make this easier.Mal’akh’s empty stomach growled as he paced before his captive. “There isenormous power in the shedding of human blood. Everyone understood that, fromthe early Egyptians, to the Celtic Druids, to the Chinese, to the Aztecs. Thereis magic in human sacrifice, but modern man has become weak, too fearful to maketrue offerings, too frail to give the life that is required for spiritualtransformation. The ancient texts are clear, though. Only by offering what ismost sacred can man access the ultimate power.”“You consider me a sacred offering?”Mal’akh now laughed out loud. “You really don’t understand yet, do you?”Peter gave him an odd look.“Do you know why I have a deprivation tank in my home?” Mal’akh placed his handson his hips and flexed his elaborately decorated body, which was still coveredonly by a loincloth. “I have been practicing . . . preparing . . . anticipatingthe moment when I am only mind . . . when I am released from this mortal shell .. . when I have offered up this beautiful body to the gods in sacrifice. I amthe precious one! I am the pure white lamb!”Peter’s mouth fell open but no words came out.“Yes, Peter, a man must offer to the gods that which he holds most dear. Hispurest white dove . . . his most precious and worthy offering. You are notprecious to me. You are not a worthy offering.” Mal’akh glared at him. “Don’tyou see? You are not the sacrifice, Peter . . . I am. Mine is the flesh that isthe offering. I am the gift. Look at me. I have prepared, made myself worthy formy final journey. I am the gift!”Peter remained speechless.“The secret is how to die,” Mal’akh now said. “Masons understand that.” Hepointed to the altar. “You revere the ancient truths, and yet you are cowards.You understand the power of sacrifice and yet you keep a safe distance fromdeath, performing your mock murders and bloodless death rituals. Tonight, yoursymbolic altar will bear witness to its true power . . . and its actualpurpose.”Mal’akh reached down and grasped Peter Solomon’s left hand, pressing the handleof the Akedah knife into his palm. The left hand serves the darkness. This, too,had been planned. Peter would have no choice in the matter. Mal’akh could fathomno sacrifice more potent and symbolic than one performed on this altar, by thisman, with this knife, plunged into the heart of an offering whose mortal fleshwas wrapped like a gift in a shroud of mystical symbols.With this offering of self, Mal’akh would establish his rank in the hierarchy ofdemons. Darkness and blood were where the true power lay. The ancients knewthis, the Adepts choosing sides consistent with their individual natures.Mal’akh had chosen sides wisely. Chaos was the natural law of the universe.Indifference was the engine of entropy. Man’s apathy was the fertile ground inwhich the dark spirits tended their seeds.I have served them, and they will receive me as a god.Peter did not move. He simply stared down at the ancient knife gripped in hishand.“I will you,” Mal’akh taunted. “I am a willing sacrifice. Your final role hasbeen written. You will transform me. You will liberate me from my body. You willdo this, or you will lose your sister and your brotherhood. You will truly beall alone.” He paused, smiling down at his captive. “Consider this your finalpunishment.”Peter’s eyes rose slowly to meet Mal’akh’s. “Killing you? A punishment? Do youthink I will hesitate? You murdered my son. My mother. My entire family.”“No!” Mal’akh exploded with a force that startled even himself. “You are wrong!I did not murder your family! You did! It was you who made the choice to leaveZachary in prison! And from there, the wheels were in motion! You killed yourfamily, Peter, not me!”Peter’s knuckles turned white, his fingers clenching the knife in rage. “Youknow nothing of why I left Zachary in prison.”“I know everything!” Mal’akh fired back. “I was there. You claimed you weretrying to help him. Were you trying to help him when you offered him the choicebetween wealth or wisdom? Were you trying to help him when you gave him theultimatum to join the Masons? What kind of father gives a child the choicebetween ‘wealth or wisdom’ and expects him to know how to handle it! What kindof father leaves his own son in a prison instead of flying him home to safety!”Mal’akh now moved in front of Peter and crouched down, placing his tattooed faceonly inches from his face. “But most important . . . what kind of father canlook his own son in the eyes . . . even after all these years . . . and not evenrecognize him!”Mal’akh’s words echoed for several seconds in the stone chamber.Then silence.In the abrupt stillness, Peter Solomon seemed to have been jolted from histrance. His face clouded now with a visage of total incredulity.Yes, Father. It’s me. Mal’akh had waited years for this moment . . . to takerevenge on the man who had abandoned him . . . to stare into those gray eyes andspeak the truth that had been buried all these years. Now the moment was here,and he spoke slowly, longing to watch the full weight of his words graduallycrush Peter Solomon’s soul. “You should be happy, Father. Your prodigal son hasreturned.”Peter’s face was now as pale as death.Mal’akh savored every moment. “My own father made the decision to leave me inprison . . . and in that instant, I vowed that he had rejected me for the lasttime. I was no longer his son. Zachary Solomon ceased to exist.”Two glistening teardrops welled suddenly in his father’s eyes, and Mal’akhthought they were the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.Peter choked back tears, staring up at Mal’akh’s face as if seeing him for thevery first time.“All the warden wanted was money,” Mal’akh said, “but you refused. It neveroccurred to you, though, that my money was just as green as yours. The wardendid not care who paid him, only that he was paid. When I offered to pay himhandsomely, he selected a sickly inmate about my size, dressed him in myclothes, and beat him beyond all recognition. The photos you saw . . . and thesealed casket you buried . . . they were not mine. They belonged to a stranger.”Peter’s tear-streaked face contorted now with anguish and disbelief. “Oh my God. . . Zachary.”“Not anymore. When Zachary walked out of prison, he was transformed.”His adolescent physique and childlike face had drastically mutated when heflooded his young body with experimental growth hormones and steroids. Even hisvocal cords had been ravaged, transforming his boyish voice into a permanentwhisper.Zachary became Andros.Andros became Mal’akh.And tonight . . . Mal’akh will become his greatest incarnation of all.At that moment in Kalorama Heights, Katherine Solomon stood over the open deskdrawer and gazed down at what could be described only as a fetishist’scollection of old newspaper articles and photographs.“I don’t understand,” she said, turning to Bellamy. “This lunatic was obviouslyobsessed with my family, but—”“Keep going . . .” urged Bellamy, taking a seat and still looking deeply shaken.Katherine dug deeper into the newspaper articles, every one of which related tothe Solomon family—Peter’s many successes, Katherine’s research, their motherIsabel’s terrible murder, Zachary Solomon’s widely publicized drug use,incarceration, and brutal murder in a Turkish prison.The fixation this man had on the Solomon family was beyond fanatical, and yetKatherine saw nothing yet to suggest why.It was then that she saw the photographs. The first showed Zachary standingknee-deep in azure water on a beach dotted with whitewashed houses. Greece? Thephoto, she assumed, could have been taken only during Zach’s freewheeling drugdays in Europe. Strangely, though, Zach looked healthier than he did in thepaparazzi shots of an emaciated kid partying with the drug crowd. He looked morefit, stronger somehow, more mature. Katherine never recalled him looking sohealthy.Puzzled, she checked the date stamp on the photo.But that’s . . . impossible.The date was almost a full year after Zachary had died in prison.Suddenly Katherine was flipping desperately through the stack. All of the photoswere of Zachary Solomon . . . gradually getting older. The collection appearedto be some kind of pictorial autobiography, chronicling a slow transformation.As the pictures progressed, Katherine saw a sudden and dramatic change. Shelooked on in horror as Zachary’s body began mutating, his muscles bulging, andhis facial features morphing from the obvious heavy use of steroids. His frameseemed to double in mass, and a haunting fierceness crept into his eyes.I don’t even recognize this man!He looked nothing like Katherine’s memories of her young nephew.When she reached a picture of him with a shaved head, she felt her knees beginto buckle. Then she saw a photo of his bare body . . . adorned with the firsttraces of tattoos.Her heart almost stopped. “Oh my God . . .”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 120“Right turn!” Langdon shouted from the backseat of the commandeered Lexus SUV.Simkins swerved onto S Street and gunned the vehicle through a tree-linedresidential neighborhood. As they neared the corner of Sixteenth Street, theHouse of the Temple rose like a mountain on the right.Simkins stared up at the massive structure. It looked like someone had built apyramid on top of Rome’s Pantheon. He prepared to turn right on Sixteenth towardthe front of the building.“Don’t turn!” Langdon ordered. “Go straight! Stay on S!”Simkins obeyed, driving alongside the east side of the building.“At Fifteenth,” Langdon said, “turn right!”Simkins followed his navigator, and moments later, Langdon had pointed out anearly invisible, unpaved access road that bisected the gardens behind the Houseof the Temple. Simkins turned in to the drive and gunned the Lexus toward therear of the building.“Look!” Langdon said, pointing to the lone vehicle parked near the rearentrance. It was a large van. “They’re here.”Simkins parked the SUV and killed the engine. Quietly, everyone got out andprepared to move in. Simkins stared up at the monolithic structure. “You say theTemple Room is at the top?”Langdon nodded, pointing all the way to the pinnacle of the building. “That flatarea on top of the pyramid is actually a skylight.”Simkins spun back to Langdon. “The Temple Room has a skylight?”Langdon gave him an odd look. “Of course. An oculus to heaven . . . directlyabove the altar.”The UH-60 sat idling at Dupont Circle.In the passenger seat, Sato gnawed at her fingernails, awaiting news from herteam.Finally, Simkins’s voice crackled over the radio. “Director?”“Sato here,” she barked.“We’re entering the building, but I have some additional recon for you.”“Go ahead.”“Mr. Langdon just informed me that the room in which the target is most likelylocated has a very large skylight.”Sato considered the information for several seconds. “Understood. Thank you.”Simkins signed off.Sato spit out a fingernail and turned to the pilot. “Take her up.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 121Like any parent who had lost a child, Peter Solomon had often imagined how oldhis boy would be now . . . what he would look like . . . and what he would havebecome.Peter Solomon now had his answers.The massive tattooed creature before him had begun life as a tiny, preciousinfant . . . baby Zach curled up in a wicker bassinette . . . taking his firstfumbling steps across Peter’s study . . . learning to speak his first words. Thefact that evil could spring from an innocent child in a loving family remainedone of the paradoxes of the human soul. Peter had been forced to accept early onthat although his own blood flowed in his son’s veins, the heart pumping thatblood was his son’s own. Unique and singular . . . as if randomly chosen fromthe universe.My son . . . he killed my mother, my friend Robert Langdon, and possibly mysister.An icy numbness flooded Peter’s heart as he searched his son’s eyes for anyconnection . . . anything familiar. The man’s eyes, however, although gray likePeter’s, were those of a total stranger, filled with a hatred and a vengefulnessthat were almost otherworldly.“Are you strong enough?” his son taunted, glancing at the Akedah knife grippedin Peter’s hand. “Can you finish what you started all those years ago?”“Son . . .” Solomon barely recognized his own voice. “I . . . I loved . . .you.”“Twice you tried to kill me. You abandoned me in prison. You shot me on Zach’sbridge. Now finish it!”For an instant, Solomon felt like he was floating outside his own body. He nolonger recognized himself. He was missing a hand, was totally bald, dressed in ablack robe, sitting in a wheelchair, and clutching an ancient knife.“Finish it!” the man shouted again, the tattoos on his naked chest rippling.“Killing me is the only way you can save Katherine . . . the only way to saveyour brotherhood!”Solomon felt his gaze move to the laptop and cellular modem on the pigskinchair.SENDING MESSAGE: 92% COMPLETEHis mind could not shake the images of Katherine bleeding to death . . . or ofhis Masonic brothers.“There is still time,” the man whispered. “You know it’s the only choice.Release me from my mortal shell.”“Please,” Solomon said. “Don’t do this . . .”“You did this!” the man hissed. “You forced your child to make an impossiblechoice! Do you remember that night? Wealth or wisdom? That was the night youpushed me away forever. But I’ve returned, Father . . . and tonight it is yourturn to choose. Zachary or Katherine? Which will it be? Will you kill your sonto save your sister? Will you kill your son to save your brotherhood? Yourcountry? Or will you wait until it’s too late? Until Katherine is dead . . .until the video is public . . . until you must live the rest of your lifeknowing you could have stopped these tragedies. Time is running out. You knowwhat must be done.”Peter’s heart ached. You are not Zachary, he told himself. Zachary died long,long ago. Whatever you are . . . and wherever you came from . . . you are not ofme. And although Peter Solomon did not believe his own words, he knew he had tomake a choice.He was out of time.Find the Grand Staircase!Robert Langdon dashed through darkened hallways, winding his way toward thecenter of the building. Turner Simkins remained close on his heels. As Langdonhad hoped, he burst out into the building’s main atrium.Dominated by eight Doric columns of green granite, the atrium looked like ahybrid sepulcher—Greco-Roman-Egyptian—with black marble statues, chandelier firebowls, Teutonic crosses, double-headed phoenix medallions, and sconces bearingthe head of Hermes.Langdon turned and ran toward the sweeping marble staircase at the far end ofthe atrium. “This leads directly to the Temple Room,” he whispered as the twomen ascended as quickly and quietly as possible.On the first landing, Langdon came face-to-face with a bronze bust of Masonicluminary Albert Pike, along with the engraving of his most famous quote: WHAT WEHAVE DONE FOR OURSELVES ALONE DIES WITH US; WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR OTHERS AND THEWORLD REMAINS AND IS IMMORTAL.Mal’akh had sensed a palpable shift in the atmosphere of the Temple Room, as ifall the frustration and pain Peter Solomon had ever felt was now boiling to thesurface . . . focusing itself like a laser on Mal’akh.Yes . . . it is time.Peter Solomon had risen from his wheelchair and was standing now, facing thealtar, gripping the knife.“Save Katherine,” Mal’akh coaxed, luring him toward the altar, backing up, andfinally laying his own body down on the white shroud he had prepared. “Do whatyou need to do.”As if moving through a nightmare, Peter inched forward.Mal’akh reclined fully now onto his back, gazing up through the oculus at thewintry moon. The secret is how to die. This moment could not be any moreperfect. Adorned with the Lost Word of the ages, I offer myself by the left handof my father.Mal’akh drew a deep breath.Receive me, demons, for this is my body, which is offered for you.Standing over Mal’akh, Peter Solomon was trembling. His tear-soaked eyes shonewith desperation, indecision, anguish. He looked one last time toward the modemand laptop across the room.“Make the choice,” Mal’akh whispered. “Release me from my flesh. God wants this.You want this.” He laid his arms at his side and arched his chest forward,offering up his magnificent double-headed phoenix. Help me shed the body thatclothes my soul.Peter’s tearful eyes seemed to be staring through Mal’akh now, not even seeinghim.“I killed your mother!” Mal’akh whispered. “I killed Robert Langdon! I’mmurdering your sister! I’m destroying your brotherhood! Do what you have to do!”Peter Solomon’s visage now contorted into a mask of absolute grief and regret.He threw his head back and screamed in anguish as he raised the knife.Robert Langdon and Agent Simkins arrived breathless outside the Temple Roomdoors as a bloodcurdling scream erupted from within. It was Peter’s voice.Langdon was certain.Peter’s cry was one of absolute agony.I’m too late!Ignoring Simkins, Langdon seized the handles and yanked open the doors. Thehorrific scene before him confirmed his worst fears. There, in the center of thedimly lit chamber, the silhouette of a man with a shaved head stood at the greataltar. He wore a black robe, and his hand was clutching a large blade.Before Langdon could move, the man was driving the knife down toward the bodythat lay outstretched on the altar.Mal’akh had closed his eyes.So beautiful. So perfect.The ancient blade of the Akedah knife had glinted in the moonlight as it archedover him. Scented wisps of smoke had spiraled upward above him, preparing apathway for his soon-to-be-liberated soul. His killer’s lone scream of tormentand desperation still rang through the sacred space as the knife came down.I am besmeared with the blood of human sacrifice and parents’ tears.Mal’akh braced for the glorious impact.His moment of transformation had arrived.Incredibly, he felt no pain.A thunderous vibration filled his body, deafening and deep. The room beganshaking, and a brilliant white light blinded him from above. The heavens roared.And Mal’akh knew it had happened.Exactly as he had planned.Langdon did not remember sprinting toward the altar as the helicopter appearedoverhead. Nor did he remember leaping with his arms out-stretched . . . soaringtoward the man in the black robe . . . trying desperately to tackle him beforehe could plunge the knife down a second time.Their bodies collided, and Langdon saw a bright light sweep down through theoculus and illuminate the altar. He expected to see the bloody body of PeterSolomon on the altar, but the naked chest that shone in the light had no bloodon it at all . . . only a tapestry of tattoos. The knife lay broken beside him,apparently having been driven into the stone altar rather than into flesh.As he and the man in the black robe crashed together onto the hard stone floor,Langdon saw the bandaged nub on the end of the man’s right arm, and he realizedto his bewilderment that he had just tackled Peter Solomon.As they slid together across the stone floor, the helicopter’s searchlightsblazed down from above. The chopper thundered in low, its skids practicallytouching the expansive wall of glass.On the front of the helicopter, a strange-looking gun rotated, aiming downwardthrough the glass. The red beam of its laser scope sliced through the skylightand danced across the floor, directly toward Langdon and Solomon.No!But there was no gunfire from above . . . only the sound of the helicopterblades.Langdon felt nothing but an eerie ripple of energy that shimmered through hiscells. Behind his head, on the pigskin chair, the laptop hissed strangely. Hespun in time to see its screen suddenly flash to black. Unfortunately, the lastvisible message had been clear.SENDING MESSAGE: 100% COMPLETEPull up! Damn it! Up!The UH-60 pilot threw his rotors into overdrive, trying to keep his skids fromtouching any part of the large glass skylight. He knew the six thousand poundsof lift force that surged downward from his rotors was already straining theglass to its breaking point. Unfortunately, the incline of the pyramid beneaththe helicopter was efficiently shedding the thrust sideways, robbing him oflift.Up! Now!He tipped the nose, trying to skim away, but the left strut hit the center ofthe glass. It was only for an instant, but that was all it took.The Temple Room’s massive oculus exploded in a swirl of glass and wind . . .sending a torrent of jagged shards plummeting into the room below.Stars falling from heaven.Mal’akh stared up into the beautiful white light and saw a veil of shimmeringjewels fluttering toward him . . . accelerating . . . as if racing to shroud himin their splendor.Suddenly there was pain.Everywhere.Stabbing. Searing. Slashing. Razor-sharp knives piercing soft flesh. Chest,neck, thighs, face. His body tightened all at once, recoiling. His blood-filledmouth cried out as the pain ripped him from his trance. The white light abovetransformed itself, and suddenly, as if by magic, a dark helicopter wassuspended above him, its thundering blades driving an icy wind down into theTemple Room, chilling Mal’akh to the core and dispersing the wisps of incense tothe distant corners of the room.Mal’akh turned his head and saw the Akedah knife lying broken by his side,smashed upon the granite altar, which was covered in a blanket of shatteredglass. Even after everything I did to him . . . Peter Solomon averted the knife.He refused to spill my blood.With welling horror, Mal’akh raised his head and peered down along the length ofhis own body. This living artifact was to have been his great offering. But itlay in tatters. His body was drenched in blood . . . huge shards of glassprotruding from his flesh in all directions.Weakly, Mal’akh lowered his head back to the granite altar and stared up throughthe open space in the roof. The helicopter was gone now, in its place a silent,wintry moon.Wide-eyed, Mal’akh lay gasping for breath . . . all alone on the great altar."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 122The secret is how to die.Mal’akh knew it had all gone wrong. There was no brilliant light. No wondrousreception. Only darkness and excruciating pain. Even in his eyes. He could seenothing, and yet he sensed movement all around him.

Your sister isokay.”No, Mal’akh thought. Katherine is dead. She must be.Mal’akh could no longer see, could not tell if his eyes were even open, but heheard the helicopter banking away. An abrupt calm settled through the TempleRoom. Mal’akh could feel the smooth rhythms of the earth becoming uneven . . .as if the ocean’s natural tides were being disrupted by a gathering storm.Chao ab ordo.Unfamiliar voices were shouting now, talking urgently with Langdon about thelaptop and video file. It’s too late, Mal’akh knew. The damage is done. By nowthe video was spreading like wildfire into every corner of a shocked world,destroying the future of the brotherhood. Those most capable of spreading thewisdom must be destroyed. The ignorance of mankind is what helped the chaosgrow. The absence of Light on earth is what nourished the Darkness that awaitedMal’akh.I have done great deeds, and soon I will be received as a king.Mal’akh sensed that a lone individual had quietly approached. He knew who itwas. He could smell the sacred oils he had rubbed into his father’s shaved body.“I don’t know if you can hear me,” Peter Solomon whispered in his ear. “But Iwant you to know something.” He touched a finger to the sacred spot atopMal’akh’s skull. “What you wrote here . . .” He paused. “This is not the LostWord.”Of course it is, Mal’akh thought. You convinced me of that beyond a doubt.According to legend, the Lost Word was written in a language so ancient andarcane that mankind had all but forgotten how to read it. This mysteriouslanguage, Peter had revealed, was in fact the oldest language on earth.The language of symbols.In the idiom of symbology, there was one symbol that reigned supreme above allothers. The oldest and most universal, this symbol fused all the ancienttraditions in a single solitary image that represented the illumination of theEgyptian sun god, the triumph of alchemical gold, the wisdom of thePhilosopher’s Stone, the purity of the Rosicrucian Rose, the moment of Creation,the All, the dominance of the astrological sun, and even the omniscientall-seeing eye that hovered atop the unfinished pyramid.The circumpunct. The symbol of the Source. The origin of all things.This is what Peter had told him moments ago. Mal’akh had been skeptical atfirst, but then he had looked again at the grid, realizing that the image of thepyramid was pointing directly at the lone symbol of the circumpunct—a circlewith a dot in its center. The Masonic Pyramid is a map, he thought, recallingthe legend, which points to the Lost Word. It seemed his father was telling thetruth after all.All great truths are simple.The Lost Word is not a word . . . it is a symbol.Eagerly, Mal’akh had inscribed the great symbol of the circumpunct on his scalp.As he did so, he felt an upwelling of power and satisfaction. My masterpiece andoffering are complete. The forces of darkness were waiting for him now. He wouldbe rewarded for his work. This was to be his moment of glory . . .And yet, at the last instant, everything had gone horribly wrong.Peter was still behind him now, speaking words that Mal’akh could barely fathom.“I lied to you,” he was saying. “You left me no choice. If I had revealed to youthe true Lost Word, you would not have believed me, nor would you haveunderstood.”The Lost Word is . . . not the circumpunct?“The truth is,” said Peter, “the Lost Word is known to all . . . but recognizedby very few.”The words echoed in Mal’akh’s mind.“You remain incomplete,” Peter said, gently placing his palm on top of Mal’akh’shead. “Your work is not yet done. But wherever you are going, please know this .. . you were loved.”For some reason, the gentle touch of his father’s hand felt like it was burningthrough him like a potent catalyst that was initiating a chemical reactioninside Mal’akh’s body. Without warning, he felt a rush of blistering energysurging through his physical shell, as if every cell in his body were nowdissolving.In an instant, all of his worldly pain evaporated.Transformation. It’s happening.I am gazing down upon myself, a wreck of bloody flesh on the sacred slab ofgranite. My father is kneeling behind me, holding my lifeless head with his oneremaining hand.I feel an upwelling of rage . . . and confusion.This is not a moment for compassion . . . it is for revenge, for transformation. . . and yet still my father refuses to submit, refuses to fulfill his role,refuses to channel his pain and anger through the knife blade and into my heart.I am trapped here, hovering . . . tethered to my earthly shell.My father gently runs a soft palm across my face to close my fading eyes.I feel the tether release.A billowing veil materializes around me, thickening and dimming the light,hiding the world from view. Suddenly time accelerates, and I am plunging into anabyss far darker than any I have ever imagined. Here, in the barren void, I heara whispering . . . I sense a gathering force. It strengthens, mounting at astartling rate, surrounding me. Ominous and powerful. Dark and commanding.I am not alone here.This is my triumph, my grand reception. And yet, for some reason, I am fillednot with joy, but rather with boundless fear.It is nothing like I expect.The force is churning now, swirling around me with commanding strength,threatening to tear me apart. Suddenly, without warning, the blackness gathersitself like a great prehistoric beast and rears up before me.I am facing all the dark souls who have gone before.I am screaming in infinite terror . . . as the darkness swallows me whole."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 123Inside the National Cathedral, Dean Galloway sensed a strange change in the air.He was not sure why, but he felt as if a ghostly shadow had evaporated . . . asif a weight had been lifted . . . far away and yet right here.Alone at his desk, he was deep in thought. He was not sure how many minutes hadpassed when his phone rang. It was Warren Bellamy.“Peter’s alive,” his Masonic brother said. “I just heard the news. I knew you’dwant to know immediately. He’s going to be okay.”“Thank God.” Galloway exhaled. “Where is he?”Galloway listened as Bellamy recounted the extraordinary tale of what hadtranspired after they had left Cathedral College.“But all of you are okay?”“Recuperating, yes,” Bellamy said. “There is one thing, though.” He paused.“Yes?”“The Masonic Pyramid . . . I think Langdon may have solved it.”Galloway had to smile. Somehow he was not surprised. “And tell me, did Langdondiscover whether or not the pyramid kept its promise? Whether or not it revealedwhat legend always claimed it would reveal?”“I don’t know yet.”It will, Galloway thought. “You need to rest.”“As do you.”No, I need to pray."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 124When the elevator door opened, the lights in the Temple Room were all ablaze.Katherine Solomon’s legs still felt rubbery as she hurried in to find herbrother. The air in this enormous chamber was cold and smelled of incense. Thescene that greeted her stopped her in her tracks.In the center of this magnificent room, on a low stone altar, lay a bloody,tattooed corpse, a body perforated by spears of broken glass. High above, agaping hole in the ceiling opened to the heavens.My God. Katherine immediately looked away, her eyes scanning for Peter. Shefound her brother sitting on the other side of the room, being tended to by amedic while talking with Langdon and Director Sato.“Peter!” Katherine called, running over. “Peter!”Her brother glanced up, his expression filling with relief. He was on his feetat once, moving toward her. He was wearing a simple white shirt and dark slacks,which someone had probably gotten for him from his office downstairs. His rightarm was in a sling, and their gentle embrace was awkward, but Katherine barelynoticed. A familiar comfort surrounded her like a cocoon, as it always had, evenin childhood, when her protective older brother embraced her.They held each other in silence.Finally Katherine whispered, “Are you okay? I mean . . . really?” She releasedhim, looking down at the sling and bandage where his right hand used to be.Tears welled again in her eyes. “I’m so . . . so sorry.”Peter shrugged as if it were nothing of consequence. “Mortal flesh. Bodies don’tlast forever. The important thing is that you’re okay.”Peter’s lighthearted response tore at her emotions, reminding her of all thereasons she loved him. She stroked his head, feeling the unbreakable bonds offamily . . . the shared blood that flowed in their veins.Tragically, she knew there was a third Solomon in the room tonight. The corpseon the altar drew her gaze, and Katherine shuddered deeply, trying to block outthe photos she had seen.She looked away, her eyes now finding Robert Langdon’s. There was compassionthere, deep and perceptive, as if Langdon somehow knew exactly what she wasthinking. Peter knows. Raw emotion gripped Katherine—relief, sympathy, despair.She felt her brother’s body begin trembling like a child’s. It was something shehad never witnessed in her entire life.“Just let it go,” she whispered. “It’s okay. Just let it go.”Peter’s trembling grew deeper.She held him again, stroking the back of his head. “Peter, you’ve always beenthe strong one . . . you’ve always been there for me. But I’m here for you now.It’s okay. I’m right here.”Katherine eased his head gently onto her shoulder . . . and the great PeterSolomon collapsed sobbing in her arms.Director Sato stepped away to take an incoming call.It was Nola Kaye. Her news, for a change, was good.“Still no signs of distribution, ma’am.” She sounded hopeful. “I’m confident wewould have seen something by now. It looks like you contained it.”Thanks to you, Nola, Sato thought, glancing down at the laptop, which Langdonhad seen complete its transmission. A very close call.At Nola’s suggestion, the agent searching the mansion had checked the garbagecans, discovering packaging for a newly purchased cellular modem. With the exactmodel number, Nola had been able to cross-reference compatible carriers,bandwidths, and service grids, isolating the laptop’s most likely access node—asmall transmitter on the corner of Sixteenth and Corcoran—three blocks from theTemple.Nola quickly relayed the information to Sato in the helicopter. On approachtoward the House of the Temple, the pilot had performed a low-altitude flyoverand pulsed the relay node with a blast of electromagnetic radiation, knocking itoff-line only seconds before the laptop completed its transfer.“Great work tonight,” Sato said. “Now get some sleep. You’ve earned it.”“Thank you, ma’am.” Nola hesitated.“Was there something else?”Nola was silent a long moment, apparently considering whether or not to speak.“Nothing that can’t wait till morning, ma’am. Have a good night.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 125In the silence of an elegant bathroom on the ground floor of the House of theTemple, Robert Langdon ran warm water into a tile sink and eyed himself in themirror. Even in the muted light, he looked like he felt . . . utterly spent.His daybag was on his shoulder again, much lighter now . . . empty except forhis personal items and some crumpled lecture notes. He had to chuckle. His visitto D.C. tonight to give a lecture had turned out a bit more grueling than he’danticipated.Even so, Langdon had a lot to be grateful for.Peter is alive.And the video was contained.As Langdon scooped handfuls of warm water onto his face, he gradually felthimself coming back to life. Everything was still a blur, but the adrenaline inhis body was finally dissipating . . . and he was feeling like himself again.After drying his hands, he checked his Mickey Mouse watch.My God, it’s late.Langdon exited the bathroom and wound his way along the curved wall of the Hallof Honor—a gracefully arched passageway, lined with portraits of accomplishedMasons . . . U.S. presidents, philanthropists, luminaries, and other influentialAmericans. He paused at an oil painting of Harry S. Truman and tried to imaginethe man undergoing the rites, rituals, and studies required to become a Mason.There is a hidden world behind the one we all see. For all of us.“You slipped away,” a voice said down the hall.Langdon turned.It was Katherine. She’d been through hell tonight, and yet she looked suddenlyradiant . . . rejuvenated somehow.Langdon gave a tired smile. “How’s he doing?”Katherine walked up and embraced him warmly. “How can I ever thank you?”He laughed. “You know I didn’t do anything, right?”Katherine held him for a long time. “Peter’s going to be fine . . .” She let goand looked deep into Langdon’s eyes. “And he just told me something incredible .. . something wonderful.” Her voice trembled with anticipation. “I need to gosee it for myself. I’ll be back in a bit.”“What? Where are you going?”“I won’t be long. Right now, Peter wants to speak with you . . . alone. He’swaiting in the library.”“Did he say why?”Katherine chuckled and shook her head. “You know Peter and his secrets.”“But—”“I’ll see you in a bit.”Then she was gone.Langdon sighed heavily. He felt like he’d had enough secrets for one night.There were unanswered questions, of course—the Masonic Pyramid and the Lost Wordamong them—but he sensed that the answers, if they even existed, were not forhim. Not as a non-Mason.Mustering the last of his energy, Langdon made his way to the Masonic library.When he arrived, Peter was sitting all alone at a table with the stone pyramidbefore him.“Robert?” Peter smiled and waved him in. “I’d like a word.”Langdon managed a grin. “Yes, I hear you lost one.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 126The library in the House of the Temple was D.C.’s oldest public reading room.Its elegant stacks burgeoned with over a quarter of a million volumes, includinga rare copy of the Ahiman Rezon, The Secrets of a Prepared Brother. In addition,the library displayed precious Masonic jewels, ritual artifacts, and even a rarevolume that had been hand-printed by Benjamin Franklin.Langdon’s favorite library treasure, however, was one few ever noticed.The illusion.Solomon had shown him long ago that from the proper vantage point, the library’sreading desk and golden table lamp created an unmistakable optical illusion . .. that of a pyramid and shining golden capstone. Solomon said he alwaysconsidered the illusion a silent reminder that the mysteries of Freemasonry wereperfectly visible to anyone and everyone if they were seen from the properperspective.Tonight, however, the mysteries of Freemasonry had materialized front andcenter. Langdon now sat opposite the Worshipful Master Peter Solomon and theMasonic Pyramid.Peter was smiling. “The ‘word’ you refer to, Robert, is not a legend. It is areality.”Langdon stared across the table and finally spoke. “But . . . I don’tunderstand. How is that possible?”“What is so difficult to accept?”All of it! Langdon wanted to say, searching his old friend’s eyes for any hintof common sense. “You’re saying you believe the Lost Word is real . . . and thatit has actual power?”“Enormous power,” Peter said. “It has the power to transform human kind byunlocking the Ancient Mysteries.”“A word?” Langdon challenged. “Peter, I can’t possibly believe a word—”“You will believe,” Peter stated calmly.Langdon stared in silence.“As you know,” Solomon continued, standing now and pacing around the table, “ithas long been prophesied that there will come a day when the Lost Word will berediscovered . . . a day when it will be unearthed . . . and mankind will onceagain have access to its forgotten power.”Langdon flashed on Peter’s lecture about the Apocalypse. Although many peopleerroneously interpreted apocalypse as a cataclysmic end of the world, the wordliterally signified an “unveiling,” predicted by the ancients to be that ofgreat wisdom. The coming age of enlightenment. Even so, Langdon could notimagine such a vast change being ushered in by . . . a word.Peter motioned to the stone pyramid, which sat on the table beside its goldencapstone. “The Masonic Pyramid,” he said. “The legendary symbolon. Tonight itstands unified . . . and complete.” Reverently, he lifted the golden capstoneand set it atop the pyramid. The heavy gold piece clicked softly into place.“Tonight, my friend, you have done what has never been done before. You haveassembled the Masonic Pyramid, deciphered all of its codes, and in the end,unveiled . . . this.”Solomon produced a sheet of paper and laid it on the table. Langdon recognizedthe grid of symbols that had been reorganized using the Order Eight FranklinSquare. He had studied it briefly in the Temple Room.Peter said, “I am curious to know if you can read this array of symbols. Afterall, you are the specialist.”Langdon eyed the grid.Heredom, circumpunct, pyramid, staircase . . .image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_027_r1.jpg]Langdon sighed. “Well, Peter, as you can probably see, this is an allegoricalpictogram. Clearly its language is metaphorical and symbolic rather thanliteral.”Solomon chuckled. “Ask a symbologist a simple question . . . Okay, tell me whatyou see.”Peter really wants to hear this? Langdon pulled the page toward him. “Well, Ilooked at it earlier, and, in simple terms, I see that this grid is a picture .. . depicting heaven and earth.”Peter arched his eyebrows, looking surprised. “Oh?”“Sure. At the top of the image, we have the word Heredom—the ‘Holy House’—whichI interpret as the House of God . . . or heaven.”“Okay.”“The downward-facing arrow after Heredom signifies that the rest of thepictogram clearly lies in the realm beneath heaven . . . that being . . .earth.” Langdon’s eyes glided now to the bottom of the grid. “The lowest tworows, those beneath the pyramid, represent the earth itself—terra firma—thelowest of all the realms. Fittingly, these lower realms contain the twelveancient astrological signs, which represent the primordial religion of thosefirst human souls who looked to the heavens and saw the hand of God in themovement of the stars and planets.”Solomon slid his chair closer and studied the grid. “Okay, what else?”“On a foundation of astrology,” Langdon continued, “the great pyramid rises fromthe earth . . . stretching toward heaven . . . the enduring symbol of lostwisdom. It is filled with history’s great philosophies and religions . . .Egyptian, Pythagorean, Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Judeo-Christian, and on and on. . . all flowing upward, merging together, funneling themselves up through thetransformative gateway of the pyramid . . . where they finally fuse into asingle, unified human philosophy.” He paused. “A single universal consciousness. . . a shared global vision of God . . . represented by the ancient symbol thathovers over the capstone.”“The circumpunct,” Peter said. “A universal symbol for God.”“Right. Throughout history, the circumpunct has been all things to all people—itis the sun god Ra, alchemical gold, the all-seeing eye, the singularity pointbefore the Big Bang, the—”“The Great Architect of the Universe.”Langdon nodded, sensing this was probably the same argument Peter had used inthe Temple Room to sell the idea of the circumpunct as the Lost Word.“And finally?” Peter asked. “What about the staircase?”Langdon glanced down at the image of the stairs beneath the pyramid. “Peter, I’msure you know as well as anyone, this symbolizes the Winding Staircase ofFreemasonry . . . leading upward out of the earthly darkness into the light . .. like Jacob’s ladder climbing to heaven . . . or the tiered human spine thatconnects man’s mortal body to his eternal mind.” He paused. “As for the rest ofthe symbols, they appear to be a blend of celestial, Masonic, and scientific,all lending support to the Ancient Mysteries.”Solomon stroked his chin. “An elegant interpretation, Professor. I agree, ofcourse, that this grid can be read as allegory, and yet . . .” His eyes flashedwith deepening mystery. “This collection of symbols tells another story as well.A story that is far more revealing.”“Oh?”Solomon began pacing again, circling the table. “Earlier tonight, inside theTemple Room, when I believed I was going to die, I looked at this grid, andsomehow I saw past the metaphor, past the allegory, into the very heart of whatthese symbols are telling us.” He paused, turning abruptly to Langdon. “Thisgrid reveals the exact location where the Lost Word is buried.”“Come again?” Langdon shifted uneasily in his chair, suddenly fearing that thetrauma of the evening had left Peter disorientated and confused.“Robert, legend has always described the Masonic Pyramid as a map—a veryspecific map—a map that could guide the worthy to the secret location of theLost Word.” Solomon tapped the grid of symbols in front of Langdon. “I guaranteeyou, these symbols are exactly what legend says they are . . . a map. A specificdiagram that reveals exactly where we will find the staircase that leads down tothe Lost Word.”Langdon gave an uneasy laugh, treading carefully now. “Even if I believed theLegend of the Masonic Pyramid, this grid of symbols can’t possibly be a map.Look at it. It looks nothing like a map.”Solomon smiled. “Sometimes all it takes is a tiny shift of perspective to seesomething familiar in a totally new light.”Langdon looked again but saw nothing new.“Let me ask you a question,” Peter said. “When Masons lay cornerstones, do youknow why we lay them in the northeast corner of a building?”“Sure, because the northeast corner receives the first rays of morning light. Itis symbolic of the power of architecture to climb out of the earth into thelight.”“Right,” Peter said. “So perhaps you should look there for the first rays oflight.” He motioned to the grid. “In the northeast corner.”Langdon returned his eyes to the page, moving his gaze to the upper right ornortheast corner. The symbol in that corner was ↓.“A downward-pointing arrow,” Langdon said, trying to grasp Solomon’s point.“Which means . . . beneath Heredom.”“No, Robert, not beneath,” Solomon replied. “Think. This grid is not ametaphorical maze. It’s a map. And on a map, a directional arrow that pointsdown means—”“South,” Langdon exclaimed, startled.“Exactly!” Solomon replied, grinning now with excitement. “Due south! On a map,down is south. Moreover, on a map, the word Heredom would not be a metaphor forheaven, it would be the name of a geographic location.”“The House of the Temple? You’re saying this map is pointing . . . due south ofthis building?”“Praise God!” Solomon said, laughing. “Light dawns at last.”Langdon studied the grid. “But, Peter . . . even if you’re right, due south ofthis building could be anywhere on a longitude that’s over twenty-four thousandmiles long.”“No, Robert. You are ignoring the legend, which claims the Lost Word is buriedin D.C. That shortens the line substantially. In addition, legend also claimsthat a large stone sits atop the opening of the staircase . . . and that thisstone is engraved with a message in an ancient language . . . as a kind ofmarker so the worthy can find it.”Langdon was having trouble taking any of this seriously, and while he didn’tknow D.C. well enough to picture what was due south of their current location,he was pretty certain there was no huge engraved stone atop a buried staircase.“The message inscribed on the stone,” Peter said, “is right here before oureyes.” He tapped the third row of the grid before Langdon. “This is theinscription, Robert! You’ve solved the puzzle!”Dumbfounded, Langdon studied the seven symbols.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_028_r1.jpg]Solved? Langdon had no idea whatsoever what these seven disparate symbols couldpossibly mean, and he was damned sure they were not engraved anywhere in thenation’s capital . . . particularly on a giant stone over a staircase.“Peter,” he said, “I don’t see how this sheds any light at all. I know of nostone in D.C. engraved with this . . . message.”Solomon patted him on the shoulder. “You have walked past it and never seen it.We all have. It is sitting in plain view, like the mysteries themselves. Andtonight, when I saw these seven symbols, I realized in an instant that thelegend was true. The Lost Word is buried in D.C. . . . and it does rest at thebottom of a long staircase beneath an enormous engraved stone.”Mystified, Langdon remained silent.“Robert, tonight I believe you have earned the right to know the truth.”Langdon stared at Peter, trying to process what he had just heard. “You’re goingto tell me where the Lost Word is buried?”“No,” Solomon said, standing up with a smile. “I’m going to show you.”Five minutes later, Langdon was buckling himself into the backseat of theEscalade beside Peter Solomon. Simkins climbed in behind the wheel as Satoapproached across the parking lot.“Mr. Solomon?” the director said, lighting a cigarette as she arrived. “I’vejust made the call you requested.”“And?” Peter asked through his open window.“I ordered them to give you access. Briefly.”“Thank you.”Sato studied him, looking curious. “I must say, it’s a most unusual request.”Solomon gave an enigmatic shrug.Sato let it go, circling around to Langdon’s window and rapping with herknuckles.Langdon lowered the window.“Professor,” she said, with no hint of warmth. “Your assistance tonight, whilereluctant, was critical to our success . . . and for that, I thank you.” Shetook a long drag on her cigarette and blew it sideways. “However, one final bitof advice. The next time a senior administrator of the CIA tells you she has anational-security crisis . . .” Her eyes flashed black. “Leave the bullshit inCambridge.”Langdon opened his mouth to speak, but Director Inoue Sato had already turnedand was headed off across the parking lot toward a waiting helicopter.Simkins glanced over his shoulder, stone-faced. “Are you gentlemen ready?”“Actually,” Solomon said, “just one moment.” He produced a small, folded pieceof dark fabric and handed it to Langdon. “Robert, I’d like you to put this onbefore we go anywhere.”Puzzled, Langdon examined the cloth. It was black velvet. As he unfolded it, herealized he was holding a Masonic hoodwink—the traditional blindfold of afirst-degree initiate. What the hell?Peter said, “I’d prefer you not see where we’re going.”Langdon turned to Peter. “You want to blindfold me for the journey?”Solomon grinned. “My secret. My rules.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 127The breeze felt cold outside CIA headquarters in Langley. Nola Kaye wasshivering as she followed sys-sec Rick Parrish across the agency’s moonlitcentral courtyard.Where is Rick taking me?The crisis of the Masonic video had been averted, thank God, but Nola still feltuneasy. The redacted file on the CIA director’s partition remained a mystery,and it was nagging at her. She and Sato would debrief in the morning, and Nolawanted all the facts. Finally, she had called Rick Parrish and demanded hishelp.Now, as she followed Rick to some unknown location outside, Nola could not pushthe bizarre phrases from her memory:Secret location underground where the . . . somewhere in Washington, D.C., thecoordinates . . . uncovered an ancient portal that led . . . warning the pyramidholds dangerous . . . decipher this engraved symbolon to unveil . . .“You and I agree,” Parrish said as they walked, “that the hacker who spideredthose keywords was definitely searching for information about the MasonicPyramid.”Obviously, Nola thought.“It turns out, though, the hacker stumbled onto a facet of the Masonic mystery Idon’t think he expected.”“What do you mean?”“Nola, you know how the CIA director sponsors an internal discussion forum forAgency employees to share their ideas about all kinds of things?”“Of course.” The forums provided Agency personnel a safe place to chat onlineabout various topics and gave the director a kind of virtual gateway to hisstaff.“The director’s forums are hosted on his private partition, and yet in order toprovide access to employees of all clearance levels, they’re located outside thedirector’s classified firewall.”“What are you getting at?” she demanded as they rounded a corner near the Agencycafeteria.“In a word . . .” Parrish pointed into the darkness. “That.”Nola glanced up. Across the plaza in front of them was a massive metal sculptureglimmering in the moonlight.In an agency that boasted over five hundred pieces of original art, thissculpture—titled Kryptos—was by far the most famous. Greek for “hidden,” Kryptoswas the work of American artist James Sanborn and had become something of alegend here at the CIA.The work consisted of a massive S-shaped panel of copper, set on its edge like acurling metal wall. Engraved into the expansive surface of the wall were nearlytwo thousand letters . . . organized into a baffling code. As if this were notenigmatic enough, positioned carefully in the area around the encrypted S-wallwere numerous other sculptural elements—granite slabs at odd angles, a compassrose, a magnetic lodestone, and even a message in Morse code that referenced“lucid memory” and “shadow forces.” Most fans believed that these pieces wereclues that would reveal how to decipher the sculpture.Kryptos was art . . . but it was also an enigma.Attempting to decipher its encoded secret had become an obsession forcryptologists both inside and outside the CIA. Finally, a few years back, aportion of the code had been broken, and it became national news. Although muchof Kryptos’s code remained unsolved to this day, the sections that had beendeciphered were so bizarre that they made the sculpture only more mysterious. Itreferenced secret underground locations, portals that led into ancient tombs,longitudes and latitudes . . .Nola could still recall bits and pieces of the deciphered sections: Theinformation was gathered and transmitted underground to an unknown location . .. It was totally invisible . . . hows that possible . . . they used the earthsmagnetic field . . .Nola had never paid much attention to the sculpture or cared if it was everfully deciphered. At the moment, however, she wanted answers. “Why are youshowing me Kryptos?”Parrish gave her a conspiratorial smile and dramatically extracted a foldedsheet of paper from his pocket. “Voilà, the mysterious redacted document youwere so concerned about. I accessed the complete text.”Nola jumped. “You snooped the director’s classified partition?”“No. That’s what I was getting at earlier. Have a look.” He handed her the file.Nola seized the page and unfolded it. When she saw the standard Agency headersat the top of the page, she cocked her head in surprise.This document was not classified. Not even close.EMPLOYEE DISCUSSION BOARD: KRYPTOSCOMPRESSED STORAGE: THREAD #2456282.5Nola found herself looking at a series of postings that had been compressed intoa single page for more efficient storage.“Your keyword document,” Rick said, “is some cipher-punks rambling aboutKryptos.”Nola scanned down the document until she spotted a sentence containing afamiliar set of keywords.Jim, the sculpture says it was transmitted to a secret location UNDERGROUNDwhere the info was hidden.“This text is from the director’s online Kryptos forum,” Rick explained. “Theforum’s been going for years. There are literally thousands of postings. I’m notsurprised one of them happened to contain all the keywords.”Nola kept scanning down until she spotted another posting containing keywords.Even though Mark said the code’s lat/long headings point somewhere inWASHINGTON, D.C., the coordinates he used were off by one degree--Kryptosbasically points back to itself.Parrish walked over to the statue and ran his palm across the cryptic sea ofletters. “A lot of this code has yet to be deciphered, and there are plenty ofpeople who think the message might actually relate to ancient Masonic secrets.”Nola now recalled murmurs of a Masonic/Kryptos link, but she tended to ignorethe lunatic fringe. Then again, looking around at the various pieces of thesculpture arranged around the plaza, she realized that it was a code in pieces—asymbolon—just like the Masonic Pyramid.Odd.For a moment, Nola could almost see Kryptos as a modern Masonic Pyramid—a codein many pieces, made of different materials, each playing a role. “Do you thinkthere’s any way Kryptos and the Masonic Pyramid might be hiding the samesecret?”“Who knows?” Parrish shot Kryptos a frustrated look. “I doubt we’ll ever knowthe whole message. That is, unless someone can convince the director to unlockhis safe and sneak a peek at the solution.”Nola nodded. It was all coming back to her now. When Kryptos was installed, itarrived with a sealed envelope containing a complete decryption of thesculpture’s codes. The sealed solution was entrusted to then–CIA directorWilliam Webster, who locked it in his office safe. The document was allegedlystill there, having been transferred from director to director over the years.Strangely, Nola’s thoughts of William Webster sparked her memory, bringing backyet another portion of Kryptos’s deciphered text:IT’S BURIED OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.WHO KNOWS THE EXACT LOCATION?ONLY WW.Although nobody knew exactly what was buried out there, most people believed theWW was a reference to William Webster. Nola had heard whispers once that itreferred in fact to a man named William Whiston—a Royal Societytheologian—although she had never bothered to give it much thought.Rick was talking again. “I’ve got to admit, I’m not really into artists, but Ithink this guy Sanborn’s a serious genius. I was just looking online at hisCyrillic Projector project? It shines giant Russian letters from a KGB documenton mind control. Freaky.”Nola was no longer listening. She was examining the paper, where she had foundthe third key phrase in another posting.Right, that whole section is verbatim from some famous archaeologist’s diary,telling about the moment he dug down and uncovered an ANCIENT PORTAL that led tothe tomb of Tutankhamen.The archaeologist who was quoted on Kryptos, Nola knew, was in fact famedEgyptologist Howard Carter. The next posting referenced him by name.I just skimmed the rest of Carter’s field notes online, and it sounds like hefound a clay tablet warning the PYRAMID holds dangerous consequences for anyonewho disturbs the peace of the pharaoh. A curse! Should we be worried? :)Nola scowled. “Rick, for God’s sake, this idiot’s pyramid reference isn’t evenright. Tutankhamen wasn’t buried in a pyramid. He was buried in the Valley ofthe Kings. Don’t cryptologists watch the Discovery Channel?”Parrish shrugged. “Techies.”Nola now saw the final key phrase.Guys, you know I’m not a conspiracy theorist, but Jim and Dave had betterdecipher this ENGRAVED SYMBOLON to unveil its final secret before the world endsin 2012 . . . Ciao.“Anyhow,” Parrish said, “I figured you’d want to know about the Kryptos forumbefore you accused the CIA director of harboring classified documentation aboutan ancient Masonic legend. Somehow, I doubt a man as powerful as the CIAdirector has time for that sort of thing.”Nola pictured the Masonic video and its images of all the influential menparticipating in an ancient rite. If Rick had any idea . . .In the end, she knew, whatever Kryptos ultimately revealed, the messagedefinitely had mystical undertones. She gazed up at the gleaming piece of art—athree-dimensional code standing silently at the heart of one of the nation’spremier intelligence agencies—and she wondered if it would ever give up itsfinal secret.As she and Rick headed back inside, Nola had to smile.It’s buried out there somewhere."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 128This is crazy.Blindfolded, Robert Langdon could see nothing as the Escalade sped southwardalong the deserted streets. On the seat beside him, Peter Solomon remainedsilent.Where is he taking me?Langdon’s curiosity was a mix of intrigue and apprehension, his imagination inoverdrive as it tried desperately to put the pieces together. Peter had notwavered from his claim. The Lost Word? Buried at the bottom of a staircasethat’s covered by a massive, engraved stone? It all seemed impossible.The stone’s alleged engraving was still lodged in Langdon’s memory . . . and yetthe seven symbols, as far as he could tell, made no sense together at all.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_028_r1.jpg]The Stonemason’s Square: the symbol of honesty and being “true.”The letters Au: the scientific abbreviation for the element gold.The Sigma: the Greek letter S, the mathematical symbol for the sum of all parts.The Pyramid: the Egyptian symbol of man reaching heavenward.The Delta: the Greek letter D, the mathematical symbol for change.Mercury: as depicted by its most ancient alchemical symbol.The Ouroboros: the symbol of wholeness and at-one-ment.Solomon still insisted these seven symbols were a “message.” But if this wastrue, then it was a message Langdon had no idea how to read.The Escalade slowed suddenly and turned sharply right, onto a different surface,as if into a driveway or access road. Langdon perked up, listening intently forclues as to their whereabouts. They’d been driving for less than ten minutes,and although Langdon had tried to follow in his mind, he had lost his bearingsquickly. For all he knew, they were now pulling back into the House of theTemple.The Escalade came to a stop, and Langdon heard the window roll down.“Agent Simkins, CIA,” their driver announced. “I believe you’re expecting us.”“Yes, sir,” a sharp military voice replied. “Director Sato phoned ahead. Onemoment while I move the security barricade.”Langdon listened with rising confusion, now sensing they were entering amilitary base. As the car began moving again, along an unusually smooth stretchof pavement, he turned his head blindly toward Solomon. “Where are we, Peter?”he demanded.“Do not remove your blindfold.” Peter’s voice was stern.The vehicle continued a short distance and again slowed to a stop. Simkinskilled the engine. More voices. Military. Someone asked for Simkins’sidentification. The agent got out and spoke to the men in hushed tones.Langdon’s door was suddenly being opened, and powerful hands assisted him out ofthe car. The air felt cold. It was windy.Solomon was beside him. “Robert, just let Agent Simkins lead you inside.”Langdon heard metal keys in a lock . . . and then the creak of a heavy iron doorswinging open. It sounded like an ancient bulkhead. Where the hell are theytaking me?!Simkins’s hands guided Langdon in the direction of the metal door. They steppedover a threshold. “Straight ahead, Professor.”It was suddenly quiet. Dead. Deserted. The air inside smelled sterile andprocessed.Simkins and Solomon flanked Langdon now, guiding him blindly down areverberating corridor. The floor felt like stone beneath his loafers.Behind them, the metal door slammed loudly, and Langdon jumped. The locksturned. He was sweating now beneath his blindfold. He wanted only to tear itoff.They stopped walking now.Simkins let go of Langdon’s arm, and there was a series of electronic beepsfollowed by an unexpected rumble in front of them, which Langdon imagined had tobe a security door sliding open automatically.“Mr. Solomon, you and Mr. Langdon continue on alone. I’ll wait for you here,”Simkins said. “Take my flashlight.”“Thank you,” Solomon said. “We won’t be long.”Flashlight?! Langdon’s heart was pounding wildly now.Peter took Langdon’s arm in his own and inched forward. “Walk with me, Robert.”They moved slowly together across another threshold, and the security doorrumbled shut behind them.Peter stopped short. “Is something wrong?”Langdon was suddenly feeling queasy and off balance. “I think I just need totake off this blindfold.”“Not yet, we’re almost there.”“Almost where?” Langdon felt a growing heaviness in the pit of his stomach.“I told you—I’m taking you to see the staircase that descends to the Lost Word.”“Peter, this isn’t funny!”“It’s not meant to be. It’s meant to open your mind, Robert. It’s meant toremind you that there are mysteries in this world that even you have yet to layeyes upon. And before I take one more step with you, I want you to do somethingfor me. I want you to believe . . . just for an instant . . . believe in thelegend. Believe that you are about to peer down a winding staircase that plungeshundreds of feet to one of humankind’s greatest lost treasures.”Langdon felt dizzy. As much as he wanted to believe his dear friend, he couldnot. “Is it much farther?” His velvet hoodwink was drenched in sweat.“No. Only a few more steps, actually. Through one last door. I’ll open it now.”Solomon let go of him for a moment, and as he did so, Langdon swayed, feelinglight-headed. Unsteady, he reached out for stability, and Peter was quickly backat his side. The sound of a heavy automatic door rumbled in front of them. Petertook Langdon’s arm and they moved forward again.“This way.”They inched across another threshold, and the door slid closed behind them.Silence. Cold.Langdon immediately sensed that this place, whatever it was, had nothing to dowith the world on the other side of the security doors. The air was dank andchilly, like a tomb. The acoustics felt dull and cramped. He felt an irrationalbout of claustrophobia settling in.“A few more steps.” Solomon guided him blindly around a corner and positionedhim precisely. Finally, he said, “Take off your blindfold.”Langdon seized the velvet hoodwink and tore it from his face. He looked allaround to find out where he was, but he was still blind. He rubbed his eyes.Nothing. “Peter, it’s pitch-black!”“Yes, I know. Reach in front of you. There’s a railing. Grasp it.”Langdon groped in the darkness and found an iron railing.“Now watch.” He could hear Peter fumbling with something, and suddenly a blazingflashlight beam pierced the darkness. It was pointed at the floor, and beforeLangdon could take in his surroundings, Solomon directed the flashlight out overthe railing and pointed the beam straight down.Langdon was suddenly staring into a bottomless shaft . . . an endless windingstaircase that plunged deep into the earth. My God! His knees nearly buckled,and he gripped the railing for support. The staircase was a traditional squarespiral, and he could see at least thirty landings descending into the earthbefore the flashlight faded to nothing. I can’t even see the bottom!“Peter . . .” he stammered. “What is this place!”“I’ll take you to the bottom of the staircase in a moment, but before I do, youneed to see something else.”Too overwhelmed to protest, Langdon let Peter guide him away from the stairwelland across the strange little chamber. Peter kept the flashlight trained on theworn stone floor beneath their feet, and Langdon could get no real sense of thespace around them . . . except that it was small.A tiny stone chamber.They arrived quickly at the room’s opposite wall, in which was embedded arectangle of glass. Langdon thought it might be a window into a room beyond, andyet from where he stood, he saw only darkness on the other side.“Go ahead,” Peter said. “Have a look.”“What’s in there?” Langdon flashed for an instant on the Chamber of Reflectionbeneath the Capitol Building, and how he had believed, for a moment, that itmight contain a portal to some giant underground cavern.“Just look, Robert.” Solomon inched him forward. “And brace yourself, becausethe sight will shock you.”Having no idea what to expect, Langdon moved toward the glass. As he neared theportal, Peter turned out the flashlight, plunging the tiny chamber into totaldarkness.As his eyes adjusted, Langdon groped in front of him, his hands finding thewall, finding the glass, his face moving closer to the transparent portal.Still only darkness beyond.He leaned closer . . . pressing his face to the glass.Then he saw it.The wave of shock and disorientation that tore through Langdon’s body reacheddown inside and spun his internal compass upside down. He nearly fell backwardas his mind strained to accept the utterly unanticipated sight that was beforehim. In his wildest dreams, Robert Langdon would never have guessed what lay onthe other side of this glass.The vision was a glorious sight.There in the darkness, a brilliant white light shone like a gleaming jewel.Langdon now understood it all—the barricade on the access road . . . the guardsat the main entrance . . . the heavy metal door outside . . . the automaticdoors that rumbled open and closed . . . the heaviness in his stomach . . . thelightness in his head . . . and now this tiny stone chamber.“Robert,” Peter whispered behind him, “sometimes a change of perspective is allit takes to see the light.”Speechless, Langdon stared out through the window. His gaze traveled into thedarkness of the night, traversing more than a mile of empty space, droppinglower . . . lower . . . through the darkness . . . until it came to rest atopthe brilliantly illuminated, stark white dome of the U.S. Capitol Building.Langdon had never seen the Capitol from this perspective—hovering 555 feet inthe air atop America’s great Egyptian obelisk. Tonight, for the first time inhis life, he had ridden the elevator up to the tiny viewing chamber . . . at thepinnacle of the Washington Monument."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 129Robert Langdon stood mesmerized at the glass portal, absorbing the power of thelandscape below him. Having ascended unknowingly hundreds of feet into the air,he was now admiring one of the most spectacular vistas he had ever seen.The shining dome of the U.S. Capitol rose like a mountain at the east end of theNational Mall. On either side of the building, two parallel lines of lightstretched toward him . . . the illuminated facades of the Smithsonian museums .. . beacons of art, history, science, culture.Langdon now realized to his astonishment that much of what Peter had declared tobe true . . . was in fact true. There is indeed a winding staircase . . .descending hundreds of feet beneath a massive stone. The huge capstone of thisobelisk sat directly over his head, and Langdon now recalled a forgotten bit oftrivia that seemed to have eerie relevance: the capstone of the WashingtonMonument weighed precisely thirty-three hundred pounds.Again, the number 33.More startling, however, was the knowledge that this capstone’s ultimate peak,the zenith of this obelisk, was crowned by a tiny, polished tip of aluminum—ametal as precious as gold in its day. The shining apex of the WashingtonMonument was only about a foot tall, the same size as the Masonic Pyramid.Incredibly, this small metal pyramid bore a famous engraving—Laus Deo— andLangdon suddenly understood. This is the true message of the base of the stonepyramid.image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_028_r1.jpg]The seven symbols are a transliteration!The simplest of ciphers.The symbols are letters.The stonemason’s square—LThe element gold—AUThe Greek Sigma—SThe Greek Delta—DAlchemical mercury—EThe Ouroboros—O“Laus Deo,” Langdon whispered. The well-known Latin phrase—meaning “praiseGod”—was inscribed on the tip of the Washington Monument in script letters onlyone inch tall. On full display . . . and yet invisible to all.Laus Deo.“Praise God,” Peter said behind him, flipping on the soft lighting in thechamber. “The Masonic Pyramid’s final code.”Langdon turned. His friend was grinning broadly, and Langdon recalled that Peterhad actually spoken the words “praise God” earlier inside the Masonic library.And I still missed it.Langdon felt a chill to realize how apt it was that the legendary MasonicPyramid had guided him here . . . to America’s great obelisk—the symbol ofancient mystical wisdom—rising toward the heavens at the heart of a nation.In a state of wonder, Langdon began moving counterclockwise around the perimeterof the tiny square room, arriving now at another viewing window.North.Through this northward-facing window, Langdon gazed down at the familiarsilhouette of the White House directly in front of him. He raised his eyes tothe horizon, where the straight line of Sixteenth Street ran due north towardthe House of the Temple.I am due south of Heredom.He continued around the perimeter to the next window. Looking west, Langdon’seyes traced the long rectangle of the reflecting pool to the Lincoln Memorial,its classical Greek architecture inspired by the Parthenon in Athens, Temple toAthena—goddess of heroic undertakings.Annuit coeptis, Langdon thought. God favors our undertaking.Continuing to the final window, Langdon gazed southward across the dark watersof the Tidal Basin, where the Jefferson Memorial shone brightly in the night.The gently sloping cupola, Langdon knew, was modeled after the Pantheon, theoriginal home to the great Roman gods of mythology.Having looked in all four directions, Langdon now thought about the aerialphotos he had seen of the National Mall—her four arms outstretched from theWashington Monument toward the cardinal points of the compass. I am standing atthe crossroads of America.Langdon continued back around to where Peter was standing. His mentor wasbeaming. “Well, Robert, this is it. The Lost Word. This is where it’s buried.The Masonic Pyramid led us here.”Langdon did a double take. He had all but forgotten about the Lost Word.“Robert, I know of nobody more trustworthy than you. And after a night liketonight, I believe you deserve to know what this is all about. As promised inlegend, the Lost Word is indeed buried at the bottom of a winding staircase.” Hemotioned to the mouth of the monument’s long stairwell.Langdon had finally started to get his feet back under him, but now he waspuzzled.Peter quickly reached into his pocket and pulled out a small object. “Do youremember this?”Langdon took the cube-shaped box that Peter had entrusted to him long ago. “Yes. . . but I’m afraid I didn’t do a very good job of protecting it.”Solomon chuckled. “Perhaps the time had come for it to see the light of day.”Langdon eyed the stone cube, wondering why Peter had just handed it to him.“What does this look like to you?” Peter asked.Langdon eyed the 1514 image [images/Brow_9780385533133_epub_015_r1.jpg] andrecalled his first impression when Katherine had unwrapped the package. “Acornerstone.”“Exactly,” Peter replied. “Now, there are a few things you might not know aboutcornerstones. First, the concept of laying a cornerstone comes from the OldTestament.”Langdon nodded. “The Book of Psalms.”“Correct. And a true cornerstone is always buried beneath the ground—symbolizingthe building’s initial step upward out of the earth toward the heavenly light.”Langdon glanced out at the Capitol, recalling that its cornerstone was buried sodeep in the foundation that, to this day, excavations had been unable to findit.“And finally,” Solomon said, “like the stone box in your hand, many cornerstonesare little vaults . . . and have hollow cavities so that they can hold buriedtreasures . . . talismans, if you will—symbols of hope for the future of thebuilding about to be erected.”Langdon was well aware of this tradition, too. Even today, Masons laidcornerstones in which they sealed meaningful objects—time capsules, photos,proclamations, even the ashes of important people.“My purpose in telling you this,” Solomon said, glancing over at the stairwell,“should be clear.”“You think the Lost Word is buried in the cornerstone of the WashingtonMonument?”“I don’t think, Robert. I know. The Lost Word was buried in the cornerstone ofthis monument on July 4, 1848, in a full Masonic ritual.”Langdon stared at him. “Our Masonic forefathers buried a word?!”Peter nodded. “They did indeed. They understood the true power of what they wereburying.”All night, Langdon had been trying to wrap his mind around sprawling, etherealconcepts . . . the Ancient Mysteries, the Lost Word, the Secrets of the Ages. Hewanted something solid, and despite Peter’s claims that the key to it all wasburied in a cornerstone 555 feet beneath him, Langdon was having a hard timeaccepting it. People study the mysteries for entire lifetimes and are stillunable to access the power allegedly hidden there. Langdon flashed on Dürer’sMelencolia I—the image of the dejected Adept, surrounded by the tools of hisfailed efforts to unveil the mystical secrets of alchemy. If the secrets canactually be unlocked, they will not be found in one place!Any answer, Langdon had always believed, was spread across the world inthousands of volumes . . . encoded into writings of Pythagoras, Hermes,Heraclitus, Paracelsus, and hundreds of others. The answer was found in dusty,forgotten tomes on alchemy, mysticism, magic, and philosophy. The answer washidden in the ancient library of Alexandria, the clay tablets of Sumer, and thehieroglyphs of Egypt.“Peter, I’m sorry,” Langdon said quietly, shaking his head. “To understand theAncient Mysteries is a lifelong process. I can’t imagine how the key couldpossibly rest within a single word.”Peter placed a hand on Langdon’s shoulder. “Robert, the Lost Word is not a‘word.’” He gave a sage smile. “We only call it the ‘Word’ because that’s whatthe ancients called it . . . in the beginning.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 130In the beginning was the Word.Dean Galloway knelt at the Great Crossing of the National Cathedral and prayedfor America. He prayed that his beloved country would soon come to grasp thetrue power of the Word—the recorded collection of the written wisdom of all theancient masters—the spiritual truths taught by the great sages.History had blessed mankind with the wisest of teachers, profoundly enlightenedsouls whose understanding of the spiritual and mental mysteries exceeded allunderstanding. The precious words of these Adepts—Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad,Zoroaster, and countless others—had been transmitted through history in theoldest and most precious of vessels.Books.Every culture on earth had its own sacred book—its own Word—each one differentand yet each one the same. For Christians, the Word was the Bible, for Muslimsthe Koran, for Jews the Torah, for Hindus the Vedas, and on and on it went.The Word shall light the way.For America’s Masonic forefathers, the Word had been the Bible. And yet fewpeople in history have understood its true message.Tonight, as Galloway knelt alone within the great cathedral, he placed his handsupon the Word—a well-worn copy of his own Masonic Bible. This treasured book,like all Masonic Bibles, contained the Old Testament, the New Testament, and atreasure trove of Masonic philosophical writings.Although Galloway’s eyes could no longer read the text, he knew the preface byheart. Its glorious message had been read by millions of his brethren incountless languages around the world.The text read:TIME IS A RIVER . . . AND BOOKS ARE BOATS. MANY VOLUMES START DOWN THAT STREAM,ONLY TO BE WRECKED AND LOST BEYOND RECALL IN ITS SANDS. ONLY A FEW, A VERY FEW,ENDURE THE TESTINGS OF TIME AND LIVE TO BLESS THE AGES FOLLOWING.There is a reason these volumes survived, while others vanished. As a scholar offaith, Dean Galloway had always found it astonishing that the ancient spiritualtexts—the most studied books on earth—were, in fact, the least understood.Concealed within those pages, there hides a wondrous secret.One day soon the light would dawn, and mankind would finally begin to grasp thesimple, transformative truth of the ancient teachings . . . and take a quantumleap forward in understanding his own magnificent nature."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 131The winding staircase that descends the spine of the Washington Monumentconsists of 896 stone steps that spiral around an open elevator shaft. Langdonand Solomon were making their way down, Langdon still grappling with thestartling fact that Peter had shared with him only moments ago: Robert, buriedwithin the hollow cornerstone of this monument, our forefathers placed a singlecopy of the Word—the Bible—which waits in darkness at the foot of thisstaircase.As they descended, Peter suddenly stopped on a landing and swung his flashlightbeam to illuminate a large stone medallion embedded in the wall.What in the world?! Langdon jumped when he saw the carving.The medallion depicted a frightening cloaked figure holding a scythe andkneeling beside an hourglass. The figure’s arm was raised, and his index fingerwas extended, pointing directly at a large open Bible, as if to say: “The answeris in there!”Langdon stared at the carving and then turned to Peter.His mentor’s eyes shone with mystery. “I’d like you to consider something,Robert.” His voice echoed down the empty stairwell. “Why do you think the Biblehas survived thousands of years of tumultuous history? Why is it still here? Isit because its stories are such compelling reading? Of course not . . . butthere is a reason. There is a reason Christian monks spend lifetimes attemptingto decipher the Bible. There is a reason that Jewish mystics and Kabbalists poreover the Old Testament. And that reason, Robert, is that there exist powerfulsecrets hidden in the pages of this ancient book . . . a vast collection ofuntapped wisdom waiting to be unveiled.”Langdon was no stranger to the theory that the Scriptures contained a hiddenlayer of meaning, a concealed message that was veiled in allegory, symbolism,and parable.“The prophets warn us,” Peter continued, “that the language used to share theirsecret mysteries is a cryptic one. The Gospel of Mark tells us, ‘Unto you isgiven to know the mystery . . . but it will be told in parable.’ Proverbscautions that the sayings of the wise are ‘riddles,’ while Corinthians talks of‘hidden wisdom.’ The Gospel of John forewarns: ‘I will speak to you in parable .. . and use dark sayings.’ ”Dark sayings, Langdon mused, knowing this strange phrase made numerous oddappearances in Proverbs as well as in Psalm 78. I will open my mouth in aparable and utter dark sayings of old. The concept of a “dark saying,” Langdonhad learned, did not mean that the saying was “evil” but rather that its truemeaning was shadowed or obscured from the light.“And if you have any doubts,” Peter added, “Corinthians overtly tells us thatthe parables have two layers of meaning: ‘milk for babes and meat for men’—wherethe milk is a watered-down reading for infantile minds, and the meat is the truemessage, accessible only to mature minds.”Peter raised the flashlight, again illuminating the carving of the cloakedfigure pointing intently at the Bible. “I know you are a skeptic, Robert, butconsider this. If the Bible does not contain hidden meaning, then why have somany of history’s finest minds—including brilliant scientists at the RoyalSociety—become so obsessed with studying it? Sir Isaac Newton wrote more than amillion words attempting to decipher the true meaning of the Scripture,including a 1704 manuscript that claimed he had extracted hidden scientificinformation from the Bible!”Langdon knew this was true.“And Sir Francis Bacon,” Peter continued, “the luminary hired by King James toliterally create the authorized King James Bible, became so utterly convincedthat the Bible contained cryptic meaning that he wrote in his own codes, whichare still studied today! Of course, as you know, Bacon was a Rosicrucian andpenned The Wisdom of the Ancients.” Peter smiled. “Even the iconoclastic poetWilliam Blake hinted that we should read between the lines.”Langdon was familiar with the verse:BOTH READ THE BIBLE DAY AND NIGHT,BUT THOU READ BLACK WHERE I READ WHITE.“And it wasn’t just the European luminaries,” Peter continued, descending fasternow. “It was here, Robert, at the very core of this young American nation, thatour brightest forefathers—John Adams, Ben Franklin, Thomas Paine—all warned ofthe profound dangers of interpreting the Bible literally. In fact, ThomasJefferson was so convinced the Bible’s true message was hidden that he literallycut up the pages and reedited the book, attempting, in his words, ‘to do awaywith the artificial scaffolding and restore the genuine doctrines.’ ”Langdon was well aware of this strange fact. The Jeffersonian Bible was still inprint today and included many of his controversial revisions, among them theremoval of the virgin birth and the resurrection. Incredibly, the JeffersonianBible had been presented to every incoming member of Congress during the firsthalf of the nineteenth century.“Peter, you know I find this topic fascinating, and I can understand that itmight be tempting for bright minds to imagine the Scriptures contain hiddenmeaning, but it makes no logical sense to me. Any skilled professor will tellyou that teaching is never done in code.”“I’m sorry?”“Teachers teach, Peter. We speak openly. Why would the prophets—the greatestteachers in history—obscure their language? If they hoped to change the world,why would they speak in code? Why not speak plainly so the world couldunderstand?”Peter glanced back over his shoulder as he descended, looking surprised by thequestion. “Robert, the Bible does not talk openly for the same reason theAncient Mystery Schools were kept hidden . . . for the same reason the neophyteshad to be initiated before learning the secret teachings of the ages . . . forthe same reason the scientists in the Invisible College refused to share theirknowledge with others. This information is powerful, Robert. The AncientMysteries cannot be shouted from the rooftops. The mysteries are a flamingtorch, which, in the hands of a master, can light the way, but which, in thehands of a madman, can scorch the earth.”Langdon stopped short. What is he saying? “Peter, I’m talking about the Bible.Why are you talking about the Ancient Mysteries?”Peter turned. “Robert, don’t you see? The Ancient Mysteries and the Bible arethe same thing.”Langdon stared in bewilderment.Peter was silent for several seconds, waiting for the concept to soak in. “TheBible is one of the books through which the mysteries have been passed downthrough history. Its pages are desperately trying to tell us the secret. Don’tyou understand? The ‘dark sayings’ in the Bible are the whispers of theancients, quietly sharing with us all of their secret wisdom.”Langdon said nothing. The Ancient Mysteries, as he understood them, were a kindof instruction manual for harnessing the latent power of the human mind . . . arecipe for personal apotheosis. He had never been able to accept the power ofthe mysteries, and certainly the notion that the Bible was somehow hiding a keyto these mysteries was an impossible stretch.“Peter, the Bible and the Ancient Mysteries are total opposites. The mysteriesare all about the god within you . . . man as god. The Bible is all about theGod above you . . . and man as a powerless sinner.”“Yes! Exactly! You’ve put your finger on the precise problem! The moment mankindseparated himself from God, the true meaning of the Word was lost. The voices ofthe ancient masters have now been drowned out, lost in the chaotic din ofself-proclaimed practitioners shouting that they alone understand the Word . . .that the Word is written in their language and none other.”Peter continued down the stairs.“Robert, you and I both know that the ancients would be horrified if they sawhow their teachings have been perverted . . . how religion has establisheditself as a tollbooth to heaven . . . how warriors march into battle believingGod favors their cause. We’ve lost the Word, and yet its true meaning is stillwithin reach, right before our eyes. It exists in all the enduring texts, fromthe Bible to the Bhagavad Gita to the Koran and beyond. All of these texts arerevered upon the altars of Freemasonry because Masons understand what the worldseems to have forgotten . . . that each of these texts, in its own way, isquietly whispering the exact same message.” Peter’s voice welled with emotion. “‘Know ye not that ye are gods?’”Langdon was struck by the way this famous ancient saying kept surfacing tonight.He had reflected on it while talking to Galloway and also at the CapitolBuilding while trying to explain The Apotheosis of Washington.Peter lowered his voice to a whisper. “The Buddha said, ‘You are God yourself.’Jesus taught that ‘the kingdom of God is within you’ and even promised us, ‘Theworks I do, you can do . . . and greater.’ Even the first antipope—Hippolytus ofRome—quoted the same message, first uttered by the gnostic teacher Monoimus:‘Abandon the search for God . . . instead, take yourself as the starting place.’”Langdon flashed on the House of the Temple, where the Masonic Tyler’s chair boretwo words of guidance carved across its back: KNOW THYSELF.“A wise man once told me,” Peter said, his voice faint now, “the only differencebetween you and God is that you have forgotten you are divine.”“Peter, I hear you—I do. And I’d love to believe we are gods, but I see no godswalking our earth. I see no superhumans.You can point to the alleged miracles ofthe Bible, or any other religious text, but they are nothing but old storiesfabricated by man and then exaggerated over time.”“Perhaps,” Peter said. “Or perhaps we simply need our science to catch up withthe wisdom of the ancients.” He paused. “Funny thing is . . . I believeKatherine’s research may be poised to do just that.”Langdon suddenly remembered that Katherine had dashed off from the House of theTemple earlier. “Hey, where did she go, anyway?”“She’ll be here shortly,” Peter said, grinning. “She went to confirm a wonderfulbit of good fortune.”Outside, at the base of the monument, Peter Solomon felt invigorated as heinhaled the cold night air. He watched in amusement as Langdon stared intentlyat the ground, scratching his head and looking around at the foot of theobelisk.“Professor,” Peter joked, “the cornerstone that contains the Bible isunderground. You can’t actually access the book, but I assure you it’s there.”“I believe you,” Langdon said, appearing lost in thought. “It’s just . . . Inoticed something.”Langdon stepped back now and surveyed the giant plaza on which the WashingtonMonument stood. The circular concourse was made entirely of white stone . . .except for two decorative courses of dark stone, which formed two concentriccircles around the monument.“A circle within a circle,” Langdon said. “I never realized the WashingtonMonument stands at the center of a circle within a circle.”Peter had to laugh. He misses nothing. “Yes, the great circumpunct . . . theuniversal symbol for God . . . at the crossroads of America.” He gave a coyshrug. “I’m sure it’s just a coincidence.”Langdon seemed far off, gazing skyward now, his eyes ascending the illuminatedspire, which shone stark white against the black winter sky.Peter sensed Langdon was beginning to see this creation for what it truly was .. . a silent reminder of ancient wisdom . . . an icon of enlightened man at theheart of a great nation. Even though Peter could not see the tiny aluminum tipat the top, he knew it was there, man’s enlightened mind straining towardheaven.Laus Deo.“Peter?” Langdon approached, looking like a man who’d endured some kind ofmystical initiation. “I almost forgot,” he said, reaching into his pocket andproducing Peter’s gold Masonic ring. “I’ve been wanting to return this to youall night.”“Thank you, Robert.” Peter held out his left hand and took the ring, admiringit. “You know, all the secrecy and mystery surrounding this ring and the MasonicPyramid . . . it had an enormous effect on my life. When I was a young man, thepyramid was given to me with the promise that it hid mystical secrets. Its mereexistence made me believe there were great mysteries in the world. It piqued mycuriosity, fueled my sense of wonder, and inspired me to open my mind to theAncient Mysteries.” He smiled quietly and slipped the ring into his pocket. “Inow realize that the Masonic Pyramid’s true purpose was not to reveal theanswers, but rather to inspire a fascination with them.”The two men stood in silence for a long while at the foot of the monument.When Langdon finally spoke, his tone was serious. “I need to ask you a favor,Peter . . . as a friend.”“Of course. Anything.”Langdon made his request . . . firmly.Solomon nodded, knowing he was right. “I will.”“Right away,” Langdon added, motioning to the waiting Escalade.“Okay . . . but one caveat.”Langdon rolled his eyes, chuckling. “Somehow you always get the last word.”“Yes, and there is one final thing I want you and Katherine to see.”“At this hour?” Langdon checked his watch.Solomon smiled warmly at his old friend. “It is Washington’s most spectaculartreasure . . . and something very, very few people have ever seen.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 132Katherine Solomon’s heart felt light as she hurried up the hill toward the baseof the Washington Monument. She had endured great shock and tragedy tonight, andyet her thoughts were refocused now, if only temporarily, on the wonderful newsPeter had shared with her earlier . . . news she had just confirmed with hervery own eyes.My research is safe. All of it.Her lab’s holographic data drives had been destroyed tonight, but earlier, atthe House of the Temple, Peter had informed her that he had been secretlykeeping backups of all her Noetic research in the SMSC executive offices. Youknow I’m utterly fascinated with your work, he had explained, and I wanted tofollow your progress without disturbing you.“Katherine?” a deep voice called out.She looked up.A lone figure stood in silhouette at the base of the illuminated monument.“Robert!” She hurried over and hugged him.“I heard the good news,” Langdon whispered. “You must be relieved.”Her voice cracked with emotion. “Incredibly.” The research Peter had saved was ascientific tour de force—a massive collection of experiments that proved humanthought was a real and measurable force in the world. Katherine’s experimentsdemonstrated the effect of human thought on everything from ice crystals torandom-event generators to the movement of subatomic particles. The results wereconclusive and irrefutable, with the potential to transform skeptics intobelievers and affect global consciousness on a massive scale. “Everything isgoing to change, Robert. Everything.”“Peter certainly thinks so.”Katherine glanced around for her brother.“Hospital,” Langdon said. “I insisted he go as a favor to me.”Katherine exhaled, relieved. “Thank you.”“He told me to wait for you here.”Katherine nodded, her gaze climbing the glowing white obelisk. “He said he wasbringing you here. Something about ‘Laus Deo’? He didn’t elaborate.”Langdon gave a tired chuckle. “I’m not sure I entirely understand it myself.” Heglanced up at the top of the monument. “Your brother said quite a few thingstonight that I couldn’t get my mind around.”“Let me guess,” Katherine said. “Ancient Mysteries, science, and the HolyScriptures?”“Bingo.”“Welcome to my world.” She winked. “Peter initiated me into this long ago. Itfueled a lot of my research.”“Intuitively, some of what he said made sense.” Langdon shook his head. “Butintellectually . . .”Katherine smiled and put her arm around him. “You know, Robert, I may be able tohelp you with that.”Deep inside the Capitol Building, Architect Warren Bellamy was walking down adeserted hallway.Only one thing left to do tonight, he thought.When he arrived at his office, he retrieved a very old key from his desk drawer.The key was black iron, long and slender, with faded markings. He slid it intohis pocket and then prepared himself to welcome his guests.Robert Langdon and Katherine Solomon were on their way to the Capitol. AtPeter’s request, Bellamy was to provide them with a very rare opportunity—thechance to lay eyes upon this building’s most magnificent secret . . . somethingthat could be revealed only by the Architect."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 133High above the floor of the Capitol Rotunda, Robert Langdon inched nervouslyaround the circular catwalk that extended just beneath the ceiling of the dome.He peered tentatively over the railing, dizzied by the height, still unable tobelieve it had been less than ten hours since Peter’s hand had appeared in themiddle of the floor below.On that same floor, the Architect of the Capitol was now a tiny speck somehundred and eighty feet below, moving steadily across the Rotunda and thendisappearing. Bellamy had escorted Langdon and Katherine up to this balcony,leaving them here with very specific instructions.Peter’s instructions.Langdon eyed the old iron key that Bellamy had handed to him. Then he glancedover at a cramped stairwell that ascended from this level . . . climbing higherstill. God help me. These narrow stairs, according to the Architect, led up to asmall metal door that could be unlocked with the iron key in Langdon’s hand.Beyond the door lay something that Peter insisted Langdon and Katherine see.Peter had not elaborated, but rather had left strict instructions regarding theprecise hour at which the door was to be opened. We have to wait to open thedoor? Why?Langdon checked his watch again and groaned.Slipping the key into his pocket, he gazed across the gaping void before him atthe far side of the balcony. Katherine had walked fearlessly ahead, apparentlyunfazed by the height. She was now halfway around the circumference, admiringevery inch of Brumidi’s The Apotheosis of Washington, which loomed directly overtheir heads. From this rare vantage point, the fifteen-foot-tall figures thatadorned the nearly five thousand square feet of the Capitol Dome were visible inastonishing detail.Langdon turned his back to Katherine, faced the outer wall, and whispered veryquietly, “Katherine, this is your conscience speaking. Why did you abandonRobert?”Katherine was apparently familiar with the dome’s startling acousticalproperties . . . because the wall whispered back. “Because Robert is being achicken. He should come over here with me. We have plenty of time before we’reallowed to open that door.”Langdon knew she was right and reluctantly made his way around the balcony,hugging the wall as he went.“This ceiling is absolutely amazing,” Katherine marveled, her neck craned totake in the enormous splendor of the Apotheosis overhead. “Mythical gods allmixed in with scientific inventors and their creations? And to think this is theimage at the center of our Capitol.”Langdon turned his eyes upward to the sprawling forms of Franklin, Fulton, andMorse with their technological inventions. A shining rainbow arched away fromthese figures, guiding his eye to George Washington ascending to heaven on acloud. The great promise of man becoming God.Katherine said, “It’s as if the entire essence of the Ancient Mysteries ishovering over the Rotunda.”Langdon had to admit, not many frescoes in the world fused scientific inventionswith mythical gods and human apotheosis. This ceiling’s spectacular collectionof images was indeed a message of the Ancient Mysteries, and it was here for areason. The founding fathers had envisioned America as a blank canvas, a fertilefield on which the seeds of the mysteries could be sown. Today, this soaringicon—the father of our country ascending to heaven—hung silently above ourlawmakers, leaders, and presidents . . . a bold reminder, a map to the future, apromise of a time when man would evolve to complete spiritual maturity.“Robert,” Katherine whispered, her gaze still fixated on the massive figures ofAmerica’s great inventors accompanied by Minerva. “It’s prophetic, really.Today, man’s most advanced inventions are being used to study man’s most ancientideas. The science of Noetics may be new, but it’s actually the oldest scienceon earth—the study of human thought.” She turned to him now, her eyes filledwith wonder. “And we’re learning that the ancients actually understood thoughtmore profoundly than we do today.”“Makes sense,” Langdon replied. “The human mind was the only technology theancients had at their disposal. The early philosophers studied it relentlessly.”“Yes! The ancient texts are obsessed with the power of the human mind. The Vedasdescribe the flow of mind energy. The Pistis Sophia describes universalconsciousness. The Zohar explores the nature of mind spirit. The Shamanic textspredict Einstein’s ‘remote influence’ in terms of healing at a distance. It’sall there! And don’t even get me started about the Bible.”“You, too?” Langdon said, chuckling. “Your brother tried to convince me that theBible is encoded with scientific information.”“It certainly is,” she said. “And if you don’t believe Peter, read some ofNewton’s esoteric texts on the Bible. When you start to understand the crypticparables in the Bible, Robert, you realize it’s a study of the human mind.”Langdon shrugged. “I guess I’d better go back and read it again.”“Let me ask you something,” she said, clearly not appreciating his skepticism.“When the Bible tells us to ‘go build our temple’ . . . a temple that we must‘build with no tools and making no noise,’ what temple do you think it’s talkingabout?”“Well, the text does say your body is a temple.”“Yes, Corinthians 3:16. You are the temple of God.” She smiled at him. “And theGospel of John says the exact same thing. Robert, the Scriptures are well awareof the power latent within us, and they are urging us to harness that power . .. urging us to build the temples of our minds.”“Unfortunately, I think much of the religious world is waiting for a real templeto be rebuilt. It’s part of the Messianic Prophecy.”“Yes, but that overlooks an important point. The Second Coming is the coming ofman—the moment when mankind finally builds the temple of his mind.”“I don’t know,” Langdon said, rubbing his chin. “I’m no Bible scholar, but I’mpretty sure the Scriptures describe in detail a physical temple that needs to bebuilt. The structure is described as being in two parts—an outer temple calledthe Holy Place and an inner sanctuary called the Holy of Holies. The two partsare separated from each other by a thin veil.”Katherine grinned. “Pretty good recall for a Bible skeptic. By the way, have youever seen an actual human brain? It’s built in two parts—an outer part calledthe dura mater and an inner part called the pia mater. These two parts areseparated by the arachnoid—a veil of weblike tissue.”Langdon cocked his head in surprise.Gently, she reached up and touched Langdon’s temple. “There’s a reason they callthis your temple, Robert.”As Langdon tried to process what Katherine had said, he flashed unexpectedly onthe gnostic Gospel of Mary: Where the mind is, there is the treasure.“Perhaps you’ve heard,” Katherine said, softly now, “about the brain scans takenof yogis while they meditate? The human brain, in advanced states of focus, willphysically create a waxlike substance from the pineal gland. This brainsecretion is unlike anything else in the body. It has an incredible healingeffect, can literally regenerate cells, and may be one of the reasons yogis liveso long. This is real science, Robert. This substance has inconceivableproperties and can be created only by a mind that is highly tuned to a deeplyfocused state.”“I remember reading about that a few years back.”“Yes, and on that topic, you’re familiar with the Bible’s account of ‘manna fromheaven’?”Langdon saw no connection. “You mean the magical substance that fell from heavento nourish the hungry?”“Exactly. The substance was said to heal the sick, provide everlasting life,and, strangely, cause no waste in those who consumed it.” Katherine paused, asif waiting for him to understand. “Robert?” she prodded. “A kind of nourishmentthat fell from heaven?” She tapped her temple. “Magically heals the body?Creates no waste? Don’t you see? These are code words, Robert! Temple is codefor ‘body.’ Heaven is code for ‘mind.’ Jacob’s ladder is your spine. And mannais this rare brain secretion. When you see these code words in Scripture, payattention. They are often markers for a more profound meaning concealed beneaththe surface.”Katherine’s words were coming out in rapid-fire succession now, explaining howthis same magical substance appeared throughout the Ancient Mysteries: Nectar ofthe Gods, Elixir of Life, Fountain of Youth, Philosopher’s Stone, ambrosia, dew,ojas, soma. Then she launched into an explanation about the brain’s pineal glandrepresenting the all-seeing eye of God. “According to Matthew 6:22,” she saidexcitedly, “ ‘when your eye is single, your body fills with light.’ This conceptis also represented by the Ajna chakra and the dot on a Hindu’s forehead,which—”Katherine stopped short, looking sheepish. “Sorry . . . I know I’m rambling. Ijust find this all so exhilarating. For years I’ve studied the ancients’ claimsof man’s awesome mental power, and now science is showing us that accessing thatpower is an actual physical process. Our brains, if used correctly, can callforth powers that are quite literally superhuman. The Bible, like many ancienttexts, is a detailed exposition of the most sophisticated machine ever created .. . the human mind.” She sighed. “Incredibly, science has yet to scratch thesurface of the mind’s full promise.”“It sounds like your work in Noetics will be a quantum leap forward.”“Or backward,” she said. “The ancients already knew many of the scientifictruths we’re now rediscovering. Within a matter of years, modern man will beforced to accept what is now unthinkable: our minds can generate energy capableof transforming physical matter.” She paused. “Particles react to our thoughts .. . which means our thoughts have the power to change the world.”Langdon smiled softly.“What my research has brought me to believe is this,” Katherine said. “God isvery real—a mental energy that pervades everything. And we, as human beings,have been created in that image—”“I’m sorry?” Langdon interrupted. “Created in the image of . . . mental energy?”“Exactly. Our physical bodies have evolved over the ages, but it was our mindsthat were created in the image of God. We’ve been reading the Bible tooliterally. We learn that God created us in his image, but it’s not our physicalbodies that resemble God, it’s our minds.”Langdon was silent now, fully engrossed.“This is the great gift, Robert, and God is waiting for us to understand it. Allaround the world, we are gazing skyward, waiting for God . . . never realizingthat God is waiting for us.” Katherine paused, letting her words soak in. “Weare creators, and yet we naively play the role of ‘the created.’ We seeourselves as helpless sheep buffeted around by the God who made us. We kneellike frightened children, begging for help, for forgiveness, for good luck. Butonce we realize that we are truly created in the Creator’s image, we will startto understand that we, too, must be Creators. When we understand this fact, thedoors will burst wide open for human potential.”Langdon recalled a passage that had always stuck with him from the work of thephilosopher Manly P. Hall: If the infinite had not desired man to be wise, hewould not have bestowed upon him the faculty of knowing. Langdon gazed up againat the image of The Apotheosis of Washington—the symbolic ascent of man todeity. The created . . . becoming the Creator.“The most amazing part,” Katherine said, “is that as soon as we humans begin toharness our true power, we will have enormous control over our world. We will beable to design reality rather than merely react to it.”Langdon lowered his gaze. “That sounds . . . dangerous.”Katherine looked startled . . . and impressed. “Yes, exactly! If thoughts affectthe world, then we must be very careful how we think. Destructive thoughts haveinfluence, too, and we all know it’s far easier to destroy than it is tocreate.”Langdon thought of all the lore about needing to protect the ancient wisdom fromthe unworthy and share it only with the enlightened. He thought of the InvisibleCollege, and the great scientist Isaac Newton’s request to Robert Boyle to keep“high silence” about their secret research. It cannot be communicated, Newtonwrote in 1676, without immense damage to the world.“There’s an interesting twist here,” Katherine said. “The great irony is thatall the religions of the world, for centuries, have been urging their followersto embrace the concepts of faith and belief. Now science, which for centurieshas derided religion as superstition, must admit that its next big frontier isquite literally the science of faith and belief . . . the power of focusedconviction and intention. The same science that eroded our faith in themiraculous is now building a bridge back across the chasm it created.”Langdon considered her words for a long time. Slowly he raised his eyes again tothe Apotheosis. “I have a question,” he said, looking back at Katherine. “Evenif I could accept, just for an instant, that I have the power to change physicalmatter with my mind, and literally manifest all that I desire . . . I’m afraid Isee nothing in my life to make me believe I have such power.”She shrugged. “Then you’re not looking hard enough.”“Come on, I want a real answer. That’s the answer of a priest. I want the answerof a scientist.”“You want a real answer? Here it is. If I hand you a violin and say you have thecapability to use it to make incredible music, I am not lying. You do have thecapability, but you’ll need enormous amounts of practice to manifest it. This isno different from learning to use your mind, Robert. Well-directed thought is alearned skill. To manifest an intention requires laserlike focus, full sensoryvisualization, and a profound belief. We have proven this in a lab. And justlike playing a violin, there are people who exhibit greater natural ability thanothers. Look to history. Look to the stories of those enlightened minds whoperformed miraculous feats.”“Katherine, please don’t tell me you actually believe in the miracles. I mean,seriously . . . turning water into wine, healing the sick with the touch of ahand?”Katherine took a long breath and blew it out slowly. “I have witnessed peopletransform cancer cells into healthy cells simply by thinking about them. I havewitnessed human minds affecting the physical world in myriad ways. And once yousee that happen, Robert, once this becomes part of your reality, then some ofthe miracles you read about become simply a matter of degree.”Langdon was pensive. “It’s an inspiring way to see the world, Katherine, but forme, it just feels like an impossible leap of faith. And as you know, faith hasnever come easily for me.”“Then don’t think of it as faith. Think of it simply as changing yourperspective, accepting that the world is not precisely as you imagine.Historically, every major scientific breakthrough began with a simple idea thatthreatened to overturn all of our beliefs. The simple statement ‘the earth isround’ was mocked as utterly impossible because most people believed the oceanswould flow off the planet. Heliocentricity was called heresy. Small minds havealways lashed out at what they don’t understand. There are those who create . .. and those who tear down. That dynamic has existed for all time. But eventuallythe creators find believers, and the number of believers reaches a criticalmass, and suddenly the world becomes round, or the solar system becomesheliocentric. Perception is transformed, and a new reality is born.”Langdon nodded, his thoughts drifting now.“You have a funny look on your face,” she said.“Oh, I don’t know. For some reason I was just remembering how I used to canoeout into the middle of the lake late at night, lie down under the stars, andthink about stuff like this.”She nodded knowingly. “I think we all have a similar memory. Something aboutlying on our backs staring up at the heavens . . . opens the mind.” She glancedup at the ceiling and then said, “Give me your jacket.”“What?” He took it off and gave it to her.She folded it twice and laid it down on the catwalk like a long pillow. “Liedown.”Langdon lay on his back, and Katherine positioned his head on half of the foldedjacket. Then she lay down beside him—two kids, shoulder to shoulder on thenarrow catwalk, staring up at Brumidi’s enormous fresco.“Okay,” she whispered. “Put yourself in that same mind-set . . . a kid lying outin a canoe . . . looking up at the stars . . . his mind open and full ofwonder.”Langdon tried to obey, although at the moment, prone and comfortable, he wasfeeling a sudden wave of exhaustion. As his vision blurred, he perceived a mutedshape overhead that immediately woke him. Is that possible? He could not believehe hadn’t noticed it before, but the figures in The Apotheosis of Washingtonwere clearly arranged in two concentric rings—a circle within a circle. TheApotheosis is also a circumpunct? Langdon wondered what else he had missedtonight.“There’s something important I want to tell you, Robert. There’s another pieceto all this . . . a piece that I believe is the single most astonishing aspectof my research.”There’s more?Katherine propped herself on her elbow. “And I promise . . . if we as humans canhonestly grasp this one simple truth . . . the world will change overnight.”She now had his full attention.“I should preface this,” she said, “by reminding you of the Masonic mantras to‘gather what is scattered’ . . . to bring ‘order from chaos’ . . . to find‘at-one-ment.’ ”“Go on.” Langdon was intrigued.Katherine smiled down at him. “We have scientifically proven that the power ofhuman thought grows exponentially with the number of minds that share thatthought.”Langdon remained silent, wondering where she was going with this idea.“What I’m saying is this . . . two heads are better than one . . . and yet twoheads are not twice better, they are many, many times better. Multiple mindsworking in unison magnify a thought’s effect . . . exponentially. This is theinherent power of prayer groups, healing circles, singing in unison, andworshipping en masse. The idea of universal consciousness is no ethereal New Ageconcept. It’s a hard-core scientific reality . . . and harnessing it has thepotential to transform our world. This is the underlying discovery of NoeticScience. What’s more, it’s happening right now. You can feel it all around you.Technology is linking us in ways we never imagined possible: Twitter, Google,Wikipedia, and others—all blend to create a web of interconnected minds.” Shelaughed. “And I guarantee you, as soon as I publish my work, the Twitterati willall be sending tweets that say, ‘learning about Noetics,’ and interest in thisscience will explode exponentially.”Langdon’s eyelids felt impossibly heavy. “You know, I still haven’t learned howto send a twitter.”“A tweet,” she corrected, laughing.“I’m sorry?”“Never mind. Close your eyes. I’ll wake you when it’s time.”Langdon realized he had all but forgotten the old key the Architect had giventhem . . . and why they had come up here. As a new wave of exhaustion engulfedhim, Langdon shut his eyes. In the darkness of his mind, he found himselfthinking about universal consciousness . . . about Plato’s writings on “the mindof the world” and “gathering God” . . . Jung’s “collective unconscious.” Thenotion was as simple as it was startling.God is found in the collection of Many . . . rather than in the One.“Elohim,” Langdon said suddenly, his eyes flying open again as he made anunexpected connection.“I’m sorry?” Katherine was still gazing down at him.“Elohim,” he repeated. “The Hebrew word for God in the Old Testament! I’vealways wondered about it.”Katherine gave a knowing smile. “Yes. The word is plural.”Exactly! Langdon had never understood why the very first passages of the Biblereferred to God as a plural being. Elohim. The Almighty God in Genesis wasdescribed not as One . . . but as Many.“God is plural,” Katherine whispered, “because the minds of man are plural.”Langdon’s thoughts were spiraling now . . . dreams, memories, hopes, fears,revelations . . . all swirling above him in the Rotunda dome. As his eyes beganto close again, he found himself staring at three words in Latin, painted withinthe Apotheosis.E PLURIBUS UNUM.“Out of many, one,” he thought, slipping off into sleep."},{"pageContent":"EpilogueRobert Langdon awoke slowly.Faces gazed down at him. Where am I?A moment later, he recalled where he was. He sat up slowly beneath theApotheosis. His back felt stiff from lying on the hard catwalk.Where’s Katherine?Langdon checked his Mickey Mouse watch. It’s almost time. He pulled himself tohis feet, peering cautiously over the banister into the gaping space below.“Katherine?” he called out.The word echoed back in the silence of the deserted Rotunda.Retrieving his tweed jacket from the floor, he brushed it off and put it backon. He checked his pockets. The iron key the Architect had given him was gone.Making his way back around the walkway, Langdon headed for the opening theArchitect had shown them . . . steep metal stairs ascending into crampeddarkness. He began to climb. Higher and higher he ascended. Gradually thestairway became more narrow and more inclined. Still Langdon pushed on.Just a little farther.The steps had become almost ladderlike now, the passage frighteninglyconstricted. Finally, the stairs ended, and Langdon stepped up onto a smalllanding. Before him was a heavy metal door. The iron key was in the lock, andthe door hung slightly ajar. He pushed, and the door creaked open. The airbeyond felt cold. As Langdon stepped across the threshold into murky darkness,he realized he was now outside.“I was just coming to get you,” Katherine said, smiling at him. “It’s almosttime.”When Langdon recognized his surroundings, he drew a startled breath. He wasstanding on a tiny skywalk that encircled the pinnacle of the U.S. Capitol Dome.Directly above him, the bronze Statue of Freedom gazed out over the sleepingcapital city. She faced the east, where the first crimson splashes of dawn hadbegun to paint the horizon.Katherine guided Langdon around the balcony until they were facing west,perfectly aligned with the National Mall. In the distance, the silhouette of theWashington Monument stood in the early-morning light. From this vantage point,the towering obelisk looked even more impressive than it had before.“When it was built,” Katherine whispered, “it was the tallest structure on theentire planet.”Langdon pictured the old sepia photographs of stonemasons on scaffolding, morethan five hundred feet in the air, laying each block by hand, one by one.We are builders, he thought. We are creators.Since the beginning of time, man had sensed there was something special abouthimself . . . something more. He had longed for powers he did not possess. Hehad dreamed of flying, of healing, and of transforming his world in every wayimaginable.And he had done just that.Today, the shrines to man’s accomplishments adorned the National Mall. TheSmithsonian museums burgeoned with our inventions, our art, our science, and theideas of our great thinkers. They told the history of man as creator—from thestone tools in the Native American History Museum to the jets and rockets in theNational Air and Space Museum.If our ancestors could see us today, surely they would think us gods.As Langdon peered through the predawn mist at the sprawling geometry of museumsand monuments before him, his eyes returned to the Washington Monument. Hepictured the lone Bible in the buried cornerstone and thought of how the Word ofGod was really the word of man.He thought about the great circumpunct, and how it had been embedded in thecircular plaza beneath the monument at the crossroads of America. Langdonthought suddenly of the little stone box Peter had entrusted to him. The cube,he now realized, had unhinged and opened to form the same exact geometricalform—a cross with a circumpunct at its center. Langdon had to laugh. Even thatlittle box was hinting at this crossroads.“Robert, look!” Katherine pointed to the top of the monument.Langdon lifted his gaze but saw nothing.Then, staring more intently, he glimpsed it.Across the Mall, a tiny speck of golden sunlight was glinting off the highesttip of the towering obelisk. The shining pinpoint grew quickly brighter, moreradiant, gleaming on the capstone’s aluminum peak. Langdon watched in wonder asthe light transformed into a beacon that hovered above the shadowed city. Hepictured the tiny engraving on the east-facing side of the aluminum tip andrealized to his amazement that the first ray of sunlight to hit the nation’scapital, every single day, did so by illuminating two words:Laus Deo.“Robert,” Katherine whispered. “Nobody ever gets to come up here at sunrise.This is what Peter wanted us to witness.”Langdon could feel his pulse quickening as the glow atop the monumentintensified.“He said he believes this is why the forefathers built the monument so tall. Idon’t know if that’s true, but I do know this—there’s a very old law decreeingthat nothing taller can be built in our capital city. Ever.”The light inched farther down the capstone as the sun crept over the horizonbehind them. As Langdon watched, he could almost sense, all around him, thecelestial spheres tracing their eternal orbits through the void of space. Hethought of the Great Architect of the Universe and how Peter had saidspecifically that the treasure he wanted to show Langdon could be unveiled onlyby the Architect. Langdon had assumed this meant Warren Bellamy. WrongArchitect.As the rays of sunlight strengthened, the golden glow engulfed the entirety ofthe thirty-three-hundred-pound capstone. The mind of man . . . receivingenlightenment. The light then began inching down the monument, commencing thesame descent it performed every morning. Heaven moving toward earth . . . Godconnecting to man. This process, Langdon realized, would reverse come evening.The sun would dip in the west, and the light would climb again from earth backto heaven . . . preparing for a new day.Beside him, Katherine shivered and inched closer. Langdon put his arm aroundher. As the two of them stood side by side in silence, Langdon thought about allhe had learned tonight. He thought of Katherine’s belief that everything wasabout to change. He thought of Peter’s faith that an age of enlightenment wasimminent. And he thought of the words of a great prophet who had boldlydeclared: Nothing is hidden that will not be made known; nothing is secret thatwill not come to light.As the sun rose over Washington, Langdon looked to the heavens, where the lastof the nighttime stars were fading out. He thought about science, about faith,about man. He thought about how every culture, in every country, in every time,had always shared one thing. We all had the Creator. We used different names,different faces, and different prayers, but God was the universal constant forman. God was the symbol we all shared . . . the symbol of all the mysteries oflife that we could not understand. The ancients had praised God as a symbol ofour limitless human potential, but that ancient symbol had been lost over time.Until now.In that moment, standing atop the Capitol, with the warmth of the sun streamingdown all around him, Robert Langdon felt a powerful upwelling deep withinhimself. It was an emotion he had never felt this profoundly in his entire life.Hope."},{"pageContent":"ALSO BY DAN BROWNFeaturing Robert LangdonTHE DA VINCI CODEANGELS & DEMONSDECEPTION POINTDIGITAL FORTRESS"},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHORDan Brown is the author of The Da Vinci Code, one of the most widely read novelsof all time, as well as the international bestsellers Angels & Demons, DeceptionPoint, and Digital Fortress.
