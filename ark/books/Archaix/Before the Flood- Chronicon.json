[{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"NEW Chronicon Notes Unpublished for PreHistory to 3896 BCE. 5133 words/ notes in chronological order 2019 After 19 years data - mining over 1350 historical books, chronographic texts and refe rence works it has been positively determined that the events of world history are not random occurrences but fit within a series of interfacing timelines that are so perfect as to defy nature. This end product of immense research concludes affirmatively that historical events as recorded chronologically in human history are actually PROGRAMMED subroutines that converge flawlessly at key nodal interfaces in a vast yet perfect SIMULATION of historical events , events connected to our present awareness with s uch precision that a casual scrutiny of the simulation's historical protocols easily provides us EXACT future dates when to expect similar events as had been recorded at the nodal interfaces. Conclusion - the human experience is within the confines of a p rogrammed simulation ...the Universe is nothing more than an algorithm. It is further concluded that because Something manufactured this vast false existence then what this false existence imprisons, humans , must be much more than they suppose themselves t o be. Humankind must be so immensely powerful that it was only by the deceit of a False Reality were they subdued. Lastly, EVERY timeline connected throughout this simulated history exhibits evidence that a collapse of the simulation is planned. One aft er another these false historical subroutin es will collapse with the final one ending the simulated existence at the time marked in our modern calendar at 2106 CE. Major \"reality - col l apses\" will first occur in May 2040, November 2046, in 2052, and in 2070 , however, the phenomena produced from these subroutines ending will have dual effects on human consciousness: humans moored to the simulated false world will suffer cataclysmic episodes ruining their civilizations as humans who are enlightened will experi ence heightened awareness as the simulated deceits imprisoning them grow weaker with the collapse of each false holography. This is the central premise to the archives of posts and books found on www.archaix.com . C ome have a look, and learn what others are afraid to know. The need for Chronicon is great. The world today is filled with books about global antiquities and extraterrestrial theory packed with disinformation serving only to confuse and detract from the truth.

The observations of long - forgotten sciences reappear in the worl d as prophecies. 20,986 BCE according to the modern scientific model this is when light traveling from the Galactic Core at 186,000 milers per second began moving toward us to be viewed through telescopes in the year 2016 CE when the 1st draft of Chronicon was finished, a trip of 23,000 years. (Earth Under Fire p. 55) A totally ridiculous notion. 9500 BCE a plethora of modern books all borrowing from one another claim this is the approximate date for the destruction of Atlantis as told to Solon by Egyptian priests - a ridiculous dating easily proven wrong from the critical and chronological writings of Plato's critics and other works. 7819 BCE a supernova occurred producing Cassiopeia A, which, being 9500 light - years away, was not visible until sighted by western astronomers in 1680 CE. (Earth Under Fire p. 299) Again, total theory premised upon a stack of hypothetical beliefs. 5531 BCE a supernova occurred forming the Crab Nebula Remnant, which, being 6585 light - years away, was first seen by Chinese astr onomers in 1054 CE. (Earth Under Fire 300) Again, there is no scientific way for we human mice to prove that the fantastically - detailed vault of lights we call the sky is anything more than a holographic projection. \"..the iridium layer associated with the disappearance of the dinosaurs came from WITHIN our own solar system.\" (Nemesis p. 7 - 8) Geologist Eugene Shoemaker had pointed out that if the asteroid hit the ocean, the injection of water vapor into the atmosphere could increase the 'greenhouse' ef fect and warm the climate.

And recounted among themselves what had been created...the Anunnaki, who fix the destinies, both groups of them, made answer to Enlil...let us slay (two) Lamga gods. With their blood let us create mankind. The service of the gods be their portion . For all times.\" (Adam When? p. 27 - 28, citing Alexander Heidel, The Babylonian Genesis, 1951) Saturn's moon Phoebe maintains a retrogade orbit very different than all of Saturn's other moons. It has 3% reflectivity making it difficult to see and it is perfectly round. (The Sirius Mystery 32) Approximately 120 miles in diameter, this satellite is possibly artificial. 5239 BCE the 4th planet from Sol was an enormous world remembered later as Tiamat , having 11 moons, its orbit located where the present astroid belt lies. At this time the Sol - orbiting planets were Mercury, Venus, Mars and Tiamat in the inner system instead of an astroid belt. Earth itself did not orbit around Sol but instead orbited around its binary companion, Nemesis, along with Phoenix, Nibiru and other small worlds. In December 1973 we launched the Pioneer 10 spacecraft which contained mankind's first communication to any extraterrestrial civilization. Supposedly it departed our solar system traveling 7 miles per second which even at such a velocity space is so vast that it will be 80,000 years before Pioneer 10 even closes the distance to the nearest star. (The Cosmic Connection p. 18) Distances in space as we've been led to b elieve are so vast that it takes light photons traveling at 186,000 miles per second about 30,000 years to reach our world from the center of our own galaxy.

By the present paradigm foisted upon the public, the entire heave ns could have died out hundreds of thousands of years ago and we would still not know it. That photons can travel such inconceivable distances through a medium saturated with other photons moving at various trajectories, subatomic particles acting as free radicals, water - ice crystals, ga ses, dust veils, nebulae, cometary detritus, rocks and asteroids, lunar bodies, planetoids, exoworlds, planets, other stars, event horizon anomalies and whatever else is out there is simply unbelievable, and this because it is untrue. The more one ponders the many incongruities of the stellasphere the more evidence manifests that we are looking up into a manifold Dyson shell - like holosphere either encapsulating our world with a false heavens or actually shelled around our e ntire solar system. This holospheric overlay produces a stellar canopy of visible and invisible gravitational bodies optically there but not physically extant, nodes of the holospheric net enshrouding us. This canopy of star - nodes is a holofield having layers of depth providing observers with the illusion of great distances and far off spaces; even apparent parallax is fabricated. The holography is either alive or of intelligence design and it is affected by and responds to human awareness. There are d ocumented instances when the visible patterns of luminaries changed positions to conform to majority scientific theory or popular opinions. Even our current primitive hologram technology demonstrates that the eye is easily deceived by the introduction of more and more intricate detail. Scientists cannot demonstrate that their observations are not made within a multi - tiered hologram. Astronomers form models of how planets are created from star detritus that coalesces from great irregular masses or rock and metals. But they can't find any formative planets in their telescopes so they claim that our galaxy must be very old - a theory supported by an hypothesis. In buying time to show evidence in support of their theory they added billions of years to the age of the galaxy. Hundreds of exoworlds have been viewed in this deceitful holosphere they call the heavens, but every one of them are spherical...fully developed planets. A new theory is not needed, rather, we are in need of new astronomers. The Camb rian Explosion Event is a true mystery, for at least 10,000 new species suddenly appeared on earth having no evolutionary predecessors. Ivar Zapp and George Erikson remark - \"Nothing like these creatures existed before this explosion of life forms, and not hing new has been created since.\" (Atlantis in America p. 125) Original solar system a differential binary - Nemesis and Sol. Prior to collapse of Nemesis, earth orbited Nemesis and it was home only to reptilians, amphibian, insectoid and marine creatures . Even in the prehistoric biosphere of this world under the Nemesis sun the avians were not birds as we know them, but reptiles. Orbiting Nemesis far away from its sister sun, Sol, earth had no mammalian life forms. 5239 BCE Anunna commit a trespass in introducing some of their own DNA into primate mammals in an effort to create a worker race for mining who are adapted to Earth's biosphere."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Human civilization did not begin on planet earth.

From the human standpoint as recorded in the very oldest writings and traditions the Beginning was the condition of the world already covered in primeval waters with many of these beliefs having attached to them the idea that these waters were the result of an early, prehistoric cataclysm. 5239 BCE A small island 40 miles off southern tip of New Caledonia in the Pacific has about 400 unusual tumuli; ant hill shaped mounds of gravel and sand about 8 to 9 feet high with some300 feet in diameter . There are 17 or so of these on New Caledonia. In the center of the mounds has been excavated upright pillars of cement, or cylinders. No burials, no bones, radiocarbon dating places them to about 5120 BCE.

While this tenet is true we can add a new dimension to the written word through the analysis of early traditions that comport with or expound upon the data derived from written records, as well as the discoveries that are made in archeology and chance discovery. The analytical focus of Chronicon has been to comprehend the mathematical structures known in antiquity and the formulas employed in the introduction and maintenance of early calendars, time - keeping systems, methods of counting or ways in which the passage of time was reckoned and to synchronize this information into a single linear chronology leading up to the present day.

(The Mammoth Book of Lost Symbols 419) 4309 BCE This cataclysm was 930 years AC (Anunnaki Chronology), from 5239 BCE. In the 6th - 4th centuries BCE the records of this major destruction were kept in Babylon and were copied by exiled Jews who borrowed passages to their liking and altered th e original texts which read \"...the destruction of the world [adamu] in the 930th year,\" to their fictive Genesis account that reads that Adam died in his 930th year. Adam and Eve are Jewish versions of Babylonian passages from the badly misunderstood rec ords of the Old World concerning a period when the first modern humans [adamu] thrived in a civilization that endured 930 years and ended abruptly in disaster. 4309 BCE This worldwide ruin is found in Jeremiah 4:23 - 26, the earth \"...without form and void ...all cities destroyed.\" All cosmogenesis traditions from antiquity have earth born from a chaos [disruption from a previous order] linked to evil that involved the visitation of a celestial dragon [frightening body in the sky]. 4309 BCE Phoenix catacl ysm is 2070 years to the Great Flood (2239 BCE), the exact midpoint between these disasters being 3274 BCE (621 Annus Mundi), the year Enoch/Enki was conceived, the famous antediluvian chronologist, scientist, mathematician, architect, prophet, scribe and ruler, builder of Giza. The Phoenix Weapon in the sky is the key to all world chronology. 4309 BCE A great many Old World traditions convey that the first people were born in a world of ice, or from the body/blood of an ice/frost giant. The human race is a living DNA repository designed solely by the Anunnaki to enslave spiritual beings in carnal bodies. The present human race has intentionally had entire gene sequences deactivated [latent DNA] to impede our ability to recognize that reality is governed by fixed protocols of a prison - like containment field disguised as a universe. Human DNA is the transgenic combination of 66.6% terrestrial mammalian DNA and 33.3% Anunnaki DNA. 4309 BCE Anunnaki employ world - moving technology using the Phoenix Weapon resulting in a poleshift/or lithospheric displacement, oceans slip from the basins, widespread flooding, volcanism, wholesale destruction. No sun was seen in the sky at this time for it had not yet been \"born,\" according to the oldest traditions. The vault of the sky was a vapor canopy and the Ancients described it as like an ocean above. From the north pole extending across the world to 30 degrees south of the Equator the earth was froze, south of this marsupial and mammalian life forms thrived. Neanderthal in scattered groups survived as Cro - Magnon communities also lived, mostly in underground dwellings. 4309 BCE The Phoenix Weapon can no longer be regarded as a dead world on a highly elliptica l orbit for its reappearance in the month of May over and over again documented over thousands of years as it reappears every 138 years necessitates the existence of a controlled and local"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"phenomenon which is a part of the vast mechanism of the sky. The Phoenix Weapon protocol is known by its effect - population control, inducing retardation of human development, to destroy local and very enlightened populations or whole hemispheres, and in some few cases, the entire world. The reader who finished Chronic on from 5239 BCE all the way to 2040 CE will have no doubt that the Phoenix is an intelligently designed weapon hidden in our local sky to repeatedly maintain checks on human population levels, to destroy the works of men and intentionally BURY THEM IN MUD from the clear sky, to initiate arrested development and induce volcanic resurfacing which entombs prior land surfaces while also bringing to the surface harvestable deep - earth metals and minerals. The chief design of the Phoenix phenomenon is to mask th e abduction of human populations and materials from our world under the guise of natural disasters - the introduction of chaos to keep the humans victims ignorant that they are being harvested. 4309 BCE The Heliopolitan cosmology of Egypt as revealed in E dfu reliefs held that BEFORE the appearance of the NETERU [Ten Divinities started 3439 BCE to 2239 BCE, a dynasty of Ten Kings] the PN - god appeared in \"...some kind of violent conflict which brought to a close the first period of Creation. An enemy appear ed in the form of a serpent [Dragon] known as the Great Leaping One...as a consequence of this mass devastation the first inhabitants all die , and darkness returns to the world.\" (Gods of Eden: Collins 175) Egyptian tradition provides no date, but the PN - god is the same as the Phoen - deity, or the Phoenix. It brings death and decay and the earth vanishes into the watery NUN of Chaos and perpetual dark. (Gods of Eden: Collins 175) The PN - god is also called the Falcon and The Winged One (ibid p. 187), the Winged Disk of the Near East being the greatest symbol for Phoenix and the most widely misinterpreted symbol EVER. Throughout thousands of official translations and reference books in hundreds of languages for the last three centuries all so - called author ities claim the Winged Disk seen so prolifically throughout the reliefs and art of the ancient world was simply a symbol for the sun...an absolute LIE. We have unique confirmation of the PN - god association to the Phoenix from the ancient Sumerian astrono mical tablets. \"When APIN reaches the path of the sun, there will be a famine of cattle, there will be want. When a planet and APIN stand facing one another, there will be an invasion of the enemy.\" (The Reports of the Magicians and Astrologers p. liv) Translators are confused, some thinking that APIN is a ref. to Mars but in the same text Mars is affirmatively identified by them as Lul - a. (p. liv) The explanatory notes reveal that APIN appears three times and scholars were confused, thinking it was re ferring to Mars but the only association is that Mars is a red planet. The confusion was ancient, for the tablets under APIN even have explanatory notes. (p. liv) Heliopolis was the City of the Sun, a metropolis of learning with universities and libraries known to Greece, Anatolia, Ionia, Crete, Phoenicia, Canaan, Syria, Mesopotamia, Elam and India. In this City of the Sun in Egypt at an old temple was located the Mansion of the Phoenix, called benben, where astronomer - priests taught the Heliopolitan conc ept of reoccurring cycles of time connected to the archaic Bennu Bird, \"...the purple - plumed Phoenix of Greek tradition.\" (Gods of Eden: Collins 134, 150) The Bennu Bird was celestial and its appearance \"...signaled the"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"death of the First Time [Zep Tepi] , the Golden Age of the gods (5239 BCE to 4309 BCE) and the commencement of a New World Epoch.\" (Gods of Eden: Collins 150) Andrew Collins wrote that each time the Bennu Bird was seen to return over Heliopolis it marked the end of an Aeon and the commenc ement of the next. (ibid p. 150) 4309 BCE Harold Wilkins in his work, Mysteries of Ancient South America, wrote, \"Mr. H. S. Bellamy, an authority on myths of the Moon in the ancient world, supposes that the Book of Revelation...is really a history of the Great Cataclysm, and enshrines, in mystic and cryptic language, some ancient story of an earlier, pre - Lunar satellite of the earth approaching close to the earth.\" (p. 32) Bellamy cites the theory of Austrian engineer Hans Horbiger of Vienna - \"When the sa tellite drew near to the earth, it shown with a brilliant light reflected from the sun, falling on a thick coating of ice - the glaciosphere. This split and fell on the earth, exposing a layer of red earth, which, in turn, fell on the earth in a rain like blood .\" (ibid p. 32) Bellamy's pre - Lunar catastrophe was in 4309 BCE, for the Moon appeared in 4039 BCE. 4309 BCE Phoenix is a governor, a weapon on a planetary scale hidden in the sky, local and not revisiting our world every 138 years from some long impossible orbital journey, but activating when its designed programming protocols instruct it to. Every single appearance of the Phoenix t hat caused ruin and desolation throughout human history is perfectly found in the chronometrical measurements of the Great Pyramid of Giza in architectural features that NO OTHER pyramids in the world replicate. 4309 BCE The Phoenix Weapon destroyed a th riving human civilization and its survivors are known to us as Cro - Magnon, a human breed physically, mentally and genetically superior to any homo sapiens sapiens today. This began a 270 year darkness. 4040 BCE the temple of Dendera in Egypt was built b y the Ptolemys on the site of an older structure, the newer temple following the older plan which was built to commemorate ancient zodiacal knowledge. Admitting he does not know why, Paul A. LaViolette, Ph.D shows that the Dendera zodiac encodes in our ca lendar the date 4040 BCE. (Earth Under Fire p. 81) This is only 1 year off from the actual 4039 BCE date. 4039 BCE This event was 1200 years [600+600] Anunnaki Chronology and 600 years before the 3439 BCE appearance of the Watchers [Anunnaki] and 1200 years before the 2839 BCE start of the Nephilim Dynasty which was itself 600 years before the Great Deluge in 2239 BCE. 4039 BCE Throughout Chronicon will be revealed evidence that the Moon image in the sky is merely a picture and either does not exist materially or is a holographic camouflage disguising something else like an occupied superconstruction. 4039 BC is Anno Luna, or Year One of the Moon Chronology. Even as early as 1890 Alex Gleason noted that the Theory of Gravity does not explain the p erfect lunations of the Moon.

(p. 256) 4039 BCE The firstborn son of the Anunna god Enlil was Nannar, or Moon, where Sumerian texts reveal the god Enki obtained the seed material to make mankind. This seed was connected to a cataclysm involving the destruction of Tiamat. In the Near East after the Great Deluge [2239 BCE] the Moon was called Sin. (Our Occulted History 157 - 158) The oldest belief in recorded history concerning the origin of humanity holds that mankind came from the Moon. For this reason, after the Anunna civil war began, Sin [the Anunna occupants from the Moon] sided with the human benefactor Enki, which incited Enlil to declare that those who opposed him were Sinners ....or, of the Moon. (Our Occulted History p. 158) 4039 BCE Genesis 1:2 \"The spirit of God [Kneph=Phenc, or Phoenix] moved over the Deep (waters).\" This appearance of the Moon was 6 years before the appearance of Phoenix [Kneph] in 4033 BCE, this number, 6, being recorded in ancient Semitic traditions as being the stages of the Cr eation in 6 days, or cycles or years. 4039 BCE Ancient American cosmological beliefs held that in the beginning the god Huracan [origin of hurricane], a mighty god of wind, passed over the waters of Chaos in the form of a huge bird [Phoenix], thus bringi ng earth into being.

The date is 109 years off, like so many of Ussher's old world dates and the correct date is 3895 BCE - not for the Creation, but for the initiation of a New Calendar representing a New World postCataclym governing a new thing - modern humans.

The Fall of Man idea was an old Babylonian sin doctrine having been diffused in to many ancient religious faiths - strongly in Judaism, then Christianity. Sin was disobedience to the gods [Anunnaki]. The earliest Mesopotamian records relate that humanity was created to be a slave species, that present homo sapien sapiens was the last created of two or more trial species from distant antiquity. Velikovsky wrote that the Talmudic texts teach that the world was successively destroyed an d inhabited before Adam. (Space Travelers and the Genesis of the Human Form 61) When in the 6th - 5th centuries BCE the Jews came into contact with the magnificent and old libraries of Babylon they borrowed from chronological annals and composed their Gene sis, corrupting the original story of Eden. They invented Adam and Eve and wrote that by disobedience their eyes were opened - they were ashamed of their nakedness. But the true original records concerned the adamu which was a word for mankind and the rev olt of men against the Anunnaki taskmasters was due to his recognition of his slave status. (Gods of Eden: Brambly 38 - 49) Humans rebelled from the labor and escaped a walled enclosure [garden] and the Anunnaki promised that mankind would die. 3895 BCE Further evidence of Jewish manipulation of Babylonian date - annals concerns the rabbinical Book of Jasher. In Babylon the Jews read of a disaster and ominous 'darkening of the sun' at the death and banishment of the adamu, prompting the Jews to write in t heir narrative that at the death of Adam \"...the sun darkened.\" The Creation story and account of the Fall of Man involve the \"fiery revolving sword\" and cherub that appeared after mankind was cursed to die by the Elohim [gods:Anunnaki] contain elements o f an almost - forgotten cataclysm later moralized by Babylonian and Jewish religionists. Velikovsky in his manuscript, In the Beginning, demonstrates that the loss of Eden and curse concerns a major \"civilization - destroying catastrophe.\" Later the few surv ivors did not even know their own origin. (Space Travelers and the Genesis of the Human Form: 61) 3895 BCE the borrowing of Babylonian annals is most evident in the years assigned to the Great Flood (1656 AM:2239 BCE) and the great quakes of 2208 AM (1687 BCE), both disasters recording a strange darkening of the sun and both being 552 years apart. All three dates [3895,"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"2239, 1687 BCE] are 552 years apart or multiples of 552 years, being Phoenix destructions, and were used by the Jews to legitimize their forged histories. 3895 BCE The Eden story recalled in earlier times the appearance of a hero, benefactor, a figure who promised mankind that he would help, one who told early humanity the truth and informed them that their deceitful Anunnaki creators wou ld have exactly 6000 years [10 NER: Great Years] until they themselves were dealt with [Armageddon]. In Babylon the hero was Marduk, a late post - flood invention. Marduk rode upon the back of a cherub in his fight against Tiamat [dragon of disaster].

(ibid p. 98) This traumatic event, the serpent savior, are the origin of the later traditions of serpentlike men who led survivors after a catastrophe, like Cecrops of Athens (see 1687 BCE). 3895 BCE Almost a thousands years ago the Jewish commentator Rashi wrote about the Great Deluge, which we know positively occurred in 2239 BCE, and astonishingly, we find Rashi declaring that \". ..every 1656 years a similar disaster occurs.\" This identifies 3895 BCE as a \"similar disaster\" like the Deluge which almost totally depopulated the world. 3895 BCE Scientists note that during the last ice age the Mediterranean was dry land. (The Messa ge of the Sphinx p. 21) At depths of thousands of feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean are peculiar flat - topped mountains that could have only formed above sea level.

Our present equato r as we know it today was before May 3895 BCE actually the north - south axis. That North America was formerly buried under glacial masses and uninhabited is supported by Lewis Spence - \"Not only does America furnish no tangible evidence of antiquity so gre at as to support the theory of an independent origin for American man, but...all American aboriginal culture is classed as Neolithic, and there appears to be no evidence of Paleolithic life.\" (Atlantis in America: Spence 134) 3895 BCE Lithospheric displace ment, a shift of the crust of 30 - 45 degrees. The geographical distribution of the world's continental landmasses took on their present positions after the poleshift in May of this year. Prior to this date the continents were much larger and oceans smalle r and the north polar axis pointed at the star Alpha Draconis, the Eye of the Dragon. 3895 BCE This is the third known global catastrophe: (1) Nemesis Cataclysm pre - 5239 BCE; (2) Phoenix destruction of 4309 BCE; (3) 3895 BCE pole shift. The 4309 BCE Pho enix destruction ruined a thriving global civilization and scattered its survivors and the 3895 BCE pole shift being worse then BURIED THE EVIDENCE of this cataclysm beneath ice caps and oceans. 3895 BCE The pole shift event altering the topography and t he heavens as viewed by archaic people on earth was widely regarded later as Year One of the 1656 years of the recorded Antediluvian World, or 1656 years of human history before the Great Deluge in May 2239 BCE. This 3895 BCE Year One was also the start o f a 6000 year period to the prophesied formation of another New Heavens and New Earth to unfold in 2106 CE. Originally the Creation Event was not a creation at all, but a renovation from the ruins of a prior world but through time the religious authoritie s have altered the truth of cataclysm causing the appearance of a new heavens and new earth in the distant past and modelled their prophecies to fit this mold thus claiming that at the end of this 6000 year period a New Heavens will appear for a New Earth. ..but this will be due to a vast and violent catastrophic destruction just as it was in the past. 3895 BCE The displacement of the lithosphere was accompanied by the eruption of numerous volcanoes on land and undersea. As hundreds of magma domes blew open volcanic ash thickened an already water - enriched atmosphere. Intense volcanism saturated the vapor canopy with ambient radiation (see 1902 CE for modern example) that produced giantism among the fauna and flora. This newly formed vapor canopy from 4039 BCE and ambient radiation saturation of animals and vegetable worlds is the origin of the megafauna, the su dden appearance of gigantic mammalian and marsupial life forms in the archeological record. Prior to this cataclysm the world was dominated by marsupials. This giantism effect from ambient radiation was compounded by the greenhouse effect resulting a lev el of carbon monoxide much denser than today. This antediluvian atmosphere may have had as much as a thousand times more carbon dioxide as today. As plants thrive on carbon dioxide the flora would have been lush and prolific. (Flying Serpents and Dragon s p. 160) Plants and animals would have grown to"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"prodigous sizes as plants steadily absorbed carbon monoxide releasing oxygen in astounding quantities inhaled by fauna of gigantic sizes all exhaling carbon monoxide in a feedback loop that kept the world a t a tropical climate with minimal cooling at the poles. 3895 BCE Earth's vapor canopy [Firmament Above] of water and carbon dioxide produced a day time sky full of light but with no visible sun. The capture of long - wave radiation resulted in a greenhous e effect diffusing light and warmth into the polar regions creating a uniform temperature all year long. Summer and winter were not dissimilar and years were counted by stellar revolutions, diurnal motion observed at night around the pole star Alpha Draco nis. That Earth once had a vapor canopy like Venus has today is a theory put forth by Donald Patton in The Biblical Flood and the Ice Epoch . (Flying Serpents and Dragons p. 93) 3895 BCE The megafauna pose yet another irritation to establishment historian s. These enormous mammals were confidently assigned to an Ice Age period but it is now confidently concluded by meticulous analysis of preserved frozen mammoths, sabor - tooth cats, whooley rhinosaurus and other megafauna that these animals were NOT living in a frozen world but in a temperate - to - tropical environment when they were quick - frozen. That the Earth in times past was a glaciosphere of frozen wastes can not be disputed, but the vast durations of Ice Ages are a complete fiction. 3895 BCE The rise of the megafauna coincided with the decline of the marsupials which died out mostly. Australia is an isolated fossil - continent survivor of this cataclysmic displacement. Thousands of varieties of marsupials from pre - mammalian antiquity are lost but some survive, and almost all of them in Australia - the kangaroo, kangaroo - rat, wallaby, platipus, the flying fox, the dingo, tasmanean wolf, sloths, giant land birds (winged and wingless) like the emu, anteater (myrmecobius), wombat, flying phalanger, mole (notorycles), native cat (dasyyurus), mouse (dasycercus) - these scientific names are provided because these are unique marsupials having mammalian (placentals) counterparts. The emu and other giant land birds, marsupials and other peculiar fauna all p resently inhabiting the southern hemisphere are the survivors of the pre - Vapor canopy world. There were once massive land bridges connecting Australia, Madagascar, southern India, southern Africa and South America, a tropical continent known to have exist ed from the numerous specimens of flora and fauna found under the Antarctic icepack. Australia's great flightless bird, the emu, has its cousins only in the southern hemisphere [ancient pre - 3895 BCE equatorial continent]. The moa of New Zealand is one of the largest birds that ever existed, having no wings at all, a true biped, its feathers so primitive that they seem more like hairs. Some moas were 12 feet tall and they died out only very recently, within the last four centuries CE. (Lost Cities of Ancient Lemuria and the Pacific p. 155) The kiwi of New Zealand has hairy feathers and vestiges of wings; it is the only bird in the world its with nostrils at the end of its beak. (Lost Cities of Ancient Lemuria and the Pacific p. 155) As birds are DN A - modified lizards , the following fact concerning the New Zealand lizard tuatara is relevant. It is a unique lizard , the sole survivor of the order of rhynchocephalia, a lizard that antedates the dinosaurs. It is large at over 2 feet in length, olive g reen and has a vestige of a third eye atop its skull, the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"pineal eye. (Lost Cities of Ancient Lemuria and the Pacific p. 155) This southern hemispheric ecology is truly archaic , home to the tasselfish, or, coelacanth, an index fossil creature believed e xtinct 65 million years ago until the Japanese caught a living one. Primeval forms of marsupials once abounded in Europe but they are no longer there. South America, India and Australia are rife with marsupials today, and among reptiles the same are fou nd in Australia as in South America, and amphibian tree frogs of the same species are found only in Australia and Chili, South America. (Problem of Lemuria 166 - 168) Further, Professor Angelo Heilprin in 1887 wrote - \"The presence of lemurs on island of Ma dagascar , the continent of Africa and southern India (with Ceylon) has led some naturalists to the conclusion that at one time direct land connection existed between the several regions.\" (Problem of Lemuria 166 - 168) Lemurs are also on Australia. Lewis Spence also notes that the same species of freshwater fish are also distributed among these southern hemispheric regions. Captain Cook sailed into the Australian waters in 1770 CE documenting enormous saltwater crocodiles, giant sharks, huge ant and term ite mounds the height of a man. In 1966 Alan Moorehead wrote of Cook's expedition - \"They soon became aware that they were confronted here with something infinitely strange: an utter primitivism, wild creatures that had not developed beyond the marsupial s tage, plants that did not appear to fit into the Linnean or indeed any other system of classification, a nomadic people [Aborigines] who lived more like animals than men. It was as though they were looking straight back into the beginnings of Creation.\" (The Fatal Impact p. 118) Australia was never developed by men long ago, a continent absolutely devoid of any technolithic, heliolithic or otherwise megalithic or any ancient architecture. And as all rules are defined by their exceptions, so too does the opossum stubbornly defy the marsupial dominance of the southern hemisphere. The opossum thrives in North America, the last vestige of marsupials outside the southern hemisphere. (Lost Cities of Ancient Lemuria and the Pacific p. 96) It lives in North, Central and South America and NOWHERE in Europe, Asia or Africa. Prior to the cataclysm we can see that the distribution of surviving species of marsupials today that there had been a supercontinent, that Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, Southern Africa , South America, southern India had all been connected as ONE LANDMASS. Geologists have identified another landmass called the Miocene Bridge that merged the Americas to Europe and Asia. The pre - 3895 BCE world had major marsupial and megafauna - occupied t ropical landmasses where the North Atlantic ocean and southern Pacific Antartic oceans are located today. The megafauna survived the catastrophe but would over time after 3895 BCE gradually reduce in size closer to their present sizes. At this period in human history Neanderthal survivors were feral predators and colonies of Cro - Magnon also persisted, some interbreeding with the negroid, mongolid, amerindic and dark caucasoid humansat various stages of paleolithic, mesolithic and neolithic illiterate cult ures. We know humans hunted the megafauna for the spear points, arrowheads, and cut bones of ancient camps tell the tales, however, there are NO TRADITIONS passed down from antiquity concerning the megafauna - no legends, no ancestral memories of any peopl e in the world of animals being of such enormous sizes. This is simply because the megafauna diminished in size prior to the advent of literacy that exploded among the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"human population after 2239 BCE.

(Lost Cities of Atlantis, Ancient Europe...204 - 205) 3895 BCE Enki fathered civilized humans with experimentation and planning. But among the Anunnaki a controversy developed. A faction of the Anunna call ed the Igigi [Watchers] stationed offworld [Mars/Moon] revolted, descended to earth and abducted human females, producing monsters, giants, hybrids and even heroes. Humans were primitive workers, or, lulu. (The Lost Book of Enki p. 126) This protohuman was manufactured using primate mammalian eggs infused with Anunna DNA, many experiments having failed. The lulu was not able to produce. 3895 BCE Genesis 5:2 reads that God created man male and female, and called their name Adam. However, the original Hebrew differs, and itself was a corruption of what the Jews found in the older Babylonians tablet writings from which they heavily borrowed when writing Genesis. The original Babylonian text conveyed that the gods created mankind male and female and called them the Adamu. 3895 BCE This was an extinction level event for many species involving intense volcanism that saturated the marine water canopy above with ambient radiation that produced gigantism among surviv ing fauna and flora. The megafauna so well attested in worldwide archeological findings are the remains of the Antediluvian World. During this unstable period volcanic resurfacing, quakes, upheavals and subsidence and flooding produced over a dozen layer s of strata, each a testament to the violence of the time. The Geologic Column hypothesis holding that each deposit is hundreds of thousands to millions of years old is in error. As will be shown, homo sapiens remains have been found fossilized in strata concluded to be millions of years in age. Alluvial resurfacing has been observed in our life time to have produced more than one deposit from a single regional flooding. Establishment scientists desperate to foist natural selection and evolutionary mode ls over our concepts of the past merely contribute in burying evidence of our cataclysmic history - they are loathe to admit that Charles Darwin himself was a catastrophist, who wrote in 1834 - \"Certainly, no fact in the long history of the world is so start ling as the wide and repeated exterminations of its inhabitants.\" (Atlantis in America: p. 69 citing Journal, 1834) 3895 BCE Off the French Polynesian island of Rap Iti have been found undersea coal deposits, indicating that the Pacific basin was once dr y land.

Robert Temple wrote, \"...if ever anything argued the authenticity of their account, it was this Babylonian tradition that the amphibians to whom they owed everything were disgusting, horrible and loathesome to look upon.\" (ibid 278). Another of the Annedoti was Odacon, later to be known throughout the post - diluvian Near East as Dagon.

(ibid p. 264) Anunna brought livestock from their world to earth. They also brought cereals, the first grains. The existence of the cow is an anomaly. Such a defenseless, weak and slow creature would neve r had survived natural selection. The evolutionary model fails to account for the cow. The bovine could never have lived and evolved over eons with the world full of so many predatory species. The bovine owes his existence to a protective agency - humans . Civilized man learned husbandry, agriculture and became shepherds. As farmers they were the opposite of the hunter - gatherers who were nomads. Cotton plants are found growing in many parts of America in the wild, but never in the Old World. Cotton g rown in the Americas is superior to that of the India cotton of Asia and when American cotton is taken to India it grows into a poorer quality. Thus, it becomes evidence that cotton is native to America.

But in their explanatory notes they concede that the actual three thousand year old texts read Nibir u and Sagmigar, which was also Nibiru according to the ancient and modern translator. (The Reports of the Magicians and Astrologers p. lxvi) Here is the text with Nibiru where it belongs instead of the interpolated Jupiter references - \"When Nibiru grows bright, the king of Akkad will go to pre - eminence.

Herodotus was told by Egyptian priests that their written history dated back 11,340 years be fore his era. (Atlantis: The Antediluvian World 108) The Egyptians, as will be demonstrated elsewhere with proof, inflated their chronologies. The 11,340 years is actually 1134 years before their present era, not Herodotus's time. Egypt after the 2239 BCE Cataclysm began in 1898 - 1897 BCE, 1.5 years after the great Dispersion catastrophe known as the Babel Tower incident, a great dispersion of Aryan people in different directions mostly away from the Near East. Counting 1134 years from 3031 BCE is the F irst Year of Egypt after the Cataclysm, or 1897 BCE. The clever Egyptian deception is exposed by the next chronological fact given to Herodotus. The priests took him to a temple and showed him the statues of 341 high - priests who had in turn succeeded ea ch other. (Atlantis: The Antediluvian World 108) But these 341 statues did not represent men but years just as the great busts of Easter Island represented years (see 1687 BCE). This was 341 years, the precise duration from the Great Deluge Cataclysm 22 39 BCE to the founding of post - diluvian Egypt in 1898 BCE. Remember, the Genesis account reads that the Flood lasted almost an entire year, thus, 341 years ended in 1897 BCE. Ancient Sumerian and Babylonian temples had chambers with 360 statues represent ing the days of the year and Easter Island's engineers were attempting to commemorate the NER calendar of 600 year periods famous in antiquity when their project was violently ended in May 1687 BCE by Phoenix cataclysm. 2909 BCE Anunna kingship begins 6 70 years [241,200 days/shars] before the Flood of 2239 BCE, Anunnaki Dynasty beginning at Eridu with two kings lasting 180 years to 2729 BCE. 2852 BCE First Dynasty of China was of the Five Monarchs, in which there are actually nine rulers, a dynasty endu ring 646 years to 2206 BCE.

Noah was chosen to father a newer humanity after the Flood because his physical body was the result of an additional genetic modification - he had more Anunnaki blood than other humans, as evidenced by his brighter eyes and skin in the Apocryphon. Shemsu Hor were the Bronze Age Children of the Sun, a worldwide mariner dynasty with colonies spread abroad. 2839 BCE The Maya of central America maintained a sophisticated, l earned culture with historical records and traditions concerning a race of gods that manufactured humanity in a series of four stages in antiquity. The Church of Rome attempted to stamp out this knowledge but a text survived, The Popul Vuh of the Quiche M aya. (Atlantis in America p. 168) These four stages fit perfectly with the four Anunnaki NER epochs of 600 years each between 5239 to 4639 BCE, then to 4039 BCE, and 3439 BCE to the final in 2839 BCE when we have in that EXACT year the birth of Noah, the first appearance of white - skinned, blue - eyed humans among the indigenous dark - featured, smooth - skinned adamu, exactly 600 years before the Great Deluge in 2239 BCE. 2839 BCE Sumerian King - List reads that kingship was first lowered from heaven to the cit y of Eridu.

Learning from an old obscure book from 1827 written by George Higgins titled The Celtic Druids, Temple noted that Stonehenge and other British stone circles encoded a 60 - year period. (The Sirius Mystery p. 377) Citing Chinese historian Dr. Herbert Chatley, he notes that the 60 - year period venerated in early China found it's origin in the \"...era of 2637 BC.\" (ibid p. 382) While this dating is an ap proximate (era) attached to a definite (2637 BC), it lies but ten years after 2647 BCE when the Nibiru weapon exited the inner solar system. Plutarch wrote that the number 60 is the first of measures for such persons as concern themselves with the heavenl y bodies (ibid p. 383). The early Egyptians represented the 60 year period as a crocodile, an astronomical symbol. This vicious reptile is sacred in Egypt as a relic memory of the reptilian - amphibious Anunnaki who walked among men for a period of 60 year s on two separate occasions several centuries apart. Temple's conclusion is startlingly accurate, writing that the link between the crocodile symbol and 60 years \"...probably echoes an earlier association of that cycle with the amphibious aliens.\" (ibid p . 384) 2647 BCE The Mongols, Manchu and other Tartars of Asia had cycles of 60 years, divided into five 12 - year periods. (Atlantis: The Antediluvian World p. 121) 2647 BCE This is Exodus of Anunna, 792nd year, or 4896 months [2448+2448] before the Grea t Flood. After the Deluge in 2239 BCE, in the 792nd year afterward, the descendants of the Anunna, the Israelites [Amurru] would depart Egypt in a similar Exodus in 1447 BCE [2448 AM]. 2647 BCE begins the Abandonment & Shock Period which is 408 years to the Deluge. 2647 BCE Began Abandonment & Shock Period of 732 years no Anunna contact with humans. 2647 BCE Homo Anunna departed leaving behind Caucasian homo sapien specialists who preserved the knowledge of sophisticated technolithic quarrying, tra nsportation and dressing of stone but not their precision techniques. Humans continued to use Anunna hardware that had been left behind. Perhaps the left - behind materials were not a threat due to the known cataclysm soon to visit the world in 2239 BCE. 2647 BCE Shemsu Hor, or The Followers of Horus, according to Hancock and Bauval, followed after the Reign of the Gods in Egyptian prehistory - \"The Egyptians' own accounts also invite the conclusion that the role of these 'followers' may have been to carr y down the ages a body of extraordinary knowledge harking back to the even more mysterious 'Time of the Neteru' - i.e. the gods.\" (The Message of the Sphinx 193) Also, \"From available primary sources, in other"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"words, the overall picture that emerges is tha t the 'followers of Horus' may not have been 'kings' in the usual sense of the word but rather immensely powerful and enlightened individuals...at the sacred site of Heliopolis - Giza...\" (The Message of the Sphinx p. 193) Shemsu Hor had the gift of knowled ge. (The Message of the Sphinx p. 202) 2647 BCE The earliest surviving references to the Followers of Horus occur in the Pyramid Texts. (The Message of the Sphinx p. 202) Egyptologists conceded that these texts are merely transcripts of even older writings no longer extant. The scribes that copied th em often \"...did not understand the words they were copying.\" (ibid p. 345) Wallis E. Budge wrote, \"The Pyramid Texts are full of difficulties of every kind. The exact meanings of a large number of words found in them are unknown...the construction of t he sentence often baffles all attempts to translate it...contains wholly unknown words...\" (ibid p. 346) A mystery, ancient Egypt's records are descended from a more advanced literature that preceded it. Hancock and Bauval wrote - \"These Followers of Horu s bear with them a knowledge of Divine Origin.\" (ibid p. 213) 2647 BCE Egyptian traditions attribute the founding of Heliopolis to the Followers of Horus. (ibid 202) It would not have been called Heliopolis till after the Deluge, during the Heliolithic Period. 2647 BCE The Turin Papyrus: after Horus is listed the Shemsu Hor, called the Ancestors, or Sages, Ghosts [white], the Followers of Horus, a semi - divine race who \"..the Egyptians remembered as having bridged the gap between the time of the gods and the time of Menes.\" (The Message of the Sphinx p. 209) This was 749 years [7x7x7 years] to 1899 BCE. 2647 BCE Shemsu Hor also called the Akhu. They reigned 13,420 years. (The Message of the Sphinx p. 209) Hancock nor Bauval, perhaps not wanting t o address the obvious racial references, did mention that in the Turin Papyrus the Followers of Horus were by the darker native Egyptians called \"ghosts,\" and this is significant. Ghosts are luminous, white, and the same description was given to Captain C ook and his English sailors when he made first contact with the Aborigines of Australia. Cook marveled that the Aborigines in fear averted their eyes and learned later that it was because the natives thought they were ghosts. They had never seen white - sk inned people and Cook's party were thought to have been the dead walking among them so they maintained a respectful silence waiting for them to leave. That the Shemsu Hor were racial outsiders with bright skin unlike the darker natives of the Nile valley is proven in the title given to the Followers of Horus, called Akhu, meaning shining ones . (The Mystery of the Sphinx 209) A racial description of Caucasian people by a dark - skinned race. Throughout the annals and traditions of antiquity we find this o ver and over - that nonCaucasian peoples perfectly described white - skinned visitors with a superior technology and knowledge of the sciences that has been misinterpreted over and over in modern times as the appearance of \"gods\" or aliens on ancient earth. 2647 BCE Ignatius Donnelly in Atlantis: The Antediluvian World , wrote that the Indo - European (Caucasian/Aryan) center of government before the Flood was Sippara, known as the City of the Sun, according to Berossus.

No, the Shemsu Ho r were of Egypt, a Caucasian race, called Children of the Sun after the Flood after the collapse of the vapor canopy [birth of the sun]. The Sumerians received disaster refugees in the form of a people far superior to themselves and the naming of a settle ment as Sippara was actually the borrowing from the original Saqqara of Egypt. Just as the Greek colony of Thebes and Abydos were originally places in Egypt brought to Europe by way of fleets. The racial group referred to as the Children of the Sun bega n at Sippara, known as Sakkarah, in Egypt before the Flood. However, it was only after the deluge that they were known by this appellation. The oldest traditions of Khemet [pre - Dynastic Egypt] hold that it was a matriarchal goddess - worshipping culture. (Mushrooms and Mankind p. 51) 2647 BCE Rob Skiba in Archon Invasion holds that the words, \"...after that,\" in Genesis 6:4 \"...is a reference to something that occurred shortly after the events of Genesis 6:1 - 3 and entirely in a preflood context. The syn chronized, biblically - endorsed, extrabiblical texts become quite useful at this point in helping us to understand what is really being said here. Moreover, those texts lead us into an understanding that there was actually a return of the Nephilim before t he Flood. (Archon Invasion p. 75) The Jubilees text reads that the Watchers descended in the 10th Jubilee [456 Annus Mundi is 3439 BCE] in days of Jared, and descended again in the 25th Jubilee [1248 Annus Mundi is 2647 BCE]. This rabbinical text dates t he first and second descent perfectly with the 3439 BCE and 2647 BCE appearances of Nibiru. 2647 BCE After departure of Homo Anunna their Caucasian descendants maintained the infrastructure of civilization from ANNU [later called Heliopolis/On] in Egypt. The Giza Complex was abandoned, sealed, declared a santuary and guarded against disturbance. Additionally, groups of the Shemsu Hor traveled to distance regions building colonies. At this time humans of all races priorly enslaved by the Anunna were productive in employing their knowledges acquired under indenture to the construction of megalithic cities, quays, ports, canal works, fortifications, terraced landscapes, all built using abandoned or stolen Anunna techn ology. A number of new cites now world - famous were begun in proximity of older technolithic architecture originally built by Homo Anunna. Examples - > The enormous blocks of andesite lava in South America are articulated with such incredible precisi on with myriads of planes, indentations, grooves and intricate keystone cuts that the conclusion is incontestable...these blocks are technolithic, machined to precision and could only have served a very specific mechanical function. One is reminded of the technolithic Grand Gallery with its obvious engineering function. > Kashmir in Tibet: megalithic ruins of a temple called Parshaspur outside Srinagar, a scene of total destruction, huge blocks of stone are scattered about a wide area exhibiting ev idence of an intense explosion.

(Atlantis: The Antediluvian World p. 84) This 4008 years is inflated, either arbitrarily or by mistranslation, from 408 years, from 2647 to 2239 BCE. 2647 BCE Egypt, Indus Valley and China are all aligned at 30 degrees latitude north of the equator, all three being preflood civilizations.

This idea is supported by fact that Nazca lines are discovered extending all the way to Tiahuanacu where the famous Gate of the Sun shows a human leader crying tears while offering up the symbols of kingship to 48 'gods' [winged figures] who have ascended.

Thus, the surface area of the ground cove red by the Cahokia Mound is vast, a bit smaller than the Great Pyramid of Egypt. The number of monuments left behind by the Mound Builders is extraordinary numerous. In Ohio alone there are more than 10,000 tumuli and from 1000 to 1500 enclosures. Thei r mounds were not cones, but four - sided pyramids. And like the Giza pyramids, their faces corresponded to the four cardinal directions.

Following rivers they reached into Oregon. (Atlantis: The Antediluvian World 230) This implies that the Mound Builders came from the Gulf of Mexico. Mound Builders mined copper but did not manufacture bronze. The copper mines on the shore of Lake Superior had been worked by them.

As will be shown hereafter, the knowledge of Phoenix was only in the possession of Caucasian people and its timing was weap onized to invoke fear in enemy hosts when Caucasian military operations were planned in advance of a Phoenix appearance. Sitchin paints a picture of Anunna fleeing earth in spacecraft, horrified at having to abandon humanity to such a fate [coming catacl ysm]. The problem with this scenario is the dearth of evidence that by this date in the Post - Technolithic Period, or Abandonment & Shock Period leading up to 2239 BCE that there were any Anunna with technological ships intact or even present. The last do cumented presence of Anunna/Anunnaki was in their mass exodus in 2647 BCE due to cataclysm and appearance of Nibiru. There is more evidence of the Anunna vanishing into underground facilities and whole multi - level subterranean cities than any one ever dep arting this world for the skies. These immense underground cities have been found in the dozens in Turkey, the first excavated in 1962 CE. Others found in South America and another kept very secret in the Grand Canyon of North America. The Matsya Puran a account holds that the Deluge occurs at the end of an age , a Yuga.

Beneath the eclipse symbols is Old Woman Goddess, patroness of death and destruction, holding a bowl from which a flood pours. (Earth Under Fire p. 287) The high antiquity of the symbols and motifs used in the Book of Revelation concerning the future Last Days apocalyptic events is seen here in the ancient American concept of floods causing ruination by the pouring of a bowl...th e Bowls of Wrath and flooding also found in Revelation. The Mayan book Chilam Balams preserved in the Maya language, in Latin reads of a fiery rain that fell with ash. Trees fell and rocks crashed about. The Great Snake was torn from the sky [pole star A.

The liquid was a flood and following this catastrophe writing was introduced into Egypt. This Sekhmet tradition is from the indigenous population of Nort h Africans living a Neolithic life along the banks of the Nile long after the civilized builders of Giza, Abydos and other sites departed about a thousand years earlier.

Two titles for one of the Ogdoad was The Far Distant and the Sailor. (Origin of Biblical Traditio ns p. 176) These were very old titles for the Flood Hero. In Sumer the hero of the Deluge was Utnapishtim, called The Far Away, and the earliest Greeks called him Deucalion, or New Wine Sailor. 2239 BCE Jim Marrs in Our Occulted History (2013) wrote - \"Scattered archeological excavation over many years indicate that what is regarded as the Great Flood was a planetwide catastrophe, though not every portion of the world went underwater...the kinds of conditions we might expect from a large planetary body passing by the earth.\" (Our Occulted History p. 152) Ivar Zapp and George Erikson in 1998 wrote that the near - miss of a large astronomical body would first set the sky on fire, initiating high winds. The intense heat at high altitude would result in a lo wer surface level loss of oxygen - hundreds of millions of life forms would have suffocated. (Atlantis in America p. 111) This was the fate of the megafauna, to suffocate, to be torn and tossed about by gales and then to float in bloated masses in a flood in tangled heaps in topsoil and permafrost.

The particulars of the flood accounts are too exact, precise parallels are found on continents separated by oceans among people speaking different languages. The parallels are so precise on a global scale that the serious antiquarian can only conclude that the story of the Great Flood destroying all humanity save a man and a woman in a ship full of animals and family members was a specific story spread around the world in a syllabus by a mariner - missionary culture after the actual event. The synchronicities between flood versions in opposite hemispheres could never have resulted from individual memories. The story we have passed down from us in all its variant veins was one that was taught over a long peri od of time to the unlettered Neolithic peoples after coming in contact with civilizers. 2239 BCE The Flood occurred in the reign of Yau of China.

It was constructed of sandstone and andesite blocks up to 27 feet long and 300 tons. The structure was destroyed in an earthquake of epic proportions. Puma Punka con struction was long before Tiahuanacu. At this time Tiahuanacu was not built, and the city was of inferior building techniques than Puma Punka with its clamps and geometric designs precisely cut into the andesite.

Those mountains were created by cataclysm - the whole South American continental plate was elevated thousands of feet in the geologic upheaval later to oc cur in 1687 BCE. The massive blocks of Puma Punka are scattered about like children's blocks but nearby Tiahuanacu's are not. (Lost Cities and Ancient Mysteries of South America p. 139) Puma Punka is not only older than Tiahuanacu, but its building met hods were technolithic, dating it from 3439 - 2647 BCE during the Contact Period. Christopher Dunn, British engineer, has found surfaces on stone at Puma Punka to be 5/1000ths of an inch accurate; meaning, that the flatness of the surface deviates only that little bit from being perfect. (Crimson Horizon: Rapa Nui: Navel of the World) Tiahuanacu on the other hand is not technolithic, not even post - technolithic [2647 - 2239 BCE], but entirely of the Heliolithic Period [2239 - 1687 BCE]. Puma Punka was a Homo Anu nna site laid waste at the Great Deluge when the \"foundations of the earth shook,\" and the site was held in such high regard that later Tiahuanacu was built near its ruins shortly afterward. 2239 BCE In Canons of the Chinese Emperor Yao, we read, \"In th e life time of Yao, the sun did not set for ten full days and the entire land was flooded.\" (Lost Cities of Ancient Lemuria and the Pacific p. 93) The Flood of Deucalion and Pyrrha tradition very prominent in Thessaly.

A superheated crust evaporated the water and deposits were baked into the strata according to weight and density.

The sudden incursion of 100 foot high walls of foaming sea water drowned over 200 cities and the floods like fingers races through the lowlands cutting of f the escape of untold myriads of communities. Only birds crowding the skies in the west gave any warning that death was approaching. By the time they heard the distant roaring of the raging deluge as it moved hundreds of miles per hour it was too late t o attempt escape. Whole occupied lands were submerged as Sardinia and Corsica with Sicily were separated from the Italian - Tunisian land bridge that vanished under the new surf totally isolating Malta. The Atlantic seawater walls spread over northern Afri ca as quakes caused a subsidence that sank the Giza Complex pyramids below the surface of the newly formed Mediterranean. The quake that broke the Gibraltar wide open may be the same as that which lowered the Delta region of northern Egypt. The walls of water pushed northward through the Aegean creating thousand of islands, the force of the world's entire sea - level pushing the Atlantic onward to penetrate the Dardanelles and create the Sea of Marmara before busting through the Bosporus land - bridge with vi olence to fill the freshwater Pontus Lake in the creation of the Black Sea. This is where William Ryan, Walter Pitman and Ian Wilson's research enlightens us while also committing chronological blasphemy. These men put forth the theory of the Black Sea F lood being that of Noah's Flood though they are all unaware that the Atlantic's flooding to create the Mediterranean and Aegean seas is what also created the Bl ack Sea.

Ian Wilson in Before the Flood cites Diodorus S iculus concerning a reference to flooding in the Aegean that separated Samothrace from the mainland leaving it an island when the Great Pontus Lake was over flooded. (Before the Flood 155 - 157) Wilson notes that to Diodorus the flooding of Samothrace in t he Aegean and that of Pontus Lake were contemporaneous, separated only by the Dardanelles and Bosporus. Wilson, Ryan and Pitman are aware that the Mediterranean - Aegean broke through the Bosporus to flood the Black Sea but they are unaware that in 5600 BCE there were no saltwater Mediterranean or Aegean seas, only scattered freshwater lakes. There model would push back the construction of the 200+ cities deep beneath the surface of today's Mediterranean to a time before 5600 BCE and this is untenable. Wil son notes that - > American Bob Karlin aboard research vessel Knorr found evidence of a one - time massive underwater sedimentary avalanche at the location where the Bosporus joins the Black Sea. (Before the Flood 45 ) > Scientific evidence shows a rap id transformation from a freshwater lake to a larger saltwater sea.

Ian Wilson supports this 5600 BCE date by the official - but - ridiculous date of Catal Huyuk, a site known to have 14 levels of occupation built one on top of the other suggesting about a thousand years of settlement. (Before the Flood 109) Catal Huyuk is not as old as publicized. It was buried after it was abandoned and in 1961 - 1965 CE excavations at the site by Mellaart uncovered surprisingly good sanitation, a well - ordered refuse system, white plastered walls painted with abstract, textile - type designs (Before the Flood 111), landscape painti ngs (112), breeding and domestication of bovines (114), use of wheat and barley to bake bread (115), crafting baked clay statuettes, one of a woman wearing a very brief miniskirt, blouse with shoulder straps (115), also basketry and exceptional wood crafti ng (117), pottery (117), use of polished obsidian mirrors and boring holes through small beads as well as the art of metallurgy.

Ian Wilson shows how at Catal Huyuk the Great Mother Goddess was worshipped and the Bull Cult flourished.

(Before the F lood 123) The goddess - between - two - leopards motif was specifically a post - diluvian symbol known widely throughout excavated Near East sites that date to about 2000 BCE, not 5600 BCE, an absurd dating especially because Wilson also cites the 1968 CE discove ry of archeologist Paul Lapp who found at Taanach in northern Israel an 11th century BCE artifact depicting the goddess Astarte frontally naked between two lions beside a young bull. Wilson notes the association to Catal Huyuk's Mother Goddess. (Before th e Flood 254) This leap of 4600 years passes through 35 centuries for which we have archeological data and wherein are found no Great Mother Goddess between leopards artifacts. Wilson seems to recognize this major distance in time in his bibliographic not e for Chapter 10 #4, writing, \"After the desertion [Catal Huyuk]...the sixth millennium BC there follows a long period for which the record remains a blank.\" (Before the Flood 290) The record has never been blank. Nothing has been found in confirmation o f this cult's high antiquity reaching to 5600 BCE because the civilizations that revered the Great Mother Goddess did not even develop until after a widespread awakening post - 3439 BCE. Wilson further provides more evidence that Catal Huyuk nor the Black Sea flood occurred so early. In Before the Flood he notes the similarities between Catal Huyuk and the Minoan civilization of Crete. The Minoans were a cattle people who worshipped the Great Mother Goddess; were adherents of the Bull Cult and prior to the discovery of Catal Huyuk the Minoans were virtually the first known people to paint their walls with landscapes, and to plaster them. (Before the Flood 145 ) Ironically, Wilson further notes that 4000 years separated his dating of Catal H uyuk and the height of Minoan culture. (Before the Flood 146) Even the horned shrines of the Minoans were identical to those of Catal Huyuk. (Before the Flood 146) And these are similar even to those horned facades found on Malta where images of the sam e fat Great Mother Goddess were also found. (Before the Flood 148) He also notes that the labyrinthine interior of the Hypogeum on Malta is very similar to the layout of Catal Huyuk. (148) The widespread Bronze Age motif of the double - ax, or labrys, has been found at both Catal Huyuk and Minoan Crete. (Elder Gods in Antiquity p. 176) All of these examples and more infer the two cultures were contemporary and that the Minoan chronology is the correct while the Catal Huyuk is pure fancy. As the Minoan ci vilization dates to about 2500 - 1447 BCE and Malta was destroyed by the Mediterranean flood itself in 2239 BCE, Wilson's own arguments contradict his 5600 BCE dating of both the Black Sea flood and the antiquity of Catal Huyuk. NO HUMAN ARCHITECTURE has ev er been found dating to the 4th, 5th or 6th millennium BCE. Not even Gobleki Tepe dates to the 5th millenium BCE.

(Secret Cities of Old South America 281) The Jewish authors of Genesis and the Old Testament altered a very important element of the ancient Flood story. In Genesis it is Almighty God who destroyed the world in a Flood, but this was a 6th - 5th century BCE monotheistic invention. All historical Flood records of Sumer and Babylonia of the early - to - later 2nd millennium BCE relate that the Anunnaki gods tried to exterminate mankind. (Gods of Eden: Bramb ley p. 46) In all his acts, Enki was against the Anunnaki, ever in favor of humanity. Anunnaki gods are The Seven, though only six are ever named. (Doctrine of Sin in the Babylonian Religion 10 - 12) In connection to them, \"...perhaps forming the unknow n seventh of the group, is the Sedu. But little is known of him.\" (p. 13) This deity is origin of biblical deity named El Shaddai, later said in the Bible to be the title of Yahweh, or Jevovah. The Sumerian ideogram for Sedu was ALAD. (Doctrine of Sin in Babylonian Religion 25) In the 6th - 5th centuries BCE the Jewish scholars exiled in Babylonia learned in the old libraries two very widely - known things about the Ancient World. They discovered in text after text that the PreFlood World was exactly 1656 years in duration and that during this period there was a magnificently powerful ten king dynasty that ended at the Deluge.

Such longevity in old records is reserved only to the Anunnaki \"gods\" and their progeny like Gilgam esh/Nimrod and other Nephilim. No other texts antedating the 6th century BCE claim any unusual longevity for ordinary mortals. Noah is no exception. Many traditions concern a flood survivor and ark builder, however, none attribute to him any unusual lon g life. Pure Jewish fiction. Two genealogies in Genesis - a Ten Patriarchs line beginning with Adam and the Eight Patriarchs beginning with Cain - mere Jewish inventions modelled after the Babylonian documented histories of a Ten King Dynasty and an Eight King Dynasty both found mentioned in Sumerian tablets and prisms. Hipparchus published a catalogue of 1080 fixed stars.

DAYS, not years, were calculated in the time of the antediluvian world. In the Epic of Gilgame sh we read - \"As for mankind, numbered are his days.\" (Our Occult History 148) 2239 BCE Popul Vuh on the cataclysm - \"Then the waters were agitated by the will of the Heart of Heaven, and a great inundation came upon the heads of these creatures...they were engulfed , and a resinous thickness descended from heaven...the face of the earth was obscurred. ..\" (Atlantis: The Andes Solution: p. 55) HEART is RED of Heaven, like Phoenix. Resinous thickness is common theme. Chronologist Alex Gleason in 1890 wrote that the Flood occurred in the 1656 th year.

Had the Genesis text read that Enoch lived 360 years we would have direct evidence that the narrative of Genesis was indeed composed before 713 BCE, the year the solar period was altered from 360 days to 365.25 days a cycle/year.

Collins relents that the old tower and wall of Jericho might be contemporaneous with the oldest settlement of Gobekli Tepe. (p. 363) In 1875 CE was rediscovered a 4th century BCE text called Vaimanika Sastra by Bharadvajy the Wise, in a temple in India. The text deals in the operation and maintenance of the vimana aircraft, data on steering, precautions for long flights and how to swit ch the drive to solar energy. (Lost Cities of China, Central Asia...242) Bharadvajy refers to no less than 70 authorities and ten experts on air travel, sources now lost. Vimanas were used in warfare, sport and travel. (Lost Cities of China, Central As ia...242) The existence of flying vimanas in antiquity would solve many technolithic, post - technolithic and Heliolithic architectural mysteries, i.e. megalithic block quarrying and transportation, the existence of precision - engineered technical megaliths that appear to have served no other function that aerial docking platforms such as Puma Punka and the hundreds of isolated marae platform flat pyramidal structures spread across the Pacific on myriads of uninhabited islands. These would now be regarded a s stop - overs in the ocean for long transcontinental flights. Also explained would be the very old tree - covered effigy mounds of North Africa and Nazca lines and the effigies of South America - all only visible from a very high altitude. Further it is to b e noted that Zeppelin - like airships are depicted on pottery found at Nazca. (Lost Cities of China, Central Asia...242) Irish annals tell that their island was settled prior to the Flood. (Atlantis: The Antediluvian World 251) Irish civilization is an cient with detailed traditional histories spanning back to early Bronze Age and monumental complexes like Newgrange but absolutely no accounts of the people dying off in the Great Flood. (Atlantis: The Antediluvian World 254) It is widely known that the Welsh, Scots and Irish all maintain several flood traditions of the submersion of cities, the intrusion of the sea, overflooding of lakes - \"...memories of some far - distant catastrophe which overtook the Celtic race in another environment. \" (The History of Atlantis: Spence p. 128) The Bronze Age necessitates a period of time before tin was added to nine - parts copper to manufacture bronze. Lord Avebury notes that Europe contains no evidence of a Copper Age, or"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"ancient use of tin. Bronze was introduced into continental Europe. (Atlantis: The Antediluvian World 289) Almost all archeological evidence of a European Copper Age art found exclusively in Ireland. It is to be recalled that the famously ancient Round Towers of Ireland are not to be found in contin ental Europe either. Copper Age archeological findings are greatest in the very ancient Americas , from Bolivia in South America to Lake Superior in North America. Concerning the Americas, Donnelly wrote - \"...we find everywhere the traces of a long - enduri ng Copper Age.\" (Atlantis: The Antediluvian World 290) Though bronze is found in the Americas, due to scarcity of tin or lack of knowledge, the specimens are few and could be introductions from abroad. The Druids believed in books more ancient the the Fl ood, called The Books of Pheryllt. (Atlantis: The Antediluvian World 303) Arnobius of Sicca in Africa of the 4th century CE wrote in his First Book - \"...ransack the records of historywritten in various languages, and you will find that all countries have often been desolated and deprived of their inhabitants. Every kind of crop is consumed, and devoured by locusts and by mice: go through your own annals and you will be taught by these plague s how often former ages were visited by them, and how often they were brought to the wretchedness of poverty. Cities shaken by powerful earthquakes totter to their destruction: what! Did not bygone days witness cities with their populations engulfed by h uge rents of the earth?\" (The History of Atlantis: Spence p. 32) Lewis Spence thought that The Popul Vuh was a monument of very considerable antiquity. (The Popul Vuh: Spence p. 30) Ancient Aztec Goddess of Maize was Chicomecohuatl [Seven Serpents]. (Th e Popul Vuh p. 90) In the earliest texts of the Rig - Veda the statement is made by the priests that\"...we created the gods.\" (Lords of the Left - Hand Path p. 23) Stephen E. Flowers, Ph.D, in Lords of the Left - Hand Path, wrote that a belief in a divine ances try is a common Indo - European tradition. .\" (Lords of the Left - Hand Path p. 64) Sumerian birth - goddesses were producing sapient clones. Humans are the only mammals/placentals requiring assistance at birth. Umbilical cords must be cut and tied in human s but other mammals are born with sack membranes. The intricacy of dealing with the umbilical cord completely defies the notion of an evolutionary development. Originally, Sumerian was pictographic, like the early hieroglyphs of Egypt and China. (Flying Serpents and Dragons p. 56) AKER lions or guards of Egypt to underworld from which derived the Greek Acheron, was originally Sumerian, the E - KUR, or, House on the Mountain.

(Flying Serpents and Dragons p.110) Sumerian name for man was lulu, or large sheep . Lu was sheep. (Flying Serpents and Dragons p. 158) ZI in Sumerian is city. Zion is thus rendered as City of On [ANNA] in Egypt near the Great P yramid. Zion would be a Semitic permutation of the Sumerian description. (Flying Serpents and Dragons p. 180) EKUR is Sumerian for artificial mountain . (Flying Serpents and Dragons p. 187) Religionists are conditioned to believe that truths are conveyed to them by their faith in their holy books, but this is patently untrue. Every religion on this planet is but a layer to a blinding filter designed to conceal facts in the guise of fictive narratives. ADAM is derived from red earth . (Atlantis: The Ante diluvian World p. 146) Semitic and Aryan languages are inflected , not agglutinative like Sumerian. (Flying Serpents and Dragons p. 54) Only the south of Pakistan is megalith rich. (Lost Cities of China, Central Asia...38) The southern third of India is megalith rich, very few in the north. (Lost Cities of China, Central Asia...38) This denotes a vast separation between two lands having lots of megalithic monuments, southern Pakistan and southern India. Between them the region is void of these structu res. Australia has no megalithic architecture, but hundreds of pacific islands do. The topograghy of Australia.s deserts, plains and mountains appears to have once been vast ocean bed. It's geological peculiarities, such as Ayers Rock as well as its im mense stretches of barreness have the characteristics of formations that developed deep under water. Sanskrit is alphabetic. Chinese is logographic. Western Sahara used to be a large lake, or the Triton Sea. In central Algeria are petroglyphs on cliffs of water animals.

(Lost Cities of North, Central and South America p. 34) The cactus is strictly an American plant. (Lost Cities of North, Central and South America p. 59) In 1936 CE Tom Kenny of Plateau Valley, Color ado dug a cellar and at a depth of ten feet he unearthed a smooth pavement made of ancient hand - crafted tiles. In the same geological layer were found the fossils of the three - toed Miocene Horse. (Lost Cities of North and Central America p. 511) Strangel y, a similar scenario unfolded in Blue Lick Springs, Kentucky where workmen unearthed the bones of a mastodon at a depth of 12 feet, but three feet deeper they uncovered a broad stone pavement made of well - cut and neatly fitted stone slabs. (ibid p. 511 - 5 12) In 1880 CE an article was published in the Leadville, Colorado newspaper that was picked up and published as far as New York. Two prospectors named Jacob Cahee and Louis Adams discovered an irregular - shaped cave 240 feet long and 180 feet wide while s inking a shaft 30 feet down. In this cavern they found a buried sailing craft oddly tilted forward 15 degrees that was constructed of short planks of dark wood using octogonal - head hard copper nails. Both ends of the ship curled up as if it was designed to sail forward or backward. A copper relic had 26 characters that resembled Chinese hieroglyphs. (Lost Cities of North and Central America p. 472 - 473) The ship was found at high altitude in the Colorado Rockies, and David Hatcher Childress wrote - \"It w ould be an artifact from an antediluvian time, trapped in a cataclysmic upheaval that created at least a portion of the Rocky Mountains.\" (Lost Cities of North and Central America p. 474) The Los Angeles News in September, 1870 CE in the article, Interesti ng Discovery, decalred that the Yuma desert was once a sea, that local indians found an ancient wooden ship embedded in the sands of the desert. A third of the vessel protruded from the sands. The arid heat had preserved the teak timbers and indian guide s brought Americas to inspect it. (Lost Cities of North and Central America p. 521) Turin Papyrus reads that Thoth ruled 3126 years.

(The Message of the Sphinx p. 211) George Syncellus wrote of six gods or six dynasties of gods who reigned 11,985 years. (The Message of the Sphinx p. 212) Diodorus wrote that entire history of Egypt from the reign of the gods to the last mortal king of Egypt was 23,000 yea rs. (The Message of the Sphinx p. 212) The gods and the Shemsu Hor ruled for a little less than 18,000 years of this 23,000 years, mortals ruling for about 5000 years.
