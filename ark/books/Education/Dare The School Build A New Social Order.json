Faced with any difficult problem of life we set our minds at rest sooner or later by the appeal to the school . We are convinced that education is the one unfailing remedy for every ill to which man is subject, whether it be vice, crime, war, poverty, riches, injustice, racketeering, political corruption, race hatred, class conflict . or just plain original sin . We even speak glibly and often about the general reconstruction of society through the school . e cling to this ai n spite of the fact that the very period in which our troubles have mul- tiplied so rapidly has witnessed an unprece- dented expansion of organized education . This would seem to suggest that our schools, in- stead of directing the course of change, are themselves driven by the very forces that are transforming the rest of the social order . The bare fact, however, that simple and un- sophisticated peoples have unbounded faith in education does not mean that the faith is un- tenable . History shows that the intuitions of 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"such folk may be nearer the truth than the weighty and carefully reasoned judgments of the learned and the wise . Under certain con- ditions education may be as beneficent and as powerful as we are wont to think . But if it is to be so, teachers must abandon much of their easy optimism, subject the concept of educa- tion to the most rigorous scrutiny, and be pre- pared to deal much more fundamentally, real- istically, and positively with the American so- cial situation than has been their habit in the past . Any individual or group that would as- pire to lead society must be ready to pay the costs of leadership : to accept responsibility, to suffer calumny, to surrender security, to risk both reputation and fortune . If this price, or some important part of it, is not being paid, then the chances are that the claim to leader- ship is fraudulent . Society is never redeemed without effort, struggle, and sacrifice . Au- thentic leaders are never found breathing that rarefied atmosphere lying above the dust and smoke of battle . With regard to the past we always recognize the truth of this principle, but when we think of our own times we pro- fess the belief that the ancient roles have been reversed and that now prophets of a new age receive their rewards among the living . That the existing school is leading the way 4 to a better social order is a thesis which few informed persons would care to defend . Ex- cept as it is forced to fight for its own life during times of depression, its course is too serene and untroubled . Only in the rarest of instances does it wage war on behalf of prin- ciple or ideal . Almost everywhere it is in the of conservative forces and is serving the cause of perpetuating ideas and institutions suited to an age that is gone . But there is one movement above the educational horizon which would seem to show promise of genuine 0 and creative leadership . I refer to the Pro- gressive Education movement . Surely in this union of two of the great faiths of the Ar .2er- ican people, the faith in progress and the faith in education, we have reason to hope for light and guidance . ere is a movement which would seem t~_o - Mpletel evo e 'to the promotion of social welfare t hrough educa- Even a casual examination of the program \t ' and philosophy of the Progressive schools, however, raises many doubts in the mind . To be sure, these schools have a number of large achievements to their credit . They have fo- cused attention squarely upon the child ; they .~ have recognized the fundamental importance of the interest of the learner ; they have de- o 5"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"fended the thesis that activity lies at the root of all true education ; they have conceived learning in terms of life situations and growth of character ; they have championed the rights of the child as a free personality . Most of this is excellent, but in my judgment it is not enough . It constitutes too narrow a concep- tion of the meaning of education ; it brings into the picture but one-half of the landscape . If an educational movement, or any other movement, calls itself progressive, it must have orientatio n ; it must possess direction . The word itself implies m oving forward, and mov- ing forward can have little meaning in the ab- sence of clearly defined purposes . W e cannot, like Stephen Leacock's horseman, dash off in all directions at once . Nor should we, like our presidential candidates, evade every disturb- ing issue and be all things to all men . Also we must beware lest we become so devoted to mo- tion that we neglect the question of direction and be entirely satisfied with movement in circles . Here, I think, we find the fundamental weakness, not only of Progressive Education, but also of American education generally . Like a baby shaking a rattle, we seem to be utterly content with action, provided it is sufficiently vigorous and noisy . In the last analysis a very large part of American educational thought, inquiry, and experimentation is much ado about nothing . And, if we are permitted to push the analogy of the rattle a bit further, our consecration to motion is encouraged and supported in order to keep us out of mischief . At least we know that so long as we thus busy ourselves we shall not incur the serious dis- pleasure of our social elders . The weakness of Progressive Education thus lies in the fact that it has elaborated no theory of social welfare, unless it be that of anarchy or extreme individualism . In this, of course, it is but reflecting the viewpoint of the members of the liberal-minded upper middle class who send their children to the Progres- sive schools-persons who are fairly well-off, who have abandoned the faiths of their fathers, who assume an agnostic attitude towards all important questions, who pride themselves on their open-mindedness and tolerance, who fa- vor in a mild sort of way fairly liberal pro- grams of social reconstruction, who are full of good will and humane sentiment, who have vague aspirations for world peace and human brotherhood, who can be counted upon to re- spond moderately to any appeal made in the name of charity, who are genuinely distressed at the sight of unwonted forms of cruelty, mis- ery, and suffering, and who perhaps serve to 7 I I"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"soften somewhat the bitter clashes of those real forces that govern the world ; but who, in spite of all their good qualities, have no deep and abiding loyalties, possess no convictions for which they would sacrifice over-much, would find it hard to live without their cus- tomary material comforts, are rather insensi- tive to the accepted forms of social injustice, are content to play the role of interested spec- tator in the drama of human history, refuse to see reality in its harsher and more disagree- able forms, rarely move outside the pleasant circles of the class to which they belong, and in the day of severe trial will follow the lead of the most powerful and respectable forces in society and at the same time find good rea- sons for so doing . These people have shown themselves entirely incapable of dealing with any of the great crises of our time-war, pros- perity, or depression . At bottom they are ro- mantic sentimentalists, but with a sharp eye on the main chance . That they can be trusted to write our educational theories and shape our educational programs is highly improbable . Among the members of this class the num- ber of children is small, the income relatively high, and the economic functions of the home greatly reduced . For these reasons an inordi- nate emphasis on the child and child interests 8 is entirely welcome to them . They wish to guard their offspring from too strenuous en- deavor and from coming into too intimate con- tact with the grimmer aspects of industrial society . They wish their sons and daughters to succeed according to the standards of their class and to be a credit to their parents . At heart feeling themselves members of a superior human strain, they do not want their children to mix too freely with the children of the poor or of the less fortunate races . Nor do they want them to accept radical social doctrines, espouse unpopular causes, or lose themselves in quest of any Holy Grail . According to their views education should deal with life, but with life at a distance or in a highly diluted form . They would generally maintain that life should be kept at arm's length, if it should not be han- dled with a poker . If Progressive Education . is to be genuinely progressive, it must emancipate itself_ from the influence of this class, face_ squarely and cop- rageously every social ism~e, .come to grips_wt_th life in -all - 6t its stark reality, establish an or- ganicrelation with the community, develop a realistic and _comprehensive theory of welfare, fashion, a compelling ancfchallenging vision of human destiny, and become less frightened than it is today at the bogies of imposition and 9 I"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"indoctrination . In a word, Progressive Educa- tion cannot place its trust in a child-centered school . This brings us to the most crucial issue in education-the question of the nature and ex- tent of the influence which the school should exercise over the development of the child . The advocates of extreme freedom have been so successful in championing what they call the rights of the child that even the most skill- ful practitioners of the art of converting others to their opinions disclaim all intention of molding the learner . And when the word in- doctrination is coupled with education there is scarcely one among us possessing the hardi- hood to refuse to be horrified . This feeling is so widespread that even Mr . Lunacharsky, Commissar of Education in the Russian Re- public until 1929, assured me on one occasion that the Soviet educational leaders do not be- lieve in the indoctrination of children in the ideas and principles of communism . When I asked him whether their children become good communists while attending the schools, he replied that the great majority do . On seeking from him an explanation of this remarkable phenomenon he said that Soviet teachers f f merely tell their children the truth about hu- man history . As a consequence, so he asserted, 10 practically all of the more intelligent boys and girls adopt the philosophy of communism . I recall also that the Methodist sect in which I was reared always confined its teachings to the truth The issue is no doubt badly confused by his- torical causes . The champions of freedom are obviously the product of an age that has broken very fundamentally with the past and is equally uncertain about the future . In many cases they feel themselves victims of narrow orthodoxies which were imposed upon them during childhood and which have severely cramped their lives . At any suggestion that the child should be influenced by his elders they therefore envisage the establishment of a state church, the formulation of a body of sacred doctrine, and the teaching of this doctrine as fixed and final . If we are forced to choose be- tween such an unenlightened form of peda- gogical influence and a condition of complete freedom for the child, most of us would in all probability choose the latter as the lesser of two evils . But this is to create a wholly artificial situation : the choice should not be limited to these two extremes . Indeed today neither ex- treme is possible . I believe firmly that a critical factor must play an important role in any adequate edu- 11 I I I"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"cational program, at least in any such pro- gram fashioned for the modern world . An education that does not strive to promote the fullest and most thorough understanding of i the world is not worthy of the name . Also there must be no deliberate distortion or suppression of facts to support any theory or point of view . On the other hand, I am prepared to defend the thesis that all education contains a large element of imposition, that in the very nature of the case this inevitable, that the existence and evolution of society depend upon it, that it is consequently* eminently desirable, and that the frank acceptance of this fact by the educator is a major professional obligation . I even contend that failure to do this involves the clothing of one's own deepest prejudices in the garb of universal truth and the intro- duction into the theory and practice of educa- tion of an element of obscurantism . In the development of this thesis I shall examine a number of widespread fallacies which seem to me to underlie the theoretical opposition to all forms of imposition . Although certain of these fallacies are very closely related and to some extent even cover the same territory, their * Some persons would no doubt regard this as a non sequitur, but the great majority of the members of the human race would, I think, accept the argument . 12 separate treatment will help to illuminate the problem . II 1 . There is the fallacy that man is born free . As a matter of fact, he is born helpless . He achieves freedom, as a race and as an indi- vidual, through the medium of culture . The most crucial of all circumstances conditioning human life is birth into a particular culture . By birth one becomes a Chinese, an English- man, a Hottentot, a Sioux Indian, a Turk, or a one-hundred-percent American . Such a range of possibilities may appear too shocking to contemplate, but it is the price that one must pay in order to be born . Nevertheless, even if a given soul should happen by chance to choose a Hottentot for a mother, it should thank its lucky star that it was born into the Hottentot culture rather than entirely free . By being nurtured on a body of culture, how- ever backward and limited it may be compar- atively, the individual is at once imposed upon and liberated . The child is terribly imposed upon by being compelled through the acci- dents of birth to learn one language rather than another, but without some language man would never become man . Any language, even 13 A-4"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"the most poverty-stricken, is infinitely better than none at all . In the life cycle of the indi- vidual many choices must of necessity be made, and the most fundamental and decisive of these choices will always be made by the group . This is so obvious that it should require no elabora- tion . Yet this very obvious fact, with its im- plications, is commonly disregarded by those who are fearful of molding the child . One of the most important elements of any culture is a tradition of achievement along a particular line-a tradition which the group imposes upon the young and through which the powers of the young are focused, dis- ciplined, and developed . One people will have a fine hunting tradition, another a maritime tradition, another a musical tradition, another a military tradition, another a scientific tra- dition, another a baseball tradition, another a business tradition, and another even a tradi- tion of moral and religious prophecy . A par- ticular society of the modern type commonly has a vast number of different traditions all of which may be bound together and integrated more or less by some broad and inclusive tra- dition . One might argue that the imposing of these traditions upon children involves a se- vere restriction upon their freedom . My thesis is that such imposition, provided the tradition 14 is vital and suited to the times, releases the energies of the young, sets up standards of ex- cellence, and makes possible really great achievement . The individual who fails to come under the influence of such a tradition may enjoy a certain kind of freedom, but it is scarcely a kind of freedom that anyone would covet for either himself or his children . It is the freedom of mediocrity, incompetence, and aimlessness . 2 . There is the fallacy that the child is good by nature . The evidence from anthropology, as well as from common observation, shows that on entering the world the individual is neither good nor bad ; he is merely a bundle of po- tentialities which may be developed in mani- fold directions . Guidance is, therefore, not to be found in child nature, but rather in the cul- ture of the group and the purposes of living . There can be no good individual apart from some conception of the character of the good society ; and the good society is not something that is given by nature : it must be fashioned by the hand and brain of man . This process of building a good society is to a very large de- gree an educational process . The nature of the child must of course be taken into account in the organization of any educational program, but it cannot furnish the materials and the 15"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"guiding principles of that program . Squirm and wriggle as we may, we must admit that the bringing of materials and guiding princi- ples from the outside involves the molding of the child . 3 . There is the fallacy that the child lives in a separate world of his own . The advocates of freedom often speak of the adult as an alien influence in the life of the child . For an adult to intrude himself or his values into the do- main of boys and girls is made to take on the appearance of an invasion by a foreign power . Such a dualism is almost wholly artificial . Whatever may be the view of the adult, the child knows but one society ; and that is a so- ciety including persons of all ages . This does not mean that conflicts of interest may not occur or that on occasion adults may not abuse and exploit children . It does mean that in a proper kind of society the relationship is one of mutual benefit and regard in which the young repay in trust and emulation the pro- tection and guidance provided by their elders . The child's conception of his position in so- ciety is well expressed in the words of Plenty- 'coups, the famous Crow chieftain, who spoke thus of his boyhood : \"We followed the buffalo herds over our beautiful plains, fighting a bat- tle one day and sending out a war-party 16 against the enemy the next . My heart was afire . I wished so to help my people, to dis- tinguish myself, so that I might wear an eagle's feather in my hair . How I worked to make my arms strong as a grizzly's, and how I practiced with my bow! A boy never wished to be a man more than I .\" Here is an emphatic and un- equivocal answer to those who would raise a barrier between youth and age . Place the child in a world of his own and you take from him the most powerful incentives to growth and achievement . Perhaps one of the greatest tragedies of contemporary society lies in the fact that the child is becoming increasingly isolated from the serious activities of adults . Some would say that such isolation is an in- evitable corollary of the growing complexity of the social order . In my opinion it is rather the product of a society that is moved by no great commanding ideals and is consequently victimized by the most terrible form of human madness-the struggle for private gain . As primitive peoples wisely protect their children from the dangers of actual warfare, so we guard ours from the acerbities of economic strife . Until school and society are bound to- gether by common purposes the program of education will lack both meaning and vitality . 4 . There is the fallacy that education is some 17"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"pure and mystical essence that remains un- changed from everlasting to everlasting . Ac- cording to this view, genuine education must be completely divorced from politics, live apart from the play of social forces, and pursue ends peculiar to itself . It thus becomes a method existing independently of the cultural milieu and equally beneficent at all times and in all places . This is one of the most dangerous of fallacies and is responsible for many sins com- mitted in different countries by American educators traveling abroad . They have carried the same brand of education to backward and advanced races, to peoples living under rela- tively static conditions and to peoples passing through periods of rapid and fundamental transition . They have called it Education with a capital E, whereas in fact it has been Amer- ican education with a capital A and a small e . Any defensible educational program must be adjusted to a particular time and place, and the degree and nature of the imposition must vary with the social situation . Under ordinary conditions the process of living suffices in it- self to hold society together, but when the forces of disintegration become sufficiently powerful it may well be that a fairly large measure of deliberate control is desirable and even essential to social survival . 18 5 . There is the fallacy that the school should be impartial in its emphases, that no bias should be given instruction . We have already ob- served how the individual is inevitably molded by the culture into which he is born . In the case of the school a similar process operates and presumably is subject to a degree of con- scious direction . My thesis is that complete impartiality is utterly impossible, that the school must shape attitudes, develop tastes, and even impose ideas . It is obvious that the whole of creation cannot be brought into the school . This means that some selection must be made of teachers, curricula, architecture, methods of teaching . And in the making of the selection the dice must always be weighted in favor of this or that . Here is a fundamental truth that cannot be brushed aside as irrelevant or unimportant ; it constitutes the very es- sence of the matter under discussion . Nor can the reality be concealed beneath agreeable phrases . Professor Dewey states in his De- mocracy and Education that the school should provide a purified environment for the child . With this view I would certainly agree ; prob- ably no person reared in our society would favor the study of pornography in the schools . I am sure, however, that this means stacking the cards in favor of the particular systems of 19"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"value which we may happen to possess . It is one of the truisms of the anthropologist that there are no maxims of purity on which all peoples would agree . Other vigorous oppo- nents of imposition unblushingly advocate the \"cultivation of democratic sentiments\" in chil- dren or the promotion of child growth in the direction of \"a better and richer life .\" The first represents definite acquiescence in imposition ; the second, if it does not mean the same thing, means nothing . I believe firmly that demo- cratic sentiments should be cultivated and that a better and richer life should be the outcome of education, but in neither case would I place responsibility on either God or the order of nature . I would merely contend that as edu- cators we must make many choices involving the development of attitudes in boys and girls and that we should not be afraid to acknowl- edge the faith that is in us or mayhap the forces that compel us . 6 . There is the fallacy that the great object of education is to produce the college pro- fessor, that is, the individual who adopts an agnostic attitude towards every important so- cial issue, who can balance the pros against the cons with the skill of a juggler, who sees all sides of every question and never commits himself to any, who delays action until all the 20 facts are in, who knows that all the facts will never come in, who consequently holds his judgment in a state of indefinite suspension, and who before the approach of middle age sees his powers of action atrophy and his so- cial sympathies decay . With Peer Gynt he can exclaim : Ay, think o f it wish it done-will it to boot,- But do it-! No, that's past my understanding! This type of mind also talks about waiting until the solutions of social problems are found, when as a matter of fact there are no solutions in any definite and final sense . For any complex social problem worthy of the name there are probably tens and even scores, if not hundreds, of \"solutions,\" depending upon the premises from which one works . The meeting of a social situation involves the making of decisions and the working out of ad- justments . Also it involves the selection and re- jection of values . If we wait for a solution to appear like the bursting of the sun through the clouds or the resolving of the elements in an algebraic equation, we shall wait in vain . Al- though college professors, if not too numerous, perform a valuable social function, society re- quires great numbers of persons who, while 21"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"capable of gathering and digesting facts, are at the same time able to think in terms of life, make decisions, and act . From such persons will come our real social leaders . 7 . There is the closely related fallacy that education is primarily intellectualistic in its processes and goals . Quite as important is that ideal factor in culture which gives meaning, direction, and significance to life . I refer to the element of faith or purpose which lifts man out of himself and above the level of his more narrow personal interests . Here, in my judgment, is one of the great lacks in our schools and in our intellectual class today . We are able to contemplate the universe and find that all is vanity . Nothing really stirs us, un- less it be that the bath water is cold, the toast burnt, or the elevator not running ; or that per- chance we miss the first section of a revolving door . Possibly this is the fundamental reason why we are so fearful of molding the child . We are moved by no great faiths ; we are touched by no great passions . We can view a world order rushing rapidly towards collapse with no more concern than the outcome of a horse race ; we can see injustice, crime and misery in their most terrible forms all about us and, if we are not directly affected, register the emotions of a scientist studying white rats 22 in a laboratory . And in the name of freedom, objectivity, and the open mind, we would transmit this general attitude of futility to our children . In my opinion this is a confession of complete moral and spiritual bankruptcy . We cannot, by talk about the interests of children and the sacredness of personality, evade the responsibility of bringing to the younger gen- eration a vision which will call forth their ac- tive loyalties and challenge them to creative and arduous labors . A generation without such a vision is destined, like ours, to a life of absorption in self, inferiority complexes, and frustration . The genuinely free man is not the person who spends the day contemplating his own navel, but rather the one who loses him- self in a great cause or glorious adventure . 8 . There is the fallacy that the school is an all-powerful educational agency . Every pro- fessional group tends to exaggerate its own importance in the scheme of things . To this general rule the teachers offer no exception . The leaders of Progressive Education in par- ticular seem to have an over-weening faith in the power of the school . On the one hand, they speak continually about reconstructing society through education ; and on the other, they ap- parently live in a state of perpetual fear lest the school impose some one point of view upon 23 10"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"all children and mold them all to a single pattern . A moment's reflection is sufficient to show that life in the modern world is far too complex to permit this : the school is but one formative agency among many, and certainly not the strongest at that . Our major concern consequently should be, not to keep the school from influencing the child in a positive direc- tion, but rather to make certain that every Progressive school will use whatever, power it may possess in opposing and checking the voices of social conservatism andreaction . We know full well that, if the school should en- deavor vigorously and consistently to win its pupils to the support of a given social pro- gram, unless it were supported by other agen- cies, it could act only as a mild counterpoise to restrain and challenge the might of less en- lightened and more selfish purposes . 9 . There is the fallacy that ignorance rather than knowledge is the way of wisdom . Many who would agree that imposition of some kind is inevitable seem to feel that there is some- thing essentially profane in any effort to un- derstand, plan, and control the process . They will admit that the child is molded by his en- vironment, and then presumably contend that in the fashioning of this environment we should close our eyes to the consequences of 24 i our acts, or at least should not endeavor to control our acts in the light of definite knowl- edge of their consequences . To do the latter would involve an effort to influence deliber- ately the growth of the child in a particular direction-to cause him to form this habit rather than that, to develop one taste rather than another, to be sensitive to a given ideal rather than its rival . But this would be a violation of the \"rights of the child,\" and therefore evil . Apparently his rights can be protected only if our influence upon him is thoroughly concealed under a heavy veil of ignorance . If the school can do no better than this, it has no reason for existence . If it is to be merely an arena for the blind play of psy- chological forces, it might better close its doors . Here is the doctrine of laissez faire, driven from the field of social and political theory, seeking refuge in the domain of peda- gogy . Progressive Education wishes to build a new world but refuses to be held account- able f or the kind of world it builds . In my judgment, the school should know what it is doing, in so far as this is humanly possible, and accept full responsibility for its acts . 10 . Finally, there is the fallacy that in a dynamic society like ours the major respon- sibility of education is to prepare the individ- 25"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"ual to adjust himself to social change . The argument in support of this view is fairly cogent . The world is changing with great rapidity ; the rate of change is being acceler- ated constantly ; the future is full of uncer- tainty . Consequently the individual who is to live and thrive in this world must possess an agile mind, be bound by no deep loyalties, hold all conclusions and values tentatively, and be ready on a moment's notice to make even fundamental shifts in outlook and phi- losophy . Like a lumberjack riding a raft of logs through the rapids, he must be able with lightning speed to jump from one insecure foundation to another, if he is not to be over- whelmed by the onward surge of the cultural stream . In a word, he must be as willing to adopt new ideas and values as to install the most up-to-the-minute labor - saving devices in his dwelling or to introduce the latest inven- tions into his factory . Under such a concep- tion of life and society, education can only bow down before the gods of chance and re- flect the drift of the social order . This con- ception is essentially anarchic in character, .exalts the irrational above the rational forces of society, makes of security an individual rather than a social goal, drives every one of us into an insane competition with his neigh- 26 bors, and assumes that man is incapable of controlling in the common interest the crea- tures of his brain . Here . we have imposition with a vengeance, but not the imposition of the teacher or the school . Nor is it an enlightened form of imposition . Rather is it the imposition of the chaos and cruelty and ugliness pro- duced by the brutish struggle for existence and advantage . Far more terrifying than any indoctrination in which the school might indulge is the prospect of our becoming com- pletely victimized and molded by the me- chanics of industrialism . The control of the machine requires a society which is dominated less by the ideal of individual advancement and more by certain far-reaching purposes and plans for social construction . In such a society, instead of the nimble mind respon- sive to every eddy in the social current, a firmer and more steadfast mentality would be preferable . III If we may now assume that the child will be imposed upon in some fashion by the vari- ous elements in his environment, the real ques- tion is not whether imposition will take place, but rather from what source it will come . If 27"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"we were to answer this question in terms of the past, there could, I think, be but one an- I swer : on all genuinely crucial matters the school follows the wishes of the groups or classes that actually rule society ; on minor matters the school is sometimes allowed a cer- tain measure of freedom . But the future may be unlike the past . Or perhaps I should say that teachers, if they could increase sufficiently their stock of courage, intelligence, and vision, might become asocial force of some magni- - tnde :About this eventuality I am not over sanguine, but a society lacking leadership as ours does, might even accept the guidance of teachers . Through powerful organizations they might at least reach the public conscience and come to exercise a larger measure of con- trol over the schools than hitherto . They would then have to assume some responsibility for the more fundamental forms of imposition which, according to my argument, cannot be avoided . That on the teachers should delib erately reach for power and then iiia - ke the most of their gj uest is my firm conviction . To tie extent r that they - are permitted to fashion the cur- riculum and the procedures of the school they f will definitely and positively influence the so- cial attitudes, ideals, and behavior of the com- ing generation . In doing this they should resort to no subterfuge or false modesty . They should say neither that they are merely teach- ing the truth nor that they are unwilling to wield power in their own right . The first posi- tion is false and the second is a confession of incompetence . It is my observation that the men and women who have affected the course of human events are those who have not hesi- tated to use the power that has come to them . Representing as they do, not the interests of the moment or of any special class, but rather the common and abiding interests of the peo- ple, teachers are under heavy social obligation to protect and further those interests . In this they occupy a relatively unique position in society . Also since the profession should em- brace scientists and scholars of the highest rank, as well as teachers working at all levels of the educational system, it has at its disposal, as no other group, the knowledge and wisdom of the ages . It is scarcely thinkable that these men and women would ever act as selfishly or bungle as badly as have the so-called \"prac- tical\" men of our generation-the politicians, the financiers, the industrialists . If all of these facts are taken into account, instead of shun- ning power, the profession should rather seek power and then strive to use that power fully 29 -I"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"and wisely and in the interests of the great masses of the people . The point should be emphasized that teach- ers possess no magic secret to power . While their work should give them a certain moral advantage, they must expect to encounter the usual obstacles blocking the road to leader- ship . They should not be deceived by the pious humbug with which public men commonly flatter the members of the profession . To ex- pect ruling groups or classes to give preced- ence to teachers on important matters, because of age or sex or sentiment, is to refuse to face realities . It was one of the proverbs of the agrarian order that a spring never rises higher than its source . So the power that teachers exercise in the schools can be no greater than the power they wield in society . Moreover, while organization is necessary, teachers should not think of their problem primarily in terms of organizing and presenting a united front to the world, the flesh, and the devil . In order to be effective they must throw off com- pletely the slave psychology that has domi- nated the mind of the pedagogue more or less since the days of ancient Greece . . They must be prepared to stand on their own feet and win for their ideas the support of the masses of the people . Education as a force for social 30 regeneration must march hand in hand with the living and creative forces of the social order . In their own lives teachers must bridge the gap between school and society and play some part in the fashioning of those great common purposes which should bind the two together . This brings us to the question of the kind of imposition in which teachers should engage, if they had the power . Our obligations, I think, grow out of the social situation . We live in troublous times ; we live in an age of pro- found change ; we live in an age of revolution . Indeed it is highly doubtful whether man ever lived in a more .eventful period than the pres- ent . In order to match our epoch we would probably have to go back to the fall of the an- cient empires or even to that unrecorded age when men first abandoned the natural arts of hunting and fishing and trapping and began to experiment with agriculture and the settled life . Today we are witnessing the rise of a civilization quite without precedent in human history-a civilization founded on science, technology, and machinery, possessing the most extraordinary power, and rapidly mak- ing of the entire world a single great society . Because of forces already released, whether in the field of economics, politics, morals, re- 31 J"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ligion, or art, the old molds are being broken . And the peoples of the earth are everywhere seething with strange ideas and passions . If life were peaceful and quiet and undisturbed by great issues, we might with some show of wisdom center our attention on the nature of the child . But with the world as it is, we can- not afford for a single instant to remove our eyes from the social scene or shift our atten- tion from the peculiar needs of the age . In this new world that is forming, there is one set of issues which is peculiarly funda- mental - an d .which is certain _ to be the center of bitter and prolonged stru Ie . I refer to those ~'g issues which_ may be_ styled economic . `Presi- dent Butler has well stated ie case : \"For a generation and more past,\" he says, \"the cen- ter of human interest has been moving from the point which it occupied for some four hun- dred years to a new point which it bids fair to occupy for a time equally long . The shift in the position of the center of gravity in human interest has been from politics to economics ; from considerations that had to do with forms of government, with the establishment and protection of individual liberty, to considera- tions that have to do with the production, dis- tribution, and consumption of wealth .\" Consider the present condition of the na- 32 tion . Who among us, if be had not been reared amid our institutions, could believe his eyes as he surveys the economic situation, or his ears as he listens to solemn disquisitions by our financial and political leaders on the cause and cure of the depression) Here is a society that manifests the most extraordinary contra- dictions : a mastery over the forces of nature, surpassing the wildest dreams of antiq- uity, is accompanied by extreme material in- security ; dire poverty walks hand in hand with the most extravagant living the world has ever known ; an abundance of goods of all kinds is coupled with privation, misery, and even starvation ; an excess of production is seriously - offered as the underlying cause of severe physical suffering ; breakfastless chil- dren march to school past bankrupt shops laden with rich foods gathered from the ends of the earth ; strong men by the million walk the streets in a futile search for employment and with the exhaustion of hope enter the ranks of the damned ; great captains of indus- try close factories without warning and dis- miss the workmen by whose labors they have amassed huge fortunes through the years ; automatic machinery increasingly displaces men and threatens society with a growing con- tingent of the permanently unemployed ; 33"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"racketeers and gangsters with the connivance of public officials fasten themselves on the channels of trade and exact toll at the end of the machine gun ; economic parasitism, either within or without the law, is so prevalent that the tradition of honest labor is showing signs of decay ; the wages paid to the workers are too meager to enable them to buy back the goods they produce ; consumption is subordi- nated to production and a philosophy of delib- erate waste is widely proclaimed as the highest economic wisdom ; the science of psychology is employed to fan the flames of desire so that men may be enslaved by their wants and bound to the wheel of production ; a govern- ment board advises the cotton-growers to plow under every third row of cotton in order to bolster up the market ; both ethical and Ees- thetic considerations are commonly over-rid- den by \"hard-beaded business men\" bent on material gain ; federal aid to the unemployed is opposed on the ground that it would pau- perize the masses when the favored members of society have always lived on a dole ; even responsible leaders resort to the practices of the witch doctor and vie with one another in predicting the return of prosperity ; an ideal of rugged individualism, evolved in a simple pioneering and agrarian order at a time when 84 free land existed in abundance, is used to jus- tify a system which exploits pitilessly and without thought of the morrow the natural and human resources of the nation . and of the world . One can only imagine what Jeremiah would say if he could step out of the pages of the Old Testament and cast his eyes over this vast spectacle so full of tragedy and of menace . The point should be emphasized, however, that the present situation is also freighted with hope and promise . The age is pregnant with possibilities . There lies within our grasp the most humane, the most beautiful, the most majestic civilization ever fashioned by any people . This much at least we know today . We shall probably know more tomorrow . At last men have achieved such a mastery over the forces of nature that wage slavery can follow chattel slavery and take its place among the relics of the past . No longer are there grounds for the contention that the finer fruits of human culture must be nurtured upon the toil and watered by the tears of the masses . The limits to achievement set by na- ture have been so extended that we are today bound merely by our ideals, by our power of self-discipline, by our ability to devise social arrangements suited to an industrial age . If 35 J"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"we are to place any credence whatsoever in the word of our engineers, the full utilization of modern technology at its present level of development should enable us to produce sev- eral times as much goods as were ever pro- duced at the very peak of prosperity, and with the working day, the working year, and the working life reduced by half . We hold within our hands the power to usher in an age of plenty, to make secure the lives of all, and to banish poverty forever from the land . The only cause for doubt or pessimism lies in the question of our ability to rise to the stature of the times in which we live . Our generation has the, good or the ill for- tune to live in an age when great decisions must be made . The American people, like most of the other peoples of the earth, have come to the parting of the ways ; they can no longer trust entirely the inspiration which came to them when the Republic was young ; they must decide afresh what they are to do with their talents . Favored above all other na- tions with the resources of nature and the ma- terial instrumentalities of civilization, they stand confused and irresolute before the fu- ture . They seem to lack the moral quality necessary to quicken, discipline, and give di- rection to their matchless energies . In a recent 36 paper Professor Dewey has, in my judgment, correctly diagnosed our troubles : \"the schools, like the nation,\" he says, \"are in need of a cen- tral purpose which will create new enthusiasm and devotion, and which will unify and guide all intellectual plans .\" This suggests, as we have already observed, that the educational problem is not wholly intellectual in nature . Our Progressive schools therefore cannot rest content with giving chil- dren an opportunity to study contemporary society in all of its aspects . This of course must be done, but I am convinced that they should go much farther . If the schools are to be really effective, they must become centers for the building, and not merely for the con- templation, of our civilization . This does not mean that we should endeavor to promote par- ticular reforms through the educational sys- tem . We should, however, give to our children a vision of the possibilities which lie ahead and endeavor to enlist their loyalties and enthu- siasms in the realization of the vision . Also our social institutions and practices, all of them, should be critically examined in the light of such a vision . 37"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"IV In The Epic of America James Truslow Adams contends that our chief contribution to the heritage of the race lies not in the field of science, or religion, or literature, or art but rather in the creation of what he calls the \"American Dream\"--a vision of a society in which the lot of the common man will be made easier and his life enriched and ennobled . If this vision has been a moving force in our his- tory, as I believe it has, why should we not set ourselves the task of revitalizing and reconsti- tuting it? This would seem to be the great need of our age, both in the realm of educa- tion and in the sphere of public life, because men must have something for which to live . Agnosticism, skepticism, or even experimen- talism, unless the last is made flesh through the formulation of some positive social pro- gram, constitutes an extremely meager spirit- ual diet for any people . A small band of intellectuals, a queer breed of men at best, may be satisfied with such a spare ration, par- ticularly if they lead the sheltered life com- mon to their class ; but the masses, I am sure, will always demand something more solid and substantial . Ordinary men and women crave a tangible purpose towards which to strive and 38 which lends richness and dignity and meaning to life . I would consequently like to see our profession come to grips with the problem of creating a tradition that has roots in American soil, is in harmony with the spirit of the age, recognizes the facts of industrialism, appeals to the most profound impulses of our people, and takes into account the emergence of a world society .* The ideal foundations on which we must build are easily discernible . Until recently the very word America has been synonymous throughout the world with democracy and symbolic to the oppressed classes of all lands of hope and opportunity . Child of the revolu- tionary ideas and impulses of the eighteenth century, the American nation became the em- bodiment of bold social experimentation and a champion of the power of environment to develop the capacities and redeem the souls of common men and women . And as her stature grew, her lengthening shadow reached to the four corners of the earth and everywhere im- pelled the human will to rebel against ancient * In the remainder of the argument I confine attention en- tirely to the domestic situation . I do this, not because I regard the question of international relations unimportant, but rather because of limitations of space . All I can say here is that any proper conception of the world society must accept the prin- ciple of the moral equality of races and nations . 39"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"wrongs . Here undoubtedly is the finest jewel in our heritage and the thing that is most worthy of preservation . If America should lose her honest devotion to democracy, or if she should lose her revolutionary temper, she will no longer be America . In that day, if it has not already arrived, her spirit will have fled and she will be known merely as the richest and most powerful of the nations . If America is not to be false to the promise of her youth, she must do more than simply per- petuate the democratic ideal of human rela- tionships : she must make an intelligent and determined effort to fulfill it . The democracy of the past was the chance fruit of a strange conjunction of forces on the new continent ; the democracy of the future can only be the intended offspring of the union of human rea- son, purpose, and will . The conscious and de- liberate achievement of democracy under novel circumstances is the task of our generation . Democracy of course should not be identi- fied with political forms and functions-with the federal constitution, the popular election of officials, or the practice of universal suf- frage . To think in such terms is to confuse the entire issue, as it has been confused in the minds of the masses for generations . The most genuine expression of democracy in the 40 United States has little to do with our politi- cal institutions : it is a sentiment with respect to the moral equality of men : it is an aspiration towards a society in which this sentiment will find complete fulfillment . A society fashioned in harmony with the American democratic tradition would combat'all forces-tending to produce social distinctions and classes ; repress every form of privilege and economic parasit- ism ; manifest a tender regard for the weak, the ignorant, and the unfortunate ;` place the heavier and more onerous social burdens on the backs of the strong ; glory in every tri- umph of man in his timeless urge_ to_ express himself and to make the world more__ habit- able ; exalt human labor of hand an 'd brain as the creator of all wealth and culture ; pro- vide adequate material and spiritual rewards for every kind of socially useful work ; strive for genuine equality of opportunity among all races, sects, and occupations ; regard as para- mount the abiding interests of the great masses of the people ; direct the powers of govern- ment to the elevation and the refinement of the life of the common man ; transform or destroy all conventions, institutions, and special groups inimical to -the underlying principles of democracy ; and finally be prepared as a last resort, in either the defense or the realiza- 41"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"tion of this purpose, to follow the method of revolution . Although these ideals have never been realized or perhaps even fully accepted anywhere in the United States and have al- ways had to struggle for existence with con- trary forces, they nevertheless have authentic roots in the past . They are the values for which America has stood before the world during most of her history and with which the Amer- ican people have loved best to associate their country . Their power and authority are clearly revealed in the fact that selfish inter- ests, when grasping for some special privilege, commonly wheedle and sway the masses by re- peating the words and kneeling before the emblems of the democratic heritage . It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that this tradition, if its spirit is to survive, will have to be reconstituted in the light of the great social trends of the age in which we live . Our democratic heritage was largely a product of the frontier, free land, and a simple agrarian order . Today a new and strange and closely integrated industrial economy is rap- idly sweeping over the world . Although some of us in our more sentimental moments talk wistfully of retiring into the more tranquil so- ciety of the past, we could scarcely induce many of our fellow citizens to accompany us . 42 Even the most hostile critics of industrialism would like to take with them in their retire- ment a few such fruits of the machine as elec- tricity, telephones, automobiles, modern plumbing, and various labor-saving devices, or at least be assured of an abundant supply of slaves or docile and inexpensive servants . But all such talk is the most idle chatter . For bet- ter or for worse we must take industrial civi- lization as an enduring fact : already we have become parasitic on its institutions and products . The hands of the clock cannot be turned back . If we accept industrialism, as we must, we are then compelled to face without equivoca- tion the most profound issue which this new order of society has raised and settle that issue in terms of the genius of our people-the issue of the control of the ma chine . In whose inter- ests and for what purposes are the vast ma- terial riches, the unrivaled industrial equip- ment, and the science and technology of the nation to be used? In the light of our demo- cratic tradition there can be but one answer to the question : all of these resources must be dedicated to the promotion of the welfare of the great masses of the people . Even the classes in our society that perpetually violate this principle are compelled by the force of 43 l"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"44 public opinion to pay lip-service to it and to defend their actions in its terms . No body of men, however powerful, would dare openly to flout it . Since the opening of the century the great corporations have even found it neces- sary to establish publicity departments or to employ extremely able men as public relations counselors in order to persuade the populace that regardless of appearances they are lovers of democracy and devoted servants of the peo- ple . In this they have been remarkably suc- cessful, at least until the coming of the great depression . For during the past generation there have been few things in America that could not be bought at a price . If the benefits of industrialism are to ac- crue fully to the people, this deception must be exposed . If the machine is to serve all, and serve all equally, it cannot be the property of the few . To ask these few to have regard for the common weal, particularly when under the competitive system they are forced always to think first of themselves or perish, is to put too great a strain on human nature . With the ,present concentration of economic power m the hands of a small class, a condition that - is likely to get wor se before it gets better, the survival or development of a society that could in any sense be called democratic is unthink- able . The hypocrisy which is so characteristi of our public life today is due primarily our failure to acknowledge the fairly obvious fact that America is the scene of an irrecon- cilable conflict between two opposing forces . On the one side is the democratic tradition inherite d from the past ; on the other _ is a sys- tem of economic_ arrangements which increas- ingly partakes of the nature of industrial feudalism . Both of these forces cannot sig- vive : one or the other must give way . Unless the democratic tradition is able to , organize, and coniucT a successful attack on the eco- nomic system, its__ complete destruction_ 4_M- . evitable . \t >'e . If democrac is to survive, it must seek a new economic foundation . Our traditional democracy rested upon small-scale production in both agriculture and industry and a rather general diffusion of the rights of property in capital and natural resources . The driving force at the root of this condition, as we have seen, was the frontier and free land . With the closing of the frontier, the exhaustion of free land, the growth of population, and the com- ing of large scale production, the basis of ownership was transformed . If property rights are to be diffused in industrial society, natural resources and all important forms of capital"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"will have to be o' ectively owned . O bviously every citizen cannot hold title to a mine, a fac- °iy', a railr o acT, a leparCiierif - store~ or even a -thoroughly mecbarnzte \"farm, This clearly means that, if' democracy - is to survive in, the United , States it must abandon its individ- ualistic affiliations in the sphere of, economics . What precise form a democratic society will take in the age of science and the machine, we cannot know with any assurance today . We must, however, insist on two things : first, that technology be released from the fetters and the domination of every type of special privilege ; and, second, that the resulting sys- tem of production and distribution be made to serve directly the masses of the people . Within these limits, as I see it, our jjg=atic tradition must ,of_nece$sity . evolve - 40 grad- ually assume an essentially collectivistic p at- tern . The only conceivable alternative is the abandonment of the last vestige of democracy and the frank adoption of some modern form of feudalism . V The important point is that fundamental changes in the economic system are impera tive . Whatever services historic ca ita ism 46 may have rendered in the ast, and the have its days are numbered . Withh its- e ca ion of t iI pr nci e oo selfishness, its exaltation of the ro t motive, its reliance upon the forces of com petition, and its lae- in` g of property above human rig ts, it will either 'have to be - displaced altogether or changed - so radically in form and spirit that its identity will be completely - lost . In view of the fact that the urge for private - gain nt ten s to debase everything that it touches, whether business, recreation, religion, art, or friend- ship, , the r indictment against capitalism has commonly been made on moral grounds . But today the indictment can be drawn m other Capitalism is proving itself weak at the very point where its champions have thought it impregnable . It is failing to meet the prag 1 matic test ; it no onger works ; it is unable even to organize and maintain production . In its present form capitalism is not only - cruel and inhuman ; it is aTso'wasteful' and inefli- cient . It has exploited our natural' resources wit out t e sh~ght s egard . for e future needs of our society ; it as force technology o' serve the interests of the few rather than the many ; it has chained the engineer to the vagaries and inequities of the price system ; 47 u J"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"it has plunged the great nations of the earth into a succession of wars ever more devastat- ing and catastrophic in character ; and only re- cently it has brought on a world crisis of such dimensions that the entire economic order is paralyzed and millions of men in all the great industrial countries are deprived of the means of livelihood . The growth of science and tech- nology has carried us into a new age where ignorance must be replaced by knowledge, competition by cooperation, trust in provi- dence by careful planning, and private capi- talism by some form of socialized' economy . Already the individualism of the pioneer and the farmer, produced by free land, great distances, economic independence, and a largely self-sustaining family economy, is without solid foundation in either agriculture or industry . Free land has long since dis- appeared . Great distances have been short- ened immeasurably by invention .' Economic independence survives only in the traditions' of our people .

The fact cannot be overemphasized that choice is no longer be- tween individualism and collectivism . It is rather between two forms of collectivism : the one essentially democratic, the other feudal in spirit ; the one devoted to the interests of the , people, the other to the interests of a privileged i class .

In exchange for such privileges as these, which only the few could ever enjoy, we would secure the complete and uninterrupted func- tioning of the productive system and thus lay the foundations for a measure of freedom for the many that mankind has never known in the past . Freedom without a secure economic foundation is only a word : in our society it may be freedom to beg, steal, or starve . The right to vote, if it cannot be made to insure the right to work, is but an empty bauble . In- deed it may be less than a bauble : it may serve to drug and dull the senses of the masses . To- day only the members of the plutocracy are really free, and even in their case freedom is rather precarious . If all of us could be assured of material security and abundance, we would be released from economic worries and our energies liberated to grapple with the central problems of cultural advance . Under existing conditions, however, no champion of the democratic way of life can view the future with equanimity .

There is little evidence from the pages of American history to support us ` in tliehope that we may adjust our dlfeulties through the ine[Eod of sweetnes s and l-ight_ the settlement o f ~f tt_ e l rst colonists along the Atlantic seaboard we have practiced and become inured to violence . This is peculiarly true wherever and whenever property rights, actual or potential, have been involved . Con- sider the pitiless extermination of the Indian tribes and the internecine strife over the issue of human slavery . Consider the long reign of violence in industry, from the days of the Molly Maguires in the seventies down to the strikes in the mining regions of Kentucky to- day . Also let those, whose memories reach back a dozen years, recall the ruthlessness with 51"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"i which the privileged classes put down every expression of economic or political dissent during the period immediately following the World War . When property is threatened, constitutional guarantees are but scraps of paper and even the courts and the churches, with occasional exceptions, rush to the sup- port of privilege and vested interest . This is a dark picture . If we look at the fu- ture through the eyes of the past, we find little reason for optimism . If there is to be no break in our tradition of violence, if a bold and real- istic program of education is not forthcoming, we can only anticipate a struggle of increasing bitterness terminating in revolution and dis- aster . And yet, as regards the question of property, the present situation has no histori- cal parallel . In earlier paragraphs I have pointed to the possibility of completely dispos- ing of the economic problem . For the first time in history we are able to produce all the goods and services that our people can consume . The justification, or at least the rational basis, of the age-long struggle for property has been removed . This situation gives to teachers an opportunity and a responsibility unique in the annals of education . In an economy of scarcity, where the popu- lation always tends to outstrip the food sup- 52 ply, any attempt to change radically the rules of the game must inevitably lead to trial by the sword . But in an economy of plenty, which the growth of technology has made entirely possible, the conditions are fundamentally al- tered . It is natural and understandable for men to fight when there is scarcity, whether it be over air, water, food, or women . For them to fight over the material goods of life in America -today is sheer insanity . Through the courageous and intelligent reconstruction of their economic institutions they could all ob- tain, not only physical security, but also the luxuries of life and as much leisure as men could ever learn to enjoy . For those who take delight in combat, ample provision for strife could of course be made ; but the more cruel aspects of the human struggle would be con- siderably softened . As the possibilities in our society begin to dawn upon us, we are all, I think, growing increasingly weary of the bru- talities, the stupidities, the hypocrisies, and the gross inanities of contemporary life . We have a haunting feeling that we were born for better things and that the nation itself is fall- ing far short of its powers . The fact that other groups refuse to deal boldly and realistically with the present situation does not justify the teachers of the country in their customary 53 J"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"policy of hesitation and equivocation . The times are literally crying for a new vision of American destiny . The teaching profession, or at least its progressive elements, should eagerly grasp the opportunity which the fates have placed in their hands .

The o sec ion will of course be raised that this is asking teachers to assume unpre- cedented social responsibilities .

Neutrality with respect_ _to_ the--great issues that agitate_ society, while perhaps theo- retically possible is practically tantamount to wing support to the forces of cons ervatism - As Justice Holmes has candidly said in his essay on Natural Law, \"we all, whether we know it or not, are fighting to make the kind of world that we should like .\" If neutrality is 54 impossible even in the dispensation of justice, whose emblem is the blindfolded goddess, how is it to be achieved in education? To ask the question is to answer it . To refuse to face the task of creating a vision of a future America immeasurably more just and noble and beautiful than the America of today is to evade the most crucial, difficult, and important educational task . Un- til we have assumed this responsibility we are scarcely justified in opposing and mocking the efforts of so-called patriotic societies to introduce into the schools a tradition which, though narrow and unenlightened, neverthe- less represents an honest attempt to meet a profound social and educational need . Only when we have fashioned a finer and more au- thentic vision than they will we be fully justi- fied in our opposition to their efforts . Only then will we have discharged the age-long ob- ligation which the older generation owes to the younger and which no amount of sophistry can obscure . Only through such a legacy of spiritual values will our children be enabled to find their place in the world, be lifted out of the present morass of moral indifference, be liberated from the senseless struggle for material success, and be challenged to high en- deavor and achievement .
