Geor g e Bush is g i ving us another So- viet Union here in this hemisphere with the United Sta tes, Canada and La tin Amer ica. Y ou w ould ne v er ha v e been a b le to g et the Amer ican people 40 or 50 years ago to accept this. Our c hildr en will be nothing b ut dr ones in the global econom y , w or king f or the global elite . It’ s the same old totalitar ianism. P eople w ouldn ’ t ac- ce pt it as the y do, if the y hadn ’ t deliber a tel y c hang ed the countr y thr ough the sc hools o v er a long period of time. A c lose associa te of So viet a g ent Alg er Hiss, in a speec h to the W or ld Health Or g aniza tion, sug g ested “g etting r id of the conscience . ” He r ec- ommended that teachers be retrained to be psy- c hia tr ists to tr ain students tha t ther e’ s no r ight and no wr ong . W e sa w those types of teac hing pr o- grams from the 1960s through the 1990s. In 1965 along came Professor Benjamin Bloom with his r edef inition of educa tion. Bloom ’ s def i- nition of educa tion w as acce pted . He said , “T he purpose of education is to change the thoughts, actions and f eelings of students. ” Not academics. He def ined g ood teac hing as “c halleng ing the stu- dents ’ f ix ed beliefs. ” In m y stud y of all this, I’ v e f ocused on the Leipzig connection. In the la te 1800s man y of our Amer ican educa tor s w ent to Ger man y . Y ou ’ v e hear d of “T he Or der ” (or “Skull and Bones, ” as it is often called) a t Y ale .

T he y c hang ed the la- bel to “outcome-based education ” after the so- called “Mastery Learning ” had been such a di- saster and so man y inner city c hildr en had dr opped out in Chicago. Y et, Pr esident Bush is putting in the same old “Mastery Learning ” under the label “Direct In- str uction. ” Re g ar dless of w ha t y ou call it, it is not learning. It is training. Skinner himself said: “I could mak e a pig eon a high ac hie v er , ” b y r einf or cing it on a pr oper schedule. So when you hear them say “all chil- dr en will lear n, ” the y ar e sa ying , “ All c hildr en will jump thr ough the hoop. ” Y es, all c hildr en will lear n if y ou r einf or ce them with a r e w ar d . It’ s lik e y our do g . But our c hildr en ar en’ t do gs. Instead of thinking it’ s w onderful tha t the pr esi- dent and the secr etar y ar e sa ying “ All c hildr en will lear n. No c hild will be left behind , ” y ou m ust ask yourself what that means. It has nothing to do with education. It has to do with reaching the lo w est common denomina tor and g etting r id of an y academics because cor por a tions —cer tainl y the m ultina tionals —don ’ t w ant intellig ent w or k er s. T he Car ne g ie Cor por a tion ’ s Da vid Hor nbac k, w ho has r estr uctur ed educa tion in man y of the states, essentially said in his book, Human Capi- tal , tha t “W e don ’ t w ant educa ted w or k er s.

That ’ s the shocking thesis put for th in a car efully-documented 750-page volume entitled The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America , by Charlotte Iserbyt. A former school board member who sent her children to public schools, Mrs. Iserbyt was a longtime supporter of Ronald Regan and was appointed to the U.S. Department of Educa- tion by Regan, only to be fired in 1982 after she objected to—and later leaked documents exposing —top-level agreements between the administration and the Soviet Union for the purpose of redirecting the course of American Education.
