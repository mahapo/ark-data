Forced schooling seduces the trapped into believing that inert knowledge, memorized fact bits and sequences is the gold standard of intellectual achievement.

Her crime was homeschooling. Reading about that reminded me of the time I was almost arrested lecturing to the senior class at a wealthy high school in Rockland County, New York. I was revealing the GPAs and SAT scores of American presidents and other prominent individuals when a squad of police halted my lecture at the superintendent's request.

Its most vulnerable point, the glue that holds the thing together, is standardized testing which purports, dishon- estly, to determine success or failure in future life.

If ten percent refused to take the tests, the school world would be shaken to its foundations. Call it an open conspiracy. Be brave. There's nothing they can do to you that matters if you sincerely prefer not to. But don't fake it - if you love to take these tests, take them by all means.

Boredom was everywhere in my world , and if you asked the kids, as I often did, why they felt so bored, they always gave me the same answers: They said the work was stupid, that it made no sense, that they already knew it. They said they wanted to be doing something real, not just sitting around. They said teachers didn't seem to know much about their subjects and clearly weren't in- terested in learning more. And the kids were right: their teachers were every bit as bored as they were. Boredom is the common condition of schoolteachers, and anyone who has spent time in a teachers' lounge can vouch for the low energy, the whining, the dispirited attitudes, to be found there. When asked why they feel bored, teachers te~d to blame kids, as you might expect. Who wouldn't get bored teaching students who are rude and inter- ested only in grades? If even that. Of course, teachers are themselves products of the same twelve-year compulsory school programs that so thoroughly bore their students, and as school personnel they are trapped inside structures even more rigid than those imposed upon the children. Who, then, is to blame? We all are. My grandfather taught me that. One afternoon when I was seven I complained to him of boredom, and he batted me hard on xiii"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xiv WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION the head. He told me that I was never to use that term in his presence again, that if I was bored it was my fault and no one else's. The obli- gation to amuse and instruct myself was entirely my own, and people who didn't know that were childish people, to be avoided if possible. Certainly not to be trusted. That episode cured me of boredom for- ever, and here and there over the years I was able to pass on the lesson to some remarkable students. For the most part, however, I found it futile to challenge the official notion that boredom and childishness were the natural state of affairs in the classroom. Often I had to defy custom, and even bend the law, to help kids break out of this trap. The empire struck back, of course; childish adults regularly con- flate opposition with disloyalty. I once returned from a medical leave to discover all evidence of my having been granted leave had been de- liberately destroyed, that my job had been terminated and I no longer possessed even a teaching license. After nine months of tormented ef- fort I was able to retrieve the license when a school secretary testified to witnessing the plot unfold. In the meantime my family suffered more than I care to remember. By the time I finally retired in 1991, I had more than enough reason to think of our schools - with their long-term, cell-block-style forced confinement of both students and teachers - as virtual factories of childishness. Yet I honestly could not see why they had to be that way. My own experience revealed to me what many other teachers must learn along the way, too, yet keep to themselves for fear of reprisal: if we wanted we could easily and in- expensively jettison the old, stupid structures and help kids take an education rather than merely receive schooling. We could encourage the best qualities of youthfulness - curiosity, adventure, resilience, the capacity for surprising insight - simply by being more flexible about time, texts, and tests, by introducing kids to truly competent adults, and by giving each student the autonomy he or she needs in order to take a risk every now and then. But we don't do that. And the more I asked why not, and persisted in thinking about the \"problem\" of schooling as an engineer might, the more I missed the point: What if there is no \"problem\" with our"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Prologue: Against School xv schools? What if they are the way they are, so expensively flying in the face of common sense and long experience in how children learn things, not because they are doing something wrong, but because they are doing something right? Is it possible that George W. Bush accidentally spoke the truth when he said he would \"leave no child be- hind\"? Could it be that our schools are designed to make sure not one of them ever really grows up? Do we really need school? I don't mean education, just forced school- ing: six classes a day, five days a week, nine months a year, for twelve years. Is this deadly routine really necessary? And if so, for what? Don't hide behind reading, writing, and arithmetic as a rationale, because 2 million happy homeschoolers have surely put that banal justifica- tion to rest. Even if they hadn't , a considerable number of well-known Americans never went through the twelve-year wringer our kids cur- rently go through, and they turned out all right. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln? Someone taught them, to be sure, but they were not products of a school system, and not one of them was ever ' graduated \" from a secondary school. Throughout most of American history, kids generally didn't go to high school, yet the unschooled rose to be admirals, like Farragut; inven- tors, like Edison; captains of industry, like Carnegie and Rockefeller; writers, like Melville and Twain and Contad; and even scholars, like Margaret Mead. In fact, until pretty recently people who reached the age of thirteen weren't looked upon as children at all. Ariel Durant, who co-wrote an enormous, and very good, multivolume history of the world with her husband Will, was happily married at fifteen , and who could reasonably claim Ariel Du.rant was an uneducated person? Unschooled, perhaps, but not uneducated. We have been taught (that is, schooled) in this country to think \"success\" is synonymous with, or at least dependent upon, \"schooling, \" but historically that isn't true in either an intellectual or a financial sense. And plenty of people throughout the world today find ways"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xvi WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION to educate themselves without resorting to a system of compulsory secondary schools that all too often resemble prisons. Why, then, do Americans confuse education with just such a system:' What exactly is the purpose of our public schools:' Mass schooling of a compulsory nature really got its teeth into the United States between 1905 and 1915, though it was conceived of much earlier and pushed for throughout most of the nineteenth cen- tury. The reason given for this enormous upheaval of family life and cultural traditions was, roughly speaking, threefold: I. To make good people. 2. To make good citizens. 3. To make each person his or her personal best. These goals are still trotted out on a regular basis, and most of us ac- cept them in one form or another as a decent definition of public edu- cations mission, however short schools actually fall in achieving them. But we are dead wrong. Compounding our error is the fact that the national literature holds numerous and surprisingly consistent state- ments of compulsory schooling's true purpose. We have, for example, H.L. Mencken, who wrote in The American Mercury for April 1924 that the aim of public education is not ... to fill the young of the species with knowledge and awaken their intelligence .... Nothing could be further from the truth. The aim ... is simply to reduce as many individuals as possi- ble to the same safe level, to breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and originality. That is its aim in the United States ... and that is its aim everywhere else. Because of Menckens reputation as a satirist, you might be tempted to dismiss this passage as hyperbolic sarcasm. His article, however, goes on to trace the template for our own educational system back to the now vanished, though never to be forgotten, military state of Prussia. And although he was certainly aware of the irony that the US had recently been at war with Germany, the heir to Prussian thought and culture,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Prologue: Against School xvii Mencken was being perfectly serious here. Our educational system re- ally is Pruss ian in origin, and that really is cause for concern. The odd fact of a Prussian provenance for our schools pops up again and again once you know to look for it. William James alluded to it many times at the turn of the century. Orestes Brownson, the hero of Christopher Lasch's 1991 book, The True and Only Heaven, was publicly denouncing the deliberate Prussianization of Ameri- can schools back in the 1840S. Horace Mann's \"Seventh Annual Re- port\" to the Massachusetts Board of Education in 1843 is essentially a paean to the land of Frederick the Great and a call for its school- ing to be brought here. That Prussian culture loomed large in Amer- ica is hardly surprising, given our early association with that utopian state. A Prussian served as Washington's aide during the Revolution- ary War, and so many German-speaking people had settled here by 1795 that Congress considered publishing a German-language edition of the federal laws. But what shocks is that we should so eagerly have adopted one of the very worst aspects of Pruss ian culture: an edu- cational system deliberately designed to produce mediocre intellects, to hamstring the inner life, to deny students appreciable leadership skills, and to ensure docile ' and incomplete citizens - all in order to render the populace \"manageable:' It was from James Bryant Conant - president of Harvard for twenty years, WWI poison-gas specialist, WWII executive of the atomic- bomb project, high commissioner of the American zone in Germany after WWII, and truly one of the most influential figures of the twen- tieth century - that I first got wind of the real purposes of Ameri- can schooling. Without Conant, we would probably not have the same style and degree of standardized testing that we enjoy today, nor would we be blessed with gargantuan high schools that warehouse 2,000 to 4,000 students at a time, like the famous Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. Shortly after I retired from teaching I picked up Conant's 1959 book-length essay, The Child, the Parent"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xviii WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION and the State, and was more than a little intrigued to see him men- tion in passing that the modern schools we attend were the result of a \"revolution\" engineered between 1905 and 1930. A revolution? He de- clines to elaborate, but he does direct the curious and the uninformed to Alexander Inglis's 1918 book, Principles of Secondary Education, in which \"one saw this revolution through the eyes of a revolutionary:' Inglis, for whom an honor lecture in education at Harvard is named, makes it perfectly clear that compulsory schooling on this continent was intended to be just what it had been for Prussia in the 1820S: a fifth column into the burgeoning democratic movement that threatened to give the peasants and the proletarians a voice at the bar- gaining table. Modern, industrialized, compulsory schooling was to make a sort of surgical intervention into the prospective unity of these underclasses. Divide children by subject, by age-grading, by constant rankings on tests, and by many other more subtle means, and it was unlikely that the ignorant mass of mankind, separated in childhood, would ever re-integrate into a dangerous whole. Inglis breaks down the purpose - the actual purpose - of mod- ern schooling into six basic functions, anyone of which is enough to . curl the hair of those innocent enough to believe the three traditional goals of education listed earlier: I. The adjustive or adaptive function. Schools are to establish fixed habits of reaction to authority. This, of course, pre- cludes critical judgment completely. It also pretty much de- stroys the idea that useful or interesting material should be taught, because you can't test for reflexive obedience until you know whether you can make kids learn, and do, foolish and boring things. 2. The integrating function. This might well be called \"the con- formity function;' because its intention is to make children as alike as possible. People who conform are predictable, and this is of great use to those who wish to harness and manip- ulate a large labor force."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Prologue: Against School 3. The diagnostic and directive function. School is meant to de- termine each student's proper social role. This is done by log- ging evidence mathematically and anecdotally on cumulative records. As in \"your permanent record:' Yes, you do have one. 4. The differentiating function. Once their social role has been \"diagnosed;' children are to be sorted by role and trained only so far as their destination in the social machine merits - and not one step further. So much for making kids their personal best. 5. The selective function. This refers not to human choice at all but to Darwin's theory of natural selection as applied to what he called \"the favored races:' In short, the idea is to help things along by consciously attempting to improve the breeding stock. Schools are meant to tag the unfit - with poor grades, remedial placement, and other punishments - clearly enough that their peers will accept them as inferior and effectively bar them from the reproductive sweepstakes. That's what all those little humiliations from first grade on- ward were intended to do: wash the dirt down the drain. 6. The propaedeutic function. The societal system implied by these rules will require an elite group of caretakers. To that end, a small fraction of the kids will quietly be taught how to manage this continuing project, how to watch over and con- trol a population deliberately dumbed down and declawed in order that government might proceed unchallenged and corporations might never want for obedient labor. XIX That, unfortunately, is the purpose of mandatory public education in this country. And lest you consider Inglis an isolated crank with a rather too cynical take on the educational enterprise, you should know he was hardly alone in championing these ideas. Conant him- self, building on the ideas of Horace Mann and others, campaigned tirelessly for an American school system designed along the same lines. Men like George Peabody, who funded the cause of mandatory"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"xx WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION schooling throughout the South, surely understood that the Prussian system was useful in creating not only a harmless electorate and a ser- vile labor force but also a virtual herd of mindless consumers. In time . a great number of industrial titans came to recognize the enormous profits to be had by cultivating and tendingjust such a herd via public education, among them Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. There you have it. Now you know. We don't need Karl Marx's concep- tion of a grand warfare between the classes to see that it is in the in- terest of complex management, economic or political, to dumb people down, to demoralize them, to divide them from one another, and to discard them if they don't conform. Class may frame the proposition, as when Woodrow Wilson, then president of Princeton University, said the following to the New York City School Teachers Associa- tion in 1909: \"We want one class of persons to have a liberal educa- tion, and we want another class of persons, a very much larger class, of necessity, in every society, to forgo the privileges of a liberal educa- tion and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks:' But the motives behind the disgusting decisions that bring about these ends need not be class-based at all. They can stem purely from fear, or from the by-now familiar belief that \"efficiency\" is the paramount virtue, rather than love, liberty, laughter or hope. Above all, they can stem from simple greed. There were vast fortunes to be made, after all, in an economy based on mass production and organized to favor the large corporation rather than the small business or the family farm. But mass produc- tion required mass consumption, and at the turn of the twentieth cen- tury most Americans considered it both unnatural and unwise to buy things they didn't actually need. Mandatory schooling was a godsend on that count. School didn't have to train kids in any direct sense to think they should consume nonstop, because it did something even better: it encouraged them not to think at all. And that left them sitting ducks for another great invention of the modern era - marketing."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Prologue: Against School I XXI Now, you needn't have studied marketing to know that there are two groups of people who can always be convinced to consume more than they need to: addicts and children. School has done a pretty good job of turning our children into addicts, but a spectacular job of turning our children into children. Again, this is no accident. The- orists from Plato to Rousseau to our own Dr. Inglis knew that if children could be cloistered with other children, stripped of respon- sibility and independence, encouraged to develop only the trivializ- ing emotions of greed, envy, jealousy, and fear, they would grow older but never truly grow up. In the 1934 edition of his once well-known book Public Education in the United States , Ellwood P. Cubberley de- tailed and praised the way the strategy of successive school enlarge- ments had extended childhood by two to six years already, and forced schooling was at that point still quite new. This same Cubberley was an intimate colleague of Dr. Inglis: both were in charge of textbook publishing divisions at Houghton Mifflin - Cubberley as chief of elementary school texts; Inglis of secondary school texts. Cubber- ley was dean of Stanford's influential School of Education as well, a friendly correspondent of Conant at Harvard. He had written in his book Public School Administration (1922) that \"Our schools are ... fac- tories in which the raw products (children) are to be shaped and fash- ioned ... \" And that it is the business of the school to build its pupils according to the specifications laid down. It's perfectly obvious from our society today what those specifica- tions were. Maturity has by now been banished from nearly every as- pect of our lives. Easy divorce laws have removed the need to work at relationships; easy credit has removed the need for fiscal self-control; easy entertainment has removed the need to learn to entertain one- self; easy answers have removed the need to ask questions. We have become a nation of children, happy to surrender our judgments and our wills to political exhortations and commercial blandishments that would insult actual adults.

And, worst of all, we don't bat an eye when Ari Fleischer tells us to \"be careful what you say;' even if we remember having been told somewhere back in school that America is the land of the free. We simply buy that one, too. Our schooling, as intended, has seen to it. Now for the good news. Once you understand the logic behind mod- ern schooling, its tricks and traps are fairly easy to avoid. School trains children to be employees and consumers; teach your own to be lead- ers and adventurers. School trains children to obey reflexively; teach your own to think critically and independently. Well-schooled kids have a low threshold for boredom; help your own to develop an in- ner life so that they'll never be bored. Urge them to take on the seri- ous material, the grown-up material, in history, literature, philosophy, music, art, economics, theology - all the stuff schoolteachers know well enough to avoid. Challenge your kids with plenty of solitude so that they can learn to enjoy their own company, to conduct inn~r dia- logues. Well-schooled people are conditioned to dread being alone; they seek constant companionship through the TV; the computer, the cell phone, and through shallow friendships quickly acquired, quickly abandoned. Your children should have a more important life, and they can. First, though, wake up to what our schools really are: laborato- ries of experimentation on young minds, drill centers for the habits and attitudes that corporate society demands. Mandatory education serves children only incidentally; its real purpose is to turn them into servants. Don't let your own have their childhoods extended, not even for a day. If David Farragut could take command of a captured Brit- ish warship as a preteen, if Ben Franklin could apprentice himself to a printer at the same age (then put himself through a course of study that would choke a Yale senior today), theres no telling what your own kids could do.

Running the World - Helen Todd, \"Why Children Work\" McClure's Magazine, April 1913 In 1919, in the heady aftermath of World War victory parades and an intoxicating sense that nothing was forbidden to the United States, including the very alteration of human nature, Professor Arthur Cal- houn's Social History of the Family notified the academic world that something profound was going on behind the scenes in the nation's schools. Big changes were being made to the idea of family. And it was a consummation to be celebrated by Calhoun's crowd, although not by everyone. Calhoun wrote that the fondest wish of utopian thinkers was coming true: children were passing from blood families \"into the cus- tody of community experts:' In time, he wrote, the dream of Dar- win and Galton would become reality through the agency of public"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"2 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION education, \"designed to check the mating of the unfix:' The dream of scientific population control. Not everyone was as impressed as Calhoun with the school agenda discreetly being inserted into classrooms beyond public over- sight. Mayor John Hylan of New York City made an elliptical remark in a public address back in 1922 which preserves some of the weird- ness of that moment. Hylan announced that the schools of the city had been seized by \"tentacles\" of \"an invisible government, just as an octopus would seize prey;' a pointed echo of the chilling pronounce- ment made years earlier by British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, when he claimed that all important events were controlled by an in- visible government, of which the public was unaware. The particular octopus Hylan meant was the Rockefeller Foundation. The 1920S were a boom period in compulsory schooling, as well as the stock market. By 1928 the book A Sociological Philosophy of Education was claiming, \"It is the business of teachers to run not merely schools but the world:' A year later, Edward Thorndike of Rockefeller-sponsored Columbia Teachers College, creator of a curi- ous new academic specialty called \"Educational Psychology;' went on record with this dramatic announcement: \"Academic subjects are of little value:' His colleague at Teachers College, William Kirkpatrick, declared in his own book, Education and the Social Crisis, that \"the whole game of rearing the young was being taken over by experts:' It seemed only common sense to Dr. Kilpatrick. Family, after all, was a retrograde institution, why should mom and dad know better than experts how to bring up baby~ The Control of Human Behavior On April II, 1933, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, Max Mason, announced a comprehensive national program underway, with the help of the Foundation, to allow \" the control of human be- havior:' School figured centrally in its design. Max Muller, an Eastern European geneticist, inspired Rockefeller to invest heavily in con- trol of human evolution.

Mutation appeared to open.the door to the scientific control of all life. In Muller's mind, as to Galton and Darwin before him, planned breeding of human beings was the key to paradise. His thinking was enthusiastically endorsed by great scientists and by powerful eco- nomic interests alike. Muller won the Nobel Prize and reduced his scheme to a 1,50o-word Geneticists' Manifesto, signed by 22 distin- guished American and British biologists. State action should separate worthwhile breeding stock from the great mass of evolutionary dead end material. The Manifesto can still be Googled. What had been dis- cussed behind closed doors in the 1870S, before we had forced school- ing, had broken through into public discourse, at least in high policy circles, and in the writings of sophisticated literary artists like F. Scott Fitzgerald. A movement away from democratic egalitarian ideals was underway, which Fitzgerald alludes to in The Great Gatsby. In simple language, on the most basic level of institutional man- agement, smart kids had to be kept from stupid ones; Horace Mann's common school notion that all levels of society would mix together in the classroom to create social harmony was now officially stone dead, except for rhetorical purposes. A few months before the Manifesto be- gan circulating aggressively, an executive director of the National Ed- ucation Association announced the NEA expected \"to accomplish by education what dictators in Europe are seeking to do by compulsion and force:' That's straightforward enough, isn't it? World War II drove the eugenic project underground, but hardly slowed its advance. Following the end of hostilities, school became an open battleground between old-fashioned, modest, reading, writ- ing and arithmetic ambitions of historic schooling, and proponents of advanced academic thinking, located mainly in project offices of great corporate non-profit foundations like Carnegie and Rockefeller - men who worked diligently to lead institutional schooling toward a scientific rationalization of all social affairs.

Neither report received much public attention. While both are available for examination today, vir- tually hobody is aware they even exist. Every major teachers' college in America flushed them down the memory hole, under whose orders nobody knows. Two decades after WWII, between 1967 and 1974, teacher train- ing was radically revamped through the coordinated efforts of im- portant private foundations, select universities, think-tanks, and government agencies, encouraged by major global corporations and harmonized through the US Office of Education and a few key state education departments, particularly those of California, Texas, New York, Michigan, Indiana, Florida, and Pennsylvania. Three milestones in this transformation were: (I) an extensive government exercise in futurology called Designing Education for the Future; (2) The Behavioral Science Teacher Education Project; and (3) Benjamin Bloom's multi-volume Taxonomy of Educational Objec- tives, an enormous manual of over 1,000 pages out of Blooms office at the University of Chicago. Later, this work impacted every school in America. Blooms massive effort is the work of a genuine aca- demic madman, constituting, in his own words, \"a tool to classify the ways individuals are to act, think and feel as the result of some unit of instruction:' It's the \"think and feel\" part that gives the game away. Simple fascism would have stopped at action, but as Orwell warned in 1984, something deeper than fascism was happening.

Blooms insane epic is reminiscent of The Complete System of Med- ical Policing, proposed for Prussia by another mad German doctor in the late 18th century (in which every citizen was charged with con- tinually spying on every other citizen, detecting any sign of disease pathology, even a sniffie, and reporting it at once to authorities for re- medial action), Bloom spawned a horde of descendant forms: mastery learning; .outcomes-based education; school-to-work; classroom/ business \"partnerships;\" and more. You can detect Bloom at work in any initiative which seeks to classify students for the convenience of . social managers and businesses. Bloom-inspired programs are con- structed so as to offer useful data for controlling the minds and move- ments of the young - mapping the next adult generation for various agencies of social engineering. The second pillar of change agentry, Designing Education for the Future, belies its benign title and would well repay a disciplined read- through of its semi-literate prose. Produced by the US Office ofEdu- cation, it redefined \"education\" after the Prussian fashion as \"a means to achieve important economic and social goals of a national charac- ter:' No mention of personal goals are in evidence. State education agencies were henceforth ordered to act as on-site federal enforcers, ensuring compliance of local schools to central directives. Each state education department was to become \"an agent of change;' and these were advised to give up \"independent identity as well as authority;' ac- cepting a junior partnership with the federal government. Or suffer financial penalties for disobedience. Finally, consider the third gigantic project, twice the size of Blooms Taxonomy: the Behavioral Science Teacher Education Proj- ect (contract number: OEC-O-9-320424-4042), BSTEP for short, which clearly sets down government policy intentions for compulsory schooling, outlining reforms to be forced on the US after 1967.

The document identifies the future as one in which a small elite will control all important matters, a world in which participatory democracy will disappear, reduced to a meaningless voting prerogative in electoral campaigns, campaigns in which all serious candidates have been pre-selected to exclude trouble- makers. Politicians will still be able to threaten substantial change, but to deliver only token efforts to that end after election. Postmodern schooling, BSTEP continues, will focus on \"attitudes and skills compatible with a non-work world:' Like \"pleasure culti- vation:' You'll have no difficulty seeing the \"socialized\" classroom of WWI school reform - itself a radical departure from mental and character development - had evolved by 1967 into a full-scale labo- ratory of psychological manipulation.

Teachers as Therqpists The conversion of schools into laboratories was assisted by a curious phenomenon of the middle to late 1960s: a tremendous rise in school violence and general chaos which followed a now-forgotten policy declaration cooked up at the Ford Foundation, one which announced that henceforth, disciplining of children must reflect due process"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Everything You Know about Schools is Wrong 7 practices of the court system. Teachers and administrators were stripped overnight of any effective ability to keep order, since due pro- cess apparatus, of necessity slow and deliberate, is inadequate to the sudden outbreaks of childish mischief which occur, even in presum- ably good schools. A rough ad hoc justice is the principal way order was maintained historically. Without it, Ie deluge! Denied access to the ancient catalogue of ad hoc disciplinary tac- tics, classrooms descended into chaos, disorder spiraled out of con- trol- passing into dangerous terrain from what once had been only a realm of petty annoyance. As word passed through student ranks that teachers' hands were tied, crowds of excited kids surged through hall- ways, howling, screaming, banging on doors, attacking one another. Even displays of public fornication weren't unknown - at least not at my own school assignment at Intermediate School 44 in Community School District 3 on the Upper Westside of Manhattan, smack in the middle of one of the wealthiest communities in the country. But ap- peals to authority for help went unanswered. Instead of interrupting the fornicators, arsonists, muggers, and other hooligans forcibly (which we were repeatedly warned would expose teachers to legal action), the new policy required teachers to file complaints (on official complaint forms only). After that, a hear- ing date would be set and, assuming the accused showed up, both sides had the right to be represented by counsel, to summon wit- nesses, to cross-exainine. When that drama was complete, a ruling would issue from the assigned referee. Not at once, but in due time. If\"convicted;' students had the right to appeal the decision, and the whole wheel would turn once again. This in a universe of 1,200 12-14 year-old kids.

Curriculum had been redefined. Now teaching followed suit. We Don't Need Brains Between 1896 and 1920, a small group of industrialists and financiers, together with their private charitable foundations, heavily subsidized university chairs, researchers, and school administrators, actually spent more money on forced schooling's early years than did the gov- ernment. Just two men, Carnegie and Rockefeller, were themselves spending more as late as 1915. In this laissezjairefashion a system of \"modern\" schooling was constructed without any public participa- tion, or even much public knowledge. Motives were complex, but it will clear your head wonderfully to listen to what Rockefeller's Gen- eral Education Board thought the mission should be. Its statement occurs in multiple forms, this one taken from a 1906 document called Occasional Letter Number One: In our dreams ... people yield themselves with perfect do- cility to our molding hands. The present educational con- ventions [of intellectual and moral education] fade from . our minds, and unhampered by tradition we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive folk. We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into phi- losophers or men of learning or men of science. We have not to raise up from among them authors, educators, po- ets, or men of letters. We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians, nor lawyers, doctors, preachers, politicians, statesmen - of whom we· have an ample sup- ply. The task we set before ourselves is very simple ... we will organize children ... and teach them to do in a perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an imper- fect way.

Vietnam-era young men had been schooled in the 1950S and 1960s,jar more intensely schooled than either oj the two earlier groups, but now the four percent illiteracy of 1941, transmuted into the 19 percent illiteracy rate of 1952, was now 27 percent. And not only had the fraction of barely competent and competent readers dropped to 73 percent, but even a substantial chunk of these struggled mightily, unable to read a newspaper (or anything else) for pleasure. They could not sustain a thought or an argument, could not write well enough to manage their own affairs without assistance. Mute evidence of rising ineptitude is more compelling when tracked through the very minimal requirements of Army enlist- ment tests, because SAT scores are frequently \"renormed\" (inflated), whether to conceal the decline or not, your guess is as good as mine. By 1940, literacy as a national number stood at 96 percent for whites, 80 percent for blacks. Four of five blacks were literate in spite of all disadvantages. Yet, six decades later, the Adult Literacy Survey and the National Assessment of Educational Progress reported a 40 per- cent illiteracy rate among blacks - doubling the earlier deficiency - and a 17 percent rate for whites, more than quadrupling it. Yet money spent on schooling in real terms had grown 350 percent. Charles Murray and Richard Hernnstein contended in a na- tional #1-bestseller, The Bell Curve, that this was the result of selective breeding. Smart people got together with smart people - and dumb with dumb. If you're a eugenicist that sounds just right, until you re- member the inconvenient military data. The terrifying drop in liter- acy between the end ofWWII and the beginning of the Korean War happened inside a single decade. Even the most fervent natural selec- tion enthusiast wouldn't argue things work that quickly. The Bell Curve held that violence in black society was genetically programmed; but once again, data from outside the charmed circle in America pushing this biological reality was contradictory. My control group comes from South Africa, where 31 million blacks lived as of the year 2000 - the same number as in the US. During 1989 to 1991, civil war conditions existed in South Africa. Then how to account for"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Everything You Know about Schools is Wrong II the embarrassing truth that death by violence among blacks there was only one-quarter of what it was in America? A second corrective piece of information turned up as I was writ- ing this: data from nearly all-black Jamaica for the year 2004 shows the literacy rate there at 98.5 percent, considerably higher than the 2005 American rate for whites - 83 percent. What might explain the sharp decline in literacy among blacks, if not bad biology~ Consider this: during WWII, American public schools - first in urban areas, then everywhere - were converted from phonetic ways of instruction (the ancient \"alphabet system\") to non-phonetic methods which involved memorizing whole word units, and lots of guessing for unfamiliar words. Whites had been learning to read at home for 300 years the old-fashioned way - matching spoken sounds to written letters - and white homes preserved this tool even when schools left it behind. There was a re- source available to whites which hardly existed for blacks. During slavery, blacks had been forbidden to learn to read; as late as 1930 they averaged only three to four years of schooling. When teachers stopped teaching a phonetic system - known to work - blacks had no fallback position. By 1952 the Army had hired a brigade of psychologists to expose what it believed must be mass fraud, so many were failing to qualify. As Regna Lee Woods described it in Checker Finn and Diane Rav- itch's Network News and Reviews: After the psychologists told the officers the graduates weren't faking, Defense Department administrators knew some- thing terrible had happened to grade school reading instruc- tion. Why they remained silent, no one knows. The switch to reading instruction that worked should have been made then. But it wasn't.

Transcending Nature It's time to meet William Torrey Harris, US Commissioner ofEduca~ tion from 1889 to 1906, the premier Hegelian philosopher in America, editor of The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. Other than Ellwood P. Cubberley and James Bryant Conant, no professional pedagogue ever approached the influence Harris once wielded. Harris standard~ ized our national schooling and Germanized it. Teacher colleges gloss over Harris, referring to him as a conservative defender of classical education standards, but he was intensely radical, regarding chil~ dren as the absolute property of the political state, and he was a per~ sonal friend of Andrew Carnegie - the steel man who nourished a hope that all work could be yoked to cradle~to~grave schooling - the grandfather of all school~to~work projects. Perhaps Walt Whitman had been anticipating Harris and Car~ negie when he wrote that \"only Hegel is fit for America:' Hegel, the protean Prussian philosopher whose power molded Karl Marx on the one hand and J.

Waitingfor Teacher to Grant Your Turn Harris and associates, known to academic philosophy as the \"St. Louis Hegelians\" worked toward a strange goal, bringing an end to history. Fixing global society into frozen relationships in which all argument would end, and with argument gone, the urge to war and revolution as well. Just amicable folk waiting around pleasantly for someone to tell them what to do, like the Eloi in H.G. Wells' The Time Machine. Waiting in tutelary relationships for someone to signal each individ- ual's turn. The tool to build such a society was psychological alienation, said Harris. To alienate children from themselves so they could no longer turn inward for strength, to alienate them from families, traditions, religions, cultures - so no outside source of advice could contradict the will of the political state. You need to hear Harris' own voice now, to fully appreciate what the principal school figure in America was thinking at the very moment institutional schooling was coming to- gether here: Ninety-nine [students] out of a hundred are automata, care- ful to walk in prescribed paths, careful to follow the pre- scribed custom. This is not an accident but the result of substantial education which, scientifically defined, is the subsumption of the individuaL ... The great purpose of school [self-alienation] can be re- alized better in dark, airless, ugly places.... It is to master the physical self, to transcend the beauty of nature. School should develop the power to withdraw from the external world.

Consider that such a social order can't produce very much sat- isfying work - the kind where personal sovereignty is exercised. As this social order matures, so many dissatisfied people are its byprod- uct that daily life is rocked by instability. But if you can be persuaded to blame yourself rather than a group of villains for your miserable lot, the dangerous gas goes out of the social balloon. When you flip hamburgers, sit at a computer all day , unpack and shelve merchandise from China year after year, you manage the te- dium better if you have a shallow inner life, one you can escape through booze, drugs, sex, media, or other low level addictive behav- iors. Easier to keep sane if your inner life is shallow. School, thought Harris the great American schoolman, should prepare ordinary men and women for lifetimes of alienation. Can you say he wasn't fully rational? The transformation of school from a place of modest ambitions centering around reading, writing, arithmetic, and decency into a be- havioral training laboratory ordered up by \"certain industrialists and the innovative who were altering the nature of the industrial process\" (as Harvard president James Bryant Conant wrote), has acted to poi- son the American experiment.

Darwin himself had spoken. And the labora- tories of Germany. Horace Manns efforts to make school attendance compulsory were bankrolled by men of wealth, including the brilliant Peabody family of New England. Mann was promised Daniel Webster's seat in Congress if he could pull off the trick, and he did, winning the Con- gressional seat as a prize. But we know the America of Manns day was already formidably literate and full of opportunity, so any attempt to portray this as philanthropy shouldn't be taken seriously. In every age, men of wealth and power have approached educa- tion for ordinary people with suspicion because it is certain to stim- ulate discontent, certain to awaken desires impossible to gratify. In April 1872, the US Bureau of Education's Circular of Information left nothing to the imagination when it discussed something it called \"the problem of educational schooling:' According to the Bureau, by in- culcating accurate knowledge workers would \"perceive and calculate their grievances;' making them \"redoubtable foes\" in labor struggles! Best not have that. Thirteen years later in 1885, the Senate Committee on Education and Labor issued a report which contains this forceful observation on page 1382: \"We believe that education is one of the principal causes of discontent oflate years manifesting itself among the laboring classes:' Teaching the means to become broadly knowledgeable, deeply analyt- ical, and effectively expressive has disturbed policy thinkers since Sol- omon, because these skills introduce danger into the eternal need of leaders to manage crowds in the interests of the best people. Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations called for \"educational schooling\" to correct the human damage caused by ~indless working environ- ments, but Andrew Carnegie, writing 126 years after Smith, in The Empire of Business disagreed.

He said it was something naturally to be expected. A stupendous revolution in marketing had taken place under the public nose, one brought about by the reality of mass production which could not be constrained to simply meet human· demands, but instead imposed the demands of production on human wishes. Where once the conventional laws of supply and demand put the buyer in the driver's seat, in the topsy-turvy world of financial capi- talism demand had to be created for whatever could be supplied most profitably at the moment. To keep this golden goose laying eggs, consumption had to be taught as the most important end of life. It was this new reality, he said, that explained business manipulation of schooling: It is natural businessmen should seek to influence the enact- ment and administration oflaws, national and international, and that they should try to control education. Keep that uppermost in your mind as you read my book. A Different Agenda The new forced schooling octopus taught anyone unable to escape its tentacles that inert knowledge - memorizing the dots - is the gold standard of intellectual achievement. Not connecting those dots. It set out to create a reflexive obedience to official directions as opposed to accepting responsibility for one's own learning. These habit trainings are among the most important weapons of mass instruction. On the higher levels of the school pyramid, among those labeled \"gifted\" and \"talented;' the standard is more sophisti- cated: there children are required to memorize both dots as well as what experts say is the correct way to connect those dots into nar- ratives: even to memorize several conflicting expert analyses in a simulation of genuine critical thinking. Original thinking in dot con-"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Everything You Know about Schools is Wrong 17 nection is patronized at times, but always subtly discouraged. Twelve to twenty years of stupefying memorization drills weakens the hardi- est intellects. Long before this habit training took hold, America was, by any historical yardstick, formidably well-educated, a place of aggressively free speech and argument - dynamically entrepreneurial, dazzlingly inventive, and as egalitarian a place as human nature could tolerate. Social class distinctions were relatively fluid since merit in simple free-market economies produces its own rewards, including advanta- geous marriages. Although the same currents of class privilege which ran in Europe were always present in America, the crucial difference was they were vigorously contested there. America was literate beyond anybody's wildest dreams, and not merely book-literate. Americans were broadly proficient in the formi- dable \"active literacies\" of writing, argumentation, and public speak- ing; things which had actually been a crime to teach ordinary people under British colonial rule. Foreign travelers like Tocqueville were surprised and impressed with what the new nation demonstrated in action about the talents of ordinary men and women - abilities cus- tomarily suppressed in Europe among the common classes. We were embarked on a unique libertarian path right up to the Civil War, until post-war fallout put an end to its career in reality, al- though the original myths are still with us. The transition from an entrepreneurial economy to a mass production economy, which be- gan soon after the end of hostilities, wrenched the country from its . freedom-loving course and placed it along the path toward industrial capitalism - with its need for visible underclasses and a large, root- less proletariat to make it work.

By the end of the same decade, Mann's (imaginaryl) visit to see Prussian schools in action - and his famously favorable report of that visit to the Boston School Committee - soon led to the first successfuF school law in US history. Brownson's larger theory, that a group existed out of sight intent on recasting American national life to meet British and German standards, should be kept in mind as we proceed into the dark world of compulsory schooling. Right from its advent the school institution was not popular. There wasn't any rush to sign on. It took a full IS years for one more state to come aboard, but a telling clue exists to let us know where the evangelical energy driving the scheme was actually being housed. Al- though no second American state followed Massachusetts for a de- cade and a hal£ the tiny District of Columbia adopted compulsion in I Mann, through careless planning, acrually arrived in Prussia after schools were closed for the summer, a fact he concealed from the committee. 2 Earlier school laws existed, but they were widely ignored."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Everything You Know about Schools is Wrong 19 its schools almost at once! It was from Washington's bribes, subsidies, and cajolings that institutional schooling spread, not from the merit of the idea. The myth of a golden age of public schooling is the creation of Ell- wood P. Cubberley, Dean of Teacher Education at Stanford Univer- sity. There never was such a thing. Cubberley rose to become a leader of the school group around WWI, and remained a close associate of all other names of consequence in the founding period. He acted, de facto, as a beloved historian of American schooling until theI960s. Eliminating Local Voices At the start of the compulsion era there were approximately 135,000 separate citizen school boards, perhaps more, each with seven to nine very solid and very local men and women as board members, watch- dogs over the local institution. Messy as their operation was - and you can get a sample of how they worked by reading Edward Egg- leston's little 19th century classic, The Hoosier Schoolmaster - they were models of democratically elected republicanism. But local over- sight promised nothing but trouble to those who wanted national uniformity. That centrali:z;ation was never likely to happen as long as community boards held sway, with local philosophies and overly sen- timentalized personal connections with parents. Almost at once, even before compulsion had claimed every Amer- ican state, a process of consolidation began, intended to curb local- ism. By arranging for larger and larger bureaucratic units, only those with funds enough and reputation to campaign at large beyond the neighborhood could be elected. These mergers were sold as efficiency measures to save taxpayers money, but an oddity occurred - as the districts were enlarged, costs went up, not down, and continued up- ward in subsequent years. With local watchdogs gone, tendencies to use mass schooling as a cash cow were exploited by every special in- terest group with political friends .. Inside of a century the number of boards was reduced to 15,000. And each decline in the absolute number of school boards made their"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"20 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION composition less and less local. Board seats became stepping stones for the ambitions of politicians, insurance policies for interests which drew their sustenance from school affairs: real estate people, textbook publishers, materials suppliers, et al. I remember the shock I felt the first time I discovered, quite by accident, that I could personally negotiate larger discounts on book purchases (or anything else) than the school district could. It didn't seem to make sense.! The most personally troubling occasion was the moment I decided to use my own fUnds to purchase classroom sets of good books for student use rather than rely on the \"approved\" list of books for which school fUnds could be used, and which required many months, if not a fUll year, to pass through the acquisition proto- cols and be shipped. Traveling to a book wholesaler, open to anybody, to secure its standard 40% discount, as I stood at the cash register with a hundred copies of Moby Dick and a hundred copies of Shake- speare's Plays in shopping carts, the checkout clerk asked me, ':Are you a schoolteacher?\" Without thinking, I nodded affirmatively, after which she rang the books up at a 25% discount. \"You've made a mistake;' I told her. \"The discount is 40%:' \"Not for schoolteachers;' she replied curtly. And when I bellowed in angry protest, she became indignant. \"Look;' she said, \"that's the discount your Board of Education negotiated. If you don't like it, take it up with them:' Now why on earth would my employer sell outmy right to a stan- dard discount? Can you think of a reason that isn't crooked? And, of course, it wasn't only my right to a fUll discount the school aut~orities had stolen, but every teacher's right in New York City. Perhaps this 1 In one instance, for example, the school board voted to buy 5,000 copies of the Har-Brace College Handbook (a grammar/usage guide) for $11.00 a copy at the mo- ment it was being remaindered by the publisher's own book outlet for $1.00 a copy, a $50,000 net difference. When this was pointed out by my wife Janet - a mem- ber of the school board at the time who demanded a vote be taken - the balance of the board refused to buy the cheaper copies! Many other examples could be given. Reams of blank paper available for $1.50 a ream in bulk to anyone, were purchased by my school district for $2.50 a ream."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Everything You Know about Schools is Wrong 21 will help you understand why I tided this chapter \"Everything You Know about Schools is Wrong:' I remember another moment when I told the assistant princi- pal that I could save him about 40% on the purchase of some world globes and he said without hesitation, \"It isn't your money. What are you getting all worked up about?\" I realize how cynical that sounds, but heres the paradox: this was a decent man who showed by his daily behavior he actually cared about student welfare. And the Har-Brace Handbook affair? It wasn't arranged by the Tweed gang, but by middle-class neighbors speaking as represen- tatives of a very progressive neighborhood, the Upper West Side of Manhattan, home to Columbia University , the Historical Society, Fordham, the Opera, the Symphony, the Museum of Natural His- tory ... and School District Three. The principle of citizen oversight had become part of the great school illusion, part of the house of mirrors inside which classrooms had been made teacher-proof; schools, principal-proof; school dis- tricts, superintendent-proo£ Responsibility had migrated elsewhere, but few knew quite where. In any important matters, state depart- ments of education were little better than stooges, the Federal De- partment of Education - ditto. In the new world of forced schooling, the training of the young was simply too important a matter to be left to pedagogues, just as had been the situation in ancient Rome. Tracing the word pedagogue to its origin in Rome is useful because it leads us to the threshold of the mystery. The Roman pedagogue was only a slave, albeit a special- ized kind of slave. He was assigned the task of driving home a cur- riculum created by the Master who owned him, and making sure the pupil got to school on time. But who was the master, and where did he live? For a compelling answer. to that question, you must read Thomas Hobbes' immortal book, The Leviathan, written in the first half of the seventeenth century and kept in print ever since. I wouldn't dream of spoiling the surprise you have in store when you discover that the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"22 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION elaborate system of social control official schooling represents has been a vigorously worked out idea for at least 400 years. The real question you should be asking is why, in all the years of school incar- ceration you suffered, did nobody bother to let you in on the secret? The Fourth Purpose As the initially transparent motives for schooling were undermined, professionalized pedagogy worked in tandem with government to re- commit the institution to the service of corporate economy. Recall that government schooling had been forbidden by default in the fed- eral Constitution, which contains not a single mention of the thing. But the utility it promised for governors - who had no intention of ever honoring a Bill of Rights dedicated to ordinary people - was enormous. Let me select only a few benefits school can offer elites. And let these stand for many more. Any political management, even tyranny, must provide enough work for ordinary peo'ple that revolutionary conditions dont emerge. Forced schooling provides a spectacular jobs project, one almost infi- nitely elastic, one expanding and contracting with employment needs. It should be no secret to you that institutional schooling, with all its outriggers, is the principal employer in the United States. And such a formidable granter of contracts that even the Defense Department (a similar jobs project) can't keep up. School is also an efficient way of ensuring loyalty to certain ideas and attitudes; its potential employees can be pre-screened for posses- sion of these, or at the very least for a willingness to conform to them. School is also a tax-absorption mechanism which can claim to be draining resources from the body politic for the good of the next gen- eration, while actually routing a goodly portion of these revenues to friends of the house. My tales of book-buying and materials purchase in School District Three, Manhattan, is only the smallest sample of what is possible. Consider the national school milk purchasing scan- dal of several decades ago when it was discovered that allover the na- tion, schools were paying more for milk than retail purchasers!"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Everything You Know about Schools is Wrong 23 From its beginnings, forced schooling represented a big step back- wards from the exciting free market in learning offered by the bazaar of American life, a market well-illustrated in the lives of Franklin, Jef- ferson, Farragut, and many others. This asystematic system of learn- ing put the nation on a road to unparalleled power and wealth. And Americas young responded brilliantly to it, out-inventing and out- trading every old world competitor by a country mile. But in the new fashion, different goals were promulgated, goals for which self-reliance, ingenuity, courage, competence, and other fron- tier virtues became liabilities (because they threatened the authority of management). Under the new system, the goals of good moral val- ues, good citizenship skills, and good personal development were ex- changed for a novel fourth purpose - becoming a human resource to be spent by businessmen and politicians. By the end of the nineteenth century, school was looked at by insiders as a branch of industry. In those more innocent times, the creators of schooling were remarkably candid about what they were up to, a candor which shines through a speech delivered in 1909 by Woodrow Wilson to an audience of bus i- ness men in New York City. I mentioned this in the Prologue, but it bears hearing again: We want one class to have a liberal education. We want an- other class, a very m~ch larger class of necessity, to forgo the privilege of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks. Forgoing the privilege of education was not to be a matter of choice, which probably explains why Wilsons remarks were not broadcast to the common public but were made behind closed doors. By 1917 all major school administrative jobs nationwide were under control of a group referred to in the press of the day as \"the education trust:' A record of the first meeting of the trust in Cleveland, Ohio exists, and an attendance roll showing that the interests of Rockefeller and Car- negie were represented, together with those of Harvard, Stanford, the University of Chicago, and the National Education Association."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"24 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION British evolutionist Benjamin Kidd wrote in 1918 that the chief end of the project was \"to impose on the young the ideal of subordina- tion:' The Specter of Overproduction You should be champing at the bit by now demanding to know why all this was being encouraged by the principal families in the nation. Were they so venal and greedy, so saturated with prejudice, that they were willing to sacrifice our revolutionary egalitarian traditions for personal advantage? I'm sure some were, but to say \"all\" would be to commit a huge oversimplification and a great injustice as welL The folks who gave us forced schooling on the Prussian template were among the finest, most honorable families in the land. Their demo- cratic instincts had been deeply shaken by the biological speculations of Charles Darwin, and by the philosophies of Benedict Spinoza and Johann Fichte (of whom we shall hear specifics in a later chapter), but it took a very down-to-earth, nuts-and-bolts economic idea to seal the fate of hundreds of millions of schoolchildren to come. The idea went by the name , overproduction, and it's still with US (although now referred to as overcapacity), and it's a very important concept indeed, one whose effects had staggered American prosperity mor~ than once in the nineteenth century. In essence, to overproduce is to make more goods and services for sale than there are customers for those things. When that happens, prices fall. Depending on the degree of overproduction they continue to fall, even below the cost of production. Even so far below costs that the capital required to pro- duce at all is wiped out. Hidden behind a bonanza for customers when that happens, a dangerous reality lurks: to produce at all in a mass production sense requires huge amounts of money to be assembled from investors for the purchase of production machinery, and for its repair and upgrad- ing, training programs, advertising, a distribution infrastructure, and so on. Unless protection against overproduction is promised inves- tors, why would anyone risk capital to produce in the first place:'"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Everything You Know about Schools is Wrong 25 What nineteenth century American experience demonstrated unmistakably is that an independent, resourcefUl, too well-educated common population has the irresistible urge to produce - and the ability to do so. Many famous \"panics\" of nineteenth century America were caused in part by a hangover from early Federal times and Co- lonial days when the common ideal was to produce your own food, your own clothing, your own shelter, your own education, your own medical care, your own entertainment, etc. The common population was still insufficiently conditioned to be interdependent and special- ized. And added to this burden of self-sufficiency (from' a corpo- rate point of view) was the incredible inventiveness of the American people, a natural by-product of three factors: an open-source learning tradition; a heterogeneous, mixed-age society which didn't exclude the young from fUll participation; and a government presence with- out heavy-handedness. Given this heady brew, inventions poured out of the American population with dazzling speed, at a pace unknown in the rest of the world's experience. Unexpected invention is proba- bly the easiest way to provoke the creative destruction which ends the career of otherwise dominant enterprises under capitalism. Ideas are just as deadly in overproduction as hats are, or bushels of corn. From 1880 to 1930, the term \"overproduction\" was heard every- where, in boardrooms, elite universities, gentlemen's clubs, and highbrow magazines. It was a demon which had to be locked in the dungeon. And rationalized pedagogy was a natural vehicle to implant habits and attitudes to accomplish that end. Under this outlook, the classroom would never be used to produce knowledge, but only to consume it; it would not encourage the confined to produce ideas, only to consume the ideas of others. The ultimate goal implanted in student minds, which replaced the earlier goal of independent liveli- hoods, was getting a good job.

For the first two centuries of our existence, such an institu- tion would have been unthinkable - the young were too valuable a part of economic and social reality. Indispensable, in fact. But when the young were assigned to consume, not produce; when they were ordered to be passive, not active, as part of the general society, the schools we have were the inevitable result of this transformation.

I think you'll see what I mean when I tell you Bud's miracle. Prior tei WWII, Bud was a steelworker and a deckhand on the pad- dle-wheel river steamers which went from Pittsburgh to New Orleans. He was a tough, tough young man, looked a lot like John Wayne in Stagecoach , and the ladies loved him. But he was a high-school dropout. He enlisted to go to war in 1942 when I was seven, and I saw the troop train carry him off one night. Somehow he qualified for Officer's Can- didate School, and was eventually shipped off to Europe to join the in- vasion as a lieutenant. In his platoon was an enlisted man, Al Rockwell, who would one day be heir to the Rockwell Manufacturing empire.

He said, \"I want you to load 12s-pound slabs of steel onto boxcars from nine to five every day. I want you to live with me near the Rockwell plant in Ohio and pay room and board. How's that sound?\" It turned out that Bud was the manager of the plant, employing thousands. \"I have two dozen Harvard hotshots working for me;' he said. \"They ' ll do anything I want: shine my shoes, wax my car , but I can't let them see me favoring my nephew, so I'll have to work you twice as hard as anyone else.

I was too unworldly at the time to even think of the big mystery - how on earth could a common steelworker without an edu- cation be ordering Harvard graduates around?

Open-source learning accepts that everything un- der the sun might be a possible starting point on the road to self-mas- tery and a good life - garage work, poker, lap dancing, whatever.

And everyone you encounter is a potential teacher: garage me- chanics, card sharps, lap dancers, race car drivers, everyone. Potter Stewart, the former Supreme Court Justice, once remarked he couldn't define pornography, but he knew it when he saw it. Open- source is like that. To hedge it in with official algorithms is to ruin it, but I owe you at least a rough abstract: in open source, teaching is a function. Not a profession. Anyone with something to offer can teach. The student determines who is or is not a teacher, not the govern- ment. In open source, you don't need a license to teach any more than Socrates did. Right there you can feel how different the basic assump- tions of open source are. No student faces failure for deciding not to learn from you. In open source, students are active initiators.

Shen Wenrong The Financial Times of March 17, 2006, tells the story of a silent con- test between college-trained executives and engineers, and a band of Chinese peasants.

Not long ago, the ThyssenKrupp Corporation of Germany de- cided to unload its mighty \"Phoenix\" steel plant in Dortmund. Steel prices were down, and it looked to management as if they would stay down, so the decision was made to sell all 220 acres of buildings to China, even though that would throw 10,000 Germans out of work. Management expected two payoffs: one in the sales price, and one in the bill to move the plant from Dortmund to near Shanghai. ThyssenKrupp estimated that would take three years and an army"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"3 2 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION of specialists. China bought Phoenix, but choked on the moving bill. They would do the job themselves. One fine day a raggedy band of a thousand peasants led by peas- ant Shen Wenrong showed up in Dortmund. Here's a capsule of data to help you think about Mr. Shen: He didn't use a computer. He didn't have a real office. He worked from behind something looking suspiciously like a kid's school desk. Shens first computer-less, office- less decision was to avoid German housing and meal costs. In three weeks, his crew built its own dormitories and commissary. Then it broke the steel plant down. Crated it. Shipped it to China. Uncrated it. And set it back up, inside of one year, not three. Numer- ous rules were broken in the process whenever more creative prob- lem-solving seemed appropriate. In the time it took to move Phoenix, Chinas huge orders for steel on world markets drove prices through the roo£ exactly as Chinas planners had calculated would happen. Phoenix in China was a big money-maker from the beginning, just as it would have been ifleft in Germany. So the ignorant Chinese not only worked harder than the Germans, they had better judgement, too. How were we ever tricked into believing that specialists are needed for matters well within the reach of ordinary people? How did we come to think so little of ourselves? If unschooled peasants can de- molish and re-erect a steel plant three times faster than professionals, then you and I need to re-examine everything we've been conditioned to accept as truth. Everything. That's called dialectical thinking. Once dialectics was central to school, but we don't teach it anymore.

The Graduate You're on the road to being educated when you know yourself so thor- oughly you write your own script instead of taking a part written by others. A migrant fruit picker named Charles Webb fits this descrip- tion for me. You've very likely consumed a piece of Mr. Webb's imagi- nation, if not the fruit, if you've ever seen the classic American film, The Graduate. Webb sold millions of copies of the book, and his film became a beacon to an entire generation of American young people. It's theme, that a life built around buying things is a disaster, helped turn the film into a runaway hit, still shown and still rented years later. Charles and his wife made millions and were on every A-team guest list from Easthampton to Maui. As their life turned into the non-life of perpetual celebrity and celebrity projects, Webb and his wife made the copyright over to the Anti-Defamation League, gave their entire fortune away, and set out as vagabonds in a trailer, at one time becoming migrants picking fruit in California. \"Wealth didn't work for us;' he said.

John Kanzius On April 13, 2008, television show Sixty Minutes reported a hereto- fore unknown method of killing cancer had been invented by a patient with no background in science and no college degree. Nobel-Prize winning cancer researcher Rick Smalley said that it was the most im- pressive development he had ever seen in his life, that it \"would change medicine forever:' The Kanzius method destroys tumors without chemotherapy, surgery, or familiar radiation. After 36 rounds of chemo, John Kan- zius was desperate enough to wrack his own brains for something which the cancer empire had missed, and he found such a thing in memories of his boyhood hobby as a radio hobbyist. As a kid, Kan- zius had been intrigued by a curious fact: that when harmless radio waves passed through metal, the metal heated up. Was it possible that a tumor injected with metal particles could be killed by passing radio waves through it? Ridiculous idea, isn't it?

Twenty years ago I was talking to some Amish fellows in Barnes- ville, Ohio, about our ridiculous space program and its waste of scarce resources.

The Artificial Extension of Childhood The same young people we confine to classrooms these days once cleared this continent when it was a wilderness, built roads , canals, cities; whipped the greatest military power of earth not once but twice, sold ice to faraway India before refrigeration, and produced so many miracles - from the six-shooter to the steamboat to manned flight - that America spread glimmerings of what open-source cre- ativity could do all around the planet. In those days Americans weren't burdened by a concept of the phony stage oflife called\"adolescence;' or any other artificial extension"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"40 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION of childhood. About the age of seven you added value to the world around you, or you were a parasite. Like all sane people, so~called kids wanted to grow up as soon as possible - that's why old photos show boys and girls looking like men and women. All that takes is carrying your share of the load, and a few open~source adventures and presto! You are grown up. In Ben Franklin's day when you were ready to take your turn, no pseudo~sciences out of Germany stood in your way. The pre~Civil War American economy was dominated by inde~ pendent livelihoods, and even after the war, for another fifty years or so, young men (who would be called \"boys\" today) like Andrew Car~ negie could start life as an elementary school dropout at the age of seven, and be partners in business with the president of the Penn~ sylvania Railroad at age 20. Are similar lives being fashioned today? Of course they are, but it isn't considered wise to talk about it openly anymore. Think of Shawn Fanning with his millions from starting Napster at age 18, and Fanning is far from alone - it's just that those lucky ones allowed to do it are far more discreet in our time. An earlier America celebrated accomplishment and shrewd~ ness from any source. Kids weren't locked away to provide employ~ ment for millions. America had room for anyone with energy, brass, and ideas. Foreign visitors like Tocqueville and DuPont de Nemours were constantly being dazzled by the high energy released in a society reaching for revolutionary egalitarianism, one which mixed all ages together, took risks, and discarded the rigid categories of European tradition. Our Civil War changed everything for the worse. Forget the pro~ paganda you heard in school, it had nothing to do with slavery. By 1860 Europe had already abandoned the slave institution, and the United States was very close to doing the same - it wouldn't have lasted twenty more years, for many reasons, most interesting of which, for me, is the simple fact that wage~slaves, free in name only, are much cheaper to exploit, and work harder than slaves. As soon as you put the red herring of slavery out of mind, the con~ test between family and nature as centers of meaning (versus profit"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Walkabout: London 4I achieved byconverting human beings into human resources) becomes clear. Northern industrialists were already privy to the power and for- tune being earned converting large populations in Britain, Germany, and elsewhere from a yeomanry into a proletariat. They lusted after similar advantages, but were sophisticated enough to realize that the American traditions of independence, self-reliance, ingenuity, family, and religious worship would have to be marginalized first before this transformation could successfully be worked. Compulsory school laws to break up family closeness were a big part of the package in Germany, and that German magic was coveted in the drawing rooms of New York and Boston. In the industrial state which emerged rampant in the wake of the Civil War, the entrepreneurial egalitarianism of the original American design was put to death by factories and licensing laws, government interventions and requirements, and eventually by forced schooling. By 1880, factories and financiers ruled the American roost, and a pro- fessional proletariat of academics, lawyers, politicians, and others de- pendent on the favor of the mighty were making it hot for Americans who fought to maintain a libertarian nation as promised by the Dec- laration and the Bill of Rights. With this radical transformation from local democracy to de facto oligarchy, people with minds of their own became an impediment to efficient management. Think of it this way: lives assigned to routine work are best kept childish. Childish people are not only obedient (if we discount their oc- casional tantrums), but they make the best consumers because they have little natural sales resistance. Since Plato, a stream of utopian writers has worked to give management recipes to cook childish lives; lives susceptible to the will of their betters. Take a second to think about these utopian algorithms - divid- ing people from one another and from their natural allies, is right at the head of the list, but all require wiping the slate as clean of close emotional ties - even ties to yourself! - as possible. Family, deep friendships, church, culture, tradition, anything which might contra- dict the voice of authority, is suspect. An independent mind is the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"42 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION worst danger of all, but twelve years spent in a school chair (and now in front of a computer terminal or television, etc.), will convert the most crowded inner life into a virtually blank slate. The trouble with open-source learning, as far as policymakers are concerned, is that it almost guarantees an independent mind and character will develop - not a cosmetic simulation of those things, which schooling cultivates. Even worse, taking charge of mixing your own education leads to a healthy self-regard - and confident folks are considerably less manageable than anxious ones. So, in the managerial utopia which came to be planned on pol- icy levels after the Southern side of our national dialectic was broken by Civil War, training of the young had to be pre-empted, or nearly so, and nets of rules had to replace the trial-and-error feedback loops of open source. Andrew Carnegie, one of the principal architects of the new command and control system saw its drawbacks clearly; he said it would act to some degree as an anti-meritocracy, denying a goodly number of the best quality people in every field the leadership their merit should have earned them - but on the whole Carnegie thought it was a fair bargain: exchanging merit for social stability and protection of capital. America's first national commissioner of education, eminent Hegelian scholar William Torrey Harris, said in a long essay in 1906 entitled \"The Philosophy of Education;' that a prime purpose of the new institutional schooling was to teach self-alienation (in the inter- ests of state and corporate security), and that this could be best ac- complished in dark, airless corridors. It never fails to amaze me how people can hear words like that - and the school trail is littered with them - and ignore them, as if they were only idle talk. It's time, I think, to face some basic truth: highly centralized mass production economies take on the character of oligarchies, they cant allow natural processes of capitalism to go unregulated; the creative destruction which Schumpeter saw as central to the health of mar- ket economoies cant be allowed to occur naturally. That's what the expression \"too big to be allowed to fail\" heard so frequently these"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Walkabout: London 43 days, along with its corollary, \"bail-out\" should signal to anyone with a modicum of economic training. The United States is now only nomi- nally a free market economy; corporate welfare is dominant, the enor- mous American military has not, for a very long time, been primarily about protecting common American citizens from harm. It exists for several never-discussed reasons: to provide employment for the un- derclasses; to avoid uprisings at home; to act as a centrifuge in distrib- uting wealth through contracts back to the managers of the system and their allies; and it exists, in the gravest extreme to \"go domes- tic;' an expression heard often at officer training facilities around the country, one well-illustrated by the now-legendary para-military in- terventions at Waco and Ruby Ridge. Highly centralized mass production economies cant function' well without colonizing individual minds and converting them into a mass mind. The conversion works best if started early, in the lower grades of elementary school, in kindergarten and pre-kindergarten. The function of these collective rituals we call school has very little to do with intellectual development - consider only the familiar mad- ness of teaching the colors and days of the week or months of the year to little people who come to school already knowing those things. The collective rituals oflower grades are about habit training, about prac- ticing attention and fealty to authority. In this way, independent con- sciousness can be undermined in its formative stages. The opposite of mass-mindedness is dialectical-mindedness. A tremendous example of this is buried in the foundational religious documents of western culture, in the story of young Jesus closely questioning elders in the temple after slipping away from his parents, itself a contrarian action. Indeed, the New Testament is so replete with contrarianism it's little wonder it plays no part in institutional school- ing, although it plays a stupendous part in western history from the beginning of the modern era until today.

Take the matter of personal production as opposed to consump- tion; production of goods, values, ideas, and marching orders. Co- lonial and early federal America held the ideal of self-sufficiency as the very pinnacle of achievement. The ideal household aimed to pro- duce its own food, clothing, shelter, entertainment, transportation, medical care, education, child care, and social security. A large frac- tion of the population never got there, but as a City on the Hill to strive for it was an ennobling vision which some families, especially on the frontier, succeeding in making happen. It was this idea of be- ing personally empowered, in contrast to the servile states of Europe and Asia, which acted as a magnet for the world's peoples - not the prospect of two cars, a house in the suburbs, and the latest computer junk. Were that vision to have been maintained through forced school- ing, it would have destroyed corporations in embryo. Overproduc- tion would have strangled capital accumulation by posing continuous competition - and without capital accumulation, no dominant cor- porations. Far from production as an ideal, it was consumption that had to be encouraged. School had to train in consumption habits: listen- ing to others, moving on a bell or horn signal without questioning, becoming impressionable - more accurately, gullible - in order to do well on tests. Kids who insisted on producing their own lives had to be humiliated publicly as a warning to others. Producing yourself is the ultimate form of production. For many years America's promise to the rest of the world's peoples was that if they could only manage to get here, no feudal order would thwart that dream. But after the Civil War, the argument between entrepre- neurial values - which inevitably celebrate open-source learning - and industrial values - by their nature feudal- was over. When the smoke cleared fifty years later, the imitation sciences of pedagogy and psychology had been imported from northern Ger- many, pressed into service through the school institution to create a"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Walkabout: London 45 proletariat: family-less, land-less people with only weak ties to reli- gion, tradition, or culture. Even the middle management and profes- sional strata are best seen as a proletariat, too - a professionalized proletariat - only lightly rooted in its relationships to people, places, or principles. To enlist public opinion behind this utopian transformation, a pathological state of youth, heretofore unrecognized by history, was designed by G. Stanley Hall of Johns Hopkins University. He called it adolescence and debuted the condition in a huge two-volume study of that name, published in 1904. Trained in Prussia as behavioral psy- chologist Wilhelm Wundt's first assistant, Hall (immensely influen- tial in school circles at the beginning of the 20th century) identified adolescence as a dangerously irrational state of human growth requir- ing psychological controls inculcated through schooling. As John Dewey's mentor at German-inspired Hopkins, Hall's invention seemed to justify the extension of state schooling into the teen years, institutionalizing the most productive fraction of human- ity for psychological treatment - in confinement with poorly edu- cated employees of the state given a virtual monopoly over training the young. In this dazzling coup, the teenagers who had helped build the new nation ~ere now officially deprived of fully engaged lives such as Edi- son or Carnegie had once enjoyed. A managerial class having forcefully emerged in America, the Anglo-Saxon strong class system was now being imposed on the United States through forced schooling. Walt Whitman once said, \"Only Hegel is fit for America;' and now, following Hegel's in- structions, history itself was being slowed down, the brakes put on change - by crippling the American arguments among ideas, peoples, sections, religions - through one-size-fits-all schooling. The hope for unending argument had been built into our very founding docu- ments, into the guarantees of free speech and access to deadly weap- onry given common citizens. Our division of powers - an executive, two houses of Congress, and a high court - a division which defies"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION engineering wisdom in its structural inefficiency - was meant to pre- serve argument as the best protection for common citizens. Power was to be kept decentralized in the original conception of the United States, and experts kept in their place: decision-making was for ordinary people, not specialists. But now, all that careful, all that caringly thoughtful architecture which made America so unique, was to be put to death through bulk-process, psychological school- ing, imposed by force. I urge you to examine in your own mind the assumptions which must lay behind using the police power to in- sist that once-sovereign spirits have no choice but to submit to be- ing schooled by strangers. Surely this is one of the most radical acts in human history, not the least of its breathtakingly radical assertions being that you must attend for your own good! It is the most striking evidence of the Teutonic mind at work behind the fa~ade of everyday schooling. Prior to the heavy-duty interventions of social engineering into the growing - up time, America - open-source educated for two hun- dred years - was a spectacularly resourceful and inventive society. One need only read the many journals written by early foreign visitors (Tocqueville's being the most prominent), to see how earth-shaking the liberty given to ordinary Americans really was. Nothing like the creative energy being released had ever been seen before, or was even dreamed of as possible. With few exceptions, invention is the prov- ince of youthful insight; cut that spring of ideas offby embedding the young in a network of rules and judgements, and you should expect important negative consequences. Shortly after adolescence was professionalized , a decline in the numbers of patent applications by Americans occurred. After WWII, when institutionalized schooling including college and kindergarten grew by leaps and bounds, that decline accelerated. Universal school- ing had weakened the imagination, just as Spinoza predicted it would in 1690, and Fichte predicted in the second decade of the 19th century. Of course, both those men were heartily in favor of that weakening; their school schemes were for the benefit of the \"best\" people. But if"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Walkabout: London 47 those relative ancients could work out the school mechanism and its negative effects long before it existed, surely you can, too.

The Honor Roll Craig Venter, the beach bum surfer who shared the laurels for pro- ducing the map of the human genome, was born in 1946. He found school exquisitely boring and took vengeance by driving teachers crazy. He cut class often to hit the boogie board and only escaped ju- nior high school because a teacher changed one of his \"F\" grades to \"0-\" so the school could be rid of him . Venter enlisted in the navy, serving as a medical corpsman in Viet- nam. There he learned to despise bureaucracy with its books of rules in place of allowing adaptation to unique situations. His autobiog - raphy, A Life Decoded, adds many details to this skeletal outline, but suffice it to say he was hardly anyone 's likely candidate for scientific immortality. Nor could Franklin Roosevelt have been predicted, from his \"C\" average in high school, and his \"c\" average in college. George W.

On Wasserman's part, he would smuggle out prints of the latest films from the theater, get them to the high school long before the movie opened, screen them for a low ad- mission fee for students, give the money to the principal to buy band instruments and football equipment, then rush the prints back to the theater before anyone arrived, with no one the wiser.

Ad infinitum. In many different words, Paul repeats over and over that the new congregations won't find salvation by following the old rules. Elimi- nate the religious background for a minute and what Paul faced was the school problem of our own day - the conflict between interest groups whose income and status derives from keeping things as they are, and an insurgency whose needs have been neglected by the en- trenched management and which demands profound change. Translated into contemporary idiom, Paul says make up the rules as you go along to fit individual cases. As long as the root principle of love is honored, then things will work out. The political establishment of Paul's day was the ancient Israel of the Mishnah, a stupendous collection of rules for even the most ob- scure circumstances like the height from which someone should pour water on a manure pile . Like modern bureaucratic schooling, there can be little adaptation to particular cases, the system is wedded to certainty. Find a thief? Cut off his nose! Find an adultress? Stone her to death! When in doubt, don't think - follow the rules. The new insurgency travelled a different road. If someone steals your coat, give him your cloak, too; if someone strikes your left cheek, turn the right one to be struck, too. Unto this last: pay workmen who labor half a day the same wage as those who labor a whole day. Rule book people find these pronouncements maddening, incom- prehensible.

The insurgency of 21st century America, still disorganized but daily becoming less so, has made its presence felt through the explosive growth of homeschooling, through the Internet, and through various novel areas of crime. Identity theft, a rarity throughout history, has become an unstoppable epidemic; huge commercial operations in film and music are seriously jeopardized by technologies which return control to the individual. The security of banks, government installations, and much more - like patents and copyrights - is under serious siege. Formulas for powerfUl weapons like the TATP bomb which para- lyzed London subways a few years ago, compounded ftom six pounds of peroxide, paint remover, and drain cleaner in the ratio of 3/3/1, sta- bilized with sawdust, and stuffed into a strong steel container to be detonated by a cell phone are circulating widely across the planet. Those materials cost less than $100 dollars and are available in every hardware store on earth. Our reckless military operations in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afgan- istan, have violated central precepts of warfare set down by Von Clausewitz - a superior technology doesn't promiscuously attack its victims, it threatens. To commit a major attack is to expose your technology to scrutiny, which holds two dangers: first, that expen- sive machinery is badly overmatched against an insurgency trained in guerrilla tactics, and second, that the enemy will gradually upgrade his own technology by studying your tactics and stealing your weap- ons. What America has to show for 50 years of continuous warfare against weak, stone-age opponents, is this: besides crippling our fU- ture with a reckless expenditure of capital on products which produce nothing, like weaponry, and destroy themselves in use, we have noti- fied every corner of the world that our overwhelming military isn't"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Walkabout: London 57 overwhelming at all and can be beaten by ordinary people of courage, with primitive military hardware, who refuse to be intimidated.

The Time of the Sweat Bath The day of the expert, and of an elite created by rationing informa- tion and using the power of government to load the dice, has reached a crisis point I don't think it can deal with. Existing contracts be- tween ourselves and the young don't work anymore. By supporting school-imposed order, however innocently, parents make enemies of their own children, sometimes lifelong enemies. Rimbaud, the young French poet, saw prophetically into the future this modern order of secular industrial values was creating. Over a hundred years ago, he wrote this, which fits our time better than his: This is the time of the sweat bath, of oceans boiling over, of underground explosions, of the planet whirled away, of ex- terminations sure to follow. In a time of the sweat bath, would you prefer as allies \"X' students with high SATs, or a walkabout like Richard Branson? A valedictorian or a surf bum like Craig Venter?

Walkabout: Monongahela I never walked through London as a four-year-old boy, but back in the early 1940S during World War II, I walked through the indus- trial river town of Monongahela, Pennsylvania several times a week at night, walked miles and miles with my mother, Bootie, and my sis- ter Joanie. We walked only at night so nobody my mother had once known would notice her and her children peering into the lighted windows of homes she had once frequented as a guest. We were living in her hometown, unseen, because she was embarrassed at the failure of her marriage. We were like anthropologists doing field studies, sister and I, studying our mother in different circumstances than we usually saw her: dusting, doing laundry, washing dishes. And mother was see- ing her own early self through a different filter, too. Whatever our motives for repeating the same long route through the darkened hill streets over and over, I can't remember, but I know I never tired of it.

As an old man, I now see they were easily the richest family experience I was ever to have. And my greatest educa- tional adventure, too, just as Branson's walk was his. We took the last walk together around 1947. Beginning seven years later and continuing for years afterward, I attended five colleges, two of them Ivy League, but my degree schooling proved to be a waste of time where intellectual development was concerned. I can't seem to recall a single thing I learned at those famous universities, Cornell and Columbia; not a single class, not a single teacher. Yet I remember everything about those walks, down to the tiniest details. Each excursion covered roughly five miles. We wove in and out of the darkened hill streets, reaching zones of settlement I was only dimly aware existed. I still hear our footsteps crunching the fall leaves or the winter snow, or sloshing through the spring rains. I can hear our hushed whispers. Every house had a story, and mother knew all of them. Many had a symbol in the front window telling the world that some man inside had gone away off to the wars. In some win- dows there was a special symbol - I seem to remember it was a gold star like they used to give to the best schoolchildren for exceptional work - a symbol which declared the man had died in service to the rest of us. The presence of death on our walks added something wonderfully deep and profound to the rambles, a sadness reminding me at the cor- ners of consciousness that someday my mother would be dead, too, and my sister, and myself. From time to time mother would reminisce what a particular sol- dier or sailor, once her schoolmate, had been like as a living boy. For a little fellow this was like being confronted with ghosts.

Reflecting on what I learned that way without effort tells me the most powerful ed- ucations are always put together open-source. They can't be achieved from somebody else's idea of which controlled inputs under which artificial conditions produce the best outputs.

Education must be largely self-initiated, a tapestry woven out of broad experience, constant introspection, abil- ity to concentrate on one's purpose in spite of distractions, a combi- nation of curiosity, patience, and intense watchfUlness, and it requires substantial trial and error risk-taking, along with a considerable abil- ity to take feedback from the environment - to learn from mistakes. I once heard someone in my own family, who I once loved very much, say,\"I don't take criticism well;' as ifit were a boast, and I knew at that instant there was no way at all for her to grow in mind or character with that self-destructive attitude. Let me tell you a little about fat Stanley, whose path crossed mine when he was thirteen. Stanley only came to class one or two days a month, and I knew that sooner or later he would be caught in the truancy net and prosecuted. I liked Stanley, not least because he never whined when other kids bothered him because he was fat - he simply punched them so hard in the head nobody ever bothered Stanley a second time. I hoped to spare him the grim experience of becoming a social service case. So I asked him one day what he did on all those absences:\" What he said changed my life. I never saw school the same way after Stanley spoke. It seems Stanley had five aunts and uncles, all in business for them- selves before the age of 21. His aim was to follow in their footsteps. Even at 13, he had been made aware of time's winged chariot hurry- ing near, that he had only eight years to make the miracle of an inde- pendent livelihood. One of the relatives was a florist, one a builder of unfinished furniture, one a deli owner, one had a little restaurant, one owned a delivery service. Stanley cut school to work without pay for each these relatives, bartering labor in exchange for learning the businesses - and a whole lot more - working in the company of men and women who cared for him much more than any professional stranger would have."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Fat Stanley and the Lancaster Amish It was a better educational package than whatever he missed cut- ting school, hands down. As he put it to me, man to man: \"This way I get a chance to see how the different businesses work. You tell me what books I have to read and I'll read them. But I don't have time to waste in school unless I want to end up like you - working for somebody else:' When I heard that, I couldn't keep him locked up in good conscience. Besides, his mother agreed with Stanley. So I be- gan to cover for him, logging him present when he was making flo- ral bouquets or building furniture. None of his other teachers ever asked; I think they were glad to be rid of him. To illustrate the power- ful energies at work under his fat, deceptively cheerful exterior, Stan- ley crossed his \"t\"s with a pointed spear formation, not a simple line. Right then and there I adopted his \"t\" cross as my own, to remind me what I learned from a truant that day. #~.~ r--.-J A big secret of bulk-process schooling is that it doesn't teach the way children learn; a bigger secret is that it isn't supposed to teach self- direction at all. Stanley-style is verboten. School is about learning to wait your turn, however long it takes to come, if ever. And how to sub- mit with a show of enthusiasm to the judgment of strangers, even if they are wrong; even if your enthusiasm is phony. School is the first impression we get of organized society and its relentless need to rank everyone on a scale of winners and losers; like most first imp~essions, the real things school teaches about your place in the social order last a lifetime for most of us. Work in classrooms isn't important work. It fails to speak to real needs pressing on the young. It doesn't answer burning questions which day-to-day experience forces upon young minds.

The net effect of making work abstract -"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION \"subject\" -centered - external to individual longings, fears, experi- ences, and questions, is to render students of this enforced irrelevance listless and indifferent. The causes of sluggishness in the young have been well under- stood for a long time. 1'm tempted to say forever. Growth and self- mastery are reserved for those who vigorously self-direct, like Stanley: planning, doing, creating, reflecting, freely associating, tak- ing chances, punching the lights out on your tormentors. But this is precisely the agenda school is set up to prevent. Think of school as a conditioning laboratory, drilling naturally unique, one-of-a-kind individuals to respond as a mass, to accept continual ennui, envy and limited competence as only natural parts of the human condi- tion. The official economy we have constructed demands constantly renewed supplies of leveled, spiritless, passive, anxious, friendless, family-less people who can be scrapped and replaced endlessly, and who will perform at maximum efficiency until their own time comes to be scrap; people who think the difference between Coke and Pepsi, or round hamburgers versus square ones, are subjects worthy of ar- gument.

As our economy has been shaped by its architects, it relies upon encouraging frenzy for novelty, for fashion in more than clothing, all the way to telephones. It's an attitude which induces nonstop con- sumption in a heady atmosphere of \"out with the old, in with the new;\" to escape from shame, an addiction to the spirit of the Cole Porter song, Anything Goes. That's the job the incessant bells per- form in our schools: they teach a Monty Pythonesque relief at escape from responsibility, as they say in bell language, \"And now for some- thing completely different:' Of course, you have to have deep experi- ence with shame to fear it.

Encourage other kids to shame them, too:' One famous insider of modern schooling back in the post-WWI days (when the model was hardening) called government school- ing \"the perfect organization of the hive:' That was H. H. Goddard, chairman of psychology at Princeton. Goddard believed standardized test scores used as a signal for privileged treatment would cause the lower classes to come face-to-face with their own biological inferior- ity. It would be like wearing a public dunce cap. Exactly the function \"special education\" delivers today. The pain of endless daily humili- ation would discourage reproduction among the inferior, Goddard thought. Charles Darwin had implied this gently, but his first cousin, Francis Galton, had virtually demanded it of responsible politicians on both sides of the Atlantic in his own writings. In 1930, the Department of Superintendence of the National Ed- ucation Association, a group then basking in reflected glory from the lessons of schooling in the new Soviet Union, declared the main pur- pose of schooling should be \"effective use of capital;' that valuable"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"66 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION stuff through which \"our urtprecedented wealth-producing power has been gained:' Now how do you suppose that idea got into circulation among the folks at a presumably left-wing organization?

Think for a second how \"capital\" can become \"more effective:' Surely it happens when the stuff capital allows to be produced is ac- tually purchased by eager consumers, and when projects financed by capital receive little public resistance. Capital operates most efficiently in climates without public opposition, where critical thinking among ordinary people is in a primitive state, so the public becomes an inept opponent. And is it so difficult to conceive of a plan which could be managed through the very institution - schooling - charged with development of the intellect? It isn't by accident the symbol of Fabian socialism is a wolf in sheep's clothing, or that Fabians were from the comfortable classes of England, not from its marginalized dregs (as was often true of revolutionary socialists). This is a matter of some significance, though never held up to scrutiny in schoolbook histo- ries. Where industrial management was content to kill the masses with brutal treatment, Fabians, led by Beatrice Webb, aimed to kill them with kindness. Hence we got the Welfare State. But whatever the methods, aims were identical. If school is to serve capital, then it must be a production line where children as raw material are shaped and fashioned like nails. To make capital more efficient would require capital accumulations be concentrated into fewer hands, not spread so widely among the popu- lace. Even that the middle-class basis of American society give way a little, too. Or eventually, give way a lot. Sixty-six years after this weirdly indiscreet slip by the NEA:s De- partment of Superintendence, Johns Hopkins University Press, in 1996, published a book, Fat and Mean, with surprising news about our by now well-schooled society.

During"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Fat Stanley and the Lancaster Amish the booms of the 1980s and 1990S, purchasing power had risen steeply for 20 percent of the population, but it actually declined for all the rest by 13 percent. After inflation was factored in, purchasing power of a working couple in 1995 was only 8 percent greater than for a single working man in 1905. The steep decline in common prosperity over 90 years of intense forced schooling drove both parents from the home to work, depos- iting their children in the management systems of daycare and ex- tended schooling. Despite a century-long harangue that schooling is the cure for unevenly spread wealth, exactly the reverse occurred. Wealth was 250 percent more concentrated at century's end than at its beginnings. The Old Order Amish took a different road. Today a group of about 150,000 people - quite prosperous although virtually un- schooled - a group held together by religion and common cul- ture which came to the US with little more than the clothes on their backs. In his book Amish Enterprise, published in 1995, author Don- ald Kraybill, a specialist in Amish life and a Johns Hopkins Univer- sity academic, said the Amish challenge a lot of conventional assumptions about what it takes to enter business. They don't have high school edu- cations; they don't have specialized training; they don't use computers; they don't use electricity or automobiles; they don't have training in how to create a marketing plan. But the resources they transfer over from the farm are: an en- trepreneurial spirit; a willingness to take risks; innovative- ness; a strong work ethic; a cheap family labor pool; and high standards of craftsmanship.

They farm so well and so profitably without using chemical fertilizers or pesticides, without tractors and other complex machinery, that Canada, Russia, France, Mexico and Uruguay have hired them to help raise agricul- tural productivity outside the United States. In Yoder v. Wisconsin (1976), the Amish did battle with the gov- ernment of Wisconsin to preserve their way of doing things against bureaucratic assault. And although the decision looks like a com- promise in which both parties won a little, a closer look will leave no doubt of which was the real winner. Sick of Amish rejection of its schools, Wisconsin sought to com- pel Amish compliance with its secular school laws through its police power. The Amish resisted on these grounds: they said government schooling was built on the principle of the mechanical milk separa- tor. It whirled the young mind about until both the social structure of the Amish community, and the structure of private family life, were fragmented beyond repair. Schooling demanded separation of people from daily life, it divided the world into disciplines, courses, classes, grades and teachers who would remain strangers to the children in all but name. Even religion, separated from family and daily life, was just another subject for critical analysis and testing. And the constant competition was destructive, leaving a multi- tude of losers, humiliated and self-hating, a far cry from the univer- sal commitment Amish community life requires. The Amish wanted no part of these things. As a part of any compromise with Wisconsin, community leaders demanded the following: I. Schools within walking distance of home; 2. No school to be so large that pupils had to be sorted into differ- ent compartments and assigned different teachers every year; 3. The school year would be no longer than eight months; 4.

We need to honor our founding documents and founding ideas, to accept that each one of us has the right to live as he or she deems wise, and if the way chosen would mean disaster for global corporations - as the way of the Amish and the Stanleys among us surely would - then that decision must be honored still."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"4 David Sarnoff's Classroom A Letter to My Assistant Principal Dear Murray, I enjoyed our talk last Friday about the hidden machinery in School District Three, Manhattan. You surprised me with your candor. I hope we can build on that to exchange some ideas (discreetly of course), which might prove of mutual benefit. I know official peda- gogy doesn't forgive those who expose its secrets, so in light of the fact you told me you expect to work here \"forever;' in what follows I've ex- ercised some discretion in the event this falls into hostile hands. I have left my own presence intact, you'll notice. In the first place I have no intention of working here forever , and in the second place I grew up in the Monongahela Valley near Pittsburgh around the time ofWWII, and I was taught by that Scots- Irish place (even in its schools), to wel- come a fight with rotters, scoundrels and low-lives, all which labels fit our mutual employers. Recently I walked through the Harvard campus in Cambridge, just for the fun of it, and on that ramble I spotted a brochure pinned to a bulletin board in one of the buildings, containing advice for stu- dents planning a career in the new international economy which it predicted was at hand. First , the brochure gave warning that ac- ademic class work and professional credentials would count for less in the future, and a track record of accomplishment which suggested 71"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"72 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION competency would count for more. This seemed a way to put a bell around the neck of grade point averages and test rankings, fingering them for the frauds they are, albeit in the time-honored elliptical man- ner of charlatans everywhere. That caught my interest, so I read on. The brochure identified nine qualities its author felt were essential for successful adaptation to the evolving world of work, so I'm asking you, Murray, to temporarily put aside your customary apologia for District Three's shameless schools and let me know how many of the nine you can honestly say are the priorities of the wealthy school dis- trict we work for on the Upper Westside of Manhattan: I. The ability to ask hard questions of data, whether from text- books, authorities, or other \"expert\" sources. In other words, do we teach dialectics? 2. The ability to define problems independently, to avoid slavish de- pendence on official definitions. 3. The ability to scan masses of irrelevant information and to quickly extract from the sludge whatever is useful. 4. The apility to conceptualize. 5. The ability to reorganize information into new patterns which enable a different perspective than the customary. 6. The possession of a mind fluent in moving among different modes of thought: deductive, inductive, heuristic, intuitive, et al. 7. Facility in collaboration with a partner, or in teams. 8. Skill in the discussion of issues, problems or techniques. 9. Skill in rhetoric. Convincing others your course is correct. Now, from where I sit, and I've been sitting in District Three for nearly three decades, we don't teach any of these as a matter of policy. And for good reason. Students so trained would destroy the structure of familiar schooling and all the comfortable hierarchies some of us depend on. Just think for a second about the transmission of competencies. Our school population is drawn largely from families of the working poor, but we've abandoned shop and cooking programs, interscholas-"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"David Sarnoff's Classroom 73 tic athletics, school socials, art and music. Not only can't our kids read, write, or count very well; now they can't drive a nail, plane a board, use a saw, turn a screwdriver, boil an egg, or find ways to amuse themselves and stay healthy. In a few classrooms, very few, teachers know how to train the young in powers; but actually doing this has to be accom- plished as a kind of sabotage because it would never be authorized by authority. Every deviation from standardized protocol has to be signed off on multiple times, making it almost impossible to teach correctly, to adapt to particular people, conditions, and opportunities. Now, for contrast, think of David Sarnoff's school- the streets. Sarnoff, as head of RCA, has been a major power in the twentieth century, yet his early years were spent in a shtetl in Russia without schooling. Promptly upon arrival in New York City with his fam- ily, his father dropped dead - leaving David at age nine to be family breadwinner. In five short months he could read English well enough to read the daily newspapers, and to speak it well enough to earn the family living as a newsboy - half a cent for every paper sold. Was it English classes in school that inspired such facility, do you think? Five months to operational fluency. No school. What do you make of that, Murray? At fourteen Sarnoff had his own newsstand. Without time for a high school diploma, little David read the daily papers as his texts. One day he saw an ad for an office boy at Marconi Wireless. He hurried over to the company without an appointment, barged into the office of the president unannounced, and asked for the job. Five hundred boys in line to be interviewed, but it was David who was hired on the spot. There's a lesson there, Murray. I wish our school could teach it. Waiting your turn is often the worst way to get what you want. After a year as an office boy, Sarnoff taught himself telegraphy just as Andy Carnegie had done in Pittsburgh at an even younger age. When Marconi Wireless was swallowed up by the Radio Cor- poration of America, he was on the cutting edge of the technology it needed, thanks to self teaching. Twenty three years later, age 39, he was president of the company."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"74 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION How could that happen without money, family connections, a high school diploma, or a (gasp!) college degree?! Sounds like a soap opera or an Alger story. Murray, don't dare say \"those were simpler times\" like a parrot repeating something it heard; those were far more complicated times than this barren epoch we enjoy, stripped of hu- man meaning by the corporatizing of everything. At age nine, Sar- noff self-taught himself into a job; at 14 into a business; at 39, into the presidency of a powerful, tech-driven corporation. He was able to move so rapidly also because he got a chance to think about serious matters before his eighth birthday, to live a signif- icant life before he was ten. He got a chance to add value to his family and community before he was 15, and a chance to follow his own in- stincts and ambitions ever after. What school do you know these days that would allow that? If we followed the same path, school would cease to be the jobs-project it really is. You can't self-teach without inner strength and a measure of gravity, without opportunities to be alone, to have broad experience with people and great challenges. Most of us who presume to judge schools are fooled by rituals of disciplined behavior, pretty hall dis- plays, and test scores. If we knew what to look for, we'd be horrified and angry at the empty destinies this waste of precious time arranges for us. The Mask of School Reform I was recently a visitor to a famous alternative public school in East Harlem which received truckloads of compliments over the past few years. It was founded and run by a famous woman, Debbie Meier, a lady with a reputation for plain talk and straight shooting. I had known Mrs. Meier very slightly for about a decade before I saw her school, and I have no hesitation saying she deserved all the nice things said about her: she was smart as a whip, tough as nails, and generous to a fault. But looking at the school from inside for a few hours it was im- possible not to see how far it fell short of standards of excellence"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"David Sarnoff's Classroom 75 which aren't very hard to achieve - and which once were common to schools in the steel-working Monongahela Valley where I grew up. Right near the surface I could see this famous East Harlem school was seriously hobbled by familiar constraints, many self-imposed by habit, by custom, by lack of imagination, and by the school dis- trict, too, I would imagine. The famous negative litany: You can't do this; you can't do that; time to move to something different; you bet- ter take the upcoming test seriously, etc., was alive and well at the fa- mous school. My guess is none of this was Debbie's doing, but realistically she had to function inside a mature bureaucracy, one very conscious just how far deviation could be allowed before top management would be called on the carpet and punished. The most suffocating of the constraints are generated from tra- ditional Calvinistic roots: Mistrust of children, mistrust of teachers, a reluctance to face that adolescence is a junk word, fear of looking bad, fear of scoring poorly on standardized tests, and suppression of imagination - voluntary suppression - which the collective teach- ing staff imposes on those of its colleagues who haven't yet lost their talent. For weeks after that visit I felt awful. Debbie's school was clearly a better place for kids than the schools of District Three, and yet David Sarnoff wouldn't have wasted his time there, nor would the place have had anything real to offer Mr. Sarnoff. What hit me hardest was the community service program at Central Park East - community ser- vice was a requirement of attendance, and one I used extensively in my own teaching practice. It had produced stunning benefits in all areas of curriculum for me, I was a believer. And yet at this famous school - enrolling students older than David Farragut was when he took over command of a warship; older than Washington was when he learned trigonometry, surveying, naval architecture and military science - at this famous school students were assigned to community service for two hours a week. Two hours a week. Who in their right mind would want a teenager to drop in for"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION two hours a week, with all the bookkeeping, training, oversight, and hassle that would require? It was a way of fatally trivializing the ser- vice ideal, turning it into superficial drudgery for all concerned. The Commissioner's Report Once a principal in the richest secondary school in District Three - you'll know the one I mean, Murray - asked me privately if I could help him set up a program to teach critical thinking. Of course, I re- plied, but if w~ do it right your school will become unmanageable. Why would kids taught to think critically and express themselves ef- fectively put up with the nonsense you force down their throats? That was the end of our interview and his critical thinking project. Murray, you're the only individual who ever willingly spoke to me about the apparatus of pedagogy, in all 26 years I've been in the busi- ness. The only one. In the thousands of hours I've spent in teachers' rooms and teachers' meetings, not a single soul besides yourself was open to discussing anything profound about our notions of pedagogy, nothing that could get them in trouble. Surely that intellectual vac- uum says something terrible about the business which has swallowed your life and my own. My compliment is bait on the hook of my next question: At the end of 1988, our rich district was ranked statistically last by the State Commissioner of Education in a dull publication which looked like a telephone directory. You had to massage the numbers a long time to actually figure out what it was saying, but when I did, it seemed to be saying that we were the worst school district in New York State, 736th of 736, in certain key categories. But our section of the city is world famous, isn't it? We have great universities, famous research in- stitutions, museums, centers for art, the best transportation system around ... what gives? You know what contempt I have for the instruments used to rank the student body, but in this one case I'm going to be inconsistent and cite them as a measure of school district failure. In third-grade math and reading, we rank dead last. We are only nine places off the bottom"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"David Sarnoff's Classroom 77 in fifth-grade writing, sixth-grade reading, math and social studies- and in seventh-grade honor math and honor biology. Listen, friend; we can't be last or nearly last out of 736 school ju- risdictions in so many metrics without being abysmal, not just bad. Last isn't an easy degree of failure to achieve; being last is a creative act. The Sarnoff family should thank its lucky stars District Three didn't get its hooks into David. This is the business you want to stay in \"forever\"? It boggles the mind. You ought to feel ashamed to take money for wasting the lives of these trapped children. I've gone to many school board meetings looking, like Diogenes, for one honest board member or administrator, one person who looked to be wor- ried. But all I ever heard were waves of self-congratulation and a smug indifference to the suffering we were causing. According to the Commissioner's Report, the average teacher in our schools has been there sixteen years, a sign of stability; yet the teacher turnover is an incredible 22% a year, almost the highest in New York State! What could account for such an anomaly? In some busi- nesses turnover like that would cause a management shakeup. It dam- ages morale; it causes a school to lose its memory. And yet ... and yet, we have all those teachers who stay, too! Why? Let me tell you why. A caste system has been created by school administrators, in com- bination with the teachers union. Certain teachers in each of our schools have been rewarded with good programs, good rooms, good kids in exchange for their loyalty and cooperation. The power to con- fer these privileges will be fatally enhanced if we ever get so-called \"merit\" pay (who would decide \"merit\" except feather-bedding admin- istrators?). These favors are rewards for those who play ball, these privileges are bought by exploiting unfortunate fellow teachers, of- ten the newest teachers who are dumped upon with impossible work- loads, and quickly leave the business. The situation I'm describing is universal and constitutes the poi- son pill in merit proposals. Merit would certainly NOT go to the meritorious - as a student, parent or citizen would define merit - but as a school administrator would. When 22% of the teachers don't"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION survive more than a year, the caste system that corrupts our schools is partially to blame. Nobody ever bothers to ask the 100 to 150 teach- ers who leave each year why they left. That's because everyone already knows. The Shadow Economy of Schools Teachers with deals don't constitute the entirety of non-laboring labor in schools, there's been such an inflation of management, both visible and invisible, as to defy imagination. For instance, what do you make of this: the student/teacher ratio in our school district is listed in state accounts as 15:1, but everywhere the number of kids in a class is 30 or more: Half of all teaching energy has been siphoned away into administrative tasks in the shadow economy of front-office politics. No healthy enterprise can afford this degree of deceit. It's the teach- ers who don't get paid off with these non-teaching deals you should be worrying about. They become bitter and cynical. They find ways to get even, ways to cut back on their own production. You admin- istrators have created a catastrophe by paying off your favorites with deals. I can't escape the conclusion that we both are involved in a social engineering project whose mission is to weaken children's minds and give them bad characters - all concealed in the sanctimony we exude on parents' night. I heard one principal (a decent man in his own esti- mation, I'm sure), tell a large audience that the damage to these chil- dren had already been done before they came to him in seventh grade, and that his job was to relieve their pain and make them feel good in the here and now because their limited futures were already predeter- mined. Can you believe it?! The shameless brass! I couldn 't make that up. Isn't it the function of morphine or crack cocaine to stupefy pain? Given a choice between those substances and school as an anodyne, you'd have to be deranged to choose school. Two district policies in particular have destroyed the capac- ity for sustained thought among our kids. The first was the political"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"David Sarnoff's Classroom 79 decision, cooked up at the Ford Foundation, as I recall, not to con- trol outrageous classroom behavior on the grounds that frustration causes perpetrators to have low self-esteem. While this policy was being imposed (and afterwards), the rhetoric of decent behavior was maintained, as if nothing out of the ordinary were going on. Tell me how that was any different from Big Brother announcing the choco- late ration was being raised, while it was being lowered? The degree of disrespect our nation has assigned its ordinary population wouldn't be possible unless somewhere in the command centers it hadn't been decided that common men and women should be stripped of any power to rebel. And that they could be lied to without compunction, because their dignity didn't count. Or their lives. As these conditions for chaos were being imposed, a form of tri- age was constructed wherein a few of the \"best\" classes (on the liberal West Side, that means mostly white classes) were to be held to a tra- ditional standard. As fo~ the others, the mass of fairly well-behaved kids, was mixed with an infusion of violent, restless, disruptive stu- dents until only a primitive level of instruction was possible. In order to free school administrators from the tiresome function of helping to maintain order for the lumpen proletariat , classroom disruption was now deemed, system-wide, a problem of bad teaching. In other words, if you complained, or asked for help, you were treated with contempt and your job was in jeopardy. Mirabile dictu! The burden of discipline vanished as an administrative responsibility. And because reasonably patient children become angry at a teacher's ineffectiveness in main- taining order, many of the polite kids joined the disruptors, too. Does that surprise you, Murray? The cause and effect linkage, I mean. Another destructive policy decision was the project to recruit dis- ruptive children from other school districts, to conceal the shrinking enrollment in District Three - a student population decline caused by the evil reputation District Three acquired from its first policy! In 1984, after we fell to the lowest student enrollement of any dis- trict in New York City (10,000), 3,000 half-crazed children were re- cruited. It was like dumping the flotsam and jetsam of Cuban prisons"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"80 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION on the United States in the boatlift days. This radical decision was taken without any consultation with parents at all, or with teachers who would be expected to manage these wild children. Incorporating them into hitherto calm classes, all hell broke loose, of course. How could it have been avoided? Principals began to lock their office doors. In short order, District Three plunged to the bottom of city statistical rankings. Then, to the bottom of the entire state! What a movie that would have made. In 28 years of teaching, I've never seen an administrator attempt to raise the standard of what we expect from children, or what we ex- pect from ourselves. We drown, however, in the rhetoric of high expectations which only thosewho wear tinfoil hats could take seri- ously. Changing superintendents makes no difference to the quality of schooling: some are fatter, some shriller, some black, some white, some Hispanic, some older or younger - but all dance to the same weird flute music from above. For decades I've watched a dreary pa- rade of men and women make fine promises from the superinten- dent's office and everyone eventually made some false move that angered their handlers and they were gone. In all that time only one superintendent, a man who won his job thanks to a deal with my wife (the swing vote on the School Board at that time), in which he agreed to assert independence from the ca- bal of influence peddlers and others who ran the district. Inside of a single year teacher morale soared - along with measures of ac- complishment - and the district soared from the bottom of the city rankings to the mediocre center. It was too much to bear. The fellow was fired for his cheek toward his betters, fired at a public meeting attended by all local politicians and political club leaders where he was denounced from the podium by a legendary West Side politician known to the media as \"the con- science of the city council:' You see, Murray, too much was at stake - not just money, but careers, patronage and ideological status - to"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"David Sarnoff's Classroom 81 allow any changes which would actually occur. It's the invisible stake- holders in schooling who would have to approve changes, and only in a fairy tale (or special temporary circumstances), can that happen. This doesn't mean the villains of my narrative are bad people; many are quite decent and intelligent, like you, Murray. It means that the mission of ambition and survival trumps a commitment to excellence every time. It's an ancient problem. Gym teachers and math teachers become principals and administrators because they have the least work to do in a school day, the least stress, and they pay the least emotional toll in doing it. They have time to feather their nests. Climbing the pyramid, they surround themselves with loyal friends as buffers, always careful to include representatives of any special interest that might upset the cozy arrangements. School as Narcotic What have we done, Murray? Filling blackboards and workbooks, running videos, cramming heads with disconnected information we have driven even the idea of quality from the field. And by constantly bathing the young in passivity, showering them with petty orders and bells for their own good, we have created a foundry where incomplete men and women are forged. Our school products emerge with only shaky grasp of the past, with a void where comprehension should be; they have no capacity to visualize the future. Every single secondary school student in New York City is taught that North and South Vietnam are one country, divided, and all their teachers believe that, too. But the truth is that for thousands of years they were three countries - and only forced to- gether for a short time under French domination. The civilization of the two northern countries, Annam and Tonkin, derives largely from China; the culture of South Vietnam, a country know as Champa, comes - like that of Cambodia - from India. The two regions have been fighting for nearly two thousand years.

Why don't you know this, Murray? Your license says you are a \"history teacher;' but what you teach is propaganda. Nightmare children are all about us, diseased by our indiffer- ence; some have capacity to heal themselves, most don't. These are nightmare children, I say; no vital interests, creatures trained to or- ganize their time around spasms of excitement and amusement, or escape from punishment. The maps of the road ahead they carry are false. The most curious commentary on these kids is the thousands of hours they spend in not exploring, not playing, not seeking opportu- nities for personal gain - but in watching other people on television,in music videos and computer games. Sane children would never do this - the arc of anyone's life is too short to accept passivity and fantasy to this degree. Conjure with these numbers: in families where the husband and wife have never been divorced, and where the wife doesn't work, the index of specta- torship - TV and otherwise - drops to one-tenth the big-city av- erage. The institution you and I work for creates addiction. It addicts children to prefer thin abstraction and dull fantasies to reality. As I've grown older I've come to believe that good teachers are more danger- ous than bad ones. They keep this sick institution alive. Old friend, I'm done.

The essay, in its entirety, read: Government schooling is the most radical adventure in his- tory. It kills the family by monopolizing the best times of childhood and by teaching disrespect for home and parents. The whole blueprint of school procedure is Egyptian, not Greek or Roman. It grows from the theological idea that hu- man value is a scarce thing, represented symbolically by the narrow peak of a pyramid. That idea passed into American history through the Pu- ritans. It found it's \"scientific\" presentation in the bell curve, along which talent supposedly apportions itself by some iron law of biology. It's a religious notion, and school is its church. I offer rituals to keep heresy at bay. I provide documentation to justify the heavenly pyramid. Socrates foresaw that if teaching became a formal pro- fession, something like this would happen. Professional in- terest is served by making what is easy to do seem hard; by subordinating the laity to the priesthood.

In thirty years of teaching kids, rich and poor, I almost never met a learning-disabled child; hardly ever met a gifred- and-talented one, either. Like all school categories, these are sacred myths created by human imagination. They de- rive from questionable values that we never examine because they preserve the temple of schooling. That's the secret behind short-answer tests, bells, uni- form time blocks, age grading, standardization, and all the rest of the school religion punishing our nation. There isn't a right way to become educated; there are as many ways as there are fingerprints. We don't need state-certified teachers to make education happen - certification probably guaran- tees it won't. How much more evidence is necessary? Good schools don't need more money or a longer year; they need real free- market choices, variety that speaks to every need and runs risks. We don't need a national curriculum or national test- ing either. Both initiatives arise from ignorance of how people learn or deliberate indifference to it. I can't teach this way any longer.

All are present in the equation; it's just that none of them matters very much - even with- out them, school would move in the same direction. Ordinary people send their children to school to get smart; but what modern schooling teaches is dumbness. Old-fashioned dumb- ness used to be simple ignorance. Now it's been transformed into permanent mathematical categories of relative stupidity, such as \"gifted and talented;' \"mainstream;' and \"special ed\" - categories in which learning is rationed for the good of the system and the so- cial order. Dumb people are no longer merely ignorant. Now they are dangerous imbeciles whose minds must be conditioned with sub- stantial doses of commercially prepared disinformation for tranquil- izing purposes. The new dumbness is particularly deadly to middle- and upper- middle-class kids already made shallow by the pressures to conform imposed by the world on their often lightly rooted parents. When these kids come of age, they feel certain they must know something, because their degrees and licenses say they do. They remain convinced of this until an unexpectedly brutal divorce, a corporate downsizing, or panic attacks brought on by meaninglessness manage to upset the precarious balance of their incomplete adult lives.

Although none of his crimes would have earned him more than a good spanking a hundred years earlier, now they helped support a social-service empire. At the time of this incident, Hector attended one of the lowest- rated public schools in New York State, part of a select group threat- ened with takeover by state overseers. Of the thirteen classes in Hector's grade, a full nine were of higher rank than the one he was in. Hector was an exhausted salmon swimming upstream in a rag- ing current that threatened to sweep away his dignity. We had delib- erately unleashed the flood by assigning about eleven hundred kids to five strict categories: \"gifted and talented honors;\" \"gifted and tal- ented;\" \"special progress;\" \"mainstream;\" and \"special ed:' (These last kids had a cash value to the school three times higher than that of the others, providing a genuine incentive to find fatal defects where none existed.) Hector belonged to the doomed category called \"mainstream;' it- self further divided into subcategories labeled A, B, C and O. Worst of the worst, above special ed, was mainstream O. This was where Hec- tor reported. Since special ed was a life sentence of ostracism and hu- miliation at the hands of one's peers, we might even call Hector lucky to be in mainstream, though as mainstream 0, he was suspended in that thin layer of mercy just above the truly doomed. Hector's stan- dardized-test scores placed him about three years behind the middle of the pack. He wasn't just behind the eight ballj he was six feet un- der it.

As a schoolteacher I found that the kids who drove me crazy were always big TV watchers. Their behav- ioral profile wasn't pretty. TV addicted kids were irresponsible, child- ish, dishonest, malicious to one another; above all else they seemed to lack any sustaining purpose of their own, as if by consuming too many made-up stories, modeling themselves after too many men and women who were pretending to be somebody else, listening to too many talking hamburgers and too many explanations of the way things are (sponsored by oil companies and dairy councils) they had lost the power to behave with integrity - to grow up. It was almost as if by stealing time children needed to write their own stories, television - like school itself - had dwarfed their spir- its. When computers came along, I saw they often made the problem worse. Potentially, they were a better deal, because of the capacity to offer interactivity, but a majority of users I saw wallowed in porno, games spent playing against programs, not other people, and many spectator pursuits which required only consumption, not actively- committed behavior. 91"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"92 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION Even with the Internet I saw how easy it was to cross the line into a passive state unless good discipline was exercised, and I knew from experience how hard that was to come by. Casting about for a working hypothesis with which to fashion an- tidotes to the damage, I quickly abandoned preaching as a solution. Whatever could be said against TV; games, the Internet, and all the rest, had been said to these kids so many times their minds refused to hear the words anymore. Relief would have to come from a dif- ferent quarter; if these things were truly bad as I believed, if they di- minished the intellect and corrupted the character as I felt, a solution would have to be found in the natural proclivity of the young to move around physically, not sit, before we suppress that urge with confine- ment to seats in school and with commercial blandishments to watch performers rather than to perform oneself The master mechanism at work to cause harm was a suppression of natural feedback circuits which allow us to learn from our mis- takes. Somebody trying to learn to sail alone in a small boat will in- evitably tack too far lefr and too far right when sailing into a wind, when the destination is straight ahead, but practice will correct that beginner's error because feedback will instruct the sailor's reaction and judgement.

Think of school management, compelled by law to follow rules made long ago and far away - as if human situations are so formulaic they can be codified.

My guess was that by restoring this natural biological circuitry, the hideous displays of media-sickened behavior among my students would decline. And the guess proved right. Now you have the information you need to understand what made my Guerrilla Curriculum different from garden-variety \"al- ternative\" approaches - its target was inactivity (and even activity which didn't significantly call feedback into play). Sufficient activity, all by itself and aimed in any direction, would cause the kids to vol- untarily cut back on time spend staring at lighted boxes. My strong hunch was that the childish expressions of children had little to do with the content of media programming, and everything to do with a fatal calculus in which real experience is subtracted from young lives, and simulated experience added in its place. I set out to shock my students into discovering that face to face engagement with reality was more interesting and rewarding than watching the pre-packaged world of media screens, my target was helping them jettison the lives of spectators which had been assigned to them, so they could become players. I couldn't tell anyone in the school universe what I was doing, but I made strenuous efforts to en- list parents as active participants. Just as Shen Wentong broke many laws to bring the Phoenix steel plant to Shanghai three times faster than German engineers thought it could be done, I broke many to put this Guerrilla Curriculum into effect. From the first it delivered heartening results. Plunging kids into the nerve-wracking, but exhilarating waters of real life - sending them on expeditions across the state, open- ing the court systems to their lawsuits, and the economy to their businesses, filling public forums with their speeches and political action - made them realize, without lectures, how much of their time was customarily wasted sitting in the dark.

Every year thousands of well educated, often accomplished people from allover the world, walk hundreds of miles along the way to the burial place of the Apostle James in Santiago de Compostela, a city in northwestern Spain. The custom began long ago, but in the modern era it has increasingly been adopted by people not religious in the usual sense, modern people estranged by the pres- sures of contemporary life. They make the pilgrimage to build a new relationship with themselves, to feel self-reliant, to be close to nature, to enjoy history and culture and give them time to reflect on things. My assumption was that if TV and computers had estranged my kids from themselves, their families, and nature, perhaps a similar pil- grimage could help them find a way to come back. Acting in conspir- acy with parents who were as desperate as I was, I sent my 13-year-old students to journey alone on foot through the five boroughs of New York City. Some walked the circumference of Manhattan, a distance of about 30 miles; others walked through different neighborhoods, comparing them, constructing profiles of the people and businesses in each from the clues · of dress, speech, architecture, window displays - integrating these first-hand observations with interviews and li- brary research (much of which can be Googled today).

A Visitor's Key to Iceland Because my son-in-law was an Icelander, I was motivated to learn as much about that remote culture as I could. And in the act of doing private research I came upon another rich source of inspiration for the curriculum I was making up as I went along. Iceland has a weird and wonderful guidebook which someone lent me a copy of, A Visi- tor's Key to Iceland. This unique book follows every road in that coun- try, step by step, bringing the land itself and all its built environment fully alive: two chests of silver are believed hidden in this hill. Here a collapsing bridge allowed a murderer to escape - and proved his in- nocence! In this hot spring a famous outlaw boiled his meat. Over there is a farm whose occupants refused a pregnant woman shelter - they were buried alive by a landslide that same night. Here is history at its best, animating everything, bringing the ab- stract lines on a map or the words in a history book to vivid life. With that model as my example, my kids produced visitor's keys to the saf- est spots in Manhattan to hide out while playing hooky, to the great pizza parlors of Manhattan (and the rotten ones, too), to the archi- tecture of brownstone apartment buildings in a ten block radius of the school, to the neighborhood swimming pools of the five boroughs (few and far between, but enough for a wonderful comparative guide, complete with sociological analyses of their cultural contexts and cli- entele). Many experiments involved extracting the hidden knowledge and points of view of old men and women, those confined to homes, and those who spent their time sitting on the benches in Riverside or Central Park.

The biggest surprise for me was how easy this was to accomplish, it took neither talent nor money; anyone could duplicate my results. I won't deny its hard work to try to pull off the trick with 130 kids a year, but a lot of effort is wasted in finding ways to circumvent the dead hand of school administration. In a system more congenial to learning (and less to social control) the thrill of doing the labor would more than outweigh the effort required. And, of course, if everyone in the society were on the same page about the necessity of developing intellect and character in the young (not weighting them down with chains), the work would be ... child's play. Over the years my students launched so many useful projects and earned so many plaudits and prizes that I found myself showered with awards from the school establishment which had no idea how I got such results. When I tried to explain to the awards committees how little I had to do with the achievements, I suspect it was discounted as obligatory modesty, but these days when I have nothing more to prove to myself about who I am, I sincerely hope you'll believe me.

Since the advent of schoolrooms and electronic screens, many of us never grow up. Too much of our precious trial and error period is wasted sitting in the dark. Being a mature being means living with a purpose, your own purpose: it's about welcoming responsibility as the nourishment a big life needs; it's about behaving as a good citi- zen - finding ways to add value to the community in which you live; it's about wrestling with your weaknesses and developing heart, mind, and spirit - none of them properties of the spectator crowd. Hitching the body and mind to screens reduces the attention span to quick takes arranged by strangers; it creates a craving for constant stimulation which reality can't satisfy. Violence of one sort or another is the easiest way to still the gnawing hunger for stimulation that the undead feel. And that violence includes the violence of bizarre sex - the most important psychological product vended on the Internet.

School As A Weapon Most historical accounts of schooling are so negative you have to won- der how this exercise of pedagogy ever passed the test of time with its original parts nearly unchanged. It must yield some benefits, but what those are and for whom isn't so clear. It seems obvious that school weakens family and indeed all rela- tionships, but perhaps some valuable trade-off occurs which, on bal- ance, rewards people so radically disconnected from one another and from themselves. School elevates winning so far above its ostensible goal of learning that periodically public scandals occur when inves- tigation reveals that even elite students know very little. A century of lending our children to perfect strangers from an early age - to be instructed in what we aren't quite sure - has made an important statement about modern culture which deserves to be mused upon. One famous ode of Horace contemplates the torments of school- ing. Mosaics at Pompeii illustrate painful episodes of school disci- pline. Washington Irving's story of the headless horseman celebrates turning the tables big-time on an insufferable schoolmaster. The im- mortal WWI era song, \"Schooldays, schooldays, dear old golden rule days;' describes with affection a relationship between school learning and the \"tune of the hickory stick:' A recent Hollywood film, Teaching Miss Tingle, is about a schoolteacher kidnapped by her students who torture her physically and psychologically.

On the other side, we rarely hear anyone attributing their success to school time. The notion of school as a dangerous place is well established then, even if the troubling metaphor of weaponry deliberately brought to bear to cause student harm isn't yet widespread. That school can and does inflict damage is no longer surprising although precisely how that happens is only impressionistically understood. And \"why\" not at all. This chapter will seek to nail down some specific aspects of the punitive machinery. It won't be comprehensive - you will have weap- ons of your own to add - nor will I try to rank the ones I give you in any formal order of importance, much of that will depend upon the nature of your own kids, but I feel compelled to plant this flag firmly while I have time left - school is not a good place for your kids. If they are swarmed by friends and win every award the place can of- fer it changes nothing. From the first month of my teaching career of 30 years, I realized that intellectual power, creative insight, and good character was being diminished in my classroom and that indeed I had been hired for precisely that purpose. I was a clerk in a vast peni- tentiary; the rules and procedures were the guards. A Personal Formula In a short time I became determined to sabotage the system as Lusseyran had sabotaged the Nazi system, peacefully in most in- stances, but as time passed and my contempt deepened, by small acts of violence as well. In the course of continuous trial and error experi- mentation (behind the fa~ade of being an \"English\" teacher), I stum- bled upon a formula to change the destiny of students, one at a time, the way beached starfish have to be rescued. It required assembling a fairly accurate biography of every individual student from birth on- ward, all the key people, relationships, experiences, places, opinions, accomplishments and failures.

With a rich profile in hand a personal course could be custom- tailored for each kid, put together in partnership with the student, flexible enough to allow constant feedback to change the design, something schools could not do (nor would they if they could). When you believe in determinism - biological, psychological, soci- ological, or theological (and schools believe in all of those in various times and places), the very idea of feedback leading to growth must be held at arm's length. For all its legends of social mobility and intellec- tual growth, school operates out of a belief in social order - that all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds. Once a profile was created, the second step was to add a person- alized Wishes and Weaknesses component. I asked each student to list three things each wanted to be knowledgeable about by the end of the year - that was the wishes part - and three weaknesses he or she wished to overcome, deficiencies which led to humiliation (I get beat up all the time) or failures of opportunity (I want to do modeling work but only the rich kids know how to present themselves to get that) - that was the weaknesses part. I exercised virtually no censor- ship and whatever the individual kid's priorities were became mine. I didn't consult with a single school administrator to put this program in place, nor with any other teacher - only with parents from whom I extracted promises of silence. I know this sounds like a hideous amount of effort, and politically impossible in a large urban school, but it was neither: it required only will, imagination, resourcefulness, and a determination to scrap any rules which stood in the way - just as Shen Wenrong had done in moving Phoenix. Acting in my favor was the fact that with this new curriculum each kid was motivated, worked much harder than I le- gally could have asked him or her to do, and recruited outside assis- tance with resources no classroom teacher could match.

If you allow imagination to work on the in- stitution, it is much more a piece of utopian science fiction, oblivious to human needs, than it is a response to popular demand. Right from the early days of my teaching life, I began a project of research which involved reading and arguing with thousands of books, many dread- fully written and some quite obscure, travelling (by now) three mil- lion miles around the country and the world to observe, argue, and discuss schools and which resulted a few years ago in a monster book, still in print, called The Underground History of American Education. A major publisher paid me an enormous amount of money to write it (enormous for a schoolteacher) and then refused to publish it after holding it off the market for over a year. \"It would embarrass friends of the house;' I was told. If you wonder what that might mean, con- sider this was one of the top three textbook publishing houses too, apart from their trade division. In this way my schoolteaching practices were directed by intense research on the one hand, and equally intensive and daring field ex- ercises around the city of New York - at times up to sixty different studies in sixty different locations! Simultaneously! Either singly, in small teams, or en masse, \"Gatto's Guerrillas;' as we called ourselves, infiltrated without notice (or permission either), into public meet- ings, exhibitions, scheduled hearings, auctions, courthouses, work- places - anywhere opportunity presented itself. We took public opinion polls on every subject under the sun - often competing with professional news organizations. Travelling dramatic troupes (always more than one) gave shows in elementary schools, in acting studios, and everyplace verbal engagement was possible. The general targets were many: independence, self-reliance, strate- gic planning, a good command of the active literacies of speaking and writing, courage, curiosity, an ability to write a script for one's own life."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"104 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION A m~or goal was examining barriers schooling creates which re- strict intellectual and behavioral superiority to a relative handful of its clientele. Producing a clear inventory of school practices which act to interdict normal development - like involuntary confinement, involuntary associations, bells, bathrooms passes, continuous com- petitions complete with petty prizes, testing, and all the rest, and dis- cussing the genesis of each, proved useful in changing the way kids approached the school experience. They grew willing to assume full responsibility for educating themselves, in spite of school - rather than trusting an army of strangers to do the job for them. It was a rev- olution in outlook. Bad Intentions I had been hired as an English teacher, but since absolutely nothing was rationally proscribed under a mandate to increase facility with the English language, and since nobody paid close attention to what was happening, if my classes weren't unduly disruptive and parents didn't complain, I put an examination of the public assumptions of schooling at the heart of what I taught. Without ever actually assert- ing that school was a place of bad intentions I set out to demonstrate to students and their families that the poor results of schooling - with language proficiency, for instance - weren't inevitable, but the results of procedures enshrined in regulation and law.

Only ed- ucation (he called it \"educational schooling\") will heal the wounds to community and individuality caused by capitalism. According to the father of capitalism, the only differences between children of philosophers and those of street sweepers lies in the train- ing they receive.

The best work I did as a teacher always consisted of the same priorities: entering a personal partnership with anybody who showed a determination to become educated, then working inside that partnership to help meet spe- cific targets the student set. Those too broken to want an education, I schooled. Over time a fraction of those were inspired by the example of more enterprising classmates and wanted out of the school rou- tines , too; others were unable to recover. Those I consoled by school- ing them as elite children are schooled, by drill long and strong. Adam Smith was right.

And who is to say he is wrong as long as prosperity is reckoned in dollars and cents.\"The education of the middling and lower ranks\" has to be put aside, to be replaced with psychological conditioning in habits and attitudes of deference, envy, appetite, and mistrust of self, if the system of capital- ism is to survive with all the benefits it provides. \"A smattering of learning is a very dangerous thing;' he said, not because ordinary people are too dumb to learn; just the opposite, they are too smart to be allowed to learn. People become dangerous when too many see through the illusions which hold society together. Long ago in China, Playfair's philosophy had been given a name by the emperors in pre-history. It was called \"The Policy of Keeping People Dumb:' The only change the passage of millennia brought in this leadership perspective was in the form of a change in style - in the modern era leaders no longer spoke openly about this great secret of management.

Irrelevance Why has schooling acquired such a bad odor? Part of the answer lies in the political nature of mass schooling - a characteristic in- herent in any bureaucracy. It's not so much kids think in these ab- stract terms, it's the widespread understanding among the young that school isn't about them (and their interests, curiosities and fu- tures), but exclusively about the wishes of other people. School is built around the self-interest of others. What's the point of taking this test or that one? Is there any point at all that any young person with real priorities, real anxieties, and real questions which need to be answered would be likely to accept? How would you personally deal with the assertion, \"I don't need to know anything about the Leaning Tower of Pisa!\" What would you say? Is it possible the complaint is well founded? What of the political nature of schooling which allows any group in political control and all its important political rivals to edit out any teaching which might call its own privileges, practices, or beliefs into question? School has no choice but to limit free thought and speech to such a profound degree a gulf is opened between the sanctimo- nious homilies of pedagogy ('searching for truth; 'leveling the playing field; etc.) and the ugly reality of its practices.

Be- cause of that inescapable, ever-present reality, you might imagine gov- ernment policy toward the environment would provide compelling analytical matter for curriculum in every academic specialty, but if you thought so you would be dead wrong. One instance will show you why. For years the government there supported a project to eliminate deeply rooted grasses, replacing them with shallowly rooted British grasses which provide food for sheep in a land unsuited to sheep, but where a sheep industry is politically powerful. Sheep chew grass far down; that causes salt to rise from subsoil and concentrate in topsoil- a significant problem for farm- ers. But something just as bad or worse happens, too: huge quantities of soil blow away and contaminate rivers. Soil-laden water kills fish populations and pollutes the tidal margins where land meets ocean. All over the world this tidal margin is the great producer of fish, but in Australia, with the longest coastline on earth, the tidal zone is the least productive anywhere, in part a result of sheep farming in an en- vironment ill-matched to sheep. There's more. Tourism, not sheep, is the nation's big money-maker. Among its unique sights is the Great Barrier Reef, a vast mountain of coral harboring a rich collection of sea life. As soil in rivers which flow to the reef has increased, large sections of coral have died, losing their characteristic brilliant red hues which in death change to ugly grey. Tourism which benefits every corner of the country has been placed in jeopardy to please the sheep lobby.

Alfred North Whitehead, one of the best known mathemati- cians of the twentieth century, contended in his book, The Aims of Education, that the most essential form of advanced math apart from arithmetic in modern society is statistical prediction.

The math required to hold this power in one's hands is hardly taxing for people of junior high school age. For ordinary lives, nothing in the world of number beyond arithmetic is remotely as useful; if statistics were the mathematical idea taught, past long division, most students would become more effective for the simple ability to predict with numbers.

These vehicles enable people without any particular status, to hook up with one another; they even allow mixtures of nobodies and somebodies to exchange ideas and plans; they provide a fountain of information which replenishes itself constantly; they encourage cre- ativity among masses consigned by schooling to become reliable con- sumers.

The letter which follows represents my attempt to introduce Bruno to one of the best- concealed weapons of mass instruction: lying by omission: Dear Bruno, You ask my opinion on Darwin's supposition vs. Wallace's, Darwin contending that biological advance occurs through deadly competitions which over time eliminate the weak from success in reproduction, and Wallace arguing that ad- aptation and cooperation are the important elements. , I would have no opinion on the relative merits of either, but my guess is that what really interests you is how Darwin became the figure historically remembered and Wallace the one forgotten. On that issue I know a great deal. The politics of science is a matter which hardly ever takes center stage in academic presentations intended for or- dinary students, but since Darwin's ascendency was almost exclusively a matter of who he was and who he knew, while Wallace's decline could have been predicted long before it oc- curred by knowing his background, let me engage your ques- tion through that particular aspect of big science, since it is always present and almost always a matter of the greatest im- portance. Two excellent critical takes on this which you might want to read are Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and Robert Scott Root-Bernsteins's Discovering. Back to the Darwin victory. I'm certain you were never told in school that Darwin was supremely wealthy and hung around with the circle around the powerful and influential in many countries. And I'm equally certain you don't know that he was trained as a Church of England priest, not as a scien- tist. In a short while I'll get to the significance of this data, but for the moment you should reflect on the possible reason your teachers would have in keeping this information from you."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Weapons of Mass Instruction Your school and colleges will also have kept from you that Wallace was from a lowly background; all his best sym- pa,thies were with people who worked hard for subsistence wages. Those sympathies might have been dismissed as an eccentricity in a fine scientist except that he carried his con- victions into the political arena - enraging the very social classes in which Darwin enjoyed membership. For example, he was prominent in the land reform movement which asked that ownership be turned over to the tiller. He disdained the British scientific establishment as more a private club for rich dilettantes like Darwin than a workshop for science. Is it far-fetched to think some of this biographical record - in both cases - might have made a difference in their respective receptions? Push this a bit further. Free trade was a passionate is- sue in the 19th century among so-called champions of the liberal persuasion. But Wallace wrote passionately against free trade, claiming it inflicted hideous hardships on work- ing people. He advocated female suffrage when that idea was anathema to the elites. He was the Ralph Nader of his day - and yet he was totally dependent on the classes he criti- cized for a fair hearing among his judges. All this is vital to a clear consideration of your original question, yet an invisible committee charged with helping you gain education saw fit to move these interesting narra- tives out of your reach. Some flesh and blood individuals had to make this decision on several levels of your school- ing. What I haven't gotten to yet is how seditious Wallace's theory really was to the controlling interests of the British Empire, versus Darwin's which fit squarely on top of the gov- ernment's plans and justified them.

Darwin's explanation, on the other hand, that con- tinuous competition of a life and death variety was nature's way, put the voice of Science squarely in the camp of impe- rialism, globalism, racism, colonialism, free trade economics, and much else of moment to the powerful in 19th century Britain. But if life were found to be inherently better where cooperation rules, as Wallace said, the privileged world would turn upside down. By Darwin's day, among the powerful, Christianity had become merely ceremonial, a dangerous relic of the past to be kept under State control as it was in the Anglican order. But Wallace, although not arguing his case from any theo- logical perspective, still marshaled his theory in a way which led to the age-old Christian conclusion: we are our brother's keeper; patience, not violent action, is the wisest course in the face of the inevitable. The revolutionary ability of the Christian message to stir up the masses and put them maddeningly out of reach of carrot/stick control machinery was regarded with horror by the British upper classes. When people build the meaning of their days out of relationships, love, piety, loyalty, and fru- gal self-sufficiency, the notion of happiness through an accu- mulation of stuff suffers. But what were the ramifications of that for a commercial civilization? On the other hand, when competition is seen as essential to a good life, when winning against one's neighbors is put at the heart of society, business thrives. To win, others have to lose: the more losers, the bet- ter winning feels.

Apologists today will protest that the damage has been caused by \"Social Darwin- ists\" who hammered his ideas into practical directives for the management of society, but don't let them fool you.

I hope this sheds some light on Wallace's eclipse. His public attacks on military spending alone would have been enough to doom him to obscurity. I'm surprised he gets the footnote in scientific history he does, but I expect that will vanish, too, at some not too distant moment in the future.

What has changed in the intervening century? Have ordinary people become more dangerous, or have governments demanded ex- clusive ownership of things which might unseat them? Carroll Quig- ley, professor of international relations at Georgetown and former personal tutor of president Clinton's when Clinton attended that school, wrote in Tragedy and Hope: A History of the World in Our Time that the rights of ordinary people thrive at those times when common citizens are well armed against the incursions of their own government - and that liberty declines precipitously when arms are denied the commonality. Adolf Hitler's first act in office was to ban possession of firearms among citizens.

You can't win liberty by memorizing what you're told to memorize. \"Nullius in verba\" is the motto of the Royal Scientific Society, founded in 1620, which I translate as \"Don't take anybody's word for the truth; think for yourself!\" The watchword of school is \"Let others think for you:' The Decisive Ratio The new revolution made possible by factory schooling returned citi- zenship in libertarian America to a deadly ratio which once existed in classical Greece, Tudor England, and Prussia of the Fredericks - a large number of puppets, a small group of puppet masters.

One great secret which you always suspected I'll confirm for you right now: the physical appearance of human bodies is an important sorting device at elite universities - if you're ugly, ungainly, unath- letic, ungraceful, your chances of admission at Yale or Stanford drop almost to zero. Your physical appearance tells a sophisticated observer a great deal about you and whether you might be worthy to carry the institution's flag. Here is one of those hundreds of thousands of ideas which school might spend its time examining, but as with much else, it avoids treating entirely. In this case merely omitting discussion of the ideas involved doesn't do the major damage, much more direct methods are employed to tag you with the stigmata of failure which ugliness signifies. If you wanted general health and vigor in an oncoming genera- tion, would you enforce immobility on it for twelve to twenty years? Would you tie that immobility to constant stresses created by bells and various threats? Would you add to these handicaps the fat and sugar-rich diet of school lunches or allow snack wagons and soda pop vendors inside the school orbit?

The Dark World of Compulsory Schooling The minute you are willing to acknowledge how radically irrelevant school offerings actually are, the question of intent rears its disturb- ing head. Is this irrelevance an accident of incompetence? Is it pos- sible the managers of institutional schooling don't know themselves what to do, but having inherited command of a dangerously unstable vessel, must sail it somehow to a destination unknown? For an army of local superintendents and principals this is surely true - thejob is too good to abandon, its perks too rich to give up; they might like to change and adapt but the command/control structure won't allow any strong deviations from system logic. Yet even having granted professional frontline confusion, the spec- tre of some darker intent at the level of policy won't go away. School- ing in the short and intermediate run is so unmistakably beneficial to some of the orders of society who possess power to plan for the whole that the possibility of these surrendering to the temptation to use in- stitutional schooling for social engineering can't be dismissed. And once that filter is activated in your critical consciousness, evidence presents itself constantly that indeed this is so.

I realize quite well that this thesis constitutes a sweeping indictment of modern edu- cation. But I believe the indictment is justified and there is a prima facie case for entering this indictment. 125 The details, events, and dramatis personae of the project to set aside Western culture - and their motives - have been exhaustively explored by a major scholar from Georgetown University, Dr. Carroll Quigley, in a phenomenal work of syntheses published in I966, enti- tled Tragedy and Hope: A History of the World in Our Time. Tragedy and Hope ~as so profoundly eye-opening a treatise that its New York publisher destroyed the plates after the first printing and when that small edition (2000 copies) was gone, declined to re- print it, although thousands of backorders were at hand. Dr. Quigley was deceived with the story his book had met with public indiffer- ence. Since that moment, tens of thousands of bootleg copies have issued from wildcat presses, so a Google search will put a copy in your hands. One caution: some of the most recent printings may have been altered to omit certain key passages.

You needn't fear falling into the hands of some reckless conspiracy nut whose eyes glow in the dark. Do the work, I promise you'll never see our schools or our world the same way again. Scientific Management? (No! No! No!) The first goal of Scientific Management - the high level cult created by efficiency engineer Frederick Taylor and formalized in his book Prin- ciples of Scientific Management (I9II), which became the driving force in American business, government, schooling, religion, social work, and much else - is perfect subordination. The concept of hierarchy is es- pecially important in bureaucracies where the notion of productivity is always amorphous - there everything is secondary to subordination. Better the ship should be blown to pieces than allow a common sailor to give the orders because he knows more than the captain. Subordination is a religious principle, like transubstantiation; it involves a ladder system of functional boxes into which employees are confined; as long as they remain as placed, surrendering volition, they become predictable: interdependent human resources to be utilized as needed by management. Educated people, or people with principles, represent rogue el- ements in a scheme of scientific management; the former suspect because they have been trained to argue effectively and to think for themselves, the latter too inflexible in any area touching their moral- ity to remain reliably dependent. At any' moment they may announce;' This is wrong. I won't do it:' Overly creative people have similar defi- ciencies from a systems point of view. Scientific management is always on guard against people who don't fit securely into boxes, whether because of too much competency, too much creativity, too much popularity, or what have you.

There are more don'ts than days in the calendar, a tattoo with- out end. This non-stop negativity, so reminiscent of William Play- fair's prescription for schooling in Scotland, breaks many a spirit. The most enduring legacy of the DON'T drill is indifference to every- thing except narcotic anodynes like violence, rudeness, cruelty, alco- hol, and actual drugs with which the negativity can be escaped. How do I know? I spent 30 years in classrooms with nearly 4000 teenagers, many of whom I spoke with personally; another 20 in classrooms as a student myself, and 20 more studying the school busi- ness and talking about it allover the world. A school trip permission form sent in September, 2005, to par- ents of eighth grade pupils at the Queen Elizabeth Junior and Se- nior High School in Calgary, Canada will give you a good idea how schools discourage direct experience among parents as well as kids, as an important component of the negativity program: POTENTIAL HAZARDS MAY INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING: Bus travel to and from site: Motion sickness, injury from other person's motion sickness, injury from being thrown during sudden massive negative or positive acceleration,"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"128 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION tripping hazard when entering or exiting vehicle or moving down the aisle, overheating during transit, objects coming through open windows, injury from student putting head or limbs out of window, injury caused by own or other student's inappropriate behavior.

And what psychological effect does this grisly enumeration carry, repeated as it is on every excursion outside school walls? Is it designed to add value to the adventurous risk-taking without which the mass of the young are doomed to become and remain clerks lifelong? For- give my sarcasm.

The rhetoric of collectivization leads quickly to treating groups and sub-groups as averages. This makes managerial labor much eas- ier, but guarantees bad results no matter how many resources are devoted to improving the lot of the group. As with the well-funded Head Start program out of Washington, whatever small gains show statistically dissipate with time. The logic of collectivization seeks to disconnect each child from his or her own unique constellation, par- ticular circumstances, traditions, aspirations, past experiences, fami- lies, and to treat each as the representative of a type. By a process as inexorable as that with which the collapsing walls of a prison room force the prisoner toward a pit and death in Poes story, The Pit and the Pendulum, a collectively viewed classroom must aim for the lowest common denominator - a fatal decision from the start. When the mayor of New York City, an excellent manager in every other regard, was given control of the city schools in 2002 (heretofore in control of system bureaucrats and state-level politicians), instead of raising academic standards for all, he took bad advice and sought to deal with system-wide failure - particularly among students of color - by lowering the bar for everyone. Between 2002 and 2008 he in- creased dollar spending on schools 79 percent, he added 5000 teach- ers to the payroll (even though the attendance rolls had lost 60,000 students over this time) and the result as such things are measured was zero. All the while the current approach, embedding each student in a personalized curriculum whose aim would be to multiply the number of connections - to ideas, to experiences, to other people - was ig- nored.

Without self-knowledge you can hardly think of yourself as human at all. And yet we have the first National Commis- sioner of Education, right at the start of things, declaring that self- alienation is the goal of schooling. School disconnects, as it was charged to do. It is Caesar's \"divide and conquer\" strategy brought to peak efficiency. Children are divided from their families, their traditions, their communities, their religions, their natural allies - other children - their interests and on ad infi- nitum. They are, as Walter Lippman deplored, disconnected from the entire Western intellectual tradition which gave societies the greatest gift of personal liberties they had ever seen,disconnected from the ex- periences of risk-taking and adventure in which the grand discoveries of history have been fashioned; young men and women emerge from school unable to do much of anything, as Langdon Winner testified.

Whatever the _ truth of that proposition, on the airplane back to New York I took up the task of critiquing a bit of curriculum created for a chain of private schools on the West Coast. I had visited one of these schools near Los Angeles in the company of the curriculum director and in the brief time there was impressed by the good manners and easy-going civility of teacher-student rela- tions, and by the spirit of good will which visibly attended student ef- forts to participate in their own education. But two things bothered me a little. The first was this: in a meeting of school officials and my- self, to chat about school matters, several older students were asked to sit in and though the discussion bore exclusively on their own school lives, they had nothing to say and weren't encouraged to par- ticipate. When I was invited to ask some questions, I directed the first to the students in the room, \"If you could change some things, say one thing about this school, what would it be?\" I sensed a certain un- ease, even mild shock, among everyone there, including the students. What could kids possibly know, or care, about the management of their studies?! Nobody actually said that, it was simply a feeling I had that, ex- cept ceremonially, kids were in one compartment, professional staff in another, administration and curriculum experts in a third. Thus the powerful energy which would have been released by connecting all these parts to exchange information and insights was lost. The second thing that bothered me was that upon leaving, when I paused to examine a shelf of eighth grade textbooks, my eye hit on Homer's Odyssey, a book which along with Homer's Iliad had once provided the beating heart of classical Greek education. Committed to memory by many thousands, recited from memory, these tales of the Trojan War and its aftermath were no simple stories with which to kill time, but a series of particular moral dilemmas which in one form or another would afflict everyone in the course of a lifetime. Debating the proper course of action in these provided a rich mental diet."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"132 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION I was delighted to find The Odyssey as a part of the eighth grade curriculum until I opened the cover to find it was a bowdlerized ver- sion - rewritten and simplified for 13 and 14-year-old California students from prosperous families. As if the \"meaning\" could be ab- stracted from the language and presented in a livelier fashion than Homer.One thing is certain: if Homer had written the version I was . holding, nobody except an \"1\\' student anxious for a good grade would have ever read the book to its end, and the only way it would have sur- vived to bore a second generation of reader would have been as a text- book in a compulsory school scheme. But I was on my way out the door and these people not only had a school infinitely superior to the Los Angeles standard, but they were intelligent, caring folks nobody would have been reluctant to entrust their children to, so I made a casual comment that kids had been reading the original for a couple thousand years without protest, and left to catch my plane. The curriculum director asked if I'd look over a new workbook they were putting together for the elementary divi- sion, as we drove to LAX, and I said I would. At 35,000 feet I opened the book and found myself face to face with a talking choo-choo as my guide through the workbook. Al- though it's a bare 18 months later as I'm writing, the only detail of the text I can remember is the talking choo-choo. Everything else has faded; indeed, it faded as I read. Back home I wrote to the curriculum director at once: 26 February, 2007 Dear Dave, All that follows bears on the talking choo-choo your book is built around. I'm going to be candid because I like you so much, and enjoyed our talks in the brief time weve known one another. The talking choo-choo of child development theory is only one form of a German disease which insin- uated itelf into school development around the turn of the 20th century. The first invasion of this disease was in the"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Weapons of Mass Instruction kindergarten movement of the 19th century, but that never took sufficiently to satisfy its managers, so inserting cartoons into children's heads instead of real world ideas became the vogue as part of a great project to artificially extend child- hood and childishness. The project started in earnest at the beginning of the century and was acknowledged and even boasted about - by the dean of Teacher Education at Stan- ford University, who played a hand in its inception. As a weapon of mass instruction it's superior in its de- structive effect to all the others, the master weapon as it were. It's a principal cause of the intense and growing childishness of Americans in every social class, an indictment I hear from every corner of the world as I travel- and increasingly from domestic commentators, too. I know this is a heavy trip to lay at the doorstep of your choo-choo, but since this is just me talking to you I wanted to bypass the public relations aspect of things and strike at what troubles me about every sequential curriculum - simple to complex-I've ever seen. It's a strategy which has traveled under many names throughout history as leader- ship groups have worked to make their ordinary populations manageable. The project was brought to its scientific pinna- cle in the early decades of the 19th century in Prussia and ex- ported all around the world in the last half of that century. That's why I call it the German disease - the artificial extension of childhood. Make no mistake, it works. Once sufficiently infected with the virus the disease is progressive. Its victims become inadequate to the challenges of their ex- istence without help, and that relative helplessness makes them manageable. Remember, I'm using your talking choo-choo metaphor- ically, there are many ways to interdict the growth of com- petence, of clear thinking, of forceful purpose, and each is a talking choo-choo in different guise: think of slasher flicks, 133"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"134 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION think of pornography, think of Big Macs or tabloid/ network news - each is easy to take, each seemingly an inconsequen- tial time-killer. But ah! The ensemble of them playing their mindless tunes - the Death of a Thousand Cuts! The genius lies in setting up a perverse hunger which defies eradication later on as the victim struggles to grow up. This implanted need for simplifications in everything makes self-discipline difficult, and for most of us, only indifferently possible. We can't grow up after the disease has taken over - think of the blockbuster Hollywood films not in cartoon form, think of Peter Pan, Michael Jackson, Britney Spears shaving her head bald and sucking her thumb, think of the incessant commercial, \"I don't want to grow up, I'm a Toys- R-Us kid! I read in the L.A. times that upscale mothers try to dress and act like their nine-year-old daughters, I read in The Nation that the level of economic understanding is so mini- mal, so primitive, that it's difficult to conduct a discussion on any level beyond fairy tale simplification of things. The formula for talking choo-choo social control is set down in Cal- vin's Institutes (1535), refined impressively in Spinoza's Tractate (1670), and brought to institutional life by Fichte in the second decade of the 19th century. Since then it's been off to the races. The dark side of the Welfare State midwifed by Beatrice Webb and the Fabian socialists is not its superficial purpose of being kind, but its intention of killing with kindness, and thus protecting the interests of the better people, non-violently. The talking choo-choo is the tip of the tip of the ice- berg on which the damned are consigned to be frozen intellectually, psychologically, and socially. And now for a different way to see talking choo choos from the customary perspective (besides my own, that is). Consider Miss Bea- trix Potter, subject of a movie about her life in 2007 and a biography by St. Martin's Press. In 1912 at the pinnacle of her success she excori- ated her publisher for being afraid to print her new book unaltered, a tale of the kidnapping and near death of a sack of baby rabbits."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Weapons of Mass Instruction 135 \"I am tired of making goody-goody books;' she wrote, \"You are a great deal too much afraid:' Potter saw correctly that what set her apart from the general run of children's tale-tellers was that she em- ployed an \"attitude of mind\" full of darkness, violence, unsentimental- ity, and realism - exactly in the qualities which human life displays and which must be confronted directly if one is ever to become mas- ter of oneself. Children understand this, both implicitly and explicitly, and unlike schooling, Potter speaks to the need to think about these things. Her work is tart and crisp, dwelling frequently on death. In The Tale of Benjamin Bunny, an owl picks up a squirrel, \"intend- ing to skin him:' The Tale of Jemima Puddle Duck traffics in transcendental evil as the fox asks Jemima to pick out the seasonings in which she is to be cooked. Fee Fie Foe Fum I smell the blood of an Englishman Be he live or be he dead I'll grind his bones to make my bread Nothing is more interesting to young children than evil, cruelty, and malice; they are cognizant of these things before they can speak with any fluency. The hypocrisy of sweet animal tales and images in a cul- ture which murders animals wholesale and eats them with lip-smack- ing gusto is lost on most desensitized adults, but almost never lost on their children. And this ugly skew from reality is only one of many such contradictions our talking choo choo culture traffics in whole- sale. The effect of these amoral exercises is severe on children, despite apologetics practiced by child development experts who justify the practice. There are talking animals in Potter, but none are cute. \"Thank goodness my education was neglected;' Potter wrote, but what she meant was talking choo-choo schooling.

She de- spised those spirits ruined by theories inflicted upon them in long- term forced confinement, especially the ones who produced childish responses long after they had developed an inner life, because it was expected of them. The fact that children are still strongly attracted to Potter is a triumph of truth over the official illusions of institutional schooling. Detach the Training Wheels! According to The New York Times of December 15, 2006, Elena Delle Donne is the best female basketball player in the country, with \"the potential to alter the game for women in the same way Michael Jor- dan did for men:' She's off to a major college without it costing her a nickel and she is destined to make millions in endorsements. I'm tell- ing you about her, however, because of something she did at age three without any thought of basketball. She picked up a wrench and without any guidance detached the training wheels from her bike! At three she freed herself from the curse of childhood, that exquisitely German invention. Freed her- self of its damaging assumptions about what is possible and what is not. Try to imagine the internal organization that requires in a three- year -old: the close observation of wrenches, structure, processes; the planning that had to take place inside this thousand day old creature to even conceive such a plan, let alone execute it. To ensure more EI- en as, school would have to abandon the convenience of treating large groups in the aggregate - as \"classes:' Insist on classes and most Ele~ nas will be ruined in the egg. Think of Branson, think of Ben Franklin or George Washington, think of Octavia Walker and David Farragut described elsewhere in this book. When, as happens with some frequency, I'm asked by parents for a single suggestion for changing the relationship between them and their kids for the better, I don't hesitate to recommend this: Don't think of them as kids.

Even at seven don't edit the truth out of things. If the family has an income kids need to know to the penny what it is and how it's spent. Assume they are human beings with the same basic nature and aptitudes that you have; what you have superior in terms of experi- ence and mature understanding should be exchanged for their natural resilience, quick intelligence, imagination, fresh insight, and eagerness to become self-directing. Don't buy into the calculated illusion of extended childhood. It's a great secret key to power - power for your kids if you turn the tables on their handlers. And adolescence is a total fraud, a pure concoc- tion of social engineers barely a century old. It's a paradox, constantly threatening to solve itself as the young beat against the school jail in which we've confined them. Sometimes as I read obituaries - far and away the most valuable department in a good newspaper- I stumble across a new piece of evidence that what I've told you is true. On the 18th of April, 2003, for instance, my newspaper carried the obit of the world's IOlst richest man, John Latsis. If that name sounds vaguely familiar it's because his grandson Paris Latsis was for a brief time engaged to Paris Hilton, the celebrity heiress and beloved cut-up whose fornication video has been a staple of the American male imag- ination since its release to the world. John Latsis' yacht had been a familiar sight in the harbors of the planet for a long time before his death, having been loaned to Prince Charles, President Bush, Marlon Brando, Colin Powell and many other awe-inspiring somebodies. But nothing inspires my own awe more than Mr. Latsis' personal story. Born to a poor Greek family in a Greek fishing village, childhood was a luxury his family couldn't afford. He had no schooling to speak"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"138 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION of and began work as a laborer at the age of twelve. Latsis was ambi- tious for something more, however; eventually he hooked on as deck- hand on a rusty tramp freighter. After World War II, rusty freighters were a drag on the international freight market; almost valueless there were so many, built to haul war supplies and soldiers. At the age of 28 this poor boy, Latsis, took his savings and all the money he could borrow and put a down payment on one of the rusty freighters. Over the next 30 years he parlayed that single ship into a mighty fleet. Without any prompting from business school men- tors (of which he had none) he gradually branched out from shipping into construction, oil, banking and other enterprises. His growing so- phistication was a natural by-product of being fully connected to the world of affairs. Seventy-five years ago, schools routinely spoke of alternative roads to success like Latsis; they don't do that anymore. Eighty percent of the young today - even more - are prepared (in theory at least) for \"good jobs;' as specialized employees of one sort or another. Attention is never focused on lives like that taken by John Latsis; who made it without benefit of any formal education at all. Tania Aebi and George Meeghan Twenty years ago in 1989 a teenage girl named Tania Aebi sailed into New York Harbor after two years at sea alone, having circumnavi- gated the world - the first woman in history known to have per- formed this remarkable feat. She has no background in seamanship, no particular calling or aptitude for it, and only a vague knowledge of navigation when she set out, having failed Celestial Navigation on the Coast Guard exam. No matter. She taught herself the subject on board her vessel. And sailed her way into adulthood, the record books, and history. Tania had such difficulties at Brooklyn Tech High School that she gradually stopped attending, as you can discover by reading her book, Maiden Voyage; her father, disgusted with her rudeness and general demeanor, wanted her out of the house and offered to . buy her a 26"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Weapons of Mass Instruction 139 foot boat if she would sail it around the world alone. As a way to spite him, she accepted the challenge, dropped out, and did it. Thirty years ago, a poor young man from England conceived the idea of making the longest walk in human history. George Meeghan had no college degree, no specialized training, no state of the art equip- ment, no money, and no schooling beyond the third grade - he was a lowly deckhand on a nondescript steamer headed for the tip of South America. Leaving the ship there he made his way to Tierra del Fuego, faced north, and started to walk. His entire kit was towed behind him in one of those flimsy shopping carts people take to the market to roll . their purchases home. The wheels kept coming off. It was like a joke. It took George Meeghan seven years to cross the Andes, negoti- ate dangerous mountain nations, cross the trackless Darien Gap, and enter the United States. Once in Texas he decided to make a side trip to see Washington, D.C.-on foot of course - then turned north- west to Point Barrow, Alaska, to complete the longest walk in hu- man history. The bare outlineI've given you doesn't do George's saga (or Tania's) justice. I urge you to read his book, The Longest Walk, to discover what unschooled human beings are capable of. Recently, George's young daughter, Ayumi, walked the entire length of Japan from south to north. Two dropouts, two triumphs of the human spirit. No school on earth would dream of teaching what they learned, to write their own scripts, to be self-sufficient and purposeful. The longest walk in human history (check the Guinness Book for George), the longest solo sail (check the Guinness Book for Tania)-if two young people without much help or special equipment could do this in the 1970S and 1980s on sheer will power, can you ever believe again the hypo- thetical academic hypotheses of human migration? If Tania and George did it with nothing, then anonymous others have done it be- fore, too. \"Academic\" once referred to Akademos, the garden where Plato taught; it was a term of great respect for nearly two millennia, but by the late 19th century, it had come to mean \"of slight human interest\"; irrelevant."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION Now contrast the lives of Tania and George with the lives of 25,000 intensely schooled young people who work in Washington, D.C. and let their hair down on weekends in Dewey Beach, Delaware: Dewey Beach, Delaware, July 5, 2001 - In Corinthians, Paul preaches that adults put away childish things.

And the even weirder seeming indifference poor children display toward their ominous and onrushing futures? I had theories about this as a teacher, but never one I actually believed until an II- year-old Taiwanese immigrant boy named Andrew Hsu explained how you break the spirit of fleas to they can be trained. His explana- tion was printed in an autobiogtaphical sketch he wrote for the cer- emony in which he and I received the same award, but the material recognition for me paled in comparison to what I learned from An- drew that day. In the first place, he was fresh from winning the Washington State Science and Engineering Fair, for his sequencing of a gene held in common between man and mouse: COL20IA. At II, Andrew was a"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Weapons of Mass Instruction 141 champion swimmer with many trophies. He spoke Chinese, French, and English, all fluently. He worked in his spare time as an assistant on professional documentary films. And he was homeschooled. When asked to describe the most important lesson of his life, the one which held the most influence over his choices, he said it was a story told to him by his father about the method used to train fleas to swing on trapezes, drive little chariots, (or pull them) and all the other wonderful things fleas lear~ed to do to amuse kings and courts in world history. The story his father told goes like this: If you put fleas in a shallow container they jump out. But if you put a lid on the container for just a short time, they hit the lid trying to escape and learn quickly not to jump so high. They give up their quest for freedom. Afrer the lid is removed, the fleas remain impris- oned by their own self-policing. So it is with life. Most of us let our own fears or the impositions of others imprison us in a world of low expectations. Reading that, my whole life as a schoolteacher flashed before my eyes. I had been hired to be the lid on the petri dish which the kids would butt their heads trying to follow their own path until one day, exhausted, they would quit trying.

How to Drive A Horse Slightly Insane The time we spend trapped in schooling and its humbug renders most of us passive, incompletely human, unable to function as sov- ereign spirits. But other tools exist to clip our wings, just to be safe. Those who break out of the school doors or hang out in bathrooms and stairwells aren't the biggest problem - after all, where can they run? The biggest danger to the social order comes from those who re- treat into the secret recesses of their inner lives where no snoop can penetrate.

Some years back I saw with some surprise my school experience mirrored in the pages of a highly specialized journal, a publication of the Equine Mental Health Association. The relevant article was pa- per-clipped and mailed from Frankfurt, Kentucky, by a Mr. and Mrs. Howard, horse enthusiasts like my wife, Janet. It considers damage done to quality horseflesh when the scope of their daily experience is over-simplified: Tick off the conditions which cause a horse to go slightly crazy as you read and compare them to the familiar discipline of an aver- age school: ... Keep them predominantly idle, keep them apart from other horses, and you will create an animal that interacts with the world in ways clearly un-natural ... timid, crazy, un- dependable, bolting, bucking, avoidant, shying, etc. Keep a horse from accessing the wisdom of the herd and the wis- dom of its own nature and you get a horse that doesn't know where it belongs in the world. Under such conditions well- bred horses with tremendous potentials end up living their lives as ... consumers instead of contributors. Consumers rather than contributors. Of course that's the point, which you already understand if you've followed the meandering ar- gument of my book closely - mass market corporate capitalism and the financial capitalism which has been replacing it for some time, both need consumers who define the value of their lives by consump- tion; both understand that only a small fraction of people need to know how to produce - and anything beyond that small fraction is a deadly poison to the system because the spectre of overproduction will frighten capital into hiding."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Weapons of Mass Instruction 143 Overproduction has to be stopped is the policy belief. Schools are the principal factory in which that is done; consumption on the other hand has to be enhanced - and no condition stimulates consump- tion like boredom, especially when the imagination and the inner life have been paralyzed by endless memory drills, the synthetic crises of continual testing, and a thorough conditioning in rewards and pun- ishments, the game of winners and losers. Do people actually think this way~ If you ask me that question, I'd have to reply with some sor- row: Yes. The Cauldron of Broken Time When time is tightly scheduled, we are compelled to attend more to the appearances of attention and concern than to the reality of those qualities; without uninterrupted time you haven't a prayer of synthe- sizing the fact bits thrown at you. It's possible to memorize the of- ficial meaning of those bits, but in the time available no possibility remains of arriving at your own careful conclusions. After years of study, we know that uninterrupted sleep time is essential for precision in thought, but as Claire Wolfe, a west coast writer once taught me, uninterrupted waking time is similarly essential. When you can't con- centrate, it's hard to make sense of things. Rather than persist in try- ing, it's easier just to quit. The destruction of uninterrupted time is a major weapon of mass instruction. Schools are a rat's maze of frantic activity,: bells, loud- speakers, messengers pounding on classroom doors, shrieks from the playground, official visitors, unofficial visitors, toilet interruptions coming and going, catcalls, bullyings and £lirtings - you never know when the next interruption will appear. Try to reckon the psychologi- cal effect of being plunged into a cauldron of broken time, in Miss Wolfe's phrase, again and again for 12 years (in the student's case) and even longer in th: teacher's.

You'll never come close to the exalted condition education can of- fer, where money and fame don't matter very much, as long as you re- main content to memorize somebody else's definition of the thing, but reflecting seriously on what someone else says about it isn't worthless. It can bring you closer to your own truth - as Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart said about pornography, \"I can't define it, but I know it, when I see it:' With that in mind, I'm going to offer you no compre- hensive definition, but three \"probes\" into the mystery: one from an unusually acute travel writer named James Salter; one from a state- ment I gave to a Senate committee seventeen years ago; and one from a free verse scribbled on a legal pad while I was wrestling with the idea for a letter I intended to send to my granddaughter, Kristina, which you'll find as Chapter Nine in this book. James Salter was looking for a way to capture in words the admi- ration he felt for the continent of Europe and its history. He began by saying that Europe helps to clari£}r Kant's questions: The thing it finally gave me was education, not the lessons of school but something more elevated, a view of how to endure: how to have leisure, love, food, and conversation, how to look at nakedness, architecture, streets, all new and seeking to be thought of in a different way. In Europe the shadow of history falls upon you and, knowing none of it, you realize suddenly how small you are. To know nothing is to have done nothing. To remember only yourself is like worshipping a dust mote. Europe is on the order of an im- mense and unfathomable classroom, beyond catalogue or description. Confronted with the mighty epic of Europe and its inexhaustible bounty, Salter is able to see how far \"the lessons of school\" are from education. Look around you at America, as he did Europe: did your own schooling teach you how we got this way?"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"What is Education? 147 The next two offerings are my own. On October 23, 1991, I got an invitation to give testimony to the US Senate Committee on La- bor and Human Relations. The subject: speculation what schools in the year 2000 were going to look like. Although I've polished prose, grammar, and syntax a little to spare myself embarrassment that an old English teacher would write so sloppily, the argument remains as I delivered it. And the reader will note that the future, as I foresaw it a decade down the line, happened right on schedule. Senator Ted Ken- nedy of Massachusetts was the committee chair: Senator Kennedy, distinguished committee members, guests: what we should most fear is that school in 2000 will look exactly like school in 1990. School in 1990 is almost exactly like school was in 1890. Keep in mind, however, that if we moved back almost another hundred years, to 1790, the echoes would vanish. In 1790 it was still possible to become educated in America be- cause school didn't preempt all the time of the young, nor did it act as a leech upon family life then; it didn't impose servile habits on the growing up time; it didn't indoctrinate young minds with a burden of too many pre-thought thoughts. It was still possible to take an education in 1790 because too many people weren't around pretending to give you one, forcing you to ac- cept what they offered under penalty of law. In your own Massa- chusetts, Senator, more citizens were literate under a system where schooling was voluntary and of short duration, than ever they have been under the long-term compulsion scheme in place right now. Whether it will ever again be possible to take an education easily, in Massachusetts or any other state, will depend upon political deci- sions made by those - like yourselves - who hold power in trust for the rest of us. I mean no disrespect, only to signal my personal sadness when I say I don't think those decisions ~ill be made. My reasons for pessimism stem from knowing that failure is built into our political system because it forces our political leadership to de- pend for its election on the same financial interests which profit from schools staying the way they already are.

Don't chalk that up to cynicism: unless you acknowledge why your hands are tied in regard to school change, you're certain to make the same mistakes year after year in counterfeit reforms. Change isn't likely to be possible from any political center for the same reason, but it can come from defiant personal decisions made by simple men and women who won't stand still for their kids be- ing outraged any more -like the revolution ofhomeschoolers taking place nationwide. This system has had a century to prove itself, that's enough. It didn't work at the start except in house-generated fairy tales; it doesn't work today, and it won't work better in the future. But if we can pry the boot of the political state off our necks, by the year 2000 here's what might begin to emerge. First we'd have a long, loud national, regional, and local debate whose purpose would be to establish the range of acceptable definitions of an educated person. Professional pedagogy has never done that except in the airiest generalizations because it knows better than to have its hands tied to commitments it can't deliver. At the most arrogant end of the insti- tutional spectrum we have public enemies like James Bryant Conant, the WWI poison gas specialist and longtime president of Harvard, who announced in 1959 that education is \"whatever a school delivers:' Dr. Conant was annoyed that any mere citizen might think he had the right to question decisions made by experts like himself What he demanded for himself, in essence, was the right to say, \"Education is whatever I say it is:' But a public definition of the goals of mental and character train- ing can't be avoided. If we the people don't agree on ends there is no way on earth to make beginnings - would you set out by car on a 12- year journey whose destination was \"out there somewhere\"?

Every president of the United States"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"What is Education? 149 since such testing was launched has had a mediocre to poor standard- ized test score; the same is more true than not among corporate exec- utives. If the scores had any meaning wouldn't they be a common piece of data demanded by consumers? Would you bet on a horse without consulting its past performance charts reduced to mathematical data? Yet you are compelled to bet on schoolteachers, principals, superin- tendents, college professors, etc. every day without being given ac- cess to this \"valuable\" information. What kind oflunacy is that? High standards and standardization are two very different things but you have been deliberately led by the rules of Newspeak to regard them as the same, just as you've been conditioned to think of education and schooling in the same breath. The long, loud, angry national debate I'm calling for, Senator, would settle school's side of the bargain by producing a list of valu- able human competencies schools would guarantee to enhance - or lose their ability to command attendance with the police power of the state. That said, let me give you my own list: + Educated people are seldom at a loss what to do with time; be- ing alone is often a blessing to the educated because they like their own company. Time doesn't hang heavily on their hands. + Educated people can form healthy attachments anywhere because they understand the dynamics of relationships. + Educated people are aware of, accept, and understand the signifi- cance of their own mortality and each of its seasons. They learn from each moment, they gain insight all their ages, even to their last minutes on earth. + Educated people possess a hard-won personal blueprint of value. They accept no prepackaged marching orders without passing them through the test of critical review. But they are also aware of a larger, human community and its values, are knowledgeable about values in different cultures. + Educated men and women enjoy power to create new things, new ideas and new experiences; the educated discover truth for"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"ISO WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION themselves through the rules of evidence, not by memorizing opinions of others. + Educated people detect other people's needs and in moving to meet those needs earn a living. But unlike the ignorant, the edu- cated never become overly dependent on material wealth for hap- piness, recognizing that the most valuable goods -love, curiosity, reverence, and empathy - can be had without cost. + Educated people actively seek variety and know how to master it sufficiently for pleasure and enlightenment. Yet they are aware, too, that without a home of their own and home responsibilities variety is hollow, experience superficial. + The curriculum to become educated is drawn from great life pas- sages which have united generations from the beginning of time. First is the mystery of birth and the mysterious emergence of self. To explore self requires intimate knowledge of one's parents and ancestors - and of the specific , cultures which helped form them. The local cultures, that is, much more than the abstract entities we call political states. Who am I~ Where are my limits~ What are my po~sibilities~ What range do the strange selves about me dis- play~ Exploring these things are like crucial appointments an edu- cated person must keep; without honoring these only incomplete adulthood results. + The physical world near and far must be thoroughly exam- ined, analyzed, tested. This is work which can't adequately be done in confinement or through blackboard abstractions. When compulsion-schooling steals time needed for this work the dam- age is great. There is a time and place in life's sequence when these appointments must be kept; too long delayed and opportunity is lost forever. + The complex possibilities of association must be encountered and wrestled with - it won't work to merely talk about these, or see TV shows. They include family relationships, friendships, com- panionships, comradeship, love, hate, community, networking and more. Each has strengths and dangers inherent in the form."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"What is Education? 15 1 Not to practice each early on is to risk becoming emotionally crip- pled. But confinement schooling is designed to socialize children into networks - the very weakest and least reliable of all human associations. Networks are certain to betray your trust if relied upon excessively. + Another major theme which takes attention in the educated mind is a thoughtful approach to vocation - how does one contribute to the common good and at the same time earn a living? Then we meet the theme of \"growing up\" as a vocation of its own. How is that distinct from being a child? What complex of obligations ac- cepted does growing up entail, acceptance of which brings matu- rity and independence? + And we can't leave out a very close study of Death, the last act of the dramatic cycle begun by the mystery of Birth. Without clear awareness of the short arc of a life, nothing means very much. If we lived forever, no choice would ever be significant because end- less time would be available to choose again and again. Time is strictly finite. Every choice precludes another, that's the reality which vests existence with meaning. We need to realize that the dying owe the oncoming generations a world at least' as good as the one they experienced while fully alive; if possible a better one.

Our new school, if it ever happened, would diminate centralized testing because of what these rituals do in ranking children by ab- stract measures. They have little connection with developing mental powers, or the character traits of good citizens. Tests restrict the very development we claim to be seeking. Our new school would eliminate testing for other reasons, too, fi- nally accepting what experience clearly demonstrates - testing is a poor predictor: Mass testing institutionalizes dishonesty; it belongs to predatory cultures, not dynamic republics. Let testing return to China and the Manchu dynasty which spawned it. Because testing correlates with nothing very real, it mis-identifies winners and los- ers in a reckless fashion, among its many unfortunate by-products is that testing targets problems for attention which aren't 'problems at all. Take the problem of poor reading, a self-correcting deficiency when the game-board can be set up differently. Once mis-identified by test scores, however, the creation of bureaucracy to \"solve\" the non- problem can seem a rational thing to do. I use reading as the emblem of this wastefUl craziness because it may be the principal motor driv- ing forced schooling. To learn to read and to like it takes about thirty contact hours un- der the right circumstances, sometimes a few more, sometimes a few less. It's a fairly easy skill for anyone to pick up if good reasons to do so are provided. Exhortation isn't sufficient, however, nor intimida- tion, humiliation, or the confUsion of a classroom fUll of strangers. The only way you can stop a child from learning to read and liking it - in the densely verbal culture which surrounds us all with printed language anywhere we turn - is to teach it the way we teach it. You should begin with the attitude that nothing is wrong in the natural variation which finds one child reading at five and another at twelve. By the time both are fifteen nobody can tell which one learned to read first.

The pedagogical apparatus which compels age-graded five-year-olds to be ranked according to ability to respond \"correctly\" to a teacher's urgencies gives rise to our familiar reading pathologies. By the time a seemingly slow reader approaches adulthood, he or she will display indifference to reading, or hatred of it, because of our methods. So far our new school has dropped use of a walled compound. It occurs everywhere: on farms, in ships, in private homes, in churches, offices, on hillsides in the grass, and in rooms of a thousand complex- ions. It has decertified schoolteaching completely so that anyone with a skill to transmit can touch those who want to learn that skill. The Internet makes this transformation simple. All we lack at present is will to bring it about against the opposition of those who benefit from things as they are. What makes achieving that will particularly difficult is that the opponents to change are all too frequently our rel- atives or ourselves. This new school we're creating puts money to purchase outside educational help back in the hands of taxpayers. That will break the monopoly on the training of youth and restore an open system of learning from everywhere we enjoyed from colonial times to the end of the Civil War. Monopolies suppress initiative, make poor use of feedback from customers who have nowhere else to go, and generate an aversion to truth. Our new school has flexible time commitments operating in flex- ible spaces with flexible study options and flexible sequencing. It has these things not because of any momentary fashion, but because the range of human variety demands it. We will discard standardized testing entirely but not standards of high quality. Standardization cripples imagination and imagination has always been the real driving engine of our powerful economy. The rankings these tests generate argue quite dishonestly that they corre- late tightly with real world excellence, yet they do nothing of the sort.

Any type of change which will produce new value for our society through schooling will involve less school time, less school personnel, less store-bought materials, less interference in the natural processes of learning. Any school reform that will work, academically and be- haviorally, will cost much less money than we are currently spending. It will involve gradual merging of schooling with community life, a de-professionalization of the learning enterprise. That's why positive change directed from the top isn't likely to happen: it would require political courage from men and women who benefit greatly from the existence of mass-schooling and the jobs and contracts it commands. It's a dilemma worthy of Solomon, one which virtually demands that reform come from the bottom, not the top; from millions of acts of productive sabotage on the part of parents and students, and yes - from teachers like myself. We must behave like noble termites, tunneling the current structure until it dissolves of its own dead weight: we must encourage schoolpeople to sabotage the system while pretending not to. I know how odd this all sounds: first I tell you reading, writing, and arithmetic are easy to learn as long as they aren't taught system- atically, and now I tell you that the very \"comprehensive\" school insti- tution which Harvard called for in the 1950S is ruining our children, not helping them.

We learned to compute the same way we learned to drive - without much professional help. Isn't it obvious a lot of people who are making good use of com- puters right now would have failed computer class in school:' Many would have been toO embarrassed, too scared, too angry and con- fused in a school setting to really learn. We don't learn anything else there very well, why would computers be any different:' In another twenty years when every school is computerized, can't you predict already schools claiming that without school training, we never could have made a transition to the information age:' You and I will know that isn't so, won't we:' Draw a parallel with driving. It's a dangerous ballet of hand/ eye/ foot coordination while simultaneously providing the intellectual chal- lenge of constant calculation, strategy, and life and death split-second choices.

Indeed, our commercial civilization, spread out as it is, would be hurt badly if they didn't. That's why we don't demand drivers be schooled, only that they be competent.

Your four years at a special high school will have infused you with the essential gospel of our command econ- omy - that college is the foundation of a successful life and that only elite colleges like Dartmouth possess the secrets you need. Never mind that nobody could actually tell you specifically what happens at those places, in those seats, to transform you. It must be taken on faith like the virgin birth. As you await the college's fateful decision you'll hear friends say that if they don't get the fat acceptance envelope to a prestige school they will kill themselves. Every year a few desperate souls do just that. I remember back in the early 1950S when Duke turned me down I was ready to enlist in the Army until my second choice, Cornell, opened its heart and took me in. As for Pitt or Penn State where the com- mon herd grazed, it was unthinkable for a snob like myself to con- template. Such was the malignant influence of the country club set over my judgement. Feelings like this are common now in our country, a clear sign our once brilliant uniqueness grounded in hard-nosed egalitarianism is dead. The philosophy abroad in American schools these days was best rendered by George Orwell in Animal Farm as a belief among managerial pigs that although all animals, of course, are equal, some animals are more equal than others. If you feel that way, even a little bit, get rid of it as you would a tumor. It's a moral cancer and it will eat you alive if you accept it.

Like voodoo, where you go to college - or if you go at all- is only a real question in minds bewil- dered by illusion. That's not to say education doesn't matter. It does. You need finely tuned critical judgement to defend yourself in the dangerous house of mirrors America has become. It's just that college won't give you edu- cation. Only you can do that. Be patient a little longer with an old fellow and let me tell you what kind of schooling I think Dartmouth represents and then what kind I think you need. You will learn how to game the system at Dartmouth, I won't try to deny that, and you'll learn how to conceal your pain and confusion. You'll learn to think how and what the boss wants you to think, how to dress as the boss wants you to dress, and how to value what the boss wants you to value. And you'll learn to believe that all those things were your own idea. It's very subtle, Dartmouth's teach- ing; you won't even realize it's happening. The first clue to the change will be when you suddenly realize how uncomfortable your own parents make you feel. How you wish they would butt out of your life. Dartmouth is all about contrived problems, nothing real. The \"case study\" method is big there, part of a system which deludes its followers into thinking that application can be learned by simulation. A little of that doesn't hurt, but a lot is worse than worthless: It fills you with false confidence that complex problems are fully amenable to method - like repairing machinery is - but when you try to fit human beings into the abstract simplifications of method you dis- cover they have to be forced to obey the theory.

Without it you are lost and will flounder again and again through life. By now you should have introspected enough to know your own charac- ter: its proclivities, strengths, weaknesses, blessings, curses. How much assistance has your high school given you to accomplish this? 2. Observation: Your powers of observation in any situation should be razor sharp; at will you should be able to function like an objective cameral tape recorder sucking in accurate data for later analysis. Can you \"read\" the primary documents and images from every age and place? Or must you take someone else's word for their meaning? 3. Feedback: Are you rigorously trained to pick up cues about yourself from the reactions of others and from signals out of the environment? Do you have trouble accepting criticism and evaluating its worth?

Judgement: Can you evaluate dispassionately? Can you see through falsehood? The society you are entering is a house of mirrors; little of what you see and few of those you meet will be what they appear. The most attractive personalities are invariably dishonest. How much chance did you have to develop judgement and test it? 8. Adding Value: Do you add value to every encounter, to ev- ery group of which you are a part? Do you even know what that means? If you aren't worth something to others, then truly you are worthless. That 's Kurt Vonnegut speaking in one of his books, Slaughterhouse Five, I think. There's more, but this is enough to start. You won't improve your grasp of these things by hanging around White River Junction and getting 'A:' s. You are at present trapped in a labyrinth built by past genera- tions; our entire nation, too; we're in a maze schooling can't help us to escape; the weakened nation you are inheriting is beyond school's power to strengthen. Let me show you why a little: Social unrest is everywhere, a loss of faith in American leadership among our own citizenry and all over the world. Harvard and Dart- mouth (as metaphors) have a lot to do with that loss of faith. It's been caused by a unilateral reorganization of work on the part of large em- ployers who - I think it's fair to say - own our government. A reor- ganization planned at our elite universities where life is graceful and all problems knuckle under to method. This coalition of social engineers exports American jobs to fatten the corporate bottom line, and imports foreign workers to accomplish the same end. Multi-billionaires like Bill Gates - who apparently isn't satisfied yet that he has enough money - are in the forefront of"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION this movement. Then, there is a spreading practice called \"contingent labor;' where a company can save the cost of medical care, pensions, vacations, and the like by hiring on a temporary basis for the dura- tion of a project. That has created a national proletariat with shallow roots in place of family, unable to plan any rational future because of job uncertainty and the need to be able to scramble wherever called just to subsist. Another big unilateral decision we have Harvard and Company to thank for is the idea of \"Lean Production:' Lean Produc- tion is more evidence that compassion is no longer a factor binding management to those who labor. In Lean Production the \"Workforce\" is stripped to the bone. As FrederickTaylor showed an earlier indus- trial establishment, it is then scientifically squeezed for every bit of juice it contains. The unilateral reorganization of work is the reason for the grow- ing gulf between rich and poor in America, the deepest such gulf on Planet Earth. It is destroying our historic middle class, destroying the working classes, and has broken the safety net around the poor - which depends on compassion, not efficiency, to maintain. The panic you feel growing around you will only stop by political action, not by better schooling. The New Atlantis College was transformed into a training ground for work right af- ter WWII, work that is as corporations and government bureaus and university departments define work, not as real people do. A few colleges escaped this transformation, but none you are likely to have heard of and certainly not a single Ivy institution or similar. The new collegiate landscape followed a formula set down by Francis Bacon in the 17th century in his utopian fragment, The New Atlantis, a book which while unknown to the circles you travel with has actually been held in the same high regard as religious scripture by important interests for centuries. In The New Atlantis, Bacon dem- onstrates how a world-university can act as a stabilizer for wealth and power.

College as utility fit a grander design, one of total and comprehensive social control, the dream of rulers since Solomon. Under this new regimen which spread across the 19th century from a center in northern Germany, an intense degree of surveillance was put in place to make certain the common herd didn't stampede. Following the advice of two nineteenth century Italian social think- ers, Pareto and Mosca, the best talent of the underclasses was spotted early and drawn up into the command module to rob the masses of future leadership. Pragmatists like Pierce,James, Dewey, and Holmes, the new mach;avellians, were responsible for this. Society slowly became a laboratory in which big brother or his technological equivalent was always watching, and where punish- ment was always close at hand. To reach the goal of scientific man- agement, a managed America had to be made rule-bound after the , model of ancient Israel of Mishnah. But an impressive sophistica- tion was obtained as well in the leadership of this project. If liberty was being curtailed in one area, license was encouraged in every zone of traditional morality. In sex, marriage, religion, family, the training of the young, an \"anything goes\" ethic was introduced and promoted steadily, a development which undercut any opposition from tradi- tional moral centers by dividing children in school from their tradi- tional sources of moral training at home. I know how science-fictional this must all seem at 17 when per- sonal realities are calling for attention in your life, but I have a stag- gering piece of symbolic evidence that what Bronx Science has taught you doesn't begin to describe the reality you'll be wrestling with in the years ahead.

If you want a definition for radical, here it is. Don't let it sit with you as a conversational odd- ity, it is a colossal fact, it means something srupendous to your future. Its ramifications are a good deal more significant for what your life will be than any college you choose to attend. It has happened for the same reason factory schooling happened. Factory schooling replaced our historically libertarian forms of schooling at the beginning of the 20th cenrury in order to standard- ize a kaleidoscopic pattern of individualized lives which tended to go off in many directions. A managerial utopia could not be made from such raw material; liberty plays no part in managerial efficiency - families like the MacAdams, the Gattos, and the Zimmers must be prevented from reproducing their eccentric outlooks or an essential subordination could never be achieved. This is why school had to be made compulsory, and why schools like Bronx Science were cre- ated - to minimize the influence that people like you and your an- cestors would have on the whole. Far from being a screwy pipe-dream of your old granddad, or an ideologically driven phantasm of some cult, it is quite impossi- ble to read heavily into history - even in its sanitized texts - with- out coming to something like the formulation I've just given you. For that reason alone, hard reading has been discouraged in the schools; if you read too much the official stories wear thin and blow away like smoke. All this garbage is right up on the surface to be seen unless at- tention can be diverted away by the irrelevant texts and procedures of schooling.

Those safeguards were only up a very short time before institutional schooling came along and broke them. Jefferson was familiar with Spinoza, the Dutch philoso- pher who designed systematic schooling expressly to put the minds and imaginations of the ordinary population to death. He knew that at best school would be about making clerks and servants, not think - ers and artists . I spent ten years poking around the great school legend.

Indeed, if you struggle hard to free yourself, Kristina, before you 're dragged any further into the abyss by Dartmouth, I have evidence that personal miracles are still possible. I'm going to take a bit of that evidence from a surprising source. The Great Imposters The record of great imposters in recent years is one text you need to reflect upon for the priceless lesson it can teach about the supposedly vital training required to operate successfully inside certain occupa- tions. Let 's start with surgery and \"Dr \" Ferdinand Demara, a \"Lieu- tenant Commander\" on a Canadian warship operating off the Korean coast during the so-called\"Korean War:'"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"168 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION Dr. Demara found himself facing an emergency appendectomy in the medical office of a small ship in heavy weather, a tough job for a real doctor (and he was far from that), calling on all the sea legs that a naval officer had developed at sea. But Demara was neither a sailor nor a medical man, only a cheeky imposter who had done stints as an airline pilot, a railroad engineer, and a Catholic priest in his interest- ingcareer. And yet, laboring under these handicaps, he was able to suc- cessfully conclude the operation all alone (he didn't dare call for as- sistance), save a grateful man's life, and receive the highest honor the Canadian navy can bestow - an unfortunate conclusion to this won- derful story since the doctor Demara was pretending to be saw the press coverage and screamed. The crime and punishment part of this story holds no interest for me so let me cut to the chase: All Demara needed to perform this tricky surgery was an illustrated textbook of how to perform the op- eration (which he found in the medical office library), some strong nerves (every imposter's stock in trade) and an ability to read, inter- pret photographs, and follow clear instructions. Anyone with those gifts can perform much surgery (not all, but much) by the numbers. Were we to unbundle much of the medical nonsense which guards the privileges of a dishonest profession, the standard of health around the world would soar - as it has in Cuba - while the princely in- comes which make stock advisory services a fixture in the life of doc- tors would plummet. At present, every serious medical condition on earth can be treated overseas in what amounts to luxury surroundings for about one-third the American cost; state of the art dentistry is available in several places just across the US/Mexican border for a small fraction of American prices; and medicine of all sorts may be self-prescribed there for pennies on the dollar for what would bill at heart-breaking prices in the United States. Shouldn 't our schoolchildren know these things in order to become \"informed consumers\"? But no school that taught them would remain open very long."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"A Letter to My Granddaughter About Dartmouth 169 The Demara story sticks with me because something of the same sort happened to me in the I980s in the year your mother graduated from MIT. We planned an expedition in her honor in the Mayan country: Palen que, Tikal, Copan, complete with volcanoes, fishing boats, orchid jungles, the works. But I ruined the trip by overplanning for contingencies; in a move to trick Fate I went down alone a month in advance hoping to drop off a wedding gift for your cousins Blake and Lauren who were being married on top of the volcano Popocate- petl (after climbing it first), and then take myself through the stages one after another to see they worked smoothly, andI wouldn't bum- ble around like a jerk when the real moments came. That dress rehearsal cost me my right hip. Soaring past Monter- rey on the way to Popo, and after that San Christobal, I ran into a gravel truck head on at 70 miles per hour. Ay caramba! I woke on the operating table of a charity hospital in Monterrey with my right hip being bolted together with three huge pins. And promptly fainted .. When I woke again I was in a ward with roaches swarming everywhere and a sleeping policeman by the bedside - I was under arrest for \"damaging the highway:' Next morning the doc- tor who operated, who wasn't a doctor at all but only a 23-year-old intern, was there when I awoke, with a big smile from ear to ear. He gave me a big hug and said with delight: \"Everyone said you would die! I had never done this operation be- fore. But I had a German textbook with pictures of every step to take and here you are - you are alive!\" So when I read about Demara I had good reason to know it was true. Here's another story to mull over: Suppose someone told you that with only a few hours chi.ssroom training that anyone would pilot a four engine airliner with some precision?

The Barings story brings to mind the spectacular frauds perpetrated by the reckless brain trust at Enron, once America's seventh largest cor~ poration and now defunct, and the rapid demise of Bear~Stearns, and Lehman Brothers, the fifth and fourth largest US investment banks, which succumbed to gambling with borrowed money - thirty times more borrowed money than it was worth, in Bear~Stearns' case.

Octavia was so intent on her drawing that the article's writer commented on her abil~ ity to concentrate under the conditions. As the story unfolded, we learned that little Octavia had serious aspirations to a career in fashion - and no interest at all in pats of the head or\"A+\"s. She was her mother's assistant in reality, in Paris to help with the exhibition, not as a cute thing to do.

Kristina? As I was reading the piece, the thin scrim of artificially extended childhood schools were invented to impose dropped away and I saw again, as I often do, the different world we could create if we dropped the pretense that childhood goes on very long past the age of seven. The New Yorker article ended with Kara remembering an event that happened when Octavia was four - the same age as Branson when he walked about London. Octavia was watching her mother being interviewed by a swarm of reporters when suddenly; in agitation, she called out in a loud voice: \"Kara Walker! Kara Walker! When is it going to be my turn?!\" Age four, remember. That's the point, Kristina. The school you're attending. Bronx Science, the college you hope to attend, Dartmouth, and indeed all schools in general exist to delay the ordinary - even the \"bright\" or- dinary such as your Bronx Science classmates - from taking their turn. And the worst places seek to intimidate you into taking the turn they want you to take, not the one your own spirit would have chosen. It's an obscene form of mental colonization, a reckless waste of your all- too-short existence. Most of those who are seduced into waiting their turn, by places like Bronx Science or Dartmouth, never actually get a turn, they grow old and die unrealized. Don't let that happen to you or the family ghosts will be very angry.

And no pragmatist carried more clout than Charles Pierce, the eminence grise behind William James and John Dewey. Listen to Pierce's mind at work in the 1870S as he contem- plated the advent of forced schooling: Let the will of the state act, then, instead of that of the in- dividual. Let an institution be created which shall have for its object to keep correct doctrines before the attention of the people, to reiterate them perpetually, and to teach them to the young, having at the same time power to prevent contrary doctrines from being taught, advocated, or expressed. Let all possible causes of a change of mind be removed from men's apprehension. Let them be kept ignorant, lest they should learn of some reason to think otherwise than they do. Let their passions be enlisted, so that they may regard ... unusual opinions with hatred and horror. Then, let all men who reject the established belief be terrified into silence ....

In hunting for the difference between school and education, con- sider these layers: Schooling is organized by command and control from without; education is self-organized from within; school dis- connects its clientele from other primary sources of learning. It must do that to achieve administrative efficiency; education sets out to pro- vide a set of bountiful connections which are random, willful, promis- cuous, even disharmonious with one another - understanding that the learning of resourcefulness, self sufficiency, and invention will in- evitably involve surprising blends of things, things impossible to pre- dict or anticipate in advance. In education the student is awakened to the critical role natural feedback loops play in becoming independent. Feedback loops at- tended to closely - not circumscribed by rules - create custom- ized circuits of self-correction rather than a slavish need to follow the generalized direction of others. But schooling is bound on the other hand to emphasize rules made by others. It's impossible even to imag- ine a school that could allow free will deviation from its programmes, except to the most trivial degree. Education is never committed to subject knowledge, it always tends to regard things in rich contexts. Subject-learning is what schools do because their intention is to create clerks, and specialists, who themselves are merely a fancy form of clerk. But over and over again in the sciences and elsewhere we've come to understand that cross-fertilization, mixing the academic disciplines (and more) is the powerful driver of scientific advance.

Shouldn't the present moment be devoted to problem- solving? Can't past shortcomings be ascribed to ordinary ineptitude, venality, imperfect leadership and such like? You must decide these questions for yourself, but as for me, I con- cluded long ago that some deliberate intent was (and is) at work on the school institution, that it operates far from public access, and un- til it is confronted the term \"school reform\" is meaningless. Unless the ends of the operation are put on public trial, and its sexual relation- ships with economics and social management exposed to the light and ended, each reform effort will only be another illusion, another room added to the national house of mirrors. But you'll have to convince yourself of the substance of my allega- tion, that some sort of dark matter, some powerful but invisible force is at work in schooling. If you are to become strong enough to defend yourself, and your family I can't do the work for you, you can't mem- orize my conclusions. To that end I'm going to tell you three hair- raising school stories which will seem, at first, inexplicable to you, aberrations perhaps. Your job will be to interpret what they mean, if anything. As you hear these stories, try to imagine which officials, lo- cated where, could finally have signed-off on these initiatives. And in whose interests. As you think about them, keep in mind that no sane bureaucrat, no matter how highly placed, would dream of initiating anything which might embarrass or anger the managers of things. Keep Hobbes in mind as you reflect, power is never where it seems to be. For myself, I tried to find a simple explanation to put these stories into the normal course of things, but try as I might they wouldn't fit. Only a darkness at work, reachable not by common experience but through historical, sociological, psychological, theological, political and philosophical research, could reveal the causes, it seemed to me. Hence this book. But you may disagree. Perhaps as Alexander saw a simple solution to the Gordian knot and Occam saw that in science simple explana- tions cut closer to the truth, you'll see an explanation I missed."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"180 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION Meanwhile, three stories: one from Nuremberg, Germany in 2008; one from Highland, New York, in 2004, and one from Walden, Vermont in 1991. I could tell you many more in a similar vein which suggest to me a dark force living inside the house of mirrors we call school; but if these three don't waken your suspicions, then the rest wouldn't either. Incident at Nuremberg On January 29, 2008, a sixteen-year-old girl, Melissa Busekros, liv- ing in Nuremberg, Germany, was forcibly removed from her home by fifteen policemen and assorted city officials and placed under psychi- atric investigation. Her crime: homeschooling. When I heard of the incident, I wrote the German ambassador in Washington to register my disgust: Dear Mr. Ambassador: Homeschooling in Germany was legal until 1937 when it was sud- denly banned by the Nazi government. I'm writing to enquire why Hitler's ban is still being enforced 72 years later? In whose interests is this proscription kept? For what specific purposes? You will be aware, I know, that between 2V2 and 3 million Americans are currently being homeschooled. One of them, travelling through Germany, recently informed me of the Melissa Busekros affair and asked my help in un- derstanding the matter. Hence this letter. Your court ordered social work authorities to apprehend Melissa in forceful language which I shall quote: \"The Jugend~mt is hereby in- structed and authorized to bring the child - if necessary by force - to a hearing. Police support may be obtained for this purpose:' A number of details bother me about this court order. In the first place nothing in Melissa's history would suggest that police interven- tion was necessary. A simple letter commanding the attendance of the family at a hearing would have been obeyed.

Some famous Germans have at- tributed your nation's sickening record to attitudes enshrined in your treatment of the young. Erich Remarque, author of All Quiet on the Western Front, tracked the causes ofWWI directly to German school- masters and their lies, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the famous Protestant theologian executed by Hitler, pronounced WWII the \"inevitable\" product of German schooling. German war-lovers like Martin Luther, Frederick the Great, Otto von Bismarck, and Adolf Hitler, are, I think, red herrings - transient phenomena which mask what actually has taken place in your part of the world since the Old Norse Religion: an obsession with system, a search for The Master Formula. In systems logic, concepts like liberty and individual rights are direct attacks on the integrity of systems. Fichte saw that no efficient national manage- ment was possible as long as the ordinary population regarded itself as sovereign individuals possessing free will and imagination; therefore he demanded compulsory schooling aimed at removing these things. In the short run this form of mind control works to convert your ordinary population into a very manageable mass. It certainly has given the Germans the reputation they enjoy worldwide as depend- able automatons. But in the long run it cripples your economic pros- pects. Think only of the recent debacle with ThyssenKrupp dumping its Phoenix Steel plant on \"gullible\" China. Chinese peasants moved the plant in one-third the time your engineers estimated and Phoe- nix has been a money-maker for China ever since, while rule-bound Krupp through its bad judgement has taken employment away from 10,000 German breadwinners.

As a bureaucrat, what could he say? Incident at Highland High On March 5, 2004, I drove to Highland High School in prosper- ous Rockland County north of New York City at the invitation of a school board member, John Jankiewicz. Mr. J. was a total stranger until he made the offer to speak, but his letter of enquiry intrigued me. He was concerned that the Germanicized schooling at High- land, built around the principles of behavioral psychology as almost all American schooling is, was hurting future prospects for Highland graduates. It bothered him. John was himself an impressively edu- cated man with creative talent as a hydraulic engineer which earned him a global reputation for the projects he had designed around the world. I looked forward to meeting him, but not to speaking before ju- niors and seniors at a rich exurban high school, because I knew from past experience how hard it is to talk to self-satisfied teenagers. When I got to the school early to size up the place, my suspicions were confirmed. Its parking lot was filled with high-end student ve- hicles and the general demeanor among the kids I saw was one of self- satisfaction. It reminded me of the Crystal Springs Upland School, a wealthy private school in coastal California whose claim to notoriety was its former student, Patty Hearst. When I went there to speak, I heard a student say that the faculty cars were so low-class that even his gardener drove a better one. But at both places students paid a very high price for enrollment in the club; their arrogance masked a mediocre command of intel- lectual skills and they were being steeped like tea bags in a climate of non-stop dishonesty about college preparation, about the decisive ef- fect that grade averages and standardized tests scores would suppos- edly have on their future. The unspeakable prospect of not being accepted at a prestige col- lege or even not being accepted at all was the ground upon which academic studies were constructed.

That was of central interest. That life had recently been demonstrated to be possible in fantastic variety in the total absence of light and photosynthesis, by a mixture of chemicals and heat alone, might have been of interest to a geek, but it had nothing to offer the future managers of geeks. Among the many secrets withheld from the students at Highland (or Crystal Springs) was the fact that colleges were businesses before they were anything else, businesses desperate for warm bodies in or- der to meet payrolls. They had little to worry about in finding a place which would gladly exchange its degree for a bag of money, and while elite college admission couldn't be guaranteed because the number of applicants always exceeded the number of seats, \"c\" students like Al Gore, John Kennedy, John Kerry, George Bush, John McCain (who finished 895th out of 900 graduates at Annapolis, and lost five air- planes of which he was a pilot) and Franklin Roosevelt had no diffi- culty being admitted to elite colleges and graduating from them. Since I knew the kids at Highland would be worried about col- lege, I decided to build my talk around the actual situation and criteria for admission - not around the fantasy schooling uses to maintain discipline. I would aim to undermine the foundation of their vague fears - which the school like most schools had exploited to the max- imum. The strategy wasn t to preach, but instead to direct attention to the masses of prominent people, past and present, who had somehow managed to sidestep the big school lie and to make success without it. For instance, you already know the computer industry was built on the vision of dropouts; you know how each of our Nobel Prize cre- ative writers was a dropout; you know that the entertainment indus- try in all its facets is overwhelmingly dominated by dropouts, the fast food industry, too; and how the politicians we entrust national policy to were almost uniformly mediocre students.

I told the kids (quietly, I swear) to have their parents demand that every school employee in their district be required to post their own grade/ test records prominently on their doors and that this would cause the whole sorry house of mirrors to shatter like Humpty Dumpty. Once these seeds were planted, all subject to easy verification, . they would grow on their own; in these minds closed tightly as clams by prosperity and the climate of fear I believed Highland was retail- ing as a crowd control device, this mass of anomalous data would act as a strong acid burning minds open. The most effective single body of information I transmitted was about the admission policies at Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Princeton, and similar prestigious places, places, which reject huge numbers of valedictorians, perfect GPA averagers, and perfect SAT scores ev- ery year in favor of applicants with \"a record of distinction\" (as Har- vard admissions director Marlyn McGrath was quoted as saying a few years ago). Have you started a successful business? Have you founded a charity? Have you sailed around the world alone, walked from Tierra del Fuego to Point Barrow, Alaska without professional help; can you take a tractor down to its component parts and reas- semble it all by yourself ... ? Can teenagers do these things? Of course they can. High school dropout Richard Branson, who you heard about in \"Walkabout: Lon- don;' is shown in my daily newspaper this morning (July 29, 2008) cracking a bottle of champagne over the nose of the spaceship he just completed to carry tourists into space at some $200,000 a seat (more than 250 have paid so far).

At this point I need you to visualize the style of this talk, for rea- sons which will be clear in a little while. At no point in my delivery was I excitable, histrionic, condemnatory, or anything other than per- fectly calm and even-voiced. Each fact I laid out was referenced from some mainstream information source capable of being checked for verification. And then it happened. Suddenly a police detail threw the doors of the auditorium open with a loud noise and invaded the room! The officer in charge shouted through a bullhorn, \"This assembly is over! Leave the auditorium at once! Return to class! Remain calm! Follow your teachers! Leave the room at once!\" It was easily the strangest moment of my life. Nobody in the room wasn't calm, except the police! The officer in charge shouted through a bullhorn: \"This assem- bly is over! Leave the auditorium at once!\" and saying that, he walked double-time to where I stood at the front of the auditorium, fixed my eye the way a red-tailed hawk regards a sparrow. He snapped, \"Leave the room at once. This lecture is over!\" I had no doubt I would be ar- rested if I failed to comply. Had the school received a bomb threat:' No. I was the bomb. As I left the building, Jankiewicz caught up with me to report that McCar- thy, the superintendent, found my talk so inflammatory he called the police to stop it. Think about that. My voice had never raised above a conversational tone. I used no bad language. I hadn't mooned the au- dience or exposed myself. It's true that Highland didn't require the degree of overkill Nuremberg used to shut Melissa Busekros down, there were only three cops sent to shut me up, but the principle ~ I hope you can see - was no different. Nor was this the end. I had been scheduled to speak to parents that evening at the school.

The room had been paid for, the students would have been long gone, only adults would be in atten- dance, but none of that made a difference. No one in Highland, New York, was to be allowed to hear facts which you've read in this book. Three days afterward, on April 7, 2004, The Mid-Hudson High- land Post, a newspaper out of Poughkeepsie just across the Hudson from Highland, reported the story - at least part of it. The news account was titled: \"Rendered Speechless - Advocate for Reform Brings Controversy\" Not a word about the police incursion was in the story, but apart from that it added several illuminating details I would otherwise not have known. Superintendent McCarthy was identified as the individual who had stopped the lecture, for instance. But the dispatch of a unit that size for a small town must have been no small matter. It seemed to demand an answer to why the building principal (who must have reported the \"emergency\" I represented by telephone to the district of- fice) hadn't simply come discreetly to the microphone and told me to wrap things up quickly, perhaps saying \"something has come up:' Or why, if he lacked the presence of mind to do that, the superintendent hadn't requested he do so before recourse to the police was consid- ered? And finally, why the Highland police dispatcher hadn't sent one officer, rather than three? Was the assumption that anyone so crazed as to bring objective data to high school students must be on drugs, and would pose a danger if a show of force wasn't made? The newspaper story contained the superintendent's justification for his action as my screening a violent film for student consump- tion. Sine the film in question had been shown nationally on PBS and on the Discovery Channel, it hardly seems likely this was the actual motive, and what gave the lie away more than anything to the super- intendent's explanation was the cancellation of the evening parents meeting.

Since I'm about to cast the idyllic state of Vermont as a villain in this third unbelievable story, I need to tell you first that every encoun- ter I've ever had with this state - before I came to Walden - was an absolute joy. Let me illustrate with my favorite state capitol expe- rience ever, and I've visited them all. One day in 1990, I was called to speak in Montpelier, Vermont, at the college, while I was still New York Teacher of the Year. Arriving in that grand little city a day early, I decided to walk to the capitol building and poke around to kill some time. The atmosphere inside the handsome structure was so laid back and low key, I decided to go to the governor's office and leave a note of thanks for him with the secretary, thanks to his stewardship of this uniquely personalized state. The door was open so I walked in. No secretary was around. I waited five minutes and still no secretary, so I knocked gingerly on the governor's door, once, twice, and then the door opened. Peering in I could clearly see - no governor. Since there was no guard in the cor- ridor outside either to ask permission of, I decided to leave a note in the middle of the governor's desk and leave, but when I leaned over to do that some impish Pittsburgh Scotch-Irish spirit whispered in my ear, \"Why not sit in his chair behind his desk and see what it feels like to be governor ofVermontt And so I did. A minute or two passed before my better half asked me what I would say if the governor walked in? Would I tell him that I'd be with him in a minute?

A concrete block \"regional\" school was to be built in their place and kids bused to it from up to fifty miles away. Everyone associated with the schools was in shock. This mea- sure had been voted down several times in past years, but this time the state was baring its teeth. If the proposal was voted down again, the state would cut off funds to the town for school aid, and use its right of eminent domain to tear them down anyway. As soon as I got to the home of the family hosting me, I asked to see the government proposal. You wouldn't have needed to be a law- yer or an accountant to see that the estimates for construction on the four schools were wildly out of line - a quarter million dollars, I re- call, when 25 thousand would have been overkill. Fortunately (or so I thought) I knew a famous architect who taught at the University of Vermont, and I told my hosts I would ask him to testify against the accuracy of the state estimate. And so I called. Some hours later he was with us, reading the relevant papers. \"These estimates are ten times higher than actual costs would be;' he said emphatically. He told us it was a common trick employed by local governments when a decision had already been made, contracts already quietly pledged - he knew the firm which had been given assurances it would be build- ing the replacement schooL But he declined to testify. \"Why not, for pity's sake?\" I asked him \" If I did, I'd never get another job in the state of Vermont, that's why;' he answered.

We lose touch with the rituals of testing because, upon entering adult life, we inevitably discover that the information these glorified jig- saw puzzles generates is unreliable, and very misleading - absolutely nobody ever asks after the data. We see that those who test well are more often circus dogs than leaders of the future. Nothing inside the little red schoolhouse does more personal and social damage than the numbers and rank order these tests hang around the necks of the young. Although the scores correlate with absolutely nothing of real value, the harm they cause is real enough: such assessments are a crowning glory of the social engineers who seized final control of institutional schooling during the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt. They constitute a matchless weapon of social control, wreaking havoc on winners and losers alike. Standardized testing is the tail wagging the entire monster of forced institutional schooling. The frequent ceremonies of useless testing - preparation, ad- ministration, recovery - convert forced schooling into a travesty of what education should be; they drain hundreds of millions of days yearly from what might otherwise be productive pursuits; they di- vert tens of billions of cash resources into private pockets. The net effect of standardized testing is to reduce our national wealth in fu- ture generations, by suffocating imagination and intellect, while en- hancing wealth for a few in the present. This occurs as a byproduct of \"scientifically\" ranking the tested so they can be, supposedly, classi- fied efficiently as human resources.

I'll briefly mount a case why such a project is needed and then in- troduce you to its spiritual godfather, Bartleby the Scrivener. On May 8, 2008, the New York Sun reported that despite legal man- dates which require physical education be offered every school day, only one kid out of every twenty-five received even the legal minimum of 24 minutes a day. The New York City comptroller Was quoted by the Sun, saying that physical training was a major concern of parents. But then, parents have had no significant voice in school for over a century. The story gets even darker than you realize. 1 Many test creators are fully aware of radical shortcomings in the tests they devise, and aware as well of severe political misuse of their assessment creations. Still, they continue to serve the testing regime for the personal benefits gained. For a recent example of this, see test expert Daniel Koretis book, Measuring Up (Harvard Uni- versity Press, 2008), in which the damage tests cause is someone else's responsibility, not Dr. Koretz's; to be deplored, of course between paychecks. Should these people be held responsible for long-term consequences of their work - \"generating a feel- ing of inferiority ... that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone;' to borrow Justice Warrens language from the Brown case?"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION Quietly, over the past decade, a national epidemic of obesity and diabetes has appeared in children as young as five. The connections between food, lack of exercise, and these twin plagues have been rec- ognized for a long time. Diabetes is the principal cause of blindness and amputations in the US, and obesity is the leading cause of heart disease and self-loathing. That the non-fat are revolted by the fat, and discriminate heavily against them should not be a mystery, even to the stupid. Fat kids are punished cruelly in classrooms and on the play- ground. In the face of these sobering facts, that thousands of schools still serve familiar fast food - and also non-proprietary fatty foods like liverwurst and bologna as nutrition - should have already caused you to realize that school is literally a risk to the mental and physical health of the young. Coupled with the curious legal tradition which makes serious lawsuits against school-generated human damage im- possible, I hope you will try to convince yourself that behind the daily noise and squalor, a game is afoot in this institution which has little to do with popular myth. Standardizing minds is a big part of that game. In the news story cited, a representative of New York City's Board of Education declares, \"Were beginning to realize student health is a real core subject area:' Think about that. The city has had a hundred- year near-monopoly over children's daily lives and it's only beginning to realize that health is important? Where is evidence of that realiza- tion? Don't all schools still demand physical confinement in chairs as a necessary concomitant oflearning?l 1 The issue of school immobility is more complicated than physical health alone. As a former college admissions researcher, Mitchell Stevens, writes in Creating a Class: College Admissions and the Education of Elites (Harvard University Press, 2007), at elite colleges \"the physical appearance of human bodies\" matters as much as grades. Bodies are visible embodiments of social class, he tells us. Desirable applicants look good, in plain language. Physically impressive applicants are strongly preferred - although the group made soft and doughy by rwelve years spent fixed in seats and eating a diet rich in fats are not let into the secret by official schooling. Ignoring this powerful reality which blankets every corner of after-graduation reality is a most punishing weapon."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Afterword 197 When lack of exercise has clearly been fingered as a main road to diabetes and obesity, and both conditions are well-understood to lead to blindness, amputations, heart disease, and self-hatred, how can law only provide 24 minutes of exercise a day, and be so poorly enforced that only one in twenty-five gets even that? Doesn't that tell you something essential about the managers of schooling? At the very least, that 96 percent of all schools in New York City break the law with impunity in a matter threatening the health of students. What makes it even more ominous is that school officials are known far and wide for lacking independent judgment and courage in the face of bureaucratic superiors; but something in this particular mat- ter must give them confidence that they won't be held personally liable. You must face the fact that an outlaw ethic runs throughout in- stitutional schooling. It's well-hidden inside ugly buildings, masked by dull people, mindless drills, and the boring nature of almost every- thing associated with schools, but make no mistake - under orders from somewhere, this institution is perfectly capable of lying about life-and-death matters, so how much more readily about standard- ized testing? If the bizarre agenda of official schooling allows its representa- tives to tell the press that after a hundred years they're beginning to learn what Plato and Aristotle wrote eloquently about thousands of years ago, and that privileged sanctuaries like Eton, Harrow, Groton, and St. Pauls have practiced since their inception, that physical health depends upon movement, you should be reluctant to assign credibil- ity to any school declaration. Under the right pressure from some- where, schools can easily be brought to act against the best interests of students or faculty. This is what has happened with standardized testing, post- WWII. Some teachers know, and most all teachers feel in their bones, that the testing rituals cause damage. But human nature being what it is, only a few dare resist, and these are always eventually discovered and punished."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION I began my own schooling in 1940 in the gritty industrial sec- tion of Pittsburgh ironically named \"Swiss-vale;' continued it for the most part in the equally gritty industrial exurb, Monongahela, dur- ing WWII and its aftermath, and concluded my time, served forcibly, in the green hills of western Pennsylvania, very near where Colonel Washington's late-night killing of French officer Jumonville precipi- tated the French and Indian War (Washington didn't do the killing himsel£ but he took the heat). As compensation for confinement, schools in those days were generally places of visible morality, powerfully egalitarian, and often strongly intellectual under the rough manners of the classroom. Fac- ulties were always local, which meant among other things that each school employee had a local reputation as a neighbor and citizen; they existed as people as well as abstract functions. Curriculum pre- pared far away, and standardized testing, was hardly in evidence even at the end of the school sequence for me, in the 1950S. Each classroom at my high school, Uniontown High, was personalized to a degree which would be considered dangerously eccentric today, and hardly tolerable. And yet, boys and girls schooled that way had just finished ruin- ing the tightly schooled dictatorships of the planet. We boasted of- ten to ourselves, teenagers of the 1940S and 1950S, that unlike those unfortunate enough to live outside the US, we carried no identifica- tion papers, feared no secret police. Compared to the exotic liberty of those days of my boyhood, American society of sixty years later smacks a bit too much of a police state for comfort. To imagine old ladies being patted down for explosives at airports, or the IRS inva- sion of one's home, or the constant test rankings and dossiers of be- havior managed through schooling; to imagine machinery purchased for home use spying on intimate choices and reporting those choices to strangers, would have been inconceivable in 1950. A river of prosperity was lifting all boats in the US as I finished my own public schooling in 1953.

Schooling was considered impor- tant in those days, but never as very important. Too many unschooled people like my father and mother carried important responsibilities too well for pedagogical propaganda to end the reign of America's egalitarian ethic. The downward spiral in school quality began in the 1950S with changes which went unnoticed. Schools were \"rationalized\" after the German fashion; increment by increment they were standardized from coast to coast. By 1963, standardized tests were a fixture, although very few extended them any credibility; they were thought of as a curious break from classroom routine, a break imposed for what reason no- body knew, or cared. Even in the 1950S, curriculum was being dumbed down, though not to the levels reached in later years. Teachers were increasingly carpet-baggers, from somewhere outside the community in which they taught. Once it had actually been a legal requirement to live within the political boundaries of the school district, just as it was for police, fire fighters, and other civil servants, but gradually families came to be seen as potential enemies of the \"professional\" staff; better to live far enough away they could be kept at arm's length. Morality in schools was replaced with cold-blooded pragmatism. As Graham Greene has his police chief say; in Our Man in Havana. \"We only torture people who expect to be tortured:' Ghetto kids were flunked and nearly flunked because that was their expectation; middle-class/ upper-middle-class kids were given Cs. Bs and even As. because they and their parents wouldn't tolerate anything else. School order came to depend upon maintaining good relations with the toughest bullies. covertly affirming their right to prey upon whiners and cry-babies (though never cry-babies from politically po- tent families). The intellectual dimension was removed from almost all classrooms as a matter of unwritten policy. and since test scores are independent of intellect, those teachers who tried to hold onto men- tal development as a goal, rather than rote memorization, actually"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"200 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION penalized their students and themselves where test scores were the standard of accomplishment. Horace Manns ideal of common schooling was put to death af- ter WWII; students were sharply divided from one another in rigid class divisions justified by standardized testing. Separation into win- ners and losers became the ruling dynamic. By 1973, schools were big business. In small towns and cities across the land schoolteaching was now a lucrative occupation - with short hours, long vacations, paid medical care, and safe pensions; adminis- trators earned the equivalent of local doctors, lawyers, and judges. Eccentricity in classrooms was steeply on the wane, persecuted wherever it survived. T racki~g was the order of the day, students be- ing steered into narrower and narrower classifications supposedly based on standardized test scores. PlentifUl exceptions existed, how- ever, in the highest classifications of \"gifted and talented;' to accom- modate the children of parents who might otherwise have disrupted the smooth operation of the bureaucracy. But even in these top classifications, the curriculum was pro- foundly diminished from standards of the past. What was asked of prosperous children in the 1970S would have been standard for chil- dren of coal miners and steel workers in the 1940S and 1950S. Many theories abound for why this was so, but only one rings true to me: From WWII onwards it is extremely easy to trace the spread of a general belief in the upper realms of management and academy that most of the population was incurably feeble-minded, permanently stuck at a mental level of twelve or under. Since efforts to change this were doomed to be fUtile, why undergo the expense of trying? Or to put a humane cast on the argument, which I once heard a junior high school principal expound at a public school board meeting: Why worry kids and parents with the stress of trying to do something they are biologically unable to achieve? This was precisely the outlook Abraham Lincoln had ridiculed in 1859 (see Richard Hofstadter's Anti-Intellectualism in American Life); precisely the outlook of Edward Thorndike, inventor of \"educational"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Afterword 201 psychology\" at Columbia Teachers College; precisely the outlook of H. H. Goddard, chairman of the psychology department at Prince- ton; precisely the outlook of James Bryant Conant, president of Har- vard; precisely the outlook of great private corporate foundations like Rockefeller and Carnegie; precisely the outlook of Charles Dar- win and his first cousin, Francis Galton. You can find this point of view active in Plato, in John Calvin, in Benedict (Baruch) Spinoza, in Johann Fichte, and in so many other places it would take a long book to do justice to them. As long as ordinary Americans like Ben Franklin's dad were in charge of educating their young, America escaped domination from the deadly assumptions of permanent inferiority - whether spiri- tual, intellectual, or biological - which provide the foundation for rigid social classes, by justifying them. As long as .the crazy quilt of libertarian impulses found in the American bazaar prevailed, a period which takes us to the Civil War, America was a place of miracles for ordinary people through self-education. To a fractional degree it still is, thanks to tradition owing nothing to post-WWII government ac- tion; but only for those lucky enough to have families which dismiss the assumptions of forced schooling - and hence avoid damage by the weapons of mass instruction. As the German Method, intended to convert independent Bar- tleby spirits into human resources, choked off easy escape routes, it wasn't only children who were hurt, but our national prospects. Our founding documents endowed common Americans with rights no government action could alienate, liberty foremost among them. The very label \"school\" makes a mockery of these rights. We are a worse nation for this radical betrayal visited upon us by generations of po- litical managers masquerading as leaders. And we are a materially poorer nation, as well. School's structure and algorithms constitute an engine like the little mill that ground salt in the famous fable - long ago it slipped away from anyone's conscious control. It is immune to reform. That's why it must be destroyed. But how?"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"202 WEAPONS OF MASS INSTRUCTION We will start at the weakest link in the German school chain, the standardized tests which are despised by everyone, school personnel included. The recent past has given us two astonishing accomplish- ments of citizen action - no, make that three - which should lift your spirits as you prepare to ruin the testing empire - instances of impregnable social fortresses blown to pieces by disorganized, un- budgeted decisions of ordinary people. Call these examples \"Bartleby Moments:' Think of the ending of the Vietnam War, when young people filled the streets; think of the tearing down of the Berlin Wall; think of the swift dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Bartleby Project By the end of WWII, schooling had replaced education in the US, and shortly afterwards, standardized testing became the steel band holding the entire enterprise together. Test scores rather than accom- plishment became the mark of excellence as early as 1960, and step by step the public was brought, through various forms of coercion in- cluding journalism , to believe that marks on a piece of paper were a fair and accurate proxy for human quality. As Alexander Solzhenit- syn, the Nobel Prize winning Russian author, said, in a Pravda article on September 18, 1988, entitled\"How to Revitalize Russia: \" No road for the people [to recover from Communism] will ever be open unless the government completely gives up con- trol over us or any aspect of our lives. It has led the country into an abyss and it does not know the way out. Break the grip of official testing on students, parents and teachers, and we will have taken the logical first step in revitalizing education. But nobody should believe this step can be taken politically - too much money and power is involved to allow the necessary legislative action; the dynamics of our society tend toward the creation of public opin- ion, not any response to it. There is only one major exception to that rule: Taking to the streets. In the past half-century the US has wit- nessed successful citizen action many times: In the overthrow of the"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Afterword 203 Jim Crow laws and attitudes; in the violent conclusion to the military action in Vietnam; in the dismissal of a sitting American president from office. In each of these instances the people led, and the gov- ernment reluctantly followed. So it will be with standardized testing. The key to its elimination is buried inside a maddening short story published in 1853 by Herman Melville: \"Bartleby the Scrivener:' I first encountered \"Bartleby\" as a senior at Uniontown High School, where I was unable to understand what it might possibly sig- nify. As a freshman at Cornell I read it again, surrounded by friendly associates doing the same. None of us could figure out what the story meant to communicate, not even the class instructor. Bartleby is a human photocopy machine in the days before electro- mechanical duplication, a low-paid, low-status position in law offices and businesses. One day, without warning or explanation, Bartleby begins to exercise free will - he decides which orders he will obey and which he will not. If not, he replies, \"I would prefer not to:' To an order to participate in a team-proofreading of a copy he's just made, he announces without dramatics, \"I would prefer not to:' To an order to pop around the corner to pick up mail at the post office, the same: \"I would prefer not to:' He offers no emotion, no enlargement on any refusal; he prefers not to explain himsel£ Otherwise, he works hard at copying. That is, until one day he prefers not to do that, either. Ever again. Bartleby is done with copying. But not done with the office which employed him to copy! You see, without the boss' knowledge, he lives in the office, sleeping in it after others go home. He has no income sufficient for lodging. When asked to leave that office, and given what amounts to a generous severance pay for that age, he prefers not to leave - and not to take the severance. Eventually, Bartleby is taken to jail, where he prefers not to eat. In time, he sickens from starvation, and is buried in a pauper's grave. The simple exercise of free will, without any hysterics, denuncia- tions, or bombast, throws consternation into social machinery - free will contradicts the management principle. Refusing to allow yourself"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"204 WEAPONS OF MASS . INSTRUCTION to be regarded as a \"human resource\" is more revolutionary than any revolution on record. After years of struggling with Bartleby, he finally taught me how to break the chains of German Method schooling. It took a half-century for me to understand the awesome instrument each of us has through free will to defeat Germanic schooling, and to destroy the adhesive which holds it together - standardized testing. Signposts pointing our attention toward the Bartleby power within us are more common than we realize in the global imagina- tion, as Joseph Campbell's splendid works on myth richly demon- strate (as do both Testaments of the Bible), but we needn't reach back very far to discover Thoreau's cornerstone essay on civil disobedience as a living spring in the American imagination, or Gandhi's spectac- ular defeat of the British Empire through \"passive resistance\" as bold evidence that as Graham Greene should have taught us by now, \"they\" would prefer to torture those who expect to be tortured. Mass abstract testing, anonymously scored, is the torture centri- fuge whirling away precious resources of time and money from pro- ductive use and routing it into the hands of testing magicians. It happens only because the tormented allow it. Here is the divide-and- conquer mechanism par excellence, the wizard-wand which estab- lishes a bogus rank order among the schooled, inflicts prodigies of stress upon the unwary, causes suicides, family breakups, and grossly perverts the learning process - while producing no information of any genuine worth. Testing can't predict who will become the best surgeon, college professor, or taxicab driver; it predicts nothing which would impel any sane human being to enquire after these scores. Standardized testing is very good evidence our national leadership is bankrupt and has been so for a very long time. The two-party system has been unable to give us reliable leadership, its system of campaign finance almost guarantees we get managers, not leaders; I think Ralph Nader has correctly identified it as a single party with two heads - itself bankrupt. I don't know what to do about that, but I do know how to bring the testing empire to an end, to rip out its heart and make its inven-"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Afterword 205 tors, proponents, and practitioners into pariahs whose political allies will abandon them. Let a group of young men and women, one fully aware that these tests add no value to individual lives or the social life of the m~or­ iry, use the power of the Internet to recruit other young people to re- fuse, quietly, to take these tests. No demonstrations, no mud-slinging, no adversarial politics - to simply write across the face of the tests placed in front of them, \"I would prefer not to take this test:' Let no hierarchy of anti-test management form; many should advise the project, but nobody should wrap themselves in the mantle of leader- ship. The best execution would not be uniform, but would take doz~ ens of different shapes around the country. Like the Congregational Church, there should be no attempt to organize national meetings, al- though national chatrooms, blogs, and mission-enhancing advisors of all political and philosophical stripes will be welcome. To the extent this project stays unorganized, it cannot help but succeed; to the ex- tent \"expert\" leadership pre-empts it, it can be counted on to corrupt itsel£ Think Linux, not Microsoft. Everyone who signs on should get an equal credit, latecomers as well as pioneers. Unto this last should be the watchword. I prefer not to. Let the statement be heard, at first erratically and then in an irresistible tide, in classrooms across the country. If only one in ten prefer not to, the press will scent an evergreen story and pick up the trail; the group preferring not to will grow like the snow- ball anticipating the avalanche. What of the ferocious campaign of intimidation which will be waged against the refuseniks:' Retribution will be threatened, scape- goats will be targeted for public humiliation. Trust me, think Alice in Wonderland; the opposition will be a house of cards, the retribution an illusion. Will the refusers be denied admission to colleges:' Don't be naive. College is a business before it's anything else; already a busi- ness starving for customers.

The Bartleby Project should allow no compromise. That will be the second line of defense for management, a standard trick taught in political science seminars. Don't fall for it. Reject compromise. No need to explain why. No need to shout. May the spirit of the scrivener put steel in your backbone. Just say: I would prefer not to take your test. An old mans prayers will be with you.

It was presented in a formal talk to an audience from the Harvard Grad- uate School of Education, and then as a statement made to a panel of testing authorities at the Kennedy School of Government. 1 You'll be in good company. On May 27 , 2008, Smith College, the legendary wom- en's college in Northampton, Massachusetts, announced it would no longer require applicants for admission to submit SAT scores. It had become dubious of the valid- ity of standardized tests in predicting success. In future at Smith, the most impor- tant criteria for admission will be writing ability, evidence of character and talent, significant extracurricular accomplishment.
