[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Freemasonry is often described as a \"secret society,\" but Freemasons themselves believe it is more correct to say that it is an esoteric society, in that certain aspects are private. The most common phrasing being that Freemasonry has, in the 21st century, be come less a secret society and more of a \"society with secrets.\" The priv ate aspects of modern Freemasonry are the modes of recognition amongst members and particular elements within the ritual. For instance Masons might as k newcomers they meet \"are you on the square?\" In an open society such as the United States, one is left to wonder why the need for secrecy? The task of describing Freemasonry is a daunting one. Saying that it is the largest fraternal organization in the world with over 3 million members in the United States and seven hundred thousand in Great Britain and a million more around the Farth, and that it has been the study of fifty thousand books and pamphlets is only the beginning. Since it was revealed in 1717, Freemasonry has engendered more hatred and enmity than any other secular organization in the world. It has been constantly subjected to unremitting attack by the Catholic Church, its membership forbidden to men of the Mormon Church, the Salvation Army and the Methodist Church. It is outlawed in a number of countries. Anti Masonic allegations always run into difficulties because Masonry refuses to respond to attacks. What is surprising is the very large number of world leaders, past and present who were and are members of Freemasonry: King George VI of England, Frederick the Great of Prussia and King Haakon VII of Norway. U.S. history is replete with leaders who were Masons such as George Washington, Andrew Jackson, James Polk, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. WWII was fought by British Masonic leaders such as Winston Churchill and the American President Franklin D. R oosevelt, and American army leaders like Generals Omar Bradley, Mark Clark and George Marshall. It is virtually impossible to know where to begin or to end in recounting Masonic influence on every aspect of life for the past 290 years.

The study of Freemasonry is an inexhaustible one, and many books and learned papers have be en written and presented in regard to the subject; therefore it is not my intention to go into the highways and byways of Masonry and get lost down side lanes and tracks in a maze of r ituals and symbols, which have mostly been covered in any case by those who are for, and those who are opposed to Masonry. The purpose of my message is to give you a broader insight into what Masonry is, what it stands for, what its aims and objectives are, and how far it has progressed toward its stated goals. For this reason, I shall be dealing first with speculative Masonry, that part of Masonry dealing wi th spiritual matters of life and death and the human spirit, and who controls with a brief explanation of craft Masonry. For details of rituals and cerem onies, I have drawn on such Masonry reference works as Royal Masonic Encyclopedia, or as it is sometimes called Cyclopedia. For an account of where the greatest pro-Masonry advocates have spelled out their ideas, including Albert Pike and Dr. M ackey, as well as in books and journals written by staunch enemies of Masonry; men like Abbe Barruel, Professor John Robinson, Eckert, Copin-Albinecelli and Arthur Preuss, to name but a few learned men who are named by Masons as \"our implacable enemies.\" (Strange that the Jesuits should use th e exact same phrase.) The origins of Freemasonry have been argued over for more than 150 years. According to Pike: 7"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman . . . The origins of Freemasonry are known only to Freemasons. Pike indulges in wishful thinking here. His claim is intended to deceive the unwary and it is rather typical of the deception which Masonry practices, something like falling into the hands of a magician and not knowing how he performs his illusions. The origin of Freemasonry is, however, very well known; it is no secret, no mystery. But it is also certainly true that the majority of Masons, who never rise above the 4 th Degree, do not know the origin of the society whose dictates they so slavishly follow. Dr. Mackey, recognized as a Mason's Mason, the spokesman for Masonry, admits this. Its chief defender, J.F. Gould, confirms that much disagreement exists among Masons themselves as to its origin. This is to be f ound in his work, The History of Freemasonry. Contemporary research shows its origin is found in Babylonian and Egyptian mysticism, coupled with Black Magic. It is a religious cult, dedicated to the worship of Lucifer. It is anti-Christian and revolutionary in character, even as its master, Lucifer is the symbol of rebellion against God, a rebellion, which has continued for thousands of years. The world owes its knowledge of Freemasonry to Professor John Robinson, one of its mo st illustrious members who defected from its ranks, and thus a man whom the Masons cannot call a liar or confound. Professor Robinson taught at the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Scotland. His subject: Human Philosophy. Robinson was deeply involved in secret societies, the principal one being the Bavarian Illuminati sect of Adam Weishaupt. 8"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z Robinson was a 33 rd Degree Mason; that is to say, he had reached the top of the tree in the Order of the Scottish Rite Freemasons. In 1796, Robinson published a paper, which set out the aims of the Illuminati, proving that the Illuminati closely paralleled Masonry. In fact, Masonry was the vehicle used to spread revolutionary Illuminati doctrines, starting in France. Robinson proved beyond dispute that the aim of the Illuminati and Masonry is to destroy all religions and governments and to eliminate Christianity from the f ace of the Earth and replace it with Luciferian worship. The New World Order promised by Freemasonry is a despotic, Luciferian One-World Order in side a One-World Government. A complete set of blueprints for the coming revolution fell into the hands of the Bavarian government, who were deeply alarmed, so much so that it sent copies to every government and head of state in Europe, only to have its message of warning completely ignored. The Weishaupt documents gave full details of the coming French Revolution. Masonic Or der devotee, the Earl of Shelburne, taught and trained both Danton and Marat (the radical leaders of the French Revolution) and directed every phase of the \"French\" Revolution from England. 9"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman CHAPTER 2 ORIGINS OF MASONRY Babylonian Gnosticism is the mother of Freemasonry, which is why the letter \"G\" figures in the center of Masonry's five- pointed star. In spite of furious denials by the defenders of Masonry, no lesser an authority on Masonry, from its highest Order, Eliphas Levy said the \"G\" signifies Gnosticism. In his work, Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie, volume II, page 97, Levy says: The \"G,\" which Freemasons pl ace in the middle of the flamboyant star, signifies G nosticism and Generation, the most sacred words of the ancient Kabala. The Kabala is ancient Jewish mysticism, according to the Encyclopedia of Religions, and Br other Edersham, an authority on the Kabala. Now, I do not want to go into the byways, as I stated before, but it is necessary to very briefly establish what the Kabala is. To this end, I quote the authority, Brother Edersham: It is undeniable, that already at the time of Jesus Christ, there was in existence an assemblage of doctrines and speculations that were carefully concealed from the multitude. They were not even revealed to the ordinary scholars (just as in the case of higher doctrines and ordinary Masons) for fear of leading them towards heretical ideas. 10"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z This kind bore the name Kabbala as the term indicates (i.e. to receive and to transmit) it represented the spiritual transitions transmitted from the earliest ages, although mingled in the course of ti me, with impure or foreign elements. This is the very same Tradition of the Elders, which Jesus Christ utterly condemned in very strong language as recorded in the Four Gospels, the record of Hi s spoken words during His earthly ministry. It becomes clear from the foregoi ng, that Masonry evolved from a religion utterl y opposed to the minist ry of Christ, thus it follows that in spite of its vehement denials, that Masonry is anti- Christian in teaching and in spir it. Others implacably opposed to Masonry, as mentioned earlier, go even further. An absolute supreme authority on Masonry, Copin-Albancelli, said: Freemasonry is the counter-church, the counter-Catholicism, the church of heresy. He quotes several notable Maso nic sources to back up his contention such as Copin-Albancellis, Bulletin of the Grand Orient of France, Septem ber 1885, as declaring: We Masons must pursue the Catholic Churches utter demolition. I was privileged to be able to research documents on Masonry in the British Museum in London to see whether this statement and others which follow herein, have ever been withdrawn or retracted. But over a period of five years of intensive search, I was unable to discover any Maso nic publication containing a retraction of its destructive intentions toward the Catholic Church. 11"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Yet another example cited by Copin-Albancelli is the memorandum of the Supreme Council of the Grand Orient (European Masonry), which states: The struggle being waged between Catholicism and Masonry is a war to the death without truce, without quarter. This statement has never been retracted. Copin-Albencelli goes on to give further examples, quoting as his source the address given at a summer solstice banquet in 1902 by Brother Delpek w ho said, inter-alia: The triumphs of the Galilean has lasted twenty centuries. May the Catholic Church die in its turn . . . The Roman Catholic Church, founded on th e Galilean myth (a reference to Jesus Christ) have begun to decay rapidly, since the founding of the Masonic Association? From the political standpoint Masons have varied frequently. But at all times, Freemasonry has been firm in this principle: War on all superstitions, war on all fanaticisms! The foregoing information, beyond dispute genuine, makes Freemasons and Freemasonry an ti-Christ and anti-Christian, dismissing His teachings in the most disdainful manner possible as a Galilean myth and superstition. Their pent-up hatred and venom is directed mainly toward the Catholic Church, yet there are some who say that Catholics aren't Christians. Believe me; were this to be true, Freemasonry would not be spending 99% of its time and energy in trying to destroy the Catholic Church? Why would Masonry waste such precious time and so much energy? Let us be logi cal about such matters. The above should leave no doubt about where the hierarchy of Masonry stands. It also clearly establishes that Masonry is 12"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z politically involved de spite its frequent pr otestations to the contrary. If we summarize the conclusions to be drawn from the above statements, then we can only arrive at one judgment: Masonry is essentially an untru thful, deceitful and deceiving secret society, in which the bulk of its members are borne along on a tide of banquets, social ge t-togethers, good works, goodwill and philanthropic fellowship. The sinister character of Masonry is completely hidden from the mass of its members, that is to say, those who do not progress beyond the Blue or Fourth Degree. According to the learned Dom Benoit, a superior scholar of Masonry, whom even the Ma sons acknowledge had great knowledge of their secr et speculative oracle s, Masonry is devil worship. Describing initiation ceremonies of the 25 th Degree, (Knight of the Brazen Serpent) in itiates swear to work for the return of man to Eden. The Master mentions the serpent as a friend of man while our God — to whom Masons refer as Adonai or Adonay — is listed as the enemy of man. Benoit says that in the 20 th Degree, the infere nce of Luciferian worship is even more positively stated, because the presiding judge says to the initiate: In the sacred name of Lucifer, cast out obscurantism. Obscurantism is one of the few key words that will make any Mason above the Fourth Degree foam at the mouth, when mentioned in his presence by someone who is not a Mason and therefore, not supposed to know the word and its significance. As I have said before, many Masons who are professing Christians \"once you know these mysteries, can there be any room for doubt, that Masonry is th e adoration of Lucifer and the denigration of Christ.\" 13"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Benoit has a further, more damning indictment against Masonry, which he stated in the following manner: Who is credulous to believe th at after so many serious and constant affirmations, that Masons respect all religions, that the preoccupation with religion and the hatred of the Catholic Church exists only in certain Masonic Degrees, in which they say of Chri st, that He is a fallen angel. I have seen the emblems of one of the Grand Lodges, which is a chalice bearing an image of the host pierced by a dagger, another, the world with the cross upside down, and still another, the Heart of Jesu s with the motto \"Cor Ex Secranrum \" on it. In a discourse of the Luciferian Palladium Rites of Albert Pike for the Elect of the Reformed, Benoit states that the initiates are instructed to \"punish the traito r Jesus Christ, to kill Adonai by stabbing the host after being assured that it is a consecrated host, while reciting horrible blasphemies.\" Pike was born in 1809 and died in 1891. His book, Morals and Dogma, confirms the worship of Satan and his belief in a New World Order. He had disdain for any political system that was a republican limited government w ith democratic principles. Political power, wealth, health and long life were to be gained by the worship of Lucifer, according to Pike. The book talks very much in favor of homosexuality, with the cover showing a double-headed eagle. It is clear that the central theme of the book is to destroy morality and family. The book condemns Biblical morality and th e family, the cornerstone of civilization. Now I know, there are those, even high Masons, who are going to say \". . . we have been Masons all of our lives and have never witnessed such a ceremony.\" Of course not! That is standard 14"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z procedure for Masonry; only the elect are initiated into these rites. If you have not progressed beyond the 25 th Degree, you will not be aware of these vile anti-Christ rituals! And let me warn you, that any attempt to el icit confirmation of Benoit's claim from the Mason hierarchy will mean that your days as a Mason are numbered. You will ther eafter be a marked man, not to be trusted. To quote Brother Stroether, yet another recognized authority, one who has never been challenged by Masonry simply because he was one of their own from their inner councils, a man who used words that have come back to haunt Masons: Masonry exists in France, Spain, Portugal and South America as an anti-religious or ganization, which in the last years has developed into a kind of antithetic sect, which makes no secret of its hatred for revealed religions. Brother Stroether was a member of the elect, a high degree Mason from Louisville, Kentucky in the U.S. I asked a number of high degree Masons to comment on the words of Stroether. Without exception, they either profess ignorance of who Brother Stroether is, or else they deny, th at he said anything of the kind. A particularly outraged Mason, a State Trooper Colonel in North Carolina told me, \"This ki nd of comment is the product of a diseased anti-Mason mind.\" But when I confronted him with the words of his own Masons, he warned me that I would be well advised to leave Masonry alone. The words that had upset him were those uttered by the infamous Paul Lafargue (1842-1911) during the 1866 International Congress of Grand Orient Masons at Brussels, Belgium: War on God! Hatred to God! In the progress it is necessary to crush Heaven, as if it was a piece of paper. 15"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman At the same conference, a notable Mason by the name of Lanesman repeated the words used in 1880, viz: We must crush the infamous one, but that infamous one is not clericalism, that infamous one is God. 16"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z CHAPTER 3 HISTORICAL ENEMIES OF MASONRY I have diligently researched the documents from which these excerpts were taken to confirm their accuracy. Moreover, with equal carefulness, I researched Masonic files in the British Museum in London looking for retraction and or disavowal of these profanities by higher Masons ; but nowhere did my search yield any evidence whatsoever, that these words are not the creed of Masonry in general, nor that they have been withdrawn. A well-respected Masonic leader, who confirmed everything stated thus far, especially the anti-Christ nature of Masonry, was its high priest, Albert Pike, co -founder of the New Palladium Reformed Rites and Supreme Pon tiff of U.S. Masonry. Albert Pike and Edgar Allen Poe had much in common. Both were born in Boston, in 1809. Both were writers and poets and both were opium addicts, as well as being 33 rd degree Masons and Luciferians. In the Catholic Encyclopedia, we read that Albert Pike and another important high-ranking Mason, Adriano Lemmi, conspired together to harm the Christian religion in Italy. Pike wrote Lemmi as follows: It is necessary to ruin in a short time, the clerical influences in Italy, the laws against the religious congregations are to be observed there. And (wha t of) the schools? Catholic instruction is always given in them. Make people protest by means of the lodges. 17"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman In other words, use Masonic lo dges to instigate \"protests\" against the Catholic schools. Professor John Robinson spent ma ny years carefully researching the exposure of Masonry presented by Abbe Barreul. Robinson states: Barreul confirms all that I have said of the Enlightened, whom he very aptly calls Ph ilosohist and the abuses of Freemasonry in France. He shows unquestionably, that a formal and systematic conspiracy against religion was formed and zealously pursued by Voltaire, d'Alembert and Diderot, assisted by Frederick II, King of Prussia, a nd I see, that their principles and their manner of procedure have been the same as those of the German atheists and anarchist. . . But their darling project was to destroy Christianity and all Religion, and to bring about a total change of government. Robinson was discussing the undoubtedly vital role played by Masonry in the French Revolution, as was disclosed by Abbe Barreul in the most precise and in disputable manner. If this is not enough evidence for doubters, then let them turn to the most important \"passwords\" in Masonry. One of them is based on Cain, whom Christ condemned as a slayer of prophets in St. Matthew 23. The password, Tuba l Cain, is a very explicit reference to Cain. The other \"secr et word\" is INRI, \"Igne Natura Renovatur Integra\" - \"All Nature is Renewed by Fire\" which is used to describe Jesus of Nazareth. The initiate is supposed to \"discover\" what this means, wh ich gives an insight into how infantile are the rituals engaged in by Masons. Then the Master of the Lodge declares: 18"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z My dear brethren, the word is found, and all present applaud the discovery, that He whos e death was consummation of the Christian religion was no more than a common Jew crucified for His crimes. It is on the Gospel and the Son of Man that the Candidate is to av enge the brethren the Pontiffs of Jehovah. This quote is taken from the work of Abbe Barreul dealing with the 18 th Rosicrucian Degree. The Ro sicrucians were Masons, who founded English Masonry. It is fair to say, however, that the vast majority of English Masons never progress beyond the Fourth Degree, and heatedly deny that the foregoing exists. In fact several English Masons sa id that they were staunch Christians, and would never take part in blaspheming Christ or His church! Masonry for the majority of its membership is nothing but a repetition of the Firs t and Fourth Degrees. It is no wonder, that so many give up at this point and make no attempt to go further. According to th e very pro-Masonry Dr. Mackey, an authority on Masonry: . . . These are the explanations and the High Degree is the commentary. There are those who say that if Masonry is so evil, then how is it, that so many Anglicans and even a few of the Popes were Masons? I agree that perhaps th ousands of Anglican Church leaders are Masons, but these me n are not Christians; they are underground agents of Lucifer, sleepers in place in the Church whose function is to destroy it! Can we sa y that \"a few Popes were Masons,\" when it cannot be proved even though there is a strong suspicion that at least three Popes might have been Masons? Suspicion is not proof. A false rumor, begun among Masons in Germany, that Pope Pious XI was a Mason soon shifted to Philadelphia.

Shea's research proved that Pius XI had never been a member of the Philadelphia Lodge. In fact no such Lodge ever existed in Philadelphia! Preuss, another famous seeker after Masonic truths, confirms the plot, as nothing but an attempt to smear Pope Pius XI and the Catholic Church in general. In reply to the often-asked ques tion: \"What is Masonry?\" I can do no better than quote the great scholar and Mason historian Abbe Barreul ... It is a most vile malignant evil, a view confirmed by Supreme Pontiff Albert Pike, who said: Blue Degrees are no more than the outer door of the Temple portal. Part of the symbols received are the same, but he is intentionally deceived with false interpretations. It is not intended, that he should understand them, but rather that he imagined himself to understand them. Their true interpretation is reserved for the Initiated Ones, the Princes of Masonry. These words appear in documents about Pike held by the British Museum's inner sanctum, if they have not been removed in the meantime, as are so many documen ts when they once become a source of reference for investigators of Masonry. There must be something \"malignantly evil\" in a society that sets out to deliberately deceive its own members. Copin-Albancelli, the note Mason historian, states that Masonry is an occult-directed force being used as a battering ram against the Christian religion. 20"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z CHAPTER 4 ENCYCLICAL MIRARI VOS, POPE GREGORY XVI In this encyclical, Pope Gregory issued an order that Masonry is: . . . Everything which has been most sacrilegious, blasphemous and shameful in heresies and in the most criminal of sects has been jo ined together in the secret society as in a universal sewer. No wonder I get disturbed when people tell me, \"Catholics aren't Christians.\" Show me where it is written that any Protestant leader has ever come out as strongly against Masonry as the Catholic Church has. I have not found one to this very day. Perhaps this helps to explain the fact, that Vladimir Lenin was a Mason. Preuss says of Brother Leni n that he belonge d to a secret lodge in Switzerland, under his real name, Ulianov Zederbaum, from which secure and protected ba se he strove mi ghtily to bring about the overthrow of Christian Russia, an endeavor, I might add, in which he was most succes sful, thanks to massive help from Round Table Masons, Lord Palmerston, Lord Milner and a host of English 33 rd Degree Masons. And yet, the Swiss government called this archfiend an \"intellectual.\" This really makes sense when we know that for centuries, the home of Freemasonry has always been Switzerland. The \"fraternity\" showed in the case of Lenin that Masons stick together especially in endeavors, where the object is the destruction of the Christian religion, as in the case of Christian Russia. 21"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman The fact that English Masons made billions of dollars out of the rape of Russia was of course an added bonus. The real satisfaction was in the overthrow of Russia and the wholesale slaughter of Christians (certifie d as 60 million), which became a model to be followed in the Spanish Civil War (July 1936-June 1939). I refer to June of 1939, becau se that was the month that Franco marched in triumph through the streets of Madrid having smashed for God and country, the Luciferian forces of Communist-Masonry in his country. A renowned authority I have not yet mentioned was Margiotta, who was initiated into the Palladium Rites and became a \"Prince of Masonry.\" Margiotta said that Pike ordered the god of Masonry to be called Lucifer, much against the wishes of his brother-Mason, Adriano Lemmi, who desired that the Mason god be named Satan. Albert Mackey says that Masonry is here to establish a New Universal Religion. The publication, A Cause, states that Masons must disregard all laws and authority in every country, exactly in keeping with the rebe llious revolutionary nature of Lucifer, who rebelled against the laws and authority of God. Thus it can be held that by its own confession, Masonry is a revolutionary force, existing for the purpose of overthrowing the present order on Earth, just as its master Lucifer tried to overthrow the existing order of the Universe! Masonry is paramilitary order, as it's trapping and symbols, which are of a military nature, fully confirm. Both Eckert and Benoit insist and provide remarkable proof beyond all doubt that the real au thority in Masonry, the Supreme Command, is entirely occult in character, thereby explaining why the hidden Supreme Command shelters behind a mass of symbols and ceremonies, not to be uncovered un til the highest degree of the Order is reached.

These vile words are a part of the proofs offered in Benoit's, La Franc Maconnerie, the most re markable expose of Masonry available to those who seek knowle dge about the true purpose of Masonry. Three words cause 33 rd Degree Masons to go into a towering rage: Catholicism, Obscurantism and Clericalism. The second word is solely a Ma son word, which they like to use to describe the teachings of Christ. It clearly must have a double meaning to inspire the rage it does when used by non-Masons, because non-Masons are supposed to be ignorant of such words, and Masons hate to be unmasked.

It is a well-known fact, nor denied by Masonry itself, that th ey seek to enroll only those, who have made a success of business or political careers. The fact is money is the motiva ting force, when it comes to welcoming newcomers into the brotherhood. Such blatant hypocrisy should s ound a warning to any who may have been invited to attend one of the Masonic Temples in their area for a social get-together. Th is is the usual manner by which those whom the Order feels can be of financial benefit to it, do their recruiting. The Mason asks \"Are you on the Square,\" meaning \"Are you a Mason?\" The questioner is fully aware through a secret handshake that th e person he has approached is not a Mason, but someone he thinks would be likely candidate for membership in his lodge! To deal with degrees and ritual s would take a b ook of their own as there are hundreds of rites, many of them bordering on infantile. There are many good works devoted solely to such rituals, which make for tedious readi ng. According to the Masonic bible, Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, and a newer book called The Meaning of Masonry, by W.L. Wilmhurst, the main rites are as follows: 24"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z ■ Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite ■ Rite of Herod ■ Ancient Reformed Scottish Rite ■ Grand Orient Rite (of which the French Rite is a part) ■ Philosophic Scottish Rite (used extensively in Switzerland) ■ Electric Rite (used a gr eat deal in Germany) ■ Rite of Mizraim (Ancient Egyptian Rite) ■ Joanite Rite It is interesting to note that the hea dquarters of Universal Masonry is in Geneva, Sw itzerland, under the title of International Masonic Associati on. Switzerland, as is well recorded in history, has always been a haven for revolutionaries. A second \"branch headquarters\" is in Lausanne and it is a particularly secret one. Ascona is the home of Gnostic Satanist- Masonry-Communism. Remember, Masons are revolutionaries, taught to be rebellious agains t all existing governments, and Swiss Masons are no exception to this Mason injunction. Benoit says of Mason rituals: . . . They are long and tedious and exceedingly childish. In order that their childish absurdities are not found out by \"outsiders,\" before a Lodge m eeting begins, it is \"covered,\" a term used by Masons to ensure that no outsiders or interlopers are present to observe and report on the proceedings. Eckert and Copin describe the goings on in various ways and use the term \"unbelievable buff oonery\" to describe it.

The pur pose is to weed out all those members, who quickly show they have no desire to progress beyond this point, from those who follow the ritual in a slavish manner. Hiram, of course, is the centerpiece. To them, the ladder up, which they must climb, is not leading to further folly, but to a higher and more trusted position in Masonry. It is interesting to note some of the titles to which the eager ones can perhaps one day aspire: 5 th Degree The Perfect Master 11 th Degree The Sublime Elect of the Twelve of Prince Ameth 16 th Degree The Prince of Jerusalem 19 th Degree The Grand Pontiff 28 th Degree The Knight of the Sun or Prince Adept 26"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z 31 st Degree The Grand Inspector Inquisitor Commander 32 nd Degree The Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret 33 rd Degree The Supreme Pontiff Universal Masonry The Rite of Herod particularly interests me.

But it is to the Princes of Masonry, those who have reached the 33 rd degree, that the real f ace of Masonry becomes known.

Pike writes that the worship of Lucifer is known only to those, who have reached the final Degree. Lord Christopher Soames, the betrayer of Zimbabwe is such a person, as is Lord Carrington, the former Secretar y General of NATO. (In the Congress of the United States we have many who are of the same mind as Lords Soames and Carrington. One who quickly comes to mind is Senator Trent Lott, a 33 rd Degree Mason.) Copin, Benoit and Eckert all remind us, that the password Inri, which I have previously explained is a word hostile toward Christ. I wonder how Senator Lott and others like him who profess Christianity can square this with conscience. What is Luciferian worship? We need to be clear on this point in order to understand Pike's Palladium Rites, and what it is the Princes of Masonry actually follow, while at the same time professing to be Christians, as in the case of many in the Anglican Church hierarchy, the aristocracies of Europe, not to mention the Eastern Liberal Estab lishment of the U.S. and many members of Congress! As explai ned by Albert Pike, Luciferian worship is a creed, which teaches that Lucifer was the brightest of God's three right-hand angels , a super-being endowed with super intelligence and capabilities . So great was his power that he was able to challenge God and take over the running of the Universe. There followed a mighty battle with St. Michael, God's warrior angel (claimed by Masons as br other to Lucifer), defeating Lucifer and casting him out of God's presence. Jesus Christ makes reference to this in the Gospels. Lucifer was banished to Hell, which is described as an actual place in the Universe. Lucifer took with him a large number of the leading 28"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z angels in the hierarchy of Heav en, who were willing to defect with him. The Luciferian Creed holds that God gave these angels another chance to repent , because He considered that they had been deceived by the Master Deceiver, Lucifer. For this purpose God created ou r planet and those angels who were deceived and not openly re bellious, were given bodies in God's own image and permitted to inhabit the Earth. These beings were filled with the breath of God and His spirit and light, and were sanctified by God. They were indistinguishable from ordinary people except that they had all knowledge of their previous life in Heaven blocked out. But they received inspirations from his word to sustain them on their plane and retained a free will. Their minds were used to decide from where the inspirations emanated and translate them into bodily acts, which are always either positive or negative — no middle ground. These acts are recorded in a book known as the Book of Life mentioned in Revelations. By their actions in the physical realm, these beings of heavenly origin decide their own future, i.e. they could accept Lucifer's plan, or God's plan for rule of the Universe. One might say that it almost resembles what the Christian Bible teaches, but not quite. Suddenly Satan appears, brought in by Lucifer, as the Prince of The World (Please note, the use of the word \"Prince\" is also used by Masons) at the moment of the creation of the world. Satan's task was to get the first parents to defect from God and join Lucifer, thereby spoiling his plan. God, says Pike, walked in the Ga rden of Eden w ith his first son, but failed to instruct him in the pleasures of sex, because He is a jealous and selfish God. As taught in the lower Order of the Palladium Rites, God did this because such pleasure belonged to Him and was not to be shared until they had proved their 29"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman obedience, integrity and absolute honesty. Only then would it be given to them as a reward. Then, says Pike, Satan took a hand in matters and by the command of Lucifer inducted Eve into the pleasures of sex, which God had reserved for pr ocreation, and which God had merely postponed telling the first parents about, until they were ready for it. Satan told Eve that she would be equal in power, as would Adam, to God, and would never have to go through death. Satan introduced Eve to what we are pleased to call \"carnal knowledge,\" a term whic h is completely misleading. Thus was the Luciferian idea l of free love and free sex introduced, as opposed to God's plan of sex inside the boundaries of marriage of one man to one woman for the purpose of begetting children, based upon a spiritual wish to bring about the Kingdom of God on Earth. Pike's explanation of the Black Mass shows just how Eve was corrupted, and instead of sex being a personal and private physical and spiritual act of love, it was a public display of open sex with all-comers -- which is th e essence of witchcraft today. It is fair to say that given the conditions which prevail upon Earth today in the sexual realm, Satan is winning the battle, albeit temporarily until he was so undly defeated by Jesus Christ. Hence the unremitting hatred of Christ by the Masons! 30"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z CHAPTER 6 THE USE OF THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE IN MASONIC TEMPLES Preuss and the Catholic Encycl opedia confirm the use of the Bible and the Cross in Masonic Temples. Many lower-Order Masons have challenged the statement made from time to time, namely, that Masonry is Luciferian worship. They say: \"As we display the Bible and Cross, how can this be?\" It is part of Masonry's deception plan. The Bible is only there to be held up to ridicule in the higher order, as is the Cross, which is actually trampled underfoot, while the most vile profanities are uttered against it. Eckert confirms that the Cross and Bible are displayed to bring them down to the level of other religious \"books\" of little importance. In the 30 th Degree of the Scottish Rite, the initiate is made to trample on the cross, while the Knight of Kadosh tells him: \"Trample upon this image of superstition! Crush it!\" If the initiate does not do it, he is appl auded, but the secrets of the 30 th Degree are not imparted to him. If he does trample on the Cross, he is received into the Knight s of Kadosh, and instructed to execute his vengeance on three images representing the Pope, superstition and the King. This graphic description is gi ven by the renowned authority Benoit in his monumental work, La Franc Macconerie. Thus do Masons hope to advance the cause of Lucifer that he should rule the Universe. Some Masons have gone as far as having themselves emasculated, believing that unrestrained sex, as permitted by the Luciferian Creed, could very well interfere with their work in bringing a bout the Kingdom of Lucifer on Earth. Janos Kader, the former Hungarian leader, had himself 31"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman castrated for this reason. The Catholic Church does not go to this extreme, but demands celibacy in priests and nuns so that sexual pressures cannot play any pa rt in their service to mankind and to Christ. Pike, although a S upreme Pontiff, had his orders relayed to him through a set of \"I nstructions\" in the year 1889, by what Margiotta says is a \"Supreme Council Body of 23 Councils of World-Wide Masonry.\" According to some translations of the text, which is in the British Museum in London, the Orders read: To you Sovereign Inspectors General, we say this, that you may repeat to the Brethren of the 32 nd , 31 st and 30 th Degrees . . . The Masonic religion should by all of us Initiates of high Degrees, be maintained in the purity of the Luciferian Doctrine. If Lucifer were not God, would Adonai whose deeds prove his cruelty and hatred of man, barbarism and repulsion for science would Adonai and priests calumniate him. Yes, Lucifer is God, and unfortunately Adonai is also God. For the eternal law is th at there is no light without shade . . . Thus the doctrine on Satanism is a heresy, and the pure and true philosophic religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonai, but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good, is struggling for humanity against Adonai, the God of Darkness and Evil. This is the true religion of Masonry. The aims and objectives of the Ma son religion as outlined above are bringing about revolutions intended to overthrow the Kingdom of God on Earth. The overthrow of Christian Russia was a great triumph for the anti-C hrist forces, their defeat by General Franco in Spain was a catastrophic blow in which Masonry was also pummeled, fo r which Franco will never be forgiven.

Lest we forget, or indeed, lest some of us were neve r aware of it, Masons in France called for renewing ties with the Bolshevik government following a world-wide breaking of diplomatic relations in protes t over the violence and bloodshed of the Bolshevik Revolution. Mason President Woodrow Wilson was the first to recognize the Bolshe vik Government, in spite of strenuous protests by the Congress. The power of Masonry is awesome! Eckert: Masons engineered the First World War; they admit owing the most fierce insurgents and apostles of assassinations in the world. The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria at Sarajevo, generally regarded by historians as the spark that set Europe ablaze in WWI, was a Mas onic affair. There are many authorities besides Eckert who agree with the contention. From the explanation of the ritual as well as from secular history and confessions by members of the Or der, one may rightly conclude that Freemasonry is a conspiracy against the altar, the government and property righ ts, with the objective of establishing all over the face of the Earth, a social theocratic reign, whose religious-political government would have its See in Jerusalem. The indispensable condition to this realization is the destruction of the three obstacl es which are opposed to it, the Christian Church, government and private property. 33"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman The middle objection has largely fa llen away.

Governments cannot be blind to history, which is replete with examples of Masonic treachery. Why then is this devilish secret-society- Luciferian-religion allowed to exist in the very midst of this Christian nation? Why is any secret society permitted? I wish that someone better equipped than I, would explain this sorely perplexing question. Perhaps it is due to the fact that governments in every Western country are fully controlled by a parasitic secr et government, such as the one we have fa stened around our necks, the Committee of 300, through its Council on Foreign Relations, which is absolutely Luciferian in every facet of its activities. In addition to this, we have many powerful religions which are not Christian, and indeed, one majo r religion is downright anti- Christian and it plays a leading role in all anti-Christian activities. Masons regard the destruction of Christ as an essential goal of their religious purposes, which ar e of course fully interfaced with their political aspirations. America will yet pay a price for \"freedom of religion\" and the price will very likely be the total destruction of this great Ameri can Republic as we know it in its present form. If you open the doors to thieves, you must expect your house to be robbed! The Masonic lie of \"equality in all religions\" has been exposed many times as quackery, specious mendacity, but it is worth repeating: In Masonry, there is no freedom of religion.

Again to quote the Supreme Pontiff, Albert Pike: Masonry, like all religions, al l mysteries, hermeticism and alchemies, hides secrets from everyone except the Initiated, Sages or Elects, and employs false explanations and interpretations of its symbols to deceive those who deserve to be deceived and to hide from the truth, which is called light and to separate them from it.

One such a notable who comes to mind was Benjamin Disraeli, one of its greatest Prime Ministers, although until the time he was picked up almost pe nniless by the Rothschilds, he hadn't amounted to much. But this is a story I have told in my book \"The Rothschild Dynasty,\" one which has been revealed to only a very few. Disraeli is noted as an authority on Freemasonry, and long after the French Revolution was over made the following statement: It was neither parliaments nor populations, nor was the course of events that overthrew the throne of Louis Philippe . . . The throne was surprised by the Secret Societies, ever prepared to ravage Europe. Now, I know this has often been quoted in the past, but I felt it worthwhile to include it in this book, simply because it is of no less significance today than it was when Disraeli uttered these words in 1852. Make no mistake about it; the fo rces that ravaged France and Russia stand ready to ravage th e United States. Will you not pay heed and see how South Africa wa s betrayed and sold out to the New World Order? If you will not pay heed then you deserve the fate that will likely overwhelm us all unless we can get the American people to wake up!

The assassinations were plotted and planned by Freemasons and it hasn't stoppe d there. President Reagan narrowly escaped death at the hands of John Hinckley.

Hinckley was programmed to commit the assassination, which failed. In short, Hinckley was as much brainwas hed as was Sirhan-Sirhan. As reported in earlier publicati ons of mine, the Hinckley psychiatrist, who later gave evid ence at his trial, received a substantial \"grant\" from the Sco ttish Rite of Freemasonry. Need anything further be said? For those who still think of Freemasonry as a philanthropic Order, dedicated to doing good, allow me to suggest that you read what Copin-Albancelli, a harsh critic, and Louis Blanc, one of Masonry's darlings, had to sa y about the Order. In a moment of frankness, Blanc bared the dece it of Masonry for all to see: Since three degrees of ordinary Masonry comprised a great number of men opposed, because of the status and principle for social overthrow, the innova tors multiplied the degrees as steps to climb the mystic scale, they instituted the high degrees as a dark sanctuary, w hose portals are not opened to initiates until after a long seri es of tests (which) are designed to prove the progress of his revolutionary education, the constancy of his faith and the temple of his heart. Blanc provided this undeniable fact; that Freemasonry is one of the strongest, revolutionary forces in the world, and has been so since its inception. Once again, we have to thank a Freemason spokesman for helping us to uncover the proofs needed to support the foregoing statement. 37"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman I have noticed how it is, that ev ery time the Masons have a big banquet, one of them gets in hi s cups, and out comes the truth. Look at the statement made by the Freemason Jacques Delpech at a very big and important banquet held in 1902: The triumph of the Galilean has lasted 20 centuries, and he is dying in his turn. The myst erious voice, which once on the mountain of Epirus announced the death of Pan, today announces the death of the deceiver God, who promised an era of justice and peace to those who should believe in him. The illusion has lasted very long; the lying God in his turn disappears; he goes to rejoin the other divinities of India, Greece and Egypt, also Rome, where so many deluded creatures threw themselves at the foot of their alters. Freemasons, we are pleased to state, that we are not concerned with this ruin of false prophets. The Roman Church, founded on the Galilean myth, began to decline rapidly on the day, when the Masonic association was constituted . . . From th is political point of view, Freemasons have often varied, but in all times, Freemasons have stood firm on this principle, war on all superstitions, war on all fanaticisms. The original of this statement can be seen in the British Museum in London. I quoted an extract of this statement earlier in this book, but on reflection felt it advisable to include the full statement, because I consider it to be the most revealing words ever to be uttered by a high-ranking Freemason. Perhaps less well known is the role played by Freemasonry in the War Between the States, also known as the American Civil War. An authority on the subject is the author Blanchard, who in his work, Scottish Rite Mas onry, volume II, page 484, states with this regard to this tragic conflict: 38"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z This is the most infamous Ma sonic war act, next to burning their records of 59 years before the war to hide treason.

The Southern people were dragooned into it by leaders, secretly sworn to obe y Masonic orders and Masonic leaders, or have their throats cut! What then, has Freemasonry ach ieved thus far? First and foremost, its war on Christ and the Church has been stepped up through a massive revival of witchcraft and the astounding spread of Gnosticism during the past decade (see my work, Satanism). The struggle with the Catholic Church has also been intensified. By 1985, there were more Jesuits inside the higher councils of the Vatican, than at any time in the history of Catholicism. Its para-military Order, the Society of Jesus, has been able to fan out across the world and wreak havoc among nations, notably in Zimbabwe, Nicaragua, the Philippines and South Africa, and also to a very marked extent , inside the United States of America, where it has establishe d a veritable fortress command center from where it has penetrat ed every branch of government. It has engendered a spirit of lawlessness sweeping the world in many forms, notably in the form of \"rock\" music and its twin, the drug culture, and in the sharp rise in international terrorism. It is a good thing to recall, that Christ said Lucifer stands for lawlessness and rebell ion, of which he is the father. Reviewing the progress of Freemasonry, we look back to its first great triumph, the bloody French Revolution.

The same holds true of the te rrifying Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. In both cases, we see the spirit of Freemasonry as the guiding hand, especially British Freemasonry. Prior to that we saw the Anglo-Boer War, a cruel and relentless attempt to wipe out a small pastoral nation of G od-fearing Christians, the first act of genocide, carried out solely to take control of the mineral riches that lay beneath the soil of South Africa. Yes, it was the first recorded genocide against a nation. Leading Masons such as Lord Palmer and Alfred Miln er carried it out against what they regarded as a \"cheap\" infe rior nation (the words of Cecil Rhodes), the White Christian Boer Nation. In that war we saw the first use of concentration camps and an all-out war against the civil population (as opposed to the military) resulting in the deaths of 27,000 women and children. The cruel Crimean War was anothe r milestone in the progress of Universal Freemasonry. The Abyssinian War, yet another genocidal war, came about simply as a means of ripping Italy apart and weakening the Catholic Church. It was nothing but Freemasonry intrigue from start to finish. General Rodolfo Grazziani was a top Mason, the whole thing a legacy of Mazzini, Master Mason and master intriguer. It is no wonder then, that Musso lini outlawed Masonry in Italy in 1922 and exiled some of its leaders, such as Bartelemeo Torregiani.

It was another Mason plot from whatever angle one looked at it. The Masons used the civil unrest their forces had stirred up, launching a furious and bloody assault on the Catholic Church. Official statistics show 50,000 nuns and priests lost their lives in the mo st cruel and inhuman fashion. So violent was its hatred for the Catholic Church, that in one terrible action, Socialist troops dug up the corpses of nuns and priests and then lined them up in sitting positions against the walls of a church, put crosses in their hands, and berated, denounced and cursed the dead wi th every vile invective they could muster. Since the Western jackal press th en, as now is in the hands of Freemasonry, the \"loyalists\" (the Communists, whose only loyalty was to Lucifer) received worldwide press support.

Without exception, praise, adul ation, support and comfort were heaped on the enemies of all mankind, while the forces of Christian Spain under Christian Ge neral Franco were subjected to every possible slander, calumny and unfounded accusations of brutality, which our jackal pr ess in the West is so good at putting together and carrying out.

Assassinations carried out by Freemasons were not confined solely to U.S. presidents, they have covered a wide range of notable figures in history. There are many other victims of Mason assassins, like Rep. L.

Why was 1913 significant? Because without the Federal Reserve Banks it would not have been possible for Freemasonry to prosecute the First World War! In this war, and in the Second World War, the munitions factor ies belonging to international banksters (word for bankers and gangsters) were never touched! The Federal Reserve Bank's \"elastic\" currency provided the money for the arms trade, so you can rest assured, that nobody on either side of the conflict would have been foolish enough to destroy the assets of the banke rs, that is, their arms and munitions factories. It is my feeling that the real \"internationalists\" are the Western country's arms merchants. These men working under Masonic direction have two objectives: To create and prolong wars and to disturb peace through international terrorism. Then, to exploit the wars they expect will follow. Banks know no national boundaries and owe no allegiance to any country. Their God is Lucifer. If possible, obtain a copy of Arms and the Men, a small book published by Fortune Magazine a nd read it carefully. You will then have a clear picture of who is behind international terrorism, and perhaps more important, proof Freemasonry is the demon force loose in the world today, responsible for the Red Brigades (successor to the Mason terrorist group La Roja — The Reds) and the many hundreds of organized terrorist groups on the rampage throughout the world!

If you find that hard to believe, then let me remind you of the greatest opium pushers the world has ever known; the British Government. The official British Government Opium Policy for China produced millions of addicts smoking opium. Lord Palmerston, a 33 rd Degree Scottish Rite Freemason was in charge of this insidious trade.

Her car is still under wraps in the police yard in Monaco. No one is allowed to inspect it. And why? Because Grace was murdered by the men of the P2 Freemasonic Order (the most secret branch of Italian Masonry) as a warning to her husband not to skim the profits of its dope operations in Columbia and Bolivia!

The lawless Supreme Court gave America abortion, a polite word for the wholesale murder of at least 50 million innocent babies, helpless and unable to protect themselves!

Masonry is many things to many people, but the common thread running through the history of Freemasonry is its enduring characteristic of secrecy for their security. All secret societies are subversive, some are also occult and political, but these facts are concealed from the main body of Masons, who seldom progre ss beyond the Fourth Degree. Masonry is an organization that loves secrecy, and hates those who seek to expose its inherent evil. It has a fetish with secrecy. Masonry needs much light cast upon it. An open house would be suicidal for the movement. The purpose of this work is to throw some light on Masonry, so interfaced with the Jesuits and the Black Nobility, that it would be impossible to discuss Masonry in isolation, and without making some references to its co- conspirators. This will become apparent as I proceed with the book. The so- called Mason creed is rather we ll described by Leo Tolstoy, who though not a Mason gave a clear account, shaded by a little too much sympathy toward Freemasonry and some of its principles. Tolstoy details with \"brotherhood\" (the cornerstone of Masonry, the Dluminati and Communism) as follows: Only by laying stone upon stone with the co-operation of all the millions of generations from our forefather Adam to our own times is the Temple reared, which is to be a worthy dwelling place of the great God. 48"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z He does not tell us that the le tter \"G\" a symbol of Masonry stands for Gnosticism, not God. Tolstoy goes on to say: The first and chief object of our Order, the foundation on which it rests and which no human power can destroy, is the preservation and handing down to us from the remotest ages, even from the first man — a mystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends. But si nce this mystery is of such a nature, that nobody can know or use it unless he be prepared by long and diligent self-purific ation, not every one can hope to attain it quickly, hence we have a secondary aim: that of preparing our members as much as possible to reform their hearts, to purify and enlighten their minds, by means handed on to us by tradition. This is precisely the aims of the Illuminati and also those of many other secret societies such as the Rosicrucians and the Jesuits. The Black Nobility believes that they were somehow endowed with special knowledge and chosen to rule \"from the time of Antiquity.\" Thus can be seen the common denominators between Masonry and other occult secret societie s, with which the world is presently so heavily infested. That Masonry is entirely a dark lie can be deduced from the words of Christ, who said . . . that men love darkness (secret places) rather than light, because their deeds are evil. It is the notion of a longstand ing tradition of fundamental importance that provides Masonry with motivation. All secret orders, even the Egyptian priest hood, were held together and given power and authority on the presumption that they knew secret things the common peopl e did not know. Tolstoy again: The third aim is the regeneration of mankind. 49"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman This involves the Seven Steps of Solomon's Temple. At this point I will mention that Solo mon was probably the greatest magician who has ever lived. In modern times, a young Roma, born and living in the U.S. who called himself David Copperfield, achieved fame as a great magician. Roma gypsies have long been known as the pract itioners of magic tricks, and Copperfield rose to great heights before his carrier was brought down by his arrest for rape. Because I believe, as also states in the Old Testament, that Christianity does not rest upon a foundation of magic, I am inclined to disregard the wisdom of Solomon as having little bearing on the teachings of Christ. My personal view is that Christianity is not fully dependent upon the Old Testament. Christianity really began with the Christ of Galilee. Christ was not of Jerusalem, not of Solomon and not of the Davidic line. Therefore Christians must reject out of hand as propaganda the idea that Masonry is based upon Christianity, because it speaks so much of Solomon. If we make a study of this point, we shall have a better understanding both of Masonry an d Christianity. My personal view is that Christ originally c onfined His ministry to Galilee, but was persuaded by His Disciples, to undertake a missionary crusade to Jerusalem. It was not long after his missionary trip to that city, that the Sanhedrin sent enced Him to be crucified. I do not believe that Solomon's magic tricks have any relationship to Christianity, any more than does Freemasonry. I wonder how many of us have ever stopped to question the close links between Freemasons and temples.

I point out to you, that th e objective is to instill in all of us, a careless attitude towa rd death, which is in direct opposition to the teaching of Christ, who said, that death is the last enemy to be overcome. When we begin to think of death as a mere nothing, civilization is in danger of regressing back into barbarity. By accustoming us to a casu al acceptance of death, our sensitivities (it is hoped) will be blunted — the normal conscious horror of mass-killings will eventually give way to a sense of unconcern. I submit to you, that we are all being steadily brainwashed. Remember this poi nt when you next see a movie which includes the almost mandato ry grave-side funeral scene. The intention is to breed disrespect for the individuality of each one of us. We are not a mass of people, we are individuals. A casual acceptance of death is ag ainst the teachings of Christ, and conforms to Freemason doctrines , as well as the doctrines of a large number of other secret societies decidedly Satanic in character and purpose. Frank King, the author of a notable book on Cagliostro, the Freemason, who is believed to have \"discovered\" the Egyptian Rite of Masonry, says that the initiation ceremony undergone by Cagliostro \"was very similar to that which is performed in Masonic Lodges today.\" It includes several harmless but undignified scenes, which were intended to impress the candidate.

He had to kneel, divested of his clothing, to show his subservience to the Master of the Lodge. Cagliostro, a great magician, while on a vi sit to London, came across a book on Egyptian Rite. The book is by George Gaston. It so impressed Cagliostro that he began to promote it, calling it \"The Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry,\" claiming it as his own. Cagliostro said that the Egyptian Rite was more solemn and ancient that regular Masonry. He promoted his \"discovery\" as a \"higher Order of Masonry,\" open only to Masons above the 25 th Degree. Like the original auth or, Gaston, Cagliostro claimed that the founders of the Egyptian Rite were Elijah and Enoch, and like them, members of the Egyptian Rite Masonic Order would never die, but be \"trans ported\" after death, each time rising from the ashes to live twelve lives. There is little doubt, that \"purif ied\" Masons found the prospect of not having to die and being i nvested with twelve lives very pleasing, so there were a number of converts to Cagliostro's new, or should I say, ancient Order, notably Marshall Von der Recke and Countess Von der Recke of the Black Nobility, whose families are traceable to the Venetian Black Guelphs. The extraordinary Cagliostro, master magician and the \"Solomon\" of his day, was admitted to the Esperence Lodge of Freemasons Kings Head in London in 1776. Afte r 14 months in London, he set off to promote his \"new\" Rite in Rome under the nose of his Catholic enemies and was promptly arrested by th e Pope. If we knew nothing more than this of Freemasonry, it would already be clear that Freemasonry is the direct descendant of the Orphic and Pythagorean Cults, and has nothing whatever to do with Christianity, less still with the worship of God, which, as I have said, Masonry does not tell us while proudly claiming that the letter \"G\" stands for God. If Masonry were based upon Christianity, it would not hate w ith such fury and violence the Catholic Church. 52"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z CHAPTER 10 THE CATHOLIC CHURCH : ARCH-ENEMY OF FREEMASONRY From the earliest days of its history the Catholic Church denounced Masonry as inherently evil. The Protestant Church on the other hand, and more particul arly its Anglican branch, has not only openly tolerated Masonry, but in a number of cases some of the Anglican Church hier archy holds high offices in Freemasonry. There are many inst ances, where Anglican priests control the most secretive and important Lodges, notably the Quator Coronati Lodge in L ondon, and the notorious Nine Sisters Lodge in the 15 th Arrondissment in Paris. Freemasonry has most scornfully declared that it has no fear of Protestantism, regarding it as the bastard offspr ing of Catholicism, its deadly and formidable enemy. The Protestant Church cannot o ffer effectual opposition to the spread of Freemasonry. Freemasonry teaches as fact that masonry is the only viable alternative to Catholicism, which Mazzini (a leading Mason who played such a decisive role in bringing about the American Civil War) denounced with the utmost ferocity. It is perfectly correct to say that Freemasonry simply ignores the Protestant Church. A 33 rd Degree Mason told me: We are the leading religion in the world today. We are older and wiser than the Catholic C hurch, which is why it hates us so much. The man who joins us feels that he is a member of a fundamental secret societ y religion, guarding the most ancient mysteries of life forces and the universe.

Look at the Catholics in Africa and South America. Would you say that they are imbued with a profound sense of purpose, of belonging? Of course my Mason friend di d not bother to explain that Freemasonry is based on deception, its true purpose being the worship of Lucifer. Continuing with his efforts to propagandize me (he was actually setting me up for proposed membership of his Lodge), he said: The initiate we accept comes out with a sense of a neat and orderly universe, where his own aims and purposes are suddenly clearly defined. A tradition dating back to Adam stands behind him. The noti on of brotherhood of man gives him a new sense of belonging to the human race. What is more, the world is full of benevolent brother Masons, who will not allow him to sink. This is of course an important attraction the Christian Church misses completely. Until the Christian Church learns to care about people, about each other in practical everyday term s, Christianity will continue to fade. There is no doubt that a strong desi re, a craving exists in all of us to have our physical needs met. Security is all-important, and my Mason friend certainly has a valid point. While Billy Graham and his fellow \"televangelists\" obviously take excellent care of their own needs, the ra nk and file members of their ministries are not at all cared for in the physical sense. There is a total lack of Christian brotherly love and concern for each other among Christians. No one can deny that such a glaringly obvious flaw exists and that it is a serious problem. In this we could take a leaf out of Masonry who takes good care of their members.

Whether we are Catholic or Protestant, it is our duty to oppose their goal with all our strength. All great conspiracies are cemented a nd bound together, energized by powerful ideological motives — in the case of Masonry, a common hatred of Christianity. We can include in their \"hate list\" the hatred of Republican ideals and nation states. What do the conspirators have in common, apart from the foregoing? The answer is that they are backed one hundred percent by the immense wealth of \"old families\" and even foolishly by some royalty. In America they receive full support from the CFR, a descendent of the Essex Junto, one of the conspiratorial bodies that were behind the Civil War, which almost succeeded in breaking up th e Union with the help of the wealthiest Boston families. The descendants of the oldest and most respectable families of Bo ston are continuing the work of the Essex Junto, trying to smash th e U.S. — and they are backed by some of the richest ba nking dynasties in the world. This clutch of traitors has an ally in the Vatican, one Clarissa McNair, who used to broadcast anti-American propaganda over the Vatican Radio. She was protect ed by a number of important Freemasons so that she managed to survive the wrath of the Pope. The destabilizing of Poland, which laid the groundwork for the intended invasion, was carried out by Jesuit trained Freemason Zbigniew Brzezinski who \"created \" \"Solidarity,\" the fake labor union, solely as a base to destabilize the government of General Jaruzelski. The Pope explaine d that he, Lech Walesa, was merely a tool in the hands of greater forces. After their meeting Walesa faded from the political scene.

The above cases, Poland and opposition to the Jesuits, are but two of a number of instances in which Popes were involved in running battles with Masonry. Very few people know anything about Pope John Paul's diplomatic efforts - such as his repeated warnings to America to drop its bl inkered pro-Israel approach to Middle East politics, an attitude which the Pope believes will lead to the Third World War. Poland is not the only case of deliberate treachery inside Western government since the Seco nd World War. I recall that it was a certain Klugman, who indu cted the traitors, British MI6 agents by the name of Burgess, McLean and Philby, into the service of the KGB. Philby, a life-long Freemason, got his job with the SIS (Special Intelligence Service) through Scottish Rite Mason and one-time Director of the SIS, Sir Stuart Menzies. Anthony Blunt, keeper of the Queens Pictures and spy extraordinary, began his career of treachery after joining the Masons. Throughout his career, Blunt was protected by senior men in the SIS, fellow Masons, who like Blunt were devoted to the cause of Masonry. The SIS is riddled with KGB-Mason moles. Another scandalous fact is that Scotland Yard is run from the top down by Freemasons of the Scottish Rite. Masonry uses subtle methods of control. In the earlier days of its history, it was not always thus. It was more prone to use naked force to obtain its objectives than it does now. One truly remarkable example of what I am talking about concerns Cagliostro, whom I previously mentioned. Cagliostro was being tr ied on a charge of theft when the court proceedings were interrupted by a Sicilian marquis, a 33 rd Degree Mason, leaping on th e prosecutor and beating him to the ground.

Calvi was the director of Banco Ambrosiano, who was guilty of skimming several millions of Mason money. He fled to England to seek protection from friends of his, onl y to walk into a fatal trap. He was hanged by Masons in their ritual fashion. When the occasion demands, Masons do not recoil from violence. The bloody oaths taken with each degree are brutal and repugnant. Author John Robinson says in his book Born in Blood: . . . To have one's tongue torn out by the roots, heart plucked from the breast, body cut in two with entrails burned to ashes appears to be overkill, literall y, and is against the law of any land where Freemasons function, as well as bring against all religions whom the Masons welcome into the brotherhood. John Quincy Adams who served as the sixth president of the United States was particularly and vehemently opposed to Freemasonry. As Robinson says in his book: Adams never missed an opportunity to condemn Freemasonry. He appealed to all Freemasons to abandon the order and to help abolish it for once and for all as it was totally incompatible with a Christian democracy. He wrote so many letters against Masonry that they can and do fill a book. In a letter to his friend Edward Ingersoll dated September 22, 1831, the ex-president summed up his attitude toward the Masonic oaths and their impact on the brotherhood. 51"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman There is a great deal of contention among historians and scholars of Masonry and the U.S. Constitution, in that the claims of Masonry having ta ken hold among the Founding Fathers remained firmly embedded in the new young Republic. The final draft of the Constitution came from many minds, but it was he ld that Freemasons were responsible for most of it. This cannot be borne out, as Thomas Jefferson whose prose formed the better part of the document was strongly opposed to Freemasonry. Other leading writers were George Washington, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams. Although not a Mason, Adams is said to have agreed with Washington and Franklin. Jefferson remained the odd man out. But as it did with Cagliostro, Masonry stil l takes care of its own. The \"miraculous escape\" from a maximum-security Swiss prison by Italian P2 Freemason Lucio Gelli attests to this and to Mason power. Gelli is living in Spain, unbothered by either the Swiss police or Reinhart Heydric h's hangover, Interpol. The odd thing about Gelli is that throughout the Second World War, he worked very closely with Mussolini, yet Mussolini was opposed to Freemasonry. Perhaps it had to do with the f act, that when he was 17 years old, Gelli volunteered for an ex peditionary force raised by Mussolini and sent to fight the Communists in Spain. Later he joined the CIA. In March 1981, police raided Gelli's residence and discovered numerous documents showing that he had worked with Roberto Calvi of the so-called \"Vatican Bank,\" in other words, with the Mafia.

David Rockefeller makes extensive use of Interpol, which he literally bought lock, stock and barrel from Germany in the post war years, to keep a watchful ey e on American right wing groups that might pose a threat to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). The history which I have studied, not to be found in your regular history books, reveals that the Scottish Rite has always, and still does, provided leadership for many s ecret societies that infest the world. The Scottish Rite of Freemasonry began as the Mobeds Cult, sometimes called the Magi. Simon, the magician, known as Simon Magus, was a member of the Mobeds. It was Simon Magus who raised-up the cult of Gnosticism as an anti-Christian force, which he then took to Rome to counter the activities of St. Peter and Philo of Alexandria. From Gnosticism grew the wellspri ng of hatred of Christianity, nation, states and republican ideal s, eventually being distilled into the leader of all secret societies, which we know as Freemasonry. At the heart of Freem asonry lies the Scottish Rite in which Lucifer is edified and worshipped in the higher Degrees.

Hayes refused to take the oath of allegiance when the war broke out. The high and mighty First National Bank of Boston was founded by Hayes, Arthur Hayes Sulzbe rger and John Lowell, under the name \"Bank of Massachusetts.\" The Sulzbergers went on to run the New York Times as its nominal, although not actual owners.

The Mason-run account of it does not appear in any of our history books for obvious reasons. The Anglophile Families, who did not join the Colonists in the war against Britain, moved to Nova Sc otia, from where they assisted the British throughout the American Revolution. Later they returned to the U.S. and carried on the tradition of helping the British Freemason conspiracy against Republican America, which culminated in the Civil War. In that cruel disaster Ameri ca lost 500,000 men, more than our combined losses in both Worl d Wars. The Civil War was a British-European oligarchic Freemason plot to split the country into warring states, and then walk in and take back what they lost in the American Revolutio n. In this they were ably supported by a nest of \"American\" traitors. The infamous Eastern Liberal Establishment might have succeeded and there would be no United States toda y had it not been for the outstanding work done by the American patriots Clay and Carey. We must learn this lesson in hi story, even though such history does not appear in historian Charles Beard's work. Freemasonry never gave up after losing the wa r with the Col onists. Things came to the head in 1812, afte r a long period in which the British Navy seized American ships and imprisoned thousands of American sailors.

Without the Derwent engine, it would have taken the Soviets at least fifteen years to build a jet fighter. Just as today there are those of us who deeply distrust the \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and Britain, having seen what it has done to our country, so in the days of the Essex Junto, there were patriots who saw through British Masonry's plotting and planning. They trie d to expose the treachery of Caleb Cushing and John Slidell. They warned against the \"free trade\" economic policies of the day, the very same policies we permitted Milton Friedman to sell to the \"conservative\" Reagan administration. Free trade is a British Freemason concocted plot to destroy our economy. It is time that we took the lid off the history of the Venetian Black Nobility related Scottish Rite traitors like the pirates Sam and George Cabot and the Pickerings, who made their fortune out of the twin mise ries of opium a nd slave trading. McGeorge Bundy's antecedents were slave traders. It was Freemason John Jacob Astor who permitted the Pickerings to get into the preposterously lucrative China opium trade. The truth must be told about the whole nest of vipers writhing around inside the British East India Company, Loring, Adam Smith and David Hume. It was Loring who stole the rations of Americans taken prisoner by the British during the American Revolution, which he then sold to the British Army for a huge profit, leaving the American prisoners to starve to death on terrible prison ships. 70"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z When I first read Mathew Carey's, The Olive Branch, I could not believe what I was reading. But over the years I found that everything that Carey claimed has very much been substantiated. Another work that I recommend is The Famous Families of Massachusetts. These famous families have among their ranks the descendants of the Lorings, the Pickerings and the Cabots, descendants of the Masonic network originally set up in this country by the French oligarchis t Cabots and the Swiss Prevosts. Of such stuff is the Anglophile Eastern Liberal Establishment made. I could go on quoting family names and their history, which everything possible has been done to conceal. Their loyalties lie with the European and British royal families and oligarchies through the Scottish R ite of Freemasonry.

Unless we take stock of what powerful for ces are running U.S. affairs, no matter who occupies the White House, we have no hope of combating the enemy. The only way we can thwart the plans of the Scottish Rite traitors is to expose their activities. To do this, our patriots must be kept informed of what the Scottish Rite, and indeed, all Masonry stands for, viz., the overthrow of existing order and th e destruction of nation states, especially those with republican constitutions, the destruction of the family and the destruction of Christianity.

Therefore, the object of this work is to provide material that will help you to better understand economic and political events now shaking the world by pointing out the connection between these destructive satanic events and Freemasonry. Please be patient, don't stop right here and write and tell me that you are a member of one or another of the many Masonic orders and that you know the Masons are a fine philanthropic society, which has banned political and religious matters from its discussions and deliberations. The problem is that the lower degree Masons do not ever know what the highest degree Masons are doing. The very structural nature of the movement makes it impossible for them to know. Thus, it is a relatively easy matter for the top leadership to deceive the rank and file member s as to the actions, aims and intentions of Masonry. And if by chance one of the members of the lower order should gravitate to the top, he is sworn to secrecy on pain of death never to reveal what he knows to the lower brethren or anyone else outs ide of the Masoni c order. This oath of silence is very strictly enforced. I will try to avoid mentioning the many different religious cults and beliefs connected to Freemasonry and stay with the aspects of English and American Masonry. English Masonry is said by most authorities on the subject, to have established itself in the ye ar 1717 under the title Guilds of 73"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Operative or Working Masons, an d it opened its doors to what was called Speculative Masons, that is, non-working Masons, thereby creating a combined movement called the English Grand Lodges. The older Guild Masons were in existence for many centuries before 1717, but they were not, I repeat, not a political force. They concerned themselves only with making their trade, craft and/ or profession a closed shop; that is to say, they preserved their secrets against outsider penetration. The early Masons, that is before 1717 had three degrees only — Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craf t and Master Mason. When the amalgamation occurred, the Guild Masons allowed big changes to take place, the first being that the name of the Christian God was eliminated from the ritual, Blue Masonry, as it became known, was by that period a virtually new movement and it ended the cooperation with Craf t Masons. In short, the non- working speculative Masons took over completely and the old order disappeared from the scene. Out of the new order grew a new militant and revolutionary Masonic Order called The Scotti sh Rite. While barring Grand Orient rituals, that is th e European Masonry, English Freemasonry has not barred the Scottish Rite and this revolutionary ritual has, like a deadly virus, taken over all Masonic cells in England and Am erica to produce more of its own kind. The greater part of the membersh ip of English Masonry remains at the Third Level, generally unaware of the evils being perpetrated in its name in the higher degrees. By time the Ninth Degree is reached, the revolutionary nature of the Scottish Rite Masonry is exposed to qualifying ca ndidates, that being its final purpose; subversion of the State by Masonry as taught in the 33 rd Degree, which also explains why many 33 rd Degree Masons have been in charge of dissolving existing governments in many countries. 74"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z For example, in the French and American Revolutions, the War Between the States and latterly in Zimbabwe where a 33 rd Degree Mason, Lord Somas, betrayed Zimbabwe into the hands of a Communist tyrant, under the fraudulent guise of \"majority rule\" and the total sell out of South Africa by Masons in charge of Britain and the U.S. Somas was one of those \"determined men of Masonry\" described by Disraeli, the Prime Minister of Britain and a Mason, when he discussed particularly the Scottish Rite and Grand Orient Lodges saying: We must take into account Secret Societies who can disconcert all measures at the last moment, who have agents everywhere, determined men encouraging assassinations, etc. This certainly does not sound like the philanthropic society Masons claim it to be and, in tr uth, it is not. The question arises; why do we have to have secret societies anyway? America was founded on Christian principles wh ich clearly state, \"that men like darkness rather than light so that their evil deeds may be obscured.\" This, I believe, is the real reason for secret societies; basically their deeds are evil. Th ere is no other explanation for the need of secrecy! There is no need to expound on the secret society which ran the French Re volution. By now all historians are agreed that it was the Masonic Jacobin Club. Here is what a very notable Grand Master of the Supreme Council of Scottish Rites, Domi nica Anger, had to say when confirming the 33 rd Degree upon newly qualified Masons about to receive it: Brother thou have finished thy instruction as a chief of Freemasonry.

That in a nutshell is the essence of what the Scottish Rite Freemason Order is all about and it is the Scottish Rite that dominates American Masonry. On e of the most interesting things about Communism, Freemasonry and the Jesuits is that they all have a notable figure in history connecting them — Karl Marx, the man who claimed Weisha upt teachings as his original \"manifesto.\" Marx fiercely (and often violently) defended the Jesuits throughout his life. Marx is th e connecting man. Marx also ardently supported the Freemason Secret Society, which is in my view a significant connection \"overlooked\" by nearly all historians. The overlooking is a deliberate process. That Socialism is being used to further the One World Government goal cannot be denied, and it is in teresting to note that Marx, an avowed hater of religion, should so passionately espouse Jesuitism. Ignatius Loyola founded the Je suit Order on April 5, 1541, which was later sanctioned by Pope Paul XI. It has something of a Masonic flavor to it, in that it consists of six grades or degrees with the head of the Order bein g known by militar y rank, i.e., a General, who demands absolute unswerving loyalty from all Jesuits and he in turn takes ab solute power in all matters over 76"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z each and every Jesuit. The General has the power to admit openly or secretly, persons who ar e not members of the Society. Superiors and Rectors are required to report to the General each week on all persons with whom they have had dealings or connections. The Jesuits are a powerful counter force against the Pope, a force they have never hes itated to use as they did during the Inquisition, from which the Jesuits distanced themselves as far as possible. Popes have al ways viewed the Jesuits with suspicion, so much so that in 1773 the Order was banned. In defiance of the Pope, Frederic II of Prussia protected the Jesuits for his own purposes. In case any reader should take exception to the connection made between the Jesuits and Freemasonry, let me say here that probably one of the best author ities on the matter is Heckethorn, and I am going to quote what he said: There is considerable analogy between the Masonic and Jesuit degrees; and the Jesuits also tread down the shoe and bare the knee because Ignatius Loyola thus presented himself at Rome and asked for the confirmation of the order. Not satisfied with confession, preaching and instruction, whereby they had acquired une xampled influence, they formed in Italy and France in 1563 several congregations, i.e., clandestine meetings in subterranean chapels and other secret places. The Segreg ationists had a sectarian organization with appropriate catechisms and manuals which had to be given up before death, wherefore very few copies remain. The Jesuits sought to help th e New World Order by strongly supporting such revolutionary person s as Karl Marx, who in turn fiercely defended the Jesuits as I said earlier.

Jeremy Bentham, a devil-worshi pping Satanist in the class of Albeit Pike, opposed Republicanism, as do all Freemason-Jesuit conspirators today. The rentier families who ran the world during Bentham's time saw danger in the freedom of man through a republican form of government, so they set about using every means at their disposal to nullify the great benefits accruing from the American Revolution. That struggle with Freemasonry is still going on today in 2009, but it is now in its final phase.

Albeit Pike declared himself totally opposed to a republican system with democratic principl es. One such method is through religious fanaticism, coupled with penetration of cults and religious orders. And it is not only a republican form of government they want to see de stroyed. They wish to see the whole United States returned to a feudal system in which the \"noble aristocrats\" of the Ea stern Establishment have full dictatorial powers. I have not come across any writ er in the U.S. \"conspiracy culture\" who has explained feudalism to my satisfaction. Those who have written about the subj ect only served to demonstrate their lack of knowledge of its tr ue meaning. With this in mind I take leave to enlarge on feudalism as it has a direct connection with Masonry. In the Dark Ages that ruled Eur ope for centuries, the individual was helpless. Preservation of life was the major factor and men pledged themselves in complete servitude to the strongest among them who in return woul d provide them protection from those who would prey upon them. The strong men pledged themselves to even stronger men, and out of this grew the feudal system. Men would pledge themselves to military service of the strongest group for given periods of time — say 50 days a year. 79"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman This led to the rise of a warrior class who became the nobility. They required armaments, horses and fortified places to afford protection which came through \"free\" labor. The fortified places grew from stockades to strong stone buildings, lofty in design and execution. Stone cutters, masons, smiths and iron workers, all had to donate free labor to the building of these super-structures. The prime source of wealth was the land and the labor of those who worked on it to produce goods that translated into wealth. The serf's condition changed very little over many centuries, some gradually becoming tenant farmers while making payments to the manor lord. Neither he nor his family could marry without the permission of the manor lord which usually involved payment of a fee. He was never a free man. The ever-present barrier to his freedom was the law that required him to remain where he was. In other words, he was not allowed to move. On death, his best farm animals went to the lord of the manor. Albert Pike and his fellow Masons promised \"complete freedom\" to all who would become members of Freemasonry. Albeit Pike's closest friend a nd collaborator was Giuseppe Mazzini (1805-1872), the Italian Mason leader who could not tolerate the industria l capitalist system. M azzini was a Satanist and also a Jesuit priest! Mazzini was the founder of the Young Europe league, which very soon opened up a branch in America called Young America. Karl Marx was one of the earliest members of the radical Freemasonic Mazzini movements starting in 1840, so it is quite clear that Freemasonr y created Karl Marx as a revolutionary figure championing th e workers, in order to use him as a club to beat industrial capitalism to death.

Marx also said: All evil must be laid at the door of industrial capital development. Marx never failed to preach this theme. I hope that you, the reader, can see just how much ha rm we have suffered because of the duplicity of Freemasonry and Jesuitism. Both movements remain at war with the U.S. This was part of the announced intentions of high-degree Masons such as Pike and Mazzini; to overthrow the existing order which Weishaupt set out to do in 1776, and ordered the Illuminati to carry out. The word \"imperialism\" was invented at the International Working Men's Association and began to be used quite frequently from 1890 onwards.

Why didn't someone do something to halt Rome's down ward slide? Why have we in America also failed to see that America is being degraded? Surely the people must see that the Eastern Liberal Establishment and its alliance with the British oligarchy are ruining this country?

In pouring scorn on the Monroe Doctrine, the Eastern Establishment, enemy of the people of America and its great Republic, also repudiated the 1812 victory over the British by the small and inadequate American Navy. That great American naval victory came after Swiss-born traitor, Gallatin (Secretary of the Treasury), had done everything in his power to prevent an American Navy being built at all. Gallatin served the British, Swiss and Genoese Black Nobil ity and their rentier-banker families and did all he could to strangle and choke the young American Republic to death.

Thus the Argentines had legal title to the Malvinas Islands. Yet George Bush, George Shultz and Alexander Haig, servants of the Eastern Establishment, spurned the memory of those brave Americans who defeated the British for the second time and through their treachery in helping the British to invade the Malvinas, tore up the Monroe Doctrine and once again made the U.S. subservient to British and European feudalists.

Let us not forget either that William Petty, the Earl of Shelburne, and I repeat this, was first and foremost a Freemason. Freemason rituals in the 33 rd Degree teach there is no God, but talk a great deal about the ancient evil cults. Mesopotamia and Egypt were the lands where thes e evil cult-were practiced, and carried by the Earl of Shelburne to the West and on which today's Club of Rome and A quarians are modeled, having existed since antiquity. They had no regard, no pity for a mother whose child was snatched away from her by the priests of Baal to be burned alive in the iron arms of Molok as a sacrifice to him. Those \"hunting and gathering soci eties,\" as they are known, are to be found in certain Freemason orders to this very day. And make no mistake about it, the cu lts are the very embodiment of all that is evil, cults like Dionys us, to which the mighty heads of Europe's royalty belong, Magna Ma ter, Isis, Astarte, the evil, vile Chaldean cult, and the Lucifer cult or the Lucifer Trust, lately called the Lucius Trust, to which Robert McNamara, Cyrus Vance and many of the Eastern Establishment notables belonged. (Let me say, there are many other cults to which several high- rank Freemasons belong ~ those connected to the One World Government order — and I shall touch on these as I proceed.) 90"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z But before detailing what the Freemason cultists of modern times are doing to bring about a One World New Order-Age of Aquarius \"Utopia,\" I want to go back to the historical Masonic figures of the American Revolution, the War between the States commonly known as the Civil War, and then continue on to more recent times. I hope to show you that a red lin e of hatred for the American Republic has run through our history for more than 250 years, and which hatred is stronger today than ever before, as America enters its final phase before the twilight of the New Dark Ages settles into blackness over the Earth and all its remaining inhabitants. Before going into some of these details, let me say that the hatred of Christianity is even stronger in 2008 than it was in the Middle Ages. It is worthy of mention that there is very little difference between the aims and objects of today's treacherous Eastern Establishment Freemasons and the policies of International Socialism. \"Our\" tr aitors have always cooperated with their counterparts in Ve nice. Indeed it was the \"blue bloods\" of America and those allied to the Black Guelph in Europe, particularly Lord Alfred Milner the Scottish Rite Mason, who created Vladimir Lenin. As I said earlier, the Bolshevik Revolution was not some obscure movement that succeeded in overthrowing and enslaving a major nation. Rather, it was the outcome of planning and plotting by Masons, which be gan in 1776 with the Jesuit- connected Adam Weishaupt's war against the Catholic Church. Not only did the plot to communi ze Russia come from the West, but also the vast fortune needed to carry it out! By contrast, when the American colonists embarked upon their struggle to free themselves from the yoke of bondage imposed on them by George III they were backed by no one but 91"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman themselves! The Catholic Church in Canada dominated by Jesuits and in whose ranks were to be found se veral Masons, played a key role in betrayi ng the American cause during the war of 1776 by aiding the traitor Aaron Burr, a one time U.S. Vice President, who reminds me of so many of our past Presidents. It was the Jesuit Catholics w ho arranged safe passage for Burr so that he could spy for the British. Another leading figure sent to America by the British-Swiss-Genoa heads of state was Albert Gallatin, a Freemason who inveigled his way into the power structure of the new young country and set about destroying it from the inside. His latter-day counterpart is Paul Volcker, formerly chairman of the Federal Reserve Board during one of the most turbulen t periods in U.S. history, and today, in 2009, the economic advisor to President Obama. William Shelburne, the Master Mason, master spy and mastermind of the French Revol ution, coordinated the activities of all of those engaged in the struggle to stamp out the dangerous new American Republic before it became a role model for the whole world. Amon g those enemies was Robert Livingston of the Continental Congress Committee. Shelburne arranged for the title of Leading Scottish Rite Mason to pass from his Grand Master, William Walter, who was in the British Army in 1783, to the new Grand Master, Livingston. Livingston was enthroned as Gran d Master of the Grand Lodge of New York, from which position he never ceased to work for the London-Venice-Genoa-Geneva families, who even today control the major wealth of this world. In this infamous circle was to be found Senators Hill house, Pickering, Tracy and Plummer, all of whom were Masons and who played a leadership role in trying to persuade their states to secede from the Union. As I said, they were all Freemasons, as was their confidant and co-plotter, Britis h Ambassador to the U.S., 92"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z Anthony Mary. When Burr, the Master Mason, was uncovered as a traitor because the plot to seize Louisiana for the British went awry, he fled to his Mason friends in England, just as Roberto Calvi fled to his Sc ottish Rite Mason friends in England. However, unlike Calvi, who was murdered by his so- called \"friends,\" Burr received a hero's welcome from the Earl of Shelburne. Incidentally, it was John Jacob Astor, who paid for Burr's trip. Astor fully agreed with what Shelburne believed in - worship of the satanic Chaldean cult, a cult so powerful that at one period of history it held the entire Persian Empire in its grip. The Chaldean cult is much condemned by the Christian Bible. The families in Britain, Genoa, Venice and Switzerland are the descendants of those who dir ected Freemason Shelburne to crush the young American Republic. Such opium trade-tainted families as Mallet, Pitt, Dundes, Gallatin, and in America, Livingston, Pickering, plus the nest of traitors at Harvard, form the core of the Eastern Establishment liberals and their antecedents who hate America and who fully intend to crush it, as Shelburne taught them to do 250 years ago. One of the most persistent in this endeavor was the English \"economist\" and leading Freemason, Thomas Malthus. Just as Marx was created by a European Jesuit-Masonry conspiracy, so also did they create Malthus. Malthus was a spy in the empl oy of the British East India Company, the British colonial raw materials, and asset-stripping organization comparable to day's International Monetary Fund. But the false economic premise for which Malthus became known was actually drafted by an other Freemason, Count Ortes, of the Ortes Venetian banking family.

The Black Nobility with their \"hunt and gather\" mentality believed that only enough of the common he rd should be saved to serve them. They believed in genocide, which is where the Club of Rome got its Global 2000 ideas. Ortes' s scribbling on behalf of the \"noble\" families were very anti-American, anti-Franklin and his ideas were taken up, expounded and expanded by other Freemasons such as Prime Mini ster William Pitt, and later by Malthus, after he received tutori ng and instruction from the Scottish Rite Freemason, Lord Shelburne. Malthus then wrote his work, On Population, as a direct contradiction of Franklin's work. 94"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z CHAPTER 18 MALTHUS AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN Malthus hated the work of Benjamin Franklin, who was despised by the same families to be found in that list of traitors, \"America's 60 Families,\" issued by Freemason Frederick Lundberg. These families think they are the \"be all and the end all\" of America. They think they have an inherent right to decide who shall live and who shall die and who shall decide the fate of America. The descendants of the 60 families struggled mightily to destroy the American Republic and crush every vestige of it underfoot. Their antecedents are doing the same thing today, continuing where their ancestors left off. Th is cult-ridden abscess must be excised from the body of America if we are to survive and the sooner the better. Most of the Americans I have spok en with have little idea of how great is the humiliation a nd shame we suffered through the Malvinas War, a shame we continue to suffer through the degradation of the war in Iraq, and rightly so. We ought to have stood up the British Freemasons and said \"no, we will never betray the memory of a great American patriot.\" Instead, we allowed the Freemasons in America and Britain to stomp all over John Quincy Adams' grave and to hold their ritual of triumph around his tombstone. I mourned the Malvinas betrayal then, and I do so now in 2009, with the betrayal of our honor in the war in Iraq. It is one of the darkest pages to be found in our history. We should not forget it. We should work to remove the 95"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman oligarch families and controllers of America's destiny out of the Malvinas and to restore it to its rightful owners, the people of Argentina. We should not rest until the memory of the 20,000 sailors of the American fleet, captured and enslaved by British Navy before the War of 1812, is avenged. As long as we allow the British \"noble families\" governance of the Malvinas, we can never again revere the name and the memory of a great American, John Quincy Adams. For as long as we fail to do so, we dare call ourselves a God-fearing Christian nation. Three betrayal s that rankle the most are Malvinas, South Africa and Zi mbabwe. I for one cannot rest while the perpetrato rs of those crimes remain unpunished; crimes which were planned and enacted by powerful elements of the Freemasonic movement, and carried out by their American servants in the U.S. government. It is the \"60 Families,\" the ancestors of the Eastern Liberals today, who fought against th e American Revolution and republicanism and who planned and caused one tragedy after another in the ensuing years, not the least of which is the cult- ridden, Satan-dominated United Nations. It is these families and their antecedents, which have given us the Masonic-Gnostic- Brahmin Illuminati-Isis, Osiris and Dionysus cults instead of the pure Gospel of Christ. These are the members of the Li beral Establishment. The people who gave us the ancient and accepted Scottish Rite (American) Freemasonry underground, established officially only in 1929, but actually founded in 1761, and so very, very active in its war against the young American nation. In passing I would say that the noted historian, Lady Queensborough, says that the rites are based on ancient Kabalistic origins. Albert Mackey, the man who exposed Masonry, said the following: 96"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z Masonry promises men salvation by ceremonies invented by men, administered by priests, and inhabited by devils. This is the sum and substance of all the false religions on Earth and will ultimately united them against Christ. But the only opponent Masonry dreads is Christ, who refused to worship Satan, and his followers. The \"salvation\" promised by Masonry almost led to the successful thwarting of the Am erican Republic in 1812 and in 1861, the terrible War between the States, the so-called \"Civil War,\" that took over 400,000 lives, which fact has never been emphasized by the Establishment historians (the only kind allowed in the U.S.). This terrible toll exceeds the number of Americans soldiers killed in th e First and Second World Wars! Think carefully about this fact, and memorize it because attempts are being made, to sweep these vital statistics under the carpet by our so-called \"historians.\" And what was the excuse for the War Between the States? Ostensibly, the war was fought to emancipate the negro, but the vast majority of us know now that it was for other reasons. It is interesting to note that the Northern slave trading families made their fortunes out of the very thing they condemned. They combined slave trading with opium running to China, and that is how the blue blood Oxford and the Harvard graduates and the \"noble\" families in and around Boston, amassed their \"old\" money, and in which drug trade their descendants are still involved, today. However, I must leave the stench of slavery and the opium trade and the \"Olympians\" and the dope drenched \"ruling class\" and get onto the main subject at hand. Let me say again in passing, that every one of the families who think of themselves as the elite \"royal families\" of America made their money out of the opium and slave trade.

Mr. Lundberg, of course, would never dream of exposing his famous clients. I want now to move on to later events following the Civil War, which was instigated and run by a Freemason conspiracy from the beginning to the end, through such people as Caleb Cu shing and Lloyd Garrison. There is no doubt that the instigators of the conspiracy to wreck America, which culminated in th e War Between the States, were all Scottish Rite Freemasons on bot h sides of the conflict. It is worth mentioning in passing that the assassination of President Lincoln was also a Jesuit-Freemason plot. Those Masons allied to the Venetian Black Nobility families, the Contarini and the Pallavicini, and the Jesuit spy network could not have murdered Lincoln without the connivance of the Eastern Establishment families and the Cecil family in England. Thus, Robert Fludd's Rosicrucia n Jesuit cult triumphed over the American people, their Constitution and their Republic, and reveled in the murder of the Pres ident as one of their \"trophies.\" What then was the motive behind the Freemason conspiracy to destroy the United States and establish a One World Government? The motive was hatred, deep and fanatical hatred of the republic ideal, the idea that men could be free of serfdom and the feudalistic power exer cised by the Old Venetian, Genoese and British families. The very notion that under a re publican form of government, men are free to challenge any decision they do not agree with by exercising their vote, was utterly repugnant to these self-styled rulers. They felt as they still do, that the sole right to decide the fate of the common man rests with them. That is why the Christian religion, with its emphasis on individual freedom, is the target of their hatred and why so many of those old families loved the slave trade and the opium trade as they do the dope trade today.

As Prince Metternich once said: \"For me, mankind begins with barons.\" Incidentally, Metternich was the hero and role model for Henry Kissinger. These old families could act thus because they do not believe in a real and living God! It is true they will from time to time pay lip service to God and Christianity, as we see in the case of the British Royal Family. But they do not believe that God exists! More than that, this interlocking force of Eastern Establishment families, the Jesuit-Scottish Rite Rosicrucian banking families of Venice, London, Genoa, Boston, Geneva, Lausanne, Berne, etc. hate with an almost violent obsession, a mercantile society based on industrial growth and technology, resting on industrial capitalism. The motivating force, the reason for a One World conspiracy such as we see in its visible elements, the Club of Rome, the Mont Pelerin Society, the Cini Foundation, the Bilderbergers, and the Trilateral Commission, the Royal Society for International Affairs, the Council on Foreign Relations and the Aquarians, is the destruction of the Christian religion first, followed by other religions (particularly the Muslim religion) and an end to industrial growt h, destruction of technology and a return to feudalism and the Ne w Dark Ages, coupled with a huge reduction in population that their plans require, because the millions of \"useless eaters\" will no longer be needed in a postindustrial society. My many \"Firsts\" include work s on the Bellagio inter-religious conference, the Global 2000 Report, an expose of the existence of the most secret Freemason lodge, the Quator Coronati Lodge, and the Club of Rome, zero growth and a Post Industrial Society; the plot to launch a Holy War in Jerusalem, starting with an attack on the Dome of the Rock Mosque. 99"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Other exposures include Who Murdered President John F.

As I predicted 20 years ago, the steel industry, shipbuilding, mach ine tooling and the footwear industries have all been destroye d; the same thing is happening in Europe. As for the Global 2000 Report, by refusing food to the starving nations of Africa, millions of black Africans died. Thousands have also died of the HIV-AIDS virus. Limited wars declared desirable and necessary by arch-Satanist, Freemason Bertrand Russell and \"Dr. Strangelove\" Leo Szilard, and his Shakti Ishtar devil-worshipping cult are in progress in Iran, Central America, South Africa, the Middle East and the Philippines etc. My answer is that the Christia n Bible reads: \"God looked down upon them (the pre-Adamites) and saw that they had not prospered.\" God sent us to help these people to perform their function on Earth, whatever it may be, and I have no idea what it is, but not to murder them. Szilard and his friend, Bertrand Russell, bemoaned the fact that wars had not got rid of enough people as described in Russell's 1923 work, Prospects of Industrial Civilization, from wh ich the following extract is taken: Socialism, especially International Socialism, is only possible as a stable system if the population is stationary or nearly so. A slow increase might be coped with by improvements in agricultural methods, but a rapid increase must in the end reduce the whole population.

If a Black Death (the middle Ages and HIV plague) could spread through the world once in every generation, the survivors coul d procreate freely, without making the world too full. The State of Affairs might be unpleasant, but what of it? Really high-minded people are indifferent to happiness, especi ally other people's happiness. A self-described peacemaker, Russell was a false prophet of Masonry and the leader of the CND, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He was the voice of the prophet of the Jesuit-Freemason- Rosicrucian-Black Nobility-Ameri can Eastern Establishment. These self-styled rulers of the world become so arrogant that sometimes, they can no longer remain silent. Just note the reference to the Black Plague that swept the world in the middle Ages. The plague was no \"Act of God\" since, of course, God is not a murderer, although we often blame Him for the deaths of people, but in my opinion, based on 30 years of research, it was a deliberate act by the antecedents of today's \"Olympians\" the \"Club of 300.\" This is no far-fetched theory. True, I have not yet proved it, but there are too many pointers and straws in the wind to ignore it.

For centuries Freemasonry has striven to pass the movement off as fully compatible with Christianity. \"There is no bar against a Mason being a Christian\" is one of Masonry's oldest claims. In this book, I will attempt to draw comparisons between what I call New Testament Christianity and its most daunting enemy, Freemasonry. What evidence I have been able to gather comes mainly from relatives of Ma sons and ex-Masons, who spoke with me on condition that they not are identified. Those who break the Mason Oath of Secrecy know that the supreme penalty for such transgression is, more often than not, death. There have literally been thous ands of books written for and against Masonry. The Catholic C hurch has been steadfast and resolute in its opposition to Masonry. Protestant churches have unfortunately not been as unite d against this dangerous enemy as they should be. I shall be dealing with more recent investigations into Masonry. In 1952, I came across a very interesting article entitled, Dar kness Visible, by Walton Hannah. This book is invaluable to any pers on seeking to pierce the veil of secrecy which has protected Masonry for so many centuries. The same author, Walton Hannah, later published a paper, Should a Christian be a Fr eemason? A Mason inside Christianity, the Reverend R.C. Meredith, accepted this challenge to the secrets of Masonry. Very boldly, the Reverend Meredith challenged the church to prove that a Mason could also be a Christian. 103"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Meredith, who studied at Oxford, moved in leftist circles and took part in various pro-left de bates, which where very popular in the 1930's. It was the period in British history when it was chic to be a Socialist, when Fabian socialism was off and running, when it was fashionable to work for the Soviet Union, the same period that gave us Bu lwer, Lytton, Alfr ed Milner and Kim Philby. The Milner Group eventually transformed itself into what today is called the R oyal Institute for International Affairs (RIIA). The Reverend Meredith boldly introduced a proposal that an Anglican Church enquiry be launched into Masonry. His proposal to the 1951 Church Assembly read as follows: That in view of the widespre ad publicity which has been given to he article by Walton Hannah, a Commission be appointed, including among its members persons learned in the science of Comparative Religions, to examine the statements made by Mr. Hannah in that article, the attention of the House of Bishops should be directed to anything therein set forth. It is very interesting to note that Meredith refers to Masonry, however obliquely, as a religion. So confident was Meredith that his resolution would be a dopted, and Masonry given a whitewash by the hundreds of A nglican hierarchy Masons who occupy powerful positions inside th e Church, that he didn't even bother to place any constraints upon the proposed enquiry. This was highly unusual. When Masons permit the Church to conduct an enquiry into their secret society, it is generally under the most severe restrictions that make the outcome a foregone conclusion; Masonry and the Christian Church are indeed compatible. Since Walton Hannah's work was published in 1952, in the various General Synods of the Anglican Church, there has been a growing concern regarding the true nature of Masonic oaths, the need for secrecy, which is such an integral 104"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z part of Masonry, the true role of Masonry and the scope of its general and secret activities. Those who seek to blow the lid off Masonry and expose its dark secrets often quote General Ludendorf. More latterly, Masonry has been described as a \"type of Mafia\" or \"the only wa y to make rapid progress for anyone in commerce or in government.\" When real progress was being made in this direction, i.e. when Church enquiries looked like succ eeding, the jackals of the press cried \"witch hunt.\" To talk about Masonry in its true colors, to rip the mask from off the be nign face of Masonry, became a risky business. Masonry always answered allegations about abuses and excuses laid at its door as \"only one example of a bad case among millions of examples of the good that Masonry does.\" The sinister mafia aspects of Masonry were never openly discussed which explains why Masonry was so bold about Meredith's resolution; they knew it would pass-muster, and it did. Stephen Knight's book, The Brotherhood; the Secret World of Masonry, published in 1984, immediately ran into that kind of response. Critics, literary and religious leaders branded this excellent work as \"badly resear ched, full of unconfirmed data.\" To attempt to describe Masonry is an onerous task. One can say it is the largest fraternal order in the world with unofficially close to 3.5 million members in the U.S. alone. Over 50,000 books and shorter works have been written on the subject since 1717 when Masonry first announced itself. It has aroused more hatred th an any other secular body in the world. Men of the Mormon and Cat holic faiths cannot join it. It is outlawed in a few countries. Masonry was declared illegal by Hitler and Mussolini and later, by General Franco.

Garfield, Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft , Warren C. Harding, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. Masons in the music field included the composer of \"St. Louis Blues\" William Handy, John Philip Sousa, Gilbert and Sullivan, Sibelius and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who was murdered for revealing Mason secrets in \"The Magic Flute.\" Not one of the Knight's critics pointed out that Masonry never confirms data about its darker si de, its malevolently evil deeds, and its effect upon the course of history. Mazzini, at times, appeared to confirm some of th e evils and misdeeds of Masonry in international geopolitics, but only in the historical context, data already known; alluding al ways to the influence of Masonry upon such events, but never confirming its role in a clinically scientific way. To discredit Knight's claim of undue influence in high places in government and the Metropolitan Police Department and especially into the Criminal Investigate Department (CID), and his contention that in excess of 90% of its detective force are Freemasons, one of the highest officers of the Scottish Rite, Lord Hailsham, was chosen by the Grand Council of England to rebut Knight's totally correct charges. The Lord Chancellor of England, using the power and ma jesty of his office, wrote a letter to the London Times newspaper, ridiculing and belittling Knight's expose. Hailsham's office of patronage was 106"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z overstaffed with \"favored Masons.\" Because such an august person as Hailsham had written to the venerable institution the Times, the public accepted that Hailsham's denials on behalf of Masonry were right and that Kn ight was wrong. Knight's well- founded charges were effectively refuted. By this not-so-subtle means does Masonry protect its ow n. To say that Knight didn't present confirmed data and could therefore be disregarded, was proof of how powerful and all pervading is Freemasonry. This applies equally to the United Stat es of America, Italy, France and Germany. Offering the case of Roger Holli s as proof that Knight was inaccurate, Freemasonry cites Hollis, head of MI5 during the Second World War, as being a Mason. Hollis was indeed a Mason, who gave vital military secrets to the Soviet Union. He was the subject of an elaborate attempt by Freemasonry to stifle publication of the work of a nother good author, Peter Wright, whose book exposed the duplic ity of Roger Hollis. Hollis was a man who delivered American and British Military Secrets to the Soviets, and he was a Freemason for most of his adult life. I am only able to re fer briefly to this man and his betrayal of U.S. and British to the Soviet Union. As Wright could not be discred ited through letters to the Times, an attempt was made by the \"James Bond\" SIS team to silence him - permanently. Wright fled to Australia where people in high places protected him. Wright did all he could to get his expose of Roger Hollis published in Australia, but the long arm of Scottish Rite Masonry reached out from Britain and by the most dubious and convoluted reason ing, the Attorney General of Britain went to Australia to argue in Australian courts against the book being published there.

The book was scheduled to be printed in Canada, and in a few months later, in Australia On this occasion, Freemasons were not successful in preventing the truth from coming out. Meanwhile in London, three newspapers defied British censorship and began publishing extracts from Wrights book. Press censorship in Britain is carried out most effectively through the use of what is calle d \"D Notices.\" If the Home Secretary deems any book, story or article harmful to the state or not in the interest of the country, then publishers, magazine editors, newspapers and so on, re ceive a \"D Notice\" restraining them from publishing that part icular story named in the \"D Notice.\" If the \"D Notice\" is disregarded, the Attorney General has the right to prosecute offenders and the courts will generally impose severe sentences on the offender or offenders. Such is the right of \"free spee ch\" and \"freedom of the press\" protected in Britain. Three L ondon newspapers were placed under indictment for disobeying the \"D Notice\" they received prohibiting them from publishing Wright's work. The Attorney General described their conduct in exercising their right to \"freedom of the press\" as a deliberate and gross flouting of the Law. All those who were involved in opposing Wright were Freemasons of the highest degree who strove mightily to protect a deceased 33 rd Degree Mason from to tal exposure. \"Poorly researched, lacking in confirmed data?\" Possibly, but present events, which later become history, can seldom, if ever, be \"confirmed.\" We all know the truth about the assassination of John F.

Only \"discredited\" ex-Masons, who are of course written off as liars or worse! Page it seems, if precedent is anything to go by, must have been a Lodge member, long before he became Commissioner of Police. Then there is the case of permanent officers of government in the financial heart of the world, the City of London. Knight and others, including myself, are well aw are of the fact that its most influential members are leadings Freemasons. Yet when Knight actually dared to name these men, it was officially denied, not that they weren't Masons, but that they had not attended meetings of the Guildhall Lodge on the dates mentioned by Knight. Because of their high rank, the Masons were believed rather than Knight, who was subsequently accused of \"gross inaccuracies.\" I have digressed into the subject of providing \"documentary proof and \"confirmed data\" in the face of Masons in positions of great power and influence, who close ranks when attacked. \"Factual inaccuracies \" is how the Guildhall Lodge members disposed of Mr. Knight's expose of how the Mason Brotherhood controls the City of London — and Westminster for that matter. Knight provides a convinci ng explanation of how Mason registers of English Lodges worldwide are \"sealed\" against investigators.

Another very good expose of Freemasonry is the paper written and published by Walton Hannah called, Darkness Visible, which came under the most severe attack not only by leading Mason members under the hierarchy of the Anglican Church, but by so-called literary critic s and self-appointed \"experts,\" there to defend Masonry. Any enquiry into the provenance of initiation texts and rituals used by Freemasonry, would on its own be a work of a life time and would probably, even then, be dubbed as \"lacking in confirmed data\" by a united and aroused Brotherhood of Masonry. My in-depth study of Masonry over the past thirty years has taught me a great deal a bout the \"Brotherhood,\" more particularly that to fully documen t even the initiation oaths, texts and rituals of initiation, would take the combined efforts of several genuinely accredited e xperts on comparative religions. Thus, by the very nature of such a vast undertaking, Masonry has always been able to continue to draw a cloak of secrecy about itself, which is hard to penetrate. To make a case against the sinister brotherhood is exceedingly difficult. Many have tried with va rying degrees of success, but in general, it is true to say that notwithstanding the scores of outstanding books, which have expo sed Masonry for what it is, Masonry emerged relatively unscathed.

There are a number of works, which point out that \"charitable work\" such as street collections in aid of various charities, are really not charitable at all, since it is the public and not Freemasonry that donates the money. Were Mason Lodges to publically and consistently cont ribute large sums of money to charitable institutions, its benevolen t face might not be the mask that it truly is. It is true to say that most informed members of the public never ask the question \"why do we allow such an ultra-secret society to operate in our midst a nd, what goes on behind its closed doors?\" It cannot be otherwise, for how can the lady whose husband goes off to Lodge meetings know anything about Masonry's strict secrecy laws, its Craft De grees and the Holy Royal Arch, let alone its \"omerta\" sealed lip s policy. Should she be of an enquiring mind and ask probing questions, her husband would tell her only about the sumpt uous banquets and fund-raising activities for charity, but more than this, she would not learn anything.

Masonry has never given a proper answer to the three W's where, why when and where did Freemasonry originate? Masons have always categorically denied that it wa s formed to be a counter to Christianity and that it is not a religion, but their denials wear thin as we shall presently begin to see. John Hamill, a master apologist for Masonry and its Librarian and Curator of the Grand Lodge Library and Museum, states: Modern Lodges are very much like those which existed in the 17 th Century. His idea of Mason history is as follows: The Grand Lodge of En gland was formed on 24 th June 1717, and a rival Ancients Grand Lodge was formally constituted in 1751; and that these two rival Grand Lodges joined together on 27 th December 1713, to form the United Grand Lodge of England, much as we know it today.

In early 1850's, the Grand Lodge of England published a pamphlet, What ev ery candidate should know, which says inter alia: Freemasonry is a society of men historically linked together with medieval operative Masons, from whom they derive their private means of recogni tion, their ceremonial, and many of their customs. Its members adhere to ancient principles of Brotherly love (a Marxist idea — JC) relief and truth not only among themselves but also in their relations with the world at large and by ritual percepts and example. Now if that explains anything in a truly meaningful manner, then I confess that it's true m eaning escape me. Librarian Hamill however, tries to give a more de tailed \"explanation\" by saying: The candidate for initiation lear ns very early in his Masonic career that the basic principles of Freemasonry are brotherly love, relief and truth. He then goes on to attempt to equate Marxism with brotherly love by stating: Brotherly love in its sense of the promotion of tolerance and respect for the beliefs and idea ls of others, and the building of a world in that respects tolerance togeth er with kindness and tolerance and understanding. Relief is not in the sense of monetary giving only nor limited to it, but giving in the widest sense of the word, ch aritable giving of money, (but never their own - JC) time and e ffort to assist the community as a whole.

Every Freemason spokesman denies that the secret society is a religion. In 1985, the Board of the General Purposes of the United Grand Lodge publ ished a pamphlet entitled, Freemasonry and Religion. Among other denials, the Board states as follows: Freemasonry is not a religion, nor is it a substitute for religion. Freemasonry lacks th e basic elements of a religion, but is far from indifferent to religion. Without interfering in religi ous practice it expects each member to follow his own faith and to place above all other duties the duty to his God, by whatever name He is known. Freemasonry is thus a supporter of religion. A Working Group of the Grand Lodge stated further: Freemasonry knows that its r ituals do not amount to the practice of religion. A more bold and barefaced lie is difficult to imagine. Not only is Masonry a religion, it is very definitely an anti-Christian religion aimed at the dest ruction of Christianity. 115"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman ■ How can Masonry justify its claim to be a non-religion when its rituals are centered and based upon altars, temples and chaplains? ■ Why are prayers recited, such as the prayer explicitly stated as such in Mason literature, in the Emulation Ritual for the First Degree?

Almighty Father and Supreme Governor of the Universe, to our present convention and grant that this candidate for Freemasonry may so dedicate and devote his life to Thy service as to become a true and faithful brother among us.

The name of Jesus is always very specifically excluded. As Christ our Lord says in His Gospels: He who is not for Me, is against Me. There is another prayer in the Third Degree which invokes the blessing of God and of Heaven upon the new member: Almighty and Eternal God, Architect and Ruler of the Universe, at whose creative fiat all things were first made. Masonry is most careful in that while it makes liberal use of Christian prayers, which are easily recognized as such, it scrupulously avoids all Christian references. By this singular action of excluding the name of Christ from its \"prayers\" Masonry denies the very existence and authority of Jesus. If as Masons aver it is not a religion well and good; but, why copy Christian prayers and then delete absolutely the name of Christ? Does not such conduct indicate th at Masonry is anti-Christ? I firmly believe that Masonry stands for anti- Christ behavior, and moreover, this is the answ er to the \"why\" masonry was established in the first place! In support of my claim that Masonry is an anti-Christ religion, I offer the Opening Ceremony of the Royal Arch prayer which goes like this: Omnipotent God unto whom all h earts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid, cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the in spiration of Thy Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love Thee and magnify Thee.

By excising the name of Christ from this prayer Masons demonstrate their disregard of Ch rist. They are therefore to be counted in the ranks of the anti-Christ forces of Satan. The Closing Ceremony of the R oyal Arch also makes use of a well-known Christian prayer, namel y, \"Glory be to God on High on Earth, peace and Goodwill toward s men,\" but fails to mention that these words are taken from the Gospel of Our Lord Jesus Christ. In my mind and in the mi nds of many serious students of Freemasonry, the foregoing examples of religious activities voids Masonry's claim that it is not a religion, and proves to the world, that it indeed is a religion. The Grand Lodge responded to a challenge from me by saying: . . . As Freemasonry is not a religion or a substitute for it, there is no reason why the name of Christ should be mentioned in its rituals. The answer to this denial is su rely to pose another question: \"If what you say is correct, that Masonry is not a religion, why then have you taken prayers from the Christian Bible, why do you constantly refer to temples and alters, and why do you, while using phrases from the Christian Bible deny the very existence of Jesus Christ by cutting out Hi s name from every one of the prayers you have copied from Hi m?\" There is never a doubt that Mason \"prayers\" are frequently based on Christian liturgies. Why then does Masonry deny that it is a religion, and why does Masonry assiduously delete the name of Christ from its Christian-copied prayers? Prayers are an integral part of Mason rituals, so how can Masonry deny that it is a religion? Masons say that their prayers contain no element of worship.

No one, with th e exception of perhaps Alice in Wonderland can believe that Mason prayers are distinguishable from \"worship.\" Which raises another vital point? Even if Mason insistence upon such distinctions of \"prayer\" and \"worship\" and \"non-religion\" could be accepted, and clearly it cannot be so, the deliberate omission of the name of Christ and the Gospels of Jesus Christ fr om whence their \"prayers\" came, plus the omission of the Christian basic cornerstone belief that none come to God save and except through our Lord Jesus Christ, is a slight and an a ffront to the Christian religion. It denies the Divinity of Christ. No doubt about it. How then can men who claim to be Christians al so be Masons? Christ said one \"cannot serve two masters.\" By accepting Mason ritual, Masons in effect also deny His existence. It follows that one cannot be for Him, while at the same time being against Him! There is absolutely no way that Freemasonry can deny that it is \"neither a religion nor a substitute for religion.\" The evidence to the contrary is overwhelming! Nor can Mason defenders bring evidence to show that by exclud ing the name of Christ they are not rejecting Him, because it is not merely a case of deliberate exclusion, it is a case of delib erate insult by omission. Masonic apologists tell us \"our prayers ar e not acts of worship but merely a request for blessing at th e opening of our rituals and a returning of thanks at the close for blessings received.\" How does this differ from religious worship? The obvious fact is that it does not! Mason rituals everlastingly invoke the name of God, often in distinctive terms, such as Great Architect of the Universe (as in the First Degree); Grand Geometrician (Second Degree); the Most High, the Almighty and the Eternal God (Third Degree); the Supreme Being.

Who are these Gods? 119"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Does Masonry worship a Supreme Being, or as it sometimes says, only a belief in a Supreme Being? There would be no Mason rituals without involving a Divine name. The Freemason pamphlet I referred to earlier, Free-masonry of Religion published by the Masonic Board for General Purposes, glosses over the Masonic God by stating: Freemasons meet in common re spect for the Supreme Being as He remains Supreme for their individual religions and it is no part of Freemasonry to join religions together. Since the Western World is Chri stian whether some like it or not. Masonry must have great probl ems with a neutral inter-faith service. We, as Christians, cannot escape the very essence of our religion, namely that Christ is preeminent as the Son of God. Masonry says it does not wish to \"offend\" other religions. How does it do this if it excludes the na me of Christ? Is it excluded so that it does not offend the B'nai Brith (Sons of the Covenant) Jewish Freemasonry? Masonry has sought for hundreds of years to avoid \"giving offence\" to other religions, but does not hesitate to offend Christians by excising the name of Christ from its ritual prayers. \"Inter-faith\" services can only be successful where Christianity takes second place. It follows therefore that Christians cannot be Masons; either they must approv e of Christianity downgraded or else resign from Masonry. Befo re Masons reach the exalted heights of the higher Degrees, many believe that while praying they are praying to the God of their religion. But once they reach the \"closed shop\" of the Mason Hierarchy, there is no doubt but that their prayers are expressly directed to Satan. Christianity has no secrets!

We hear so many times \"compound words,\" \"I am and I shall be.\" Freemasonry says it is not obliged to support Christianity.

The ceremonies of the Holy Arch, perhaps more than any other ceremony, employ \"sacred words.\" The center-piece of the Holy Arch Ceremonies is the pedestal - the Alter on top of wh ich appear the \"sacred words.\" It is clear that despite its protestations to the contrary. Freemasonry is a religion when the explanation of the Sacred Words takes place. Here it is beyond dispute that Masonry is a religion in opposition to Christianity. Let us examine the Ritual of the Royal Arch, which is the climax of what is cal led \"Craft Masonry:\" It is intimately blended with all that is nearest and dearest to us in a future state of existence; divine and human affairs are interwoven so awfully and minutely in all its disquisitions. It has virtue for its aim; the Glor y of God for its object, and the eternal welfare of man is cons idered in every part, every point and letter of its ineffabl e mysteries. Suffice to say, that it is founded on the Sacred Name, J-----h, who was from the beginning, is now and will remain one and the same forever, the Being necessarily existing in and from Himself in all actual perfection, original in His essence. This Supreme Degree inspires its members with the most exalted ideas of God, leads to the purest and most devout piety, a reverence for the incomprehensible J-----h, the eternal Ruler of the Universe, the elemental and primordial source of all its principles, the very spring a nd fount of all its virtues. 121"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman The \"mystery\" word \"J-----h\" is Jabulon, a \"sacred\" name.

The Duke of Connaught and Duke of Kent are believed to be members of both Orders. The Gra nd Master of the Grand Lodge of England, the Duke of Connaug ht was a master for twenty years.

Now, again, we note the strong allusion to religion. \"Every English Lodge at its consecration is dedicated to God and His service; no one can become a Mason until he has declared his faith in the Suprem e Being,\" the General Secretary wrote in 1905. Masonry took th e offensive again in 1938 because of increasing disquiet a bout its activities. Here again, belief in the Supreme Being was paramount. The General Secretary said in his 1938 statement: The Bible is always open in the Lodges. It is called, The Volume of the Sacred Law. Every candidate is required to take his Obligation on that book, or on the Volume which is held by his particular creed to im part sanctity to an oath or promise taken upon it. This implies that the Bible is probably not the only \"sacred volume\" on display. The Bible is for purely decorative purposes and is there for members in the lower degrees (from the First to the Fourth Degrees). As all se rious students of Masonry will know, secret societies became all the fashion in the 17 th Century, in much the same way, as it was chic to be a Socialist in the late 1920's-early 1930's. Right up to April 1747, Masons still paraded through city streets, bu t following an order from the Grand Master, thereafter they we nt underground. As far back as 1698, a pamphlet was circulated ca lled, To All Godly People in City of London, it exhorted readers: . . . to take care le st their ceremonies and secret swearing take hold of you; and be wary that none cause you to err from Godliness; for this devilish Sect of Men Meet in Secret.

It is the same then as it is now, signs, grips, and words used to prove membership. These secret signs are said to have emanated from medieval stone masons, who swore never to pass their skills on to \"outsiders,\" and were recognized as fellow-craftsmen by certain handshakes-grips, etc. Nothing has changed. Although it is unlikely that any stonemasons are in Freemasonry today, their \"grips\" and handshakes remain the premier recognition sign. But Masonry today is more than that; it is a very sinister secret society in which members are sworn to secrecy by deadly Oaths of the most chilling kind. Clearly no Christian Society woul d enforce a code of silence by threatening its members with horrible death if the code were breached. Masonry may deceive the members in the Lower Degrees to believe it is based on Christianity, but in 1723, Dr. James Anderson, a Presbyterian Minister-Mason said: This now thought more expedien t to oblige them (members of the Brotherhood) to that Religion which all men agree, leaving their particular opinions to themselves. In 1813 the Grand Lodge stated its position as follows: Let a man's religion or mode of worship be what it may, he is not excluded from the order, provided he believes in the glorious architect of Heaven and Earth and practice the sacred duty of morality. Thus was established a comprehensive outlook toward religions, which is totally at war with Christianity.

But the vast majority of Freemasons never get \"raised\" above the Third Degree or Fourth Degrees. The fi rst three degrees definitely account for the bulk of Mason membership. The so-called Higher Degrees are also known as \"Further Degrees,\" from Secret Master to Grand Inspector General, and in England are controlled by their own Supreme Council resident in Duke Street, St James London.

These Master Masons are usually \"talent-spotted\" early by the Se cret Master who attends various Lodge meetings \"incognito\" for that purpose. Only an insignificant number of Freemasons who take the step beyond the Third Degree ever get as far as the mid-point 18 th Degree, i.e. Knight of the Pelican and Eagle, and Sovereign Prince Rose Croix of Heredom.

After intensive treatment and the laying on of hands by trained priests of the Anglican Church and exhortations by them in the name of Jesus, the disturbing images vanished as soon as he left Freemasonry, and he has never had a recurrence of the images and feelings.

When a Worshipful Master is raised and installed, he receives a warning about the penalty that will certainly follow if he breaks any Oaths and Vows: To have the right hand struck off and slung over the left shoulder there to wither and decay. 131"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman At the initiation ceremony of Exaltation to the Royal Arch of Masonry, the initiate is clearly wa rned that the penalty attached to the Obligation is \"that of suffe ring the loss of life by having my head-struck off.\" Nowadays, such direct statements do not appear. Instead the punishments are related in symbols and letters. This has come about only since 1979 when the Grand Master stated that it was no l onger \"suitable\" to express the penalties in their present form. Th e important thing to remember is that the penalties have not changed! What has changed is that they are now concealed from outsiders! Thousands of books, both pro and con have been written attempting to answer the question. As a serious student of Freemasonry with thirty years of in-depth research to my credit, my answer is that Freemasonr y may be described in the following terms: ■ It is most definitely a closed secret society, which, for reasons unknown is permitted to function in a free and open society such as a Western Christian Democracy. ■ Freemasonry is very definitely a religion based on cults and satanic worship. It is an ti-Christ and anti-Christian and long ago dedicated itself to eradicating the Christian faith, although this aim is carefully concealed from the bulk of its membership, especially those in the first three Degrees. ■ It is revolutionary in character and objectives. It is well known that Freemasonry was responsible at least for the planning stages of the French Revolution. ■ Freemasonry stands for the overthrow of the existing order of things, and all religions save one. Freemasonry demands absolute obedience to its Oaths. 132"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Freemasonry from A-Z The penalties for failing to observe the secrecy Oath or \"betraying\" Mason secrets are severe and include death by hanging in extreme cases. Other lesser physical punishment is frequently meted out to t hose whose break the Oaths. ■ Freemasonry, while pretending to obey the laws of the country, works silently to change laws it deems undesirable. ■ Freemasons are to be found in the highest seats of power in governments of all countries, as well as in the private sector, business and commerce. As such, Freemasonry is an uncontrolled force wieldi ng immense power that can, and has changed the course of history. ■ Freemasonry is a moral, ethical and philanthropic society only up to the 3 rd Degree. The vast majority of Freemasons never progress beyond the 3 rd Degree and are therefore unaware of th e true nature, aims and objectives of Freemasonry. ■ Freemasonry is a government operating within an elected government to the detr iment of the latter. ■ The charitable aspect of Free masonry is a mask and has no credibility, bordering as it does on deception. It is a mask and a cover for Masonry's true objectives. ■ Freemasonry has done an immense amount of harm to the cause of Christianity and is responsible for the loss of millions of lives in wars and revolutions ever since the French Revolution burst upon France. ■ The final test is whether it is compatible with Christianity? 133"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman ■ Can Christians also be Masons? To both questions, the answer is a resounding no! I have had claims that Washington DC has many Mason structures built as public or government buildings, and that its layout is in the form of a pentagram. It is difficult to prove or disprove some of the claims, but one building that app ears to fit the Mason claim is the Pentagon. The pentagon is an occult symbol. The building was designed by John Whiteside Parsons, a professed Satanist. The architect was George Bergstro m, but it is not known if he had any connection to Masonry. The true secrets of Masonry may never be revealed to mankind and thus it is very difficult for a writer to escape criticism while examining a subject as complex as Masonry. But that does not mean that no attempt should be made. If any of the claims I have ma de are wrong, then I am indeed apologetic, for they are not written in a spirit of blind meanness, and it is hoped that Masons who are better qualified than I am will point these out, so that they may be corrected. 134"}]
