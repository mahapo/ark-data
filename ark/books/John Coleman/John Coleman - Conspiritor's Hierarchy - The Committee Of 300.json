What I saw filled me with anger and resentment and launched me on a course from which I have not deviated, namely to uncover w hat power it is that controls and manages the British and United States governments. I was thoroughly familiar with all of the well kn own secret societies such as the Royal Institute for Internati onal Affairs (RIIA), the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Bilderb ergers, Trilaterals, the Zionists, Freemasonry, Bolshevism- Rosicrucianism and all of the spinoffs of these secret societies. As an intelligence officer, and even before that as a young student in the course of my studies at the British Museum in London, I had c ut my eye teeth on all of them, plus a good number of others with whom I imagined Americans were familiar. But when I came to the United States in 1969, I f ound that names like the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, Club of Rome the German Marshall Fund, the Cini Foundation, the Roun d Table, the Fabianists, the Venetian Black Nobility, the Mont P elerin Society, Hellfire Clubs, and many others were at best totall y unknown here, or else their true functions were at best but poorl y understood, if at all. In 1969-1970 set about remedying the situation in a series of monographs and cassette tapes. Much to my surpri se I soon found plenty of people willing to quote these names as if they had known of them all of their writing careers, but who were not in the least bit knowledgeable about the subjects, yet qui te unwilling to state the source of their lately acquired informati on.

This has led many to seek the truth in the alternat ive press, those newsletter writers who, like me, have sought, but n ot always found what it is that is making the United States t erminally ill. \"Seek and ye shall find\" has not always been the ca se with this group. What we did find was that the people walk in great darkness, mostly not caring or bothering to find ou t where their country is headed, firm in the belief that it will always be there for them. This is the way the largest population group has been manipulated to react, and their attitude plays righ t into the hands of the secret government. We frequently hear about \"they \" doing this, that or the other. \"They\" seem literally to be able to get away with murder. \"They\" increase taxes, send our sons and daughters to die in wars that do not benefit our country. \"They\" seem above our reach, out of sight, frustratingly nebulous when it comes to t aking action against \"them.\" No one seems able to clearly identi fy who \"they\" are. It is a situation that has pertained for decad es. During the course of this book, we shall identify the mysterio us \"they\" and then, after that, it is up to the people to remedy their situation. On 30th April 1981, I wrote a monograph disclosin g the existence of the Club of Rome identifying it as a C ommittee of 3OO subversive body. This was the first mention of both of these organizations in the United States. I warned reader s not to be fooled by the feeling that the article was far-fetc hed and I drew a parallel between my article and the warning issued by the Bavarian government when the secret plans of the Il luminati fell into its hands. We shall return to the Club of Rome and the role of the Committee of 300 in U.S. affairs later herein. Many of the predictions made in that 1981 article have since come to pass, such as the unknown Felipe Gonz alez becoming prime minister of Spain, and Mitterand bei ng returned to power in France; the downfall of Giscard D' Estang and Helmut Schmidt, the return to power of Swedish nobleman an d Committee"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 5 of 300 member Olaf Palme, the nullifying of Reagan' s presidency and the destruction of our steel, auto and housing industries in terms of the post-industrial zero-growth order hand ed down by the Committee of 300.

In what is in fact an open conspiracy against God and man, which includes enslaving the majority of humans lef t on this earth after wars, plagues and mass-murder have done with them is not well hidden. In the intelligence community, it is t aught that the best way to hide something is to place it in open v iew. As an example of the foregoing, when Germany wanted to hi de its prize new Messerschmidt fighter plane in 1938, the aircra ft was put on display at the Paris Air Show. While secret agents and spies were collecting information from hollow tree trunks and from behind loose bricks in a wall, the information they sought was staring them right in the face.

It places itself in full view in the White House, C ongress and in Number 10 Downing Street and the Houses of Parliame nt.

President Bush does not LOOK like a dutiful servant of the upper- level parallel government, but make no mistake abou t it, he is as much a MONSTER as are those horrors found in horror -movies. Stop for a moment and consider how President Bush ordered the brutal slaying of 150,000 Iraqi troops, in a convoy of military vehicles carrying white flags, on their wa y back to Iraq under Geneva Convention rules of agreed disengageme nt and withdrawal. Imagine the horror of the Iraqi troops when, in spite of waving their white flags, they were mowed down b y American aircraft. In another part of the front, 12,000 Iraq i soldiers were buried alive in trenches they occupied. Is that not MONSTROUS in the truest sense of the word? From where did Presid ent Bush get his orders to act in this MONSTROUS fashion? He got them from the Royal Institute for International Affairs (RIIA ) who received its mandate from the Committee of 300, also known as th e \"Olympians.\" As we shall see, even the \"Olympians\" do not hide their faces. Often times they put on a show which could b e likened to the Paris Air Show, even as conspiracy buffs spend their time in fruitless searching in the wrong places and in the wrong direction. Note how the Queen, Elizabeth II, performs the cere monial opening of the British Parliament? There, in full v iew is the head of the Committee of 300.

Their final objective was the overthrow of the U.S. Constitutio n and the merging of this country, chosen by God as HIS count ry, with a godless One World-New World Order Government which will return the world to conditions far worse than existed in t he Dark Ages. Let us talk about actual case histories, the atte mpt to communize and deindustrialize Italy. The Committee of 300 long ago decreed that there shall be a smaller—much smal ler—and better world, that is, their idea of what constitut es a better world. the myriads of useless eaters consuming scarce natu ral resources were to be culled. Industrial progress supports pop ulation growth. Therefore the command to multiply and subdue the ea rth found in Genesis had to be subverted. This called for an attack upon Christianity; the slow but sure disintegration of industrial nation states; th e destruction of hundreds of millions of people, referred to by the Committee of 300 as \"surplus population,\" and the removal of any leader who dared to stand in the way of the Committee's global planning to reach the foregoing objectives. Two of the Committee's earliest targets were Ital y and Pakistan. The late Aldo Moro, Prime Minister of Ita ly, was one leader who opposed \"zero growth\" and population red uctions planned for his country, thereby incurring the wrat h of the Club of Rome commissioned by the \"Olympians\" to carry out i ts policies in this regard. In a Rome courtroom on November 1Oth, 1982, a close friend of Moro's testified that the former pr ime minister was threatened by an agent of the Royal Institute for I nternational Affairs (RIIA) who is also a Committee of 300 memb er while he was still the U.S. Secretary of State. The meteoric rise of the man the witness named as Kissinger will be dealt with l ater. It will be recalled that Prime Minister Moro was kidnaped by the Red Brigades in 1978 and subsequently brutally shot to death."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 8 It was at the trial of members of the Red Brigades that several of them testified to the fact that they knew of high-l evel U.S. involvement in the plot to kill Moro. When threaten ing Moro, Kissinger was obviously not carrying out U.S. forei gn policy, but rather acting according to instructions received fr om the Club of Rome, the foreign-policy arm of the Committee of 3O O. The witness who delivered the bombshell in open c ourt was a close associate of Moro's, Gorrado Guerzoni. His explosive testimony was broadcast over Italian television and radio on November lOth, 1982, and printed in several Italian newspapers yet this vital information was suppressed in the U. S. Those famous bastions of freedom with a compelling right to know , the Washington Post and the New York Times, did not thi nk it important to even print a single line of Guerzoni's testimony. Nor was the news carried by any of the wire servi ces or television stations. The fact that Italy's Aldo Mor o had been a leading politician for decades, and who was kidnape d in broad daylight in the spring of 1978, all of his bodyguar ds butchered in cold blood, was not deemed newsworthy, even though Kissinger stood accused as an accomplice to these crimes? Or was the silence BECAUSE of Kissinger's involvement? In my 1982 expose of this heinous crime, I demons trated that Aldo Moro, a loyal member of the Christian Dem ocrat Party, was murdered by assassins controlled by P2 Masonry with the object of bringing Italy into line with Club of Rom e orders to deindustrialize the country and considerably reduce its population. Moro's plans to stabilize Italy through full employ ment and industrial and political peace would have strengthe ned Catholic opposition to Communism and made the destabilizatio n of the Middle East—a prime goal—that much harder. From the foregoing it becomes clear just how far ahead the conspirators plan. They do not think in terms of a Five Year Plan. One needs to go back to Weishaupt's statements abou t the early Catholic Church to understand what was involved in the murder of Aldo Moro. Moro's death removed the roadblocks to t he plans to destabilize Italy, and as we now know, enabled cons piracy plans for the Middle East to be carried out in the Gulf W ar 14 years later."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 9 Italy was chosen as a test-target by the Committe e of 300. Italy is important to the conspirators' plans becau se it is the closest European country to the Middle East linked to Middle East economics and politics. It is also the home of the Catholic Church, which Weishaupt ordered destroyed, and home for som e of Europe's most powerful top oligarchical families of the ancient Black Nobility. Should Italy have been weakened by Moro's death, it would have had repercussions in the Middle East which would have weakened U.S. influence in the region. Italy i s important for another reason; it is a gateway for drugs entering Europe from Iran and Lebanon, and we shall return to that subje ct in due course. Various groups had combined under the name of soc ialism to bring about the downfall of several Italian gove rnments since the Club of Rome was established in 1968. Among the se are the Black Nobility of Venice and Genoa, P2 Masonry and the Red Brigades, all working for the same goals. Police in vestigators in Rome working on the Red Brigades-Aldo Moro case cam e across the names of several very prominent Italian familie s working closely with this terrorist group. The police also discovered evidence that in at least a dozen cases, these powe rful and prominent families had allowed their homes and/or p roperty to be used as safe houses for Red Brigades cells. America's \"nobility\" were doing their share to de stroy the Republic of Italy, a notable contribution having co me from Richard Gardner even while in his official capacity as Pres ident Carter's ambassador to Rome. At that time Gardner was operat ing under the direct control of Bettino Craxi, an important m ember of the Club of Rome and a key man in NATO. Craxi was the l eading edge of the conspirators' attempts to destroy the Italia n Republic. As we shall see, Craxi was almost successful in ruining I taly, and as the conspirators hierarchy's leading player, was able t o get divorce and abortion pushed through the Italian Parliament, resulting in the most far-reaching and destructive religious and social changes ever to strike at the Catholic Church, and conseque ntly, the morals of the Italian nation. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 10 After President Ronald Reagan was elected, an imp ortant meeting was held in Washington D.C. in December 198 0 under the auspices of the Club of Rome and the Socialist Inte rnational. Both these organizations are directly responsible to the Committee of 300. The main agenda was to formulate ways and mean s of how to neutralize the Reagan presidency. A group plan w as adopted and, as we look back, it is perfectly clear that th e plan the conspirators agreed to follow has been very success ful. In order to get an idea of how vast and how all-p ervasive is this conspiracy, it would be appropriate at this po int to name the goals set by the Committee of 300 for the pending c onquest and control of the world. There are at least 40 known \" branch offices\" of the Committee of 300, and we shall be listing th em all, together with a description of their functions. Once this is studied it becomes easy to understand how one central conspira torial body is able to operate so successfully and why it is th at no power on earth can withstand their onslaught against the ver y foundations of a civilized, progressive world, based on freedom of the individual, especially as it is declared in the Uni ted States Constitution. Thanks to the sworn testimony of Guerzoni, Italy and Europe but not the U.S. learned that Kissinger was behind the death of Aldo Moro. This tragic affair demonstrates the ability of the Committee of 300 to impose its will upon any go vernment without exception. Secure in his position as a memb er of the most powerful secret society in the world, and I am not talking about Freemasonry, Kissinger not only terrified Moro, but carried through on his threats to \"eliminate\" Moro if he did not gi ve up his plan to bring economic and industrial progress to Italy. In June and July of 1982, the wife of Aldo Moro t estified in open court that her husband's murder came about as a result of serious threats against his life, made by what she called \"a high ranking United States political figure.\" Mrs. Elean ora Moro repeated the precise phrase reportedly used by Kiss inger in the sworn testimony of Guerzoni: \"Either you stop your political line or you will pay dearly for it.\" Recalled by the judge, Guerzoni was asked if he could identify the person Mrs. Moro was talking about."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 11 Guerzoni replied that it was indeed Henry Kissinger as he had previously intimated. Guerzoni went on to explain to the court that Kis singer had made his threats in Moro's hotel room during the It alian leaders official visit to the U.S. Moro—then Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Italy, a NATO member-country—was a man of high rank, one who should never have been subjected to Ma fia-like pressures and threats. Moro was accompanied on his American visit by the President of Italy in his official cap acity. Kissinger was then, and still is, an important agent in the servi ce of the Royal Institute for International Affairs, a member of th e Club of Rome and the Council on Foreign Relations. Kissinger's role in destabilizing the United Stat es by means of three wars, the Middle East, Korea and Vietnam, is well known, as is his role in the Gulf War, in which the U.S. A rmy acted as mercenaries for the Committee of 300 in bringing Ku wait back under its control and at the same time making an ex ample out of Iraq so that other small nations would not be tempt ed to work out their own destiny. Kissinger also threatened the late Ali Bhutto, Pr esident of the sovereign nation of Pakistan. Bhutto's \"crime\" was that he favored nuclear weapons for his country. As a Mosle m state, Pakistan felt threatened by continued Israeli aggre ssion in the Middle East. Bhutto was judicially murdered in 1979 by the Council on Foreign Relations representative in the country General Zia ul Haq. In his planned ascent to power, ul Haq encouraged a frenzied mob to set fire to the U.S. Embassy in Isl amabad in an apparent attempt to show the CFR that he was his ow n man and to secure more foreign aid and, it was later learne d, to murder Richard Helms. Several years later, ul Haq paid wit h his life for intervening in the war raging in Afghanistan. His C -130 Hercules aircraft was hit by an E.L.F.

General ul Haq had been warned by the Turkish Secret Service not to travel by plane, as he was targeted for a mid-air bombing. With this in mi nd, ul Haq took the United States team with him as \"an insurance po licy,\" as he commented to his inner circle advisors. In my 1989 work \"Terror' in the Skies,\" I gave th e following account of what happened: \"Shortly before ul Haq's C-130 took off from a Pakistan military base, a suspicious looking truck was seen close to the hangar that had housed the C-130. The control tower warned base security, but by the time action was ta ken, the C-130 was already airborne and the truck had gone. A few minutes later the plane began looping-the-loop until it hit the g round and exploded in a ball of fire. There is no explanation for such behavior by the C-130, an aircraft with a marvelously reliab le record, and a joint Pakistani-United States board of enquiry Found no pilot error or mechanical or structural failure. Looping-the-lo op is a recognized trade mark of an aircraft hit by E.L.F. fire. That the Soviet Union has been able to develop hi gh-peak radio frequency devices is known to the West throug h the work of Soviet scientists who work in the Kurchatov Atomic Energy Institute's Intensive Relatavistic Electron Beam Di vision. Two of its specialists were Y. A. Vinograov and A. A. Rukhadze . Both scientists worked in the Lededev Physics Institute, which specializes in electronic and X ray lasers. After receiving this information, I searched for confirmation from other sources and found that in England the In ternational journal of Electronics had published some material w hich appeared to confirm the information given to me about the me thod chosen to shoot down General ul Haq's C-130. In addition, the information was confirmed by two of my intelligence sources. I received some useful information from a Soviet scientific paper o n these subjects, published in England under the title \"Soviet Radio Electronics and Communications Systems.\" There was no doubt in my m ind that General ul Haq had been murdered. The truck seen ne ar the C- 130 hanger undoubtedly carried a mobile E.L.F. devi ce of the type the Soviet Armed Forces are known to possess."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 13 According to written testimony by Bhutto, smuggle d out of the country while he was in prison, Kissinger sever ely threatened him: \"I will make a horrible example if you continu e with your nation-building policies.\" Bhutto had fallen afoul of Kissinger and the Club of Rome by calling for a nuclear energy pr ogram to bring Pakistan into a modern industrialized state which, in the eyes of the Committee of 300, was a direct contravention of its orders delivered by Kissinger to the Pakistani government. What Kissinger was doing when he threatened Bhutto was not officia l U.S. policy, but the policy of the modern-day Illuminati. One needs to have a clear understanding of just wh y it is that nuclear power is so hated all over the world, and why the fake \"environmentalist\" movement, established and f inancially supported by the Club of Rome, was called upon to w age war on nuclear energy. With nuclear energy generating elec tricity in cheap and abundant supplies, Third World countries would gradually become independent of U.S. foreign aid and begin to assert their sovereignty. Nuclear generated electricity is THE k ey to bringing Third World countries out of their backward state, a state which the Committee of 300 has ordered to remain in posit ion. Less foreign aid means less control of a country' s natural resources by the I.M.F. It was this idea of develop ing nations taking charge of their destiny that was an anathema to the Club of Rome and its ruling Committee of 300. We have seen opposition to nuclear power in the United States successfully used to block industrial development in conformity with the Club' s \"Post- Industrial Zero-Growth\" plans. Dependence upon U.S. foreign aid actually keeps f oreign countries in servitude to the Council on Foreign Re lations. The people of the recipient countries receive very litt le of the money as it usually ends up in the pockets of government lea ders who allow the natural raw material assets of the country to b e savagely stripped by the I.M.F. Mugabe of Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, is a good example of how raw material assets, in this case high grade chrome ore, is controlled through foreign aid .

A reasonable price level was maintained for twenty-five years prior to the Mugabe regime taking power. While there were problems during the 14-year rule of Ian Smith, since his departure unemployment has quadrupled and Zimba bwe is in a state of chaos and de facto bankruptcy. Mugabe rece ived enough foreign aid from the U.S. (in the region of $300 mi llion per annum) to enable him to build three hotels on the French C ote d'Azur, Cap Ferat and Monte Carlo, while his citizens grapple w ith disease, unemployment and malnutrition, not to mention an ir on-fisted dictatorship that allows no complaints. Contrast th is with the Smith government which never asked for nor received one r ed cent in aid from the United States. Thus it is clear that f oreign aid is a powerful means of exercising control of countries s uch as Zimbabwe and indeed all African countries. It also keeps U.S. citizens in a state of involun tary servitude and therefore less able to mount meaningful opposit ion to government.

One of the most asked questions is, \"How c an any single entity know at all times what is going on and how i s control exercised?\" This book will attempt to answer these and other questions. The only way we can come to grips with t he reality of the conspirator's success is by mentioning and disc ussing the secret societies, front organizations, government a gencies, banks, insurance companies, international businesses, the petroleum industry and the hundreds of thousands of entities and foundations whose leading lights make up the member ship of the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 15 Committee of 300—the ULTIMATE controlling body that runs the world and has done so for at least a hundred years. Since there already are scores of books on the Co uncil on Foreign Relations (CFR) and the Trilaterals, we sha ll go directly to the Club of Rome and the German Marshall Fund. When I introduced these organizations to the United States , few, if any, had heard of them. My first work, \"The Club of Rome ,\" published in 1983 attracted almost no attention. Many uniniti ated people thought the Club of Rome was something to do with t he Catholic Church and that the German Marshall Fund referred t o the Marshal Plan. This is precisely why the Committee chose these n ames, to confuse and to deflect attention away from what was happening. Not that the U.S. government didn't know, but as it was part of the conspiracy, it helped to keep the lid on inform ation rather than let the truth be known. A few years after I publish ed my work, a few writers saw in it a wealth of hitherto untapped information and began writing and talking about it as though they h ad always had full knowledge of it. It came as a revelation to them that the Club of Rome and its financiers under the title of the German Marsha ll Fund were two highly-organized conspiratorial bodies operating un der cover of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and that the majority of Club of Rome executives were drawn from NATO. The C lub of Rome formulated all of what NATO claimed as its pol icies and, through the activities of Committee of 300 member L ord Carrington, was able to split NATO into two faction s, a political (left wing) power group and its former military all iance. The Club of Rome is still one of the most importa nt foreign policy arms of the Committee of 300—the other being the Bilderbergers. It was put together in 1968 from har d-core members of the original Morgenthau group on the bas is of a telephone call made by the late Aurellio Peccei for a new and urgent drive to speed up the plans of the One World Government—now called the New World Order, although I prefer the former name. It is certainly a better job-descri ption than the New World Order, which is somewhat confusing as the re have"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 16 been several \"New World Orders\" before, but no One World Government. Peccei's call was answered by the most subversive \"future planners\" drawn from the United States, France, Swe den, Britain, Switzerland and Japan that could be mustered. Durin g the period 1968-1972, The Club of Rome became a cohesive entit y of new- science scientists, globalists, future planners and internationalists of every stripe. As one delegate put it, \"We became Joseph's Coat of Many Colors.\" Peccei's book \"Human Quality\" form ed the basis of the doctrine adopted by NATO's political wing. The following is extracted from Dr. Peccei's book , \"Human Quality\": \"For the first time since the first millennium wa s approached in Christendom, large masses of people a re really in suspense about the impending advent of something un known which could change their collective fate entirely.. .. Man does not know how to be a truly modern man.... Man invented the story of the Bad Dragon, but if ever there was a bad dragon, IT IS MAN HIMSELF.... Here we have the human paradox: man tra pped by his extraordinary capacity and achievements, as in a quicksand— the more he uses his power the more he needs it. \"We must never tire of repeating how foolish it i s to equate the present profound pathological state and maladjus tment of the entire human system to any cyclic crisis or passing circumstances.

The New World Order is not new, it has been around and developing under one or another guise for a very long time but it is perceived as a DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUTURE, which is not the ca se; the New World Order is PAST AND PRESENT. That is why I said earlier that the term One World Government is, or ought to be, preferred. Aurellio Peccei once confided in his close friend A lexander Haig that he felt like \"Adam Weishaupt reincarnated.\" Pe ccei had much of Weishaupt's brilliant ability to organize and co ntrol the Illuminati of today, and it showed through in Peccei's control of NATO and formulating its policies on a global scale. Peccei headed the Atlantic Institute's Economic C ouncil for three decades while he was the Chief Executive Offi cer for Giovanni Agnellis' Fiat Motor Company. Agnelli, a m ember of an ancient Italian Black Nobility family of the same n ame, is one of the most important members of the Committee of 300. He played a leading role in development projects in the Sovie t Union. The Club of Rome is a conspiratorial umbrella org anization, a marriage between Anglo-American financiers and th e old Black Nobility families of Europe, particularly the so-ca lled \"nobility\" of London, Venice and Genoa. The key to the successful control of the world is their ability to create and manage sav age economic recessions and eventual depressions. The Committee of 300 looks to social convulsions on a global scale, followed b y depressions, as a softening-up technique for bigger things to come, as its principal method of creating masses of people all over the wo rld who will become its \"welfare\" recipients of the future. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 18 The committee appears to base much of its importa nt decisions affecting mankind on the philosophy of Po lish aristocrat, Felix Dzerzinski, who regarded mankind as being sli ghtly above the level of cattle. As a close friend of British intel ligence agent Sydney Reilly (Reilly was actually Dzerzinski's controller during the Bolshevik Revolution's formative years), he often c onfided in Reilly during his drinking bouts. Dzerzinski was, of cours e, the beast who ran the Red Terror apparatus. He once told Reilly, while the two were on a drinking binge, that \"Man is of no import ance. Look at what happens when you starve him. He begins to eat his dead companions to stay alive. Man is only interested in his own survival. That is all that counts. All the Spinoza stuff is a lot of rubbish.\" The Club of Rome has its own private intelligence agency and also \"borrows\" from David Rockefeller's INTERPO L. Every U.S. intelligence agency cooperates very closely with it , as does the KGB and the Mossad. The only agency that remained b eyond its reach was the East-German intelligence service. the STASSY. The Club of Rome also has its own highly organized poli tical and economic agencies. It was they who told President R eagan to retain the services of Paul Volcker, yet another im portant Committee of 300 member. Volcker stayed on as Feder al Reserve Board chairman, notwithstanding the faithful promis e of candidate Reagan that he would dismiss him as soon as he, Rea gan, was elected. The Club of Rome, after playing a key role in the Cuban Missile Crisis, attempted to sell its \"crisis manag ement\" (the forerunner of FEMA) program to President Kennedy. S everal Tavistock scientists went to see the President to e xplain what it meant, but the President rejected the advice they ga ve. The same year that Kennedy was murdered, Tavistock was back in Washington to talk with NASA. This time the talks w ere successful. Tavistock was given a contract by NASA to evaluate the effect of its coming space program on American public opinion . The contract was farmed to the Stanford Research Institute and the Rand Corporation. Much of the material prod uced by Tavistock, Stanford and Rand never saw the light of day and remains sealed until now.

Such is the power and prestige of the Committee of 300. In 1966 I was advised by my intelligence colleagu es to approach Dr. Anatol Rappaport who had written a tre atise in which the administration was said to be interested. It wa s a paper intended to bring an end to NASA's space program, w hich Rapport said had outlived its usefulness. Rappaport was qui te happy to give me a copy of his paper which, without going in to fine detail, basically claimed that NASA's space program should be scrapped. NASA has too many scientists who were exerting a ba d influence on America because they were always eager to lectur e schools and university audiences on how rocketry worked, from c onstruction to propulsion. Rappaport claimed that this would produ ce a generation of adults who would decide to become spa ce scientists, only to find themselves \"redundant\" as no one would need their services by the year 2000. No sooner had Rappaport's profiling report on NAS A been presented to NATO by the Club of Rome, than the Com mittee of 300 demanded action. NATO-Club of Rome officials ch arged with urgent anti-NASA action were Harland Cleveland, Jos eph Slater, Claiborne K. Pell, Walter J. Levy, George McGhee, W illiam Watts, Robert Strausz-Hupe (U.S. ambassador to NATO) and D onald Lesh. In May 1967 a meeting was organized by the Scientif ic and Technological Committee of the North Atlantic Assem bly and the Foreign Policy Research Institute. It was called \"C onference on Transatlantic Imbalance and Collaboration\" and it w as held at Queen Elizabeth's palatial property in Deauville, F rance. The basic purpose and intent of the conference at Deauville was to end U.S. technological and industrial progre ss. Out of the conference came two books, one of which is mentione d herein, Brzezinski's \"Technotronic Era.\" The other was writ ten by conference chairman, Aurellio Peccei, entitled \"The Chasm Ahead.\" Peccei largely agreed with Brzezinski, but added th at there world be chaos in a future world NOT RULED BY A ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT. In this regard, Peccei insisted that th e Soviet Union must be offered \"a convergence with NATO,\" su ch a convergence ending in an equal partnership in a New World Order"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 20 with the United States. Both nations would be respo nsible for future \"crisis management and global planning.\" The first Club of Rome's \"global planning contract\" went to the Massa chusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), one of the premier C ommittee of 300's research institutes. Jay Forrestor and Dennis Meadows were placed in charge of the project. What was their report all about? It did not diffe r fundamentally from what Malthus and Von Hayek preac hed, namely the old question of not enough natural resou rces to go around. The Forrestor-Meadows Report was a complete fraud. What it did not say was that man's proven inventive genius would in all likelihood work its way around \"shortages.\" Fusion energy, the DEADLY enemy of the Committee of 300, could be applied to CREATING natural resources. A fusion torch could pr oduce from one square mile of ordinary rock enough aluminum, f or example, to fill our needs for 4 years. Peccei never tired of preaching against the natio n-state an how destructive they are for the progress of mankin d. He called for \"collective responsibility.\" Nationalism was a cancer on man was the theme of several important speeches deliver ed by Peccei. His close friend Ervin Lazlo produced a work in 197 7 in a similar vein which was called \"Goals of Mankind,\" a landmar k study for the Club of Rome. The entire position paper was a v itriolic attack on industrial expansion and urban growth. Throughou t these years, Kissinger, as the designated contact man, kept in c lose touch with Moscow on behalf of the RIIA. \"Global modeling\" pap ers were regularly shared with Kissinger's friends in the Kr emlin. With regard to the Third World, the Club of Rome' s Harland Cleveland prepared a report which was the height of cynicism. At the time, Cleveland was United States Ambassador to NATO. Essentially, the paper said it would be up to Third World nations to decide among themselves which populations should be eliminated. As Peccei later wrote (based on the Cleveland Repor t): \"Damaged by conflicting policies of three major countries and blocs, roughly patched up here and there, the existing internation al economic order is visibly coming apart at the seams....The p rospect of the necessity of the recourse to triage-deciding who mu st be saved—is a very grim one indeed. But, if lamentably, events should come to"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 21 such a pass, the right to make such decisions canno t be left to just a few nations because it would lend themselves to o minous power over life of the world's hungry.\" In this is found the committee policy of delibera tely starving African nations to death, as evidenced in the sub-Sahara nations. This was cynicism at its worst, because th e Committee of 300 had already abrogated the decisions of life and death unto itself, and Peccei knew it. He had previously so in dicated in his book \"Limits of Growth.\" Peccei completely dismisse d industrial and agricultural progress and in its place demanded that the world come under one coordinating council, to whit, the C lub of Rome and its NATO institutions, in a One World Governmen t. Natural resources would have to be allocated unde r the auspices of global planning. Nation states could ei ther accept Club of Rome domination or else survive by the law of th e jungle and fight to survive. In its first \"test case,\" Meadows and Forrestor planned the 1973 Arab-Israeli War on behalf of the RIIA to sharply bring home to the world that natural resources like petroleum would in the future come under global planners cont rol, meaning of course, under the control of the Committee of 30 0. Tavistock Institute called for a consultation wit h Peccei to which McGeorge Bundy, Homer Perlmutter and Dr. Alex ander King were invited. From London Peccei traveled to the Wh ite House where he met with the President and his cabinet, Fo llowed by a visit to the State Department where he conferred wi th the Secretary of State, the State Department's intellig ence service and State's Policy Planning Council. Thus, from the ver y beginning, the United States government was fully aware of the Com mittee of 300's plans for this country. That should answer th e often asked question, \"Why would our government allow the Club of Rome to operate in a subversive manner in the United States ?\" Volcker's economic and monetary policies were a r eflection of those of Sir Geoffrey Howe, Chancellor of the ex chequer and member of the Committee of 300.

It is also interesting that the Committee is presen tly seeking to reinstate the Pol Pot butchers in Cambodia.

Particularly hated are the fusion experiments presently being scorned and ridi culed by the Committee and its jackals of the press.

The paper was produced under t he title the \"Global 2000 Report\" and was accepted and approved for action by President Carter, for and on behalf of the U.S. Government, and accepted by Edwin Muskie, then Secretary of Sta te.

The United States press and news media re fused to give any space or coverage to the mass of documentation in possession of the Salvadorian government, documentation which proves what the Mary Knoll Mission nuns were doing in the count ry.

Much of these goals, which I first enumerated in 1969, have since been achieved or are well on their way t o being achieved. Of special interest in the Committee of 3 00 program is the core of their economic policy, which is largely based on the teachings of Malthus, the son of an English country parson who was pushed to prominence by the British East India Company upon which the Committee of 300 is modeled. Malthus maintained that man's progress is tied to the earth's natural ability to support a given number o f people, beyond which point earth's limited resources would rapidly be depleted. Once these natural resources have been consumed, it will be impossible to replace them. Hence, Malthus observed , it is necessary to limit populations within the boundarie s of decreasing natural resources. It goes without saying that the elite will not allow themselves to be threatened by a burgeoning p opulation of \"useless eaters,\" hence culling must be practiced. As I have previously stated, \"culling\" is going on today, usi ng the methods mandated in the \"Global 2000 Report.\" All economic plans of the Committee meet at the crossroads of Malthus and Frederick Von Hayek, anot her doom and gloom economist who is sponsored by the Club of Rome. The Austrian born Von Hayek has long been under the con trol of David Rockefeller, and Von Hayek theories are fairly wide ly accepted in the United States. According to Von Hayek, the Unit ed States economic platform must be based on (a) Urban Black Markets (b) Small Hong Kong-type industries utilizing sweat-sho p labor (c) The Tourist Trade, (d) Free Enterprise Zones where spec ulators can operate unhindered and where the drug trade can flo urish (e) End of all industrial activity and (f) Close down all n uclear energy plants. Von Hayek's ideas dove-tail perfectly with those of the Club of Rome, which is perhaps why he is so well promote d in rightwing circles in this country. The mantle of Von Hayek is being passed to a new, younger economist, Jeoffrey Sachs, who was s ent to"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 27 Poland to take up where Von Hayek left off. It will he recalled that the Club of Rome organized the Polish economic cris is which led to political destabilization of the country. The exact same economic planning, if one dare call it that, will be forced upon Russia, but if widespread opposition is encountered, the old price -support system will quickly be restored. The Committee of 300 ordered the Club of Rome to use Polish nationalism as a tool to destroy the Catholi c Church and pave the way for Russian troops to reoccupy the cou ntry. The \"Solidarity\" movement was a creation of the Committ ee of 300's Zbigniew Brzezinski, who chose the name for the \"tr ade union\" and selected its office holders and organizers. Sol idarity is no \"labor\" movement, although Gdansk shipyard workers were used to launch it, but rather, it was a high-profile POL ITCAL organization, created to bring forced changes in pr eparation for the advent of the One World Government. Most of Solidarity's leaders were descendants of Bolshevik Jews from Odessa and were not noted for hating Comm unism. This helps to understand the saturation coverage pr ovided by the American news media. Professor Sachs has taken the process a step further, ensuring economic slavery for a Polan d recently freed from the domination of the USSR. Poland will now be come the economic slave of the United States. All that has h appened is that the master has changed. Brzezinski is the author of a book that should ha ve been read by every American interested in the future of this country. Entitled \"The Technotronic Era,\" it was commissione d by the Club of Rome. The book is an open announcement of the ma nner and methods to be used to control the United States in the future. It also gave notice of cloning and \"robotoids,\" i.e. p eople who acted like people and who seemed to be people, but who we re not. Brzezinski, speaking for the Committee of 300 said the United States was moving \"into an era unlike any of its pr edecessors; we were moving toward a technotronic era that could ea sily become a dictatorship.\" I reported fully on \"the Technotroni c Era\" in 1981 and mentioned it in my newsletters a number of time s. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 28 Brzezinski went on to say that our society \"is no w in an information revolution based on amusement focus, sp ectator spectacles (saturation coverage by television of sp orting events) which provide an opiate for an increasingly purpose less mass.\" Was Brzezinski another seer and a prophet? Could he see into the future? The answer is NO; what he wrote in his book was simply copied from the Committee of 300's blueprint given to the Club of Rome for execution. Isn't it true that by 1991 we a lready have a purposeless mass of citizens? We could say that 30 million unemployed and 4 million homeless people are a \"pur poseless mass,\" or at least the nucleus of one. In addition to religion, \"the opiate of the masse s\" which Lenin and Marx acknowledged was needed, we now have the opiates of mass spectator sport, unbridled sexual l usts, rock music and a whole new generation of drug addicts. Mindles s sex and an epidemic of drug usage was created to distract peop le from what is happening all around them. In \"The Technotronic Era\" Brzezinski talks about \"the masses\" as if people are some inan imate object— which is possibly how we are viewed by the Committe e of 300. He continually refers to the necessity of controlling us \"masses.\" At one point, he lets the cat out of the bag: \"At the same time the capacity to assert social a nd political control over the individual will vastly increase. I t will soon be possible to assert almost continuous control over e very citizen and to maintain up-to-date files, containing even the m ost personal details about health and personal behavior of every citizen in addition to the more customary data. \"These files will be subject to instantaneous retr ieval by the authorities. Power will gravitate into the hands of those who control information. Our existing institutions will be supplanted by pre-crisis management institutions, the task of whi ch will be to identify in advance likely social crises and to dev elop programs to cope with them.

Finally, looking ahead to the end of the century, t he possibility of BIOCHEMICAL MIND CONTROL AND GENETIC TINKERING WITH MAN, INCLUDING BEINGS WHICH WILL FUNCTION LIKE MEN AND REASON LIKE THEM AS WELL, COULD GIVE RISE TO SO ME DIFFICULT QUESTIONS.\" Brzezinski was not writing as a private citizen b ut as Carter's National Security Advisor and a leading me mber of the Club of Rome and a member of the Committee of 300, a member of the CFR and as a member of the old Polish Black Nobility. His book explains how America must leave its industrial base behind and enter into what he called \"a distinct new histo rical era.\" \"What makes America unique is its willingness to experience the future, be it pop-art or LSD. Today, America is the creative society, the others, consciously or uncons ciously, are emulative. What he should have said was that Americ a is the proving ground for Committee of 300 policies which lead directly to a dissolution of the old order and an entry into the One World Government-New World Order. One of the chapters in \"The Technotronic Era\" exp lains how new technology will bring in its wake intense c onfrontation that will strain social and international peace. Od dly enough we are already under intense strains through surveilla nce. Lourdes in Cuba is one place where this is happening. The othe r is NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, where a giant co mputer designated \"666\" can store data of every type menti oned by Brzezinski, plus possessing an expanded capacity to take in data for several billions more people than presently exi st, if it ever comes to that, but which, in the light of the Globa l 2000 genocidal report, will probably never need to be utilized. Retrieval of data will be simple in the United St ates where social security and or driver licence numbers could simply be added to 666 to provide the surveillance recording announced by Brzezinski and his Committee of 300 colleagues.

Another item I reported back then was that RU SSIA HAD BEEN INVITED TO JOIN THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE COMlN G ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT. When I wrote these things in 1981, the conspirato rs' global plans were already in an advanced state of prepared ness. Looking back over the past 10 years, it can be seen just how rapidly the Committee's plans have advanced. If the information provided in 1981 was alarming, then it should be even more alar ming today as we near the final stages of the demise of the Unite d States as we know it. With unlimited funding, with several hundr ed think tanks and 5000 social engineers, the media banking and co ntrol of most governments a reality, we can see that we are traci ng a problem of immense proportions, one that cannot he opposed by any nation at this time.

The Club of Rome also had a direct hand in creati ng the 25year old war in EI Salvador, as an integral part of the wider plan drawn up by Elliot Abrams of the U.S. State Departm ent. It was Committee of 300 member Willy Brandt, leader of the Socialist International and a former chancellor of West Germa ny, who paid for the \"final offensive\" by the Salvadorian guerri llas which, fortunately, was not successful. EI Salvador was ch osen by the committee to turn Central America into a zone for a new Thirty- Year War, which task was allocated to Kissinger to carry out under the innocuous title of \"The Andes Plan.\""},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 31 Just to demonstrate how the conspirators operate across all national boundaries, the \"final offensive\" action p lanned by Willy Brandt came about as a result of a visit to Felipe Gonzalez, who at the time was preparing himself for his Club of Rome -ordained role as Spain's future prime minister. Apart from myself and one or two of my intelligence colleagues and former colleagues , no one appeared to have heard of Gonzalez before he surfac ed in Cuba. Gonzalez was the Club of Rome's case officer for EI Salvador, and the first Socialist to be elevated to political pow er in Spain since the death of General Franco. Gonzalez was on his way to Washington to attend t he Club of Rome Socialist \"get Reagan\" meeting which took p lace in December 1980. Present at the Gonzalez-Castro meeti ng was the left-wing guerrilla, Guillermo Ungo, run by the Ins titute for Policy Studies (IPS), the Committee of 300's most notoriou s Washington- based leftwing think tank. Ungo was run by an IPS f ellow who died in a mysterious plane crash while enroute from Wash ington to Havana to visit Castro. As most of us know, both the left and the right o f the political spectrum is controlled by the same people , which will help to explain the fact that Ungo was a life-long frien d of the late Napoleon Duarte, leader of the rightwing in EI Salv ador. It was after the Cuban meeting that the \"final offensive\" by the Salvadorian guerrillas was carried out. The polarizing of South America and the U.S was a special assignment given to Kissinger by the Committee of 3 00. The Malvinas War (also known as the Falklands War) and the subsequent overthrow of the Argentine government, f ollowed by economic chaos and political upheavals, were planne d by Kissinger Associates acting in concert with Lord Carrington, a top-ranking member of the Committee of 300. One of the principal Committee of 300 assets in t he U.S., the Aspen Institute of Colorado, also helped plan e vents in Argentina even as it did in the case of the fall of the Shah of Iran. Latin America is important to the United States, no t only because we have so many mutual defense treaties with countr ies there, but"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 32 also because it has the potential of providing a hu ge market for American exports of technology, heavy industrial eq uipment which world have galvanized many of our faltering compani es and provided thousands of new jobs. This was to be prev ented all costs, even if it meant 30 years of war. Instead of seeing this huge potential in a positi ve light, the Committee of 300 saw it as a dangerous threat to it s postindustrial zero-growth U.S. plans and immediately acted to mak e an example of Argentina as a warning to other Latin Am erican nations to forget any ideas they may have had to promote na tionalism, independence and sovereign integrity. This is the r eason why so many Latin American countries turned to drugs as th eir sole means of support, which may very well have been the inten tion of the conspirators in the first place. Americans in general look down on Mexico, which i s precisely the attitude with which the Committee wan ts the people of the United States to regard Mexico. What we need to do is change our thinking about Mexico and South America in general. Mexico represents a potentially huge market for all types of U.S. goods which could mean thousands of jobs for America ns and Mexicans alike. Transferring our industries \"south of the border\" and paying the maquiladores slave wages is not in t he interests of either country. It benefits nobody but the \"Olympia ns.\" Mexico received most of its nuclear power technol ogy from Argentina, but the Malvinas War put an end to that. The Club of Rome decreed back in 1986 that it would stop export s of nuclear technology to developing countries. With nuclear po wer stations generating abundant cheap electricity, Mexico would have become the \"Germany of Latin America.\" Such a state of aff airs would have been a disaster for the conspirators who have, by 1 991, stopped all exports of nuclear technology except that desti ned for Israel. What the Committee of 300 has in mind for Mexico is a feudal peasantry, a condition that allows for easy management and looting of Mexican oil.

B y seeking common ground with Mexican patriotic movements we i n the United States could forge a formidable force to be reckoned with. But such action requires leadership, and we are mor e lacking in leadership than in any other area of endeavor. The Committee of 300 through its many affiliated organizations was able to nullify the Reagan presid ency. Here is what Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundation had t o say on the subject \"The right thought it had won in 1980 but in fact it have lost.\" What Butler was referring to was the situati on in which the Right found itself when it realized that every sing le position of importance in the Reagan administration was filled by Fabianist appointees recommended by the Heritage Foundation. Butler went on to say that Heritage would use rightwing ideas t o impose leftwing radical principles upon the United States, the same radical ideas which Sir Peter Vickers Hall, top Fabianist i n the U.S. and the number one man at Heritage, had been openly discuss ing during the election year. Sir Peter Vickers Hall remained an active Fabiani st even though he was running a conservative \"think tank.\" As a member of the British oligarchical Vickers armament manufa cturing family, he had position and power. The Vickers family suppl ied both sides in the First World War and again during Hitler's ri se to power. Vickers' official cover was the University of Calif ornia's Urban and Regional Development Institute. He was a longtime c onfidant of British Labour leader and Committee of 300 member A nthony Wedgewood Benn."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 34 Both Vickers and Benn are integrated with the Tav istock Institute for Human Relations, the premiere brainwa shing institution in the world. Vickers uses his Tavistoc k training to very good effect when speech-making. Consider the follow ing example: \"There are two Americas. One is the nineteenth ce ntury heavy-industry based society. The other is the grow ing post industrial society, in some cases built on the shar ds of the old America. It is the crisis between these two worlds which will produce the economic and social catastrophe of the next decade. The two worlds are in fundamental opposition, they cannot coexist. In the end the post industrial world must crush and obliterate the other one.\" Remember, this speech was made in 1981 and we can see from the state of our economy and our industrie s just how accurate was Sir Peter's prediction. When concerned people ask me how long the 1991 recession will last, I refer t hem to Sir Peter's statements and add my own opinion that it w ill not end until 1995/1996, and even then what emerges will no t be the America we knew in the 1960's and 1970's. That Amer ica has already been destroyed. I reported Sir Peter's speech in my newsletter so on after it was delivered. How prophetic it was, but then it wa s easy to predict a future already written for America by the Committee of 300 and its executive Club of Rome. What was Sir Pe ter saying in a euphemistic manner? Translated into ordinary ever yday English, he was saying that the old American way of life, ou r true and trusted republican form of government based upon ou r Constitution, was going to be crushed by the New Wo rld Order. America as we knew it was going to have to go, or b e crushed to pieces. As I said, Committee of 300 members often make themselves highly visible. Sir Peter was no excepti on. To make it clearly understood where he was coming from, Sir Pe ter rounded off his speech by declaring: \"I am perfectly happy working with the Heritage Foundation and groups like that. True Fabians look to the New Right to push through some of their more radical id eas. For more"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 35 than a decade the British population has been subjec t to a constant propaganda barrage of how it was on the in dustrial skids. All of this is true, but the net effect of the prop aganda was to demoralize the population. (Exactly as intended by the new- science scientist at Tavistock.) \"This will happen in the United States as the eco nomy worsens. This (demoralizing process) is necessary t o make people accept difficult choices. If there is no planning f or the future or if constituencies block progress there will be social chaos on a scale which is currently hard to imagine. The outlook for urban America is bleak. There is a possibility of doing something with the inner cities, but basically the cities will shrink and th e manufacturing base will decline. This will produce social convuls ions.\" Was Sir Peter a psychic, a magician of great repo rt or merely a charlatan fortune teller with a great deal of luck? The answer is \"none of these.\" All Sir Peter was doing was reading off the blueprint of the Committee of 300-Club of Rome for slow death of the United States as a former industrial g iant. Looking back over the ten years of Sir Peter's predictions, can anybody doubt that the Committee of 300's plans for the dem ise of an industrialized United States has become a fait acco mpli? Haven't Sir Peter's predictions proved to be rema rkably accurate? Indeed they have, almost down to the last word. It is worth noting that Sir Peter Vickers (Sir Peter Vick ers-Hall's father- in-law) worked on the Stanford Research paper, \"Cha nging Images of Man,\" from which much of the 3000 pages of mater ial advice sent to the Reagan Administration was taken. Moreov er, as a senior MJ6 British intelligence officer, Sir Peter Vickers was in a position to give Heritage a great deal of advance i nformation. As a member of the Committee of 300 and NATO, Sir Peter Vickers was around when NATO directed the Club of R ome to develop a social program which would utterly change the direction in which America wanted to go. The Club of Rome, un der Tavistock direction, ordered Stanford Research Inst itute (SRI) to develop such a program, not only for America, but f or every nation in the Atlantic Alliance and the OECD nations. "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 36 It was Sir Peter's protege, Stuart Butler, who ga ve President Reagan 3000 pages of \"recommendations,\" w hich no doubt contained some opinions expressed by Anthony Wedgewood Benn, a member of parliament and a ranking member o f the Committee of 300. Benn told members of the Socialis t Internaional who met in Washington on December 8, 1980: \"You can thrive under Volcker's credit collapse if you profile Reag an to intensify the credit collapse.\" That Butler's advice was taken and applied to the Reagan administration can be seen in the collapse of the S avings and loan and banking industries which accelerated under Reag an economic policies. While Benn called it \"profiling,\" he real ly meant that Reagan should be brainwashed. It is worth noting th at Von Hayek- who is a founder member of Heritage-used his studen t, Milton Friedman, to preside over the Club of Rome's plans to deindustrialise America using the Reagan presidency to accelerate the collapse of first the steel industry, and then the auto and housing industries, for example. In this regard a French Black Nobility member, Et ienne D'Avignon, as a member of the Committee of 300, was assigned the task of collapsing the steel industry in this c ountry. It is doubtful that any of the hundreds of thousands of s teel workers and shipyard workers who have been without jobs for the past decade have ever heard of D'Avignon. I fully report ed the D'Avignon Plan in April 1981 Economic Review. Atten ding that fateful December lOth Club of Rome meeting in Washi ngton D.C. was a mystery man from Iran who turned out to be Ba ni Sadr, the Ayatollah Khomeini's special envoy. One speech in particular at the December 1Oth, 19 80 conclave caught my attention, mainly because it cam e from Francois Mitterand, a man the French establishment had discarded and thought to be washed up. But my intelligence so urce had previously told me that Mitterand was in the proces s of being picked up, dusted off and returned to power, so wha t he said carried a good deal of weight for me: \"Industrial capitalist development is the opposit e of freedom We must put an end to it. The economic syst ems of the"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 37 20th and 21st century will use machines to crush ma n, first in the domain of nuclear energy which is already producing formidable results. Mitterand's return to the Elysee Palace wa s a great triumph for socialism. It proved that the Committee of 3OO was powerful enough to predict happenings and then make them happen, by force, or by whatever means it took to m ake its point that it could crush any and all opposition even if, as in the case of Mitterand, he had been totally rejected a few short days before by a discerning political power group in Paris. Another group representative at the December 1980 Washington meetings with \"observer status\" was John Graham, also known as \"Irwin Suall,\" head of the fact-findi ng committee of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). The ADL is an out right British intelligence operation run by all three branches of British intelligence, that is, M16 and the JIO. Suall's ext ensive bag of dirty tricks was garnered from the sewers of the East End of London. Suall is still a member of the super-secret SIS, an elite James Bond type of operation. Let nobody underestimate the pow er of the ADL, nor its long reach. Suall works closely with Hall and other Fabianist s. He was singled out as useful to British intelligence while at Ruskir Labour College at Oxford University in England, the same c ommunist education center that gave us Milner, Rhodes, Burge ss, McLean and Kim Philby. Oxford and Cambridge Universities h ave long been the province of the sons and daughters of the elite , those whose parents belong to the \"upper crust\" of British high society. While at Oxford, Suall joined the Young People's Socialist L eague, and was recruited by British intelligence shortly thereafte r. Suall was posted to the United States where he ca me under the protection and sponsorship of one of the most insidious leftists in the country, Walter Lippmann. Lippmann founded and ran the League for Industrial Democracy, and Studen ts for Democratic Society, both leftist spoiler operations to set industrial workers at variance with what it called \"the Capita list class\" and management. Both of Lippmann's projects were an int egral part of the Committee of 300 apparatus that stretched right across America, of which Lippmann was a most important mem ber. "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 38 Suall has strong connections with the Justice Dep artment and can secure FBI profiles of any person he target s. The Justice Department has orders to give Suall everything he w ants when he wants it. Most of Suall's activities center around \"keeping an eye on rightwing groups and individuals.\" The ADL has a n open door to the State Department and makes good use of State 's impressive intelligence agency. The State Department has a layer of agents in the right wing, posing as \"fearless anti-Semitic fighters.\" T here are four leaders in this group of informers, three of whom a re discreet Jewish homosexuals. This spy group has been in oper ation for the past two decades. They publish virulently anti-Jewi sh \"newspapers\" and sell a wide variety of anti-Semiti c books. One of the principal operators works out of Louisiana. A m ember of this group is a writer who is dearly beloved in Christia n rightwing circles. The group and the individuals who go to ma ke it up are under the protection of the ADL. Suall was deeply i nvolved in ABSCAM and is often called upon by law enforcement agencies to assist them in investigations and sting operations. Suall was assigned to \"dog Reagan,\" in terms of t he course laid out for the newly-elected President by the Her itage Foundation, and to figuratively fire a few warning shots if Reagan looked like deviating or taking off his blinders at any time. Suall helped to get rid of any troublesome rightwing advi sor not beholden to Heritage for his or her job with the Re agan administration. Such a person was Ray Donovan, Reag an's Secretary of Labor, who was eventually removed from his post thanks to the Dirty Tricks department of the ADL. J ames Baker III, one of those on the list of 3000 recommendations ma de by the Heritage Foundation, was the go-between who carried Suall's messages of hate about Donovan to the President. Another important conspirator was Philip Agee, th e socalled CIA \"defector.\" Although not a member of the Commit tee, he was nevertheless its case officer for Mexico, and run b y the Royal Institute for International Affairs (RIIA) and the Council on Foreign Relations. For the record, nothing that happens in the U.S. happens without the sanction of the RIIA. It is a c ontinuing and ongoing agreement first OPENLY entered into (there were many"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 39 such secret agreements before that) by Churchill an d Roosevelt in 1938, under the terms of which U.S. intelligence se rvices are obliged to share intelligence secrets with British intelligence. This is the basis of the so-called \"special relat ionship\" between the two countries about which Churchill and Lord Halifax boasted and which \"special relationship\" was respon sible for the U.S. fighting the Gulf War against Iraq for and on behalf of British interests, more especially British Petroleum, one o f the most important companies in the Committee of 300 in whic h Queen Elizabeth's immediate family has a big stake. No intelligence activity has taken place since 19 38 except through this special joint command structure. Philip Agee joined the CIA after graduating from Notre Dame where he w as inducted into its Jesuit Freemason ring. Agee first came to my attention in 1968 as the intelligence officer behind the riots a t the University of Mexico. One of the most important things about the Mexican student riots was that they occurred at the same ti me as student rioting in New York, Bonn, Prague and West Berlin. With the coordination expertise and its special i ntelligence network of which INTERPOL is an integral part, it i s not as difficult as it might seem at first sight for the Committee t o set in motion carefully timed global actions, whether they be stu dent rioting or deposing leaders of supposedly sovereign nations. I t is all in a day's work for the \"Olympians.\" From Mexico, Agee m oved on to align himself with Puerto Rican terrorist groups. D uring this time he became a trusted confidant of the Cuban dictator , Fidel Castro. It should not be imagined that while Agee was car rying out these operations, he was doing so as a \"rogue\" agen t. On the contrary, he was working for the CIA all during the se assignments. Trouble came when Castro's DGI (Cuban intelligence service) was able to \"turn\" him. Agee continued to work in his c apacity as a member of the CIA until his double role was uncover ed. This involved the biggest Soviet listening post in the W est located at Lourdes, Cuba.

Although we are told today in 1991 that \"Communis m is dead,\" the United States has done nothing to close down the vast spy operation which sits on our doorstep. Incidenta lly Lourdes has the capability of picking up even the weakest \"temp est\" signal, which is the type given off by a fax machine or an electric typewriter which, when deciphered, will give the co ntents of whatever is being typed or faxed. Lourdes remains d agger in the heart of the United States. There is absolutely no reason for its continued existence. If the U.S. and USSR are truly at peace with each other, why the continued need for so massive a spy operation? The simple truth is that, rather than re trenching personnel as we are led to believe, the KGB has tak en on additional recruits during 1990 and 1991. Bernard Levin is probably not a name that is well -known in the United States. Unlike decadent \"pop stars\" or H ollywood's latest miserable \"discovery,\" academics seldom if e ver come before the public eye. Of the hundreds of academics in the United States working under the Control of the Club of Rom e, Levin is worthy of special mention, if for no reason other t han his role in undermining Iran, the Philippines, South Africa, Ni caragua and South Korea. The demise of the Shah of Iran was run to a plan devised by Bernard Levin and Richard Falk, and supe rvised by Robert Anderson's Aspen Institute. Levin was the author of a work entitled \"Time Per spective and Morale\" which is a Club of Rome publication con cerning how to break down the morale of nations and individual leaders. Here is an extract of the document: \"One of the main techniques for breaking morale t hrough a strategy of terror consists in exactly this tactic: keep the person hazy as to where he stands and just what he may expe ct.

The Levin-Club of Rome plan is designed to demora lize us all so that in the end we feel we should follow wha tever it is that is planned for us. We WILL follow Club of Rome orders like sheep. Any seemingly strong leader who SUDDENLY APPEARS to \"rescue\" the nation must be regarded with the utmost suspici on. Remember that Khomeini was groomed for years by British inte lligence, especially during his time in Paris, before he sudd enly appeared as the savior of Iran. Boris Yeltsin is from the same M16-SIS stable. The Club of Rome feels confident that it has carr ied out it Committee of 300 mandate to \"soften up\" the United States.

The first Club of Rome conference in the United S tates was called by the Committee of 300 in 1969 under the ti tle: \"The Association of the Club of Rome.\" The next meeting was held in 1970 under the title \"Riverdale Center of Religious Research\" and was directed by Thomas Burney. Then followed the Wo odlands Conference held in Houston, Texas, starting in 1971 Thereafter, regular conferences have been held at Woodlands eve ry year. Also in 1971, at a later date, the Mitchell Energ y and Development Corporation held its energy strategy me eting for the Club of Rome: The recurring theme: LIMIT THE GROWTH OF THE U.S.A. Then to crown it all, the First Global Confe rence on the Future was held in July of 1980, attended by 4000 s ocial engineers and members of think tanks, all of whom were menber s of or affiliated with various institutions operating unde r Club of Rome umbrella organizations. The First Global Conference on the Future had the blessing of the White House which held its own conference ba sed on the transcripts of the First Global Conference forum.

Especially in the 1980 election, every candidate for the highest office in the United States was run by the CFR. Therefore it was of no consequence to the conspirators who wo n the presidential race. Through such Trojan Horses as the Heritage Foundation and the CFR, ALL key policy making posit ions in the new administrations were filled by the Council on F oreign Relations nominees, and before that, since the 1960's, by NAT OClub of Rome yes-men, thereby ensuring that key policy deci sions bore the indelible stamp of the Club of Rome and the CFR , acting as the executive arms of the Committee of 300. Both the 1984 and 1988 elections followed this longestablished pattern. Secretary of State George Schultz was the perfect choice of the Committee of 300 for the offi ce of Secretary of State. Schultz was always a creature of Henry Ki ssinger, the ruling order-giver for the CFR. Moreover, his posit ion with Bechtel, a key Committee of 300 company of global dimensions , gave him access to countries that might otherwise have been suspicious of his Kissinger connection. The Carter Administration accelerated the process of key pro-conspiracy personnel in key posi tions.

We have been en gaged in a devastatingly crippling war for the past 45 years, only it is not perceived as such. We are brainwashed, methodically and systematically, without ever being aware of it.

Major John Rawlings Reese, a British Army technician, was inst ructed to set up the largest brainwashing facility in the world at t he Tavistock Institute for Human Relations as a part of Sussex U niversity. This became the core of Britain's Psychological Warfare Bureau. When I first introduced the names of Reese and Tavistock i nto the United States in 1970, very little interest was shown. But over the years, as I revealed more and more about Tavistock and its vital role in the conspiracy, it has become popular to imitate my earlier research. Britain's Psychological Warfare Bureau made exten sive use of the work done by Reese on his 80,000 British Arm y guinea pigs, captive soldiers who underwent many forms of testin g. It was Tavistock-designed methods that got the United Stat es into the Second World War and which, under the guidance of D r. Kurt Lewin, established the OSS, the forerunner of the C IA. Lewin became the director of the Strategic Bombing Survey , which was a plan for the Royal Air Force to concentrate on bomb ing German worker housing while leaving military targets, such as munition plants, alone. The munition plants on both sides be longed to the international bankers who had no wish to see their assets destroyed. Later, after the war was over, NATO ordered Susse x University to establish a very special brainwashing center which became part of Britain's Psychological Warfare Bure au, only now, its research was directed toward civilian rather th an military applications. We shall return to that super secret unit which was called Science Policy Research Institute (SPRI) und er our chapters on drugs. The idea behind saturation bombing of civilian wo rker housing was to break the morale of the German worke r. It was not designed to affect the war effort against the Germa n military machine. Lewin and his team of actuaries reached a target figure, that if 65% of German worker housing was destroyed by nightly RAF bombing, the morale of the civilian population would collapse."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 49 The actual document was prepared by the Prudential Assurance Company. The RAF, under the command of \"Bomber\" Harris, ca rried out Lewin's plans, culminating in the terror firest orm bombing of Dresden, in which over 125,000, mainly old men, wom en and children, were killed. The truth of \"Bomber\" Harris 's horror raids on German civilians was a well kept secret until lo ng after the end of WW II. Tavistock provided most of the detailed programs that led to the establishing of the Office of Naval Intellig ence, (ONI) the number one intelligence service in the United State s, one which dwarfs the CIA in size and scope. Contracts worth b illions of dollars were given to Tavistock by the United State s Government and Tavistock's strategic planners provide most of what the Pentagon uses for our defense establishment, even t oday. Here again is illustrated the grip the Committee of 300 has on the United States, and the majority of our institutions . Tavistock runs over 30 research institutions in the United States, all of which we will name in our charts at the end of the book. These Tavistock-U.S. institutions have in many ca ses grown into gargantuan monsters, penetrating every aspect of our government agencies and taking command of all polic y making. One of Tavistock's chief wreckers of our way of lif e was Dr. Alexander King, a founder member of NATO and a favo rite with the Committee of 300, as well as an outstanding mem ber of the Club of Rome. Dr. King was assigned by the Club of Rome to destroy America's education by taking control of th e National Teachers Association and working in close conjunctio n with certain law makers and judges. If it was not generally known how all- pervading is the influence of the Committee of 300, this book should dispel every vestige of that doubt. The trial run for the Federal Emergency Managemen t Agency (FEMA) a Club of Rome creation came in a t est run against the nuclear power station at Three Mile Isl and, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Termed \"an accident\" by the hysterica l media, this was not an accident but a deliberately designed cri sis test for FEMA. An additional benefit was the fear and hyster ia created by"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 50 the news media which had people fleeing the area wh en in fact they were never in any danger. It was considered a success by FEMA and it scored a lot of points for the anti-nuclear forces. TMI became the rallying point for the so-called \"environmentalists,\" a highly fin anced and controlled group run out of Aspen Institute on beha lf of the Club of Rome. Coverage was provided free of charge by Wi lliam Paley of CBS television, a former British intelligence ag ent. FEMA is a natural successor to the Strategic Bomb ing Survey of WW II. Dr. Kurt Lewin, theoretician for w hat the Tavistock conspirators called crisis management, wa s deeply involved in the study. There is an unbroken chain b etween Lewin and Tavistock that stretches back for thirty-seven years. Lewin incorporated the Strategic Bombing Survey into FEMA , with only a few small adjustments proving necessary, one of the changes being the target, WHICH WAS NO LONGER GERMANY BUT T HE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Forty-five years after th e end of WW II it is still Tavistock that has its hands on t he trigger, and the weapon is pointed at the United States. The late Margaret Mead conducted an intensive stu dy of the German and Japanese population, under the aegis of Tavistock, on how they reacted to stress caused by aerial bomb ardment. Irving Janus was an associate professor on the proje ct which was supervised by Dr. John Rawlings Reese, promoted to Brigadier- General in the British Army. The test results were given to FEMA. The Irving Janus report was of great value in formu lating FEMA policies. Janus used it in a book which he later wr ote entitled AIR WAR AND STRESS. The ideas in his book were followed TO THE LETTER BY FEMA DURING THE THREE MILE ISLAND \"CRISIS .\" Janus had a really simple idea: Simulate a successi on of crises and manipulate the population following the Lewin terro r tactics and they will do exactly as required. In carrying out this exercise, Lewin discovered s omething new, that social control on a wide scale can be ach ieved by using the news media to bring home the horrors of a nucle ar war via the television media. It was discovered that women's ma gazines were very effective in dramatizing the terrors of a nucl ear war. A trial"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 51 run conducted by Janus had Betty Bumpers, wife of S enator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, \"writing\" for McCalls magazine on that subject. The article appeared in McCalls January 1983 issu e. Actually, Mrs. Bumpers did not write the article, i t was created for her by a group of writers at Tavistock whose specia lity such subject matters are. It was a collection of untruths , non-facts, innuendoes and conjectures based entirely upon false premises. The Bumpers article was typical of the kind of psyc hological manipulation at which Tavistock is so very good. No t one of the ladies who read McCalls could have failed to be imp ressed by the terror-horror story of what a nuclear war looks lik e. The Committee of 300 has a major bureaucracy at i ts disposal made up of hundreds of think tanks and fro nt organizations that run the whole gamut of private b usiness and government leaders. I will mention as many as I can fit in, starting with the German Marshall Fund. Its members, and rem ember they are also members of NATO and the Club of Rome, cons ist of David Rockefeller of Chase Manhattan Bank, Gabriel Hague of the prestigious Manufactures Hanover Trust and Finance Corporation, Milton Katz of the Ford Foundation, Willy Brandt, l eader of Socialist International, KGB agent and member of the Committe e of 300, Irving Bluestone, chairman of the United Auto Worke rs Executive Board, Russell Train, U.S. president of the Club of Rome and Prince Philip's World Wildlife Fund, Elizabeth Midg ely, CBS programs producer, B.

Hughes of the Carnegie Endowment Fund, Dennis Meadows and Jay Forrestor of MIT \"world dynamics.\" The Committee of 300, although in existence for o ver 150 years, did not take on its present form until aroun d 1897. It was always given to issuing orders through other fronts , such as the Royal Institute for International Affairs. When it was decided that a super-body would control European affairs, the RI IA founded the Tavistock Institute, which in turn created NATO. Fo r Five years NATO was financed by the German Marshall Fund. Perh aps the most important member of the Bilderbergers, a forei gn policy body"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 52 of the Committee, was Joseph Rettinger, said to hav e been its founder and organizer, whose annual meetings have d elighted conspiracy hunters for several decades. Rettinger was a well-trained Jesuit priest and a 33rd Degree Freemason. Mrs. Katherine Meyer Graham who i s suspected of having murdered her husband in order t o get control of the Washington Post, was another ranking member of the Club of Rome, as was Paul G. Hoffman of the New York Lif e Insurance Company, one of the largest insurance companies in the United States and a leading Rank company, with ties direct ly to Queen Elizabeth of England's immediate family. John J. Mc Cloy, the man who attempted to wipe post-World War II Germany off the map and last but not least, James A. Perkins of the Car negie Corporation, were also founding members of the Bild erbergers and the Club of Rome. What a star-studded cast! Yet strangely enough, f ew if any outside of genuine intelligence agencies had ever h eard of this organization until recent times. The power exercise d by these important personages and the corporations, televisi on stations newspapers, insurance companies and banks they repr esent matches the power and prestige of at least two Euro pean countries, and still this is only the tip of The Co mmittee of 300's enormous cross-gridding and interfaced interests. Not mentioned in the foregoing line-up is Richard Gardner who, although an early member of the Committee of 3 00, was sent to Rome on a special assignment. Gardner marri ed into one of the oldest Black Nobility families of Venice, th us providing the Venetian aristocracy a direct line to the White Hou se. The late Averill Harriman was another of the committee's dir ect links with the Kremlin and the White House, a position which K issinger inherited after the death of Harriman.

THE MONT PELERIN SOCIETY Mont Pelerin is an economic foundation devoted to issuing misleading economic theories and influencing econom ists in the Western world to follow models it lays out from tim e to time. Its leading practitioners are Von Hayek and Milton Frie dman. THE HOOVER INSTITUTION Founded originally to fight Communism, the instit ution has slowly but surely turned toward Socialism. It has a n annual budget of $2 million, funded by companies under the umbrel la of the Committee of 300. It now concentrates on \"peaceful changes\" with emphasis on arms control and domestic U.S. problems . It is Frequently used by the news media as a \"conservativ e\" organization whose views they seek when a conservat ive viewpoint is needed. The Hoover Institution is far from that, and following the 1953 take-over of the Institution by a group allied to the Club of Rome, it has become a One World-New Wor ld Order outlet for \"desirable\" policies. HERITAGE FOUNDATION Founded by brewery magnate Joseph Coors to act as a conservative think tank, Heritage was soon taken ov er by Fabianists Sir Peter Vickers Hall, Stuart Butler, S teven Ayzlei, Robert Moss and Frederich Von Hayek under the direc tion of the Club of Rome. This institute played a major role in carrying out British Labour leader Anthony Wedgewood Benn's orde r to \"Thatcherize Reagan.\" Heritage is certainly not a c onservative operation although at times it may look and sound l ike one.

In 1969, the Committee of 300 took over this important institution and turned it into a private non-profit organization run under the auspices of the Club of Rome. It is the largest behavioral research group in the U.S. One of its specialities is the study of small gro ups under stress and HUMRRO teaches the Army that a soldier i s merely an extension of his equipment and has brought great in fluence to bear on the \"man/weapon\" system and its \"human qual ity control,\" so widely accepted by the United States A rmy. HUMRRO has had a very pronounced effect on how the Army co nducts itself. Its mind-bending techniques are straight out of Tav istock. HUMRRO'S applied psychology courses are supposed to teach Army brass how to make the human weapon work. A goo d example of this is the manner in which soldiers in the war against Iraq were willing to disobey their field manual sta nding orders and bury 12,000 Iraqi soldiers alive. This type of brainwashing is terribly dangerous b ecause today, it is applied to the Army, the Army applies it to brutally destroy thousands of \"enemy\" soldiers, and tomorrow the Army could be told that civilian population groups oppos ed to government policies are \"the enemy.\" We are already a mindless brainwashed flock of sheep, yet it seems that HUMRR O can take mind bending and mind control a step further. HUMRR O is a valuable adjunct to Tavistock and many of the lesson s taught at HUMRRO were applied in the Gulf War, which makes it a little easier to understand how it came to be that America n soldiers behaved as ruthless and heartless killers, a far cr y from the concept of the traditional American fighting man. RESEARCH ANALYSlS CORPORATION. This is HUMRRO'S sister \"1984\" organization situa ted in McLean, Virginia.

One of the most important areas of cooperation between what think t anks turn out and what becomes government and public policy are t he \"pollsters.\" It is the job of the polling companies to mold and shape public opinion in the way that suits the cons pirators. Polls are constantly being taken by CBS-NBC-ABC, the New York Times, the Washington Post. Most of these efforts are coor dinated at the National Opinion Research Center where, as much as it will amaze most of us, a psychological profile was developed f or the entire nation. Findings are fed into the computers of Gallup Pol l and Yankelovich, Skelley and White for comparative eval uation. Much of what we read in our newspapers or see on televis ion has first been cleared by the polling companies. WHAT WE SEE IS WHAT THE POLLSTERS THINK WE SHOULD SEE. This is called \" public opinion making.\" The whole idea behind this bit of social conditioning is to find out how responsive the publ ic is to POLICY DIRECTIVES handed down by the Committee of 300. We are called \"targeted population groups\" and what is mea sured by the pollsters is how much resistance is generated to wh at appears in the \"Nightly News.\" Later, we shall learn exactly h ow this deceptive practice got started and who is responsib le for it. It is all part of the elaborate opinion-making pr ocess created at, Tavistock. Today our people believe the y are well- informed but what they do not realize is that the o pinions they believe are their own were in fact created in the r esearch institutions and think tanks of America and that no ne of us are free to form our own opinions because of the inform ation we are provided with by the media and the pollsters. Polling was brought to a fine art just before the United States entered the Second World War. Americans, unb eknown to themselves, were conditioned to look upon Germany a nd Japan as dangerous enemies who had to be stopped. In a sense , this was true, and that makes conditioned thinking all the m ore dangerous, because based on the INFORMATlON fed to them, the e nemy did indeed appear to be Germany and Japan. Just recentl y we saw"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 62 how well Tavistock's conditioning process works whe n Americans were conditioned to perceive Iraq as a threat and S addam Hussein as a personal enemy of the United States. Such a conditioning process is technically descri bed as \"the message reaching the sense organs of persons to be influenced.\" One of the most respected of all pollsters is Commi ttee of 300 member Daniel Yankelovich, of the company, Yankelov ich, Skelley and White. Yankelovich is proud to tell his student s that polling is a tool to change public opinion, although this is n ot original, Yankelovich having drawn his inspiration from David Naisbett's book \"TREND REPORT\" which was commissioned by the C lub of Rome. In his book Naisbett describes all of the techniq ues used by public opinion makers to bring about the public opi nion desired by the Committee of 300. Public opinion making is the jewel in the crown of the OLYMPIANS, for with their thousands of newscience social scientists at their beck and call, and with the news media firmly in their hands, NEW public opinions on almos t any subject can be created and disseminated around the world in a matter of two weeks. This is precisely what happened when their servan t George Bush was ordered to make war on Iraq. Within two we eks, not only the U.S. but almost the entire world public op inion was turned against Iraq and its President Saddam Hussein. Thes e media change artists and news manipulators report directl y to the Club of Rome which in turn reports to the Committee of 300 at whose head sits the Queen of England ruling over a vast n etwork of closely-linked corporations who never pay taxes and are answerable to no one, who fund their research insti tutions through foundations whose joint activities have almost total control over our daily lives. Together with their interlocking companies, insur ance business, banks, finance corporations, oil companie s, newspapers, magazines, radio and television, this vast apparatu s sits astride the United States and the world.

The Left rails against it, calling it \"imperialism\" which in deed it is, but the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 63 left is run by the same people, the very same ones who control the right, so that the left is no more free than we are ! Scientists engaged in the process of conditioning are called \"social engineers\" or \"new-science social scientist s\" and they play an integral part in what we see, hear and read. The \"old school\" social engineers were Kurt K. Lewin, Professor Hadl ey Cantril, Margaret Meade, Professor Derwin Cartwright and Pro fessor Lipssitt who, together with John Rawlings Reese, ma de up the backbone of new-science scientists at Tavistock Ins titute. During the Second World War, there were over 100 researchers at work under the direction of Kurt Lew in, copying slavishly the methods adopted by Reinhard Heydrich of the S.S. The OSS was based on Heydrich's methodology and, as we know, the OSS was the forerunner of the Central Intellige nce Agency. The point of all this is that the governments of Br itain and the United States already have the machinery in place t o bring us into line in a New World Order with only a slight modicu m of resistance materializing, and this machinery has been in place since 1946. Each passing year has added new refinements. It is this Committee of 300 which has established control networks and mechanisms far more binding than anyth ing ever seen in this world. Chains and ropes are not needed to restrain us. Our fear of what is to come does that job far more efficiently than any physical means of restraint. We have been brain washed to give up our Constitutional right to bear arms; to g ive up our Constitution itself; to allow the United Nations to exercise control over our foreign policies and the IMF to take contr ol of our fiscal and monetary policies; to permit the President to b reak United States law with impunity and to invade a foreign co untry and kidnap its head-of-state. In short we have been bra inwashed to the extent where we, as a nation, will accept each and every lawless act carried out by our government almost wi thout question. I for one know that we will soon have to fight to reclaim our country from the Committee, or lose it forever. BUT when it comes right down to it, how many will actually take up arms?

According to Brzezinski, we shall be under endless surveillance around the clock for 365 days a year ad infinitum. That we have been betrayed from within is being a ccepted by more and more people each year, and that is good , because it is through knowledge, a word translated from the wo rd BELIEF, that we shall be able to defeat the enemies of all mankind. While we were being distracted by the bogeymen in the Kre mlin, the Trojan Horse was moved into position in Washington D .C. The greatest danger free people face today is not from Moscow but from Washington D.C. We need first to conquer the D OMESTIC ENEMY, and after that we will be strong enough to m ount an offensive to remove Communism from the earth togeth er with all of its attendant \"isms.\" The Carter Administration accelerated the collaps e of our economy and our military strength, the latter begun by Club of Rome and Lucis Trust member Robert Strange McNamara .

Because of men like Dr. Alexander King and our blindfolded state of mind, we have failed to recogn ize the destruction of our educational institutions and sys tems of teaching.

Thanks to Dr. King, a man very few people in America know about, education in the U.S. is at its lowest level since 1786. Statistics produced by the Institute for Higher Learning show that the reading and writing c apabilities of high school children the United States are LOWER th an they were among high school children in 1786. What we face today is not only the loss of our fr eedom and the very fabric of our nation, but far worse, the p ossibility of the loss of our souls. The steady chipping away at the foundation upon which this republic rests has left an empty vo id, which satanists and cultists are rushing to fill with the ir synthetic soul material. This truth is difficult to accept and app reciate because there was nothing SUDDEN about these events. If a s udden shock were to hit us, a cultural and religious shock, we would be shaken out of our apathy. But gradualism—which is what Fabianism is, does n othing to raise the alarm. Because the vast majority of Ame ricans can see no MOTIVATION for the things I have described, they cannot accept it, and so the conspiracy is scorned and oft en mocked. By creating chaos through presenting hundreds of daily choices our people have to make, we have come down to a positio n where, unless motivation can be clearly shown, all informa tion is rejected. This is both the weak and the strong link in the conspiratorial chain. Most thrust aside anything th at has no motive, so the conspirators feel safe behind the ridicule p oured upon those who point to the coming crisis in our nation and ou r individual lives.

The problem is that our government is PART of the problem, part of the conspiracy, and nowhere and at no time has this become more clearly evident than during the Bu sh Presidency. Of course President Bush knows precisely what the C ommittee of 300 is doing to us. HE WORKS FOR THEM. Others have written to say, \"We thought we were fighting the government.\" Of course we are, but behind government stands a force so powerf ul and all- encompassing that intelligence agencies are even af raid to mention the name \"Olympians.\" Proof of the Committee of 300 is found in the vas t number of powerful institutions owned and controlled by it .

Stanfo rd was created to help Robert 0. Anderson and his ARCO oil company , who had secured for the Committee of 300 the oil rights on the North Slope of Alaska. Basically, the job was too large for Ande rson's Aspen Institute to handle, so a new center had to be foun ded and funded. That new center was Stanford Research Center. Alask a sold its rights on a downpayment of $900 million, a relative ly small amount for the Committee of 300. The governor of Al aska was steered to SRI for help and advice. This was no acc ident but the result of judicious planning and a process of long-r ange conditioning. Following the governor's call for help, three SRI scientists set up shop in Alaska where they met with the Alask an Secretary of State and the State Planning Office. Francis Gre ehan, who headed the SRI team, assured the Governor that his problem of how to handle the rich oil find would be safe in th e hands of SRI. Naturally Greehan did not mention the Committee of 300 or the Club of Rome. In less than a month Greehan assemble d a team of economists, petroleum scientists and new-science sc ientists numbering in the hundreds. The report SRI gave to t he Governor ran to eighty-eight pages. The proposal was adopted virtually without change by the Alaska legislature in 1970. Greehan had indeed done a remarkable job for the Committee of 300. From this beginning SR I developed into an institution employing 4000 people with an a nnual budget of $160 million plus. Its President, Charles A. And erson, has seen much of this growth during his tenure, as has Profe ssor Willis Harmon, director of the SRI Center for the Study of Social Policies, employing hundreds of new-science scientists, many of the top staffers having been transferred from Tavistock's L ondon base. One of those was RCA board chairman and former Brit ish intelligence agent, David Sarnoff, who was closely involved with"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 68 Harmon and his team for twenty-five years. Sarnoff was something of a \"watchdog\" for the mother institute in Sussex. Stanford claims to make no moral judgments on proje cts it accepts, working for Israel and the Arabs, South Af rica and Libya but, as one would imagine, by adopting this attitud e it ensures an \"inside edge\" with foreign governments that the CIA has found most useful. In Jim Ridgeway's book, \"THE CLOSED CORPORATION,\" SRI spokesman Gibson brags about SRI' s non- discriminatory stance. Although not on the Federal Contract Research Center lists, SRI is today the largest mil itary think tank, dwarfing Hudson and Rand. Among SRl's speciality de partments are chemical and biological warfare experimental ce nters. One of Stanford's more dangerous activities is co unter- insurgency operations aimed at civilian populations —just the sort of \"1984\" things government is already using agains t its own people. The U.S. government pays SRI millions of do llars each year for this kind of highly controversial \"researc h.\" Following student protests against chemical warfare experimen ts conducted at Stanford, SRI \"sold\" itself to a private group f or just $25 million. Of course nothing really changed, SRI was still a T avistock project and the Committee of 300 still owned it, but the gu llible appeared to be satisfied by this meaningless cosmetic change . In 1958 a startling new development arose. Advanc ed Research Products Agency (ARPA), a contracting agen cy for the Defense Department, approached SRI with a top secre t proposal. John Foster at the Pentagon told SRI that what was needed was a program to insure the United States against \"techno logical surprise.\" Foster wanted to perfect a condition whe re the environment became a weapon; special bombs to trigg er volcanos and/or earthquakes, behavioral research on potentia l enemies and minerals and metals with potential for new weapons. The project was accepted by SRI and code-named \"SHAKY.\" The massive electronic brain in SHAKY was capable of carrying out many commands, its computers having be en constructed by IBM for SRI. Twenty-eight scientists worked on what is called \"Human Augmentation.\" The IBM comput er even has the capability to solve problems by analogy and recognizes"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 69 and identifies scientists who work with it. The \"sp ecial applications\" of this tool can be better imagined t han described. Brzezinski knew what he was talking about when he w rote \"THE TECHNOTRONIC ERA.\" Stanford Research Institute works closely with sc ores of civilian consulting firms, trying to apply military technology to domestic situations. This has not always been a suc cess, but as techniques improve, the prospects for massive all-p ervading surveillance, as described by Brzezinski, daily bec omes more real. IT ALREADY EXISTS AND IS IN USE, EVEN THOUGH SLIGHT MALFUNCTIONS FROM TIME TO TIME HAVE TO BE IRONED OU T. One such civilian consulting firm was Schriever McK ee Associates of McLean, Virginia, run by retired General Bernard A. Schriever, a former chief of the Air Force Systems Command, who developed the Titan, Thor, Atlas and Minuteman rockets. Schriever put together a consortium of Lockheed, Emmerson Electric, Northrop, Control Data, Raytheon and TRW under the name of URBAN SYSTEMS ASSOCIATES, INC. Th e purpose of the consortium? To solve social and psyc hological \"urban problems\" by means of military techniques us ing advanced electronic systems. It is interesting to note that TRW became the largest credit information collecting company in th e credit- reporting business as a result and an outcome of it s work with Urban Systems Associates, Inc. This should tell us a great deal about just how fa r this nation is already under TOTAL SURVEILLANCE, which i s the first requirement of the Committee of 300. No dictatorshi p, especially not one on a global scale, can function without tot al control over each and every individual. SRI was well on its way to becoming a key Committee of 300 research organization. By the 1980's, 60% of SRl's contracts were devote d to \"Futurism\" with both military and civilian applicat ions. Its major clients were the U.S. Department of Defense-Directo rate of Defense Research and Engineering, Office of Aerospa ce Research which dealt with \"Applications of the Behavioral Sc iences to Research Management,\" Executive Office of the Presi dent, Office of Science and Technology, U.S. Department of Healt h. On behalf"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 70 of the Department of Health, SRI ran a program call ed \"'Patterns in ESDEA Title I Reading Achievement Tests.\" Other clients were the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Department of Transportation and the National Scien ce Foundation (NSF). Of significance was the paper developed for NSF, entitled \"Assessment of Future and International Problems.\" Stanford Research, under the tutelage of Tavistoc k Institute in London, put together a far reaching an d chilling system it called \"Business Intelligence Program.\" In exces s of 600 companies in the U.S. and abroad became subscribers . The program covered research in Japanese Foreign Busine ss Relations, Consumer Marketing in a Period of Change, The Mount ing Challenge of International Terrorism, Sensory Evalu ation in Consumer Products, Electronic Funds Transfer System , Opto- Electric Sensing, Exploratory Planning Methods, the U.S. Defense Industry and Capital Availability. Among the TOP Co mmittee of 300 companies who became clients of this program we re Bechtel Corporation (George Schultz was on its board), Hewl ett Packard, TRW, Bank of America, Shell Company, RCA, Blyth, Ea stman Dillon, Saga Foods Corporation, McDonnell Douglas, Crown Ze llerbach, Wells Fargo Bank and Kaiser Industries. But one of the most sinister of all SRI programs with the possibilities of doing tremendous damage in alterin g the direction in which the United States will go, socially, moral ly and religiously, was Stanford's Charles F. Kettering Foundation's \"C HANGING IMAGES OF MAN\" under Stanford official reference \"C ontract Number URH (489)-2150 Policy Research Report Number 4/4/74, Prepared by the SRI Center for the Study of Social Policy, Director Willis Harmon.\" This is probably one of the most fa r-reaching investigations into how man might be changed that h as ever been conducted. The report, covering 319 pages, was written by 14 new science scientists under the supervision of Tavisto ck and 23 top controllers including B. F. Skinner, Margaret Meade , Ervin Lazlo and Sir Geoffrey Vickers, a high-level British inte lligence officer in M16. It will be recalled that his son-in-law, Sir P eter Vickers Hall, was a founding member of the so-called conservative \"Heritage Foundation.\" Much of the 3000 pages of \"recommendat ions\" given"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 71 to the Reagan administration in January 1981 were b ased upon material taken from Willis Harmon's \"CHANGING IMAGE S OF MAN.\" I was privileged to receive a copy of \"THE CHANGI NG IMAGES OF MAN\" from my intelligence colleagues five days after it was accepted by the United States government. What I read shocked me, as I realized I was looking at a bluepr int for a future America, unlike anything I had ever seen before. Th e nation was to be programmed to change and become so accustomed to such planned changes that it would hardly be noticeable when profound changes did occur. We have gone downhill so fast si nce \"THE AQUARIAN CONSPIRACY\" (the book title of Willis Harm on's technical paper) was written, that today, divorce d raws no stigma, suicide is at an all time high and raises few eyebr ows, social deviations from the norm and sexual aberrations, on ce unmentionable in decent circles, are now commonplac e and excite no special protest. As a nation we have not noticed how \"CHANGING IMA GES OF MANKIND\" has radically altered our American way of life forever. Somehow we were overcome by the \"Watergate Syndrome.\" For a while we were shocked and dismayed to learn that Nixon was nothing but a cheap crook who hobnob bed with Earl Warren's Mafia friends at the beautiful home t hey built for him adjoining the Nixon estate. When too many \"future sh ocks\" and news headlines demanded our attention, we lost our way, or rather, the huge number of choices with which we we re and still are daily confronted, confused us to such a degree that we were no longer able to make the necessary choices. Worse yet, having been subjected to a barrage of crimes in high places, plus the trauma of the Vietnam War, ou r nation seemed no longer to want truths. Such reaction is c arefully explained in Willis Harmon's technical paper, in sh ort, the American nation was reacting exactly as profiled. W orse yet, in not wishing to accept truth, we took matters a step fur ther: We looked to government to shield us from the truth. The corrupt stench of the Reagan-Bush Administrat ions we wanted covered with six feet of earth. The crimes c ommitted"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 72 under the title of Iran/Contra affair (or scandals) , we didn't want uncovered. We let our President lie to us regarding his where abouts in the period October 20-23rd, 1980. Yet the se crimes far exceed in quantity and scope anything Nixon did whi le he was in office. Do we as a nation recognize it as going dow nhill with our brakes off? No, we do not. When those whose business it is to bring the truth to the American people that a private, we ll-organized little government inside the White House was busy c ommitting one crime after another, crimes which attacked the very soul of this nation and the republican institutions upon which i t rested, we were told not to bother the public with such things . \"We really don't want to know about all this speculation,\" bec ame a standard response. When the highest elected official of the land bla tantly put U.N. law above the Constitution of the United State s—an impeachible offense, the majority accepted it as \"no rmal.\" When the highest elected official of the land went to wa r without a Congressional declaration of war, the fact was cens ored out by the news media and, again, we accepted it rather than f ace the truth. When the Gulf War, which our President plotted an d planned, began, not only were we happy with censors hip of the most blatant kind, we even took it to our hearts, b elieving that it was \"good tor the war effort.\" Our President lied, April Glaspie lied, the State Department lied. They said the war was jus tified because President Hussein had been warned to leave Kuwait a lone. When Glaspie's cables to the State Department were final ly made public, one United States Senator after another went chargi ng to defend Glaspie, the harlot. It mattered not that they came from both the Democrats and the Republicans. We, the people, let them get away with their vile lies. In this public attitude of the American people, t he wildest dreams of Willis Harmon and his teams of scientists became a reality. The Tavistock Institute was elated at its success in destroying the self respect and self esteem of this once great nation. We are told that we won the Gulf War. What is not yet perceived by the vast majority of Americans is that, in winning the"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 73 war, it cost the self respect and honor of our nati on. That lies rotting in the desert sands of Kuwait and Iraq, alo ngside the corpses of the Iraqi soldiers we butchered in the a greed retreat from Kuwait and Basra—we could not keep our word th at we would abide by the Geneva Conventions and not attac k them. \"What do you want,\" our controllers asked us, \"vict ory or self respect? You can't have both.\" One hundred years ago, this could not have happen ed, but now it has happened and excites no comment. We have succumbed to the long range penetration warfare wag ed against this nation by Tavistock. Like the German nation, d efeated by the Prudential Bombing Survey, enough of us have succum bed to make this nation the kind that totalitarian regimes of the past would have only envisaged in their dreams. \"Here,\" they would say, \"is a nation, one of the largest in the world, that doesn't want the truth. All of our propaganda agencies can be dispen sed with. We don't have to struggle to keep the truth from this nation, they have willingly rejected it of their own volition. T his nation is a pushover.\" Our once proud Republic of the United States of A merica became no more than a series of criminal front orga nizations, which history shows is always the start of totalita rianism. This is the stage of permanent alteration we are at in Amer ica as 1991 drew to a close. We live in a throw-away society, p rogrammed not to last. We do not even flinch at the 4 million hom eless nor the 30 million jobless, nor the 15 million babies murdered thus far. They are \"throw-aways\" of the Age of Aquarius, a conspir acy so damnable that, when first confronted with it, the m ajority will disavow its existence, rationalizing these events a s \"times have changed.\" This is how the Tavistock Institute and Willis Ha rmon programmed us to react. Dismantling of our ideals g oes on without protest. The spiritual and intellectual drive of ou r people has been destroyed! On May 27th, 1991, President Bush made a very profound statement, the thrust of which appears to have been totally misused by most political commentators: "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 74 \"The moral dimension of American policy requires us to chart a moral course through a world of lesser evil s. That is the real world, not black and white. Very few moral abs olutes.\" What else could we expect from a President who is most probably the most evil man ever to occupy the White House? Consider this in the light of his order to the mili tary to bury alive 12,000 Iraqi soldiers. Consider this in the light o f his ongoing war of genocide against the Iraqi people. President Bus h was delighted to characterize President Saddam Hussein as the \"Hi tler of our times.\" He never bothered to offer a single scrap o f proof. It was not needed. Because President Bush made the stateme nt, we accepted it without question. Consider this in the bright light of truth, that he did all of these things in the name of the American people while secretly taking his orders from the Co mmittee of 300. But, more than anything else, consider this: Presid ent Bush and his controllers feel so secure that they no longer deem it necessary to hide their evil control of the American people, or to lie about it. This is self-evident in the statement that he, as o ur leader, will make all manner of compromises with truth, honesty and decency if his controllers (and ours) deem it necessary. On May 27th, 1991, the President of the United States abandoned each a nd every principle embodied in our Constitution and boldly p roclaimed that he was no longer bound by it. This is a great victo ry for the Tavistock Institute and the Prudential Bombing Surv ey, whose target changed from German worker housing in 1945 t o the soul of the American people in a war that began in 1946 and runs through to 1992. Increased pressure on this nation for change was applied by Stanford Research Institute in the early 1960's. SRl's offensive gathered power and momentum. Switch on your televis ion set and you will see Stanford's victory in front of your ve ry eyes: talk shows featuring heavy sexual details, special video channels where perversion, rock and roll and drugs reign supreme. Where once John Wayne ruled, we now have a made-over apology f or a man (or is he?) called Michael Jackson, a parody of a h uman being who is held up as a hero, as he gyrates, shuffles, mumb les and screams his way across television screens in millio ns of American homes.

One filthy, half-washed drug-rid den decalent rock band after another has hours of air time devot ed to its inane sounds and mad gyrations, clothes fashions and lang uage aberrations.

We have been subjected and we have succumbe d to what Tavistock Institute calls \"future shocks\" whose fut ure is NOW and we are so numbed by one cultural shock after anothe r that to protest seems like a futile gesture and, therefore, logically we think, it does no good to protest. In 1986 the Committee of 300 ordered the pressure turned up. The U.S. was not going down fast enough. The Un ited States began the process of \"recognizing\" the butchers of Cambodia, the criminal Pol Pot regime, self confessors to the mur der of 2 million Cambodian citizens. In 1991, the wheel turned the f ull circle. The United States went to war against a friendly nation that had been programmed to trust the Washington traitors. We acc used President Hussein of the small nation of Iraq of al l manner of evil, NONE OF WHICH WAS EVEN REMOTELY TRUE. We killed and maimed its children, we left them to starve and to die of all manner of diseases. In the same breath we sent the Bush emissaries of the Committee of 300 to Cambodia to RECOGNIZE THE EVIL MASS MURDERERS OF 2 MILLION CAMBODIANS, who were sacrifi ced by the Committee of 300's depopulation of cities exper iment, which the big cities of the United States will experience in the not too distant future. Now, President Bush and his Committ ee of 300- ridden administration say, in effect, \"Look people, what do you want from me? I told you that I will compromise whe re I see fit, even when that means sleeping with the Pol Pot murd erers. SO WHAT—KISS MY HIPS.\" The level of pressure for change will reach its p eak in 1993 and we shall witness scenes such as we would never have thought possible.

The personal computer card which, when fully dist ributed, will deprive us of our familiar environment and, as we shall see, environment means a lot more than the usually accep ted meaning of the word. The United States has gone through a p eriod of intense trauma such as has never been visited on an y other nation in the history of the world, and the worst is yet t o come. Everything is going according to what Tavistock o rdered and what the social scientists at Stanford mapped o ut. Times do not change; they are made to change. All changes ar e preplanned and come as the result of careful action. We have b een changed gradually at first, but now the pace of change is p icking up. The United States is being transformed from One Nation Under God to a polyglot of nations under several gods. The U.S. is no longer One nation under God. The framers of the Constituti on have lost the battle. Our forebears spoke a common language and believe d in a common religion Christianity, and held common ideal s. There were no aliens in our midst; that came later in a delibe rately planned attempt to break up the United States into a series of fragmented nationalities, cultures and beliefs. If you doubt t his, go down to the East Side of New York, or the West Side of Los Angeles on any given Saturday and look around you. The United Stat es has become several nations struggling to coexist under a common system of government. When the floodgates of immigr ation were opened wide by Franklin D. Roosevelt, a cousin of t he head of the Committee of 300, the cultural shock caused great c onfusion and dislocation and made \"One Nation\" an unworkable con cept. The Club of Rome and NATO have exacerbated the situatio n. \"Love thy neighbor\" is an ideal that will not work unless you r neighbor \"is as yourself.\" To the framers of our Constitution, the truths th ey laid out For future generations were \"self evident\"—to thems elves Being"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 77 unsure that future generations would also find the truths to which they bound this nation self evident, THEY SET ABOUT SPELLlNG THEM OUT. IT SEEMS THAT THEY WERE AFRAID OF A TIME THAT MIGHT COME WHEN THE TRUTHS THEY ESPOUSED WOULD NO LONGER BE SELF-EVIDENT. The Tavistock Institute for Human Relations has made sure that what the framers feare d might come to pass has indeed come to pass. That time has arri ved with Bush and his \"no absolutes\" and his New World Order unde r the Committee of 300. This is part of the concept of social changes for ced upon Americans which Harmon and the Club of Rome said wo uld make for severe trauma and a great building up of pressu re. The social upheavals that have taken place since the advent of Tavistock, the Club of Rome and NATO will continue in the U.S. for as long as the limit of absorption is ignored. Nations are made up of individuals and, like individuals, there is a limit to their ab ility to absorb changes, no matter how robust they may be. This psychological truth was well proven by the S trategic Bombing Survey which called for saturation bombing of German worker housing. As mentioned earlier, the project w as the work of the Prudential Insurance Company and no one doubts today that Germany suffered its defeat because of this operati on. Many of the scientists who worked on that project are working o n saturation bombing of America, or else they have passed on, le aving their skilled techniques in the hands of others who follo wed behind them. The legacy they left behind them can be found in the fact that we have not so much lost our way as a nation, but that we have been steered in a direction opposite to that w hich the framers of the Declaration guided us for over 200 y ears. We have, in short, lost contact with our historical genes, o ur faith, which inspired countless generations of Americans to move forward as a nation, benefiting from the patrimony left to us by the framers of the Declaration of Independence and the United Stat es Constitution. That we are lost is clear to all who seek the truth, as unpleasant as it may be. "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 78 With President Bush and his \"no absolute morals\" guiding us, we blunder ahead as lost nations and individual s tend to do. We are collaborating with the Committee of 300 for our own downfall and our own enslavement. Some sense it—and feel a strong sense of unease. The various conspiracy theo ries they are familiar with do not seem to cover it all. This is because they know nothing of the Conspirators'Hierarchy, The Committe e of 300. These souls who feel a deep sense of unease and t hat something is radically wrong, yet cannot put their collective fingers on the problem, walk in darkness. They look to a fu ture they see slipping away from them. The American dream has bec ome a mirage. They place their faith in religion but take no steps to help that faith along by ACTION. Americans will never ex perience a retracing of steps such as the Europeans experience d when at the height of the Dark Ages. By determined ACTlON, they awoke in themselves a spirit of renewal which resulted in th e glorious Renaissance. The enemy that has directed them to this point de cided to make a strong move against the United States in 198 0, so that Renaissance of America would be impossible. Who is the enemy? The enemy is no faceless \"they.\" The enemy is clear ly identifiable as the Committee of 300, the Club of Rome, NATO and all of its affiliated organizations, the think tanks and resea rch institutions controlled by Tavistock. There is no need to use \"t hey\" or \"the enemy\" except as shorthand. WE KNOW WHO \"THEY,\" THE ENEMY, IS.

We Americans have fa llen asleep, given way to apathy caused by being confronted with a multplicity of choices which has confused us. These are the cha nges that alter our environment, break down our resistance to change so that we become dazed, apathetic and eventually fall asleep in the thick of battle. There is a technical term for this condition. It is called \"long range penetration strain.\" The art of subjecting a v ery large group of people to continued long range penetration strai n was developed by scientists working out of the Tavistoc k Institute of Human Relations and their U. S. subsidiaries, Stanf ord Research and Rand Corporation, and at least another 150 rese arch institutions here in the U.S. Dr. Kurt Lewin, the scientist who developed this fiendish warfare, has caused the average American patriot to fret over various conspiracy theories, leaving him or her wit h a feeling of uncertainty and insecurity, isolated and perhaps ev en afraid, as he searches, but fails to understand the decay and rot caused by \"THE CHANGING IMAGES OF MANKIND,\" unable to identif y or combat the social, moral, economic and political ch anges he deems undesirable and does not want, yet which incr ease in intensity on every hand. Dr. Lewin's name will not be found in any of our establishment history books which, in any event, ar e a record of events mostly from the side of the ruling class or the victors of wars. Therefore, it is with pride that I introduce his name to you. As mentioned before, Dr. Lewin organized the Harvar d Psychological Clinic and the Institute for Social R esearch under the auspices of the Tavistock Institute. The names do n ot give much indication of the purpose of the two organizations. This reminds me of the infamous bill to reform co inage and mint laws passed in 1827. The title of the bill was harmless enough or sounded harmless, which was the intention of its backers. Through this Act, Senator John Sherman bet rayed the nation into the hands of the international bankers. Sherman allegedly sponsored the bill \"without reading it.\" As we know, the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 80 bill's true purpose was to demonetize silver and gi ve the thieving bankers unlimited power over the credit of our nati on; powers to which the bankers were clearly not entitled under t he clear and unmistakable terms of the U.S. Constitution. Kurt Lewin gave the Tavistock Institute, the Club of Rome and NATO unlimited power over America, to which no organization, entity or society is entitled. These institutions h ave used the usurped powers to destroy the will of the nation to resist the plans and intentions of the conspirators to rob us of the fruits of the American Revolution and steer us on a course leadin g directly to a New Dark Ages under a One World Government. Lewin's colleagues in this long range penetration objective were Richard Crossman, Eric Trist, H. V. Dicks, Wil lis Harmon, Charles Anderson, Garner Lindsay, Richard Price and W. R. Bion. Again, these names never appear in the evening news ; in fact, they only appear in scientific journals—so very few Americans are aware of them and not at all aware of what the men behind the names have done and are doing to the United States. President Jefferson once said he pitied those who thought they knew what was taking place through reading the newspaper. Disraeli, the British prime minister, said much the same thing. Indeed, down through the ages, rulers have delighte d in running things from behind the scenes. Man has always felt the need to dominate and nowhere and at no time is the desire m ore prevalent than in this modern era. If it were not so, why all the need for secret so cieties? If we are ruled by an open system run by democraticall y elected officials, why the need for a secret Masonic order in every village, town and city across the United States? How is it t hat Freemasonry can operate so openly and yet keep its secrets so well hidden? We can't ask the Nine Unknown Men of t he Nine Sisters Lodge in Paris that question, nor can we as k it of their nine fellows in the Quatuar Coronati Lodge in London.

In 1980 the Aquarian Conspiracy was in full swing and its succe ss can be seen in every facet of our private and national life. Th e overwhelming rise in mindless violence, serial killers, teenage suicides, the unmistakable signs of lethargy—\"long range penetrat ion\" is a part of our new environment, as dangerous, if not more s o, than the polluted air that we breathe. The coming of the Age of Aquarius caught America totally unprepared. We as a nation were not prepared for th e changes about to be forced upon us. Who ever had heard of T avistock, Kurt Lewin, Willis Harmon and John Rawlings Reese? They were not even on the American political scene. What we w ould have noticed, if we bothered to look at all, was a falli ng off of our ability to withstand futuristic shock as we became more fat igued, distressed and eventually entered a period of psych ological shock followed by widespread apathy as an outward manifes tation of long range penetration warfare. The Age of Aquarius was best described by Tavisto ck Institute as the vehicle for delivering turbulence: \"There are three distinct phases in the response and reaction to str ess displayed by large social groups.

Well-meaning people who specialize in these thing s blame a lot of the problem on education, or what passes f or it in the United States. Criminals now abound in the age grou ps 9-15. Rapists are quite commonly as young as 10. Our soci al specialists, our teacher's unions, our churches say it is all du e to a faulty education system. Witness how test scores keep drop ping. The specialists bewail the fact that the United States now ranks around 39th in the level of education in the world. Why do we bemoan what is so obvious?

THE FACT IS, THE COMMITTEE OF 300, WITH THE APPROVAL OF OUR GOVERNMENT, DOES NOT WANT OUR YOUTH TO BE PROPERLY EDUCATED. The education that Freemas on Justice Hugo Black, Alexander King, Gunnar Myrdal a nd his wife came to give the children of the United States is t hat CRIME PAYS, EXPEDIENCY IS WHAT COUNTS. They taught our children that United States law i s unequally applied, and that is perfectly in order. Our children were"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 83 properly educated by a decade of corrupt examples; Ronald Reagan and George Bush were ruled by greed and beca me totally corrupted by it. Our education system hasn't failed . Under the guidance of King, Black and the Myrdals it is actua lly a great success, but it all depends from whose point of vie w we look at it. The Committee of 300 is DELIGHTED with our educatio n system, and will not allow one comma of it to be changed. According to Stanford and Willis Harmon, the indu ced trauma of long range penetration of which our educa tion is a part, has been going on for 45 years, yet how many are aw are of the insidious pressures being applied to our society an d the constant exposure to brainwashing that goes on every day? Th e mysterious gang wars that broke out in New York in the 1950's is an example of how the conspirators can create and stage-manage any type of disruptive elements they like. Where those gang war s came from nobody knew until the 1980's when researchers uncov ered the hidden controllers who directed the so-called \"soci al phenomena.\" Gang wars were carefully planned at Stanford, del iberately designed to shock society and cause ripples of dist urbances. By 1958 there were in excess of 200 of these gangs. Th ey were made popular by a musical and a Hollywood movie, \"West S ide Story.\" After making the news for a decade, suddenly, in 19 66, they disappeared off the streets of New York, Los Angele s New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Chicago. Throughout the near decade of gang violence, the public reacted according to the profiled response Stanford expected; society as a whole could not comprehend gang warfar e and the public responded in a maladaptive manner. Had there been those wise enough to recognize in gang wars a Stanford ex periment in social engineering and brainwashing, the conspirato r's plot would have been exposed. Either we did not have trained s pecialists who could see what was going on—which is highly unlikel y—or else they were threatened and remained silent. The coope ration with Stanford by the news media brought to light a \"new age\" attack on our environment just as predicted by the social e ngineers and new-science scientists at Tavistock. "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 84 In 1989 gang warfare, as a social conditioning to change, was reintroduced to the streets of Los Angeles. Wit hin a few short months of the first incidents, gangs began to proli ferate-first in the scores, then in the hundreds on the streets of the East Side of Los Angeles. Crack houses and rampant prostitution prol iferated; drug dealers dominated the streets. Anybody who got in t heir way was gunned down. The outcry in the press was loud and l ong. Stanford's targeted large population group began de fending itself with slogans. This is what Tavistock called the fir st phase, with the targeted group failing to identify the source of th e crisis. The second phase of the gang war crisis was \"fragmentation.\" People not living in the areas fre quented by gangs said, \"Thank God they are not in our neighbor hood.\" This ignored the fact that the crisis continued with or without recognition and that social order in Los Angeles ha d begun to break down. As profiled by Tavistock, those groups not affected by gang war \"broke away to defend themselves\" because the source of the crisis was not identified, the so called \"ma ladaptation\" process the period of disassociation. Apart from the proliferation of drug sales, what is the purpose of gang wars? First, it is to show the targ eted group that they are not safe, i.e., insecurity is generated. S econdly, it is to show that organized society is helpless in the face of such violence and thirdly to bring about a recognition of the fac t that our social order is collapsing. The present wave of gang viole nce will go away just as quickly as it started, once the three p hases of the Stanford program are completed. An outstanding example of social conditioning to accept change, even when it is recognized as unwelcome cha nge by the large population group in the sights of Stanford Re search Institute, was the \"advent\" of the BEATLES. The Beatles were b rought to the United States as part of a social experiment which would subject large population groups to brainwashing of which th ey were not even aware. When Tavistock brought the Beatles to the United States nobody could have imagined the cultural disaster th at was to follow in their wake. The Beatles were an integral part of \"THE"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 85 AQUARIAN CONSPIRACY,\" a living organism which spran g From \"THE CHANGING IMAGES OF MAN,\" URH (489)2150-Policy Research Report No. 4/4/74. Policy Report prepared by SRI Center for the study of Social Policy, Director, Professor Willis Harmon. The phenomenon of the Beatles was not a spontaneo us rebellion by youth against the old social system. I nstead it was a carefully crafted plot to introduce by a conspirato rial body which could not be identified, a highly destructive and d ivisive element into a large population group targeted for change a gainst its will. New words and new phrases—prepared by Tavistock-wer e introduced to America along with the Beatles. Words such as \"rock\" in relation to music sounds, \"teenager,\" \"co ol,\" \"discovered\" and \"pop music\" were a lexicon of disguised code wo rds signifying the acceptance of drugs and arrived with and accomp anied the Beatles wherever they went, to be \"discovered\" by \" teenagers.\" Incidentally, the word \"teenagers\" was never used u ntil just before the Beatles arrived on the scene, courtesy of the T avistock Institute for Human Relations. As in the case of gang wars, nothing could or wou ld have been accomplished without the cooperation of the me dia, especially the electronic media and, in particular, the scurrilous Ed Sullivan who had been coached by the conspirators a s to the role he was to play. Nobody would have paid much attenti on to the motley crew from Liverpool and the 12-atonal system of \"music\" that was to follow had it not been for an overabund ance of press exposure. The 12-atonal system consisted of heavy, repetitive sounds, taken from the music of the cult of Dionysu s and the Baal priesthood by Adorno and given a \"modern\" flavor by this special friend of the Queen of England and hence the Commit tee of 300. Tavistock and its Stanford Research Center create d trigger words which then came into general usage around \"ro ck music\" and its fans. Trigger words created a distinct new break-away largely young population group which was persuaded by social engineering and conditioning to believe that the Be atles really were their favorite group. All trigger words devise d in the context of \"rock music\" were designed for mass control of t he new targeted group, the youth of America. "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 86 The Beatles did a perfect job, or perhaps it woul d be more correct to say that Tavistock and Stanford did a pe rfect job, the Beatles merely reacting like trained robots \"with a little help from their friends\"—code words for using drugs and makin g it \"cool.\" The Beatles became a highly visible \"new type\"—more Tavistock jargon—and as such it was not long before the group made new styles (fads in clothing, hairstyles and language u sage) which upset the older generation, as was intended. This w as part of the \"fragmentation-maladaptation\" process worked out by Willis Harmon and his team of social scientists and geneti c engineering tinkerers and put into action. The role of the print and electronic media in our society is crucial to the success of brainwashing large popula tion groups. Gang wars ended in Los Angeles in 1966 as the media withdrew its coverage. The same thing will happen with the curre nt wave of gang wars in Los Angeles. Street gangs will wither on the vine once media saturation coverage is toned down and th en completely withdrawn. As in 1966, the issue would b ecome \"burned out.\" Street gangs will have served their p urpose of creating turbulence and insecurity. Exactly the sam e pattern will be followed in the case of \"rock\" music. Deprived o f media attention, it will eventually take its place in his tory. Following the Beatles, who incidentally were put together by the Tavistock Institute, came other \"Made in Eng land\" rock groups, who, like the Beatles, had Theo Adorno writ e their cult lyrics and compose all the \"music.\" I hate to use t hese beautiful words in the context of \"Beatlemania\"; it reminds m e of how wrongly the word \"lover\" is used when referring to the filthy interaction between two homosexuals writhing in pig swill. To call \"rock\" music, is an insult, likewise the language u sed in \"rock lyrics.\" Tavistock and Stanford Research then embarked on the second phase of the work commissioned by the Commit tee of 300. This new phase turned up the heat for social change in America. As quickly as the Beatles had appeared on the Ameri can scene, so too did the \"beat generation,\" trigger words design ed to separate and fragment society. The media now focused its att ention on the \"beat generation.\" Other Tavistock-coined words cam e seemingly"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 87 out of nowhere: \"beatniks,\" \"hippies,\" \"flower chil dren\" became part of the vocabulary of America. It became popula r to \"drop out\" and wear dirty jeans, go about with long unwashed h air. The \"beat generation\" cut itself off from mainstream America. They became just as infamous as the cleaner Beatles before them. The newly-created group and its \"lifestyle\" swept millions of young Americans into the cult. American youth un derwent a radical revolution without ever being aware of it, while the older generation stood by helplessly, unable to identify the source of the crisis, and thus reacting in a maladaptive manner a gainst its manifestation, which were drugs of all types, mariju ana, and later Lysergic acid, \"LSD,\" so conveniently provided for them by the Swiss pharmaceutical company, SANDOZ, following the discovery by one of its chemists, Albert Hoffman, how to make synthetic ergotamine, a powerful mind-altering drug. The Comm ittee of 300 financed the project through one of their banks, S. C. Warburg, and the drug was carried to America by the philosop her, Aldous Huxley. The new \"wonder drug\" was promptly distributed in \"sample\" size packages, handed out free of charge o n college campuses across the United States and at \"rock\" con certs, which became the leading vehicle for proliferating the us e of drugs. The question that cries out for an answer is, what was the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) doing at the time? There i s compelling circumstantial evidence that would appear to indica te that the DEA knew what was going on but was ordered not to take any action. With very substantial numbers of new British \"roc k\" bands arriving in the U.S., rock concerts began to become a fixture on the social calender of American youth. In tandem wi th these \"concerts,\" the use of drugs among the youth rose i n proportion. The devilish bedlam of discordant heavy beat sounds numbed the minds of listeners so that they were easily persuad ed to try the new drug on the basis that \"everybody is doing it.\" Peer pressure is a very strong weapon. The \"new culture\" received maximum coverage from the jackal media, which cost the cons pirators not one single thin dime. "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 88 Great anger was felt by a number of civic leaders and churchmen over the new cult but their energies were misdirected against the RESULT of what was going on and not aga inst the CAUSE. Critics of the rock cult made the same mista kes that had been made in the prohibition era, they criticized l aw enforcement agencies, teachers, parents anybody but the conspi rators. Because of the anger and resentment I feel toward the great drug plague, I make no apology for using lang uage which is not customary for me to use. One of the worst drug slobs ever to walk the streets of America was Alan Ginsberg. This Ginsberg pushed the use of LSD through advertising which cos t him nothing, although under normal circumstances it would have c ost millions of dollars in TV advertising revenues. This free ad vertising for drugs, and LSD in particular, reached a new high in the late 1960's, thanks to the ever-willing cooperation of the media . The effect of Ginsberg's mass advertising campaign was devastatin g; the American public was subjected to one cultural futur e shock after another in rapid succession. We became over-exposed and over stimulated and, a gain, may I remind you that this is Tavistock jargon, lift ed from the Tavistock training manual, overwhelmed by its new d evelopment and, when we reached that point, our minds began to lapse into apathy; it was just too much to cope with, that is t o say, \"long range penetration had taken hold of us.\" Ginsberg c laimed to be a poet but no greater rubbish was ever written by any one who ever aspired to becoming a poet. Ginsberg's designated t ask had little to do with poetry; his main function was to push th e new subculture and force acceptance of it upon the larg e targeted population group. To assist him in his task, Ginsberg coopted the s ervices of Norman Mailer, a writer of sorts who had spent some time in a mental institution. Mailer was a favorite of the le ftwing Hollywood crowd and so had no problem with getting maximum te levision time for Ginsberg. Naturally Mailer had to have a p retext—not even he could blatantly come out with the true natu re of Ginsberg's television appearances. So a charade was adopted: Mailer would talk \"seriously\" on camera with Ginsbe rg about poetry and literature."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 89 This method of getting wide television coverage a t no cost to themselves was followed by every rock group and concert promoter who followed the example set by Ginsberg. The electronic media moguls had big hearts when it came to giving free time to these dirty verminous creatures and th eir even dirtier products and filthy ideas. Their promotion of horri ble garbage spoke volumes and, without abundant help from the p rint and electronic media, the drug trade could not have spr ead as rapidly as it did in the late 1960's-early 197O's, and prob ably would have been confined to a few small local areas. Ginsberg was able to give several nationally tele vised performances extolling the virtues of LSD and mariju ana, under the guise of \"new ideas\" and \"new cultures\" develop ing in the art and music world. Not to be outdone by the electroni c media, Ginsberg's admirers wrote glowing articles about \"t his colorful man\" in the art and social columns of all of Americ a,s largest newspapers and magazines. There had never been such an acrossthe-media-board free advertising campaign in the history of newspaper, radio and television and it cost the pro moters of the Aquarian conspiracy, NATO and the Club of Rome not one red cent. It was all absolutely free advertising for LSD, onl y thinly disguised as \"art\" and \"culture.\" One of Ginsberg's closest friends, Kenny Love, pu blished a Five-page report in the New York Times. This is in accordance with the methodology used by Tavistock and Stanford Rese arch: If something is to be promoted which the public has no t yet been fully brainwashed to accept, then have someone writ e an article, covering all sides of the subject matter. The other method is to have live television talk shows in which a panel of experts promotes the product and or idea under the pretext of \"discussing\", it. There are point and counter-point , both pro and con participants airing their support or opposition . When it is all over, the subject to be promoted has been dinned int o the public mind. While this was new in the early 1970's, today it is standard practice on which talk shows thrive. Love's Five-page pro LSD pro Ginsberg article was duly printed by the New York Times. Had Ginsberg tried t o buy the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 90 same amount of space in an advertisement, it would have cost him at least $50,000. But Ginsberg didn't have to worry ; thanks to his Friend Kenny Love, Ginsberg got the massive adverti sing all for free. With newspapers like the New York Times and t he Washington Post under the control of the Committee of 300, this kind of free advertising is given to any subject ma tter, and more especially to those promoting decadent life styles— drugs- hedonism—anything that will confuse the American pe ople. After the trial run with Ginsberg and LSD, it became stan dard Club of Rome practice to call upon major newspapers in Ameri ca to give free advertising on demand to people and ideas they were promoting. Worse yet—or better yet, depending upon the viewp oint- United Press (UP) picked up Kenny Love's free adver tising for Ginsberg and LSD and telexed it to HUNDREDS of news papers and magazines around the country under the guise of a \" news\" story. Even such highly respectable establishment magazine s as \"Harpers Bazaar\" and \"TIME\" made Mr. Ginsberg respectable. I f a nation- wide campaign of this magnitude were presented to G insberg and the promoters of LSD by an advertising agency, the price tag would have run into at least $1 million in terms of 1970 dollars. Today the price tag would be nothing less than $15- $16 million dollars. It is no wonder that I refer to the news m edia as \"jackals.\" I suggest that we try to find any media outlet to do an expose on the Federal Reserve Board, which is what I did. I took my article, which was a good expose of the greatest swindle on earth, to every major newspaper, radio and televisi on station, magazine house and several talk-show hosts. A few m ade promises that sounded good—they would definitely ai r the article and have me discuss it—give them about a week and t hey would get back to me. Not one of them ever did, nor did m y article ever appear in the pages of their newspapers and journal s. It was as if a blanket of silence had been thrown over me and th e subject I was endeavoring to promote, and indeed that was pre cisely what had happened. Without massive media hype, and without almost ar ound the clock coverage, the hippy-beatnik rock, drug cu lt would never have gotten off the ground; it would have remained a localized"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 91 oddity. The Beatles, with their twanging guitars, s illy expressions, drug language and weird clothes, would not have amo unted to a hill of beans. Instead, because the Beatles were gi ven saturation coverage by the media, the United States has suffer ed one cultural shock after another. The men buried in the think tanks and research in stitutions, whose names and faces are still not known to but a few people, made sure that the press played its part. Conversel y, the media's important role in not exposing the power behind the future cultural shocks made certain that the source of the crisis w as never identified. Thus was our society driven mad through psychological shocks and stress. \"Driven mad\" is taken from Tavis tock's training manual. From its modest beginnings in 1921, Tavisto ck was ready in 1966 to launch a major irreversible cultural revo lution in America, which has not yet ended. The Aquarian Cons piracy is part of it. Thus softened up, our nation was now deemed ripe for the introduction of drugs which was to rival the prohib ition era in scope and the huge amounts of money to be made. Thi s too was an integral part of the Aquarian Conspiracy. The pr oliferation of drug usage was one of the subjects under study at th e Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at Tavistock's Sussex U niversity facility. It was known as the \"future shocks\" cente r, a title given to so-called future oriented psychology designed to ma nipulate whole population groups to induce \"future shocks.\" It was the first of several such institutions set up by Tavistock. \"Future shocks\" is described as a series of event s which come so fast that the human brain cannot absorb the information. As I said earlier, science has shown that there are clearly marked limits to the amount of changes and the nature of t hem that the mind can deal with. After continuous shocks, the la rge targeted population group discovers that it does not want to make choices any more. Apathy takes over, often preceded by mind less violence such as is characteristic of the Los Angeles street gangs, serial killers, rapists and child kidnapers. Such a group becomes easy to control and will doc ilely follow orders without rebelling, which is the object of the exercise."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 92 \"Future shocks,\" says SPRU, \"is defined as physical and psychological distress arising from the excess load on the decision- making mechanism of the human mind.\" That is Tavist ock jargon lifted straight from Tavistock manuals—which they d on't know I have. Just as an overloaded electrical circuit will act ivate a trip switch, so do humans \"trip out,\" which is a syndrom e that medical science is only now beginning to understand, althou gh John Rawlings Reese conducted experiments in this field as far back as the 1920's. As can be appreciated, such a targeted group is ready to \"trip out\" and take to drugs as a means of escap e from the pressures of so many choices having to be made. Thi s is how Drug usage was spread so rapidly through America's \"beat generation.\" What started with the Beatles and sample packages o f LSD has grown into a flood-tide of drug usage which is swam ping America. The drug trade is controlled by the Committee of 300 from the Top down. The drug trade started with the Briti sh East India Company and was closely followed by the Dutch East India Company. Both were controlled by a \"Council of 300. \" The list of names of members and stockholders of the BEIC read like something out of Debretts Peerage. BEIC established the \"China Inland Mission,\" whose job it was to get The Chinese peasants, or coolies, as they were called, addicted to opium. Th is created the market for opium which the BEIC then filled. In much the same way the Committee of 300 used \"T he \"Beatles\" to popularize \"social drugs\" with the you th of America and The Hollywood \"in-crowd.\" Ed Sullivan was sent to England To become acquainted with The first Tavistock Institut e \"rock group\" to hit the shores of the United States. Sullivan th en returned to the United States to draft the strategy for the electro nic media on how to package and sell the group. Without the full coo peration of the electronic media and Ed Sullivan, in particular, \"T he Beatles\" and their \"music\" would have died on the vine. Instead, our national life and the character of the United States was for ever changed. Now that we know, it is all too clear how success ful the \"Beatles\" campaign to proliferate the use of drugs became. The fact that \"The Beatles\" had their music and lyrics written for them"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 93 by Theo Adorno was concealed from public view. The prime function to \"The Beatles\" was to be discovered by t eenagers, who where then subjected to a non-stop barrage of \"Beat le music,\" until they became convinced that they liked the sou nd and adopted it, along with all that accompanied it. The Liverpool group performed up to expectations, and with \"a little he lp from their friends,\" i.e., illegal substances we call drugs cr eated a whole new class to young Americans in the precise mold ordain ed by the Tavistock Institute. Tavistock had created a highly visible \"new type\" to act as their drug-runners. The China Inland Mission \"Chris tian missionaries\" would not have fitted in with the 196 0's. \"New type\" is social-science scientist jargon; what it meant wa s that the Beatles created new social patterns, first and fore most being to normalize and popularize the use of drugs, new tast es in clothes and hair styles which really distinguished them fro m the older generation as was intended by Tavistock. It is important to note the deliberate fragmentat ion- inducing language used by Tavistock. The \"teenagers \" never once dreamed that all the \"different\" things they aspire d to were the product of older scientists working in think tanks in England and Stanford Research. How mortified they would have be en if they had discovered that most of their \"cool\" habits and expressions were deliberately created for their use by a group of older social science scientists! The role of the media was, and remains, very impo rtant in promoting the use of drugs on a nation-wide scale. When coverage of the street warfare gangs was abruptly t erminated by the media, they became \"burned out\" as a social phe nomena; the \"new age\" of drugs followed. The media has always s erved as a catalyst and has always pushed \"new causes\" and now media attention was focused on drug usage and its support ers, the \"beat generation,\" yet another phrase fashioned at Tavist ock, in its determined efforts to bring about social changes in The United States. Drug usage now became an accepted part of everyda y life in America. This Tavistock-designed program took in millions of"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 94 American youth, and the older generation began to b elieve that America was undergoing a natural social revolution, failing all the while to realize that what was happening to their c hildren was not a spontaneous movement, but a highly artificial cre ation designed to force changes in America's social and political life. The descendants of the British East India Company were delighted with the success of their drug pushing pr ogram. Their disciples became adept in the use of lysergic acid (LSD) so conveniently made available by patrons of the drug trade like Aldous Huxley, courtesy of the highly respected San doz company of Switzerland and financed by the great Warburg ba nking dynasty. The new \"wonder drug\" was promptly distributed at a ll rock concerts and on college campuses in free sample pac kages. The question that begs to be asked is, \"What was the FB I doing while all this was going on?\" The purpose of the Beatles had become abundantly clear. The British East India Company's descendants in the upperclass society in London must have felt very good about th e billions of dollars that began rolling in. With the coming of \" rock\" which shall henceforth be used as shorthand to describe Adorno' s fiendish satanic music, a tremendous increase in the use of social drugs, especially marijuana, was observed. The entire dope business was expanded under the control and direction of the Sci ence Policy Research Unit (SPRU). SPRU was run by Leland Bradford, Kenneth Damm and Ronald Lippert, under whose expert guidance a large number of new-science scientists were trained to promote \"fut ure shocks,\" one of the chief being the dramatic increase in the use of drugs by America's teenagers. SPRU's policy papers, planted in various government agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), dictated the course of the disastrous \"drug war\" allegedly waged by the Reagan and Bush Administrations. This was the forerunner of how the United States is run today, by one committee and/or council after anothe r, by an inner- government fed on Tavistock papers which they firml y believe are their own opinions.

The environment of our life style has become polluted; our thinking has become polluted. Our abi lity to control our destiny has become polluted. We are confronted by changes that pollute our thinking to the extent that we do not know what to make of it all. The \"Environment of Change\" is c rippling the nation; we appear to have so little control that it has produced anxiety and confusion. We now look to group solutions instead of individ ual solutions to our problems. We do not make use of ou r own resources to solve problems. In this the prolific r ise in drug usage is playing a leading role. The strategy is a delibe rate one, devised by the new-science scientists, the social engineers and tinkerers, aimed at the most vulnerable of all areas, our self -image, or how we perceive ourselves, which leads us eventually to become like sheep being led to the slaughter. We have become co nfused by the many choices we have to make, and we have becom e apathetic. We are manipulated by unscrupulous men without eve r being aware of it.

The signal for the exe cution of Princess Grace was picked up by the British Army li stening post in Cyprus and it is believed by well placed source tha t the Committee Monte Carlo and P2 gave the order. The drug trade, controlled by the Committee of 30 0, is a crime against humanity, but having been conditioned and softened up by years of incessant bombardment by Tavistock I nstitute, we have more or less accepted our changed environment, regarding the drug trade as a problem that is \"too big\" to ha ndle. This is not the case. If we could marshal an entire nation, equ ip and send millions of American soldiers to fight in a war in Europe in which he had no business intervening, if we could defeat a major power, then we can smash the drug trade, using the same WW II tactics. The logistical problems that had to be solved whe n we entered the Second World War are even today still m ind-boggling. Yet we successfully overcame all problems. Why then is it impossible to defeat a well-defined enemy, far smal ler and weaker than Germany, given the immensely improved weapons and surveillance equipment we have today? The real reas on that the drug problem is not eradicated is because it is bei ng run by the highest families in the entire world as part of a c oordinated gigantic money-making machine. In 1930, British capital invested in South Americ a greatly exceeded capital investment in British \"dominions.\" Graham, an authority on British investments abroad, stated tha t British investment in South America \"exceeded one trillion pounds.\" Remember, this was 1930, and one trillion pounds wa s a"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 98 staggering sum of money in those days. What was the reason for such heavy investment in South America? In a word i t was drugs. The plutocracy controlling British banks held the purse strings and then, as now, put up a most respectable facade to cover their true business. No one ever caught them with dirtied hands. They always had front men, even as they do t oday, willing to take the blame if things went awry. Then as now the connections with the drug trade were tenuous at bes t. No one was ever able to lay a finger on the respectable and \"n oble\" banking families of Britain, whose members are on the Commi ttee of 300. There is great significance in that only 15 membe rs of Parliament were the controllers of that vast empire , of which the most prominent were Sir Charles Barry and the Chamb erlain family. These overlords of finance were busy in places like Argentina, Jamaica and Trinidad, which became big moneyspinner s for them through the drug trade. In these countries, British plutocrats kept \"the locals\" as they were contemptuously called, at bare subsistence levels, hardly above slavery. The fortu nes extracted from the drug trade in the Caribbean were vast. The plutocrats hid behind faces like Trinidad Lea seholds Limited, but the REAL MEAT, then as now, was drugs. This is true of today where we find that Jamaica's Gross Nationa l Product (GNP) is made up almost entirely of sales of ganja, a very potent form of marijuana. The mechanism for handling the ga nja trade was set up by David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger under the title \"Caribbean Basin Initiative.\" Up until a relatively short time ago, the true hi story of the China opium trade was quite unknown, having been as well covered up as it is possible to do. Many of my form er students in the days when I was lecturing, would come and ask m e why the Chinese were so fond of smoking opium? They were pu zzled as are many still today, over contradictory accounts o f what had actually taken place in China. Most thought it was merely a case of the Chinese workers buying opium on an open market and smoking it, or going to some of the thousands of op ium dens and forgetting their terrible existence for a while. "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" 99 The truth is that the supply of opium to China wa s a British monopoly, an OFFICIAL monopoly of the British gover nment and official British policy. The Indo-British opium tra de in China was one of the best kept secrets, around which many mis leading legends grew up, such as \"Clive of India\" and the t ales of derring- do by the British Army in India for the glory of \"t he Empire,\" so well written by Rudyard Kipling, and tales of \"Tea Clippers\" racing across the oceans with their cargoes of China tea f or the high society drawing rooms of Victorian England. In real ity, the history of British occupation of India and Britain's Opium Wars are some of the most dastardly blots on Western civilization . Almost 13% of the income of India under British r ule was derived from the sale of good quality Bengal opium to the British- run opium distributors in China. \"The Beatles\" of t he day, the China Inland Mission, had done a great job in prolif erating the use of opium among the poor Chinese laborers (coolies, as they were called). These addicts did not suddenly materialize out of thin air, any more than did teenager addicts in the U.S. THE POINT TO REMEMBER IS THAT BOTH WERE CREATED. In China a mark et for opium was first created and then filled by opium fo r Bengal. In the same way, a market for marijuana and LSD was first c reated in the United States by methods already described, and the n filled by British plutocrats and their American cousins with the help of the overlords of the British banking establishment. The lucrative drug trade is one of the worst exam ples of making money out of human misery; the other being t he legal drug trade run by the pharmaceutical drug houses un der Rockefeller ownership, in the U.S. for the most par t, but with substantial companies operating in Switzerland, Fra nce and Britain and fully backed by the American Medical Associatio n (AMA). The dirty dope transactions and the money it generates flows through the City of London, together with Hong Kong, Dubai and latterly, Lebanon, thanks to the invasion of that country by Israel. There will be those who doubt this statement. \"Lo ok at this business columns of the Financial Times,\" they will tell us. \"Don't tell me that this is all related to drug money\"? OF COURSE IT IS, but don't imagine for one minute that the noble lor ds and ladies of"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 100 England are going to advertise the fact. Remember t he British East India Company? Officially, its business was trading in tea! The London \"Times\" never dared tell the British p ublic the it was impossible to make VAST PROFITS from tea, no r did the illustrious paper even hint at a trade in opium bei ng plied by those who spent their time in London's fashionable clubs or playing a chukka of polo at the Royal Windsor Club, or that t he gentlemen officers who went out to India in the service of th e Empire were financed SOLELY by the enormous income derived from the misery of the millions of Chinese coolies addicted to opiu m. The trade was conducted by the illustrious Britis h East India Company, whose meddling in political, religio us and economic affairs of the United States has cost us v ery dearly for over 200 years. The 300 members of the British East India Company's board were a cut above the common herd. T hey were so mighty, as Lord Bertrand Russell once observed, \"They could even give God advice when he had trouble in Heaven. \" Nor should we imagine that anything has changed in the interve ning years. EXACTLY the same attitude prevails today among memb ers of the Committee of 300, which is why they often refer to themselves as the \"Olympians.\" Later the British Crown, i.e., the Royal Family, joined the British East India Company's trade, and used it as a vehicle to produce opium in Bengal, and elsewhere in India, co ntrolling exports through what was called \"transit duties,\" t hat is, the Crown levied a tax on all producers of opium duly r egistered with the state authority, who were sending their opium t o China. Prior to 1896, when the trade was still \"illegal\" —a word used to extract greater tribute from the producers of opium-there never having been the slightest attempt to stop the trade, colossal amounts of opium were shipped out of India on board \"China Tea Clippers,\" those sailing ships around which legend and lore were built, which supposedly carried chests of tea from India and China to the London exchanges. So audacious did the British East India Company l ords and ladies become that they tried to sell this lethal s ubstance to the"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 101 Union and Confederate Armies in pill form as a pain killer. Is it difficult to imagine just what would have happened h ad their plan succeeded? All those hundreds of thousands of soldi ers would have left the battlefields totally hooked on opium. \"The Beatles\" were much more successful in turning out millions o f teenage addicts in later years. The Bengal merchants and their British controller s and bankers grew fat and intolerant on the enormous amo unts of money that poured into the coffers of the British E ast India Company from the wretched Chinese coolies opium tra de. BEIC profits, even in those years, far exceeded the comb ined profits made in a single year by General Motors, Ford and C hrysler in their heydays. The trend in making huge profits out of drugs was carried over into the 1960's by such \"legal\" drug d eath merchants as Sandoz, the makers of LSD and Hoffman la Roche, manufacturers of Valium. The cost of the raw materi al and manufacturing of Valium to Hoffman la Roche is $3 p er kilo (2.2 pounds). It is sold to their distributors for $20,0 00 per kilo. By the time it reaches the consumer, the price of Valium h as risen to $50,000 per kilo. Valium is used in huge quantities in Europe and the United States. It is possibly the most used dru g of its kind in the world. Hoffman la Roche does the same thing with Vitamin C, which costs them less than 1 cent a kilo to produce . It is sold for a profit of 10,000 percent. When a friend of mine ble w the whistle on this criminal company, which had entered into a monopoly agreement with other producers, in contravention of European Economic Community laws, he was arrested on the Swi ss-Italian border and hustled into prison; his wife was threat ened by the Swiss police until she committed suicide. As a Brit ish national he was rescued by the British consul in Berne as soon as word of his plight was received, removed from prison and flown out of the country. He lost his wife, his job and his pension b ecause he dared to disclose Hoffman La Roche secrets. The Swiss tak e their Industrial Espionage law very seriously.

Now mind you, one could get into serious trouble with the Swiss authorities for giving out any information on these nefarious activities. The Swiss regard it as \"industrial espi onage\" which usually carries a 5-year term in prison. It is safe r to pretend that Switzerland is a nice clean country rather than loo k under the covers or inside its garbage can banks. In 1931 the managing directors of the so-called \" big Five\" British companies were rewarded by being made Peers of the Realm for their activities in drug money laundering . Who decided such matters and bestows such honors? It is the Que en of England who bestows honors upon the men in the top position s in the drug trade. British banks engaged in this terrible trade are too numerous to mention, but a few of the top ones are: The British Bank of the Middle East. Midland Bank. National and Westminster Bank. Barclays Bank. Royal Bank of Canada. Hong Kon g and Shanghai Bank. Baring Brothers Bank. Many of the merchant banks are up to their hocks in pigswill drug trade profits, banks such as Hambros for example, run by Sir Jocelyn Hambro. For a really interesting major study of the Chinese opium trade, one would need access to I ndia Office in London. I was able to get in there because of my in telligence service and received great assistance from the trus tee of the papers of the late Professor Frederick Wells Willia mson, which provided much information on the opium trade carrie d on by the British East India Company in India and China in th e 18th and 19th centuries. If only those papers could be made publi c, what a storm would burst over the heads of the crowned vipers of Europe. Today the trade has shifted somewhat in that less expensive cocaine has taken over a good part of the North American market. In the 1960's the flood of heroin coming from Hong Kong, Lebanon and Dubai threatened to engulf t he United States and Western Europe. When demand outpaced sup ply there"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 103 was a switch to cocaine. But now, at the end of 199 1, that trend has been reversed; today it is heroin that is back in favor, although it is true that cocaine still enjoys great favor among the poorer classes. Heroin, we are told, is more satisfying to addict s; the effects are far more intense and last longer than t he effects of cocaine and there is less international attention o n heroin producers than there is on Colombian cocaine shippe rs. Besides which, it is hardly likely that the U.S. would make any real effort to stop the production of opium in the Golden Triangle which is under the control of the Chinese military, a serious war would erupt if any country tried to interdict the trade. A serious attack on the opium trade would bring Chinese military interventi on. The British know this; they have no quarrel with China, except for an occasional squabble over who gets the larger share of the pie. Britain has been involved in the China opium trade for over two centuries. No one is going to be so foolis h as to rock the boat when millions upon millions of dollars flow in to the bank accounts of the British oligarchists and more gold is traded on the Hong Kong gold market than the combined total trade d in London and New York. Those individuals who fondly imagine they can do some kind of a deal with a minor Chinese or Burmese over lord in the hills of the Golden Triangle apparently have no ide a of what is involved. If they had known, they would never have talked about stopping the opium trade. Such talk reveals little knowledge of the immensity and complexity of China's opium trade, British plutocrats, the Russian KGB, the CIA, and U.S. bankers are all in league with China. Could one man stop or even make a small dent in the trade? It would be absurd to imagine it. What is heroin and why is it favored over cocaine t hese days? According to the noted authority on the subject Prof essor Galen, heroin is a derivative of opium, a drug that stupef ies the senses and induces long periods of sleep. This is what mos t addicts like, it is called \"being in the arms of Morpheus.\" Opium is the most habit-forming drug known to man.

The poppy seed from which it is derived was long known to the Moguls of India, who used the seeds mixed in te a offered to a difficult opponent. It is also used as a pain-killi ng drug which largely replaced chloroform and other older anesthe tics of a bygone era. Opium was popular in all of the fashion able clubs of Victorian London and it was no secret that men like the Huxley brothers used it extensively. Members of the Orphic -Dionysus cults of Hellenic Greece and the Osiris-Horus cults of Pt olemaic Egypt which Victorian society embraced, all smoked opium; it was the \"in\" thing to do. So did some of those who met at St. Ermins Hotel in 1903 to decide what sort of a world we would have. The d escendants of the St. Ermins crowd are found today in the Committ ee of 300. It is these so-called world leaders who brought about such a change in our environment that enabled drug usage to proli ferate to the point where it can no longer be stopped by regular law enforcement tactics and policies. This is especiall y true in big cities where big populations can conceal a great deal of w hat transpires. Many in the circles of royalty were regular opium users. One of their favorites was the writer Coudenhove-Ka lergi who wrote a book in 1932 entitled \"REVOLUTION THROUGH TECHNOLOGY which was a blueprint for the return of the world to a medieval society. The book, in fact, became a wor king paper for the Committee of 300's plan to deindustrialize the world, starting with the United States. Claiming that pressures of over-population are a serious problem, Kalergi advised a return to what he called \"open spaces.\" Does this sound like the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot? Here are some extracts from the book: \"In its facilities, the city of the future will resemble the city of the Middle Ages...and he who is not condemn ed to live in a city because of his occupation, will go to the coun tryside.

The first opium shipments reached England from Be ngal in 1683, carried in British East India Company \"Tea Cl ippers.\" Opium was brought to England as a test, an experiment, to see whether the common folk of England, the yeomen and the lowe r classes, could be induced into taking the drug. It was what we could call today \"test marketing\" of a new product. But the st urdy yeomen and the much derided \"lower classes\" were made of s tern stuff, and the test marketing experiment was a total flop. The \"lower classes\" of British society firmly rejected opium sm oking. The plutocrats and oligarchists in high society i n London began casting about for a market that would not be so resistant, so unbending. They found such a market in China. In the papers I studied at the India Office under the heading \"Misc ellaneous Old Records,\" I found all the confirmation I could have wished for in proving that the opium trade in China really took o ff following the founding of the British East India Companyfunded \"C hina Inland Mission,\" ostensibly a Christian missionary society but in reality the \"promotion\" men and women for the new product being introduced into the market, that new product being OPIUM. This was later confirmed when I was given access to the papers of Sir George Birdwood in India Office recor ds. Soon after the China Inland Mission missionaries set out to gi ve away their sample packages and show the coolies how to smoke o pium, vast quantities of opium began to arrive in China. \"The Beatles\" could not have done a better job. (In both cases the trad e was sanctioned by the British royal family, who openly supported the Beatles.) Where the British East India Company had failed in England, it now succeeded beyond its wildest expect ations in China, whose teeming millions of poor looked upon s moking opium as an escape from their life of misery. Opium dens began proliferating all across China, and in the big cities like Shanghai and Canton, hundreds of th ousands of miserable Chinese found that a pipe of opium seemin gly made life bearable. The British East India Company had a clea r run for over a 100 years before the Chinese government woke up t o what was"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 106 happening. It was only in 1729 that the first laws against opium smoking were passed. The 300 board members of BEIC did not like it one bit and, never one to back down, the co mpany was soon engaged in a running battle with the Chinese g overnment. The BEIC had developed poppy seeds that brought t he finest quality opium from the poppy fields of Benar es and Bihar in the Ganges Basin in India, a country they fully con trolled this fetched top price, while the lower grades of opium from other areas of India were sold for less. Not about to los e their lucrative market, the British Crown engaged in running battle s with Chinese forces, and defeated them. In the same manner, the U.S. government is supposedly fighting a running battle against today's drug barons and, like the Chinese, are losing heavi ly. There is however one big difference: The Chinese government fought to win whereas the United States government is under n o compunction to win the battle which explains why st aff turnover n the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) is so high. Latterly, high grade quality opium has come out o f Pakistan via Makra on the desolate coastline of the country from whence ships take the cargo to Dubai where it is exchanged for gold. This is said to account in part for heroin being favored over cocaine today. The heroin trade is more discreet, there is no murder of prominent officials such as became an almost daily occurrence in Colombia. Pakistani opium does not sell for as much as Golden Triangle or Golden Crescent (Iranian ) opium. This has greatly spurred heroin production and sales which threaten to overtake cocaine as the number one seller. The vile opium trade was talked about in the uppe r-crust circles of English society for many years as \"the s poils of the Empire.\" The tall tales of valor in the Khyber Pass covered a vast trade in opium. The British Army was stationed in t he Khyber Pass to protect caravans carrying raw opium from being p illaged by hill tribesmen. Did the British royal family know this? They must have, what else would induce the Crown to keep an army in this region where there was nothing of much worth other than th e lucrative opium trade? It was very expensive to keep men unde r arms in a far away country. Her Majesty must have asked why t hese military"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 107 units were there? Certainly not to play polo or bil liards in the officers' mess. The BEIC was jealous of its monopoly in opium. Wo uld-be competitors received short shrift. In a noted trial in 1791, a certain Warren Hastings was put on charges that he helped a Friend to get into the opium trade at the expense of the BEIC . The actual wording which I found in the records of the case ho used in India Office gives some insight into the vast opium trade : \"The charge is that Hastings has granted a contract for the Provis ion of Opium for four years to Stephen Sullivan, without advertising for the same, on terms glaringly obvious and wantonly profuse, fo r the purpose of creating an INSTANT FORTUNE for the said William Sullivan Esq.\" (Emphasis added.) As the BEIC-British government held the monopoly in opium trading, the only people allowed to make inst ant fortunes were the \"nobility,\" the \"aristocracy,\" the plutocr ats and oligarchical families of England, many of whose des cendants sit on the Committee of 300 just as their forbears sat on t he Council of 300 who ran the BEIC. Outsiders like Mr. Sullivan s oon found themselves in trouble with the Crown if they were s o bold as to try and help themselves get into the multi-billion poun d Sterling opium business. The honorable men of the BEIC with its list of 30 0 counselors were members of all the famous gentlemen 's clubs in London and they were for the most part members of p arliament, while others, both in India and at home, were magis trates. Company passports were required to land in China. W hen a few busybodies arrived in China to investigate the Brit ish Crown's involvement in the lucrative trade, BEIC magistrate s promptly revoked their passports, thus effectively denying t hem entry into China. Friction with the Chinese government was common. The Chinese had passed a law, the Yung Cheny Edict of 1 729, forbidding the importation of opium, yet the BEIC m anaged to keep opium as an entry in the Chinese Customs Tarif f books until 1753, the duty being three taels per chest of opium . Even when British special secret service (the 007 of the day) saw to it that"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 108 troublesome Chinese officials were bought off, and in cases where that was not possible, they were simply murdered. Every British monarch since 1729 has benefited im mensely from the drug trade and this holds good for the pre sent occupant of the throne. Their ministers saw to it that wealt h flowed into their family coffers. One such minister of Victoria 's was Lord Palmerston. He clung obstinately to the belief that nothing should be allowed to stop Britain's opium trade with China . Palmerston's plan was to supply the Chinese government with enou gh opium to make individual members become greedy. Then the Bri tish would withhold supplies and when the Chinese government w as on its knees, supplies would be resumed—but at a much high er price, thus retaining a monopoly through the Chinese gover nment itself, but the plan failed. The Chinese government responded by destroying la rge cargoes of opium stored in warehouses, and British merchants were required to sign INDIVIDUAL agreements not to import any more opium into Canton. BEIC responded by sending s cores of fully-loaded opium carrying ships to lie in the roa ds of Macao. Companies beholden to BEIC, rather than individuals , then sold these cargoes. Chinese Commissioner Lin said, \"Ther e is so much opium on board English vessels now lying in the roa ds of this place (Macao) which will never be returned to the country from which it came, and I shall not be surprised to hear of its b eing smuggled in under American colors.\" Lin's prophecy proved to be remarkably accurate. The Opium Wars against China were designed to \"pu t the Chinese in their place\" as Lord Palmerston once sai d, and the British Army did that. There was simply no stopping the vast, lucrative trade which provided the British oligarch ical feudal lords with untold billions, while leaving China with mill ions of opium addicts. In later years the Chinese appealed to Bri tain for help with their immense problem and received it. Thereafter r espective Chinese governments realized the value in cooperati ng instead of fighting with Britain—and this held good during the bloody rule of Mao Tse Tung—so that today, as I have already menti oned, any quarrels that come about are only over the share of the opium trade each is entitled to."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 109 To advance to more modern history, the Chinese-Br itish partnership was solidified by the Hong Kong agreeme nt which established an equal partnership in the opium trade . This has proceeded smoothly, with an occasional ripple here and there, but while violence and death, robbery and murder marked the progression of the Colombian cocaine trade, no such baseness was allowed to disturb the heroin trade, which, as I sa id earlier, is once again coming into the ascendancy as we near the end of 1991. The major problem that arose in Sino-British rela tions during the past 60 years concerned China's demand f or a larger slice of the opium-heroin pie. This was settled whe n Britain agreed to hand Hong Kong over to full Chinese government c ontrol which will come into effect in 1997. Other than that, the partners retain their former equal shares of the lucrative opium tr ade based in Hong Kong. The British oligarchical families of the Committe e of 300 who were entrenched in Canton at the height of the opium trade left their descendants in position. Look at a list of prominent British residents in China and you will see the nam es of members of the Committee of 300 among them. The same holds good for Hong Kong. These plutocrats of a feudal era, that t hey seek to return to the world, control the gold and opium tra de of which Hong Kong is THE center. Burmese and Chinese opium poppy growers get paid in gold; they do not trust the U.S . paper $100 bill. This explains the very large volume of gold trade i n the Hong Kong exchange. The Golden Triangle is no longer the largest prod ucer of opium. That dubious title has since 1987 been share d by the Golden Crescent (Iran), Pakistan and Lebanon. These are the principle opium producers, although smaller quantit ies are once again coming out of Afghanistan and Turkey. The dru g trade, and more: especially the opium trade, could not functio n without the help of banks as we shall demonstrate as we proceed . How do banks with their great air of respectabili ty fit into the drug trade with all of its attendant filth? It is a very long and complicated story, which could be the subject of a b ook on its own."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 110 One way in which banks participate is by financing front companies importing the chemicals needed to process raw opium into heroin. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank with a branch office in London is right in the middle of such tra de through a company called TEJAPAIBUL, which banks with Hong Ko ng and Shanghai Bank. What does this company do? It import s into Hong Kong most of the chemicals needed in the heroin ref ining process. It is also a major supplier of acetic anhydride F or the Golden Crescent and the Golden Triangle, Pakistan, Turkey and Lebanon. The actual financing for this trading is h ived off to the Bangkok Metropolitan Bank. Thus, the secondary acti vities connected with processing opium, while not in the s ame category us the opium trade, nevertheless generates substant ial income for banks. But the real income of the Hong Kong and Sha nghai Bank and indeed all banks in the region is financing the actual opium trade. It took a lot of research on my part to link the price of gold to the price of opium. I used to tell anyone who wo uld listen, \"If you want to know the price of gold find out what th e price of a pound or a kilo of opium is in Hong Kong.\" To my cr itics I answered, \"Take a look at what happened in 1977, a critical year for gold.\" The Bank of China shocked the gold pundi ts, and those clever forecasters who are to be found in great num bers in America, by suddenly and without warning, dumping 8 0 tons of gold on the market. That depressed the price of gold in a big hurry. All the experts could say was, \"We never knew China had tha t much gold where could it have come from?\" It came from the go ld which is paid to China in the Hong Kong Gold Market for larg e purchases of opium. The current policy of the Chinese government toward England is the same as it was in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Chinese economy, tied to the economy of Hong Kong—a nd I don't mean television sets, textiles, radios, watches, pi rated cassette and video tapes—I mean opium/heroin—would take a te rrible beating if it were not for the opium trade it share s with Britain. The BEIC is gone but the descendants of the Council of 300 linger on in the membership of the Committee of 300. "},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 111 The oldest of the oligarchical British families w ho were leaders in the opium trade for the past 200 years a re still in it today. Take the Mathesons, for instance. This \"nobl e\" family is one of the pillars of the opium trade. When things look ed a bit shaky a few years ago, the Mathesons stepped in and gave Ch ina a loan of $300 million for real estate investment.

The problem with the drug trade is that it has be come a threat to national sovereignty. Here is what the Ve nezuelan Ambassador to the United Nations said about this wo rld-wide threat: \"The problem of drugs bas already ceased to be de alt with simply as one of public health or a social problem. It has turned into something far more serious and far-reaching wh ich affects our national sovereignty; a problem of national securit y, because it strikes at the independence of a nation. Drugs in a ll their manifestations of production, commercialization and consumption, denaturalizes us by injuring our ethical, religious and political life, our historic, economic, and republican values.\" This is precisely the way the Bank of Internation al Settlements and the IMF are operating. Let me say w ithout hesitation that both these banks are nothing more t han bully-boy clearing houses for the drug trade. The BIS undermi nes any country that the IMF wants to sink by setting up wa ys and means for the easy outflow of flight capital. Nor does BI S recognize nor make any distinction when it comes down to what is flight capital and what is laundered drug money. The BIS operates on gangster lines. If a country will not submit to asset-stripping by the IMF, then it says in effect, \"Right, then we will break you by means of the huge cache o f narco- dollars we are holding.\" It is easy to understand w hy gold was demonetized and substituted with the paper \"dollar\" as the world's"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 112 reserve currency.

He informed me that the IMF agents told the meeting that they could literal ly cause a run on any country's currency, using narco-dollars, whi ch would precipitate a flight of capital.

W hile Rainer-Gut did not spell it out, everybody at the seminar knew exactly what he was talking about. From Colombia to Miami, from the Golden Triangle to the Golden Gate, from Hong Kong to New York, from Bogot a to Frankfurt, the drug trade, and more especially the heroin trade, is BIG BUSINESS and it is run from the top down by som e of the most \"untouchable\" families in the world, and each of those families have at least one member who is on the Com mittee of 300. It is not a street corner business, and it tak es a great deal of money and expertise to keep it flowing smoothly. Th e machinery under control of the Committee of 300 ensures this. Such talents are not found on the street corners and subways of New York. To be sure the pushers and ped dlers are an integral part of the trade, but only as very small part-time salesmen. I say part-time because they are caught a nd rivalry gets some of them shot. But what does that matter? There are plenty of replacements available. No, it is not anything the Small Business Adminis tration would be interested in. IT IS BIG BUSINESS, a vast empire, this dirty drug business. Of necessity, it is operated f rom the top down in every single country in the world. It is, in fac t, the largest single enterprise in the world today, transcending all oth ers.

The main countries involved in growing poppies an d the cocoa bush are Burma, Northern China, Afghanistan, Iran, PaKistan, Thailand, Lebanon, Turkey, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia. Colombia does not grow the cocoa bush but, next to Bolivia, is the main refiner of cocaine and the chief financial cen ter of the cocaine trade which, since General Noriega was kidn aped and imprisoned by President Bush, is being challenged b y Panama for first place in money laundering and capital financi ng of the cocaine trade. The heroin trade is financed by Hong Kong banks, L ondon banks and some Middle East banks such as the Britis h Bank of the Middle East. Lebanon is fast becoming the \"Switzerl and of the Middle East.\" Countries involved in the distributio n and routing of heroin are Hong Kong, Turkey, Bulgaria, Italy, Mona co, France (Corsica and Marseilles) Lebanon and Pakistan. The United States is the largest consumer of narcotics, first place g oing to cocaine, which is being challenged by heroin. Western Europe and Southwest Asian countries are the biggest users of heroin. Iran has a huge heroin addict population—in excess of 2 million as of 1991. There is not a single government that does not kn ow precisely what is going on with regard to the drug trade, but individual members holding powerful positions are t aken, but of by the Committee of 300 through its world-wide network of subsidiaries. If any government member is \"difficul t,\" he or she is removed, as in the case of Pakistan's Ali Bhutto an d Italy's Aldo Moro. No one is beyond the reach of this all-powerf ul Committee, even though Malaysia has been successful in holding out up until now. Malaysia has the strictest anti-drug laws in t he world. Possession of even small amounts is punishable by t he death penalty. Like the Kintex Company of Bulgaria, most smaller countries have a direct hand in these criminal ente rprises. Kintex trucks regularly ferried heroin through Western Eur ope in its own fleet of trucks bearing the EEC marker Triangle Int ernationale"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 114 Routier (TIR). Trucks bearing this marker and the E EC recognition number are not supposed to be stopped at customs bo arder posts. TlR trucks are allowed to carry only perishable ite ms.

Under international treaty obligations this is wh at happens, thus Kintex trucks were able load their cargoes of heroin and certify it as \"fresh fruit and vegetables;\" and the n make their way through Western Europe, even entering high-security NATO bases in Northern Italy. In this manner, Bulgaria became one of the principal countries through which heroin was routed . The only way to stop the huge amounts of heroin a nd cocaine presently finding their way to markets in E urope is to end the TIR system. That will never happen. The interna tional treaty obligations I have just mentioned were set up by th e Committee of 300, using its amazing networks and control mechani sms, to facilitate passage of all manner of drugs to Wester n Europe. Forget perishable goods! A former DEA agent station ed in Italy told me, \"TIR=DOPE.\" Remember this the next time you read in the newsp apers that a big haul of heroin was found in a false-bott om suitcase at Kennedy Airport, and some unlucky \"mule\" pays the p rice for his criminal activity. This kind of action is only \"sma ll potatoes,\" sand in the eyes of the public, to make us think our gov ernment is really doing something about the drug menace. Take for example, \"The French Connection,\" a Nixon program embarked u pon without the knowledge and consent of the committee of 300. The entire amount of opium/heroin seized in that massive effort is somewhat less than one quarter of what a single TIR truck carries. The Committee of 300 saw to it that Nixon paid a heavy price for a relatively small seizure of heroi n. It was not the amount of heroin involved, but a matter of one whom they had helped up the ladder to the White House believing t hat he could now do without their help and backing, and even go against direct orders from above.

At harvest time, the seed-bearing pod is cut with a razor or s harp knife. A resinous substance leaks through the cut and starts to congeal. This is raw opium. The crop of raw opium is made up into sticky roundish balls. The tribesman are paid in 1 kilo go ld bars-known as 4/10ths—which are minted by Credit Suisse. These sm all bars are used ONLY to pay the tribesman—the normalweight gol d bars are traded on the Hong Kong market by the big buyers of raw opium or partly processed heroin. The same methods are us ed to pay hill tribesman in India—the Baluchis-who have been in th is business since the days of the Moguls. The \"Dope Season,\" as it is called, sees a flood of gold traded on the Hong Kong market . Mexico has started producing relatively small amo unts of heroin called \"Mexican Brown\" which is much in dema nd by the Hollywood crowd. Here again the heroin trade is run by top government officials who have the military on their side. Some producers of \"Mexican Brown\" are making a million d ollars a month by supplying their U.S. clients. On occasions when a few Mexican Federal police are prodded into taking acti on against the heroin producers, they are \"taken out\" by military units who seem to appear as if from nowhere. Such an incident occurred in November 1991 at an isolated airstrip in Mexico's opium producing region. Federa l narcotics agents surrounded the strip and were about to arres t people who were in the act of loading heroin when a squad of s oldiers arrived. The soldiers rounded up the Federal narcotics polic e agents and systematically killed all of them. This action pose d serious threat to Mexican President Goltarin, who is faced with loud demands for a full-scale investigation into the murders. Goltarin is over a barrel; he can't back off from calling for an inquiry, and neither can he afford to offend the military.

Whe n the Shah of Iran was in control of the country, he refused t o allow the heroin trade to continue and it was forcibly discon tinuedup until the time that he was \"dealt with\" by the Committee of 300.

The drug business is not a Mafia ope ration, nor one run by the Colombian cocaine cartels. The noble fam ilies of Britain and America's top people are not going to advertise their role in the shop windows; they always have a layer of front men to do the dirty work. Remember British and AMERICAN \"nobility\" never di rtied their hands in the China opium trade. The lords and ladies were much too clever for that, as were the American elit e: the Delanos, Forbes, Appletons, Bacons, Boylestons, Perkins, Rus sells, Cunninghams, Shaws, Coolidges, Parkmans, Runnewells , Cabots and Codmans, by no means a complete list of familie s in America who grew immensely wealthy from the China opium tra de. Since this is not a book about the drug trade, I cannot of necessity, cover the subject in an in-depth manner. But its importance to the Committee of 300 must be emphasiz ed. America is run not by 60 families but by 300 families and E ngland is run by 100 families and, as we shall see, these families a re intertwined through marriage, companies, banks, not to mention ties to the Black Nobility, Freemasonry, the Order of St. John of Jerusalem and so on.

Shipments of cocaine are sometimes interdicted an d seized That is mere window dressing. Often times the shipm ents seized belong to a new organization trying to break into t he trade. Such competition is put out of business by informing the authorities exactly where it is going to enter the U.S. and who the owners are. The big stuff is never touched; heroin is too expen sive. It is worthy of note that U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency op eratives are not allowed into Hong Kong. They cannot examine any ship's manifest before it leaves the port.

The production of cocaine is very simple, unlike heroin , and great fortunes are to be made by those willing to take ri sks for and on behalf of the \"higher ups.\" As in the heroin trade, interlopers are not welcome and often finish up as casualties, or v ictims of family feuds. In Colombia the drug mafia is a closely knit family. But such has been the bad publicity generated by the M19 gue rrilla attack on the Justice Building in Bogota (M19 is the priva te army of the cocaine barons) and the murder of Rodrigo Lara Boni lla, a prominent prosecutor and a judge, that the \"higher a uthority\" had to rearrange matters in Colombia. Accordingly, the Ochoas of the Medellin Cartel tu rned themselves in after being assured that they would n ot suffer any loss of fortune, harm of any kind, nor would they b e extradited to the United States. A deal was struck that, provided they repatriated the bulk of their huge narco-dollar for tunes to Colombian banks, no punitive action would be taken against them. The Ochoas—Jorge, Fabio, and their top man, Pablo E scobar, would be held in private jails that resemble a luxur y-class motel room, and then be sentenced to a maximum term of tw o years-to be served in the same motel jail. This deal is ongoi ng. The Ochoas have also been guaranteed the right to continue to manage their \"business\" from their motel-prison. But that does not mean that the cocaine trade has come to a screeching halt. On the contrary, it has simply b een transferred to the second-string Cali cartel, and it is busines s as usual. For some strange reason the Cali cartel, which is equal in size to the Medellin cartel, has been—at least up until now—lar gely ignored by the DEA. Cali differs from the Medellin cartel i n that it is run by BUSINESSMEN, who eschew all forms of violence and n ever break agreements. Even more significant is that Cali does virtually no business in Florida. My source told me that the Cali cartel is run by shrewd businessmen unlike any seen in the cocaine business . He believes that they were \"specially appointed,\" but does not know by whom."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 119 \"They never call attention to themselves,\" he said. \"They do not go around importing red Ferraris like Jorge Ochoa d id, attracting immediate attention, because it is forbidden to imp ort such cars into Colombia.\" Cali cartel markets are in Los Angeles, New York and Houston, which closely parallel the heroin markets. Cali has not shown any signs of moving into Florida. A former DE A operative who is a colleague of mine said recently, \"These Ca li people are sure smart. They are a different breed to the Ochoa brothers. They act like professional businessmen. They are no w larger than the Medellin cartel and I think we are going to see a lot more cocaine get into the United States than ever before .

All i t did was make life a great deal easier for Nicolas Ardito Barlett a who used to be run by the Ochoa brothers and who is fixing to fron t for the Cali cartel.\" Based on my experience with the heroin trade I be lieve that the Committee of 300 has stepped in and taken over full control of the South American cocaine trade. There is no other explanation For the rise of the Cali cartel which i s coupled with the kidnaping of Noriega. Did Bush take his orders from London regarding Noriega? There is every indication that h e was literally PUSHED into invading Panama and kidnaping Noriega, who had become a serious impediment to \"trade\" in Panama, e specially in the banking business. Several former intelligence agents have given me their opinions which coincide with my own. Like the Gulf War that followed in the wake of Panama, it was only after s everal calls from the British Ambassedor in Washington that Bush finally plucked up enough courage to make his totally illeg al move on General Noriega. That he was supported by the Briti sh press and the New York Times, a British intelligence run news paper, speaks volumes. Noriega was formerly the darling of the Washingto n establishment. He frequently hob-knobbed with Willi am Casey and"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 120 Oliver North and even met with President George Bus h on at least two occasions. Noriega was often seen at the Pentag on where he was treated like one of those Arab potentates, and the red carpet was always laid out for him at CIA headquarters in Langley Virginia. U.S. Army Intelligence and the CIA are on record as having paid him $320,000. Then storm clouds began to appear on the horizon at about the same time the Cali cartel was taking over the c ocaine trade from the Ochoa brothers and Pablo Escobar. Led by S enator Jesse Helms, who sold out to Ariel Sharon and the Israeli Histradut Party in 1985, there suddenly began an agitation for the removal of Noriega. Jesse Helms and those of a like mind were backed up by Simon Hersh, a British intelligence agent working f or the New York Times, which has been a British intelligence mouthp iece in the U.S. since the time that M16 boss, Sir William Stephenso n, occupied the RCA building in New York. It is very significant that Helms should have cho sen to lead the charge against Noriega. Helms is the darling of the Sharon faction in Washington and Sharon was the principal gun-runner in Central America and Colombia. Moreover, Helms has t he respect of the Christian fundamentalists who believe in the ma xim: \"Israel, my country, right or wrong.\" Thus a powerful moment um was created to \"get Noriega.\" It is evident that Norieg a could well prove a serious impediment to the international dru g merchants and their Committee of 300 bankers, so he had to be removed before he could do some significant damage. Bush was pressured by his British masters to cond uct an illegal search and seizure operation in Panama that resulted in the deaths of no less than 7,000 Panamanians and wanton destruction of property. Nothing to implicate Noriega as a \"dru g dealer\" was ever found, so he was kidnaped and brought to the U .S. in one of the most blatant examples of international brigandr y in history. This illegal action probably best meets the Bush ph ilosophy: \"The moral dimensions of American (read British royal fa mily-Committee of 300) foreign policy require us to chart a moral course through a world of lesser evils. That's the real world, not b lack and while. Very few absolutes.\" "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 121 It was a \"lesser evil\" lo kidnap Noriega, rather than have him up-end the banks in Panama working for the Comm ittee of 300.

This is the world we have decided to accept. If it were not so, a firestorm of anger would have swept the country over the invasion of Panama, which would not have s topped until Bush was hounded from office. Nixon's Watergate tra nsgressions pale into insignificance next to the many impeachab le offenses committed by President Bush when he ordered the inv asion of Panama to kidnap General Noriega. The government case against Noriega is based upon perjured testimony by a group of big men, for the mo st part, already convicted and lying through their individua l and collective teeth to gel their own sentences lightened. Their p erformance would have pleased Gilbert and Sullivan immensely, were they alive today. \"They made them the rulers of DEA,\" mi ght be apropos instead of, \"They made them the rulers of Q ueen's Navy,\" from \"HMS Pinafore.\" It is an altogether grotesque scene to see how these con-artists are performing like not-so-we ll-trained seals for the U.S. Justice Department; that is if we care to insult such a nice clean animal by such an unworthy comparison. Key dates conflict wildly, key details are altoge ther conspicuous by their absence, lapses of memory on c rucial points all add up to the obvious fact that the government has no case against Noriega, but that does not matter; the Roya l Institute for International Affairs (RIIA) says \"convict him anyw ay\" and that is what poor Noriega can expect. One of the Justice De partment's star witnesses is one Floyd Carlton Caceres, a form er pilot for the Ochoa brothers. Following his arrest in 1986, Carlt on tried to ease his position at the expense of Noriega. He told his DEA interrogators that the Ochoa brot hers had paid Noriega $600,000 to allow three planes loaded with cocaine to land and refuel in Panama.

One who is even a sorrier liar than Carlton is Ca rlos Lehder, who was a kingpin in the Medellin Cartel until he w as arrested in Spain and sent to the U.S. Who gave the DEA the mos t vital information that Lehder was in Madrid? The DEA relu ctantly concedes that they owe this important catch to Nori ega. Now, however, the Justice Department is using Lehder as a witness against Noriega. If nothing else, this single witne ss demonstrates the wretchedness of the United States government's case against Manuel Noriega. In return for services rendered, Lehder has been granted an easing of his sentence and far nicer quarters—a room with a view and television—and his family was given perman ent residence in the U.S. Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney who prosecuted Lehder in 1988 told the Washington Pose \"I don't think the government should be in the business of dealing with Carlos Lehder, period.

There is need to mention U.S. participation in th e China opium trade which began in the southern United Stat es prior to the War Between The States. How can we tie the opiu m trade in with the great cotton plantations of the South? To do that, we have to start in Bengal, India, producers of the fi nest (if one can call such a foul substance fine) opium which was mu ch in demand. Cotton was THE biggest trade in England, after opiu m sales through the BEIC. Most of the cotton from Southern plantations was worked in the slave mills of Northern England, where women and children earned a pittance for a 16-hour day's work. The clo th mills were owned by the wealthy socialites in London, the Bari ngs, Palmerstons, Keswicks and most of all the Jardine M athesons who owned the Blue Star Shipping Line, on which the fin ished cotton cloth goods were shipped to India. They could care less about the hapless conditions endured by Her Majesty's subject. After all, that is what they were for, and their husbands and sons were useful for fighting wars to preserve Her Majesty's farflung emp ire as they had done for centuries, and latterly, in the bloody Boer War. That was British tradition, wasn't it?"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 124 Cotton cloth finished goods exported to India und ercut and destroyed the long-standing Indian producers of cot ton finished goods trade. Terrible privation was endured by thou sands of Indians thrown out of work as a result of cheaper B ritish goods taking over their markets.

Produce more opium and sell it for less to the British East India Company. This was the rock u pon which British trade grew and flourished. Without its opiu m trade, Britain would have been as bankrupt. Did the Southern plantation owners know about the ugly secret of opium-for-cotton goods? It is unlikely th at some of them didn't know what was going on. Take, for instance, the Sutherland family, one of the largest cotton plantation owners in the South. The Sutherlands were closely related to the Matheso n family— Jardine Matheson—who in turn had as their business partners the Baring Brothers, founders of the famous Peninsular and Orient Navigation Line (P&O), the largest of Britain's man y merchant shipping lines. The Barings were big investors in Southern planta tions as they were in the U.S. Clipper ships which plowed th rough the seas between Chinese ports and all the important ports a long the eastern seaboard of the United States.

The majority of families who go to make up the Ea stern Liberal Establishment, among whom are the wealthies t to be found in this country, derived their fortunes from either the cotton trade or the opium trade and in some instances from both.

It was the same Lord Inchcape who in 1923 warned that there must be no diminishing of opium p oppy cultivation in Bengal. \"This most important source of revenue must be safeguarded,\" he told the commission allegedly i nvestigating the production of opium gum in India. By 1846, some 120,000 \"coolies\" had already arriv ed in the U.S. to work on Harriman's railroad pushing westwar d. The \"pig trade\" was in full profitable swing because, of thi s number, it was estimated by the U.S. government 115,000 were opium addicts. Once the railroad was finished, the Chinese did not go back to where they came from, but settled in San Francisco, Los Angeles,"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 128 Vancouver and Portland. They created a huge culture problem that has never ceased to exist. It is interesting to note that Cecil John Rhodes, a Committee of 300 member who fronted for the Rothsch ilds in South Africa followed the Inchcape pattern, bringin g hundreds of thousand of Indian \"coolies\" to work on the sugar c ane plantations in Natal province. Among them was Mahatma Ghandi, a Communist agitator and troublemaker. Like the Chine se coolies, they were not returned to their country of origin o nce their contracts expired. They, too, went on to create a m assive social program, and their descendants became lawyers who s pearheaded the drive to infiltrate the government on behalf of the Africa National Congress. By 1875 the Chinese \"coolies\" operating out of Sa n Francisco had set up an opium supply ring that resu lted in 129,000 American opium addicts. What with the known 115,000 Chinese addicts, Lord Inchcape and his family were raking i n hundreds of thousands of dollars a year from this source alone which, in terms of today's dollar would represent at least a $100 m illion dollar income every year. The very same British and American families who h ad combined to wreck the Indian textile industry in th e promotion of the opium trade, and who brought African slaves to the U.S. combined to make the \"pig trade\" a valuable source of revenue. Later they were to combine to cause and promote the terrible War Between The States, also known as the American Civi l War. The decadent American families of the unholy part nership, thoroughly corrupted and wallowing in filthy lucre, went on to become what we know today as the Eastern Liberal Es tablishmemt whose members, under the careful guidance and direc tion of the Crown and subsequently its foreign policy executive arm, the Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA), ran this counry—and still does—from top to bottom through their secret upper- level, parallel government, which is tightly meshed with the Commit tee of 300, the ULTIMATE secret society. "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 129 By 1923, voices were being raised against this me nace that had been allowed to be imported into the United Sta tes. Believing the United States to be a free and sovereign nation , Congressman Stephen Porter, Chairman of the House of Representa tives Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced a bill which called f or the British to account for their opium export-import business on a country-by- country basis. The resolution set up quotas for eac h country, which if observed, would have reduced the opium mad e by lO%. The resolution was passed into law and the bill acc epted by the Congress of the United States. But the Royal Institute of International Affairs had other ideas. Founded in 1919 in the wake of the Paris Pea ce Conference held at Versailles, this was one of the earliest \"f oreign policy\" executors of the Committee of 300. Research I have done on the Congressional Records, House, show that Porter was totally unaware of the powerful forces he was up against. P orter was not even aware of the existence of the RIIA, much less that its specific purpose was to control every facet of the United St ates. Apparently Congressman Porter received some kind of an intimation from the Morgan Bank on Wall Street that he should drop the whole affair. Instead, an enraged Porter t ook his case to the League of Nations Opium Committee. Porter's tot al unawareness of who he was up against is demonstrate d in some of his correspondence to colleagues on the House Fo reign Affairs Committee in response to open British opposition to his proposals. Her Majesty's representative chided Porter and th en, acting like a father toward an errant son, the British del egate—on instructions from the RIIA—presented Her Majesty's proposals to INCREASE opium quotas to account for an increase in the consumption of opium for medicinal purposes. Accord ing to documents that I was able to find in The Hague, Por ter was at first confused, then amazed and then enraged. Joined by t he Chinese delegate, Porter stormed out of the plenipotentiary session of the Committee session, leaving the field to the British .

It was stated in papers and documents that I saw that the Baring Brothers ran the Philadelphia Quakers and owned hal f of the real estate of that city, all made possible because of t he fortune the Baring Brothers had amassed from the China opium tr ade. Another beneficiary of the Committee of 300's largess was S tephen Girard, whose descendants inherited the Girard Bank and Tru st. The names of the families, whose history is inter twined with that of Boston and who would never give us ord inary folk the time of day, were wrapped in the arms of the Commit tee of 300 and its vastly lucrative BEIC China opium trade. Ma ny of the famous families became associated with the notoriou s Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank which is still the clearing house for billions of dollars that flow from the opium trade in China. Such famous names as Forbes, Perkins and Hathaway appear in the records of the British East India Com pany. These genuine American \"bluebloods\" created Russell and C ompany, whose main trade was in opium, but also ran other s hipping enterprises from China to South America and all poi nts in between. As a reward for their services to the British Crown and the BEIC, the Committee of 300 granted them a monopoly in the slave trade in 1833. Boston owes its celebrated past to the cotton-opi um-slave trade granted to it by the Committee of 300 and it is stated in the records I was privileged to see in London that Bost on's merchant families were the chief supporters of the British C rown in the United States.

The Perkins family, so illustrious that their nam e is still mentioned in awed whispers, were deeply involved in the nefarious filthy China opium trade. In fact Perkins the elder was one of the first Americans to be elected to the Com mittee of 3OO. His son, Thomas Nelson, was Morgan's man in Boston, and as such also an agent for British intelligence. His un savory-I would say disgusting—past was not in question when he ric hly endowed Harvard University. After all, Canton and Tientsin are a long way from Boston, and who would have cared anyway? What helped The Perkinses a lot was that Morgan w as a powerful member of the Committee of 300, which enab led Thomas N. Perkins to rapidly further his career in the Chi na opium trade. All the Morgans and Perkinses were Freemasons, whic h was another tie that bound them together, for only Free masons of highest rank have any hope of being selected by the Committee of 300. Sir Robert Hart, who for almost three decades was chief of the Imperial Chinese Customs Service (read the Brit ish Crown's number one agent in the opium trade in China was su bsequently appointed to the board of Morgan Guarantee Bank's F ar Eastern Division. Through access to the historical records in Londo n and Hong Kong, I was able to establish that Sir Robert developed an intimate relationship with Morgan operations in the United States. It is worthy of note that Morgan interests in the o pium/ heroin trade have continued in an unbroken line; witness t he fact that David Newbigging is on the advisory board of Morgan 's Hong Kong operation run in conjunction with Jardine Matheson. To those who know Hong Kong, the name of Newbiggi ng will be familiar as the most powerful name in Hong Kong.

The two-track entry into the United States of alc ohol and drugs were products of the same stable occupied by the same thoroughbreds. First, prohibition had to be introdu ced into the United States.

There is proof that th e Mafia was involved in this through the CIA, which brings to m ind that it all started with the old Meyer Lansky network which evo lved into the Irgun terrorist organization, and Lansky proved to be one of the best vehicles for peddling cultural warfare against the West. Lansky was, through more respectable fronts, asso ciated with the British higher-ups in bringing gambling an d dope distribution to Paradise Island in the Bahamas unde r the cover of The Mary Carter Paint Company—a joint Lansky-British M16 venture.

They are Gnostics, Cathars, members of the cu lt of Dionysus, Osiris, or worse. To them, \"ordinary\" people are th ere to be used for their purposes. Their high-priests, Bulwer-Lytt on and Aldous Huxley, preached the gospel of drugs as a beneficia l substance.

What Huxley was advocating and which is official policy of the Comm ittee of 300 and its surrogate, RIIA, can be quite simply stated as mass mind control.

Irregular warfare is the most terrible fo rm of warfare which, while it has a beginning, has no ending. Some will question the involvement of the British royal families, past and present, in the drug trade.

The oldest maxim in the intelligence business is, \"If you want to hide something, put it where everyone c an see it. F. S.

Turner was the secretary of the Anglo Oriental Society of the Supp ression of the Opium Trade. He declined to be silenced by Crown sp okesperson Sir R. Temple. Turner stated that the government, a nd therefore the Crown, had to withdraw from the opium monopoly, \"and if it takes any revenues at all, take only that which acc rues from taxation honestly meant to have a restrictive force . \" Turner was answered by a spokesman for the monarc hy, Lord Lawrence, who fought against the BEIC losing i ts monopoly. \"It would be desirable to get rid of the monopoly, but I myself am disinclined to be the agent of change. If it is que stion of moderate loss that we could afford, I would not hesitate to undertake it.\" (Taken from the Calcutta Papers 1870.) By 1874 the war against the British monarchy and the aristocracy over its deep involvement in the China opium trade"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" 139 was getting heated. The Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade violently assailed the aristocracy of the day and pressed home its attacks in a fearless manner we would do w ell to emulate. The society said that the Treaty of Tientsin, which Forced China to accept the importation of enormous amounts of opium , was a dastardly crime against the Chinese people. There arose a mighty warrior, Joseph Grundy Alexa nder, a barrister by profession who, in 1866, led a strong attack on British Crown opium policy in China in which he openly ment ioned the involvement of the royal family and the aristocracy . For the first time Alexander brought India, \"the Jewel in the Cro wn,\" into the picture. He laid the blame squarely where it belong ed, on the monarchy, the so-called aristocracy and its servant s in the British government. Under the direction of Alexander, the society com mitted itself to the total destruction of the cultivation of opium poppies in Bengal, India. Alexander proved to be a doughty opp onent. Through his leadership, the drug aristocracy began to falter and, in the face of his open denouncements of the royal family and its hangers-on, several Members of Parliament began sid ing with him Conservatives, Unionists, Labor. Alexander made it clear that the drug trade was not a party political issue; it was for all parties to join together in helping to eradicate the menace. Lord Kimberly, spokesman for the royal family and the entrenched oligarchists, threatened that any attemp ts to interfere with what he called \"the commerce of the nation wil l run into serious opposition from the cabinet.\" Alexander and his society pressed on in the face of innumerable threats and f inally parliament agreed to appoint a Royal Commission to enquire into the opium trade, with Lord Kimberly, who was Secret ary of India, as its chairman. A more inappropriate person to hea d the commission could not have been found. It was akin t o Dulles being appointed to the Warren Commission. In his first statement, Lord Kimberly made it cle ar that he would rather resign from his august position than c onsent to a resolution that would surrender Indian Opium Revenu es.

Indian opium revenues we nt straight into the royal coffers and the pockets of the nobil ity and the oligarchists and plutocrats, and made them billiona ires. Rowntree's book, \"THE IMPERIAL DRUG TRADE\" gives a fascinating account of how Prime Minister Gladstone and his fellow plutocrats lied, cheated, twisted and turned to kee p the astonishing truth of the involvement of the British monarchy in the opium trade from being exposed. Rowntree's book is a treasure house of information on the deep involvement of the British royal family and the lords and ladies of England and the huge fortunes they accumulated from the misery of the Chinese opi um addicts. Lord Kimberly, secretary of the commission of inq uiry, was himself deeply involved in the opium trade so he di d everything in his power to close the proceedings to all who sough t the truth. Finally, under a great deal of pressure from the pu blic, the Royal Commission was forced to open the door to this inqu iry just a crack, so that it became apparent that the highest in the land were running the opium trade and receiving huge benefits from it. But the door was quickly slammed shut again, and the Ro yal Commission called no expert witnesses, thereafter s itting for an absurdly short period of time. The commission was n othing but a farce and a cover-up, such as we have become accust omed to in 20th century America. The Eastern Liberal Establishment families of the United States were just as deeply involved in the China opi um trade as were the British, indeed they still are. Witness re cent history when James Earl Carter toppled the Shah of Iran. Why was the Shah deposed and then murdered by the United States gove rnment? fn a word, because of DRUGS. The Shah had clamped down and virtually put an end to the immensely lucrative opi um trade being conducted out of Iran by the British. At the time t hat the Shah took over in Iran, there were already one million o pium/heroin addicts. This the British would not tolerate, so they sent the United States to do their dirty work for them in terms of the \"special"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 141 relationship\" between the two countries. When Khome ini took over the U.S. Embassy in Teheran, arms sales by the Unit ed States, which had begun with the Shah, were not discontinue d. Why not? Had the United States done so, Khomeini would have canceled the British monopoly of the opium trade in his country. To prove the point, after 1984, Khomeini's liberal attitude towa rd opium had increased the number of addicts to 2 million, accor ding to United Nations and World Health Organization statistics. Both President Carter and his successor, Ronald R eagan, willingly and with full knowledge of what was at st ake, went on supplying arms to Iran even while American hostages languished in captivity. In 1980 I wrote a monograph under the title, \"What Really Happened in Iran,\" which set out the facts. The arms trade with Iran was sealed at a meeting between Cyrus Van ce, a servant of the Committee of 300, and Dr. Hashemi, which res ulted in the U.S. Air Force beginning an immediate airlift of ar ms to Iran, carried on even at the height of the hostage crisis the arms came from U.S. Army stockpiles in Germany and some were even flown directly from the United States with refueling stop s at the Azores. With the advent of Khomeini, who was put in power in Iran by the Committee of 300, opium production skyrocket ed. By 1984 Iran's opium production exceeded 650 metric tons of opium per annum. What Carter and Reagan did was ensure that t here was no further interference in the opium trade and they ca rried out the mandate given to them by the oligarchical families in Britain in this connection. Iran presently rivals the Golden Triang le in the volume of opium produced. The Shah was not the only victim of the Committee of 300 William Buckley, CIA station chief in Beirut, in al l his lack of experience on who is behind the opium trade, began conducting investigations in Iran, Lebanon and even spent time in Pakistan. From Islamabad, Buckley began sending back damning reports to the CIA in Langley about the burgeoning opium trade in the Golden Crescent and Pakistan. The U.S. Embassy in I slamabad was firebombed, but Buckley escaped the mob attack and returned to Washington because his cover was blown by forces unknown.

Under brutal int errogation by General Mohammed el Khouili of Syrian intelligence to force him to disclose the names of all field officers of the DEA in these countries, he was brutally murdered. His efforts to expose the huge opium trade developing out of Pakistan, Lebano n and Iran cost Buckley his life. If the remaining free men in this world believe t hat singlehandedly or in small groups they can smash th e drug trade, they are sorely mistaken. They could cut off the te ntacles of the opium and cocaine trade here and there, but never t he head. The crowned cobras of Europe and their Eastern Liberal Establishment family will not tolerate it. The war on drugs which the Bush administration is allegedly fighting, but which it is not, is for TOTAL legalization of ALL types and classes of drug s.

The South African Boers received nothing out of the BILLIONS UPON BILLIONS of dollars derived from the sale of THEIR gold and diamonds. The Committee of 300 quickly took full control of these vast treasures, control which it even now maintains thro ugh one of its members, Sir Harry Oppenheimer. The average South A frican receives $100 per annum per capita from the gold an d diamond industry. The BILLIONS which flow out annually go t o the bankers of the Committee of 300. It is one of the most foul and vile stories of greed, theft and the murder of a nation ever rec orded in the annals of history. How could the British Crown have succeeded in pul ling off this stunning fraud of gigantic proportion? To acco mplish such a Herculean task requires skilled organizing with dev oted agentsin- place to carry out the daily instructions passed do wn from the conspirators' hierarchy. The first step was a press propaganda campaign portraying the Boers as uncivilized barbar ians, only slightly human, who were denying British citizens t he right to vote in the Boer Republic. Then, demands were made on Pa ul Kruger, leader of the Transvaal Republic, which of course c ould not be met. After that, a series of incidents were staged to pr ovoke the Boers into retaliation, but that didn't work either. Then came the infamous Jameson Raid where a certain Jameson led a party of several hundred armed men in an attack on the trans vaal. War followed immediately thereafter. Queen Victoria mounted the largest and best equipp ed army that the world had ever seen at that time ( 1898). Victoria thought he war would be over in two weeks, since the Boers had no standing army and no trained militia and would be n o match for"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 144 her 400,000 soldiers drawn from the ranks of Britai n's underclasses. The Boers never numbered more than 80 ,000 farmers and their sons—some were as young as fourte en-Rudyard Kipling also thought the war would be over in less than a week. Instead, with rifle in one hand and the Bible in the other, the Boers held out for three years. \"We went to Sou th Africa thinking the war would be over in a week,\" said Kip ling. \"Instead, the Boers taught us no end of a lesson.\" That same \"lesson\" could be taught to the Committee of 300 today if we could but muster 10,000 leaders, good men and true to lead this nati on in battle against the gargantuan monster threatening to devou r everything our Constitution stands for. After the war ended in 1902, the British Crown ha d to consolidate its grip on the unimaginable fortune of gold and diamonds that lay beneath the barren veldt of the B oer Republics of Transvaal and Orange Free State. This was done t hrough the Round Table of the legend of King Arthur and his Kn ights. The Round Table is strictly a British M16 intelligence operation established by the Committee of 300 which, together with the Rhodes Scholarship program, is a dagger in the hear tland of America. The Round Table was established in South Africa b y Cecil Rhodes and funded by the English Rothschild family. Its purpose was to train business leaders loyal to the British Crown who would secure the vast gold and diamond treasures for the British Crown. South Africans had their birthright stolen from the m in a coup so massive and all pervading that it was apparent only a central unified command could have pulled it off. That unif ied command was the Committee of 300. That this was accomplished is not in dispute. By the early 1930's, the British Crown had a stranglehold on the biggest supplies of gold and diamonds ever found in the wor ld. NOW THE COMMITTEE OF 300 HAD AT ITS DISPOSAL BOTH THE VAST FORTUNE COMING FROM THE DRUG TRADE AND THE EQUALLY VAST FORTUNE OF THE MINERAL AND METAL WEALTH OF SOUTH AFRICA. Financial control of the world was co mplete. "},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 145 The Round Table played a pivotal role in the coup . The express purpose of the Round Table, after swallowin g up South Africa, was to blunt the benefits to the United Sta tes of the American War of Independence, and once more bring t he United States under British control. Organizing ability wa s essential for such an enterprise and it was provided by Lord Alfr ed Milner, protege of the London Rothschild family. Using Scot tish Rite Freemason principles in selecting members of Round Table, chose chosen underwent a period of intense training at Ca mbridge and Oxford Universities under the watchful eyes of John Ruskin, a self- confessed \"old school communist,\" and T. H. Green, an operative of M16. It was Green, the son of a Christian evangelical cleric, who spawned Rhodes, Milner, John Wheeler Bennet, A. D. Lindsay, George Bernard Shaw and Hjalmar Schacht, Hitler's fi nance minister. I pause here to remind readers that the R ound Table is only ONE SECTOR of this vast and all-encompassing C ommittee of 300. Yet the Round Table itself consists of a maze of companies, institutions, banks and educational establishments, which in itself would take qualified insurance actuaries a year to sort out. Round Tablers fanned out throughout the world to take control of fiscal and monetary policies and politic al leadership in all countries where they operated. In South Africa, Gen eral Smuts, who had fought against the British in the Boer War, was \"turned\" and became a leading British intelligence, military and political agent who espoused the cause of the British Crown. In the United States, in later years, the task of boring away at the United States from the inside fell to William Yandell Elliot, the man who spawned Henry Kissinger and who was responsible for his met eoric rise to power as chief U.S. advisor to the Committee of 300 . William Yandell Elliot was \"an American at Oxford ,\" who had already served the Committee of 300 well, which is a prerequisite for higher office in the service of th e committee. After graduating from Vanderbilt University in 1917, Elli ot was drafted by the Rothschild-Warburg banking network. He worke d at the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco and rose to b e a director. From there he acted as a Warburg-Rothschild intelli gence officer, reporting on the important areas of the United Stat es he was"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 146 overseeing. Elliot's \"Freemason\" talent spotters re commended him for a Rhodes Scholarship and, in 1923, he went to B alliol College at Oxford University whose \"dreaming spires\" hid a network of intrigue and future traitors to the West. Balliol College was, and still is, the center of recruiting for the Round Table. After a thorough brainwashing cond ucted by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations representati ve, A.D. Lindsay, who had succeeded Master of Balliol T. H. Green, Elliot was received into the Round Table and sent to The R oyal Institute of International Affairs to be given his assignment , which was that he return to the United States to become a leader i n the academic community. The Round Table's driving philosophy was to have Round Tablers in positions to formulate and carry out soc ial policies through social institutions whereby what Ruskin cal led \"the masses\" could be manipulated. Members infiltrated t he highest levels of banking after under going a course at the Tavistock Institute. The course was drawn up by Lord Leconsfi eld, an intimate of the British royal family, and later run by Robert Brand who went on to manage Lazard Freres. The Royal Inst itute of International Affairs was and remains totally inter faced with the British monarchy. Some of the spinoffs of the Round Table are the Bilderbergers, set up and run by Duncan Sandys, a p rominent politician and son-in-law of the late Winston Churc hill, the Ditchley Foundation, a secret banker's club which I exposed in my 1983 work, \"International Banker's Conspiracy: The Ditch ley Foundation,\" the Trilateral Commission, the Atlanti c Council of the United States and the Aspen Institute for Humanisti c Studies, whose well-hidden, behind the scenes founder was Lo rd Bullock of the RIIA for whom Robert Anderson fronted. The way in which Henry Kissinger, the RllA's chie f asset in the United States, came to power is a story of the triumph of the institution of the British monarchy over the Republ ic of the United States of America. It is a tale of horror, too long to be included here. Nevertheless, it would be remiss of me if I d id not mention"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 147 just a few of the highlights of Kissinger's rise to fame, fortune and power. After a stint in the United States Army, beginnin g with the job of driving General Fritz Kraemer around war-torn Germany, thanks to the Oppenheimer family Kissinger was pick ed to attend Wilton Park for further training. At the time he he ld the rank of private first class. In 1952 Kissinger was sent to the Tavistock Institute where R. V. Dicks took him in hand and tu rned him inside out. Thereafter there was no holding Kissinger back . He was later drafted to serve under George Franklin and Hamilton Fish of the Council on Foreign Relations' New York office. It is believed that the official nuclear policy a dopted by the United States was delivered to Kissinger during his stay at Tavistock and further shaped by his participation i n \"Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy,\" a Round Table seminar which brought forth the doctrine known as \"flexible respo nse,\" a total irrationality, which became known by the acronym MA D. Thanks to William Yandell Elliot and under the tu telage of John Wheeler Bennett, top intelligence director of the Round Table and chief of MI6 field operations in the United Sta tes, Kissinger became Elliot's \"favorite son\" as he explained in h is book, \"The Pragmatic Revolt in Politics.\" Kissinger was coopte d into the Round Table to push monetarist policies he studied at Har vard International Seminars. Kissinger avidly absorbed Elliot's teachings and was no longer recognizable as the man General Kraemer once described as \"my little Jew-boy driver.\" Kissinger was inculc ated with the spirit of the Master of Balliol, becoming an ardent disciple of decadent British aristocracy. Adopting the philosop hies of Toynbee, chief intelligence director for MI6 at the Royal In stitute of International Affairs, Kissinger used its papers to write his undergraduate \"dissertation.\" By the mid 1960's Kissinger had proved his worth t o the Round Table and the RIIA, and thus to the British m onarchy. As a reward and a test of what he had learned, Kissinger was placed in charge of a small group consisting of James Schless inger,"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 148 Alexander Haig and Daniel Ellsberg. The Round Table was using to conduct a series of experiments. Cooperating with t his group was the Institute of Policy Studies chief theoretician Noam Chomsky. Haig, like Kissinger, worked for General Kraemer, albeit not as a driver, and the general found a number of vari ed openings in the Department of Defense for his protege. Once Kis singer was installed as National Security Advisor, Kraemer got Haig the job as his deputy. Ellsberg, Haig, and Kissinger then set in motion the RIIA's Watergate plan to oust President Nixon for d isobeying direct instructions. Haig played the lead role in brainwas hing and confusing President Nixon, and in effect it was Kis singer who ran the White House during this softening up of the Pre sident. As I mentioned in 1984, Haig was the White House go-betw een known as \"Deep Throat,\" passing information to the Washin gton Post team of Woodward and Bernstein. The Watergating of Nixon was the biggest coup yet pulled off by the Round Table as an agency and an arm of t he RIIA. All the tangled threads led back to the Round Table; fr om there to the RIIA, and right back to the Queen of England. The h umiliation of Nixon was an object lesson and a warning to future Presidents of the United States not to imagine they could go agai nst the Committee of 300 and win. Kennedy was brutally murd ered in full view of the American people for the same reason; Ni xon was not considered worthy enough to suffer the same fate as John F. Kennedy. But whatever the method used, the Committee of 30 0 made sure that all would-be aspirants for the White House got the message: \"Nobody is beyond our reach.\" That this me ssage remains just as forceful as it was when Kennedy was murdered and Nixon hounded out of office, is evidenced by th e character of President George Bush, whose eagerness to please hi s masters should be cause for grave concern among those who w orry about the future of the United States.

From this b eginning we can trace the roots of the 1991 recession/depression wh ich has thus far cost the jobs of 30 million Americans. It is virtually impossible to penetrate the Commi ttee of 300 and the oligarchical families that go to make it up . The camouflage they pull over themselves as protective covering is very hard to rip off. This fact should be noted by every freedom-lov ing American: The Committee of 300 dictates what passes for Unite d States foreign and domestic policies and has done so for o ver 200 years. Nowhere was this more strikingly portrayed than whe n a cocky President Truman had the wind knocked out of him by Churchill ramrodding the so-called \"Truman Doctrine\" down the throat of the little man from Independence, Missouri. Some of their former members, whose descendants f illed vacancies caused by death, and present members incl ude Sir Mark Turner, Gerald Villiers, Samuel Montague, the Inchc apes, Keswicks, Peases, Schroeders, Airlies, Churchills, Frasers, L azars and Jardine Mathesons. The full list of members is presented el sewhere in this book; these people on the Committee ORDERED Preside nt Wilson to go to war against Germany in the First World War ; this Committee ordered Roosevelt to engineer the Japanes e attack on Pearl Harbor with the object of getting the United States into the Second World War. These people, this Committee, ordered this nation to war in Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf. The plain trut h is that the United States has fought in 5 wars this century for and on behalf of the infamous Committee of 300. It seems that, ap art from just a few, no one has stopped to ask, \"WHY ARE WE FIGHT ING THESE WARS?\" The big drum of \"patriotism,\" martial music and waving flags and yellow ribbons, it seems, caused a great nation to become bereft of its senses. On the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, a new \"h ate Japan\" campaign is being waged, not by the Institut e of Pacific Relations (IPR), but in the most direct and brazen manner by the"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" 150 Bush Administration and the Congress. The object is the same as it was when Roosevelt inspired the attack on Pearl Har bor, paint the Japanese as aggressors and wage economic war, then ready our forces for the next phase—armed aggression against Japan. This is already in the works; it is only a matter of time before more of our sons and daughters are sent off to be slaughtered in the service of the feudal lords of t he Committee of 300. We ought to shout from the housetops, \"It is n ot for freedom nor for love of country that we are going to die, b ut for a system of tyranny that will shortly envelope the entire wo rld.\" So tight is the grip of this organization on Brit ain that 95% of British citizens have, since the 1700's, been fo rced to accept as their share, less than 20% of the national wealth o f the country. This is what the oligarchical feudal lords of Engla nd like to call \"democracy.\" These nice, proper English gentlemen a re, in reality, utterly ruthless—what they did in India, Sudan, Egy pt, Iraq, Iran and Turkey will be repeated in every country under the New World Order-One World Government. They will use every nat ion and its wealth to protect their privileged way of life. It is this class of British aristocracy whose fortunes are inextricably woven and intertwined with the drug trade, the gold, diamond and arms trades, banking, commerce and industry, oil, the ne ws media and entertainment industry. Apart from the rank and file of the Labour Party (but not its leaders), the majority of British political leaders are descendants of titled families, the titles being hereditary and ha nded down from father to eldest son. This system ensures that no \" outsideers\" aspire to political power in England. Nevertheless, some aliens have been able to squeeze their way in. Take the case of Lord Halifax, former British Amb assador to Washington and the man who delivered Committee of 3 00 orders to our government during the Second World War. Hali fax's son, Charles Wood, married a Miss Primrose, a blood rela tive of Lord Rothschild. Behind such names as Lord Swaythling is hidden the name of Montague, director of the Bank of England a nd adviser and confidant of the majority stockholder of the She ll Oil Company, Queen Elizabeth II.

It s trives toward a One World Government rather well described by one o f its late members, H. G. Wells, in his work commissioned by t he Committee which Wells boldly called: \"THE OPEN CONS PIRACY- PLANS FOR A WORLD REVOLUTION.\" It was a bold statement of intent, but not really so bold since nobody believed Wells except the Great Superi or Ones, the Anenherbes and those who were what we would call \"i nsiders\" today. Here is an extract of what Wells proposed: \"The Open Conspiracy will appear first, I believe as a conscious organization of intelligent, and in some cases wealthy men, as a movement having distinct social and polit ical aims, confessedly ignoring most of the existing apparatus of political control, or using it only as an incidental implemen t in the stages, a mere movement of a number of people in a certain di rection, who will presently discover, with a sort of a surprise, the common object toward which they are all moving. In all sor ts of ways, they will be influencing and controlling the ostensible government.\" Like George Orwell's 1984, Wells'account is a mas s-appeal for a One World Government.

Even the Christian Bible says what is man that God should be mindful of him? For me men are nothing but a brain at one end and a shit factory at the other. \" It was from this brutish view of man that Emmanue l The Christ came to rescue the world. Sydney Reilly was the MI6 operative sent to watch over Dzerzinski's activitie s. Reilly was allegedly shot by his friend Felix while attempting to flee Russia. The elaborate plot was devised when certain members of the British Parliament raised a hue and cry and began t o loudly demand an accounting of Reilly's activities in Russ ia, which threatened to expose the role of the Committee of 3 00 in gaining control of the Baku oilfields and its major role in assisting Lenin and Trotsky during the Bolshevik Revolution. Rather than have the truth dragged out of Reilly, MI6 thought it expedie nt to stage his death. Reilly lived out his days in utter luxury in a Russia villa usually reserved for the Bolshevik elite. Arguing that chaos would ensue unless the \"Atlant ic Alliance,\" a euphemism for the Committee of 300 rul ed post industrial America, Peccei proposed a Malthusian tr iaging on a global scale.

Plans that were laid down by the Committee of 300 for a One World Government, which included the prospect of a divided Russia, are now approachi ng a point of rapid escalation. Events in Russia at the close of 1991 are all the more dramatic when viewed against the 1960 longrang e planning by the Committee of 300. In Western Europe the people are working toward a federation of states within a one government framew ork with a single currency. From there the EEC system will be transferred bit by bit to the United States and Canada. The United Nations is benign slowly but surely transformed into a rubber stamp of One World Government, with policies dictated to it by t he United States as we saw in the case of the Gulf War. Precisely the same thing is happening with the Br itish Parliament. Discussion on Britain's participation i n the Gulf War was kept to a ridiculously minimal level and belate dly took place only during a motion to adjourn the House. This has never happened before in the ancient history of parliamen t, where so important a decision had to be made and so little t ime was allowed for discussion. One of the most noteworthy events i n parliamentary history has gone virtually unnoticed. We are close to the point where the United States will send its military Forces to settle any and all disputes brought before the United Nations. Departing Secretary General Perez d e Cuellar, heavily laden with bribe money, was the most compli ant U.N. leader in history in granting demands of the United States without discussion. His successor will be even more incline d to go along with whatever the U.S. government places before him . This is an important step along the road to a One World Govern ment. The International Court of Justice at The Hague w ill be used in increasing measure in the next two years to settle legal arguments of all types. It is of course the prototy pe for a One World Government legal system that will supplant al l others. As for central banks, essential in the planning of the New World Order, this is already very much a fait-accompli with the Bank of International Settlements dominating the scene at t he close of 1991. Private banks are fast disappearing in prepar ation for the"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" 160 Big Ten banks that will control banking the world o ver under the guidance of BIS and the IMF. Welfare states abound in Europe, and the United S tates is fast becoming the largest welfare state in the worl d.

The abolition of privately owned firearms is alre ady in force in three quarters of the world. Only in the United States can the populace still own guns of all types, but that lega l right is being chipped away at an alarming rate by local and state laws which violate the Constitutional right of all citizens to bear arms. Private gun ownership will have become a thing of the past in the United States by the year 2010. SlMILARLY, EDUCATION IS BEING ERODED AT AN ALARMING RATE. PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE BEING FORCED TO CLOSE BY A VARIETY OF LEGAL STRATAGEMS AND LACK OF FUNDING. The standard of education in the United St ates has already sunk to such a deplorable level that today it can barely be classified as education at all. This is according t o plan; as I described earlier, the One World Government does no t want our youth to be properly educated. Destruction of national identity proceeds apace. It is no longer a good thing to be patriotic unless it is i n the cause of some One World Government project such as the war o f genocide being waged against the nation of Iraq, or the impe nding destruction of Libya. Racial pride is now frowned u pon and deemed to be an illegal act in many parts of the wo rld, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, BRITAIN, WESTERN EUROP E AND CANADA, ALL COUNTRIES HAVING THE LARGEST CONCENTRATIONS OF THE WHITE RACE.

A list of such governments destroye d by the U.S."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 161 is long, and it is difficult for the non-informed t o accept that government of a country allegedly wedded to republi canism under a unique constitution would engage in such conduct, but the facts speak for themselves. This is a goal which was set over a century ago b y the Committee of 300. The United States has led the att acks on such governments and continues to do so even as the Unit ed States republican base is being steadily undermined. Start ing with James Earl Carter's legal counsel, Lloyd Cutler, a commit tee of constitutional lawyers has been working to change t he U.S. Congress into a non-representative parliamentary sy stem. Work has been in progress since 1979 on the blueprint fo r such a change, and because of his devotion to the cause, C utler was made a member of the Committee of 300. The final dr aft for a parliamentary type of government is to be presented to the Committee of 300 at the end of 1993. In the new parliamentary system, members will not be responsible to their constituents, but to parliamen tary whips and will vote the way they are told to vote. Thus, by ju dicial and bureaucratic subversion will the Constitution vanis h as will individual liberty. Preplanned degrading of man thr ough licentious sexual practices will be stepped up. New sexually d egenerate cults are even now being set up by the British Crown-work ing through the SIS and MI6 services. As we already know, all c ults operating in the world today are the product of British intel ligence acting for the oligarchical rulers. We may think this phase of creating a whole new c ult which specializes in sexual degenerate behavior is still far off, but my information is that it is due to be stepped up i n 1992. By 1994 it will be quite commonplace to have \"live shows\" i n the most prestigious clubs and places of entertainment. This type of \"entertainment\" is already in the process of having its image cleaned and brightened. Soon the big names in Hollywood and the entertain ment world will be recommending this or that club as a \" must\" for live sex shows. Lesbianism and homosexuality will not be featured. This new socially acceptable \"entertainment\" will c onsist of"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" 162 heterosexual displays and will be written up in rev iews as one finds in today's newspapers about shows on Broadway , or the latest hit movie. An unprecedented assault on moral values will go into high gear in 1992. Pornography will no longer be called \"pornography,\" but adult sex entertainment. Sloganeering will take the form of \"why hide it when everybody does it. Let's take awa y the image that public displays of sex are ugly and dirty.\" No more will those who care for this type of unbridled sexual lust hav e to go to seedy porno parlours. Instead, the upper-class supper clu bs and places favored by the rich and famous will make public sex ual displays a highly \"artistic\" form of entertainment. Worse yet, some church \"leaders\" will even recommend it. The voluminous all-pervading and enormous social psychiatry apparatus put in place by the Tavistock Institute and its huge web of related capabilities has been under the control of one single entity, and that entity is still in control as we enter 1992. That single entity, the conspirators'hierarchy, is called THE COMMITTEE OF 300. It is a power structure and a pow er center that operates far beyond the reach of any single wo rld leader or any government, including the United States governm ent and its Presidents—as the late John F. Kennedy found out. T he Kennedy murder was an operation of the Committee of 300 and we shall return to that. The Committee of 300 is the ultimate secret socie ty made up of an untouchable ruling class, which includes t he Queen of England, the Queen of the Netherlands, the Queen of Denmark and the royal families of Europe. These aristocrats decided at the death of Queen Victoria, the matriarch of the Venet ian Black Guelphs that, in order to gain world-wide control, it would be necessary for its aristocratic members to \"go into business\" with the non-aristocratic but extremely powerful leaders of corporate business on a global scale, and so the doors to ult imate power were opened to what the Queen of England likes to r efer to as \"the commoners.\" From my days in the intelligence business I know that heads of foreign governments refer to this all-powe rful body as"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" 163 \"The Magicians.\" Stalin coined his own phrase to de scribe them: \"The Dark Forces,\" and President Eisenhower, who wa s never able to get beyond the \"hofjuden\" (court Jew) grade, refe rred to it in a colossal understatement as \"the military-industrial complex.\" Stalin kept the USSR heavily armed with conventional and n uclear forces because he did not trust what he called \"the family .\" His ingrained mistrust and fear of the Committee of 300 proved to be well- founded. Popular entertainment, especially the medium of m ovie making, was used to bring discredit upon those who tried to warn of this most dangerous threat to individual liberty and freedom of mankind. Freedom is a God-given law which man has c onstantly sought to subvert and undermine; yet the yearning f or freedom by each individual is so great that up to now, no syst em has been able to tear that feeling from the heart of mad. Th e experiments that have gone on in the USSR, Britain and the USA, to blunt and dull mans yearnings for freedom, have thus far prov ed to be unsuccessful. But with the coming of the New World Order-One Wo rld Government, far-reaching experiments will be steppe d up to drive mans God-given yearning for freedom out of his mind , body and soul. What we are already experiencing is but nothi ng, a mere bagatelle, when compared with what is to come. Atta cking the soul is the thrust of a host of experiments being r eadied, and I regret to say that institutions in the United State s will play a leading role in the terrible experiments which have already been carried out on local small-scale levels at such pla ces as Bethesda Naval Hospital and Vacaville prison in California. The movies we have seen thus far include the Jame s Bond series, the \"Assassination Bureau,\" the \"Matarese C ircle\" and so on. They were make-believe movies, designed to hide the truth that such organizations do exist and on a far greater sc ale than even Hollywood's fertile idea-men could dream up. Yet the Assassination Bureau is absolutely real. It exists in Europe and the United States solely to do the biddi ng of the Committee of 300 to carry out high-level assassinat ions where all other remedies have failed. It was PERMINDEX which ran the"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" 164 Kennedy assassination under the direction of Sir Wi lliam Stephenson, for years the Queen of England's number one \"pest control\" operative. Clay Shaw, a contract agent of the CIA, ran PERMI NDEX out of the Trade Mart Center in New Orleans. Former New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison came very close to c racking the Kennedy assassination plot up to the level of Clay Shaw until Garrison was \"dealt with\" and Shaw was found not qu ilty of involvement in the Kennedy assassination plot. The fact that Shaw was eliminated in the manner of Jack Ruby, another CIA contract agent—both died of induced quick-acting cancer—spea ks volumes that Garrison was on the right track. A second assassination bureau is located in Switz erland and was until recently run by a shadowy figure of whom no photographs existed after 1941. The operations were and probably still are financed by the Oltramaire family—Swiss B lack Nobility, owners of the Lombard Odier Bank of Geneva, a Commi ttee of 300 operation. The primary contact man was Jacques Sous telle—this according to U.S. Army-G2 intelligence files. This group was also closely allied with Allen Dul les and Jean de Menil, an important member of the Committee of 300 and a very prominent name in the oil industry in Texas. ArmyG2 records show that the group was heavily involved in the arms trade in the Middle East, but more than that, the a ssassination bureau made no less than 30 attempts to assassinate General de Gaulle, in which Jacques Soustelle was directly inv olved. The same Soustelle was the contact man for the Sendero Lumin osa-Shining Pathway guerilla group protecting the Committee's P eruvian cocaine producers. When all of the best that the assassination burea u could do had failed, thanks to the excellent work done by DG SE (French intelligence-formerly SDECE) the job was assigned t o MI6-Military Intelligence Department Six, and also known as Secr et Intelligence Service (SIS), under the code name \"Jackal.\" SDECE employed clever young graduates and was not infiltrated by M I6 or the KGB to any measurable extent. Its record in tracking do wn foreign agents made it the envy of the secret services of e very nation, and"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" 165 it was this group that followed \"Jackal\" to his fin al destination and then killed him before he could fire on General de Gaulle's motorcade. It was the SDECE who uncovered a Soviet mole in t he cabinet of De Gaulle, who also happened to be a lia ison man with the CIA in Langley. In order to discredit the SDECE , Allen Dulles, who hated De Gaulle, (the feeling was mutual) had o ne of its agents, Roger De Louette, caught with $12 million w orth of heroin in his possession. After a great deal of expert \"in terrogation,\" De Louette \"confessed\" but was unable to say why he wa s smuggling drugs into the United States. The whole thing stank to high heaven of a set-up. Based upon an examination of SDECE methods in protecting De Gaulle, especially in motorcades, the FBI, Secret Service and the CIA knew exactly how to strip Presi dent Kennedy of his security and make it easy for the three PERM INDEX shooters to murder him in Dealey Plaza in November 1963. Another example of FACT disguised as fiction is t he Leon Uris novel, \"TOPAZ.\" In \"TOPAZ\" we find a factual a ccount of the activities of Thyraud de Vosjoli, the very KGB agent uncovered by SDECE and denounced as the KGB's liaison man with t he CIA. There are many fictionalized accounts of the MOSSAD 's activities, nearly all of which are based on fact. The MOSSAD is also known as \"The Institute.\" Many would- be writers make nonsensical statements about it, es pecially one writer who is much in favor with the Christian righ t wing, which is accepted as truth. One can pardon the offender beca use he has no intelligence training, but that does not stop him f rom dropping \"Mossad names\" all over the place. Such disinformation exercises are routinely run a gainst American right wing patriotic groups. Originally th e MOSSAD consisted of 3 groups, the Bureau of Military Intel ligence, the Political Department of the Foreign Office and the Department of Security (Sherut Habitachon). David Ben Gurion, a m ember of the Committee of 300, received some considerable help f rom MI6 in putting it together."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" 166 But it was not a success, and in 1951 Sir William Stephenson of MI6 restructured it into a single uni t as arm of the Political Department of the Israeli Foreign Office, with a special operations group for espionage and \"black job\" opera tions. British intelligence gave further assistance in training an d equipping for servicing the Sarayet Maktal, also known as the Gen eral Staff Reconnaissance unit, in the format of Britain's Spe cial Air Service (SAS). This service unit of the MOSSAD is never men tioned by name and is known simply as \"The Guys.\" \"The Guys\" are merely an extension of British int elligence's SAS unit who continually train and update them in n ew methods. It was \"The Guys\" who killed the leaders of the P.L .0. and kidnaped Adolph Eichmann. \"The Guys\" and indeed ALL MOSSAD agents, operate on a war-time footing. The MOSSAD h as a tremendous advantage over other intelligence servic es in that every country in the world has a large Jewish commu nity. By studying social and criminal records, the MOSS AD is able to pick agents among local Jews it can have a hold over AND MAKE THEM WORK FOR IT WITHOUT PAY. The MOSSAD also has the advantage of having access to the records of al l U.S. law enforcement agencies and U.S. intelligence services The Office of Naval Intelligence (OM) ELINT services the Mossad a t no cost to Israel. Citizens of the United States would be shoc ked, angered and dismayed if ever it was discovered just how much the MOSSAD knows about the lives of millions of America ns in every walk of life, even those who are not political in a ny way.

The MOSSAD has a skillful disinformation serv ice. The amount of disinformation it feeds to the American \" market\" is embarrassing, but even more embarrassing is how it is swallowed hook, line and sinker and all. What we are actually witnessing in the microcosm of the MOSSAD is the extent of control exercised by the \"O lympians\" over the intelligence services, entertainment, publishin g, opinion-"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" 167 making (polls) and the television \"news\" media on a global scale. Ted Turner was recently given a seat on the Committ ee of 300 in recognition for his \"news\" (making) CNN broadcasts. The Committee has the power and the means to tell the p eople of this world ANYTHING, and it will be believed by the vast majority, On every occasion that a researcher happens upon this astounding central control group, he is either succ essfully bought off, or else he undergoes some \"speciality training \" at the Tavistock Institute after which he becomes a contri butor to more fiction, of the James Bond type, i.e., he is derail ed and well rewarded. If such a person as John F. Kennedy shoul d stumble onto the truth about who directs world events, and cannot be bought, he is assassinated. In the case of John F. Kennedy, the assassination was carried out with great attendant publicity and with the utmost brutality to serve as a warning to world leaders no t to get out of line. Pope John Paul I was quietly murdered because he was getting close to the Committee of 300 through Freem asons in the Vatican hierarchy. His successor, Pope John Paul 11 , was publicly humiliated as a warning to cease and desist—which h e has done. As we shall see, certain Vatican leaders are today seated on the Committee of 300. It is easy to put serious researcher off track of the Committee of 300 because Britain's MI6 (SAS) promot es a wide variety of kookery such as the New Age, Yogaism, Ze n Buddhism, Witchcraft, Delphic Priesthood of Apollo (Aristotle was a member) and hundreds of small \"cults\" of all kinds. A group of \"retired\" British intelligence agents who stayed on the track labeled the conspirators'hierarchy \"Force X,\" and declared that it possesses a super-intelligence service that has corrupted the K GB, the Vatican Intelligence, the CIA, the ONI, DGSE, U.S. military intelligence, the State Department intelligence service and even the most secret of all U.S. intelligence agencies, the Office of Natio nal Reconnaissance. The existence of the National Reconnaissance Offi ce (NRO) was known to only a handful of people outside of th e Committee of 300, until Truman stumbled upon it quite by acci dent. Churchill"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" 168 had a hand in setting up the NRO and he was reporte dly livid when Truman discovered its existence. Churchill mor e than any other servant of the Committee of 300, considered T ruman His- Little-Man from independence \"without an independen ce at all.\" This referred to Truman's every move being controll ed by Freemasonry. Even today, NRO's annual budget is not known to the Congress of the United States, and it is respon sible to only a selected few in Congress. But it is a creature of t he Committee of 300 to whom its reports are routinely sent every fe w hours. Thus the fictionalized spoofs one sees about the various branches and arms of control of the Committee were designed to take suspicion away from the real thing, but we sho uld never doubt that the real thing does indeed exist. Take a nother example of what I mean, the book \"THE DAY OF THE JACKAL,\" f rom which a highly successful movie was created. The events related in the book are factual. Altho ugh for obvious reasons the names of some of the players an d the locales were changed, but the thrust of the story, that a s ingle MI6 operative was assigned to get rid of General Charle s De Gaulle, is absolutely correct. General De Gaulle had become un manageable, refusing to cooperate with the Committee-whose exis tence he knew very well since he had been invited to join it —came to a climax when De Gaulle withdrew France from NATO and immediately began building his own nuclear force—th e so-called \"force de frappe.\" This so angered the Committee that De Gaulle's assassination was ordered. But the French secret in telligence service was able to intercept \"Jackal's\" plans and keep De Gaulle safe. In the light of the record of MI6, which I mi ght add is the Committee of 300's main resource when it comes to i ntelligence, the work done by French intelligence borders on the miraculous. Military Intelligence Department Six dates back t o Sir Francis Walsingham, paymaster of Queen Elizabeth I for dirty tricks operations. Over hundreds of years, MI6 has established a record which no other intelligence agency can come near to duplicating.

Officially, MI6 does not exist, its budget comes out of the Queen's purse and \"private funds,\" and is reported to be in a range of $350-$500 million per annum, but no one kn ows for sure what the exact amount is. In its present form MI6 d ates back to 1911, when it was under the leadership of Sir Mansf ield Cumming, a captain in the Royal Navy, who was always identif ied by the letter \"C,\" from which \"M\" of James Bond fame is ta ken. No official record of MI6's failures and successe s exist—it is that secret, although the Burgess-Maclean-Blake-Blu nt disasters did great damage to the morale of MI6 officers. Unl ike other services, future members are recruited from univers ities and other areas of learning by highly skilled \"talent scouts\" as we saw in the case of Rhodes Scholars inducted into the Round Tab le. One of the requirements is an ability to speak foreign languag es. Candidates undergo a rigorous \"blooding.\" With the backing of such a formidable force, the Committee of 300 had little fear from ever being exposed, and this will go on for decades. What makes the Committee incredible is the incredible secrecy that prevails. None of the news media has ever made mention of this conspiratorial hierarchy; ther efore, as is to be expected, people doubt its existence. The Committee of 300 is for the most part under t he control of the British monarch, in this case, Eliza beth II. Queen Victoria is believed to have been quite paranoid ab out keeping it secret and went to great lengths to cover up MASONI C writings left at the scene of \"Jack the Ripper\" murders whic h alluded to the Committee of 300's connections with \"experiments\" c arried out by a family member who was also a highly-placed member of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. The Committee of 300 is filled with members of British aristocracy which has corporate interests and associates in every country of the world, including the USSR. The Committee's structure is as follows: "},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":" 170 The Tavistock Institute at Sussex University and London sites is owned and controlled by the Royal Institut e for International Affairs whose \"hofjuden\" in America is Henry Kissinger. The EAGLE STAR GROUP, which changed its name to the STAR GROUP after the close of the Second World War, is composed of a group of major international companie s involved in overlapping and interfaced areas (1) Insurance, (2) Banking, (3) Real Estate, (4) Entertainment, (5) High technology , including cybernetics, electronic communications, etc. Banking, while not the mainstay, is vitally impor tant, especially in the areas where banks act as clearing houses and money launderers of drug money.

For instance, in 1981 Harry Oppenheimer, chairman of the giant Anglo American C orporation that controls gold and diamond mining, sales and di stribution in the world, stated that he was about to launch into the North American banking market. Oppenheimer promptly inves ted $10 billion in a specially created vehicle for the purp ose of buying into big banks in the U.S., among which was Citicorp. Op penheimer's investment vehicle was called Minorco, which set up shop in Bermuda, a British royal family preserve. On the bo ard of Minorco was to be found Walter Wriston of Citicorp and Robe rt Clare, its chief counsel. The only other company to rival Oppenheimer in th e field of precious metals and minerals was Consolidated Go ld Fields of South Africa, but Oppenheimer took control of it wi th a 28% stake the largest single stockholder. Thus gold, diamonds , platinum, titanium, tantalite, copper, iron ore, uranium and 52 other metals and minerals, many of them of absolutely vital stra tegic value to United States, passed into the hands of the Committ ee of 300. Thus was the vision of one of the earlier South A frican members of the Committee of 300, Cecil John Rhodes, fully realized, a vision which started with the spilling of the blood of thousands upon thousands of White farmers and their families in South Africa, whom history records as the \"Boers.\" While the United States stood by with folded hands as did the rest of the world, this small nation was subjected to the most v icious war of genocide in history. The United States will be subj ected to the same treatment by the Committee of 300 when our tur n comes and it will not be long in coming. Insurance companies play a key role in the busine ss of the Committee of 300. Among these are found such top in surance companies as Assicurazioni Generali of Venice and R iunione Adriatica di Sicurta, the largest and second larges t insurance companies in the world, who keep their bank account s at Bank of International Settlements in Swiss gold francs.

The English companies controlled by the British r oyal family are Eagle Star, Prudential Assurance Company, the P rudential Insurance Company, which own and control most Ameri can insurers, including Allstate Insurance. At the head of the list is Eagle Star, probably the most powerful \"front\" for Military Intelligence Department Six (MI6). Eagle Star, alth ough nowhere near as large as Assicurazioni Generale, is perhaps equally important simply because it is owned by members of the Queen of England's family and, as titular head of the Commit tee of 300, Eagle Star makes a tremendous impact.

Actually, some o f them cannot be verified because the information comes st raight out of intelligence files, but with a lot of legwork, ther e are many sources which can verify at least part of the facts. The wo rk would involve a diligent search of Dun and Bradstreet Reference B ook of Corporations, Standard and Poors, British and Ameri can \"Who's Who\" with long hours of hard work in crossreferenci ng names with their corporate affiliations.

The Committee is the ONLY organized power hierarchy in the world transcending all governments and individuals, howev er powerful and secure they may feel themselves to be. This cov ers finance, defense matters and political parties of all colors and types. "},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" 175 There is no entity the Committee cannot reach and control, and that includes organized religions of the world. This then, is the all powerful OLYMPIAN GROUP whose power base is in London and the City of London's financial centers with its grip on minerals, metals and precious gems, cocaine, opium and pharma ceutical drugs, rentier-financier bankers, cult promoters an d founders of rock music. The British Crown is the control point from which all things radiate. As the saying goes, \"They have a fi nger in every pie.\" It is obvious that the communications field is ti ghtly controlled. Going back to RCA, we find that its dir ectorate is composed of British-American establishment figures who feature prominently in other organizations such as the CFR, NATO, the Club of Rome, the Trilateral Commission, Freemasonr y, Skull and Bones, Bilderbergers, Round Table, Milner Society a nd the Jesuits- Aristotle Society. Among them was David Sarnoff who moved to London at the same time Sir William Stephenson move d into the RCA building in New York. All three major television networks came as spinof fs from RCA, especially the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC) which was first, closely followed by the American Broadca sting Company (ABC) in 1951. The third big television network was Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) which, like its sister co mpanies was, and still is, dominated by British intelligence. Wi lliam Paley was trained in mass brainwashing techniques at the Tavi stock Institute prior to being passed as qualified to head CBS. Thus, if we the people of the United States but k new it, all our major television networks are subject to British oversight, and information they provide first goes to London for c learance. It is interesting to note that the Tavistock intelligence paper written by Stanford Research Institute, commonly named \"The Aq uarian Conspiracy\" was funded by donations from all three major television networks. All three major networks are represented on the Co mmittee of 300 and are affiliated with the giant of the mas s communication business, the Xerox Corporation of Rochester, New Y ork, whose Robert M. Beck holds a seat on the Committee. Beck is also a"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":" 176 director of the Prudential Life Insurance Company, which is a subsidiary of the London Prudential Assurance Compa ny Limited. Others on the board of Xerox are Howard Clark of t he American Express Company, one of the main conduits for moving drug money through \"travelers checks,\" former Secre tary of the Treasury, William Simon, and Sol Linowitz, who nego tiated the Panama Canal Treaties for the Committee. Linowitz i s important to the Committee by virtue of his long standing expert ise in laundering drug money through Marine Midland and th e Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. Another Xerox board member is Robert Sproull, who is of real interest because, as president of the Universi ty of Rochester, he allowed the Tavistock Institute, working through the CIA, to use the university's facilities for the 20-year MK- Ultra LSD experiments. Some 85 other universities in the U.S. also allowed their facilities to be misused in this manner. As g iant-sized as Xerox is, it is dwarfed by the Rank Organization, a Londonbased conglomerate fully controlled by members of Queen E lizabeth's immediate family. Notable members of the board of Rank Organization who are also members of the Committee of 300 are the fo llowing: Lord Helsby, chairman of the drug money clearing house, Midland Bank. Helsby's other positions include a di rectorship in the giant Imperial Group and the Industrial and Commerc ial Finance Corporation. Sir Arnold France, a director of Tube Investments who runs the London underground train service. France is als o a director of the BANK OF ENGLAND which has so much control over the Federal Reserve Banks. Sir Dennis Mountain, chairman of the mighty Eagle Star group and a director of English Property Corp, one of the rentier- financier companies of the British royal family.

At stake was Rhodesia's chrome mines which produce the finest high-grade chrome ore in the world.

Note how many of t hese powerful men are directors of the Bank of England which make s control of American fiscal policies simple. Many of these organizations and institutions, com panies and banks are so interfaced and interlocked as to m ake it an almost impossible task to sort them out. On RCA's b oard sits Thornton Bradshaw, president of Atlantic Richfield and a member of NATO, World Wildlife Fund, the Club of Rome, The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, the Council on Fo reign Relations. Bradshaw is also chairman of NBC. The most importan t function of RCA remains its service to British intelligence. It is not generally known how powerful was the ro le played by the Committee of 300 in stopping the investigati on into the CIA which Senator McCarthy almost succeeded in pulling off. Had"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" 178 McCarthy been successful, it is very likely that Pr esident John F. Kennedy would be alive today. When McCarthy said he was going to summon William Bundy to appear before his commission of enquiry, p anic swept Washington and London. Bundy, had he been called to testify, would most probably have cracked and opened the doo r to the \"special relations\" that existed between British ol igarchical circles and their cousins in the United States Government. Such a possibility could not be entertained. The Royal Insititute of International Affairs was called in t o put an end to McCarthy. The RIIA chose Allen Dulles, a man who wa s totally enamored of decadent British society, to attack McC arthy head on. Dulles put Patrick Lyman and Richard Helms in charg e of the McCarthy case. Helms was later rewarded for his ser vice against McCarthy by being made head of the CIA. General Mark Clark, a member of the CFR and a wel l-liked military man in London circles, was appointed by Ge neral Eisenhower to turn back McCarthy's full-fledged att ack on the CIA. McCarthy was preempted when Clark announced that a special committee was to be appointed to examine the agency . Clark, on instructions from the RIIA, recommended a Congressi onal watchdog committee to \"periodically examine the wor k of government intelligence agencies.\" The whole thing was a super tragedy for America and a victory for the British, who feared that McCarthy would accidentally stumble onto the Commit tee of 300 and its control over every aspect of United States affairs. Lehman Brothers-Kuhn Loeb's former chairman, Pete r G.Peterson, served under former MI6 chief Sir Willi am Wiseman and as such was no stranger to British royalty. Pet erson is tied in with Aspen Institute, yet another arm of British in telligence. John R. Petty is president and chairman of the Ma rine Midland Bank—a bank whose drug trade connections ha ve been well established long before it was taken over by t he Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, probably the number one bank in the opium trade, a position it has held since 1814. "},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" 179 But the best proof I can offer of the existence o f the Committee of 300 is the Rank Organization which, in conjunction with Eagle Star, IS THE BRITISH CROWN. It is also t he black operations center of MI6 (SIS). Between them, these two Committee of 300 companies control Her Majesty's Do minion of Canada, using the \"hofjuden\" Bronfman family to carr y out their orders. Trizec Holdings, ostensibly owned by the Bronfman family, is in reality the main asset of the Queen of Englan d's in Canada. The entire Southeast Asian opium trade interfaces w ith the Bronfman empire and is one of the means whereby her oin is brought to America. In a sense, Canada is like Swit zerland pristine snow-covered landscapes, big cities, a place of gre at beauty, but underneath lies a deep layer of filth and dirt aris ing from its massive heroin trade. The Bronfman family are \"cut-outs\"'what is known in MI6 as \"front men\" controlled from London by MI6 \"desk men,\" intelligence jargon for controllers at headquarters. Edgar Bronfman, the family leader, was sent to \"Moscow Center\"-cove r name for the KGB headquarters at 2 Dzerzhinsky Square, Mosco w, on a large number of occasions. At a low level, Bronfman was probably very useful as a contact man with Moscow. Bronfman was never at any stage a contract agent for MI6 and so never carried the tit le \"Paroles,\" a key intelligence word for mutual identification bet ween agents, which greatly disappointed the eager Bronfman famil y head. At one stage when it was thought that some of the fami ly were acting suspiciously, \"watchers\"—intelligence jargon for intelligence officers keeping persons under surveillance, were p ut on the Bronfman family, but found only that one of the Bro nfmans had been bragging to a United States \"cousin\" (the word MI6 uses for the C.I.A.) who was unaware of the role of Edgar Br onfman. This was quickly corrected. Two Eagle Star directors, who were also the two t op MI6 operatives, took control of the Bronfman family abo ut six months after the war ended.

Drugs, dirty money laundering, crim e and racketeering are all covered by their infamous Act. Not known to many is that, if charged under the O fficial Secrets Act, which can be interpreted any way the C rown agents choose, persons could face the death penalty. As I have said so many times since 1980, Canada is not a nation like South Africa, or Holland or Belgium; it always was, and remains tied to the Queen of England's apron strings. Canada, we find, is alw ays first in carrying out Queen Elizabeth's wishes. Canadian tro ops have fought in every one of Her Majesty's wars, including the Boer War ( 18991903). Like its American counterpart, the Canadian Insti tute of International Affairs is a child of the Royal Insti tute for International Affairs (RIIA) and runs Canadian poli tics. Its members have filled the position of Secretary of St ate ever since it was founded in 1925. The Institute for Pacific Rela tions, the body that fostered the attack on Pearl Harbor, was welco med in Canada after Owen Lattimore and his fellow members had the ir treasonous activities exposed in 1947 and left the United Stat es before they could be charged. The Canadian Institute for International Affairs is connected with the Rank Organization through Sir Ke nneth Strong, who was second in charge of MI6 at the end of the S econd World War. As a member of the Order of St. John of Jerusa lem, Strong is the number two man in Canada for Rank and the Briti sh Crown's commercial interests. He is on the board of one of the most prolific drug banks in the world after the Hong Kong and Sha nghai Bank, the Bank of Nova Scotia, through which proceeds of the Canadian heroin trade are handled. First in line is Sir Brian Edward Mountain, the r anking member of the Knights of the Order of St. John of J erusalem. It is"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" 181 well to remember that, when the British Crown wante d the United States to enter the Second World War, it sent Lord Beaverbrook and Sir Brian Mountain to meet with President Roose velt to deliver the Crown's orders in this regard.

This was done without t he knowledge and consent of the Congress. Another big name in the Rank-Canadian interfacing was Sir Kenneth Keith, a director of Canada's equivalent of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, the Bank of Nova Scotia, drippin g in drug money laundering. He was also on the board of Brita in's oldest and most venerable newspaper institution, the Londo n Times and the Sunday Times. For over 100 years the \"Times\" ha s been the Crown's voice on foreign affairs, finance matters a nd political life in England. Like so many Committee of 300 members, Sir Kennet h circulated between MI6 and the opium supply chain o f command in Hong Kong and China, ostensibly on business for the Canadian Institute for International Affairs, of which he wa s a member Furthermore, as a director of the Hill Samuel banki ng house, his presence in China and Hong Kong could be explained without any problem. One of his closest associates outside of M I6 circles was Sir Philip de Zuleta, the Committee of 300's direct controller of all British prime ministers, both Conservative and Labo r. Sir Kenneth Strong tied in all the spokes of the drug wheel, in cluding terrorism, production of opium, the gold markets, dirty money laundering and banking to its central core, the British Crown. At the top of British Crown control of Canada was Walter Gordon. A former member of the Queen's hands-on ove rsight committee, also known as the Privy Council, Gordon sponsored the Institute for Pacific Relations via the Canadian In stitute of International Affairs. As a former minister of fina nce, Gordon was able to place Committee of 300 selected accountants and lawyers inside the three main chartered banks: the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Canadian Imperial Bank and the Toronto Dominion Bank.

Before his death, Gord on controlled James Endicott, Chester Ronning and Paul Linn, iden tified by MI6 as Canada's top \"China specialists.\" All three men worked closely with Chou-En-lai, who once told Gamal Abdul Nasser that he would do to Britain and the USA what they had done to China, i.e., turn them into nations of heroin addicts. Chou-En-l ai made good on his promise, starting with American GI's in Viet nam. Other close collaborators in the Canadian heroin drug ring were John D. Gilmer and John Robert Nicholson, both members of the Orde r of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. Lord Hartley Shawcross, who is believed to report directly to Queen Elizabeth II, was on the board of the Roya l Institute for International Affairs and chancellor of Sussex Univ ersity where the notorious Tavistock Institute for Human Relations i s located, with extensive connections in Canada. As part of Rank's United States operation, no oth er single company has been more successful for Rank than the Corning Group, owners of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co mpany and the New York Life Insurance Company. Committee of 3 00 members, Amory Houghton and his brother James Hough ton, have long served the British Crown through the above nam ed insurance companies, and Corning Glass, Dow Corning and Corni ng International.

What is important to note is how this American co mpany, one of HUNDREDS, is interfaced with British intelli gence, with Canada, the Far East and South Africa, not to menti on its gridding of corporate officials and directors reaching into every aspect of business and politics in the United States. While Metropolitan Life Insurance Company does no t begin to compare with the Committee of 300's giant Assicu razioni Generale, it is nevertheless a good indicator of ho w the Houghtons'power extends right across the business s pectrum of the U.S. and Canada.

Reliance Group is a spinoff of the parent company whose function it is to brainwash the American people thr ough a network of pollsters and opinion makers and relies on Opera tions Research for direct links with the Tavistock Institute. Anot her associate company is Leasco, which is closely interfaced with AT&T, Disclosure Incorporated, Western Union Internationa l, Imbucon Ltd and Yankelovich, Skelly and White. Daniel Yankelovich is the emperor of the polling- opinion making corporate structure in the United States, a vast apparatus which provides \"public opinions on social, economic and political matters of substance,\" to quote Edward Bernays. It was this vast apparatus that turned the majority of Americans, who had never even heard of Saddam Hussein and vaguely knew that Iraq was a country somewhere in the Middle East, into a people howling for his blood and the extermination of Iraq as a nation . Yankelovich utilized to the full all knowledge ga ined during the Second World War.

This technique is, of course, standard training for cert ain intelligence groups, which includes the CIA. Yankelovich's task was to destroy traditional Ame rican values and replace them with New Age-Age of Aquariu s values. As the Committee of 300's most senior public opinion m aker, no one can doubt that Yankelovich has done a superb job. Probably the best way to explain what methods are used and what results are expected to be achieved is to quote John Naisbitt's work as explained in his \"Trend Report.\" Naisbitt has acted as advisor to Lyndon Johnson, Eastman Kodak, IBM, America Express, the Center for Policy Study, Chase Manhattan, General Motors, Louis Harris Polls, the White House , Institute of Life Insurance, the American Red Cross, Mobil Oil, B.P. and a host of Committee of 300 companies and institutions. His methodology, derived from MI6 Tavistock procedures, is of course not unique: \"I will briefly outline our methodology. In devel oping Trend Report for our clients we rely mostly on a system o f monitoring local events and behavior. We are overwhelmingly im pressed with the extent to which this is a bottom-up society, so we monitor what is going on locally, rather than what is going on in Washington or New York. Things start in Los Angeles , in Tampa, in Hartford, in Wichita, Portland, San Diego and Denve r. It is a very much 'from the bottom-up' society. \"The tracking concept employed in determining the se trends has its roots in WW II. During the war, inte lligence experts sought to find a method for obtaining information o n enemy nations that public opinion polls would normally ha ve provided. Under the leadership of Paul Lazarsfeld and Harold Laswell, a method was developed for monitoring what was going on in these societies that involved doing a content analysis of the daily press. \"Although this method of monitoring public thinki ng continues to be the choice of the intelligence comm unity the nation annually spends millions of dollars doing ne wspaper content analyses in all parts of the world.... The reason t his system of monitoring changes in society works so well is that 'news holes' in"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" 186 newspapers is a closed system. For economic reasons the amount of space devoted to news in a newspaper doesn't cha nge over time. \"So when something new is introduced into that ne ws hole, something or a combination of things has to go out or be omitted. The principle involved here is classified as a forc ed choice within a closed system. In this forced situation societies a dd new preoccupations and forget old ones. We keep track o f the ones that are added and the ones that are given up. \"Evidently, societies are like human beings. I do not know what the number is, but a person can only keep so m any problems and concerns in his head at any one time. If new pr oblems or concerns are added, some existing ones must be give n up. We keep track of what Americans have given up and have taken up. \"The United States is rapidly shifting from a mas s industrial society to an information society and the final imp act will be more profound than the 19th century shift from an agricu ltural to an industrial society. Starting in 1979, the number on e occupation in the U.S. became clerking, replacing laborer and far mer. In this latter statement is a brief history of the United S tates.\" It is not by chance that Naisbitt is a member of the Club of Rome and, as such, a \"senior staffer\" of the Commit tee of 300. He is also one of the senior vice presidents of Yankel ovich, Skelly and White. What Naisbitt is doing is not forecasting tr ends but MAKING them. We have seen how the industrial base of the U nited States has been destroyed, starting with the steel industr y. In 1982 I wrote a work I called \"Death of the Steel Industry, \" in which I stated that by the mid-1990's, steel production in the U.S. will have declined to a point of no return, and that the auto and housing industries would go the same way. All this has come to pass, and what we are witnes sing today is not an economic recession due not only to unsound economic policies, but the deliberately planned des truction of our industrial base—and along with it the destruction o f America's unique middle class—the backbone of the country—whi ch depends"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" 187 on a progressive industrial expansion for growth an d for steady employment. This is one of the reasons why the recession, whi ch started in earnest in January of 1991, has turned into a de pression from which the United States as we knew it in the 1960's -1970's will most probably never reappear. The economy will not come out of the depression of 1991 until at least 19951996, at which time the United States will have become an entirely differen t society from the one it when the recession began. Opinion makers have played no small part in this war on the United States; we need to examine the role of t he Committee of 300 in bringing about these far-reaching changes and how the social engineers have used central systems analyses to keep public opinion from expressing anything other than the pol icies of the invisible government. How and where did it all begi n? From documents covering the First World War that I was able to gather and examine in the War Office in Whi tehall, London, it appears that the Royal Institute for Internation al Affairs was commissioned by the Committee of 300 to do a study of manipulating war information. This task was given t o Lord Northcliffe and Lord Rothmere and Arnold Toynbee, w ho was MI6's agent at the RIIA. Lord Rothmere's family own ed a newspaper which was used to support various governm ent positions, so it was thought that the paper could c hange public perceptions, especially among the ranks of growing opposition to the war. The project was housed in Wellington House, named after the Duke of Wellesly. American specialists drafted to help Lords Rothmere and Northcliffe included Edward Bernays an d Walter Lippman. The group held \"brain storming\" sessions t o work out techniques for mobilizing mass support for the war, especially among the working class people whose sons were expe cted to go to the slaughter fields of Flanders in record numbe rs. Using Lord Rothmere's newspaper, new manipulative techniques were tried out and, after a period of ab out 6 months, it was apparent that they were a success. What the res earchers"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 188 discovered was that only a very small group of peop le understood the process of reasoning and the ability to observe the problem as opposed to passing an opinion on it. This, said Lor d Rothmere, was the way in which 87% of the British public appr oached the war, and that the same principle applied not only t o the war, but to every conceivable problem in society in general. In this manner, irrationality was elevated to a h igh level of public consciousness. The manipulators then played upon this to undermine and distract the grasp of reality governi ng any given situation and, the more complex the problems of a m odern industrial society became, the easier it became to bring greater and greater distractions to bear so that what we en ded up with was that the absolutely inconsequential opinions of masses of people, created by skilled manipulators, assumed th e position of scientific fact. Having literally stumbled upon so profound a conc lusion, the manipulators put it to one test after another d uring the war, so that in spite of hundreds of thousands of the youth of Britain being slaughtered on the battlefields of France, there wa s virtually no opposition to the bloody war. Records of the time s how that by 1917, just before the United States entered the war, 94% of the British working class bearing the brunt of the war did not have the faintest idea what they were fighting for, other th an the image created by the media manipulators that the Germans were a horrible race, bent upon destroying their monarch a nd their country, and who had to be wiped off the face of th e earth. Certainly nothing has changed because, in 1991, w e had the exact same situation created by the news media which allowed President Bush to flagrantly violate the Constituti on in waging a war of genocide against the nation of Iraq with the full consent of 87% of the American people. Woodrow Wilson can be c redited—if that is the proper expression to use—of jumping on t he public opinion manipulators' band wagon and using it to fu rther the causes whispered in his ear by his controller, Colo nel House.

The psychological warf are experiments perfected at Wellington House were used in the Second World War with equal success, and have been in continuous use in the massive psychological war aga inst the United States which began in 1946. The methods did not change, only the target. Now it was not German worker housi ng but the middle class of the United States that became the f ocus of the attack. As so often happens, the conspirators could not c ontain their glee. After WW II, in 1922 to be precise, Lip pmann detailed the work done by the RIIA in a book he called \"PUBL IC OPINION\": \"Public opinion deals with indirect, unseen and p uzzling facts, and there is nothing obvious about them. The situations to which public opinion refers are known only as opini ons, pictures inside heads of human beings, pictures of themselve s, of others, of their needs, purposes and relationships, are the ir public opinions. These pictures which are acted upon by gr oups of people, or by individuals acting in the name of groups are PUBLIC OPINION with capital letters. The picture inside th e head often misleads men in their dealings with the world outsi de of their heads.\" No wonder Lippmann was chosen to make the people of the United States \"like\" the Beatles when they arri ved on our shores and were thrust upon an unsuspecting country . Combined with the propaganda sent forth night and day from r adio and television it was only a comparatively short time b efore The Beatles became \"popular.\" The technique of radio st ations allegedly receiving hundreds of requests from imagi ng listeners for Beatlemusic, led to charts and ratings for first, t he \"top ten\" and gradually escalated until, by 1992, it has expanded to \"the top 40 on the charts.\" In 1928, Lippmann's compatriot Edward Bernays wro te a book called \"CRYSTALLIZING PUBLIC OPINION\" and in 1 928 a second book of his was published entitled simply \"P ROPAGANDA.\" In it Bernays described his experiences at Wellingt on House.

Wells claimed that any nation could be defeated, not by direct confrontation but by understanding the human mind—what he called, \"the m ental hinterlands hidden behind the persona.\" With such a powerful backer, Bernays felt confide nt enough to launch his \"PROPAGANDA\": \"As civilization becomes more complex, AND AS THE NEED FOR INVISIBLE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY DEMONSTRATED (emphasis added-JC), the technical mea ns have been invented and developed BY WHICH PUBLIC OPINION MAY BE REGIMENTED (emphasis added-JC). With printing pr ess and newspaper, the telephone, telegraph, radio and airp lanes, ideas can be spread rapidly, and even instantaneously, ac ross the whole of America.\" Bernays had not yet seen how much bett er television, which was to follow, would do the job. \"The conscious and intelligent manipulation of or ganized habits and opinions of the masses is an important e lement in a democratic society. Those who manipulate this unsee n mechanism of society constitute an INVISIBLE GOVERNMENT WHICH IS THE"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" 191 TRUE RULING POWER IN OUR COUNTRY.\" To back up his p osition, Bernays quoted H. G. Wells' article published in th e New York Times in which Wells enthusiastically backed the id ea of modern means of communication \"opening up a new world of p olitical processes which will allow the common design to be documented and sustained against perversion and betrayal\" (of the invisible government). To continue with the revelations contained in \"PROPAGANDA\": \"We are governed, our minds are moulded, our tast es formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. What ever attitude one chooses to take toward t his condition, it remains a fact that in almost every act of our dail y lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, our social c onduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by a relatively small number of persons, a trifling fraction of our hundred and twe nty million, who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind, and who harness old social forces and contrive new ways TO BIND AND GUIDE THE WORLD\" (emphasis added-JC). Bernays was not bold enough to tell the world who the \"THEY\" are who \"pull the wires which control the pu blic mind...,\" but in this book we shall make up for his intention al oversight by disclosing the existence of that \"relatively small number of persons,\" the Committee of 300. Bernays was roundly applauded for his work by the CFR whose members voted to plac e him in charge of CBS. William Paley became his \"undergradu ate\" and eventually replaced Bernays, having acquired thorou gh knowledge of the new-science science of public opinion making , which made CBS the leader of the field, a role which CBS telev ision and radio has never relinquished. Political and financial con trol by the \"relatively small number,\" as Bernays called them, is exercised through a number of secret societies, most notably the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, and perhaps even more importan tly, through the Venerable Order of the Knights of St. John of J erusalem, an ancient order consisting of the British monarch's h and-picked executives chosen for their expertise in areas vita l to the continued control of the Committee."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 192 In my work \"The Order of St. John of Jerusalem\" p ublished in 1986, I described The Order in the following man ner: \"...It is therefore not a secret society, except where its purposes have been perverted in the inner councils like the Order of the Garter, which is a prostituted oligarchical creation of the British royal family, which makes a mockery of what the Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem stands for. \"As an example, we find the atheist Lord Peter Ca rrington, who pretends to be an Anglican Christian but who is a member of the Order of Osiris and other demonic sects, includ ing Freemasonry, installed as a Knight of the Garter at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, by Her Majesty, Queen Eliza beth II of England, of the Black Nobility Guelphs, also head o f the Anglican Church, which she thoroughly despises.\" Carrington was selected by the Committee of 300 t o bring down the government of Rhodesia, sign over the mine ral wealth of Angola and South West Africa to City of London cont rol, wreck the Argentine and turn NATO into a leftwing political o rganization beholden to the Committee of 300. Another strange face we see attaching itself to t he Holy Christian Order of St. John of Jerusalem, and I use the word stranger as it is used in the original Hebrew of th e Old Testament to denote the lineage of an individual, is that of Major Louis Mortimer Bloomfield, the man who helped plan the mu rder of John F.

We have been so brainwashed that we believe the B ritish royal family is just a nice, harmless and colorful i nstitution, and fail to realize just how corrupt and therefore highly dan gerous is this institution called the British Monarchy. The Knight s of the Order of the Garter are the INNERMOST circle of the most cor rupt public servants who have utterly betrayed the trust placed in them by their nation, their people. "},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" 193 The Knights of the Order of the Garter are the le aders of the Committee of 300, Queen Elizabeth II's most tru sted \"privy council.\" When I did my research on the Order of St .

He told me that the Knights of the Gart er are the inner sanctum, the elite of the elite of Her Majesty's Mos t Venerable Order of St. John of Jerusalem. Let me say this is not the original order founded by the true Christian warrior, Peter Gerard, but is typical of many fine institutions that are taken ov er and destroyed from the inside, while yet appearing to the uniniti ated to be the original. From Oxford I went to the Victoria and Albert Mus eum and gained access to the papers of Lord Palmerston, one of the founders of the Opium Dynasty in China. Palmerston, like so many of his kind, was not only a Freemason, but a dedica ted servant of Gnosticism.... Like the present 'royal family,' Pal merston made a pretense of being a Christian but was in fact a ser vant of Satan. Many satanists became leaders of British aristocrac y and made immense fortunes out of the China opium trade. I learned from the papers in the museum named aft er Victoria that she changed the name of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem in 1885 in order to break away from the C atholic connection of the Order's founder, Peter Gerard, an d renamed it the \"Protestant Most Venerable Order of Jerusalem.\" Membership was open to every oligarchical family that had made its fortune in the China opium trade and every thoroughly decadent family received place in the 'new order.' Many of these venerable gentlemen were responsibl e for overseeing the prohibition era in the United States from Canada, where several of its members supplied the whisky fe rried to the United States. Notable among this group was Committ ee of 300 member Earl Haig, who gave his whisky franchise to old Joe Kennedy.

Anyone who dares to try and show proof of Jewish co ntrol of Canada (which the Bronfmans exercise), is immediate ly arrested and charged with so-called \"hate crimes.\" This will give us some idea of the vastness of the reach of the Committee of 300 which quite literally sits on top of everything n this wo rld. Testifying to the truth of this statement is the fact that the Committee of 300 set up the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) under the auspices of the Round Tabl e. This institute is the vehicle for M16-Tavistock black pr opaganda and wet jobs (an intelligence cover name denoting an ope ration where bloodshed is required), nuclear and terrorist, whic h goes to the world's press for dissemination, as well as to gove rnment and military establishments.

The Mai Lai massacre story publis hed by Seymour Hersh came straight out of IISS, just in cas e we wrongly suppose that men like Hersh do their own research w ork. The International Institute for Strategic Studies is nothing more than a higher echelon opinion-maker as defined by Lippmann and Bernays. Instead of writing books, new spapers report opinions presented by chosen columnists, and IISS was formed to be a coordinating center for not only cre ating opinions, but to get those opinions and scenarios out much fa ster and to a greater audience than could be reached by a book, f or example. IISS is a good example of the gridding and interfac ing of Committee of 300 institutions. The idea of bringing IISS into being arose at the 1957 Bilderberger meeting. It will be recalled that the Bilderberger Conference is a creation of M16 under the direction of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. The idea came f rom Alastair Buchan, son of Lord Tweedsmuir.

Henry Kissinger. Robert Bowie, a former director of the ClA's Na tional Intelligence Estimates. Flowing from the 1957 Bilderberger meeting, Kissi nger was instructed to open a Round Table office in Manhatta n, the nucleus of which consisted of Haig, Ellsberg, Halperin, Sch lessinger, McNamara and the McBundy brothers. Kissinger was di rected to fill all executive positions in the Nixon administration with Round Tablers, loyal to the RIIA and therefore to the Que en of England. It was no accident that Kissinger chose President N ixon's old hangout, the Hotel Pierre, as his center of operati ons. The significance of the Round Table-Kissinger ope ration was thus: On orders of the RIIA chairman Andrew Sch oeberg, a block was placed on all agencies involved in intell igence, preventing them from giving information to Presiden t Nixon. This meant Kissinger and his staff were getting ALL INTE LLIGENCE, FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC, LAW ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION, INCLUDING FBI DIVISION 5, before any of it was rele ased to the President. This made certain that all M16-controlle d terrorist operations in the U.S. would have no chance of bein g leaked. This was Halperin's bailiwick. By working this methodology, Kissinger at once es tablished hegemony over the Nixon presidency, and after Nixon was disgraced by the Kissinger group and hounded from o ffice, Kissinger emerged with unprecedented powers such as have not been equaled before or since Watergate. Some of the se seldom enumerated powers included the following: "},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" 197 Kissinger ordered National Security Decision Memo randum No. I to be drafted by Halperin, who got the actual wording directly from the RIIA through Round Table circles. The memorandum appointed Kissinger as the supreme U.S. authority, chairman of the Verification Panel. All SALT negoti ations were directed from here, using Paul Nitze, Paul Warnke a nd a nest of traitors inside the Arms Control mission at Geneva. In addition, Kissinger was appointed to The Vietn am Special Studies Group, which oversaw and made evalu ations of all reports, civilian and military, including intellige nce reports coming out of Vietnam. Kissinger also demanded and got ove rsight of the \"40 Committee,\" a super-secret agency that has the task of deciding when and where to initiate covert activiti es and then monitors the progress of operations it sets in moti on. Meantime Kissinger ordered a blizzard of wire-tap s by the FBI, even on his closest assistants, so as to give the impression that he was on top of everything. Most of his circl e were told that wiretaps on them were in force. This nearly backfir ed was an M16 operative by the name of Henry Brandon was ordered wiretapped, but was not informed by Kissinger. Brandon was doub ling as a reporter for the London Times and Kissinger very ne arly got thrown out because nobody does this to the London T imes. The full story of the Ellsberg break-in and the s ubsequent Watergating of Nixon is too long to be included her e. Suffice to say, Kissinger had control of Ellsberg from the day that Ellsberg was recruited while at Cambridge. Ellsberg had alwa ys been a hardliner in favor of the Vietnam War, but was grad ually \"converted\" to a radical leftist activist. His \"con version\" was only a shade less miraculous than St. Paul's Damascus Road experience. The entire spectrum of the new left in the United States was the work of British intelligence M16 acting thr ough Round Table assets and the Institute for Policy Studies ( IPS). Just as it did with all countries with a republican base, whos e policies had to be changed, LPS played a leading role, even as it d oes today in South Africa and South Korea. Much of IPS's activit ies are explained in my work \"IPS Revisited\" published in 1 990. "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" 198 IPS had one main function, that being to sow disc ord and spread disinformation resulting in chaos. One such program, aimed at America's youth, centered on drugs. Throug h a series of IPS fronts, acts like the stoning of Nixon's motorc ade and a large number of bombings, a climate of deception was effe ctively created which led a majority of Americans to believe that the United States was under threat from the KGB, the GR U and Cuban DGI. The word went out that a lot of these imaginar y agents had close ties to the Democrats through George McGovern . It was in fact, a model disinformation campaign for which M16 is justly famous. Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Nixon's closest aides ha d no clue as to what was happening, hence a flurry of st atements emanating from the White House that East Germany, T he Soviet Union, North Korea and Cuba were training terrorist s and funding their operations in the United States. I doubt whet her Nixon knew very much about IPS, let alone suspected what it wa s doing to his presidency. We suffered the same kind of disinforma tion during the Gulf War when the word went out that terrorists of all stripes were about to invade the United States and blow up everything in sight. President Nixon was literally left in the dark. H e didn't even know that David Young, a Kissinger pupil, was worki ng in the basement of the White House, supervising \"leaks.\" Y oung was a graduate of Oxford and a long-time Kissinger associ ate through Round Table assets such as the law firm of Milbank Tweed. President Nixon was no match for the forces arrayed against him under the direction of M16 on behalf of the Royal I nstitute for International Affairs and hence the British royal f amily. About the only thing that Nixon was guilty of, in so far as Watergate is concerned, was his ignorance of what w as going on all around him. When James McCord \"confessed\" to Ju dge John Sirica, Nixon should have been on to it like a flas h that McCord was playing a double game. He ought to have challen ged Kissinger about his relationship with McCord there and then. That would have thrown a spanner in the works and derailed the whole M16- Watergate operation. "},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":" 199 Nixon did not abuse his presidential powers. His crime was not defending the Constitution of the United States of America and not charging Mrs. Katherine Meyer Graham and Ben Br adley with conspiracy to commit insurrection. Mrs. Katherine M eyer Graham's pedigree is of the most doubtful kind, as \"Jessica Fletcher\" of \"Murder She Wrote\" would soon have discovered. But even knowing that, Mrs. Graham's controllers in the Roun d Table would have fought hard to keep the lid on things. The rol e of the Washington Post was to keep the pot boiling by one \"revelation\" after another, thereby engendering a climate of pub lic distrust of President Nixon, even when there was not one shred of evidence to support wrong doing by him. Yet it shows the immense power of the press, as L ippman and Bernays had quite properly anticipated, in that Mrs. Graham, long suspected of the murder of her husband, Philip L. Graham— officially classed as \"suicide\"—should have retaine d any credibility at all. Other traitors who should have been indicte d for insurrection and treason were Kissinger, Haig, Halp erin, Ellsberg, Young, McCord, Joseph Califano and Chomsky of IPS a nd those CIA operatives who went to McCord's house and burne d all of his papers. Again, it is worth repeating that Watergate , like many other operations we do not have the space to includ e here, demonstrated the COMPLETE CONTROL exercised over th e United States by the Committee of 300. While Nixon kept company with people like Earl Wa rren and some Mafia dons who had built Warren's house, that does not mean that he should have been disgraced over the Wa tergate Affair. My dislike of Nixon stems from his willingn ess to sign the infamous ABM Treaty in 1972 and his all-too-cozy re lationship with Leonid Brezhnev.

The Watergate plot was a coup-d'etat agai nst the United States of America, as was the murder of John F. Ken nedy. Although this fact is not recognized as such today, I am confident that when all the secret papers are finally opened, history will record that two coup-d'etats, one against Kennedy a nd one against Nixon, did indeed take place, and which in their wake brought the most violent rape and assault on the in stitutions upon which the Republic of the United States stands. The individual who most deserves the title of tra itor and who is most guilty of sedition is General Alexander Haig. This desk-man office-colonel whose paper-shuffling caree r did not include commanding any troops in battle, was sudden ly thrust upon the scene by the invisible upper-level paralle l government President Nixon once described him as a man who had to ask Kissinger's permission to go to the bathroom.

During Haig's \"promotion,\" and as a result of it, 25 senior generals were forced to resign. As a reward for his treachery toward President Nixon, AND THE UNITED STATES, Haig was subsequently given the plum job of Commanding Gener al of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces (NATO), a lthough he was THE LEAST QUALIFIED COMMANDER EVER TO HOLD THAT POSITION. Here again he was leap-frogged over 400 s enior generals from NATO countries and the United States. When the news of his appointment reached the Sovi et Armed Forces High Command, Marshall Orgakov recalle d his three top Warsaw Pact generals from Poland and East Germa ny, and there was much merrymaking, clinking of glasses and quaffing of champagne until well into the night. All through Ha ig's tenure as commander of NATO forces the professional elite cad re of the Soviet Armed Forces, men who have never been anythi ng else but professional soldiers, held Haig in the utmost cont empt and openly referred to him as the \"office manager of NATO.\" Th ey knew that Haig owed his appointment to the RIIA and not to th e United States military. But before his military promotion took him out of Washington, let it be known that Alexander Haig, in conjunction with Kissinger, all but destroyed the office of the President of the United States and its government. The chaos left by Kissinger and Haig in the wake of Watergate has never been chroni cled to the best of my knowledge. On the insistence of the RIIA , Haig virtually took over the management of the Government of the U nited States after the April 1973 coup d'etat.

The way President Nixon was first isolated, surro unded by traitors and then confused, followed to the letter the Tavistock method of gaining full control of a person accordin g to the methodology laid down by Tavistock's chief theoreti cian, Dr. Kurt Lewin. I have already given details of Lewin's meth odology elsewhere in this book, but in view of the text-boo k case of President Richard M.Nixon, I think it is worth repe ating: \"One of the main techniques for breaking morale t hrough a strategy of terror consists in exactly this tactic— keep the person hazy as to where he stands and just what he may expe ct. In addition, if frequent vacillations between severe d isciplinary measures and promises of good treatment together wi th the spreading of contradictory news, make the cognitive structure of this situation utterly unclear, then the individual may cease even to know a particular plan would lead toward or away from his goal. Under these conditions even those individuals who h ave definite goals and are ready to take risks are paralyzed by severe inner conflict in regard to what to do.\" Kissinger and Haig followed Tavistock training ma nuals to the letter. The result was a distraught, confused, frightened and demoralized President Nixon, whose only course of a ction—he was told by Haig—was to resign. In 1983 I wrote two wor ks, \"The Tavistock Institute: Sinister and Deadly\" and \"The Tavistock Institute: Britain's Control of U.S. Policy,\" based upon Tavistock secret manuals which had fallen into my hands. Tavi stock Institute's methods and actions are spelled out in these two works."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" 203 So successfully were Tavistock methods applied to unseat President Nixon that the people of this nation full y believed the calumny of lies, distortions and set-piece contrive d situations mounted by the conspirator as truth, when in fact W atergate was a diabolical lie from end to end. It is important t o stress this because we have certainly not seen the last of Wate rgate-type operations. What were the alleged impeachable offenses commit ted by President Nixon, and the so-called \"smoking gun\" ev idence which was supposed to back up the charges? First, the \"sm oking gun.\" This piece of FICTION was created by Kissinger and Haig around the June 23rd tape, which Haig coerced Nixon into s urrendering to Leon Jaworski. Haig spent hours convincing President Nixon that this tape would sink him, because it proved \"beyond any doubt \" that Nixon was guilty of serious wrong doing and a co-conspira tor in the Watergate break-in. President Nixon's first respons e was to tell Haig, \"It's utter nonsense to make such a big deal of this,\" but Haig chipped away until Nixon became convinced that he could not make a successful defense before the Senate, based solely on this particular June 23rd tape! How had Haig accomplished his mission? Acting out a scenario prepared for him by his Round Table contro llers, Haig had an unedited transcript of the \"smoking gun\" tape ty ped by his staff. In reality there was nothing in the tape that Presi dent Nixon could not have explained. Sensing this, Haig then circula ted his unauthorized unedited transcript of the tape among Nixon's staunchest supporters in the House and Senate and t he Republican Party high command. Peppered with \"smoki ng gun\" and \"devastating,\" and coming from Nixon's trusted aide, the transcript had the effect of a falcon hitting a flo ck of pigeons; Nixon's supporters panicked and ran for cover.

AS A RESULT OF HAIG'S SEDITIOUS, TREASONOUS ACTIVITIES, SENATOR GRIFFIN IMMEDIATELY WROTE A LETTER TO PRESIDENT NIXON CALLING UPON HIM TO RESIGN. THREE MONTHS EARLIER, Round Table controlled Insti tute for Policy Studies, child of James Warburg, founder and a fellow, Marcus Raskin, delivered EXACTLY the same ultimatum that President Nixon resign, using the British intellige nce propaganda journal, The New York Times of May 25th to deliver t he ultimatum. The Watergate tragedy was a step in the irreversibl e transition to barbarism which is enveloping the United States, an d which is leading us into the One World Government New World Order. The United States is now at the same place that Italy f ound itself when Aldo Moro tried to rescue it from created instabili ty. With what wrongdoing was Nixon charged? John Doar , whose brutish character was well-suited to his task of bringing so- called articles of impeachment against the presiden t, was the author and finisher of one of the most far-reaching ILLEGAL domestic surveillance counterintelligence operation s ever run in the United States. Heading the Interdepartmental Intelligence Unit ( IDIU), Doar garnered information from every conceivable ag ency of the federal government, including the Internal Revenue Service. The program was linked to the Institute for Policy Stud ies. One of the highlights of John Doar's career was to provide the CIA—which is forbidden by law to engage in domestic surveillance , with 10,000- 12,000 names of citizens he suspected as political dissidents, for further investigation. On July 18th, 1974, this great upholder of the la w, with measured pomposity, delivered the \"charges\" against President Nixon, which episode was nationally televised.

The United States was as unstable as it would ever be w hen President Nixon resigned on August 8th, 1974. Nowhere more so than in our economic and fiscal p olicies. In 1983 the international bankers met in Williamsbu rg, Virginia to work out a strategy to prepare the United States fo r a total disintegration of its banking system. This planned event was to stampede the U.S. Senate into accepting control of our monetary and fiscal policies by the International Monetary F und (IMF). Dennis Weatherstone of Morgan Guarantee on Wall Str eet stated that he was convinced this was the only way for the United States to save itself. The proposal was endorsed by the Ditchley Group w hich had its beginning in May of 1982 at Ditchley Park i n London. On January lOth-11th, l983, this alien group met in Wa shington D.C., in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the Clayton Act, and conspired to overthrow the sovereignty of the Unite d States of America in its monetary and financial freedom. The United States Attorney General knew of the meeting and its purpos e. Instead of charging members of the group with conspiracy to co mmit a federal crime, he simply looked the other way. Under the abovementioned acts, proof of a conspir acy is all that is needed for a felony conviction, and there w as ample evidence that a conspiracy did indeed take place. B ut as the Ditchley Foundation had met at the request of the R oyal Institute for International Affairs and was hosted by the Rou nd Table, no one in the Justice Department had the courage to ta ke action as required by those who had sworn to uphold the laws of the United States. The Ditchley Plan to usurp control of the fiscal and monetary policies of the United States was the brai nchild of Sir Harold Lever, a strong backer of Zionism and a clos e confidant of members of the British royal family and a member of the Committee of 300.

Lever's plan called for the IMF's influenc e to be broadened so that it could influence central banks of all nations, including the U.S. and guide them into the hands of a One World Government bank. This was considered a vital step in bringing abou t a situation where the IMF would become the supreme ar biter of world banking. The ultra-secret January meeting was preceded by an earlier meeting in October 1982, and was attende d by representatives of 36 of the world's top banks who met at the New York Vista Hotel. Security for the October 26th-27t h seminar was as tight as anything ever seen in the Big Apple. Th is earlier Ditchley Group meeting also violated United States law. Addressing the meeting, Sir Harold Lever said it was essential that national sovereignty as an archaic h ang-over must be ended before the year 2000. \"The United States w ill soon have to realize that it will be no better than any Third World country when the IMF takes control,\" said Sir Harold. It wa s later reported to the delegates that plans to appoint the IMF as t he controller of United States fiscal policies were being readied to bring before the United States Senate by the year 2000. Rimmer de Vries, speaking for Morgan Guarantee, s aid it was high time that the United States became a membe r of the Bank of International Settlements. \"There must be a reconsideration of U.S. hesitancy over the past 50 years,\" De Vries declared. Some British and German bankers, fearing possible violations of U.S. law, said that the Ditchley Grou p is nothing but a committee to iron out exchange rate problems. Felix Rohatyn also spoke of the great need to change U.S. banking laws so that the IMF could play a greater role in this country. Roha tyn headed Lazard Freres, a Club of Rome bank and part of the Eagle Star Group which we have already met. Round Tablers William Ogden and Werner Stang spok e enthusiastically in support of surrendering U.S. fi scal sovereignty to the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of International Settlements.

On January 8th, 1983, before their big meeting on January lOth-11th, Hans Vogel, a leading Club of Rome membe r, was received at the White House. President Ronald Reaga n had invited George Schultz, Caspar Weinberger, George Kennan an d Lane Kirkland to be present at his meeting with Vogel, w ho explained to President Reagan what the aims and objectives of the Ditchley Group were. From that day, President Reagan did an about face and worked with the Committee of 300's various agen cies to advance the International Monetary Fund and the Ban k of International Settlements as the authority on U.S d omestic and foreign monetary policies. The invisible government of the Committee of 300 has put tremendous pressure on America to change its ways—f or the worse. America is the last bastion of freedom and u nless our freedoms are taken away from us, progress toward a One World Government will be considerably slowed. Such an und ertaking as a One World Government is a massive one, requiring a great deal of skill, organizing abilities, control of governments and their policies. The only organization that could possibly have unde rtaken this mammoth task with any hope of success is the Commit tee of 300, and we have seen just how far it has come toward to tal success. Above all, the battle is a spiritual one. Unfortu nately, the Christian churches have become little more than soc ial clubs run by the infinitely evil World Council of Churches (W CC), whose beginnings lie not in Moscow but in the City of Lon don, as we see from the chart at the end of the book which gives t he structure of the One World Government Church. This body was set up in the 1920's to serve as a vehicle for One World Governme nt policies, and stands as a monument to the long-range planning capabilities of the Committee of 300. Another corrupt body similar in structure and des ign to the WCC is the Union of Concerned Scientists, set up by the Trilateral Commission, and funded by the Carnegie Endowment Fu nd, the Ford Foundation and Aspen Institute.

The United States SDI program was designed to cou nter the threat posed by Soviet Cosmospheres, a threat w hich still exists in spite of the assurances that \"communism i s dead.\" Soviet spokesman Georgi Arbatov told a meeting of the Unio n of Concerned Scientists that it is important for them to oppose the SDI program, because if the SDI program became oper ational, \"it will be a military catastrophe.\" Year after year th e Union of Concerned Scientists has opposed every budget which included funding for the vital SDI program, until by the end of 1991, there is not even enough money to fund further research s till required let alone place the system in orbit. The Union of C oncerned Scientists is run by the Royal Institute for Intern ational Affairs and is heavily infiltrated with M16 British intelligenc e agents. There is not one single aspect of life in America that is not watched over, steered in the \"right\" direction, man ipulated, and controlled by the invisible government of the Commi ttee of 300. There is not one elected official or political lead er that is not subject to its rule. No one thus far has got away wi th defying our secret rulers, who do not hesitate to make \"a horri ble example\" of anyone, including the President of the United State s of America. From 1776 when Jeremy Bentham and William Petty, the Earl of Shelburne, fresh from the triumph of the Fr ench Revolution which they planned and ran, were drafted by the Bri tish Crown to bring their combined experience to bear against the colonists, to 1812 when the British sacked and burned Washington, destroying secret documents that would have exposed the treaso n being worked against the young United States of America t o the Watergating of President Nixon and assassination of President Kennedy, the hand of the Committee of 300 is clearl y visible. This book is an attempt to open the eyes of the American people to this terrible truth: We are not an independent nation, n or can we ever be, as long as we are ruled by an invisible governm ent, the Committee of 300.

Hudson may be quite properly classified as one of the Committee of 300's BRAIN-W ASHING establishments.

NATIONAL TRAINING LABORATORIES NTL is also known as the International Institute for Applied Behavioral Sciences.

UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, WHARTON SCHOOL OF FINANCE & COMMERCE Founded by Eric Trist, one of the \"brain trusts\" of Tavistock, Wharton has become one of the more important Tavist ock institutions in the U.S. in so far as \"Behavioral R esearch\" is concerned. Wharton attracts clients such as the U.S . Department of Labor—which it teaches how to produce \"cooked\" s tatistics at the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates Inco rporated. This method is very much in demand as we come to th e close of 1991 with millions more out of work than is reflect ed in USDL statistics. Wharton's ECONOMETRIC MODELING is used by every major Committee of 300 company in the United States, Western Europe and by the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations and the World Bank. Wharton has produced su ch noteworthy persons as George Schultz and Alan Green span. INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH This is the institute set up by \"brain trusters\" from Tavistock Rensis Likert, Dorwin Cartwright and Rona ld Lippert. Among its studies are \"The Human Meaning of Social Change,\" \"Youth in Transition\" and \"How Americans View Their Mental Health.\" Among the institute's clients are The Ford Foundation, U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Postal Service and the U.S. Department of Justice. INSTITUTE FOR THE FUTURE This is not a typical Tavistock institution in th at it is funded by the Ford Foundation, yet it draws its long-range forecasting methodology from the mother of all think tanks. Ins titute for the Future projects what it believes to be changes that will be taking place in time frames of fifty years. The institute is supposed to be"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" 224 able to forecast socioeconomic trends and to blow t he whistle on any departures from what it has laid down as normal . Institute for the Future believes it is possible and normal to intervene now and give decisions for the future. So -called \"Delphi Panels\" decide what is normal and what is not, and prepare position papers to \"steer\" government in the right direction to head off such groups as \"people creating civil diso rder.\" (This could be patriotic groups demanding abolition of gr aduated taxes, or demanding that their right to bear arms is not i nfringed.) The institute recommends actions such as liberali zing abortion laws, drug usage and that cars entering an urban area pay tolls, teaching birth control in public schools , requiring registration of firearms, making the use of drugs a non-criminal offense, legalizing homosexuality, paying students for scholastic achievements, making zoning controls a preserve of the state, offering bonuses for family planning and last, but by no means least, a Pol Pot Cambodia-style proposal that new c ommunities be established in rural areas. As will be observed, ma ny of the Institute for the Future's goals have already been more than fully realized. INSTITUTE FOR POLICY STUDIES (IPS) One of the \"Big Three,\" IPS has shaped and reshap ed United States policies, foreign and domestic, since it was founded by James P. Warburg and the Rothschild entities in the United States, bolstered by Bertrand Russell and the Briti sh Socialists through its networks in America which include the L eague for Industrial democracy in which Leonard Woodcock play ed a leading, if behind-the-scenes role. Local lead players in th e League for Industrial Democracy included \"conservative\" Jeane Kirkpatrick, Irwin Suall (of the ADL), Eugene Rostow (Arms Contr ol negotiator), Lane Kirkland (Labor leader), and Albert Shanker. For record purposes only, IPS was incorporated in 1963 by Marcus Raskin and Richard Barnett, both highly-trai ned Tavistock Institute graduates. Most of the funding came from Rothschild associates in America like the James Warburg Family , the Stern Family Foundation and the Samuel Rubin Foundation. Samuel"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" 225 Rubin was a registered member of the Communist Part y who stole the Faberge name (Faberge was \"Jeweler of the Imper ial Russian Court\") and made a fortune out of the Faberge name. The objectives of IPS came from an agenda laid do wn for it by the British Round Table, which agenda in turn ca me from Travistock Institute, one of the most notable being to create the \"New Left\" as a grass roots movement in the U.S. IP S was to engender strife and unrest and spread chaos like a wildfire out of control, proliferate the \"ideals\" of left wing nihi listic socialism, support unrestricted use of drugs of all types, and be the \"big stick\" with which to beat the United States politic al establishment. Barnett and Raskin controlled such diverse elemen ts as the Black Panthers, Daniel Ellsberg, National Security Council staff member Halperin, The Weathermen Underground, the Venceramos and the campaign staff of candidate Geor ge McGovern. No scheme was too big for IPS and its con trollers to take on and manage. Take the plot to \"kidnap\" Kissinger, which was in the hands of Eqbal Ahmed, a British M16 intelligence agent of Pakistani origin, laundered through \"TROTS\" (Trotskyite terrorists ba sed in London). The \"plot\" was \"discovered\" by the FBI so that it c ould not go too far. Ahmed went on to become the director of one of IPS's most influential agencies, The Transnational Institute w hich, chameleon- like, changed from its former name, Institute of Ra ce Relations, when intelligence agents of BOSS (Bureau of State S ecurity) in South Africa unmasked the fact that it was tied dir ectly to Rhodes Scholarship-Harry Oppenheimer and Anglo-American-Br itish mining interests in South Africa. BOSS also discredited th e South Africa Foundation at the same time. Through its many powerful lobbying groups on Capi tol Hill, IPS relentlessly used its \"big stick\" to beat Congr ess. IPS has a network of lobbyists, all supposedly operating inde pendently but in actual fact acting cohesively, so that Congressmen are pummeled from all sides by seemingly different and varied lo bbyists. In this way, IPS was, and is still, able to successfully sw ay individual Representatives and Senators to vote for \"the trend , the way things are going.\" By using key point men on Capito l Hill, IPS was"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":" 226 able to break into the very infrastructure of our l egislative system and the way it works. To give only a single concrete example of what I am talking about: in 1975, an IPS point man persuaded represen tative John Conyers (D-Michigan) and forty-seven members of the House to request IPS to prepare a budget study that would op pose the budget being prepared by President Gerald Ford. Alt hough not adopted, the request was reinstated in 1976, 1977, and 1978 gathering sponsors as it went. Then in 1978, fifty-six Congressmen signed their names to sponsor an IPS budget study. This was prepared by M arcus Raskin. Raskin's budget called for a fifty percent cut in t he Defense Budget, a socialist housing program \"that would compete wit h and steadily replace private housing and mortgage markets,\" a na tional health service, \"radical changes in the educational system that would disrupt capitalist control over the distribution of knowledge,\" and several other radical ideas. The influence of IPS on Arms Control negotiations was a major factor in getting Nixon to sign the treasonous ABM Treaty in 1972, which left the United States virtually defens eless against ICBM attack for almost 10 years. IPS became, and re mains to this day one of the most prestigious \"think tanks\" contr olling foreign policy decisions, which we, the people, foolishly b elieve are those of our law makers. By sponsoring militant activism at home and with links to revolutionaries abroad, by engineering such victori es as \"The Pentagon Papers,\" besieging the corporate structure , bridging the credibility gap between underground movements and a cceptable political activism, by penetrating religious organi zations and using them to sow discord in America, such as radical rac ial politics under the guise of religion, using the establishmen t media to spread IPS ideas, and then supporting them, IPS has lived up to the role which it was founded to play. STANFORD RESEARCH INSTITUTE "},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" 227 Jesse Hobson, the first president of Stanford Res earch Institute, in a 1952 speech made it clear what line s the institute was to follow. Stanford can be described as one of the \"jewels\" in Tavistock's Crown in its rule over the United State s. Founded in 1946 immediately after the close of WW II, it was p resided over by Charles A. Anderson, with emphasis on mind contr ol research and \"future sciences.\" Included under the Stanford umbrella was Charles F. Kettering Foundation which developed the \"Changing Images of Man\" upon which the Aquarian Conspiracy r ests. Some of Stanford's major clients and contracts wer e at first centered around the defense establishment but, as S tanford grew, so did the diversity of its services: Applications of Behavioral Sciences to Research Management. Office of Science and Technology. SRI Business Intelligence Program. U.S. Department of Defense Directorate of Defens e Research and Engineering. U.S. Department of Defense Office of Aerospace R esearch. Among corporations seeking Stanford's services w ere Wells Fargo Bank, Bechtel Corporation, Hewlett Packard, B ank of America, McDonnell-Douglas Corporation, Blyth, East man Dillon and TRW Company. One of Stanford's more secret proje cts was extensive work on chemical and bacteriological warf are (CAB) weapons. Stanford Research is plugged into at least 200 sm aller \"think tanks\" doing research into every facet of li fe in America. This is known as ARPA networking and represents the emergence of probably the most far-reaching effort to control the environment of every individual in the country. At present Stan ford's computers are linked with 2500 \"sister\" research consoles whi ch include the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Bell Telephone L aboratories, U.S. Army Intelligence, the Office of Naval Intelli gence (ONI), RANI), MIT, Harvard and UCLA. Stanford plays a key role in that it is the \"library,\" cataloging all ARPA documentation . \"Other agencies\"—and one can use one's imaginatio n here, are allowed to search through SRI's \"library\" for k ey words,"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" 228 phrases, look through sources and update their own master files with those of Stanford Research Center. The Pentago n, for instance, uses SRI's \"master files\" extensively, an d there is little doubt that other U.S. Government agencies do the sa me. Pentagon \"command and control\" problems are worked out by Stanford. While ostensibly these apply only to weapons and soldiers, there is absolutely no guarantee that the same rese arch could not, and will not, be turned to civilian applications. S tanford is known to be willing to do anything for anyone, and it is my belief that if ever SRI were to be fully exposed, the hostility wh ich would arise from revelations as to what it actually does would most probably force SRI to close. MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, ALFRED P. SLOAN SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT This major institute is not generally recognized a s being a part of Tavistock U.S.A.

RAND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION Without a doubt, RAND is THE think tank most beho lden to Tavistock Institute and certainly the RIIA's most p restigious vehicle for control of United States policies at ev ery level. Specific RAND policies that became operative include our ICB M program, prime analyses for U.S. foreign policy making, inst igator of space programs, U.S. nuclear policies, corporate analyses , hundreds of projects for the military, the Central lntelligence Agency (CIA) in relation to the use of mind altering drugs like pey ote, LSD (the covert MK-Ultra operation which lasted for 20 years ).

BRAIN WASHING remains the primary function of RAND.

Hudson Institute. Institute for Policy Studies. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. National Training Laboratories. Rand Research and Development Corporation. Stanford Research Institute.

All such killings will be done with an o piate....

Writing about instinct in animals Hume said, \"...which we are so apt to admire as extraord inary and inexplicable. But our wonder will perhaps cease or diminish when we consider that the experimental reasoning itself which we possess in common with beasts, and upon which the w hole conduct of life depends, is nothing but a species o f instinct, or mechanical power that acts in us unknown to ourselv es....

UNDERSTANDING MAN'S SOCIAL BEHAVIOR, Cantril. Cantr il was primarily responsible for establishing the Asso ciation for Humanistic Psychology based in San Francisco that t aught Tavistock methods. It is in institutions of this ty pe that we find the lines between pure science and social engineering b ecome totally obliterated. The term \"social engineering\" covers e very aspect of methods used by Tavistock to bring about massive ch arges in group orientation toward social, economic, religiou s and political events and brainwashing of target groups who then b elieve that opinions expressed and viewpoints taken are their o wn. Selected individuals underwent the same Tavistockian treatme nt, resulting in major shifts in personality and behavior. The eff ect of this on the national scene was, and still is, devastating a nd is one of the principal factors in bringing the United States int o the twilight, decline and fall state-of-being in which the countr y finds itself at the close of 1991. I did a report on this national condition under the title: \"Twilight, Decline and Fall of the Unite d States of America\" which was published in l987. The Associati on for Human Psychology was founded by Abraham Maselov in l957 a s a Club of Rome project. Another Tavistock-Club of Rome Commiss ioned opinion-making research center was established by R isis Likhert and Ronald Lippert who called it The Center for Res earch in the Utilization of Scientific Knowledge. The facility w as under the directorship of Club of Rome's Donald Michael. The center drew heavily on the Office of Public Opinion Research es tablished at Princeton University in l940. It was from here that Cantril taught many of the techniques used by today's pollsters-op inion makers. UNPUBLlSHED LETTERS, Kipling, Rudyard.
