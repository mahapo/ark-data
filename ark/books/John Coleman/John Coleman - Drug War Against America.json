America has a drug problem, an enormous drug problem that refuses to go away; one that wi ll not be solved until the nation gets to grips with its origin. The majority of Americans know that there is a drug epidemic, but only a small minority is awar e that it was inflicted upon our society by the \"rulers of darkness, the wicked men in high places, who prefer darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.\" Who these men are and how they run the largest and most profitable business in the world; what they have achieved and whether there are any effective countermeasures being taken, is the subject matter of this book. Please do not think that the drug trade is a mere street corner business, where pushers are controlled by the Mafia. Certainly it is part of the problem, but the real promoters of this accursed business are to be found in the ha lls of the \"elite\" of this world, the \"royal\" families, the \"noble\" families of Europe and the \"best\" families of America, Britain and Canada. The trade reaches into the highest echelons of power and has not been eradicated, but only somewhat contained. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (USDA) and drug enforcement agencies around the world are trying to figh t a forest fire with garden hoses lacking adequate wate r-pressure. How can this be? 1"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman The answer is that the drug trade cannot be stamped out because its directors, the rulers of da rkness, the wicked people in high places, will not allow the most lucr ative trade in the world, with lucrative profits requiring the bare minimum of investment capital, a virtually free product with little production cost, to be taken from them. The only problems the controllers of this massive \"corporation\" have to deal with are delivery and distribution. As I said in one of my White Papers, surely a nation that could mount a massive mobilization effort and send a huge army overseas to fight and win WWII, can mount a campaign to eradicate the drug trade? Is the drug trade a more formidable task than was waging war against Germany and Japan in the Second World War? Of course not, America can do it. The problem is that Factor X intervenes as soon as the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency begins to get on top of the problem and Factor X is the ruling elite, whose massive fortunes come from the drug trade. This trade had its beginning in 1652 and involved several other countries. Britain's aristocratic \"upper-crust\" actually ran the lucrative Chinese opium trade and Lord Palmerstone of the British Government actually enunciated it from Parliament. The immense wealth and power enjoyed by the \"old money\" families of the British aristocracy — the ruling class — can be traced back directly to that odi ous and dirty business. As I have often said in my Weekly Intell igence Reports and other works, the long struggle for control ove r Hong Kong that took place between the British and Chinese governments was not about the actual island land mass itself, but about who shall receive the lion's share of the billions of do llars generated by China's opium trade, which accounts for 64 per cent of its foreign exchange earnings. The \"noble\" families of Britain had always 2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America taken the biggest slice of the cake, but now that the Chinese have demanded a greater share, what with the collapse of the British Empire and its might, Britain had no option but to grant the request, which settlement came with a condition. Control of the world-wide trade was to remain in British hands, the stained hands of the \"noble\" and highly-respected \"old\" families, those who would not give the likes of the American people the time of day, the oligarchy who sit in the seats of power in high places! The drug war against America t ook a new and ominous turn in the early 1950's, with the introduction of the drug LSD to the youth of America by Aldous Huxley and Bertrand Russell. LSD is manufactured by the Swis s Oligarchy-Black Nobility family, Hoffman LaRoche. Th e experiment with LSD was officially under the control of the Stanford Research Center, where extensive experiments we re carried out under codenames \"Operation Naomi\" and \"Operation Artichoke\" using marijuana and cocaine. The youth of America disappeared under a blizzard of white powder produced from crinkled green leaves. Willing and unwilling victims were \"tested\" at such places as The Addiction Center, Mt. Sinai Hospital and the Boston Psychopathic Hospital, to name two of the mo st important test centers. With the simultaneous promotion of Theo Adorno's 12-Atonal \"music\" perfected at Wilton Park, home of British propaganda and a center for disinformation, came a stupendous fraud called \"rock music\" performed by rock bands, which was a medium for the introduction of notorious brainwashing and the drug \"testing\" programs The first of a long line of such deceptions was the \"discovery\" by Ed Sullivan of the drug sodden group \"The Beatles.\" The whole \"rock\" business was designed and perfected at Wilton 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Park with the calculated purpose of using it as a vehicle to induce widespread usage of drugs by American youth and make it an acceptable social custom. Rock was planned solely as a vehicle for the spread of drugs and all \"rock groups\" \"discovered\" after the Beatles experiment became an integral part of a psychological war wa ged against the youth of many nations. All the fraudulent groups were put together at Wilton Park by experts who called it \"atonal music\" after which Wilton Park unleashed a whole series of \"rock bands\" on an unsuspecting American public. Ed Sullivan, the best known radio personality in the U.S., was complicit in the crime of the century by bringing the \"Beatles\" to America! Those taking part in the prom otion of rock concerts or distributing records and tapes of the hideously jarring sound, a cacophony of mind-searing noise, s hould have been prosecuted for their involvement in the spread of drugs. I believe, all \"rock\" concerts are a criminal offense, because they are used to induce widespread drug usage among the youth. Thus it was that rock concerts were held primarily as a cover for drug distribution and rock \"music\" became an integral part of the drug war against America. It is time that we, the people, took the gloves off and knocked a few heads together! It will be doubly-difficult to er adicate the drug trade until \"rock music\" is eradicated and so called \"rock conceits\" are outlawed. That means closing down RCA reco rds division and, as those of you who have been following my reports through the years, know that the RCA is an arm of British Intelligence, which began in 1924, when U.S. Marconi was a wholly-owned subsidiary of British Marconi. Then, as now, RCA was run by the British by virtue of contro l exercised by Morgan Guarantee over the parent group, Westi nghouse and General Electric Company. United Fruit Company — now United Brands - 4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America whose chairman, Max Fisher, don ated huge sums of money to the Republican Party in 1972, held the franchise for all communication equipment sold in Latin America and the Caribbean by the RCA-Westinghouse-G.E. group. United Brands is heavily implicated in the drug trade, as the rare seizure of one of its vessels carrying a large cargo of drugs demonstrated. RCA had ties to Germany before the Second World War, through RCA's chairman David Sarnhoff s lifelong friendship with Hjalmar Schacht, the financial genius behind Hitler. It was friendships of this caliber that prevented \"Judge\" Jackson from securing a conviction against Schacht at the illegal Nuremberg \"trials.\" Judge Jackson was not a judge at all, but a lawyer, who accepted the U.S. Government's desperate call to fill the vacancy at the Nuremberg trial. The regular judges in the U.S. did not recognize the lawfulness of the Nuremberg proceedings and shunned offers by the Justice Department to represent the U.S. Government. Let me hasten to add that ille gal \"recreational\" drugs were completely stamped out in Germany while Hitler was in power. RCA, through Sarnhoff (a long time British Intelligence agent), made personal fundraising efforts for various drug-related experiments and projects carr ied out by Stanford Research Institute, the same institution that oversaw the notorious MK Ultra LSD experimental program. What about the present? As we reach mid-2009, the overall picture looks very bleak. DEA and international anti-drug authorities have not been able to make even a small dent in the well-protected drug trade infrastructure. In spite of increased efforts by the U.S. DEA, the fl ood of drugs entering America continues to rise, and is now offici ally out of control. This is not to say that America cannot stop the trade. What it tells us is that America is fighting a war on drugs with both hands tied behind 5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman its back. Efforts to fight the drug menace have the air of a comedy theater production, and will not be any more successful than their previously unsuccessful ventures, unless and until we get at the top people behi nd the whole drug scene. The following steps that have not been taken must be taken without any further delay: ■ Shut-off the spigot of \"For eign Aid\" to countries producing the raw materials of the trade. ■ The U.S. must also enter into a special extradition treaty with drug-producing countries, which would permit DEA agents to operate in producer countries with powers to extradite to the U. S. leading drug producers. If we were capable of formulating the Nuremberg Statutes for \"crimes against humanity,\" then we must also be capable of an international agreement that would give U.S. agents wide latitude, for is not the drug tr ade a crime against humanity? ■ The U.S. must appoint special prosecutors (as we did in the Tavistock-planned Wa tergate Conspiracy) to coordinate all drug-relate d criminal prosecutions. Inasmuch as the U.S. could establish an international tribunal at Nuremberg, then we most certain ly can do the same thing now, since drugs and the whole drug trade is a war against the civilized world - and most definitely a crime against human rights. ■ The U.S. must embark on a program to encourage countries producing the raw mate rials for the trade to sell the entire \"crop\" to U.S. appointed and controlled 6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America officials in concord with a written agreement that no further \"crops\" be produced. ■ U.S. agents must have an agreement that permits the soil in entire grower-areas (like Helmand in Afghanistan, home of the opium poppy) to be rendered unusable to plant poppies. This can be done and it is a lot cheaper than the enormous cost of policing our coastline and payi ng the medical bills for victims of the drug trade. ■ A step the U.S. can easily take is to pass laws instituting the death penalty for all those caught trafficking, dealing and or pushing drugs. ■ Addicts caught smoking or ingesting dope should be tried by a special court and if found guilty, sent to a correction camp in the middle of the Mojave desert with the minimum of human comforts. There would be a period of am nesty during which all drug dealers must turn in their st ocks of drugs to government agencies or specially selected citizen committees, for instant incineration. Thereafte r, anyone caught sel ling drugs or having possession of drugs for sale would be executed. ■ All establishments where drugs are used extensively, such as discos and nightclubs , must be forced to close down — the owners heavily fi ned and jailed if it is proved in courts of the special prosecutors that drugs were being used on the prem ises. \"Rock concerts\" must be outlawed and promoters of rock \"concerts\" must be heavily fined and jailed."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman ■ Anyone transporting drugs into the U.S. or across state lines must be tried by the special prosecutors at courts set up for the purpose. Upon a guilty verdict, the traffickers must be sentenced to death and the sentence carried out without undue delay. ■ The U.S. Agricultural Department must make treaties with all drug plant growing countries that will permit teams of U.S. agents to \"search and destroy\" all places where drug plants are discovered. This can be done cheaply and effectively be the application of a newly discovered \"sunlight killer herbicide\" which consists of a compound containing amino acid found in all plants. The compound is harmless to animal life, and overwhelms unwanted growth by a build-up of amino ac id in the drug plant, which collapses plant tissue and dehydr ates it within three hours. This new herbicide is capable of wiping out every coca bush, poppy and marijuana field at the so urce, without any damage to regular crops or poisoning of th e soil. Dr. William Robertson of the National Science Foundation said the herbicide is sprayed on just as evening sets in. As soon as the sun rises the next morning, a chain-reaction is triggered and the drug plants begin to \"bleed to death\" losing all th eir internal fluids. In a matter of hours, sprayed plants will shrivel up and die. The herbicide is easy to apply, and is inexpensive and environmentally safe. It does not react on food crops such as wheat, barley, oats, soybeans, etc. With internal support and intern ational agreements, the U.S. could wipe drugs off the face of the earth within a matter of three years and at an amazingly low cost. The program can 8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America become operational through trea ties and concordats. Any country refusing to join the program, which would include a clause mandating U.S. agents to be stationed in them, would have all U.S. foreign aid funding cut off. A world-wide trade boycott (as was enforced against Germany in 1933) must be instituted agai nst those countries refusing to sign and international pressu res brought to bear upon them through all United Nation agencies, of the kind that was ruthlessly applied against S outh Africa and Iraq. The new product, ALA, is already available and the U.S. must embark upon a crash program to produce it in sufficient quantities for use on a global scale. We must mobilize for war! To im plement this program in its entirety will require concentrated effort, but no bigger than it took in 1939-45. If we could make the mighty effort of the Second World War, then we are obligated to make the same effort now. America's security was never directly threatened by Germany in 1939. Germany had no quarrel with the U.S., but the Drug Merchants, the \"noble families,\" do pose a direct and very present dangerous threat to our security and future well- being as a great nation. The U.S. must declare war against such countries and their bases of pr oduction and their transportation and distribution systems must be wiped out. We must mobilize our massive resources in human and technical potential to meet the Drug Lords and destroy them. For the past 34 years, the Am erican people have watched helplessly as the tide of war went against them. Up to now the American people did not realize that we are at war because the enemy could not be as readily id entified as our propaganda mills identified Germany in 1939. Thos e same propaganda \"opinion makers\" are very reluctant to tackle the Drug 9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Merchants, which is not at all su rprising when one realizes that the \"opinion makers\" are a part of the same network. There is a grave need to bring home to Am ericans that the obscene profits from drugs that ruin millions of lives each year, also fund international terrorism. Recent DEA statistics show an alarming increase in the number of users of heroin, cocaine and marijuana in America. As for the terrorist aspect, one has only recall the activities of the \"Shining Pathway\" cult sect in Peru to see how drug money funded murder. This group was one of the most violent and vicious terrorist gangs in the world, a gang of t hugs bent on taking over Peru in order to get control of the lu crative cocaine business, until President Fujimoro of Peru got personally involved. But it was a move that was to cost him his pr esidency and his having to flee to Japan in fear of his life. Cocaine is an increasing menace which affects 20 million Americans. Made popular by the \"smart set\" and the Hollywood \"in-crowd,\" it is attracting an estimated 5,000 new users each day! Frank Monastero of the DEA stated recently that links to terrorism through the drug trade ar e very strong, \"but I do not think it is being looked at in th at way by certain segments in the administration.\" Although Monastero did not say to which \"segment\" he was referring, I know from conversations I've had with certain U.S. officials that he was talking about the U.S. State Department. The State Department has consis tently voiced its opposition to linking drug enforcement methods to suspension of \"Foreign Aid\" and has disagreed with implementing methods I've outlined in this book. It is a well-known fact that State 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America Department officials consider a narcotics control appointment abroad as the least desira ble foreign service posting. The Royal Institute for Interna tional Affairs (RIIA) and Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), who control the Rand Corporation (the organization that gave us Daniel Ellsberg of the Pentagon Papers notoriety), made matters worse by writing an unsolicited paper, which claimed that efforts to combat drug usage on the educational level \"are conflic ting, ambiguous and have zero effect.\" This is palpably untrue, but what else can we expect from an institution run by The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations whose masters are the very ones who profit from the vile drug trade? The Rand repo rt was like firing on our own troops, for if it had fired on the dr ug crowd, it would have been firing on its friends, not its enemies! The net result of the Rand report has been to discourage an ti-drug educational programs. Yet, Rand receives large grants from the U.S. government — an example of contradictions in our efforts to minimize the drug trade. The General Accounting Office (GAO) estimates that only ten percent of drugs smuggled into America get intercepted by law enforcement agencies. This ought to set the alarm bells ringing! How is it that a highly industrialized nation with such large manpower, money and technical resources is only able to intercept such a small percenta ge of the drugs? We must look for the \"hidden hand,\" the power controlling the drug trade from behind the scenes, the mysterious \"Force X.\" To get the proper answer to the question I will deal with that aspect as we proceed. A document of recent date that I have seen states that the production of opium poppies in China has increased by 50 percent since 2000. Other statistics in the document mentioned 11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman above show that marijuana and coca leaf production has increased by 30 and 40 percent, and opium production from poppies in Afghanistan has rise n from 4,0001bs. to 6,000 lbs. a year since the invasion of that country by U.S. and NATO troops in 2003. How has this feat been accomplished? It has been accomplished by an all-out war against America directed by the RIIA, Wilton Park, the Ta vistock Institute and the CFR and the ruling oligarchy the Black Nobility families of Europe. Their chief tool in this war ha s been ~ and still is — \"rock groups\" and \"rock concerts\" and the ceaseless promotion of the decadent 12-atonal cacophony of mind-destroying sound that passes for \"music.\" This tool was first used in 1950 and is the principal weapon in the enemy arsenal in its war on America and will continue to be used to spread drugs until someone puts an end to it once and for all! Getting back to the heroin business, the main poppy growing locations are found in the so-c alled \"Golden Triangle\" of Southeast Asia and the \"Golden Crescent\" in Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively. It is as well to remember the British \"Blue Blood\" families made their fortunes out of shipping opium from the fields of Afghanistan and Pakistan to users in China, in which countries they built for a 100 years, the necessary contacts that enabled them to safely and profitably carry on the trade today. As for the Middle East, the bulk of raw opium transits through Lebanon, Syria and Turkey. After an interim processing, it travels to Europe via Frankfort. The so-called \"Frankfort Mafia\" runs the distribution end of th e business, and the notorious Meyer Lanskey (a leading member of the Crime Syndicate, now deceased) was the kingpin in that operation. Upon Lanskey's death, the position passed to Israeli General Ariel Sharon, which 12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America he held up to his unlamented departure. Sharon had very strong ties with \"grower\" countries such as Bolivia and Peru, both major producers of the coca leaf from which cocaine is derived. Lebanon was invaded so that the country could be split up into fiefdoms, and, as I disclosed in one of my reports, Rifaad Assad, brother of Syrian President Ha fez Assad, was first placed under house arrest and then banished from Syria because of the \"private\" deals he was making with Sharon. Rifaad Assad's expulsion from Syria became a matter of public record, but the real reason behind it — drug re lated infractions — was never made public. Secret Senate reports indicate that the U.S. State Department did not follow President Reagan's directive that drug grower countries must be reprimande d. This should not come as a surprise, given the background and control exercised by Chatham House through British operative George Shultz, the former Secretary of State appoi nted by President G.H.W. Bush, a former titular head of the Eastern Liberal Establishment who has very strong ties to the drug trade. Drug producing countries hold th e position that the drug problem is an American one, a nd as long as there is an American demand for drugs, producer-countries are only fulfilling that demand. This view en tirely overlooks the fact that in China, originally, there was no demand for opium, up to and until it was \"created\" by the same unscrupulous \"noble\" families who then met the \"need\" and supplied the opium. It also overlooks the fact that the same families are still running the trade, but this time the recipi ent country is the U.S. Some Senators hold the view that the way to halt the trade is to \"legalize\" drugs, starting with marijuana and cocaine. Of course, they are quick to add that it should be small amounts for private use only. 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman This is tantamount to fighting a fire by pouring gasoline on it! The same people put private armies in position in Peru, Bolivia and Colombia to protect their enormous investments in the drug trade in these countries. Senator Paula Hawkins of Florida has confirmed this, as have private sources of information, which obviously cannot be named. In Bolivia, Colombia and Peru, these well-armed private armies ha ve fought pitche d battles with government troops and often defeated them! As a result, the bandits now have complete control in the \"growing\" areas and government officials have to obtain permission to enter such areas! Naturally, permission is never given and government agents entering the \"exclusion zone\" do so at the risk of being murder ed, as indeed many are. Senator Hawkins was all for shutting down \"foreign aid\" to offending countries and announced her intention of so doing. Senator Hawkins was chairman of the Senate Committee on Alcohol and Drug abuse, but soon lost her job once she became too insistent. Hawkins faced very strong opposition from within the State Department, as \"foreign aid\" is what they think of as strictly their province, not to be in terfered with. Since 1946, when David Rockefeller instituted this insidious give-away of U.S. taxpayer money and the CFR got it on the law books, the State Department has taken a \"hands-off\" attitude with regard to the foreign aid swindle. Former acting Assistant Secretary of State for narcotics, Clyde D. Taylor, put the State Department's position as follows: We have to keep the drug problem in perspective — we have other diplomatic interests in th ese countries, and if we go in and alienate them over drugs, we may be sorry when we need them a few years later for something else. The idea of revoking foreign aid is not as simple as it may seem. We don't have as much clout as you might think. 14"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America What an admission! Nevertheless, notwithstanding opposition from the British- controlled State Department, some progress, at least on paper, has been made during the last five years. Drug control agreements were negotiated with Pakistan, Bolivia, Peru, Mexico and Columbia although on very narrow grounds. With regard to Pakistan, the largest trade route for raw opium in the world, it is doubtful whether the agreement will have any effect on the flow of opium into America, because military leaders and other law enforcement agencies oppose any real control. Ali Bhutto, the former President of Pakistan, was the only one who actively opposed the drug trade under the protection of the military and was judicially murdered by General Zia ul Haq who succeeded him. Bhutto was fully committed to stamping out the drug trade in Pakistan, and his strong stand against drugs no doubt led to his death. So don't expect any slowing down in the Paki stan opium trade. It is being carried on even though the Atto rney General William French Smith of the United States went to Pakistan and personally appealed to the government to te rminate it with substantial U.S. help. President ul Haq's answer was to warn William French Smith to get out of Pakistan, as he was unable to guarantee his personal safety. Since then no U.S. Attorney General has visited Pakistan. On the other side of the world, the number one cocaine producer is Colombia, although it appears through a recent discovery of new coca plantations in Brazil, that it is likely to lose its place to Brazil. Cocaine is classified as \"non-ha bit forming\" and several eminent physicians in the pay of the Drug Merchants declared it 15"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman as having no lasting harmful effects. But all that changed, when a courageous doctor told the New York Times, that tests conducted with cocaine show that over the long haul, users suffer severe brain damage. Acco rding to DEA statistics I have seen, 75 percent of all cocaine, and 59 percent of all marijuana reaching American originates in Colombia. Bolivia produces 10%, as does Peru, with Mexico producing 9 percent of the marijuana. Locally grown marijuana accounts for 11 percent of the market, with 9% from Jamaica. Cocaine \"manufacture\" is a relatively simple process. The plant from which the leaf is taken grow s wild, but nowadays, it is also cultivated in plantations. The leaves are stripped from the bush by cheap local peasant labor, placed on tarpaulins and then stamped on, after which kerosene and calcium carbonate are poured on the partly mashed-up leaves, causing a white paste to appear. Sulfuric acid is then ad ded and the mixture is filtered, after which a deadly chemical, acetone, is added and the mixture left to dry. Some add white wine to the mix, which after a suitable time turns into a pure wh ite crystalline powder -cocaine. It takes about 300 pounds of coca leaves to produce one pound of cocaine. The cost of labor and raw material is so cheap that profits up to 5,000 percent are usual at the primary producer stage. The Colombian drug trade was, until recently, fully protected by the military, the judiciary and the banks, but that came to a stop when President Betancourt took office in 1991. Dissident military officers who were accustomed to making big profits from their slice of the cocaine tr ade, and who were not prepared to support Betancourt's anti-d rug program, found themselves stripped of rank and position. But since Betancourt's departure, things have reverted to \"norma l.\" Most of the money derived 16"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America from the trade finds its way into banks in Florida, and Swiss Banks. The Swiss press even went as far as to openly criticize President Betancourt, claiming th at his anti-cocaine policy would deal Colombia's economy a severe blow and cost the country dearly in foreign exchange . This is of c ourse a big lie, since most of the \"foreign exchange\" never goes back to Colombia, finishing up in the vaults of Swiss banks instead. No wonder the Swiss bankers didn't like Betancourt's anti-cocaine stand! Strongly lined up against Betanc ourt were elements of the Gnostic Church. In Colombia, the MI9 guerillas (known by their Spanish acronym FARC) deny that mo st of their income is from drug related sources. Betancourt got the leader, Dr. Carlos Toledo Plata, to sign an agreement with the Colombian government that brought about a tr uce in the fighting, but it was not very long before Plata was murdered by the Drug Merchants. Shortly after that murder, two thugs mounted on a motorcycle shot and killed Colombian Ju stice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, on the afternoon of April 30, 1984. Both men escaped to the drug capital Santa Marta, where they are protected by the private armies of the FARC re volutionary army. Both murders were looked upon with favor by the Drug Merchants, who have a great deal to lose if Colomb ia should succeed in stamping out its drug trade. Former President Lopez Michelson was heavily involved in the cocaine trade befo re he was ousted. He fled to the country following an abortive kidnapping plan of an antidrug deputy and went into hiding in Paris. His cousin Jamie Michelson Urbane keeps a big bankroll in Miami. Michelson was in deep troub le for suggesting that the Colombian Government negotiate an agreement with the Drug 17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Merchants. Drug-money banker Urbane, once the Chairman of Banco de Colombia, before fleeing to Miami on the same day two of his managers were arrested by Betancourt under Decree Number 2920. The order for the mili tary to begin spraying all fields where drug plants were growing with paraquat (a chemical agent that defoliates plants and bushes) was a major blow to the Drug Merchant barons, and those who stood to benefit the most from cocaine m oney, the oligarchs of the Black Nobility of Europe. Betancourt, by demonstrating his in tent to crush the drug trade, was no mere rhetoric and faced a grave threat of assassination. Nobody should believe that the Drug Barons and Europe's Blue Bloods would take attacks on their trade lying down. I well recall that when American officials approached British officials in a highly secret meeting held in Cambridge, England in 1985 to ask for help in co mbating the drug trade in the Bahamas, they were refused help or information. This will not surprise anyone knowing the Bahamas, where the whole government is in the drug busine ss run out of certain Masonic lodges in England, and proceeds are laundered through the Royal Bank of Canada. (Remember Ca nada is only an outpost of the British Royal Family and not a country in the same sense that America is a country.) Some of the leading American ba nks in such places as Panama, facilitate the flow of money - presently estimated at $550 million per year — acting as convenient channels for top people in Britain, Canada and the U.S. It will be recalled that General Manuel Noriega came to grief when he ripped the lid off one of the Rockefeller banks in Panama engaged in drug money laundering, in the mistaken belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the U.S. DEA. It is not only banks th at protect and shield the lucrative trade. Th e International Monetary Fund 18"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America (IMF) plays an ever increasingly important role in the trade. There is a great deal of eviden ce on hand showi ng that the IMF has been protecting the drug trade since 1960, but particularly with regard to top British institutions and the \"noble\" families running them. In England, it is perfectly legal to use drugs, but not to market them. This is in keeping with IMF policies and as far as Colombia is concerned, takes the position th at Colombia has the right to earn foreign curre ncy by exporting narcotics to wherever the demand is. This is on the grounds that income earned by narcotics helps to repay IMF loans - which are absolutely false. The Central Banking Department of the IMF works exclusively with offshore banks that receive large cash deposits from the drug trade. After the brutal and blatant murder of Columbia's Justice Minister, Rodrigo Lara Bon illa, IMF and Club of Rome \"connections\" panicked and began to distance themselves from M19 drug trade \"troops,\" because Betancourt angrily mobilized all available reserves, calling the murder a \"blight on Colombia's name.\" Going directly to the public, Betancourt called upon all citizens to help him in his struggle against the traffickers, saying \"national dignity is held hostage by these traffickers.\" The Catholic Church was asked to join in the struggle, and agreed to throw its weight behi nd the President, with only the Order of the Jesuits standing aloof. President Reagan would have done well to emulate Betancourt's tactics, and I believe he would have received such a mighty outpouring of support from the people as has never been w itnessed. But, sadly, Reagan did not do so. It is gratif ying to note that alt hough the Jesuits and the Gnostics joined forces with the M19 guerillas to disrupt 19"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Betancourt's anti-drug efforts, th ey made only slight headway, notwithstanding the powerful \"hidden-hand\" supporting their combined disruptive tactics. Be tancourt granted DEA the right to come into Colombia and spray drug plants with paraquat. He has also granted several extrad ition requests for top Colombian drug traffickers the U.S. has long sought to get its hands on. But the U.S. has thus far failed to reciprocate and failed to return Michelson Urbane to Colombia. During her visit to Colombia, Senator Hawkins praised the Colombian President's determined efforts to uproot the Drug Merchants. But my sources told me that in spite of a noticeable slowing down of cocaine to America, evidenced by a sharp increase in its price that does not mean the drug overlords are not fighting back. There is evidence that they have extended their activities in Argentina and Brazil to secure new plantation sites for coca bushes. Some Colombian officials, not wholly committed to President Betancourt, claimed they could not penetrate remote jungle sites where the traffickers were operati ng. The question is, if the drug traffickers can get in there, why can't government anti-drug forces do likewise? There is an urgent need to attack these plantation sites because evidence has come to light showing experimental fields of opium poppies (from which heroin is derived) growing in these remote \"impenetrable\" regions, according to John T.

In 2006, they began to use fleets of boats, planes, helicopters and a heavily armed private army. They were careful to act as public benefactors, financing many public projects.

One of the overlords, Pablo Escobar Gavira , poured huge sums of money into slum improvements, a program administered by the Jesuits who always favored the immensely wealthy Gavira. Gavira once spent $50,000 on his daughter's wedding and got himself elected as a parliame ntary deputy, thus obtaining parliamentary immunity from arre st. He was wanted by the U.S. DEA authorities for years. But af ter Justice Minister Lara was cut down by 22 bullets from an Uzi submachine gun, a great revulsion swept over the Colombian people. They turned on \"los grandes mafioses\" and things began to happen. Even the Jesuits distanced themselves from Gavira. With jurisdiction in drug related cases turned over to the military, the many judges who used to attend lavish parties give n by the drug merchants, were stripped of their former power . Bishop Dario Castrillon also tried to deny his connection with Drug merchants, saying the money he received from them was to build churches. Bribing judges was no longer acceptable, and the military courts established to try drug cases could not be reached by the bribers. Even the powerful Ochoa family ran for cover, but even their man, President Lopez Michelson, was in trouble. Ochoa called him in Panama, where he was c onsulting with other top drug traffickers, to warn him about the wholesale arrests going on at home. Incidentally, Gavira a nd the three Ochoa brothers representing 100 of the top drug dealers went to Michelson for help, but he failed them. Howe ver, the gangsters were not finished. In an astonishing de velopment, the Ochoas met with Colombian Attorney General Carlos Jimenez Gomez in Panama. For some reason, Gomez failed to notify U.S. authorities about the meeting.

Sinc e it is known that U.S. drug enforcement agents closely shadow all the leading Colombian Drug Merchants, how is it possi ble that these agents were unaware of the meeting in Panama? The hidden hand, the powerful families of America and Europe, the Swiss bankers, the IMF and Club of Rome, P2 Masons and probably the CFR, appear to have interv ened at this point. The Ochoas delivered a 72-page memo to the Attorney General, offering to dismantle the entire cocaine operation in Colombia in exchange for being allowed to return to Colombia without fear of arrest. The memo was delivered to U.S. authorities who replied that they did not make deals with criminals. As for Attorney General Gomez, his flimsy excuse for meeting with the drug overlords and failing to info rm his government thereof in advance was that he went to Panama on other business (which he neglected to specify) and quite by accident met the Ochoas. Gomez did not explain why he did not immediately telephone President Betancourt and inform him of the development. The truth is that Gomez was acting on orders from the \"hidden hand\" in the Colombia drug cartel. In Colombia, the Attorney General is appointed by their Congress and is not required to answer to the President. But many Congre ssmen were deeply angered by Gomez's strange actions and calle d for his resignation, which he declined. Escobar Gavira began operating out of Nicaragua under the protection of Jesuit priests in the Sandinista government. Secretly taken photographs showed Gavira and his men loading cocaine onto a plane in that country appeared to me to be quite genuine, but were undated.

What does Panama want with e normous quantities of kerosene, ether and acetone? These chemicals, as everybody knows, are not allowed as direct imports into Colombia, so it is obvious that Panama's imports are transshipped indirectly and illegally into Colombia.

Pablo Escobar was \"arrested\" in a highly publicized raid on his luxury home and compound, but recent intelligence reports claims that after a short stay in an American prison, he was spirited out of the U.S. Present whereabouts said to be \"unknown.\" When I was doing research through my hundreds of shorthand notebooks on this vital subject, I came across some interesting statistics I had noted in my i nvestigative work in London. It deals with the fact that in 1930, British capital invested in South America greatly exceeded its total investment in the so called \"dominions.\" On November 30, a certain Mr. Graham, an authority on the subject, said that British investment in South America \"exceeded one trillion pounds.\" Now this was back in 1930, and in those days it was a staggering sum of money. What was the reason why the British invested so heavily in South America? The answer adds up to one word: DRUGS. The plutocracy controlling British banks held the purse strings, and then as now, put up the mo st respectable facade. No one ever caught them with their hands dirtied; they always had front 24"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America men and willing stooges ready and waiting up front to take the blame. Then as now, the connections are always of the most tenuous kind. No one could ever lay a finger on the respectable \"noble\" banking families of Britain, not then, and not today. But there is a great significance in the fact, that 15 members of Parliament were the controllers of this vast empire in South America, including the Chamberl ain family and the family of Sir Charles Barry. The overlords of British finan ce and respectability, always crowing about oppression in Sout h Africa where the blacks have the best conditions in all of Africa, were also very busy in places like Trinidad and Jamaica, where they also held the reins in the drug business. In th ese countries, the plutocrats of the respectable families of British ar istocracy kept the blacks at a level barely above that of slavery, while paying themselves a handsome dividend. Of course they hid behind respectable companies like Trinidad Leaseholds Ltd. (an oil company), but the real meat was and still is, in the drug trade. Up to a short while ago, the opium trade in China was not a well- known subject. It had been as well covered up, as it was possible to do. Many of my students used to come to me and ask why the Chinese were so fond of opium. They were puzzled about contradictory accounts of what had actually taken place in China. Some thought that it was simply a case of the Chinese workingman buying opium locally and smoking it in some opium den. I did my best to enlighten those enquiring minds. The truth is that the opium trade in China was a British Monopoly subject to official Br itish policy. The Indo-British opium trade to China is one of the most carefully kept secrets and one of the most dastardly chapters in the history of European colonialism. Statistics show that almost 13 percent of 25"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman the income of India under British rule was derived from the sale of opium to Chinese addicts. The addicts just did not appear out of thin air; they were created. That is to say, a market for opium was first created among the Chinese and then the \"demand\" was filled by the British oligarchy, the overlords of the various banking houses of London. This lucrative trade is one of the worst examples of making money out of human misery, and provides a unique record of the dirty business deals conducted by the City of London, which s till today, remains the center of \"dirty deals\" in the financial wo rld. Of course you will doubt the statement, \"look at the Financial Times\" you say, \"it is filled with legitimate business deals.\" Of course it is, but you don't think that the noble aristocrats are going to advertise the true source of their income in the Financial Times, do you? The British did not advertise the f act that the opium was shipped from the Benares and Ganges valleys in India to China, where it was partially-processed under a st ate administered monopoly, an administration which existed solely to oversee the opium trade. You would not have expected to have read that in the London Times of the period, would you? Yet this trade has been conduc ted since 1652 by the illustrious East India Company, on whose board of directors sat the holiest of holy of the British aristocracy. They were a species above the common herd of mankind. They were so high and mighty they believed even God came to them for advice when He had a problem in Heaven! Later the British Crown joined this scurrilous East India Company and used it as a vehicle to produce opium in Bengal and elsewhere in India and control exports through what it called \"tra nsit duties,\" that is to say, a tax levied on all producers of opi um, duly registered with the state authority, who were sending th eir output to China. Prior to 1885 when it was still \"illegal\" (thi s was merely a word used to 26"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America exact greater tribute from the producers of opium - there was never any attempt to stop the trade) absolutely colossal amounts of opium were shipped out to China. So audacious had the British become, that far away, on the other side of the world, the British tried to sell the Union and Confederate Armies this lethal substance in pill form. Can you imagine what would have become of America if the plan had succeeded? Every soldier who survived that terrible tragedy would have left the battlefield, completely hooked on opium. The Bengal merchants and bankers grew fat and contented on the enormous amounts of money th at poured into their coffers from this trade of Bengal opium purchased by the British East India Company (BEIC), which is why their profits were in the region of the profits made by the number-one medical drug company, Hoffman La Roche, the same Hoff man La Roche that manufactures LSD among other things. Hoffman La Roche invokes the Swiss Industrial Espionage Act against anyone who dares to expose their rapacious greed, so one has to be careful when expressing an opinion. In any event, Hoffman La Roche manufactures a commonly used drug called Valium. It costs them around $3.50 per 2.5 pounds. They sell it for $20,000 per kilo, and by the time the American public, which uses Valium in astronomical amounts, gets it, the price is $50,000 pe r kilo! Hoffman La Roche does much the same thing with Vitamin C, on which it has a similar monopoly. It costs them around 1 ce nt per kilo to produce and they sell it for a profit, of so mething like ten thousand percent. When a brave man by the name of Adams, who once worked for them, disclosed this informa tion to the European Economic Commission's (EEC Monopolies Commission), he was arrested and maltreated by the Swiss police who kept him in solitary 27"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman confinement for three months. Then he was kicked out of his job and out of Switzerland, losing hi s pension and everything else. As a British national, he kept fighting Hoffman La Roche. Remember that, the next time you see those oh so correct and polite Swiss businessmen. Switzer land is not just Alpine ski slopes and pristine air under blue skies. Its banking industry has long been suspected of thriving on the drug businesses, legal and illegal, and the enormous profits made by the top men of the drug trade, these hounds from hell. Th e \"clean\" image of Switzerland begins to look tarnished when one pulls up the corner of the covers. During her time as Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher went on a tour of British Customs posts at Heathrow London airport. Her purpose was to give the Cu stoms officers a \"pep talk\" on combating the drug menace. What hypocrisy. The leading British conservative newspaper derided Mrs. Thatcher's effort but did not call her a hypocrite, or in any sense divulge the truth about who is behind the menace. \"Oh,\" you say, \"but both the Americans and the British have made some notable drug busts recen tly.\" Yes, but that represents 0.0009 percent of the to tal value of drugs available on the open market. It is what the top drug merchants and their respectable bankers call \"part of the cost of doing business.\" No one who has attended the funeral of a young drug addict — and there are many every day - can fail to be moved by the Prime Minister's remarks about the drug problem s facing Britain. No one was likely to baulk at her strictures on pushers. \"We are after you,\" she said. \"We will pursue you relentlessly.\" Mrs. Thatcher: The effort will get greater and greater until we have beaten you. The penalty will be long prison sentences. The penalty will be confiscating everything you have got from drug 28"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America smuggling. There will also be widespread support among Britons to reject appeals from abroad to help Britons caught smuggling drugs, particularly of a young Briton facing the death sentence in Malaysia for trying to smuggle heroin through Penang airport. There is no point in appealing to us. All over Malaysia you will find posters saying the penalty for dealing in drugs is death. This is fine, but then it should be applied to all those at the top of the aristocratic heap in England with equal force. When a young Briton was executed in Malaysia for drug smuggling, then so should have been half of those listed in Debretts Peerage (a high society listing of titled English families). Who did Mrs. Thatcher think would be affected by her \"tough\" new stance? Did she think that the top families in Hong Kong, the Keswicks and the Mathesons, were going to be intimidated by her rhetoric? While her words may have had the effect of frightening a few of the small fry, the big fat sleek fi sh escaped her drag net and the small fry who were caught, were soon replaced by thousands of others, eager to take their place. The drug menace will not be c ountered by fighting it on the street corner level. As far as I am concerned, and in my opinion, based upon my years of research into the subject, the drug business, at least in Britain, is run by the very top people in the British hierarchy, even, making use of such institutions as the Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem. As far back as 1931, the managing directors of the so-called Big Five companies in England were rewarded by being made peers of the realm. Who chooses ho w honors are bestowed upon the leaders of the top echelon in the drug business? In England it is Queen Elizabeth Guelph, better known as the ruling head of the House of Windsor. Banks involve d in this trade are too 29"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman numerous to list, but a few of the main ones are the Midland Bank, the National and Westminster Bank, Barclays Bank and of course, the Royal Bank of Canada. Many so-called \"merchant bankers\" in the City of London are up to their eyebrows in the drug trade, venerable financial institutions such as Hambros for example. Let me be more specific and mention such illustrious names as Sir Anthony Eden's family. According to secret documents I saw, and according to my best analyses of these documents, the Eden family would have qualified for Mrs. Thatcher's \"honor s list.\" If one were able to examine the records of the In dia Office in London as I was fortunate to do, I believe it would become apparent that there is no other conclusion to be drawn. I am deeply indebted to the trustee of the papers of the late Professor Frederick Wells Williamson for the help and assistance given me in my studies of these documents. If the papers were to be made public, what a storm would burst over the heads of the crowned vipers in Europe! The flood of heroin thr eatens to engulf the Western world. The vast enterprise is run and financed on both sides of the Atlantic — by certain members of the British-U.S. Liberal Establishment. What is heroin? It is a derivative of opium, and opium says the noted authority Galen, is a drug that stupefies the senses and induces sleep. It is also one of the most habit forming-dependency drugs on the market. The seed of the poppy, from which opium paste is derived, was long ago known to the Moguls of India, who it is recorded, used poppy seeds mixed w ith tea leaves and served the brew to their enemies when it was inexpedient to cut off 30"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America their heads. As far back as 1613, the first opium reached England from Bengal via the East India Company, but such imports were only the smallest amounts. The English yeoman and middle class could not be i nduced to take the drug, which was the reason why the British East India Company imported it in the first place. With such a signal failure, the oligarchy began to cast around for a market that would not be so unbending, and China was their choice. In the papers The Miscellaneous Old Records of the India Office, I fo und confirmation that the opium trade really took off with the introduction of the drug into China. This is confirmed also in the personal papers of Sir George Birdwood an official of the British East India Company (BEIC). Vast quantities of opium were soon being shipped to China. Where the BEIC failed in Engla nd, it now succ eeded beyond its highest projections among the \"coolies\" in China, whose wretched lives were made bearable by the drug. It was not until 1729 that the first of many laws against opium smoking were enacted by the Chinese government and from this time on, the British oligarchy entere d into a running battle with the Chinese authorities, a battle which the Chinese lost. The U.S authorities are likewise conducting a running battle with today's dope barons, and just as the Chines e lost their batt le, so too is the U.S. losing the ongoing battle. When I talk of Bengal opium from India, I am talking about opium made from seed pods of opium poppies grown in the Ganges Basin. The best opium co mes from Bihar and Benares, and of course there is much opium of an inferior quality from other areas of India. Latterly some excellent quality opium (if one can apply the word \"excellent\" to so dangerous a product) is coming out of Pakistan in very sizeable quantities. The profit from this vast trade was known for many years as \"The Spoils of the Empire.\" 31"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman In a noted trial held in 1791, a certain Warren Hastings was put on charges that he had helped en rich a friend at the expense of the East India Company. The act ual wording is interesting, because it confirms the enorm ous amount of money that was being made. The charge was that Hastings had granted \"a contract for the Provision of Opium for four years to Stephen Sullivan Esq. without advertising for the same , on terms glaringly obvious and wantonly profuse, for the purpose of creating an instant fortune for the said Stephen Sullivan Esq.\" As the semi-official and later official East India Company he ld the monopoly, the only people allowed to make \"instant fortunes\" were the so-called \"nobility,\" the \"aristocracy,\" and the oligarchy families of England. Outsiders like Mr. Sullivan, soon found themselves in trouble if they were so bold as to try and help them to get into the multi- billion pound sterling act! In 1986 I saw a publication from the most dubious source (by this I mean that it was obviously a product of the Third Department of the KGB), that purported to show the drug trade was linked to the mythical \"Nazis.\" The organization that printed the stuff is always after the Nazis. If a camel in the zoo in New York caught a cold, it woul d be the fault of the mythical \"Nazis.\" Five years of investigati on, including several personal conversations with the man wh o was allegedly the head and organizing genius behind the mythical Nazi bank accounts in Swiss banks, left me convinced that the authors of the printed material were dragging a red herring over the trail. The so called \"Nazis\" have nothing whatever to do with the drug trade, unlike the British and the U.S. — a fact very well-known to the U.S. DEA. 32"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America As I have noted so many times before, there are still doubters, that the honorable BEIC, with its long list of directors who were honorable Members of Parliament and belonged to only the best gentlemen's clubs in London, carried on the lucrative opium trade and brooked no interferen ce from the British government or anyone else for that matter. Trade between Britain and China was the monopoly of the BEIC. The company had a neat little trick; most of its members in India and at home, were also magistrates. Even passports issued by the company were needed to land in China. When a number of investigators arrived in China to investigate opium trade allegations being made in England, their British passports were promptly revoked by the East India Company's \"magistrates.\" Friction with the Chinese government was common. Officially, China had passed a law (the Yung Cheng Edict of 1729) prohibiting the importation of opium. Yet the British East India Company saw to it that opium still appeared in the Chinese customs tariff book up until 1753, the duty being three taels per chest of opium . Back then the monarch of England's special secret service (t he \"007\" of the day) saw to it that troublesome people were bought of f, or if they could not be bought off because they had plenty of money of their own, they were simply eliminated. British colonial capitalism has always been the main stay of the oligarchist feudal systems of England, and remains so up until this day. When the poor, untutored and militarily ill-equipped South African farmer-guerillas fell into the drug-stained hands of the British aristocracy in 1899, they had no idea that the relentlessly cruel war waged ag ainst them, was made possible only by the incredible amounts of money, which came from the \"instant fortunes\" of the British drug trade in China, and flowed into the pockets of plutocrats, w ho engineered the war. The real 33"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman instigators of the war were Barney Barnato and Alfred Belt, both from Germany, and Cecil John Rhodes, an agent for the Rothschild banking house, a bank awash in a sea of cash generated by the drug trade.

Thes e three men robbed the Boers, the rightful owners of the gold and diamonds of a stupendous fortune, and in this they were ai ded and abetted and protected by the British Parliament. The Joels and the Oppenheimers who were the leading families involved in gold and diamond mini ng are in my studied opinion, the biggest thieves ever to de face this Earth, and I make no apology whatsoever for making such a harsh judgment. The average South African, who sh ould have benefited from the billion upon billions of dollars worth of gold and diamonds extracted from beneath the soil of South Africa, received almost nothing from this immense fortune. In short, the South Africans have been robbed blind of their birthright, because unlike true capitalism, the Babylonian capitalist system operating in South Africa does not permit wealth to be shared; it does not filter down to those who have earned it. This is the crime of the century, financially speaking, and it was all made possible through the vast fortune from the opium trade, which allowed Queen Victoria to finance a great war of oppression against the Boers. It is practically impossible for an outsider to penetrate the secrets of the British oligarchy and the interrelated families that make it up. I estimate that 95 percent of the British population must be co ntent with less than 20 percent of the national wealth of the c ountry, and that is what they call \"democracy.\" No wonder then the Founding Fathers of the American Republic hated and despised \"democracy.\" 34"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America The camouflage the oligarchists have painted over themselves as a protective coloring is very hard to penetrate. Nonetheless, it affects the lives of every Ameri can, since what Britain dictates, America carries out. History is replete with such examples. We have only to look at British propaganda that got America into the First World War via the big lie of the sinking of th e Lusitania, to see how true my statement is. We are not deali ng with \"nice, proper British gentlemen\" here; we are dealing with ruthless elite who are determined to protect their way of life, and who are inextricably woven and intertwined with the drug business. The majority of British political leaders of any importance are all descendants of so called titled families, the title being passed at the death of the holder to the eldest son. This system has camouflaged a particularly alie n element that has crept into higher aristocracy. Look at the man who dictated the course of conduct of the Second World War, Lord Halifax, the British Ambassador to Washington. His son, Charles Wood, married a Miss Primrose, who is a blood re lative of the most ignoble House of Rothschild. Behind su ch names as Lord Swaythling was hidden the name of Montague, associated with Queen Elizabeth, the majority stockholde r of the Shell Oil Company. Nothing of course dare be said about the immense fortune she derives from the drug trade, a tr ade, which as I have shown, goes back to the 18 th century. One of the prime movers in the opium trade in China was Lord Palmerston, who clung obstinately to the belief that the trade would be allowed to continue. In a letter from one of his men on the spot, a certain Mr. Elliott, said enough opium handed to the Chinese government would 35"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman help to create a monopoly. Thereafter the British would withhold supplies, making the Chin ese \"coolie\" pay more for his supplies. Then when the Chines e Government was on its knees, the British would once again offe r to supply them at a higher price, thus retaining their monopoly through the Chinese government. But the plan did not succeed for very long. When the Chinese government responded by destroying large cargoes of opium stored in a warehouse, and the British merchants ordered to sign an agreement as individuals not to import any more opium into Canton city, they countered this by contracting various front companies to impor t on their behalf and it was not long before many of the ships in the roads of Macao, contained full cargoes of opium. Chinese Commissioner Lin said: There is much opium on board the English vessels now lying in the roads of this place (Macao) which will never be returned to the country from whence it came. A sale must be made here on the coast, and I shall not be surp rised to hear of its being smuggled in under American colors. But to move on to more recent history of this infamous trade, which has been broadened to incl ude vast amounts of cocaine, and legally produced drugs at enor mous profits, such as Valium, and other so-called \"prescription drugs.\" The oligarchist families of Great Britain moved their h eadquarters from Canton to Hong Kong, but remained in the same trade. They are still in it today in 2009 as a list of prominent names in the Co lony will show. As I said in my earlier works, a secondary industry arising from the opium trade made Hong Kong the most important gold trading center in the world. Gold is used to pay the peasants 36"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America who produce the raw opium; after all what would a Chinese peasant do with as U.S. $100 b ill? Opium produces 64 percent of the Gross National Product of China, which will give you some idea as to just how vast this \"off ledger\" business is. Unofficially it is estimated to be equal to the combined Gross National Product (GNP) of five of the smaller nations of Europe i.e. Belgium, Holland, the Czech Republic, Greece and Romania. The Golden Triangle is perhaps the principal supplier of raw opium outside Afghanistan, although its position is being challenged by Pakistan, India, Lebanon and Iran. How do banks figure in this lucrative trade? It is a very long and complicated story, and the story will have to wait for another book. One way is the indirect method where banks finance the front companies importing the chemicals needed to process raw opium into heroin. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, with a large branch office in London is right in the middle of the business. A company called Tejapaibul banks with Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, affectionately known as the \"Hongshang Bank.\" What does this company do? It imports very large quantities of acetic anhydride, the essential chemical required in the refining process. This company is the major supplier of the acetic anhydride for the Golden Triangle. Financing of the trade is hived off to a subsidiary of the Hong Shang Bank, the Bangkok Metropolitan Bank. Thus the seco ndary activities connected to the opium trade in the Golden Triangle, while not as big as the actual trade in opium itself, ne vertheless brings in a very substantial income to these banks. I have been criticized for linking the price of gold with the ups and downs of the opium trade. Let us take a look at what 37"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman happened in 1977, a critical year for gold. The Bank of China shocked the gold buffs and those clever forecasters who are to be found in vast numbers in America, by suddenly and without warning, releasing 80 tons of gold onto the market. The experts didn't know that China had been buying and hoarding gold for a long time. That depressed the price of gold. All the experts could say was that they did not know the People's Republic of China possessed that much gold in the first place! Where did the gold come from? It came from the opium trade where it is a medium of \"curre ncy\" in Hong Kong, but our gold price forecasting genius es could not know that! It was not only the British who are operating in the Golden Triangle. Substantial bu yers (or their representatives) regularly travel to Hong Kong from all ove r the West to make buys. There is wholesale shipping of heroin out of Hong Kong harbor, heroin, which is destined to make its way into the West and be handed out at self-styled \"rock\" concerts. Red China is happy to co- operate with both sides in such a lucrative venture. Incidentally the policy of China toward Engla nd, vis-a-vis the drug trade, has changed little from what it was in the 19 th century. The Chinese economy, tied to the economy of Hong Kong, would have taken a terrible beating, had an agreement not been reached. One of the proofs of this is th e loan accepted by China from the Standard and Chartered Bank. Since then the Matheson family has stepped forward and invested $300 million in a new real estate development being join tly developed by the Peoples Republic of China and the Matheson's banks.

Drugs in all their mani festations of production, commercialization and consumption, de-nationalize and denaturalize everybody by injuring our ethical, religious and political life, our historic, econom ic and republican values. This is exactly the way in which the IMF and the Bank of International Settlement (BIS) are operating. I say without hesitation that these banks are nothing more than clearinghouses for the drug trade. The BIS aids any country, whic h the IMF wants to sink, by setting up ways and means, which permits the easy flow of flight capital. Nor does the BIS recognize any distinctions when it comes down to what is \"flight capital\" and what is laundered drug money. Even if it could te ll the difference, the BIS never says anything as its annual re port for 2005 clear ly indicated. Touching on the statement made by the Venezuelan Ambassador, we find that the BIS is seriously denationalizing many countries by interfering in their ethical, religious, economic and political life, through its demands via the IMF. And if any country, (including th e U.S.) declines to bow the knee, BIS says in effect, \"right, then we will blackmail you through narcotic dollars that we are holding for you in very large amounts.\" It is easy to see now why gold was demonetarized and substituted by paper \"dollars\" as the world's 39"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman reserve currency.

From Colombia to Miami, from Palermo to New York, from the Golden Triangle to Hong Kong, dope is big business. It is not a street corner penny-ante business. Now you know as well as I do, that successfully organizing the biggest business in the world, takes a great deal of money and expertise. These talents are not found on the subways and street corners of New York though the pushers and peddlers are an integral and important part of the system, albeit only very small-time salesmen, who are easily replace able. If a few are caught, or killed, what matter? There are plenty of replacements. No, it is not a small organization, but a vast empire, this dirty drug business. And of necessity it is operated from the top down, by the very top people in ev ery country it touches.

The main countries involved in th is, the biggest business in the world, are the USSR, Bulgaria, Turkey, Lebanon, the USA and France, Sicily, Southwest Asia, In dia, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Latin America, although not in order of importance. From the consumer point of sale, the USA, Europe and lately, the United Kingdom are the prime markets. As I indicated, no dope is sold in the USSR, Iron Curtain countries or Malaysia. Many of the producer countries such as Turkey have very stiff penalties for drug users and small-time pushers. Some countries even carry the death penalty — strictly for the small fish, as a grandstand play to let the world see how \"anti-drugs\" they are. The drug empire is divided between two \"products,\" viz, the traditional heroin and the fairly recently arrived cocaine. There is a third category of drugs made by \"legal\" companies such as the notorious Hoffman La Roche, which companies make death dealing substances like LSD, Quaaludes and Amphetamines; the so called \"uppers and downers\" of what the street crowd call \"the pill poppers paradise.\" Is th is empire a loosely knit affair? The answer appears to be a qualified \"yes.\" There are exceptions. Kintex the notorious Bulgarian drug company is definitely a Bulgarian state-run company. Many of the banks handling the dirty money (and they know that it is dirty money) are well known multi-national banks, working through a network of subsidiaries. The Kintex Company for instance has its own warehouses, fleets of trucks, including Common Ma rket (EEC) international 41"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman treaty-covered vehicles and a sophi sticated network of couriers, including airline pilots and crews. For those not familiar with the EEC, let me explain that TIR vehicles are Triangle Internat ional Routier trucks, clearly marked in this manner; they are supposed to carry only perishable goods. They are suppos ed to be inspected in the country of departure by that coun try's customs staff, and sealed with a special seal. Under the international treaty obl igations of member countries, these trucks are not to be stopped at borders, and are always passed through without inspection. It is a case of taking the Bulgarians and the Turks at their word, and hoping to God that the TIR trucks do not contain heroin, cocaine or raw opium, hash and or uppers and downers. The problem is that in many cases, TIR trucks do contain large caches of drugs. After all, it is a well-known fact that the drug lords are no respecters of international treaties and in any case, can always get their paid stooges in other countries to substitute documents disguising the fact that the TIR truck originated in Sofia, Bulgaria. The only way to stop these huge amounts of heroin and hash from getting through from the Far East is to end the TIR system. But that is exactly what it was set up to do! Forget about perishable goods and f acilitating trade. That is just so much smoke in the eyes of the world. TI R equals dope in far too many cases. Remember that the next time you read about a big haul of heroin found in a false-bottom suitcase in Kennedy airport, and some unfortunate \"mule\" is arre sted. That is strictly \"small potatoes\" for the news media. 42"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America There are other areas that grow poppies; Turkey, Pakistan and Iran. But as it has been for over three hundred years, the \"best\" stuff comes from India-Pakistan and Thailand. In these remote areas of high mountains and valleys, hill tribesmen grow the crop and gather the thick sap from the pod after it is cut with a razor blade. Most of this is in the hands of w ild Thai tribes, and in India, it is the Baluchi tribesmen who are the cultivators and the reapers of the \"gold\" cash crop. They call it \"Golden Triangle,\" because the tribesmen insist on being paid in gold. To facilitate this, Credit Suisse began to sell 1 kilo of pur e gold bars (what is called four ninths in the trade), as these small bars are easy to carry and trade readily. Most of this gold moves through Hong Kong, which trades more gold than New York and Zurich combined at the height of the \"Dope Season,\" as it is known amongst Hong Kong gold traders. This area alone is thought to produce approximately 175 metric tons of pure heroin in a good year. The heroin is then pipelined to the Sicilian mafia and the French end of the business, for refining in the laboratories that infest the coast of France from Marseill es to Monte Carlo (and that includes the Grimaldi family — although I am not suggesting that there is a laboratory in their palace!) The route followed goes through Iran and Turkey, as well as Lebanon. The Pakistan trade is via the Maccra coast. In Iran the \"moving\" is done by the Kurds, as it has always been done for centuries. One of the primary staging areas is of course Turkey, but lately Beirut has become immensely important, hence the war going on in that country, as each local baron tries to carve out his fiefdom the Swiss-Lebane se banks are right on hand to help with the money side of things.

But the final and more elaborate refining is still carried out in laboratories in Turkey and along the French coast. Now stop right there and consider what I have written. Is it possible, that with all the sophi sticated techniques, methods and equipment available that law enforcement agencies cannot uncover and destroy these heroin factories? If this is the truth, then our intelligence services in the West are in need of Geriatric treatment, no, they mu st have died a long time ago, and we have forgotten to bury them! Even a child could tell our drug enforcement agencies what to do. It would be a very simple ma tter to keep a check on all factories making acetic anhydride, the essential chemical component needed to refine heroin . It is so simple that it is laughable, and I am reminded of \"Inspector Clouseau\" of the \"Pink Panther\" cartoon and movie series. I think even that poor old Clesseau would be able to find the laboratories by following the route and destinat ion of the acetic a nhydride. Governments ought to make laws which would force manufacturers to keep a special register showing to whom the product is sold. But do not hold your breath on this one; remember the Dope Trade equals big business which is controlled by the oligarchy of Europe, England and the old \"noble\" fam ilies of America.

Again, a qualified yes, but remember, Am erica and England are run by 300 families and they are all interfaced and intertwined through companies, banks and marriages, not to mention their ties to the Black Nobility.

If you go around asking questions in the wrong quarter, you run the risk of very strange things happening to you — that is if you are still intact. In equal, even ly spaced shipments, the \"stuff comes down from Turkey and into Bulgaria. There it is repacked in TIR trucks and shipped to Trieste at the Adriatic Coast or the coast of France.

There are also sea routes and air routes, both well protected by \"higher authority.\" As I said, the odd mule is caught; sometimes even a large shipment is apprehended, not so much heroin (because it is more valuable); it is mainly cocaine and marijuana which is expendable as the cost of doing business. As weird as this may sound, \"tips\" often come from the very drug traders themselves where small amounts are involved. In South America, the battle is against cocaine.

Interlopers are not welcome, and usually finish up as casualties in the \"family feuds\" that are co nstantly erupting. The principal cocaine producing countries are Colombia, Bolivia and Peru, with some attempts being made to introduce the coca bush to Brazil. In Colombia the drug mafia is a closely-knit family of gangsters who are well known to the authorities. The problem is to do something about them. With protection from the highest sources in England and America, the cocaine barons are openly contemptuous of the efforts of sincere anti- drug fighters like President Betancourt of Colombia. Betancourt did just about everything that his limited resources allowed, but it was not enough. The scourge of the cocaine dealers and producers continues to dominate Colombian national life. There seems to be no way to eradicate it. Betancourt fought a tremendous battle to survive. The drug barons, on the other hand, received every possible a ssistance from the IMF and it was no longer a question of whethe r Betancourt would survive; it was only a question of how long he could hang on to office. The other principal cocaine supplier to the United States is Bolivia and for a short while President S iles Zuazo tried to stem the tide of cocaine flowing into America, but his efforts failed.

The former head of the country from 1971 to 1978, Hugo Banzer Suarez won handsomely. This was not unexpected as Suarez received very strong support from the Wall Street bankers and friends of Henry Kissi nger, and of course, he got a vote of confidence from the Bolivian officer class. As a former dictator and friend of the Bolivian Mafiosi, Suarez was expected to expand the cocaine trade. As a \"reward\" for the help he received from the IMF, Suarez was expected to enforce the brutal conditionality's impos ed on Bolivia by the IMF, and as a result we saw many Bolivia ns die of starvation and hunger in the months that followed. This is of course all in accordance with the Global 2000 Report. At the same time, a veritable flood of cocaine began pouring into the U.S. The IMF, acting on behalf of th e hierarchy of the drug business in England and the USA, successful ly forced Bolivia into chaos. In fact, the country was ungovernable during the period that elections were held. This is what the Venezuelan Ambassador meant when he said, \"the drug trade is infringing on national sovereignty, on politics and economics.\" I can think of no clearer example of this than Boliv ia. With the victory of Banzer, the IMF fairy godmother suddenly announced that it would back Bolivia in negotiations with foreign creditors. Bolivia's key industries are mining and agricultu re.

I will also examine the role played by Pakistan in the opium poppy culture, and why the United States has looked the other way on at least three occasions when the elected government of Pakistan was overthrown and replaced by a military regime, while Chile and Argentina were singled out for \"special measures\" for the same \"crime.\" Afghanistan is an ancient Muslim land north of the Hindu Kush Mountains. Some old instrument s found in the Haibak Valley were carbon-dated, which showed they were at least a thousand years old. What attracted Westerners to the land is that it had the ideal climate and soil for the cultivation of opium-producing poppies. It was ruled by the Ba rakzai Dynasty from 1747 to 1929 and was known for prolonged conflict between members of the dynasty and tribal leaders. Prior to the 18 th century, the country was under the rule of Persia, and in parts, ruled by India. The Barakzai family has ruled the opium trade for at least 150 years, and as we know, when U.S. Armed Forces overthr ew the Taliban, they placed a member of the clan, Hamid Barakz ai, at the head of Afghanistan and the country is curr ently under his control. 49"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman In 1706, Kandahar declared its independence, and in 1709 Mir Vais, a Ghilzain chieftain, and a Sunnite Moslem defeated the Persian armies sent against him at Kandaha, which ensured that the opium trade was kept in British hands. In 1715 Mir Abdullah succeeded Mir Vais, but was caught trying to make peace with the Persians, and overthrown in 1717. There followed a period of inte nse rivalry followed by an invasion of Persia by the Afghans. In 1763 Zaman Shah, son of Timur came to power, but instead of unity, it was marked by total a nd incessant tribal rivalries and fierce battles. His father, a timid ruler, could not stop India from taking some of its territories, including the Punjab, which was lost to the Sikhs during the battles of 1793-1799. In 1799, emissaries from the BEIC began arriving in Kandahar to meet with the ruler, Shah S huja. In 1809, before the death of Shah Shuja, the BEIC concluded an agreement with him that it would help to repel \"foreigners\" particularly from Persia and India. In 1818 Mahmud Shah a ssumed control of the country and set about strengthening rela tions with the BEIC, who by then were in charge of \"agricultural expansion\" in the form of vast poppy fields. Sensing that a rich prize awaited them, the Persians invaded in 1816, but were driven out by Path All Kahn a soldier and confidant of the BEIC. In 1818 there was a revolt among the tribes over th e cultivation of poppies and the revenues derive d from the sale of raw opium to the BEIC. As a result, Afghanistan was divided up into tribal enclaves, Kabul, Kandahar and Ghazni etc. It was during this time of division that India st ole Kashmir from Afghanistan, because India wanted a piece of th e lucrative opium pie. In 1819 after a series of tribal wars Dost Mohammed captured Kabul 50"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America and became the ruler of Ghazni and Kandahar. Seeing a chance to horn in on the opium trade, which flourished under the BEIC, Persia attacked Herat in 1837 and a tribal conflict broke out that lasted until July 1838. The root cause of the fighting was the opium trade, firmly in the hands of the British. Ever the master- schemers, the British Go vernment concluded an agreement with Ranjit Singh and Shah Suju, who under the auspices of the BEIC would restore the throne of Shah Shuja, thus unifying the tribesmen, and effectively bl ocking out Persia. But unbeknown to the British, Dost Mohamed was becoming rich by dipping into the opium trade, making deals outside of BEIC. In 1839, British troops stationed in India moved into Afghanistan in the First Afghan War. They deposed Dost Mohammed and banished him to I ndia. His assets were seized by BEIC and British troops took over the major cities and towns, but soon found that they were dealing with an elusive force of tribesmen under one or another alliance. Throughout this entire period, nothing was allowed to get in the way of poppy cultivations, and large amounts of raw opium were dispatched out of Afghanistan, usually through what was to become Pakistan. During this period, because the company knew how to control local tribes men and secure protection for their lucrative investments, the company made huge profits. Questions were raised in the House of Commons in London, as to why British troops were bei ng deployed in such a forlorn country as Afghanistan when th ere was nothing of significance to keep them there. Little did the poor Members of Parliament (MPs) know about the vast fortune being made every year by BEIC. While the British advertised their fight with the Chinese \"war lords\" (in reality the Cust oms officers of the government of China) they kept their wars in Afghanistan a closely guarded secret. 51"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman When war broke out against the Br itish by tribes men under Dost Mohammed, it was passed off as a \"tribal skirmish\" in the British newspapers, if it was mentioned at all. A British force on a march to Kandahar was attack ed by Dost Mohammed's forces, which were beaten back, their lead er taken prisoner and exiled to India. In 1842, Sir Alexander Burns placed Shah Shuja on the throne again. London thought the action would placate the tribesmen, but, instead it led to a great deal of unrest culminating in the murder of Sir Alexander and a British envoy by the name of Sir William McNaughton. This was the signal for a general revolt against British rule, and Lord Auckland sent a British force of 16,000 British and Sepoy troops to occupy Kabul. But the revolt was so severe that the British forces had to retreat from Kabul to Kandahar. But on the road back, the British forces walked into an ambush by 3000 tribesmen who inflicted many casualties on them. Also killed was Shah Shuja, whom the trib esmen believed was a puppet for the British. The Afghanis now took control of the opium poppy fields and various warlords began asserting their control of the opium routes out of the country. Worse than that, they began exacting tribute from BEIC caravans crossing into India. Caravans of pack animals loaded with raw opium were attacked when tribute was not paid, and the opium stolen, with many killed by the warlords. It was dur ing these episodes that Rudyard Kipling wrote his tales of daring about the British forces guarding the route through the Khyber Pass. The ordinary British citizen thrilled to these tales of bravery. They had no idea that British soldiers were being sacrificed on behalf of a private multi-billion dollar enterprise, which had nothing to do with \"God, the Queen and Country.\" 52"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America During this period the warlords were loosely affiliated under the leadership of Akbar Kah n, son of Dost Mohammed. In 1842 a British Army force under the command of Sir George Pollock came up from India and retook Kabul. Hundreds of tribesmen thought to have part in the attack that cost the British Army so dearly, were summarily executed. Dorst Mohammed was again placed on the throne by Sir George. He at once set about defeating the opium tribal factions and punished those who had taken over BEIC poppy fields. Because of his \"noble\" work, on March 30, 1855, the British government signed the Treaty of Peshawar with Mohammed, thus enabling him to control Kandahar and Kabul, but not the important Helmet opium poppy cult ivations fields at Herat, which the Persians had seized from the BEIC. Even so, the BEIC trade of raw opium produ ced in Afghanistan began to rival that of the Ganges Valley and Benares. Britain thereupon declared war on Persia. The innocent British public was told that the war was over Persia trying to take over British colonial territory. By 1857 the Persians were beaten and opted for peace through a treaty si gned in Paris wherein they recognized the \"independence\" of Afghanistan and gave up claims to heart. British puppet Do st Mohammed was sent to take control of Herat, but tribal rivalry kept the area in turmoil for the next five years, with Dost only able to bring it under British jurisdiction in 1863. If the British learned anything at all about Afghanistan it was this: Never presume to have an area under control until every faction was in agreement with each other, and that could take a lifetime. Herat was a good example. It took a ten-month siege to pry loose th e hold of one of the tribesmen of the region.

When he could not get the tribes to agree on anything, Ali called on Russia for help, having lost faith in the British, and in June of 1878, a Russian mission under Gene ral Stolietov arrived in Kabul. The alarm was immediat ely sounded by BEIC and once again the parties went to war as Sher All refused to accept a British mission counter-offer. The war lasted for a year (1878- 1879) during which Sher Ali was ki lled. Deeply alarmed that the Russians might bring their lu crative opium trade with Afghanistan to a halt, British fo rces invaded the entire area under their puppet Yakub, son of Sh er Ali. British forces then spread out and garrisoned the w hole country. At that point a treaty was signed whereby the Br itish would pay a \"protection fee\" of $75,000 annually, to guarantee unmolested passage of the opium caravans through the Khyber Pass, where British troops were stationed to help enforce the agreement. Of course Rudyard Kipling's tales said nothing about why convoys were being guarded by Her Majesty's troops, and no doubt there would have been hell to play had the true mission of the troops been revealed. Basking in what they thought was a complete success of their mission to Kabul, the British forces began to relax their vigilance as there were no more raids on poppy fields and no attacks on convoys th rough the Khyber Pass. But there was a rude awakening for London lurking in the background. On September 3, 1879, Sir Louis Cava gnari (a scion of the old Black Nobility of Venice) was mu rdered along with his escort, and the country was once agai n plunged into another war.

The British were happy with the new man, who had great success in keeping the peace and imposing his authority on the ever bickering tribal factions. In this period of relative stabili ty, a vast amount of high-quality raw opium flowed out of the country into the storehouses of the BEIC. It is believed that dur ing this period, (1880-1891), billions of pounds flowed into the BEIC coffers, enough to pay ten times more than the cost of the Anglo-Boer War, which broke out in 1899. There was also a great deal of interference by Russia in an attempt to gain a foothold in Afghanistan and provide a buffer for its borders. Ru ssia did not have any interest in the opium trade; its sole concern was to gain a territorial buffer. Finally, after five years of severe problems with Britain, the two countries reached an acco rd in which Russia agreed to stay out of Afghan's affairs. Throughout its turbulent history, Afghanistan continued to produce some of the highest grades of raw opium, much sought after by Western users and the principle route through which this cargo was moved was through Pakistan. Afghanistan's history of opium is therefore tied tightly to the history of the opium trade in Pakistan and its transit routes to the coast and onwards to the Middle East and Western Europe. At the height of its power, BEIC received 4000 tons of opium every year from Afghanistan. The estimated value of this huge production in one year (1801) was $500 million, a staggering fortune in those days. Most of the opium was moved through the Khyber Pass into India (which part is today called Pakistan) 55"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman and thence down to the desolate Maccra coastline, where it is picked up by Arab dhows and take n to Dubai, there to be paid for in gold.

The Moslems of Afghanistan, unlike the Chinese worker class, do not use opium and thus did not become addicted to it. They were happy to produce crops of poppies, extract the opium sap, form in into crude opium and then sell it. Thus Afghanistan escaped the ravages of the terrible plague of addition to opium that eventually overcame China. Th en, as now, the business of growing the poppies and collecting the much-prized sap are the dominant occupation of the ma le population of Afghanistan. Secrets are carefully preserved, and as long as all things are equal, it will be thus until the end of time!

The United States believes that by its invasion and bombing, the country has been subdued, but in this the United States is sadly mistaken. Afghanistan is a country of warlords and competing factions all trying to get a share of the opium, a picture of confused loyalties and intense rivalries.

Mile after mile of poppy fields were burned along w ith stocks of the opium. Suddenly, the lords of the drug tr ade in the City of London and on Wall Street saw a huge loss of income looming, and the situation had to be dr astically turned around. I cannot say for certain how th e attack on the World Trade center came about, but one thing I do know is that the American people would never have accepted an invasion of Afghanistan by U.S. forces had it not been for the disaster of September 11, 2001, so it is more than likely th at history will reveal the 9/11 tragedy as a \"contrived situation. \" Much to the consternation of the banks in Dubai, and the opium traders in the United States and Britain, the Taliban cleare d out the warlords led by the Barakzai clan who had been pumping opium to the West and most of whom fled to Pakistan or into the mountainous sections of the country. The opium trade came to a screeching halt. The Taliban passed a decree that a nyone growing poppies or trading in opium would be shot. The warlord opium bosses scattered along with their criminal stooges. That sent the alarm bells ringi ng all over Westminster and New York.

That is why Pervez Musharraf was selected as our top \"ally in the war against terrorism.\" With the Taliban gone and the Barakzai clan once again in control, the opium trade is flour ishing in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban and it is unclear whether the new government will try to stop or at least curtai l it. We venture to suggest that under the rule imposed by the U.S ., opium trade will not only regain its past product ion, but also actually increase the amount of raw opium produced. In its annual report on the international drug trade, the State Department said the Taliban, driven out of power by the U.S. military in 2005, virtually eliminated opium poppy cultivation in the regi ons under their control. Overall opium production fell dramatically, to about 74 tons in 2001 from about 3,656 tons in 2000 and almost all the production was in parts of Afgha nistan held by the Northern Alliance, Washington's ally in the war against the Taliban.

A recently released U.S. report said wide spread cultivation of poppies resumed in Afghanistan after th e collapse of the Taliban and drug traffickers remained active in Afghanistan, this in spite of the massive on the ground presence of U.S. Armed Forces. Although the interim authority in Kabul, the Cheney, Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz puppet, Hamid Karzai (Barakzai) backed by the United States, announced its own ban on growing opium, the ban hardly ran beyond the capital and was not worth the paper it is was written on. Had Karzai tr ied to enforce his decree he would have been found one morning with his throat cut from ear to ear. His gangster dealers woul d never allow him to remain alive to interfere with their lucrative business. The report said: The Authority lacks means to en force its ban, and it must work with local power centers and the donor community if the ban is actually to be re spected. It remains uncertain whether the urgings and even the financial support of the international community will be sufficient to eliminate poppy cultivation in Afghanistan quickly . . .

It is worth recalling the history of the Golden Crescent drug trade, which is intimately related to the CIA's covert operations in the region since the onslaught of the Soviet-Afghan war and its aftermath. Prior to the Soviet-Afghan war (1979-1989), opium production in Afghanistan and Pakistan was directed to small regional markets. There was no local production of heroin. The Afghan narcotics economy was a carefully designed project of the CIA, supported by U.S. fo reign policy. As re vealed in the Iran-Contra and Bank of Commerce and Credit International (BCCI) scandals, CIA covert opera tions in support of the Afghan Mujahideen had been funded th rough the laundering of drug money. \"Dirty money\" was re cycled through a number of banking institutions (in the Middle East) as well as 78"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America through anonymous CIA shell companies, into \"covert money,\" used to finance various insurgent groups during the Soviet- Afghan war, and its aftermath. Because the U.S. wanted to supply the Mujahideen rebels in Afghanistan with Stinger anti- aircraft missiles and other milita ry hardware, it needed the full cooperation of Pakistan. By th e mid-1980s, the CIA operation in Islamabad was one of the largest U.S. intelligence stations in the World. \"If BCCI is such an embarrassment to the U.S. that forthright investigations are not being pursued it has a lot to do with the blind eye the U.S. turned to the heroin trafficking in Pakistan,\" said a U.S. intelligence officer. Researcher Alfred McCoy's study confirms that within two years of the onslaught of the CIA's covert operation in Afghanistan in 1979, that the Pakistan-Afghanistan borderlands became the world's top heroin producer, supplying 60 per cent of U.S. demand. In Pakistan, th e heroin-addict population went from near zero in 1979 to 1.2 million by 1985, a much steeper rise than in any other nation CI A assets again controlled this heroin trade. As the Mujahideen guerrillas seized territory inside Afghanistan, they ordered peas ants to plant opium as a revolutionary tax. Across the border in Pakistan, Afghan leaders and local syndicates under th e protection of Pakistan Intelligence operated hundreds of heroin laboratories. During this decade of wide-open dr ug-dealing, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in Islamabad failed to instigate even one major seizure or arrest. U.S. officials had refused to investigate charges of heroin dealing by its Afghan allies because U.S. narcotics policy in Afghanistan has been subordinated to the priorities of the war against Soviet influence there.

There was fallout in terms of drugs, yes. But the main objective was accomplished. The Soviets left Afghanistan. The role of the CIA, which is amply documented, is not mentioned in official UNODC publications, which focus on internal social and political factors. Needless to say, the historical roots of the opium tr ade have been grossly distorted. According to the UNODC, Afgha nistan's opium production has increased more than 15-fold since 1979. In the wake of the Soviet-Afghan War, the growth of the narcotics economy has continued unabated. The Taliban, supported by the U.S., were initially instrumental in the further growth of opiate production until the 2000 opium ban. This recycling of drug money was used to finance the post-Cold War insurgencies in Central Asia and the Balkans including al-Qaeda.

Narcotics: Second to Oil and the Arms Trade The revenues generated from the CIA sponsored Afghan drug trade are sizeable. The Afghan trade in opiates constitutes a large share of the worldwide annual turnover of narcotics, which was estimated by the United Nations to be of the order of $400- 500 billion. At the time these U.N. figures were first brought out (1994), the (estimated) global trad e in drugs was of the same order of magnitude as th e global trade in oil. 80"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America The IMF estimated global money laundering to be between 590 billion and 1.5 trillion dollars a year, representing 2-5 percent of global GDP.

Based on 2003 figures, drug trafficking constitutes \"the third biggest global commodity in cash terms after oil and the arms trade.\" The Independent, February 29, 2004. Moreover, the above figures including those on money laundering, confirm that the bulk of the revenues associated with the global trade in narcotics are not appropriated by terrorist groups and warlords, as suggest ed by the UNODC report. There are powerful business and financia l interests behind narcotics. From this standpoint, geopolitical and military control over the drug routes is as strategic as oil and oil pipelines. However, what distinguishes narcotics from legal commodity trade is that narcotics constitute a major source of wealth formation not only for organized crime, but also for the U.S. intelligence apparatus, which increasingly constitutes a powerful actor in the spheres of finance and banking. In turn, th e CIA, which protects the drug trade, has developed complex bus iness and undercover links to major criminal syndicates involved in the drug trade. In other words, intelligence agencies a nd powerful business syndicates allied with organized crime ar e competing for the strategic control over the heroin routes. The multi-billion dollar revenues of narcotics are de posited in the Western banking system.

In turn, the relationship among criminals, politicians and members of the intelligence establishment has tainted the structures of the state and the role of its institutions. This trade is characterized by a complex web of intermediaries. There are various stages of the drug trade, several interlocked markets, from the impoverished poppy farmer in Afghanistan to the wholesale and retail heroin mark ets in Western countries. In other words, there is a \"hierarc hy of price control\" for opiates. This hierarchy is acknowledged by the U.S. administration: Afghan heroin sells on the international narcotics market for 100 times the price farmers get for their opium right out of the field. U.S. State Department quoted by the Voice of America. According to the UNODC, opium in Afghanistan generated in 2003 ... an income of one billion U.S. dollars for farmers and U.S. $1.3 billion for traffickers, equivalent to over half of its national income. Consistent with these UNODC estimates, the average price for fresh opium was $350 a kg. (2002); the 2002 production was 3400 tons. UNDOC estimates, based on local farm and wholesale prices cons titute, however, a very small percentage of the total turnove r of the multibillion dollar Afghan drug trade. The UNODC estimates \"t he total annual turn-over of international trade\" in Afghan opiates at U.S. $30 billion. An examination of the wholesale and re tail prices for heroin in the Western countries suggests, howev er, that the total revenues generated, including those at the re tail level, are substantially higher. It is estimated that one kilo of opium produces approximately 100 grams of (pure) heroin. 82"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America The U.S. DEA confirms that SWA (South West Asia meaning Afghanistan) heroin in New York City was selling in the late 1990s for $85,000 to $190,000 per kilogram wholesale with a 75 percent purity ratio Since these figures were issued, sources say the prices for heroin ha ve shown a growth of 450%. According to the U.S. Drug En forcement Administration (DEA) \"the price of SEA (South East Asian) heroin ranges from $70,000 to $100,000 per unit (700 grams) and the purity of SEA heroin ranged from 85 to 90 percent.\" The SEA unit of 700 grams (85-90 % purity) translates into a wholesale price per kg. for pure heroin ranging between $115,000 and $163,000. The DEA figures quoted while reflectin g the situation in the 1990s are broadly consistent with 2002 British figures. According to a report published in the Gu ardian (August 11, 2002), the wholesale price of (pure) hero in in London (U.K.) was of the order of 50,000 pounds sterling, approximately $80,000 (2002). Whereas, as there is competition between different sources of heroin supply, it should be em phasized that Afghan heroin represents a rather small percentage of the U.S. heroin market, which is largely supplied out of Colombia. The New York Police Department (NYPD) notes that retail heroin prices are down and purity is relatively high. Heroin previously sold for about $90 per gram but now sells for $65 to $70 per gram or less. Anecdotal information from the NYPD indicates that purity for a bag of heroin commonly ranges from 50 to 80 percent but can be as low as 30 percent. Information as of June 2008 indicates that bundles (10 bags) purchased by Dominican buyers from Dominican sellers in larger quantities (about 150 bundles) sold for as little as $40 each, or $55 each in Central Park. The DEA reports th at an ounce of heroin usually sells for $2,500 to $5,000, a gram for $70 to $95, a bundle for $80 to $90, and a bag for $10. 83"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman The DMP reports that the averag e heroin purity at the street level in 1999 was about 62 percent. The NYPD and DEA retail price figures seem consistent. The DEA price of $70-$95, with a purity of 62 percent tr anslates into $112 to $153 per gram of pure heroin. The NYPD figures ar e roughly similar with perhaps lower estimates for purity. It should be noted that when heroin is purchased in very small quantities, the retail price tends to be much higher. In the U.S., purchase is often by \"the bag\" (the typical bag contains 25 milligrams of pure heroin). A $10 dollar bag in NYC (according to the DEA figure quoted above) would convert into a price of $400 per gram, each bag containing 0.025gr. of pure heroin. In other words, for very small purchases marketed by street pushers, the retail margin tends to be significantly higher. In the case of the $10 bag purchase, it is roughly 3 to 4 times the corresponding retail price per gram ($112-$153). In Britain, the retail street price per gram of heroin, according to British Police sources, \". . . fell from £74 in 1997 to £61 (in 2004).\" (I.e. from a pproximately $133 to $110, based on the 2004 rate of exchange) Independent, March 3, 2004.

(The report does not mention purity.) The street price of heroin was £80 per gram in April 2007 according to the National Criminal Intelligence Service. We are dealing with pric es, from the farm price in the producing country, upwards, to the final retail street price. The latter is often 80-100 times the price paid to the farmer. In other words, the opiate product transits through several markets from the producing country to the tran s-shipment countries, to the consuming countries.

In Afghanistan, the reported production of 3600 to ns of opium in 2003 would allow for the production of approximately 360,000 kg of pure heroin. Gross revenues accruing to Afghan farmers are roughly estimated by the UNODC to be of the order of $1 billion, with 1.3 billion accruing to local traffick ers. When sold in Western markets at a heroin wholesale price of the order of $100,000 a kg (with a 70 percent purity ratio), the global wholesale proceeds (corresponding to 3600 tons of Afghan opium) would be of the order of $51.4 billion dollars. The latter constitutes a conser vative estimate based on the various figures for wholesale pri ces in the previous section. The total proceeds of the Afghan narc otics trade (in terms of total value added) is estimated using the final heroin retail price. In other words, the retail value of the trade is ultimately the criterion for measuring the importa nce of the drug trade in terms of revenue generation and wealth formation. A meaningful estimate of the retail value, however, is almost impossible to ascertain due to the fact that re tail prices vary considerably within urban areas, from one city to another and between consuming countries, not to mention variations in purity and quality. The evidence on retail margins, namely the difference between wholesale and retail values in the consuming countries, nonetheless, suggests that a larg e share of the total (money) proceeds of the drug trade are generated at the retail level. In other words, a significant portion of the proceeds of the drug trade accrues to criminal and business syndicates in Western countries involved in the local wholesale and retail narcotics markets.

Under this assumption (simulation), a billion dollars gross revenue to the farmers in Afgha nistan (2003) would generate global narcotics earnings — accr uing at various stages and in various markets — of the or der of 79.2 billion dollars. These global proceeds accrue to business syndicates, intelligence agencies, organized crime, financial institutions, wholesalers, retailers, etc., involve d directly or indirectly in the drug trade. In turn, the proceeds of this lucrative trade are deposited in Western banks, which constitute an essential mechanism in the laundering of dirty money.

Two important members of government have resigned over this unwillingness to do anything at the top in the so-called war on drugs. An Attorney General was forced to resign because he was perceived to be in bed with the Mexican government, protecting them at the highest level. A President was forced out of office, because he dared to try and take on the t op people in the drug trade. The British moved their opium trade from Canton to Hong Kong, and thence to Panama, which is why it was so important to get General Noriega out of the way, permanently. Heroin flowed from Afghanist an through Pakistan via the desolate coast of Maccra across th e Red Sea to Dubai, where it was traded for gold. It flowed from Lebanon, from the Bekka Valley, controlled by Syria, which is why Syria's armed forces occupied Lebanon for so long; it flowed from the Golden Triangle of Burma and Thailand, and from the Golden Crescent in Iran, which is why the Shah was first deposed and then murdered when he found out what was going on and attempted to end it. This very real drug war against the United States is part of the One World Government conspirac y, a conspiracy that has its roots in the Committee of 300.

From the very start, \"Operation Snowcap\" was a fraudulent farce, intended it seems, to fool Congress and the American people into believing that the DEA was scoring great successes in this phony war. \"Operation Snowcap\" was like the Vietnam War. The United States has no intention of winning it. We dare not; the game is too big. This phony drug war is shot-through with deceit, lies, and hypocrisy. In short it is a waste of time and taxpayer's money, a cruel hoax, altogether meaningless. Just as the U.S. government was willing to sacrifice the lives of its servicemen in Vietnam, knowing all the while that we had no interest in defeating the enemy, thus was the government willing to sacrifice the lives of dedicated young DEA agents, several of whom died in the line of duty during \"Operation Snowcap.\" Lt. Colonel Oliver North has long been suspect in the opinion of a member of the U.S. Senate. The information I have about his actions in blowing a drug operatio n in Colombia, leads me to believe even more firmly that our government had no intention of winning its much advertised \"drug war.\" In many of my monographs on drugs, I wrote extensively about the Medellin Cartel and the Colombian cocaine barons. In this regard, at the risk of \"advertisi ng,\" I am going to say that I was in the vanguard of disclosing the name \"Medellin Cartel\" and the whole Colombian cocaine trade in general. Contrary to popular be lief, the bulk of cocaine is not processed in Colombia, but comes from Bolivia.

If one wants to buy cocaine, one has to travel to Bolivia. In the case involving Oliver North, Bobby Seale, a deep cover agent who had penetrated the Medellin cartel, believed that the Medellin Cartel was actually bribing Daniel Ortega, head of the Sandinista. He turned the information over to the DEA and they gave it to North. It provided Nort h with a golden chance to back up his glowing words with deeds. Instead, he chose to doubt the information provided by Seale, whom history will show was the most effective undercover DEA officer ever in place in Colombia. North then told the DEA he wanted Seale to ferry cash to the Contras. I could never imagine why North would want to remove Seale from his dynamic role; here was a man who was really fighting a drug war for our side. When Seale refused to be seconded to North, he leaked the Seale story to the press. What was the outcome? Possibly the best opera tion ever mounted by the DEA was destroyed and Seale was murd ered by Medellin Cartel hit men, after being stripped of pr otection and his address made public through a judge's order. You don't believe me? Since my expose, a full length movie was made in which the story is portrayed exactly as I set it out 4 years before Seale was murdered. It is not my wish to sit in judgment upon Lt. Colonel North, but leaking the Seale story to the jackals of the American media ranks in treachery to the way in which the New York Times leaked our satellite codes to the Soviet Union via one of its reporters, Richard Burt. At the very least, North has a lot of explaining to do. In my view No rth ranks only one step above a \"dirt bag,\" street slang for an in former.

This is not the only time evidence has emerged that our government is not fully at war against drugs. In another Colombian case involv ing the Medellin Cartel, one of its top Bolivian suppliers, Roberto Suarez lost 850 pounds of cocaine and two of his top drug he nchmen who were arrested in a Miami bust. Suarez had an income of $1 million a day, and it was steady income at this level. He was more of the ruler of Bolivia than its President. High-level government figures in Latin America showed up repeatedly in documentation for this case. Shortly after the arrest of two top Suarez \"drug diplomat s,\" the most terrifying coup was launched against the Bolivian government, which was backed by the DEA and the CIA. The coup succeeded, and cost the lives of thousands of people and ended with Bolivia becoming the principal cocaine supplier for Colombia. Perhaps this is why charges against th e two Suarez \"drug diplomats\" arrested in Miami were dropped and bail mysteriously lowered for the third man, thereby enabling them to fly home the same day. Now remember, these were not your average NBC Nightly News small time dealers. These men were at the very top of the drug cartel, so it was not a problem to put up the lesser amount of bail money and leave the U.S. Was th is only a coincidence? Those who have unwarranted faith in our government and our President may like to believe it wasn't anyt hing but an accident, but with hundreds of similar cases going wrong, how can we trust our government? Apparently I am not alone in my suspicions.

Facts and circumstances appear to give strong backing to Von Raabs grievous charges. Mexico responds routinely to charges that its highest officials are up to their hocks in the drug trade by saying \"give us proof so that we can investigate your charges.\" Every time an opportunity arises to provide proof, mysterious forces inside our government step in and thwart the action. One such case involved a certain Hector Alvares, a member of the press corps of former President Salinas de Goltari. Alvares and another front man, Pablo Giron, told a DEA deep cover agent posing as a big buyer of cocaine, that he could make arrangements with the Mexican government to ferry shipments of Bolivian cocaine destined for the U.S. through Mexico. This was during the preliminary discu ssions of a \"buy\" of Bolivian cocaine base. Giron said he had a direct line to Mexican General Poblana Silvo, who would act on his (Giron's) phone call. Giron told a DEA agent (who has sworn to this) that he was very close to Salinas de Gotta ri. A Customs informant also swore to being told that Alvarez was in a Secret Service detail to protect President-elect Goltari. In that particular proposed \"buy,\" sixteen tons of cocaine was involved. This was totally separate from \"Operation Snowcap.\" During the discussions in Panama, Alfredo Duncan, the DEA agent in charge in Panama, let it be known to a number of DEA agents and Customs agents that General Manuel Noriega was \"a DEA man.\" This was confirmed at least three times in letters from John Lawn, head of the DEA in Washington. Two others involved with Alva rez were the Bolivians Ramon and Vargas, who owned a cocaine laboratory in Bolivia that regularly produced 200 kilos of cocaine per month. Eventually, 108"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America the DEA agent \"buyer,\" a contract pilot and a customs agent, gained the confidence of the Bolivians and were invited to inspect their facilities deep in the Bolivian jungles. What they found left them staggering drunk with amazement. They discovered seven airstrips fully capable of handling 747s, next to very large underg round laboratories and support buildings, an amazing complex, guarded by heavily armed troops. The transaction they were involved in called for the purchase of 5000 tons of cocaine. Yet in all of the years that \"Snowcap\" had been operating, the DEA had come nowhere near to getting even close to the Bolivian facilities. When the deep cover agent aske d Ramon and Vargas if they were not afraid of \"Operation Snowcap,\" they simply laughed. Ramon and Vargas had good reason to be filled with mirth. \"Operation Snowcap\" was a burea ucratic nightmare. All the wrong equipment was sent to Boliv ia, most of it useless, and a lot more \"bungles\" Vargas said. No one in Bolivia was in the least bit concerned about \"Operation Snowcap.\" The aircraft allotted to \"Snowcap\" did not have the range needed to reach the jungle facilities and the few helicopters were completely inadequate for the job. Was this just another of many \"bungles?\" I do not believe it was simply a bureaucratic bungle. From information I gleaned, it would appear that these \"mistakes\" were deliberate sabotage. For one thing, the firepower of the DEA agents could not hope to match the military-style capabilities of \"the Corporation.\" In 1988 the DEA spent one hundred million dollars on \"Operation Snowcap.\" What did we get for it?

Why didn't we just go out and buy the cocaine at a far cheaper price -- which we could have done — as the deep cover agent had begged everyone in Washington to be allowed to do? The answer is that the DEA refused to put up the money for a buy that would not only have netted a huge amount of fully processed cocaine, but also four of the Bolivian \"The Corporation's\" top executive officers. It would also have provided the United States with th e proof it heretofore lacked of Mexican government involvement at the highest level. ■ Why did the DEA refuse to put up the money? ■ Why did the Assistant U.S. A ttorney in San Diego refuse to grant a wiretap, which would have snared Mexican General Poblano Silva, whom Giron was about to call on the phone and implicate in a massive cocaine buy? ■ Why did Attorney General Edwin Meese get on the phone to the Mexican Attorney General and warn him of the coming DEA operation that would have resulted in General Poblano Silva being implicated in a major Bolivian cocaine distribution plot? ■ Customs Commissioner William von Raab is said to have resigned in disgus t over the Meese telephone warning - And what of our \"drug war\" in Colombia?

The so-called \"peace initiatives\" are nothing but a complete capitulation to the Colombian dr ug lord's demands. There would be no more talk of extradition to the United States. That much emerged from a five-day visit to Washington by Gaviria, during which the Bush administration gave its seal of approval of the sell-out to the cocaine barons.

The Drug Abuse Warning Network reports that drug overdos es are not down, as contended by the Bush administration; rather they have largely gone unreported because hospital budgets have been so badly slashed that there is no money to hire the necessary staff to monitor overdose cases.

Some $6 billion in unreported money went from the U.S. to Panama in that year alone. My sources say that since the kidnapping of General Norieg a, Banco Nacional de Panama has reached an all-time high in cash flow. This should have troubled the Bush administration, but there have been few, if any, signs of concern from the White House. The banking structure in Panama was set up by Nicolas Ardito Barletta.

Readers should understand what I am talking about here. I am not talking about companies that don't live up to expectations, I am not talking about companies that sometimes make considerable losses like \"safe\" ni ce General Motors for instance, that do not always come up to snuff. No, I am talking about a giant entity that always makes huge profits, year after year after year and never disappoints its \"investors.\" In 2007 the offshore dope trade exceeded $500 billion per annum and is growing annually. In 2005 the figure was estimated at $200 billion by the DEA, not a bad \"growth\" rate on a relatively small \"investment.\" This huge amount of cash remains outside the laws of all countries as it crosses international boundaries with impunity. Is the drug business conducted in the \"bootlegging\" manner? Do sinister-looking men travel around with suitcases stuffed with $100 dollar bills? They do on rare occasions, but mainly the dope business can only be transacted with the witting and willing co-operation of international banks and their allied financial institutions. It is really as simple as that. Close down the drug banks, and the drug trade will begin to dry up as law enforcement agencies pounce on the drug barons pushed into the open through being forced to use desperate, and for them, dangerous alternative methods. In other words, close up the rat holes and it will be easier to get rid of the rodents. While it is gratifying to note as we do from time to time have drug arrests made and large 119"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman amounts of dope seized by the author ities, this is only a drop in the ocean compared with the total volume. They come about as the result of informing on \"unregistered\" competitors. Such \"busts\" represent far less than the proverbial tip of the iceberg. And with their private intellig ence systems, often far more sophisticated than those of most smaller countries, the big drug barons and their bankers usually stay several steps ahead of law enforcement agencies. The path to successfully comba ting the drug menace, which is a greater danger to civilization than was the Black Death of the Middle Ages, lies through the marbled lobbies and beautifully decorated banking halls of the world. We are approaching the problem from the most difficult an gle. We are trying to catch the operators, instead of going after the financiers. British banks have been in control of offshore drug banking for centuries, as indeed they have been in charge of the diamond and gold trades, both intimately connected with the heroin trade. That is why Queen Victoria sent the most powerful army in the world at that time (1899) to crus h the two tiny Boer Republics in South Africa; simply to gain co ntrol of their gold and diamonds, which Lord Palmerston, Sir Al fred Milner and Joseph Chamberlain saw as an excellent way to finance their business without the possibility of tracing payments back to the source. This is still the medium by whic h the Hong Kong heroin trade is largely financed. After all, gold and diamonds are impersonal. It explains why Queen Elizabet h was more often than not at loggerheads with Mrs. Thatcher over policy matters. The Queen wanted an end to the South Afri can Government and its antidrug stands. The Queen wanted to se nd a Mr. Furhop in there to run things the way he runs affairs for her in Rhodesia (now 120"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America Zimbabwe). Furhop is the real name of her court messenger, better known as \"Tiny\" Rowland, who heads the giant conglomerate LONRHO of wh ich she is the principle stockholder through Angus Ogilvie, her first cousin. In a sense, South Africa and Panama were both under siege for the same reasons. The South Africans were standing in the way of a take-over of their treasure trove of gold and diamonds by the oligarchist- aristocracy and in the case of Panama, their treasured bank secrecy was being torn apart by General Noriega. The powers that be are hardly likely to take these reverses lying down! To give some idea of what is at stake in Panama, the DEA estimates that close to $350 million pe r day changes hands through teletype bank transfers. This is called \"Interbank Money Some fifty percent of Interbank money is derived from the dope trade goes to the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, Andorra, Panama, Hong Kong and the Swiss banks who handle this vast flow of money. As a spin-off of the dope tr ade, we have to contend with the burden of \"floating currency exchange rates.\" This destabilizing effect was brought on by the huge volume of cash, which our system was not designed to handle; there is no way that fixed rates of exchange could handle the vast and rapid transfer of money under fixed parities around the world in one day. The \"economists\" sold us a false bill of goods when they approved the policy of \"floating\" exchange rates, and they invented all sorts of economic jargon to cover the real reason viz - the huge flow of dope cash! With a very large part of this money flowing into Panama, it was necessary to have an asset in Panama who could be trusted to maintain bank secrecy of the tightest order.

Thanks to the treachery of sold-out servants of the CFR in the Senate, men like Dennis De Concini and Richard Lugar, Panama passed into the hands of General Torrijos at the cost of millions of dollars to the U.S. taxpayer. But Torrijos, like so many of us mortals, quickly forgot who hi s \"maker\" was, and the gods of Olympus were forced to remove him from the scene. Torrijos was duly assassinated in August 1981. Ostensibly he was killed in a plane crash, which closely resembles the type of \"accident,\" which overtook the son of Aristotle Onassis. What happened was that an unknow n person or persons altered the mechanics of the wing flaps, so that when lowered for a landing, they actually made the plane fly upwards. Torrijos was originally handpicked by Kissinge r in the manner to which we are now accustomed. When he began taking his role as a Panamanian \"nationalist\" seriou sly instead of ventriloquist's dummy, he had to go. Kissinger go t himself appointed to head the President's Bipartisan Committee on Central America; another of Reagan's broken promis es. This strengthened his hold on Panama, or so he thought.

But Torrijos had other ideas. He wanted to join the Contadora Group seeking to brin g stability and solutions to poverty in the region through real industrial progress. Now I am not committed to the Contadoras; there are many areas where I differ from them. But one cannot deny that the Contadoras by and large are committed to fight the drug economy planned for Central America along the lines of Jamaica's Ganja economy. This so-called \"free trade\" idea is supported by members of the Mont Pelerin Society, notably Cisneros of Venezuela and the Venetian Cini Foundation. For this reason and for threatening to expose the Rockefeller banking set-up in Panama, Torrijos was \"permanently immobilized,\" in telligence parlance for murdered. As I have said before, we ar e not talking about small-time dealers or street pushers, which Hollywood delights to portray as the drug trade. We are talking major banks and financial institutions; we are talking top people; we are talking about nations that support and shelter the drug barons, countries like Cuba; and we are talking about an organization so strong and powerful that it has brought an entire country to its knees, the Republic of Colombia. I am going to be writing about U. S. State Department complicity in hindering the war on drugs. I am going to talk about Nancy Reagan's unbelievably stupid response \"Just Say No\" to this menace. When compared with wh at is transpiring today, the volume of heroin flowing thr ough the \"French Connection\" was strictly penny ante stuff. Yet, we must never lose sight of the fact that ex-President Richard Nixon was the only President to firmly tackle the drug menace th reatening the U.S. The \"French Connection\" was a Nixon endeavor from start to finish.

The \"Circl e of Initiates,\" who founded the Royal Institute for International Affairs has not changed its direction. It is worth repeating that the drug trade is firmly controlled by the descendants and families who intermarried, and who comprise this inner s ecret society membership, who can trace their lineage to Lords Alfred Milner, Gray, Balfour, Palmerston, Rothschild and othe rs at the top of Debrett's Peerage and America's Social Register. Their banks and the American banks are no small fry. In fact the smaller banks have been weeded out or are in the process of being weeded out with witting or perhaps unwitting help of the U.S. Treasury Department. This is particularly evident in Florida, where starting in 1977 big banks like the Standard and Chartered Bank, Bank Hapolum, we ll-known as banks involved in laundering dirty dope money, mo ved into Florida where the \"action\" was. The \"big boys\" then began informing on small banks used by small independent cocaine dealers. Remember, the drug monopolists have their ow n highly efficient intelligence network. The Treasury went after the small banks, but left the big ones alone. When big banks are caught, which has happened on a few occasions, they are dealt with in a most lenient fashion. Witness the case of Credit Suisse in Geneva and First Bank of Boston. This most venerable of Boston's banks was caught red handed laundering dope money in conjunction with Credit Suisse.

Credit Suisse remains one of the largest and most efficient dope money laundering banks after American Express — the \"untouchables\" of the banking world. Other major banks involved in the lucrative dirty-money business of dope were National Westminster, Barclays, Midlands Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada. The Royal Bank of Canada and the National Westminster Bank were the key drug bankers for the dope barons in the Caribbean Islands David Rockefeller's much vaunted \"C aribbean Basin Initiative.\" Working through the IMF, Kissinger ordered Jamaica to grow a \"free enterprise\" crop of ganja (marijuana) which today accounts for the bulk of Jamaica's foreign exchange earnings. The same thing happened in Guyana, which is why Jim Jones moved there — except that Jones was unaware of the true purpose of his manipulators. As part of a massi ve brainwashing experiment of the Vacaville type, Jones never di d reach his goal. He died in total ignorance of those w ho were pulling his strings. Jamaica is just one of the countries run on dope money. When he was in charge of Jamaica, Edward Seaga quite brazenly told American newspapers, notably the Washington Post, that whether it is accepted or not \"the industry, as such, is here to stay. It is just not possible to wipe it out.\" I have no quarrel with the \"here to stay\" bit. Using rock and roll \"music\" as its vehicle for the spread of \"recreationa l drugs\" and protected at the highest levels, the drug trade ind eed seems destined to stay on.

As one of the spin-offs of the \"meat-grinder war\" between Iran and Iraq, the sale of heroin from which diacecyl morphine is derived skyrocketed. Most of the proceeds of this trade found its way into Panamanian banks, the \"overlap\" with Hong Kong, which I mentioned earlier. There are officially 2.6 million heroin addicts in Iran of which 1.5 million are in the army, where soldiers-addicts can get it on request. One recalls, that the British oligarchy tried the same deal during the War Between the States, the Civil War, but did not have any success. Not only has heroin money fueled the Gulf War, it also fuels \"freedom fighters\" outfits, a term used by George Shultz to describe the murderous African National Congress (ANC), Basque Separatis ts (ETA), the Irish Republic Army (IRA), the Sikh separatist movement, the Kurds et al. The funds, derived from the sale of opium and cocaine, are channeled to these terrorist organizations through the World Council of Churches. From the foregoing it becomes clear why Panama is so important to the supra-nationa l One World forces. Panama's banking system was set up by David Rockefeller to be a convenient banking depository for dope trade money. Panama was adjudicated the banking cente r for cocaine, while Hong Kong remained the heroin-opium center. Panama's banking system was restructured according to Rockefeller's blueprint by Nicholas Ardito Barletta, a form er director of the World Bank, and a director of the Marine Midland Bank, which was taken over by the king of drug banks, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, Barletta was acceptable because of his \"respectable\" 126"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America image and experience in handli ng vast amounts of dope cash. In 1982, the Treasury Department estimated that the Banco Nacional de Panama had increased its cash flow of dollars by nearly 500 percent between 1980 and 1984. Some $6 billion in unreported money went from the U.S. to Panama during this four-year period alone. Former President Alan Garcia of Peru, who led an all-out war against the dope barons, addressed the United Nations on September 23, 1998, on this subject and listed Peru's successes and victories in the war on drugs. He went to say: We could therefore ask the American administration if we have done that in fifty days, wh at it is doing for the human rights of the individual keeling over in Grand Central Station and so many other places, and wh en will it legally and in a Christian fashion, fight to eradicate the consumption?

Kissinger thereupon delivered a message to Paredes. In an amazing \"about-face,\" General Paredes suddenly began supporting Kissinger's Andean Plan to turn Central America into another Vietnam for the U.S. military, abandoning support for Contadora policies. Although it has many flaws, basically the Contadora Group was aware of the Kissinger \"Trojan horse\" in Central America, and it tried hard to prevent a Vietnam-style conflict from developing in the region. Henry Kissinger and the U.S. State Department had previously promoted Paredes as a \"Panama nationalist, a staunch anti-Communist friend of America.\" On a Kissinger sponsored visit to Washington D.C. Paredes was escorted around by Kissinger in person. Six months after the murder of Torrijos, General Paredes took command of the National Guard. Thereafter, Paredes openly praised The FARC terrorists of Colombia, and sabotaged Contadora's efforts to arrive at a peaceful solution to the problems of the region. He also took great pains to cultivate the friendship of Anulfo Arias, whom the Washington Post, the New York Times and surprisingly, Senator Jesse Helms, held up as the rightful heir to the leadership of Panama, whose position was allegedly usurped by General Noriega. Strangely enough, during the Panama Canal Treaty hearings, the media jackals said nothing about Torrijos usurping Anulfo Arias's \"rightful\" position! A lot of nonsense was been talked about Arias being a \"Nazi\" and therefore unworthy to lead Panama. This kind of anti-German propaganda is not worthy of comment.

The loss of Panamanian support was a big blow to the aspirations of the Contador as. It meant that Panama would remain a \"wide open\" center for financing sales of weapons to the region, notably supplied by Israel under an agreement reached between local leaders and the late Ariel Sharon, a former business partner of Kissinger. Apart from threats for which Kiss inger is notorious, the IMF had a hand in blackmailing Paredes. My sources told me that Kissinger let it be known, that the IMF stand-by agreement to restructure Panama's $320 million debt might not hold good if Paredes fell out with his master. Paredes \"got the message.\" The IMF immediately began a struggl e with General Noriega who told the Panamanian people in a televised address on March 22, 1986, that the IMF is strangling Panama. President Eric Delville unfortunately backed IMF austerity packages, which were designed to weaken labor union support for Noriega. The CONATO labor federation then began threatening to break with General Noriega, unless the IMF dictates were ignored. General Manuel Noriega, while still Colonel Noriega, was chief of the anti-narcotics bureau in Panama and battled for ten years to keep the Panama National Guard free of the taint of corruption that follows in the wake of dope money, as surely as day follows night. With the Ochoa and Escobar families virtually taking over Panama, this was no mean feat. Noriega's anti-drug struggle was confirmed by John C. Lawn, head of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). Lawn was not known for flowery speeches nor writing lette rs of commendation. His letter to General Noriega was therefor e all the more remarkable, in that it lavished praise on him in an unstinting manner. 129"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Here is an excerpt from that lette r, which is representative of the manner, and style in which it is couched: I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my deep appreciation for the vigorous anti-drug trafficking policy that you have adopted, which is reflected in the numerous expulsions from Panama of accused traffickers, the large seizures of cocaine and precursor chemicals that have occurred in Panama and the eradication of marijuana cultivation in Panama territory. Neither the Washington Post nor the New York Times saw fit to reprint this commendation, which appeared in a newspaper in Peru. I will go back to the subject of the DEA and John C. Lawn later, because of its vital significance. The only thing the Washington Post did to counter this fine testimonial was to publish untruths by its so-called \"intelligence expert,\" Seymour Hersh, who wrote an article in which he stated that General Noriega was a \"double agent\" for the CIA, feeding it with information he received from Cuba. This is a ploy well- known to genuine intelligence people. The purpose of such \"disclosures\" would be to get Cuban DGI secret service assassins to murder General Noriega on the pretext, that he \"double- crossed Cuba.\" This would dr aw attention away from the Kissinger-bankers gang if the assassination attempt were to prove successful. Hersh's information and stories have often not been very accurate and the Noriega \"disclosure\" should be seen for what it was; a possible set-up for an assassination attempt on General Noriega.

In the Caribbean and Panama, anti-drug forces were faced with a consortium made up of Coudert Brothers law firm in the person of Sol Linowitz.

Kissinger's A ndes Plan was being stymied by General Noriega and he came under fire because of his antidrug stance. The outcome in Panama could be foretold. Rockefeller's Caribbean Basin Initiative amounted to handing Fidel Castro a dope empire worth at least $35 billion per annum, which had no intention of giving it up without a struggle. In Colombia, David Rockefeller and Kissinger created \"a state within a state,\" where Carlos Lederer — until his arrest — was a kingpin in the Ochoa and Escobar clans who virtually ruled the whole country. In downtown Bogota, half the city's magistrates were executed by the drug barons ' private MI9 Guerilla army also known as (FARC). The assault was an outright act of anarchy that left Colombia in a state of numbed fear. What was behind all the frantic activity, which in reality was a revoluti on? Quite simply — it was cash, wave and wave of cash, flowing into the offshore havens of the Caribbean and Panama. The DEA es timates that Colombia alone banked $39 billion in cash from 1980-2006. The DEA and the Treasury believed that Panama had become the banking capital of the cocaine world, and I have no quarrel with its assessment.

This left Eisenmann and his colleagues reeling. No one had expected that any se rious action could or would ever be taken against the internationa l community controlling 80% of Panama's economy, which \"interests\" had founded a \"Switzerland in Panama,\" following the changes made by Nicholas Barletta. It therefore amazed this elite community of narcotics traffickers and bankers, when Noriega provided this information to the DEA, which resulted in the arrest of major cocaine baron Jorge Ochoa in Sp ain. The Panama establishment was jolted by these developments. Eisenmann became a vociferous critic of Noriega, accusing him of destroying Panama's econo my, even accused him of being implicated in the cocaine trade, when in fact it was Eisenmann who worked closely with the Colombian cocaine barons. Eisenmann was one of a gaggle of drug barons, bankers, lawyers and newspaper editors, whose pro-democracy rhetoric was designed to cover their tracks, which, had the truth been unveiled, would have led their tracks straight to cocaine dirty money laundering. Eisenmann, wh o led the attack on Noriega for 12 years, was the first choice of the U.S. State Department to head up the government it intend ed placing in power once Noriega was ousted.

In the Mike Wallace TV interview, Noriega made it clear that Poindexter had come as a bully demanding that Panama bow down to the colonialist de mands of the Olympians (The Committee of 300). I was not against Nicaragua be ing invaded by U.S. military forces; but another Vietnam-styl e war would only have played into the hands of One World Gove rnment and the traitors within our gates. Poindexter was back ed by the U.S. media who went as far as to advocate that Nori ega be removed by force. When 138"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America he answered Poindexter's threats with a firm rebuff, Noriega knew that the chips were down. He thereupon sought an alliance with and support from the Peronistas. At a meeting with Peronista leaders, which took place at Mar del Plata, Argentina, Noriega and his deputation of mi ddle-level officers received the assurances they were looking fo r. But it was not long before counter-measures were taken to scare the Argentineans away. British troops mounted \"exercises\" in the Malvinas to show what would happen if Argentina intervened in Panama's affairs, and General John Calvin, chief of the U.S. military southern area command, went to meet with Argentine Defense Minister Horacio Juanarena. Ostensibly the meeting dealt with British threats and growing tensions between the two countries over the Malvinas. General Galvin delivered a stern warning to Juanarena for Argentina not to get involved in Panama. Galvin's mission to Buenos Aires could quite proper ly have been compared with General Hauser's mission to Te hran during the period that former President Jimmy Carter was betraying the Shah of Iran. DEA drug operation coming on the heels of a three-year investigation carried out under the code name \"Operations Pisces,\" showed that the drug barons and their supporters were the beneficiaries of enormous profits. Up to 1985 nobody had seriously troubled them. But in 1985, where before it seemed only vaguely possible that seldom used laws might become a bother to be dealt with by intimidation, bribery and corruption, Noriega was now showing that he could not be threatened or bought, and that he meant business. \"Operations Pisces\" closed down 54 accounts in 18 Panamanian banks and resulted in the se izure of $10 million and large quantities of cocaine. It was la ter established, that the banks 139"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman were warned by some in the PDF and were able to move large amounts of cash before being ra ided. This was followed by the freezing of another 85 accounts in banks whose deposits were believed to be stained with blood and cocaine, an action carried out by the Panama Defense Force (PDF). Fifty-eight major Colombian, U.S. and some C uban-American \"runners\" were arrested and indicted on narc otics trafficking charges. \"Operations Pisces\" was ma de possible by passage of Panamanian Law 23, which gave notice of what the narcotics traffickers could expect in future . La Prensa complained bitterly that the Panama Defense Force was conducting a publicity campaign against drugs on behalf of the American Government, a campaign that \"will devastate the Panamanian banking center.\" Jose Blandon Enter Jose Blandon, now turned 180 degrees by the pro-drug consortium. What was the role assigned to Blandon in the unfolding war against anti-cocaine forces? He was hired to drum up so-ca lled \"international support\" for Elliott Richardson-Sol Linowitz faction trying to bring down General Noriega. In so doing, Blandon exposed himself as a hypocritical unmitigated liar. Bl andon served Willie Brandt's Socialist Internati onal (also known in some circles as The Partnership). Before taking up his post as chief accuser of Noriega, Blandon, who was the New York Consul General for Panama, went on Panama TV on August 11, 1987 in support of Noriega. He vehemently attacked the forces ranged against General Noriega — characterizing the hostility as a campaign essentially aimed at the liquidation of Jose Blandon. Let us take a closer look at the State Department's \"Panama\" spokesman. Shortly after his televi sion appearance in favor of 140"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America Noriega, in fact in less than a month, Blandon was seized upon by the Eastern Liberal Establishment in the persons of Shultz, Kissinger and Elliot Abrams and told to stop backing the wrong horse. According to intelligence reports, Blandon was left in no uncertainty as to what the future held for Noriega. He was quite bluntly told to \"join the winning team\" or find hims elf out in the cold when the \"new government \" was ushered in. Blandon, who has always been a self-seeki ng individual, lost no time in changing course and jumping on the \"get Noriega\" bandwagon. Shortly after switching sides, Blandon announced that he was \"gathering support from the in ternational community against General Noriega.\" He was thereupon summarily dismi ssed from his consular post. No government can afford to have its representatives conspiring with \"foreign forces advoca ting its overthrow.\" Blandon was immediately supported by the State Department and the U.S. news media. He was touted by Dr. Norman Bailey as a respectable Panamanian official of high rank, who had really startling information to impart about Noriega's alleged \"drug trafficking.\" I cannot be complete ly certain that Blandon was not immediately given financial support by Bailey, the Civic Crusade and Sol Linowitz, but Washington said he received some information that would tend to confirm Blandon was a paid hireling of Linowitz, No rman Bailey and the Civic Crusade. Miami lawyer Ray Takiff, who represented General Noriega in the U.S. said quite simply that Blandon was a liar in the pay of the U.S. Government. One of Blandon's controllers was William G. Walker, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Affairs, who later played a dirty role in bringing down the government of Serbia. According to reports I receive d, it was Walker who coached Blandon regarding his testimony before the mud-slinging anti- 141"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Noriega Senate Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Operations. Walker was later to play a key role in the destruction of Serbian leader Milosevic that brought the downfall of country w ith the resultant takeover by a Muslim government from Albania. Blandon was known for his wild swings from one subject to another, not to mention changing horses in mid-stream. Walker wanted to be sure that Blandon did not stray into areas that might lead to complications, while testifying before the \"open and shut\" committee in the manner of Rodriguez Milian's embarrassing expose of the l eading American banks. Lewis Galindo of the Civic Crusade, with whom we are now familiar, was another Blandon \"coach\" along with Walker and Dr. Norman Bailey. Galindo spent a lot of time telling Blandon to stick to the point, while giving his testimony to the eager \"get Noriega\" Senate Subcommittee. The committee must have been familiar with Blandon's penchant for twisting \"facts\" in the same way they must have known about his rather dubious \"high level international contacts.\" Yet the Senate Subc ommittee presented Blandon as its star witness against Noriega most of the time during the February 8 through 11 sessions. Th is should deeply disturb all patriots who value our institutions and traditions. The attack on Noriega has degraded and debased our institutions, not to mention casting grave doubts on our justice system. Desiring to make the most of Blandon's testimony, although it would never have stood up for more than a few minutes under court rules of evidence, and under cross- examination, the committee members listened eagerly to his rambling, contradictory diatribe against General Noriega. Even with such a wide margin of latitude with committee members 142"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America bending over backwards to be solicitous, Blandon cut as sorry a figure as the criminals Floyd Ca rlton and Milian Rodriguez, who were called as prosecution witnesses. The proceedings were reminiscent of \"show trials\" and have no place in the American system. If this is what our politicians call \"open government,\" then God help America. Could the subcommittee hearings be classifi ed as a \"trial?\" I tend to believe, that it was a trial of General Noriega, although subcommittee chairman John Kerry categorically dismissed this when it was put to him. Kerry paraded Blandon before the committee as one parades a dog around the ring at a dog show. When Blandon began to babble incoherently, Kerry on numerous occasions said \"stay boy — not so fast.\" This is the same John Kerry who was to make a run for the presidency of the United States. Thank God he was defeated. Kerry made sure that Blandon's recent television speech in support of Noriega was not br ought up. During that speech Blandon said that charges against the PDF's commander were \"fabrications\" and vehemently de nied that any PDF officers were involved in narcotics tra fficking. Now this may be good politics, but it makes for poor justice. In the end, unable to follow his own ramblings, Bla ndon contradicted himself and gave such widely differing accoun ts of the same events, that even the jackals of the media, notably Time Magazine, were grudgingly forced to admit that Blandon's credibility was non existent! But not with John Kerry, who could not afford to lose his Star Chamber witness. Where did came Blandon's \"facts\" about Noriega's involvement in dope trafficking come from? Careful analyses prepared by specialists in this field showed a striking similarity between phrases and words used by No rman Bailey, Lopez Michelson, 143"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Roberto Eisenmann, Lewis Galindo and many of the words and expressions used by Blandon. So it appears that these men might have been putting words in Blandon's mouth. Millionaire Galindo, who is supposed to have made his fortune out of real estate, and Eisenmann of La Prensa we have already met, but it is useful and necessary to mention in passing, that Galindo enjoys the confidence of Trilateral Commission's Sol Linowitz and his close associate, Dr. Norman Bailey. Lopez Michelson Lopez Michelson was President of Colombia from 1974-1978, during which period he became ve ry friendly with Fidel Castro who resettled Carlos Lederer afte r he was forced by DEA agents to flee the Bahamas. It was Michelson's finance minister, Rodrigo Bolero Montoya, who ma de it easy for the cocaine barons to deposit their dope dollars by opening the \"sinister window\" at Colombia's national bank as part of Michelson's oversight activities on behalf of cocaine barons Ochoa, Lederer and Escobar. Lopez Michelson ev en tried to legalize the dope barons in exchange for their offer to pay-off Colombia's external debt obligations! Nicolas Ardito Barletta Another of the State Department 's hired lackeys was Nicolas Ardito Barletta. Friend and confidant of Norman Bailey of the National Security Council and h ead of the NSC-CIA \"banker's branch,\" close to Sol Linowitz and William Colby, Barletta was obviously an important ally of the \"get Noriega\" faction. I have already mentioned that Panama became a haven for dope traffickers and their money laundering banks shortly after Blandon enacted strict bank secrecy laws: just in time for the cocaine trade \"boom.\" His bank secrecy legislation was never challenged - until General Noriega took on this awesome responsibility. No wonder Blandon has allied himself with his 144"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America enemies. Blandon was known in Washington as the Panama \"banker's man.\" Steven Sarnos Identified as a narcotics trafficker, Sarnos appeared to enjoy surprisingly ready access to administration officials like Admiral Poindexter, and notables like Barletta. Sarnos was part of the group made up of Eisenmann, Galindo and others, who started the slander campaign against Noriega. It seems that Sarnos was another of Jose Blandon's many \"coaches.\" Sarnos travels to see his high-le vel U.S. connections under the protection of the Federal witne ss program. Perhaps because of evidence supplied by Sarnos, his former colleague and business partner Fernandez was hit with a prison term for marijuana dealing. We may not ever find out, but it must be the reason why Sarnos is allowed to travel to the U.S., while a man like President Waldheim, Former U.N. Secretary General, is blacklisted. The Senate committee under Jo hn Kerry appeared to do everything in its power to offset Blandon's wildly erratic performance. When questioned by the press about Blandon's changed testimony, inaccuracies and contradictions, Senator D'Amato, one of the members, said: \"Publicity people would try to do anything to discredit th e testimony of Mr. Blandon.\" But in the end Blandon's testimony was shown to be nothing more than the product of an over-ripe imagination. His claim to have seen documents that confirmed CIA spying on the private lives of certain U.S. Senators, an allegation hotly denied by the CIA, but reconfirmed by Blandon, caused quite a stir. Blandon's CIA \"bombshell\" upset the committee almost as much as Milian's disclosures that top U.S. banks were involved in laundering dope cash. 145"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Another of the \"influential inte rnational figures,\" who supported the \"get Noriega\" conspiracy was Ted Turner of CNN. Turner is believed to be a member of the Trilateral Commission who was personally \"turned\" by David Rockefeller. It looks as though his name was added to the list of Noriega's enemies. Roberto Eisenmann's La Prensa heaved a sigh of relief at the way the Senate Subcommittee hearings we nt. It was apparent that the dope banker's policy for Panama would henceforth be U.S. official policy. The campaign against the PDF waged by the U.S. came straight from the pages of La Prensa w ith its howls of rage at being \"repressed.\" The cocaine barons and their bankers wrote the lyrics for the song of hate being sung by the Reagan administration against the best dr ug trafficking fighter in the world at that period, General Manuel Noriega. The fact, that Noriega was smear ed with dirt should tell us something about just how effective he was in the war on drugs. If he were a non-entity, nobody in Washington or Panama would be bothered by him. An international hate and slander campaign came rapidly to a climax and ended in the ouster of Noriega. It is my belief based on information of the highest reliability, that even after he was forced out, Noriega remained in dire danger. That information proved to be correct with the kidnapping and transporting of Noriega to a Florida jail, followed by a kangaroo-court trial without para llel in jurisprudence of any Western nation. The dope barons an d their bankers are not going to forgive and forget. Noriega wa s marked for elimination in the same way as General Somoza of Nicaragua was destined to be murdered. Some good did emerge from the Subcommittee hearings. General Paul German denied that he had found any evidence of wrongdoing by Noriega as claimed by Blandon and Norman Bailey. He said there was no hard evidence that Noriega had ties 146"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America to the cocaine barons. There had been rumors, said German, but no real evidence was ever f ound. Nor could the committee produce one shred of credible evidence to support the false charges lodged against Noriega, no matter how mightily Kerry huffed and puffed, and yet he was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment from which he will never be released. Blandon, Barletta, Linowitz, Elliot Abrams, Elliott Richardson, Lewis Galindo and Roberto Eise nmann, among others, want to see the dope trade legalized. Richardson's approach to this issue was highly ingenuous. He advocat ed legalizing drugs without actually appearing to do so. The line he took was that it was \"too late\" to attempt to fight the dope menace, and that no matter what efforts are made to suppre ss it, like alcohol before it, the best way to go is to legalize narcotics. This, according to Richardson and his Eastern Liberal Establishment banker's faction will prove far more effec tive and less costly in the long run — exactly the line adopted by Senator Edward Kennedy in his numerous attempts to legalize dope. Edward Kennedy was spared the fa te of his brothers, because he is useful for pushing establishment bills in the Senate - the sole reason for his continuing political career. If Kennedy once dares to vote against pro-narcotics legislation, he will be eliminated. We know it and he knows it. It is as unambiguous as that. In his article copied from the Sol Linowitz 1986 Report of the Inter- American Dialogue, Richards on practically quotes the arguments put forward by La Prensa and Carlos Lederer in support for legalizing the use of cocaine and marijuana in the same way that the U.S. was eventually forced to legalize alcohol. The Inter-American Dial ogue is an Eastern Liberal Establishment-Latin American confluence of opinion, which follows Trilateral policy-ma king for the region, under the auspices of the Committee of 300. 147"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman In short, it is there to r ubberstamp Trilateral Commission decisions. From its list of memb ers one can quickly gauge to what extent this body was set up to carry out CFR orders. Where the names of McGeorge Bundy, Linowitz, Kissinger, John R. Petty, Robert S. McNamara, Barletta and Montoya crop up, we can rest assured that dirty wo rk at the crossroads exists. Courier for the Colombian cocaine barons Samper Pizano says that a new and fresh approach to the drug problem must be considered for the West. Pizano, who does not dispute his connections with the Colombian cocaine barons, once presented Lopez Michelson with a check for a very handsome amount of money as a \"contribution\" to his presidential campaign. The money was accepted by Michelson, ev en though he knew that it came from Carlos Lederer. The hoary argument for selective legalization was also trotted out by Richardson. Apparently 65 million drug addicts in the U.S. is not a sufficient number . Richardson hints that the war against drugs cannot be won, another old and dangerous argument, which ignores the hammer-blows President Garcia was able deliver against the coca ine mafia in only fifty days, and that with strictly limited resour ces at his disposal! The clincher is the statement; . . . the illegality of drugs makes the damage greater for both addicts and soci eties of the Americas. As an officer of the courts, Richardson deserved to be examined by the American Bar Association, charged with pushing the sale of narcotics and indicted on such charges. The Inter-American Dialogue has its narcotics banker club backing the attempts to legalize dope. That there is a proven link between the First Bank of Boston, Credit Suisse and th e cocaine barons of Colombia would not be hard to prove; much less difficult than trying to make Jose Blandon's twisted testimony credible and acceptable. 148"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America Why didn't the Senate Subcommittee, which was smearing Noriega, go after Credit Suisse, First Bank of Boston, American Express and Bank of America, if it really wanted to project credibility in battling the drug trade? What was John Kerry's role in all this? When did the State Department really begin to fear Noriega? I would estimate that it was immediately following the success of the joint DEA-Panama anti-drug action code-named \"Operations Pisces,\" which was publicly revealed by the DEA on May 6, 1987, in which it characterized as \"the largest and most successful undercover investigation in Federal drug law enforcement history.\" The State Department immediately began counter-operations in conjunction with those named in this article to undercut the success of \"Operation Pisces\" and remove General Noriega as Commander of the Panama De fense Force. The State Department and its allies in the pro-dope lobby had good reason to fear Noriega as the following extract from a May 27, 1987 letter to Noriega from DE A head. John C. Lawn made abundantly clear: As you know, the recently concluded Operations Pisces was enormously successful, many millions of dollars and thousands of pounds of drugs have been taken from the drug traffickers and internati onal money launderers. Your personal (emphasis added) commit ment to Operations Pisces and competent professional and tireless efforts or other officials in the Republic of Pa nama were essential to the final positive outcome of this investigation.

John C.

The Senate Subcommittee hearin gs rendered a terrible and unfortunate disservice to the American people by its support of the dope barons and their bankers , and virtually buried what was left of the lamentably weak war on drugs program, which President Reagan was supposed to have left in the hands of George H.W. Bush. All that remained of our tattered self-esteem as a nation opposed to the drug menace was Nancy Reagan's pathetic \"Just Say No.\" Talk is indeed cheap, especially when compared with the brave acts of valor we can lay at the door of General Noriega and President Alan Garcia. The U.S. establishment press, the jackals, who follow the dictates handed down by pack leader David Rockefeller were responsible for orchestrating the vicious anti-Noriega campaign in America, which led to the indictment by a Miami Grand Jury of the man so lavishly praised by the head of the DEA. Who is wrong here? Is it John C. Lawn? Is the Noriega he praised, really the same man portrayed as a friend and protector of narcotics traffickers by the cocain e mobster's press, its lawyers, its bankers, its paid liars a nd its policy making organizations? At first glance there appears to be some confusion. Noriega is either clearly not the man John C. Lawn gave kudos to, or the 150"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America Senate Subcommittee witnesses were liars. We leave it to you to draw your own conclusions. Let us return to the \"enemies of Noriega\" list and uncover the ch ief perpetrators of this most savage crime against the best opponent of dope traffickers in modern times. General Ruben Darios Paredes The retired former Commander of the Panama National Guard was General Noriega's most combative and dangerous enemy. In spite of the brutal cocaine mafia-style execution of his son, Paredes remained loyal to the Ochoa brothers, even after finding out that they lied to him when he phoned to enquire after his missing son. Paredes accepted the word of the Ochoas that his son was safe, even while the Colombian press was trumpeting the word that Rueben Jr. was al ready dead, the victim of \"los grandes mafioses.\" Paredes had long-standing ties to Fidel Castro and his self-proclaimed \"special friend\" Colonel Roberto Diaz Herrera. Given these known facts, it is not surprising to find Paredes entertaining members of Carlos Ledher's private army of terrorists, the M19 at hi s home and shielding them after a unit of M19 was set up in Pa nama to protect the Darien cocaine laboratory and Israeli weapons caches. Paredes was Kissinger, Linowitz and the State Department's choice to replace General Noriega once he was forced out by naked threats or Justice Depart ment prosecutions. This was the basis of so-called \"negotiations\" with General Noriega that took place. In July 1987, Paredes threatened that war would break out in Panama if General Noriega did not resign. The role assigned to Paredes by Kissinger and Linowitz was that of a spoiler, to ensure that no individual and or political party became strong enough to threaten the vested interests of the dope barons and their banking nexus. As mentioned before, when Torrijos showed such signs, he met with a fatal plane 151"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman \"accident.\" Is there any real proof of the kind so avidly sought after by the Senate Subcommittee, and which it failed to find in the case of General Noriega, that could have linked Paredes to the cocaine barons and their dirty bankers? It is a matter of public record that the Ochoas lavished expensive gifts on Paredes, including costly thoroughb red walking horses, but that on its own is not enough evidence . Then there is the matter of the clearly established relations between Paredes's deputy, Lt. Colonel Julian Melo Barbua, whom we have already met, and whose close relationship with Ricardo Tribaldos, Jaime Castillo, Mendez and other Ochoa traffickers like Stephen Samos was not in dispute and which could in no wise have been concealed from General Paredes. When Lopez Michelson met with the Colombian cocaine barons in Panama in 1984, it was Melo Borbua, who saw to it that they were not disturbed. I mentioned Stephen Samos, because he was married to Alma Robles, a sister of the Robles bothers whose law firm is used by the dope ba rons. Samos was a runner for the Fernandez syndicate-until he got himself caught. My information is that he was well known to Melo Borbua, and that his activities could not possibly ha ve escaped the attention of a man like General Paredes. Paredes, in spite of his known dope connections was much sought after by the jackals of the American media. He has received totally favorable press reviews, his seamy past apparently safely under wraps, in much the same way that General Pitovranov of U.S. Trade and Economic Mission (USTEC) is loved by the American press, notwithstanding his known past as head of a worldwide KGB kidnapping and murderer squad. 152"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America Dr. Norman Bailey Bailey's past is tied up with the National Security Council where he served before joining up with Sol Linowitz of the infamous Panama Canal give-away. While a member of the National Security Council, Bailey was assi gned to study the movement of narcotics money, which gave hi m first hand experience of Panama. As a direct result of his studies Bailey became friendly with Nicholas Ardito Barletta. Bailey was believed to have developed a hatred of Noriega, blaming him for Barletta's loss of his presidential job. Baile y is on record as saying: I began my war against Panama when my friend Nicky Barletta resigned as President of Panama. Bailey learned a great deal about Panama's bank secrecy laws from the man responsible for making it a haven for drug traffickers and money laundering banks whose defender he now had become. Why should Bailey have taken um brage at the dismissal of Barletta? Because Ba rletta was the \"man on the ground\" representing British and Amer ican top-level Establishment figures, up to their eyebrows in the dope trade — from a safe distance of course. He was also the International Monetary Fund (IMF) man on the spot in Panama to see that its dictates were obeyed without question, and a favo rite of George Shultz. When General Noriega resisted the IMF's austerity asset stripping packages, he came into head-on collision with Ardito Barletta, and vicariously, with the Washington elitist establishment. Unbeknown to Bailey, General No riega had been conferring with Alan Garcia, whose tactics had successfully defended Peru against IMF depredations, and which Noriega subsequently adopted for Panama. 153"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman As a result, Bailey was ousted when he tried to become the IMF's enforcer. At that point the decision to wage all-out war on Noriega and the National Guard was taken by George Shultz on the advice of Norman Bailey and his business partner, William Colby, whose company, Colby, Ba iley, Werner and Associates had been consulted by the pa nic-stricken Panamanian and American drug money laundering bankers. From that moment onwards, General Noriega was never called anything other than \"a dictator.\" Bailey maintains that he was not interested in getting rid of Noriega. More importantly, he says, was getting rid of the militarily, because, according to Bailey, \"Panama is the most heavily militarized country in the Western Hemisphere.\" This remarkable statement should be weighed against the known fact that it was Bailey who drafted the charges leveled against Noriega by Blandon, Eisenma nn and Weedon. Bailey as a member of the civic action grou p that worked hard to oust Noriega and replace him with what Bailey liked to call a \"Civilian Junta,\" that will hold fr ee elections once it has gained power on which he sets a time limit of one year. Bailey contributed heavily to the New York Times and Washington Post slander of Norieg a, which he calls \"98% fact.\" Even if only 2% is not fact, then surely his articles must be totally suspect? Thr ough Bailey, the conspi racy against General Noriega turned the full circle from the cocaine barons in Colombia through to the elitists in Washington, London and New York. It was through Bailey that the connection was made between the low class murdering cocaine mafia and the untouchable respectable names in the social and political registers of Washington, Boston, London and New York epitomized by Elliott Richardson and George Shultz. 154"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America What is at stake is the massive amounts of cash generated by the as yet illegal narcotics traffickers which however, may not remain illegal for much longer, given the pressure on legislators to \"ease up\" on the \"social use\" of such drugs as marijuana and cocaine. Behind the pressure against cigarette smoking stood the dope lobby's campaign to legalize \"light use\" of dangerous habit-forming drugs. The Surgeon General says that nicotine is as habit forming as cocaine a nd heroin. The implications are obvious. Give up anti-social smoking with its proven cancer inducing risks, and switch instead to non-carcinogen cocaine or marijuana. Dope sales, which pres ently far outstrip the sales of gasoline, may soon also outstri p the sale of cigarettes. The \"market\" for cocaine is as yet relatively untapped. If many more millions of people are turned into drug-dependant zombies, what of it, as Bertra nd Russell would say if he were alive today. When Noriega was arrested by George Bush the elder and his army of 7,000 U.S. soldiers, the Soviet Union was the winner, through the partnershi p and Castro's Cuba. It was able to extend its influence ac ross Latin America. A second benefit to the trade was the in creased production of cocaine and marijuana it made possible. The U.S. felt the impact as drugs were now cheaper and greater qua ntities become available to \"new\" users, who may not necessari ly become addicts, or so the rationale has it. In this, the drug barons were assured of the full support of the New York Times sp eaking on behalf of British interests and the Washington Post. Both newspapers have in past years published a number of articles in support of legalizing the use of marijuana and cocaine.

The situation in Central America became a danger to American national security interests. A Philippines style \"democracy\" was forced on Panama. In order to get the go-ahead on the Panama Canal Treaty, the Senate said General Noriega had to resign. If he refused to comply, he would be forced out. That was the consensus of the six-member Senate Staff Delegation, which visited Panama November 12-16, 1987. The delegation made no mention of the frightful threat posed by the narcotics traffickers and their Cuba connection, not to mention the threat to our econom y posed by the drain of U.S. dollars into Panamanian dirty money laundering banks. In the name of democracy, control of Panama was wrested from Noriega and handed to the inte rnational dope traders and Panama was turned upside down by the Canal Treaty. Not specifically spelled out, but clearly an implied threat, is the clear threat to send the U.S. military into Panama, if \"disorders\" threaten the safety of the Canal. It was to create such disorders that veteran troublemaker, John Maisto, was deployed in Panama. John Maisto Who is John Maisto? He was th e number two man at the U.S. Embassy in Panama when the \"transfer\" to Panama was going on. Before that he was deployed to South Korea, the Philippines and Haiti to create unrest on the streets and to lead \"demonstrations\" against the authorities. He has been very active on the streets in Panama, and it is a disgrace that agent provocateur Maisto was allowed to get away with his 156"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America scandalous behavior. The Senate willfully and with malice aforethought helped to create dete riorating conditions in Panama by continuing to insist that \"dic tator\" Noriega was engaged in criminal activities and that his refusal to accept the U.S. defense rights, upon which the Panama Treaty is predicated, endangered the entire treaty. \"Defense rights\" in this instance meant stationing American troops in areas where Maisto had been at work stirring up trouble, a deliberate provocation, as the military is fully aware of the inherent dangers in stationing troops in areas of civilian unrest. If it learned anything at all from Iraq, the military should know that it is wrong to put U.S. Military personnel in the middle of an untenable and volatile situation. Another untruth that needs to be exposed is the story that General Noriega was receiving aid from Libya. This is a fabrication designed to discredit Noriega. My sources took three months to investigate the charge s and found that they had no substance whatsoever. The State Department had been running a disinformation campaign with the help of Ted Tu rner of CNN in much the same way as the BBC ran its disinformation campaign against the Shah of Iran. But in spite of all this, the bloodbath planned for Panama by the disinformation campaign and the scurrilous activities of John Maisto, failed to materialize. General Paredes, who as already explained, was the mouthpiece for the cocaine barons, their bankers and politic al backers, added his voice to the crescendo of calumny against General Noriega, predicting dire consequences for Panama if Noriega did not step down immediately.

A Washington source said that Reagan wanted to have Noriega out of the way in time for his \"summit\" meeting with Gorbachev. Norman Bailey stepped up his demands that the Panama National Guard be disbanded as it represented a \"danger\" to the whole area. Addressing a forum held at the George Washington University in Washington D.C., Bailey said that only if the people of Panama went out on the streets and got shot and beaten up would Noriega be budged. Unless the television cameras where on the spot to record such events , it would be a wasted effort. Nothing is going to happen in Panama, you are not going to get rid of Noriega and the institutions of the PDF if the people do not take to the streets, said Ba iley. That is why Maisto was in Panama, where he put his mob- inciting experience gained in South Korea, the Philippines and Haiti, into practice. What Maisto and Bailey wanted was a Panamanian \"Sharpeville\" — the State Department induced riot that swept the black township of Sharpeville in South Africa and resulted in 70 deaths among black rioters — which the cameras were conveniently on hand to record. Sharpeville has been a curse on South Africa ever since. The final straw supposed to break Noriega's back was the indictment handed down by a Miami Grand Jury. To summarize what had already taken place in Panama: The drug forces and their bankers combined with the political establishment in Washington to get rid of General Noriega and replace him with a puppet regime directed from Washington. What were the reasons for this action? Firstly, Noriega was wrecking the lucrative, burgeoni ng cocaine and marijuana trade in Panama and secondly, he refused to co-operate with 158"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America Kissinger's Andean Plan bent upon Central America becoming a Vietnam-style battleground for American forces. These were considered as sufficient reasons to place Panama under siege conditions. What was the outcome? General Noriega refused to continue to step down. Contrived situations were then set in motion, including riotous assemblies, economic hardships and labor unrest, intended to make Panama ungovernable. At that point, the U.S. military stepped in, ostensibly to secure to the Canal, but in fact they were there to kidnap Noriega and shanghai him to Florida for trial. That is how U.S. foreign policy for Pa nama was conducted. Are we a nation fit to rule the West? I leave you to draw your own conclusions! Was General Noriega in any way to blame for the unrest in Panama? Was he in any way, shape, or form, the drug-trafficker that the Grand Jury and the Se nate alleged he was? Why was there so much attention paid to Panama all of a sudden; even greater attention than was paid to Panama at the time of the handing over of our Canal to \"a nti-Communist\" General Omar Torrijos? When we hit someone in his or her pocketbook, we can be sure that it hurts. And that is ex actly what General Noriega was guilty of doing. He hit the dope barons in their pockets. He cost the dirty dope money laundering banks a large slice of their ill- gotten profits. He brought the bankers into disrepute. He upset the status quo; he put teeth into Panama's bank laws. More than that, he got in Henry Kissinger's way and upset the Israeli arms sales in Central America. He tramped on the toes of powerful people. No wonder General Norieg a was cast in the role of a villain. The Carter Presidency pr oduced an explosion of cocaine trade.

The Federal Reserve had not anticipated the rush for dolla rs and it was hard put to meet the demand from Florida banks. The currency system was thrown into a disorderly patter n. Within six months of Jimmy Carter as President, Florida banks were turning over $514 billion in cocaine revenues. Carlos Ledher of the Columbia n drug cartel found a sympathetic and willing friend in Dr. Peter Bourne, Jimmy Carter's White House advisor on drugs. The Allman Brothers drug-sodden band was welcomed at the White House, notwithstanding the fact that they were \"coke\" user s. Ledher cultivated his \"Carter connection\" and no doubt cheered when Bourne began issuing prescriptions for habit forming drugs for friends and colleagues ~ for which, incidentally, he escaped proper punishment. Such \"boom\" conditions created a marvelous opportunity for the dope barons, especially in Panama . Torrijos did not care one way or the other about these happenings . To get control of the Canal Zone and build a viable Panamanian economy was what interested him the most. If cocai ne and marijuana were a means to this end, then so be it! His attitude was \"live and let live!\" The Carter administration back ed IMF demands that Latin America grow \"cash crops\" (mar ijuana and cocaine) to meet their international debt obligations. The IMF officially encouraged several countries, including Jamaica and Guyana to grow \"drug\" cash crops. The IMF's position is on record. John Holdson, a senior official of the World Bank, stated that the coca industry is highly advantageous to producers, and added: \"From their point of view they simply couldn't find a better product.\" The Colombian office of the IMF stated quite openly that as far as the IMF is concerned, marijuana and cocaine are just crops like any other crops that bring much needed foreign 160"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America exchange into the economies of Latin American countries!

In fact the acquisiti on of Midland by Hongshang was highly irregular, bordering close on a criminal act. The Midland Marine Bank was remarkable for one aspect; it operated as a clearing bank for Panama's dope banks! So it was not just by coinci dence that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank went after it! Nicolas Ardito Barletta was on the board of Midland Bank, as was Sol Linowitz. Funny how these names keep cropping up! Apparently Linowitz did not think it was a conflict of interest, when the time came to \"negotiate\" with Torrijos. What about First Boston, up to it s eyes in washing dirty dope money in conjunction with Credit Suisse? First Boston isn't just any bank. Its original owners were the old Eastern Liberal Establishment Perkins family, en twined with the White Weld Empire in Switzerland. Incidental ly Perkins was the agent for J.P.

It ought to make us curious to find out what lay behind the concerted effort by bankers, politicians and the jackals of the press to get General Noriega out of their way. It is my hope that with th e information I have provided, 161"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman you will now be able to understand why Panama is still under siege! Since the first indication in 1986/87 that something had gone wrong with the drug banker's pl ans to use General Manuel Noriega as their tool, the Rock efeller and Wall Street banks began plotting to have him forced out of office. However, when all attempts failed, more drastic measures were investigated. Clearly by 1988, Noriega had become a serious impediment to the drug trade in Panama. The extraordinary lengths that Rockefeller went to in order to remove him because of his attacks on Ibero-American Bank of Panama, and the ensuing implications will now be examined. Why was it necessary for President G.H.W. Bush to resort to a criminal action, to whit, an invasion of Panama and the kidnapping of its head of state? Many reasons for this truly lawless action have been advanced and we shall examine some of them. Had it not been that the American People were in a permanent fog, a huge outcry would have ensued over the invasion of Panama by the U.S. military. Was Noriega in the employ of th e Central Intelligence Agency? Did Alfredo Duncan, the DEA agent in charge in Panama believe this? If so, it might help to explain his weird conduct. According to reports from a deep cover DEA agent who has resigned from the service, he believed that Duncan had \"an outstanding relationship with the CIA.\" This was also the word around th e Marriott Hotel in Panama; known by drug traffickers as \"a DEA hotel.\" The same agent complained that he was never able to get Duncan \"to do anything\" about planned anti-dr ug operations in Panama in which his help was needed. When the order was given to arrest 162"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America a man called Remberto, a kingpin in drug money laundering in Panama, Duncan apparently did nothing, and when questioned about his negligence, said that Remberto was spirited away by the CIA before he would take action. Later it would be claime d that Remberto had ties to Noriega, but no evidence to substantiate the claim was ever produced. In 1986, Noriega closed down First Inter America Bank, when it was positively proved that it was owned by the Cali Cartel. What was the Cali Cartel? It was probably one of the largest drug cartels in Colombia supposedly working with U.S. government agencies against the Medellin Cartel. The Washington Post admitted this. One of the offici al lobbyists for Cali was Michael Abbell, who was a Justice Department employee for 17 years. On Oc tober 28 and 29, 1989, President Bush and his allies held a summ it meeting in Costa Rica, which was attended by political leaders of Central and South America. At the press conference that followed, President Bush told reporters: \"The days of that des pot, the dictator (Noriega), are over.\" This sent a signal to the press that the \"urgent\" matter of Noriega had now been resolved by joint consultation with Venezuela and Nicaragua, am ong others, although Bush officially tried to distance himself from President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua. No matter how hard President Bush tried to give the appearance of a unanimous verdict against the Panamanian leader, the fact that the majority of the jury, Bolivia, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic didn't even show up for the \"trial,\" a fact said to have infuriated Bush and his chief executive, James Baker III. President Carlos Salinas Gortari was supposed to have played a key role in the lynch mob affair.

Venezuela's President Carlos Andreas Perez, himself no knight in shining armor, was the one whom intelligence sources said there would be a coup against Noriega under cover of a \"joint force\" on October 3, 1989, but which attempt fizzled out. So did the attempt to pressure Latin American nations to break off diplomatic relations with Panama. President Bush told the heads of state that they had bette r get behind his plans for a confrontation with Noriega — or else. But the conference broke up without any definitive agreement being reached. It speaks volumes of how much Bush feared Noriega and how low his government wo uld stoop to gain its own ends. Bush met with the Panamanian \"opposi tion forces,\" the so-called Panamanian Democratic Opposition Civic Alliance, which consisted of public figures well known for having ties to banks in Panama and Florida that launder drug money. Its leader, Guillermo Endara went on television and all, but openly called for the assassination of Noriega. On his return to Panama, Endara denied that he had ever called for such action. Noriega then countered the Costa Rica plotters by getting President Rodriguez to send an open letter to the Presidents of Latin America, which contained a copy of the offer made to the United Nations to make Panama the headquarters of a multinational anti-drug force, a fact President Bush had failed to bring out. The October 3, 1989, letter to the U.N. called for such a force to be established by means of an in ternational treaty that would guarantee it full authority in Panama, but there was no response 164"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America from either the Bush administration or the U.N. The letter also scolded Venezuela and other \"B ush partners\" for calling for \"democracy\" in Panama, without ever mentioning the illegal and ugly boycott slapped in place by President Bush without good or valid reasons. All during October and November of 1989, U.S. forces in Panama kept up a running harassment of the Panamanian Defense Force, hoping to create an incident that would justify U.S. military intervention, but the PDF failed to oblige. It was later shown (May 1989), the Bush administration changed the rules of engagement for U.S. forces in Panama. Henceforth the military was ordered to go out of its way to seek confrontations with the PDF. The Pentagon was secretly preparing to provoke Noriega's soldiers by running convoys through the outskirts of Pa nama City, which was in contravention with the treaty with Panama. The underlying premise was that Noriega would get angry and order the PDF to confront the U.S. convoys, thus setting the stage for a major U.S. intervention. On July 8, 1989, General Cisneros, commander of the U.S. Army South in Panama, brushed aside attempts by the Organization of American States (OAS) to negotiate and settle the crisis. General Cisneros said that the OAS \"...would not act firmly enough to dislodge Noriega. Speaking for myself, I believe this is the moment for a military intervention in Panama.\" Since when does the U.S. military make political pronouncements? This action was by way of being a test case of what Bush had in mind for Iraq. On December 20, 1989, after all other methods had failed to dislodge the popular Noriega, Bush gave the green light for an act of violent aggression against the people of Panama resulting in the death of 7,000 165"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Panamanians and the destruction of the entire area of Chorrillo through a sustained bombardment by U.S. troops and planes. This action, by the U.S. military, was an open act of aggression against a nation at peace, and was in gross contravention of the U.S. Constitution and The Hague and Geneva Conventions to which the U.S. is a signatory. Let us examine the real reasons why President Bush, without first obtaining a declaration of war from Congress, went to war against the small nation of Pa nama, and in the manner of a desperado, ordered the kidnapping of the head of state? Why did President Bush have to resort to such desperate means to get rid of Noriega? Why did Bush resort to such gangster tactics? According to certain reports one of the major reasons was to warn Latin American nations that henceforth, if they failed to do the will of Washington, they too would face the threat of U.S. military action. There is no reason to believe the massive propaganda campaign surrounding the illegal U.S. military action against Panama and Noriega, which the President would have the world believe would end drug trafficking in Panama, and which he had accused Noriega of running succeeded, even if only partially. There is no precedent in the U.S. Constitution or International Law that would have permitted an unprovoked attack on Panama. What substantive proof did Presid ent Bush provide to back up his charges? Not a single shred of proof was ever offered. We were just supposed to take the President's word for it. What then were the objectives of the invasion? The first objective was to destroy the Panamanian Defense Force, the only force capable of keeping law and order in th e country. With that objective reached, the next step was to install, by the most 166"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America undemocratic means possible, a puppet regime consisting of persons with the closest ties to drug-money laundering banks, and known long-time supporters of the Bush family. There was another, secondary, objective in destroying the PDF, and that involved the Panama Canal Treaties, under the terms of which the U.S. and Panama were to provide a joint defense of the Canal. This was to be phased out in 1999, by which time the PDF would be strong enough to take over the entire responsibility of policing the Ca nal and U.S. Military Forces would be obliged to depart the country. A key provision in the treaties stated that in the event that Panama did not live up to its obligations in providing such a se curity force, a \"U.S. military presence shall be retained.\" This was thought to be a \"good\" provision when it was inserted by Sol Linowitz, who drew up the treaties. It was there to prevent any future Panamanian leader from \"getting out of line,\" although no problems were envisaged with Omar Torrijos. When Torrijos began reneging on his personal arrangements with David Rockefeller to protect the drug money laundering banks, it was not at that stag e possible to destroy the PDF, although numerous attempts were ma de to get a revolt going that would divide the corps, all of which failed. Torrijos was therefore \"liquidated\" in the ma nner of the CIA. \"Liquidation\" became the language of the CIA following the tenure of Alan Dulles as its leader. Prior to that period, the word was never used by any U.S. intelligence agency. It was strictly a Stalin word. Why should it be desirable to keep U.S. forces in Panama on a permanent basis? The advent of the Gulf War and the second invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces provides the key. The U.S. wanted to station a rapid deployment force in Panama to use 167"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman against any recalcitrant Latin American and Caribbean nations, in the manner in which a rapid deployment force will be permanently stationed in Iraq to deal with Moslem countries that might wish they had never made friends with the U.S. This is the so-called \"hemispheric projection doctrine\" established by Pentagon planners. We shall see similar permanent bases in many parts of the world, including Pakistan, South Korea, Somalia, Iran and Afghanistan as the United States eases into its role as the \"big stick\" enforcer for the global enforcer we have come to know as the New World Order. Yet thus far there has not been a single voice of protest raised against this in the Senate. I might a dd, without modesty, that these events were foretold in my book, One World Order, Socialist Dictatorship. Panama has become important as a base for U.S. operations against Latin American nations, wh o at some time in the future might rebel against the collector of tribute, the IMF, as they see their people and nations disappear ing into the mire created by the international moneychangers. Clearly, immediate action would be required by th e \"international police force\" of the IMF, the United States of America, in the event of any attempts by any country to kick out the IMF. Thus the bases at Fort Clayton have assumed a new importance. Latin America was intimidated and frightened by the ruthlessness of U.S. military actions in Panama. To be frank, the leaders of these nations did not expect it, and when it came, the ferocity scared them, which was exactly what it was supposed to do. Evidently the majority of Latin American leaders believed that the Order of Skull and Bones wa s some sort of a benevolent organization, \"like the Shriners\" that would make for \"a kinder, gentler America\" as one official put it. 168"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America Little did they know of the involvement by the British Crown in U.S. affairs, nor of its long-st anding connections to the drug trade. In support of the foregoing information came the offer by the forcibly, undemocratically installed Endara, that after the year 2000, all bases in Panama would be made available to the U.S. military. The second objective of the Bush invasion of Panama was to install a new government of selected stooges with a history of long-standing alliances to banks, whose chief activities were to launder drug money for some of the most prominent cocaine cartels. In this Bush was commanded to protect the interests of the Rockefeller banks in Panama, which General Noriega had started to rip open and threaten to wreck. Indeed, this Bush objective was reached. The third objective of the invasion of Panama was to represent to the American people that this was a major escalation of the President's war on drugs, that mythical, non-existent action which never gets anywhere. By invading Panama, Bush knew that his \"drug war\" would rece ive a big boost, especially on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers were becoming restive at the lack of progress and under constant pr essure to legalize drugs. The next phase would be to mount a \"war on terrorism,\" that would be global in reach and of open-ended duration. By February 1990, some very strange things had begun to happen. The U.S. media, always a stalwart defender of Bush and his autocratic rule, began to make unfamiliar sounds. For instance, take the report contained in the New York Times of February 7. Even taking into account that the newspaper is an outpost of British Intelligence with U. S. managers at the helm, it nevertheless does not make any sense as to why the paper should have published the truth. 169"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman By referring to earlier articles it is remarkable how the New York Times (NYT) named the very people I was cr itical of for being too close to corrupt dr ug money laundering banks. Under the heading \"Panama Is Resist ing U.S. Pressure to Alter Inadequate Bank Laws,\" the article stated: An extensive review of Pa namanian banking records and court documents shows that ma ny senior leaders in the government (installed by the U.S.) while never accused of money laundering, have strong tie s to corrupt banks. Several of the banks have either been indicted for money laundering or been shut down because of pressure from the United States. The article did not say that it was action by Noriega, which had shut down these banks and that there has been no support from the U.S. for Noriega. Upon examin ing all the facts, the pieces of the puzzle began to fit its place. Of course the New York Times was trying to show that the U.S. had been the instigator of bank closures, when this was not the case at all, and moreover, by shifting the blame for \"resistance\" to changes allegedly emanating from Washington, it could be made to look as though the U.S. was really waging a drug war, but that the new government wasn't cooperating, which the reader must agree was quite a clever ploy. The article went on to say: President Guillermo Endara has fo r years been a director of a Panamanian bank used extensively by Colombia's Medellin Cartel. It was rewarding for me to get confirmation of the information given many years earlier in my monographs on Panama, even 170"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America from such an unexpected sour ce. Banco Interoceanico de Panama, one of two dozen Panamanian banks named by the FBI as drug money launderers, is the bank the New York Times was referring to.

Released on bail, he is now awaiting trial. Of course the New York Times didn't go all the way, but what it did not say can be found herein, namely that it was not only Endara who was up to his hocks in the money-laundering banking business, but also his friends much favored by the Bush administration. Other prominent members of the Bush administration's \"Panama cabinet\" include the following: Rogelio Cruz Cruz is Attorney General for Panama. He was formerly a director of the First Inter Am erican Development Bank. This bank was owned by Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, a top man in the Cali Cartel in Colombia, which I have previously mentioned. Guillermo Billy Ford He is the Second Vice President and chairman of the banking commission. He also just happens to be the part owner of the Bank of Dadeland, which was specifically named in my monographs as a heavy drug money-laundering bank. The bank was also the clearinghouse for drug money for Gonzalo Mores, principle launderer for the Medellin cartel. 171"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Ricardo Calderon Calderon is the First Vice President of Panama, and records show that his family was heavily involved in suspect banks. Mario Galindo Galindo and his family, like Calderon, were involved with suspected drug money-laundering banks, one of which was the Banco del Istmos, whose chairman, Samuel Lews Galindo, was related to Mario Galindo. All of the above were well known to Ivan Robles, who was employed at Dadeland Bank, and Antonio Fernandez who smuggled tons of marijuana into the U.S. In 1976, the Fernandez ring began to buy stock in the Dadeland Bank co-owned by Ford, Eisenmann and Rodriguez. President Bush warmly greeted Rodriguez as \"porky\" Endara's envoy to the United States. By establishing these men in leading roles in the Panamanian government, the Bush administration appeared to have succeeded in its second objective to make it easier, not harder for the drug trade to function in Panama, which as I said earlier, was the second objective of the invasion of Panama. After calls that the secrecy laws of Panama be repealed, in defense of his position, Ford sa id that there was no need to change the law: \"Secrecy will not be used for any illegal purposes.\" Others such as the Comptroller said that Panama wasn't going to change any laws. \"We don't have to change our whole legal system because of drugs. We can't change our whole legal system because of one thing, drugs,\" said Ruben Diaro Carlos.

Apparently so, yet while there is a great deal to point the finger of suspicion to the \"Bush gove rnment\" in Panama, not one single thing ever came up in court implicating Manuel Noriega. Wasn't this something a U.S. Grand Jury should have investigated a long time ago? Is this one of the reasons why Noriega was held incommunicado for so long? Was the Justice Department afraid of what Noriega may have told on the witness stand? Developments in Panama show just how phony the Bush drug war really was. There are not too many people who do not believe this, and of course, it is the biggest plus that the proponents of legalizing drugs have going for them. Their attitude is \"look, even the vast resources of the United States aren't enough to stop the drug trade. Why try to fight the inevitable? Why not make laws that will centralize control and take drugs out of the hands of the criminal elements?\" There are those l obbying Congress who threatened civil war if this was not done soon.

Black leaders were demanding that either the \"heat\" be taken off the black population or el se drugs be legalized. The invasion of Panama gave th e drugs lobby a leg to stand on. \"If that hasn't stopped the flow of drugs, how are the police expected to cope,\" they asked.

Buckley and Milton Friedman. Glasser urged that the nation \"get beyond the negative and begin to win over police, legislators and the public\" to the id ea of legalized drugs. Kevin Zeese, vice president a nd general counsel to the Drug Policy Foundation said: The drug war is more harmful than drugs are. That's pretty much what the balance comes down to. Is the drug war more dangerous to our society than the drugs are? Can we deal with the problem of drugs in a way less costly to our society- not just costly in economic terms, but in human terms as well? Zeese went on to say that heroin was a way of escaping suffering, which although he did not advocate, he could understand. Now that kidnapped General Noriega is languishing in a federal prison in Miami, what does the Bush Justice Department intend to do with him? One of the puzzling things I want to mention is the deafening silence from civil liberties orga nizations in this country and around the world as to the crimes committed against him by the U.S. government. One would imagine the kidnapping of a head of state would draw roars of protest from these watchdogs of liberty. Yet, no such thing has happened.

Why the long, unseemly delay? Isn't justice delayed justice denied?

On this single tragedy, Bush based his absurd claim that General Noriega had declared war on the U.S. and was \"threatening the integrity of the Panama Canal Treaties.\" What Secretary Cheney told the American public was that the Bush administration had invasion plans ready as far back as March 1989. 179"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Secretary Cheney himself tended to confirm this when he said on December 20: The order went out late on Sunda y to implement the plan that had been in existence for some time.

During the 1980s, the anti-feudal, pro-Muhajir Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) was started by unorthodox and educated urban dwellers of Sindh and particularly Karachi.

The September 11 attacks and the subsequent War on Terrorism have seen an improvement in U.S.-Pakistan ties, especially after Pakistan ended its s upport of the Taliban regime in Kabul. This was evidenced by a drastic increase in American military aid, which saw Pakistan take in $4 billion more in three years after the 9/11 attacks than in the three years before. Pakistan has long had troubled relations with neighboring India. The dispute over Kashmir resulted in full-fledged wars in 1947 and 1965.

Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari allegedly received a 7.15 percent commission on these pur chase through their front men, Jens Schlegelmilch and Didier Pl antin of Dargal S.A., who also received about $1,969 million for supplying 5,900 Ursus Tractors. In the largest single payment i nvestigators have discovered, a gold bullion dealer in the Middle East is alleged to have deposited at least $10 million into one of Zardari's accounts after the Bhutto government gave him a monopoly on gold imports that sustained Pakistan's jewelry industry and drug trade. The money was allegedly deposited into Zardari's 197"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman Citibank account in Dubai. Pakistan's Arabian Sea coast, stretching from Karachi to the border with Iran, has long been a gold smugglers' haven. Until the beginning of Bhutto's second term, the trade, running into hundreds of millions of do llars a year, was unregulated, with slivers of gold called biscuits , and larger weights in bullion, carried on planes and boats that travel between the Persian Gulf and the largely unguarded Pakistan i coast. The desolate Maccra coast is also the dropping off poi nt of huge shipments of heroin and opium out of Afghanistan and is the mainstay of the gold trade with the British Bank of th e Middle East based at Dubai. Shortly after Bhutto returned as prime minister in 1993, a Pakistani bullion trader in Dubai, Abdul Razzak Yaqub, proposed a deal. In return for the exclusive right to import gold, Razzak would help the government regulate the trade. In November 1994, Pakistan's Commerce Ministry wrote to Razzak informing him that he had been granted a license that made him, for at least the next two years, Pakistan's sole authorized gold importer. In an interview in his offi ce in Dubai, Razzak acknowledged that he had used the license to import more than $500 million in gold into Pakistan, and that he had traveled to Islamabad several times to meet with Bhutto and Za rdari. But he denied that there had been any corruption or secret deals. \"I have not paid a single cent to Zardari,\" he said. Razzak claims that someone in Pakistan who wished to destroy his reputation had contrived to have his company wrongly identified as the depositor. \"Somebody in the bank has cooperated with my enemies to make false documents,\" he said. 198"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Drug War Against America At no time was the enormous he roin and opium trade mentioned although it is the basis for gold trades at Dubai. The peasant opium poppy growers of Helmand in Afghanistan do not take paper money for their crops, and are always paid in gold. Since September 2004, Bhutto lived in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where she cared for her childr en and her mother, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, traveling to give lectures and keeping in touch with the Pakistan People's Party supporters. This naturally raises the question. Why Dubai? The answer is obvious. Bhutto stayed in Dubai to oversee the huge gold trades conducted through the Bank of Dubai. She and her three children were reunited with her husband and the father in December 2004 after more than five years. On January 27, 2007, she was invited by the United States to speak to President Bush and c ongressional and State Department officials. Bhutto appeared as a panelist on the BBC TV program Question Time in the U.K. in March 2007. She has also appeared on BBC current affairs program News Night on several occasions. She rebuff ed comments made by Muhammad Ijaz-ul- Haq in May 2007 regarding the knighthood of Salman Rushdie, citing that he was calling for the assassination of foreign citizens. Bhutto had declared her intention to return to Pakistan in 2007, which she did, in spite of Musharraf's statements of May 2007 about not allowing her to return ahead of the country's general election, due late 2007 or early 2008, because she might be assassinated. Yet other sources warned her of a very strong possibility that attempts would be made to assassinate her.

Herman also claimed: \"Although it was muhajirs who agitated for the creation of Pakistan in the first place, ma ny native Pakistanis view them with contempt and treat them as third-class citizens.\" Nonetheless, as of mid-2007, the U.S. appeared to be pushing for a deal in which Musharraf would remain as president, but step down as military head, and either Bhutto or one of her nominees would become prime minister. Through all of its internal strife, the drug trade continued on its way, seemingly oblivious to the ongoing political strife. No one was bold enough to step forward and block the route from Afghanistan to the coats of Maccra that would have interdicted the massive opium trade. There was just too much at stake for any one to attempt such a monumental task. In 2007, the DEA declared that opium from Afghanistan had reached a record production of 6,000 tons for the year, notwithstanding that the main growing area of opium poppy, Helmand, was constantly patrolled mainly by British and American troops under NATO command. The drug overlords have shown the world once again, that no matter what sort of government controlled a country (any country except Russia) they can continue to do business using innovative methods, a change of pace and direction.

Time will tell. In the meantime the multi-billion dollar business keeps on rolling along. The Drug Cartel's new \"business plan\" includes switching the distribution of cocaine from Mexico, the Caribbean and Panama, to far-distant Africa. In addition, the managers have sl ashed the price of cocaine 50 percent at the wholesale level, making the cost of a \"line\" of cocaine less that $5.00, within easy reach of all customers at the street level. The beauty of this plan from the Cartel's position is that African import countries are easy to manage, and with one or two notable exceptions, law enforcement is extremely lax, and highly susceptible to bribery. Another country of entry for cocaine into the European market is \"Kosova,\" the brainchild of Richard Holbrook, the so-called architect of the destruction of Serbia, which was simply given as a free gift to the decadent wh ite slave and drug trafficking Albania. Yes, believe it or not , Albania's Gross National Product is made up of revenues derived from drug trafficking and white slave trafficking. Henceforth, the cocaine trade will flourish in Kosova as it has done for a hundred years in Al bania. Any attempts by DEA agents to stop it will be met w ith intimidation and murder of its agents. Until the U.N. anti-narcotics agency and the anti-drug forces of Western Europe and th e United States can get a handle on the new distribution routes, th e Drug Cartel barons are going to have a virtually clear run. 201"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Dr. John Coleman An Update April 2009 Three years ago, the Mexican au thorities, urged on by the U.S., declared war on the drug dealers. Because of that action, Mexico is facing a rapid decline and coll apse, unless the U.S. steps up to the plate and helps Mexico with troops and adequate funding. While the new Obama administ ration's Secretary of State acknowledges that the battle ragi ng in Mexico poses a very real danger if it spills over into the U.S., she recently told CBS news that she was preparing to take steps to help Mexico with men and money. In the face of the know n fact that the Mexican Drug Lords are terrorizing Mexico with acts of brutality that are horrifying — the hitherto reluctance on the part of the U.S. to come to its aid is hard to understa nd. It is not as if Mexico is far removed from the U.S., or that we do not have close relations. In fact, we are closer to Mexico diplomatically speaking, than we are to Canada. In January 2009, Mexican drug terrorists kidnapped 10 soldiers. A short while thereafter, their bodies, riddled with bullets, were dumped along the side of a busy road. In another instance, a citizen thought to be a police informant was abducted, his head cut off, and his body hung over the side of a road bridge in full view of thousands of moto rists using the underpass. In 2008, 6300 people were kidnapped and killed by the drug terrorists. In fact, Mexico C ity has earned the unenviable reputation of being the kidnap cap ital of the world. Rich and poor alike are victimized. R ecently 250,000 people gathered in the main square of Mexico City to protest the slow government response to the drug lords. But the truth is that Mexico does not have the manpower or the money to mount the kind of overwhelming response to the drug barons that is needed.

The drug traffickers have fully automatic rifles and hand grenades and have regularly out-gunned the Mexican police in a number of pitched battles. Their superior weapons are purch ased for cash from dealers in the United States. The U.S. govern ment says it is pushing to close down these gun sales. A recent U.N. survey of Mexico reports that its drug trade am ounts to a staggering $38 billion a year, with more and more tra ffickers getting into the business every month. Corruption among the Mexican anti-drug forces is rife and although the Attorney General of Mexico says that he has adopted new measures to cu rb the drug trade, everything points to a rise in violent drug- related crime. There are some bright spots in the dark picture: In 2008 Mexico arrested 57,000 drug traffickers and it has just been disclosed that the U.S. government has committed an additional $56 million a year to help Mexico in its struggle against the drug barons. As feared, the Mexican drug terror has spilled over into 230 U. S. cities, and is toda y in mid-April 2009, the number one crime in America. It is our duty to join in the struggle now going on against the dangerous menace of drug trafficking threatening America. We must realize that we are at war with ruthless men who ar e determined to undermine and bring down our great Republic. The U.S. must follow the example of President Betancourt of Colombia. The entire future of our nation is at stake. This is not a war from which we can stand aside It is a fight to the d eath. We must win this war. If we do not, then the enemy within our gates will have taken a giant step forward in implementing its program of slavery and darkness for us all, as envisioned in the plans of the One World Government. 203"}]
