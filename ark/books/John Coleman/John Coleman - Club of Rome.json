Who were the planners and creators of significant events? The creators of these often viol ent and revolutionary events belong in the main to secret societ ies that infest our world, just as they have always done. Mostly, these secret societies are based upon the occult and occult prac tices, but as with all secret societies to make up secret govern ments, they are controlled by the Committee of 300. Those poorly informed persons, who believe that devil worship, demons and witchcraft have vanished from modern society, are misinformed. Today, occult-based secret societies along with Lu ciferianism, Black Magic and Voodoo, are flourishing and appear to be far more widespread than was originally thought. It is the tolerating of these secret societies in our midst, many of whose principals pose as Christians, added to our permissible attitude toward these organizations and their leaders who are the cause of our problems, national a nd international. Every unrest, revolution and war can inevitably be traced back to one or another or a combination of seve ral secret societies. Secrecy indicates a problem, for if the se cret societies were working for the good of the individual and the state, why the need for such profound secrecy in which they cloak themselves, their organizations and their deeds? I recall that the practice of voodoo, attributed to black Africa, really sprang from Jethro,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"8 Dr. John Coleman the Ethiopian. Like Voodoo, most occult practices and their attendant secret societies are anti-Christian, and they make no apology for it, although some in Freemasonry try to dissemble or hide their anti-Christian teachings. Yet, to their credit, Masons realize that Christ was far more than a religious leader. Masons believe that Christ came to change the face of the world and that He set His face against secret societies. That is why so many secret societies turn their adherents against Christianity. Right from the moment Christ began his ministry, Gnosticism sprang up in opposition to the perfect ideals of Christianity. Christ warned the world that we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against the forces of darkness and spiritual wickedness in high places. What this means is that the bottom line of our struggle against Communism, Marxism, Socialism, Liberalis m and a One World Government is a spiritual one. Sh ow me a secret society and I will show you a Christ-hating oc cult theocracy. Christ said: \"Know the truth and the truth shall make you free.\" Note that Christ used the word \"shall,\" which is much stronger than \"will.\" Christ was talking about the people who were in bondage to secret societies — as they are today — the ordinary people who are despised by the le aders of occult theocracies, who have no use for them, other than as servants and slaves. These leaders think it perfectly no rmal to kill off millions of people they consider as \"surplus to their requirements.\" This evil \"kill\" philosophy has crept into the U.S. military through men like Richard Cheney, Donald Rums feld, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz. It is a thoroughly alie n concept that does not belong in a Republican form of Govern ment. The leaders of evil secret societies threaten our entire civilization. Some of the secret cults who are very active in our affairs today are Gnosticism, the cult of Dionysus and the subject of this work, the cult of the Club of Rome. But I must return to the st arting point of th is work, which is found in modern history under the heading of \"The French Revolution.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 9 Modern history books do not teach that the so-called French Revolution had its roots in Engl and, where a demonist, William Petty, the Earl of Shelburne, trained economists Malthus and Adam Smith of the British East India Company (BEIC), and mass murderers Danton and Marat. After their time spent with Shelburne in England, Danton and Marat were spirited to Paris to be unleashed upon an unsuspecting and defenseless French people and the monarchy, in an or gy of blood lust. Years later, Lord Alfred Milner was to unl eash Lenin on an unsuspecting Christian Russia in an almost carbon copy of the French Revolution. The driving force behind the Fr ench Revolution was a secret society called the Illuminati, orchestrated by the London Qator Coronati Freemason Lodge in London, and the Nine Sisters Freemason (Orient) Lodge of Pa ris. A brief history of the Illuminati is essentia l if we are to understand how the Club of Rome came to be constituted. Ther e is disagreement concerning the origins of the Illuminati, but there is also a good deal of agreement that the Illuminati sprang from the Rosicrucians, the so-called master holders of abundant secrets such as the Philosopher's Stone, which Rosicrucianists say they received from the ancient Chaldeans, the Magi and the Egyptian priesthood. Rosicrucian's say they can pr otect human life by the use of certain nostrums and also claim to be able to restore youth. They are also known by the title, \"the Immortals,\" and teach that all mysteries have been revealed to them. In their earlier days, they were known as the \"Invisible Brothers,\" and later as, \"The Rosicrucian Brethren.\" A branch of the Rosicrucians calls itself, \"The Rite of Swedenbourg,\" or the \"Illuminati of Stockholm,\" which was founded in 1881 by Emmanuel Swedenbourg, a Master Mason, whose signature is still on the list of members of the Lodge of Lund, Sweden, wher e Swedenbourg was born. The Rite of Swedenbourg is merely a modification of the Order of the Illuminati of Abingdon, established in 1783. Then, as now, it was the cream of royalty,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"10 Dr. John Coleman titled nobility and high society who were the leaders of this secret order. But the main Order of Illuminati was founded in Bavaria on May 1, 1776, by one Adam Weishaupt, professor of Canon Law at the University of Ingolstadt. Weishaupt was a product of Jesuit education, and the Illuminati bear a close resemblance to the Or der of the Golden Cross. Here again, Illuminism is clearly tied in with Masonry, the Order of the Rosicrucian's, the Templars — or Order of French Masonic Degrees. Behind of all these orders stood Moses Mendelsohn, a student of the Kabal, with his stated objective to move to establish a One World Govern ment-New World Order. The principal business of the Illuminati was, and is, carrying on war against Christianity, which battle it carries out through shameful accusations against the life and te achings of Christ. Politically speaking, Illuminism is working to overthrow the existing order of all governments, more espe cially those who practice the Christian religion. Its members ar e pledged to blind obedience to their superiors and their secret, revolutionary plans to bring about the New World Order, whic h first went into operation with the French Revolution. Illuminati plans to destroy the Christian monarchy of France were discovered when an Illuminati messenger by the name of Jacob Lang was killed by lightni ng as he rode his horse to deliver revolutionary instructi ons to the Bavarian lodges. Subsequently, Lang's papers fell into the hands of the Bavarian authorities, and later, an iron box full of papers giving details of the coming plot against France wa s also discovered. Illuminism was introduced to France by the Marquis de Mirabeau and then adopted by the Duc de Orlean s, Grand Master of Orient Freemasonry in France. By the way, it was decided to induct Tallyrand as one of the most notable figures of his day, into Illuminism. One of the acts of putridity performed by adherents of Order of the Illuminati is ca stration. Janos Kadar, the former dictator of Hungry, publicly announ ced that he had actually had this rite performed on him."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome I 1 CHAPTER 2 CROWLEY, PIKE AND MAZZINI Neither Freemasonry nor Illuminism has died out. There are those in intelligence circles who be lieve both to be stronger now than they were at the time of the French Revolution. The death of Illuminist/Mason wo rld leaders, Guiseppe Mazzini and Albert Pike, did not signal any change in growth and direction of either organization. No doubt there will be some who will be offended by my references to Masonry. I do not mean to cause offense to Masons. I am merely trying to present a true account of how and why certain events occur in the world. American Masons claim quite er roneously that their Masonry differs from European Masonry. Let me correct the error: The Rosicrucian cabalists, Leon Te mpler and Jacob Leon, jointly designed the English Grand Lodge of Masonry, as well as its emblem. This is a very definite tie between Anglo-Saxon Masonry and the occult European Grand Or ient masonry. I say, \"occult,\" because that is what the great German General Ludendorff called it. The connection betw een European Rosicrucian Masonry and American Masonry was always close, and remains so to this day. The three main Masonic rites are: ■ The Scottish Rite of Freemasonry which has 33 degrees."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"12 Dr. John Coleman ■ The Rite of Mizraem, or Egyptian Rite, with 96 degrees. ■ The Orient Rite which is basically the one followed by European masonry. John Harker, author of Grand Mystic Temple, stated as follows: We the English have thus joined with the Scottish Rite, allied with the Mizraem, and now with Memphis. In the case of the former, we established relations with various supreme grand councils and revised the statutes of 1862 in preference to the forged constitution of 1786, in the year 1884, in Mizraem, with the old bodies of Naples and Paris and Memphis with America, Egypt, Romania and various bodies working that Rite. We also in these three R ites accepted foreign charters to confirm our original powers. This should dispose of the mi staken belief often quoted by American Masons that Anglo-Sa xon Masonry has nothing to do with European Masonry. Harker sh ould have known, after all, as he was the Grand Mystic. On November 11, 1912, Harker was elected Grand Imperial Master, a degree higher than the 96 th degree of the Rite of Mizraem. After his death in 1913, Harker was succeeded first by Henry Mayer and then by Alistair Crowley, 33 rd , 90 th and 96 th Degree Patriot Grand Master. Thus it is clear that American Masons are part and parcel of European Masonry, whether they know it or not, and the truth is, most do not. Crowley was one of the most beastly figures in the history of secret societies; a man who was to greatly influence the policies of the Club of Rome (COR.) Crowley was fond of quoting Malth us and Adam Smith, servants of the British East I ndia Company (BEIC) today known as the Committee of 300. Both men played a leading role in the concerted drive by King George III to ruin the American colonists through the one-way street of \"free trade.\""},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 13 Malthus and Smith became \"favorite sons\" of the COR. It is very easy to see the connecting link between the plans of the BEIC and the present policies of the COR, particularly in the COR \"Post Industrial Zero-Growth\" policies to put an end to the industrial dominance of the United States. The basic religion followed by the Club of Rome is Gnosticism and the cult of the Bogomils and Catharis. Members of the British monarchy are firm believers in these \"religions\" and in the main, it is accurate to say that certainly, the royal family members are not Christians. It is also quite easy to see the connection to the \"Committee of 300.\" Crowley is believed to have taken part in more than 150 ritual murders, an important part of occult demonology. Most of the victims were children, slain with a silver knife. Such bestialities continue to this very day, which may account for the large number of missing children w ho are never found. Crowley is still greatly admired by COR hier archy, as he was by several of the leading British figures in the atom spy case. Anthony Blunt, the Keeper of the Queen's Art (a very high title) before he was unmasked as a KGB agent, was a great devotee of Crowley. The bottom line is that Masonry starting at the Knights of Kadosh degree is an ongoing revolt against the existing order of things and dedicated to the overthrow of Christianity and the Republic of the United States of Ameri ca — as indeed is the COR. As long as Masonry continues to flour ish in our midst, for so long will chaos and unrest continue, for that is the intent and purpose of all revolutionary secret societies. The modern Club of Rome is but an ongoing, unbroken succession of secret societies that have as their goal, the destruc tion of liberty and freedom, which happened in the period we now know as the Dark Ages. Thus, it may be safely assumed that the COR is a New World Order-One World Government project designed to facilitate a swifter transition to universal slavery known as the New Dark Age, under the control of the Committee of 300."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"14 Dr. John Coleman CHAPTER 3 WHAT IS THE CLUB OF ROME? The very name was chosen to deceive the unwary, because the Club of Rome has nothing to do wi th the Vatican or the Catholic Church. While the evildoers wo rk night and day, Christian America slumbers on. When I wrote the First Edition of this work back in 1970, only a handful of people in intelligence knew of the existence of this, the most powerful secret society in the hands of the Committee of 300. The Club of Rome consists of the oldest members of the so- called Black Nobility of Europe, decedents of the ancient families, who owned, controlled and ran Genoa and Venice in the 12 th century. They are called \"B lack Nobility\" because of their use of dirty tricks, murder , terrorism, unethical behavior, and worship of Satan -- \"black\" deeds. They never hesitated to use force against anyone who dare d to stand in their way, and this is no less true toda y than it was during the 13 th to the 18 th Centuries. The Venetian Black Nobility is closely allied with the so-called German Marshall Fund, another name - like the Club of Rome — chosen to deceive the unwary. The Venetian Black Nobility consists of the richest and most ancient of all European families, their wealth far surpassing that of the Rockefellers, for instance, and they are part of the Comm ittee of 300, the most powerful controlling body in the world. One of the oldest of the Venetian Black Nobility dynasti es is the Guelph dyna sty. Queen Elizabeth II, for instance, is a Black Guelph - her great grandmother Victoria descended from that family. The Black Nobility and European royalty are prominent members of the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 15 COR, which has as its objective, the dissolution of the United States as an industrial and agri cultural power. Its other goals are not so readily visible and of a more complex nature, so I shall begin with the details of the CO R's special conference and detail what was said and who said it. As if to show their utter cont empt for the election victory of Ronald Reagan in the Novemb er of 1980 elections, the group chose to meet in Washington, D.C. According to minutes of the meeting secretly recorded by an intelligence officer, the agenda was about how best to dismembe r the industrial heart of the United States and get rid of what one delegate referred to as, \"the surplus population.\" This was consistent with the blueprint of Sir Bertrand Russell, as openly laid out in his book, The Impact of Science on Society. Other discussions dealt with methods to be used to gain contro l of the internal affairs of the United States. As several of the delegates came from the old Black Nobility families, or had worked for them for years, the dirty tricks, sedition, terror-t actics that were discussed, represented a direct challenge to the government and the people of the United States. The problem was that the American people knew nothing of this meeting of dangerous satraps of the Black Nobility, and the jackals of the media were not a bout to enlighten them about the intent and purpose of the conclave. It was one of the best-kept secrets of all time. The conferen ce was initiated and financed by the German Marshall Fund, which consists of the inner-core members of the WWII Morganthau Planning Group, who are themselves under the control of three or four members of the venerable Order of St. John of Jerusalem. This was the organization that originated the plan to de- industrialize post-war Germany, par tition it, and turn what was left of the country into agricultural land. The attempted total eradication of the German nation originated with Morganthau, a Zionist and a violent hater of Germany. The German Marshall Fund drew its vast resources from the companies of the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"16 Dr. John Coleman Committee of 300 and the Wall Street and City of London international bankers, the very same crowd who bankrolled the Bolshevik Revolution which estab lished the largest slave state on earth, and resulted in the verified deaths of millions of Christians, as chronicled by the notable writer, Alexander Solzenhytson. The chairman of the German Marshall Fund was David Rockefeller, no stranger to funding revolutionary groups of every color and stripe, ever since he and his family gained wealth and prominence. The COR conference agenda included the best ways to nullify the Reagan Presidency, which had come as something of a surprise to the Club's members. Emphasis was laid on blocking the economic recovery promised by then candidate Reagan. In order to accomplish this, the delegates were told that the Democrat Party had to be radica lized. There is no such thing a \"Democratic Party.\" There cannot be a Democratic Party in a Confederated Republic or a Cons titutional Republic, which is what the U.S. is. It was suggested that the best way to Socialize President-elect Reagan, was to drive out conservative members of his inner circle and then turn the Democrats into a strong anti- capitalist Socialist party along the lines laid down by the Communist Manifesto of 1848. (The Capital Gain Tax was passed in 1989 as a direct result of COR planning). In fact, since 1980, th e Democrat Party have assumed the role of the Socialist/Communist Part y and should be called, \"The Socialist/Communist Party of the United States.\" Among those in attendance at the 1980 Washington meeting was Anthony Wedgewood Benn, leader of the British Socialists and chief Fabian Socialist strategist. Benn talked about the task of drawing up a comprehensive contingency plan for this purpose, to which he added a proposed \"class war\" between Reagan and the American people. One month after their first meeting, the Club of Rome plotters returned to Washington for a second conference. The meeting heard fr om a delegate representing the so-called conservative Heritage Foundation, a Washington- based \"think tank\" funded by brewery magnate Joseph Coors."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 17 Heritage subsequently acted as the de facto employment agency for the Reagan Presidency, submitting a list of 3000 names of people it deemed suitable to fi ll key Reagan administration positions. Most of Heritage's recommendations were Liberals and far left of Marx career Socialists. In 1980, Heritage Foundation was controlled from behind the scenes by arch-Fabian Socialist, Sir Peter Vickers Hall, whose antecedents belonged to the Milner Group. (It will be recalled that Milner was the instigator of the cruel war of genocide, the Anglo-Boer War fought to ga in control of the gold and diamonds in South Africa.) Other prominent Socialists in attendance were the late Willy Brandt, a leading European contact for the KGB, and the late Olaf Palme, Francoise Mitterand, then unemployed, but soon to be returned to power in France by the Committee of 300, Philip Agee, a renegade ex- CIA officer, Bettino Craxi, a leading Italian Socialist, Michael Harrington of the Institute of Democratic Social Studies in Washington, D.C. and an unknow n Spanish Socialist by the name of Felipe Gonzalez, who had stopped over in Havana to consult with Castro before flying on to Washington. The COR appointed Gonzalez as its case officer for Nicaragua and El Salvador, and it would be interesting to know just how involved Gonzalez became in the wars in Central and Latin America, in which Castro had a hand. More than 2000 delegates attended this amazing gathering, yet it was completely blacked out by the media. It is a tribut e to my intellig ence connections, that within 3 days of the meeting, in November of 1980, I was in possession of full documentatio n of this unholy watershed meeting of Socialist leaders. CO R delegates attended what they perceived was the funeral oration of the United States, and among the Americans in attenda nce — apart from Agee and Harrington — were Jerry Rifkin, Ga r Apelrovich of the Institute for Policies Studies (IPS), the most prominent Socialists in the country,) Ron Dellums of California and Gloria Steinham, organizer of the Women's Lib/ ERA counterculture derived from the writings of Madame Kollont ei, the Communist leader who"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"18 Dr. John Coleman toured the United States in the 1920s-1930s. Together, the delegates were as destructive a crew as could be mustered. Many of the leading delegates taking part, other than Palme, Brandt and Benn, were members of the Socialist International who met in daily sessions with State Department officials including Cyrus Vance and Henry Kissinger. In case it is not known, the Socialist International is a particularly dangerous, subvers ive organization, which fully supports legalization of drugs and pornography as \"destabilization tools,\" to be used against the United States. Details of the discussions were never made public, but according to the documents with which I was provided, the COR planned to isolate the United States, leaving open a single channel to the worst elements in the State Department and the KGB. Here was a situation that smacked of treason and sedition, not to mention conspiracy charges that should have been filed against those who attended the two COR meetings. Apparently, a full day was devoted to how best to implement Lord Russell's plan to stifle i ndustry and rid the world of more than 2 billion \"useless eaters. \" It was resolved to redouble efforts to end construction of nuclear power stations and promote the policy of zero growth in conformity with the Adam Smith and Malthus economic th eories and the writings of Russell. (See my coming book, \"Nuclear Power.\") The Socialist International (SI) has long championed the idea of breaking up large cities and moving the population into smaller, more manageable (i.e., more easily controlled) towns and the countryside. The first experiment in this regard was carried out by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia, with the knowledge of Thomas Enders, a high-ranking U.S. State Department official."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 19 CHAPTER 4 CONNECTION TO GLOBAL GENOCIDE The Club of Rome, like the SI is strongly anti-national and favors the suppression of scientific development in the United States, Britain and Europe, and la tterly, Japan. COR is believed to have maintained some connections with terrorist organizations like the Red Brigades. This was implemented through arch-Socialist Bettino Craxi, a former leading player in the COR and a man known by intelligence agencies in France and Germany, to have had contacts in the Bader-Meinhoff gang, a notorious band of thugs who robbed banks and kidnapped public figures for ransom. It was Craxi, who repeatedly tried to break the resolve of the Italian government not to negotia te with the Red Brigades for the release of kidnapped U.S. General Dozier. Craxi was very close to Richard Gardner, a Committee of 300 executive, and Henry Kissinger. Gardner married into the Luccatti family, one of the most po werful of the Venetian Black Nobility families, known for centuri es as able performers of dirty tricks and terrorism. Neither Craxi nor the former Prim e Minister of France, Francois Mitterand held official positions in 1980, but as I reported in several issues of World in Review (WIR) in 1971, Craxi was destined to play a leading role in Italian politics, and Mitterand was to be returned to power in France - courtesy of the Club of Rome."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"20 Dr. John Coleman These predictions and that of Gonzalez later proved to be 100 percent accurate. The December 5, 1980 follow-up to the original COR meeting in Washington D.C., endorsed and accepted the COR's Global 2000 Report - a blueprint for global genocide. The report called for the d eath of 2 billion people by the year 2010 (hence the title). There is much evidence to tie the plan into several catastrophi c events that are taking place throughout the world, like the r ecent disastrous earthquake in China. The second conference also adopted the policy of euthanasia as policy for getting rid of the growing population of elderly people, and the delegates enthusiastically adopted the Russell term, \"useless eaters,\" as a code word to describe millions of people who, in the eyes of the COR, are \"surplus to requirements.\" There are some who may consid er \"depopulation\" of blacks, Asians and other colored races as a good idea. \"There are far too many Indians (Asian Indians), Ch inese and blacks already,\" a man wrote me, \"so why are you against this?\" The truth is that it is not only th ese races that are slated to be culled; the \"surplus to requireme nts\" industrial workers in the United States are also the ta rgets of the Global 2000 Report. Delegates to both COR meetings, one after another, expressed confidence in the ability to su ccessfully promote their plans. Twenty-fifth anniversary celeb rations held in Germany in December of 1993 were to mark what had been achieved thus far. It was also a personal vindicatio n for me, because when I first revealed the existence of th e COR in 1969, I was mocked and laughed to scorn. \"The whole idea is the figment your overripe imagination,\" one man wrote. Another said. \"Where is the documentation for your Club of Rome Report?\" So momentous was the December of 1980 meeti ng that one would have thought"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 21 the media would have done everything in its power to get a scoop. But this was not to be. The media threw a blanket of silence over the proceedings, with not a mention of it in the conventional press or on radio an d television. This is called \"freedom of the press\" — Americ an style. The American people are the most lied to, connived and cheated people in the world. We are also the most censored people - in this case, censorship by omission. What did the delegates want? Michael Harrington explained it: \"Willy Brandt wants social upheaval in Europe,\" and we should remember that the present so cial upheaval taking place in Germany is part of that plan. It is no accident. We should not think that social upheaval will not come to the United States. The COR had the cooperation of the most Socialist government America has ever had; the Carter administration, which is dedicated to implementing the Communist Manifesto of 1848, as we saw in the Carter foreign policy which sat the blaze of revolution in South Africa, the Philippines, Iran, Central America and South Korea. President Clinton and G.W. Bush picked up the mantel as we saw in Yugoslavia. Poland was destabilized through the removal of President Gereck, which was arranged by Richard Gardner, the former U.S. ambassador to Rome. One of the principal achievements arising out of the COR meeting was the pressure applied to President Reagan to retain the service of the Bank of International Settlements representative in the U.S., Paul Volcker, as head of the illegal Federal Reserve Banks. The Fede ral Reserve is not a U.S. Government institution, well-described by Louis T. McFadden, who called it \"the greate st swindle in history.\" It was Anthony Wedgewood-Benn, a very prominent Labor leader in Britain who insisted on the retention of Volcker, notwithstanding Reagan's campaign promises to rid America of"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"22 Dr. John Coleman the Volcker scourge. Benn felt that Volcker was the best man to bring \"class war\" to America. Benn nominated Rifkin to assist Volcker in this endeavor, which he said, \"will polarize the Americans.\" The COR adopted a plan to destabilize currency through higher, and constantly fluctuating interest rates. They wanted to get rid of Helm ut Schmidt, then Chancellor of Germany, because he had been instrumental in stabilizing international interest rates. Sir Peter Vickers Hall called for interest rates in the United States to be hiked to 20 percent, as the best way to end capital inve stments in industry. Volcker was careful not to show his face at the COR meeting, but it is believed that he was briefed by Hall of the Heritage Foundation. Stuart Butler, who was chief execu tive officer at Heritage, had this to say to the COR delegates: In the Reagan administrati on we have a right-wing government that will impose some radical left-wing ideas. There is no reason why Communi sts, anarchists, libertarians or religious sects (he was talking about Satanism, Voodoo, Black Magic, witchcraft etc.) should not put their philosophies forward. Butler suggested the old Socialist doctrine of \"free enterprise zones\" be pushed onto the Reagan administration. Free enterprise zones are found in places like Manila and Hong Kong, not to mention Mainland Ch ina. They are literally, \"slave shops.\" Butler called for free enterprise zones to be established in areas where industries had been uprooted and destroyed. Butler envisaged silent steel mills, shuttered machine tool factories and closed shipyards. Cottage-type \"industries\" so co mmon in Hong Kong would be a suitable means of employment for displaced persons from depopulated cities, according to the Post Industrial Zero Growth plan."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 23 CHAPTER 5 MEN ARE LIKE INSECTS I knew that not many readers were going to pay attention to this warning, written in 1981 a promise of a boom under the Reagan administration. But remember, nobody believed the documents that were found on the body of Lange, messenger of the Illuminati. The crowned heads of Europe were not in any mood to listen to \"scare re ports\" issued by the Bavarian government about the Illuminati's plans for a bloody upheaval in France! People do not like their equanim ity disturbed. As pointed out earlier, the COR represents the command structure of the Illuminati and the 13 top Illuminati families in the United States. Remember that the French Revol ution Jacobin plan called for the murder of millions of \"surplus to requirements\" French nationals, especially Breton Celti c Christians who bore the brunt of the savagery. With that in mind, the stat ement made by Mitterand at the COR meeting in De cember of 1980 is not to be taken lightly: Industrial capitalist developm ent is the enemy and the opposite of freedom. By that Mitterand meant indus trial development has given people a better life through c ooperation, i.e. industrial development, and when people have a better life they are inclined to have larger families. Therefore, industrial capitalist development is the \"enemy of freedom,\" simply because large areas of cooperation (industrial development) are prone to consume more of their (the Co mmittee of 300) natural resources. This was the twisted logic behind the Club of Rome policies."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"24 Dr. John Coleman In a follow-up COR meeting held in Paris in March of 1982, Aurellio Peccei, founder of the Club, made the following statement: Men are like insects. They prolife rate too much . . . It is about time to put on trial the concept of nation states obstacles to world culture. Christianity makes proud men; a mercantile society, which creates nothing but dead culture and classical music, oppressive signs on paper. Whether believed or not, my pa per is intended as a warning to the citizens of the United States that the equivalent of the Jacobin terror mobs will be unleashed upon our unsuspecting nation in due time. Jacobin-style mobs will be employed to bring about drastic changes in the way that we live in America, changes which could last for as long as a thousand years. The COR's policy is fewer and fewer people, consuming less and less and requiring less services, by whatever means. It is a complete reversal of our society where more and more people demand better goods, services and life style, which is the essence of a productive society in a republican form of government. Significantly, Peccei said nothing about the one occult theocracy which passes itsel f off as a religion, but which it is not, being a political and econom ic system designed to control the lives of men, down to the la st detail, as we saw in the Bolshevik Revolution.

We use the image of man or man in the universe to refer to the set of assumptions held about the human being's origin, nature, abilities and characteristics, relationship with others and place in the universe. A coherent image might be held by any individual or group or political system, a church or civilization. Most societies have an image of man, which defines his social nature. For example, an image of man is thus a gestalt perception of human kind, both individual and collective in relation to self the society and the cosmos. This is unadulterated nonsense, occult hocus-pocus designed to deceive the unwary. For most, assumptions about the nature of human beings are held subconsciously.

Our highly developed technological system led to vulnerability and breakdown. The interconnected impact of society problems that have emerged now pose a serious threat to our civilization. In other words, our Western ideals, belief in family, the sanctity of marriage, belief in one's country, na tional pride, national sovereignty, pride in our religious beliefs, pride of race, our trust in an omnipotent God and our Christian beliefs, are all obsolescent — according to the COR's Harmon.

Somehow the breakdown of the old images has been seen to lead more to despair rather than to a search for a new image. Despite the pessimism implied by a lagging dominant image, there are numerous indications that a new anticipatory image of mankind may be emerging. What this mumbo-jumbo really means — what Harmon was really saying — was that industrialized soci eties, like the United States and Japan must be destroyed as industrialized society has become unmanageable.

The Christian image of mankind must be replaced, this according to high priest Harmon. Man must stop thinking that he needs God. It is high time for man to believe that he is in control of his destiny and can stand on his own feet. What is lacking in our Christian churches today is the knowledge and understanding of the occult and the occult- ridden secret societies that ar e everywhere to be found. Our Christian teachers and readers need to become versed in the field of religious theocracies, and where they are leading the Church of Christ.

There are minor differences in style rather than substance, but the basic premise that the world must become a Socialis t state that will advance to Communism is a common thread found in both documents. The underlying, hidden theme is th e same as the Communist- Bolsheviks taught: \"Get in our wa y at your peril. Terror tactics are our tactics, and we will use them without fear or favor. We will eliminate you if you oppose us.\" As I said earlier, the New Age ideal as set forth by Harmon is thousands of years old. The Druids burned people in wicker baskets as sacrifices to their gods and their women priestesses let the blood of their victims flow into buckets. The French Revolution took the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent victims, as did the Bolshevik Revolution. The Communists were proud of the wa y they tortured and murdered millions of Christians. What makes us think that the COR, an occult theocracy will not do likewise when it gets the chance? These are the murderous, spiritually dead people we are dealing with, the people described by Christ as the rulers of darkness, the wicked in high places, and it is high time that every one of us, whether Japanese or American, awoke to the dangers facing civilization.

Early in 1963, a certain assassination bureau, whose name I am not at liberty to disclose, signed a contract with the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations. Note the misuse of the words, \"human relations.\" The contract was farmed out to several U.S. subsidiaries of Tavistock, notably, Stanford Research, the Institute of Social Relati ons and the Rand Corporation. Tavistock then made public the results of the \"scientific studies\" conducted by these think tanks a nd then fed the information to NATO's political wing.

It was anticipated that the Human Relations Magazine report would turn public opinion in the United States against space programs. After the murder of Kennedy, it seemed for a while, as if our space program would be abandoned, then came the stunning election victory of Rona ld Reagan in November, which led to the unprecedented meeting of high-level executives of the COR in Washington in November of 1980. As I often indicated in my lectures and writings since 1969, the world is run by very different people from those we see up front, an observation first made fa mous by Lord Beaconsfield (Disraeli). We are from time to time given ample warning of the truth of this observation, but in a veiled manner. It seems that the would-be rulers of the One World Government are sometimes quite unable to contain themselves when they pull off a big victory.

Disraeli, the legendary British Prime Minister and great parliamentarian protege of the Ro thschilds, gave an account of the workings of the secret gove rnment of Britain entitled, Conningsby, which gave notice that secret groups controlling the British and United States Governments intended to rule the world. Secret societies have been and remain the nemesis of the free world. As long as we have such diverse large numbers of secret societies flourishing in our midst, we not free men. No amount of flag-waving and banging the big drum of patriotism on the 4 th of July can change this stark truth. The secret societies have leaders that rule the world from behind the scenes, and, if we are to understand current events in politics and economics, then we better have a good knowledge of secret societies. The Club of Rome (COR) is but an extension, an ongoing alliance of the ancient Black Nobility families of Europe, dominated by occult beliefs an d practices dating back for thousands of years. The ancient rite of Misraih of Egypt, (before the arrival of the sons of Noah), Syria, Babylon and Persia were transported to Europe by the Vene tian and British oligarchists. The Bogomils, the Catharis — thes e are the types of \"religious beliefs\" that brought in their wake an assault on Christian views and Western principles. The Ea stern love of intrigue was transplanted in the West, with results so far reaching that they beggar description, often beyond the scope of our imagination. The damage these secret societie s do is awesome. For instance, we know that the Crimean War was started on a whim of Freemasonry, with WWI and WWII following much along the same lines.

One of th e most powerful men in British politics during that unseemly peri od in the history of Great Britain was Lord Palmerston, who belonged to many secret societies, and whose leadership of the Parliament was influenced by Freemasonry. Palmerston himself admitted to this being true. Thus it behooves We, the People, to wake up to the fact that we are in contention with spiritually wicked men in high places. We are not up against mere physical entities. The unseen force is stronger than the seen force.

One of the American Club of Rome 's main achievements to date was to remove the space program from the military and give it to NASA, a civilian body. Former President Eisenhower was more than happy to comply with the instructions he received from London to implement the change. But the move may have backfired. In May of 1967, a profiling study of NASA undertak en by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations found that NASA had become a major employer of industrial and science personnel, the exact opposite of the de- industrializing plans of COR. The Tavistock re port set alarm bells ringing in the offices of the seditionists and traitors, from Colorado to Washington to New York. Their response was a \"select committee\" under the direction of NATO Robert Strauss Haptfz, U. S. ambassador to NATO. The job of the committee was to immediately institute damage control measures, which it was hoped would cripple NASA.

It was at this meeting that Brzezinski obtained inspiration for his book, Between Two Ages: The Technotronic Era, which I quoted in length in my book, The Committee of 300. In this book, Brzezinski lays out the ideal of a Socialist New World Order, based on Orwellian concepts; a world run by an intellectual elite and a super-culture based on a network of electronic communications, in a concept of regionalism with symbolic national sovereignty. The Deauville conference concluded th at there must be a convergence of ideals between the United States and the USSR (an idea totally rejected by Stalin who was a real thorn in the side of the Committee of 300). The \"convergence\" would produce a One World Government to run global affairs on a true basis of crisis management and global planning. It will be recalled that this Rockefeller suggestion was scorned by Stalin and it was his re fusal to join the New World Order that led to the Korean War. Even the twisted, censored, heavily laced with inaccuracies history of WWII written by paid Rockefeller writers shows that the United States has never fought Communism. How could it, when the elite of the Wilson era and the Wall Street bankers were the very ones who placed Lenin and Trotsky in power in collusion with Lord Alfred Milner and the City of London bankers?

Unable to control Hitler, the international bankers had to destroy him. The net outcome of WWII was the emergence of a stronger, more formidable Communist system, able to spread its tentacles over the globe. The Soviet Union went from a regional power, to a global power. WWII cost millions of lives and billions of dollars, and it was all because of the shocking misuse of resources by men with grandiose plans to rule the wo rld and I am not talking about Hitler and Stalin. I am talking a bout the CFR, the RIIA, the Club of Rome and the Committee of 300. If anyone can give me a list of the alleged benefits accrued from WWII or explain the \"freedoms\" that it has brought to the people of America, or Europe, I would like to hear from them. As far as I can see, the world is a thousand times worse off now than it was in 1939. Socialism has taken hold of the United States as a consequence of WW II. Our industries have been destroyed; millions of workers have lost their jobs. We can't blame Hitler (or Stalin) for this contrived state of affairs. Peccei put it in prospectiv e when he said: . . . Since the millennium was approached in Christendom, in large, masses of people are really in suspense about impending events of things unknown which could change their collective fate entirely. M an does not know how to be a truly modern man.

Peccei says that \"man invented the story of the bad dragon, but if ever there was a bad dragon on earth, it is man himself.\" Peccei then gives the whole game plan away: Since man opened the Pandora's box of new technology, he has suffered uncontrollable human proliferation; the mania for growth, the energy crisis, actual potential scarcities, degradation of the environment, nuclear folly, and countless other afflictions."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"58 Dr. John Coleman CHAPTER 12 THE MESS OF TH E MONEY SYSTEMS In these few words are found the entire plans for mankind mapped out by the COR for the Committee of 300. This answers in a nutshell, th e most often asked question: \"Why would they want to do these things?\" Here we have an esoterist of the worst degree telling the people that the COR speaking on behalf of its masters of the Committee of 300 knows what is best for the entire world. It was not long after his speech that Peccei adopted the \"World Dynamics\" model, constructed for the Committee of 300 by Jay Forrester and Dennis Meadows, which is a global planning model supposedly to demonstrate the un-sustainability of complex systems to show that smaller-in-scale structures should predominate in the world economy. To this end, of course, the Meadows-Forrester report based its ideas exclusively on the negative, restrictiv e economic studies done by Malthus and Adam Smith, the British East I ndia economist, who formulated Britain's \"free trade\" policy. The Forrestor Meadows mythical economy ignores the ingenuity of man, who will fi nd an endless supply of new minerals and or resources of which we as yet have no knowledge. Actually, what is depleting our resources is paper money, if we can call anything paper, \"money.\" The money system of the United States is a gigantic mess thanks to the meddling of those in the oligarchial hierarchy, whose intention is to make slaves of us all."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 59 Only un-backed paper money is doing damage to the natural resources of the globe, and by un -backed, I mean U.S. dollars are not backed by silver and gold as called for by the Constitution of the United States of America. In fact there is no lawful money in the United States at this time, nor has there been since the advent of the Federal Reserve Act. It is no wonder that we are in such a financial mess, when a private consortium (The Federal Reserve Bank) was permitted to take charge of our money and use it in whatever manner it deemed fit, without the people to whom it belongs having the slightest control over it. An economy based on gold and silver will renew and recycle natural resources. In nuclear fi ssion, a fission-based society would open new windows of op portunity. Yet Meadows and Forrestor ignored the magic of the fusion torch. How the COR could ignore new technologies is easily explained. Quite simply they did not want them. New technologies mean new jobs and a more prosperous people. More prosperous people mean an increase in the population of North America, which COR spokes men say is undesirable and a threat to life on Earth! The truth of the matter is that we haven't even begun to tap the natural resources of the earth. The whole New Dark Ages, New World Order concept, from Russell to Peccei, to Meadows and Forrestor is fatally flawed a nd designed to retard industrial growth, jobs, and, finally, a cull ing of the popul ation of the world. (NOTE: The United Nations Conference on Population Control held in Cairo in August of 1994, was but an extension of the Global 2000 plan to kill 2.5 billion people by the year 2010.) Regarding nuclear power, Peccei said:"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"60 Dr. John Coleman I am more pessimistic and radical t han my friends in judging the nuclear solution. I am not in a position to judge or even guess whether this can be made clean, secure and reliable for human society as many scientists and almost the totality of the political class and industry affirm. I am however ready to argue that what is not reliable, secure and clean enough, is human society itself. I have devoted many pages to describing its state of disorder, its incapacity to govern itself, to act rational and humanely and to ease the tensions which tear it apart and hence I cannot believe that in its present state it can go nuclear. This is almost a carbon copy of what the environmentalist groups are saying about nuclear power, which just happens to be the cheapest, cleanest and safest source of energy available to the world. It is also a vehicle which would create millions of new, stable, long term steady jobs. I cannot imagine that this same society will be in a condition within a couple of decades to safely host and protect several thousand huge nuclear power stations and to transport across the planet and process even a quarter of the deadly plutonium 239, ten thousands of times greater than what it would take to kill all of us living today. For mankind to go nuclear without first being prepared in its entire human system for its reckle ss and irresponsible behavior is the question; the real problems are not technical or economic, but political, social and cultural. Those who are today inebriated by just small doses of the nuclear hard drug as I have called it, and are pushing a program to disseminate it in the body of society are in effect condemning their successes to live entirely by it tomorrow."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 61 And why not! Nuclear energy is the greatest discovery the world has ever known. It will set us free. That is why the enemies of mankind, the Club of Rome, are fighting on every front to downgrade nuclear energy to make out that it is such a terrible danger to us. Nuclear energy is safe. Thus far, nobody had been killed by a nuclear generated en ergy while working in such a power station. It will give us great freedom, it will revitalize our industrial capacities - it will breathe new life into them and it will give us greater freedom as individuals, because millions more of us will have long term, well paid-jobs. Gr eater freedom is an anathema to the Club of Rome. The Cl ub of Rome wants less personal freedom, not more of it. That is the bottom line on the issue of nuclear energy. Peccei went on to dismiss nuclear fission in one sentence and he said: Its feasibility has yet to be demonstrated, but no future plan can at present be reliably based upon it. There is little probability of energy becoming plentiful, inexpensive and environmentally and socially unobjectionable. If abundant, cheap, clean energy were available, the prospects of technology intensifying solutions for food and materials would be very good. Now, he stopped short there, but here's the rub: The Club of Rome does not wish us to intensify our technological capabilities and produce more food and produce a better living standard. It has designed a program ca lled Global 2000, which calls for the death of 2 billion people by the year 2010, although the bottom line figure that I have seen in the report states that the Club of Rome will be satisfied if 400 million people are wiped off the face of the Earth by the year 2010."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"62 Dr. John Coleman Peccei made it quite plain that th e new scientific discoveries and new technologies as a means of increasing material progress is not desired by the Club of Rome, who pretends to be the sole arbiter of global planning under NATO. This, of course, is after they have taken in and subdued a rebellious Russia. And I say again, that what we see in the world today is a disagreement between America and Russia. Peccei used the artificially-created oil embargo of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, as a warning. He said this brought \"many people into alignment with Club of Rome thinking.\" It was in effect an entry point for many people to break with former ways of thinking and to take the Club of Rome's advice much more seriously. I have said before that these people sometimes cannot keep their mouths closed. Here you have a man openly admitting that the 1973 Arab-Israeli war was a contrived situation of a phony oil shortage in the world and by so doing, convinced more people th at smaller is better and more beautiful and that industrial progress had to be curbed. The rationale of the Club of Rome , of course, is that proof of these statements as made in the Forrester-Meadows reports, was brought home to many people by the 1973 oil embargo. During the period 1973-74, the Club of Rome's influence over the policies of many governments expanded dramatically. Queen Juliana of the Netherlands ordered an exhibition of the ideas of the Club of Rome to be displayed in the center of Rotterdam. Soon after that the Club held meetings with the French minister of finance and put in place the so-called Recontless International's to discuss the implications of the Club of Rome's report."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 63 CHAPTER 13 DIRE PREDICTIONS In 1972, Peccei was invited by the Council of Europe to present a paper called the \"Limits of Growth in Perspective\" before a special session of European parliamentarians. In early 1974, thanks to the work done by Peccei and Austrian chancellor Bruno Krysky - Willy Brandt's Social Democratic friend — ten members of the Club of Rome held a private meeting with several heads of state, including former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeaux of Canada, Joop Den Uyl a former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, former president of the Swiss Confederation Nello Tiello, the representatives of Algeria and Pakistan and so on. In the words of Peccei, the seeds of doubt were sown. The Forrester-Meadows report also triggered very extensive opposition from industrialists and other people who realized that zero-growth policies would never fit the United States of America. In consequence of th at realization, an attempt was made by the Club to secure a counter-movement headed by M. Misarovick and Edward Pestell, w ho declared that the aim of the Club of Rome was programming organic growth: \"The world has a cancer and the cancer is man,\" said Pestell. Then the COR called for the development of a master plan leading to the creation of a new mankind, in other words, a New World Order run by these people."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"64 Dr. John Coleman The Club of Rome was to move into several Third World countries, including Iran, Egypt and Venezuela, Mexico and Algeria, after which they were invited to join, but declined do so. A blueprint of the United Natio ns Institute of Training and Research called Projects of the Future, by Club of Rome member Irvin Lazlow was merely a bitter denunciation of industrial growth and urban ci vilization. He denounced the present policies of industrialization of the United States of America. He denounced the middle class and he demanded, as Lenin did before him, the total destruction of the American middle class, that unique institution, that organism, that keeps the United States from going th e way of the Greek and Roman empires. In this, Lazlow was ably helped by COR paid servants, Cyrus Vance and Henry Kissinger. Many of the Socialists named in this monograph met regularly with Vance and Kissinger. As I mentioned in an earlier wo rk, the Club of Rome sponsored a project to rewrite the book of Genesis, to replace the Bible's injunction that man has dominion over nature. Other sympathizers of the Club of Rome included Cyrus Vance and Jimmy Carter himself, as well as Sol Linowitz, Phillip Klutznick, William Ryan — of the Jesuit Order out of Toronto and Peter Henriatt, who was a liberation theology expert. These people all met under the auspices of the Club of Rome in order to promote a world-wi de campaign of religious fundamentalism that could be us ed to subvert world order and existing governments when the time is right, and that plan is a work in progress.

There is tremendous pressure against nucle ar energy - and we have seen"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 65 action on all fronts; judicial, economic, social and political. But according to studies conducted at West Germany's Arken University covering the effects of nuclear weapons, if only 10 percent of the nucle ar weapons of the super powers were detonated, the by-product woul d include a very significant amount of Cesium isotope, which, it was projected, would be assimilated into the iodine track within the living process. Sufficient enough such radioactiv e Cesium could be generated to kill all higher forms of life affected by it throughout the entire world. But this of course is just anot her sheer horror st ory put out by the Club of Rome, just as the fe ar of a thermonuclear war is a horror story manipulated by the brain-washers on both sides of the Atlantic. The idea behind it is to make the very name \"radioactive\" a horror word in the minds of people in the majority of the world's population. Thus the fear generated against the peaceful use of nuclear energy, has been very, very strong and has successfully subverted a number of significan t construction plans and put on hold, scores of nuclear power plants that were to be built in the United States during the next ten years. The only danger which gives nightmares to some honest people, is the fear that either a nuclear plant might be hit by a powerful nuclear explosion, or that some highly-trained anti-nuclear fanatic might penetrate the nucle ar plant and blow it up, which, of course, would cause a secondary explosion. However, attempted sabotage of nuclear plants as conclusive evidence proved at Three Mile Island is not likely to do anything near the damage that would be caused by detonation of nuclear weapons. Lives are in jeopardy right now from scores of man-made viruses like HIV and Ebola Fever, in which nuclear energy plays no part whatsoever."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"66 Dr. John Coleman The study, using standard technique s, showed that even by the most conservative estimates, more than 1 million jobs were lost through elimination of nuclear energy installations already committed for construction and those already operating in the middle of 2008. Yet, not one single person has been killed by commercial fission energy generation in the United States! That is right; not one single person di ed in the so-called \"nuclear disaster\" at the Three Mile Island power station, which was not an accident, but a deliberately planned act of sabotage. In the same time fram e, millions have died of Aids, and millions more are going to die, thanks to the Global 2000 genocidal plans. Over 50,000 people die on the roads in Am erica in auto accidents each year, but so far, in more than four decades, nuclear power stations in the United States have not killed one single person! But over 100 million lives have been jeopardized by the pro anti-nuclear Club of Rome and NATO forces, which are constantly brainwashing this nation with a barrage of antinuclear propaganda. The interesting thing about it is this: The human body itself produces radioactivity to the point that prominent physicists a few years ago proposed that no more than two persons be allowed in the same room at one time. And another thing, a mountain ski trip or a flight in an airliner exposes a person to far more radioactivity than leaning against the wall of a nuclear power station for a year. Another interesting point, a coal -burning plant gives off more radioactivity into the atmosphere per kilowatt, than a fission plant does.

And it can be done. Therefore the anti-nuclear fana tics, who have sabotaged this country's nuclear program, have been true to their denunciation of the accumulation of radioactiv e fuel wastes. With the coming on-line of breeder reactors the fractional amount of unprocessed waste, which is under five percent, can still be reduced further. By using the particle beam programs as inve nted and set up by the genius of Dr. Edward Teller, accelerated neutron beams can be applied to unwanted waste, and that could be completely neutralized by transforming it through controlled neutron bombardment. This has been done and can be done, and is fully practicable, and is certainly not costly. Since the 1970's, we have s een the Club of Rome wage a tremendous war against nuclear en ergy programs in this country, which they have either killed outright through the fears of the environmentalists, or through withdrawing financing for these installations or a combination of both. All this has had the net effect of driving up by billi ons of dollars, the costs of construction of the nuclear power plants, and of course, the costs of eventually generating energy from these plants. A nuclear power plant is normally easy to complete within a matter of four years but of course, if the time of construction is doubled — such as has happened in America due to opposition from environmentalists, local and state government - the construction and financing charge s send the final price of the plant zooming out of sight. These costly delaying tactics co mbined with the Club of Rome banker's high interest rates, which amount to plain outright usury brought nuclear power plant construction to a virtual halt in the U.S., and it is more crucia l in 2008 with the soaring prices of crude oil, that nuclear -fired power plants be built."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"68 Dr. John Coleman Antinuclear power generating stations have to be one of the great success stories on the books of the Club of Rome.

Roosevelt in 1938. Of course the \"special agreement\" began long before that. Some people have written to me to say, \"You must be wrong, as Churchill wasn't even the Prim e Minister of England in 1938.\" Certainly, but since when do th ese people worry about titles? When the infamous Balfour Treaty was accepted, did these people go to the Prime Minister of England, who was ostensibly in control of Britain? No, th ey submitted instead a lengthy memorandum to Lord Rothschild, and it was Lord Rothschild who did the final drafting of the tr eaty that gave away Palestine to the Zionists, which Britain had no right to give, as it did not belong to them. We found the same thing happening with Roosevelt and Churchill. Churchill was not the pr ime minister in 1938, but that did not stop him negotiating on behalf of the people who owned him, body and soul; the Committee of 300. Churchill received his training in the Boer War in South Africa, and he was always a member and messenger of th is elite group for his entire lifetime. Some indication of the type of strategy adopted by Britain is provided in the book published at the end of WWII by Elliot Roosevelt, son and wartime aide to Franklin Roosevelt entitled, As I Saw It. Elliot Roosevelt documented the key features of Franklin Roosevelt outlining U.S. post war policy to Churchill. Of course, Churchill had no intention of following it; he knew very well, that the power to subvert whatever proposals Roosevelt made, lay with the Committee of 300 that runs America."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"72 Dr. John Coleman British Socialist agents of change infiltrated the United States by the score, including Walter Lippmann, who was the top propagandist at Tavistock. It wa s Lippman who introduced Lord John Maynard Keynes, the \"mar velous\" economist to an unsuspecting America, and it was Keynesian economic that ruined the economy of the U.S. It was Keynes who introduced schemes like special drawing rites, the \"multiplier\" theory, and other grotesquely immoral, wicked, vile injustic es imposed upon almost the entire human race by the small minority that runs the world. And we need to realize that this is no empty phrase. These people do indeed run the world and it is useless to say, \". . . this is America and we have a Constitution and it can't happen here.\" The Constitution of the United States has been trampled under foot and has been totally and t horoughly subverted, so that today it is almost of no force and effect whatsoever. Rockefeller created the Foreign Aid scam. It is the biggest rip- off the world has ever seen outside of the Federal Reserve banks. It makes nations entirely dependent on the dole, on handouts from the United States, which has a two-fold purpose: ■ It keeps these nations subserv ient to the will of their masters in the Council on Foreign Relations. ■ It taxes the United States tax payer beyond his capacity to pay and keeps him so busy earning a living just keeping his head above water, that he has no time to look around to see what is causing his misery. This scheme began in 1946. Kissinger introduced hooliganism into world politics. Julius Klein of the OSS gave Kissinge r his army job as General Kramer's driver. Kissinger has acted like a hooligan in world politics ever since the British took him over and has cost the American image and the public dearly."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 73 It is mainly the work of Kissi nger that brought on the agony of the starving millions in Africa and which has caused nations to bend and hand over their sovereign integrity. It is amazing, and could never ha ve happened three or four years ago, but it is happening right now, under our very noses in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, where the IMF, the illegal organization of the One World Government, th e bastard child of the Club of Rome, is forcing nations to bow the knee and hand over their sovereign integrity and their raw materials or be bankrupted. This One World international bank was set up to rob, strip, and denude every weak country of its natural resources. This is what the IMF is all about. The IMF is one of the key factors in the Club of Rome's ability to dominate so many nations. Now, I don't believe that I am better informed than those Senators and Congressmen in Washington and I don't earn anything like their salaries, yet these so-called representatives of We, the People, support unconstitutional funding of the bandit International Monetary Fund, wh ich will eventually, take over the credit and monetary policies of the United States, thereby enslaving the people in a On e World Government state. Our representatives — if they ever were our representatives — could bring order and stability back to the United States by the stroke of a pen, if only we had ev en a handful of legislators who would be willing to obey the Constitution. We could begin a new industrialization of this country by abolishing the Federal Reserve Board; by deciding upo n an equitable system of distribution and by bringing in nuc lear power, not only into this country, but into all developing countries. I believe we would embark on a period of Utopia for this world, such as we have never seen before . That, of course is entirely at variance with the plans of the Club of Rome, not only for this country, but also for the rest of the world."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"74 Dr. John Coleman There are several interesting aspe cts of the work of the Club of Rome, one, as I have previous ly mentioned, being the Global 2000 genocidal plan, which is based on the Draper Fund Population Crisis Committee report, supported by Gen. Maxwell Taylor and others in the military. For those of you who have asked me about certain people in the military, I suggest you ask them whether they support the Draper Fund Population Crisis Committee's findings and the Global 2000 genocidal report. Gen. Taylor starts from the ridiculous presumption from which the Malthusians all start, wealth being derived from natural resources. Gen. Taylor argues that the population of the developing nations consumes too large a portion of raw materials, which will be needed for the elite in the coming centuries."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 75 CHAPTER 15 GLOBAL 2000 REPORT Therefore, the argument goes, we must act now to keep consumption as low as possible by cutting off technology and keeping food in short supply. We must be prepared to let Th ird World populations starve, so that their country's raw materials are not absorbed by their nationals, but are available fo r the rulers of the world. That is the underlying premise of the Global 2000 Report and Gen. Maxwell Taylor's Draper Fund Population Crisis Committee. It is not surprising to find Robert McNamara was involved in that type of rationale. After all, we know very well the role McNamara played in Vietnam and we know perhaps le ss well, the role-played by the Club of Rome in formulating a policy of genocide, which was carried out by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. That plot was hatched and set in motion in Cambodia as an experiment. And don't think that the same thing couldn't happen in America; it can and it will. Taylor and McNamara were great proponents of deploying NATO outside of theater (Europe) in violation of its Charter to operate only in Europe. In other words, using NATO troops, recalcitrant nations will be coerced into paying their usury-debts to the IMF, under threat of an invasion. That is really the bottom line of the whole thing, a threat against civilized conduct."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"76 Dr. John Coleman Our civilization and our heritage are at stake; handed down by the solons of Athens and the Ionian city-state republics so that we can trace the impulse to gove rn, our Christian ideals, and two of the features of Christianity being central to this ideal. We must govern ourselves by the book of Genesis, \"be fruitful, multiply and fill the Earth and subdue it.\" We can increase and sustain human life and make it excellent and far better than it is now. Not for the few, w ho know the esoteric rules and the secret laws of cultism and occultism, but for the majority, the great majority whom Christ said He came to make free, and again I use this strictly in a non-religious context. We must govern ourselves under th e influence of the Christian principles, exemplified by Chri st, by perfecting His rational powers of mind and expressing Hi s faith in God, a living God, who will always treat human life as sacred. We must not allow these occult black magic artists to trick us into believing that humanity is a mass of people. That is a lie. Humanity is not a mass; the very idea that each of us is an individual is brought out by the fact that we have individual sets of fingerprints. There are no two sets of fingerpri nts alike in the whole world. Therefore, we are not a mass of people, we are individuals. We must gather technological in formation and put it to good use before the Club of Rome reduces us to a babbling troop of easily managed sub-humans, totally dependent on them for a hand-out and for our very existence, whic h promises to be very meager. Any head of a nation who accepts the cult of the Club of Rome's Malthusian policies, which simply stated means that only a few must benefit at the expense of the many, has doomed himself and his people to a thousand years of slavery."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 77 Under Malthusian restraints, no nation can expand or grow because if it does, it will use up the natural resources that the Club of Rome says belong to the few, the ruling class. Such a nation is doomed to perish because the evil influences that follow such a policy cannot survive in the light of day. This is what is behind the so -called \"conditionalities\" imposed by the IMF on Brazil and Mexico. The IMF actually wants those nations to remain poor. Therefore, it makes conditions for loans so impossible to comply with, that nations burn themselves out simply trying to repay the interest. Thereby, they hand themselves over, body and soul, to the dictates and control of the IM F, which as I have said, is the financial arm of the Club of Ro me. We must not stand by and allow these things to happen. The Club of Rome is fully aware, even if our people are not, that every successful 19 th century industrial country except for Britain, was motivated by the American system of political economy and yet, no university in America teaches this today. They are afraid to teach it. Socialists Professor Laski of the Fabian Society forbad it. But we see it before our very eyes — only in Japan is the American system still successfully applied. This accounts for the apparent superiority of the Japanese econom y vis-a-vis that of America. We were forced to abandon our own American political economy system in favor of the Black Nobility's idea of how things ought to be run, which is world Socialism in action. But Japan baulked. The performance of the Japanese economy is proof positive that the American system works if given a chance. But the U.S. has this cancer upon its society called the Club of Rome, which is bloc king government, blocking our legislatures, blocki ng progress in the nuclear energy field, destroying our steel mills, our auto industry and our housing industry, while the Japanese are forging ahead. Of course, they"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"78 Dr. John Coleman too are slated for a big setback and as soon as the Club of Rome feels strong enough, it will turn its attention to the Japanese who will suffer the same fate. We must not allow this to ha ppen. We must fight to keep America a civilized, industrial nation. We must find leaders who will once again follow the policies of George Washington and in so far as political economy is concerned, cast out the likes of Keynes, Laski, Kissinger and the Bush family who have brought this country to the point of ruination, which is just about the point of ruination \". . .Yes! We're on the eve of destruction.\" History teaches that Christianity emerged as an institutional force in opposition to the powers of darkness. Christ said, \"I come to give you light and freedom.\" He was speaking to the people wh o at the time were considered nothing but the scum of the Earth by the elite minority."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 79 CHAPTER 16 THE BLACK NOBILITY Christianity produced the most pow erful form of civilization in the matter of state policy and culture, which is why the Club of Rome is so bitterly opposed to th e Christian doctrine. As far as I know the last effort to crea te a single state of Western Christendom was defeated around 1268 A.D. by the Venetian- directed Black Guelph who defeated the forces associated with Alighieri Dante, the great Italian poet. Many attempts were made in Europe to make a new kind of state. The sovereign nation stat e republic is based on shared usage of common language, re placing dialects, which were prevalent at that time. Dante' s design was good and it stood very well until it was defeated, which we know was as a direct result of crushing the republic for ces in England through the 1603 establishment of the British monarchy under the direction of the Venetian puppet, James I. When I say James I, Venetian puppet, I am talking about the Black Nobility. We know that because of this, every effort was made to crush this new form of nation state republicanism. That war is still going on today. The American War of Independence has never ended. It has been an ongoing \"battle\" from 1776, and since then America has lost two major battles: In 1913 we were defeated by two acts of the Federal Government in the imposition of a graduated income tax - a Marxist doctrine - and the imposition of the Federal Reserve banks, a privately owned banking monopoly."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"80 Dr. John Coleman But even before that, terrible blows were delivered to the American Republic through the passage of the \"specie resumption act\" in 1876-1879, when the United States surrendered its sovereignty over its national credit currency and debt policies and placed the m onetary policies of the young Republic at the mercy of the international merchants of the gold exchange in London. Internal pow er over our monetary affairs was thereafter increasingly at the beck and call of the powerful agents of the British and Swiss bankers via August Belmont, a relative of the Rothschilds who sent him to the U.S. to front for their interests, and the J.P. Morgan dynasty. Although the London gold exchange system itself collapsed in successive phases over the span between World Wars I and II, the Anglo-Swiss Venetian Fondi, th at is to say the people with the funds, established a virtual dictatorship over the world's monetary affairs under the Bretton-Woods agreement, the swindle of the century. The United States has the power to destroy all those chains that bind its people; it can, and it could, if only we could elect legislators who would place their country ahead of their own personal interests and set about destroying this monstrosity of Socialism, which has us by the throat, which we now call the Club of Rome. Several people have asked me, \"If what you say is true, why is it that our universities and schools don't teach the type of economics that you're talking about?\" Let me point out that lengthy centuries of dictatorship of London and the Swiss bankers over the world's monetary system and affairs is the absolute number one reason why no U.S. university's economic department or schools teach proper economics or uphold the bimetallism monetary system on which our Republic, the United States of America was based and which made the United States the richest and best run country in the world."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 81 If real economics were taught, Socialism would go out the window. Students would see exactly what is wrong with this country and begin to search for where to lay the blame. As long as we, as a nation, a llow unlawful subversion of our sovereignty through political a nd economic decision making and we subordinate ourselves to supranational monetary institutions such as the IMF and the Bank of International Settlements, as long as the American Bar Association, \"our\" lawyers, \"our\" government, \"our\" congressmen and \"our\" private sector economy continue to please these subversive monetary agencies, these supra national financial inst itutions, just as long will our country go to wrack and ruin. We should not have to please a ny supranational institution, or play by the rules that they wish to dictate to us. Just recently, we have seen again how Congress has gone along with the evil scheme of bailing out this despicable Laski-Keynes-Socialist inspired institute called the International Monetary Fund. We need to teach our people exactly what is going on with the IMF and the Club of Rome. Economics is not a subject that is really all that complicated. Once one grasps the principles, it is fairly easy to follow. Let me just give you some examples of how we have been betraying our selves by allowing the dictates of the Socialist international supranational organizations that have imposed themselves upon our nation like a cancer. Take the immediate post WWII wa r period; some 62 percent of our national labor force was employed in either the production of tangible goods or the transpor tation of those goods. Today, if we use the official statistics - which are highly unreliable at the best of times - less than 30 percent of our labor force is employed at this level. Unemployment is in the region of 20 percent. The shift in the co mposition of employment of the national labor force is the underlyi ng cause of inflation. That is principally where the trouble lies."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"82 Dr. John Coleman If we look at hist ory, especially of the 1870's, we observe a general lessening of costs of producing goods, a deflationary cycle in the advance of the pr oduction of wealth, caused chiefly by the influence of the American system of political economy, in fostering technological progress in the form of industrial progress and the rise in agricultural productivity. But from the take-over of the world's monetary affairs by the London gold exchange system held in the hands of a few during the 1880's, hideous depressions have followed one another in rapid succession and in between we have seen long spirals of inflation. This has been a direct product of the Malthusian forces that control this world who were asso ciated with the doctrines of John Stewart Mill, Harold Lask i and John Maynard Keynes. The policies of so-called economic freedom of the market place do nothing but increase the speculative investments in fictitious rent capitalization's and renter fina ncier forms of usury at the expense of investments in true technology and true progressive production of real and tangible goods. That is why I tell all my friends, \"stay away from the stock market.\" The stock market is a fictitious area of speculative investment, and it is not an area where money is invested in technological progress for the production of tangible goods in a progressive and orderly manner. Therefore, the stock market must collapse. It cannot be propped up forever nor hold itself up forever. It is a bubble of hot air, which will be pricked and when that happens, many are going to be hurt. The trick is to get people to liste n now before it happens. At the behest of the Club of Rome, the flow of credit has shifted away from production of goods and agricultural production towards non-goods-producing forms of financ ial investment. Of course this has created tremendous problems for the country."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Club of Rome 83 The shift in the composition of financial flows and employment was the cause of both periodic major depressions and long term inflationary movements built inside what is now our economic system. I did not intend this to turn into an exposition of economic facts, but sometimes it is necessary to bring these things to our attention. There is an evil force at work in America today, and it is called Socialism, on whose behalf the Club of Rome acts. It is a body dedicated to the dest ruction of the United States of America, as we know it. It is a body dedicated to ushering in the New World Order in which the so-called privileged few, the Committee of 300, will rule. Our fate will surely be decide d unless we can muster men of good will and force a change in the policies of our government. This can only come about by cleaning house, cleaning the Augean stables, and getting rid of such secret organizations as the Club of Rome, so that they are longer able to dictate the course of events and control the future of this great country. Unless and until we do that, we ar e headed for slavery in a One World Government-New World Order."}]
