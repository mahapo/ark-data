A n end run around sovereign- ty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish much more than the old fashioned frontal attack.\" Richard Gardner, leading American Socialist, Foreign Affairs, the journal of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), April 1974. In this, my third book (\"The Committee of 300\" and \"Diplomacy By Deception,\") I tell how Gardner's statement gives n otice of the Fabian Socialist agenda for the United States. The ideas, thoughts a nd people who have worked diligently to establish Socialism, the principal, f atal political disease of modern nations is explained in clear detail. There is an account of the various Socialists goals set by the British Fabian Society, whose motto is, \"Make Haste Slowly.\" When asked to explain Communism, Lenin replied, \"Communism is Socialism i n a hurry.\" Socialism has no where to progress but to Communism, is something I have often said. The book explains why so many of the ills that plague o ur society today have their ori- gin in careful Socialist planning and execution. Socialism is inherently evil because it forces peop le to accept deliberately engineered changes they have neither requested nor want. The power of Socialism is disguised in soothing terms and hides behind a mask of humanitari- anism. It is also found in far reaching, fundamenta l changes in religion, which the Socialists have long used as a potent vehicle for g aining acceptance, after which they spread their influence inside churches to the detriment of all religions. The goal of Socialism is the liquidation of the fre e enterprise system, which is true capitalism. Scientific Socialism goes under several disguises, and its pro- moters call themselves Liberals or Moderates. They wear no badge and are not recognizable, as they would be if they called thems elves Communists. There are more than 300,000 Socialists inside the U nited States Government, and careful estimates have it that in 1994, 87 perc ent of the members of Congress are Socialists.

Socialism is revolution without openly violent meth ods but never the less does the utmost violence to the psyche of the natio n. It is a movement governed by stealth. Its slow advance on the United States f rom its home base in England was almost imperceptible up to the 1950s. The Fabia n Socialist movement remains distinct from so called Socialist Party gro ups and its forward crawl was thus almost imperceptible to the majority of Americ ans. \"When you wound a Communist, a Socialist bleeds\" is a saying that dat es back to the early days of Fabian Socialism. Socialism ardently welcomes proliferation of centra l government power which they strive to secure for themselves, always pretending it to be for the com- mon good. The United States and Britain are full to the brim with false prophets pushing the New World Order. These Socialist missio naries preach peace and humanitarianism and common good. Fully aware that t hey could not overcome the resistance of the American people to Communism by direct means, the insid- ious Fabian Socialists knew they had to move silent ly and slowly, and avoid alert- ing the people to their real objectives. Thus was ' scientific Socialism' adopted as the way to overcoming the United States and making of it the leading Socialist country in the world. How far Fabian Socialism has succeeded, and where w e stand today is told in this book. Presidents Wilson, Roosevelt, Eisenho wer, Carter, Kennedy and Johnson were eager, willing servants of Fabian Soci alism. Their mantle was passed to President Clinton. Democracy and Socialis m go hand-in-hand. All United States presidents since Wilson have repeated ly stated that the United States is a Democracy, when in fact, it is a Confed erated Republic. Fabian Socialism directs the destiny of the world in a way which is disguised to render it unrecognizable. Socialism is the author of graduate d income tax, the destroyer of nationalism, the author of so-called \"free trade.\" This book is no dull account of the philosophies of Socialism, but a dynam- ic, dramatic telling of how it became the foremost menace to free men every- where, but more especially, in the United States, w hich has still to confront it, head-on. The bland, smooth surface of Socialism hid es its true intent: A Federal World Government under Socialist control, in which We, the People, will be their slaves in a New World Order of the New Dark Age."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"How Fabian Socialism Began and Subsequent History 1 1 HOW FABIAN SOCIALISM BEGAN AND SUBSEQUENT HISTORY \"Like all Socialists, I believe that the Socialist Society evolves in time into a Communist Society.\" — John Strachey, Labor Party Ca binet Minister. \"In American newspaper jargon, John Strachey would be described as 'Marxist No. 1' and the title would be deserved.\" \" Left News,\" March 1938. Fabian Socialism began with the Fabian Society, whi ch in their words, \"con- sists of Socialists who allied themselves with the Commun ist Manifesto of 1848,\" written by Karl Marx, a Prussian born Jew who lived the better part of his life in Highgate, London. In the \"Basis of the Fabian Socie ty\" we learn the following: \"It therefore aims at the reorganization of society by the emancipation of land and industrial capital from individual ownership an d vesting them in the community for the general benefit. In this way only can natural and acquired advantages of the country be shared by the whole pe ople...\" This was the principal that Fabian Socialism export ed to the United States, one which they have tirelessly forced upon the Amer ican people to the great detri- ment of the nation. Marx died in solitary \"digs\" in October of 1883, wi thout ever realizing the vision he shared with Moses Mendelssohn (Mendelssoh n is generally recognized as the father of European Communism), and was burie d in the small, walled Highgate Cemetery in North London. That the Communi st Manifesto gave life to Socialism, was admitted by Professor Harold Laski, the man most closely identi- fied with the movement from its inception, and up t o the time of his death in 1950. But Socialism actually, was born with the founding of the Ethical Society of Culture, formerly the Fellowship of New Life, in Ne w York. Although the politi- cal economy of John Stuart Mill as expressed in Hen ry George's Socialist book, \"Progress and Poverty\" the spiritual side of Social ism should not be ignored. Webb and his wife Beatrice ran the Fabian Society f rom its beginning. Most of the members of the Fellowship of New Life which pre ceded the Ethical Society"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"2 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship of Culture, were Freemasons affiliated with Madame Blavatsky's occult Theosophy to which Annie Besant also subscribed. Not that Laski was in any sense a \"spiritual man,\" being more like Marx than Ramsay McDonald, who went on to become prime minist er of England. Laski was a most powerful influence on scores of British political, economic and church leaders, and is credited with having compellingly i nfluenced Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. Victor Gollan cz, the Socialist publisher, said on many occasions that Socialism is necessary for world domination: \"Socialism centralizes power and makes individuals completely subject to those who control that power,\" the publisher said. Having withdrawn from the Fellowship of the New Lif e, Fabian Socialism tried several paths already trodden by Communists, Bakounists, Babuovists (anarchists) and Karl Marx, always vehemently denyi ng any connection with these movements. Consisting mainly of intellectuals , civil servants, journalists and publishers like the great Victor Gollancz, Fabi an Socialism had no interest in getting involved with street fighting anarchist rev olutionaries. The founder mem- bers of Fabian Socialism perfected the technique fi rst used by Adam Weishaupt — that of penetrating the Catholic Church and then \"boring away from inside until just an empty husk was left.\" It was called, \"penetration and permeation.\" Apparently neither Weishaupt nor Gollancz thought C hristians would be smart enough to see what was happening. Gollancz was reported as saying: \"Christians are no t exactly bright, so it will be easy for Socialism to lead them down the garden path through their ideals of brotherly love and social justice.\" Fabian Socialis m targeted political, economic and educational organizations, in addition to the Chris tian Church. Later Gollancz's Left Wing Books gave special discounts to Christians who were interested in Socialist ideas. On the selection committee of the Left Book Club were Gollancz himself, Professor Harold Laski, and John Strachey, a Labour Party member of Parliament. Gollancz, who also owned The Christian Book Club, w as a strong believer in Bolshevik Russia as an ally of Socialism. At the ur ging of Beatrice Webb, he pub- lished one of the Fabian Society's best sellers, \"O ur Soviet Ally.\" Fabian Socialism set out from the very beginning of its history to penetrate and permeate the British Labor and Liberal Parties, and, as it turned out, also the Democrat Party in the United States. It was relentl ess in its zeal and energy to cre- ate \"feminist\" Socialism, at which it was to become highly successful. Socialism succeeded in gaining the ascendency of school board s, town councils and labor unions under the guise of bettering the lot of the working man. Fabian Socialism's determination to capture education mirrors what Mad ame Zinoviev had long counseled in Bolshevik Russia. In 1950, Gollancz published, \"Corruption in a Profi t Economy\" a widely read work by Mark Starr. Starr was a product of Fab ian Socialism, and although"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Mow Fabian Socialism Began and Subsequent History 3 considered a bit rough around the edges (he began l ife as a coal miner,) he was not rejected by the Ivy League Socialists of Harvar d and Yale, to which the Fabian Society had gained access in its orderly progressio n up the ladder from its hum- ble beginnings in London. Starr emigrated to the Un ited States in 1928, after earn- ing his Socialist credentials at the National Counc il of Labour Colleges. Tutored by the formidable Margaret Cole, the founde r of the Fabian Research Center, Starr was THE link between the Fab ian Society in London and the burgeoning Socialist movements in America. Star r served at the Brockwood Labor College from 1925-1928, at an early age subje cted to a Socialist education second to none. The Socialist Garland Fund gave Sta rr a grant of $74,227, a con- siderable sum of money in those days. He later beca me educational director of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) from 1935 to 1962. His work on labor politics and labor education was outs tanding in the cause of Socialism. As far as Starr was concerned, education meant teaching that private profit was wrong and should be abolished. In 1941, Starr was appointed vice president of the American Federation of Teachers, an avante-garde Socialist teachers body o f the day. After taking American citizenship, Starr was named by President Harry Truman to the United States Advisory Commission, authorized by Public Ac t 402, \"to advise the State Department and the Congress on the operation of inf ormation centers and libraries maintained by the United States Governmen t in foreign countries, as well as on the exchange of students and technical e xperts.\" This was indeed a \"coup\" for Socialism in the United States! Fabian Socialism attracted many of the upper elite of society in Britain and the United States. It is said of American Socialist s that they \"aped their English betters, admiring their command of the language, th eir quick turn of phrase and their genteel respectability, perhaps personified b y Professor Graham Wallas, Sir Stafford Cripps, Hartley Shawcross and Richard Cros sman.\" Professor Graham Wallas lectured at the New School for Social Research in New York City, a Socialist \"think tank\" founded by the \"New Republic\" maga- zine, that catered for leftwing professors, of whic h the United States had more than its share. Wallas was one of the earlier intel lectuals to join the then nonde- script Fabian Society, which, back in 1879, faced a very uncertain future and was not considered to be a threat to Government or Chur ch. Wallas' early interest in education is mirrored by one of his earliest jobs — that of County School Management Committee of the School Board. As we sha ll see in other chapters, the Fabian Socialists hierarchy considered control of education the kingpin in their strategy to capture the world. That ideal was further reflected by Wallas' teachin g appointment at the London School of Economics, founded by Sydney Webb, and then still a fledg- ling Socialist institution of learning. Wallas had only four students in his class."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"4 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship Wallas believed that the way to Socialize a country was through applied psychol- ogy. The way to Socialize America, Wallas contended , was to take the mass of the population by the hand like children (he did not ha ve a very high regard for the standard of education in the United States) and lik e children, lead them one step at a time down the road to Socialism, to which I wo uld add, and ultimate slavery. Wallas is an important name in this account of Soci alism, as he wrote a book which was adopted, word-for-word by President Lyndo n Johnson, as Democrat Party official policy. The sinister creeping progress of Socialism that be gan to blanket England, might have been avoided, but for WWI. The flower of Christian British youth who would have resisted the onward march of this al ien concept, lay dead in the fields of Flanders, their lives uselessly thrown aw ay on a nebulous ideal of \"patri- otism.\" Numbed by the horrific loss of their sons, the older generation did not care about what Socialism was doing to their countr y, believing that \"there will always be an England.\" Social psychology was a weapon used deftly used to deflect attacks on American Fabianist organizations. Americans for Dem ocratic Action (ADA), said it was not part of the Fabian Society, and its mout hpiece, \"The Nation\" sought vehemently to deny attempts to tie the two in with each other. In 1902, Wallas was teaching outright Socialism at the Philadelphia University summer sessions. He had been invited to the United States by wealthy American Socialists who attended Oxford summer scho ols in 1899 and 1902, the period when the summer school indoctrination classe s were at the height of their popularity with rich Americans who had nothing bett er to do. The year 1910 found Wallas as the mentor of American Socialist le aders like Walter Lippmann, delivering the Lowell Lectures at Harvard. Graham W allas was recognized as being among the Big Four Socialist intellectuals in Britain, and as such, he was sought out by the American Socialist Ray Stannard B aker, the emissary Colonel Edward Mandel House sent to the Paris Peace Confere nce to represent him, and find out what the delegates were doing. Between 1905 and 1910, Graham Wallas wrote \"The Gre at Society\" which was to become the blueprint for President Johnson's program of the same name, and which embodied social psychology principles. Wa llas made it very plain, that the object of social psychology was to control huma n conduct, thus preparing the masses for the coming Socialist State that would ul timately lead them into slav- ery — although he was careful not to spell it out t hat far. Wallas became a con- duit into the United States for Fabian Socialists i deas, much of them going into Roosevelt's \"New Deal,\" written by Socialist Stuart Chase, Kennedy's \"New Frontier\" written by Socialist Henry Wallace and Jo hnson's \"Great Society\" writ- ten by Graham Wallas. From these facts alone, the t remendous impact of Fabian Socialism upon the American political scene can be gauged."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"How Fabian Socialism Began and Subsequent History 5 Like Professor Laski, Wallas had the same good disp osition and kindly nature which was to make such a big impact on polit ical and religious leaders in the United States. Both men were to be the Fabian S ociety's most successful mis- sionaries to universities and colleges all across t he United States, not to mention their impact on the leaders of the aggressive \"femi nist\" movement which was just getting started. Thus, from the beginning of Fabian Socialism in Ame rica, this dangerously radical movement was falsely clothed in a mantle of benigness that was able to deceive \"the very elect,\" to paraphrase the Bible. It was a cover for revolution on both sides of the Atlantic while remaining aloof fr om the violence generally asso- ciated with the word, \"revolution.\" History will on e day record that the Fabian Socialist revolution far exceeded in scope and brea dth the violent Bolshevik Revolution. While the Bolshevik Revolution ended mo re that fifty years ago, the labian Socialist revolution is still gathering mome ntum and growing ever stronger. This unobtrusive movement has literally \" moved mountains,\" and vast- ly changed the course of history, and nowhere more so than in the United States. The two guiding lights who remained in control of F abian Socialism to the end of their days were George Bernard Shaw and Sydn ey Webb. Later, they were joined by men like Graham Wallas, John Maynard Keyn es and Harold Laski, whose dream of a Socialist conquest of Great Britai n and the United States they knew could only be realized by the progressive weak ening of the financial system of each country, until they collapsed into a total welfare state. We see this now in effect having overtaken Britain which has become a bankrupted, welfare state. Fabian Socialism's second course of action was agai nst the constitutional separation of powers mandated by the United States Constitution. Professor Laski and his colleagues felt that if Fabian Socialism co uld remove this obstacle, they would have the key to dismantling the entire Consti tution of the United States. Thus, it was imperative that Socialism train and de ploy special change agents who would be in a position to undermine this, the m ost important provision in the Constitution. The Fabian Society set about doing ju st that, and the success of their mission can be seen in the shocking manner in which Congress blithely surren- ders its powers to the executive branch in a manner which can only be described not only as reckless, but 100 percent unconstitutio nal. A good example would be Line Item Veto powers given to the President Clinton in defiance of the Constitution. Another go od example was the surrender of powers in trade negotiations which properly belo ng in the House of Representatives. As we shall see in the chapters de aling with NAFTA and GATT, this is precisely what Congress has done, thereby w ittingly or unwittingly — it matters not — playing right into the hands of the S ocialist enemies of this Nation. Sydney Webb and George Bernard Shaw are the men who set the Fabian Socialist course: penetration and permeation, rathe r than anarchy and violent rev-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"6 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship olution. Both were determined to ensure that the pu blic be ted to believe that Socialism didn't necessarily mean LEFT, and certain ly not Marxism. Both jour- neyed to Bolshevik Russia at the height of the terr or, ignoring, rather than com- menting on the butchery that was public knowledge. Of the two, Webb was the more impressed with the Bolsheviks and wrote a work , \"Soviet Socialism — A New Civilization?\" It came out later, after a Sovie t foreign office official defect- ed, that Webb apparently did not actually write the book, which was the work of the Soviet Foreign Office. Shaw and Webb became known as the \"demons of Social ism waiting to be exorcised,\" before Socialism could unfold its wings and as Shaw put it, \"rescue Communism from the barricades.\" Although Shaw prete nded not to care about FORM, he nevertheless expressed the belief that Fab ian Socialism would become a \"constitutional movement.\" Even with the \"greats\" of Socialism pouring into the movement, Toynbee, Keynes, Haldane, Lindsay, H. G. Wells and Huxley, Shaw and Webb kept their grip on the London Fabian Society and steered it in the direction they had chosen so many years before. The nearly always penniless Shaw had his indigence relieved through mar- riage to Charlotte Payne Townshend, a lady of consi derable means, which was, as some would have it, is the reason why the irascible Shaw married her. This is born out by the fact that before the marriage vows were exchanged, Shaw insisted that he be taken care of in the form of a large prenupti al settlement. Shaw was no longer given to soap box orations nor b asement meetings, but aspired to mix socially with Socialism's upper crus t. Men like Lord Grey and Lord Asquith became his good friends, and while Sha w still took one or two trips to Moscow, he cooled toward Communism. Although an avowed atheist, this did not stop Shaw from cultivating those whom he felt c ould be used to further his career, such as Lord Asquith in particular. Shaw di d not take orders from anybody, let alone the \"newcomers\" like Hugh Gaitskell, futu re prime minister of England, and a protege of the Rockefeller family. Shaw defin itely considered himself as \"old guard\" along with Sydney and Beatrice Webb. Th ese tough, hardened pro- fessional Socialists weathered many a storm over po licy and never flinched in the face of often considerable outside opposition and \" family feuds.\" Fabian Socialism began life in 1883 as a debating s ociety, \"Nueva Vita\" (New Life) with meetings in a small room at 17 Osna burgh Street, London. It was not unlike the start of the German Nationalist Soci alist movement which Hitler later took over. One of the aims of \"Nueva Vita\" wa s to bring together in an amal- gam, the teachings of Hegel and St. Thomas Aquinas. But the word \"Socialism\" was not new, having been a round since 1835, long before \"Nueva Vita\" began its infant steps in 1883, the very evening that Marx went to his death. The leader of the group — numbering f our people — was Edward Pease, and their aim was to use education as a vehi cle for Socialist propaganda,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"How Fabian Socialism Began and Subsequent History 7 which was to have such a profound effect on educati on and politics on both sides of the Atlantic. This would seem to have been a tal l order for a group of men who did not have the required public school education, a necessity for would-be lead- ers in Victorian England, and yet, an examination o f the Fabian Society shows that is exactly what they accomplished. In rather grandiose style, the young men named thei r group after Quintas Fabian, a Roman general of note, whose tactics were said to be based upon wait- ing patiently for the enemy to make a mistake and t hen striking hard. The Irishman, George Bernard Shaw joined the Fabian Soc iety in May of 1884. Shaw tame from the Hampstead Historical Club, a Marxist reading circle. It is odd how both Shaw and Marx came to Socialism within a short distance of each other — Hampstead Heath is not that far from Highgate. And both frequented the British Museum. (I happen to know this area well, having li ved in the area of Hampstead and Highgate and spent many years of study at the B ritish Museum.) So in a sense, my perception of what Fabian Socialism was a bout, may have been clear- er because of these circumstances. Never admitting to knowing Marx, although he courte d his daughter Eleanor, Shaw is suspected of having been Marx's \"front runn er\" to bring Socialism home to audiences he, Shaw, addressed more often that no t, four times a week, any- where he could find them. A study that I made in th e British Museum leads me to believe that Communism invented Socialism as a vehi cle for its radical ideas that would not otherwise have gone down well in England or the United States, the two countries most prized for conquest by Communism . There is little doubt in my mind that Shaw was Marx in \"disguise\" as Socialism was Communism \"in disguise.\" My theory ga ins added weight when we learn that Shaw attended the Socialist Internati onal in London in 1864, as a Fabian delegate. As we know, Marx was the creator o f the Socialist Internationals at which his flawed theories were preached ad-infin itum alongside outright Communist propaganda. Karl Marx never tried to hide the unholy alliance between the Communist International and his own Soc ialist International, but Shaw and the Webbs, and later, Harold Laski, veheme ntly denied any connection with Marxism or Communism. Endless hours were spent by the Fabians splitting h airs whether it was \"Social Democracy\" or \"Democratic Socialism\" which was to be the battle cry. In the end it was \"Democratic Socialism\" that was t o be used in the United States with such stunning success, Shaw's idea that Social ist intellectuals (in which cat- egory he included himself) would lead the charge at election time, while labor would provide the money. This was successfully co-o pted by ADA, who flooded Congressional committees with \"experts\" shuttled to and from Harvard, to con- found and confuse Senators and Representatives, uns chooled and inexperienced in the ways of Socialist treachery and treason."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"8 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship Socialism IS NOT ABOUT EQUALITY AND FREEDOM. Nor is it about helping the middle class and working people. On the contrary, it is about enslave- ment of the people by gradual, subtle means, a fact that Shaw once admitted to in an unguarded moment. Graham Wallas' book \"Great Soc iety\" and Lyndon Banes Johnson's \"Great Society\" were the same thing, and on the surface, looked as if the people would be the beneficiaries of government largess, but in truth, it was merely an enslavement trap baited with Socialist ho ney. AS LONG AS SOCIAL- ISM IS ALIVE, COMMUNISM CANNOT BE DEAD, AND THAT IS WHERE SOCIALISM IS LEADING THIS NATION — INTO THE STEEL T RAP OF COMMUNISM. We need to remind ourselves what the great Presiden t Andrew Jackson said about the hidden enemy in our midst: \"Sooner or lat er your enemy will show him- self, and you will know what to do....you will be c onfronted by many unseen ene- mies of your hard-fought liberty. But they will sho w themselves in time — time enough to destroy them.\" Let us hope that the Ameri can people, blinded by false Socialists policies of four presidents, will have t he scales removed from their eyes before it is too late. A second Marxist in disguise was Sydney Webb, so di sdainfully dismissed by Sir Bertrand Russell in later years as a \"clerk in the Colonial Office.\" Webb was angry in his denials that he had ever met Marx, but as it was with Shaw, there is circumstantial evidence that Webb did indeed mee t with Marx quite regularly. Unlike Shaw who married late, Webb married Beatrice Potter quite early on, a wealthy, formidable women who was to advance his ca reer more than he ever cared to admit. Beatrice was the daughter of a Canadian railroad ma gnate, who had fallen in love with Joseph Chamberlain, but rejected by him d ue to class difference. In those days, having money didn't mean automatic admi ssion to the best circles. One had to come from the \"right\" background, which usually meant a public school education (A \"public school\" in England is t he same as a private school in America). From their very first meeting Shaw and th e Webbs were on the same wavelength, and became an excellent team act. The Socialist revolution proposed by the Fabian Soc iety was to cast a long, dark shadow across England and later the United Sta tes. Its aims differed little from those set out in the Communist manifesto of 1848: \" It therefore aims at the reorga- nization of society by the emancipation of land and Industrial capital from individ- ual and Class ownership and vesting them in the com munity for general benefit. It accordingly works for the extinction of private pro perty in land... It seeks to achieve these ends by general dissemination of know ledge as to the relations between the individual and Society in its economic, ethical and political aspects.\" There was no denouncement of religion, no long-hair ed anarchists running around with bombs. Nothing like that. Fascists, wer e also welcome, witness the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"How Fabian Socialism Began and Subsequent History 9 fact that Sir Oswald Mosely and his wife, nee Cynth ia Curzon, were both firmly committed Socialists before they were called to Fas cism. Shaw, the \"old guard\" Socialist had high praise of Hitler in the years le ading up to WWII. Instead of showing its true colors, Fabianism put on genteel a irs and graces that belied its dangerous revolutionary intent: the unwritten const itution of England and the written Constitution of the United States were to b e subverted and replaced by a system of State-run Socialism, through a process th at was known as \"gradualism\" and \"penetration and permeation.\" There are some similarities here between Hitler and the Fabianists: in the beginning, nobody took the slightest notice of them . But unlike Hitler, for Shaw and Webb, the vision was one where the world would evolve into a New World Order in which everyone would be happy and contente d, this having been brought about without resort to violence and anarchy. The Fabians began to spread their wings and by 1891 were ready to publish their first \"Fabian News.\" It was during this perio d that Beatrice Webb began teaching radical feminism and developed the Fabian Research program, later used with great success by Justice Louis Brandeis and kn own as the \"Brandeis Brief.\" This consisted of volume after volume of \"research\" material, enough to swamp opponents, covered with the thinnest of legal brief s. Not much encouragement was given to nondescript unimportant new members: W ebb and Shaw felt their movement was one for the elite — they were not inte rested in mass movements of people without money and influence. For this reason they turned their attention to Oxfo rd and Cambridge Universifies, where the sons of the elite were educ ated and who were later to take the Fabian message (suitably disguised as \"reforms\" ) into the heart and soul of the Parliament. The Fabian Society's goal was to ge t Socialists installed in posi- tions of power, where their influence could be coun ted on to bring about \"reforms.\" This program, somewhat modified, was practiced in t he United States also, and produced Roosevelt, Kennedy, Johnson and Clinto n — Socialists all. Such agents of change were trained in the Fabian way of combining sociology with pol- itics to open doors. Mere numbers was never its sty le. One of their elite, Arthur Henderson, who was Britain's Foreign Minister in 19 29, was the guiding, leading light in getting diplomatic recognition for the mon strous Bolshevik regime, with the United States following suit a few years later. The first Fabian Society cell in Oxford opened in 1 895, and by 1912 there were three more, with students forming more than 20 percent of the membership. This was perhaps the most profound period for the F abian Society's growth; stu- dents being inducted into Socialism, many of whom w ent on to be world leaders. The little movement that nobody paid any attention to in 1891, had arrived.

Laski, Galbraith, Attlee, Beaverbrook, Sir Bertrand Russell, H.G. Wells, Wallass, Chase and Wallace; these were some of the Fabian So cialists who were to have a profound effect in shaping the course the United St ates was to take. This was particularly true of Professor Laski. Few in the government of the thirty years that Laski spent in America, ever beca me aware of the depth of his penetration into education and the very government itself. This was a man who put the tenets of Socialism into daily practice. La ski lectured in many of the States and at the Universities of Oregon, California, Colo rado, Columbia University, Yale, Harvard and Roosevelt University, in Chicago. During all of this time, he constantly urged the adoption of a Federal program of \"social insurance\" which he omitted to say, would lead to the Socialist goal of a TOTAL welfare state. In later years, Laski, Wallas, Keynes, and many of the Fabian Society polit- ical leaders and economists would go to the Tavisto ck Institute of Human Relations to learn the methods of John Rawlings Ree se, which became known as \"inner conditioning\" and \"long range penetration.\" It was to this school that Henry Kissinger was also sent. Gradually, as was their custom, Fabianists began to penetrate both the Labor and Liberal Parties, from where they exerted great influence in the socializing of the Englishman, formerly sturdily independent and n ot known to accept govern- ment aid. While the Webbs claimed credit for the \"p enetration\" technique, the claim was rudely upset in 1952 by Colonel I.M. Bogo lepov, who said that the entire plan was written for the Webbs in the Soviet Foreign Office, as had much of the material in the many books the Webbs claimed to have written. Bogolepov went on to say that much of the material in Webb's books he had personally writ- ten. \"They changed it just a bit here and there, ot herwise it was a copied verba- tim,\" the colonel said. As is so often the case when leftist or socialist h eroes are debunked, the press covers up and praises the exposed one with masses o f irrelevant verbiage until the charge is all but forgotten. We see this almost dai ly in the press with regard to the moral character and political ineptitude of Preside nt Clinton. \"He is theirs, and no matter what is said of him, they will not let the m ud stick,\" an intelligence col- league of mine said. And wash Clinton they do. In a nalyzing reports of Clinton's questionable morality and political mistakes, one c annot help but be impressed by the Fabian Socialist damage control: \"wash\" the tar get and smother the attacker in verbiage that has little relevancy to the issues . In studying the history of the Fabian Society in th e British Museum in London, I was struck by the awesome progress of the tiny band of unknowns who went on to bring some of the most important politic ians, writers, teachers, econ- omists, scientists, philosophers, religious leaders and publishers into the Fabian Society's orbit, while the world seemed never to no tice its existence. Why the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"How Fabian Socialism Began and Subsequent History 11 profound changes that were coming into being were n ot cause for alarm can be explained. Every single move made by Fabianists was cloaked in the mantle of \"reforms\" and the Fabian technique of equating \"ref orms\" with \"beneficial,\" \"just,\" or \"good\" was the key to their success. The same things held good for American Socialists. Every major move made by the Socialist Fifth Column in Washington is disg uised as \"reforms,\" that are going to benefit the people. The trick is as old as the hills, yet voters fall for it every time. Roosevelt's \"New Deal\" was lifted strai ght out of a Fabian Socialist book of the same title written by Stuart Chase, yet , seemingly, it was accepted as a genuine \"reform\" of the system. Even Woodrow Wils on's recognition of the treasonous Kerensky government, was clothed in lang uage crafted to intentional- ly deceive the American people that \"reforms\" going on in Russia were for the benefit of the common people. Johnson's \"Great Soci ety\" was another \"American\" program lifted straight out of a book wr itten by Graham Wallas, called 'The Great Society.\" With the London School of (Socialist) Economics est ablished, although nowhere near as pretentious in the beginning as the title sounded, Fabian Socialists became increasingly influential in shapi ng monetary policies on both sides of the Atlantic. The facility was vastly upgr aded when the Rockefeller foun- dation gave it a substantial grant. The method of f unding Socialist institutions through grants by the wealthy elite, and its day-to -day programs for the poor, is believed to be the idea of Shaw, which he activated after he attended a lecture at the London School of Economics. Basically, making the poor pay for \"local\" programs came down to starting trade unions among the working class, and then usin g member's dues to facilitate and fund Socialist programs. It is rather like the Freemasons, who are prone to let us know that they contribute generous amounts of mo ney to charities. But the money usually comes from the public, not from Mason coffers. In the United States the Shriners are famous for donating money t o hospitals, but the money comes from the public by street parades the Shriner s hold. None of their OWN money goes to hospitals. The \"Four Pillars of the House of Socialism,\" writt en by Sydney Webb short- ly after WW I, became the blueprint for future Soci alist action, not only in Britain, but also in the United States. The plan called for the destruction of the system of production of goods and services based on competiti on, unlimited taxation, mas- sive state welfare, no private property rights and a One World Government. These objectives did not differ all that much from the pr inciples laid down by Karl Marx in the Communist Manifesto of 1848. The differences lay in method of applica- tion, style, rather than in substance. In detail, state-financed welfare was to be the fir st principle. The right of women to vote was included (the birth of women's ri ghts movements), all land to"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"12 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship be nationalized, with no private property rights. A ll industries \"serving the peo- ple\" (rail, power, light, phone, etc.) to be nation alized, \"private profit\" to be elim- inated from the insurance industry, confiscation of wealth via taxation to be stepped up and finally, the concept of a One World Government was spelled out: International economic controls, international cour ts providing international leg- islation governing social affairs. A cursory examination of the Communist Manifesto of 1848 reveals where the \"research\" for the \"Four Pillars\" was done. Whi le \"Four Pillars\" dealt quite exclusively with socializing Britain, many of its i deas were put into practice by Wilson, Roosevelt, Johnson, Carter, and now, Clinto n. \"Labour and the New Social Order\" had made the big time in the United S tates, where its thoroughly revolutionary aims went unrecognized, even as Hitle r was being held up as the greatest threat to the world. Whether we like it or not, the policies and programs instituted by Wilson, Roosevelt, Kennedy, Johnson, Carter and Reagan all bore the stamp, \"Made in England By the Fabian Society.\" This is truer with Clinton than with any of the former presidents. Ramsay McDonald, sent to the United States to \"spy out the land\" went on to become Britain's first Fabian Society Socialist prime minister. McDonald set the pattern for future prime ministers to surround themselves with Fabian Socialist advisors, a tradition carried on by Marga ret Thatcher and John Major. Across the Atlantic, Fabian Socialists surrounded P resident Wilson and presented a program to socialize the United States. It was an altogether spectacular achieve- ment for those few men under the leadership of Peas e, who set out to change the world at the turn of the century, and did so by mak ing full use of \"presidential advisors.\" One of the rising stars in the Fabian Society's inn er circle was Sir Stafford Cripps, a nephew of Beatrice Webb. Sir Stafford pla yed a major role in advising American Socialists on how to get the United States to join in WWII. In 1929, Cripps had been a guiding light for the upper-crust entre into Fabianism, this, in spite of the fact that Fabianism and Communism had become blurred along the edges, and several leading conservatives of the day warned that there was little to choose between Fabian Socialism and Communism, othe r than the lack of mem- bership cards for Fabian Socialists. The year 1929 also saw the rise of another star who was destined to shake the economic and financial policies of many nations, in cluding his own England, but perhaps more importantly, those of the United State s. John Maynard Keynes had become a virtual Fabian Society icon thanks to men like Gollancz, with his giant left publishing house and Left Book Club, and Harold Jos eph Laski. (1893-1950) Rare Fabian Society papers I saw in the British Mus eum were of the opinion that without the blessing of Laski, Keynes would no t have amounted to much. Laski was once described in these papers as \"everyb ody's idea of a Socialist.\""},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"How Fabian Socialism Began and Subsequent History 13 Even the great H.G. Wells bowed the knee to Laski, calling him, \"the greatest Socialist intellectual in the English-speaking worl d.\" Laski came from Jewish parents in moderate circumst ances and it is said the rise of Hitler was what turned him to a militant for Jew ish rights in Palestine. Clashes with Earnest Bevin, Socialist prime minister of Bri tain were frequent and furious. On May Day, 1945, Laski, as chairman of the British La bor Party, made a speech in which he reiterated that he did not believe in the Jewish religion, because he was a Marxist. But now, Laski said, he believed the rebir th of the Jewish nation in Palestine was vitally necessary. This was confirmed by Ben Gu rion himself. Laski's opinion was conveyed to President Truman an d Rabbi Stephen Wise on April 20,1945. Truman had inherited Roosevelt's hardline stand in favor of Jewish aspirations, as dictated by Laski, and when trouble began brewing over the question of Jewish settlers being allowed into Pale stine, Truman sent a copy of what many believed was a Fabian-Socialist report on the status of refugee camps in Europe, urging then Foreign Secretary Bevin to l et 100,000 Jews emigrate from these camps and settle in Palestine. Truman's message caused Bevin to take deep umbrage with both Laski and Truman. Bevin's image of Jews was neither pro nor a nti. His views were decid- edly tempered by those of Clement Attlee, then Prim e Minister of England. As Bevin saw it, the Jews were not a nation, while on the other hand, the Arabs were. The Jews don't need a state of their own,\" Bevin sa id. He told Laski that he would not pay the slightest attention to Truman's s uggestion, putting it down to, \"pressure from the New York Jewish vote.\" Bevin's r efusal to see it (Laski's and Truman's way) resulted in endless squabbling. Bevin adhered to his policy based on his belief tha t \"the Arabs were essen- tially indigenous to the region and pro-British, wh ile a Zionist state meant an intrusion of an alien, disruptive element, which wo uld weaken the region and open the doors to Communism.\" Even when Weitzman we nt to meet with him, Bevin refused to offer more than a monthly quota of fifteen hundred Jews who could go to Palestine. From this had to be deducted the number of illegal Jewish immigrants who entered Palestine each of the months . This was one of the very few occasions that Fabian Socialism and Laski suffe red a severe defeat. Ayn Rand is said to have used Laski as her model fo r her 1943 novel, \"The Fountainhead,\" and Saul Bellow wrote, \"I shall neve r forget Mosby's observa- tions on Harold Laski: on packing the Supreme Court , on the Russian Purge tri- als, and on Hitler. \"Laski's influence is still fel t in the United States, forty-four years after his death. His association with Rooseve lt, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr, Louis Brandeis, Felix Frankfurter, Edward R. Murrow, Max Lerner, Averill Harriman, and David Rockefeller was to pro- foundly change the course and direction on which th e Founding Fathers had set this nation."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"14 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship Laski taught as a Professor of Political Science at the London School of Economics and was chairman of the British Labor Par ty when Aneuran Bevan was Prime Minister. Laski was like George Bernard S haw; he would not hesitate to walk up and introduce himself to anyone he wante d to meet. He cultivated friendship with the most important people in the fu rtherance of Socialist causes. His personality was described by close associate Ri chard Crossman as, \"warm and gregarious, a man who made it to the top on his own, a public intellectual.\" It is said of Laski that he was generous and kind a nd that people liked to be with him, all the while the indefatigable Socialist crus ader. A notable milestone of progress for Fabian Socialis m came in the 1940s with the Beveridge Report on a series of essays simply e ntitled, \"Social Security.\" The year 1942 was chosen precisely for psychological re asons. Britain was facing its darkest days of WWII. Now was the time for Socialis m to offer hope. Laski offered the scheme to John G. Winant, United States ambassador to the Court of St. James. Mrs Eugene Meyer of the Washington Post described the attention of Roosevelt. In Britain, Fabian Society notables like Lord Pakenham made hun- dreds of high-profile speeches in favor of the mira cle of abolishing want and deprivation. The British public was ecstatic. But five years later found the British government \" borrowing\" heavily from the United States to make social security work. Joh n Strachey, so idolized by the Fabian Socialists, discovered that no matter how mu ch he regulated the amount of social security, increasing it when needed, it w as still not enough to generate purchasing power, so Strachey, the No. 1 Marxist an d Minister of Food Supply, had to ration supplies. The Socialists had almost b ankrupted the country, in one year, 1947, spending $2.75 billion on their Sociali st programs, the money \"bor- rowed\" from the United States! The \"loans\" were the work of Laski, and Harry Dexter White of the United States Treasury, and a S oviet informant. It is truly amazing that the American people stood silent in the face of the kind of financing of Socialist pipe dreams that the y were expected to carry. The only reason which comes to mind as to why the Ameri can people did not protest is, quite simply, that the truth was hidden from th em. The Federal Reserve \"lent\" Britain $3 billion dollars in the 1920s so that the \"dole\" (welfare) system could continue, while at home, war veteran's pensions wer e cut by $4,000,000 a year as a partial contribution. Could such a thing ever hap pen again? Informed opinion is that not only can it happen again, but that the rea ction from the American people would be the same; for the most part, one of total indifference. But even with the unstinting, albeit unofficial hel p of Harry Dexter White, Socialism could not on its own fund its grandiose s chemes and when the Congress finally discovered the full extent of White's finan cial help for Socialist Britain, Sir Stafford Cripps had to come right out with it and t ell the British people that hence- forth, social security would have to be funded thro ugh taxing their incomes. In the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"How Fabian Socialism Began and Subsequent History 15 period 1947-1949, taxes mounted, food became scarce , incomes dwindled, and although one Fabian brain trust after another worke d tirelessly to come up with a solution that would make Socialism work — other tha n borrowing money from the United States — they always came back to the sa me thing: deficit spending or scrap Fabian Socialist programs as unworkable. Britain was reduced from a profitable Tenderer of g oods and services and bro- kerage agents for other nations, to a beggar nation . In short, Socialist programs were responsible for the destruction of its centuries ol d, thriving economy. Britain began to resemble a banana republic. Grabbing at straws, the Labour Party (its leadership Fabian Socialists almost to a man) thought it could make things work by more nationalizing and more rationing, but the electorat e did not give the Fabian Society the chance, turning Labour out of office in general elections in 1950. The Fabian Society's legacy? An empty treasury, gol d reserves gone, pro- duction down to an all time low, it sought to dista nce itself from the discredited Labor Party on the grounds that \"the Fabian Society is not a political party.\" Speaking in the House of Commons, a notable Sociali st, Albert Edwards said: \"I have spent years discoursing on the defects of t he capitalist system. I do not with- draw those criticisms. But we have seen the two sys tems side by side. And the man who would still argue for Socialism as the means of ridding our country of the defects of capitalism is blind indeed. Socialism ju st does not work.\" Yet, in spite of the total and abject failure of So cialism in practice as opposed to theory, there were still those in the United Sta tes who were determined to thrust failed Socialist policies down the throats of the A merican people. Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Bush and Carter se emed determined to ignore the Great Socialist Debacle on the other side of th e Atlantic, and, urged on by their Socialist advisors, plunged ahead with American ver sions of the same old failed Fabian Socialist theories and policies. Still tied to Britain through a common language and a common heritage, the Socialists were able to enmesh the United States in their dream of a One World Government through the so-called Atlantic Alliance or Atlantic Union. Ignoring the wisdom of President George Washington's Farewel l Address, successive American governments went ahead with what was essen tially a Fabian Socialist scheme for a world government in which Americans fo r Democratic Action (ADA) played no small part. Also much to the fore i n this strictly Socialist enter- prise was the Royal Institute for International Aff airs (RUA) headquartered at Chatham House, St. James Square, London, the \"mothe r\" of the American Council of Foreign Relations (CFR). The \"Socialist Hands Across The Sea\" drive was bols tered by the presence of Owen Lattimore, at Leeds University. Lattimore, a Johns Hopkins professor, is best remembered for his treasonous conduct while in charge of the Institute for Pacific Relations (IPR), which is blamed for the in stigation of United States trade"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"16 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship policies toward Japan. That spurred the attack on P earl Harbor and got the United States into WWII, at a time when the German Army ha d thoroughly trounced the so-called \"allies\" who were staring defeat in the f ace in Europe. The rise of Harold Wilson as the future prime minis ter of England could be laid at the door of the Kennedy administration, which ha ving dispatched Harold MacMillan \"with one Skybolt\" as one commentator put it, the Kennedy administra- tion exuded kindness and know how toward the \"Oxfor d Socialist in grey flannels,\" as Wilson was described. Wilson went to America to find a way of sloganeering him- self into office, and he found it among the Madison Avenue advertising agents. Strange, that Socialism had to turn to capitalism t o find out how things are done! Yet, no sooner was Wilson installed as prime minist er than he told the House of Commons that his policies would be socialism as usual: nationalizing of indus- tries, \"social justice\" and of course tax REFORM, a bigger bite out of the incomes of corporations, payroll levies and the whole Socia list nine yards. An excited Wilson told his Fabian Socialist colleagues that th ey could be sure of success, because \"we have an American government in sympathy .\" What Wilson really meant was that the American gove rnment appeared more willing than ever to pay the bills for extravagant Socialist spending by his Labour government. Again, we emphasize in contribute towar d \"world socialism.\" Prime Minister Wilson, making good use of his Ameri can connections, bor- rowed four billion dollars from the International M onetary Fund, (the largest fun- der of which was, and remains, the United States.) Once again it was demon- strated that Socialist programs could not support t heir own weight, and like the dinosaur, would collapse if not propped up. The IMF was established by Lord Keynes, who described it as \"essentially a Socialis t conception.\" But some voices were being raised in the United Sta tes against the alarming Socialist penetration of government that had begun with Wilson, accelerated with Roosevelt, and grown larger and bolder and more out spoken in the Kennedy administration. One of those was Senator Joseph McC arthy from Wisconsin. A true patriot, McCarthy was determined to root out t he Socialists and Communist agents of change with which the United States State Department had become infested, a battle that McCarthy began in 1948 with the Truman administration, and continued with the Eisenhower administration. The Fabian Society became thoroughly alarmed. How w as it to defend its penetration of the United States government and its institutions against public exposure? For help, Fabians turned to Americans for Democratic Action, who set about mounting a massive campaign of vilification a gainst the senator from Wisconsin. Without this force to reckon with, there is no doubt that McCarthy would have achieved his goal of exposing just how f ar the American government and its institutions had been taken over by Fabian Socialism, which McCarthy mistakenly identified as \"Communism.\""},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"How Fabian Socialism Began and Subsequent History 17 The ADA spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in e fforts to curb McCarthy, even going so far as to distribute thousands of cop ies of the Senator's personal finances, in violation of Senate rules, which were disclosed to the Senate Subcommittee. The Socialist publication \"New States man\" suddenly became concerned with the Constitution and the Bill of Rig hts — suggesting that the McCarthy hearings were imperiling these \"sacred rig hts.\" The ADA — sponsored resolution condemning McCarthy was proof positive t hat then, as now, the Democrat Party was in the hands of international So cialists of the Fabian Society variety. ADA was not at all shy about claiming cred it for having \"stopped McCarthy.\" With the downfall of Senator McCarthy, the Fabian S ociety breathed a col- lective sigh of relief: this was about as close to exposure it had come. The one man who could have foiled the ADA attack failed to show up at the Senate hear- ing. Senator John F. Kennedy, a professed admirer o f the senator from Wisconsin was reputedly confined to a hospital bed when the v ote came up. It has not been explained why he failed to pair his vote. Kennedy a ctually owed his rise to power to McCarthy, who refused to campaign for Henry Cabo t Lodge, when Lodge was running against Kennedy in Massachusetts. That fact, not well known, bodes ill for the indepe ndence of the United States and the Republic for which its stands. In the futur e, unless Socialism is radically checked, and then uprooted, the Pledge of Allegianc e might well go something like this: \"I pledge allegiance to the flag of United States a nd to the Socialist Government for which its stands...\" Let us not think this far-fetched. We should recall the small band of unim- portant young men who started their movement in Lon don, a movement that spread its dangerous poison across the entire world , were also considered \"far- fetched\" in their day. The Fabian Society was now r einvigorated. With the McCarthy threat disposed of, and a new, young, pres ident in the White House, one educated by Harold Laski at the London School o f Economics and influenced by John Kenneth Galbraith, the Socialists looked se t fair to make a quantum leap into the very sinew and muscle of the United States Government. After all, was- n't Kennedy's \"New Frontier\" actually a book writte n by the great Socialist Henry Wallace? Wallace had not flinched in putting Socialism's goa ls firmly in view: \"Socially disciplined men will work cooperatively t o increase the wealth of the human race and apply their inventive skills to changing society itself. They will modify (reform) governmental and political mac hinery as well as the momentary and price system, to achieve far wider po ssibility of social justice and social charity (welfare) in the world...men may rig htfully feel that they are serv- ing a function as high as any minister of the Gospe l. They will not be"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"18 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship Communists, Socialists or Fascist, but plain men tr ying to gain by democratic methods the professed objectives of Communists, Soc ialists or Fascists...\" That the Kennedy administration originally embarked on a program that looked even more radical than that of the Roosevelt era, is not disputed. Even the fact that the ADA selected his cabinet and advisers almost to a man is well known. In Britain, the Fabian Socialists wore broad smiles : their time, it seemed had arrived. But their happiness began to be tempered w ith reservation as news from the United States had it that Kennedy was not livin g up to their Socialist expec- tations. The ADA's mouthpiece, \"New Republic\" said in an edi torial published June 1, 1963: \"In general the Kennedy performance is les s impressive than the Kennedy style.\" Laski's vision of \"a new Jerusalem\" in the English-speaking world and the building of a new, Socialist society, seemed to have been put on hold — at least for a while. Laski had known how to manage Labour Party lead- ers Attlee, Dalton, McDonald, the Kennedy brothers, the question was, would his successors be able to handle the \"American side\" as well as he had done? The rise of Fabianism in the United States could be traced back to the Fellowship of New Life and later, to the Boston Bel lamy Club, which came into being after the visit of Sydney Webb and R.R. Pease , historian of the Fabian Society — one of the original four Fabians, to visi t the United States in 1883. The Bellamy Club was brought into being by General Arth ur F. Devereux and Captain Charles E. Bowers, backed by newspapermen Cyrus Fie ld, Willard and Frances E. Willard. The club did not have its intention the advance of Socialism. Devereux's main concern was the huge influx of untr ained immigrants into the United States, which he said, was not ready to rece ive them. General Devereux felt that the situation should be nipped in the bud before it got completely out of hand. (He could not have f oreseen the horrendous, delib- erately contrived immigration situation that develo ped in the United States in 1990—thanks to Socialist policies.) As Devereux and his friends were getting ready to found the Boston Bellamy Club, Webb arrive d from England in September of 1888 and was put in touch with the clu b's founders. Sensing an opportunity, Webb and Pease were able to include in the club's principles the nationalization of private industry, with the name to be changed to the Boston Nationalist Club. The opening meeting was attended by Webb and Edward Bellamy. On December 15, 1888, the seed of Fabian S ocialism in the United States that was to sprout and grow into a huge tree , was planted. Advancing into the arts, in 1910, Shaw's plays were being put on by the Theater Guild in New York City by Professor Kenneth MacGowan of the Harvard Socialist Club, using methods learned from the Mosc ow Arts Theater. The League of Industrial Democracy, Americans for Democratic A ction was still far in the future, but the foundations for their organizations had already been laid."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"How Fabian Socialism Began and Subsequent History 19 Shaw and H.G. Wells were puffed by literary agents all over America, par- ticularly in college towns, and socialist magazines , \"The New Republic\" and \"The Nation\" and \"The Socialism Of Our Times,\" edit ed by Norman Thomas and Henry Laidler, were taking off. A frequent contributor to the \"New Republic,\" Laski taught at Harvard all through WWI. His unkind critics say thus he was to avoid any possibility of hav- ing to serve in some capacity or another in the Bri tish war effort. It was from the \"New Republic\" that Woodrow Wilson received support , not only for getting the United States into that conflagration, but right th roughout its disastrous course. If ever there was a \"Socialist War,\" this was it. \"New Republic\" did not have the same concerns for the terrible slaughter going on i n Russia under the guise of Bolshevising Russia. Laski was an enthusiastic admirer of Felix Frankfur ter and some of his let- ters in praise of Frankfurter revealed the extent o f the penetration of Fabian Socialism into the United States justice system. Wh ile on one of his many visits in the United States, Laski urged the ADA and other American Socialists to take active measures in getting higher taxation laws pas sed: newer, higher taxes on unearned high incomes was the way to get taxation e quitably distributed, Laski said. He also kept in constant touch with his frien d Judge Felix Frankfurter, urg- ing him to press for \"reforms\" of the United States Constitution, particularly the constitutional separation of powers between the exe cutive, legislative and judicial branches. Laski was constantly at the side of Frankfurter and constantly attacking the United States Constitution, derisively referring to it as, \"Capitalism's strongest safeguard, a class document.\" Laski called Roosevel t, \"the sole bulwark against the Fascist form of Capitalism.\" That Laski was not charged with sedition for try- ing to overthrow the United States Constitution was a big mistake. A frequent vis- itor to the Roosevelt White House, he was also very secretive about it, such vis- its never mentioned in the press. Meetings were always arranged through Felix Frankfu rter. During one visit, Laski is alleged by his biographer to have told Roo sevelt, \"Either Capitalism or Democracy must prevail\" and urged the president to \"save democracy.\" By \"democracy\" Laski obviously meant SOCIALISM, the So cialists having long ago adopted \"democracy\" as the standard bearer of Socia lism. During WWII, Laski frequently urged Roosevelt to make the world safe b y laying a foundation for postwar Socialism. The Socialist education Roosevel t received from Laski is said to have almost equaled that received by John F. Ken nedy while Laski's pupil at the London School of Economics. There were some who were aware of what was going on . Congressman Tinkham introduced into the Congressional Record, H ouse, January 14, 1941, a letter written by Amos Pinchot. The Pinchot letter stated: \"Many young Socialists"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"20 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship declare that what is generally called the Roosevelt Program is in reality the Laski program, imposed on New Deal thinkers and finally o n the President, by the London Professor of Economics and his friends.\" The only thing wrong with that bold statement is that Laski was a professor of pol itical science, not economics. Otherwise, the observation was right on target! Laski carried on lengthy correspondence with Frankf urter, urging him to be vigilant and push the \"political psychology\" of Fab ian Socialism. There can be no doubt whatsoever that Laski's advice to Frankfurter served as the basis for sweep- ing changes made by the Supreme Court, changes that completely altered the course and the character of the United States. If e ver it could be said that the \"New Deal\" had a father, that father was not Roosev elt, but the Fabian Society's Professor Harold Laski. Even to this day, so few Americans are aware of the vast influence Fabian Society Professor Laski had on Roosevelt. Six month s after Pearl Harbor got the United States into WWII as planned, Eleanor Rooseve lt invited Laski to be the keynote speaker at the International Students Congr ess that was set to take place in September of 1942, the one that Churchill refuse d to let Laski attend. Congressman Woodruff of Michigan put it very succin ctly, when he denounced Laski as having \"a key to the back door o f the White House.\" Had patriots been able to access the private letters be tween Laski, Frankfurter and Roosevelt, they might have aroused enough righteous indignation to get Laski expelled from the country, a fate he richly deserve d. Graham Wallas was another leading Socialist whose i nfluence over Frankfurter and Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes is sa id to have turned American jurisprudence upside down. It is said that through William Wisemen, head of MI6 North American Desk, Laski got Frankfurter appointe d to one of the very first purely Socialist-oriented panels: The Mediation Com mission On Industrial Unrest. In Britain, Fabianism penetrated every comer, every nook and cranny of the civil and military scene. No facet of society was i mmune to its penetration, which is the path it was to follow in its invasion of the United States. Truly, Socialism is a more deadly enemy than was ever faced by Georg e Washington and his troops during the American War of Independence. This ongoi ng war never ceases, day or night, the battle for the hearts, minds, and the souls of the American nation goes forward. One of the bulwarks against Socialism penetration i s the Christian religion. Clemment Atlee, a leading Fabianist who went on to become prime minister of England put the successes of the Fabian Socialists down to its penetration of labor. But Irish Catholic labor was never penetrate d by Webb, Shaw, or any of the other leading lights of the Fabian Society.

These highly revealing comments, and other which we shall quote as we pro- ceed, put Socialism in its proper perspective. Most modern day Americans have only a vague idea of what Socialism is about, viewi ng it as a semi-benign move- ment whose goals are a general improvement of the l iving standards of the ordi- nary people. Nothing could be further from the trut h. Socialism has one place to go, and that is Communism. We have been besieged by the media, led to believe that Communism is dead, but some thinking will conv ince us otherwise. The Fabian Socialists closely followed the Communis t Manifesto of 1848, but in a more genteel, less abrasive manner. Their aims however, were the same: A world revolution which would end in a One World G overnment — New World Order in which capitalism would be replaced by Soci alism in a welfare state, in which every individual would be beholden to a dicta torial Socialist hierarchy for everything in life.

Outwardly, this would in theory be of great benefit to the ordinary people, but an examination of the Socialist experim ents in England, reveals the system as a complete, unworkable failure. As we sho w elsewhere, Great Britain of 1994 has totally collapsed because of the Social ists and their welfare state. The Fabian Socialists set out to achieve their goal s in England and the United States by placing intellectuals in key positions fr om where they were able to exert undue influence in changing the direction of both c ountries. In the United States, the two prime agents in this regard undoubtedly wer e Professor Harold Laski and John Kenneth Galbraith. In the background, one of t he \"old guard\" of British Fabianism, Graham Wallas, was director of propagand a. Together, they wrote the \"Basis of The Fabian Society of Socialists.\" 'The Fabian Society therefore aims at the reorganiz ation of society by the emancipation of land and Industrial Capital from in dividual and class ownership, and vesting of them in the community for the genera l benefit...The Society accordingly works for the extinction of private pro perty in land.. .The Society fur- ther works for the transfer to the Community of suc h Industrial capital as can be conveniently handled by Society. For the attainment of these ends the Fabian Society looks to the spread of Socialist opinions, and the social and political changes consequent thereon...It seeks to achieve th ese ends by the general dis- semination of knowledge as to the relation between the individual and the Society in its economic, ethical and political aspects.\" In 1938, the aims and objects of the Society were s omewhat altered: 'The Fabian Society of Socialists.\" \"It is therefore the aims at the establishment of a society in which the eco- nomic power of individuals and classes shall be abo lished through the collective ownership and democratic control of the economic re sources of the community. It seeks to secure these ends by the methods of pol itical democracy. The Fabian Society shall be affiliated with the Labour Party. Its activities shall be in further- ance of Socialism and the education of the public a long Socialist lines by the holding of meetings, lectures, discussion groups, c onferences and summer schools; the promotion of research into political, economic and social problems and periodicals; and by any other appropriate means .\" One is at once struck by the number of times \"commu nity\" appears, along- side the playing down of individual rights. In this , it appears that Fabian Socialism set its face against Christianity from th e earliest gatherings of the orig- inal few in London. The determination to nationaliz e industrial projects that served the public was very evident and bore a strik ing resemblance to what the Communist Manifesto of 1848 said on the subject. It was also evident that the purpose of Fabian Socialism was to establish a Nati onal Cooperative Common wealth Society, in which everyone would have the sa me rights to the economic wealth of the nation."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"What Socialism Is: Why it Leads to Slavery 25 The Boston Bellamy Club, which opened in 1888, succ eeded the Fellowship of New Life with its Theosophical learnings and bec ame the first Fabian Socialist enterprise in the United States.

We merely seek to push the principle a little further and have industries oper ated in the interests of the nation—the people organized, the organic unity of t he whole people.\" The prose was the work of Sydney Webb, and Edward P ease, Fabian Society historian, who traveled to the United States in the 1880s to set in motion American Fabian Socialism. The mildness of the tone and the choice of words belies its iron-hard inner core of revolutionary ai ms. The use of the word \"reforms\" was intended to disarm critics as were Fa bian publications like \"The Fabian News\" which advocated \"reforms\" that would p rove particularly injurious to the United States Constitution. It paved the way for the ongoing revolution that is changing the United States from a Confederated R epublic into a Socialist Welfare State. (It was George Washington who descri bed the United States as a Confederated Republic). In the \"American Fabian\" of 1895, (unlike the disgu ised Socialists who infest the United States House and Senate and the J udiciary and who act as advis- ers to the President) the Fabian Socialist aims for America were rather plainly sta ted: \"We call our paper, 'The American Fabian' for two r easons; we call it 'Fabian' because we desire to make it stand for the kind of educational Socialist work which is so ably done by the English Fabian So ciety...We call our paper, 'The American Fabian' because our policies must in a measure differ from those of the English Fabians. England and America are ali ke in some things; in some things they are utterly unlike. England's constitut ion readily admits to constant though gradual modification. Our American Constitut ion does not readily admit to such change. England can thus move into Socialis m almost imperceptibly. Our Constitution being largely individualist must be ch anged to admit Socialism and each change necessitates a political crisis.\" Thus from the very beginning it was clear that the main challenge to intro- ducing Socialism to the United States was the Const itution and that from that day"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"26 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship onwards, it became the target of Socialist attacks on the institutions that make up the Confederated Republic of the United States of A merica. As we shall see, to this end, callous, hardened Socialists like Walt Wh itman Rostow were employed to undermine the very foundation of the nation. As trained observers were quick to recognize, Fabian Socialism was not just a nice, friendly debating society run by professors and educated ladies, who talked with polished accents and project- ed an air of sweet reason ableness. Fabian Socialism developed the art of dissembling a nd lying without seeming to lie. Many were deceived in England, and later, i n the United States, where we are still being deceived on a grand scale. But there we re occasions when Socialist lead- ers could not contain themselves, such as the occas ion of the 1936 Eastern Spring Conference of Professional Schools for Teachers. Ro ger Baldwin explained the dou- ble meaning of words so often used by Fabian Social ists: \"progressive\" meant '\"the forces working for the democraticizing of industry by extending public ownership and control,\" while \"democracy\" meant \"strong trade unions, government regulation of business, ownership by the people of industries that serve the public.\" Senator Lehman was another Socialist who was unable to contain his eager- ness to introduce Fabian Socialism into the United States. Speaking on the occa- sion of the American Fabian League Anniversary Symp osium on \"Freedom and the Welfare State,\" Lehman had this to say: \"A hundred and seventy years ago the welfare state concept was translated into the basic law of this land by the founders of the republic...The founding Fathers were the ones who really originated the wel fare state.\" Lehman, like so many of his Socialist colleagues in the Senate, had not the foggiest notion of the Constitution, so it was not surprising that he got it mixed up with the Preamble to the Constitution, which was never made a part of th e Constitution simply because our Founding Fathers rejected the concept of a welf are state. The Preamble to the Constitution: \"to create a more perfect union and to pro- mote the general welfare...\" Sen. Lehman seemed to be engaging in wishful think- ing for this clause is not part of the United State s Constitution. He also appeared to be engaging in the favorite Socialist technique of twisting words and their meaning. There is a General Welfare Clause in the United Sta tes Constitution and it is found in Article 1, Section 8 of the delegated powe rs of Congress. But in this set- ting it means the general welfare of ALL citizens, that is to say, their state of well being which is a far cry from the Socialist meaning of a general handout, the dole, i.e. individual welfare provided by the state. Probably the first time the American Socialists tri ed to implement their plan to attack industrial capital, came with a crafty sc heme proposed by Rexford Guy Tugwell. The scheme involved appointing consumers t o the twenty-seven indus- try boards that were to be set up under what was ca lled \"The National Recovery Act.\" Tugwell was really trying to do away with the profit motive; stripped of its"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"What Socialism Is: Why it Leads to Slavery 27 seemingly benevolent intention of reducing prices t o consumers, the real intention was to slice the profits of the entrepreneurs and i ncrease the wages of the work- ers accordingly, but the scheme was declared uncons titutional by a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court. In 1935, the Court w as not yet packed with \"Liberal\" (i.e. Socialist) judges. Roosevelt was quick to change that \"imbalance.\" It is safe to say that the Supreme Court in the 1920s-1930s really saved the U nited States from being taken over by the Fabian Socialists who had come po uring into every level of government, banking, industry, and the Congress, in an effort to literally over- whelm the country. Socialists, in their endeavor to get past the Const itution with so called \"laws\" like the unconstitutional Brady bill, do not know t hat the United States Constitution is \"the perfect equipoise, equilibrium or balance of the common law.\" The way in which the Constitution was drafted was that all of its provisions meet in the center to neutralize each other, which why bills the Socialist try to slip through on the premise that they can divide the Con stitution, are null and void. The Constitution has to be read as a whole, it cann ot be isolated and parted to fit the weird aspirations of men like President Clinton . This is what Ramsey McDonald came up against, and it is what totally fr ustrated Professor Laski. The Fabian Society of London and its American count erpart were not known for letting obstacles stand in their way. To get ar ound constitutional safeguards, the American Fabian League came up with the idea th at any of their proposals that ran counter to the constitution should be subjected to a referendum. Obviously, with their considerable resources, and with almost the entire jackal press in their pockets, the Fabians felt sure that they could swin g public opinion their way. Just look at what they did in standing behind George Bus h's totally illegal Gulf War. Being aware of the true nature of Socialism and its aims, makes it easier to understand why the Bolshevik Revolution was bought and paid for by City of London and Wall Street bankers, backed by governmen t action which seemed always to help the Bolsheviks. The Bolshevik Revolu tion which was so beloved by Gorbachev, was not an indigenous revolution of t he Russian people. Rather, it wais a foreign ideology, forced upon the Russian na tion at the cost of millions of lives. Bolshevism was neither wanted nor requested by the Russian people; they had no say and no defense against this monstrous politi cal, social and religious force that overcame their land. It is just so with Socialism, which forces human be ings to accept deliberate- ly engineered changes of a most far-reaching nature which they don't want and which are carried out against their wills. Take the so-called Panama Canal treaty as an example. The only difference between Bolshevi sm and Socialism is that in the lormer, brute force and terror tactics are used , while the Socialist does his work slowly and stealthily, the intended victim nev er knowing who the enemy is nor what the end result will be."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"28 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship In \"World Revolution\" we find the true aims of the Communists and their Socialist twin: \"The goal of world revolution is not the destructio n of civilization in a mate- rial sense: the revolution desired by the leaders i s moral and spiritual revolution, and anarchy of ideas by which all standards set up through the nineteen centuries shall be reversed, all honored traditions trampled underfoot, and above all, the Christian ideal finally obliterated.\" A study of Fr anklin Roosevelt's book, \"On Our Way,\" yields substantially the same conclusions . Emma Goldman, one of the Socialist's bright stars, engineered the murder of President McKinley. This was the \"direct\" method fa vored by Communism, but in the last two decades we have seen the type of So cialist anarchy that uses calum- ny, slander, traducery, maligning and denigration o f individual members of the House, Senate and the Presidency, who have attempte d to reveal the dreadful Senator Joseph McCarthy, Senator Huey Long, Vice Pr esident Agnew — the list is much longer but these names should suffice to ma ke the point. Fabian Socialist \"nobility\" is far from being true. They want to gain control of education and the publishing business for the so le purposes of altering the minds of the people by falsely changing the premise s upon which opinions are made, individually, and en-mass. A small group of F abian Socialists set out to accomplish this by moving silently and stealthily, thereby not alerting the audi- ence they wished to capture, as to their real purpo se. It can be said with a certain degree of accuracy, that today, in 1994, this small group has come a long way in that they virtually control the destiny of the Engl ish-speaking world. The Bolshevik Revolution would never have got off t he ground were it not for the full backing and financial resources of lea ding Socialists in Britain and the United States. The rise of Bolshevism, and how it w as financed by Lord Alfred Milner and the Wall Street banks, controlled on a d ay-to-day basis by Milner's emissaries, Bruce Lockhart and Sydney Reilly of Bri tish intelligence MI6, is detailed in \"Diplomacy By Deception.\" In the United States the Socialist purveyors hang o ther signs outside their polit- ical shop windows. No one ever calls himself or her self a Socialist, at least not in public. They wear no badge, registering themselves, \"Liberals,\" \"Progressives\" and \"Moderates.\" Power hungry moves are disguised in te rms of \"peace\" and \"human- itarianism.\" In this regard, the American Socialist s are no less devious than their British controllers. They adopted the British Fabia n Socialist attitude toward nation- alism, declaring it to be irrelevant and not essent ial to achieving what they call, \"Social equality,\" i.e. Socialism. American Sociali sts joined with their British cousins in declaring that the best way to break dow n nationalism and advance the cause of Socialism is via a graduated income tax pr ogram.

In the United States they work at a slower pace than their British counterparts, never showing the direction in which they are traveling. One of their number, Arthur J. Schlesinger Jr., who won a Pulitz er prize for his Socialist lead- ership, wrote, 'There seems no inherent obstacle to the GRADUAL (emphasis added) implementing of Socialism in the United Stat es through a series of 'New Deals' which is a process of backing into Socialism .\" (Partisan Review 1947) We should be aware that traditional liberties we ta ke for granted are gravely threatened by Socialism, which brings far-reaching, damaging, changes on the installment plan. All the while, thanks to their co ntrol of the book industry, pub- lishing in general and the press, we are going thro ugh a non-stop process of being conditioned through \"psychopolitics\" to accept thes e Socialist-mandated changes as inevitable. The deadly, destructive Socialist pr ograms forced upon the United States, beginning in the Wilson presidency, have al ways appeared to be beneficial and helpful, while in reality, destructive and divi sive. Socialism can be fairly described as a dangerous co nspiracy cloaked in a mantle of reforms. Almost without exception, their programs have been, and are always described as \"reforms.\" The Socialists \"refo rmed\" education, and they are \"reforming\" health care. They \"reformed\" the bankin g system, which \"reform\" gave us the Federal Reserve Banks. They \"reformed\" trade laws and broke down protective tariffs that had provided most of the re venue needed to run the coun- try, right up until 1913. In education, the Fabian Socialists seek to create a \"mediocre majority\" that has the semblance, but not the substance, of being educated. The Fabian Socialists fought a secret war to gain c ontrol of education, which began in the 1920s and triumphed in 1980 with the p assage of the Department of Education signed into law by President Carter. This great victory for Socialism guar- anteed that henceforth only mediocre students would leave high school. That was the sum and substance of Socialist \"reform\" of educatio n. There is a misconception abroad that we are smarter today than our forbears. Yet, if we look at the school cur- riculum in 1857, we find this is an absolutely fals e idea. The subjects in which high school students had to be proficient enough to grad uate included: \"Thompson's Arithmetic\" \"Robinson's Algebra\" \"Davie's Algebra\" \"Davie's Geometry\" \"Comstock's Philosophy\" \"Willard's History\" \"Cutter's Physiology\" \"Brown's Grammar\" \"Mitchell's Geography\" \"Sander's Series\""},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"30 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorshi] Looking at the curriculum of colleges in the late 1 880s leaves one astound- ed by the complexity and number of subjects taught. In those days students stud- ied history and knew all about Napoleon and Alexand er the Great. There was no such thing as sheer guesswork, i.e., \"multiple choi ce\" questions. Students could answer the questions in their exam papers or they c ould not. If they did not know them, they were failed and had to stay back to do f urther study. There were no elective methods to get by what you d id not know. Today, there is one elective after another, which leaves s tudents uneducated and unpre- pared for the outside world. Mediocrity is the resu lt, and that is the desired goal of Fabian Socialism educational \"reforms,\" to produ ce a nation with a mediocre educational level. The great Socialist mischief that laid education in the United States low came with the U.S. Supreme Court case, \"Brown vs. School Board, Topeka, Kansas.\" In this case the Socialists arranged matters so tha t educational standards were set just above the lowest common denominator, slightly above the more backward elements in the class room. This was the level at w hich all children were hence- forth to be taught. Obviously, the upper range of i ntelligent students were held at the mediocre levels. So far has education regressed in the United States , that even those whom we think we elect to serve us in Congress, do not unde rstand the language of the Constitution of the United States and our Senators, in particular, grow more incompetent in the Constitution with each passing y ear. Returning to the Bolshevik Revolution. The deceptio n was the Socialist leaders in England gave the false impression that i t was a \"Socialist\" revolu- tion meant to improve the lot of the Russian people and put paid to the tyran- ny of the Romanovs. In fact, the Romanovs were the most benign of all mon- archs in Europe, with a genuine love and caring for their people. Deception is the hall mark of Socialism. Its motto. \"Make Haste Slowly\" is deceptive, because Socialism has not gone slowly and it is not a friend of the working people. Socialism is Communism proceeding more caut iously, but the goals are the same, although the means differ in some ins tances. The common goal of Communism and Socialism is to liquidate the true capitalist free enterprise system and replace it with a strong central governm ent which has control of every aspect of production and distribution of good s and services. Anyone who stands in their way is immediately labeled \"rea ctionary,\" \"rightwing extremist\" a \"McCarthy reactionary,\" \"fascist,\" \"re ligious extremists\" and so on. When you hear these words spoken, then you know the speaker is a Socialist. Communism and Socialism have as their common object ive an ushering in of a federal, One World Government, or as it has be come more popularly known, the \"New World Order.\" Learn what their leaders had to say:"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"What Socialism Is: Why it Leads to Slavery 31 \"I am convinced that Socialism is correct.

R oosevelt. — Norman Thomas. \"Two Worlds.\" To understand the full plan and purpose of Florence Kelley's \"legislative action\" of American Socialists, one must first care fully read the Declaration of Principles of the Fabian Socialists and internation al Socialism: \"It's purpose is to secure a majority in Congress a nd in every State legisla- ture, to win the principal executive and judicial o ffices, to become the dominant party, and when in power, to transfer the industrie s to ownership by the people, beginning with those of public character, such as b anking, insurance etc.\" In the United States, the vast majority of Socialis ts are found in the Democrat Party, with a smattering of \"progressives\" in the R epublican Party. In this sense, Fabian Socialism is a political party, albeit by ad option, as it was in England with the takeover of the Labour Party. It will be recall ed that Kelley was the driving force behind the highly destructive false psycho ju dicial \"Brandeis Briefs\" which changed the way rulings are arrived at by the Supre me Court. Kelley was a close friend of Socialist lesbian Eleanor Roosevelt. (The \"Brandeis Briefs\" method totally sabotaged our legal system and is another e xample of unwanted, undesir- able Socialist-originated changes being forced on t he people of the United States.) In pages 9962-9977, Congressional Record, Senate, M ay 31, 1924, we find the Socialists and Communists aims spelled out even more plainly: \"In short, American Communists themselves admit tha t it is impossible to pro- mote revolution in this country unless the rights o f the States are destroyed, and a centralized bureaucracy, under an entrenched cast o f bureaucrats similar to those in Europe, for Communists (and Socialists) the basic c onditions for revolution.\" While this is slanted toward the Communist goals, l et us not forget that it is also the Socialist's goal, differing only by method and in degree. To which I would add that under Presidents Johnson, Carter, Bush and Clinton, the Socialist agenda for the United States has gone into high gear. Clinton will be a single-term president, but will do more to strongly promote Socialist plans, and do more actual damage than either Roosevelt, Eisenhowe r or Johnson."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"32 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship It is plainly evident to those who seek the truth t hat Communism is not dead. It is only taking a temporary respite and is presen tly waiting in the wings while Socialism catches up. What we have today is what Ka rl Marx called \"Scientific Socialism.\" It was also called \"psychopolitics\" by Professor Harold Laski. President Kennedy adopted \"scientific Socialism—his \"New Frontier\" program taken directly from the British Fabian Society blue print, \"New Frontiers,\" by Henry Wallace (New York, Reynal and Hitchcock 1934) . \"Psychopolitics\" was summed up by Charles Morgan in his book, \"Liberties of the Mind:\" \"...we are all being conditioned to accept limitati ons of freedom...I fear that unconsciously, even if we are ready to accept this new infection...There is no immunity in the great mass of our people and no con sciousness of danger.. .One can think of many ways in which the population as a whole is being conditioned or prepared for this mental change, this loss of in dividuality and identity.\" A clear- er explanation of Socialism boring away from within would be hard to find. The Socialists have been practicing psychopolitics upon the people of England and the United States since the appearance of the Communist Manifesto of 1848. That is why we find in 1994, our senators arguing over the merits of one \"national health plan\" over another, instead of rej ecting outright the whole idea as a Socialist subterfuge. It was Lenin who said th at a national health plan is the arch of Socialism. Likewise, we had the Senate deba ting the merits of the so called Brady bill, instead of rejecting it out of h and as a Socialist subterfuge to get around the Constitution of the United States. An en tire book could be written on this subject alone. The Kennedy administration contained 36 Fabian Soci alists. Two were cab- inet members, three were White House aides, two wer e undersecretaries and one was an assistant secretary of state. The remainder were in policy making positions of vital importance. That is why so many Kennedy-er a policy decisions ran con- trary to the best interests of the United States an d its people and seemed oddly at variance with what Kennedy said he stood for. Since the death of Kennedy, Socialism has taken dee p root in the United States, always watered and nurtured by those who ar e called \"Liberals,\" \"Moderates\" and nursed with great bouts of \"toleran ce.\" Colonel Mandel House, and Sir William Wiseman, director of the North Amer ican desk for British intel- ligence M16 \"ran\" President Wilson, who became the first openly Socialist American President to sit in the Oval Office. Fabian Socialism dominated six United States presid ents, starting with Woodrow Wilson. The Socialists goals never varied, particularly in what they described as \"the difficulties to be overcome,\" and these were, and in some instances still are: 1. Religion, especially the Christian religion."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"What Socialism Is: Why it Leads to Slavery 33 2. National pride of nation states. 3. Patriotism. 4. The United States Constitution and States consti tutions. 5. Opposition to a graduated income tax. 7. Breaking down trade barriers. These goals are de scribed in their blueprint, American Fabian Techniques,\" based on obscurantism. The Fabian Socialist movement was only interested i n recruiting the elite of British society, men like Clement Atlee, Sir Staffo rd Cripps, Herbert Morrison, Emmanuel Shinwell, Ernest Bevin, Lord Grey, Lord As quith and Ramsey McDonald, who went on to work their will on England from Parliament. While these names may be foreign to American readers, these men played a vital role in directing the course the United States was to take, and as su ch, are worthy of mention. An interesting sidelight on the Fabian Society is t hat its committee deter- mined that no more than 5 percent of the population were worthy of becoming good Socialist leaders. Some British Fabian Socialists p layed vital roles in chang- ing the course and direction of the United States a nd we shall return to this aspect. Fabian Socialist MacDonald, who went on to become p rime minister of England, was dispatched to the United States in 1893, to spy out the land. On his return on January 14, 1898, MacDonald told his committee memb ers, 'The great bar to Socialist progress in the United States is its writ ten Constitution, Federal and State, which give ultimate power to a law court.\" MacDonald further stated that it would be necessary to work diligently to carry out the directive of Edward Bellamy, an Ameri can Fabian Socialist. Most of us will know him as the author of the book, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" which was drafted by his mentor, Colonel Thomas Wentworth, a noted Abolitionist and as ardent a Fabian Socialist as one could find. Bellamy was an true believer and follower of the Br itish Fabian Society and one of its first American Fabian chapter members. W riting in the \"American Fabian\" in February, 1895, three years before MacDo nald delivered his fact-find- ing report of his tour of the United States, Bellam y stated, \"...our Constitution being largely individualistic must be changed to ad mit Socialism, and each change necessitates a political crisis. This means the raising of great issues.\" Didn't Wilson raise \"great issues\" and didn't Roose velt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Bush do the same t hing and isn't it remark- able that Clinton is constantly \"raising great issu es?\" This is the methodology of Socialism: raise \"great issues\" like the so called \"healthcare reform\" and behind the clouds of dust raised by the issue, do the dirt y, underhand work of undermin- ing the Constitution of the United States. Herein lies the root explanation of the political a ctions taken by Presidents Wilson, Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Joh nson, Bush and Clinton. "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"34 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship MacDonald's proposals followed very precisely the m odel laid down by Bellamy. MacDonald stressed that the need to alter the Const itution of the United States should be preeminent in the thinking of Fabian Soci alist. We stress once again that Fabian Socialism differed somewhat from Europe an Socialism, more espe- cially in that it claimed to have no party affiliat ions. This would be true, if we ignored the fact that by \"penetration and permeatio n\" it took over the British Labour and Liberal Parties and has now taken over t he Democrat Party of the United States. MacDonald reported that the underlying principles o f the United States Constitution rested on the rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment, especially the right to own property as a corollary to Isaac N ewtons' Natural Law. Therefore, said MacDonald, changing the Constitution was to be done in an obliquely, high- ly secretive way and over a period of many years. H e also pointed to the block to Socialist tactics of penetration and permeation pos ed by the separation of powers between the three departments of government. MacDonald's words were an echo of what Bellamy had proposed in February of 1895. At least Bellamy was better educated in th e constitution than are the vast majority of judges and politicians in this day and age. He readily admitted that the Constitution of the United States was not flexible. This shows up the ignorance of Judge Ruth Ginsberg, lately appointed to the Sup reme Court by Socialist President Clinton, who told a Senate Judiciary Sub- Committee hearing that the Constitution is \"flexible,\" whereas it is immutable . The great vision of Fabian Socialism of the 1890s w as to \"revise\" the United States Constitution, that is, \"reform\" it. Although it appeared on the surface that such a task was beyond its abilities, Fabian abilit y to work silently and secretly was unfortunately under estimated and overlooked. I t reminds me of the popular Frank Sinatra song about some ambitious ants and a rubber tree. The ants had no chance of taking the tree away in one operation, bu t they nevertheless accom- plished the impossible, carrying it away, leaf by l eaf, until the rubber tree was demolished. I believe this is a good analogy of how Fabian Socialism has been working since 1895 (a task which still is ongoing) to carry off the United States Constitution piece by piece. Bellamy and MacDonald might be described as \"vision aries,\" but they were Fabian Socialist visionaries with definite ideas ab out how to succeed. The meth- ods described by \"The American Socialist\" called fo r establishing a Socialist elite in the United States, and then schooling the elite cadre on how to take advantage of every local, state and national crisis for the c overt ends of Socialism and to gain support for such ideas through a well-organized pen etration of the press. The crystallizing of American Fabian Socialism began in earnest in 1905. 'The American Socialist\" also called for forming a cadre of Fabian Socialist professors who in later years would act as advisors for a series of presidents,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"What Socialism Is: Why it Leads to Slavery 35 thereby steering them in the direction of the grand design to socialize the United States. These far-left-of-Marx and Lenin professors were drawn mainly from the ranks of Harvard University Law School. \"Educationa l work\" was undertaken by the elite Harvard Socialist Club, which when overlai d on the British Fabian Society — one of the few times they were bold enoug h to show their Socialist col- ors — revealed a close match. Charter members of the Harvard Socialist Club include d Walter Lippmann, one of those selected by MacDonald and Bellamy to es tablish a Socialist elite cadre in the United States. Lippmann spent years pe netrating the business world. The role played by Lippmann in turning this country toward Fabian Socialism will be explored at another time. As we shall see, Socialists in the inner circles of power were an enemy more to be feared than Communism , although the Americans public was never allowed to see it this w ay. As I have so often said in the past, \"the enemy in Washington is more to be fe ared than the enemy in Moscow.\" The average American, when he did hear anything abo ut Socialism under its own label, was repelled. In the 1890s, the American Fabian Society was a fledg- ting, organization much in need of guidance, especi ally in the technique of going slowly and obscuring its goals. Thus, when Socialis m was mentioned at all, it conjured up visions of weird sexual practices — whi ch today, Socialists are striv- ing to make culturally acceptable — and how to make the dole (welfare) afford- able for everybody. Thus, it was not taken seriousl y, except by a handful of schol- ars who saw it as a greater danger than Bolshevism, at least to America. And when Engels, the deceptive practices role model of Socialists and Marxists visited the United States in 1886, a mista ke was made by promoting his vitriolic, book, \"Origin of the Family\" which later became the Bible for the abor- tionists, the homosexuals and the so called \"women' s lib\" movement of Molly Yard, Patricia Schroeder, Eleanor Smeal. There is s ome proof that the purpose of the visit by Engels was to lay the foundation of th e new, American Fabian Socialist Club. Similarly, when Eleanor Marx — Karl Marx's daughter who was known to be the mistress of George Bernard Shaw — toured the United States with anoth- er lover, this time the live-in Edward Aveling, pub lic reaction was highly unfa- vorable. The public uproar about \"free love\" caught European Socialists by sur- prise, having no idea just how entrenched Christian values were in American soci- ety at that time. They had miscalculated in espousi ng \"free love\" (the basis of abortion, i.e. free love without responsibility) an d their attacks on the values of the family brought nothing but angry responses. This taught the American Socialists a big lesson: M ore haste was a losing philosophy. It had to be \"make haste slowly.\" But th e Socialists never gave up, never lost sight of their goals, and as a result, t oday, the evils of Socialism domi-"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"36 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship nate America on every hand, gaining strength, cultu rally, religiously and social acceptance as they never did when Engels and Eleano r Marx and Edward Aveling were touting their wares. Readers are probably awar e that Aveling was the offi- cial translator from German to English of \"Das Kapi tal,\" the best known of the works written by Marx. In order to deflect criticism away from Socialism, the British Fabian Society decided to form a group in the United States that b ecame known as the American Economic Association which convened on September 9, 1885. Only the elite cadre of American Socialists in the making were inv ited to attend. (It was fol- lowing this meeting that the British Fabian Sociali sts decided that Mac Donald would have to visit the United States to ascertain what problems were in the way of Socialism, and how to overcome them.) The American Economic Association drew all the lead ing Socialist and would-be Socialist leaders of the day to Saratoga, New York on September 9, 1885. Many of the \"distinguished guests\" as they we re described in the New York newspapers, were leading Socialist professors, amon g them, Woodrow Wilson who was to become the first openly Socialist presid ent of the United States. Others in attendance were Professors Ely, H. R. Ada ms, John R. Commons and E. James, Dr. E. R. Seligman of Columbia, Dr. A lbert Shaw and E.W. Bemis, who went on to become the leading disciples of Soci alism in America. None were known outside of their limited academic circles, an d Socialism was not given any thought as a serious threat to the American way of life. This was a mistake that was to be made many times in the future, one which is being repeated today. From this small beginning has grown the oak tree of Soci alism in the United States, whose spreading branches now threaten the Confedera te Republic of the United States. Wilson, then at Bryn Mawr College, went on to teach Socialism at the Philadelphia University Extension in 1902, disguise d as Political Science. There he was immersed with other leading Socialist in promoting Socialist ideas in teaching. Included in the list of Socialis t professors were British Fabian Society members, Sydney Webb, R.W. Alden and Edward R. Pease; Ely and Adams, two of his American associates we have alrea dy mentioned. Other promi- nent American Socialists who fed Wilson on a diet o f their Socialist ideas were Morris Hilquitt and Upton Sinclair. Their contacts with British Fabian Socialists extended to meetings held at Oxford between 1805 an d 1901. Dr. Seligman of Columbia University sponsored the m eetings and is credit- ed with the foresight of having the presidency go t o Wilson. The similarity between the rise of Wilson and Clinton is quite rem arkable: Both were strongly Socialist by persuasion, both were surrounded by a large number of Socialist intellectuals, and both had Socialist ideals indeli bly imprinted on them though contact with Oxford University. Wilson was greatly influenced by such a Fabian Soci alist publications as,"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"What Socialism Is: Why it Leads to Slavery 37 The New Freedom.\" Moreover, he was the first United States President to accept university professors as advisors — a radical depar ture from past traditions and an outright Socialist strategy— methodology of forc ing unwanted unacceptable changes upon the American people. The rationale was that nobody would suspect academics of infamous purposes. Very early on, Wilson was backed by British Fabian Socialist Dr. Albert Shaw who got Wilson elected by splitting the vote, running Theodore Roosevelt on an independent ticket, the so-called Bull Moose Party. As Dr. Seymour said at the time, \"Roosevelt's defection put Wilson in the White House.\" The subterfuge included House \"denouncing\" Roosevelt as \"a wild ra dical,\" and it worked. Wilson became the President of the United States an d his friend Albert Shaw was appointed to the Labor Committee as a reward when W ilson entered the White House. Although carefully concealed from the public, the B ritish Fabian Socialist selected Wilson, based on his propensity for Social ist issues, and on the strong rec- ommendation of House, whose brother in-law Dr. Sydn ey Mezes, was a long-time affiliate of the British Fabian Society and preside nt of the City College of New York. Mezes played a prominent role in pre and post WWI Socialist planning. Added to this was that a large percentage of member s of the Fabian Society were Marxists, one of the most notable in the Londo n Fabian Society was Professor Harold Laski, who went on to play a profo undly disruptive role in socializing of the United States, right up to the t ime of his death in 1952. It is not disputed that Bernard Baruch, who went on to be Wil son's absolute controller du r i n g his years in the White House, was also a Mar xist. The entire agenda for Woodrow Wilson's presidency w as set by Socialist advisors, both here and in Britain. One of the firs t of Wilson's Socialist efforts was to federalize powers that were prohibited to th e federal government, being reserved to the several States. These included the police powers of health, educa- tion, labor and police protection guaranteed to the States by the 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution. In later years Professor Harold Laski was to put gr eat pressure on President Roosevelt to break down and destroy through executi ve action the separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judic ial branches of government. This was the key to the back door of breaking down and making the Constitution of \"no effect.\" One of the main items on the Wilson agenda was the destruction of Customs tariffs, which, up to 1913 had provided the United States with enough income to pay the bills of the nation and still hav e a surplus. The hidden agenda was to destroy this source of income and replace it with the Marxist-inspired graduated income tax. Apart from what else it would achieve, the Marxist gradu- ated income tax was designed to forever burden the middle class. It will be recalled that one of the principle obstacles that R amsey MacDonald said had to"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"38 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship be overcome was resistance to graduated income tax. Thanks to President Wilson, the British Fabian Society was able to impose this onerous burden on the American people, thus realizing one of their cheris hed ambitions. It is necessary to say this, and to say it loud and clear: Communism, although the originator, did not bring graduated income tax to the United States. This was solely the work of the British Fabian Society. For the past 76 years the American people have been dunned into believing that Communi sm is the biggest danger to a free world. We hope that in the pages of this boo k will be found enough evi- dence to point out that the danger from Socialism, transcends anything thus far seen from Communism. Socialism has wrought a thousa nd more times havoc within the United States than Communism ever did. Twice found to be unconstitutional by the United St ates Supreme Court, graduated income tax was proposed to Wilson by the British Fabian Society and its passage, urged by the American Fabian Socialist s, was finally realized by 1916, just in time to pay for WWI. While the Americ an people had their attention focused on events in Europe, the Sixteenth Amendmen t was slipped through Congress, aided and abetted by a whole flock of Soc ialist legislators. The Sixteenth Amendment not ever having been ratifi ed by all of the States, remains outside the pale and ken of the Constitutio n, but that has not stopped its Socialist backers from having their way. Wilson att empted to equate democracy with the Democratic Party, while in fact, there cou ld be no such party. The cor- rect title should be the Democrat Party. We cannot have a \"Democratic Party\" in a Confederate Republic or a Constitutional Republic . Wilson's book \"The New Freedom\" (actually written b y Socialist William B. Hayle) denounced capitalism. \"It is contrary the co mmon man\" Wilson said. At a time when the United States was enjoying prosperity and industrial progress such as never seen before, Wilson called the economy \"st agnant\" and proposed a rev- olution to get things moving again. Strange reasoni ng indeed — that is if we over- look the fact that Wilson was preaching unadulterat ed Socialism: \"We stand in the presence of a revolution — not blo ody revolution, America is not given to spilling blood — but a silent revol ution, whereby America will insist upon recovering in practice those ideals whi ch she has always professed, upon securing a government devoted to the general a nd not special interests.\" The most important thing that was omitted in the speech was that this was to be a SOCIALIST REVOLUTION, one of stealth and boundless in its deceit, based upon British Fabian Socialist ideals and principles . Wilson then made a prophetic prediction — at least, seemingly prophetic, except that upon close examination, he was merely s pelling out the Socialist agenda for the United States: \"...We are upon the threshold of a time when the sy stematic life of the coun- try will be sustained, or at least supplemented, at every point by government"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"What Socialism Is: Why it Leads to Slavery 39 activity. And we now have to determine what kind of a governmental activity it shall be; whether, in the first place, it shall be directed from government itself, or whether it shall be indirect, through instrumentali ties which have already consti- tured themselves and which stand ready to supersede government.\" The people of America remained largely ignorant of the fact that a sinister force was at play, totally foreign to themselves an d the Constitution, which had somehow insinuated itself into power by placing a c hief executive in the White House, a leader totally beholden to a ruthless and power-hungry group as could be found anywhere in the world — including Bolshevi k Russia — that power bring the Fabian Socialists in Britain and the Unit ed States. This trend has continued until today, and as we are seeing, now has President Clinton as its eager, and anxious to please chief e xecutive. The \"high hopes\" of the ants seeking to carry off the rubber tree plant is slowly, and inexorably, being realized. A great nation, the United States of Amer ica, seems totally unaware of the criminality behind Socialism and ignorant of it s purposes, and is therefore ill prepared to call a halt to the criminal depredation s taking place before its very How was it possible for Wilson to have deceived the American people on such a monstrous matter as graduated income tax, so mething foreign to the Constitution, and which the country had been able t o do without up to 1913? For answers we need to look again at Socialist ability to implement their program by stealth, by deceit and by outright falsehood while couching it in language that seemed to indicate the poisonous dish it was prepar ing was for the good of the people. The first hurdle Wilson had to overcome was disband ing trade tariffs that had protected America's trade and made it a prosperous nation, with living standards the envy of the world, On July 4, 1789, President G eorge Washington told the First Congress of the United States, \"A free people should promote such manu- factories as tend to render them independent on oth ers for essential, particularly military supplies.\" These wise words set in motion a system of tariff b arriers that imposed Customs duties on countries wishing to sell their g oods in the United States mar- ket, the antithesis of so-called \"free trade\" which was nothing more than a sub- terfuge devised by Adam Smith to allow Britain to d ump its goods on the market with no reciprocity for American goods on the Engli sh market. The impression was somehow cultivated — possibly through control o f the press — that the United States had developed the living standard of its people on the basis of \"free trade,\" whereas, in reality, the opposite was true. We saw this deception come to the fore during the P erot-Gore Debate, when Gore, falsely and with malice aforethought against the people of the United States, denounced tariff barrier protectionism as t he cause of the 1929 Wall Street"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"40 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship Crash. Perot was not versed in the Smoot — Hawley A ct to defend it against the lies of the Vice President. \"Free trade\" was spelled out as a Marxist doctrine in a speech made by Marx in 1848. This was not a new thing, but one first pr oposed by Adam Smith to undermine the economy of the young American nation. A wise Washington real- ized that protection of America's fledgling industr ies was needed. This wise pro- tection policy was carried on by Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley. For 125 years, Americans benefited greatly from this wise policy, until the Wilson Socialist wrecker's ball was used to change the face of the U nited States: Even as late as up to WWII, only two percent of the economy of the United States depended on foreign trade, yet, to hear it n ow, the United States will per- ish if it does not do away with the last vestiges o f our wise tariff barriers. What Wilson did was treason and the Congress committed s edition by going along with his devastating attack on the living standards of t he American people. For the most part the Wilson administration badly m auled the Constitution. No soon had the Fabian Socialists got Wilson electe d, than he called for a Joint Session of the Congress. By 1900, a mostly Republic an government had main- tained existing trade barriers and erected fresh ta riff barriers to protect the American farmer, industry, and producers of raw mat erials. The agitation against protective tariff barriers had its origin in London among members of the Fabian Society Socialist, who were in control of the Royal Institute for International Affairs (RIIA). Ideas for breaching the tariff barr iers were fed to Wilson via the seditious Mandel House, directly from London. The anti-tariff propaganda that spewed forth from L ondon in a never ending stream, and which had begun in earnest in 1897, and the following is an example: \"The American manufacturer reached the highest leve l of inefficiency in 1907, following a noticeable decline which began in 1897, in several important fields, American manufacturers cannot hold their ow n against foreign competitors in the domestic market. This fact should be brought to the attention of the American people on the basis that because of tariff s, they are paying a higher price for goods than would be the case if tariff ba rriers which impede trade were removed. The phrase, 'the mother of all trusts' mig ht be a useful way to describe protectionism, especially if linked to the rising c ost of living which can be attrib- uted to protectionist policies.\" Note: The Fabian S ociety's Research Department began churning out papers they called \"tracts\" as i f they were allied with Christian missionary efforts. These thousands of \"t racts\" were later assembled into books and position papers. The above quotation is taken from a tract pub- lished in 1914. What this lying propaganda did not say was that the re was no link between the rising cost of living between 1897 and 1902, si nce tariff rates had no effect on domestic prices. But this did not stop a concerted attack by the major newspapers,"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"What Socialism Is: Why it Leads to Slavery 41 owned by foreign investors (particularly the New Yo rk Times) from blasting tar- iff protection as a cause in the rise in the cost o f living. This was echoed by the \"London Economist\" and other magazines owned by Cit y of London bankers. Sedition was not confined to Democrats. Many so-cal led \"progressive Republicans\" (\"progressive\" and \"moderate\" have alw ays meant Socialist) joined in the attack on protective tariffs. How did the So cialists succeed in getting the Congress to go along with their plans to wreck our trade, the envy of the world? They did it by combining sociology with politics, w hich technique pushes Socialists to high positions, from where they can e xert the utmost undue influence on national issues of vital importance. As an example, take the matter of diplomatic recogn ition for the barbarous Bolshevik government. Thanks to the good offices of Arthur Henderson, in 1929 British recognized the Bolshevik butchers as the le gitimate government of Russia. They then turned their attention to the United Stat es, and thanks to Socialists installed in high places, got the United States to do likewise. These actions by the leaders of the English — speaking world, gave the B olsheviks prestige and respect to which they were obviously not entitled, and opened doors to diplomat- ic contacts, trade and economic matters that would otherwise have remained firm- ly shut for decades — perhaps for all time. Fabian Socialists, both in the United States and Br itain appeared in such a benign light and their highly-cultured background a nd great personal charm made it very hard to believe those who were warning that these affable, social elite were a subversive group desirous of stripping the right to own property and threaten- ing to carry off the United States Constitution, pi ece by piece. It just didn't seem possible to think of this elite group as revolution aries and anarchists — which in essence is exactly what they were. A prime example of this was Colonel Edward Mandel H ouse, who was not only properly conventional in every sense of the word, b ut conservative in manner and speech — at least while in earshot of the public, b ut one who moved in circles that were far from what one would imagine a group of ana rchists to look like. It was this group of \"affable anarchists\" who elect ed Woodrow Wilson. As House saw it, United States citizens were little be tter than dolts, who could be deceived by appearances. So certain that the voters would not see the nomination of Wilson as a candidate \"Made In England,\" House s ailed for Europe on the day that Wilson was nominated at the Democrat conventio n in Baltimore in 1912. \"I feel no need to watch the proceedings\" House told W alter Hines, who had intro- duced him to Wilson the year before. On his arrival in England, House told a gath- ering of Fabian Socialists of the RIIA, \"I was conf ident that the American people would accept Wilson without question.\" And so it wa s. Wilson went on to become the president, his main ta sk being to undermine the Constitution as mandated by Ramsey McDonald, wi thout the American peo-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"42 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship ple ever becoming aware of it, in true Fabian Socia list style. House had often expressed his hatred of the Constitution in private discussions with his secret backers on Wall Street. He called the United States Constitution, \"a creation of 18th century minds, not only outmoded, but grotesqu e,\" adding, \"it ought to be scrapped at once.\" We shall return to the man Wilso n called his greatest friend. As House put it, \"Wilson was elected to carry out a Socialist agenda without alarming the people.\" How this was to be done was l aid out in a fictionalized ver- sion of the blueprint of Fabian Socialist long rang e goals. \"Philip Dru, Administrator\" was a remarkable confession of Socia list planning and strategies to be used against the American people, very reveal ing in how Socialists expect- ed the presidency of the United States to be subver ted and undermined. Published by Fabian Socialist B.W. Huebsch, the boo k should have set alarm bells ringing across America, but unhappily, failed to make clear to the American people what House stood for. It set the agenda for the Wilson presidency as clearly as if it had been presented to the Congress by Hous e himself. \"Philip Dru\" (actual- ly House) proposed that he become the ruler of Amer ica by a series of Executive Orders. Among the tasks \"Dru\" set himself was estab lishing a panel of economists to work on the destruction of tariff law which woul d eventually, \"lead to the aboli- tion of the theory of protection as government poli cy.\" The panel would also work out a system of graduated income tax and institute new banking laws. Note the sly use of the word \"theory.\" Protective tariffs were n o mere theory: Customs duties had earned the United States a living standard that was the envy of the world. Trade protection was an established doctrine set in place by George Washington, which had proved its worth for 125 years, and was not mer e theory. How could \"Dru\" call tariff protection a \"theory?\" Obviously, it was an attempt to denigrate and belittle the concept and o pen the way for the Socialist ideal of \"free trade\" which would begin the decline of the living standards of the American people. It a was also where Wilson got his income tax idea from, which once in place, would further erode the middle class living-standard. Wilson violated his oath to uphold the United State s Constitution on at least 50 separate occasions. In Wilson, the Committee of 300 had found the ideal man to begin the Socializing of America, just as in lat er years, they found another ideal candidate for their anarchistic purposes in Bill Cl inton. A second parallel between Wilson and Clinton is to be found in the type of ad visers with whom they sur- rounded themselves. In the Wilson inner circle were prominent anarchist s-Socialists and Communists Louis D. Brandeis, Felix Frankfurter, Wa lter Lippmann, Bernard Baruch, Sydney Hillman, Florence Kelley and of cour se, Edward Mandel House. House, a close friend of Roosevelt's mother, lived two blocks away from N.Y. State Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt and met freque ntly to give him advice on how to pay for his coming Socialist programs."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"What Socialism Is: Why it Leads to Slavery 43 The first attack on the Constitution was Ramsey McD onald's declaration that the Constitution had to be altered. The second atta ck was carried out by House, whose father had made millions of dollars during th e Civil War by doing the bid- ding of the Rothschilds and the Warburgs. After his meeting with Wilson in 1911 through the good offices of Walter Hines, House was certain that he had found the right man to carry out the job of altering the Unit ed States Constitution as man- dated by McDonald on January 14, 1898. House began to cultivate Wilson, who was flattered by the attention of a man who seemed to know everybody in Washington. There i s a distinct parallel between House and Mrs. Pamela Harriman, who saw in Clinton the ideal man to carry out a wide variety of Socialist reforms witho ut alarming the people. Mrs. Harriman also knew everybody in Washington. House knew that Wilson would need tutoring by an ar dent Socialist, so he arranged for Wilson to meet Harvard law professor L ouis D. Brandeis. The meet- ing was to prove ominous for the future well being of the nation, as Brandeis was committed to making the Constitution of no effect u sing the legislative route, Brandeis was already writing his predilections into law by \"interpreting\" the Constitution in such a manner as to make it of no e ffect based on sociological premises and not Constitutional law. The third Fabian Socialist attack on the United Sta tes Constitution came with the founding of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in January, 1920 by Fabian Socialist Philip Lovett. Huebsch, the publis her of \"Philip Dru, Administrator\" was a founder member of this Sociali st body whose main purpose in life was to alter the United States Constitution by what Florence Kelley called \"the legislative route.\" Although it is denied, investigations showed that t here were four known Communists on the ACLU board. In the 1920s, Kelley and her associates worked hard to destroy the United States Constitution thro ugh a series of false fronts such as the National League of Women's Voters, and we sh all return to that later. This was the beginning of the \"defeminising\" of women by the Socialists. Many of the most important Socialist (and Communist ) leaders in the United States were closely associated with the ACLU, while some even sat on its nation- al committee. One of these was Robert Moss Lovett, a director and a close friend of Norman Thomas and Paul Blanchard who were allied with \"Protestants and Other Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.\" Thomas was a former clergyman turned Communist. Lov ett's charming manner and pleasant demeanor belied the fact that u nder his affable manner lurk e d a dangerous anarchist-radical of the worst s tripe. In an intemperate fit, Lovett once blew up and revealed his true character : \"I hate the United States, I would be willing to see the whole world blow up, if it would destroy the United States.\" Lovett personified the highly dangerous si de of the Fabian Socialist."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"44 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship In researching statements made by Communists agains t the United States, I was never able to find one so venomous in intent as that made by Lovett of the ACLU. It might be worthwhile to give a short histor y of the ACLU at this point in the book: The ACLU grew out of the 1914-1918 Civil Liberties Bureau, which was against militarism. One of its first directors was Roger Baldwin who had spent time in prison for evading the draft. In a very rev ealing advisory letter to mem- bers, affiliates and friends of the ACLU, Baldwin u sed traditional Fabian Socialist deceptive tactics to conceal the real intent and pu rpose of the ACLU: \"Do steer away from making it look like a Socialist enterprise. We want also to look like patriots in everything we do. We want to get a good lot of flags, talk a great deal about the Constitution and what our fo refathers wanted to make of the country and show that we are really the folks t hat really stand for the spirit of our institutions.\" If ever the later emblem of the British Fabian Society fit, this was it — the wolf in sheep's clothing par excellenc e. In 1923 Baldwin forgot his own advice, revealing hi s true colors: \"I believe in revolution — not necessarily the forc ible seizure of power in armed conflict, but the process of a growth of clas s movements determined to expropriate the capitalist class and take control o f all social property. Being a pacifist — because I believe non-violent means best calculated in the long run to achieve enduring results, I am opposed to revolutio nary violence. But I would rather see violent revolution than none at all, tho ugh I would not personally sup- port it because I consider other means far better. Even the terrible cost of bloody revolution is a cheaper price to pay to humanity th an the continued exploitation and wreck off human life under the settled violence of the present system.\" In 1936 Baldwin explained some of the terminology u sed by Fabian Socialists: \"By progressive, I mean forces working for the demo craticizing of industry by extending public ownership and control, which al one will abolish the power of the comparatively few who own the wealth...Real dem ocracy means strong trade unions, government regulation of business, ownershi p by the people of industries that serve the public.\" Just how far the Socialists have come down the road to enslaving the United States can be seen by visiting any factory. On the walls of the office will be seen a bewildering array of \"permits\" empowering one thi ng or another. OSHA, EPA and \"Equal Opportunity\" inspectors have the \"right\" to come in unannounced at any time, interrupt and even stop operations, while they carry out an inspection to see whether the conditions laid out in their \"permi ts\" have been violated. The deceptive language used by Baldwin did not mean what the average American took them to mean. Baldwin was practicing Fabian Socialist techniques on an elite \"rearguard\" group who would lead Americ an gently by the hand down"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"What Socialism Is: Why it Leads to Slavery 45 the road to slavery. This is Socialism at its very worst. No one could have explained the aims and methods of Socialism better than the chairman of the ACLU, which today, has not altered its stance and m ethods one single iota. Although its membership never exceeded 5,000 betwee n the 1920-1930s, the ACLU nevertheless succeeded in infiltrating and per meating every aspect of American life, which it then proceeded to turn upsi de down. The foremost task of the ACLU in the 1920s was to l egally block the large number of arrests and deportation of Communists, an archists. In the early 1920s the Socialists were starting their drive to subvert the United States Constitution through underhand means, using foreign-born aliens to preach — and carry out acts of sedition. Harvard Socialist Professor Felix Frankfurter acted as the legal guide for the ACLU, whose Roger Baldwin, desc ribed anarchists, Communists, seditionists as \"victims of the law, me mbers of labor and welfare movements who are being insidiously attacked by uns crupulous men working under the cloak of patriotism.\" Frankfurter — assisted by Harold Laski from behind the scenes — helped President Wilson set up a Mediation Committee, whic h Committee prompted by Frankfurter, kept on using the Constitution to qual ify the seditionists, anarchist, avowed enemies of the United States for protection under the United States Constitution. It was a sordid tactic which has work ed remarkably well: Since 1920, the MISUSE of the United States Constitution to grant \"rights\" and protec- tion to every Dick, Tom and Harry trying to undermi ne the Confederated Republic has burgeoned to a dreadfully alarming deg ree. Others who threw their weight behind \"persecuted im migrants\" and \"victims of the law\" in which category was recorded every le ftist, arsonist, Socialist agita- tor, murderer and seditionist, were Professor Arthu r M. Schlesinger Sr. and Harvard Law Professor Francis B. Sayre, Wilson's so n-in-law. It was the begin- ning of a huge campaign to trammel underfoot the re al purpose and intent of the United States Constitution, and it was crowned with success beyond the wildest dreams of the sappers of Socialism in this country. This was a period when the United States was trying to rid the country of a flood of Communists who came here to commit acts of sedition in an attempt to Communize and Socialize the country. Socialist Upto n Sinclair wrote reams in defense of hard-core seditionists and Harvard Law S chool sent some of its best Socialists into the fray, including its dean, Rosco e Pound. The news media, including magazines like 'The Nation\" and the \"New Republic\" did their level best to cloud the straightforward legal issues by c onstantly referring to \"the Red scar e.\" In 1919, the Overman committee on Bolshevism of the United States Senate, after exhaustive enquires, came to the conclusion t hat Fabian Socialism was a grave threat to the citizens of the United States, especially to women and children."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"46 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship The ACLU has been in the vanguard of \"defeminising\" women under the guise of \"women's rights. \"The ACLU has successfully protect ed the prime movers of Socialism, by rushing to their defense whenever the y fear the real leaders and pur- poses of Socialism might be exposed.

From 1920, the modus operandi of the ACLU has remai ned the same, and can better be described by itself: \"Against those indiscriminate federal, state and lo cal measures which though aimed at Communism, (note the exclusion of Socialis m) threaten the civil liber- ties of all Americans; to make an effective civil r ights program the law of the land; against both governmental and private pressure grou p censorship of movies, books, plays, newspapers, magazines, radio and to p romote fair procedures in court trials, congressional and administrative hear ings.\" The ACLU left no doubt that it intended to rewrite the Constitution \"by the legislative route.\" Nor can there be any doubt that this important Socialist appa- ratus has changed the face of America In an intervi ew with Fareed Zakaria of \"Foreign Affairs,\" Lee Kuan Yew, former prime minis ter of Singapore, was asked: \"What in your view has gone wrong with the A merican system?\" \"It is not my business to tell people what is wrong with their system. It is my business to tell people not to foist their system i n discriminately on societies in which it will not work,\" Yew replied. Zakaria then asked, \"Do you not view the United States as a model for other countries?\" to w hich Lee responded: \"...But as a total system, I find parts of it (the United States) totally unac- ceptable. . .vagrancy, unbecoming behavior in publi c, the expansion of the right of the individual to behave as he pleases has come at the expense of orderly soci- ety.

Man needs a certain moral sense of right and wrong. There is su ch a thing called evil and it is not the result of being a victim of society...\" There can be no doubt about the crucial role played by the ACLU in stretch- ing existing \"rights\" and inventing rights that do not exist in the Constitution to the extent that the United States today is in a vir tual state of anarchy. Take as an example the \"Gay Pride\" parade staged in San Franci sco on Father's Day Sunday, June 19, 1994. The choice of day and date was no accident, but a d eliberate, studied insult Christianity, the tradition of marriage and family. The parade consisted of lesbians roaring around on motorbikes, naked, and semi naked , (so-called \"Dykes on Bikes\") men in obscene drag costumes and hordes of other men with their geni- tals fully exposed and lopping about as they ran hi ther and thither. This was an altogether disgusting display of vulgarity on city streets that would never have been tolerated before, and should not now be tolera ted. But let anybody bring up the disgusting \"parade\" an d perhaps suggest suit- able action to curb such ugly, utterly baneful disp lays in the future, then they will be sure to find the ACLU charging in to protect the \"civil rights\" of the most unmoralized, amoral sector of the population. The d eplorable \"parade\" was praised by the San Francisco Chronicle, which also carried a rave review of a movie about two lesbians \"falling in love.\" The pap er described this disgusting piece of amorality as \"suitable for straights.\" Thu s far have we, as a society, sunk to the bottom of the Socialist cesspool. Fabian Soc ialists have always been great admirers of Karl Marx. They do not readily admit to this \"hero worship\" lest the sheep that they so despise should become alarmed. D uring my five year stint of intensive study at the British Museum in London, I examined Marx's economic writings in some depth. I could do this because Kar l Marx had spent 30 years stud yin g in the same British Museum, and some of my mentors knew which books he liked and read the most, told me what they were. What I discovered about his writings was how little of it was original thought. This is common to most of the great Social ist \"thinkers.\" All of Marx's theories about economics, stripped of dense verbiag e surrounding them, can be boiled down to seven or eight basic mathematics equ ations that I could do when I was in the eighth grade. All that Marx's theories add up to is the precept t hat capitalists who finance business ventures end up stealing large sums of mon ey from the workers. This completely ignores the real premise that having tak en all the risks in starting up the venture, the investor is entitled to his profit . That, in essence, is the sum and substance of Marx's and his verbiage-ridden theorie s. Ranking second only to the ACLU was the League of I ndustrial Democracy (LID). Founded in 1905, which came out of the Inter -collegiate Socialist Society,"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"48 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship the League was to play an important role in distort ing education, industry and labor. LID was supported by Eleanor Roosevelt all o f her life, as did Florence Kelley and Frances Perkins. Eleanor Roosevelt promo ted \"social democracy\" inside and outside of the organization along with F rances Perkins, her husband's New York State Commissioner of Labor and a great fr iend of Socialist Justice Harlan Stevens. Morris Hillquit served as LID treasurer from 1908 t o 1915. Lovett, the ACLU leader for so long, was always closely affilia ted with the League for Industrialized Democracy, once calling that period of his Socialist career as, \"the happiest days of my life.\" Morris Hillquit had very early on in his socialist career advocated \"industrial socialism.\" Hillquit and Eugene V. Debbs always followed the Lo ndon Fabian Society model of not having programs and platforms, but rat her in using educational insti- tutes as a captive audience and so inspire students with Socialist ideas and philosophies that they would later be able to infil trate existing political parties. Courses in Socialism were discreetly introduced, at least in the early 1900s, but by the 1970s, in true Fabian Socialist orthodoxy, t he process had been consider- ably speeded up in many institutes of learning It is said that the League of Industrial Democracy revitalized American Socialism, which in 1900 was flagging. At that poin t, several prominent members of the elite in American society, visited the Fabia n Socialists in England. Among them were religious leaders, teachers and politicia ns: Paul Douglas who went on to be Senator Douglas, Arthur M. Schlesinger whose son rose to prominence in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, Melvyn Dou glas the actor and his wife, Helen Douglas, and Walter Raushenbusch, a for mer minister at the Second Baptist Church of New York. Raushenbusch was a devo ted disciple of Giuseppe Mazzini, John Ruskin, Edward Bellamy and Marx. Mazz ini was a world leader of Masonry. Ruskin was a self-styled \"Old School Commu nist\" who taught at Oxford. Bellamy was the leading Socialist in Americ a at that time. Raushenbusch gave up preaching Christianity for pre aching Socialist poli- tics, which he tried to indoctrinate in as many fel low Baptists as he could reach. LID was on the list of United States military intel ligence as a subversive organi- zation, but along with many similar Socialist and C ommunist organizations, Woodrow Wilson ordered the military to destroy the lists it was holding, which was a loss that could not ever be made again good. The fact that Wilson had no powers under the Constitution that allowed him to g ive such an order, was tossed aside as inconsequential by the Socialists in his a dministration at Harvard and on Wall Street. But it was neither German agents in WWI nor Russian agents in the Cold War era, but British Fabian Socialists who penetrat ed and permeated every aspect of government, its institutions and the pres idency itself. Education was rec-"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"What Socialism Is: Why it Leads to Slavery 49 ognized as the way that Socialism could be advanced , so a great effort was made to capture the \"student market.\" When the Lusk Comm ittee was investigating New York's Rand School, reference was made to this: \"We have already called attention to the Fabian Society as a very interesti ng group of intellectuals who engage in a very brilliant campaign of propaganda.\" Apparently the Lusk Committee was somewhat taken in by the false air of candor that permeated LID publications and no viole nt revolutionary types were allowed to sully its membership lists. The Lusk Com mittee, distracted and look- ing for Communists —just as the United States has b een doing ad infinitum — completely missed the highly subversive and dangero us LID. It never ceases to amaze observers just how skillfully the Socialists were able to deflect attention away from themselves by repeatedly referring to \"th e Red scare\" and denigrating all efforts to ensure internal security as based on a non-existent \"Communist threat.\" We are still largely being fooled in the s ame way in 1994 as was the Lusk Committee in 1920. After WWI, LID teamed up with several prominent Soc ialist organizations in the United States, among them the ACLU, Federate d Press and the Garland Fund which was cited by military intelligence as be ing kindly disposed toward funding Communists and some decidedly Socialist org anizations. Robert Moss Lovett of the ACLU was a director in all of the afo rementioned bodies including \"Protestants and other Americans United for the Sep aration of Church and State.\" LID members were encouraged to disavow Socialism in public and disavow their parent, the Fabian Society, founded by Sydney and Beatrice Webb. This was standard Socialist practice: deny, deny, deny. When one the Fabian Society's most honored member was asked if he was a Socialist, Joh n Kenneth Galbraith replied \"of course not.\" During WWII, when it was obvious t hat Roosevelt would do any- thing to get the United States committed to the war against Germany, LID felt it expedient to changes its stance and in 1943 publish ed a statement that said LID had as its goal increasing an understanding of demo cracy through education, and not making war. What LID did not say was the \"democracy\" it had in mind was what Karl Marx called \"scientific Socialist democracy.\" That the United States was a repub- lic and not a democracy, was merely waved aside. Th us by subterfuge, by stealth and by cunning, LID became the leading Socialist bo dy in the United States, ded- icated to the downfall of the Republic. The history of LID shows that it played a key role in bringing Socialist \"reforms\" to the fro nt burner in both the Wilson and Roosevelt administrations. When Roosevelt was Governor of New York, he appoint ed Frances Perkins to be his Industrial Commissioner. (We give the rem arkable achievements of Perkins in the chapters on women Socialists.) Perki ns called on LID economist Paul H. Douglas to draft an unemployment relief pro gram which was adopted by"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"50 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship Governor Roosevelt. One of her collaborators was Dr . Isadore Lubin, a dedicated Socialist, who along with Perkins, pushed for prefe rential treatment for the Soviet Union, advice that Roosevelt was quick to accept. Perkins and Lubin began the long process based on B ritish Fabian Socialist strategy of transforming the United States from a C apitalist into a Socialist state, via a welfare state. Included in this plan was the \"national health insurance plan\" lifted straight out of the Soviet Union. It is wort hy of note that \"health care reform,\" nationwide old age pensions and unemployme nt insurance, were all part of the plan to alter the structure of the United St ates, in which \"social security\" was no small part. In 1994 we have another female Socialist, Hillary C linton, latching onto the term, \"health care reform\" as though it were her ow n invention, when in fact it was the term used by Presotonia Martin Mann, one of the most devoted female Socialists on the American scene, who in turn had b orrowed it from the British Fabian Socialist leader Sydney Webb. The phrase was a masterpiece of applied psychology on a level with another piece of applied psychology intended to deceive, the \"Social Security Act,\" invented in Eng land and brought to this coun- try by Father Ryan. The Fabian Socialist blueprint was then adapted for American conditions by Prestonia Martin as we find in her bo ok, \"Prohibiting Poverty,\" championed by Eleanor Roosevelt. LID never claimed any credit for its behind the sce nes in the endeavors of Perkins and Martin, as indeed it never claimed that Felix Frankfurter was one of its very own. The extensive damage to the United St ates done by LID is remark- able, given the relative smallness of the group. Th is is precisely the way Fabian Socialism works — blend into the background, infilt rate all of government and important decision-making bodies, and then promote (always from the back- ground) a rising political star to initiate Sociali st designed programs. This is the way Socialism worked in the 1920s, and still works in this way in the United States, which is how the Socialists and their Marxist/Communist allies, came perilously close to taking over the Un ited States in the 1920s and early 1930s. Near perfect examples of Socialism wor king through rising politi- cians were Wilson, Roosevelt, Johnson, Bush and now , President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton. Clinton was selected by the British Fabian Society, but the job of \"puffing\" him was given in secret to Sociali st Pamela Harriman. One term President Clinton has the task of rushing Socialist programs of far reaching and devastating consequences into law. His successes by mid 1994 include, the largest income tax increase in the wor ld, One World Government trade agreements, and possibly \"national health ref orm.\" Three times before, British Fabian Socialism has changed the face of Am erica by using leadership groups and \"advisors\" to the president, and via the courts, to achieve Socialist objectives. It was left to LID to supply the person nel Perkins and Roosevelt need-"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"What Socialism Is: Why it Leads to Slavery 51 ed to implement the \"New Deal.\" Of more than a pass ing interest is that the \"New Deal\" was a carbon copy of a British Fabian Sociali st book. The fourth drive to Socialize America has come with the Clinton preside ncy. One of the \"greats\" of LID was Walter Reuther. But in typical Socialist fash- ion, Reuther chose to deny that he was a Socialist. In a \"Face the Nation\" inter- view in 1953, Reuther was pointedly asked about his Socialist background. He trotted out the standard Socialist excuse, \"...that I was when I was very young and very foolish, and I got out very quickly, for which I am very thankful.\" But the truth was far from that. Reuther had in fact served on a committee of the LID of which he had been a member since the early 1940s. I n 1949 he was an honored guest at a Fabian Socialist dinner party in London. LID members played a leading role in pushing Social ist programs through the Senate, and their effect on schools knew no bou ndaries. Theodore \"Ted\" Sorenson, who went on to be a key player in the Ken nedy administration, was a lifelong Socialist who got his appointment through LID's Senator Paul Douglas. Other United States Senators who had qualified in S ocialism with LID, were Senators Lehman, Humphrey, Neuberger and Morse (fro m \"conservative Oregon.\") To the list can be added Senators Jacob J avitts, and Philip Hart. Although they vigorously denied it to a man, in 195 0, former Attorney General Francis Biddle (a former chairman of Americans For Democratic Action (ADA) - successor to LID named them as known members of L ID and its successor, the ADA. An examination of Javitt's Senate voting record sho ws that he supported LID and ADA in 82 out of 87 Socialist measures on which he voted. Of Eastern European parents who settled on the lower East Side of New York in the garment district, Javitts joined LID in his early adult yea rs, and became one of LID's high- ly prized speakers, while staunchly denying any con nection with Socialism in his personal beliefs and connections with Socialist gro ups like LID. Never the less, Javitts was the keynote speaker at the 1952 LID-spo nsored seminar under the title, \"Needed, A Moral Awakening In America.\" \"Non Social ist,\" Walter Reuther, also attended the function which studiously avoided disc ussing corruption in labor while vigorously attacking employer-corporations an d businesses in general. Congressional Record Senate, October 1962, carried a long list of Socialists prominent in government, health, education, women's rights movement, religion, trade unions. The list contained the names of more than 100 professors and edu- cators from some of the nations' most prestigious c olleges and universities. The list named of more than 300 members and former memb ers of LID who had spread out and infiltrated every branch of governme nt, law, teaching, foreign pol- icy advisors, churches and so-called women's rights organizations. When LID underwent a name change to Americans For Democratic Action (ADA), many former LID members could be found in the ADA member ship list."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"52 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship The Inter-Collegiate Socialist Society (ISS), which preceded LID, opened doors to universities and gave opportunities to spr ead Socialist programs among impressionable students. It was the hidden Socialis t agenda that was to change the face of education in the United States. None of this was apparent at the birth of this Fabi an Socialist enterprise. The first ISS meeting was held at Peck's Restaurant in New York, on September 12, 1905. Those in attendance included Colonel Thomas W entworth, Clarence Darrow, Morris Hillquit and two young Socialist aut hors Upton Sinclair and Jack London. The two authors were enthusiastic Socialist s who went across the coun- try preaching the Fabian Socialist gospel at univer sities and Socialist clubs. Another notable of a somewhat rougher hew who atten ded the Peck's Restaurant dinner party was William Z. Foster, who went on to play a leading role in the Communist Party of the USA. Foster's love of Karl Marx had been amply demonstrated for a number of years. Not revealed un til 25 years later was the true purpose of the dinner party: It was in fact the fir st meeting of the American Fabian Society. Hillquit will best be remembered as the driving for ce behind the American Socialist Party formed in 1902. Two years later, th e Socialist Party gained 400,000 votes in the election — mostly from garment trade workers who had flocked to the United States from Russia in the ear ly 1890s, bringing with them an assorted gaggle of revolutionists and anarchists . Yet, in spite of its ugly revo- lutionary face, the Socialist Party of America attr acted an astonishing number of the elite from the top-drawers of New York society. But the Fabian Socialists in Britain advised caution — making haste so hastily w ould bring disaster and so it was that the \"party\" was quietly disbanded. As the London Fabian Society secretary Edward R. Pe ase put it: \"European countries with their great capitals have developed national brains. America, like the lower organisms, has ganglia for various purpos es in various parts of its gigantic frame.\" Pease was from the elite in the Fa bian Society who could not abide America, having never forgiven the Colonists for having inflicted so severe a defeat on the armies of King George III. In spite of this studied insult, a num- ber of prominent Americans went to London and signe d on with the Fabian Socialists. The long-range objectives of the British Fabian Soc iety relative to the United States had still to be defined and developed. A pre sident who would be wide-open to Socialist ideas had yet to be found and appointe d, so that the well concealed Socialist techniques of gaining power via the surre ptitious route could be imple- mented. As Ramsey McDonald had said, the United Sta tes would be very diffi- cult to Socialize — but not impossible. The main stumbling block was of course, the Constit ution. Coupled with that was the huge size of the country and the six differ ent racial groups with widely"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"What Socialism Is: Why it Leads to Slavery 53 diversified religious beliefs. Education and good p aying jobs, it was deemed, were two other hurdles that had to be surmounted. A s Webb put it, \"motherhood and apple pie\" stood in the way of the ambitious pr omoters of Socialism. London ordered the Socialist Party to disband and fade awa y to regroup under another name at a time better suited for its methods to gua rantee success. Forming a political party was not on the Socialist agenda. The ISS model of \"leagues\" and \"societies\" was to be followed. It wa s by subterfuge that they hoped to eventually co-opt existing political parti es, but never again would they try to form a party of their own. So in 1921,the Le ague of Industrial Democracy, (LID)and ISS was founded and it became the British Fabian Society's Socialist headquarters in the United States. One of the subtlest ways devised by American Social ists to hide their inten- tions and their tracks was to appoint Socialist pro fessors as presidential policy makers. The technique began with Wilson and has con tinued ever since. The pro- fessor policy makers seldom announced their agenda, instead wrote position papers which they signed. The position-papers had a strictly limited circulation, which kept the general public right out of the pict ure. Outside of the circle of professors were other nota bles who played a major role in the Wilson presidency. Of these, Walter Lippmann , stood head and shoulders above the rest. The British trained Fabian Socialis ts was ranked their No. I apostle in the United States, who, together with Mandel Hou se, had fashioned the \"14 points,\" the first attempt by an American president to shape a \"new world order.\" It is generally recognized that Wilson's war speech de livered to the Congress of the United States on April 6, 1917, rang down the curta in on old order, forcing the United States to take the first steps down the long Socialist to slavery. Wilson laid the foundation of lies on which America n Socialism was to be built. Americans are the most lied to people on ear th. Since Wilson came on the political scene, and of course, even before that, t he whole Socialist structure con- sisted of lies upon lies upon lies. One of the bigg est lies is that we belong to the United Nations. Others lies say abortion is legal, that school busing and so-called \"gun control\" is legal; GATT, NAFTA, the Gulf War, Waco, FEMA, \"King\" George Bushs' raid on Panama and kidnaping of its h ead of state and Mandela's rule of South Africa, are but the tip of an enormou s iceberg of layer upon layer of Socialist lies. Perhaps one of the more singular of its big lies is that Socialism strives to better the lot of the common people and, unlike cap italism, Socialists are not interested in personal wealth. Socialists are alway s preaching about the evils of capitalism. But a quick look at some of the leading Socialists quickly reveals that the leadership is drawn from the most elite element s of our society, people using Socialist causes to feather their own nests.

T he Delanos (Roosevelt mar- ried Sara Delano) made a fortune out of the opium t rade. One of Roosevelt's clos- est \"advisors,\" Bernard Baruch, and his partner had monopoly on the copper industry that enabled Baruch to make millions upon millions of dollars out of WWI, while the \"common man\" was dying by the millio ns in the mud and blood of the trenches in France. Roosevelt was on the board of the International Ban kers Association up to the time that he became Governor of New York. Durin g his tenure as a banker, he secured loans for European nations amounting to bil lions of dollars at a time when the American worker was struggling to pay off mortgages, and later during the depressions years, find a job. Roosevelt was a consummate Socialist liar, up there with the best of them. He didn't tell the Ame rican people that the money would go to bankers whose factories would churn out goods to sell on the American markets, thanks to the abolition of tariff barriers by his predecessor, Wilson. It is estimated that 12 million men lost th eir jobs thanks to the Wilson — Roosevelt assault on our trade barriers designed to protect American jobs. One glaring example out of thousands of Roosevelt b ig lies is found on pages 9832-9840, Congressional Record, Senate, May 25,193 5: \"...and owing to his announcement to the convention that he was for the Democratic platform 100 per- cent, it was hardly feasible that the people would understand if he immediately, with his subservient Congress, reduce the tariffs ( Customs duties on imported agricultural products and ancillary manufactured go ods) with 12 million men out of work.

Roosevel t made quite sure that the process of international banks lending billions to European powers to start wars was continued. According to documents made availabl e to me in the British Museum, Lord Beaverbrook, the great British Fabian Socialist, practically used the White House as his Washington office, showing R oosevelt how to pour bil- lions and billions of dollars into Germany to finan ce Hitler's rise to power. Wilson showed no scruples in placing openly-avowed Socialists in key posi- tions in his administration, from where they were a ble to do the maximum to advance the cause of Socialism in the United States . Fred C. Howe, one of the Wilson Socialist appointees was made Commissioner o f Immigration at New York. His favorite pastime was to release seditioni st and anarchists being held at the port of New York pending deportation. Another \"ex-officio\" House appointment was Walter L ippmann as secretary of a \"brain storm\" group put together to make up pl ausible war aims and reasons why the United States should get into WWI. It was L ippmann who invented the slogan, \"peace without victory,\" which became the b asis of the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The appointment of scandal monger Ray Stannard Baker as con- fidential correspondent to Wilson at the Treaty of Versailles talks, was another of those \"crucial appointments.\" It was said that Baker was chiefly responsible for making Wilson so depen- dent on the British Fabian Society that he was unab le to make any decisions of his own at the Paris Peace Conference, without firs t consulting Sydney Webb, founder of the Fabian Society, Graham Wallas, Bertr and Russell and George Lansbury. It was this group that constantly talked of Wilson's administration as a \"democratic\" administration. Baker's dispatches to Wilson in Washington, delib- erately referred to \"your democratic administration .\" The Paris Peace Conference foundered on the Constit ution. Some 59 enlight- ened Senators, fully aware of the intentions of the Socialist, refused to pass the League of Nations Treaty, recognizing it as a One W orld Government document that sought to put the League above the United Stat es Constitution. At that junc- ture, House is said to have told Sydney Webb that t he only was to get around the United States Constitution was to permeate all futu re United States administra- tions with key Socialists who would take a \"bi-part isan approach to matters of major consequence.\" Ever since those words were spo ken, \"bi-partisan approach\" became a euphemism for a Socialist approa ch to matters of vital con- sequence to the American people. In order to breathe life into the new \"bi-partisan\" idea, House held a dinner party at the Majestic Hotel in Paris on May 19, 191 9 for selected Fabianists and American Socialist.

The group said that to get around the United States Constitution, it would be necessary to set up an organization in the United S tates under the direction of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA). Th e American branch was to be called the \"Institute of International Affairs.\" It s mandate given by its London parent, was \"to facilitate the scientific study of international questions.\" The Fabian International Bureau was to act as advisors to both the RIIA and its American cousin, which, in 1921, changed its name t o 'The Council on Foreign Relations\" (CFR) These three institutions were set up with three mai n purposes in mind: 1. Do and end run around the United States Constitutio n. 2. To use these organizations to influence and deceive the United States Congress and the public. 3. To divide opposition to Socialist causes in the Hou se and Senate by the sub- terfuge of \"bi-partisan study committees.\" 4. Destroy the separation of powers between the leg islative, executive and judicial branches of government, as recommended by Professor Harold Laski. Mandel House was the originator of \"fireside chats, \" an essential propagan- da tool by widely used Roosevelt, and he \"suggested \" most of the Socialist cabi- net appointments. In many instances he consulted wi th Professor Charles W. Elliot of Harvard — that hotbed of Socialism which has played such a crucial, if secret, role in our history. This is not surprising , given the fact that Harvard was totally dominated by Fabian Socialist Harold Laski, whose frequent lectures at Harvard, set the tone for heavily Socialist leaning teaching methods. Much of the views held by House, appeared in the \"N ew Republic,\" a maga- zine much favored by American Socialists, including Wilson himself. House had many Socialist intimates among the Socialist Regist er. One of them, Joseph Fels, was prevailed upon by House to lend 500 English pou nds to Lenin and Trotsky on one occasion when they were stranded in London befo re they met with Lord Alfred Milner. Baruch once said, \"House has a hand in ever y cabinet appointment and all other important appointments.\" This was indeed an u nderstatement. It is believed that Wilson was fully aware of the a ctivities of Socialist Nina Nitze who served as the chief paymaster for German spies operating in the United States. That did not apparently bother Wilson or Ho use, any more than it was later to affect the judgment of Presidents Kennedy and Jo hnson, who appointed Nina's brother, Paul Nitze as Secretary of the Navy in bot h administrations and chief spokesman at various disarmament conference.

Telegrams sent by the German Ambassador in Washington to his home office superiors in Berlin, stated that from 1915, J. William Byrd Hale was one of their very own, being employed by the German Foreig n Office at a salary of $15,000 per annum. Hale, one of the inner circle at Turtle Bay, an exc lusive summer colony where- in resided the elite of the elite of American Socia lists. Among them were Professor Robert Lovett and a large number of other Harvard L aw School professors. House lived close by in Manchester. All were described by an adoring press of the time as \"polished products of Harvard and Groton,\" but the press was so blinded by these glamorous persons that it failed to state that they were also Socialists out of the top drawer of the Fabian-American Society. Lovett adore d the work of self-styled \"old school Communist\" John Ruskin, and William Morris. Hale, a dedicated \"Christian\" Socialist, made his m ark with Wilson in Mexico while orchestrating the theft of Mexican oil for his top Socialist col- leagues. (See \"Diplomacy By Deception\" for a full a ccount of this scandalous robbery of the Mexican people.) It transpired that Hale actually represented the German Foreign Office until June 23, 1918, this, wh ile thousands of American Citizen Militia soldiers were dying \"for the cause of freedom.\" Thereafter this \"Christian\" Socialist went to Germany as the corres pondent for the American Press Service. His much slanted, pro-Socialist repo rts figured prominently in newspapers of the period which can be found in the archives of the British Museum. Though these transactions the elite of the Socialis t world grew fat and sleek. Not that there was anything new in this disgusting arrangements. In the runup to the Civil War, and it was during its entirety, Comm unism and Socialism made huge strides in America, a fact not mentioned in ou r history books and kept well hidden from the public in the massive Hollywood ext ravaganzas about this, the must tragic of all wars."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"58 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorshi A common thread runs through the Fabian Socialist m ovement: a passionate desire to pull down and destroy everything. This is confirmed in pages 4594- 4595, Congressional Record, February 23, 1927, unde r the title \"General Deficiency Bill.\" This page in our history delineat es the Socialists and Communists and their efforts to tear down the Confe derated Republic of the United States of America. There is plenty of inform ation how the Socialists coop- erated with their Communist brothers, in the bookle t, \"Key Men of America.\" Socialism is world revolution much more than was Co mmunism, only at a slower pace and on a more sedate level. But the rev olution desired by the Socialists is the same: spiritual anarchy, destruction of nine teen centuries of Western civiliza- tion, scattering of traditions, and an end to Chris tianity. If this is doubted by the read- er, then a reading of Franklin D. Roosevelt's book, \"On Our Way\" will convince the skeptics that Socialism differs only from Communism in method. Bolshevism was the violent, radical experiment that tried to rid Russia of Christianity: In the United States, other more subt le means are being employed, such as banning of prayer in schools, the so called \"Separation of Church and State,\" and in the classrooms, where myriads of Soc ialist teachers are brainwash- ing students in a manner fit to promote the silent revolution the Socialist are car- rying out. Bolshevism, Marxism. Socialism, all have the same common purpose, and they go hand in hand with \"liberalism,\" \"pacifi sm,\" \"tolerance,\" \"progres- sive,\" \"moderate,\" \"peace,\" democratic,\" \"people's, \" and subterfuge issued to dissemble and disguise the true purposes of Sociali sm. These terms are intended to dupe the unwary so that Socialism not be asso- ciated with revolution. But the purpose of Socialis m and Bolshevism are the same: the destruction of civilization built upon ni neteen centuries of tradition and Christianity. The goals of Socialism are: 1. The abolition of government. 2. The abolition of patriotism. 3. The abolition of property right. (While the Communi sts would banish it out- right, the Socialist choose the stealthy sneaking c ourse of taxing private property rights out of existence. 4. The abolition of inheritance. (Again, the Communist s would banish it out- right, the Socialist by means of inheritance tax la ws). 5. Abolition of marriage and the family. 6. Abolition of religion, especially Christianity. 7. Destruction of national sovereignty of countries an d national patriotism. Woodrow Wilson knew of these aims, yet he did not r ecoil from them nor from becoming a tool of the international Socialist s, embracing American Socialist programs with enthusiasm, for which he ne eded powers not granted to him by the United States Constitution. Wilson was n ot averse to using the sly"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"What Socialism Is: Why it Leads to Slavery 59 methods of Socialist to attain his goals. For insta nce, he was successful in getting the United States into WWI by classifying it as a \" patriotic duty\" to defend America, which was never at any time threatened by Germany! Wilson was not the first power-hungry president, al though he was the first openly Socialist one. The dubious distinction of po wer-grabbing belongs to President Lincoln who was the first to come out wit h proclamations, now called Executive Orders. President George Bush followed ri ght along in Roosevelt's foot- steps, using the same unconstitutional methods to f eather his nest, diving into every cesspool where there was money to be made at the co st of the American people. A so-called \"Republican, \"Bush did as much to harm the \"common people\" of the United States as Roosevelt had done, and Wil son had done before him. Beware of party labels. George Washington called po litical parties \"baneful and unnecessary\" and modern history shows them to be di visive. Tyrants have suc- ceeded because of political parties and their \"divi de and rule\" mentality. The Constitution of the United States provides for impe achment of men like Wilson, Roosevelt and Bush. In fact, patriotic Congressman Henry Gonzalez filed six Articles of Impeachment against Bush during the Gul f War, but partisan politics stood in the way of the Article 2, Section 4, Artic le 1, Section 3, being used to bring George Bush to justice. There were a multitude of causes to impeach Bush, n ot the least being his failure to adhere to the Constitution and obtain a properly-drawn up declaration of war. Next, his unconstitutional forgiveness of E gypt's debt of $7 billion, his bribery of Syria and other nations who joined his \" Desert Storm\" against the nation of Iraq: His continued misuse of all three b ranches of the services in vio- lation of the Constitution, and calling himself the commander in chief of the armed services, which he was not, is also impeachab le. It is worth repeating that the Gulf War was illegal . It was fought without a declaration of war in defiance of the Constitution. Congress, largely conditioned by party sentiments, tried to write up a type of re solution — not a declaration of war — that purported to give the semblance of legal ity to Bush's action. But Congress added insult to injury to the American peo ple in that they made the mis- take of writing up their version of a declaration o f war in consonance with the United Nations mandate given Bush, and not in conso nance with the Constitution of the United States. This was absolutely wrong: The United States never constitutionally joined the United Nations and a declaration of war by this One World Government body CANNOT be on the same instrument or even associated with a declaration of war by the Congress. Article 1, Section 9 of the United States Constitution denies and or limits the power of Congress to legislate.

An analysis of the way Congress vo ted shows dramatically, that almost to a man, the hundreds of Socialists infesti ng the House and Senate voted for Bush to allow Bush to continue his flouting of the Constitution. Bush should have been impeached and tried. If the Constitution were followed in such pro- ceedings, there is no doubt that he would have been jailed, as he rightly deserves. The powers of the president are contained in Sectio n II of the United States Constitution. Actions not in Section II are exercis es of arbitrary power. The Socialists, starting with House, Frankfurter and Br andeis, and followed by Katzenbach et al, have it that the three branches o f government are coequal. This is a falsehood-just another of the lies that go to make up the huge iceberg upon which this nation will be wrecked unless we alter c ourse. Professor Harold Laski was the chief instigator of this lie, viewed as the first step toward weakening the separation of powers as mandated by the United Stat es Constitution. The three branches of government are not co-equal a nd never have been. The House and Senate created the judicial branch, and t he House and Senate never intended to give them equal powers. Of course if th is ever became known, the Socialist outflanking of the Constitution \"by the l egislative route\" would be thrown out of the window. Perhaps the American peop le will wake up to the way in which judges gerrymander the Constitution before it is too late. Congress has superior powers — one of which is thro ugh the purse. Another, simple way to get rid of Socialist judges is to enf orce Article III, Section I which says that judges may not \"receive for their service s, a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in offic e.\" What this means is that U.S. Supreme Court judges c annot by law be paid in debased money, and a better example of debased \"mon ey\" is Federal Reserve notes, commonly (and mistakenly) called \"dollars\" i s not to be found. What a blow it would be to the inheritors of the Kelley do ctrine if We, the People, closed the Supreme Court down for lack of money that is no t debased. Wilson should likewise have been impeached. His mad grab for power was at the instigation of Mandel House, the arch-Social ist enemy of the people of the United States who worked in the dark his sinister, scurrilous, evil plans to over- turn and destroy the Confederated Republic of the U nited States of America. To this end House had Wilson appoint all manner of eli te Socialists to key positions. The goals of American Socialism have been well conc ealed in the past, par- ticularly in the period leading up to WWII. That So cialism has achieved many of its objectives is clear. They did it by the formati on of movements designed to break down the morals of America, as witness the st artling growth of \"free love\" (love without responsibility) which has thus far co st the lives of more than 26 mil- lion murdered babies sanctioned by the Supreme Cour t's pro-abortion rulings, all"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"What Socialism Is: Why it Leads to Slavery 61 100 percent unconstitutional, as the Constitution i s silent on abortion. Where the Constitution is silent on a power, it is a prohibit ion of that power. President Clinton is a firm believer in infanticide and like the good Socialist he is, supports abortion with all of the might of h is administration. It is interest- ing that the first time abortion clinics were thoug ht of was when Mrs. Laski, wife of Professor Laski of the Fabian Society began to e stablish birth control clinics in England. Mrs Laski's tactics employed the methods o f the notorious Communist commissar, Comrade Alexandra Kollontay. When Socialists are confronted and exposed in advan cing the cause of Communism by different tactics, they protest loudly . But the old saying, \"wound a Communist and a Socialist bleeds\" was never truer than it is today. What we have in the United States is a secret, upper-level parallel Socialist government known as the Council on Foreign Relations that was set up in 1919 by arch- Socialists Mandel House and Walter Lippmann, under the direction and control of the RIIA in London. Many times we see stories in the press about open d isagreement between Communists and Socialists. This is done to deceive the unwary and keep in line those who have been duped into believing that \"prog ressive,\" \"liberal,\" \"moder- ate\" really mean something other than what their So cialists meaning is. Thus they are able to keep in line a vast number of people wh o would otherwise recoil in shock if they knew they were promoting the aims of world revolutionary govern- ment. That our new president, accused of being a ph ilanderer, a libertine lacking in morals, is acceptable to millions of Americans w ho are not Socialist, is a tri- umph for the methods of Fabian Socialism. Their methods are so subtle that their goals are no t always at first recognized . Lately there has been much discussion (much of it o f low caliber showing the pauci- ty of an understanding of the United Constitution a mong the majority of senators) about Line Item Veto supposedly the right of the pr esident. This is pure Socialist anti constitutional propaganda, and a continuation of the process started by the Socialists during the Wilson presidency of surrende ring the rights that properly belong to the legislature to the president. It is t he goal of the Socialists to give the president powers that he has not got, nor is entitl ed to, so that they can proceed to steamroller the Constitution out of the way of thei r New World Order plans. The Socialists want the president to have veto powe rs not granted by the Constitution in so-called \"enhanced rescission.\" In typical Socialist fashion, they do not come right out and say \"we want the president t o be able to veto any parts of a bill that has passed the House and Senate.\" This is what is meant by line item veto. This subterfuge follows Florence Kelley's directive that changes must be ear- ried out, \"by the legislative route\" if they cannot be done by constitutional means.

Laski frequently lashed out at this stumbling block to promoting Socialism, via \"t he legislative route.\" The shocking hypocrisy of the Socialists is revealed in their insistence on the so-called \"separation of church and state\" idea being strictl y enforced. Apparently, what is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander. To turn this kind of power over to the president is an act of suicide — and quite possibly, treason. The real issue here is pow er, and how the Socialist can grab more and more of it via a servant of theirs wh om they place in the White House. There is nothing more dangerous than the Soc ialist drive to turn over to the president powers reserved to the House and Sena te.This would produce super Wilsons, Roosevelts, Bushs and Clintons and rush th e United States headlong into a Socialist dictatorship — which we practically hav e already. Line item veto powers would become a party politics wrangle, intimidate the lawmakers whom the people of the States have return ed to Washington to do the bidding of the people of the States — not the Feder al Government. Line item veto surrender of Congressional powers will ensure futur e tyrants even worse than George Bush whose private war for and behalf of the British crown, cost the lives of hundreds of Americans and $200 billion. Line ite m veto powers for the presi- dent would be a great triumph for Florence Kelley. Line item veto powers for the president would throw the House and Senate into confusion, paralyze their efforts and generall y hasten a breakdown of gov- ernment in this country — all declared Socialist ai ms. Tensions and passions between the legislative branches would boil over an d make Congress totally sub- servient to a belligerent president hell-bent on fo llowing the Socialist agenda. It would make of the Constitution of the United States a blank piece of paper, with checks and balances reduced to a smoking ruin. This nation has suffered far too much already from Socialist excesses of presi- dents they have installed (Wilson, Roosevelt, Kenne dy, Johnson, Carter, Eisenhower, Bush and Clinton.) These presidents have rushed the nation into deadly wars in which we should never have become embroiled, at the cost of millions upon millions of lives, not to mention the billions of dollars th ese wars generated, billions that went to the Wall Street and City of London bankers, the Bank of International Settlements, the World Bank etc., for which the people are still being taxed. Line item veto powers plus the illegal so-called Ex ecutive Orders will make a future tyrant-president of the caliber of Rooseve lt and Bush a king, as surely as if the title had been bestowed upon them. To give t he president constitutional power to line items veto bills of congress would re quire an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

There were 87 people mu rdered at Waco. The Tienenman Square \"massacre\" (a Socialist media desc ription of the event) killed 74 Chinese. Yet Clinton was prepared to cross sword s with China over its \"human rights\" violations occasioned by the Tienenman Squa re uprising against the Beijing government, but thus far has done nothing t o bring the perpetrators of Waco to justice. This is typical of the gross hypoc risy of a true Socialist. Where in the United States Constitution does it say that the Federal Govemment has the right to rush into the States and persecute a religious group? It is not there! The Federal Government has no busi ness meddling in the States, especially when it comes to police powers. The 10th Amendment is perfectly clear on this: police powers in health, education a nd police protection, belong exclusively to the States. If the Branch Davidians had perchance committed any crime that warranted police action against them, th at action should have been take by the local police and no one else. The Sheriff's Department at Waco failed lam- entably in its duty to protect the Davidians inside their church properly. The Federal Government once again displayed its arr ogant attitude toward the United States Constitution by violating Article 1 of the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution which states: \"Congress shall make no law respecting the establis hment of religion or pro- hibit the free exercise thereof; or abridging the f reedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of people to peacefully assemble, and to petition the government for redress of grievance.\" What happened at Waco was th at the Federal Government took powers it does not have and went to Waco with the express intention of pro- hibiting the free exercise of religious beliefs and freedom of expression. This is secular humanism in action which has no place in ou r Constitution. The Socialists are very hot on \"separation of church and state\" — when it suits their book. What happened to \"separation of church and state\" at Wac o? It was not there! The Federal Government decided it could simplify re ligion, which is a com- plex subject that defies simplification. On page E7 151, Congressional Record, House, July 31, 1968, Justice Douglas put the matte r this way; \"...It is impossible for government to draw a line between good and bad (the secular humanism nostrum) and to be true to the Con stitution, better to let such ideas alone.\" Instead of listening to its own Socia list judges, the Federal govern- ment decided it has the right to decide between a \" good\" religion and a \"bad\" one. Government agents on the ground at Waco took it upo n themselves to oversim- plify the complexity of religion. Experience throug h the centuries has shown that religion cannot be simplified. Moreover it lies out side of political issues and it was never supposed to be simplified. The first 10 Amendments of the United States Consti tution are a restriction"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"64 One World Order: Socialist Dictators on the Federal Government. In addition, Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution denies the Federal Government any righ t to pass legislation on reli- gious matters. The Primary powers of the House and Senate are found in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 1-18. Remember, the Federal Go vernment has no absolute powers. The Federal Government has zero right to de cide what is a church and what is a cult. Apparently, government agents on th e ground at Waco, made this determination with the assistance of a \"cult deprog rammer\" of one kind or anoth- er. The whole idea of such action is repulsive, not to mention downright illegal. For the Federal Government to have this power — whi ch it does not — would be to grant it all power to destroy any and a ll religions — a plank in the Socialist program and one of the goals of world rev olution. This power is not in the First Amendment to the United States Constituti on, nor is it found under the delegated powers of Congress or of the primary powe rs of Congress in Article 1, Section 8, Clauses 1-18. When the United States Con stitution is silent on a power, it is a prohibition of that power. So where did the FBI and the ATF get their power th at allowed them to attack a Christian church? Apparently from the President a nd the Attorney General, nei- ther of whom has such powers, and, since they both admit responsibility for the dreadful deed at Waco, they ought properly to be im peached. More Americans died at Waco than did Chinese students at Tienenman Square. Did the jackal press of the United States call the Chinese students a \"c ult?\" Of course not. Neither does the Federal Government have the right to call a Christian movement a \"cult.\" The United States Constitution was compromised by t he actions of the Federal Government at Waco. The United States Const itution cannot be compro- mised. No government agency is above the Constituti on, and the Federal Government agencies that took part in the Waco atta ck broke the law. They had no constitutional right to intervene in a matter th at fell within the purview of the State of Texas, it was not in the purview of the Fe deral Government. The Federal Government talked of the Branch Davidian as \"terror ists,\" but should not have had any say in making such a delineation. That was for the State of Texas to do. Nowhere in the Bill of Rights has the Federal Gover nment the authority to call a Christian church a \"terrorist\" organization. Authority for the attack at Waco is not found in Article 1, Section 8, Clauses 1-18 . It would have taken a CON- STITUTIONAL AMENDMENT to a Dow the Federal Governme nt to launch an armed attack on the Branch Davidian Church at Waco.

Articles of impe achment are urgently necessary. The Congress has to take most of the blame. The Fed eral agents who took part in the storming of the Branch Davidian Church, probabl y thought they were acting under authority of the law, when they were not. Con gress is supposed to know this, and Congress is supposed to correct the situa tion, lest it be perpetuated some- where else. Birch Bayh, Socialist former Senator fr om Indiana, was used by the Fabian Society to undermine the Constitution of the United States, and he did so at every opportunity, as a reading of pages S16610- S16614, Congressional Record, Senate clearly establishes. Where does it say in Article 1, Section 8 or the de legated powers of Congress that the Federal Government has the power to use mi litary vehicles to attack a church? Where does it say that Federal agents are e mpowered to call a church a \"cult?\" This attack on the Christian Church Branch Davidian is a violation of the 1st, 4th and 5th Amendments and is a bill of attain der of United States citizens at Waco. Neither the Legislative, Executive or Judicia l branches of the Federal Government has the right to call a Christian church — nor for that matter, any church simply by calling it a \"cult.\" Since when ha s the Federal Government had the power to decide on these complex religious matt ers? Since when can the Federal Government exercise a Bill of Attainder? What the Federal Government did at Waco was take a complex religious mat- ter and turn it into a simple matter of a \"cult\" it did not like. The Executive Branch in Article II of the United States Constitution has no power to attack what the President and his Attorney General called \"a cult.\" This is not the first time that the Federal Government has launched an attack on a religious group it did not like. It is no excuse to simply say that the Presid ent and his Attorney General take the responsibility for breaking the law. On pages 1195-1209, Congressional Record, Senate Fe bruary 16, 1882, we see that the Senate tried to act like God in appoin ting a five-man commission to prevent Mormons from voting simply because they wer e Mormons. This was a gross violation of a bill of attainder. The only sa ving grace about this ugly piece of history is that there was a debate in the Senate . The victims of the Federal Government at Waco had no such right. On the effort s to block the Mormons from voting and we find it on page 1197 — and this is hi ghly relevant to the Waco attack, we read, 'That right belonged to American c ivilization and law long before the Constitution was adopted.\" This right existed in colonial times, like the righ t to bear arms, and these rights were made a part of the Constitution through a seri es of amendments, in addition to those in the original instrument. These stood for t he protection of rights. They were merely a guarantee of rights that already existed b efore the Constitution, which was not the creator of the rights itself.

The citi- zens who died in the blaze at Waco were not given t heir Constitutional rights to a fair trail and due process of law as stated in the 5th Amendment. Continuing to read from the Congressional Record, S enate, February 16, 1882, on page 1200: \"For example no one, we presume , will contend that Congress can make any law in a Territory respecting the establishment of religion, or free exercise of, or abridge freedom of speech o r of the press, or the right of the people of the Territory peaceably to assemble, and petition the government for redress of grievances. Nor can Congress deny to the people the right to keep and bear arms, nor the right to a trial by jury, nor co mpel anyone to be a witness against himself in criminal proceedings. These powe rs, in relation to the rights of person, which are not necessary here to enumerate, are in express and positive terms denied the General Government; and the right to private property have to be guarded with equal care.\" What happened at Waco was unhindered Socialism in a ction, grossly flout- ing the United States Constitution. Since it is cle ar that neither the Congress (House and Senate) nor the Judicial branch, nor the Executive Branch (The President) had any Constitutional rights whatsoever to order an armed attack on the Branch Davidian Church at Waco, the next questi on is, what is the Congress doing about righting this gross violation of the Co nstitution and what is it doing to bring the guilty among the Federal Government to justice?\" In a Socialist/Marxist state, Waco would have been merely an exercise of government power. But the United States, thanks to its Constitution is not a Socialist/Marxist state; it remains a Confederated republic, notwithstanding the horrendous assaults upon it by the likes of Fabian Socialists Harold Laski, Felix Frankfurter, Hugo Black, Franklin Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, George Bush, and now, President William Jefferson Clinton. Waco was a cynical exercise of powers not granted to the Judicial or Executive bra nches of government and appears on a level with the excesses of the past co ncerning religious intolerance. Getting back to the attempts by Socialists to trans fer powers from one branch of government to another. Even without Line Item Ve to powers, we already had a king instead of a president. I refer to \"King\" Ge orge Bush, whose lust for power begat more power and more power until the nation wa s carried away on the flood tide of his mad power grab and landed in a war that was as unconstitutional as any in the history of the United States. What has been entirely lost in the debate in the Ho use and Senate as to whether to \"give\" the president such power is that being 100 percent unconstitu- tional, it would require an amendment to the United States Constitution. The Congress (House and Senate) does not have the autho rity to grant the president line item veto powers: This cannot be done by the C ongress but only by way of a Constitutional amendment."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"What Socialism Is: Why it Leads to Slavery 67 The Founding Fathers meant to prevent the Constitut ion being circumvented by the three departments passing powers back and fo rth.

This was meant to stop power-mad Socialist like Wilson, Roosevelt, Bush from rushing the count ry into one war after anoth- er, but even that did not stop power mad Wilson, Ro osevelt and Bush from doing just that. Clinton awaits his chance to start another war. He narrowly missed out against North Korea, but his turn may yet come befo re his single term comes to an end. Line Item Veto power is another step toward the Socialist goal of \"mak- ing the United States Constitution of no effect.\" T he Constitutional power of the president is found in Section II of the United Stat es Constitution. He has no other power. The Fabian Society carried on the war that was lost by the armies of King George III. They provoked the Civil War and all war s since then, in the hope of toppling the Confederate Republic of the United Sta tes. The Annals of Congress, Congressional Globes and Congressional Record provi de a wealth of information and detail to confirm this opinion. On page 326, Co ngressional Globe, House, July 12, 1862, we find a speech by the Hon. F.W. Ke llogg, \"Origin of the Rebellion:\" \"National pride has been gratified, also the increa se of power, and the certain knowledge that in a half of a century more, the Uni ted States must be by far the most powerful nation on the globe. But the great po wers of Europe have wit- nessed rapid growth with uneasiness; and defend Ame rica, which was never at any time threatened by the Germans!\" The mischief done by modern day American Socialists is tremendous. Jacob Javitts saw in what he called \"civil rights issues\" a golden opportunity to stir the racial waters by infiltrating Socialists in such ke y government bodies as the Equal Opportunity Commission. On the international scene, Javitts, using scare tactics at which Socialists are so good, was responsible fo r establishing so-called \"international banks\" and then getting Congress to fund them in an utterly uncon- stitutional manner. Another big promoter of Socialism in this country w as Judge Abe \"Fixer\" Fortas, who more than any other Socialist was respo nsible for \"legalizing\" a flood of obscene literature and pornography. This was des igned to further weaken the morality of the nation. Fortas cast the deciding vo te on the U.S. Supreme Court's 100 percent wrong decision to allow pornography und er the guise of \"freedom of speech.\" We are told by psychologists and psychiatr ists that this led directly to a huge increase in crime as this kind of \"entertainme nt\" titillates the lower brain centers."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"68 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship House and Senate members must bear their share of t he blame for this and the shocking rise of unemployment and crime in tand em.

Some of these, an d other Socialist \"war- riors\" will be found in the chapters, \"Stars in the Socialist Firmament,\" with an account of their deeds. Their plans and aims were to slowly, insidiously, i nduce the United States to adopt Socialism, in easy stages that would not be n oticed by the people. The pro- gram was one worked out by the Fabian Society of Lo ndon, as detailed by their lead players, Professor Laski, Graham Wallas and Ke nneth Galbraith. These plans were laid out in such a manner as to coincide or do vetail with what \"Liberals\" were doing in America, especially in the fields of education, undermining the United States Constitution, the American system of political economy based upon sound money and trade protection tariffs. These largely coincided with the International Soci alist plans for an eventu- al One World Government — New World Order. For the Fabians of England to adjust their plans to an American timetable was a b ig undertaking. How success- ful they were can be measured in terms of the fact that between the 1920s and 1930, they almost succeeded in totally Socializing the United States."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Socialist-Controlled Education: The Road to Slavery 69 3 SOCIALIST-CONTROLLED EDUCATION: THE ROAD TO SLAVERY The one sector of life in the United States that ha s been completely co-opted by Fabian Socialism, is education. Perhaps in no ot her of their fields of endeavor to Socialize America did their indirect, stealthy, furtive methodology succeed nearly as much as it did in Fabian Socialism's long march to capture the educa- tional system of this nation. The Socialists took o ver Yale, Harvard, Columbia and many other colleges, held to be of direct service t o Socialism. They were to be the future educational centers and \"finishing schools\" for Socialists in America as Oxford and Cambridge are for the Fabian Society in England. In these universities were developed a layer of top -level elite educators whose ties to British Fabianism were strong. Among the to p in this elite group was Walter Lippmann and John Reed, who is buried in the walls of the Kremlin in Moscow. Socialist pressure on education expanded with Lefti st/Socialist professors threaten- ing to give conservative students failing grades fo r giving wrong answers — wrong whenever they clashed with Fabian Socialist ideas. In this manner have traditional American Christian conservative views undergone a t errible erosion. An enquiry lasting two years (1962-1964) in one California sch ool district, showed the self- same pressures operating in classrooms staffed with Socialist teachers, as was in use in universities across the nation. Parents were rel uctant to complain, because in instances where complaints were filed with the scho ol board, their children received bad grades and loss of credits. As far back as the visit to the United States by Ra msay McDonald, the Fabian Socialists in London knew that a frontal ass ault on education in the United States was out of the question. At one of the most memorable of many Socialist meetings held in New York in 1905, at Peck's Restau rant, the Intercollegiate Socialist Society (ISS) was formed. This was the br idgehead that was to give the Fabian Socialist in America a highway into educatio n."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"70 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship The man the Fabian Society selected for the job of Socializing education in America, was John Dewey, Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University, New York. Dewey became known as the father of progressi ve (Socialist) education, identified with Marxist bodies such as the League o f Industrial Democracy (LID), of which he was a president. Dewey first came to th e notice of the Socialist hier- archy while teaching at the Lincoln School of Teach ers College, a hotbed of Marxist-Liberalist education, supported by the Gene ral Education Board. It was here that Dewey met Nelson Aldrich and David Rockefeller. Of the two, Dewey reportedly said that David was completel y Socialized, committing to its philosophies wholeheartedly. The Un-American Co mmittee cited Dewey as belonging to 15 Marxist-front organizations. A few years later, Rockefeller rewarded Dewey by making him Governor of New York a nd a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Although Dewey went on to occupy most- ly political positions, it was his indoctrination o f Nelson and David Rockefeller into Socialisms and Marxism that did the most damag e, as millions upon millions of dollars were thereafter donated to fighting \"rel igious clause\" school cases in the Supreme Court and undermining education and inf ecting America's school system with the Socialist virus. The 10th Amendment of the United States Constitutio n reserves the police powers of education, health and police protection t o the States. The powers of the Federal Government are powers delegated by the Stat es. The first 10 Amendments to the United States Constitution are a prohibition of power, one of the strictest being that education is a matter for the States. Until they were able to make progress via the legis lative route as Florence Kelley (real name Weschnewetsky) had stated, the Am erican Fabian Socialists had to go about undermining education in the United States in a typically Fabian Socialist way. The Intercollegiate Socialist Societ y (ISS) meeting at Peck's Restaurant was the first slow step taken to penetra te and permeate education with- out disclosing the direction it was to go. When we look back to the seemingly slow, almost halting formation of the ISS, it is ha rd to believe that the very same American Fabian Socialist movement who formed, it a re today galloping along, dragging our education system along with them by th e hair of its head. There were others who thought just like Justice Dou glas, Felix Frankfurter, Frank Murphy, William J. Brennan, Arthur Goldberg, Justice Hugo Black and Abe Fortas. In addition to being ardent Socialists, Douglas, Murphy and Brennan were high-ranking Freemasons. It was during the tim e 1910-1930 that the Supreme Court began taking an untoward interest is so-called \"religious clause\" school education case, from which it had shied away from at least for two decades. This was the era when the most damage was done to the American edu- cation system, enabling Socialism to make huge inro ads which previously seemed to be out of the question."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Socialist-Controlled Education: The Road to Slavery 71 While the Supreme Court had outlawed religious educ ation — especially prayers from schools — their Masonic brethren had b een very successful in pen- etrating and permeating schools with Socialist Maso n literature. In 1959, Franklin W. Patterson persuaded the principal of a high scho ol in Baker, Oregon, to use Socialist-oriented text books in the school. The sa me thing happened in North Carolina were Socialist-Masonic literature was dist ributed in every classroom of every school in Charlotte. As House Banking Committee chairman, Louis T. McFad den said: \"In the matter of education the Fabian Illuminati h ave followed a theory which is none other than that suggested by the soul s of Bavarian Illuminism, Nicolai, in the eighteenth century. Having secured posts in the school boards of the country, it became very easy for the Fabian Soc ialists to instill their educa- tional, de-Christianized principles in the school c urriculum. Their attack on reli- gious teaching was subtle but deadly, as seen in th e Education bill of 1902.\" 'They boast openly of having in their ranks several bishops and divines, the list being headed by Bishop Headlam, one of the ear liest Fabians...Under Fabian educational schemes come the formation of the educa tional groups of the 'nurs- ery,' the latter designed as a kind of a training s chool for very young prospective Socialists. (Then Governor Clinton of Arkansas mode led his Socialist \"Governor's School\" along these lines)...But by far the most important steps taken by the Fabians along educational lines was th eir inauguration in existing universities of 'Universities Socialist Societies.' ...The culminating triumph of the Fabians in the realm of education was the creation of the London School of Economics and Political Science at the London Unive rsity, where today one of the chief lecturers is the Socialist, Harold Laski. ..\" One can say of Socialist plans that they infected t he realm education with a virus that they hoped would spread and radically ch ange our social order. This \"virus\" would get into the spinal cord of \"social s tudies\" and \"social sciences\" turning all studies in a leftward direction. This w as the basic premise of the National Education Association set forth in their 1 4th Year Book in 1936, from which position the Socialist educators have never w avered: \"We stand for Socializing the individual.\" In pursuance of this, in the 1920s the Socialists w ho swarmed over the United States like a cloud of locusts were intent u pon carrying out as many of the ideas written up in the Communist Manifesto of 1848 , embodied in legislation pertaining to education. They hoped to circumvent t he constitution by what Florence Kelley called \"legislative action.\" On pag es 4583-4604, Congressional Record, Feb. 23,1927, under the title \" General Def iciency Appropriation Bill, we find their methods exposed. \"...The Communist group s must show children how to convert secret hate and pent-up anger into a con scious struggle...Most impor- tant is the struggle against the tyranny of school discipline.\""},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"72 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship John Dewey and his disciples tried to limit the lea rning of vocabulary in schools, knowing as they did that the depth of educ ation is commensurate with one's vocabulary. Children should be taught vocabulary, e ven if it is only taught straight out of a dictionary. All government job applicants ought to be obliged to pass an English vocabulary test, and this could be extended to State job applicants. Even wel- fare applicants should be obliged to take a profici ency test in vocabulary in the English language. This would negate the effect of S ocialism in education, and thwart Socialism's aim of turning out a mediocre majority of children who will grow up to become mediocre adults, \"pushovers\" for swallowing a diet of Socialism. Another specialist tactic is to waste the Nations' substance through irrespon- sible spending so that \"destructive\" becomes the or der of the day. This has the effect of steadily raising higher education fees. W e see the cumulative effect of John Maynard Keynes policies in the number of stude nts who are not going to college, and those who drop out as fees get too muc h for them to pay. In this way, the number of students with future leadership quali ties is diminished, by intent and by design. The general thrust of Socialist \"education\" is to k eep intelligence to a mini- mum wherever possible, while promoting mediocrity. Of course this does not apply to their own chosen future leadership who are selected out of the best and brightest Socialists and sent to the \"finishing sch ool\" at Oxford as Rhodes schol- ars. An excellent reference to education as a means of confounding Communism and Socialism, is found In the Congressional Record , House, June 26, 1884 on page 336, Appendix thereto: \"I believe the sheet anchor of our form of governme nt is intelligence, hence I am an earnest advocate of popular education.\" Dan iel Webster uttered this sen- timent of which history has demonstrated the truth when he said, 'it is intelligence that has reared the majestic columns of our nationa l glory, and this also can pre- vent them from crumbling into ashes.' The spread of intelligence is to be the Government — it will be not only protection against centralization of political and financial power on one hand, but our sure and s afe defense against Communism, nilhism and revolutionary tendencies on the other.\" \"While ours was a comparatively frontier population , with sturdy self- reliance and individuality as a common characterist ic, our dangers were not many, but with a dense population, accumulated wealth, an d comparative effeminacy, new perils arise, and we must depend upon education and intelligence to counter these as far as possible, for, 'as thou so west so shall thou reap' applies to States as well as to men.

It also shows up in the cleare st possible light why the Socialists feel so compelled to take charge of educ ation for their own sinister pur- poses, and why the likewise feel the need to negate Christianity. It is clear that morality, education and religion go hand-in-hand, a nd the Socialists know it. The Socialists managed to get one of their most imp ortant protagonists, Hugo Lafayette Black on the bench of the Supreme Co urt. Black, a Unitarian (Godless) church member and a Freemason, should nev er have been confirmed, because it broke all Senate rules. The serious situ ation posed by Black's nomina- tion was raised by Senators William Borah (R.ID) an d Warren Austin (R.NH). They pointed out that Black was constitutionally in eligible because he was a member of Congress when it enacted legislation rais ing the salary of Supreme Court Judges, and in consequence, he could not be p romoted to a post that paid more money than he received as a member of Congress . The Constitution is perfectly clear on this point: \"No Senator or Representative shall, during the time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments where of shall have incr eased during such time.\" At the time of Black's nomination he was paid $109,000 as a member of Congress, while the Justices salaries were raised to $20,000 a year. Yet, in spite of this clear violation of the law, Roosevelt's Attorney General, Homer Cummings, ruled that Black's appointment to the Supreme was legal! The Socialists-Masonics alliance needed Black on th e Supreme Court because they knew that he was sympathetic to their cause an d would always rule in their favor on \"religious clause\" education cases, and their fa ith in Black was amply rewarded. Black was in league with Samuel Untermeyer, Schofie ld, Gunnar Myrdal, Justices Earl Warren and Louis D. Brandeis, Roosevelt and Fl orence Kelley who were all working to bring education under the control of Soc ialism. The supreme and organic law of the land is the law based upon the Christian Bible's teachings. By failing to obey it, the U.S. Supreme Court is in a state of transgression. Modern education, on the basis of Su preme Court rulings has bro- ken Biblical law. Schools and colleges have become the most dangerous places to leave our youth unsupervised and unattended. One of the ways in which the Socialists obtained the upper-hand was the non-reco gnition of religious schools - and especially Catholic schools. Here, the services of the illegally appointed Justi ce Hugo Black were invalu- able in ruling against cases brought under the so-c alled \"religious clause\" by the enemies of the Constitution of United States. Black , known to be militantly anti- Catholic and anti-church school education in genera l, followed slavishly Masonic \"principles\" in his court rulings, in fact most of them were taken direct from Mason literature. The most noteworthy \"principles\" which on which Black based his rulings, were:"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"74 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship Principal No. l \"Public school education for all of the children of all of the people.\" Principal No. 5 'The entire separation of Church an d State, and opposition to every attempt to appropriate public moneys, directl y or indirectly, for the support of sectarian or private institutions.\" As we shall see in the chapters dealing with corruption of the Constitution, within two years of Black's nomination, the Supreme Court took a huge lurch to the Left and dec lared unconstitutional State funding of religious schools, on the utterly false premise of Jefferson's Bill for Religious Freedom, which was not in the Constitutio n, but restricted to Virginia. That is how the \"wall of separation of Church and S tate,\" came to be born, total- ly unconstitutional based on deception and outright fraud. The issue of \"federal\" aid for religious schools wa s raised again by Representative Graham Barden back in 1940. Barden w as a Socialist- Freemason, and as we proceed, we shall see just how well Masonry and Socialism have combined to wreck education in Ameri ca. The intention of the Barden bill was control over schools so that Social ism could be freely taught. This was confirmed by Dr. Cloyd H. Marvin, presiden t of George Washington University in a letter dated May 11, 1944, addresse d to the House Committee on World War Veterans. What Burden was striving to do was to eliminate the right of war veterans to attend theological seminar ies, especially, Catholic sem- inaries, if they so chose. Barden had attended the Fabian Conference of Representatives of Educational Associations in 1941 , which conference was a tool of both Freemasonry and Socialism. According to Dr. Marvin, there should not be any pr ivate schools, because in his words, \"we cannot maintain two systems to inter fere with regular education policies.\" This was one of the clearest cases on re cord of Masonry as the driving force behind the Conference of Representatives of E ducational Association. While ostensibly the bill under discussion was prim arily about the G.I. bill, nev- ertheless its ramifications were very wide, because Rep. Barden attempted to put private religious schools out of bounds for those v eterans who were attending col- lege on the \"G.I. bill.\" Dr. Marvin was no ordinary educator. He was a longt ime Socialists and 33rd degree Mason. At George Washington University he wa s able to exert a powerful influence because of the grant of $100,000 he recei ved from the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. Marvin found a friend in Justice Hugo Black, who owed his Supreme Court position to the Masons. After he left the Senate, the Socialists got Black's Senate seat filled by Lister Hill of Alabam a, a regular Socialist crusader and staunch Mason. For years, Hill was able to bloc k federal funding for private schools, especially religious schools. Hill was lis ted in the Congressional Directory, 79th Congress, 1st Session, August 1985, page 18, as a 32nd degree Mason."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Socialist-Controlled Education: The Road to Slavery 75 Nowhere was Socialist pressure on education so stro ngly manifested than through the National Education Association, (NEA). With passage of the GI Bill there appeared a new attempt to wreck federal fundi ng for private schools with- out strings attached, the strings always in the han ds of the NEA. On January 10, 1945, the NEA sponsored new legislation that would not allow federal funding of private schools. The legislation was believed draft ed by Justice Hugo Black. What the measure did was to accomplish through omis sion rather than direct exclusion, the desired goals of the NEA. It was a c leverly drafted piece of legis- lation. The same cleverness was displayed in 1940 i n the drafting of so-called \"separation of church and state\" legislation. Decisions by Socialist-Unitarian Justices who domin ated the Supreme Court from 1935 to 1965, effectively barred Christian edu cation curricula from public schools. In the war hysteria atmosphere of the 1940 s, nobody saw fit to point out that any interference by the Federal Government in education was an outright vio- lation of the 10th Amendment. The far-reaching so-c alled \"separation of church and state\" ruling of the Court was completely unlaw ful, not to found in the Constitution. There is no constitutional grounds fo r \"separation of Church and State\" which was used to destroy the basis of relig ious instruction in the schools. The acceptance of this skewed piece of legislation, a strong attack on the Constitutional rights of We, the People, had a dire ct bearing on the quality of American education, which went into a tailspin, imm ediately after this fraudulent, unconstitutional ruling. American education was the re after overrun by teaching all sorts of \"rights\" that did not exist, \"women's rights,\" \"civil rights\" and \"homo- sexual rights.\" Following the barring of religious instruction from schools and the introduction of \"humanism\" by John Dewey, a very su bstantial rise of violent crime followed almost immediately. America, founded on Christianity, was abducted, hel d to ransom, violated, a victim of Socialist barbarity, battered and bruised , and barely able to crawl on its knees in the 1990s, about as far removed from the c ountry that the Founding Fathers strove to make it as it was possible to get . In this savage assault on the Virtuous Republic of United States, Socialist-Mason ic control of education from the 1st grade onwards, played the leading role. It has been proved over and over again that childre n start learning in the pri- mary grades, 1st, 2nd, 3rd. In middle class homes, where a higher value of learn- ing prevails, parents will help their children with reading, but in the lower class families, parents invariably don't help their child ren, with the result that children who read badly are found to gravitate toward crimin al activities. There are always exceptions, but the foregoing is recognized by educ ators not blinded by \"minori- ty\" blinkers to be generally true. In a rotten conspiracy entered into between the Soc ialist and President Harry Truman, the Plessy vs. Ferguson ruling, the \"separa te but equal\" doctrine of edu-"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"76 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship cation, was undermined by President Truman, pretend ing slyly all the while to favor it. The real issue was that neither Truman or anyone in the Federal Government had the right to interfere in matters of education, since as we have stated elsewhere, the 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution reserves the powers of education to the States. The Federal Government is prohibited in meddling in education, which belongs solely to the States. One of the chief causes of the horrible decline of education in the Nation, can be found in the landmark case, Everson vs. Board of Education brought before the New Jersey Supreme Court, October 5, 1943. The case arose out of issues made by Rep. Graham Barden in 1940 about religious schoo ls receiving government subsidies The Everson case was a revival of Barden' s defeated bill. As I have pre- viously indicated, the Socialists are tenacious in their efforts to overturn the Constitution of the United States, which they view as the principal stumbling block to their ardent desire to Socialize the peopl e of this Nation. The Everson case was about the State of New Jersey allowing the town of Ewing to pay the cost of transporting (voluntarily as opposed to mandatory) schoolchildren to all schools, including religious schools. The plaintiff, a Mr. Arch Everson, had objected to the funding of transp ortation for children attend- ing religious schools. In this he was supported by the Masons, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), although the ACLU kep t well out of sight during State court proceedings. Ostensibly, the objection came only from Mr. Everson in those proceedings. The Socialists needed to win the case in order to use it as a precedent-setting corner stone for future planned a ssaults on education \"religious clause\" cases they planned to bring if Everson was successful. The matter was heard by the New Jersey Supreme Cour t which allowed the town of Ewing to continue funding transportation of children to all schools. Backed by the ACLU, which now emerged from hiding, and the Masons, Everson took his case to the Supreme Court. It was the chan ce of a lifetime for Black to demonstrate his ignorance of the Constitution and h is prejudice against Christianity, while striking a blow for Socialism. The Supreme Court ruled against the State of New Jersey, with the ACLU comi ng out in the open as a so- called \"friend of the court.\" The ACLU brief was vi rtually an in to to copy of a Mason citation made by Elmer Rogers many years earl ier. Overlaid on the Mason citation, the ACLU brief was virtually a near-perfe ct fit. The majority decision of the Court was written by J ustice Hugo Black. Being packed with Socialists and Masons, the Court could hardly have ruled against the prejudiced viewpoint of its members, Christian hate rs violently opposed to the teaching of Christian beliefs in schools receiving so-called \"Federal\" aid. Prior to 1946, the \"wall between Church and State\" had hardly ever been used in a legal argument. It was, after all, merely the words of Thomas Jefferson, a mere phrase, not found in the Constitution. But a fter the Everson case, which"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Socialist-Controlled Education: The Road to Slavery 77 Justice Hugo Black had been elevated to the Supreme Court specially to rule in favor of plaintiff Everson, the courts unleashed a torrent of verbal abuse against Christianity in particular, and against religious i nstruction in schools in general. The courts outlawed prayers in schools; banned oral Bible readings, declared atheism and secular humanism as religions protected by the First Amendment and struck down the custom of allowing children to atte nd prayer services inside school property, all against long standing traditio ns, customs, such as singing Christmas carols, prohibited religious instruction by teachers, and as we shall see in the chapters dealing with Law, beyond the ken an d the pale of the constitution. The Supreme Court took a phrase uttered by Jefferso n, \"wall of separation between Church and State\" which has no constitution al standing, and inserted it in the Constitution, thereby turning the United Sta tes of America into a society in which the Christian religion was not allowed to pla y any role whatsoever in State affairs, certainly not what the Founding Fathers ha d intended. So blatantly prejudiced was Black, that his fellow Justices had occasion to write about him in unflattering terms. In a diary e ntry dated March 9, 1948, Frankfurter wrote that Justice Harold O. Burton \"ha sn't the remotest idea how malignant men like Black and Douglas not only can b e, but are.\" This was man- ifested in the Everson case, where Black demonstrat ed his prejudiced determina- tion based on hatred of Christ, that religion not p lay a role in the life of our Nation. The rot started with Everson, continued wit h Brown vs. Board of Education and inevitably, Roe vs. Wade, which up un til now remains the greatest victory and triumph over the Constitution of the Un ited States and the American people, ever achieved by the Fabian Socialists. The Supreme Court went CROOKED with the advent of Black and has remained s o ever since. There was never a clearer case of a violation of th e 9th Amendment than the Everson decision. The 9th Amendment forbids judges from putting their own thoughts into matters of law that are not spelled o ut in the Constitution. This is called predilection, and that is precisely what Bla ck and his fellow justices did in the Everson case. They twisted and squeezed the Con stitution to fit their own stinking prejudiced predilections and came out on t he side of Socialist-Masonry, in utter defilement of the Constitution. The Socialists were about to bring their Brown vs. School Board, Topeka, Kansas case before the Supreme Court. Justice Vinso n had told Truman that the Brown vs. School Board case would be disposed of an d that \"separate but equal\" education would remain in place. Vinson did this kn owing full well that it was a not true. Thus when 33rd Degree Mason Socialist Chief J ustice Earl Warren read the decision on the Brown vs. School Board case, there were gasps of surprise from the spectators, some of whom, being in the know, had co me to hear the court uphold Plessey vs. Ferguson. Few present in the court on that fateful day could have been aware of the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"78 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship tremendous blow that had been struck for \"standardi zed,\" \"Socialized\" education in the most blatant violation cf the Constitution u p to that time. It is true to say that several attempts had been made in the past to circumvent the Constitution by \"legislative action\" as proposed by the Socialist, Florence Kelley (Weschnewetsky). A bill was introduced in 1924, wit h the intent and purpose of violating the 10th Amendment to the United States C onstitution, in that the bill sought to create a Department of Education, which t ook its title from the Communist Department of Education in Bolshevized Ru ssia. The idea was to \"nationalize,\" \"standardize\" and \"federalize\" educa tion in the United States as it was in the USSR. What the bill sought to achieve was force every chi ld in America to read the same, \"standardized\" text books, which would includ e a good leavening of Marxist, Socialist, Leninists text books, so that children w ould emerge from the school sys- tem as good little Socialists ready to march into t he One World Government — New World Order. Leading Socialist of the Fabian Societ y had always said that to stan- dardize education was the quickest way to break dow n the natural barriers against Socialism in America, arising from the big land mas s, geographical, weather, local customs, local school boards. Webb had remarked tha t diversity was a problem for socialism, and diversity existed in America in abun dance, which made the country difficult to penetrate with Marxism, Communist, Soc ialism. That is why our Founding Fathers in their foresight and wisdom, made sure that the powers of education remained with the Stat es and prohibited to the Federal Government. This system of States education was a safeguard against anarchy and nilhism from within the Nation. Althoug h they failed in this instance, Socialists never gave up on their attempt to seize control of education, and their chance came with the treasonous conduct of Presiden t Jimmy Carter and sedi- tionists in the House and Senate, who got an Educat ion bill federalizing education passed, in violation of the 10th Amendment. As a re sult, the illegal U.S. Department of Education was created. Carter will go down in history as a president who c ommitted wholesale trea- son and sedition. \"I will not lie to you\" said Cart er, and then set about imple- menting Socialist legislation that robbed the State s of making their own decisions on education, and robbed the people of the Nation, of the Panama Canal. The 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States were never ratified, so any legislation passed by the Co ngress in pursuant of these amendments are outside of the ken and the pale of t he Constitution, Socialist Dr. William H. Owen would have loved Carter. Owen was t he president of the Chicago Normal College, Chicago, Illinois and presi dent of the NEA, who was chosen to represent the NEA at the World Conference on Education, June 23, 1923, held in San Francisco.

Our Founding Fathers were wise enough to foresee the ti me when Socialist agents like Wilson, Kennedy, Johnson, Carter, Bush and Clinton, and Socialists like Owen, disguised as \"educators\" would try to steer our, Na tion leftward through their seditious \"education\" programs, and so they made su re that the powers of educa- tion were prohibited to the Federal Government. However, using the Supreme Court to get around the Constitution was a dan- gerous development the Founding Fathers could not h ave altogether foreseen. They knew treason mongers existed in their day and age, but they could not have had any idea that a man like Chief Justice Earl War ren would come along and make a mockery of the Constitution. It is said of W arren, that he made the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, mean \"everything and any- thing.\" It was through this ugly subterfuge, of unr atified amendments and a Supreme Court choked with judges with sedition on t heir minds, that the obnox- ious Brown vs. Board of Education became \"law,\" whi ch it is not, but which the States are forced, nevertheless to obey. Another ugly subterfuge and piece of outright decei t, was the use by Warren of totally prejudiced sociological data dredged up by Dr. Gunnar Myrdal, a Socialist reprobate whose economic theories had cos t Sweden billions of dollars, and we shall return to this outright liar in due co urse. The Department of Education was established to take control of education away from the States and replace American education with a system that would ensure children grow up in the Socialist format and become political leaders, in the Socialist way of promoting a new political orde r based on the Soviet system, which will lead to the One World Government — New W orld Order. What the Warren Court tried to do with Brown vs. Bo ard of Education, and other Supreme Court Justices have also tried to do, was separate the 1st Section of the 14th Amendment from the whole Constitution, so that it would mean any- thing they wanted it to read into it — classic pred ilection forbidden by the 9th Amendment.

The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the Several States and U. S. citizens, second. The 14th Amendment is still a restriction on the Federal Gov ernment, even though it was not ratified, so the States kept their sovereignty and could not be imposed upon in matters of education by the Federal Government. There was tremendous pressure on judges to rule in favor of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in cases involving rel igion in schools. The ACLU filed 23 such briefs and in the cases heard by Just ice Felix Frankfurter, he always ruled in favor of the ACLU. One of the allies of th e ACLU was Pastor Davies of the Unitarian Church of which Justice Hugo Black wa s a member. This is what Davies had to say about \"religious clause\" school c ases: \"Like St. Paul's freedom, religious liberty with a great price must be bought. And for those who exercise it most fully, by insist ing upon religious education for their children, mixed with secular by terms of our Constitution, the price is greater than others... The religions of the creeds are obso lescent, the basis of their claims expired with yesterday.\" Justice Hugo Black was 100 percent in favor of packing the Supreme Court of the United States with Sociali st justices which is what Roosevelt and Truman certainly did. Justice Hugo Black was a committed Freemason, and o ne must suppose that he held to Mason tents regarding education: \"Next to this, the form of learned literary society is best suited for our pur- poses and had not Masonry existed, this cover would have been employed and it may be much more than a cover, it may be a powerful , engine in our hands.

This will be obtained chiefly by means of schools, and by ope n, hearty behavior, populari- ty and tolerance of their prejudices which at leisu re root out and dispel... We must acquire the direction of education, of church manag ement — of the professional chair and of the pulpit.\" What is truly astonishing is that if we take the wr itings of Beatrice and Sydney Webb and overlay them upon the Masonic views of education, we find they are almost always identical! The onslaught on American education was directed by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relati ons, the premiere brainwash- ing establishment in the world, and their \"educator s,\" Kurt Lewin, Margaret Meade. H.V. Dicks, Richard Crossman and W.R. Bion. These enemies of the American Republic were unleashed upon an innocent, unsuspecting general pub- lic, with disastrous consequences for education. Among their \"new science\" sciences projects for Ame rican schools were the study of masturbation, homosexuality, transvestitis m, lesbianism, prostitution, exotic religions, cults and religious fundamentalis m. The so-called \"civil rights law\" of 1870, which was supposed to enforce the 15th Amendment which was never properly ratified ap plied specifically to the Chinese brought over by the opium peddlers and the railroad magnates like the Harrimans, should not have any bearing today as the 15th Amendment was never properly ratified. To imply that \"equal protection of the laws\" in the Section 1 of the 14th Amendment, means that every person has the same level of intelligence — more than even the worst star-struck Liberal woul d hold to be true! But this is exactly and precisely what Brown vs. Board of Educa tion attempted to do — level all minds to one mean or average level. This is at the core of Brown vs. Board of Education and it is egalitarianism in acti on. Sedition in education is a reality as much of a rea lity \"gun control\" as the sedition practiced by Senator Meztenbaum and Repres entative Schumer. By per- verting education, first through the establishment of a Federal Government department of education and second by Supreme Court action of the order of Brown vs. Board of Education, treason and sedition transpires. To destroy the American system of education and replace it with a Marxist/Leninist/Socialist system will result in the rot of the Nation from wi thin. The secular humanist Justice Warren was guilty of treason when he allowe d Brown vs. Board of Education to become \"law.\" The National Education Association (NEA) is a 100 p ercent Socialist- Marxist organization.

They were no doubt in the vanguard of those who brought Brown vs. Board Education case in 1954, \"fixed\" by Justice Earl Warren, in th e Abe Fortas manner. With the Socialist take-over of American schools, n ew curriculums were introduced, children being awarded credits in cours es such as soap operas and nonsensical \"environmental issues. \"In all, Tavisto ck Institute drafted 4000 new science social scientists to work on turning Americ an education away from tradi- tional values. The result of their efforts can be s een in the huge upsurge of violent teenage crime, school crimes, rapes. These statisti cs mirror the success of the Tavistock Institute's methods. Among the \"educators\" drafted by the Socialists wer e the Socialist Gunnar Myrdal and his wife, who hailed from Sweden. The My rdals had a long history of fealty to Socialist/Marxist ideas. Dr. Myrdal ha d worked as an assistant to avowed Socialist Walt Whitman Rostow, at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva. Rostow's treasonou s activities are recounted in other chapters of this book. Myrdal had worked i n Sweden as Minister of Commerce before joining Rostow, in which capacity h e did almost irreparable damage to Sweden's economy, in true big-spending So cialist style. Myrdal was chosen by the Socialist Carnegie Foundat ion to conduct a study in race relations in the United States on a grant o f $250,000. It was believed that since Myrdal had no experience with blacks, there b eing none in Sweden, his study would be impartial. What was not realized at the time was that the whole thing was a set up: Myrdal was to produce a set of conclusions that would be used in the notorious Brown vs. Board of Education case. Myrdal produced a report filled with totally fraudulent so-called sociopolit ical conclusions which said, in essence that blacks were getting a raw deal in educ ation. Myrdal's conclusions were riddled with gaping holes. Moreover, far from being a disinterested scientist, Myrdal was an avowed enemy of the Constitution of the United States, whi ch he referred to as being, \"a nearly fetishistic cult...a 150-year old Constituti on (which is) in many respects impractical and ill-suited for modern conditions... Modern historical studies reveal that the Constitutional Convention was merely a plo t against the common peo- ple....Until recently, the Constitution has been us ed to block the popular will.\" Myrdal and his wife toured the United States under the auspices of the Socialist Benjamin Malzberger. Among the lesser of scores of disparaging remarks made by Myrdal was the one in which he desc ribed the American people as, \"narrow-minded whites, ridden by evangelistic r eligion,\" and Southern whites he dismissed as \"poor, uneducated, coarse and dirty .\" This was the man who wrote the \"unbiased\" sociological background report which it is said, made up Chief Justice Earl Warren's mind on which way to ru le in the Brown vs. Board of Education case."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Socialist-Controlled Education: The Road to Slavery 83 What was behind the great Socialist drive of the 19 20 and 1950s to wreck America's education system? It can be summed up in a few words: The central idea was to \"make new minds\" for only through new m inds could humanity remake itself — this according to one of the high-p riests of Socialist education, Eric Trist, who added that the new mind would exclu de belief in the Christian reli- gion. And as Myrdal said, \"what better place to sta rt than in the schools?\" In bringing the Brown vs School Board case before t he Supreme Court, the NAACP received ten million dollars from a variety o f sources, including the Political Action Group, a Socialist-front organizat ion, and Freemasonry. NAACP lawyers received extensive briefings from Florence Kelley and Mary White Ovington. Kelley was the originator of the \"Brandei s Briefs\" which consisted of hundreds of sociological opinions and often covered by no more than two pages of legal references. The Brandeis Briefs method was the way in which the Supreme Court was to rule in all future cases invol ving Constitutional matters The Socially-corrupted American school curricula do es not teach the Constitution, because if children were given instru ction in it, they would have to be taught that the Constitution is there as a prima ry defense against the Federal Government and presidents like George Bush and Bill Clinton, who would aspire to become tyrants, if not subject to its constraint s. The aims of Socialist educators is to gradually erode the constitutional safeguards that guarantee life, liberty and property for all citizens and replace them with tot alitarian Socialism. Only a Biblical-based education system is good. All other systems were devised by men and therefore must of necessity be i mperfect. Our schools have fallen into the hands of profoundly influential peo ple whose main purpose in life it is to turn them into a Socialist bulwark. In thi s they have the backing of the judi- ciary. The goal is to advance, slowly, in true Soci alist style, toward a Socialist/Marxist government, by altering the thrus t and direction of what is taught in schools. If the Socialists continue to ma ke the kind of progress they have made over the past three decades, by the year 2010 we shall have a nation of young adults and middle aged citizens who will have no quarrel with the secret agenda of centralized power in a Socialist dictator ship, backed up by a national police force. It is clear that one of the objectives that has alr eady been reached by the Socialists is the lack of interest in reading. Amer ican children would be totally lost if they were placed, let us say, in the Britis h Museum Library in London, or the Louvre in Paris. The great writers and artists would have little to say to them. Books are not the friends of children as they were in the early days of our histo- ry. Our education system has seen to that. Even Dic kens is a stranger to the major- ity of American students. The lack of true education is leading children and young adults to seek enlightenment\" in the movies, in rock music, which is how it was intended. The"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"84 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship only way we can fight this insidious creeping paral yses is to intervene regularly and vigorously. The so-called \"struggle against rac ial prejudices\" in the 1960s greatly affected the minds and attitudes of our you ng people. The so-called demo- craticization of our schools and universities over the past three decades was a direct attack on their internal structures, which b rought in its wake a loss of focus and direction. The so-called \"feminist\" movement is a direct produ ct of the Communist man- ifesto of 1848 and the twisted thinking of Gunnar M yrdal and the new science sci- entists of the Tavistock Institute. This has result ed in students questioning the gen- der of God. Likewise the distortion of \"history\" is very much in evidence in the 1990s. A group of school children was asked who the most evil man in the world was; without hesitation they answered, \"Hitler.\" Th e same group knew nothing at all about Stalin, certainly not that he was the gre atest butcher of humanity of all times who killed ten times as many people as Hitler is said to have caused to be murdered. Such a statement would bring looks of puz zlement to their faces. The heroes of school children and students are not the great figures of histo- ry; rather their \"idols\" are the decadent, evil, un washed, drug-ridden \"pop stars.\" Beethoven and Brahms mean nothing to them, but they will at once show a real interest when the hideous sounds of \"rock\" music fi ll the air. On the other hand, Marxis known to most college students but they do n ot really know what he stood for. We have arrived at a point in education in our schools where \"reform\" is put above learning. In the 1990s, virtually every educa tional matter is attached to the word, \"reform.\" Nowhere has a greater transformation due to \"reform s\" taken place than in sex education. The Communists were determined that even the very youngest stu- dent be forced to learn about sex. Madame Zinoviev was in charge of the project in Bolshevik Russia, which she tried to transfer to the United States, but which was blocked in the 1920s by a Supreme Court not yet packed with Socialist jus- tices, and by the alertness of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The products of \"feminist courses\" now regard marriage as merely another contract. Sex has had the mystic taken out of it, so that tod ay's college girl does not want to spend time forming an emotional relationship bef ore indulging in \"free love.\" We know that these ideas were prepared in Bolshevik Russia by Madame Kollontay and then transplanted to the United State s by her. Our badly-flawed educational system is turning out girls who are maladapt- ed toward society and the truth of the statement is borne out by crime statistics involving teenage girls. The drug culture is deeply embedded in the youth of the 1990s. Spiritual matters have been driven out of ou r schools. Today, our young students are the edge of the \"Age of Socialist Enli ghtenment\" where anything goes if it feels good. Of all the sciences, political science is the oldes t, its beginnings traceable to"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Socialist-Controlled Education: The Road to Slavery 85 ancient Greece. Political Science covers the love o f justice, and it explains why men want to rule. But political science is not taug ht properly in our educational institutions, which now teach a perverted form of i t known as Socialism. If polit- ical science had been properly taught in our school s and colleges, Justice Warren would not have had such an easy time forcing Brown vs. Board of Education down our throats. Thus, by cunning, by stealth and deception did the Socialists work their way into the fateful Brown vs. Board Edu cation ruling, which redi- rected education in the United States into Socialis t/Marxist/Communist channels. The Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations funded a s tudy-group composed of Margaret Meade, a new science anthropologist and Re nsis Likert, to come up with a review of all educational policies governed by Bi blical law. Meade used Tavistock Institute's reverse psychology technique to overcom e what the report termed \"a teaching problem.\" This report, which has had a dev astating impact on education in the United States, remains classified to this day. One of the results of the Meade- Likert study was the emergence of the National Trai ning Laboratories (NTL) with more than four million members. One of its affiliat es was the National Education Association (NEA), the largest teachers organizatio n in the world. Thanks to the efforts of this organization and the hundreds upon thousands of Socialist teachers, secular, humanist education has come the full circle from its slow beginnings of 1940. By the 1990s the Socialist s have mustered so many impressive victories in the Supreme Court that they are quite open about their intentions of altogether secularizing education. Th e new scheme, although not really new except in the choice of title, will drag American education down to the dust and leave our children among the most uneducat ed in the world. Earlier, we mentioned the Tavistock Institute for H uman Relations in Sussex University, England and the crucial role it has pla yed in the economic, political, religious and educational life of the Nation. This organization was unknown in the United States until I published my works about it i n the 1970s. Tavistock is under the direct control of the most powerful Socialist f igures in Britain and is closely allied with British Freemasonry. It has the closest of contacts with the National Education Association, whose top management personn el were trained at the National Training Laboratories. This is the level a t which \"geopolitics\" entered education at the teacher's level. The \"new\" system is called, \"Outcome Based Educatio n\" (OBE.) What OBE is going to do is teach our children that there is no need to learn to read and write properly, there is no need to excel in education; w hat matters is how they relate to each other and children from other races. What is OBE? It is a system that punishes excellenc e and rewards medioc- rity. The OBE aims to make our children over into o ne level students where the ruling standard is mediocrity. Why should this be s o desirable? The obvious answer is that a nation in which the vast bulk of t he population is educated at the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"86 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship lowest common denominator level, will be easy to st eer toward a Socialist dicta- torship. The basis for OBE was established with Bro wn vs. Board of Education, which in a very real sense, \"pegged\" education leve ls to the lowest common denominator. What OBE will do is turn Christian American childre n into pagans, with no respect for their parents, and no love for country, children who will despise national identity and patriotism. The love of one's country is turned into some- thing ugly, to be avoided at all costs. OBE teaches the Marxist concept that tradi- tional family life is out of date. This is precisel y what Madame Kollontay tried to force on the United States in the 1920s; it was wha t Socialists Bebel and Engels strove to introduce into mainstream education in Am erica. Now, their wildest expectations are being fulfilled through OBE. It is eerie, even uncanny, how OBE duplicates the w ritings of Bebel, Engels, Kollontay and Marx — almost a carbon copy of the ha ters of family life and the sanctity of marriage. It is uncanny how the system proposed in OBE is found almost word-for-word in the Communist Manifesto of 1848. We can only say that following the stunning successes of the Evers case and Brown vs. Board Education, Socializing education in America took of f like a hurricane, and seem- ingly, today, there is no holding it back. Justices Black and Douglas would have rejoiced if t hey were still with us, as would have Brandeis, Frankfurter and Earl Warren. O BE has seized control of the schools. Today, instead of having teachers, we have change agents who force acceptance of group views, which they, the facilita tors, brainwash into the minds of the students. The \"reforms\" the facilitators car ry out are turning children against their parents and their family values. The group leader in the class takes the place of the parent. There is always the notion that \"inner reform\" or \"inner needs\" must be catered to, and those \"needs\" mean a nything the group leaders says they mean. The old Socialist technique of \"sexual education\" i s pushed far beyond any- thing previously encountered. In OBE there are grou p pairing with explicit sen- suality training and promiscuity is actively encour aged. There is no attempt to foster a sense of history. Nothing is taught about the great leaders of the past who brought civilization to the world. The emphasis is on the present, \"do it now\" and \"do it if it feels good.\" OBE is responsible for th e tremendous upsurge in juvenile crime. The present and future generation of youth n ow being taught through OBE methods will become street mobs of today's \"French Revolution,\" to be used for the same purposes, in the not too distant future. There is no doubt that project OBE arose from the 1 986 \"World Curriculum\" and from the book, \"Brave New World,\" by Aldous Hux ley in which he stated that a perfect world would be one without families, chil dren without parents, in which a loathing and disgust were induced for the words, \"father,\" \"mother\" and cared"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Socialist-Controlled Education: The Road to Slavery 87 for by State social institutions, children whose al legiance would be only to the state. The quest for such a society goes back a lon g way, before \"World Curriculum\" and Huxley. The Communist Bebel wrote h is version of how chil- dren ought to be regarded — as wards of the state. So did Marx, Engels, and par- ticularly Madam Kollontay, whose work, \"Communism a nd the Family\" was the source of much of Huxley's \"Brave New World.\" Children would come via the test tube, and laborato ries would match sperm to give a higher level of mentality, mid-level inte lligence and lower intelligence. In their adult life these beings would be assigned various roles in a slave world, as I described in my book, \"The Committee of 300.\" If this sounds too much for the reader to accept, then bear in mind that test t ube babies are already with us. They have been accepted by society, not realizing t he sinister purpose behind this ungodly development. Socialism needs a dullard mass and a small number of peo- ple of higher intelligence. The dullard masses will do the work in the slave-labor Socialist world, the intelligent class, the ruling. In such a world, we shall have \"apartheid\" such as would make the South African ve rsion look like a golden age of goodwill. The reaction of readers to this information will be predictably one of skepti- cism. However, we need to examine realities, so let us see just how far OBE has come in matching Huxley, Kollontay, Engels and Bebe l. House of Representatives bill, HR 485 is part of the Socialist agenda to \"re form\" education. President Clinton was selected to carry out a wide-ranging battery of reforms — and he is doing it with great speed and efficiency, knowing that he wi ll be a single-term president. The Parents as Teachers (PAT) Socialist plan is already in action in 40 States. The so- called \"Co-parenting Program\" (COP) began with a pi lot program in St. Louis, Missouri in 1981. The real intent of COP is to subs titute parental authority with COP social workers, preferably in the pre-natal per iod. Taking her cue from Aldous Huxley, Laura Rogers wro te a work she called, \"The Brave New Family in Missouri\" in which she sta ted that it has taken only four years for PAT to be accepted by the Missouri's State Legislature and that the PAT concept has spread to Europe and is being imple mented in 40 States in America. Is this reality? Does it compare with what we have exposed in this chap- ter about educational \"reforms?\" The Socialists int end to \"reform\" education to such an extent that it will produce the very climat e foretold by Huxley's \"Brave New World.\" And they are doing it now, before our v ery eyes! Under PAT, a so-called \"educator\" will attach himse lf or herself to a family — in the literal sense, and begin the process of ch anging attitudes of both parents and child or children to conform with Socialist ide als. How this is being done was explained by Rogers in her article, \"The Brave New Family in Missouri:\" Step 1. The \"parent-educator\" will visit schools an d homes \"bond\" herself to the family, under the guise of furthering the child 's education."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"88 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship Step 2. The child or children is given a computer i dentification number which will be permanent. Step 3. The \"change agent\" will work toward changin g the relationship between child and parents through a \"mentoring prog ram\" such as happens in the Socialist Oxford University. Step 4. \"Parent educators\" are required to report a nything they deem \"hostile behavior\" or abuse by calling a \"hotline\" especiall y set up for this purpose. Step 5. Judges will decided \"hotline cases\" and if the child or children are deemed at risk, the child or children may be remove d from parental custody. Step 6. If the mental health services recommendatio ns of the \"parent educa- tor\" are refused by the parents, such as what medic ation to be prescribed, the state can remove the child or children from parental cust ody. The child or children can be placed in a residential treatment center and the parents ordered by the courts to undergo \"psychological counseling\" for as long a s the \"parent teacher\" deems necessary. What the PAT program does, is set itself up as judg e and jury in deciding who are fit and unfit parents! For this PAT uses what R ogers calls, \"risk factor defini- tions\" which have become the standard yardstick for measuring the fitness or unfitness of parents to raise children, and bear in mind, this criteria is being used at present in 40 States: \"Inability of parent to cope (which is not defined) with inappropriate child behavior (e.g., severe biting, destructive behavior , apathy)\". \"Low-functioning parents.\" These are considered as potentially abusive par- ents. In this category the parent-teacher has a lar ge number of options. Virtually any parent could come under the category of \"low fu nctioning.\" \"Undue stress that adversely affects family functio ns.\" This gives a virtually unlimited number of options to the parent teacher t o cite as \"abusive\" danger signs, including low income. \"Other... This can include a wide variety of condit ions such as allergies, heavy cigarette smoking in the house (does R.J. Rey nolds know about this?), a family history of hearing loss...\" From the foregoing it is clear that Socialism in ed ucation has come of age in America. What Madame Kollontay, Engels, Bebel and H uxley found most desirous has now come to pass. Education is the way in which Socialism can be defeated, as so many of our statesmen in the 1800s made clear, but in the wrong hands, it is a mighty weapon which Socialism will w ield without mercy to bring about their longed-for New World Order slave state. None of this would have been possible, but for the treason and treachery of the Supreme Court and espe- cially the venomous attitude of Justices Douglas an d Black, who should go down in history as two of the most vile traitors in the history of this Nation."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Female of the Species 89 4 THE FEMALE OF THE SPECIES All through history, women have played a decisive r ole. Before the 20th cen- tury, it was usually from the background, observing , giving advice and encour- agement, never in an obtrusive manner, and seldom, if ever, publicly. But that was to change in the late 1800s, and the vehicle of change was the Fabian Society and International Socialism. When the small, bespectacled Sydney Webb met the st atuesque Martha Beatrice Potter, sparks began to fly. (Miss Potter preferred Beatrice, which had a better ring to it than Martha.) Both recognized in the other a peculiar genius for organizing and getting the day to day business done . Anthony and Cleopatra were more glamorous, the Queen of Sheba and Solomon more majestic; Hitler and Eva Braun more dramatic, but by comparison with the Web bs, their impact on the world was of a lesser degree. The damage done by the Webb s is still reverberating around the world, long after the other two somes have beco me mere historical figures. Sydney Webb met Beatrice Potter in 1890. She was we ll endowed both phys- ically and financially. He, by contrast, was short and small and had no money. Beatrice came from a family of Canadian railroad ty coons and she had her own income from her father. Perhaps what brought the Sy dney and Beatrice together was their conceit, which they never bothered to hid e. Beatrice had been angered and embittered by the rejection of her love-offerin g to \"upper class\" Joseph Chamberlain, which seems to be the fuel that kept h er \"class hatred\" fires burn- ing. Webb worked as a clerk in the British Colonial Office, considered a fairly low station in life in Victorian England. In 1898 Beatrice and her husband turned their atten tion to the United States, going on a three-week \"grand tour.\" During this tim e, the Webbs did not meet with rank and file members of labor unions nor any of the ladies slaving away in New York's garment district. Rather, they sought ou t, and were received by the elite of Socialism in New York, including Miss Jane Addams and Prestonia Martin, both right out of the Social Register."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"90 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship This was a pattern that was to be followed by all S ocialist/Bolshevik leaders in later years. In 1900, thanks largely to the work of Beatrice, the Royal Commission of London University ruled that henceforth, economi cs would be elevated to the sta- tus of a science. Beatrice lost no time in impressi ng Granville Barker, a theater man of note, and President Wilson's personal representa tive, Ray Stannard Baker, with this great achievement, at a lunch hosted by Beatri ce and her husband. The Webb-Potter partnership developed into marriage and set the fashion of a husband and wife team devoted more to Socialism t han to each other in private, but for appearance sake, a very devoted couple. Thi s was to prove a big draw card for attracting women into the ranks of social cause s and politics, and can be said to be the birth of radical feminism. From Clements Inn, headquarters of the Fabian Society came the \"Fabian News,\" published fi rst in 1891. Beatrice was coauthor and her money paid for the cost of printin g. It came naturally to Beatrice that the best way to promote their ideal was through the elite of the land. While the ordinary p eople were good for Billy Graham-type \"rallies\" it was the elite who could ge t things done. In this regard, Beatrice never lost her snobbishness. As she saw it , they had to convert the elite first; the rest would follow. This was the pattern that Bolshevik leaders were to adopt in later years. One never saw Khrushchev stay ing at a dock workers cottage or having meetings with the rank and file of the tr ade unions during his visit to England and other West European countries. It was a lways to the elite to whom Khrushchev gave his rapt attention, Agnelli of Ital y, Rockefeller of the United States, and so it was with all Socialist leaders. It was no surprise that Beatrice began concentratin g on the sons of the rich and the famous at Oxford University. How well she d id her job can be judged from the number of high-society traitors, products of Oxford and Cambridge, who willingly betrayed the West in the cause of promoti ng their goal of a Socialist world revolution of whom Burgess, Mclean, Philby, A nthony Blunt, Roger Hollis are the best known, but certainly not the only ones . Underneath the mantle of social \"reforms\" was a deadly dangerous cancer eati ng away at Christian Western ideals, and it was called Fabian Socialism. One of its earliest converts of note was Walter Lippmann, whom Beatrice Webb \"induced\" to jo in the Fabian Society. By 1910, Beatrice and her money had established sev eral centers from where Fabian propaganda was disseminated. Writers, theate r people, and politicians of the day were beginning to drift toward her circle. The general opinion was that Beatrice was running a nice, liberal, cultural move ment, according to the \"New Statesman.\" Millionaire Charlotte Payne-Townshend b ecame a friend of Beatrice who was responsible for introducing her to George B ernard Shaw, after which Charlotte made an honest man of him. Now, both the male leaders could afford devote their entire time to promoting Socialism, th anks to the money of their respective spouses."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Female of the Species 91 What has often been remarked upon is how these two women spent their lives attacking the very system that provided the m oney for their pursuits. Beatrice Webb was the guiding force in securing con trol of the Labour Party, just as in later years, another Socialist, Mrs Pamela Ha rriman, was to secure control of the Democrat Party in the United States and put in power a president whose Socialist agenda was designed to usher the country into a Socialist One World Government — New World Order. Certainly Beatrice Webb worked tirelessly to wreck the economic policies and dismantle the social and economic order of an o rderly England. What sur- prises me is that the Webbs were not arrested for s edition and treason, along with \"Red\" Professor Harold Laski. Had this happened, it might have saved the United States from Socialist oriented convulsions that are still going on. By now Beatrice numbered among her friends a Countess, and many of the famous ladies of London society at the time, including the wife of S ir Stafford Cripps. These devo- tees of radical feminism opened their homes to tea parties and weekend retreats in furtherance of Socialist causes. Throughout her long reign, Beatrice Webb never wave red in her support of the Bolsheviks, which didn't seem to phase her long list of high-society contacts, including Sir William Beveridge who was to make a t remendous impact on poli- tics in England and the United States.(The Beveridg e Plan became the blueprint for Social Security in the United States.) When Bea trice died in 1943, her services to Socialism were recognized in a bizarre manner — Martha Beatrice Webb's ashes were interred in Westminster Cathedral — a st range place for an avowed atheist to find herself! The tigress of the radical feminist, anti-marriage, anti-family movement that was given a window of opportunity to the world by t he Fabian Socialists, was Madame Alexandra Kollontay. It is not known whether Beatrice Webb ever met Kollontay during her frequent trips to Moscow. Who was Madame Kollontay? On page 9972 of pages 9962-9977, Congressional Record, Senate of May 31, 1924 we find the following: \"Madame Kollontay is now Soviet minister to Norway, after a hectic career which included eight husbands, two positions as peo ple's commissar, first as com- missar of welfare, two visits to the United States (1915 and 1916), a German Socialist agitator, after having been deported from three European countries in 1914 as a dangerous revolutionist...\" Then there is a fu rther expose of this hard-core Communist world revolutionary radical feminist, on page 4599 of pages 4582-4604: \"...Recently there came to Mexico as the ambassador of the Soviet Union, one Alexandra Kollontay. She is said to be a leader in the world revolutionary movement for 28 years; that she has been arrested i n three different countries because of her effort in 1916 and in 1917 she visit ed the United States speaking from coast to coast. She was under the management o f Ludwig Lore, now a"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"92 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship prominent Communist in the United States. The objec t and purpose of the visit of Kollontay to the United States in 1916 and 1917 was to incite the Socialists of this country and to hamper our activities if the United States entered through a system of resistance by what took place. Alexandra Kollont ay is the world's greatest exponent of 'free love' and nationalization of chil dren. She is in Mexico for that purpose and bodes no good to the people off the Uni ted States.\" Kollontay' s book, \"Communism and the Family\" is th e most violent and sav- age attack on marriage and the family ever written, surpassing the decadent evil of Fredric Engels' \"Origin of the Family.\" Kollontay's radical 'free love' followers for- merly called themselves the \"International League o f Peace and Freedom.\" But they have undergone a number of name changes to disguise the fact that their agenda is still the same as that of Alexandra Kollontay: to d ay they call themselves the National League of Women Voters and the National Ab ortion Rights League (NARL) They also have the audacity to go by the lab el of \"pro choice advocates\" meaning that they have a choice of whether or not t o murder unborn children. The goals of the Marxist/Socialist \"liberal feminis ts\" — better known as rad- ical feminists — were outlined in the 1920s-1930s a nd they have not changed. The clamor for \"women's rights\" is for love without responsibility — i.e. abor- tion on demand. They and their incendiary Socialist s in the House and Senate are in an unholy alliance with the jackals of the media , which began in the days of Florence Kelley. Kollontay was the standard bearer of the crop of ra dical feminists with which this country is cursed today. The Overman Committee on Bolshevism of the United States reported as follows: 'The apparent purpose of the Bolshevik government o f Russia is to make the Russian citizen especially the women and children, wards dependent on that gov- ernment...It has destroyed the natural ambition and made impossible of accomplish- ment the moral obligation to provide care for, and adequately protect the child against the misfortunes of orphanhood and widowhood ...They have promulgated decrees relating to marriage and divorce which prac tically establish 'free love.'\" Senate Document page 61, 1st Session, Pages 36-37 C ongressional Record. The foregoing fits perfectly the aims and objective s of Fabian Socialism. Radical feminism, rampant and running wild across t he United States today is a Socialist teaching. The Fabian Society's Socialist pattern allowed for radical fem- inism, indeed, encouraged it while at the same time cloaking it in a veil of domes- ticity. While Beatrice Webb and her associates were not able to establish open abortion houses, it is worth repeating that Mrs. Ha rold Laski, wife Professor Laski, of one of the great names in Socialist circl es, was the first one to push the idea of birth control counseling centers in England . Dr. Annie Besant was well-known to Beatrice Webb th rough Liberal Party circles in London. Besant was the successor to Mada me Blavatsky and inherited"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Female of the Species 93 her Theosophy Society, whose adherents were to be f ound among the rich and the famous in elite circles of power in Victorian Engla nd. Besant played no small role in instigating unrest via the drawing room, her fir st venture being an attack on industry in Lancashire, a large industrial center i n England. As the head of Co-Masonry allied to KKK \"Clarte\" (n o connection to the KKK in the U.S.) and the Grand Orient Nine Sisters Lodg e in Paris, Besant was very active in promoting what she called, \"social democr acy\" but all the time she was under the control of the Grand Orient Lodge in Pari s, from whom she received the title of Vice President of the Supreme Council and Grand Master of the Supreme Council for Britain. It is here where the convergen ce of Freemasonry, Theosophy and the Fellowship of Faiths becomes clearly recogn izable. H.G. Wells was a believer in Besant's notions, prob ably, because like Besant, he was a member of KKK \"Clarte\" as was Inez Milholl and. Both Socialist ladies worked hard for the cause of women's suffrage, whic h Sydney Webb astutely saw as the wave of the future when it came to getting v otes for the Labor and Liberal Parties. Whatever Besant became, she owed to Madame Petrova Blavatsky, who, in turn, owed her rapid rise up the social ladder to H erbert Burrows who promoted her \"talents\" through the Society for Physical Rese arch, a select club for the rich, the aristocracy and the politically powerful in Vic torian London circles. These cir- cles were patronized by H.G. Wells and Conan Doyle (later Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.) Wells described Blavatsky as \"one of the mo st accomplished, ingenuous and interesting imposters in the world.\" Blavatsky was initiated into Carbonari Masonry by t he undoubted leader of that Lodge in Italy, the great Mazzini. She was als o close to Garabaldi, and was with him at the battles of Viterbro and Mentana. Tw o men who greatly influenced her life were, Victor Migal and Riavli, both Freema son revolutionaries inside the Grand Orient Lodge. She died in 1891, a hardened an d confirmed Socialist. Susan Lawrence was one of the first three Labour Pa rty candidates elected to Parliament as a result of the work done by the suff rage movement, spearheaded by Fabian Society warriors Ellen Wilkinson and Emil y Pankhurst. Lawrence became famous for her statement, \"I don't preach Cl ass War, I live it.\" Margaret Cole developed her instinct for radical feminism by working as are searcher for the Fabian Society. She was later able to put what she learned to good use when she served in the British Ministry of Labour, while her husband, G.D.H. Cole, rose to great prominence in a succession of Labour Governments. Like the Webbs, the Coles maintained an outward appearance o f domestic bliss, but theirs was a marriage of Socialist convenience. One of Beatrice Webb's star pupils was Margaret Col e, who wrote \"The Story of Fabian Socialism\" in which the goals of ra dical feminism are given a coating of sugar to attract the flies.

It is believed by Fabian Socialist researchers that the nullifying of the Lu sk Report through the veto of New York Governor Al Smith perfectly fits Fabian So cialism's dictum: \"Get someone-Socialist to do the dirty work for you.\" Co le was a member of the dele- gation of International Confederation of Free Trade Unions at the United Nations. Over in the United States, one of the most importan t of the female Socialists was Florence Kelley. Her real name was Weschenewtsk y. Nobody seemed to know much about her, except that Kelley had studied Lenin and Marx in Switzerland, the international haven for revolution aries. She liked to call herself a \"Quaker Marxist,\" sometimes a \"Marxist Quaker.\" O ne thing that the Fabian Socialists did know was that Kelley was leading the \"reform\" charge in the United States. At times she overshadowed her more f amous friend, Eleanor Roosevelt, persuading Roosevelt to join the Sociali st National Consumers League (NCL) of which she was one of the founder members. The NCL, a dedicated Socialist institution, was an organization bent on get- ting the Federal Government involved in health, edu cation and police powers that belonged to the States under the 10th Amendment of the United States Constitution. Kelley proved a genius in this regard . She is credited with formu- lating the so-called \"Brandeis Brief strategy which consisted of burying a thin legal case in masses of irrelevant documents so tha t the case was decided, even- tually, not on law, but on Socialist-slanted sociol ogy and economic \"juridical notice.\" Since the judges were not trained in socio logy, they were not the people to judge the merits of the SOCIOLOGY of the case be fore them, so that such cases were generally decided in favor of the Social ists. Elizabeth Glendower, an extremely wealthy socialite often had Kelley as a house guest along with Brandeis and the top Sociali st writers of the day. Kelley is known to have struck up a close friendship with Upton Sinclair, whose early lit- erary works were made up of bundle after bundle of Fabian Socialist \"position papers\" which were sent to Socialist university stu dents for distribution on cam- puses around the nation. In spite of her denials, K elley was a ceaseless opportu- nity-seeker in promoting the cause of world revolut ion. Mrs. Robert Lovett, whose husband held the position of professor of English at the University of Chicago, was a close ally of K elley. The Lovetts, Kelley and Jane Addams ran a Socialist induction center named Hull House, which was fre- quented by Eleanor Roosevelt and Frances Perkins. M any Hull House members traveled to England to take part in the Fabian Soci ety Summer Schools program. Kelley was good at making converts to Socialism, an d was a tireless missionary in the service of American Socialism. Socialist women came on the scene in the United Sta tes at the close of the Civil War. Communists were very active in the runup to the war and in its imme- diate aftermath, a fact that is not mentioned by es tablishment history books, and"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The Female of the Species 95 these Socialist \"feminists\" were very successful in penetrating and permeating legitimate women's organizations concerned with the well being of their families. This was relatively easy for trained Fabian Sociali sts, given the custom of the time of putting women on a pedestal of respect, des erving of male protection. Some of the leaders of the \"carpet baggers\" were de eply-committed Socialists or Communists. When the question of women's suffrage w as being raised by women Socialists, men felt it was not well advised to exp ose women to the rough and ready of politics, but they did not know their toug h female Socialists. Others were fully aware of how the Socialists and C ommunists were recruit- ing militant, aggressive females and training them to go against mainstream fem- inism. The attitude of the period is well expressed on pages 165-170 Appendix to the Congressional Globe, \"Suffrage Constitutional A mendment.\" The Hon J.A. Bayard said of Socialism in 1869: \"The next exception is that of sex. I will not argu e this position either with the Communists or the Socialists, nor with the wome n's rights party, because of the folly of this species off a naticism, though, i t has made great progress lately, is not sufficiently widespread to need elaboration or refutation. Inordinate vanity and love of notoriety may have tempted some women t o unsex themselves, both in their dress and their pursuits; but women's hear ts and the instincts of materni- ty will keep her true to the greatest of her duties in life, the culture and the for- mation of the character of her offspring...\" That it was the age of chivalry, which has been tho roughly destroyed by Hillary Rodham Clinton, Bella Abzug, Eleanor Smeal, Elizabeth Holtzman, Pat Schroeder, Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein and thei r close relatives, is found on page 169 of the Appendix to the Congressional Globe s (Speech by Senator Bayard): \"I feel proud and gratified that in this country, o ur own America, there is a chivalrous devotion to sex which has not been equal ed in any other country. I yield to none in my deference to sex, and a desire to secure and protect women in all her rights; but a suffrage is not a right...\" I t is interesting how much the Socialists used legitimate concerns felt by feminin e society and turned them into a vehicle for Socialist causes, to telling effect. It is due to the natural consequence of such penetration and permeation by clever Fabian Socialists that the United States Congress became the stamping ground for a ha rdened, unfeminine cadre of women who turned chivalry on its head in their fier ce desire to see Fabian Socialism take over the United States. Some of the so-called \"women's rights\" Socialist fr onts were the following: General Federation of Women's Clubs. National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teachers As sociation. National League of Women Voters. National Federation of Business and Professional Wo men."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"96 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship Christian Temperance Union. Association of University Women. National Council of Jewish Women. League of Womens' Voters. National Consumers League. Women's Trade Union League. Women's International League. Girl's Friendly Society America. These organizations were a party to a court action brought by Mrs. Florence Kelley and several leading \"feminists\" (Socialists) in July of 1926. They were trying to get a bill passed, \"Maternity and Infancy Act,\" which violated the 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution, but th e Supreme Court, free of the control exercised over it today (which began with t he Roosevelt era) saved the nation from a Socialist bid to completely take-over the United States. President Carter took most of the material in Madame Kollonta y's book, \"Communism and the Family\" for his education bill It was always the intention of the Socialists to na tionalize the children of America. Socialist Shirley Hufstedler, who at one t ime headed the unconstitu- tional U. S. Department of Education took her cue f rom Madame Lelina Zinoviev, wife of Gregory Zinoviev. Hufstedler was seeking to \"nationalize\" and \"interna- tionalize\" American children to fit them for their future role as race-mixers in a One World Government. This was also the intention of Frances Perkins, a t rained social worker who led the so-called \"feminist movement\" in the United States for many years. Perkins was Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Yo rk State Commissioner of Labor. She counted Eleanor Roosevelt as one of her closest female friends, and Kelley was close to Roosevelt during his three-term stay at the White House. One of Perkins' first assignments was founding the Inte rnational Association for Labor Legislation along with Eleanor Roosevelt and her pr otege, Harry L. Hopkins, with whom Perkins worked closely to bring in work r elief for the unemployed in New York State. The original plan came from a Socialist group known as the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor. Perkins and he r friends pushed all the right buttons and pulled out the right stops to get their \"reforms\" passed by the New York State Legislature. Hundreds of booklets and pa mphlets were distributed throughout schools and universities to elicit suppo rt for these \"beneficial changes\" while kept writers churned out articles wh ich were snapped up by the jackal press. Scores of \"polls\" were run to create \"popular sentiment\" for labor \"reforms\" that could only \"benefit the whole countr y.\" Perkins wore many hats, and was noted for her tirel ess energy and devotion to the Fabian Socialist movement in the United Stat es. When Roosevelt moved"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Female of the Species 97 from Albany to Washington, Perkins went with him. S he was the first women to be named to a cabinet post in the history of the Un ited States. Her influence with Roosevelt was only slightly less than that of Elean or Roosevelt. Perkins remained with Roosevelt, from the very firs t to the very last day of his three terms in office, during which time she in troduced a veritable flood of Socialist legal personnel, economists, statistician s and analysts into the Federal government. When John Maynard Keynes went calling o n Roosevelt and tried to explain his economic theories without much success, it was Perkins who sold them to Roosevelt. Perkins swallowed the \"multiplie r\" theory, making the near immortal observation that \"with (Keynes's) system, with one dollar you have cre- ated four dollars.\" Perkins concocted the scheme to rig the 1940 Democr at Convention, which gave Roosevelt his third term, although the \"credit \" for this has generally gone to Harry Hopkins. Early in the days of Roosevelt's Gov ernorship of New York, Perkins was the lobbyists for the National Consumer s League and the Women's Trade Council in Albany, New York. Her contacts among leading Socialist intellectuals of the day is said to have numbered in the hundreds and she was a favorite of Felix Frankfurter. Another of her male supporters was Harry Hopkins, who was to r ise to tremendous heights in the Roosevelt era and do tremendous harm to the United States. Perkins brought a host of Socialist economists and labor sp ecialist professors with her to Washington, from where they poured out a veritable torrent of Socialist material, much of it still taught in universities today. More than any other women — including Eleanor Roosevelt, Perkins influenced Roo sevelt to get the United States into WWII. Perkins is credited with writing the nation's unemp loyment insurance and old age pension legislation. At the request of Pres ident Roosevelt, Perkins worked behind the scenes to bring these two socialist drea ms to reality, using Prestonia Martin's \" Prohibiting Poverty\" as a guidebook. Per kins received much help from John Maynard Keynes, who visited the United States in 1934 as a Fabian Socialist ambassador of goodwill. Keynes and Perkins agreed t hat Socialism had a price- less opportunity to make great strides during the t enure of Roosevelt. Like almost all of the New Deal, which was taken vi rtually verbatim from Graham Wallas' book of the same name, \"Prohibiting Poverty\" was widely used to formulate a system for setting up compulsory soc ial insurance (Social Security.) Perkins had sought and obtained a great deal of input from Sydney and Beatrice Webb, who pointed out to Perkins and R oosevelt, that the Fabian Society had drafted the Labor Party's 1918 election plank and had a lot of influ- ence in writing the Beveridge Plan which became the basis of Britain's Social Welfare. Thus, \"The New Deal\" by Graham Wallas, the Beveridg e Plan, and Sydney"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"98 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship Webb's proposals written for the Labor Party in 191 8, and the economic \"tax and spend\" principles of the Fabian Society's John Mayn ard Keynes, were with adap- tations and minor adjustments the basis of Roosevel t's \"New Deal.\" The role played by Frances Perkins in bringing this to pass cannot be overstated. People often ask me, with deep doubt in their voices, \"How could the British possibly influence, let alone run a country like the United States, as you aver?\" The Social Security Act of 1936 was the work of Sir William Be veridge, Professor Graham Wallas and Fabian Society director, Sydney Webb, to uched up and rounded off by Frances Perkins. A study of how this was achieved a nd the role played by Frances Perkins answers the question of all Doubting Thomas es far better than any words of mine could ever do. The Social Security Act of 1936 was pure Fabian Soc ialism in action. It was unprecedented in the history of the United States a nd also 100 percent unconsti- tutional. I spent a good deal of time researching C ongressional Records of 1935- 1940 and beyond to see if I could find anything tha t would have made this piece of outright Socialist legislation constitutional, b ut to no avail. The manner in which this Socialist heist of the Ame rican people was carried out is a case history of how the Socialists will go to extraordinary lengths to get their patently absurd laws sanctified by the Suprem e Court. Perkins facing this dilemma, saw no way out of it. Roosevelt needed the Social Security Act to become law so that he could use it to get reelected . Thanks to the intercession of Harry Hopkins, Brandeis and Cardoza, Perkins found herself seated next to Socialist Justice Harlan Stone, a leading Liberal, at a Washington dinner party, at the height of the crisis. Secretary Perkins told Justice Harlan Stone that sh e was up against the Constitution and needed away to fund Social Securit y that would pass muster the Supreme Court. In breach of every judicial etiquett e, if not a gross violation of the law, Justice Stone whispered in Perkins' ear, \"the taxing power of the Federal Government, my dear, the taxing power of the Federa l Government is sufficient for, everything you want and need.\" Perkins took Ju stice Harlan Stones advice, and that is how today we come to have Socialist Soc ial Security in a Confederated Republic. There is no doubt at all that Justice Sto ne ought to have been impeached, but no charges were ever brought against him. Perkins kept the Justice's confidence, telling no o ne but Roosevelt who immediately used this grossly illegal stratagem to fund every single one of his Socialist New Deal programs. Later, Harry Hopkins w as let into the secret, and he was allowed to take credit for the phrase, \"tax and spend, tax and spend.\" Perkins was a confidant and friend of Henry Morgant hau, Justice Hugo Black, and Susan Lawrence, the formidable Member of Parliament and top Fabian Society executive. Perkins was one of the le ading personalities in the attempted takeover of the United States by Socialis ts in the 1920s — a deadly"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The Female of the Species 99 scheme that was modeled along the lines of \"Philip Dru-Administrator\" the book written by Col. Edward Mandel House. According to what Susan Lawrence told Jane Addams, it was by \"one of his- tory's strangest freaks, the elaborate system of ch ecks and balances devised in the American Constitution has resulted for the moment a t any rate, in the complete personal ascendancy of Franklin Roosevelt.\" However , a quick look at \"Philip Dru-Administrator\" shows that rather than due to ha ppenstance, it was elaborate planning and a careful heed of Colonel House's tech nique that placed Roosevelt in the top slot, ready to seize control of the Demo crat Party. When the time came, Frances Perkins was right there with her former employer. A product of Hull House, a professional s ocial worker, Perkins has been described as the Socialist's best opportunist. Perkins moved easily in the cir- cles of British Fabian Society \"aristocracy\" and sh e learned her lessons well at the hands of Lilian Wald, Jane Addams and Eleanor Roose velt. When the moment for her edification came, she was ready. If there were two main women conspirators in the 1920s they would be Kelley and Perkins. The latter's devotion to Socialism was what caught the attention of Mary Rumsey, the S ocialist sister of Averill Harriman. Mary Harriman Rumsey was the earliest of a band of enthusiastic New Deal proponents who urged the adoption of the Fabian Soc iety' s blueprint, adapted to fit American conditions. Rumsey came from one of th e top elitist families in the United States in the 1930s. Her close association w ith Eleanor Roosevelt helped to sharpen her already deeply committed Socialist a ctivism. Rumsey was a tire- less reader of the writings of Sydney Webb, Shaw, H aldane, Muggeridge and Graham Wallas. Her life-long friendship with Frances Perkins devel oped after they met through Eleanor Roosevelt and quickly discovered th eir common passion for Socialist causes, which Rumsey was quick to insist be followed by her illustrious brother, Averill Harriman, who became a devout Soci alist and intimate of a suc- cession of Bolshevik leaders. Rumsey's Socialist en deavors took her all over the United States and Europe, and in England she was fe ted by the Webbs and the blue blood aristocracy Fabian Society members. What was often remarked at the time was how this wo men whose social graces marked her clearly as from the top drawer of society, came to be inciting women trade union leaders and working in among wome n trade union rank and file where she was seemingly quite at home. Clearly Fabian Socialism had left an indelible imprint on the life of Mary Rumsey, reput ed to have been among the top five richest women in America.

Addams was the driving force behind Hull House, that Fabian Socialist \"thi nk tank\" where the female elite of the day were introduced to Socialist beliefs. Wh en Beatrice and Sydney Webb visited the United States in April of 1898, they we re guests of Miss Addams. The former \"clerk in the Colonial Office\" was said to h ave been bewitched by the com- mand of the English language displayed by Addams, a nd \"her beautiful dark eyes.\" A spinster all of her life, Addams commanded the re spect of men like Colonel Edward Mandel House, H.G. Wells. Arthur Con an Doyle, and Sir Arthur Willert, a leading British Fabian newspaperman. Addams was heavily involved in the founding of the One World Government Church, a Socialist compromise with religion, which was set to become the offi- cial \"religion\" of the One World Government, whose history we detail elsewhere herein. Addams was a true Socialist \"pacifist\" who was awar ded the Nobel Prize for her efforts to promote \"international peace.\" Addam s founded the Women's International League in conjunction with Mrs. Pethw ick Lawrence, who was a member of the \"upper crust\" of British society and a notable London society fig- ure at the turn of the century. Like Addams, she wa s a member of KKK — \"Clarte\" and Co-Masonry. Note the high-society name s, not the kind that one would associate with anarchists and revolutionary b ombers, yet the damage done to the United States by these notable female devote es of Socialism, in many instances, transcended the impact of the radicals. Addams was received by two American presidents and was an enthusiastic backer of the Wall Street bankers who had invested in Lenin and Trotsky, and a stockholder in Lenin's Russian American Industrial Corporation and the Communist Federation Press. Addams was connected wi th the American Society for Cultural Relations with Russia, which distribut ed Fellowship of Faith publi- cations, mostly to bookstores specializing in Socia list/Communist literature. Her close friendship with Rosika Schwimmer was impo rtant, because Schwimmer had the ear of Count Karloyi, the man who handed Hungary on a bloody plate to the foul beast, Bela Kuhn (real nam e Cohen) who murdered hun- dreds of thousands of Christians in Hungary, before he could be expelled. Addams was the Socialist who arranged a lecture tour for t he bloody, fiendish Count Karloyi. The female devotees of Fabian Socialism were rich, powerful with the right family connections that ensured that their strongly -Socialist ideas had an appre- ciative audience.

Addams' manners and refined speech hid an interior as hard as nails and a spirit that refused to back down, even against grea t odds. Although never admit- ted, Addams was the one who profoundly influenced R obert Mors Lovett, the man chosen to lead the Fabian Socialist push in the United States. A more unlike- ly leader for Socialist causes was not to be found. Reserved and aloof, Lovett was transformed into a firebrand after meeting with Add ams at Hull House. In many way, Lovett's campaign for socializing America was one of the most important battles ever fought by Socialist's \"greats.\" Harry Hopkins, the man who started more runaway forest fires for Fabian Socialism in A merica than any other single individual in the Socialist ranks, owed his job to Addams, who strongly recom- mended him to Roosevelt in 1932. Addams topped the list of female Socialist and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her pacifist activities on behalf of the Socialist agenda for the United States. She carried on her Socialist crusade under the umbrella of the Women's International League for Peace, which she founded i n Chicago, and which became a Communist front for \"peace,\" dearly loved by the Bolshevik leaders. Addams made a detailed study of Fabian Society publication s, especially those distilled from Madame Kollontay's books attacking marriage an d the family, and most of her time was devoted to Socialist anti-family cause s in the United States. Although they were never close, Dorothy Whitney Str aight (Mrs. Leonard Elmhurst) was an admirer of Addams. The Whitney-Str aights like Addams, were straight out of the top drawer of American high soc iety. Dorothy Whitney- Straight's brother was a partner in J.P. Morgan, wh ich gave the Whitney-Straights carte blanche entre into the smart set in Fabian So cialist circles in London, New York and Washington. The Whitney-Straights financed the American Fabian Socialist publication, \"New Republic\" (Dorothy was its largest stockholder) to which Walter Lippmann was a regular contributor as well as the leading Socialist professors at Oxford and Harvard. Professor Harold Laski was one of the favorite \"New Republic\" writers. Dorothy Whitney Straight wa s an enthusiastic backer of President Woodrow Wilson. After her marriage to Leonard K. Elmhurst, Dorothy moved court from her Long Island estate to Dartinton Hall, Totnes, Devon shire, England, \"where her heart was\" as she told friends, in order to be clos er to the center of Fabian Socialist power. There she mixed with the \"greats\" of British Socialists, like Lord Eustis Perry, Sir Oswald Mosely and Grahame Haldane .

From the very first, PEP was a subversive organizat ion bent on undermining the Constitution of the Republic of the United Stat es, and no single member worked to that end in a more tireless manner than D orothy Whitney Straight. Of her endeavors, Congressman Louis T. McFadden had th is to say: \"May I point out to you that this is a secret organ ization with tremendous power? The definition of their organization is as f ollows: A group of people who are actively engaged in produ ction and distribution in the social services in town and country plan, in finance, education, in research, in persuasion, and in various other key functions w ithin the United Kingdom....\" McFadden called the group a \" brain trust\", which, he said, \"is supposed to influ- ence the present United States policy of trade tari ffs. Neither you nor I are par- ticularly interested in what takes place in England , but what should interest us both is that there is a strong possibility that cer tain members of the brain trust around our President are in touch with this British organization, working to intro- duce a similar plan in the United States...I am ass ured by serious people, who are in a position to know that this organization practi cally controls the British Government and that this highly organized and well- financed movement is intended to practically sovietize the English-speak ing race.\" The huge damage done to trade barriers so wisely er ected by past presidents of this country to protect the well being of her ci tizens is recounted elsewhere in this book. McFadden accused the American counterpar t to Dorothy Whitney Straight's English \"brain trust\" of consisting of P rofessors Frankfurter, Tugwell, and William C. Bullit (the man who sabotaged the Wh ite Russian Army's almost certain defeat of the Bolshevik Red Army). Of them McFadden said, \"I think there is no doubt that these men belong to this par ticular organization with dis- tinct Bolshevik tendencies, and that this plan will be developed in the United States...\" In this Dorothy Whitney Straight had the always-ava ilable counsel of Felix Frankfurter who had been a frequent visitor to her Long Island estate before she moved to Devonshire. The fabulous wealth of the Whi tney-Straight family was what financed not only the \"New Statesman\" but also PEP and scores of other Fabian Society front organizations and their activi ties. Dorothy held court at her lavish Devonshire estate like the royalty she longed to be a part of. In addition to Frankfurter, freque nt visitors were J.B.

He queried why one Moses Sieff, would be ta lking about the \"New Deal\" as \"our New Deal.\" McFadden revealed the strong con nection between British Fabian Socialists and American Socialists and Commu nists whom he knew to be actively working to bring down the Republic of the United States: 'The political economic plan (PEP) is now secretly operating in En gland.\" What was the goal of Dorothy Whitney Straight's PEP?\" According to Mc Fadden, it was something their secret publications had revealed to its \"insi ders:\" \"The method of work is to bring together as a group a number of people who are concerned professionally with one or another as pect of the problem (how to break down the Constitution of the United States) u nder discussion, as well as a few non-specialists who can ask the fundamentals qu estions which sometimes escape the experts.

The rule of Fabian Socialist secrecy successfully s heltered the often treason- able activities of PEP from the eyes of the America n public.

Dorothy Whitney-Str aight was not perturbed by this and urged her fellow Socialists never to gi ve up on their goal—the upend- ing of the United States. She was truly the more da ngerous of the female species of the Fabian Society. Although not a personal friend of any of the high s ociety Fabian Socialist ladies, the name of Laura Spellman must be included here, if for no other rea- son than to point out the extraordinary good fortun e Socialism always seems to have in gaining unlimited access to very substantia l funding. The Laura Spellman Fund kicked off with a capital of $10,000, 000, but in practice there was no bottom to the Spellman well when it came to promoting Socialist pro- grams in the United States. Usually these were call ed \"reforms\" in true Fabian Socialist style. One of the \"reforms\" was that of undermining the Un ited States Constitution. When Senator Joseph McCarthy was so close to blowin g the lid off Socialist and Communist penetration of the United States Governme nt, the Laura Spellman Fund gave unlimited grants to those who conducted r esearch into the backgrounds of Martin Dies and Sen. McCarthy, and who were able to come up with anything that would discredit them. Thus the Spellman Fund w as in an indirect manner, responsible for the dangerous attack on the Constit ution of the United States which had reached frightening levels, and which Die s and McCarthy were threat- ening to expose. The political prostitute, Senator William B. Benton , who led the charge against McCarthy was provided with all the support that Spellman money could buy when he demanded that Sen. McCarthy be expelled from the Senate. Benton's name will forever be synonymous with Aaron Burr and wanton treason and sedition. Benton was closely associated with th e Fabian Socialist New Deal and his firm, Benton and Bowles got lucrative contr acts from the British Labor Government. Benton was also closely associated with the Rockefeller National Bureau of Economic Research (devoted to pushing Las ki's economic welfare state) and Owen Lattimore, one of the worst traitor s ever found in this country. This is the Benton who incredulously, asked McCarth y if he felt no shame about his investigation of the Army, which was essentiall y to root out Socialist treason mongers in the United States Government. Later, when it merged with the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Spellman donat- ed $3 million to Harold Laski's London School of Ec onomics which opened the doors for Socialism's entry into the highest circle s of the Government of the United States. Laura Spellman's money went into an intensive drive to introduce Marxist \"educational\" and \"economic\" programs into American schools and uni-"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The Female or the Species 105 versities. Millions of dollars went into these Soci alist programs, whose far reach- ing consequences we will probably never be able to measure, and which forever altered the shape and direction of education in thi s country. The one overriding obsession of these female Social ists was the destruction of the American tradition of the family. As Sir Pau l Dukes, one of the leading spe- cialists on Bolshevism in the 1920s said: \"The cent ral tragedy of the Bolshevik regime in Russia is an organized effort to subvert and corrupt the minds of chil- dren.. .It has always been a Bolshevik principle to fight the institution of the fam- ily. Madame Kollontay's writings can leave no doubt on that score, even in the mind of the skeptical. The idea was to remove child ren at avery early age from parental care and bring them up in colonies.\" The damage done by Eleanor Roosevelt has been told many times over and does not need to be retold here. Suffice to say tha t the so called feminist move- ment to which she devoted so much time in the 1920 and 1930s is thriving and has never been stronger than it is in the United St ates in 1994. Eleanor was the first to openly sanction lesbianism through her ill icit relations with Lorena Hicock, whose love letters are to be found in the H yde Park home of the Roosevelts. Perhaps the one event that showed us ju st how militant and powerful this Socialist activist group has become was the An ita Hill-Clarence Thomas struggle before a national audience of millions. Wh at is worth noting is the num- ber of so-called \"women's rights\" and \"feminist\" or ganizations that have sprung and mushroomed since the days of Eleanor Roosevelt. The names of individual Socialist leaders and their \"feminist\" organizations are legion like the demons mentioned in the Bible. It is not my intention to single out each and every one of them for special mention- that is beyond the scope of this book. Therefore, I am obliged to draw attentio n to only the top people in the female Socialist hierarchy, who have followed the S ocialist rule, penetrate and permeate. The stunning success of male Socialists i n penetrating every branch of the United States government, and local and State g overnment, permeating pri- vate institutions and organizations, would have bee n proudly hailed by Perkins, Kelley and Dorothy Whitney-Straight. They would have loved Barbara Streisand, a raucous- voiced \"entertainer\" whose counsel reaches right into the Clinton White House. It is a measure of how the United States has been dragged down to levels n ever imagined by the great statesmen of the past — Washington, Jefferson, Jack son — that Streisand actually \"sleeps over\" at the White House when she is in tow n. Streisand and Bella Abzug are like two peas in a pod. Strident, combative, de eply committed to Socialist/Marxist ideals, both live in luxury while pretending to speak for the poor. Abzug got herself appointed to the House of Represe ntatives, essentially on the Jewish bloc vote, and once there, she began to make her gratingly loud voice heard, especially in the so-called \"abortion rights \" issue, which I might add in"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"106 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship passing has no basis in law as it its outside the k en and the pale of the Constitution and is therefore, null and void. Abzug went around the halls of Congress literally s creaming at anyone who was against radical \"free love\" feminism. In this s he was assisted by one of the worst frauds in the feminism business, Norma McCorv ey, the \"Jane Roe\" of Roe vs. Wade. McCorvey wasn't even pregnant at the time the issue was raised. She was touted as a \"great scholar\" by the Abzug crowd when in fact her degree came from the unaccredited New College Law School in San Francisco, the same fem- inist organization that gave Anita Hill her law deg ree! Some, although not all of the radical feminist orga nizations are the following: The Margaret Bent Lawyers Achievement The American Civil Liberties Union National Women's Law Center New College Law School Ad Hoc Committee on Public Education on Sexual Hara ssment Alliance for Justice Center for Law and Special Policy National Organization for Women (NOW) Organization for the Advancement of Women Planned Parenthood National Abortion Rights Action League (NARL) Women's Legal Defense Fund The majority of these radical women's rights organi zations want to use the Constitution to protect them while they go about th eir business of Socializing the United States — a legacy handed down to them by Fel ix Frankfurter. From time to time they utter pious platitudes about protectio n of individual rights, ninety nine percent of which are not found in the Constitu tion, while advocating the overthrow of the very Constitution by which they ar e protected. The Socialist \"Maternity and Infancy Act\" introduce d by Florence Kelley, the forerunner of Bella Abzug was lifted straight out o f the Bolshevik system which Madame Zinoviev outlined for the world nationalizat ion of children. What Bella Abzug and Pat Schroeder call \"women's rights\" amoun t to nothing less than female anarchy and is not found in the Constitution of the United States. Most of what these female Socialist aspire to, comes from Alexandra Ko llontay's \"Communism and the Family, Bebel's \"Women and Socialism\" and Engel's \" Origin of the Family.\" So- called \"abortion rights\" come from this Bolshevik l iterature.

In Roe vs. Wade, the U .S. Supreme Court Justices violated the Constitution through lurid figments of their imagination. So-called \"women's rights activists\" have left no stone untur ned over the past two decades in seeking to enshrine \"rights\" in the Constitution wh ich are simply not there. The Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas case was a remarkabl e demonstration of the vast power these women's rights groups have gained since the days of the Roosevelt administration. The Senate, is Filled wit h Socialists of the worst stripe, Kennedy, Metzenbaum; Biden being its standard beare rs. There is a public per- ception mat needs to be corrected: The Senate does not have any court powers: it cannot put anyone on trial. Its powers are confined to an investigative role. It has no prosecutorial role. Looking at the Anita Hill-Cl arence Thomas affair, it was a quickly apparent that the Senate evidently complete ly forgot this restriction of its powers. The chief instigator of the confrontation was not H ill herself, but a group of abrasive, aggressive women who saw an opportunity t o make capital out of the overblown \"sexual harassment\" issue which had becom e their cause-celebre. The fact that this group was able to persuade the Senat e committee and a large seg- ment of the legislators that Hill was a victim of \" sexual harassment\" even though she had waited ten years before coming forward to m ake her charges, is an indi- cation of just how powerful \"women's rights\" advoca tes have grown. If one women could be singled out for this deplorab le state of affairs that would have been Nan Aaron. If any man could be sing led out for blame, it would have been Justice Warren Burger, the Socialist's dr eam of a judge who could always be relied upon to twist and squeeze the cons titution and add his own predilections in total defiance of the 9th Amendmen t to the United States Constitution. It is well worth a special mention that none of the Socialist judges who did the greatest damage to the constitution had any exp erience as judges before they were appointed to the Supreme Court. Louis Brandeis , John Marshall, Earl Warren, Byron White and William Rehnquist were not judges before their SOCIALIST credentials elevated them to the Supreme Court, from where they did the bidding of key Socialists infesting every level of government.

Of these, perhaps the most vicious was Totenberg, who had once been fired for plagiarism. Given to use the of foul language, Totenberg represents the wors t of what is wrong with the so- called \"feminists.\" In this she is ably backed by S enator Howard Metzenbaum, the best example of the worst of what is wrong with the Senate. The first assault on Thomas came with a leak that w as engineered by Aaron, Hoerchner and Lichtman who talked Hill into putting her alleged sexual harass- ment complaint in writing and sending it to the FBI . Hoerchner had been the first to call Hill in Oklahoma, not with standing that th e two had no contact for more than seven years. Hoechner was like George Bernard Shaw in that she was not shy about approaching anybody, even strangers whom she felt might benefit her. What these aggressive \"feminists\" feared was that H ill might not might come forward voluntarily to confront Judge Thomas. In that case, as the saying goes, \"we will have to bring her out\" using the tec hniques learned from the homosexual lobby whenever one of their number was r eluctant to own up to his homosexuality. By that time, Thomas had already undergone five day s of questioning, with Metzenbaum pulling his usual stunt of delaying conf irmation to see if any results would come from his muckraking squads. Finally, und er terrific pressure from Catherine McKinnon, a feminist activist legal \"scho lar,\" and principally through Lichtman, Hill broke, and was forced to make the ch arges the female radicals wanted, and which were immediately leaked. The rest is history, a fascinating account of the s avageness of the female of the Socialist species who would go to any lengths t o make a \"kill,\" though in this case their quarry, Judge Clarence Thomas, was able to outrun them. The entire operation, from the time that Hoerchner contacted H ill, and until the confirmation of Thomas, was run along the lines of psychopolitic s, the strategy that had served Socialism so well in England. Unfortunately, radical Socialist \"feminism\" is here to stay. There will be no let up in the activities of Amazons like Patricia S chroeder and heavy-weights Boxer and Feinstein. We shall witness these radical feminist legislators introduce all sorts of legislation not in consonance with or pursuant of the Constitution. We have already seen how Feinstein had a so-called ban on \"assault rifles\" accepted by the Senate. The fact that Feinstein's bill viola ted the Constitution in no less that three major places did not phase this female gladia tor one little bit. What has to be done is to train legislators in the Constitution , get them elected, and then coach them on how to counter and overturn any further enc roachment of our liberties, using the Constitution as the principal weapon. For this we need a foundation similar to the Fabian Socialist Society."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Subverting the Constitution Via the Legislative Rou te 109 5 SUBVERTING THE CONSTITUTION VIA THE LEGISLATIVE ROUTE It was Florence Kelley (Weschenewsky) who said that the United States Constitution was to be subverted by what she called , \"the legislative route\" and since her pronouncement. Socialists have gone overb oard in carrying out her directive. So far has this trammeling of the Consti tution gone, that in 1994, there is hardly a day passes without a judge, somewhere, reading his predelictions into the Constitution and making decisions that are outs ide of the pale and the ken of the Constitution. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the American Soc ialists groups said that the interpretive role of the judiciary was to be us ed to get around restrictions in the Constitution. The Socialists were also responsi ble for dreaming up so-called \"executive orders\" as a way to legislate in a direc t manner where it was not pos- sible to enact legalization sympathetic to Socialis t causes. Although the Ninth Amendment to the United States C onstitution was writ- ten with the express purpose of preventing judges f rom making their predelictions become law, by and large judges at all levels have ignored this restriction imposed upon them, and more and more, they are making laws that are clearly unconstitu- tional. Examples of this are so-called \"gun control \" laws, and restrictions on abor- tion protester groups. Kelley came into prominence when she translated int o English the rabid Socialist Engels' \"Condition of the Working Class i n England in 1844.\" This was the usual Socialist attack on capitalism. Engels wr ote several books, one of them a slashing attack on religion and another, \"Origin of the Family\" a diatribe against the sanctity of marriage. Engels toured the United States in 1884, and made no attempt to heed the warning of Edward Bellamy to av oid confrontations that pro- jected an image of Socialism as the home of sexual deviants, revolutionaries and anarchist. Apparently Americans in the 1800s were f ar better informed about Socialism than are Americans of the 1990s."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"110 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship It was not by happenstance that Kelley elected to r eceive her Socialist edu- cation in Switzerland, the long-time home for revol utionaries, anarchists, sexual deviants. Danton and Marat came from Switzerland to start the French Revolution. Lenin spent a considerable amount of ti me in that country before ven- turing out to London. Kelley started her crusade to subvert the United States Constitution by joining the New York Nationalist Cl ub, from where she launched her crusade to get the federal government to pass l aws that would control wages and conditions in factories. In pursuit of this goal, Kelley either formed her o wn fronts or joined other already in existence, such as the National Consumer s League which she tried to give Marxists overtones. Kelley called herself a \"M arxist-Quaker\" and she was also an American Fabian Socialist. We shall learn m ore about Kelley in succeed- ing chapters. She became a close friend of Harvard' s Professor Brandeis, from whom she learned a great deal about methodology to circumvent the Constitution, by the \"legislative route.\" Kelley worked with great energy to prepare the way for the \"Brandeis Brief that were to become the hallmark of Socialist judge s. What the \"Brandeis Brief was in essence a sheet or two of legal opinions att ached to huge bundles of care- fully-chosen Socialist propaganda on economic and s ocial issues. Needless to say, neither Brandeis nor his fellow judges were in the least bit qualified to interpret these slanted Socialist doctrines, so they were sim ply accepted as fact and written into judge's rulings. Around 1915, Kelley searchers world wide to gather informa- tion favorable to Socialism, which made up the bulk of the material that comprised \"Brandeis Brief court documents. It was a mammoth t ask, ably performed, one which was to change the way in which American juris prudence operated. \"Brandeis Briefs\" was a great triumph for Kelley an d her \"legislative route\" to altering and circumventing the Constitution. On the instructions of Mandel House, President Woodrow Wilson named agreed, was t o ensure the support of \"Progressive Republican\" Brandeis for the coming in volvement of the United States in WWII. It is worth restating what has alre ady been said, \"progressive,\" \"moderate\" Republicans means that the person using these labels is an out-and- out ardent Socialist, Another milestone in the history of Socialist trium phs over the judicial sys- tem of the United States came with the New York Sta te Lusk Laws. So-called \"immigrants\" from eastern Europe poured into New Yo rk in the 1800s, bringing with them combative attitudes and lots of revolutio nary experience. Many of these new arrivals worked in the garment trade. It was to investigate the revolu- tionary anarchist behavior of this large group from East Europe, that in 1919 the New York State legislature appointed Senator Clayto n R. Lusk to head a com- mittee of enquiry. One of the strongest \"immigrant\" support centers wa s the Rand School. A"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Subverting (he Constitution Via the Legislative Rou te 111 stronghold of American Fabian Socialists, Rand prov ided legal support for the garment workers trade union and a whole slew of oth er trade unions which Rand was instrumental in founding. Rand School lecturers and instructors read like a Fabian Socialist Whose Who. Lusk descended on Rand complete with search warrants and escorted by State Troopers, confiscate d records and files. The reaction by the Socialist legal fraternity was swift. A prominent lawyer, Samuel Untermeyer — who in 1933 declared war on Hit ler — and who had great influence around White House inner circles, sought and obtained an injunction against Lusk, who was forced to return the files an d records he had impounded. This was an early demonstration of the awesome powe r of Socialism in the United States. Nevertheless, following Sen Lusk's r eport, the New York legisla- ture passed what became known as the Lusk Laws, whi ch required all New York State schools to be licensed. The object of the exe rcise was to close Rand School. But the New York State legislators were not to be s uccessful. In the decade 1920-1930, few were familiar with Socialism as a vi rulent disease that could strike when and where it chose. Prominent Socialist attorney Morris Hillquit aroused such a violent agitation against the Lusk L aw among the powerful gar- ment workers and other Socialist-dominated trade un ions, that it was vetoed by Governor Al Smith. From this beginning grew a power ful political alliance that was to put Socialist Franklin Delano Roosevelt in t he White House. Once again, the Socialists had demonstrated that th eir stealthy sinister, scur- rilous policy of infiltrating their chosen disciple s as advisors to those in power, was the way to go. Years later it was discovered th at Governor Smith a staunch Catholic, had been \"advised on issues of social jus tice\" by Father John Augustin Ryan, an avowed Socialist planted on Smith by a Soc ialist-dominated National Catholic Welfare Council. It was on the advice of R yan that Smith vetoed the Lusk Law bill. A devout follower of Sydney Webb, Ryan went on to b ecome known as \"the padre of the New Deal.\" In 1939, a dinner in his ho nor (none of the rank and file members of the garment workers and other labor unio ns were invited) was attend- ed by Justices William O. Douglas, Felix Frankfurte r and Henry A Morganthau. Rand School continued to function without interrupt ion even though it was not licensed. What upset the Socialists in the 1920s when they we re attempting a virtual takeover of the United States, was the fact that th e Federal Government did not have absolute power. Only kings have absolute power and they issue proclama- tions. President Lincoln did not free the slaves in his emancipation proclamation. He knew it to be unconstitutional. \"Blackstone's Co mmentaries With Notes\" by the great constitutionalist St. George Tucker, a pr ofessor of law at the University of William and Mary who served in the American Revo lution, states the position very clearly:"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"112 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship \"The right of issuing proclamations is one of the p rerogatives of the crown of England. No such power being expressly given in the federal constitution, it was doubted, upon a particular occasion whether the president possessed any such authority under it...\" The Socialists decided that in future, proclamations would be called \"executive orders\" but they remain legisl ation by fiat, forbidden by the United States Constitution. The first ten amendments to the United States Const itution are a restriction on the Federal Government with perhaps, a small exc eption contained in the 5th Amendment. Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution does not permit the federal government to legislate outside of its delegated po wers which are contained in the Primary powers of Congress. Frustrated by Bill Of Rights restrictions on federa l government powers, the Socialists went on the offensive \"by the legislativ e route.\" What they could not achieve through the House and Senate was achieved v ia the courts, which is why we have so many unconstitutional laws on the statut e books. There is no doubt that had the Socialists not been blocked by the Con stitution, they would have overwhelmed the country between 1920 and 1930. Unhappily, since the 1970s, the Congress and the pr esident have opted to implement Social programs in greater numbers each y ear. One example of this is, \"A Bill to Establish National Voter Registration\" o ffered by Senator Robert Dole, the Senate minority leader. Dole's bill is 100 perc ent unconstitutional, and it is a sad day for the United States when we see the minor ity leader of the United States Senate acting in such a thoroughly irresponsible ma nner. The details of Dole's bill can be found in pages S5012 — D5018, Congressional Record, April 24, 1991, No. 61, Vol. 137. Dole's bill is wrong because it flies in the face o f Article 1, Section 4, Part 1 of the United States Constitution which states: \"Th e time, place and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the legislators thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing Senators.\" The debates on this issue go back to the earliest days of our C onfederated Republic. The words, \"may\" does not mean \"must\" or \"shall.\" T he word \"manner\" simply refers to the type of ballotused. The words \"alter\" and \"regulate\" does not mean control over State elections by the Federal Go vernment which Dole should be aware of if he has read the Congressional Globes and Annals of Congress. Dole tries to get the Federal Government embroiled in ma tters that are reserved to the States. This is a common expedient resorted to by a ll Socialists. Wilson started the this kind of rot, and his mantle was picked up by Roosevelt, Kennedy, Johnson Eisenhower, Bush and no w Clinton.

The Brandeis Briefs were mainly responsible for pointing the Sup reme Court in the wrong direction. As explained elsewhere, the Briefs were masses of sociological position papers highly favorable to Socialist causes, covere d by the thinnest of legal opin- ion. Thus was \"sociological law\" born, which has be en a curse and a baleful evil around the necks of the American people ever since it was instituted in 1915. Apart from the attack on the Constitution via the c ourts, the Socialist resort- ed to the strategy of sending their \"advisors\" to a ct as spokesmen for U.S. foreign policy, even though they were not representatives o f the government nor elected to office by the people.

We were always warned to look out for \"Communists\" in Washington, and this suc- ceeded in taking our gaze off the real cause for co ncern; the Socialists. Socialist ranks are filled with key educators, part icularly at the level of profes- sors and college presidents. They are in the diplom atic service, in the United States State Department, in the House of Representatives a nd the Senate. The Justice Department overflows with those who are ready to do anything to promote Socialism. Key banking positions are filled by them , they control the money of the nation and there are thousands more in key position s in the military. Some of the most powerful international corporations act as cha nge agents of Fabian Socialism. Fabian Socialists are in the communications busines s, occupying key posts, and likewise in the news media, print and electroni c. They make public opinion to suit the events of the day, seducing the public and creating opinions which the public has been conditioned to accept as their own. In short, Socialism is so entrenched in the United States of America that it would be difficult to dislodge, unless the whole support of the whole people were f irst obtained. Fabian Socialists have so penetrated and permeated the Chr istian Church, that today, it is utterly unrecognizable from what Christ intended.

In other equally important areas, a host of professors have acted as advisors to Presidents of the United States; others have changed the American system of political economy from what the Founding Fathers intended it to be, to a Babylonian system that has illegally placed the purse strings of the nation in hands of Socialist aliens. A more select band of Fabian Socialists became cont rollers of five United States presidents; a situation which was not envisa ged by the Founding Fathers, and in consequence, one which created an especially dangerous camarilla which gradually led to the highest political office in th e nation becoming penetrated and permeated, with great corruption following, which w e are now seeing in full mea- sure in the Clinton Presidency. The one name that most readily comes to mind in thi s context and which typ- ifies Socialism in America in the minds of serious researchers, is Colonel Edward Mandel House. \"Colonel\" was an honorary title, gran ted to him by \"reformist\" Governor Hogg as a reward for getting him elected G overnor of Texas. House met Woodrow Wilson, the first openly Socialist future P resident of the United States in 1911. It was House who ensured Wilson got the no mination at the Democrat convention in Baltimore a scant year later. As mentioned elsewhere, there is a strong suspicion that House was really Huis, of Dutch descent. His father, Thomas William House was the agent for the London Rothschilds. House Sr. was the only one in T exas to come out of the Civil War with a huge fortune, thanks, some historians sa y, to his Rothschild and Kuhn, Loeb connections. The name \"Mandel\" — a distinctly Dutch name — is said to have been given to Edward, because one the Kuhn's b ore the name \"Mandel.\" Young Edward was sent to school in England, where h e came under the influence of wealthy Liberal thinkers of the day, t hemselves strongly under the influence of British Fabian Society teachers. One o f those who befriended young House was the Fabianist George Lansbury. Upon the d eath of his father, House found himself independently wealthy, which allowed him to devote his time fully to Socialist studies, particularly in \"gradualism\" or, \"making haste slowly.\" Because of the great influence of the wealthy and t he powerful in the Fabian Society circles, House learned the lessons well and went on to take over the Democrat Party in the United States from the top do wn. The rise of House as a key player in American affairs, was undoubtedly due to the recommendations made by the Fabian Society elite and Sir William Wi seman, British intelligence MI6 North American station chief. Throughout the Wi lson presidency, Wiseman and British intelligence carefully rode herd over t he president, always through the good offices of House.

According to confidential documents I saw in several places in London, Wiseman eaves dropped constantly on House-Wilson conver- sations, as befitted his status as Wilson's ultimat e controller. We know that much the same, highly successful \"mode l\" was later used by Bruce Lockhart, the British M16 agent selected by L ord Milner to be Lenin and Trotsky's controller in overseeing the Bolshevik Re volution in the interests of free trade and British banking. MI6 strategy for United States used Hegelian principles in convincing Fabian Society leaders to help to induce \"free trade\" with the United States, something that had been barred, first by Pr esident George Washington in July, 1789, and kept in place by Presidents Lincoln, Garf ield and McKinley. William Jennings Bryan was at one time considered b y MI6 as a possible free trade candidate, but was rejected because it was pe rceived that by his radical statements, the American voters would not accept hi m as presidential material, an assessment that proved to be highly accurate. Wisem an had given House a detailed profile of Wilson's career, first as a pro fessor at Princeton from 1902 to 1910, and then, as Governor of New Jersey. Wiseman felt that Wilson was just the man House needed to carry out Fabian Socialist poli cies in the United States. With all of the background checks completed, House was instructed to meet with Wilson at the Hotel Gotham in New York, in November of 1911. From then onwards it was \"all systems go\" with Hous e setting up shop in unpretentious, rented quarters in a somewhat run-do wn East Thirty-Fifth street location in New York City. The House \"office\" began to look like a command center, with a switchboard and a direct line to Sir William Wiseman, who was occupying an apartment directly above him. After Wi lson was elected to the White House by a minority vote (6,286,000 as agains t the combined Taft- Roosevelt count 7,700,000) the House-Wiseman switch board had direct access to the new president via a coded telephone link. There were many prominent Socialist visitors to the House office, including Bernard Baruch, to whom MI6 gave the incriminating Peck letters — later to be used to blackmail Wilson into changing his anti WWI stance. Wiseman was a favorite of the President and became one of Wilson' s \"confidential\" messengers between London, Paris and Washington, which to a ce rtain extent, showed that Wilson really did not understand just how much he w as under the control of agents of a foreign government. Wilson was chosen by MI6 to bring down United State s barriers against \"free trade. \"His mentor, Col. House, had taught Wilson t o regard trade barriers tariffs as a bar to good global business and a primary caus e of prices having risen sharply alongside alleged \"inflation,\" all just so much Socialist hot-air propagan- da. House spent endless hours briefing Wilson on th e inherent \"evils of tariff bar- riers that benefited only the rich and the powerful vested interests at the cost of the working man.\" Then Wilson was ready to make his false claims:"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"118 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship \"...We were living under at a tariff which had been purposely contrived to confer private favors upon those who were co-operat ing to keep the party that originated it in power...\" The Clinton administration was to use the almost id entical spurious argu- ments to make out a case for bringing down the last of the tariff wall that had pro- tected the young nation for so long and made its co mmerce and industry, its liv- ing standards, the envy of the world. Following clo se on the heels of Wilson's inauguration in March of 1913, the battle to topple United States trade barriers was joined. Yet, even one of Harvard's top professo rs in economics dismissed the presumptions that trade barriers were bad for the c ommon people as being with- out substance. House had done his job well: It was not for nothing that his friends called him \"a pronounced radical whose Socialism opened th e door to Communism,\" this in reference to the role House played in secur ing the release of Trotsky after Wiseman had intervened on behalf of the pro-Bolshev ik Revolution plotter, Lord Alfred Milner. House was by his own account, an ard ent admirer of Karl Marx and a hater of the United States Constitution. One of the toughest assignments given to House by W iseman, concerned the \"neutrality\" stance adopted by the Wilson administr ation toward the war raging in Europe. Allegedly \"pacifists,\" the Fabian Socialist s were used by MI6 to get Wilson to change his mind, via blackmail (the Peck letters ) and a climate for war was cre- ated by outright lies upon lies told to the America n people. In this endeavor, MI6 co-opted the services of Walter Lippmann, to whom w e shall be returning. As WWI was ending, House was selected by his Britis h MI6 and Fabian Socialist controller Sydney Webb to be the mouthpie ce for Wilson at the Paris Peace Conference, allegedly on the basis of the mas terful House report speedily produced after just two days \"in seclusion\" at Magn olia, his summer home in Massachusetts. But the facts spoke otherwise. What was to become known as \"Wilson's Fourteen Points\" which was to have establ ished a One World Government League of Nations \"to take charge of all nations and overrule their sovereignty\" (including the United States) was actu ally a Fabian Society docu- ment first drafted in 1915 by British Socialist lea der, Leonard Woolf. Entitled \"International Government\" the Fabian Soci ety treatise was pre- sented to the British Government for acceptance. Th e British Government later passed it to Wilson, who did not bother to open it before forwarding it to House in Massachusetts. This then, was the \"Fourteen Poin ts\" which House was sup- posed to have drafted with the help of Professor Da vid Miller. This incident points up the close, domineering relationship that existed between the British govern- ment, House and Wilson. Wilson presented his \"Fourteen Points Plan\" to the Paris Peace Conference, which promptly rejected it. A bitterly hurt Wilson returned to the United States,"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Brightest Stars in the American Socialist Firmament 119 the long-standing friendship between House and hims elf beginning to come apart at the edges. It was a signal triumph for the Const itution: Neither House nor Wilson had breached it in Paris. There after, the t wo men drifted apart, their seem- ingly endearing friendship wrecked on the Constitut ion of the United States of America. In keeping with the Fabian Society's teachings, Hou se was always a forward- looker. In 1915 his attention had been drawn to Fra nklin D. Roosevelt, Wilson's Assistant Secretary of the Navy. House arranged thr ough discreet circles for a copy of \"Philip Dru\" to find its way into the hands of the dashing Roosevelt. It is said that the book had a profound effect on the alr eady committed Socialist Roosevelt who was destined to succeed Wilson. In 19 20, House told friends, \"I am certain he (Roosevelt) will be the next presiden t of the United States.\" Roosevelt's record as Governor of New York and the innovative (Socialist) pro- grams he introduced, left no one in doubt about the direction he would take America if elected to the White House. In this resp ect, then former Governor Clinton of Arkansas is a carbon copy of Roosevelt i n Socialist methodology. When Roosevelt was elected the event was hailed by Socialists large and small on both sides of the Atlantic as an act of \"p rovidence.\" As is usually the case, such acts of \"providence\" do not bear close s crutiny, and this one was no exception. Once again, the astute political observa tions of Colonel House were about to bear fruit. Roosevelt was to launch and bo ost Socialism to new heights in America, a fitting successor to President Wilson . That Roosevelt owed his pres- idency to House was never disputed; only kept out o f the public view, lest the timely act of \" providence\" be shown to have a huma n face. A friend of Roosevelt's mother, House was quick to notice the good Socialist legislation passed by the Governor of New York Stat e. The friendship that devel- oped was also partly the work of Frances Perkins. H ouse had recommended Roosevelt to Wilson for the post of Assistant Secre tary of the Navy in the Wilson administration, and handed Roosevelt the \"fireside chats\" radio approach to win- ning over the American people and coached Roosevelt on how to create uncon- stitutional \"executive orders,\" i.e., proclamations which only kings and queens have the right to issue. House will go down in history as the man who change d the way presidents make their decisions and carry them out, by surroun ding them with informal advi- sors, who, not being public servants, are hard to g et a handle on. The informal advisor slippery Socialist system has done more dam age to the nation than the people could ever begin to imagine. This aspect, mo re than any other of House's achievements, set him aside as the leading warrior of Socialism in the first quar- ter of the 20th century. Roosevelt was presented to the American as an affab le, likable highly com- petent man with a \"wonderful smile\" etc etc. How mu ch truth was there in this"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"120 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship propaganda? Apparently not very much. In 1926 when House thought Roosevelt would be the next president, the man with a \"wonder ful smile\"was not even able to earn enough to take care of his family. Roosevel t ran as a candidate for the New York Senate on a Ku Klux Klan ticket. His much publ icized \"polio\" was actually encephalomyelitis, which fact was hidden from the p ublic. Propaganda specialists turned his \"infantile paralysis\" into a plus by por traying Roosevelt as a man of high courage, determined not to let \"polio\" stop hi s career. The only problem? It was all completely false. Perhaps nothing is quite so much identified with Ro osevelt as the \"New Deal\" and Harry Hopkins. The \"New Deal\" Socialist program was cleverly couched as a \"relief program for workers who were stricken by th e Depression. In fact, the \"New Deal\" was the book \"A New Deal,\" written by St uart Chase, a British Fabian Society member which did not attract much attention , although Florence Kelley who liked Chase and his Socialist ideals, rated it as an important work. Chase proposed that three major steps be taken by S ocialists in America: 1. To obviate accidental inflation and deflation, the dollar was to be \"managed,\" 2. The national income to be forced-redistributed thro ugh increased income and inheritance taxes, 3. A vast public works program was to be instituted, p articularly in electrifica- tion works (based on the Soviet model) and large sc ale housing projects. Roosevelt adopted the project in-toto and it became the \"New Deal\" which was adopted as the Democrat election plank in 1932. The \"New Deal\" was couched in obfuscation, and a panic-stricken public , seeing in it their salvation, gave the Democrats an overwhelming election victory in 1932. Roosevelt soon became vulnerable to such unelected advisors as the Rockefellers whose malodorous presence was usually concealed by the likes of Drew Pearson and Walter Winchell among others. Late r, when the Rockefellers became bolder, Roosevelt appointed Nelson Rockefell er as Coordinator of Inter American Affairs. During his time in office, Nelson squandered more than $6 mil- lion of the taxpayers money on what were strictly, Rockefeller enterprises in Latin America. When Roosevelt went to the White House, he took a w hole panoply of unap- pointed advisors with him, including more professor s than Wilson had surround- ed himself with. The rationale behind this was that the American public was less likely to suspect \"Socialists\" lurking behind acade mic facades than appointed officials, and this proved to be the case during Ro osevelt's earlier years in office. With this purpose in mind, and bearing in mind that long-range planning was a key element among the Fabian Socialists, Harold Sta ssen was planted on the University of Pennsylvania, Edward Stettinus on the University of Virginia and General Dwight Eisenhower was planted on Columbia U niversity. Secret \"advisors\" were also responsible for getting Roosevelt to retrieve"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Brightest Stars in the American Socialist Firmament 121 Standard oil property taken over by the Japanese us ing American troops for this purpose, the so-called Stimson doctrine. This doctr ine was repeated by President George Bush in the Gulf War which was fought to ret rieve British Petroleum oil property seized by Iraq. The way that Alger Hiss wa s introduced into the Roosevelt administration is classic Fabian Socialist text-boo k material. In 1936, Hiss was invited to serve in the State Department by Profess or Francis Sayre, Wilson's son in law. Sayre had long been recognized as a valuabl e Socialist property. Sayre assisted in the preparation of legal document s for the defense of Sacco and Vanzetti two notorious Socialists accused of mu rder. Working with Sayer were Professor Arthur M. Schlesinger, Professor Fel ix J. Frankfurter, Roscoe Pound, Dean of the Harvard Law School and Louis Bra ndeis. Arthur Schlesinger Jr., was educated at Cambridge University in 1938, where he was very warmly welcomed with open arms by the Fabian Society. This was at the time when all efforts by law enforcement agencies and the Congres s to arrest and deport a wave of anarchists who had come to the United States in the 1890s was mockingly called \"overreaction to the Red scare.\" Sayre was one of those who defended Hiss, long afte r it was apparent that Hiss was deeply involved in espionage against his c ountry. When Adolph Berle of the State Department tried to warn Roosevelt abo ut Hiss' activities, he was brusquely told to mind his own business. Likewise, Roosevelt refused to listen to intelligence reports about the activities of Owen L attimore, and insisted on appointing him as his personal advisor to Chiang Ka i Shek, which left Lattimore in the enviable position of easily betraying the Na tionalists to the Communists. The Chinese Nationalist forces were further betraye d by Roosevelt appointee Lauchlin Currie, who ordered Army supplies intended for the Chiang Kai Shek's Nationalist forces dumped into the Indian Ocean. Harry Hopkins became to Roosevelt what Edward Mande l House had been to Wilson. A protege of Frances Perkins, Hopkins began his career as a social worker, who got close to Roosevelt through his wife, Eleano r, and is wrongly credited with the New Deal slogan, \"tax and spend, tax and spend. \" Hopkins came into his own in the Depression as Roosevelt's nominee for handing o ut so-called \"federal\" relief, i.e. welfare. A scarecrow of a man who clothes hung on h im, and totally lacking in social graces, Hopkins would have looked sadly out of plac e in a room with John Maynard Keynes. What Hopkins knew about was corn. His great est asset was selecting peo- ple with \"clout\" and insinuating himself into their circles. It was this talent that made Roosevelt put Hopkins in charge of the 1940 Democrat Convention. Hopkins, despite his unlucky a ppearance, was able to rack up the support of the most powerful politicians of the day. Roosevelt is known to have personally approved an article by Arthur M. Sc hlesinger Jr. printed in the \"Partisan Review\" in which Schlesinger attacked tho se who were investigating the true causes of the Civil War. This should not s urprise the well informed. As"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"122 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship previously mentioned, Communism and Socialism were much more prevalent in the run up to that war, and more so during and imme diately after the Civil War, than orthodox history allowed. This fact was deemed undesirable by Schlesinger and his fellow Socialists, who wanted the public to believe the established histo- rian's account of the causes of the war — which, wi thout exception — did not mention the part played by Communism and Socialism. It was Arthur J. Schlesinger Jr., who called anarch ists Sacco and Vanzetti \"two obscure immigrants about whom nobody cared.\" A rthur Schlesinger Jr., did extensive work for the ACLU on behalf of these two anarchists. Schlesinger went on to write scores of articles for the \"Fabian News \" in which he pushed Socialists ideas. In one such article published in the \"Fabian International Review,\" Schlesinger quite openly said that it was the inten tion of the American Socialists to gain outright control of the military and foreig n policies of the United States. The judges who twisted and squeezed the constitutio n to make their predilec- tions fit the goals desired by Socialists, and who found their schemes blocked by the immutable Constitution are the brightest stars in the Socialist firmament, for without their willingness to corrupt themselves and defile their oath of office, none of the far reaching \"popular\" Socialist \"refor ms\" that were so important in changing the course and direction of the mighty Uni ted States, would have been successful. The process of electing good, robust Fabian Sociali st judges to the United States Supreme Court really began with the Wilson a dministration and the appointment of Justice Louis D. Brandeis as one of the most important Fabian Socialist properties. As an examination of the reco rd of Brandeis reveals, the Fabian Socialist hierarchy at home and abroad, chos e wisely. Brandeis did more to undermine the Constitution and steer difficult S ocialist legislation around and past it, than even Florence Kelley could have hoped for. Professor Louis Dembitz Brandeis (1856-1941) fitted perfectly the Socialist idea of a Justice who would look favorably upon a \" new constitution\" as spelled out by Edward Bellamy. It was Bellamy who proposed a \"new declaration of independence\" based upon an evolutionary interpreta tion of the Constitution of the United States with a Judiciary that would insti tute \"sweeping changes\" and bring an end to the roadblock of separation of powe rs of the three branches of government. Bellamy called the Constitution, one de vised by the well meaning, but sadly outdated Founding Fathers. President Wilson himself was greatly in favor of wr ecking the Constitution of the United States which he had faithfully sworn to uphold, and in Brandeis he found a kindred spirit. Brandeis had sat at the fee t of the Fabian Society philoso- pher, John Atkins Hobson, believed to be the origin ators of the \"Brandeis Brief,\" although Kelley always claimed the credit. Hopkins certainly originated the future strategy of surrounding incoming Presidents of the United States with"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Brightest Stars in the American Socialist Firmament 123 Socialist professor advisors, a strategy that has w orked remarkably well in the Socialist war on the Constitution, initiated by Fel ix Frankfurter, Louis Brandeis, Harold Laski and John Maynard Keynes. These four Fa bian Socialists changed the course and direction of the United States to th e total detriment of We, the People, in a manner far beyond what Hitler, Stalin and Ho Chi Minh could ever have achieved. Early in his legal career, Brandeis teamed up with the formidable Florence Kelley, without whose help he would not have been a ble to make use of a strata- gem dreamed up in the think tanks of the London Fab ian Society and perfected by British Socialist Hobson, that later bore the ti tle of \"Brandies Briefs.\" Kelley, with her devotion to the Socialist cause of getting around the Constitution by what she called \"the legislative route\" midwifed the new -born \"Brandeis Brief baby, that was to almost make her dream of ushering in to tal Socialist control of the United States became a reality. Brandeis had a niece by the name of Josephine Goldm ark who was Kelley's biographer and she explained how the Brief was prep ared in 1907. It was not a complicated process, but one that took a great deal of time and energy to com- plete. All manner of sociological datas were assemb led and appended to a one and a halfs page of legal argument. As the British Army drill sergeants used to say, \"bullshit baffles brains\" and that is exactly what the Brandeis Briefs did when presented to the Supreme Court in 1909. Another notorious Socialist, Felix Frankfurter, cal led the new scheme, \"the most majestic concept in our whole constitutional s ystem\" which allowed justices to read their own predilections into the Constituti on in cases before them, that is predilections forbidden by the 9th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Nevertheless, this method became standard p ractice, which helps to explain why so many Supreme Court decisions have be en in so many instances, unadulterated \"B...

A compatriot in conspiracies of the Socialist kind with Professor Harold Laski, Frankfurter would bide his time in true Fabian Soci alist manner, and strike hard when the time came. Of all the American Socialists who admired Graham Wallas, the British Fabian Socialist professor at the Londo n School of Economics, Frankfurter stood at the head of the line. The failure of the New World Order to materialize a t the Paris Peace Conference was largely due to the American public, who were disgusted with the rash of radicals who had appeared with the coming o f the Wilson administration.

Moreover, in 1919 there was no unlimited use of opi nion polls, to make up people' s minds for them. What we have in the Ameri ca of the 1990s is a totally different picture: a drastic change in the populati on makeup from overwhelming- ly Western European Christian to a hodgepodge of ev ery race on earth, Chinese, Indian Asians, Vietnamese, Eastern Europeans, Hispa nics etc, in which the White Christian race is fast being submerged. In 1919 a u nified people were demanding action against the subversive elements rearing thei r ugly heads across the American landscape, and they got it in 1919-1920, w hen Attorney General Mitchell Palmer ordered a series of raids to stamp out centers of sedition. Brandeis immediately showed that his sympathies lay with the Socialists who were trying to overturn the United States Const itution, by joining a brief filed by Frankfurter and Walter Lippmann which soug ht an injunction against searches of the hundreds of Socialist subversive ce nters. The police officers con- ducting the raids were verbally abused by Lippmann, who appeared at the scene of some of the raids, with a whole pack of Socialis t writers. Not that Brandeis had an easy ride through the Sena te confirmation process. Inasmuch that the senators in 1915 knew a great dea l more about the United States Constitution than they do today, Wilson's ch oice for the Supreme Court was hotly contested, but to no avail. The Democrat Party majority saw to it that this dangerous, passionate revolutionary was appoin ted. The damage done to the United States Constitution by this ardent, passiona te Socialist is still being tallied. Neither Hitler nor Stalin could ever have caused so much havoc. Brandeis was one of the first Justices to become in volved in New Deal poli- tics. His friend Florence Kelley gave him a copy of a book by Stuart Chase, sim- ply entitled \"A New Deal\" which Chase thought would be good for the future of British and American Socialism's plans, a view with which Sydney Webb and the hierarchy of the Fabian Society concurred. On the u rging of Brandeis and Kelley, \"A New Deal\" quickly replaced the 1932 Democrat pla t form, and in 1933, became Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"New Deal.\" It is interesting to note the views of Chase, who w as not averse to violent anarchy and Socialist revolutionary action: \"It (revolution) may one day be necessary. I am not seriously alarmed by the sufferings of the creditor class, the trouble the c hurch is bound to encounter, the restrictions of certain kinds of freedom which may result, nor even by the blood- shed of the transition period.

Instead, he advocate d a collective-style govern- ment through national control by a central governme nt, along the lines of Webb's \"Labour and the New Social Order.\" Chase was a mild -mannered, yet very dan- gerous radical, whose ideas are in the main largely incorporated in the structure of a One World Government-New World Ordff now being ushered in. The organizations and personalities who paid for an d sponsored Chase's book were loosely connected to Moscow's ex-officio ambassador Ludwig Martens. Maartens was very close to the far Left So cialist magazine, \"the Nation,\" and Edward A. Filene, who reportedly met t he cost of printing the book in the United States through the Twentieth Century Fund, a Fabian Socialist finan- cial angel. Chase was very friendly with both Kelle y and Brandeis, and once described the Bolshevik Revolution as having been \" absolutely necessary.\" When Franklin Delano Roosevelt stepped into the White Ho use \"A New Deal\" became the \"New Deal,\" one of the most far-reaching piece of Fabian Socialist legislation ever to darken the pages of American history. Roosevelt's pathway to the White House was consider ably smoothed by Felix Frankfurter. Bom in Vienna, Austria, this almost dw arf-like, dome-head child was brought to the United States at the age of twelve. Frankfurter used his obvious intel- ligence to champion every Socialist cause that was at variance with the Founding Father's concept of the United States. One of the a venues of approach to Socializing the United States was through the American Civil Li berties Union, (ACLU) of which Frankfurter, Rose Schneiderman and Roger Bald win were founders, and which was established for the sole purpose of makin g mischievous use of the Constitution to defend Socialist enemies of the Con stitution. The ACLU was founded with the avowed intention of \" twisting and squeez- ing\" the Constitution to protect the enemies of the United States bent upon its destruction. There can be no questioning the truth that the perverted practice of using the Constitution for the benefit of the enemi es of the Republic came out of the domed head of Frankfurter. Out of the mind of this \"Gnome of the Courts\" was bom the belief, propagated by the likes of Lippmann, Sc hlesinger and a host of Harvard law professors, that it was somehow unpatriotic to defend the United States against its avowed Socialist enemies, of which Frankfurter stood at the head. Leader of the Socialist enemies of the United State s as he was, Frankfurter thought it was publicly acceptable to protect the a nointed one who would soon be in the White House. At the instigation of the Fa bian Society, Frankfurter set up a think tank of noted Socialists to advise and h elp Roosevelt over difficult bumps and humps in the Socialist road to the White House. Arising for his con- cerns that \"New Deal Roosevelt\" do the right things at the right time, Frankfurter met with Roosevelt in a private meeting immediately after Roosevelt's inaugu- ration ceremony."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"126 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship In this endeavor, Frankfurter was greatly assisted by Harold Ickes who put together a large band of spies to cover Washington and other large metropolitan centers. This group became known as \"Harold's Gesta po\" though \"Cheka\" would have been more appropriate, since they were able to exert tremendous pressure on local and State officials to vote for Roosevelt. Ic kes remained a close confidant of Roosevelt and was responsible for breaking the unwr itten law established by President George Washington that presidents were to serve only two terms. Also in attendance was Fabian Socialist Fred C. How e, whose name was later to become a household word in Socialist circl es on both sides of the Atlantic. Together, they chose the personnel who were to occu py key positions in the Roosevelt administration, especially in the State D epartment. This set a pattern which was to become a part of the scenery, whether a Republican or Democrat sat in the Oval Office. For instance, in the Reagan adm inistration, 3,000 key posi- tions were filled by Heritage Foundation nominees. Ostensibly a \"conservative\" think tank, the Heritage Foundation was run from be hind the scenes by Sir Peter Vickers Hall, a leading member of the Fabian Societ y and a committed Socialist. Although Cordell Hull was the nominal Secretary of State in the Roosevelt administration, it was \"Felix and his boys,\" among them the traitor Alger Hiss, who were in command, a situation which Hull tolerat ed for 12 years. As Frankfurter was to admit in later years, his idea c ame from the British Privy Council system of advisers to the prime minister of England. In any event, two years after Roosevelt had entered the Oval Office, Ickes, Wallace, Hopkins and Frankfurter were the string pullers who acted from behind the Rand School of Social Sciences, the very one the New York authorit ies had tried to put out of busi- ness as a center of Socialist and Communist subvers ion against the United States. Frankfurter, a leader in the field of Socializing t he United States, proved his worth by getting public service utilities into the hands of municipalities which led up to the Tennessee Valley Authority Project (TVA). Passed off as an anti-depres- sion move, the TVA was in reality one of the first advances toward socializing projects of this magnitude — a huge victory for Ame rican Socialists and their British controllers. As Mark Starr wrote: \"As Socia lism collectivism, public own- ership and control becomes necessary in the United States, they will be adopted in specific instances and cases. It may be called b y some other name, but, as in the case of the Tennessee Valley Authority, public ownership will be applied...\" Frankfurter continued to encourage leftwing penetra tion of government and one of the several front organizations he sponsored was the World Youth Congress Movement. A number of individuals associat ed with this Fabian Socialist enterprise were described as dangerous Co mmunist subversives by a Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security. But perha ps his most damaging blow was his support of his protege and life-long friend , Dean Acheson, whom he insinuated into Johnson's inner circle of advisors."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Brightest Stars in the American Socialist Firmament 127 The Dies Committee investigating Communism in the U nited States said that Professor Harold Laski, John Maynard Keynes and Fel ix Frankfurter were the entente terrible of American Socialism, an idea tha t was scoffed at by Roosevelt when it was drawn to his attention. But there could be no doubting that the legal language for all New Deal legislation was drafted b y Frankfurter. It should not be over looked that it was Frankfurter who recommended Dean Acheson, and Oliver Wendell Holmes to serve Roosevelt, and two more tre asonous subversives would have been impossible to find, the one serving in th e State Department, the other on the Supreme Court. More than any other single Socialist, past or prese nt, whether in England or the United States, there is general agreement that the greatest of them all in preparing the way for Socializing America was undou btedly the dome-headed near-dwarf, Felix Frankfurter. Of him it can be sai d that he did his utmost to break down the protective tariffs erected by Washington, guide the Federal Reserve into position and push Wilson into committing to England 's WWI. A close associate of Walter Lippmann, Paul Warburg, Thomas W. Lamont and the key Socialist leaders of the day, Frankfurter w as well placed to work his appalling treason against the United States which had given h im and his family sanctuary when they were virtually forced out of Europe. If ever t here was a prime candidate to fit the saying, \"he bit the hand that fed him,\" that ca ndidate was Justice Felix Frankfurter, who almost single-handedly, perverted the Constitution and got close to rendering that great document a blank piece of pape r. Frankfurter wrote the majority of Roosevelt's \"fire side chats\" radio broad- casts, one of the most successful tools for penetra tion and permeation ever devised. He had a hand in Roosevelt's decision to s end Harry L. Hopkins to England to lay the groundwork for the greatest heis t on earth: the so-called Lend- Lease Act. But probably the most tremendous damage that Frankfurter was to do was his gradual (in true Fabian style) intrusion of the Court into the legislative branch of government, thus beginning the insidious practice of the gradual diminution of the powers of the Congress and increa sing those of the Supreme Court and the President. Frankfurter was the man wh o almost made Professor Laski's dream of breaching and destroying the separ ation of powers come true. That this was 100 percent unconstitutional did not seem to bother the little gnome of the Court. Thus, thanks to the treachery a nd sedition of Frankfurter, which he carried on throughout his life, the Britis h Fabian Society was at last beginning to see some light in the dark tunnel they were construction under the walls of the separation of powers, identified by La ski as the most serious obsta- cle to Socialism's progress in the United States. F rankfurter maintained close con- tact with the wrecker of Western economies, John Ma ynard Keynes, and arranged for publication of \"The Economic Consequences of Pe ace\" in which Keynes pre- dicted that capitalism in Europe was dying."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"128 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship While Frankfurter wrote vigorous papers dissenting and decrying law enforcement raids by Attorney General Mitchell Palm er that began to take place on seditious movements in the United States, it was Lippmann who did the \"on location\" attacks. Lippmann was a leading member of the Roosevelt \"brain trust\" group that pelted the President with Socialist prop osals. Congressman McFadden accused Frankfurter of being one of the original fo rmulators of the National Industrial Recovery Act. McFadden stated, \"it requi red 15 years of hard effort on the part of Mr. Baruch and his associates (one of t hem being Frankfurter) to foist this act upon the American people, and it was only through the sufferings over a period of great stress that he was enabled to do it ...\" \"...However, Baruch, Johnson, Tugwell, Frankfurter et. al. seem to be the most brazen in their efforts (in behalf of Socialis m) in this country.

The 'new deal' lawyers have no hesitation in appearing in court an d asserting that private citizens can contract away their Constitutional rights. It h as been through this method that they have broken down State lines...\" It is a well-known fact that Frankfurter virtually assumed the position of employment agency for the Roosevelt administration. Among the most dangerous of the Socialists recommended to Roosevelt by Frank furter were the notorious Rexford Tugwell, and Governor Al Smith of New York. Frankfurter's close ties to Harold Laski was the su bject of intense interest in Socialist circles in London and Washington. Laski w as a regular house guest at the Boston and Washington homes of Frankfurter. As fellow Socialists, the men had a profound effect on each other and both worked tirelessly to weaken the sep- aration of powers mandated by the Constitution. The ir letters to each other were addressed, \"Dearest Felix\" and \"Dearest Harold.\" Be ing at the very heart of Fabian Socialism in London, Laski was able to keep his \"dearest Felix\" fully posted about the latest Socialist thinking, which F rankfurter then conveyed to Roosevelt, whose door was always open to him. The t wo \"privy counselors\" became the most influential shapers of Roosevelt's Socialist policies during his three terms in office. The deciding factor in the United Nations Treaty ca me from Frankfurter, Laski and Keynes, although drafted by others, and i t represented another brick removed from the wall separating constitutional pow ers. Historians of the period 1942-1946 say that the United Nations treaty was th e first of many big moves into the legislature by the executive, a shocking trend that continues to grow by leaps and bounds with Clinton's Presidency.

There is no subtler no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the c urrency. The process engages all other hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to di agnose.\"...John Maynard Keynes. Although credit is given to Keynes as the originato r of the \"multiplier\" the- ory, it belonged to one of his students, R.F. Kahn who invented it while a student at Kings College. In the summer of 1934, the Fabian Socialists decided to move their \"economic genius\" Keynes, to the United State s. His book, \"The General Theory of Money\" had been read by Roosevelt, but no t understood as Roosevelt confessed to Frances Perkins, who was responsible f or the introduction of the two men: \"I didn't understand his whole rigmarole of fi gures,\" Roosevelt confided in Perkins. Spending the country out of a recession wa s the underlying theory behind the Keynesian economic philosophy, which mig ht account for his popu- larity with successive Socialist governments in Eng land and the Democrat Party of the United States. Keynes was looked upon with awe, and something akin to the respect one would afford a Mystic whose prognostications about the future were always right. Yet the truth is, Keynes, if the bedazzled would on ly have investigated his claims, was wrong at least 85 percent of the time. Keynes h ad the manner of an English gentleman in bearing, dress and speech. It is said that he was able to charm any woman into bed with him, if he so chose. Perhaps it was his education at Eton and tenure at Kings College, Cambridge that had imbued him with the mannerism that both sexes found so appealing. Keynes got his alchemist-like secret that would mak e paper money multiply itself endlessly, from R.F. Kahn; had it been left with Kahn, nobody would have given it the slightest credence. But in the hands o f an immaculately tailored, tall and handsome Cambridge Don, with an amazing knowled ge of art, food and wine, the \"multiplier\" nostrum became big news. Eve n so, one wonders how, in spite of the special tutoring he received from Prof essors Marshall and Pigou, Keynes could only make 12th position-near the botto m of his small economics class. In 1911 Keynes became the editor of the \"Eco nomic Journal\" and Secretary of the Fabian Society's \"Royal Economic Society\" on e year later. When I think of Keynes I cannot help but think of the earthy, sa ge, homespun philosophy of my British regular army drill sergeant, which is well worth repeating: \"Bullshit Baffles Brains.\" That is really the essence of Keynesian economics: money would simply multiply itself into infinity, like some kind of a chain letter promise of a huge"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"130 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship reward for little effort. To those few who queried what would happen at the end of the chain letter line, Keynes snapped, \"we all h ave to die some day.\" Incredible as it may seem in retrospect, this is the Keynes \"e conomic system,\" in reality just so much gibberish, that was accepted by internation al bankers and leading politi- cians of the Western world. Was Keynes a kind of a Nostradamus, a Gregory Raspu tin, or was he truly sincere about his economic principles? Could it hav e been that, added to what he had been endowed with by nature, his father, Nevill e Keynes, a Cambridge pro- fessor whose forte was to level constant attacks on the free enterprise system, also contributed to his son's stunning success that left John Maynard Keynes a mil- lionaire, with a seat in the House of Lords? John Maynard Keynes began his career as a civil ser vant, in the manner of Sydney Webb, but while the great Lord Bertrand Russ ell often sneeringly referred to Webb as a \"clerk in the Colonial Office,\" he nev er applied this remark to Keynes. Perhaps this was because Keynes was in Russ ell's charmed circle at col- lege, which proves that Socialists are just as clas s-conscience and snobbish as any other group. From his early beginnings with George Bernard Shaw and the Fabian Socialists, Keynes was well thought of, especially since he was the one who \"called the moral bluff of capitalism\" according to Sydney and Beatrice Webb, the founders of Fabian Socialism. Although a member of the Liberal Party, Keynes enjoyed enormous respect from the Conservati ve Party and the Labour Party as one who could look into the future, financ ially speaking. \"A real oracle reader\" as the \"Fabian News\" wrote. Perhaps his \"or acle-reading ability\" is what caused Keynes to push for the founding of the Inter national Monetary Fund (IMF) in which he played a big role. Like so many of the One World Government (OWG) inst itutions, the IMF was simply a vehicle for draining money from the Am erican economy and farm- ing it out to countries that had excellent natural resources as collateral. What the unwary governments did not know, and indeed, had no way of knowing, was that the IMF would not only abscond with their natural r esources, but also control and then destroy their national sovereignty. Rhodesia, the Philippines, Angola, Brazil are good examples of what happens when the IMF is l et in. By 1919, Keynes had charmed his way into the confid ence of Colonel Mandel House, General Pershing and Walter Lippmann. Keynes expressed him- self forcefully, declaring that \"capitalism in Euro pe is dead.\" These contacts were to earn him a position of some importance with Hous e, and later, with Harry Hopkins, an alliance that led to the founding of th e Council on Foreign Relations, (CFR) first known as the Institute of International Affairs, in reality, a branch of the Fabian Society. According to the Congressional Record, House, October 12, 1932 page 22120, Keynes presented his book \"The Eco nomic Consequences of"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Brightest Stars in the American Socialist Firmament 131 Peace\" in the United States as a destabilizing effo rt and to popularize Marxist economic theories. Roosevelt received the Keynesian ideas with enthusi asm, as they gave him a leg to stand on when it came to getting $4 billion from Congress for so-called \"public works\" projects — in reality make work jobs that did not \"multiply\" fed- eral dollars as Keynes had promised. Keynes develop ed a friendship with Henry Cantwell Wallace, both men favoring the elimination of the gold content of the dollar and a \"managed currency. \" Keynes continued to make a big impression at Harvard, where he was frequently in the company of Frankfurter and Laski. While Frankfurter provided the legalese for the Soc ialist New Deal, Keynes pro- vided its economic basis, as usual, a total pipe dr eam, which when taken to its conclusion would wreck the economy of any nation. The \"English Socialists\" like the soothsayer-charla tans of the Pharaonic priesthood, had indeed spun a web of their Mysterie s around President Roosevelt who remained in their thrall until his death. If on e were to search for the High Priest of the New Deal era, surely John Maynard Key nes would be the natural choice. His ability with the English language was r emarkable in that he could make even the very elect believe that two and two m ade five. The arrival of Keynes on the Washington scene was p receded by a full-page advertisement in The New York Times of December 31, 1933, which took the form of an open letter to President Roosevelt, fill ed with ideas totally foreign to American economists. Nevertheless, the Madison Aven ue propaganda did the trick and is likely what paved the way for his 1934 visit to the United States. The long friendship with Lippmann and other leading Soc ialists stars in the firmament of the United States, opened all doors for Keynes. Although Roosevelt did not understand the implicati ons of what he was doing, on the advice of Keynes, his administration decided to take the United States off the gold standard in conformity with a s imilar action taken by the British Government. Keynes \"multiplier\" theory was adopted by Roosevelt, after Keynes told him not to be concerned by \"that crude economic fallacy known as the quantity theory of money.\" This was music to th e ears of the New Dealers, who felt they had been given the green light by the greatest economist in the world to embark on a reckless program of spend and spend, as if there were no accountability on the morrow. Thus it was that with the 1936 publication of \"Gene ral Theory of Employment\" Keynes sought to ensure continued gover nment spending based upon the belief that government is responsible for full employment and if that is not forthcoming, then welfare must take up the slac k. Keynes was the chief advo- cate of deficit spending and Roosevelt was happy to oblige him. But for all that, Roosevelt was unable to spend his way out of the de pression. As for the great American public, all this was way over their heads. \"Leave"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"132 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship it to the experts\" the media chorused, \"it is too c omplicated for us.\" And that is exactly how the Socialists got away with the great fraud of deficit spending based on the bogus \"multiplier\" that never did work. The inestimable damage done to the United States by this Fabian Socialist economic leader is still being measured. \"People are known by the company they keep \" is an old, true and tried maxi- mum. Among his friends Keynes numbered some of the worst traitors in the his- tory of the Nation; Lauchlin Currie, Felix Frankfur ter, Walter Lippmann, Bernard Baruch, Colonel House, Dean Acheson, Walt Whitman R ostow, Fancis Perkins, Abe Fortiss, Eleanor Roosevelt, whose evil deeds ar e as numerous as the stars in the night sky, too numerous to be fully covered by this work. The great Congressman Louis T. McFadden made short shrift of Keynesian economics when he had Marriner Eccles, chairman of the Federal Reserve testi- fy before the House Banking Committee of which he w as the chairman. McFadden, a longtime opponent of Fabian Socialism a ttacked Frankfurter and Keynes for their connections, particularly thro ugh the Foreign Policy Association of New York, noting that Paul M. Warbur g was one of its founders. He also correctly chastised Henry A. Wallas, appoin ted by Roosevelt as his Secretary of Agriculture on the recommendation of F rances Perkins as belonging to the seditious Freedom Planning Group, the Fabian Socialist sponsor of the New York Foreign Policy Association. McFadden correctly identified Moses Israel Sieff with the group, quoting Sieff's advice, \"Let us go slowly for awhile and wait and see how our plan carries out in America.\" Sieff ran the British Marks and Spencer chain stores and was a multi-millionaire So cialist. The \"our\" plan which Sieff referred to was one draf ted by the Fabian Socialists in London that would place all land and agriculture under government control, which Professor Rexford Tugwell had previo usly advocated. Tugwell was the third member of the \"terrible threesome\" of Stuart Chase and Raymond Moley, teaching at the notorious, seditious, Rand S chool of Social Science. All three were confidants of Henry Wallace, who with th e help of Tugwell, wrecked the thriving agricultural industry just coming into its own in 1936, by a policy of plowing under crops and killing farm livestock. Tugwell was an ardent admirer of the Bolshevik Revo lution, which he said was \"having fun remaking the world.\" Trained at Columbi a University, Tugwell was the first Socialists to apply Fabian Socialist theories to government practice. Tugwell had a finger in every New Deal pie baked by the Roo sevelt administration. One of his major undertakings was to gut tariff protection against imported goods. The New Deal plan had been enthusiastically receive d by Roosevelt, who said, \" If we look at this thing from the broad nat ional viewpoint, we are going to make it a national policy if it takes 50 years... T he time is now ripe, overripe, for planning to prevent in the future the errors of the past and to carry out our social (Socialist) and economic views to the Nation.\""},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Brightest Stars in the American Socialist Firmament 133 One of those who was pleased to follow this injunct ion was Arthur Schlesinger Jr., whose wide range of Socialist acti vities, which included manag- ing Adlai Simpson, first national chairman of Ameri cans for Democratic Action (ADA) one of the deepest Socialist anarchistic, sed itious, subversive organiza- tions in the United States, for whom he wrote most of their propaganda material. It was Schlesinger who was responsible for putting John F. Kennedy over as a Socialist candidate, no mean feat, as it meant conv incing pure Socialist ADA members to vote for one who typified everything the y opposed. A star performer in \"penetrate and permeate,\" Schle singer's role in secretly subverting Lyndon Johnson and getting him to promot e ADA causes in the 1950s was a big feather in his cap. The whole story of ho w Schlesinger kept key ADA members from bolting after Kennedy announced that J ohnson would be his run- ning mate at the Democratic Convention in 1960, wou ld fill a book. One can imagine the consternation of leading ADA Socialist David Dubinsky, on being told that Johnson, whom he had hated all of his pol itical life, was to be Kennedy's running mate. Had Schlesinger not succeeded, it is very likely th at Johnson would have rejected Kennedy's offer. As it was, it was touch a nd go, as Johnson preferred the Senate majority leader post. Apparently, it was onl y after Schlesinger revealed to Dubinsky how he had. made a closet Socialist out of Johnson in the 1950s, that Dubinsky rallied ADA support for the nomination. Sc hlesinger's successes contin- ued over into the Johnson presidency, even though h e was not in Johnson's \"upper- level cabinet\" (unappointed advisors — privy counse lors). Arthur Schlesinger was one of the most dangerous unseen enemies this count ry has ever had. Dean Acheson personified the underhand, penetration and permeation stan- dard seditious practice of a well-trained Socialist . Acheson came from the Committee of 300 law firm of Covington, Burling and Rublee, who serve as lawyers for the great Committee of 300 accountants, Price, Waterhouse. He was also in the inner circle of J.P. Morgan, Andrew Mel lon, Tommy Lamont (the man who pressed for American recognition of the bloody butchers Bolshevik regime), the Kuhn Loeb family and Felix Frankfurter. Acheson was your typical well-con- nected Socialist, seditious Wall Street lawyer, who went on to become Under Secretary of the Treasury and Secretary of State un der President Roosevelt. It was Frankfurter who recommended Dean Acheson for a position in the United States State Department. Among Acheson's mor e public acts of betrayal and sedition against his country in the service of Socialism, was his fierce strug- gle to get all possible assistance for the Bolshevi k regime at a time when the White Russian Armies were defeating and putting to flight the Bolshevik Red Army, which is fully described in my book, \"Diploma cy By Deception.\" In WWII, Acheson urged that no action be taken against Stalin for occupying the Baltic States. His betrayal of Nationalist China is already well known and need"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"134 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship not be recounted here. To top off his career off tr eason and sedition, Acheson's support for the North Korean and Chinese forces dur ing the Korean War was an open act of treason. But instead of being arrested, charged with treason and hanged, the highest honors were heaped upon him. Dean Acheson's compatriots in Socialist crimes were Dean Rusk and Walt Whitman Rostow, who learned their Socialism as Rhod es Scholars at Oxford, the \"finishing school\" for future world Socialist leade rs. Rusk was the opposite of Keynes in appearance, round faced, plump and baldin g, he looked more like some low-level functionary in the Bolshevik regime than Secretary of State in the Kennedy/Johnson administrations. Yet, his appearanc e belied his vicious Socialist character and his unstinting efforts on behalf of R ed China and Stalin through the Institute for Pacific Relations (IPR), and directly , through a large number of State Department agencies. It was Rusk who set up the \"private sanctuary\" stag ing area for Red Chinese troops in Manchuria, in collusion with the British government. General Douglas McArthur was forbidden to attack the sanctuary, whe re Chinese troops were massing, prior to crossing the Yalu River to attack the American forces. When MacArthur submitted a plan worked out by his staff and U.S. Air Force General George E. Stratemeyer, that would have destroyed Ch ina's fighting abilities and set them back for decades, it was the signal for Ru sk to hastily summon President Truman to attend a conference at Blair House in Was hington, D.C. November 6, 1950, the Chinese forces were advancing rapidly across the Yalu. Stratemeyer's planes were bombed up and ready to go. But back in Washington, Rusk told Truman that he could not give the order for MacArthur to strike the Red Chinese troops. According to documen ts I saw, Rusksaid, \"we have a commitment with the British not to take any actio n which might involve attacks on the Manchurian side of the river against the Chi nese WITHOUT CONSULT- ING WITH THEM.\" Rusk had also called for an emergen cy meeting of the United Nations Security Council, ostensibly to get a U.N. resolution ordering China to pull its troops back. In reality, this was a treacherous, treasonous ploy by Rusk to give the Red Chinese troops time to cross t he Yalu River, while holding up crucial attacks planned by MacArthur. If ever th ere was a seditionist, a traitor, a man who had no compunction in betraying his count ry, that man was Socialist Dean Rusk. The third partner in this trio of seditionists was Walt Whitman Rostow, who once said: \"It is a legitimate American national ob jective to see an end of nation- hood as it has been historically defined.\" (Rostow, \"The United States in the World Arena.\") In spite of having been declared a g rave security risk by the State Department Intelligence Agency and the Air Force In telligence Agency, Rostow remained in a most powerful position as the unelect ed representative of American Socialists, with an open door to Eisenhower, Kenned y and Johnson. Rostow had"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Brightest Stars in the American Socialist Firmament 135 been stationed at the Massachusetts Institute of Te chnology by the Committee of 300, from where he plotted and planed strategy that he believed would bring about \"the end of nationhood\" for the United States . That this monstrous traitor had a free rein in Wash ington, should forever silence those who believe that Socialism is merely a benevolent institution to help the needy, the unemployed and the poor. In December of 1960, Rostow flew to Moscow to see Vasily Kuznetsov, the USSR's deputy f oreign minister. Kuznetsov had been complaining to Acheson and Rusk that the U nited States was building a first strike capability, pointed at his country. Rostow told him not to worry, the situation would b e corrected. And it was. Thanks to the intervention of Robert Strange McNama ra, then Secretary of Defense, almost the entire Skybolt, Pluto, X-20 Dyn asoar, Bomarc-A, Nike Zeus missiles defense system and the B-70 nuclear bomber production was drastically cut back or eliminated. There was no corresponding decrease on the Russian side. Apart from anything else, McNamara's treachery cost the United States $5.4 bil- lion. A higher degree of treason would be hard to f ind, and in a Socialist treason and sedition lineup, McNamara would be in the top t en. As a reward for his perfidious treachery, Rostow wa s appointed by President Johnson to the National Security Council in 1964. A t the time of Rostow's appoint- ment, Johnson praised this evil seditionist, saying that \"he has the most important job in the White House, apart from the President.\" This was the same Rostow who had never wavered from his goal to one day end the nati onhood of the United States. Rostow was responsible for arranging for U.S. groun d forces to be sent to Vietnam, after an intensive lobbying effort to get our troops into the Mekong Delta. But the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the presi dent that ground troops should not be committed to South Vietnam, as they were sur e to get bogged down and eventually, would not be able to extricate themselv es from the region. Like all of the leading Socialist camarilla in Washington, Rost ow did not give up on his plan and continued to press for a troop commitment. Rostow used General Maxwell Taylor to get direct ac cess to John Kennedy. Unfortunately, a green and inexperienced Kennedy ac cepted Rostow's scenario and in January of 1960, ten thousand American soldi ers were sent to Vietnam. Through the treachery and treason of Walt Whitman R ostow, the Fabian Socialist method of penetration and permeation had infected t he highest office in the land. There has never been a war like the Vietnam War, wh ere our soldiers tried to fight with both hands manacled behind their backs, the keys held by Robert Strange McNamara, Walt Whitman Rostow and Dean Rusk . No nation's military had to fight according to the rules laid down by an out and out traitor — Robert S. McNamara. This man should long ago been tried fo r treason and hanged. According to McNamara's \"rules of engagement\" our s oldiers had to wait until they were surrounded and being shot at before they were allowed to respond."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"136 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship Was there ever treason like this? Senator Barry Gol dwater called McNamara's rules of engagement, \"layers of restrict ions, illogical and irrational,\" which also prevented our bomber pilots from attacki ng clearly visible, strategic targets. Instead, our bombers had to unload tons an d tons of bombs on so-called \"supply trails\" which they could not even see, and which did absolutely no dam- age to strategic targets, in most instances, hundre ds of miles away. It was a com- plete exercise in futility and a shocking waste of money. Back home, the Socialists in control of the news me dia fought a running bat- tle for public opinion — on the side of the North V ietnamese Communist regime. American soldiers were the \"bad guys,\" while the Vi et Cong could do no wrong. It is my fervent hope and prayer that these three e nemies of the United States, Rostow, Rusk and McNamara may yet somehow be brough t to trial on charges of treason. Hanging is too good for them. If I were asked to give an opinion on which of the Socialist stars did the most damages to the Constitution and the concepts for a great American Republic, I would have to think long and hard, because there is a veritable host to choose from. But in the end, I would have to place Walter Lippmann near the top of the ladder, who joined the London Fabian Society in 190 9, making him the oldest American Socialist. In 1917, Lippmann was selected by British intellige nce MI6 to visit Colonel House every two weeks to counsel him on how to get Wilson reelected and push him away from neutrality, which \"opinions\" often ap peared in the Socialist mag- azine the \"New Republic\" on whose board Lippmann sa t. It was not generally known that Lippmann was the leader of an informal g roup that set war policy for Wilson and mapped out his post-war strategy. The gr oup was headed by Dr. Sydney Mezes. Lippmann actively pursued a policy of securing priv ate donations to foster Wilson's 14 Points which was hoped would result in the founding of the New World Order through the League of Nations. Lippmann was able to secure the ser- vices of 150 Socialist professors to propagandize a nd collect money and data for the coming Paris Peace Conference, among whom was t he notorious Socialist, the Reverend Norman Thomas. In effect, thanks to these professors and the slickness of Lippmann, their ideas were fervently expressed b y Woodrow Wilson who did not seem to mind that he was acting as a mouthpiece for international Socialism. Lippmann became closely associated with \"Radical Re d\" John Reed whose Bolshevik ideas for America had to be toned down, u ntil Reed eventually rushed off in a huff to join the Bolsheviks in Moscow, but not before he and Lippmann had founded the Harvard Socialist Club. Reed was th e subject of highly-imagina- tive Holly wood movie glorifying Bolshevism and str essing what an honor it was for Reed to have been buried by the Kremlin Wall af ter his long service to Communism."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Brightest Stars in the American Socialist Firmament 137 Like Felix Frankfurter and Louis Brandeis, Walter L ippmann grew up in affluent circumstances. His career at Harvard has b een correctly described as \"brilliant\" but of his membership of the Fabian Soc iety in 1909, Lippmann con- fessed to it, meant more than anything he had achie ved at Harvard. Thus, as in so many instances, it is apparent that good Socialists are not made, they are born that way. The Fabians in London had watched Lippmann's c areer at Harvard, and in the words of Harold Laski, \"He was an ideal candida te to carry out our policy of penetration and permeation of the United States at all levels.\" This Lippmann did with skill which showed a flair f or deceptive practices and from 1932 to 1939 he devoted his time and energ y in penetrating and perme- ating the leading American business houses, legal p ractices and banking circles. It was Lippmann who established a new class, a \"mod erate\" Republican which was to serve Clinton so decisively in leading the U nited States down a Socialist road to slavery in a One World Government — New Wor ld Order New Dark Age. The term, \"moderate Republican\" helped those who we re ready to commit treason and sedition in the House and Senate to avo id being tagged as Socialists/ Marxist/Communists. Among the most successful of th ese Machiavellian chameleons are Senators Roth, Cohen, Kassenbaum, Ch affee, Danforth who made it possible to make the Communist Manifesto of 1848 in the shape of the so-called \"Crime bill\" part of United States law. Lippmann was the first American to adopt applied ps ychology for political situations, a tactic which he learned at the Tavist ock Institute for Human Relations In Sussex, England. His unswerving suppor t of Socialism was typified by his close friendship with Thomas \"Tommy\" Lamont, the J.R Morgan banker who played a big role in prevailing upon the United States government to recog- nize and establish relations with the bloody. Bolsh evik butchers in Moscow. Lippman acquired immense power through his syndicat ed press columns, which were carried by all of the major newspapers and mag azines. Lippmann went on to become a close friend and confi dant of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and his Socializing of them re sulted in the adoption of Socialist platforms, the New Frontier and the Great Society, taken straight from books written by Socialists, and adopted practicall y in toto as Democrat Party planks. Lippmann is credited with implementing the \"make haste slowly\" policy of the Fabian Socialists in the United States: \"In a general way, our object was to make reactiona ries standpatters, stand- patters, conservatives; conservatives, liberals; li berals, radicals; and radicals, Socialists. In other words we tried to move everyon e up a peg. We preferred to have the whole mass move a little, to having a few altogether out of sight.\" (Source, Congressional Record October 12, 1962.)

The success of these tactics can be seen in the Clinton presidency, wher e one major piece of Socialist legislation after the other has been forced through on the basis of gradually con- verting opponents of Clinton to believers in his pr ogram. Clinton's Socialist NAFTA, the Crime bill, and his bill imposing the biggest tax increase in the world on the American people ar e prime examples of how this creeping paralyses works, and also how important it is to have traitors in Republican ranks who are whole heartedly for Social ism, but who are labeled \"moderate Republicans.\" By the Lippmann method, the psychological approach to politics he learned at the Tavistock Institute o f Human Relations, the American people are being led, slowly but surely, one step a t a time, as if dream walking, to accept with a murmur, the most radical and heinous changes in education, in eco- nomics, religion and politics in the United States, without seemingly being aware of what terrible changes have been made, and are in the process of being made. The application of social psychology by Lippmann, g reatly speeded accep- tance of Roosevelt's \"New Deal\" Socializing of the United States, which was car- ried further by Kennedy and Johnson's Socialist New Frontier and Great Society. Lippmann was the most adept in a long line of adept Socialists who used the word \"democracy\" on every single occasion it was possibl e to introduce it, without let- ting on that in Socialist parlance, \"democracy\" rea lly mean the increasing inroads of Socialism into the educational, economic and pol itical life of the nation through government regulation of business. \"True de mocracy,\" that is to say, unbridled Socialism was ushered in without the popu lace being aware of it. We see this policy in full swing in the Clinton admini stration, with the majority of the people not yet aware that the \"democracy\" Clinton h as in mind is unadulterated Socialism. Lippmann's tenure as president of the Intercollegia te Socialist Society estab- lished at Harvard in 1909 was the best foundation f or his future in Socialism that money could buy, and stood him in good stead when h e came to found the Socialist magazine, the \"New Republic\" in which his opinions were later to be aired about the Vietnam War. Lippmann and other Soc ialist writers told the American people through newspaper articles that if the United States tried to win the Korea, we would run up against China, and be de feated. This was a calculated lie, as China was not in any sense of the word fit to wage war against the United States, and had a war r esulted between the two nations, China would have been soundly defeated, a fact conveyed to Truman and the Pentagon by Gen.

One of the future stars in the Socialist firmament over America whom Lippmann met at Harvard University, was Robert Stra nge McNamara. A product of the penetration and permeation Socialist method of John Maynard Keynes which settled Fabian doctrines in the Department of Economics in Harvard, McNamara taught at the Business School as an assist ant professor in Business Administration from 1940 to 1943. He was later seco nded to the Army Air Force and thence to the Ford Motor Company. Following his near-disastrous tenure at Ford, he was promoted to a position newly establish ed at he head of the Department of Defense. McNamara was impressed by the new Socialist gospel which was sweeping the campuses of the universities of the United Stat es. The American political economy, the well-tried economic policies laid out in American economic system of tariff protection and sound money based on bimet allism, were swiftly being purged and replaced by the economic claptrap of Joh n Maynard Keynes and Harold Laski. There was no Socialist leaders more a nxious to carry out these un- American economic and political economy Socialist t heories than McNamara. The one thing that emerged from the frantic rush to do away with the American economic model, was that the Keynesian model verged dangerously close on the economic theories of Karl Marx, an observation that was never allowed to be brought up in the press, radio or television. More than that. McNamara was eager to sell out the military, and he did it by using the evil influence he had over President John son. There was never a time so dangerous for the security of the United States as when Socialist star Robert S. McNamara prowled the corridors of the Pentagon, can celing and countermanding one program after another, until the United States was well below par with the Soviet Union. McNamara even got Johnson to cancel t he production of plutoni- um for the nuclear program via an illegal Executive Order. Illegal, in the sense that only kings and queens ca n issue proclamations, which is what an executive order is. In earlier tim es in the history of the nation, both McNamara and Johnson would have been tried and found guilty of treason, as well they should have been. In 1964, at a most crucial phase of the struggle to bring Stalin into line, McNamara canceled the nuclear battle plans of NATO, without so much as by your leave or ever having consulted with the NATO a llies.

French rightwing leaders reaffirmed the wi sdom of De Gaulle in having pulled out of NATO and establishing an independent nuclear deterrent for the French nation. The French renewed their vows never to be misled and disarmed by the United States, as they would have been had Fran ce not pulled out of NATO. One marvels that the small in number, United States Communist Party, and a nominally non-existent Socialist Party was able t o pull of such a massive victo- ry for Fabian Socialism. Future historians will sur ely rub their eyes in amazement, wondering what had happened to the ancestors of tho se who dumped tea in Boston Harbor, and what happened to the descendants of Andrew Jackson, a man who not only clearly recognized the Socialist menac e, but actively fought it tooth and nail all of his life. Just what happened to the American people between t he founding of this nation and the advent of the Socialists to power? T he real answer is to be found in the population mix, which was now so adulterated as to only faintly resemble the original colonists. In a silent revolution, the Socialists rent this country from one end to another, and little by little, so demora lized the nation that it became easy prey for the forces that had been lying in wai t for its downfall, ever since the War of 1812. Constantly turning to the British Fabian Society fo r inspiration, slogans and programs, the Democrat Party in effect became the S ocialist/Marxist/Communist Party of the United States. Johnson's \"War on Pover ty\" for instance, was origi- nally written by Labor Party Prime Minister Harold Wilson. In his address to the international Socialists, Harold Wilson made it cle ar that the intention of Socialist in Britain and the United States was to divert fund s for defense to funds to erad- icate want. Disarmament, Wilson said, was what it a ll about, so that \"want\" could be banished from the earth. Leading Socialist Michael Harrington, a member of t he American Socialist Party, ten years later picked up the Wilson pamphle t and produced a book, \"The Other America: Poverty in the United States.\" Puffe d by the kept press, radio and television, Harrington's book was an instant succes s. The Socialist loved it. Nobody saw fit to mention that Harrington had merely taken Harold Wilson's notation a step further and applied them to the American scene. Joh n F. Kennedy was sent a copy of the book and wrote Harrington that he was deeply im pressed with it. It is these stars in the Socialist firmament over t he United States who have wrought greater havoc than any invading army could have hoped to accomplish. It is the Socialist who have prostituted and deform ed our electoral system, until today, there is no telling just how much fraud and deceit goes to make up the final tally of votes. In this the Democrat Party is head and shoulders above the Republican Party."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Brightest Stars in the American Socialist Firmament 141 It has come to this: What the candidates say is alm ost inconsequential these day; it is who gets out the most voters that counts . When a Republican candidate faces off against a Democrat contender, the interna tional press begins to bay at the heels of the candidate as if he were running in Eng land, Italy, France, Germany, Poland and the Scandinavia countries. It is quite a stonishing to find the Socialist press in these countries closing ranks behind the D emocrat candidate, almost without exception. Worse than this, the arm-twisting and threats that accompany an election make a fair result nigh unto impossible. The Democr ats are very good at this kind of activity. Businesses are intimidated, contracts threatened, funds withheld from neighborhood programs; the election process today h as little to do with the num- ber of voters who register and vote: it has come do wn to who can mount the most clout, who can intimidate and blackmail more succes sfully, who can lie to the American people without being exposed as outright l iars. For this, Madison Avenue types are hired at great c ost. If a president makes a slip and says the wrong thing, the \"fixers\" jump in and assure the voters that it was THEY who had not heard aright. There is zero ho nesty left in politics as we come to the close of the 20th century. As Walter Li ppmann explained in rare moment of candor following the 1964 elections: \"For the real business of the campaign was not to m ap out a course for the future. It was to beat and crush rebellion against the established line of domestic and foreign policy which was laid down (by the Soci alists) in the generation which followed the great depression and the second world war.\" There are many other bright stars in the Socialist firmament, past and pre- sent, and in the Notes section, we mention their na mes, although not as fully as we would have liked. To jump over the years and com e up to the present, perhaps the brightest star of all in the Socialist firmamen t as we come to the close of the 20th century, is President William Jefferson Clinto n. Like so many of his predecessors, Clinton was insin uated into the American political scene in order to penetrate and permeate and lay the base of his presi- dency. Few imagined that a relatively small-time po litician from a relatively unimportant state, would be the best agent of chang e that Fabian Socialism had thus far been able to come up with. We will skip th e formal, known details of Clinton, and try, instead to look past the conventi onal information about him which hardly needs repeating. Instead, we shall try to give our readers some of t he information that has been kept under wraps and which has not yet seen the lig ht of day, in spite of Clintons host of powerful detractors who would like nothing better than to kick him out of Washington. Except for some time spent in London, where he acte d as a leader of Socialist agitation against the Vietnam War, and a period at the Socialist finishing school"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"142 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship (Oxford University), Clinton had little experience in politics outside of Arkansas. Yet he was nevertheless able to maintain a remarkab ly tight grip upon the State of Arkansas. In this he was ably assisted by his friends Tyson a nd Stephens, two of the richest men in the State. Clinton was recommended f or promotion and referred to Jay Rockefeller and Pamela Harriman by \"King\" Steve ns. Harriman and Rockefeller are the leaders of the Socialist Party of the United States, better known as the Democrat Party. In Clinton Mrs. Harrim an saw a man with poten- tial, so Clinton was shipped off to be groomed by t he Bilderbergers as a future world Socialist leader. Harriman and Rockefeller we re not disappointed, as Clinton turned in an impressive performance, and up on arriving back in the United States, he got the nod from the Democrat Par ty as its candidate of choice for the 1992 presidential election. There was some concern expressed about the skeleton s in Clinton's closet, but his boyish good looks and keen mind were though t to be enough to overcome anyone boorish attempts to refer to them. And so it was that on January 20, 1993, Clinton became the 42nd President of the United Sta tes. That a more unlikely per- sonality had control of the largest and most powerf ul nation on earth stunned his detractors — and there were hundreds of detractors in the highest places of power in the country — who tended to overlook Clinton's e xceptionally keen mind and dwell on his homely background, not to mention the charges of sexual indescre- tions that began to surface. The Socialists were jubilant. Their choice had made it to the White House; henceforth Socialist programs could now be speeded up and the country would not be allowed to recover from one crisis before th e next descended upon it. A new era of hijacking of State powers was about to b egin, the great Socialist heist was about to slip into high gear. The Socialist hie rarchy had laid out a timetable of four years for Clinton to fulfill his mandate. C linton was to be a single term president, yet the programs that he would be called upon to ramrod through the Congress would have the most terrifying consequence s for the United States for the next 1,000 years. How awfully close to failure the well-laid plans fo r William Clinton had come to failing has never been disclosed except in reports in World In Review (WIR). It was like this: Mrs. Clinton had become mo re than disenchanted with her husband, because of his philandering ways and his n umerous extra-marital rela- tionships. Being of the best Socialist \"feminist\" m aterial, Mrs. Clinton, who kept her ancestry well hidden, came to a point where she decided to go it alone. Hillary Clinton (there was no mention of \"Rodham\" then) dul y parted ways and left her errant husband to ponder over his marital misdeeds. It was shortly before Clinton was approached by Pam ela Harriman and Jay Rockefeller, that he found himself without his wife . This was a bad setback; obvi-"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Brightest Stars in the American Socialist Firmament 143 ously, a man with martial troubles was not suitable to occupy the Oval Office. Harriman made a beeline for Hillary, and explained the situation: If she returned to her husband, she could count on being the next \" first lady.\" Never one to pass up an opportunity for advancement, Hillary agreed t o mend relations with her spouse, on condition that there be no more extra-ma rital affairs. This was agreed to, and the race was on. The rest is history. What is not history is the background of William Je fferson Clinton, which to this day, has been hidden from the American people. Clinton was born in Hope, a small town in Arkansas and the family moved to Hot Springs, which was an \"open\" town with houses of prostitution and other b ig city \"delights.\" It was this convivial \"anything goes\" atmosphere in which Clint on was raised that some say was responsible for him having trouble with the tru th. According to what a former Arkansas State Senator, Judge Jim Johnson stat- ed, one Nora Waye, a former partner of Clinton's st ep-father claimed that Clinton was hardly anything that the establishment media ha d built him up to be. Waye gives some for instances: \"When you think about Bill Clinton's aversion to th e truth you wonder if this is because of the lackadaisical background that he has in this area. He lied about being a Rhodes Scholar. He never completed that (co urse) and yet he said he was a Rhodes Scholar.\" In this Waye is seemingly prejud iced. Anyone who is select- ed as Socialist Rhodes Scholar and who goes to Oxfo rd, even if he does not com- plete the course, is allowed to call himself a Rhod es Scholar. Very serious allegations have been made against Cli nton of abuses of power, drug-related matters and insider trading by his wif e. These allegations have been made by Larry Nichols, who was a close friend of Cl inton in the 1970s. According to what Nichols said, he \"did a lot of projects for Clinton from a marketing per- spective.\" Nichols went on to make a series of alle gations which he says have never been investigated. Most of these center around mass ive cocaine dealings out of Mena, in Arkansas, some of which was also reported in \"The Nation.\" Nichols claims that the Arkansas Development Finance Author ity (ADFA) was a wholly- controlled financial entity for laundering large su ms of cocaine money from Mena, which he says, went through a Florida bank (not nam ed.) Nichols also made serious allegations of wrong-doin g against Rose law firm and Hillary Clinton, charging them with receiving c ommissions on bond loan applications, contrary to State law. Nichols claims that he stole documents and made copies of them that bear out the truth of his allegations. He also claims that some of the Mena drug money was laundered through a Chicago bank, in which the powerful Democrat politician, Dan Rostenkowski is part owner. Nichols claims that Roger Clinton, the President's brother did not go to jail for selling cocaine, \"they was giving it away\" alle gedly in return for unspecified favors. Nichols said that \"Once he was convicted (D an Lasater — who was found"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"144 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship guilty with Roger Clinton) he and Roger went to a m inimum security prison. Holiday Inn we call them. He spent, I think, up to 6 to 8 months and then got out. Unbeknown to anybody, Bill Clinton, granted him (pr esumably Lasater) a full and complete pardon the day after he got out...\" Nichols accuses Clinton and his Arkansas administra tion of never going after cocaine smuggling out of Mena: \"Not one single majo r bust was ever made out of Arkansas, out of Mena (Arkansas). Now, imagine t hat, nearly ten years in its running and never even one truckload of it (cocaine ) ever got caught.\" Nichols went on to make series allegations of wrongdoing ag ainst Wes Hubbell, who went to Washington with Clinton, and Hillary Clinton, th e Stevens and the Tyson fam- ily, politically and financially allied with Clinto n while he was the governor of Arkansas. On Tyson, Nichols alleges as follows: \"Don Tyson put in $600,000 or $700,000, all told in to all of Bill Clinton's campaigns. Guess what he got out of it? 10 million dollars — and guess from where? The Arkansas Development Financing Authority . And he never paid a dime for it.\" Nichols also accused a parking meter manufacturer, Parking on Meter (POM) associated with Hubbel, of impropriety, and he said that he tried to get every major news media outlets interested in hi s story, but that in general, they all refused to touch it. Instead, Nichols says he w as subjected to a barrage of ver- bal and physical abuse that left him virtually disc redited. Nichols said that an associate of his, Gary Johnson an attorney was living in Quapaw Tower condominium. Johnson apparently had a surveillance camera mounted outside his apartment — this, long be fore Geniffer Flowers moved in next door to his condominium. Johnson claims that h e saw Clinton entering Geniffer Flowers' apartment on several occasion, wi th a key. Johnson said: \"I actually saw him go into her condo minium. It wasn't that I was standing there looking out of my peephole watch ing Geniffer Flowers' con- dominium. It was just that I had gotten the camera. I had the camera before Geniffer Flowers moved in.\" Nichols said, \"guess wh at he caught on tape? Bill Clinton walking into Geniffer Flowers' apartment on numerous occasions, with a key.\" Thus far there has been nothing to substantia te Nichols' and Johnson's sto- ries, but as we said, \"The Nation\" did begin to wri te about Mena and Wes Hubell, and then, after a few articles, didn't do any follo w-up stories — very unlike their journalistic style. In October 1992, \"The Nation\" said: \"In Hot Springs , where Clinton spoke on Labor Day weekend, I saw the process at work. He re in this louche town of bathouses and former casinos, is where our Bill gre w up. You can forget all that agonizing tripe about 'a town called Hope.' The hus tling atmosphere evidently impressed him. If we can believe Hillary, who intro duced the Guv at the home- coming rally, the first thing they said to each oth er when he brought her here on an early romantic weekend was: \"Just look at all th ese small businesses...\""},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Brightest Stars in the American Socialist Firmament 145 The same leftwing magazine published an article in March of 1992, from which the following extracts are taken: \"On the broader question of Clinton's favors to his friends, Larry Nichols — the man fired by Clinton from the Arkansas Developm ent Finance Authority, and the original source of the Flowers story — claims t hat the connections to the Clintons are practically a requirement for companie s seeking loans from ADEA, vastly expanded by Clinton in 1985 to attract capit al to the state for the purpose of economic development, offering companies long-te rm loans financed through the sale of tax-exempt bonds, And, indeed, names ap pearing in ADFA documents reviewed by my colleagues bear the aroma of Clinton 's circle.\" \"Among the underwriters of the bond issues we have copies of, Stephens Inc. features prominently. The company's chairman, Jacks on Stephens and his son Warren have helped Clinton raise more than $100,000 for his campaign. In January the bank Stephens has a controlling interes t in, Worthen National, extend- ed Clinton a $2 million line of credit. Another fam iliar name on the bond issue is the now defunct Lasater and Co. Dan Lasater, who he aded the company, is a long- time friend of Clinton and his brother Roger. Both Roger and Lasater were bust- ed for cocaine, the former on a stiffer charge.\" \"Then there's the Rose law firm, Hillary Clinton's firm whose name adorns both bond issues and loan agreement papers. Hillary Clinton has represented a company owned by Stephens Inc. in litigation. Rose partner Wes Hubbel repre- sented the recipient of the first loan that AFDA ma de, a company called Park on Meter, or POM, whose name has cropped up in talk ab out Mena. Hubbel had been secretary of POM in the early 1980s. Hubbel's clien t in the AFDA deal was Seth Ward, the current president of POM, known as a frie nd of Clinton. Worthen Bank appears among institutions that have from time to t ime had liens on POM.\" \"Clinton and drug policy is another area of vexed c onfluence. According to Clinton's deputy, John Kroger, Clinton feels 'the r eal solution to the drug problem is to decrease demand.'...But Clinton also 'support s continued efforts to interdict drugs coming into the U.S.', favoring 'expanding th e use of the military, especially tor purposes of tracking and stopping small planes coming into the country.' So why hasn't he pursued the drug smuggling trail that lea ds to Mena, the town and airport in Western Arkansas? Clinton can't claim ignorance of the fact that Arkansas served as a nexus for international drug operations. One o f his state prosecutors, Charles Black brought this to his attention in 1988. For fi ve years before that there was a federal investigation joined by Clinton's own State Police. As part of that a feder- al grand jury was assembled. This grand jury was ev entually dissolved, and the local press carried reports that members of the pan el had been prevented from seeing crucial evidence, hearing important witnesse s and even seeing the twenty nine count draft indictment on money laundering dra wn up by an attorney of the Justice Department, Operation Greenback.\""},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"146 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship \"In 1989 Clinton received petitions from Arkansas c itizens demanding that he convene a state grand jury and continue the inve stigation. Winston Bryant, now State Attorney General, made the subject of dru gs and Mena an issue of his campaign in 1990. A year later Bryant turned over h is state files involving Mena, along with the petitions from 1,000 citizens to Ira n/Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, who has since continued to a mass informatio n. (All that Walsh did was continue the coverup.) Later that year, on August 1 2, 1991, Clinton's advisor on criminal justice wrote to a concerned citizen to sa y that the Governor understood that the matter of criminal activity in Mena was be ing studied or otherwise taken up by Bryant, Walsh and Arkansas Representative Bil l Alexander.\" \"Yet with all of this knowledge, Clinton has done n othing. The state Attorney General does not have the power to conduct an inves tigation, but the state prose- cutor does. When Charles Black urged Clinton to all ocate funds for such an inves- tigation, Clinton ignored his request. The State Po lice were taken off the case after the federal government scrapped its investigation. Now the ball is back with Clinton and he continues to do nothing...\" In a later issue, 'The Nation\" had this to say abou t Wes Hubbel and Park on Meter. Outlining the history of Clinton's personal creation of the AFDA, the writer went on to say: \"...the ADFA made its first industry loan in 1985 t o POM Inc., a parking meter manufacturer based in Russellville, Arkansas. POM, it has been alleged was under secret contract to make components of che mical and biological weapons for use by the Contras, as well as special equipment for 130 transport planes...Such planes were at that time ferrying dru gs and weapons in out of Mena...POM's lawyer during those transactions was a partner in Rose law firm, of which Hillary Clinton was, and is, a member. Cli nton's state thus appears to have been an important link in the Contra supply li ne at a time when military aid to the Contras had been banned by Congress.\" \"We come now to Michael Risconosciouto, a former co ntract employee of the CIA, who says he worked at Mena on and off between 1988-1989. Risconosciuto was arrested shortly after being named as a witness in the Inslaw case...He was arrested on ten drug related charges and has been c onvicted on seven...According to Risconosciuto, Mena was part of a network of bases that evolved over time...Mena was crucial because of its central location relativ e to other bases...Mena was the main drop-off point for narcotics, the other bases servi ng as distribution points...To Risconoscioto's knowledge, no drugs were ever unloa ded at the Mena airport.

The leftwing magazine \"The Nation\" did another arti cle on Clinton and the accusations made about Gennifer Flowers from which we now present extracts: \"The allegations about Bill Clinton's sex life were first presented in a lawsuit by Larry Nichols, fired by Clinton from his job as marketing director of the Arkansas Development Finance Authority (ADFA). Clin ton claims that Nicols was axed for making 700 unauthorized phone calls to Con tras in Central America and that the lawsuit is part of a Republican frame-up. The sequence is more complicat- ed, stemming from the State's role, and specificall y that of an airport at Mena in western Arkansas in the training and supply of the Contras; also the arms-for-drugs flow between the United States and Central America. .. A student organization at the University of Arkansas, Fayetville, which has long been investigating the Mena affair, has successfully requested, under F.O.I.A. laws, Nichol's phone toll records, from ADFA.

'The Christian religion is not a suitable religion for today.\" Edward Lindeman. Socialist-Christian writer. While it is true that Fabian Socialism set its sigh ts on penetrating all reli- gions, the real target was always the Christian rel igion. In its earliest days, the Fabian Society called its one-sheet pamphlets, \"tra cts,\" the term used by Christian missionaries, and this was done to deliberately mis lead the public as to Fabian Socialism's dislike of organized religion. Perhaps the most evil influence on reli- gious beliefs was the so-called German Rationalizat ion, which came from Bismarck and Marx, who considered religion no more than a social science. In the United States, the evil Socialist leader, Jo hn D. Rockefeller worked to move churches to the left, using lay preacher infil trators. One of his servants, Paul Blanshard was used for the formation of an organiza tion called \"Protestants and Other Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.\" This doctrine is one of the most successful falsehoods and hoaxes ev er perpetrated on the American people. There is no such power in the Cons titution, it does not exist. One of the first Christian churches in America to b e \"Socialized\" was the Grace Church of South Boston, where The Reverend W. D. Bliss was the pastor. A great friend of Sydney Webb, Bliss' missionary ze al on behalf of the Fabian Society was commendable, but his professed Christia nity did not extend to teach- ing the Gospel of Christ. Another corrupter of the Christian religion was Father (later Monsignor) John Augustin Ryan, whose gospel was that taught by the Bnglish Socialist, John Hobson. Ryan formed a group called the National Catholic Welfare Council which was used by Fabian S ocialists to penetrate and"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"150 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship permeate Catholic churches all across America. Ryan went on to become known as \"the padre of the New Deal\" and was used by Roos evelt get the \"blessing of religion for his more controversial New Deal bills. \" But the real center of Socialist-religious activity in the United States was the Riverside Church, a Rockefeller \"social science Chr istian\" church, funded by the New York City Rockefeller Foundation. From this van tage point, inroads where made into the political life of the nation, particu larly through the Dulles Family, who dominated the Federal Council of Churches of Ch rist in America (FCCA) The FCCA was one of the very first \"religious group s\" to enthusiastically back Roosevelt's \"New Deal.\" The 1935, the United States Navy intelligence servi ce named the FCCA as the leader of pacifism: \"...This is a large radical pacifist organization... its leader- ship consists of a small radical group that is alwa ys very active in any matter against national defense. 'The Dies Committee took sworn testimony from an expert witness who stated as follows: \"Apparently, in lieu of promoting Christianity among its several members it (the FCCA ) more represents a huge political machine and appears to meddle in radical politics. Its directorate indi- cates that it interlocks with many of the most radi cal organizations.\" In 1933, the Rev. Albert W. Beaven and 44 co-sponso rs, delivered a letter to Roosevelt, in which they strongly urged him to Soci alize America. Another \"churchman,\" the Rev Dr. Kirby Page, told Roosevelt to support the Bolsheviks. \"The aim of the proletariat in Russia was to establ ish a better life...It is difficult to find youth anywhere in this world more devoted t o the cause of Christ than you'll find in Russia devoted to Stalin...,\" Kirby said. Dr. Harry F. Ward, another leading light in the FCC A, actually resigned from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in 1925 b ecause it barred \"totalitar- ians\" from its membership. The year before, Ward — then ACLU's chairman — had spoken out in favor of defending Socialist and Communist causes. This was at a time when Ward was Professor of Christian Ethi cs at the Union Theological Seminary, New York. Through his excellence in penet ration and permeation tac- tics. Ward was able to subvert three generations of future American church lead- ers and steer them into the Socialist camp. The Reverend Niebuhr was another prominent Socialis t named by an expert called by Dies Committee hearings. Niebuhr held the post of Professor of Applied Christianity and Dean of the Union Theological Semi nary, and was one of the very earliest American Fabian Socialists to push th e book, \"A New Deal\" by Graham Wallas, a leading Fabian Society writer. In 1938, Niebuhr joined the Fabian Socialist American Association of University Professors, which called itself \"a progressive educational body.\" As we know by now, \"progressive\" is merely another word for \"Socialist.\" Niebuhr was al so identified as being the sec- retary of the Students League for Industrial Democr acy (SLID) (which later"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Socialist Penetration and Permeation of Religion 151 became the League of Industrial Democracy), the ult ra Socialists student's orga- nization that was heavily into radical politics. Many of the student-members of SLID went on to join the Democrat Party, rather than try to form their own Socialist Party. It was from this beginning that the Democrat Party became infested with Socialists, until today, it is estimated by intelligence specialist contacts of mine, that as m uch as 86 percent of Democrat Party membership is made up of hard core Socialists . Niebuhr later was to have a profound influence over the Kennedy brothers, Rober t citing Niebuhr's book, \"Children of Light, Children of Darkness\" (a pagan cultist book) as one often books he would take to the moon if he ever had to g o there. Niebuhr's influence ranged far and wide, spreading his \"progressive\" politics among Socialist members of Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), and LID. During all of his political life, Niehbur preached the \"Social Gospel\" which later became known as Marxist Liberation Theology. He bec ame a close friend of Arthur Schlesinger Jr, preaching that \"capitalism w as a sickness\" and that vio- lence was in the eye of the beholder. Schlesinger w ent on to play a very signifi- cant role in Socializing America, proving that reli gious Socialism was a devastat- ing weapon in the right (or wrong) hands. Niehbur o penly embraced Marxism (although a totally godless creed and strange belie f for a minister said to be as teacher of the Gospel), saying that it was \"essenti ally a correct theory and analy- sis of the economic realities of modern society.\" This so-called \"theologian\" was also active in cont rolling the press, having been appointed by Rockefeller to the \"Commission on Freedom of the Press.\" Inevitably, Niehbur was appointed to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) on the instructions of David Rockefeller. Thus, in the religious theater of Socialist operations, we see that Fabian Socialism has been v ery busy in the United States and learned the lesson well that using religion as a means of penetration and per- meation of society as a whole, was a very important one. We were led to believe that the Bolsheviks and their Socialist cousins wer e against all forms of religion. In fact this is not true at all. The Socialist/Bols hevik hatred of religion was direct- ed more toward Christianity than any other religion . One way in which the Socialists have been able to k eep their grip on orga- nized religion is through the Fellowship of Faiths, which was first established as a Socialist organization in 1921 and just recently, completely revived in readiness for the coming One World Government — New World Ord er. This is an organi- zation meant to control religion — a long-time goal of Socialism — which real- ized that religion can never be stamped out. Senior Statesman of the Committee of 300, Bertrand Russell put the Socialists attitud e to religion in this way: \"If we cannot take control of it, then we must get rid of it. \" But getting rid of religion was easier said than done, so \"control\" was the met hod chosen. Not all wars thus fought have been able to rid the world of religion.

Socialist Cutler seeks to weaken the Constitution s o that protection and freedom to worship and follow one's religion may thereby be abridged. The shocking mass murder of United States citizens at Waco, Texas is a recent example of just how far the Socialists are p repared to go to do away with religious freedom. The events that led up to more C hristian United States citizens being killed than Chinese students in Tienenman Squ are, are too well known to be recounted here, but some aspects need clarificat ion and amplification: The first item to consider is this: Where in the Co nstitution does it say that the Federal Government has the right to interfere i n the religious affairs of ANY church, as it interfered and intervened in the affa irs of the Branch Davidian Christian Church? Where in the Constitution does it say that the Federal Government has the right to decide what is a \"cult\" and what is not? Let Attorney General Reno show us where this power is given to f ederal law enforcement agencies. The truth of the matter is that it is not found; it is not in the Constitution! Nowhere in the delegated powers of Congress in Arti cle 1, Section 8, Clause 1-18 is the power to attack a \"cult\" given. To allo w a Federal agency to interject itself into the Branch Davidian Church and then att ack it with force of arms, as they did in Waco, would take an amendment to the Co nstitution of the United States. What happened in Waco was treason and sedit ion against the Constitution and the American people. In using military vehicles to attack civilians in a Christian church we must suppose that the intention was to terrorize citizens and deprive them of their rights: Article 1 of the Bill of Rights of the United State s Constitution states: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establish ment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof; or abridge the freedom o f speech, or of the press, or of the right of people to peacefully assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\" Note the use of the word \"shall\" which is very much stronger than \"will.\" Also note the words, \"respecting the establishment of religion.\" Embodied in the word \"establishment\" is the implicit understanding that it also means, the act of establishing, or in plain language, a NEWLY ESTABLI SHED ENTITY. In this case the newly established entity was the Branch Da vidian Church. Thus, the Federal Government was duty bound under the law to PROTECT the Davidians, NOT MURDER THEM. The Federal Government went into Waco with the expr ess intention of pro- hibiting the free exercise of religion by members o f the Christian Branch"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Socialist Penetration and Permeation of Religion 153 Davidian Church. It prohibited the Branch David ian members to assemble peace- fully. What the Federal Government said, was, \"we s ay that you are a cult and that we don't like your religion, and so we are going to shut your church down.\" To accomplish this, the Federal Government brought in military vehicles which they then used to assault the church building s and kill the members of the Branch Davidian Church. On Page E7151 of July 31, 1 968, Congressional Record, Justice William O. Douglas said\"... It is i mpossible for government to draw a line between good and bad and be true to the Constitution, better to let all ideas alone.\" The United States Government chose to ignore this ruling and they tried to go in an simplify religion, to boil it dow n to good or bad, with the Federal Government the arbiters. The Federal Government tri ed to make religion a sim- ple affair when it is a very complex one, in which they should not have been med- dling under any conditions whatsoever. The first ten Amendments to the Constitution of the United States are a restriction on the Federal Government. In addition permission to legislate on reli- gion is also denied by Article 1, Section 9 of the constitution. The Federal Government has no absolute powers. The Branch David ians were entitled to police protection under the powers granted to the S tate in the 10th Amendment. The Sheriff of Waco failed in his duty when he woul d not respond to a call for help from a member of the Branch Davidian Church, r equesting that his do his duty, that duty being to defend citizens of the Sta te of Texas from marauding Federal agents. Had the sheriff done his duty, he w ould have taken his men to the site and ordered Federal agents off the property an d out of the State of Texas, where they had no jurisdiction. Unfortunately, the sheriff, either our of ignorance of the Constitution or in fear of his own safety, d id not interdict the armed and dangerous Federal agents, as he was bound to do by the Constitution. Under the Constitution of the United States, the re sponsibility for the pro- tection of \"life, liberty and property\" belongs to the States and not to the Federal Government. The Emma Goldman case settled that fore ver. (The perpetrator was tried in a State court and executed by the State fo r the murder of President McKinley, although the murder of a President was, a nd still is a Federal crime.) The 14th Amendment, even though unratified did not try to shift responsibility for police protection from the States to the Federal Go vernment. So what we had at Waco was an unauthorized attack on a religious comm unity compounded by the abject failure of the sheriff to protect the citize ns of the State of Texas against unlawful, illegal assault by Federal agents. In consequence, the Branch Davidian citizens of the State of Texas were unlawfully, illegally and with malice aforethought, deprived of life, liberty and property, without due process, and denied a trial b y jury, while the sheriff of Waco, responsible for administering State law, stoo d by and did nothing to stop these attacks. Charges for failing to carry out his duties should be brought against"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"154 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorshi the sheriff of Waco. The immunity clause of Article IV, Part I was grossly violat- ed: \"The citizens of each State shall be entitled t o all of the privileges and immu- nities of citizens in the Several States.\" The Federal Government under the Constitution of th e United States has no power to rule on what is a church and what is a cul t. The power of the Federal Government to decided what is a cult and what is a religion is the power to DESTROY ALL RELIGIONS as the Socialists would prefe r, and which is their ultimate aim. The 1 st Amendment to the Constitutio n DOES NOT give this power nor is the power delegated to Congress. Instead, wh at we had was public opinion made by the media, with the repetition for days on end that the Branch Davidian Church was a \"cult\" as if that was enough legal san ction for the Federal agents to storm the church buildings. Waco was not the first time that the Federal Govern ment has interfered in religious matters, and most certainly, won't be the last. In pages 11995-2209 of the Congressional Record, Senate, Feb. 16, 1882, we read with horror how the government tried to stop some Mormons from voting. On page 1197 we read part of the debate. \"...That right (to vote) belonged to the American civilization and law long before the Constitution was adopted. It is like the right of bearing arms, like many other rights that might be mentioned here , which existed in behalf of the citizens in colonial times in every State; and the provisions which were intro- duced in the Constitution by way of amendment, as w ell as in the original instru- ment, which stand for the protection of these right s, were mere guarantees of an existing right and were not the creators of the rig ht itself.\" The Mormons were regarded then as the Branch Davidi an church was regarded by the Federal Government. In 1882, the Se nate tried to pass a bill that would have appointed a commission of five people to act as judge and jury over the Mormons and stop them from voting. Apart from a nything else, this was a vio- lation of the bill of attainder. On page 1200 of pa ges 1195-1209, Senator Vest made the following statement: \"...For example, no one can presume, we will conten d that Congress can make any law in a Territory, respecting the establi shment of a religion, or the free exercise of, or abridge freedom of the press, or th e right of the people of the Territory peaceably to assemble, and to petition th e government for redress of grievances. Nor can Congress deny to the people the right to bear arms, nor the right to a trial by jury, nor compel anyone to be a witness against himself in a criminal proceeding. These powers, and other in rel ation to the rights of persons, which it is not necessary here to enumerate, are, i n express and positive terms denied in the general Government; and the rights of private property have been guarded with equal care.\" Upon examination the foregoing statement of fact re garding the protection afforded by the Constitution and its Bill of Rights , we are struck with horror of"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Socialist Penetration and Permeation of Religion 155 the Waco situation; The Branch Davidians were not g iven any protection guaran- teed by the Constitution. The powers of police prot ection were abandoned by the Sheriff of Waco, the Federal Government attacked th e members of the Branch Davidian Church, wantonly, savagely and barbarously took their lives, and utter- ly destroyed their property in defiance of their \"r ights to private property being guarded with equal care.\" We can see how far we hav e regressed since 1882, when the bill to stop the Mormons from voting was d efeated. Why were the Branch Davidians denied every single o ne of their rights? Why were they treated as an enemy trying to invade our shores would have been treated; with military equipment, helicopters, tank s, bulldozers, and finally, with fire that destroyed them all? Were their rights to a jury trial upheld, if, indeed the Federal Government had any legitimate charge agains t them before their agents went into church property with guns drawn? All that has happened, is that the perpetrators of the crimes say, almost blithely, that they take responsibility for the bar barous acts of their servants! What we saw at the brutal massacre at Waco was Socialism /Communism in action. The religion preached by David Koresh may one day have been accepted as an estab- lished religion, like Mary Baker Eddy's Christian S cience and the Mormons are accepted religions today. These religions might, in their beginnings, have been classed as \"a cult,\" though the word did not have t he same connotation then, which it has now. But the Federal Socialist Governm ent was afraid that is what might happen with Koresh, as it had happened with M ary Baker Eddy, so they went in and nipped it in the bud. Socialism is determined to control religion, and no where is this more evident that in their so-called \"Fellowship of Faiths.\" War s have not been able to rid the world of religion; the Bolsheviks took the lives of 60 million Russian people, the vast majority of whom were Christians. They turned Christian churches into houses of prostitution, stripped them of valuable a rt, and sold their plunder through the offices of such traitors as Armand Hamm er. Christians have been per- secuted and killed in terrible massacres, beginning with the Romans and contin- uing to this day, as we witnessed at Waco. The Socialists, having realized that they cannot de stroy religion by killing its believers and followers, took to trying to control it. They formed the spurious One World Government \"Fellowship of Faiths\" as a vehicl e for taking control of all religions. In tandem with religious control, we are supposed to believe that Communism is dead and that it will soon be archaic. This is not so, Communism will never change. It may do so on the surface, but at the core, there will be little change. What will change is Socialism, as it gains more power and then, when it has taken full control of the world, it will reintr oduce Communism as the taskmaster of the peoples of the earth. Where does the Fellowship of Faiths fit in the scen ario? How can it affect"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"156 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship political events in a profound manner as is expecte d of it, and anticipated by its founders? The task of the unification of religion, that is to say, \"standardizing\" it, fell to Socialist Keddrantah Das Gupta, an executiv e member of the War Resisters League, and an advocate of armed revolution against our republic. Although dreamed up in 1910, the first formal session of the Fellowship was held in Chicago in 1933. Its true nature was exposed by Sir Rabindrath Tagore, founder of a pro-Communist political movement in India. Bishop Montgomery Brown, the keynote speaker of the first FF seminar, said, \"there will exist a complete World Fellowship of Faiths only when the Gods are banished from the skies and capitalists from ea rth.\" Clearly, the Fellowship was a Socialist enterprise from its inception. Sir Rabinddrath, in his written and spoken words, stressed the need for sex education i n very young children, We tend to think of sex education for the young as a c urse only recently descended upon us, but it actually goes back as far as the pr iests of Baal and the Egyptian priesthood of Osiris. It would have been surprising to find Christian min isters and leaders actual- ly accepting the idea of standardized religion and working with the haters of Christianity, were it not for the very same thing h appening in the 1980s-1990s. In 1910, the World Friendship of Faiths was being prom oted by Sir Francis Younghusband who pointed out that the idea of an Ea st-West union of religions should be brought about. Sir Francis did not say th e originator of the idea, Das Gupta, was a rabid Communist, seeking to promote th at vile doctrine. Sir Francis gave the history of \"standardized\" religion as foll ows: \"The idea occurred to Mr. Das Gupta and he worked f or 25 years on it and latterly found a cordial co-operator in an American , Mr. Charles F. Weller...In America a Parliament of Religion assembled in 1893. In Paris in 1904 com- menced a series of sessions of the International Co ngress of the History of Religions. Other sessions were held in Basle, Oxfor d and Leiden.\" (All centers for \"standardizing\" religion and the promoters toda y of the Marxist doctrine of Liberation Theology.) \"In London in 1924, a Conference of the Living Reli gions of the Empire (the British Empire) was held. In 1913 in Chicago, conti nued in 1934 in New York, a Congress World Fellowship of Faiths, convened under the presidency of the Honorable Herbert Hoover and Miss Jane Addams.\" The presence of Miss Addams at these proceedings was a tip-off that here was rabid Socialism at work under the guise of religion. Miss Addams' history i s given in the chapters on Socialist women. The idea was to submerge Christian ity in a flood tide of other religions. But Christianity cannot be \"standardized ,\" it is unique and stands alone. Its teachings are the basis of capitalism which hav e since been replaced by Babylonialism, and today, capitalism has been so pr ostituted and debased as to be unrecognizable as the original system."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Socialist Penetration and Permeation of Religion 157 Without Christianity, the world will be plunged int o a New Dark Age, far worse than anything that has gone before. This shou ld help to explain why the detractors of Christianity are so eager to destroy it, or at least control it, so that it might be watered down, diluted, rendered useless. T he Fellowship of Faiths sought to merge Christianity with other religions a nd so cause the loss of it as unique identity. The idea of a \"separation of churc h and state doctrine\" is the work of Socialists inside the United States Government. What it ought to be called, is, THE SUPPRESSION OF CHRISTIANITY WITHIN THE STATE. Joining the enterprise of \"standardizing\" religion were Keith Hardie, a Socialist member of the British Labour Party, Felix Adler, founder of the Leftwing Ethical, Culture Society of New York, H.G. Wells, the noted Socialist author, who represented Lord Bertrand Russell. Well s was a member of the secret Masonic society Kibbo Kift Kindred, \"Clarte,\" which had its headquarters in the Grand Orient Nine Sisters Lodge in Paris, the Lodge that played a leading role in the bloody French Revolution. Moses Hess, an unabashed revolutionary Communists i n the world at the time, joined with Wells in support of the Society f or Cultural Relations with Soviet Russia. It was inside the confines of the Ni ne Sisters Lodge that Wells made a statement that was to brand him as a hater o f Christianity: \"Henceforth the new world government will not brook the competition of rival religious systems. It will have no place for Christianity. There must henceforth be only one faith in the world, the moral expression of the world commun ity.\" Annie Besant, a notable member of the Fabian Societ y, stepped forward to add her name to the list of those who opposed Chris tianity. Besant was the spiri- tual successor to Madame Blavatsky, founder of the Theosophy Society and a friend of H.G. Wells. Mr. Charles Wells of the Capi talist-Communist Alliance was a millionaire in his own right at a period in histo ry where the term \"millionaire\" really meant something. The task of organizing an American chapter of the F ellowship of Faiths was given to Weller, who quickly received the blessing of Samuel Untermeyer, a lead- ing World Zionist and confidant of President Wilson , who immediately endorsed it after it was presented to him in the Oval Office . As Mr. Samuel Landman of the New York Zionists said, \"Mr. Woodrow Wilson, for go od and sufficient reasons, always attached the greatest importance to the advi ce of a very prominent Zionist.\" The \"good and sufficient reasons\" referred to by Mr . Landmann was a pack- et of love letters written by Wilson to a Mrs. Peck , who in exchange for help promised by Untermeyer to get her son out of a crim inal corner, handed the bun- dle of letters tied with a pink ribbon, either to U ntermeyer, or Baruch. Wilson had a great passion for affairs with married ladies, th e Peck romance being a particu- larly long-lasting and torrid one. Foolishly, Wilso n conveyed his lovelorn feelings"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"158 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship to Mrs. Peck — in writing. It was this indiscretion which is cited as the method used to blackmail Wilson to commit the United State s to WWI, which buried the flower of Christian American manhood in the fields of Flanders, and ail-but bank- rupted this nation. Later, the support of the Leagu e of Neighbors, a Socialist \"church\" front, given to Wilson, almost carried the day for the League of Nations. Chairman of the Provincial Executive Committee for General Zionist Affairs, Justice Brandeis, was succeeded by Rabbi S tephen Wise, who happened to be a member of the pro-Socialist Emergency Peace Federation front as well as nineteen other fronts. Brandeis was also a member o f the London Fabian Society. Many of the old \"religious Socialist\" organizations are still in existence today, although they have changed their names to move with changing times and cir- cumstances. Upton Sinclair, rabid Socialist turned author who w rote for the \"New Encyclopedia of Social Reform\" and was a founder me mber of the American Fabian League, strongly supported the Fellowship of Faiths. Sinclair consistently gave Christianity a minus during his entire career. What neither Sinclair, Wise, Addams, nor indeed, many of the Fellowship's suppor ters told the public, was that it was a Freemasonic-inspired movement, throug h and through. In 1926 the Fellowship of Faiths was a well-established friend of world revolution, dominat- ed by Rosicrucianists on the executive board and co mmittee memberships. The Threefold Movement started in 1924 by Charles W eller and Das Guptas, held meetings all over the United States and Britai n. By 1925 they had held 325 such meetings. Among the leaders of the Threefold M ovement were M.S. Malik, a member of the Beni-Israel sect; Dr. A.D. Jilla re presenting the Parsees; M.A. Dard, representing Mohammedanism; Sir Arthur Conon Doyle (of Sherlock Holmes fame) representing Spiritualism (note: this was the first time it was held out to be a religion), Buddhism, represented by Ang arika Dharmapala: Theosophy represented by Annie Besant. The important point to bear in mind in all of this is that all of these religions were, and are, essentia lly anti-Christian. Another point is that Fellowship of Faiths literature was sold in Communist bookstores all over Britain, Western Europe and the United States. The First World Congress of the Fellowship of Faith s was opened in Chicago in 1933, hosted by Miss Jane Addams. One of the pri ncipal speakers was Bishop Montgomery Brown, National Chairman of the Communis t Workers Relief, and a member of fifty other Communist front organizatio ns. In his opening address, Brown said: 'There is one place on earth where they have dared to end exploitation of man — Russia! In Russia, science has replaced relig ion which is being stamped out...The USSR is the forerunner of International C ommunism which will grad- ually absorb all the capitalist states which are gr adually decaying away.

If world unity is to be attained, it must be arrived at through internation al Communism, which can only be attained through the slogan: 'Banish Gods from t he skies and capitalists from the earth.' Then, and then only, will there exist a complete World Fellowship of Faiths.\" Weller and Brown were effusive in their praise of B ishop Brown, Das Gupta stating, \"I am sure that others feel as I do, that they have the same beliefs as Bishop Brown, but have not had the courage to speak out and admit it. I want to say that I am thoroughly in agreement with the Bish op's sentiments.\" Brown wrote a number of works, including one entitled, 'T eachings of Marx for Boys and Girls,\" plus seventeen short books on sex for c hildren which were widely dis- tributed. A survey conducted by the authorities fou nd that all those who were part of the structure and membership of the Fellowship o f Faiths were also Freemasons. The Freemasons established a front to cover their a ctivities at the League of Nations conference in Paris, the organization being called The League of Nations Union. It played a profound role in the deliberatio ns that went on at the Paris Peace Conference which virtually ensured that there would be another world war. As Sir Francis Younghusband said, \"We are here to p rovide a firm spiritual basis for the League of Nations.\" We can best judge what KIND of a spiritual basis was provided, by simply studying the structure of the U nited Nations, the League's successor. It is in the confines of the United Nati ons and its religious executive arm, the World Council of Churches (WCC) that a rev ival of the Fellowship of Faiths is taking place. We, in the United States and the West in general, c annot afford to turn a blind eye to this revival. Either we believe that the Chr istian religion is the basis of the Constitution of the United States, and stand on tha t, or we shall perish. \"Tolerance,\" \"understanding,\" must not be allowed t o blindside us to the truth, and unless we make a stand now, it may well be too late tomorrow. That is how serious the situation has become for the future of the Nation. Either Christianity is the true religion as Jesus Christ has stated, or it is totally without substance. \"Tolerance\" and \"understanding\" cannot be allowed t o obscure this important principle. Christianity brought to the world a perfect economi c system that has been deliberately prostituted, so that today, it is virt ually unrecognizable. The Socialists/Marxists/Communists would have us believ e that their system is supe- rior, but when we look at the countries they have c ontrolled — Russia, Britain, Sweden, we see ruination and misery on a grand scal e. The Socialists strive mightily to bring their system to bear, which will lead to slavery. Religion is one of the most important areas that they have penetrat ed, and therefore, the more dangerous. This is not just a religious issue, but also a matter of survival of the"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"160 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship Republic, based upon the laws of God, which include immutable political and economic laws, and not a matter of \"democracy\" base d upon the laws of man. We need to bear this in mind: Every pure democracy in the history of the world has failed. It is important to link these things together, part icularly, as I discovered that the Fellowship of Faiths members voted en-bloc for the Socialist ticket in the 1932 elections in which Roosevelt, their Socialist idol, was successful. This was particularly true in both New York and Chicago. The anti-Christian crusade will pick up steam as the big lie spreads around the wor ld that Communism is dead. While it is true that Communism is lying low, SOCIA LISM is rampant, particu- larly in the United States, where our churches have been thoroughly penetrated and permeated by Socialist change agents. To accept the One World Government — New World Order Fellowship of Faiths, we would ha ve to sacrifice Christianity. A most serious revolution is taking place in the Un ited States. The Weishaupt revolution against the Christian Church has reached new levels of bestiality with the promotion of homosexuality and lesbian ism, \"fr ee love\" (abortion) and a gen- eral lowering of the moral standards of the Nation. One of the principal leaders in this revolution is the World Council of Churches (W CC), the religious arm of the United Nations. WCC activities have resulted in far -reaching changes in the polit- ical, religious and economic life of the Nation. Th e WCC has always known that religion does not stop at the portals of the church . The Federal Council of Churches (FCC), forerunner o f the WCC, had as its plank, penetration and permeate civil government, p articularly in the field of edu- cation and labor relations. Mark Starr, the British Socialist appointed by Roosevelt to a number of government posts, was used by the FCC to visit facto- ries and distribute the Fabian Society's publicatio n, \"What the Church Thinks of Labor,\" a thoroughly Marxists diatribe against capi talism. The FCC was run on radical Socialist lines according to the methods la id down by Sydney and Beatrice Webb, its founders, and its membership of the Third International shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that the FCC/WCC was, and is, a nti-Christian. The FCC/WCC were run by pagans for pagans as its pa st history reveals, and as we see it today. One such pagan was Walter Rausc henbach who visited with Sydney and Beatrice Webb and then took their ideas, plus what he had learned from reading Marx, Mazzini and Edward Bellamy, to t he Second Baptist Church in New York. Instead of the Gospel of Christ, Rausc henbach preached the gospel of Socialism according to Marx, Engels, Ruskin and the Freemasonic-Socialism of Mazzini.

The FCC set the stage for the plague of homosexuali ty and lesbianism, not to mention \"free love\" without responsibility (abor tion) that has descended upon the Nation. The FCC was, and the WCC is, the staunc hest supporters of homo- sexuality and lesbianism, and were strongly support ive of so-called \"constitu- tional\" protection for these groups. Homosexuality is not mentioned as a \"right\" any where in the Constitution of the United States, and is, therefore a prohibition. \"Homosexual rights\" are a figment of the overripe m inds of Socialist legislators and certain Supreme Court Justices. In this the WCC was backed by the American Civil Li berties Union (ACLU), who tried to twist and squeeze the Constitution to create non-existent \"rights\" for those who chose the homosexual way of life. As we s hall see in the chapters on law, courts, and the Congress, anyone of standing w ho protested the acceptance of these non existent \"rights,\" soon found themselv es in trouble. The Fellowship of Faiths was formed for consolidati ng opinions on religious matters colored with Socialism gathered from around the world One of its strong- holds is the Bahai movement. Bahaism was started in Persia in 1844 (today known as Iran), by Mirza Ali Muhammad, also known a s \"Rab\" or \"Gate.\" Unfortunately for \"Rab\" he was killed by security f orces in Tabriz. Bahaism teaches that Zoroaster, Buddha, Confucius and Jesus Christ were leaders who pre- pared the way for the coming of the Mighty World Ed ucator, Baha u'lla (the Glory of God), whose forerunner, Abdul Baha, died i n 1921. The Bahai movement is very strong in Iran and Austr alia, and to a lesser extent, England. Since Freemasonry and Theosophy ar e virtually indistinguish- able from each other, and carry elements found in t he Bahai faith, it is no wonder that the Bahai religion spread so quickly. Madame P etrova Blavatsky, Co-Mason, Vice President of the Supreme Council and Grand Mas ter of the Supreme Council for Great Britain, creator of Theosophy, greatly fa vored the Bahai movement which is a convergence of these three streams. What happened to the Fellowship of Faiths? Shortly before WWI it almost merged with World Zionism and then emergedins the L eague of Nations. Then, just before WWII, it emerged as the Bahai movement in England, and in England formed itself into the Oxford Group, which was succ eeded by Moral Rearmament. Following the close of WWII, it played a key role in the formation of the United Nations (UN) and penetrated the heart of American political life through such outright Socialists organizations as t he following: American Association of University Professors American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Americans for Democratic Action (ADA)"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"162 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship Committee for Economic Development Hull House (center for radical feminism) National Council of Women The League of Industrial Democracy Social Democrats USA Institute for Policy Studies NATO, political wing Club of Rome The Cini Foundation Cambridge Policy Studies Institute Committee for a Democratic Majority Lucius Trust New Democratic Coalition War Resisters League Aspen Institute Stanford Research National Organization for Women The Fellowship of Faiths is an \"Olympian\" (Committe e of 300) project. This ensures that the richest and most powerful people i n the world will promote its aims, as we saw in the \"Class Reunion\" of Fellowshi p of Faiths held in Chicago in 1993. The American people will have to choose be tween letting Christian prin- ciples go to the wall, or risk a world revolution. This was suggested by Mikhail Gorbachev when he met with Pope John Paul II. Gorba chev suggested a \"con- vergence of religious ideals\" which would be the fi rst step toward a revived Fellowship of Faiths in its original name. But Pope John Paul II reminded him, \"Christianity b rought into this conti- nent by the Apostles, penetrated into various parts by the actions of Benedict, Cyril, Methuselah, Adalbert, and countless hosts of Saints, is at the very root of European culture.\" The Pope was not talking about a ny other religion having bestowed the benefits of civilization upon Europe: He was talking about Christianity. He did not say the growth of a great European culture was due to the Cathars or Albergensians; it was Christianity alone , he said, that brought civiliza- tion to Europe. This is at the root of the hatred felt toward Chris tianity by the Communist/Marxist/Socialists, who greatly fear that the unifying force of Christianity will be the stumbling block over which their One World Government — New World Order will trip and fall. This is why t he Socialist drive to negate and eventually wipe out Christianity, is a matter o f urgent necessity.

Socialis t destruction of our Republic is carried out on many fronts, but none so venomous, s editious, surreptitious and treasonous as so-called \"free trade.\" Any person who believes in \"free trade\" needs to be deprogramed and freed from Socialist propaganda-brainwashing. Go back to the beginning of this nation: Clause 1 of Section 8, Article 1, \"To collect taxes , duties, imports and excises. To pay debts and provide for the common defense and ge neral welfare of the United States, but all duties, imports and excises shall b e uniform throughout the United States.\" Governor Morris wrote Section 8 and it is interesting to note that he implied that duties are related to paying the bills of the country. There is no men- tion of graduated income taxes here for that purpos e. The Socialists came along with their treasonous sch emes and tried to nullify and repeal this section of the Constitution through the unratified, ultra-vires so- called 16th Amendment to the United States Constitu tion. They knew that Clause 1 of Section 8, Article I in the Constitution was t o prevent the British from inflict- ing \"free trade\" on the Colonists. If we read the A nnals of Congress and Congressional Globes of the late 1700s and early 18 00s, it will quickly be impressed upon us that one of the principal causes of the American Revolution was an attempt by the British East India Company (B EIC) to impose Adam Smith's \"free trade\" on the colonies.

It is the old shell game, brought up to date! \"Free trade\" was the shell game that the British East India Company (BEI C) used to deprive the American colonists of their wealth, disguising thei r cut-purse tactics with nice- sounding economic phrases, in themselves, meaningle ss. The Founding Fathers did not have the benefit of fi rst hand experience to warn them of the \"free trade\" wars that would desce nd on the colonies, but they had the perspicacity and foresight to know that if allowed, \"free trade\" would wreck the young nation. It was for this reason that President George Washington, having witnessed the terrible devastation wrought i n France for the cause of \"free trade\" and dubbed the \"French Revolution,\" in 1789 declared that it was neces- sary and proper for the young Republic to protect i tself from the machinations of the British government: \"A free people should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent on others for essential particularly mi litary supplies.\" — George Washington, First Congress of the United States, 17 89. The Founding Fathers saw from the very beginning th at protection of our trade was paramount, and made it virtually the firs t order of business. No nation which is serious about its sovereignty and protecti ng the welfare of its people, would allow \"free trade.\" As Joseph Chamberlain sai d, in his Preface to \"The Case Against Free Trade\" in 1911: \"Free trade is the negation of organization, of set tled and consistent policy. It is a triumph of chance, the disordered and selfi sh competition of immediate individual interests without regard to the permanen t welfare as a whole.\" Alexander Hamilton and the Founding Fathers underst ood that the nation would have to protect its internal market if it wan ted to remain sovereign and independent. That was what made America great in th e first place: the explosion of industrial progress in the nation, independent o f any outside \"global trade.\" Washington and Hamilton knew that to surrender our internal markets to the world would be tantamount to foregoing our national sovereignty. Socialists know the importance of getting rid of th e protective trade barriers of independent nations, as opposed to only now and then breaching them, and they waited their chance to elect Woodrow Wilson fo r that purpose. As the new President, Wilson's first order of business was to take active measures to smash the tariff barriers erected by Washington and then enlarged and kept in place by Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley. As we saw earlier, the first order of business of t he Fabian Socialist who put President Woodrow Wilson in power was to break down the trade barriers and protective tariffs that had made the United States a great nation in a relatively short time, relative, that is, to the age of older European powers. The NAFT Agreement and GATT take up where Wilson and Rooseve lt left off. Both agree-"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Planned Destruction of the United States Through Fr ee Trade 167 ments violate the Constitution of the United States and are the work of The Fabian Society and their American cousins. The North American Free Trade Agreement is project of the Committee of 300 and a natural extension of the war on American industry and agriculture as set out in the Club of Rome's 1969 Post Industrial Zero Growth position papers overseen by Cyrus Vance and a team of One World Gov ernment-New World Order scientists. Breaking down the trade barriers erected by Washington, Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley was long a cherished goal of the Fabian Society. NAFTA is their concoction, their big chance to open the markets of the United States to one-way \"free trade'' and through it, dea l a mortal blow to the American middle class. NAFTA is another triumph for Florence Kelley in tha t it gets around the Constitution by legislative action. As Judge Cooley said in his work on Constitutional law, page 35: \"The constitution itse lf never yields to a treaty or enactment. It neither changes with time nor does it bend to the force of circum- stances.\" Therefore, neither NAFTA nor any other tr eaty can change the Constitution. NAFTA is nothing but a crooked, lying , sneaky Iowdown scheme to circumvent the Constitution, also an accurate descr iption of GATT. The first known \"free trade\" attack on the United S tates came in 1769 when the Townsend Act was invented by Adam Smith to sque eze revenues out of the American colonies. The NAFTA agreement is designed to squeeze more out of the American worker, or if the workers are unwillin g, the workgiver will relocate abroad where wages and life are generally cheaper. In essence, NAFTA has a lot in common with the struggle of the colonists in the period 1769-1776. Tragically, in later years several presidents moved away from t rade policies that protected American industry and made the United States the gr eatest industrialized nation in the world. Globalism played no part in making America great. G lobalism is a catchword of the Madison Avenue media brainwashers to disguis e the fact that the so-called global economy touted by Wilson, Roosevelt, Bush an d Clinton will eventually reduce America's living standards to that of Third World countries. Here we have a classic case where through Socialism, Americans a re fighting again the American Revolution of 1776 to set the nation free of the toils of the fraud that is called NAFTA, with an even bigger fraud called GATT waiting to march onto the battlefield. In 1992, Bush eagerly picked up the NAFTA ball and began to run with it. Canada was used as a measuring stick to see how wel l NAFTA would sit with the Canadian people. In this Bush was ably assisted by former prime minister Brian Mulroney. The purpose of NAFTA is to destroy the in dustrial and agricultural bases of both countries and thereby bring down the middle class.

The sit-"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"168 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship uation is rather akin to that which Bertrand Russel l described in his desire to kill off millions of \"useless eaters.\" Russell's plan ca lled for a return of the black plague to rid the world of what he called, \"excess population.\" NAFTA represents a high point in the realignment of transnational policies and the reeducation of those future leaders of Amer ican industry and trade who are just now graduating from our institutions of le arning. NAFTA may be com- pared with the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) which was dominated by Prince Klemmens von Metternich. It will be recalled that M etternich played a leading role in European affairs. He was responsible for th e marriage of Arch duchess Marie Louise to Napoleon, which shaped political an d economic events in Europe for at least 100 years. Clinton has in essence, \"ma rried\" the United States to \"free trade,\" which will likewise have a tremendous effec t upon this nation for more than 1,000 years. The Congress of Vienna was marked by lavish parties and glittering events, with an array of dazzling gifts for those who were willing to cooperate with Metternich instead of fighting for the best interes ts of their country. Similar tac- tics were used to force NAFTA through the House and Senate, and in the manner of the decision-making debates held behind closed d oors in Vienna (the four major powers never allowed the smaller nations to p articipate) every agreement, every decision of note concerning NAFTA was done in secret, behind closed doors. NAFTA will have a profound deleterious effec t upon the United States, the extent and depth of which we have yet to realize. NAFTA is the turning point in the history of North America, a watershed for the American and Canadian middle class. When combin ed with EC countries, phase two of the Socialist strategy to take complet e of control of trade will have been completed. NAFTA will result in an income of $ 100 billion for Mexico; it will devastate the American economy through a great decline in its industrial base. A loss of 100,000 American jobs is expected t o occur within the first two years of NAFTA being fully implemented, which will send the middle class stan- dard of living plummeting in a manner never before experienced. Pollution will be reexported to the United States through products and food from Mexico. Foodstuffs from Mexico will contain levels of toxic poisons of all kinds which are forbidden by USDA regulations covering Am erican products. Taking all things into account, the amount of money spent on NAFTA lobbying was close to $150 million. NAFTA lobbying was the most concen trated in the history of the United States, involving a veritable army of specia lists and lawyers who over- whelmed the House to vote in favor of the so-called agreement. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) i s an instrument designed in the United States, based upon Fabian So cialist principles.

GATT was put together at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment, held in Cuba, on March 24, 1948. Th e conference elegates advanced the cause of Adam Smith's \"free trade\" whi ch they said, would make the world a better place for the ordinary people. W hile the title, GATT was to come later, the groundwork for this Socialist fraud was laid in Cuba in 1948. When the agreement reached in Cuba was presented to the House and Senate, it was passed, for the simple reason that i t was not understood. Generally, when the House and Senate do not understand a measu re before them, the mea- sure gets passed as quickly as possible. This is wh at happened in the case of the Federal Reserve Act, the United Nations Treaty, the Panama Canal Treaty and NAFTA. By voting in favor of the NAFTA, the House transfer red United States sov- ereignty to the One World Government in Geneva, Swi tzerland. This seditious act had a precedent. In 1948, a Republican-dominated Ho use and Senate passed the Trade Agreement Act which arose from the United Nat ions meeting in Cuba. Hitherto, the Republican Party had held itself out to be the protector of American industry and American jobs, but it turned out to be as false as the Democrat posi- tion, and in favor of Adam Smith's Socialist \"free trade.\" A great blow was struck against American industry and trade by the Fabian S ocialists in Britain and their American cousins in the United States. The fact tha t the Trade Agreement Act was 100 percent unconstitutional, and yet it passed, wa s a cause of sweet satisfaction for the Fabian Society. By 1962, President John F. Kennedy was calling the sell-out of the American people, \"a wholly new approach, a bold new instrume nt of American trade poli- cy.\" In his fatally-flawed assessment of where the Fabian Socialists were taking the American people, Kennedy had been fully support ed by labor leader George Meaney at the AFL — CIO convention in Florida earli er that year. Congress duti- fully passed the legislation, seemingly oblivious o f its unconstitutionality. It was unconstitutional because it gave to the pres ident powers that belonged to Congress, powers that could not be transferred b etween the three branches of government. The Kennedy administration immediately instituted sweeping tariff cuts, some by as much as 50 percent on a broad rang e of imported goods. We saw the same unconstitutional actions by Bush and Clint on with NAFTA. Both presi- dents got unconstitutionally involved in the legisl ative branch. Bribery may have also been a factor. This is treason. As the United States entered the twentieth century, the country was on the road to success as no other country had been before it, dating back to antiquity. But the despoilers, the Socialists and their close cousins, the Communists, were lying in wait for America.

The trade protection measure, the Tariff Act of 186 4, which Lincoln signed, increased Customs duties by more than 47 percent. I n 1861 Customs receipts brought in 95 percent of the total revenues of the United States. Lincoln, with war on his hands was determined to reinforce the tradit ional tariff protection and pro- tect it at all costs. His actions on tariff protect ion, more than anything else, set the United States on the road to two decades of progres s in industry, agriculture and commerce, progress that stunned England and made th e United States an object of envy — and hatred. There is no doubt that the pl ot to assassinate Lincoln involved Benjamin Disraeli, England's prime ministe r and that the decision to murder Lincoln was taken in England because of the president's resolute stand against lowering tariffs on goods from that country . The United States is in a war to the death. This is not recognized, because there are no big drums of patriotism being banged; no flags flying high, no mili- tary parades, and perhaps the key to it all, the ja ckals of the press are playing \"free trade\" up as a benefit, not as the mortal enemy of the United States. It is a war on many fronts; just about the entire world is lined u p against the United States. It is a war that we are fast losing, thanks to skillfully laid plans of the Committee of 300 given to the Socialists to carry out. Lincoln w as one of the first casualties of the trade war. In 1873, the merchant bankers and City of London fi nanciers combined with their allies on Wall Street to contrive a panic tha t was due entirely to artificially- created causes. The prolonged depression that follo wed, badly hurt agriculture, as was the intention of our enemies. Most historian ag ree that the 1872 anti-United States action was taken to weaken protectionism. Th e way for yellow journalism to blame protectionism for the depression was opene d and has never closed. Thanks to the scurrilous lies that appeared in the press, farmers were led to believe that their problems were caused by trade ba rriers stopping the flow of \"free trade.\" Agents of the City of London and Wall Street, aided by the already then kept press, began pounding the pavement of public opinio n, and in response to pres- sure from an ill-informed public, in 1872, a breach in the United States tariff bar- rier was opened. Custom duties were reduced by 10 p ercent on a broad range of imported items and by 50 percent, on salt and coal. As any economist knows, and as any properly-taught high school graduate would k now, once this happens, it soon follows that manufacturing activity will begin to decline as investors stop investing in real wealth — industrial plants, agric ultural implements, machine tools.

Then came Wilson and the first massive, major assault carried out by anti-tariff protection troops who not only smashed our redoubts, but put the Philistines right in the middle of our camp. When President Roosevelt came to the White House, t he second major assault against our tariff walls was launched. Wils on had paved the way for Roosevelt, and was greatly successful in opening up a breach that led to the high- way to the hinterland. Although Wilson did a great deal of damage, which was enlarged by Roosevelt, too much of the tariff wall still remained in place for the liking of Fabian Socialists, Ramsey McDonald, Gunna r Myrdal, Miss Jane Addams, Dean Acheson, Chester Bowles, William C. Bu llitt, Stuart Chase, J. Kenneth Galbraith, John Maynard Keynes, Professor H arold Laski, Walter Lippmann, W. Averill Harriman, Senator Jacob Javitt s, Florence Kelley and Trances Perkins. When George Bush was appointed by the CFR to sit in the Oval Office, he tackled his One World — New World Order assignment with energy and enthusi- asm, making the NAFTA agreement one of his first pr iorities. But did Wilson, Roosevelt and Bush have the right to negotiate trea ties covering trade matters on their own without, the advise and consent process o f the Constitution being observed? Obviously not. Let us then examine the Constitution and see what i t has to say on this vital issue: Article VI, Section 2 \"...This Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all t reaties made, or shall be made, under the authority of the United States shall be t he supreme law of the land...\" The words, \"This Constitution and the laws of the U nited States\", says that a treaty is only a law. Law of the Land\" relates to t he Magna Carta, \"and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or the laws of any State to the contrary no withstanding.\" The word \"supreme\" in part 2 is NOT \"supreme\" but o rdinary law. To grasp this fully, one has to know the United States Const itution and the historical back- ground that goes with it, which can be found only i n the Annals of Congress, the Congressional Globes and the Congressional Records. A full and proper studies of these documents is a prerequisite for understand ing what a treaty is. Unfortunately, our legislators never bother to educ ate themselves through a study of these marvelous journals. Law professors know st ill less about these mines of information, and therefore, frequently teach consti tutional law that is very wide of the mark. It is a case of the blind leading the blind. \"Supreme\" was inserted to ensure that French, Briti sh and Spanish govern- ments could not backtrack on agreements made over t erritories ceded to the United States. It was a sufficient way to prevent f uture governments of these countries on reneging on agreements, but, unfortuna tely, also caused many Americans to understand that a treaty is \"supreme\" law. It is impossible for a"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"172 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship treaty to be \"supreme\" when it is only in pursuance thereof. \"Can the offspring be greater than the parent? The United States Constitu tion is always SUPREME at all times and in all circumstances. Laws can never be \" supreme\" as they are alterable and may have been wrongly passed. The child cannot be greater than the parent. In spite of what Justice Ruth Ginsberg said about t he constitution being flex- ible, the United States Constitution is not flexibl e, it is IMMUTABLE. We know that the First rule of any treaty is self preservat ion. We also know now, that in the United States ALL TREATIES WITHOUT EXCEPTION ARE OR DINARY LAWS AND CAN BE REPEALED AT ANYTIME. A treaty, any treaty, that seri- ously harms the United States violates the rule of self preservation and can be revoked, even if only by cutting off money to fund it. That is why treaties like the U.N., NAFTA, GATT, ABM, Panama Canal Treaty, are NU LL AND VOID, and ought to be revoked by Congress; indeed, would be r evoked, if Congress was not dominated by Socialists. Readers are urged to get a copy of \"Law of Nations\" by Vattel, the \"Bible\" used by our Founding Fathers and they will quickly become convinced that a treaty is only a law that can be changed by Congres s. In fact a treaty might be described as a \"precarious law\" because, in essence , it is without substance. Thomas Jefferson said \"to hold the treaty-making po wer boundless, is to make the Constitution blank paper by construction.\" Congress ional Record, House, Feb. 26, 1900. In addition, the Constitution of the United States expressly forbids the trans- fer of powers from one branch of government to anot her. This happened all through the Free Trade Wars and is still going on. The slow, often unnoticed sur- render of the legislative to the executive branch o f government is what has sapped the strength of the defenders in the Trade Wars. Su ch actions are unconstitution- al and tantamount to sedition and treason against t he American people. The surrender of powers that belong exclusively to the legislative branch of government began with the Payne Aldrich Tariff Act, and the misshapen creature began to grow like the green bay tree. Although the Payne Aldrich Act did not achieve its first goal, it was more than successful in its second; the transfer of leg- islative powers to the executive. It gave powers to the President, forbidden to him by the constitution in that he could now control Cu stoms duty rates on imports. The House delivered a mortal blow to the very peopl e it was supposed to protect, and allowed \"free trade\" to rob our workers of thei r jobs, as manufacturing facil- ities unable to meet the cut-price, dumping policie s of foreign made goods, were forced to close down. That treason and sedition was committed by those wh o accepted the Payne Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909 as \"law,\" is today appar ent in the NAFTA and GATT agreements.

Section 10 strength-"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Planned Destruction of the United States Through Fr ee Trade 173 ened control by the House over trade matters. The p owers of the House were not and are not transferable! It is as simple as that. Any and all \"laws,\" \"executive orders,\" presidential decisions on matters of trade , international agreements, are null and void and must be wiped off the books as so on as government is returned to We, the People. We shall see the huge damage wro ught by presidential usurpa- tion of trade powers as we continue. The Payne Aldrich Tariff Act is typical of the way in which Fabian Socialism acts, always disguising its true intentions behind a facade of lies and more lies. As I have said before, the American people are the mos t lied to people in the world, and the Payne Aldrich Tariff Act was the high point of lies at the time. Put for- ward in the House as a tariff protection measure, t he real meaning of the act was the exact opposite: it was one giant step forward f or the enemies of the American people, the \"free traders\" and their City of London allies — or is masters a better description of their association? The Payne Aldrich Tariff Act ostensibly transferred powers to the executive, a transfer that could not and should not have taken place without a constitutional amendment having been passed. Since this did not ha ppen, every trade agreement since 1909 is ultra-vires. If we had a Supreme Cour t that was not in the hands of the Philistines, we might have been able to turn to it for help, but cannot. Since the days of Brandeis and \"Fixer\" Fortas, the Supreme Court has become a Socialist-packed court which has no ears t o hear the pleas of We, the People. With passage of the Payne Aldrich Tariff Ac t, the United States suffered a grave reverse in the Trade Wars, one from which i t has never recovered. The Payne Aldrich measure was Socialist \"gradualism\" in the best traditions of that dishonest political entity. These sneak attacks on the people of the United Sta tes came at a time of our relative innocence. We knew little about Fabian Soc ialism or of its modus operan- di. The book, \"The Case Against Socialism: A Handbo ok for Conservative Speakers\" is a guide to the dirty tricks Socialism uses to get its legislation passed and there is no greater dirty tricks Socialist play er than President Clinton. The people of this great United States have been ba mboozled by their lead- ers — beginning with Woodrow Wilson — into believin g that such a thing as \"tree trade\" is beneficial for all nations. They wi ll tell us that it was the brain- child of Adam Smith and that David Ricardo, the Soc ialist's favorite economist, refined the bounds and meaning of free trade. But i t all just so much smoke and mirrors. The mythology of \"free trade\" is so ingrai ned in the minds of the American people that they believe it really is bene ficial!

Just a few statistics: Seven hundred and fifty thousand American steelwork ers have lost their jobs since the Committee of 300 unleashed Count Etienne Davignon on this particular battlefront in 1950. A million and a quarter of the best paying, stable, industrial jobs related to and relying upon steel products, were lost in conse quence of the death of the steel industry. This was not because American steel worke rs were not good workers; in fact, given the old plants some had to work with, t hey did very well against unfair trade practices. But they could not compete with \"f ree trade\" imports that under- sold U.S.-made products because foreign governments heavily subsidized them. Many of the foreign steel mills were even built wit h \"Marshall Plan\" money! By 1994, a total of forty million Americans had lost t heir jobs due to \"free trade\" attacks on their factories, textile mills, producti on plants. America grew to be an industrial giant and in the 1 880s was leading England as the world's No. 1 industrial nation. This was en tirely due to the protection pro- vided local industry by trade barriers. When the Ci vil War broke out, and up to close of the nineteenth century, there were 140,000 factories producing heavy industrial goods with a work force of 1.5 million A mericans, probably the best paid by far in the world at any period in Western h istory. By the 1950s, industry and agriculture had created the finest living standard for America's vast, stable, well-paid middle class, the largest of its kind to be found anywhere in the world. It had also created a vast market for its goods, an internal market that its well paid middle class in jobs with guaranteed lifelong job security supported and helped to enlarge and expand . AMERICA'S PROS PER1- TY AND JOB SECURITY DID NOT COME FROM GLOBAL TRADE. The United States did not need world markets to prosper and grow. This was a false bill of goods sold to the American people, first, b y Wilson, and then eagerly, by Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Bush and C linton. Thanks to the treason and sedition committed by the se presidents and Congress, imports have steadily risen, until now, i n 1994, we can barely keep our heads above the rising flood waters of cheap-labor imported goods. In the com- ing year (1995), we shall see casualties skyrocket as the assault by the \"free traders\" decimates the livelihood of millions more Americans. There is no end in sight, yet, our lawmakers continue to retreat, leav ing millions upon millions of wrecked lives behind them.

We shall begin with so called \"trade agreements.\" The con- stitution forbids the transfer of power from one br anch of government to another branch. It is called the doctrine of separation of powers and is sacrosanct and immutable, or that is the way it was written by the Founding Fathers. It is illegal, even treasonous to transfer powers, yet we are supp osed to believe it was legal for Bush to consult with Mexico and Canada and get the NAFTA agreement up and running. We are supposed to believe that, likewise, Clinton had every right to meddle in NAFTA and now, GATT. Wrong on both counts ! Neither Bush nor Clinton had the right to interfere in matters of tr ade that properly belong to the House. On this count alone, NAFTA and GATT are illegal, an d if we had a Supreme Court that was not making its own predilections ins tead of upholding the Constitution, it would be so declared. One of the m ost common tactics used by the \"free trade\" generals in attacking the United S tates is to blame \"trade barri- ers\" for economic hard times. This is palpably untr ue. In looking back over news- paper reports in the \"New York Times,\" the \"Washing ton Post\" and others, I found that they never, ever, gave the true picture of what a grave injury \"free trade\" was doing to this Nation. The incendiary Lib erals never let on that the United States was being systematically bled dry fro m the time that Wilson mount- ed the first assault on our trade defenses. The much heralded \"Marshall Plan\" which is supposed to have saved Europe from ruination was in fact a \"free trade\" scam. The British people, tired of war crim- inal Winston Churchill, voted Labor Party leader Cl ement Attlee, Churchill's deputy Prime Minister and a Fabian Socialist elitis t to succeed him. It was Attlee who succeeded Ramsey McDonald, sent \"to spy out the land\" for Socialism in the United States in the late 1890s. Attlee ranked in t he Fabian lists of stars alongside Professor Harold Laski and Hugh Gaitskell, the latt er a favorite of the Rockefellers, who chose Gaitskell to go to Austria in 1934 to see what Hitler was up to. When Chamberlain was ousted because he refused to g o along with the Committee's war plans, Attlee was waiting in the wi ngs, and his turn came when he was called upon to replace Churchill. At that ti me, Britain had not yet repaid as WWI loans to the United States, as it had agreed to do in the Lausanne con- ference.

Of course the British treasury could not meet the huge new financial obli gations thrust upon it by the Fabianists, without severely increasing taxes, so A ttlee and fellow Socialist John Maynard Keynes, turned to the United States for hel p. The first artillery barrage on United States taxpayers came in the form of a $3 .75 billion loan, which Roosevelt quickly and happily granted. The $3.75 billion American loan money was used to p ay debts incurred by the Socialist government in their mad pursuit of un limited Socialist spending and Socialist transfer programs. They had yet to come t o grips with reality, and when Labor still didn't have enough cash in hand to meet its obligations, the Fabian Brain Trusters got together and dreamed up the Mars hall Plan. Fittingly, the Marshall Plan was unveiled at Harvar d University — that hotbed of Socialism in the United States — by Socia list General George Marshall. Cost to the United States taxpayers? A staggering $ 17 billion over the next five years, which went largely to European countries to fund their State-subsidized industries, so that they could dump their cheaper f oreign made goods on the American market, resulting in the loss of millions of good paying, long term industrial jobs. This had been anticipated by the Fabian Socialist p lanners, who needed Woodrow Wilson to break open the gates of America's trade barriers, so that for- eign-made goods could flood the United States marke t in the immediate post WWII years, which helped France, Poland, Hungary, a nd the United Kingdom stabilize their national incomes at the cost of the American worker! Is it possible that a government such as ours would do such a terrible thing to its own people? Not only is it possible, in real ity, our government turned on its people, sending millions of them to stand in breadl ines, without jobs and without hope. Our workforce was turned into a line of begga rs, desperately trying to understand what had happened to their jobs, and how it had come to pass that instead of working at their old jobs, they were now standing in breadlines or beg- ging for non-existent jobs at some or other employm ent office.

Long, one of the most brilliant men ever to grace the Senate benches, was fiercely opposed by the \"free traders.\" President Gerald R. Ford tried to staunch the sever e wounds suffered by industry as imported goods of all kinds began to fl ood the markets of the nation. For this, he was portrayed by the jackals of the pr ess as a bumbler, a stumbler who could not control his own balance, let alone run th e nation. The \"free trade\" ene- mies made sure that Ford's stay in the White House was a brief one, especially after Ford signed the Trade Act of 1974, which was the culmination of the efforts of Senator Huey Long to stem the rising flood tide of imported goods. Long, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, pro posed measures that would strengthen existing tariff protection through Section 201. In terms of Long's \"escape clause\" (Section 201) companies that were being hurt by imports no longer had to prove their case. But they still h ad to show that \"substantial injury, or the threat thereof to their business was due to imports. Before Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, the cumbersome, time consuming, costly task of proving their case caused many a factory to close d own rather than go through a procedure heavily weighted in favor of foreign gove rnments. A shame and a scan- dal? Yes, but our lawmakers were responsible for th is unbelievable state of affairs, not some foreign government or collection of govern ments. The heinous fact is that ever since the Wilson pres idency, foreign govern- ments have had more standing before U.S. law than o ur own factory owners and their labor force in matters of trade laws. In anti cipation of the move toward \"global trade\" the United States government even ch anged the name of the watchdog agency on trade matters from the Tariff Co mmission, to the United States INTERNATIONAL Trade Commission (ITC) Nobody protested this small step toward selling what remained of our industries down the Global Trade River. Because President Ford signed the Trade Act of 1974 , he was vilified as being \"anti-free trade\" and his stay in office shortened. In practice, Clause 201 did not provide the promise d relief. By the time the full Senate, packed with Socialists masquerading as \"liberal Democrats\" had fin- ished chewing over the bill, the already unlevel pl aying field now had a steep uphill gradient against local manufacturers. Notwit hstanding Long's specific wording to the contrary, it came out in practice th at an industry could only file a case AFTER suffering injury for some time, and even then, there was no guaran- tee of success, as the ITC might not rule against o ffending imports. Worse yet,"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"178 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship even if the ITC did rule in favor of local industry , the president could still veto the measure. While all this was going on, hundreds of American c ompanies were forced to close due to unfair competition from foreign goo ds. It is difficult to believe that any President of th is country would put foreign interests above those of his own people, but this i s what happened, time after time, and it is still happening today with the Clinton So cialists in power. The United States Constitution, Section 3 of Article 11 says: \"He, (the President) shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed...\" None of the Presidents from Wilson to Clinton has taken care to execute the laws prote cting our trade, and for that they ought to have been impeached. After Ford was hit with the charges that he was \"an ti-free trade,\" he backed down in his proposed defense of the shoe industry, which had shown a clear hard- ship case against imported footwear. During the Joh nson, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush administrations, hundreds of appeals in terms of the Trade Act of 1974 were turned aside, including representations made by the automobile, footwear, gar ment, computer and television manufacturers, and st eel. Clinton is proving to be an even worse enemy of his own people than Wilson a nd Roosevelt. The Congress and Presidents shot their troops in the ba ck. A particular case history that is worth recounting concerns the footwear industry, and there are literally scores of similar cases in other industries. At the time that Lincoln came to the White House, shoes an d boots were made in small cottage-type, family enterprises scattered around t he country. This changed with the advent of the Civil War, but still, thousands o f small producers who could not handle Army contracts stayed in business and did ve ry well. There was patently no need to import footwear. The \"free traders\" fixed their sights on the footwe ar industry, which in small- er towns was often the sole employer. Through Congr ess, the trade barriers against imported footwear began to come under attac k. Local manufacturers were accused of causing \"inflation\" through higher price s. This was completely false. The shoe industry was turning out a good product at a very competitive price. But by the time Lyndon Johnson arrived at the White Hou se, the \"free traders\" had secured 20 percent of the local market. Then, an al armed Footwear Industries of America filed a case with the ITC asking for immedi ate relief, but, as mentioned earlier. Ford gave them no relief. When Carter arrived on the scene, he too was as pet itioned by the Footwear Industries of America. What is wrong here of course is that the President should have had ANY say in trade matters that rightly belo ng with the Congress. But, having already violated the Constitution in a hundr ed ways, there was no stopping Carter. Instead of coming to the aid of his own peo ple, Carter made an agreement with Taiwan and Korea that was supposed to limit th eir footwear exports to the"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Planned Destruction of the United States Through Fr ee Trade 179 United States, but which in practice, did not ameli orate the situation. The footwear market for imports shot up to 50 percent o f the United States market. Carter was deaf, blind and dumb when it came to pro tecting the livelihood of hun- dreds of thousands of Americans. Yet this is the sa me Carter who addressed the nation on television on July 15, 1979: 'The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. I t is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and s oul and spirit of our national will. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about t he meaning of our own lives and in the loss of unity of purpose for our nation. \" Indeed, and by encouraging \"free trade\" Carter was responsible for the crisis. There never was a more hypocritical message to come out of the Oval Office. In the Korean War, General Douglas MacArthur was be trayed by Dean Acheson and Harry Truman. In the Free Trade War, the Footwe ar Battle was lost because we were betrayed by Jimmy Carter and Robert Strauss . Next came \"conservative\" President Ronald Reagan, w ho did nothing to pre- vent the flooding of the market by huge amounts of footwear imports from Korea and Taiwan, neither of which countries has never ev er imported one single pair of shoes made in the United States! So much for \"free trade.\" As a result of Reagan's studied negligence, shoe imports now hit a new high in 1982, totaling 60 percent of our market. As a matter of grave national import ance, it also pushed up the trade deficit by a whopping $2.5 billion and threw more that 120,000 workers in the footwear trade out of a job. Support industries shed 80,000 jobs, a grand total of 200,000 workers tossed on the scrap heap. As is usual with Socialist propaganda, those who dr ew attention to the des- perate plight of the footwear industry were constan tly vilified. \"They want to increase inflation — why doesn't the local footwear industry get competitive\" the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post chorused. This is of course the function of the jackals of the press: Pr otect the Socialist decision- maker in government and smear as \"fascists\" or wors e, anyone who draws atten- tion to the war. The truth is that the American footwear industry wa s very competitive and was turning out good quality products. What the ind ustry could not compete with was the poorer-quality, HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED products coming from Taiwan and Korea, whose governments were putting billions of dollars in subsidies into their footwear industry. This is what is called \"fr ee trade.\" The only thing that is \"free\" about it is that foreign manufacturers are a llowed to dump their subsidized products on the U. S. market free of charge, but ou r manufacturers are closed out of foreign markets by laws and restrictions — in th is case there was not a single hope that American footwear manufacturers could sel l in Taiwan and Korea. To this day, no American-made footwear is sold in Taiw an or Korea. This is what is called \"free trade.\""},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"180 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship In spite of five appeals filed within ITC which fou nd that the American footwear industry was suffering irreparable harm fr om a flood of imports from Korea and Taiwan, Reagan refused to do anything to stem the tide that was now drowning worker and employer alike. The footwear in dustry found itself out in the cold. It could not turn to Congress, because Congre ss had transferred its sovereign- ty to the executive branch, and Reagan in the grip of his Socialist advisors, turned his back on his troops and let the \"free trade\" ene my troops overwhelm them. The battle of the footwear industry was just anothe r battle lost by our people in the ongoing Trade War, and it will not be long b efore we are plowed under by GATT and NAFTA. The Trojan Horse of \"free trade\" in the Congress will have carried the day for the enemy forces. Our battered troops have no recourse but to retire, leaving millions of wrecked lives behind th em. And all of this devastation is wrought in the name of \"global trade.\" It is well worth calling attention to the similarit y of methods used to get the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, and NAFTA onto the boo ks in 1993. Apart from presidential interference in the legislative depart ment, a huge public relations campaign was mounted with the aid of the best and b rightest that Madison Avenue could come up with. A press barrage was back ed by Howard Peterson of the White House, and the Senate, and the Commerce D epartment. The pattern was repeated with NAFTA in 1993. NAFTA is on par with t he treasonous Monetary Control Act of 1980, signed by Carter. NAFTA is an illegal \"agreement\" which cannot pass a constitutional test. Pages 2273-2297, Congressional Record, House, Feb 2 6,1900 gives the constitu- tional position regarding \"deals\" like NAFTA, the P anama Canal, GATT etc: \"The Congress of the United States derives its powe r to legislate from the Constitution, which is the measure of its authority . Any enactment of Congress which is opposed to its provisions, or is not withi n the grant of powers made by it, is unconstitutional, therefore no law, and obli gatory upon no one...\" Judge Cooley, the great constitutional scholar said , \"The constitution itself never yields to a treaty or enactment. It neither c hanges with time nor does it bend to the force of circumstances.\" The Congress has no constitutional authority to transfer its treaty — making powers to the Presiden t, as was done with NAFTA. This is pure sedition. Trade negotiations belong wi th the House: Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3, \"to regulate commerce with foreign nat ions, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes.\" Clearly, neith er Bush nor Clinton had a con- stitutional right to meddle in NAFTA. It is certain ly treason and sedition.

On page 1151 of the above noted Congressional Recor d, we read: \"In 1991 American workers earned an average weekly wage twen ty percent below 1972 wage levels. Meanwhile, the textile and apparel ind ustries lost over 600,000 jobs, while steel and automobiles sacrificed another 580, 000 positions. Measured in declining income and jobs, the burden of global lea dership thus has fallen heavi- ly on low-skilled American workers. Labor intensive manufacturing jobs have moved abroad to low-cost Third World countries, lea ving a caste of poorly skilled American workers...\" The Socialist goal to reduce the standard of living of middle class America to that of a Third World Country is somewhere in th e region of 87 percent com- plete, and if matters go as planned, the Clinton ad ministration will soon put the finishing touches to the Trade War at the cost of s tabbing the American people in the back. As I have often said, President Clinton w as selected to carry out a Fabian Socialist mandate, and \"free trade\" is only one of treasonous policies he was ordered to carry out. \"All of us have felt how much we need the United Na tions if we are really move toward a New World and kinds of relationships in the world in the interests of all countries. The Soviet Union and the United S tates have more than enough reason to be partners in building it, in shaping ne w security structures in Europe and the Asian Pacific region. And also in the makin g of a truly global economy, indeed, the creation of a new civilization.\" — Mikh ail Gorbachev, Stanford University speech, 1990. Substitute \"Socialists\" fo r the Soviet Union and it is easy to see that nothing has changed. The long-range plan of Socialism to break the Const itution of the United States through membership of foreign entities is fairly we ll recorded, nowhere more so than in the writings of Fabian Socialists and inter national socialists. We know that the Socialists expects to usher in a world dictator ship through the actions of Communism and Socialism, the one by open and direct methods, and the other by more subtle, hidden means. They expect to triumph t hrough the financial dictator- ship of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), whic h can control governments by forcing free countries through sabotage of their mo netary structures, to join interna- tional bodies such as the short-lived League of Nat ions, its successor, the United Nations and a host of peripheral international orga nizations. All have a common aim: Destroy the sovereignty of t he intended nation — victim by suspension of credit, want of employment, stagnation of industry and agriculture and by super-imposing the laws of an in ternational body over the laws of individual nations. In this book we shall be abl e to deal with only the United Nations as an example of Socialist surpation of the life's blood of independent nation states."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"182 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship It is not within the scope of this book to examine how the United Nations charter was set up, other than that it is a Sociali st enterprise from the first to the last. Some think of it a Communist enterprise. Whil e it is true that the writers of the United Nations draft were two Soviet citizens, Leo Rosvolsky, Molotov and one American Socialist citizen, Alger Hiss, the cha rter is a Socialist one, a great victory for the Fabian Society and its American cou sins. The United Nations char- ter fits right in with the Communist Manifesto of 1 848. Had the United Nations treaty/agreement/charter bee n cast as Communist document, it would not have been accepted by the Un ited States Senate. But the Socialists know their game, and so it was cast as a n organization to \"keep the peace.\" Now I have said elsewhere that when we see the word \"peace,\" in any world government document, we must recognize it as Socialist or Communist in origin. That is precisely the nature of the United Nations charter. It is a Communist/Socialist organization. Moreover, the Uni ted Nations makes war, it does not keep the peace. Notwithstanding that the charter was signed by a ma jority of United States Senators and passed into law, the United States is not a member of this One World Government — New World Order body, and has not for a single minute been a member. There are a number of paramount reasons why this is so: Vattel's \"Law of Nations,\" the \"Bible\" which provided the sum and substance upon which our Founding Father's international law was based, appl ies in this case and still stands. This goes back to Roman and Greek law and i n itself, is a lifetime study. How many of our so-called Senators and Representati ves know anything at all about such matters? Vattel's invaluable book is not part of the curriculum of law schools and is not included in high school and or u niversity text books. The State Department is singularly unversed in this invaluabl e book, which is why it makes one mess after another in trying to arrange the aff airs of this nation without hav- ing the faintest knowledge of Vattel's Law of Natio ns. The United States Constitution stands supreme over all treaties, char ters and agreement of whatev- er stripe and cannot be supplanted by congressional and or executive action. For the United States to have been a member of the United Nations there would have had to be an Amendment to the United Sta tes Constitution passed by all 50 States. Since this did not occur, we are not a member of the U.N., nor have we ever been. Such an amendment would have taken aw ay the power of the House and Senate to declare war and given it to an international body. Because former President Bush attempted to do this at the t ime of the Gulf War, he should have been impeached for treason against the United States and for failing to abide by his oath of office.

There can be no nationality without sovereignty and there can be no sovereignty without nationality. As to ev ery matter in the United States as a nation possessed sovereign power, except only where sovereignty has been reserved to the States and or to the people.\" Also, from Pomeroy, (on the Constitution) page 27: \"There can be no nation without political sovereignty and no political sove reignty without a nation. I shall, not be able therefore to separate these ideas and t o present each as a distinct from the other...\" Continuing on page 29: \"This nation p ossesses political sovereignty. It may have any organization from the purest democr acy to the most absolute monarchy, but considered to its relation with the r est of mankind and its own indi- vidual members, it must exist, to the extent of ena cting laws for itself as an inte- gral, independent sovereign society among other sim ilar nations of the earth.\" Dr. Mulford, one of the finest historians and const itutional scholars said in his book about sovereignty of a nation, on page 112 : \"The existence of sovereignty of a nation or politi cal sovereignty, is indicated by certain signs or notes which are universal. Thes e are independence, authority, supremacy, unity and majesty. The sovereignty of a nation or political sovereignty, implies independence. It is subject to no external control, but its action is in corre- spondence within its own determination. It implies authority. It has the strength inherent in its own determination to assert and mai ntain it. It implies supremacy. This does not presume the presence of other powers which are inferior...\" As the late Senator Sam Ervin, one of the great Con stitutional scholars of this century said many times, \"there is no way under the noonday sun that we could have joined the United Nations.\" Examine the requir ements for sovereignty out- lined above and it becomes clear that the United Na tions is not a nation and that it is entirely lacking in sovereignty. It does not make individual laws for the nation, because it is not a nation. It has no terri tory of its own, it has no unity and majesty. It is subject to external control. Moreover the United Nations treaty cannot stand bec ause the United Nations lacks sovereignty. According to \"Law of Nations\" by Vattel, the \"Bible\" our Founding Fathers used to frame the Constitution, th e United States is forbidden to enter into a treaty with ANY BODY, ANY ENTITY wh ich lacks sovereignty. No one will contest that the United Nations lacks s overeignty so that the United Nations \"treaty\" passed by the Senate in 1945 is nu ll and void, ultra vires.

A study of Vatte l's Law of Nations and Wheaton's International Law in conjunction with the Constitution will leave no doubt about the accuracy of this. Any Congressman, Senator, or government agent, who supports the United Nations is guilty of sedition.

Enforcing \"international law\" is the very basic bedrock of the United Nations but it cannot be enforced in the United States. Our contention that the United States is not a memb er of the United Nations is reinforced by a reading of Congressional Record, Senate, February 14, 1879 and pages 1151-1159, Congressional Record, Senate J anuary 26, 1897. We will not find this vital material in ANY law books. The far left-of-Marx law professors at Harvard, don't want their students to find out a bout these vital matters. It makes no difference that the United States Senat e \"ratified\" the U.N. \"treaty,\" charter agreement. Congress cannot pass l aws that are unconstitutional, and binding United States law to the subserviency o f the United Nation treaty is patently unconstitutional. Any act by Congress (Hou se and Senate) that makes the Constitution subservient to any other body or entit y, has no force in law and is of no affect. Clearly, based only on Article 25 of the United Nations treaty, the United States could not have entered into such an a greement. The Annals of Congress, Congressional Globes and Co ngressional Records are packed with information on sovereignty and a de tailed examination of the material, much of which came from Vattel's \"Law of Nations\" makes it very clear that the United States was never a member of the Un ited Nations nor can it ever be, unless the vote taken by the Senate in 1945 is subjected to a Constitutional amendment and then ratified by the 50 States.

Socialists-bankers came h ere from Europe and England to deceitfully ruin the people of this coun try through penetration and per- meation of every facet of our monetary system. Thes e Socialist change agents could not have accomplished anything without the fu ll cooperation of traitors within our gates, and they found them in their hund reds, men and women who were willing to sell the American people out. A not able traitor was President. Woodrow Wilson, who punched holes through the trade barriers erected by President. Washington and kept intact by Lincoln, M cKinley and Garfield. In 1913, Wilson introduced the Marxist graduated incom e tax system to replace the revenues lost from Customs duties and opened the ga tes to allow the Philistine bankers from Europe to enter our citadel through pa ssage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Few people realize the American banking system was SOCIALIZED with passage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. The com mercial banks (we have no merchant banks in the true British sense) have been \"on the dole\" i.e., welfare, since the Socialist banker-thieves were able to get control in that year. What we have in this country is welfare banking, almost ide ntical to the banking system the Bolsheviks instituted in Russia. The Federal Reserv e banks create debt obligation, so-called \"money\" which money does not accrue to th e Fed through trading, but rather through theft from the people. The soft mone y is stolen directly from the people. The money that the Federal Reserve banks co ntrol, is not honest money; rather it is fiat money, always inflationary. Whom can we hold accountable? Whom can we charge wi th the theft of our money? No one knows who the stockholders of the lar gest banking system in the world are. Is this truly believable?

Nowhere did we gi ve Congress the right to transfer this power over to a private banking insti tution. Yet, that is exactly what the Congress did in 1913.

No one could have read it, less still understood it in the few days i t was on the floor for discussion. Thus the Federal Reserve Act was ramrodded through the Congress and became an act of arbitrary power — which is what it is cal led when a bill is not properly debated and passes into law without being fully deb ated.

Probably it is through fear. Those who have sought to challenge this monstrous Socialist creation in a meaningful way, have been bru- tally murdered. Members of the House and Senate kno w that the Federal Reserve is THE heist of the 20th century, yet do nothing to ro ck the boat for fear of being thrown out of Congress, or even worse.

The Rothschilds and their fellow Socialist s of the international bank of Shylocks, have put the American people in debt for ever — unless we can find the right leader who will break this chokehold. The Shylock international bankers, long before the advent of the Federal Reserve Board, looked upon the wealth of this natio n with great avarice and were determined to put on pressure until they controlled it. The International Shylock bankers prevented the national bank, during Preside nt Andrew Jackson's term, from paying off the Civil War debt, in order to kee p the American people tied hand and foot, which we still are. It is well-estab lished that British intelligence fomented and prosecuted the American Civil War, whi ch should have been called International Shylock Banker's War. British intelli gence had their agents in place in the Southern States, penetrating and permeating every aspect of life. When President Jackson shut down the central bank, British intelligence was ready. The Bank Act of 1862 was a Rothschild \"scoop \" part of the long-range plan to keep the American people in everlasting penury. Alt hough Congress and a patriotic Supreme Court fended off the Rothschild swindlers, the reprieve was short-lived. Thanks to Trojan Horse Wilson, they got the upper h and in 1913 and plunged this nation into financial slavery, which is the st ate in which we find ourselves today. As we said in our chapters on education, the Socialists used education to lie to the American public about the Federal Reserv e banks, which is one of the reason why it is still tolerated. Its gross excesse s and crimes against the American people are not known, although they are spelled out in the hundreds of excellent books on the subject. But such books are above the ken of those who have less than an a certain standard of education, governed by Socialist contro l of the school text book industry, which is why so many millions of American s of all ages find solace in television. Now, if Larry King would hold open, fra nk discourses opening up information about the evils of the Socialist Federa l Reserve, and if the most pop- ular talk show hosts of radio and television would do likewise, we might just get our people excited enough to do something about clo sing down the Federal Reserve system. The American public would learn that the first duty of the Congress is to pro- vide and keep a sound monetary system for the Unite d States. The public would learn that we do not have one single honest dollar in circulation. They would learn that the British East India Company and the Bank of England conspired with Adam Smith to pull all gold and silver out of the C olonies, to defeat the Colonists in an economic war that preceded the shooting war.

The American people might learn on the Larry King Show, or from the Phil Donahue Show, that the Federal Reserve banks pay no income tax; that have they have never been audit ed and pay only $1.95 for every $1000 they receive from the Treasury of We, t he People. \"What a bargain,\" we might howl in rage. An aroused, enraged populace might even shock the C ongress into action and force the closure of this Beast of Mammon. The American people would learn that the greatest period of prosperity was the peri od between the closing of the Shylock central bank by Andrew Jackson and the outb reak of the Civil War. They would learn that the Federal Reserve banks have Soc ialized commercial banking in this country and that our banks are working on t he basis of the system described in the \"Merchant of Venice,\" by Shakespea re. President Roosevelt told the American people that h e was a friend of the poor and the middle class of America, but he was an agen t of the Shylock International Banks and Fabian Socialism, from day one. He arrang ed huge loans to prop up the Socialist government in England, bankrupted by that country's failed Socialist policies, while his own people stood in bread lines , and in 1929, the same foreign interests manipulated the stock market crash that t ook billions of dollars off stock prices, which the predators were then able to buy u p at 10 cents on the dollar. The Federal Reserve banks engineered the crash through the New York Federal Reserve bank. On pages 10949-1050 of the Congressio nal Record, House, June 16, 1930, we find the following: \"More recently the Federal Reserve Board has made A merican industry the victim of a single series of manipulations in the i nterest of European credit which caused the stockmarket to crash and present industr ial depression. Those manip- ulations began in Feb. 1929 with the visit to this country of the governor of the bank of England and his consultations with the Fede ral Reserve Board head, the subject of these conferences being anxiety as to th e financial situation in Great Britain (reeling from Socialist programs that had b ankrupted the country) and the fall of the pound sterling. \"The British and French had invested $3 billion in the American stock mar- ket, and the purpose was to stop the drain of gold to the United States by break- ing American security values. Their first effort in March, 1929, caused by public proclamations of the Federal Reserve (from its New York branch) calculated to scare investors caused a minor panic in March.

Nowhere in the Constitution is there found a power that authorizes the United States Government to fund so-called internat ional banks like the World Bank and the IMF. To find this power one has to loo k in Article 1, Section 8, Clauses 1-18, but it would be futile to search for it because it is not there. We have no constitutional power authorizing the funding of foreign banks, hence such action is unlawful. Spurred on by the Socialist in England, President G eorge Bush pushed hard to pass the One World Government — New World Order trade bills of NAFTA and GATT which would rob the United States of its s overeignty and depredate industrial and agricultural jobs, throwing millions of Americans out of work. \"Global trade\" is an old aim of Fabian Socialism wh ich it has striven to achieve since 1910, in its effort to break up the favorable trade position of the United States and reduce the standard of living of the Ame rican blue collar and white col- lar middle class, to that of Third World countries. However, Bush ran out of time and so the baton in t he relay race was passed to President Clinton, who succeeded in having the N AFTA \"treaty\" passed with the aid of 132 \"progressive (Socialist) members of the Republican Party. In 1993, the Fabian Socialist's dream of \"global trade\" took a giant step forward with the passage of NAFTA and the signing of the General Agr eement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) measure that ended America's unique position of being able to provide a good standard of living and jobs for its unique mid dle class. It would take an Amendment to the Constitution of t he United States to make the NAFTA and GATT treaties lawful. First, there in is no provision or power in the Constitution that allowed Presidents Bush and C linton acted in a 100 percent unconstitutional manner by getting involved in the details of these treaties, which are solely in the domain of the legislative branch.

We know abo ut the $7 billion dollar loan engineered by John Maynard Keynes to bail out the f ailed Socializing of the British people via the Labor Party. We also know ab out the Socialist scheme to fund other foreign countries via the so-called fore ign aid appropriations bill, an event that costs the American people close to $20 b illion annually, where we play Santa Claus to some of the most undeserving nations in the world, whose failed Socialist policies we continue to prop up. The Hous e and Senate fail lamentably to even make a pretense of screening bills for thei r constitutionality before they allow them to come to the floor. If they did their job properly, foreign aid bills would never reach the floor of the House and Senate . This is a crime against the American people, best described as sedition. Foreign aid serves two purposes; it destabilizes Am erica and helps the Committee of 300 take control of the natural resour ces of countries funded by coercion of the American taxpayers. Of course there are countries that have no natural resources, such as Israel and Egypt, but in these cases, foreign aid become a geopolitical consideration, but still remains, in voluntary servitude or slavery. Foreign aid began in earnest with President Rooseve lt when he gave away an esti- mated $11 billion to Bolshevik Russia and $7 billio n to the British Labor Party Government. Is their any grant in power in the Constitution of the United States that would make provision for this astonishing annual giveaway ? The answer is, \"NO\" and it would require an amendme nt to the Constitution to make foreign aid legal, but it is doubtful wheth er such an amendment could be properly drafted, as foreign aid violates the claus e forbidding slavery (involuntary servitude). To put it bluntly, foreign aid is treas on and sedition.

THE MIDDLE CLASS Of all the people most hated by the Marxist/Fabian Socialist/Communists and their American cousins, none outranks the uniqu e American middle class, which has long been the bane of the existence of So cialism.

What we want to do in this chapter is to look at where the middle class stands in mid- 1994. The middle class is the greatest social triumph of the 20th century for our Confederated Republic, which was properly and well run, up to 1913. Born out of sound monetary policies, trade barriers and prot ectionism, the middle class was the rampart against all of the hopes of Karl Marx t o bring revolution to America were dashed to pieces. The expanding middle class w hich began in earnest between the time that Andrew Jackson outlawed the c entral bank, and the Civil War, continued during both world wars. But since 19 46, something has gone wrong. Elsewhere we have explained the war waged ag ainst the American mid- dle class since 1946 by the Tavistock Institute, a war we are losing hands down. The equality of blue-collar workers in good-paying industrial jobs with an assured future was the first target of the Club of Rome's Post Industrial-Zero Growth blueprint for the destruction of our industr ial base. Blue collar workers enjoyed parity income with white collar workers and together, they formed a for- midable middle class, not the \"working class\" of So cialist European countries. This was THE political fact recognized by the Socia lists as a big obstacle to their plans to ruin America. Thus, industry, which suppor ted the middle class, had to be eviscerated, and it was, and still is, being cut up, section by section, with NAFTA and GATT doing the slicing. One thing I have always emphasized is that the Soci alists never give up. Once they set their goals, they will pursue them wi th a tenacity of purpose that is almost frightening. I have traced the decline of th e economic and political power of the middle class to the beginning of the 1970s, following the implementation of the Club of Rome's Post Industrial-Zero Growth p lan. By 1973, the founda- tion-floor upon which the middle class rested, bega n to show signs of serious sinking as job prospects and earnings prospects beg an collapsing. So much so, that by 1993, for the first time ever, job losses a mong white collar workers equaled job losses of blue collar workers. Since th e 1970s, and particularly in 1980, the Census Bureau reported middle class incom es plummeting. What Socialism achieved through the destruction of trade barriers, increased taxation and an ongoing onslaught against the work- place, is the emergence of a new class in America, the working poor. Literally m illions and millions of former blue collar and white collar workers have fallen th rough the yawning cracks in their former solid middle class foundation, jobs ba sed on industrial employment, protection of trade. The middle class found itself making up the more than 60 mil- lion Americans, roughly 23 percent of the populatio n, who can be described with accuracy, as the working poor, those whose incomes are less than enough to cover the cost of the basic necessities of life.(Yet, we can afford to give $20 billion in \"foreign aid\" to strangers)."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"A Nation Undone 195 One of the most destructive shots fired against the middle class in the trade war was the so-called oil shortage generated by the deliberately planned 1973 Arab-Israeli conflict combined with war on nuclear power stations. The Socialists have closed down nuclear energy — the cheapest and safest form of energy and the least polluting, and made our industrial heart beat on oil — better yet, import- ed oil. Had the nuclear power program for this coun try not been utterly savaged by the Socialist-controlled \"environmentalist\" shoc k troops, the country would have by now experienced a zero need to import oil, so detrimental to our econo- my in general and, in particular, to our balance of payments situation. In addition, by shutting down nuclear power stations, the Social ists slashed an estimated one million jobs annually from the payrolls. The rising cost of oil fanned by the Arab-Israeli w ar and loss of nuclear ener- gy, forced productivity lower, which in turn consid erably lowered wages, impact- ing on the economy, as lower wages discouraged spen ding. Starting from 1960, we find that the median family income rose by almos t 3 percent annually right up to the 1973 Arab — Israeli War. No doubt this is wh at Kissinger meant when he said the war had a far wider impact on the American economy than at first thought. From 1974, real wages of blue and white collar work ers fell by a whopping 20 percent. By 1993, the number of workers forced t o take part time jobs who were formerly fully employed in blue collar jobs, a lmost doubled from the year before. Likewise, white collar workers in stable in dustry-related jobs, found themselves becoming \"permanent temporaries\" in ever increasing numbers. The number of temporary former blue collar workers is n ow around 9 percent, with white collar workers in the same category around 10 percent of the total work- force. The foundation upon which the middle class w as built was not only crack- ing and sinking, it was beginning to totally break up. Although government statistics only admit to an ave rage unemployment rate of between 6.4 percent and 7 percent, the real rate is closer to 20 percent. With the downsizing of defense contracts an estimated lo ss of 35 million jobs is the reality of the situation when we take into consider ation the impact of NAFTA and GATT on the job market. North Carolina's textile in dustry is expected to shed two million jobs in the second year of a fully operatio nal GATT. Irving Bluestone of the Institute of Policy Studies says his survey of steady, industry-related jobs, the sole source of wages tha t support a middle class family, found that 900,000 good-paying industrial jobs were lost each year starting in 1978 to 1982, that is, almost 5 million high-qualit y blue collar jobs in five years. There are no other statistics of a similar nature c overing the period 1982 to 1994, but, if we take the same number, 900,000 — and we k now the number is higher — then it is reasonable to suppose that in 12 years the number of such jobs lost, and which will never return, amounted to 10 million well-paying long-term indus-"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"196 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship trial jobs. Now we begin to get the real figures ab out unemployment, and not only that, we get the real picture of the QUALITY jobs l ost forever, thanks to the onslaught of the Club of Rome and the Tavistock Ins titute against the American workplace. President Clinton will pay a price for his trade wa r on the American people, that price will include a single term. Clinton has plumped for a global economy, which inevitably means employment insecurity in Ame rica. Bringing down the last trade barrier by GATT has sent our economy whi rling into the maelstrom of decreased spending as a cause of increased joblessn ess. Clinton is learning the hard way that you can't have your cake and eat it. Global economy + deficit reduction = HUGE JOB LOSSES. There is no chance tha t the country can take another four more years of Clinton's Socialist admi nistration, with a rising tide of temporary, low paid jobs swamping former well-paid, long-term industrial jobs. The middle class is vanishing, but their voice can still be heard, and their message must be, \"to hell with a global economy and to hell with deficit reduc- tion. WE WANT GOOD PAYING, STABLE, LONG TERM EMPLOY MENT!\" Even though the United States is just lately been f orced into a global economy, the devastation is clearly visible with hundreds of solid, stable corporations forced to lay off their trained work force in drove s. What we have today in 1994 — and this has developed since the Arab Israeli War — is a Wall Street/Las Vegas economy. McDonald stock is high, but flipping hamburgers is no substitute for a well-paid long te rm industrial job. So while McDonald stocks do well on Wall Street, can the Uni ted States make do with an economy in which well-paid jobs are becoming an end angered species? An arti- cle in the Los Angeles Times said that in 1989, one in four American jobs were partime, a frightening rise over the 1972 figures, but the ratio in 1993 was one in three, or one third of all jobs in American were te mporary jobs. The bottom line is that no industrial nation can survive the rate o f attrition in well-paying indus- trial jobs and not go whirling out of control into an abyss of destruction. The United States is losing the battle against the forces of Socialism spear- headed by the Tavistock Institute. In the next two years we are going to be faced by a huge increase in competition forced upon us by \"global economy\" where nations with millions of semi-literate people will be taught to turn out goods at slave-labor pay rates. What will the work force in the United States do then? May we remind you that this is the logical result of po licies implemented by Woodrow Wilson, policies that were to destroy the internal market of the United States. Our work force of skilled industrial blue collar worker s will very soon be haunted by the specter of no jobs at all, and we are going to find these workers grabbing at any kind of a job to halt the slide of their standa rd of living, or, indeed, just to keep bread on the table. Clinton ran his campaign on promise to the middle c lass. How many of the"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"A Nation Undone 197 jobless remember his speech, 'The rich get the gold mine and the workers get the shaft\"? That was before he was ordered to meet with Jay Rockefeller and Pamela Harriman who told him very bluntly, \"you are delive ring the wrong message. The DEFICIT is what the message is.\" Thereafter, Clinto n suddenly began to preach the Socialist gospel of cutting the deficit, withou t mentioning that it could only be done at the cost of millions of jobs. Then Clinton did the other thing Socialists are goo d at; he made a promise that government would reshape everything. But the worry has grown; Clinton hasn't been able to convince workers that a lower deficit is better than full employment. A recent poll showed that 45 percent opposed to 26 pe rcent of Americans thought unemployment a more serious problem than the defici t. Clinton also told us that we are enjoying a recovery, but this does not ad up, a s contrary to the normal pattern, when recovery means less people are working at invo luntary part-time lower-paid jobs, this time the percentage has GROWN. In 1993 t here were more than 6.5 mil- lion people working in temporary lower-paid jobs. Of the much vaunted claim that the Clinton administ ration created 2 million jobs last year, we should note that 60 percent of t hese jobs were in restaurants, health care, bars, hotels (bellmen, porters, doorme n). The drive to \"globalize\" (read destroy) the American domestic market begun b y Woodrow Wilson, has gone into high gear with Clinton. The dramatic resu lts from this destructive pro- gram can be measured by the following: ■ In Automobiles, imports rose from 4.1 percent to 68 percent from 1960 to 1986. ■ Clothing imports rose from 1.8 percent in 1960 to 5 0 percent by 1986. ■ Machine tool imports rose from 3.2 percent in 1960 to 50 percent in 1986. ■ Machine tools are THE most important indicator of t he true economy of an industrial nation. ■ Electronic imports rose from 5.6 percent of the mar ket in 1960 to 68 percent of the market in 1986. The Fabian Socialists with their false \"global econ omy\" promises complete- ly undermined the United States as the greatest ind ustrial nation the world has ever seen. The tragedy contained in these figures t ranslates to MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS of good paying, long term, stable jobs, wh ich are now lost FOREV- ER, sacrificed on the alter of Fabian Socialism's d ream of a One World Government — New World Order dictatorship. The Amer ican worker was lied to by Presidents Wilson, Roosevelt, Kennedy, Johnson, Bush and Clinton, who have jointly and severally committed high treason agains t the United States.

The 10th Amendment became their football, to be kicked all over the place.

Commodity prices had bee n artificially lowered by for- eign pressures, and unemployment was widespread. Th e Federal Reserve-created National Debt had ballooned. We were still at war w ith Germany, a ruse to suck more \"reparations\" out of that country. Wilson's ta xes were at an all time high. On assuming office, Harding made a list of what ail ed the United States and then forced the Congress to stay in session for two years to solve the problems.

There are no foreign markets for American goods, and this is how it has always been. The only thing that has changed with a \"global economy\" is that ou r defenses were breached and imported goods came flooding through gaping holes i n the dykes. This is at the root cause of the middle class crisis. Whereas, it was always that American man- ufacturers were able to supply a rising local deman d because of steady blue and white collar jobs, our position became untenable wh en Wilson said that we must not be afraid of \"competition!\" In 1913, the United States had a closed market with full employment, a rising economy and long ran ge prosperity, Customs rev- enues paid the government bills up to 1913, when th e Socialists got Wilson to tear down the dykes protecting our standard of living. In a closed market, our manufacturers could afford to pay good wages: by so doing they created purchasing power and an effectiv e demand for their products, which meant full employment, long term permanent jo b security. All that Socialist (Democrat) Presidents from Wilson to Clinton have o ffered the American worker is a slim chance to sell some goods in China, Japan or England, in return for a low-paid job of sorts, so that by degrees, especial ly with the full force of NAFTA and GATT brought to bear on them, they will find th emselves accepting a con- stant lowering of their standard of living and be t hankful for the opportunity to work at any job, no matter what it might be. This i s called, \"free trade.\" This is the future of the American middle class. The net effect of \"free trade in a global economy\" will be the disappearance of the American middle class, (clerical, blue colla r and white collar) the class that made America great. The top 500 companies shed more than 5 million middle class workers over the past 13 years. Some future l eader may react in alarm when the full extent of the ravaging of the middle class becomes dearer. At that time, the only alternative for the leader of this nation, will be to stem the tide of \"free trade,\" which means a return to tough, trade barrie rs. That will be a humiliating defeat for the Socialists who run the Democrat Part y, but one which they will have to accept if America is not to become like Russia; the possessed and the dispos- sessed. To sum up the tragedy that has come down on America : A global society means a middle classless society in America. \"Free trade\" has already eroded the standard of living of the middle class to where it is no longer comparable with what it was in 1969. The American middle class was not made by \"free trade\" or a \"global economy.\" The middle class was made out o f trade barriers and a secure protected market for locally manufactured goods.

Even when in full control of the British Government, and notwithstanding the billions of \"foreign aid\" dolla rs America poured into the British treasury to shore up Socialist programs, So cialism proved to be a colossal flop. Sweden was one the countries that elected to go the Fabian Way. We have already met the Socialist idealists, Gunnar Myrdal, and his wife, both of whom played a major role in wrecking education in Americ a. For more than 50 years, Stockholm was the pride of Socialists everywhere. M yrdal was a minister in the Swedish cabinet for many years, and played a leadin g part in introducing Socialism to Sweden, its leaders well contented the y had proved that Socialism works. From the 1930s onwards, Sweden was synonymous with Socialism. All politicians of whatever party were committed Social ists, their differences being only in degree, not in principles. French, British, Indian and Italian Socialists flocked to Stockholm to study the \"miracle\" at work . The foundation of Sweden's Socialist state was its welfare program. But where does Sweden's proud Socialism stand today, in 1994? Well, it is not exa ctly standing, it is more like the Leaning Tower of Pisa, leaning more and more toward capitalism with each pass- ing month. Sweden's politicians are learning that voters do no t vote altruistically, and that the age of ideal Socialism is dead and only re mains to be buried. The Swedish Socialists who blatantly interfered in South Africa n politics and marched in protest against the United States involvement in Vi etnam, are discovering that their Socialist vocabulary is outdated in a country where everything has gone to hell. Swedish Socialists sat down at the table to s up with International Socialism, only to find that their dinner guest had departed w ith the silverware. Sweden fell victim to the lies and false promises of Socialism. Today, the country is in an eco- nomic shambles and it will take fifty years for Swe den to work itself out of the mess, that is, presuming it will be permitted to do so. Britain was destroyed by Socialism a long time ago. Now, it is America's tur n.

The absolutely false picture that Socialists have p ainted of themselves as a benign, friendly organization whose only interests in bettering the lot of the com- mon people is not correct...Socialism has another b rutal, vicious face, one which history reveals will not hesitate to kill if that i s what it takes to Socialize the United States. Nothing can describe the vicious side of Socialism better than the statement made by Arthur Schlesinger: \"I don't know why Presi dent Eisenhower doesn't liq- uidate Joe McCarthy the way Roosevelt did Huey Long .\" Huey Long's \"crime\" was that he truly loved America and all of its peop le, the very first American politi- cian to fully understand what Roosevelt was doing t o the United States. Huey Long spoke out for the middle class, which he correctly perceived as the target of the Socialist, and he spoke out against Socialism on ev ery possible occasion. Great hatred of Long was expressed by the Socialist /Marxist/Communist machine in the United States, whom they called, \"th e personification of the fas- cist menace — the man most likely to become the Hit ler or Mussolini of America.\" So hungry were the little people of Ameri ca for a spokesman for their downtrodden situation, that it is believed Long rec eived up to 100,000 letters a day. Roosevelt went into a rage at the mention of t he name of Huey Long and feared that Long would succeed him as the next Pres ident of the United States. A blizzard of Socialist propaganda flew against Hue y Long. There never was such an unprecedented campaign of all-out hatred di rected against a single indi- vidual; it was frightening, it was awesome. Rooseve lt went into near epileptic fits every time Huey Long revealed further truths about the Socialists programs Roosevelt was about to impose. Huey Long lashed out at Roosevelt's British Fabian Socialist \"deals,\" urging the people to: \"De fy this kind of autocracy, defy tyranny.\" Roosevelt tried to have Long impeached fo r tax evasion, but Long came out of it without a blemish to his character. The Roosevelt camp were left with only one option: \"Murder Huey Long.\" The cause of deep concern was Long's move to assert Sates rights. He refused so- called \"federal money\" and told a wildly enthusiast ic audience in Louisiana that he was going to sue the Federal Government and get an injunction to remove all federal agencies and their offices from the borders of the State of Louisiana. Roosevelt took great fright; this was an action of which the Federal Government lived in daily fear, one that could sweep the State s and cut back the functions of the Federal Government until it was operating insid e the confines of the first 10 Amendments of the Constitution of the United States , its wings clipped, its agen- cies confined to the District of Columbia. \"Defy this kind of autocracy, defy this kind of tyr anny\" Long cried when he"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"A Nation Undone 203 discovered that the Federal Government was attempti ng to block the sale of Louisiana State Bonds, bonds which would provided t he revenue the State need- ed to replace the \"Federal funds\" he ordered the St ate not to accept.

The assailant, a close friend of Roosevelt, was Dr. Car l Weiss, who was gunned down by Long's guards, too late to save him, and Weiss l ay dead. Huey Long was transported to hospital, where he lin gered between life and death. In his near-death state, Long had a vision o f Americans from all walks of life who needed his leadership. He cried out to God , \"Oh Lord, they need me. Please don't let me die. I have so much to do, God, I have so much to do.\" But Long died, felled by a Socialist assassin. Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley, all tried to protect America against the ravages of the Socialis ts, all paid with their lives. So did Congressman L.T. McFadden, Senator William Bora h, Senator Thomas D. Schall and President Kennedy, after renouncing Soci alism. Socialism is far more dangerous than Communism, bec ause of its inherent, evil slow approach to forcing drastic, unwanted cha nges upon the people of the United States. There is only one way to overcome th is violently dangerous men- ace, and that is for the whole people to be educate d to where they recognize what they are up against and toss Socialism out, neck an d crop. This can and MUST be done. \"Unity is strength.\" There are more of our pa triotic people than there are Socialists. All we need is leadership and an educat ed people to stand fast in the face of the vicious tyranny which every president S ince Woodrow Wilson has helped fasten around our necks.

We have Constitutional power to do just that."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Epilogue 205 EPILOGUE Americans and indeed the world sat around waiting f or the hammer of Communism to strike, little realizing that a greate r danger to the Republican nation state such as ours, was Socialism. Who in th e Cold War era feared Socialism? The number of writers, commentators and forecasters who said this, could be counted on one hand. Nobody thought that S ocialism was anything to worry about. The Communists played a major trick on is, keeping our collective eyes fixed on Moscow while the most terrible damage was being wrought at home. I have always maintained throughout the twenty five years I have been writing, that the greatest danger to the future well being of our nat ion lay in Washington, not Moscow. The \"evil empire\" mentioned by former Presi dent Reagan is not Moscow but Washington and the Socialist camarilla c ontrolling it. Events unfolding as we come to the close of the 20t h century bear out the accuracy of that contention. In 1994 we have a Soci alist at the helm of the nation's affairs, ably assisted by a Democrat Party that ado pted Communism/Socialism in 1980, and with more than 87 percent of the Democrat s in the House and Senate showing their Socialist colors, attempts by the peo ple to change the course of the nation via the ballot box are not going anywhere. The \"surplus to requirements\" population of the wor ld — and this includes the United States — is already being decimated by l aboratory made mutant virus- es that are killing hundreds of thousands of people . This process will be speeded up in terms of the Club of Rome's Global 2000 genoc idal blueprint — after the mobs have served their purpose. The experiments beg un in Sierre Leone with Lassa fever and media visna mutant viruses is being brought to perfection in the laboratories of Harvard University in August of 199 4. A new, even more deadly virus than AIDS is about to be released. Already released and working with deadly efficiency are the new flu virus- es. These mutant flu viruses are believed a 100 per cent more effective than the \"Spanish flu\" viruses tested on French Moroccan tro ops in the fading days of WWI. Like the Lassa fever viruses, the \"Spanish flu \" virus got out of control, and in 1919, swept the world and killed more people tha n the total military casualties"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"206 One World Order: Socialist Dictatorship of both sides in WWI. There was no stopping it. Cas ualties in the United States were horrendous. One out of every seven people in b ig cities in America were swept away by \"Spanish flu.\" People fell ill in the morning from fever and a debilitating tiredness. Within one or two days, the y died — by the millions. Who knows when the new flu mutant viruses will stri ke? In 1995 or perhaps the summer of 1996? Nobody knows. Also waiting in t he wings is Ebola fever, its proper title, \"Ebola Zaire\" named after the African country of Zaire, where it first surfaced. Ebola fever cannot be stopped; it is a me rciless killer, which acts fast and leaves its victims horribly contorted and bleed ing from every opening in the body. Recently, Ebola Zaire has surfaced in the Uni ted States, but the news media and the Centers for Disease Control are saying litt le about it. Research experi- ments have been going on with Ebola viruses at the U. S. Army Medical Research Institute involving this and other highly dangerous viruses. What is the purpose behind unleashing these dreadfu l killer viruses? Population control is given as the reason, and if w e read the statements made by Lord Bertrand Russell, Robert S. McNamara and H.G. Wells, the new killer virus- es are merely what these men said was coming. In th e eyes of the Committee of 300 and the Socialist camarilla, there are just too many unwanted people on the earth. But that is not the whole story. The real reason be hind the planned global mass genocide is to create a climate of instability . Destabilize nations, set people's hearts fluttering with fear. War is part of that pl an, and in 1994, war is every- where. There is no peace on earth. Miniscale wars r age in what was the Soviet Union; in former Yugoslavia the war goes on between the factions artificially cre- ated in the first place by British Socialists. Sout h Africa will never again be the land of peace it once was; India and Pakistan are n ot far behind. This is the result of years and years of careful Socialist planning. There are 100 more nations today than there were in 1945. Most of these are built on a shaky alliance of tribal-ethnic division s with religious differences, dif- ferences in culture. They will not survive, having been created and placed on the shelf to await the destabilization process. The Uni ted States is being thrust into similar divisions thanks to clever long range Socia list planning. America in 1994 is ripe to be riven apart by racial, ethnic and rel igious differences. America long ago ceased to be \"one nation under God.\" No nation can survive cultural differ- ences, especially where language and religion play a crucial role. The Socialist are forging ahead through President C linton to exploit this fact of life, which we try to hide every 4th of July. Th e next decade will be one in which these divisions boil up and over. America wil l be divided by income, lifestyle, political outlook, race and geography.

Beautiful cities will be ruined by l ack of social services and police protection as local and state governments, delibera tely starved of revenues, are unable to meet the rising costs of services and pro tection. Crime will spread to the suburbs. Formerly safe sub urbs will be come crime infested suburbs. It is all part of the Socialist p lan to break up major cities and scatter population groups — even into your safe nei ghborhoods, which in ten or more years are likely to be as crime ridden and gan g-infested as the inner cities of major American cities are now. Illegitimacy rates won't be controlled by abortion, because abortion is direct- ed toward stemming the middle class birth rate. Mad ame Kollontay's Socialist abortion and free love was always intended as a bra ke on the middle class becom- ing too powerful. The illegitimate birth rate will grow and grow among the work- ing poor. There is now a population explosion of il legitimate babies who are growing up fatherless with mothers unable or unwill ing to care for them. This is Fabian Socialism in action, the evil dark side of F abian Socialism that was always kept out of sight. The new underclass now coming up in America will co nsist of millions of unemployed and unemployable, which means a huge flo ating, unstable popula- tion that can only turn to crime for survival. Subu rbs are going to be flooded with the underclass and its street gangs. The police wil l not be able to stop them—and for a while they will be allowed free rein to do th e destabilizing work for Socialism.

Bitter hard times lie ahead, all the Democrat Party promises are just so much sounding cymbals. Lacking education, training, jobs — with industrial employers either wiped out or relocated in foreign countries — unemployed mobs will roam the streets in search of a living they were promise d by the Socialists.

Can anything be done to stop the ravaging of this n ation? I believe what is needed is to arouse the super-wealthy in the conser vative ranks — and there are many of them — and get them to support a foundation that would teach a crash course on the Constitution of the United States, ba sed solely on the reading of the Annals of Congress, the Congressional Globes and th e Congressional Record. These documents contain the finest information abou t the Constitution together with a great deal of information about Socialism an d its plans for a One World Government — New World Order, the new Dark Age of s lavery. Armed with this information, millions of citizens c ould challenge their rep- resentatives who vote for unconstitutional measures . For instance, if 100 million informed citizens challenged as unconstitutional Cr ime bill, and gave notice that they would not obey the provisions of the measure b ecause it is 100 percent unconstitutional, it would never have passed the Ho use and Senate. This is the only route left for patriotism to express itself. I t can, and it must be done. The hour IS late. To those who respond to the Socia lists plans to bring the United States down to the level of any Third World country, \"this is the United States, it can't happen here,\" I would say, \"IT IS ALREADY HAPPENING.\" Who would have thought a few scant years ago that a n unknown, obscure gover- nor of a relatively unimportant state would become the President of the United States — even though 56 percent of the voters voted AGAINST him? This is SOCIALISM IN ACTION, forcing unpopular, unwanted ch anges upon the United States. THE LEGACY OF SOCIALISM; A CASE HISTORY At 9.40 a.m. Friday, September 30, 1994, Richard Bl anchard, a 60 year old architect was shot in the neck after stopping for a red light at the edge of San Francisco's Tenderloin district. As Blanchard sat i n his car in broad daylight, waiting for the light to change, two 16 year old th ugs approached him, pointed a gun at him and demanded money. At that moment the l ight changed and Blanchard tried to drive away. He was shot in the n eck and today lies totally par- alyzed and on life supports in hospital. As the law now stands, the 16-year old thug may not be named nor can his photo be published. According to a report in the Sa n Francisco Examiner, Blanchard's friend, Alan Wofsy stated: \"It means so meone in San Francisco is not safe stopping at a red light during a regular worki ng day. It takes away the whole innocence of life. The idea that you have to be vig ilant in carrying out your nor- mal daily tasks because your life may be taken away , means there are no more"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Epilogue 209 boundaries to civilized behavior. Another part of t his tragedy is that this is a man whose hands were everything to him. Over nothing a man is reduced from being a wonderful architect to being a paraplegic.\" The police response to this nightmare was, \"roll up your windows and lock your car doors. If someone sticks a gun in your fac e give him whatever he wants. It's not worth losing your life over a watch or you r wallet.\" This is the legacy of Socialism: \"Yield to criminal thugs because the pol ice cannot protect you, and having been disarmed by Socialist legislation that is 100 percent unconstitution- al, you can no longer protect yourself.\" After arch-Socialists Art Agnos and Diana Feinstein (both former mayors of San Francisco) left office, San Francisco was what they had made it, a Socialists nightmare. Had Mr. Blanchard been allowed his const itutional right to carry a gun in his car, the thugs, knowing this, would likely h ave thought twice about approaching him, or any citizen bearing arms. But thanks to the unconstitutional actions of Socia lists like Feinstein, the cit- izens of California and many of the other States ha ve been disarmed and are now advised to \"stand and deliver\" in the face of crimi nals carrying guns. What would the Colonists, who refused to pay a tax of one penn y a pound on tea, think of mod- ern America and such an official admission of total , abject failure by the State to protect its citizens? Blanchard's tragic story is repeated a thousand tim es a month across the United States. What is needed is a return to the Co nstitution, with a sweeping away of all gun laws and soft Socialist laws that p rotect criminal thugs like the one who shot Blanchard. Every citizen has the right to keep and bear arms. If this were widely advertised and generally known that cit izens were exercising that right, the crime rate would plummet. No thug would dare to approach a motorist with a gun in plain view. The tidal wave of Socialism is sweeping all before it. That tidal wave has to be confronted very soon and turned back, otherwise the United States is headed for extinction in the manner of ancient Greece and Rome. Police departments teli us they are understaffed and don't have the financi al resources to confront the crime wave. Yet, in the same breath Clinton forces through an unconstitulionai so- called \"Crime\" bill that is largely a Socialist tra nsfer program with very little help for our police In Washington D.C., the nation's crime capital with more restrictive laws on gun ownership that in any other city, the mayor rec ently appealed to the President to send in the National Guard to deal with black on black gang violence.

There is nothing in the Constitution to support the so- called \"wall of separation\" described by Jefferson and it is not part of the Constitution. The First Amendment was NOT intended to wall off the state from religion, which is what the Everson case suddenly f ound constitutional. How could a mere figure of speech uttered by Jefferson — and then only in relation to the State of Virginia — suddenly become law? By what co nstitutional mandate was this done, and by what precedent? The answer is NON E in both cases. The \"wall of separation\" was an excuse for Frankfur ter to exercise his bias against the Christian religion and in particular, against t he Catholic Church. Again we say, THERE IS NO CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION FOR THIS MYTHICAL \"WALL OF SEPARATION BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE.\" In t his, Frankfurter was greatly influenced by anti-Catholic Harold J. Laski and Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, both hardened Socialists.
