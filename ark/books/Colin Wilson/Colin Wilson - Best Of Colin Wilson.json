I s aw t hat wh at he wa s descri bing was not a mysti cal or ‘occul t’ exper ience, but sim ply an unus ually dee p sense o f emp athy. Sartre on ce said that to enjoy a book is to rewri te it ; my fri end had done the same for Schubert’s Octet. We are bound t o ‘enter into ’ m usic if it is to be mo re th an ju st a me an i ng l es s n oi se ; b ut cl ea rl y, my fri end had entere d into i t ten ti mes as deeply as u sual, lik e going down in a lift. But then, per haps it is a mist ake to emphasis e this element of empathy or sympat hy. I had a simil ar experi ence when writi ng a book a bout Bern a rd Shaw. A fr iend had bor rowed a book that I wanted to consult; and on this particular morning, he retur ned it. So I sat down at my typewri ter f eeling pleased I had it back. I t was a pleas ant, warm day, wit h the sun streaming through on to my d esk. I was writ ing th e chapter a bout Shaw ’s ma rriage and ‘bre akthrough ’, after years o f ploddi ng around Lon do n’s theatres a nd conce rt halls—as a critic. No doubt I wa s ‘identifying’ with Shaw, imagini ng what it must have been li ke to feel that you hav e sail ed out o f a storm in to a quiet har bour. But this was not what expl ained that sudden feel ing of intens e joy, as if my heart had turned into a balloon an d was s aili ng up into the air. It was no t just Shaw ’s lif e that was so meh ow pa ss i ng th ro ug h my mind; it was something bigger : a sense of the multipl ici ty of l ife i tsel f. I n a sense, I wa s ba ck in E dw ard ia n London ; but i t coul d just as easily have been Goethe’s We imar or Mozart’s Salzburg. In fact, this ‘other mode ’ of consci ousness i s a stat e of percepti on rather than empathy — an a waren ess of a wi der range of ‘fact’ — of the a ctuality of the worl d outsi de me. What has changed i n such exper iences is our perspect ive.

I n t he se ex pe ri en ce s, we s ee m t o sa il up a bov e th is visual pers pe cti ve, and the obj ects on t he horiz on are as r eal as m y fingers and toe s. Th is is t he experi ence that lay at th e he art of The Outsider. The ‘Roman ti c Outsi ders’ — Rouss eau, Shell ey, Hoff mann, Holderl in, Berlioz, Wagner, Dostoev sky, V an Gogh, Nietsz che — wer e alw ays experi encing f lashes of the ‘ other mode’ of consci ou snes s, with i ts tant alis ing hi nt of a new ki nd of percepti on, in which di stant r ealit ies ar e as real as the present mo me nt. But this created a new problem : intense diss atis facti on with the ordinary form of consciousne ss, with its em pha sis on the immediate and t he tri vial . So the r ate of dea th by sui cide or tubercul osis was alarmingl y high among writers and arti sts of the ninet eenth centur y. Many of t hem seemed to feel that thi s was inev itab le: th at d eat h an d de spa ir were the price you p aid for these flashe s of the ‘other m ode’. Even a re lativ ely l atecomer to th e scene l ike Thomas Mann conti nued to thi nk of th e problem in t erms of these bleak opposites: stupi dity and health, or intensi ty and death. I was inclined to que stion this equation. In many cases, the misery seemed self- infl ict ed. Eli ot was rig ht when he snapped: ‘Shell ey wa s a fo ol.’ S helle y was a fool to fall in love with every pretty face that cam e by, a fool t o be lieve Eng land cou ld be im pr oved by v iolent revolution, a foo l to give way to self-pity every tim e he got d epressed, and to feel that the sit uation cou ld be im pro ved by ‘ly ing d ow n like a w ear y child to weep away this life of care’. The sam e criticism appli es to a large num ber of ‘rom antic outsiders’. Still, even when full allo wance was made for weakness and self-pi ty, there w as anoth er problem that c ou ld not be dismiss ed so easi ly. L . H. Myers had cal led i t ‘the near and the f ar’ (in t he novel of that ti tle) . The young Pr ince J ali g azes"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"F RA NK EN ST EIN ’ S C ASTLE 13 out over the de sert in the light of the setting sun, and reflects that there are two d eserts, ‘one that was a glor y for t he eye, another that i t was a wea riness to tr udge’ — the near and the far. And the horizon, with a ll its promise, is always ‘the far’. The ne ar is tri vial and bori ng. Huysmans had made the s am e point amusingly in A Reb ours, where, aft er read ing Dickens, the hero, Des E sseintes, has a sud den crav ing fo r Lo ndo n. W hile waitin g for his t rain he goes to the E nglish tavern ne ar the Ga re St Laza re, an d ea ts roast bee f and potatoe s, and drinks pints of ale. Then it str ikes him that he has, so to speak, tasted t he essence of Engl and, and that ‘it would be m adness to risk spoil ing suc h unforg ettabl e experi ences wit h a clumsy change of loc alit y’. So he takes a c ab back home. Yet Myers ha d also glimpse d an an swer w hen he ma de Ja li reflect: ‘Yes, one day he w ould be vigorous eno ugh in brea th and stri de to capt ure the pr omise of the horizon.’ He may not have believed it himse lf, but it was still the correct answ er: vitali ty. In 1960, my convi cti on was confi rmed by the work of an Ame rican professor of psychology, Abraham Maslow. Maslow said he had got tired of studyi ng s ick p eop le becaus e they never talk ed about an ything but their illness; so he d ecided to study hea lthy p eop le in stead. He soon made an interest ing discovery: that hea lthy people fre que ntly had ‘peak experience s’ — flas hes of i mm ense happines s. For exam ple, a young mother was watchi ng he r husband and c hild ren eati ng breakfast when a beam of su nlight came th rough th e wi ndo w. It suddenly struc k her how lucky sh e was, and she went int o the peak exp erience — t he ‘ other mode’. Masl ow made another inter esti ng disc overy. When he talked to h is st udents about peak experi ences, t hey began rec oll ecti ng peak exper iences which they had had, but which they had often ov erlook ed at the time. Moreover , as soon as they began t hinki ng about and discussi ng peak exp eriences, they be gan h aving th em r egula rly . In other wo rds: t he peak experi ence, the moment when the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"F RA NK EN ST EIN ’ S C ASTLE 14 near and the far seem to com e togethe r, is a product of vitality and optimism . But it can also be amplifi ed or repeated through refl ecti on, by turning the full atten ti on upon it i nstead of allowing it m erely to ‘happ en’. The case of t he young mother reinf orces t he point. She was happy as she wa tche d he r hu sba nd a nd c hildr en e atin g, bu t it was an unrefl ecti ve happines s. The beam of sunl ight made her fee l: ‘I am ha ppy’, and insta nt ly intensi fied it. It i s as though we possess ed a kind of mirr or ins ide us, a mirr or which has the power to turn ‘th ings that happen’ into experi ence. I t s ee ms that thou ght it sel f has a power f or which i t has never been given credit. Th is was a major disc overy. It meant that — contrar y to the beli ef of the rom anti cs — t he ‘other m ode’ is withi n our control. Shelley asked the ‘spirit of beauty’: ‘Why dost thou p ass awa y and leav e our state, This dim vast vale of tea rs, vacant an d desolate?’ T he answe r, in Shelley’s case, wa s clearly that h e wen t around w ith t he assumption t hat human existen ce is a ‘d im vast vale of tears’, and regarded t he peak experi ences as vis itat ions of ‘t he awful shado w of some unseen pow er’ — inst ead of rec ognisi ng that t he u nseen p ow er la y w ithin him self. What we are speaki ng about i s what Gottf ried Benn c alled ‘pri mal perception’, that sudden sense of ‘matchless cl arity’ that gives the world a ‘new-minted’ l ook. We find it i n the sharp out lines of Japane se art, with its white mountain peaks and electric blue skies. T. E. Lawrence des cri bes one in Se ve n P i ll ar s o f Wi sd om: ‘We sta rted out on one of thos e clear dawns that wake up the sen ses w it h th e sun, whil e the int ellec t, ti red aft er the think ing of the night, was ye t abed.

It could al so be descr ibed as the robot, the me chanical part of us. O ur ‘ro bot ’ is inval uable; it t akes over diff icul t task s — lik e driv ing th e car or talki ng a forei gn languag e — and does them far more easil y and effi cient ly than wh en w e ar e do ing th em con sciou sly. B ut it also ‘g et s used’ to spring m ornings and M ozart sym phonies, destroy ing ‘the gl ory and th e freshn ess’ t hat makes the child’s wo rld so int eresti ng. The robot may be essen tial to human lif e; but he ma kes it hardly worth living. The robot seem s to be located in the brain. Th is i s clear from the effects of psych edelic drugs like LSD a nd m esc a lin, whi c h app are ntly a chie ve t heir effe ct by par alys ing ce rtain ‘chemical messengers’ i n the br ain. The result is certainly a form of ‘primal pe rception’— as Aldous Huxley noted when he took mescalin; he quoted Bl ake’s s tatement: ‘I f the doors o f percepti on were cleans ed, every thing would appear t o man as it is, infin ite.’ So cle ansing t he ‘ doo rs of p erce ptio n’ is basicall y a matter of brain physiology. In the mid-si xties I began r eading book s on the brain; one resu lt was a novel cal led The Philos opher’s Stone, in whic h I suggest that the s ecret of pr i ma l perc eption may l ie in the pre-f rontal cortex .

T he work is encyclopedic in scope, surv eying w hole fields of know ledge and spanni ng mankind’s his tory. But a central theme r uns through i t all, an idea that anyon e fa milia r with W ilson ’s work will rec ognize imme diat ely. To use one of Wilson’s own aphor isms: man is l ike a grand father clock driven by a watch spring. His potential is practically limitless, yet more often than no t he either squanders his energy or simply never recognizes what he is capable of. This straightforward obse rvatio n has led W ilson into just a bou t ever y subj ect m atte r we hum an be ings f ind in tere stin g: sex, crime , psyc holo gy, phi loso phy, science, the s upernatural, ar t, and even l iquor in A B oo k o f B oo ze . The reason for the wide-ranging applicability of his central ideas is simple: they represent a fundamental insight i nto the essential nature of mankin d, of what we are and what drives us. More specifically, W ilson is a student of consciousn ess. In their essence his id eas c once rn ma n’s p sycho logy. Since his fir st book, The Outsider, Wilson has been fascinated by what the Amer ican psyc hologist Ab raham Maslow called the \"peak experience\". This is the mome nt when a flash of insight or a moment of intensity infuses us w ith a sense of w ell-being and provides a vantage po int from whi ch we become s uddenly aw are of our tremendous pote ntial. The \"Ladder of Selves\" dis cussed in the following chapters is an image W ilson uses to conceptualize man’s capacity t o sink to depths of depression and r ise to heig hts of awareness that defy ever yday compr ehension. Each r ung of the ladder represents a diff erent degree of intensity of con sciousness. At the lowe r level s, conscious ness is diffused and p oorly focused . It is in this state that depression sets in. At the higher levels, man’s consciousness operates w ith much gre ater efficiency , and perceptions ar e more profound, flav ored with an awarenes s of the"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"richness and depth of life. Somewhere in the middle o f the ladder, perhaps nearer to the bott om, man’s everyday consciousness resides. There is lit tle point in d etailing t he ladder of selv es concept further in this preface; the followi ng chapters do this wi th the precis ion and clarity that mark all of Wilson’s writing . But it is worth commenti ng briefly on t he relationshi p between his ideas and those o f the current psychological paradigm in order to underscore their relevance. The concept of consciousness has taken a back se at in modern psycholog y. Since its incepti on as a field of study , psycholo gy has struggl ed for acceptance as a science deal ing in q uantifiable data, with prac tical appli cations yi elding posi tive res ults. And from the beginning it has been touch and go, wi th the field produc ing conceptual paradi gms that hav e a core of ill uminating tr uth, but which la ck the exac titude of mathematical equations. N o one can reasonably claim that Freud’s theories of sexual repression are remo tely si mila r to la ws of n atur e; we c ann ot sa y that all me n have oedipal complex es in the same w ay we s ay water alway s boils at 100 / C. Nevertheless, as much as we may argue the flaws in his theories, Fr eud struck upon a general tr uth about the import ance of subconscious mot ivations in human beings . There is nothi ng quantifiable about th is recognition, but most people would agree it has provi ded us wit h immensely v aluable insi ghts into human nature. But in their desperate scrabble f or acceptance by a predominan tly materi alist ic sc ience, psyc holog y and psyc hiatr y hav e become increasing ly fixat ed on physiology — and more speci fically on chemical reac tions in the br ain as the sour ce of the whole spectrum of characteris tics that makes us human. One natur al outcome of this materialistic fixation is the increase in prescription psychotro pic drug use. Ther e are drugs for depression (such as the po pular Prozac), anxiety and panic attack s, social ph obia and schizophrenia. And while there appears to be a relat ionship between consc iousness and the balance of neurotran smitters in the brain, there a re fundamental quest ions to be answ ered regar ding the nature of this relationshi p."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"For example , depression ha s been associat ed with l ow lev els of the neurotransmitte r serotonin. A neurotransmi tter is a k ind of chemical messenger that bridges t he synapses between neurons in the brai n. Pr ozac, part of a fam ily of drugs known as Se lect ive Serotonin Reupta ke Inhibitors (SSRIs), prevents s erotonin from being reabsor bed too quick ly by the brain, before i t has time to make the connection s it needs to mak e with other areas of the brain. For some people (but inte restingly, not all), the drug alleviat es feelings of depr ession. But what is obvious from most everyone’s personal experience is that depression often occurs as the result of an outside cause, such as the death of a lov ed one. In such ca ses, it is clear that i f the experience of depression is expressed in the brain as a decrease in the availabi lity of ser otonin, then it is the perception of loss on the part of the aff ected individual that alters the chem ical ratios in his brain. In other words, p erception its elf alters bra in chemistry . (2) Consciousness is key in this equation, as it is in virtually every aspe ct o f huma n ex peri ence . But it i s far more diffi cul t to qua ntif y than the number of serotonin receptors in the brain, and so is para doxic ally ign ored when i t sho uld b e the prim ary ob ject of st udy. An article in the journal Science entitled, \"Can the Placebo Be th e Cure?\", hig hlights th is problem.( 3) In 1998, the A merican pharmaceutical company Mer ck announced its invention of an antidepressant med ication called MK-869. Promising early trials indicated the drug would be a major medica l and financial success. Yet despite t his, wi thin a few months the company sc rapped its plans to rele ase MK-869 as an antidepressant . The Science article suggests that the \"placebo ef fect\", an obstacle frequently encountered by researchers testing the ef ficacy of psychotropic medications, w as to blame. In M erck’s cas e, what happened was that further studi es indicated dep ressed patients given a placebo — the equiv alent of a \"sugar pill\" w ith no medical effect — improved almost as much as those on MK-869. The results w ere signi ficant enough to fat ally unde rmine co nfide nce in th e new drug. Researchers Irving Kirsch and G uy Sapirs tein sugg est that even \"proven\" anti depressants may owe at leas t part of their efficacy to the placebo effect.(3,4) But what ex actly is the \"placebo effect\"?

As mentioned earli er, it is much easier to study inter actions betw een known chemi cal compounds (for example, Prozac and serotonin) than it is to isolate co nsciousness and study it s effects on the materi al worl d. Parapsyc hology has begun to exp lore this r elationship, a nd quantum phys ics has acknowledg ed that it ex ists. Ironi cally, p sycholog y, created expressl y to study consciousness , has shied aw ay from the challenge. This is why the work of Colin Wilson is more im portant than ever. The broad scope of books like Mysteries provides a far more comprehensive tableau of human experience from which to form theories than t he more limited subject matter of modern science. (And it is arguable that no psychol ogical theor y — no scientific theory — w ill be comple te until it incorporates the evidenc e for the paranormal.) B ut what further distingui shes Wilson’s work from the strictly materialistic approach is his emphasis on consciou sness itse lf, on th e ind ividu al as an ac tive, inte gral p art o f his own experience. The philosopher E dmund Husserl’ s idea of the intentionalit y of conscious ness, whi ch Wilson discusses in t he following chapters, demonst rates that man’s mind does not hav e to be passive. In fact, the mind is active whether we’re consciously directing it or not. In a state of misery, the mind is still actively describing the worl d, projecting all sorts of philosophical assumptions and s electivel y editing perceptions.

What surprised me most was that I was not depressed or w orried at the time. I was workin g hard, and the refore under a cer tain amount of strain, but I seemed to be ta king it all in my stride. For the past eig htee n mon ths I had been inv olv ed on the e dito ria l bo ard of a kind of encyclopedia of crime; but as every meeting ended in disagreement, it began to l ook as if the w hole project would hav e to be aba ndone d. The n, at sho rt notice , the pu blisher d ecided to go ahead. Sudden ly, everything had to be completed in a few months; and I, as co-or dinator, w as asked to pro duce around a hundr ed articles — 3,000 words each — at a ra te of seven a w eek. I began to work a t the typew riter for ei ght or nine hours ever y day and tried to unwind i n the evening s with a bottle of wine and a pile of gramophone records. One day, a cou ple of journali sts came to int erview me. In fact, they did most of the talk ing. They w ere young and enthusiasti c, with a tendency to interrupt one ano ther. W hen they left, at about two in the morning, my eyes were glazed with boredom, and I felt as if I’d been deafened with s alvos of cannon fire. This, I l ater realis ed, was the trouble. When you become bore d, you ‘le t go’; y ou sink into a kind of mental torpo r, allow ing your inner-pres sure to leak away as if you wer e a punctured ty re. The next day they came back for another session with the tape recorder. W hen they left I felt too d ull to do any w ork; instead I took the opport unity to per form a number of routine househ old chores. That night, about 4 a.m ., I woke up feeling unrested and lay there thinking about all the articles I still had to write, and the books I ought to be w riting i nstead. Anxi ety hormones b egan to tri ckle into my bloodstream, and my heartbe at accelerated.

When it was clear that I was not g oing to improve the situation by ignoring it, I tried making a frontal assault and suppressing the panic feeling by sheer w ill pow er. This prov ed to be a mistake. My face became hot , and I felt a dang erous tightness ac ross the ches t, while my heartbeat increased to a point that ter rifi ed me . I g ot up , w ent t o the kit chen and p oure d my sel f a glass of orang e juice. Then I s at down and tr ied to soothe my self as I might try to calm a frig htened horse. Gr adually, I got mysel f under control and w ent back to bed. As soon as I w as in the dark , the process star ted again: r ising pani c, accelerat ing heartbeat , the feelin g of bein g trapped . This ti me I got u p and went into the sitting- room. I was inclined to wonder if I w as having a heart attack . Quite clearly , something had gone wrong. The panic kept rising like vomit; the c alm, sane part of me k ept saying that it w as absurd, some minor physical problem that would resolve itself within twenty- four hours. Like nausea, it came i n waves , and between each wav e the re w as a bri ef fee lin g of c alm a nd r eli ef. The attack differed from nause a in that there was no point in giv ing way to it and making myself sic k. This panic c aused energy to disappear, like milk boiling over in a saucepan. The re was a vicious-circle effect; the anxiety produced pan ic, the panic prod uced furt her a nxiet y, so t he or igina l fea r was co mpo und ed by a fear of fear.

Like a for est fire, it had to be somehow contained before i t destroyed large ar eas of my inner-b eing.

Now it struck me that grown- ups are, in thi s respect, no better than chi ldren; they are surround ed by uncert ainty and insecurity , but they g o on livi ng because that’ s all there is to do. For year s after that insi ght, I had been op pressed by a sense of some terribl e, fundamental bad new s, deeper than any social or human pro blem . It wou ld c ome b ack wi th a s udde n sho ck w hen l ife seemed secure and pl easant — for ex ample, on a war m summer afternoon when I saw a ew e feeding her l ambs, looking a picture of motherly solicitude, unaware that both she and her lambs were destined for someone’ s oven. Now, as I sat in the ar mchair and tri ed to repress the panic, I realised that it was important not to start brooding on these fundamentals — our tot al ignoranc e, our lack o f the smallest shr ed of certainty about who w e are and why we are her e. That way , I realised, l ay insanit y, a fall i nto a kind of mental B lack Hole. I suppose that what seemed most ironical was that I had always felt that I understood the cause of mental illness. A cou ple of years before I had wr itten a book cal led New Pathways in Ps ychology in which I ha d argued that ment al illness is basical ly caused by the collapse of the w ill.

I wo uld m ake a n ef for t, ro use m yself to me ntal activi ty, and suddenly feel better. Then somethi ng on telev ision or i n what I was readi ng, woul d ‘remind’ me of the fear; there w as a kind of inner jerk, like a car slipping out of gear, and the panic was back. The articles s till had to be writte n; in fact, a few days later , the editor rang me to ask if I cou ld produce ten du ring the nex t week instead of the usua l seven. An American backer was waving his chequebook and dem anding speed. Since I had de cided against the temp tation to bac k out o f the pr oject , I ste pped up my production to an article and a half a day. I w as treating myself lik e a man with snak e-bite, forcin g myself to keep walki ng. Graduall y, I was lear ning the tr icks of this s trange w ar against myself. It w as rather lik e steering a glider. An unexpected flash of fear could send me into a nose dive; a mental ef fort could turn the nose upward again; sometimes this could ha ppen a dozen times in an hour, un til continued vi gilance pr oduced a feeling o f inner-streng th, even a kind of exhil aration. It w as likely to be wors t when I l et myself get over-ti red. Three months l ater, on a nig ht-sleeper from London, I woke up w ith a shock, a nd the panic w as so over powering that I was afraid I might suffer cardiac arrest. At one point, I seriously considered g etting off the trai n at the next stop and wal king — no matter wher e. Then, in one of the per iodic ebbs of pani c, I forced myself to repeat a process I had ta ught myself in previous attacks; to reach insi de myself to tr y to untie t he mental knots. While I wa s doing this, it struck me that if I could soothe myself from pa nic into ‘normality ’, then surel y there w as no reason w hy I shouldn ’t soothe mys elf beyond this point, i nto a still deeper state of cal m. As I made the effort to relax more an d more deeply, I felt the inne r turmoil gradually subside, unti l the spasms ce ased; then I pres sed on, breathing deepl y, induci ng still greater r elaxation. At the same time, I told myself that I was sick of being bullied by these stupid at tacks, and that when I got home the ne xt day I was going to do a perfectly normal day’s work. My breathing became shallow and almost ceased. Suddenly , it was as if a boat had been l ifted off a sandbank by the tide; I felt a kind of in ner jerk and floated into a state of deep quiescence. When I though about this later, it struck me that I had"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"achieved a state that is one of the basic aims of yoga: Rilke’s ‘stillness like the heart of a rose’. Slowly, I began to understand the basic mecha nism of the attacks. They began w ith a fatigue th at quickl y turned i nto a general feeling of mistrust of life, a loss of ou r usual feeling that all is (more or less) well. Then t he whole thi ng was c ompounded by the ol d problem of self-conscious ness. If you thi nk about itchi ng, you beg in to itch. I f you brood on a feeling of sickness, you feel sicker. Consciousness directed back on itself produ ces the ‘amplification ef fect’ which is the basis of all neurosis ( i.e. the harder a stutterer tries not to stutter, the w orse he becomes) . If I woke i n the middle of the ni ght and tried not to feel tense, my heartbeat w ould accelera te and the panic woul d begin. I had to develop the trick of tur ning my at tention to some every day problem, as if saying to myself, ‘ Ah yes, how inter estin g’. O nce I h ad lear ned to d o this , the at tacks became easier to av ert. It w as a great c omfort to me when a friend who had been through the same kind of thing told me that, ev en without treatment, the cond ition cures itself after eightee n months. When I tried to think out the bas ic reasons for the panic, I had to acknowledg e that my tr ouble was a certain ‘ch ildishness. ’ When a child is pushed beyond a certain limit of fatigue or tension, its will surrenders. Some instinctive sense of fair-play is outraged, and it declines to make any furthe r effort. An adult m ay also feel like surrendering to a problem, but com mon sense and stubb ornness force the wi ll to further effort. As an obsessi ve wor ker, I am accustomed to dri ve mysel f hard. Experi ence has taught me that when I get ove r-tire d, th e quic kest way to re cover y is of ten t o drive myself on until I get ‘sec ond wind.’ But to do this effectively, you need the full suppo rt of your subconscious mind, your deep sen se of inner-purpose and meaning. In this case, I was trying to push mys elf b eyo nd my nor mal l imi ts — by wr iti ng t he eq uiv alen t of a full-length book every three weeks — and some childish eleme nt in my su bconsc ious h ad gon e on st rike.

And so, when I passed a cer tain point of fatigue, I w ould discov er that there w as no more energ y to call on.

The panic, then, w as caused by a lower level of my being, an incompetent and childish ‘me’. As long as I identified with this ‘me’, I was in danger. But th e rising tension could always be countered by waking myself up fully and calling upon a more purpos ive ‘me.’ It was lik e a school mist ress wal king into a room full of squab bling children and c lapping her hands. The chaos w ould subside instantly , to be succeeded by a sheepis h silence. I came to label this ‘the sc hoolmistress effect.’ I had always k nown t hat G urdj ief f was r ight wh en he said that we contain dozens of ‘I’s’. The ai m of his method is to cause some of these ‘I’s’ to fuse together , like frag ments of broken gl ass subjected to intense heat. A s it is, c onsciousness p asses from one to the other of our ‘I’s’ like the ball in a Rugby game. Under these conditions, no continuity is possibl e, and we ar e at the mercy of every negative emotion. The schoolmistr ess effect made me recog nise a further fact about these multiple ‘I’s’ — t hat they ex ist inside me not only on the ‘Rugby field’, or hor izontal pl ane but also at di fferent levels , like a ladder. All forms of purposiv e activi ty evok e a higher ‘ I’.

They wer e so complicate d that the other s tudents dropped out one by one; Bennett felt tha t Gurdjieff was willing him to go on, even if it killed him. And then: ‘Suddenly , I was fil led with an influx of an immense power. My body seemed to have turned into light. I could not feel its pres ence in the usual ways.

I felt no fatigue, and no sense of effort. My weak, re bellious, su ffering body had become strong and obedient.

Moreover, I experienced a clarity of thought that I had only know n inv olunta rily and at r are mome nts, bu t whi ch wa s now at my command. I returned in thought to the Grand Rue de Pera and discovered that I could be aware of the f ifth dimension. T he phrase ‘in my mind’ s eye’ took on a new meani ng as I ‘s aw’ the eter nal pattern of each thing I looked at; th e trees, the pl ants, the wa ter flowing i n the canal and ev en the spade, and la stly my own body .

But Benn ett went one s tage farther still. He went for a walk in the forest and met Gurdjief f; Gurdjieff told him: \"The real complete transformation of Being, that is indispensable for a man who w ishes to fulfill the purpose of his existence , requir es a very much greater concentration of Higher Emoti onal Energy than that which comes to him by nature. There ar e some people in th e world, bu t they are very rare, wh o are connected t o a Great Reservoi r or Accumul ator of this ener gy. This Reservoi r has no limits. Those w ho can draw upon it can be a means of helping others. Suppose a ma n needs a hundred units o f this energy for his own transformation, but h e has only ten units and cannot m ake more for himself. He is helpless . But wit h the help of someone w ho can draw up on the Great Acc umulator, he can b orrow ni nety more. Then his wor k can be effective .\" Farther in the forest, Benn ett recalled a lecture of Gurdjief f’s lead ing di scip le, O uspe nsky. \"He had spoken about the very narrow limits w ithin whi ch we can cont rol ou r own f unct ions and a dde d: ‘I t is ea sy to ve rify t hat we have no contr ol over our emotions. Some peopl e imagine that they can be angry or pleased as they wi ll, but any one can veri fy that he cannot be astonis hed at wil l.’ As I r ecalled these w ords I said t o myself: ‘I w ill be astoni shed.’ Instantl y, I w as overw helmed with amazement, not onl y at my o wn state, bu t at every thing I look ed at or thought of. Each tree was so uniquely itself that I felt I could walk in the forest forev er and never cease from wond erment. The thought of ‘fea r’ came to me. At once I was shaking with terror. Unnamed horrors were menaci ng me on ever y side. I thought of ‘joy’, and felt that my he art would burst from raptur e. the word ‘love’ came to me, and I w as pervaded w ith such fine shad es of tenderness and comp assion that I saw that I had not the rem otest idea of the depth and range of love.

I wanted to be free from this pow er to feel wh atever I c hose, and at once it left me.\" Bennett’s experience is a particularly striking example of what, in The Occult , I have cal led ‘Facult y X’. When we say we know something to be true, we ar e lying . ‘Ten people died last night in an air crash. ’ ‘Yes, I know.’ We do n’t know. The r escuers try ing to free the bodies from the burning wreckage knew. For the rest of us, this knowl edge is a po or ca rbon copy. And h ow can I clai m to ‘ know’ that Mozar t wrote t he Jupiter sy mphony? I cannot even gras p that Mozart really existed. If I walk into a room in Salzburg in which Mozart ac tually pl ayed, I mig ht, if I wer e in the rig ht mood, come a little cl oser to gr asping that he actually lived. B ut I would still be a long way from ‘knowi ng’ it. There are tw o ways in whic h I might ‘k now’ that M ozart ex isted. I might sit i n a room wher e he had played and deliberatel y induce a mood of deep calm, perhaps by some form of ‘tr anscendental mediation’. Then I could grasp it, for I would have slowed my sense down, arrested their usual frantic f orward rush. Or I might grasp it in a sudden flash of intui tion, as I ru n my fingers over the k eyboard he actually touched. To do this requires intense concent ration; it i s the mental equivalent of leaping a six-foot f ence. And there is a third method, rather less satisf actory than those two, yet also less difficult. I might immerse myself in Mozart’s music, read books about his life , study his letters. Art has th e power of inducin g a degre e of Facu lty X. T his is why hum an be ings in vente d it. As we immerse oursel ves in some composer’s cr eative w orld, those i nner ‘leaks’ that drain so much o f our energy gradually close up, and our inner-press ure rises.

In 1901, a Briti sh doctor named R ichard Maur ice Bucke publ ished one of the classic s of mystici sm, Cosmic Consciousness.

In a mood of deep serenity and insight, h e suddenly found hi mself surrounded by a ‘flame coloured cloud’, w hich made him thin k for a moment that some b uilding w as on fire. Then he real ised the flame w as inside hi mself, and experienced a lightning flash of ‘illuminat ion’, of the ‘Brahmic splendour’ of the un iverse. In his book, he argues that animals poss ess ‘mer e’ c onsc ious ness , w hil e onl y ma n pos sess es s elf- consciousness .

His book studies do zens of examples of Cos mic conscious ness, from the Buddha t o Whitman. But Bucke couldn ’t actually define cosmic cons ciousness in any meaningful way. Let’s see if we can do better. W illiam James quoted Bucke in his Varieties of Religious Experience. But James himself ha s an excellent essay called ‘A Suggestio n about Mys ticism’ w hich hits the nail on the head. James suggests that mysti cal exper ience is not d ifferent in kind from ordinary consciousness, but is merely an extension of ordinary consciousness, and that even alcohol can produce a mild but valid mystical experience. He giv es three of his ow n experienc es, of which this is the most significant. ‘In one instance I was engaged in conversati on, but I doubt if my interlocutor noticed my a bstraction. What happened each time was that I seemed all at onc e to be reminded of a past experience, and this reminiscence, ere I cou ld conceive or name it disti nctly, dev eloped into somethi ng further that belonged w ith it, this in turn into something further still, leav ing me amazed at the sudden vision of increasing ranges of distant fact of which I w ould giv e no articula te account.‘ ( My ital ics.)

(Sartre calls this ‘nausea’. ) B ut James’s comments offer a new insi ght: that consciousness is, by i ts very nature, relational, like a spi der’s w eb. In ‘normal consciousness’, it is as if we are aware of ourselves in the centre of the web, and a few strands stretching around us, connecting us to objects.

Now I noticed that this relief caused a kind of mini-cosmic- consciousness — that is, as the dawn br ightened, ev erything seemed unutterably fascinating, and my head buz zed wi th flashes of insight that connected to other insights , and gave me a constant sense of 'seeing furthe r.

In this state, Greene found a rev olver bel onging to his brother, and went out on th e Berkhamsted Common and played R ussian Roulette — put one bullet in it, spun the chambers, then po inted it at his head and pul led the trig ger. When there was ju st a click , he describes ex periencing an overw helming feeling of joy and rel ief. ‘It was as i f a light had been turned on...and I felt that life contai ned an infinite number of poss ibilities . In other words, the shock induced an ep isode of mini-cosmic consciousness."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"But the really interesting phrase is: ‘ It was as if a light had been turned on.‘ If y ou go into a dar k room and turn o n the light, you see what was there all the time. In the same w ay, in The Lawless Roads, Greene admits that some situation of crisis — ‘induced in me something I had not even sus pected — a lov e of life.’ And his whi skey-pr iest, on the poi nt of being shot b y a firing squad, suddenly r ealises: ‘I t would hav e been so easy to be a saint.’ If you go in to an art gal lery that is badly lit, yo u can’t see the pictures pr operly. Y et you don’t declare that th ey are ther efore bad pictures. This is what the pessimisti c philosopher asserts about life. Edmund Husserl grasped the bas ic answer when he rec ognised that consciousness is intentional. W hen you ‘see’ something, it doesn’t just w alk in throug h your ey es. You hav e to fire your attention at it, like an arrow. If you look at your watch without this act of ‘intentiona lity’ (i.e. absent mi ndedly) y ou don’t see the t ime, and you hav e to look agai n. (Husser l will be discussed at length later.) When Greene said that he saw that life containe d an infinite number of possibilities, he meant that he fe lt free to choose between them. Tir edness diminis hes our consci ousness of freedom, and extr eme tiredness — combined wi th depression o r ‘negative feedback’ — makes us f eel that there are no possibilities, that freedom is an i llusion. In The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus states t hat the most fundamental problem of man is whether we all ought to commit suicide. He states his feeling that life is basica lly ‘absurd’ (i.e. meaningless.) He expl ains w hat he me ans w hen he s ays t hat w e go t o wor k, come home, go to w ork, come home, M onday, Tuesday , Wednesday... etc., until on e day, the con sciousness of ‘ the Absurd’ daw ns upon us. But clear ly, all that he means is that when w e suddenly feel tired and discouraged, it all seems fu tile. (Sartre calls it ‘nausea.') But then, when we get i nto this state, we are s imply faili ng to put into it w hat Granvi lle Barker calls ‘th e secret li fe.' When Graham Greene pulled t he trigg er, he was suddenly floode d with the secret life. This is w hat Chesterton calls ‘abs urd good new s. ‘ It is the recog nitio n of freed om."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Samuel Beckett r emarked that, as a young man, h e stayed in bed all day because he couldn’t see any reason f or getting up. This reveals c learly that his pessi mism is clos ely connect ed with l ack of energy. Similarly , T. S. Eliot s uffered from deep depression s about a disastrous marriage, a nd added to his natu ral tendency to aesthetic ‘w orld rejec tion’, this produced The Waste Land and The Hollow Men. In fact, the ‘mechani sms of pessimism’ are very simple and obvious. Each of us has a rob ot inside us w ho acts as a ki nd of valet. When I learn something new — like driving a car or learning to type — I have to do it painfully and consciously . But my robo t valet so on takes over, and proceeds to type or drive the car far more ef ficiently than ‘I’ coul d. He wi ll even dr ive me home w hen I am tired, an d I can’t even r emember the driv e. The trouble is t hat he not only takes over tasks I w ant him to do, like driv ing and talk ing Frenc h. He also tak es over thi ngs I do n’t want him to d o. I listen t o a symphony and am deeply mov ed; the tenth time I li sten, the robot i s listening too and I don’t enj oy it as much. I like to jok e that I have even c aught him mak ing l ove t o my wife. This robot is what Gurdjieff m eans when he says we are mechanical. He tried to dev ise methods of forcing his pupils to make far more ef fort, to foil the robo t. But he was rather pessimistic about our chance of defeati ng it permanent ly. This leads me to one of my own c entral insi ghts. You might say that, in our nor mal healthy s tate we are roughly 50% ‘robot’, and 50% ‘real y ou.’ When I am tired and low , I become 51% robo t and only 49% ‘ real me.’ On t he other hand, w hen I am happy and full of energy, I am 49% robot, and 51% ‘real me.’ Now consi der w hat happ ens if I am so pe rmanent ly t ired t hat my normal condition is only 49% ‘ real me’ and 51% robot. Because I see the world as a duller place, I cease to make so m uch effort, so my vita l batteries get low . This makes it look duller still, and makes effort seem even more pointless. If I am not careful, I g o into ‘negativ e feedback’, w hen I become 55% robo t and only 45% real me. This is a hi ghly dang erous state, bec ause I now feel so low tha t"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"all effort seems poi ntless, and I may slide dow nhill into ment al illness — such as catatoni a — and become a ki nd of vegetabl e. On the other hand, if I use the ins ight of my ‘ peak’ states — when I am 51% ‘real me’ — to keep me at a high lev el of drive and optimism, I may achieve s tates in w hich I am 52% or 53% real me. It is also i mmensely impor tant not to attach too much importance to temporary s etbacks, and abov e all, to av oid the stupid h abit of allowing ourselve s, when di scouraged, t o start looki ng into the future and seeing it as a series of possible disasters and defe ats. 90% of our problems are self-crea ted. This is w hat the Hindu scripture means by ‘the mind is the sl ayer of the re al.’ Now one cons equence should be perfectly clear. If I can reach a high enough level, nothing can ever cause me to backslide. I shall be on such a level of vitality — seeing the sheer fascin ating-ness of the world from a bird’s eye vi ew — that I can now adj ust to the worst that fate can throw at me, so to spea k. In The Brothers Karamazov, Dostoevsk y makes Iv an say that t he world is so lousy that he just wants to give God back his entrance ticket. Y et he also makes Alyosha say : ‘There is a strength to overcome anything. ‘ Ivan ’s gloo my view is basi cally a worm’s eye view. Ye t we ca n als o see that it is p ossi ble t o ach ieve a bird’ s eye view that would b e permanent. In short, w e have prov ed — mathematically, so to speak — the p ossibility of that next step in evolution, in which we permanentl y reach a h igher stag e. I have another useful concept that explains what goes wrong with us when we are tired. I call it the ‘Wha t-is-worth-the-effort level’ (Whittle for short, althoug h the letters don’t quite match-up.) When you have a low Whittle threshol d, you feel that nothing is worth doing. People with a high W hittle threshold are interested in everyt hing, and li fe strikes them as self-evide ntly fascina ting. Fr om what has been said above, we can see that Sam uel Beckett is simply a man with a l ow Whittle threshold. So when he tel ls us that life is futile a nd absurd, he is merely st ating that he has a low Whittle threshold — whi ch is much li ke telling us that he has toothache.

But for most of the characters I discussed in The Outsider the problem is not so simple. Ivan Karamazov talks about ‘giving God back his entrance ticket’ beca use of the horror he feels about human cr uelty. For Van Gogh, it w as a choice betw een the Eternal Y es of the ‘Starr y Nig ht’ and the ‘ Eter nal No ’ of ‘ Miser y will ne ver en d.’ I n the 20th cent ury, the sheer scale of the po litical horrors has made us far more conscious of Eter nal No. Having looked at the advocates of Eterna l No, let us look more closely at Eternal Yes. T.E.Lawrence describes s etting out on one of those ‘clear dawns that wake up the senses w ith the sun, w hile the intel lect, tired after the thinking of the night, was yet abed. For an hour or two, on such a morning, the sounds, scents and colours of the world s truck man individual ly and dir ectly, not filtered throug h or made typi cal by thought...’ This is obviously the basic ‘poetic’ mood, the mo od in which all poets, from Hesiod to Rup ert Brooke, have felt that the world is a miraculous pl ace — like L ondon seen from Westminster Bridg e by Wordsworth, ‘all br ight and g littering in the smokeles s air. ‘ Recent discov eries in ‘ split brai n physiolo gy’ enabl e us to understand all this scienti fically. E ven in the 19t h century, it had been recognis ed that the tw o halves of our brains hav e different functions. The speech funct ion resides in the left half of the br ain, and doctors obser ved that peopl e who had rec eived damage to the left brain became i narticulate. The right si de of the brain w as obviously connected with recognition of shapes and patterns, so that an artist who had right-brain damage would lose all artistic talent. One man coul d not even dr aw a clov er leaf; he put the t hree leaves of the c lover si de by side, on the same lev el. Yet an arti st with left brain damage only became i narticulate; he was still as good an artist as ever.
