Hebegan to practise in 1966, and, like most psychiatrists, soon began to encountercases in which patients heard ‘voices’ inside their heads.Now such cases are not particularly rare, and ‘hearing voices’ is certainly nota sign of madness. Dr Julian Jaynes, a Princeton psychologist, began to make astudy of auditory hallucinations after experiencing one himself — he was lyingon a couch when he heard a voice speaking from the air above his head. Naturallyconcerned about his sanity, Jaynes discovered, to his relief, that about 10 percent of people have had hallucinations of some sort, and that about a third ofthese take the form of ‘phantom voices’. One perfectly normal young housewifetold him that she held long conversations with her dead grandmother everymorning when she made the beds.Jaynes, of course, takes it for granted that such experiences arehallucinations, and for a long time, Adam Crabtree shared that belief. Then heencountered a case that raised some basic doubts. It concerned a young womannamed Sarah Worthington, who was the patient of a female colleague of Crabtree’scalled Jenny. After a treatment that had been initially successful, SarahWorthington had suddenly plunged into moods of depression in which she wastempted to commit suicide.The three of them met in Crabtree’s office, and he began to probe herdifficulties. One of his questions was whether she had ever heard voices insideher head, and she admitted that she had. Crabtree asked her to lie down andrelax, and to do her best to try to recall these inner conversations. Almostimmediately, the girl’s body tensed, and she exclaimed: ‘Oh, the heat! I’m hot!’And as she went on speaking, both psychiatrists observed the change in hervoice. Sarah lacked confidence; this new personality had the voice of someonewho was used to exercising authority. When they asked the woman what she wantedto do, she replied: ‘Help Sarah.’ It was a clear indication that this was notSarah. They asked the woman her name, and she replied: ‘Sarah Jackson.’ Sheidentified herself as Sarah’s grandmother. Crabtree explained that he and Jennywere also trying to help Sarah, and asked the ‘grandmother’ if she would bewilling to help; she replied yes. This ended the first session.At the next session, the grandmother soon came back. She was still talking abouta fire, and at one point she asked: ‘Where is Jason?’ Jason, it transpired, washer son, and the fire she was referring to had taken place in 1910. SarahJackson had rushed home as soon as she heard that there was a fire in her street— her seven-year-old son had been left in the house alone. The wholeneighbourhood was ablaze. In fact, Jason had been moved to safety by neighbours,but it took Sarah Jackson another hour to discover this, and in the meantime shehad rushed around the streets in a frenzy, stifling in the heat. The experiencehad imprinted itself deep in her consciousness.According to the grandmother, she had ‘taken possession’ of Sarah Worthingtonwhen her granddaughter was playing the piano — both of them loved music. And itsoon became clear that, in spite of her avowed intention of helping hergranddaughter, it was Sarah Jackson herself who was in need of help. She wastormented by guilt feelings about her own life — particularly about how badlyshe had treated her daughter Elizabeth, Sarah’s mother. Elizabeth had developedinto an unhappy, neurotic girl, who had in turn treated her own daughter badly.And Sarah’s relations with her mother were a strange duplicate of Elizabeth’srelations with her mother. Both mothers had greatly preferred their son to theirdaughter, and had taught the daughter that men were everything and womennothing. The grandmother had become fully aware of all this by the time shedied, which is why she now felt that she had to help her granddaughter. Insteadof helping, she had made things worse; Sarah was frightened and confused by thevoice inside her, and was becoming desperate.Now grandmother Jackson was ‘out in the open’ things became much easier. She wasable to give the psychiatrists invaluable information about Sarah’s familybackground. And although Sarah was at first astonished to realise that hergrandmother was speaking through her, she gradually learned to accept it, andbegan to achieve deeper insight into her problems. At the end of two months shewas cured. The grandmother remained a ‘possessing presence’, but now Sarahunderstood it she was no longer afraid; in fact, it gave her a sense of comfortto feel that her grandmother was a vaguely beneficent presence in the backgroundof her life.The reader’s reaction to this story is probably much the same as my own, when Ifirst read it in the typescript of Adam Crabtree’s Multiple Man: that there mustbe some purely psychological explanation. Sarah had known her grandmother as achild; perhaps she had heard the story about the fire from her own lips. Perhapsshe recognised how similar her mother’s problems had been to her own. And herunconscious mind had ‘re-told’ her the story as a rationalisation of her ownsufferings … But the more I read of Crabtree’s book (which his publishers hadsent to me, asking if I would write an introduction) the more I saw that suchexplanations are unacceptable. He goes on to recount another eight cases fromhis practice, each one involving some type of ‘possession’. And after the thirdor fourth case, the unconscious mind explanation had begun to wear very thin. Asocial worker named Susan was unable to sustain any normal relationship with amale, and recognised, correctly, that this was due to some deep resentmenttowards her father. Crabtree was able to speak to her father — who had died in acar crash — just as he spoke to Sarah’s grandmother, and he learned that he hadbeen sexually obsessed with his daughter. Until she was sixteen, he had creptinto her bedroom after she was asleep and had fondled her genitals. On someunconscious level, she was aware of what was happening. She recognised hisdesire for her, and treated him with contempt, behaving provocatively andexercising her new-found sexual power to make him squirm. The contempt spreadinto her relations with boyfriends and caused problems. When her father died inthe car crash, he was drawn to his daughter as a ‘place of refuge’, and she wasvulnerable to him because of the sexual interference. Once ‘inside’ her, he wasin a condition of ‘foggy sleep’, unaware of his identity or his presentposition. Crabtree patiently explained to Susan’s father that he was actuallydead, and that he ought to leave his daughter alone. And one day, he simplyfailed to appear at the therapeutic session; Susan experienced a sense of reliefand freedom.I found one case particularly fascinating and intriguing; it concerned auniversity professor called Art, whose first marriage had been unsuccessful, andwho was about to embark on a second. He was beginning to experience a deepreluctance to go through with the marriage, and he associated this with ‘innerstorms’ in which a censorious voice criticised him and various people he knew.He was vaguely aware that the voice sounded like his mother — who was living inDetroit — and he had arrived at the commonsense explanation that the voice wassome negative aspect of himself, and that he had somehow incorporated elementsof his mother, who had always been intensely possessive towards him.Crabtree followed his usual procedure, placing Art in a state of deeprelaxation, and then opening a dialogue with the mother, who was calledVeronica. Veronica was perfectly willing to talk at length about her relation toher son, and about why she disapproved of so many of his friends. ‘Veronica cameacross as blatantly, almost naively, self-centred …’ She explained that shesimply wanted to make her son recognise that many people he trusted — includinghis future wife — were stupid and scheming and not worthy of his respect.Crabtree asked her if she thought all this interference could be good for herson, or even good for herself, and she finally admitted that the answer wasprobably no. In Detroit she was living a drab and boring life, and Crabtreepointed out that if she paid more attention to her own affairs and less to herson’s, things might improve.During the therapy, Art’s mother discovered that she had a cancerous growth, andhad to have an operation. The ‘Veronica’ who spoke through Art’s mouth agreedthat this might be because she was robbing herself of vitality by ‘possessing’her son. And at this point, Art’s ‘inner voice’ began to fade, until he finallyceased to hear it. But there was a remarkable change in his mother in Detroit.She had been experiencing a slow deterioration, and emotional withdrawal fromlife. Now, suddenly, her vitality began to return; she started going out andmaking new friends. ‘She seemed to have gained the proverbial “new lease” onlife.’Crabtree insists that his own attitude towards such cases is not that of abeliever in the paranormal; he claims to be merely an observer, aphenomenologist, who simply treats each case ‘as if it were possession. Andclearly, there is nothing contradictory in such an attitude; Susan and Sarah andArt could have been manufacturing the voices themselves; the unconscious mind iscapable of far more remarkable feats. Still, the fact remains that most readerswill feel that, taken all together, these cases make an overwhelming impressionof being something more than unconscious self-deception.I turned back to Julian Jaynes to see what he had to say about ‘disembodiedvoices’. He outlines his theory in a remarkable work called The Origin ofConsciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, published in 1976(‘bicameral’ means simply having two compartments). Jaynes advances theextraordinary theory that our remote ancestors heard ‘voices’ all the time, thereason being that — according to Jaynes — early man lacked all self-awareness inour modern sense of the word. Jaynes believes that our cave-man ancestors couldnot look inside themselves and say: ‘Now let me think …’, because they had no‘inner me’. Their eyes were like a car’s headlamps, directed permanently towardsthe outside world. So if one of these men was ordered to go and build a dam downthe river, he would find it extremely difficult to remember why he was amblingalong the river bank. But his sense of purpose would be refreshed by a voice —the voice of his chief — which seemed to come from the air above his head, andwhich would repeat his instructions.And where would that voice come from? According to Jaynes, from the right-handside of the brain. For Jaynes’s theory depends heavily on the science of‘split-brain’ research, which has made such remarkable advances since themid-1950s.For some reason no one yet understands, the brain consists of two identicalhalves, as if a mirror had been placed down the middle. (It has even beensuggested that one of them is intended as a ‘spare’ in case the other half getsdamaged). The top part of the brain, the part immediately below the skull, isthe specifically human part; it is called the cerebrum, or cerebral hemispheres,and it has developed at a phenomenal speed over the past half million years(which, in evolutionary terms, is the mere bat of an eyelid). If you couldremove the top of the skull, the two halves of the brain would look rather likea walnut. The bridge that joins them together is a bunch of nerves called thecorpus callosum.For more than a century it has been known that the left hemisphere deals withlanguage and logical thinking, while the right seems to deal with patterns andintuitions. The left enables us to add up a column of figures, the right torecognise somebody’s face. You could say that the left is a scientist and theright is an artist. A man with left-brain damage will probably develop a speechimpediment, but he could still draw a picture or hum a tune. A man withright-brain damage will sound perfectly logical and coherent, but he willprobably not even be able to draw a matchstick man.The strangest thing is that if the bridge joining the two halves, the corpuscallosum, is severed (as it sometimes is, to prevent epilepsy), the patientliterally becomes two people. One ‘split-brain’ patient tried to unzip his flieswith one hand while the other tried to do them up; another tried to hit his wifewith one hand, while the other held it back. Another tried to do a jigsaw puzzlewith his right hand, and his left hand kept trying to interfere, so that he hadto sit on it. (It should be added that the right brain controls the left side ofthe body, and vice versa — once again the reason is a mystery.)But the most significant discovery is that the person you call ‘you’ lives inthe left brain; the person who lives in the right seems to be a stranger. Onesplit-brain patient whose right brain was shown a dirty picture (i.e. with herleft eye) blushed; when asked why she was blushing, she replied: ‘I don’t know.’Jaynes believes that ‘disembodied voices’ come from this ‘other person’ in theright side, and that they sound in the left brain — the ‘you’ — as if through aloudspeaker.There is one obvious objection to this theory. Jaynes is not a split-brainpatient, yet he had an auditory hallucination. The same applies to AdamCrabtree’s patients. The curious answer is that, to some extent, we are allsplit-brain patients. Every one of us is more or less out of touch with thatdeeper intuitive self. Mozart once remarked that tunes were always walking intohis head fully fledged. What he meant, obviously, was that tunes came into hisleft brain — the ‘I’ — from the other half, the half that creates tunes andpictures. And if even Mozart is, in some sense, a split-brain patient, then therest of us most certainly are.According to Jaynes, it was voices that walked, fully fledged, into the leftbrain of our remote ancestors. They assumed — understandably — that these werethe voices of the gods — or of God — and this is why people in the Old Testamentor the Iliad are always being told what to do by divine voices …This particular aspect of Jaynes’s theory is irrelevant to our presentdiscussion; all that concerns us here is his belief that ‘voices’ originate inthe right brain, and that men have been hearing them since the beginning ofhuman history. If that is correct, it certainly offers a plausible explanationfor the voice of Sarah’s grandmother and Susan’s father and Art’s mother — infact, in the latter case, it sounds far more convincing than the notion that aliving woman in Detroit could somehow ‘get inside’ her son’s head in distantToronto.It is when Jaynes goes on to discuss the voices heard by mental patients thatcertain doubts begin to arise. He points out that most of the cases that havebeen studied involve schizophrenics, and says: ‘They converse, threaten, curse,criticise, consult, often in short sentences. They admonish, console, mock,command, or sometimes simply announce everything that’s happening. They yell,whine, sneer, and vary from the slightest whisper to a thunderous shout. Oftenthe voices take on some special peculiarity, such as speaking very slowly,scanning, rhyming, or in rhythms, or even foreign languages. There may be oneparticular voice, more often a few voices, and occasionally many …’The voices described by Crabtree do not sound in the least like this bewilderingbabble; they apparently conversed like any normal person. And the same appliesto the housewife who held long conversations with her grandmother as she wasmaking the beds. There is no reason, of course, why ‘phantom voices’ should notsound like those of a normal person; but it seems to be a fact that most of themdon’t.This is confirmed by a study made by another clinical psychologist, Dr WilsonVan Dusen, formerly of the Mendocino State Hospital in California. Van Dusenspent sixteen years observing the effect of hallucinations, and he describes hisfindings in a chapter called ‘The Presence of Spirits in Madness’ in his bookThe Presence of Other Worlds. His conclusions are, perhaps, even more startlingthan those of Julian Jaynes.Van Dusen explains that most patients who are hallucinating prefer to keep theirexperiences to themselves, since they know it will be taken as a proof that theyare mad. However, one unusually cooperative patient asked him if he would mindtalking directly with her hallucinations, and he did. Naturally, thehallucination could not answer Van Dusen direct; he had to ask the patient togive an account of what he could hear and see. But there was nothing to stop VanDusen addressing the hallucination directly. ‘In this way I could hold longdialogues with a patient’s hallucinations and record both my questions and theiranswers.’ And, like Adam Crabtree, he insists: ‘My method was that ofphenomenology. My only purpose was to describe the patient’s experiences asaccurately as possible. The reader may notice that I treat the hallucinations asrealities — that is what they are to the patient.’One consistent finding, says Van Dusen, was that the patients felt as if theyhad contact with another world or order of beings. ‘Most thought these otherpersons were living. All objected to the term “hallucination”.’For most individuals the hallucinations came on quite suddenly. One woman wasworking in the garden when an unseen man addressed her. Another man describedsudden loud noises and voices he heard when riding in a bus. Most werefrightened, and adjusted with difficulty to this new experience. All thepatients described voices as having the quality of a real voice, sometimeslouder, sometimes softer, than normal voices. The experience they described wasquite unlike thoughts or fantasies; when things are seen they appear fully real.For instance, a patient described being awakened one night by air force officerscalling him to the service of his country. He got up and was dressing when henoticed their insignia wasn’t quite right, then their faces altered. With thishe knew they were of the Other Order and struck one hard in the face. He hit thewall and injured his hand. He could not distinguish them from reality until henoticed the insignia …Most patients soon realise that they are having experiences that others do notshare, and for this reason learn to keep quiet about them. Many suffer insults,threats and attacks for years from voices with no one around them aware of it.Perhaps Van Dusen’s most significant finding is that he learned that hispatients seemed to experience two distinct kinds of ‘voices’; he speaks of theseas the ‘higher order’ and the ‘lower order’:Lower order voices are similar to drunken bums at a bar who like to tease andtorment just for the fun of it. They suggest lewd acts and then scold thepatient for considering them. They find a weak point of conscience, and work onit interminably. For instance, one man heard voices teasing him for three yearsover a ten cent debt he had already paid. They call the patient everyconceivable name, suggest every lewd act, steal memories or ideas right out ofconsciousness, threaten death, and work on the patient’s credibility in everyway. For instance, they brag that they will produce some disaster on the morrowand then claim credit for one in the daily paper. They suggest foolish acts,such as raise your right hand in the air and stay that way, and tease if he doesit and threaten him if he doesn’t.In fact, it seems clear that these ‘lower order’ hallucinations behave exactlylike bored children with nothing better to do.The vocabulary and range of ideas of the lower order is limited, but they have apersistent will to destroy. They invade every nook and cranny of privacy, workon every weakness and belief, claim awesome powers, make promises, and thenundermine the patient’s will …A few ideas can be repeated endlessly. One voice just said ‘hey’ for monthswhile the patient tried to figure out whether ‘hey’ or ‘hay’ was meant. Evenwhen I was supposedly speaking to an engineer … the engineer was unable to doany more arithmetic than simple sums … The lower order voices seem incapable ofsequential reasoning. Though they often claim to be in some distant city, theycannot report more than the patient hears, sees or remembers. They seemimprisoned in the lowest level of the patient’s mind …The ‘lower order’, then, are basically tormenters. But about one fifth of thehallucinations seem to be of a higher order, and they, on the other hand, seemconcerned with helping the patient. The ‘higher order’ is much more likely to besymbolic, religious, supportive, genuinely instructive; it can communicatedirectly with the inner feelings of the patient. It is similar to Jung’sarchetypes, whereas the ‘lower order’ is like Freud’s id. Van Dusen mentions acase of a gaspipe fitter who experienced a ‘higher-order’ hallucination of alovely woman who entertained him while showing him thousands of symbols. ‘… hisfemale vision showed a knowledge of religion and myth far beyond the patient’scomprehension’. After Van Dusen had been holding a dialogue with this‘higher-order’ hallucination, the gaspipe fitter asked for just one clue to whatthey had been talking about.Van Dusen reports that he has been told by these ‘higher-order’ beings ‘that thepurpose of the lower order is to illuminate all of the person’s weaknesses’. Andthe purpose — or one of the purposes — of the ‘higher order’ seems to be toprotect people against the ‘lower order’:This contrast may be illustrated by the experiences of one man. He had heard thelower order arguing for a long while about how they would murder him. He alsohad a light come to him at night, like the sun. He knew it was a different orderbecause the light respected his freedom and would withdraw if it frightened him.In contrast, the lower order worked against his will, and would attack if itcould sense fear in him. This rarer higher order seldom speaks, whereas thelower order can talk endlessly.While the ‘lower order’ ‘is consistently nonreligious and anti-religious’,jeering angrily at the least mention of religion, the ‘higher order’ ‘appearedstrangely gifted, sensitive, wise and religious’.Van Dusen made one extremely striking observation about the hallucinations.Although he was able to observe a very large number of them over the years, hesoon realised that ‘after twenty patients, there wasn’t much to be learned’because the hallucinations were all so similar. This in itself seems baffling.After all, one would expect to find as many different types of hallucination asthere are people. For example, one might expect vets to have hallucinations thatclaim to be talking animals, engineers to be tormented by talking machines,gardeners to be haunted by talking plants or trees, librarians by talking books,dentists by talking sets of false teeth. Nothing of the sort. The ‘lower-order’hallucinations were all strikingly similar; so were those of the ‘higher order’.This either implies some basic similarity in the part of our minds that createhallucinations, or something far stranger …Van Dusen is inclined to believe in something far stranger. Through his interestin ‘hypnogogic phenomena’ — the odd dreams and visions we sometimes experienceon the edge of sleep — Van Dusen seems to have turned to the writings of theSwedish religious mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, whose Journal of Dreams is full offascinating raw material for the psychiatrist. After a career as a highlysuccessful engineer and geologist, Swedenborg went through a mental crisis atthe age of fifty-six — in 1744 — during which he experienced horrifyingnightmares: being caught in the wheel of a huge machine, feeling between awoman’s thighs to find that her vagina was full of teeth … Finally, he dreamedhe was holding a conversation with Jesus. He abandoned science and became anobsessive student of the scriptures. The result was a series of remarkable workscontaining his own theology. He became one of the most powerful influences onthe religious thought of his time.What made his works so unusual was that he claimed to have actually visitedheaven and hell, and to have held long theological discussions with angels anddeceased religious teachers. (He actually claimed to have converted MartinLuther to his own theology, but was unable to make John Calvin see reason.) Thisagain might be dismissed as the fairly typical delusion of a religious crank,except that he was able to offer some impressive evidence that he really hadbeen in touch with the dead. The queen of Sweden asked Swedenborg to give hergreetings to her dead brother — probably in a spirit of mild mockery. At thenext court reception, Swedenborg greeted the queen from her brother, and saidthat he wanted to send his apologies for not answering her last letter; he wouldnow do so through Swedenborg … The queen turned pale and said: ‘No one but Godknows this secret.’ The widow of the Dutch ambassador asked Swedenborg tocontact her deceased husband because she had received a huge bill from agoldsmith, and she was convinced that her husband had already paid it.Swedenborg came to see her a few days later, and told her that he had talkedwith her husband, and the goldsmith’s receipt was in a secret compartment in abureau. The widow knew nothing about any such compartment: but that is preciselywhere the receipt turned out to be …Swedenborg also described at some length what it was like to be ‘possessed’ byspirits, and Van Dusen was struck by the extraordinary similarity betweenSwedenborg’s accounts and the hallucinations described by patients in theMendocino State Hospital. Swedenborg says that spirits and angels can conversewith man directly by entering ‘by an internal way into his organ of hearing,thus affecting it from within’. Swedenborg goes on: ‘To speak with spirits atthis day is rarely granted because it is dangerous …’, which clearly seems toimply that there was some past age in which men could converse more directlywith ‘spirits’. The explanation Swedenborg gives is that spirits do not normallyknow ‘they are with man’, because there is a kind of barrier between theseentities and man’s own consciousness. If spirits get through this barrier — orare allowed through because a man has dabbled in ‘the occult’ — they are likelyto become a nuisance. ‘Evil spirits are such that they regard man with deadlyhatred, and desire nothing more than to destroy him, both body and soul.’Swedenborg also mentions that the barrier between spirits and humanconsciousness may be broken by people who ‘indulge much in fantasies, so as toremove themselves from the delights proper to the natural man’. This, says VanDusen, is a pretty good description of what we now call schizophrenia. (Weshould note that schizophrenia does not mean ‘split personality’ — as the modernmisconception has it — but simply a withdrawal from reality.)‘All of Swedenborg’s observations on the effect of evil spirits entering man’sconsciousness conform to my findings’, says Van Dusen. And he mentions passagesin Swedenborg in which the characteristics of the ‘lower order’ are described:their determination to destroy a man, their ability to cause anxiety or pain,their desire to destroy conscience, their hatred of religion, their tendency tobully, threaten, deceive and lie, and their curious skill at mimicry. All thesecharacteristics of the ‘lower order’, as experienced by mental patients, arespecifically described in the writings of Swedenborg. Van Dusen was particularlystruck by their hatred of religion. ‘If voices are merely the patient’sunconscious coming forth, I would have no reason to expect them to beparticularly for or against religion. Yet the lower order can be counted on togive its most scurrilous comments to any suggestion of religion.’ Swedenborgalso notes the obsession of the ‘lower order’ with filth and obscenity, anotherpoint noted by Van Dusen.Van Dusen also observed that although the lower order claim to be individuals,they seldom reveal any trace of real personal identity. Swedenborg explains thatthe personal memory is taken from them at death, so they are forced to rely onthe memory and abilities of the person they are ‘possessing’. Another strikingsimilarity between Swedenborg’s spirits and the ‘lower order’ is the attempt topossess some organ or part of the patient’s body. ‘Several worked on onepatient’s ear, and he seemed to grow deafer. One voice worked for two years tocapture a patient’s eye, which went visibly out of alignment.’ They often setout to possess the genitals. ‘One female patient described her sexual relationswith her male spirit as both more pleasurable and more inward than normalintercourse.’There is an equally striking correspondence between the ‘higher order’ describedby mental patients and the entities Swedenborg calls ‘angels’. The angels arekind, helpful and wise. The reason that they are so sparing of words is thatman’s ‘interior mind’ does not think in words, but in ‘universals which comprisemany particulars’ — that is to say, in intuitive insights. They are, in short, aright-brain function. Or, to put it another way, ‘angels’ communicate throughthe right cerebral hemisphere, and prefer symbols — we may recollect Van Dusen’sgaspipe fitter who was shown hundreds of universal symbols in an hour by his‘higher order’ mentor. Swedenborg also notes that ‘higher order’ spirits can seethe lower ones, but not vice versa — which again corresponded to Van Dusen’s ownexperience.Van Dusen was inclined to wonder why ‘higher-order’ hallucinations are so muchrarer than those of the ‘lower order’ (approximately one fifth as many).Swedenborg suggests an answer. Angels, he says, possess the very interior ofman, and their ‘influx is tacit’. So they are simply less apparent than thehostile spirits, who make sure their presence is recognised.What are we to make of all this? Both Crabtree and Van Dusen insist that theytry to function solely as observers, implying that the reader can choose whichexplanation he prefers — spirits or the unconscious mind. But we have seen thatVan Dusen is inclined to wonder why, if the ‘lower order’ is merely thepatient’s unconscious, they should show such consistent hostility to religion.And how can we explain the following story from Crabtree’s book? An acquaintanceof Crabtree’s called Pat was invited by a girlfriend to spend a weekend at hergrandparent’s farm. The grandparents turned out to be dabblers in the occult,and parts of the house, such as the attic, gave Pat peculiar feelings ofuneasiness. Later, the grandparents suggested that Pat should try automaticwriting, which she did with some misgivings. The moment she took the pen in herhand and relaxed, she slipped into a drugged, trance-like state, and experienceda numbness in her hand and arm. She seemed to see a woman who appeared behindher; the woman had a doll-like face, and wore a long mauve gown. Pat felt asthough her energies were being usurped by this woman, and suddenly her handwrote: ‘Elizabeth Barrett Browning here.’ (Her hosts had earlier mentionedElizabeth Barrett Browning). There followed a long message which included theinformation that Mrs Browning and Robert were having difficulty getting used totheir ‘new surroundings’. Slowly, the energy seemed to diminish until thewriting stopped. But Pat felt oddly dissociated for the rest of the day.Later that evening a second session was held. This time several different‘entities’ used Pat’s hand to write, and the messages were of a ‘coarse nature’.At a third session, ‘Mrs Browning’ answered the question ‘Where do you livenow?’. ‘Everywhere … nowhere. We are you and you are us.’ After that she seemedto become very cagey.Then the handwriting changed to that of Pat’s deceased brother Tom, and therewas a message of love and comfort. But when Pat said how moved she felt, hergirlfriend snapped: ‘That wasn’t Tom. They’ll pretend to be anyone.’ Evidentlyshe knew a great deal about ‘lower-order’ entities.Later, one of the grandparents remarked that some entity no longer seemed to bein the house; it had left because it was attracted to Pat’s aura. Pat wasdisturbed at the thought that she had been used as a kind of sponge to soak upsome dubious force.Back home again, Pat began to hear ‘Elizabeth’ ’s voice inside her head, and shefelt oddly detached from reality. ‘Elizabeth’ tried to persuade her to do moreautomatic writing, but she felt that if she did this, she would only beconsolidating the ‘spirit’s’ hold. ‘We need you’, said ‘Elizabeth’. ‘If yourefuse to speak to us we shall live in your room, in your walls.’Pat’s girlfriend had told her that if she ignored the entity, it would soon goaway. She found that it was not as easy as that. She tried reading a trashynovel and ignoring the voice, but a sensation that someone was pressing her faceagainst her own made it hard to concentrate. In bed she tossed and turned soviolently that she had to remake the bed several times. But she felt that her‘starvation’ technique was the right one. After a few days, her ability toconcentrate began to return; slowly, little by little, the influence of theentities (for she felt there was more than one) began to diminish. Finally, shehad the impression that she could actually see the woman in the mauve dressreceding, turning first into a mauve mass, then into a ‘low grade vibration’.Pat may have been very suggestible, and her unconscious mind may have createdthe woman in mauve, but it must be admitted that this explanation seems lessconvincing than the alternative — that Pat had willingly opened herself to oneof the ‘lower order’, and had to extricate herself as best she could.Descriptions of this type of possession are familiar in ‘occult’ literature. TheAmerican researcher Alan Vaughan describes how he himself became ‘possessed’ fora time. He had bought himself an ouija board, to amuse a friend who wasconvalescing. Soon he was receiving all kinds of messages, some of which seemedto convey information that was not available to Vaughan’s own unconscious mind —for example, when the radio announced the death of the newspaper columnistDorothy Kilgallen, from a heart attack, they asked the board if this was true;it replied that she had actually died of poison. Ten days later, this proved tobe true. (It was suspected — and still is — that she died because she knew toomuch about the John F. Kennedy assassination). Then, to his alarm, Vaughan foundthat a spirit who called itself ‘Nada’ (‘nothing’ — recalling ‘Elizabeth’ ’sanswer to the question about where she lived) had ‘got inside his head’. ‘Icould hear her voice repeating the same phrases over and over again’ — in thetypical manner of the ‘lower order’. When asked about this, the board replied:‘Awful consequences — possession.’A friend who understood such matters undertook to help Vaughan, and another‘spirit’ took possession of his hand and made him write a message: ‘Each of ushas a spirit while living. Do not meddle with the spirits of the dead.’ Then thespirit seemed to cause an uprising of energy in Vaughan’s body which pushed both‘Nada’ and the helpful entity out of the top of Vaughan’s head:I felt a tremendous sense of elation and physical wellbeing … My mind began torace in some extended dimension that knew no confines of time or space. For thefirst time, I began to sense what was going on in other people’s minds, and, tomy astonishment, I began to sense the future through some kind of extendedawareness …*Here again, we can see that Vaughan’s account seems to tally closely with whatSwedenborg had to say about angels and spirits. ‘Nada’ repeated the same phrasesover and over again, as the ‘lower order’ always do. She identified herself asthe wife of a Nantucket sea captain, and Vaughan remarks that she seemed toresent the fact that he was alive and she was dead. The entity that helped topush ‘Nada’ out of Vaughan’s head sounds very much like one of Swedenborg’sangels.But could not both entities have been a product of Vaughan’s ‘right brain’, asJulian Jaynes suggests? This is conceivable; yet again, there does seem to be adistinction between the manifestations of the right brain, and ‘lower order’entities. The right brain is the intuitive self — the aspect of us that providesinsight and ‘inspiration’ — such as the tunes that ‘walked into’ Mozart’s head.It has better things to do than repeat the same stupid phrase over and overagain.The distinction can be seen clearly in a case I have described elsewhere,** thatof Brad Absetz, an American teacher living in Finland, who accidentally stumbledupon the trick of establishing contact with his ‘other self’. After the death oftheir child from cancer, Brad Absetz’s wife retreated into a state ofschizophrenia. For hours at a time, she would lie on the bed, her eyes closed,struggling with guilt and depression. Brad would lie there beside her, waitingfor her to emerge from these sessions of gloomy introspection so he couldcomfort and encourage her. He lay totally alert, waiting for the slightestmovement that would indicate that she was returning to normal awareness. Yetclearly, a man who lies on a bed for hours at a time will drift into a state ofrelaxation. One day, as he lay there in this combined state of relaxation andalertness, he experienced a curious sense of inner freedom, of release from thebody, almost as if floating clear of the bed. Then he noticed an impulse in themuscles of his arm, as if it wanted to move. Brad mentally gave his arm‘permission to move’, and it floated up into the air. Soon both arms were makingspontaneous movements, while he looked on as a bystander.In the dining hall, where buffet meals were served, his hands showed adisposition to select food for themselves; for several weeks, he allowed them toselect the food they preferred — it was seldom what he would have chosen himself— and noticed that he began to lose weight, and to feel fitter than ever before.His ‘hand’ later used crayons and paints to create an extraordinary series ofpaintings, and to make metal sculptures. It also began to write poems infree-verse form, and these poems were remarkable for a certain clarity andpurity of language.What had happened is that the right-brain self had begun to express itself; wemight say that in the parliament of his mind, the member for the unconscious hadworked up the courage to start making speeches. Psychologists refer to the rightbrain as the ‘non-dominant hemisphere’; in most of us, it behaves like asuppressed housewife who never dares to utter her own opinion. Brad’s hours ofquiescence had taught her to overcome her shyness.One day when he took up a pencil to allow his hand to write, the handwriting wasquite different from his own. A woman named herself and briefly introducedherself. Brad’s immediate reaction was a powerful sense of rejection. He pushedthe paper away, and said forcefully: ‘I will not be a mouthpiece for anyone butmyself.’ The ‘communicator’ went away and did not return. Here we seem to have aclear distinction between the ‘voice’ of the right brain and some externalcommunicator or spirit.In short, whether we can accept it or not, it seems that there is a prima faciecase for the existence of disembodied entities with which we can, under certaincircumstances, communicate.Let us, for the moment, give Swedenborg the benefit of the doubt on thesematters, and consider what else he has to say. His views are very simple.According to Swedenborg, man is a spirit who inhabits a body, in precisely thesame way that a driver sits in an automobile. The body is no more the man thanthe automobile is. At death, the man leaves his body behind, and continues toexist in an incorporeal form. When the heartbeat ceases, the spirit — that is,the man himself — passes on to another plane of existence, and this is describedby Swedenborg at some length in his book Heaven and Hell.Our first reaction to this is that it reveals a certain naivety. We are aware ofpersonality as something that changes and develops over the course of alifetime. H. G. Wells points out that every single cell in our body changesevery seven years, so a man of forty is totally different from the same man atthirty or fifty. Moreover, personality can alter through some accident; forexample, people who have received violent blows on the head may seem to turninto another personality. One leading investigator of the paranormal, ProfessorJohn Taylor, writes in The Shape of Minds to Come: ‘We recognise personality asa summation of the different contributions to behaviour from the various controlunits of the brain.’ So to assume that the personality can survive death is alittle like assuming that a house will somehow go on existing after it has beendemolished, or that the ‘spirit’ of a ship will live on after it has beendismantled in the breaker’s yard. My personality wilts visibly when I get tired,and it goes out like a light when I fall asleep. So the very idea of itssurviving death seems a logical absurdity.All these objections were beautifully summarised in an article Bertrand Russellwrote in the 1930s on ‘Do We Survive Death?’.* A person, he says, is simply aseries of mental occurences and habits, and if we believe in life after death,we must believe that the memories and habits that constitute the person willsomehow continue to exist. This leads him to state flatly: ‘It is not rationalarguments, but emotions, that cause belief in a future life.’ He goes on to saythat one feeling that encourages the belief in survival is admiration for theexcellence of man. He quotes the Bishop of Birmingham on the subject. Man knowsright and wrong. He can build Westminster Abbey. He can make an aeroplane. Hecan calculate the distance to the sun. So how can we believe that he will perishutterly at death?This, says Russell (in effect), is emotional rubbish, the same kind of rubbishthat stood in the way of Galileo and Newton and other great scientists when theywanted to investigate the universe. People like the Bishop of Birmingham saidthat the planets must move in circles, because the circle is the most perfectcurve, and that all species must be immutable because God would not bother tocreate something that was imperfect.… And they were, of course, quite wrong.Anyway, says Russell, it is only when we think abstractly that we have a highopinion of man. Civilised states spend half their revenue on murdering oneanother. Think of all the horrors that human beings have committed on oneanother … Surely if our world is the outcome of deliberate purpose, the purposemust have been that of a fiend?These last arguments are actually as emotional and illogical as those Russellattributes to the Bishop. The heart of his argument lies in his assertion that aperson is simply a series of mental occurrences and habits. And my ownexperience contradicts this. I feel a strong conviction that the being who looksout from behind my eyes is the same person as the baby who opened his eyes onthe world fifty-odd years ago. It is true that he drove a Mini, and I drive arather heavy saloon model. It is also true that I have almost entirely forgottenwhat it felt like to be that baby. All the same, I feel that we arefundamentally the same person.Moreover, I have noticed that my own children began to reveal theirpersonalities when they were very small indeed — so small that they could dolittle but drink milk and sleep. If John Taylor and Bertrand Russell arecorrect, and personality has its source in the control units of the brain, thenwe must all be born with remarkably individual control units.But we could go on arguing like this until the cows come home. Nothing willconvince Russell that human beings are more than a series of mental occurencesand habits, and nothing will convince the Bishop that we are not immortal souls.Let us, instead, turn to a different type of testimony: that which claims to bepersonal experience. The trouble with such stories is that most of them areuncheckable, so whether you can accept them or not depends on your credulitythreshold — or what Renée Haynes called the ‘boggle threshold’. What it boilsdown to, eventually, is how far we feel we can trust the individual concerned.Consider, for example, the following story told by the well-known playwrightAlfred Sutro, in his reminiscences Celebrities and Simple Souls (1933). Sutrosays that he has only had one single psychic experience in his whole life. Hewas being driven along a country road by his chauffeur when he thought he heardthe wail of a child. He asked the chauffeur to stop. The man said he could hearnothing. But Sutro followed the sound behind some trees, and down a slope to ariver bank. There he found a pretty child of three or four, crying and sobbing.She was soaking wet, and had obviously fallen into the water. He carried herback to the car, but was unable to make her stop crying long enough to tell himwhat had happened. He asked her where she lived, and pointed ahead; the girlnodded, so the chauffeur drove on. Not far away they came to a gate, and thegirl signalled towards it. They drove along a drive to the front door of a‘largish house’. As the car pulled up a man and woman rushed out to meet Sutro.‘Have you any news of the child?’ ‘She’s in the car’, said Sutro, and went backto it. But the car was empty. ‘Where’s the little girl?’ he asked the chauffeur,but the man looked blank. ‘The child I brought to the car.’ ‘You didn’t bringany child into the car.’They drove back to the river bank; the body of the child was lying in a few feetof water …An extraordinary story, certainly one which most people would dismiss aspreposterous. But there is a certain amount of circumstantial evidence in itsfavour. Sutro was a famous playwright of his time, and would presumably not telllies for the fun of it. And the fact that it was his only psychic experiencealso suggests that it was genuine.It was not. Sutro states that he has told the story to various people who dabblein the psychic and occult, and has been offered various explanations. But he hasnever been offered the true one, which is that he has made it up. It wasevidently intended to demonstrate the gullibility of people who believe in lifeafter death …Once we know that, we can begin to see the weaknesses in the story. Would a mandriving in a car hear the crying of a child? And even if he did, would he botherto stop to investigate — crying children are not all that rare. Would thechauffeur not have asked him what on earth he was doing, as he talked to theempty seat next to him and asked it where it lived? Would he have got out of thecar at the front door, leaving the child behind in the car?These are the sort of questions we have to ask of any ‘supernatural’ experienceif we wish to avoid being taken in. And this was recognised by the earlyinvestigators of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), when it was formed in1882. They saw that it was necessary to get the corroboration of as many peopleas possible, and to get them to make sworn statements. Even that, of course,would not guarantee that a story was not bogus. But in a few cases, thecircumstantial evidence and the corroboration of witnesses would combine to makethis highly unlikely. One such story is told in the Proceedings of the SPR,Volume 8, for 1892, and it can serve as an example of a story that bears all thehallmarks of truth. It was told by the Rev. J. L. Bertrand, the Protestantpastor of Neuilly-sur-Seine, and corroborated by the other people concerned.Bertrand was in Switzerland, leading a party of young men in the ascent of amountain called the Titlis. When they were not far from the summit, Bertrandfelt too tired to go on, so he asked the rest of the party — led by a guide — togo on without him, and pick him up on their way down.I sat down, my legs hanging over a dangerous slope or precipice, my back leaningon a rock as big as an armchair. I chose that brink because there was no snow,and because I could face better the magnificent panorama of the Alpes Bernoises.I at once remembered that in my pocket there were two cigars, and put onebetween my teeth, lighted a match and considered myself the happiest of men.Suddenly I felt as if thunderstruck by apoplexy, and though the match burned myfingers, I could not throw it down. My head was perfectly clear and healthy, butmy body was as powerless and motionless as a rock. There was for me nohesitation. ‘This’, I thought, ‘is the sleep of the snows! If I move I shallroll down in the abyss; if I do not move I shall be a dead man in twenty-five orthirty minutes.’ A kind of prayer was sent to God, and then I resolved to studyquietly the progress of death. My feet and hands were first frozen, and littleby little death reached my knees and elbows. The sensation was not painful, andmy mind felt quite easy. But when death had been all over my body my head becameunbearably cold, and it seemed to me that concave pincers squeezed my heart, soas to extract my life. I never felt such an acute pain, but it lasted only asecond or a minute, and my life went out. ‘Well’, thought I, ‘at last I am whatthey call a dead man, and here I am, a ball of air in the air, a captive balloonstill attached to earth by a kind of elastic string, and going up and always up.How strange! I see better than ever, and I am dead … Where is my last body?’Looking down, I was astounded to recognise my own envelope. ‘Strange’, said I tomyself. ‘There is the corpse in which I lived and which I called me, as if thecoat were the body, as if the body were the soul! What a horrid thing is thatbody — deadly pale, with a yellowish-blue colour, holding a cigar in its mouthand a match in its two burned fingers. Well, I hope that you shall never smokeagain, dirty rag! Ah! if only I had a hand and scissors to cut the thread whichties me still to it! When my companions return they will look at that andexclaim, “The Professor is dead.” Poor young friends! They do not know that Inever was as alive as I am, and the proof is that I see the guide going uprather by the right, when he promised me to go by the left; W— was to be thelast one on the rope, and he is neither the first nor the last, but alone, awayfrom the rope. Now the guide thinks that I do not see him because he hideshimself behind the young men whilst drinking at my bottle of Madeira. Well, goon, poor man, I hope that my body will never drink of it again. Ah! there he isstealing a leg of chicken. Go on, old fellow, eat the whole of the chicken ifyou choose, for I hope that my miserable corpse will never eat or drink again.’I felt neither surprise nor vexation; I simply stated the facts withindifference. ‘Hullo!’ said I, ‘there is my wife going to Lucerne, and she toldme that she would not leave before tomorrow, or after tomorrow … They are fivebefore the hotel at Lungern. Well, wife, I am a dead man. Goodbye.’ … My onlyregret was that I could not cut the string. In vain I travelled through sobeautiful worlds that earth became insignificant. I had only two wishes: thecertitude of not returning to earth, and the discovery of my next glorious body,without which I felt powerless. I could not be happy because the thread, thoughthinner than ever, was not cut, and the wished-for body was still invisible tomy searching looks.Suddenly a shock stopped my ascension, and I felt that somebody was pulling andpulling the balloon down. My grief was measureless. The fact was that … ourguide had discovered and administered to my body the well-known remedy, rubbingwith snow … Here is for me an obscurity. I remember only that all seemed to meconfusion and chaos, and I felt disdain for the guide who, expecting a goodreward, tried to make me understand that he had done wonders … I never felt amore violent irritation. At last I could say to my poor guide, ‘Because you area fool you take me for a fool, whilst my body alone is sick. Ah! if you hadsimply cut the string.’‘The string? What string? You were nearly dead.’‘Dead! I was less dead than you are now, and the proof is that I saw you goingup the Titlis by the right, whilst you promised me to go by the left.’The man staggered before replying, ‘Because the snow was soft and there was nodanger of slipping.’‘You say that because you thought me far away. You went up by the right, andallowed two young men to put aside the rope. Who is a fool? You — not I. Nowshow me my bottle of Madeira and we will see if it is full.’‘The blow was such that his hands left my body and he fell down, saying,evidently to himself, ‘Did he follow us? No, we should have seen him. Could hesee through the mountain? Is his body dead, and does his ghost reproach me forwhat I did?’‘Oh’, said I brutally, ‘you may fall down and stare at me as much as you please,and give your poor explanations, but you cannot prove that my chicken has twolegs because you stole one.’This was too much for the good man. He got up, emptied his knapsack whilemuttering a kind of confession, and then fled.The Rev. Bertrand’s observation that his wife had gone to Lucerne a day earlierthan intended also proved to be correct.In a case like this, we have not only the corroboration of the other peopleconcerned, but also the Rev. Bertrand’s apparently ‘impossible’ knowledge ofwhat the guide had been doing while his back was turned. If he was mistaken tobelieve that he experienced death, then he certainly had some strange experienceof extra-sensory perception.There are a number of interesting points about this account. One is the ‘string’that Bertrand keeps wishing was cut. He does not explain what he means by astring, but, as we shall see, it can be found again and again in accounts ofso-called ‘out-of-the-body experiences’ (OBEs for short), in which people have‘floated’ out of their bodies and had a sensation of looking down on thephysical body, connected to it by a kind of shining cord. Another is Bertrand’sability to perceive things that were happening elsewhere — what the guide wasdoing, his wife preparing to visit Lucerne, and so on. Again, this has beendescribed repeatedly by people who claim to have had out-of-the-bodyexperiences. Yet another point to note is Bertrand’s feeling of relief at beingout of his body, and the subsequent feeling of reluctance — in fact, of rage —when he was drawn back into it. This is again a familiar feature of suchaccounts.And this, basically, is what distinguishes the Rev. Bertrand’s story from theone invented by Alfred Sutro. Sutro’s tale is the kind of thing that people whoknow very little about psychical research imagine to be a typical ghost story.It is not. If we are to judge by the thousands of records in the annals of theSPR, or its American or European equivalents, ‘real’ ghosts do not sit around onriver banks, a few yards from their drowned bodies, making sobbing noises loudenough to be heard over a car engine. They do not allow themselves to be pickedup, or point out the houses where they live. Neither, for that matter, do theywalk around with their heads underneath their arms, wailing or clanking chains.The typical apparition, as described in report after report, looks quite like anormal person. One lady was sitting reading when a tall, thin old man enteredthe room; when she looked more closely she recognised him as her great uncle. Helooked agitated, and was carrying a roll of paper. He made no reply when shespoke to him, but walked out of a half-open door. She was not in the leastalarmed because she made the natural assumption that her great uncle had come tosee her. By the next post she received a letter from her father asking her to goand see the great uncle, who was seriously ill. She went, but found that he haddied the previous afternoon, at exactly the time she had seen him. A roll ofpaper was found under the dead man’s pillow, and his niece concluded that he hadwanted to change his will in her father’s favour, but had been overtaken bydeath. This story is taken from one of the classic volumes of early researchundertaken by founder members of the SPR, Phantasms of the Living, by Gurney,Myers and Podmore (Volume 1, p. 559). And it follows basically the same patternas hundreds of similar accounts. (This particular book is well over a thousandpages long). And the story told by the Rev. Bertrand follows the same kind ofpattern as hundreds of similar records of near-death or after-death experiences.It is always possible to pick holes in each individual account. For example, thecase of the great uncle was passed on to the SPR by a certain Major Taylor, whoexplained that the lady who wrote it, ‘Miss L’, wished to withhold her name indeference to the views of a near relative. The whole thing could have beeninvented by Miss L, or by Major Taylor or, for that matter, by the authors ofthe book. But then, there are hundreds of cases in Phantasms of the Living, andmost of them show the same basic similarities; it seems unlikely that they wereall invented.This is finally the most convincing argument for the view of life after deathput forward by Swedenborg: there is such an enormous body of similar evidence tosupport it. There are literally hundreds of reports of ‘life after death’ thatdisplay the same pattern. That pattern is roughly as follows. After the deathexperience, which may be accompanied by a sense of pain or suffocation, there isa sudden sensation of freedom. In many cases, the person has a sense of passingdown a long tunnel, and seeing a light at the end. Then he finds himself lookingat his own body. This is usually accompanied by a feeling of deep peace, and acertain relief at having done with physical existence. The person may find itimpossible to accept the idea that he is dead, and tries to talk to otherpeople. They ignore him — although animals sometimes seem to be aware of him. Hetries to touch them; his hand goes through them. And, again and again in theseaccounts, the ‘dead person’ is met by relatives who have already died; thishappens only when he acknowledges that he is dead. There seem to be many casesin which the dead person is in a state of confusion, rather like being in afever, and fails to grasp that he is no longer alive. In that case, he mayremain trapped on earth — an ‘earth-bound’ spirit — indefinitely.The obvious objection to the Rev. Bertrand case, as evidence of life afterdeath, is that there is no real evidence that he did experience death. He mayonly have passed into a dream-like state. Even his accurate knowledge of theguide’s misdemeanours is not proof that he experienced death; it may have beensome kind of ‘dream clairvoyance’. But there have been many cases in which‘spirit mediums’ have relayed messages that claim to come from the dead, andwhich describe the death process in some detail. Here is a typical case from therecords of a modern researcher, Dr Robert Crookall. It concerns the death of DrKarl Novotny, a pupil of the psychologist Alfred Adler. His friend GreteSchröder had dreamed of Novotny two days before his death at Easter, 1965, andin her dream he announced his forthcoming death. When this actually happened,she was so impressed that she went to consult a medium — although before thisshe had taken no interest in such matters. The medium transcribed an account ofNovotny’s death by means of automatic writing, in a hand which Grete Schröderrecognised as Novotny’s own.‘Novotny’ described how, when he was spending Easter at his country home, heagreed to go for a walk with some friends. He had been feeling ill for sometime, and seems to have had doubts about whether to accompany them:However, I forced myself to go. Then I felt completely free and well. I wentahead and drew deep breaths of the fresh evening air, and was happier than I hadbeen for a long time. How was it, I wondered, that I suddenly had no moredifficulties, and was neither tired nor out of breath?I turned back to my companions and found myself looking down at my own body onthe ground. My friends were in despair, calling for a doctor, and trying to geta car to take me home. But I was well and felt no pains. I couldn’t understandwhat had happened. I bent down and felt the heart of the body lying on theground. Yes — it had ceased to beat — I was dead. But I was still alive! I spoketo my friends, but they neither saw me nor answered me. I was most annoyed andleft them …And then there was my dog, who kept whining pitifully, unable to decide to whichof me he should go, for he saw me in two places at once, standing up and lyingdown on the ground.When all the formalities were concluded and my body had been put in a coffin, Irealised that I must be dead. But I wouldn’t acknowledge the fact; for, like myteacher Alfred Adler, I did not believe in after-life … I went up the hill towhere Grete lives. She was sitting alone and appeared very unhappy. But she didnot seem to hear me either.It was no use, I had to recognise the truth. When finally I did so, I saw mydear mother coming to meet me with open arms, telling me that I had passed intothe next world — not in words, of course, since these only belong to the earth.Even so, I couldn’t credit her statement and thought I must be dreaming. Thisbelief continued for a long time. I fought against the truth and was mostunhappy …*It is easy to sympathise with Bertrand Russell’s mistrust of this kind of‘evidence’. It sounds like wishful thinking. It also contradicts our commonsenseassumptions. For example, he describes himself taking deep breaths of theevening air. Do the dead breathe like the living, converting oxygen to carbondioxide? Presumably he found himself fully dressed as he stood beside his ownbody — if he had suddenly found himself naked, he would have noticed sooner thatsomething odd was going on. Does this mean that our clothes also survive death?The account sounds so disappointingly factual. If he had described a whirlpoolof coloured lights and a sensation like expanding like a ripple across thesurface of a pond, we might find it more convincing. This utterly commonplacedescription of trying to feel his own heartbeat and getting angry with hisfriends sounds like the invention of someone with a poor imagination.Against these objections, we must place the simple fact that there are so manyreports of the death experience that follow roughly the same pattern. Anyscientist would admit that this makes the evidence more convincing. If onesailor came back reporting that he had been shipwrecked on an island where thenatives had green hair and long tails, it would probably be safe to assumeeither that he was a liar or that he was suffering from delirium tremens. Ifhundreds of sailors report the same experience over many years, it would bedownright stupid not to give it careful consideration. There must be somethingbehind it, if only a conspiracy among the sailors. In the same way, when reportafter report of people in sudden danger contains the phrase ‘My whole lifeflashed in front of my eyes’, it looks probable that the brain has some curious‘rapid playback’ mechanism that is activated by the threat of death. Those whobelieve in an afterlife may speculate that the purpose of this mechanism is to‘remind’ the person of his identity, so that he does not enter the ‘next world’in a state of total confusion. Those who take a more sceptical view may regardit as a natural phenomenon, perhaps due to a flood of adrenalin, or to someelectrical discharge caused by emergency. But in view of the number of reportsof this sensation, the most indefensible attitude would be to dismiss it as anold wives’ tale.Does this mean that Bertrand Russell is wilfully blinding himself to the factswhen he says that ‘it is not rational arguments but emotions that cause beliefin a future life’? Not necessarily. We have to recognise that the world is fullof millions of facts, and that everyone has to choose which ones he findsinteresting. Even the greatest intellects can never hope to know more than atiny fraction of all the facts about the world we live in. Russell chose todevote his life to trying to establish the basic ‘facts’ about logic andmathematics; no one can blame him for not being curious about the existence ofan afterlife. And, in view of that lack of curiosity, it is also hard to blamehim for concluding that ‘when you’re dead you’re dead’.Where Russell does deserve a certain amount of criticism is in the shallownature of his assumptions about why people can believe in an afterlife. He takesit for granted that there is no solid scientific evidence for life after death,and that therefore it must be wishful thinking. To the objection that he hasfailed to consider the facts, he would probably reply that he doesn’t have thetime — but that if someone could present him with one solid, incontrovertiblefact to prove life after death, he might be ready to be convinced.The simple truth is that this is not the way we build up our convictions. I donot decide that a person is trustworthy because I have solid, incontrovertibleproof of it. I decide it on the basis of dozens of experiences of that person,which finally fit together like a mosaic, giving me an ‘overall’ picture of hischaracter. It could be compared to a newspaper photograph which, when looked atthrough a magnifying glass, turns into a series of black and grey dots. Nobodylooking at those individual dots could believe that they would really build upinto a recognisable face. The strange thing is that when we look at the pictureat a certain distance, the dots vanish, and we can not only see a recognisableface, but even the expression in the eyes. If we look at the same eyes throughthe magnifying glass, it is quite impossible to see how the dots create an‘expression’.All this applies particularly to the problems of the ‘paranormal’. I hadexperience of this a few years ago, when writing a book about the poltergeist —the ‘noisy ghost’ that has been recorded down the ages.* My ex-publisher calledon me one day and asked me what I was writing. I had just returned fromPontefract, where I had been investigating a case of apparent ‘haunting’ by ablack monk, and I began telling him about it. ‘Surely you don’t really believein all that stuff?’ He began to raise all the usual objections: inaccuratereporting, mischievous children, seismic disturbances, lying witnesses … Icountered each objection by describing some other case in which it could notpossibly apply, and he immediately thought up some new objections. After half anhour or so, I saw that nothing I could say would alter his mind. As far as hewas concerned, ghosts and poltergeists were a regrettable remnant of mediaevalsuperstition, and that was that. Every case I described to him was just anotherdot on the newspaper photograph. Looking at it through his magnifying glass, hecould not see that it proved anything. I had spent months studying hundreds ofcases, from ancient Rome to modern London, from mediaeval France to present-dayBrazil. I had come to recognise all the basic characteristics of thepoltergeist, and to see that they never seem to change. In short, they formed apattern. And unless my friend could be persuaded to spend a few weeks studyingthe same cases, he would continue to believe that each one could be explainedaway as fraud or deception. And if I had actually said that to him, he wouldhave felt that I was being patronising. He was convinced — quite correctly —that his powers of reasoning were as good as mine. What he could not see wasthat, if reason is to be effective, it has to operate on a broad range of facts.Without facts to work on, the most brilliant deductive mind in the world isspinning in a vacuum.This book is not an attempt to convince anyone of the reality of life afterdeath. It is simply an attempt to present the facts in an orderly manner. At theend, the reader should be in a position to make up his own mind.*Alan Vaughan: Patterns of Prophecy, 1973, p. 4.** Access to Inner Worlds: The Story of Brad Absetz, 1983.*In The Mysteries of Life and Death, no date.*Robert Crookall: What Happens When You Die, p. 63.*Poltergeist, A Study in Destructive Haunting, 1981."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOTHE WORLD OF THE CLAIRVOYANTWhen I open my eyes in the morning, I take it for granted that I am looking atthe same world that you see when you open your eyes. On the whole, this isprobably a fair assumption. But it can blind me to some important differencesbetween myself and my fellow human beings.When Charles Darwin arrived in Tierra del Fuego on the Beagle in December 1832,he was astounded that the natives were such excellent mimics. Although they knewno English, they could repeat a whole sentence with a good English accent.Moreover, they could join in sea shanties as they sat round the fire with thecrew of the Beagle, by the simple expedient of repeating each word a momentafter the English sailors had sung it. (Darwin said ‘the manner in which theywere invariably a little behindhand was quite ludicrous’.) Darwin was baffled.‘How can this faculty be explained?’ he asked. ‘Is it a consequence of the morepractised habits of perception and keener senses, common to all men in a savagestate, as compared with those long civilised?’He is on the right track; but his essentially English habits of thought make himincapable of going to the heart of the matter. But a later zoologist, LyallWatson, understood it:A pygmy from the dense forests of the Ituri, where it is never possible to seevery far, is astonished by the tiny antelope he sees in the distance when takenout on to the plain for the first time. In the perpetual gloom of the forestfloor, sound is more important than sight, and the pygmy’s experience isarranged in a different kind of sense life. His is a separate reality.In other words, the pygmy’s culture is auditory, not visual. In our culture,sight is more important than sound; a city dweller hardly notices the continuousflood of sound that batters his ears, but he has to notice buses and carsbecause they may run him down. The primitive has to pay the same attention tosounds, because they may indicate the presence of a dangerous wild animal or anenemy. If Darwin could have got inside the head of a Tierra del Fuegan, he wouldprobably have felt as confused as if he was looking through the eyes of aMartian.The psychologist William James made the same point in his important essay ‘On aCertain Blindness in Human Beings’. He showed that we tend to be blind to thingsthat do not interest us; they are simply ‘not there’. And since each of us isinterested in different things, each sees a different world. A man sitting on abus or tube thinks he is surrounded by other members of the same species; infact, he is among troglodytes, Martians, Venusians, Tierra del Fuegans,Patagonians and a dozen other outlandish tribes.Among civilised human beings, there is a species whose outlook is as strange and‘different’ as that of a Tierra del Fuegan. They are called psychics orclairvoyants, and they are far more common than the rest of us realise. Yet whena psychic describes an experience that he or she takes for granted, it maystrike the rest of us as either slightly insane or some kind of sillyaffectation. Here is a description of such an experience:Soon after our arrival at Okehampton my husband and I went out to catch thetail-end of the sunset. It was one of those evenings when the whole world holdsits breath. The moor towered in shadowed contours between us and the sinkingsun, and above it the western sky was green and gold like glacier water.Suddenly, without warning, the incredible beauty swept me through a barrier. Iwas no longer looking at Nature. Nature was looking at me. And she did not likewhat she saw. It was a strange and humbling sensation, as if numberlessunoffending creatures were shrinking back offended by our invasion, and itstruck me like a blow that even the windswept little tree against the skylineseemed to be leaning away from us in disgust. ‘What shall we do?’ I whispered tomy husband. ‘They loathe us. We can’t gatecrash like this.’He did not laugh at me. He, too, felt an intruder. So I said, should we standquite still and explain mentally that we came as friends, with humility, andwould be grateful for permission to walk quietly on the moor? I thought, too, ofthe old days when simple souls linked themselves to wild nature by the ancientmagic of oak and ash and thorn.Writing as experient, not as investigator, there is, thank goodness, no need toinvoke sophisticated explanation like autosuggestion for the stonishingexperience that followed this gesture of apology. It was as if, like a wheelingflight of dunlin, all those visible and invisible creatures swung round as aunit to inspect us, and I seemed to feel their sigh of relief as they came to agroup decision. We were not dangerous or cruel. Our apology was accepted. Wemight come on — and ‘in’. At the time I did not even think it odd that thelittle windswept tree was now leaning towards us in a friendly fashion.That experience had an unexpected aftermath. A couple of mornings later I wasalone by a window facing the moor, writing letters and thinking of nothing lessthan its invisible inhabitants. Then I, too, suffered an invasion, a delightfulone. It was as if, like ebullient children, a covey of little invisibles floatedin at the window to say ‘Hullo!’ and coax me to play with them. For a momenttheir visit seemed perfectly normal, but then my analytical mind got going, andat once, for me, they ceased to exist. And now I have no idea at all whether ornot I had been conversing with ‘things that really are’ …If this account conveys the impression that its author is some slightly dotty‘psychic’, like Noel Coward’s Madame Arcati (as played by Margaret Rutherford),then it is thoroughly misleading. The author, Rosalind Heywood, was a lifelongmember of the Society for Psychical Research, a lady of formidable intellect,whose standards of investigation were as rigorous as those of the mostthoroughgoing sceptic. In fact, her attitude towards her own experiences iscuriously mistrustful and suspicious. When writing about matters of psychicalresearch — as in her book The Sixth Sense — she maintains an attitude of logicaldetachment that makes her sound rather like Bertrand Russell. But in herautobiography The Infinite Hive, she adopts a more personal tone to describe herown experiences, and the result is one of the most convincing of all insightsinto the strange, Tierra del Fuegan world of a clairvoyant.It is worth noting her comment: ‘… then my analytical mind got going, and atonce, for me, they ceased to exist’. Clearly, we are talking about thedifference between analysis and intuition — that is, between the left brain andthe right. This, in turn, suggests that the ‘psychic’ is closely related to anartist like Mozart, into whose head tunes kept walking unannounced. (Thecomposer Saint-Saens also said that in order to compose he merely had tolisten.) Civilised man (and woman) has developed the left brain until itcompletely dominates and overawes the right. A ‘psychic’ like Rosalind Heywoodis probably closer to our ancestors of ten thousand years ago (or, if JulianJaynes is correct, much more recently than that).It is worth looking more closely into the development of Rosalind Heywood’spsychic abilities, because it enables us to see that she is not really so verydifferent from the rest of us, and that therefore the same faculty must lielatent in all of us.Born into a fairly typical late-Victorian household, she does not seem to havesuspected that she was ‘psychic’ until she was nearing adulthood. Before that,she seems to have assumed that it was simply imagination. She writes:It was soon after our return from India — I was just thirteen — that I realisedthat in some intangible way I was at times aware of lesser presences in certainplaces. Some were grim and sad, and I felt that if only I could see them theywould be less unnerving. One was in my bedroom in my grandfather’s house whichoverlooked Dartmoor. By day it was a gay little room, facing south, with awallpaper festooned with blue ribbons and pink roses. But at night it was a verydifferent place. Then a mysterious invisible Somebody shared it with me — and Ididn’t know who that Somebody was … Had the Somebody been mentionable to agrown-up I might have learnt that my mother and aunt had both independently seenthe apparition of an old woman standing at the foot of the bed …Any developing recognition of her psychic abilities was halted abruptly when, atthe age of seventeen, she bought at a station bookstall a copy of The Riddle ofthe Universe by Ernst Haeckel. Haeckel was a materialist philosopher, and TheRiddle of the Universe is a brilliantly lucid account of the discoveries ofmodern science that became an immediate bestseller in the early years of thetwentieth century. He studies the evolution of the body, the evolution of themind, the evolution of the universe, in the light of modern biology andastronomy, and claims to prove that there is no such thing as a personal God,that free will is an illusion, and that life after death is the grossest kind ofsuperstition.Rosalind Heywood was shattered:My poor mother! No bomb could have smashed more effectively the framework onwhich she had so carefully moulded her daughter’s life. Here at last was thetruth. There was no God. Beauty was a snare and a delusion, which merely servedto conceal that the universe was a soulless mechanism, clanking round and roundforever and ever to no purpose at all. That night I stared at the stars from mybedroom window and could almost hear their rusty gear wheels clanking. Gone wasany hope of finding that Central Something, and — my all-wise parents lived in afool’s paradise.Soon after this, the 1914 war began, and Rosalind Heywood became a nurse. Herfirst suspicion of extra-sensory perception came when she was sitting in theroom of an unconscious woman, reading The Brothers Karamazov. As she read thesection in which Ivan has a discussion with the Devil, the sick woman sat up,pointed her finger at the foot of the bed, and proceeded to talk to the Devil.It could have been coincidence, but it seemed oddly like telepathy.A few weeks later, she sat watching a man who was gravely ill and delirious. Heseemed to be unaware of her presence. Suddenly she experienced a kind of inner‘Order’: ‘Think him quiet.’ Recalling the previous experience of ‘telepathy’,she decided to give it a try. At once, the man fell into a peaceful sleep. When,later, a Staff Nurse woke him up by moving the screens, she ‘thought’ him asleepagain. But when the Ward Sister had awakened him for the third time, it nolonger worked:Then, suddenly, the tossing and delirium ceased, he looked at me with quiet,rational eyes — he was obviously an educated man — and said calmly, ‘It’s no useconcentrating any longer, Nurse. I shall not be going to sleep again.’ Then therational man vanished and the agonising delirium began once more. If this is howdeath comes, I thought, it is even more terrible than I had imagined. Butsuddenly his face lit up. ‘It’s Annie!’ he cried, gazing in joyous recognitionat someone I could not see. ‘And John!… Oh, the Light!… The Light!…What Rosalind Heywood has recorded here is, in fact, an extremely commondeath-bed experience; in 1960, Dr Karlis Osis, of the New York ParapsychologyFoundation, sent out ten thousand questionnaires to nurses, asking about theirdeath-bed visions, and discovered that in a large number of cases, the dyingbelieved they saw a deceased relative on the point of death. Sir WilliamBarrett, the founder of the Society for Psychical Research, had already made thesame discovery when he was gathering material for his own book Death-bedVisions.Oddly enough, this experience did nothing to shake the scepticism RosalindHeywood had imbibed from Haeckel’s Riddle of the Universe. Neither did a greatmany experiences of ‘Orders’, which led her to take a number of apparentlyirrational decisions. When a soldier was dying of blackwater fever, and had beengiven up for lost by the doctors, ‘Orders’ told her to ask him what he wouldlike most in all the world. He replied: ‘A red rose, Sister.’ She heard herselfpromise him one for the next day. It seemed a mad thing to do in a hospital inMacedonia. But the next day she asked the dispatch rider to take a message toGHQ asking for a red rose; back came a whole bunch of them from the garden of aGreek magnate. The dying soldier recovered. When badly wounded men were unableto sleep, ‘Orders’ told her to make her own sedative and to make it as nasty aspossible; she made a random mixture of medicines and added a teaspoonful of saltfor good measure. It worked perfectly; after that, the men had no problemsleeping. When a drug addict was refusing to take nourishment, ‘Orders’ toldher: ‘Nag him! Nag! NAG!’ It was entirely contrary to her instinct, but sheobeyed; finally, he groaned: ‘I’ll eat anything if you’ll only go away’, and wassoon eating normally again.Most of these examples could, of course, be explained in terms of thesubconscious mind. But there are others in her book that are harder to explain.She tells how, about to shut up her house for a month to go away for a midsummerholiday, ‘Orders’ told her that the water must be turned off at the main becausea pipe was going to burst. When she mentioned this to her husband, he told herall the technical reasons why pipes do not burst in midsummer. Rather thanoverride his objection, she decided to give a spare key to the builder for usewhen the pipe burst. He also explained why pipes did not burst in July. In duecourse, the pipe burst and the builder was able to use the key to repair it.Here it is altogether more difficult to explain ‘Orders’ in terms ofsubconscious insight, particularly in view of her insistence that all suchmatters as plumbing are a mystery to her.Other examples in The Infinite Hive make it seem highly probable that she wasexercising a faculty of ‘precognition’, the ability to foresee the future. Thisis quite clearly a faculty that simply should not exist. For most otherso-called psychic faculties — telepathy, clairvoyance, mediumship, psychokinesis— we can advance more-or-less scientific explanations. But for foreknowledge ofthe future there is no possible explanation; it is simply non-logical and absurd— in short, an impossibility, since the future has not yet arrived. Yet RosalindHeywood’s book has several examples of foreknowledge of the future, and most ofthem defy all rational explanation. She tells, for example, of how her husbandmet an inventor who seemed incapable of marketing his invention; her husband,who was involved in that line of business, offered to do it for him. When hetold her about it, she thought it an excellent idea — until her husbandmentioned the man’s name. Then she experienced ‘a wave of dread and repulsion’.‘Don’t, don’t have anything to do with that man.’ Her husband insisted that itwas too late to back out of the deal. He went ahead — and in due course, the manswindled them, was arrested, and committed suicide when on bail.Her own explanation is that her husband was subconsciously aware that the manwas a crook, and that she picked this up telepathically. But since she givesmany examples demonstrating her husband’s psychic abilities, it seems odd thathe should dismiss her pleas, and insist on entering into a business partnershipwith a swindler.She cites the following example of her husband’s psychic faculty:A big limousine ran into our small sports car and forced it on to the pavementup against a lamp post. ‘It’s all right,’ he said placidly, ‘I dreamt this lastnight. I know what’s wrong. I only have to change the wheel.’ He got out,looked, said, ‘It’s as I thought’, and changed the wheel.The commonsense explanation here is coincidence. But this cannot be applied tothe examples she cites of the same ability in her younger son. When he came fromEngland to America to join his parents for the summer holidays, he told her thathe already knew the village they were in because he had dreamt it. ‘If you do,’said his mother, ‘lead us down to the sea.’ He led them down to the beach, thenthreaded his way among hundreds of sun umbrellas to the one they owned. ‘How didyou know this was ours?’ she asked. ‘I dreamt the pattern on it.’Rosalind Heywood agrees that this might have been telepathy. But what of thefollowing episode:One day … I saw my younger son look up the name of a street in the map of Londonbecause, so he told me later, he had ‘known’ that when he went out someone wasgoing to ask him where it was and he did not know. This happened as he hadforeseen within an hour.Here, if we rule out the very far-fetched explanation of coincidence, or somecomplex telepathy with a total stranger, the only other explanation seems to bethat in some odd sense, the event her son ‘precognised’ had already taken place,and he was somehow receiving a ‘memory of the future’. In that case, theexplanation of her sudden foreboding when her husband mentioned the name of theswindler was that she somehow ‘recognised’ it as that of a man who had alreadyswindled them. Obviously, this totally contradicts our notion of time assomething that flows only one way. But then, the experiences of psychics oftenseem to contradict our orderly notions of space as well. One of the basic lawsof our world is that no one can be in two different places at the same time.Rosalind Heywood was also able to contradict this from personal experience:One hot night my husband was peacefully sleeping while I wriggled, restless andwide awake, at his side in the great carved bed. At last the excessive peacebecame unbearable. ‘I can’t stand it,’ I thought, ‘I shall wake him up to makelove to me.’Before I could carry out this egoistic idea I did something very odd — I splitin two. One Me in its pink nightie continued to toss self-centredly against theembroidered pillows, but another, clad in a long, very white, hooded garment,was now standing, calm, immobile and impersonally outward-looking, at the footof the bed. This White Me seemed just as actual as Pink Me and I was equallyconscious in both places at the same time. I vividly remember myself as White Melooking down and observing the carved end of the bed in front of me and alsothinking what a silly fool Pink Me looked, tossing in that petulant way againstthe pillows. ‘You’re behaving disgracefully’, said White Me to Pink Me with coldcontempt. ‘Don’t be so selfish, you know he’s dog-tired.’Pink Me was a totally self-regarding little animal, entirely composed of‘appetites’, and she cared not at all whether her unfortunate husband was tiredor not. ‘I shall do what I like,’ she retorted furiously, ‘and you can’t stopme, you pious white prig!’ She was particularly furious because she knew verywell that White Me was the stronger and could stop her.A moment or two later — I felt no transition — White Me was once more imprisonedwith Pink Me in one body, and there they have dwelt as oil and water ever since.It is only quite lately that I have become aware, though I seldom remember it,that I can deliberately identify myself with White Me and watch without feelingthem — that is the point — the desires and repulsions that must inevitably tossall Pink Mes around.And in case the reader assumes this experience to be symbolic rather than real,she goes on to cite a case of a woman who had ‘split’ after the birth of a baby.One of her continued to lie in the bed while the other stood by its side. Whenquestioned about the attitude of these two ‘selves’ to one another, she replied:‘The Me outside looked on the Me in bed with profound contempt devoid of allfeeling.’Experiences like these did nothing to shake Rosalind Heywood’s basicagnosticism, imbibed from Haeckel; in a sense, there is no reason why theyshould. The existence of telepathy and clairvoyance is not in itself acontradiction of the ‘materialist’ viewpoint. Even experiences of precognitionconstitute no challenge to materialism. It may prove that our view of time as aone-way street is somehow mistaken; but the truth about time may be as logicaland scientific as our present notions about it.What finally undermined Rosalind Heywood’s agnosticism were two experiences ofapparent contact with the dead. The first took place in Washington DC in the1930s. Rosalind Heywood’s husband Frank was in the diplomatic service there. Atparties they often met an attractive woman called Julia. One day, she suddenlyasked Rosalind Heywood to read her hands — she dabbled in palmistry. As she tookJulia’s hands, she found herself saying gravely: ‘You will never find what youare looking for in this world, will you?’ She replied, just as gravely: ‘No.’Some weeks later, Julia presented Rosalind Heywood with a snapshot of herself;she was just about to set out for a trip to Peru. ‘Orders’ told Rosalind Heywoodthat this was important; she accepted the photograph. On the journey to Peru,the plane crashed in the Andes and there were no survivors.She found that Julia’s name was stuck in her head, being repeated over and overagain. Two days later, she wrote a letter of condolence to Julia’s mother, thenlay down on a settee to rest. A Viennese woodcut suddenly fell off the wall onto the floor. The woodcut was undamaged; its cord was intact; so was the nail onthe wall. ‘I was standing by my desk trying to puzzle out this conundrum when myeye caught the letter to Julia’s mother, and at that moment I heard Julia speak.She spoke in no uncertain terms. ‘Don’t send that silly letter’, she said. ‘Goto my mother now, straightaway, and tell her to stop all this ridiculousmourning at once. I’m very happy and I can’t stand it’She experienced an understandable hesitancy; if, as the wife of a Britishdiplomat, she went around delivering messages from the dead, she might get areputation for eccentricity. ‘The more I hesitated, the more insistent “Julia”became …’ At last:feeling indeed every kind of fool, I got out my car and went. What made thesituation yet more embarrassing was that at the time I knew nothing of theconventions of Americans from the Southern States in the face of death, andignorantly assumed that Julia’s mother would behave like mine in similarcircumstances, wear her ordinary clothes, and hide her grief under a mask offrozen normality. If this were so, to barge in and ask her to stop an excessivedisplay of mourning seemed both pointless and rude. However, on arrival at herhouse, I found all the blinds down and in the hall a covey of melancholy women,talking in whispers and looking like crows. ‘May I see Mrs Howard?’ I askedthem.They looked shocked. ‘Certainly not’, they said. ‘She’s in bed mourning.’That settled it. ‘I must see her’, I insisted, and after much protest they tookme up to her room. There, indeed, was the poor woman, alone, in the dark, inbed. Intensely embarrassed, for I supposed this was by her own choice, I got outmy message, expecting to be thrown out as mad or impertinent. But her face litup. ‘I knew it,’ she cried, ‘I knew she’d hate it, and I didn’t want it. I shallget up and stop it at once!’On me the effect of her response was curious. From that moment all sense ofJulia’s presence vanished; it was as if, content, she had gone off at once onher own affairs, and from then on I thought no more of her than was normal.Rosalind Heywood’s second experience of ‘contact with the dead’ occurred sometwenty years later, in London. An old friend, Vivian Usborne, had died after along illness. Towards the end, he expressed a certain amount of bitterness atthe idea that death snuffs out man like a candle and leaves nothing behind.About ten days later I went early one morning to get a painting by him which hadbeen given to me. It is perhaps relevant that I was hastening to anotherappointment in which I was emotionally involved and felt no nostalgic longingfor Vivian. As I hurried into his room to fetch the picture I was shocked by asickening blast of what I have come to call the smell of death. I am never quitesure whether this is physical or what a sensitive would call borderline — thoughhe would be hard put to tell an investigator what he meant by that. Then, instaggering contrast … I ran slap into ‘Vivian’ himself, most joyfully and mostvividly alive. I pulled up sharply as one would on running into a friend in thestreet, and then came an experience which is extremely hard to describe withoutsounding either flat and meaningless or over-dramatic. As with ‘Julia’, I felt‘Vivian’ communicate inside my mind, and I shut my eyes and stood very still toattend better. He conveyed in some fashion so intimate that the best word seemsto be communion, pretentious though that sounds, that he had been entirelymistaken in expecting extinction at death. On the contrary, he now had scope,freedom and opportunity beyond his wildest dreams. The emphasis was not merelyon being alive but on this magnificent expansion of opportunity …For a few moments I stood very still, acutely aware of the striking contrastbetween the smell of death and ‘Vivian’ ’s intensity of life — it was as if theywere in a different order of things — and then I remembered my duty and ‘said’to him, ‘This is wonderful, but you’ve given me no evidence. What can I say tothe SPR?’(I hope that my attempt to describe the immediacy of the purported Julia’scommunication with me will have made it clear that ‘said’ is far too remote aword to use for this intimate kind of united awareness. It feels, as GilbertMurray said of his own telepathic experience, like a kind of co-sensitivity.)‘Vivian’ ’s response to my question was emphatic and immediate. ‘I cannot giveyou evidence. You have no concepts for these conditions. I can only give youpoetic images.’At that, far, far above me, I saw — with the inner eye — an immense pair ofwhite wings flying in a limitless blue sky. Though at first an image of suchVictorian obviousness seems absurd, it was in fact an entirely apt expression ofthe scope, opportunity and freedom into which for a few moments I felt caughtup. But it was only for a few moments. I quickly became aware that I could nothold the absorbed state which contact with ‘Vivian’ demanded, and very soon hadto say reluctantly, ‘Goodbye, I must drop now.’Then I dropped — down to the empty room and the smell of death.She goes on to add that she has had several other experiences of contact withthe dead, but that they were more fleeting than the contacts with ‘Julia’ and‘Vivian’, and that it would be monotonous to describe them. She adds:They all had one of two things in common, either a sense of contemporary purposeon the part of the dead, or an urge to action on my part, and in this theydiffered from my experience of the phenomenon known as haunting, in which,whatever causes it, the sense of urgency is usually lacking.In other words, these experiences of contact with the recently dead were due toa desire on the part of the deceased to ‘get in touch’. Rosalind Heywood merelyhappened to be ‘open’ enough for them to communicate.I have considered her experiences at some length because it is important torealise that the experiences of a clairvoyant are not a series of weidoccurrences that interrupt the normal flow of everyday life, but a part of itspattern, its fundamental texture. In fact, as a ‘psychic’, Rosalind Heywood isnot particularly gifted. On the scale of a Daniel Dunglas Home or EusapiaPalladino — or even of a Gerard Croiset or Robert Cracknell — she hardly ratesat all. She could be described as ‘mildly psychic’, which is why she forms suchan excellent subject for study. She is an ordinary housewife, a typicalupper-middle-class Edwardian lady who shares most of the values of her class,and thinks that being psychic is slightly discreditable. This is why she isalways looking for other explanations for her experiences — so that, forexample, when she feels foreboding at hearing the name of the swindler, she isinclined to wonder if it is some form of telepathy with her husband. She evenwonders whether, as primitives believe, the name itself could have linked herwith the swindler telepathically — then has to regretfully admit that this isimpossible because it was an assumed name. She is unwilling to accept theobvious — if equally baffling — explanation that she recognised the swindler’sname because, in some sense, the fraud had ‘already happened’. That is to say,her experience was an example of what Professor Joad once called ‘the undoubtedqueerness of time’. And in spite of her own abundant experience of‘clairvoyance’, Rosalind Heywood was the sort of person who was unwilling tobelieve in the ‘undoubted queerness’ of anything. She had a strong Victorianprejudice in favour of order and tidiness.There is, of course, one other possible explanation of her ‘precognition’ —which she is equally unwilling to entertain: that the information came to herfrom a ‘spirit’. Yet she has just told an anecdote that brings her face to facewith that possibility. In the early days of the Second World War, she triedusing an ouija board, consisting of a pointer, on which the operator rested hisfingers, and a semicircle of cards containing letters of the alphabet. When adoctor friend asked her to demonstrate the board, she decided to rule out thepossibility that her unconscious mind was dictating the message by sitting onthe floor under the table, with her fingers resting on the pointer above herhead. The doctor noted down the message, and told her that someone called Georgehad warned Frank to drive with exaggerated care for the next two days. Frank wasRosalind Heywood’s husband, and his brother George had been killed not longbefore. The doctor was not even aware that Frank was his hostess’s husband. Atthis time, she explains, she was extremely sceptical about the possibility oflife after death (in spite of the experience in Washington with ‘Julia’ —another example of her reluctance to join the ranks of the ‘believers’), and wasinclined to wonder if her own unconscious mind was pulling her leg. Withconsiderable embarrassment, she passed on the message to her husband. The nextday he told her: ‘If I hadn’t driven with extreme care, as you asked me to, Ishould have had no less than three major accidents today.’But then, although the ‘spirit’ explanation might provide an acceptablealternative to precognition in the case of the swindler — presumably a friendlyspirit would know he was a swindler — it still fails to explain how brotherGeorge knew in advance that Frank was in danger of having three car accidentsduring the next forty-eight hours. Here, as in the case of her youngest son’sforeknowledge that someone was going to ask him to find a certain street, wehave to fall back on Joad’s ‘undoubted queerness of time’.Is it possible, considering Rosalind Heywood’s experience as a whole, to discernsome pattern that might help to provide a basic explanation?She herself provides one interesting clue. She seems to have had an unusualsusceptibility to beauty. As a child, she spent some time in India. Shedescribes her father pointing up to the snow on the mountain tops:‘Look, children, there are the Snows.’For a long time we could not see them. We had not looked high enough. Then atlast, towering against the cobalt sky, we saw Kanchenjunga, white, shining,inviolate, all but the highest mountain in the world. I could not — and cannot —formulate what moved me almost beyond bearing in the Hills. It was as if somewind of the spirit blew down on the childish creature and touched something init awake, so that it could never be quite childish again …Back at home in England, she often cried when remembering the Hills. Yearslater, at a dinner party, she sat next to a Tibetan explorer, and tried to tellhim something of what the Hills had meant to her. ‘After a pause he said the twowords that of all others I would have chosen to hear. They were “Thosepresences”.’It was after her return from India that she first became aware of ‘lesserpresences’, like the old woman in the bedroom of her grandfather’s house.She describes a number of these experiences of beauty, and their obvioussincerity robs them of any suggestion of ‘aestheticism’ — how, for example,after a fine rendering of Chopin’s A flat Ballade, she experienced a kind ofhallucination of ‘a vast marble hall, oblong, with painted walls and the wholeof the east end open to the night sky and the stars’. She also mentions that avery gentle touch on her back — by her husband — brought her back to earth asviolently as if she had been kicked.Her experiences bring to mind an event in the childhood of the modern Hindusaint Ramakrishna. One day, as a child, Ramakrishna was crossing a paddy fieldholding a large bowl of rice; when a flock of white cranes flew across a blackstorm-cloud, the sense of beauty was so overwhelming that he fainted, and therice flew all over the place. Later in life, Ramakrishna became subject to moodsof ‘God-intoxication’ — ‘samadhi’ — in which he was overwhelmed by ecstary, andwould lose consciousness.The obvious comment to make about such an experience is that it would be highlyinconvenient if it happened in the middle of Piccadilly Circus. We are back toJulian Jaynes’s theory about the ‘bicameral mind’. Jaynes believes thatcivilised man had to cease being ‘bicameral’ — hearing the voices of the gods —when life became so dangerous and complicated that his chief concern was to keephis wits about him. Jaynes suggests that this happened as recently as 1200 BC,after a series of catastrophes in the Mediterranean world — such as theexplosion of the volcano of Santorini, which practically destroyed Greekcivilisation, and the invasion of the destructive barbarians known as the SeaPeoples. There certainly seems to be a certain amount of evidence for Jaynes’sbelief that it was only after this period that cruelty appeared for the firsttime in human history.*Even if we find it impossible to swallow Jaynes’s belief that the men who builtStonehenge and the Great Pyramid totally lacked what we would call‘self-consciousness’, it seems clear that he is correct in believing that, atsome point in the history of civilisation, man was forced to become a‘left-brainer’ — that is, to deliberately abandon the warmer, gentlerconsciousness of the animal and the child, and develop a ruthless ‘eye tobusiness’. We might say that ancient man looked at the universe through a kindof telescope, which showed him distant horizons. Then the increasing problems ofsurvival forced him to develop an instrument much more like a microscope or awatchmaker’s eyeglass, which would enable him to concentrate on tinyparticulars. The result is that he has become shortsighted. He has ceased to beaware of the horizons.In fact, he is still capable of this wider awareness — but only in certainmoments of deep relaxation. When this happens, the left and right halves of thebrain seem to merge together, and he experiences a sense of peace and serenity,the ‘all is well’ feeling. But modern man has to start from left-brain awareness— our narrow ego-consciousness. Our remote ancestors could probably plungestraight into ‘cosmic consciousness’ by merely relaxing.As a result of these evolutionary developments, modern man has a high ‘beautythreshold’. ‘Threshold’ is a psychological term, meaning how much stimulus ittakes to arouse someone to awareness. A man with a high noise threshold canignore a racket that would drive a more sensitive person mad. A man with a highpain threshold can have his teeth filled without local anaesthetic.Ramakrishna’s low beauty threshold meant that any kind of beauty was likely toplunge him into a trance of ecstasy. And to a modern city dweller, this would beas undesirable as permanent diarrhoea.Now Rosalind Heywood was very much a product of British civilisation: stiffupper lip, dislike of emotion, cast-iron self-control. Such characteristicsusually entail a high beauty threshold — the English take a pride in beingartistically insensitive. In her case, we can see that this was not so, and thatshe associated her first psychic experiences with the ‘wind of the spirit’ that‘blew down on the childish creature’ from Kanchenjunga, and ‘touched somethingin it awake’.It may also be significant that when her husband gently touched her back — afterhearing the Chopin Ballade — she experienced a shock out of all proportion tothe stimulus. Most people have probably noticed the same thing if they areawakened on the verge of sleep. In that ‘midway’ state between sleep and waking— the state in which we begin to experience hypnogogic hallucinations — theslightest sound — the mere click of a door closing — produces a pattern of lightinside the brain, and a sensation like an explosion. Rosalind Heywood alsodescribes how she tried one morning to practise a little mind-reading, byfloating into a state of deep relaxation and trying to contact the mind ofanother person in the house. She describes the sensation as ‘a glorified versionof a phase of going under an anaesthetic’. Then the peace was shattered by‘agonising thunderous bangs which crashed right through me’. The bangscontinued, and she felt herself returning to physical awareness. It was herhusband tapping on the door to say that breakfast was ready. When she askedindignantly why he was battering the house down, he answered that he had onlytapped gently. With her lowered sensitivity threshold, she had heard each tap asan explosion like a bomb. She goes on to speculate whether this is why it is sodangerous to ‘awaken’ a medium from a state of trance — it has been known tocause heart failure.After his first experience of ‘samadhi’ or ‘God-ecstasy’, Ramakrishna couldinduce the state at will; he merely had to hear the name of Krishna or Kali tosink into the ‘God-trance’. We can observe something analogous if we reactdeeply to a certain piece of music; the first notes of the Liebestod fromTristan or the opening notes of a Bruckner symphony can induce a tinglingsensation in the scalp, followed by a sudden flood of delight. Physiologicallyspeaking, it is merely a habit pattern, like a Pavlov dog salivating at thesound of a bell. What is interesting is that once the brain has learned the‘trick’ — the route to ecstasy, so to speak — it can repeat it at will. Itentails a certain act of will — a deliberate focusing on the source of pleasure.If you listen to the music while reading a newspaper or thinking of somethingelse, it doesn’t work, or is appreciably less powerful. But when the brain andthe stimulus cooperate, there is instant relaxation, followed by contact withthe inner source of pleasure.What is beginning to emerge, then, is a theory about ‘psychic’ sensitivity. Itruns as follows. When I relax deeply, it is as if someone opened up thepartition between the two compartments of my brain, turning them into a singlelarge room. I experience a sense of mental freedom, as if I can suddenly breathemore deeply, and a feeling of contact with things. Everyone has had theexperience of being in a state of hurry or excitement, and failing to noticethat they have bruised or scratched themselves — until the excitement evaporatesand the pain makes itself felt. Hurry and tension raise our sensitivitythreshold, and at the same time, erect a glass wall between us and reality. Inthe ‘unicameral’ state, this wall vanishes, and everything seems more real.No doubt dogs and cats are in this state most of the time; they lack anysustained power of concentration. And it seems highly probable that our cave-manancestors of forty thousand years ago also spent much of their time in thisstate. When drawings of animals were discovered in the caves of Cro-Magnon man,scientists concluded that our ancestors whiled away their winter evenings with alump of charcoal and a pot of red ochre. Then it gradually became clear thatthis was not an early example of ‘art for art’s sake’. It was art for the sakeof magic. It was the shaman who drew the bison and reindeer, because the menwere going out to hunt them the next day; the drawings were supposed to link theminds of the hunters and their prey. To us, with our abnormally high sensitivitythresholds, such an idea seems absurd; to primitives, it must have been a matterof commonsense, like dowsing for water. Moreover, there is evidence that such‘magic’ worked; Sir Arthur Grimble, who was commissioner of the Gilbert Islands,has described how the hereditary porpoise-caller established a mental link withthe porpoises, so that they swam into the beach in a kind of trance, and thenatives were able to wade into the water and club them to death.* And ManuelCordova-Rios, a Peruvian who was kidnapped by Amazonian Indians in 1902, and whospent several years living among them, has descriptions of hunting magic thatmakes it clear that it actually worked.**As man developed the complexities of civilisation, he had to develop acomplexity of mind to go with it. The unicameral mind was lost, and replaced bythe present version with two compartments — in which the living-room is situatedto the left. Yet it would be incorrect to believe that it is lost beyond recall.We can, if we want to, deliberately lower the ‘sensitivity threshold’. The tigerhunter Jim Corbett, author of Man Eaters of Kumaon, has described how hedeveloped what he called ‘jungle sensitiveness’, so that he knew intuitivelywhen a tiger was lying in wait for him. (Presumably he would also be able to usethe same faculty when he was hunting tigers.) Self-preservation had taught himto drop his sensitivity threshold, so his right brain would give him warning ofdanger. And we have seen that Rosalind Heywood apparently developed the samefaculty accidentally through her sensitivity to the ‘presence’ of the Hills. Shealso suggests that she developed her telepathic linkage with her husband becausehe was a non-verbal type, a man of a few words, and she had a ‘life-longexaggerated need for communication’.The most peculiar chapter of her book The Infinite Hive — called ‘The Singing’ —provides interesting support for this ‘primitive’, right-brain theory of psychicpowers. The ‘Singing’ is a sensation that she hears more-or-less all the time(although more at some times than others), and she describes it as:a kind of continuous vibrant inner quasi-sound, to which the nearest analogy isthe noise induced by pressing a seashell against the ear, or perhaps the hum ofa distant dynamo.… This sounds like tinnitus to anyone else, but to theexperient it does not appear to be heard by the ear or to be exactly located.Rather, like light, it pervades the whole atmosphere, though it is most clearlyperceptible in a wide arc above and behind the head. And — I cannot explain whatI mean by this — it does not appear to ring through outer space, yet neither isit far ‘in’. The right word may be borderline, if, as I most imprudently ventureto suspect, there is no sharp barrier between sensory and extra-sensoryphenomena.It sounds rather like the noise that — according to the composer John Cage — ismade by the nervous system, and which can be heard under conditions of totalsensory deprivation, for example, in a deep mine. But in that case, it wouldalways be more or less the same. Rosalind Heywood claims that it varies. Theonly time she failed to hear it under conditions of silence was while waitingfor a train at night on the Hampstead tube station (which is one of the deepestin London, and where, if the nerve theory is correct, it ought to have beenparticularly evident). But:it is far more evident in some places than in others; particularly so in a quietwood, for instance, or on a moor or a mountain — clean wild places unspoilt byman. It is also clear in, say, a church or a college library, places wherethought or devotion have been intense for years; and it can ring out in anordinary room where concentrated thought has been going on.She adds: ‘Although the Singing seems to differ according to its apparent originI cannot formulate in what this difference lies. I can only say that mountainSinging conveys a different “atmosphere” from church Singing, as an oboe conveysa different “atmosphere” from a trumpet …’ She goes on to speak about ‘churchSinging’. ‘I listened for the Christian note in several quiet empty churches andfound that in some it would pass over into a more intense experience, as if — Irepeat as if — an inner force were streaming from the altar.’A young engineer to whom she described the Singing — in the hope of shocking him— replied placidly: ‘Oh, yes, I hear that too, in places where there have beenstrong emotions.’ This comment provides an interesting clue. As early as 1908,Sir Oliver Lodge, one of the most distinguished members of the Society forPsychical Research, made the interesting suggestion that ‘ghosts’ may be a kindof tape recording — ‘as if strong emotions could be unconsciously recorded inmatter’:Take, for example, a haunted house … wherein some one room is the scene of aghostly representation of some long past tragedy. On a psychometric hypothesis*the original tragedy has been literally photographed on its materialsurroundings, nay, even on the ether itself, by reason of the intensity ofemotion felt by those who enacted it; and thenceforth in certain persons anhallucinatory effect is experienced corresponding to such an impression. It isthis theory that is made to account for the feeling one has on entering certainrooms, that there is an alien presence therein …**The phrase ‘nay, even on the ether itself’ may seem to be going too far; yet inthe second half of the twentieth century this has, in fact, been one of the mostwidely held theories about the nature of apparitions. The late T.C. Lethbridge,whose contribution I have discussed at length elsewhere,*** came to believe thata type of manifestation he called a ‘ghoul’ — meaning the kind of ‘creepy’sensation described by Lodge — is an emotion ‘tape recorded’ on some kind ofelectrical field. He even became convinced that there are different types offield connected with woodlands, mountains and open spaces, exactly as RosalindHeywood noted about the Singing. According to Lethbridge, she would simply be‘picking up’ some form of electrical vibration — a vibration, presumably, thatcannot penetrate as deep as the Hampstead underground, or which is somehowinsulated by it.If there is anything in this theory, and feelings or mental states can berecorded on matter (or its field), this would also explain why she observed aquite different kind of Singing in university libraries or in Christianchurches; the ‘vibration’ would be different. It is particularly interestingthat she noted an ‘inner force’ streaming from church altars. Christian churchesare frequently built on pagan sites; in fact, there was a directive from theVatican in the Middle Ages that churches should be built on such sites. Anydowser will verify that the ‘field’ around ancient sites — for example, standingstones like those of Stonehenge and Carnac — is unusually powerful. Christianchurches, like pagan religious sites, usually face east, and the altar islocated at the east end. What Rosalind Heywood sensed streaming from the altarmay have been precisely the quality for which the site was chosen in the firstplace.According to this theory, the ‘lesser presence’ that Rosalind Heywood sensed inthe bedroom of her grandfather’s house was not really an old woman, but a taperecording of some past event. (Lethbridge believed that the ‘recording’ canoften be seen as well as felt — especially by good dowsers.)Yet although this explanation has a pleasingly scientific ring, it still failsto account for many of Rosalind Heywood’s experiences. It is quite clear thatwhen she experienced ‘Julia’ and ‘Vivian’, she did not feel that she was pickingup a tape recording, and that on Dartmoor, she and her husband felt that theyhad really encountered invisible natural presences, and not some kind ofelectrical field. And how can the ‘sensitivity threshold’ theory of clairvoyanceaccount for the curious episode of ‘splitting’ into two people?’Where this latter is concerned, we can turn for aid to Rosalind Heywood’s friendG. N. M. Tyrrell whose book The Personality of Man has become a classic ofpsychical research. (It was, in fact, written in her house; she describes how,when left alone in the house during the war, ‘Orders’ told her to write toTyrrell asking him if he wanted to move to London, and — against all the odds —he eagerly accepted.) Tyrrell also cites her story of ‘splitting’ (although heomits to mention her name), and then goes on to mention various parallel cases.There was Mrs Willett (the pseudonym of Winifred Coombe-Tennant), an automaticwriting medium, who in August 1913, received a letter from Sir Oliver Lodgecontaining certain enclosures. About to take out these enclosures, sheexperienced a ‘thundering sort of knock-down blow conviction that I must not doso’. While she hesitated, wondering whether to overrule this feeling, shedivided into two. ‘Mind No. 1 got my body up and walked it across the room tothe door … But Mind No. 2 (which was ‘me’ as I know myself) couldn’t make outwhy it was that I was there.’ Then ‘Mind No. 1’ made her put the letter back inits envelope, walk to her husband’s room, and hand it to him. (It was important,from the point of view of evidence, that she should not read the enclosures.)Tyrrell also cites the case of a soldier in the trenches during the First WorldWar who, frozen and miserable, suddenly ‘split’ and found himself outside his‘earthly body’. But his ‘earthly body’ went on talking to a companion, who laterreported that he had chatted with great wit and humour, as if sitting in frontof a comfortable fire.The third case he cites concerned Sir Auckland Geddes, Professor of Anatomy atDublin, and it bears a strong resemblance to the case of the Rev. Bertrandquoted in Chapter One. Geddes describes how he began to feel very ill from acutegastroenteritis, and when he tried to ring for help, found himself unable tomove. As he sat there, he realised that ‘my consciousness was separating fromanother consciousness which was also me’. He calls these A-consciousness andB-consciousness, and says that ‘B-consciousness’ was attached to his body,sitting in the chair, while ‘A-consciousness’ was attached to his ego. (Weshould note that he says ‘attached’ to the ego — not that it was identical withit.) … as my physical condition grew worse and the heart was fibrillating ratherthan beating, I realised that the B-consciousness belonging to the body wasbeginning to show signs of being composite, that is, built up of ‘consciousness’from the head, the heart and the viscera. These components became moreindividual and B-consciousness began to disintegrate, while the A-consciousness,which was now me, seemed to be altogether outside my body …He suddenly became aware that he could not only see the room he was in, but thewhole house and garden, then things in London and Scotland. He makes the oddcomment that he felt he was now ‘free in a time dimension of space, wherein“now” was in some way equivalent to “here” in the ordinary three-dimensionalspace of everyday life’. In other words, he seemed to be one dimension ‘higher’than in the physical world — an observation that may explain Alan Vaughan’sexperience of precognition as he ‘left’ his body, cited in Chapter One.Geddes was discovered a few minutes later, and given a powerful camphorinjection which started his heart beating again. Like the Rev. Bertrand, he felt‘intensely annoyed’ at being drawn back to his body, because he felt that he wasfinally beginning to understand. (When Geddes described this experience, in alecture to the Royal Medical Society, he claimed that it was of a friend whoseword he could trust implicitly, but he later confessed that it was his own.) Heemphasised that, when the experience was over, it had no tendency to fade like adream.There is one very obvious difference between this experience of Geddes and thatof the Rev. Bertrand on the Titlis. When Bertrand experienced the ‘separation’,his conscious ego looked down on his lifeless body. This seems to be whathappens in most out-of-the-body experiences. Geddes, like Rosalind Heywood,experienced divided consciousness; he became two people, both conscious. This issomething we find impossible to envisage; we can only imagine consciousnessbeing in one place at once, so to speak. But Rosalind Heywood told Tyrrell: ‘Iwas definitely both “mes”, and conscious in both places simultaneously. Therewas no sense of a third “me” linking the two.’This point can be underlined by another case cited by Tyrrell — a more typicalexample of an out-of-the-body experience. During the Boer War, Sir AlexanderOgston was admitted to the Bloemfontein Hospital suffering from typhoid fever,and he says that in his delirium ‘mind and body seemed to be dual … I wasconscious of the body as an inert, tumbled mass near the door; it belonged to mebut it was not I.’ He speaks of his ‘mental self’ leaving the body and wanderingalong, ‘seeing other dark shades gliding silently by’, until he felt rapidlydrawn back to his body. It sounds as if all this could be easily explained interms of delirium. But that fails to explain the following incident:I saw plainly … a poor R.A.M.C. surgeon, of whose existence I had not known, andwho was in quite another part of the hospital, grow very ill and scream and die.I saw them cover over his corpse and carry him softly out on shoelessfeet … Afterwards when I told these happenings to the sisters, they informed methat all this had happened …But Ogston experienced no sense of ‘double consciousness’, like Rosalind Heywoodand Geddes. ‘He’ moved around the hospital while his body lay inert on the bed.And this is true of the majority of reported cases. Dr Celia Green, head of theOxford Institute of Psychophysical Research, made a public appeal for cases ofout-of-the-body experience in 1966, and received more than four hundred replies.She published the result of her statistical studies in Out-of-the-BodyExperiences in 1968. And in most cases, the subject found himself outside thephysical body, usually looking down on it from above. There was usually a senseof total detachment, as if the body belonged to someone else.Yet the first case in the book suggests that this is slightly more complicatedthan a straightforward separation of body and ‘soul’. A waitress walking homeafter a twelve-hour stint, in a state of total exhaustion, suddenly foundherself looking down on her physical body — still walking along the street — andthinking: ‘So that’s how I look to other people.’ This seems to suggest that herphysical body had a consciousness of its own. And another subject who‘separated’ during illness, reported ‘The top “me” was feeling very relaxed andcomfortable but quite aware of the suffering of the other “me” …’ which clearlysuggests a double consciousness.Standard reference works seem to display a certain basic agreement aboutout-of-the-body experiences. The general view seems to be that such experiencesinvolve a separation of the physical body and what is referred to as the ‘astralbody’. C. Nelson Stewart writes as follows:For centuries it has been a common idea that man is made of two components — asoul or spirit which comes from God, and a material body of flesh and blood. Butsome philosophers and occult theorists have suggested that each man has a thirdcomponent, an astral body, meaning literally ‘starry body’, and sometimes called‘the body of light’. This astral body is an exact copy of the flesh and bloodbody and is made of finer material …*This, admittedly, sounds typical of the muddled beliefs of ‘occultism’, and itis easy to understand why many orthodox researchers, like Antony Flew and D. J.West, regard the ‘astral body’ as something of a joke. Others, like ProfessorJean Lhermitte, of the Paris Medical Faculty, are willing to accept thegenuineness of out-of-the-body experiences, but regard them as some kind ofhallucination, or a trick played by the unconscious mind on our sensoryapparatus. But then, cases like that of Sir Alexander Ogston raise the questionof how a man suffering from hallucinations could obtain accurate knowledge ofsomething happening elsewhere — such as a patient dying in another part of thehospital. Anyone who takes the trouble to examine the evidence will probably endby agreeing — like Celia Green — that out-of-the-body experiences are more thandelusions, and that therefore, the ‘astral body’ probably exists.The problem then is to find a theory that explains how Rosalind Heywood or SirAuckland Geddes were able to experience ‘double consciousness’, and how thesoldier mentioned by Tyrrell could carry on a conversation with his companionwhile his consciousness looked down on himself from above. Even the standardencyclopedias of the occult and paranormal fail to offer an explanation.One of the few ‘occultists’ who can offer a satisfactory and comprehensivetheory is Rudolf Steiner, the founder of the Anthroposophical movement, whoseviews on life after death will be considered later. Steiner would, in fact, haveobjected to being labelled an occultist, for he regarded himself as a scientist,and his basic training was in science and mathematics.Steiner taught that man consists of four components: body, etheric body, astralbody and ego body. When he sleeps, he splits into two, with the astral body andego separating from the physical and etheric body.These views are worth examining more closely. According to Steiner, the ethericbody (sometimes called the ‘aura’) interpenetrates the physical body, and may beregarded as its architect. He says: ‘All the physical organs are maintained intheir form and shape by the currents and movements of the etheric body.’The word ‘currents’ offers an interesting clue. Since the eighteenth century —when Galvani discovered that the leg of a dead frog could be made to kick whenan electric current was passed through it — it has been recognised that, in somerespects, human beings are electrical machines. Every time we think, the braindischarges electric currents.One of the more baffling things about living matter is what holds it together.This was underlined in the late-nineteenth century by a young biologist namedHans Driesch. Driesch waited until the fertilised egg of a sea urchin divided,and then killed off a half of it with a hot needle. He expected the other halfto develop into half a sea urchin. To his surprise, it developed into a completebut half-sized sea urchin. He tried fusing two eggs together; the result was adouble-size sea urchin. Clearly, some force was actively shaping the wholething. Until then, it had been assumed that an embryo contains a lot of tinylabelled parts, like some do-it-yourself piece of furniture. Driesch’sexperiment offered a surprising new picture — as if a do-it-yourself wardrobecame with a tiny dwarf whose business is to put it together.Across the Atlantic, a professor of anatomy, Harold Saxton Burr, was interestedin Driesch’s results, and particularly in this idea of a ‘shaping field’ orblueprint. Burr pointed out that if a salamander embryo is placed in an alkalinesolution, its individual cells ‘disaggregate’ and turn into something like abagfull of marbles. But if these are placed in a slightly acid solution, theycome together again and re-form into an embryo. Burr compared this to whathappens when a magnet is held underneath iron filings on a sheet of paper — theyform into a pattern following the lines of magnetic force. Burr and hiscolleague F. S. C. Northrop attached delicate voltmeters to trees, embryos andother forms of living matter, and showed that seasonal changes are accompaniedby a change in a weak electric field. This electric field is characteristic ofall living creatures. It is the shaping force of life, the dwarf who comes withthe do-it-yourself wardrobe. So Steiner’s remarks about the ‘etheric body’ —that it is the ‘architect’ of the physical body, and that organs maintain theirshape through its currents — proves to be a precise and accurate scientificdescription. Since Steiner wrote these words in 1910 (in An Outline of OccultScience) — a quarter of a century before Burr and Northrop began experimentingat Yale — it must be admitted that he showed remarkable prescience.But, according to Steiner, a human being who consisted only of physical bodyheld together by etheric body would be literally a vegetable. In fact, a humanbeing during sleep is a kind of vegetable. When he wakes up, consciousness hasbeen added to the mixture and, according to Steiner, consciousness is the astralbody — or at least, its most important effect. Just as man shares the ethericbody in common with vegetables, so he shares the astral body in common withanimals.In man, says Steiner, there is yet another principle over and above these. Ananimal’s choices are dictated by its sensations: heat and cold, hunger andthirst, pleasure and pain. Man is able to develop desires and wishes that gobeyond these. An obvious example is his interest in mathematics, which seems tohave no possible connection with his physical appetites. (Throughout his life,Steiner maintained an interest in mathematics.) This higher level of choice mancalls the ego. The ego, says Steiner, is a principle of continuity. The animalself forgets quickly and easily (everyone has noticed how easily we forget themiseries of physical illness, for example). The ego attempts to provide acertain lasting element in human life.These observations will strike a chord in every intelligent person. Nietzscheonce remarked that we would like to ask the cows the secret of their happiness,but it would be pointless because they would have forgotten the question beforethey could give an answer. They have no continuity of consciousness. H. G. Wellsmade the same point in his Experiment in Autobiography: that since the beginningof time most living creatures have been ‘up against it’, so their lives havebeen basically a struggle against circumstance. Now, says Wells, for the firsttime in history, you can say to a man: Yes, you earn a living, you support afamily, you love and hate, but — what do you do? It applies to all kinds of men,from scientists to artists, from mathematicians to religious thinkers. Take awaythat central preoccupation of their lives, and condemn them to mere ‘living’,and they would want to commit suicide.So Steiner’s fourfold division of man makes practical sense on at least three ofits levels: the physical (obviously), the etheric level and the ego level. Andif we are willing to concede the evidence for out-of-the-body experiences, thenwe could say that his fourfold division appeals to commonsense on every level.Another ‘occult’ system that bears a close resemblance to Steiner’s is that ofthe Kahunas of Hawaii, as described by the anthropologist Max Freedom Long inworks such as The Huna Code in Religion. The Kahunas (priests of the Hunareligion) also believe that man consists of a physical body and three ‘spirits’or selves. These consist of the ‘low self, man’s instinctive being, whichcorresponds roughly to the Freudian ‘unconscious’; the ‘middle self, man’sconscious ego or ‘everyday self’; and the ‘high self’, a superconscious egowhich possesses greater powers than the other two. The everyday self is ignorantof the existence of the other two. He fails to recognise the existence of the‘high self’ because it is as far above ordinary consciousness as the‘unconscious mind’ is below it. Moreover, the ‘low self’ and the ‘middle self’intermingle, so that man assumes they are one and the same.This ‘low self sounds very much like Steiner’s ‘etheric body’. Itinterpenetrates every cell and tissue of the body, and is the manufacturer ofvital force. It is also the seat of the emotions — of love, hate, fear anddesire. Its centre of gravity, according to the Kahunas, is the solar plexus. Itis naturally violent and emotional, and often behaves like a spoilt child. The‘middle self’ should attempt to discipline it and raise it to its own level;regrettably, many people give way to the demands of the ‘low self’ and descendto its level.All this begins to answer the question of how Rosalind Heywood could experienceherself as ‘White Me’ and ‘Pink Me’, with ‘White Me’ feeling a certain contemptfor ‘Pink Me’ and its selfish desires. In Steiner’s terminology, the ego waslooking down on the etheric body; in Kahuna terminology, the ‘low self’ was PinkMe and the ‘high self’ was White Me. This seems confirmed by Rosalind Heywood’scomment:A moment or two later — I felt no transition — White Me was once more imprisonedwith Pink Me in one body, and there they have dwelt as oil and water ever since.It is only quite lately that I have become aware, though I seldom remember it,that I can deliberately identify myself with White Me and watch without feelingthem — that is the point — the desires and repulsions that must inevitably tossall Pink Mes around.And she adds the interesting comment: ‘If Freud ever struck such cases perhapsthey helped to lead him towards the concepts of Id and Supergo.’ In Freud, theSupergo is, of course, another name for conscience, not for some ‘higher ego’,as Rosalind Heywood here implies. But her own analysis of the situation fits inperfectly with the views of the Kahunas on the ‘low self’ and the ‘high self’.All this makes it clear that Rosalind Heywood is not, as we might at first havesuspected, an egotistic female who has invented a lot of ‘psychic’ experiencesto make herself sound interesting. She is simply describing the world as it isseen through the eyes of a typical ‘clairvoyant’. This world certainly differsfrom the world as described by modern science; yet it has its own innerconsistency. And if the ‘sensitivity threshold’ theory is correct, it iscertainly not in any way a contradiction of science. In fact, as we have seen,many of Rosalind Heywood’s experiences could be explained in terms of the rightand left hemispheres of the brain.Having said which, it is necessary to admit that she says many things that mostscientists would find quite unacceptable — like her experiences with ‘Julia’ and‘Vivian’ — the second of which finally convinced her of the reality of lifeafter death. And what are we to make of her experience on the edge of Dartmoor,when she claims to have sensed various non-human presences, some of which cameto visit her (‘a covey of little invisibles’) as she sat at her writing desk thenext day?Here it is only possible to repeat that the experience is not peculiar toRosalind Heywood. The entities she describes are usually known as nature spiritsor elementals, and most ‘sensitives’ claim to have seen them. Steiner speaks ofthem as a matter of fact, and comments:We can lay hold of nature with ideas that assume a monistic (i.e. material)reality because sense perception allows us normally to experience only as muchof nature as is in accord with that principle. Everything contradictory isfiltered out, and nature is communicated to us in the guise of a monisticsystem.He goes on: ‘In the elemental world we find earth spirits (gnomes), waterspirits (undines), air spirits (sylphs) and fire spirits (salamanders) …’*W. Y. Evans Wentz, an authority on Eastern religions, states in his classicstudy The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries: ‘… we can postulatescientifically … the existence of such invisible intelligences as gods, genii,daemons, all kinds of true fairies, and disembodied man’. He arrived at thisconclusion as a result of years of study of ‘fairy faith’ and the gathering ofhundreds of depositions.By far the strangest story in Adam Crabtree’s Multiple Man concerns ‘possession’by an apparently non-human entity. Crabtree admits to having his doubts aboutincluding it because it sounds so preposterous, but adds: ‘The fact remains,however, that it occurred as I have described it (if anything I have toned downsome of the more dramatic elements of the experience).’ It concerned a mancalled Marius, who taught history in a university and held a good position witha government health agency. He had been a happily married man until, for noreason he could understand, he suddenly began to experience murderous impulsestowards his wife. He seemed to be driven by ‘some relentless inner compulsion tosee blood’. These impulses were so strong that he believed he might lose controland kill her.His dreams seemed to provide a clue — dreams of living among cave men who woreskins, and of crouching in a crude hut where strips of meat hung up to dry. Hehad also dreamt of meeting a powerfully built, primitive man coming up from hisbasement. Soon after this dream he was looking through his collection of coinswhen he found that one had been displaced and put on a shelf. He had no memoryof doing this. A window screen that he had repaired was torn, and again he couldfind no explanation. It was after this that he began to hear a voice in hishead. It told him that he — the voice — was the man he had seen in his dream,and that he was permanently inside Marius. To prove it, he had twice takenpossession of him, moving the coin and tearing the screen. He could, he said,possess him whenever he liked.Marius also seemed to believe that he was ‘possessed’ by some curious entitycalled the Bear. And he seemed to have his own ideas about how to exorcise it.He felt that he needed to lie in front of a large wood fire, to absorb itswarmth, and that this would strengthen him enough to allow the Bear to revealitself.For this therapeutic session, Crabtree and his patient moved to a countryretreat, and five strong men also came along, in case Marius should give way tothe urge to violence. A huge wood fire was built in the fireplace, and Mariuslay in front of it, stripped to the waist. After half an hour, he began howlingand tearing at the floor. When he relaxed and returned to normality, he toldthem that he now understood about the Bear. It was a huge cave bear that hadbeen captured by a band of hunters, and then killed slowly — no doubt as part ofsome ritual. Its spirit had entered one of the hunters, and had then moved downthe generations, passing from father to son until it reached Marius. Now it hadleft.But the entity that was driving Marius to violence was still inside him.According to Marius, this was a ‘round hole in space’, and it absorbed violence.It had been present when the bear was killed. It had appeared in Marius’s dreamas the huge, primitive man coming up from the basement (the symbolism here isobvious).The following day, when Marius had been placed in a deeply relaxed state, thisentity began to speak through him. After a great deal of questioning and somehostile bickering, it finally gave its name as Morlac, and said that, in theremote past, it had been worshipped as a goat and a stag. ‘It had fed off thelife and energy of those who worshipped it.’ For thousands of years it had beenworshipped in various forms; ‘it detested affection and love but it prospered inan atmosphere of violence and fear’. It described itself as a kind of‘shimmering’ in space, ‘a sort of vortex, completely dark, with a “rim” of somekind’. It actively disliked the feelings of concern and benevolence thatCrabtree and his fellow workers were directing at Marius.When Marius became exhausted — which happened frequently during work with the‘entity’ — they stopped work until the next day. Marius retained no memory ofwhat took place during these sessions.Back in Toronto, the strange conversations with the ‘entity’ continued; itremained contemptuous but was no longer totally uncooperative. ‘After a numberof city sessions, something new entered the work. The entity began to recall itsorigins. It realised it had come from some other place and had a history whichpreceded its earth experiences, though it could not remember that history.’The next paragraph makes it clear why Crabtree felt so embarrassed aboutdescribing this particular case:Then one day the entity realised something about itself: that it was not totallydark, as it had always thought; in fact, its ‘rim’ had a tinge of light. Fromthat point things moved quickly. The entity recognised that it did not have tofear the ‘white light’, that it had long ago in some other place lived in ‘thelight’. Next came the recognition that it must leave the host it was possessing.At first the entity feared starvation without a victim to feed upon, but when itrealised that ‘the light’ would nourish it, it left.Crabtree records that, in the eighteen months since this happened, Marius hasexperienced no recurrence of the problem, and his family life has returned tonormal.As usual with Crabtree’s cases, there is nothing here that could not beinterpreted in terms of mental illness. Having said that, it is necessary to addthat psychics from Swedenborg to Rosalind Heywood would agree that there isanother possible explanation: that there are disembodied entities, and that someof them are evil and dangerous. Rosalind Heywood’s description of an encounterwith such an entity may serve as a conclusion to the present chapter. Ithappened in 1927, in a house in Sussex that had been converted out of a group ofold barns. She and her husband arrived together with their furniture, late onenight, and after putting up two beds, slept heavily until morning. On waking up,both of them had the same thought: ‘We cannot bring the baby here.’ ‘We weresimply aware of hate — that hostile invisible non-human entities belonged to theplace and desperately wanted to drive us away.’They had signed the lease and could not afford to look for somewhere else. Herhusband decided that the answer might be an exorcist. He came back later with apriest, who asked for salt and water:I went to fetch these from the kitchen … Then came a shock. It was a hell’skitchen, a raging whirlpool of hate, dismay and, strongest of all, panic. I feltas if I were being battered by almost physical breakers of panic and was verytempted to turn and bolt. However, although at the time I knew nothing ofsystematic investigation, the instinct to test the unusual was too strong, and Itook some water only, returned to the drawing-room and said casually to myhusband, ‘Oh dear, I’ve left the salt. Do get it, will you?’He went off cheerfully, but on his return even he looked taken aback. ‘Goodgracious,’ he said, ‘that kitchen.’But the ritual of exorcism apparently worked, and when she sat in the kitchenwith the light turned out, ‘the raging hate had gone, the terror had gone, andin their place was a quiet shining peace’.With her usual fair-mindedness, Rosalind Heywood is willing to admit that thismay have been simply due to suggestion. A few years later they lent the house toher sister, who found it impossible to venture into the kitchen at night withoutfeeling something that filled her with terror. But neither Rosalind Heywood norher husband ever again picked up the sense of the hostile non-human entity.This episode, like so many others discussed in this chapter, sounds as if itbelongs to the world of mediaeval superstition. In fact, it fits into a patternof discovery that has begun to emerge in the last century and a half, and whichwe must now consider in its historical perspective.*See my Criminal History of Mankind, Chapter 2.*Grimble, Pattern of Islands, Chapter 6.**F.

Mrs Crowe was an Edinburgh housewife, who had alreadyachieved a modest success with novels like Susan Hopley and Lily Dawson. TheNight Side of Nature — subtitled ‘Ghosts and Ghost Seers’ — made her acelebrity, and went on to become one of the most influential books of thenineteenth century.Regrettably, Mrs Crowe did not enjoy her success for long. In 1859, she produceda treatise called ‘Spiritualism and the Age We Live In’ — which, according tothe Dictionary of National Biography, evinced ‘a morbid and despondent turn ofmind’, and soon after this she went insane — a fate her contemporaries must havefelt she had invited by her interest in such macabre subjects. She recovered,but wrote little between then and her death in 1876. The Night Side of Natureremained as popular as ever, and was still on sale on railway bookstalls (pricetwo shillings) at the turn of the century.The author of the piece in the Dictionary of National Biography was clearly nota believer in ghosts and ghost seers; for while he admits that the book is ‘oneof the best collections of supernatural stories in our language’, he thenattacks Mrs Crowe for being ‘extremely credulous and uncritical’. The reproachis unfair; the book would not have become so influential if it had been merely acollection of ghost stories. What the Victorians liked about it was its air ofsturdy commonsense, and its attempts to treat the phenomena with detachment. Itwould be more than thirty years before scientific investigators approached thesupernatural in a spirit of systematic research. But Mrs Crowe did her best,citing letters and documents and offering names of witnesses and dates.The book that inspired The Night Side of Nature was another nineteenth-centurybestseller called The Seeress of Prevorst, by Justinus Kerner, and CatherineCrowe had published her own translation from the German only three yearsearlier. It was the first full-length study of a clairvoyant in literaryhistory. The seeress of Prevorst was a peasant woman called Friederike Hauffe,who had been seeing strange visions and conversing with invisible spirits sincechildhood. At the age of nineteen, Friederike had married a cousin and had ababy; then she went into post-natal depression, and developed symptoms ofhysteria. Every evening she fell into a trance and saw spirits of the dead.Kerner, a wealthy doctor and amateur poet, was summoned to try to cure her.Understandably, he treated her visions as delusions. But he was fascinated byone claim that was undoubtedly genuine. Friederike could read with her stomach.She would lie on a bed, and an open book would be placed, face down, on hernaked midriff. And, with her eyes closed, she would read as easily as if it wasin front of her face. She also claimed to be able to see into the human body,and possessed a knowledge of the nervous system that was extraordinary for apeasant.Kerner changed his mind about her visions after a strange experience. She toldhim that she was being haunted by a man with a squint, and Kerner recognised thedescription of a man who had died a few years earlier. The dead man, saidFriederike, was suffering from a guilty conscience because he had embezzled somemoney and another man had been blamed. Now the embezzler wanted to clear theinnocent man’s name, for the sake of his widow. The proof, he said, resided in achest of documents, which would be found in the room of a certain official. The‘spirit’ had shown her the official sitting in his room, with the chest open onthe table; her description was so good that Kerner recognised a judge calledHeyd. The judge had to admit the accuracy of Friederike’s account of his room,and both he and Kerner were staggered when the document was found exactly whereshe said it would be — she even knew that it had been filed in the wrong place.From now on, Kerner took Friederike seriously, and made a note of her basicideas. She told him that we are surrounded by invisible spirits, and to proveit, persuaded them to make rapping noises, throw gravel, and made a stool riseup into the air. A book opened itself; a candle was extinguished by invisiblefingers; and something tugged off Friederike’s boots as she lay on the bed.Kerner himself saw a ‘spirit’, which he described as looking like a grey pillarof cloud surmounted by a head.Friederike spoke a strange unknown language, which she claimed to be theoriginal language of the inner life — scholars later found that it resembledCoptic. She talked about various complicated cycles of human existence —sun-circles and life-circles. And — most significant — she declared that manconsists of four parts: body, ‘nerve aura’, soul and spirit, the nerve aurabeing an ‘ethereal body’ which carries on the vital processes when we are asleepor in trance; all this corresponds precisely to the views of Steiner, asdescribed in Chapter Two.These spirit manifestations did her health no good, and she died at the age oftwenty-nine, in 1829, the same year that Kerner published his book The Seeressof Prevorst. It caused a sensation. Kerner was a respectable literary man, afriend of poets and philosophers, as well as an eminent physician, so it couldnot be dismissed as lies or fantasy. The well-known theologian David Strauss hadalso witnessed many of the things described in the book, and vouched for theirtruth. Strauss’s ‘destructive’ Life of Jesus would soon be causing a nationalscandal; but even this hardly compared with the European scandal caused by TheSeeress of Prevorst. The nineteenth century was the age of rationalismtriumphant. Scientists would come to terms with David Strauss’s scepticism — butnot with Friederike’s invisible spirits. The doctors of Paris and Vienna haddestroyed the career of Dr Franz Mesmer by denouncing ‘mesmerism’ and hypnosisas a fraud. They refused even to look at the evidence for telepathy orclairvoyance. It was easier to believe that The Seeress of Prevorst was a hoaxthan to ask what it all meant. The tremendous popular success of the book onlydeepened their conviction that it was some kind of imposture.All this helps to explain why it took Kerner’s book almost two decades to reachEngland. Britain, after all, was the original home of scepticism. David Hume haddismissed miracles by asking which was more likely: that witnesses should telllies, or that the laws of nature should be violated? The English were proud oftheir tradition of bold thinking; they liked to point out that, unlike theFrench and Italians and Bavarians, they had no reason to fear being sent to thestake if they called the pope a liar. The British medical profession entirelyapproved of the decision of their French colleagues to denounce Mesmer as acharlatan; when a nonconformist doctor named John Elliotson declared that hetook mesmerism seriously, an eminent surgeon named Sir Benjamin Brodie stated inprint that it was ‘a debasing superstition, a miserable amalgam of faith andfear’.But Catherine Crowe published her translation of The Seeress of Prevorst in1845, and came to no harm — after all, she was a woman, and a novelist at that.The book excited as much attention as it had in German. And it convinced MrsCrowe of the reality of the ‘supernatural’. She had so far been a disciple ofthe famous Edinburgh doctor George Combe, Britain’s most famous exponent ofphrenology — the doctrine that a man’s character can be read through the bumpson his skull — and Combe was a determined sceptic about ghosts and such matters.Kerner — and Friederike — made her a convert. It now came to her as a revelationthat the ‘scientific spirit’ had gone too far. ‘Because, in the 17th century,credulity outran reason and discretion, the 18th century, by a natural reaction,flung itself into an opposite extreme.’ And the nineteenth century had carriedthis attitude to the point of absurdity; in fact, it had become a new kind ofsuperstition, refusing to face facts that contradicted its dogmas.Mrs Crowe was not particularly credulous. She set about unearthing her ownfacts, and found that they seemed to fit together into a logical pattern. Almosteverything she wrote about would later be studied more systematically byparapsychologists, and carefully documented in scientific archives: dreaming ofthe future, death-bed visions, premonitions of disaster, ‘phantasms’ of theliving and of the dead, poltergeists, spontaneous psychokinesis, evenpossession. She reproaches contemporary scientists for insisting that thesupernatural can be explained in terms of hysteria or nervous derangement, andpoints out, quite fairly, that they ‘arrange the facts to their theory, nottheir theory to the facts’. What is now needed, she says, is investigation. ‘Andby investigation I do not mean the hasty, captious, angry notice of an unwelcomefact … but the slow, modest, pains-taking examination that is content to waitupon nature, and humbly follow out her disclosures, however opposed topreconceived theories or mortifying to human pride.’ Here she seems to beechoing a famous remark by Thomas Henry Huxley about the duty of the scientist:‘Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up everypreconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and to whatever abysses natureleads, or you shall learn nothing.’ It is interesting to discover that Huxleywrote this sentence in 1860, more than a decade after The Night Side of Naturewas published; Huxley may, in fact, be echoing Mrs Crowe.Her aim, she readily admits, is to see whether the evidence proves that somepart of man can survive his death. The first step in this direction — and it waslater followed by most of her eminent successors, such as Myers and Tyrrell —was to try to show that man possesses powers that cannot be explained byscience. She devotes several chapters to dreams and presentiments of the future,and includes a number of experiences gathered from friends:Another friend lately dreamt, one Thursday night, that he saw an acquaintance ofhis thrown from his horse, and that he was lying on the ground with the bloodstreaming from his face, and was much cut. He mentioned his dream in themorning, and being an entire disbeliever in such phenomena, he was unable toaccount for the impression it made on his mind. This was so strong that, onSaturday, he could not forebear calling at his friend’s house, who he was toldwas in bed, having been thrown from his horse on the previous day, and muchinjured about the face.If Mrs Crowe had lived to become a member of the Society for Psychical Research,she would have gone to the trouble of getting signed statements from her friend,the man who had the accident, and the person he told about the dream the morningafter. As a pioneer in the field, she obviously felt that this was unnecessary.Otherwise, it is difficult to fault her method.Like every writer on the paranormal, she is particularly fascinated byout-of-the-body experiences, for she rightly regards these as potential proofthat there is something in man that can exist outside the body. Again, she doesher best to offer facts that could be checked:The late Mr John Holloway, of the Bank of England, brother to the engraver ofthat name, related of himself that being one night in bed with his wife andunable to sleep, he had fixed his eyes and thoughts with uncommon intensity on abeautiful star that was shining in at the window, when he suddenly found hisspirit released from his body and soaring into that bright sphere. But,instantly seized with anxiety for the anguish of his wife, if she discovered hisbody apparently dead beside her, he returned and re-entered it withdifficulty … He described that returning was returning to darkness; and thatwhilst the spirit was free, he was alternately in the light or in the dark,accordingly as his thoughts were with his wife or with the star. He said that healways avoided anything that could produce a repetition of this accident, theconsequences of it being very distressing.Mrs Crowe’s main problem was that, working mainly from hearsay, she had nosimple way of distinguishing the authentic from the inauthentic. A typicalexample is a case she cites from Heinrich Jung-Stilling. Now Jung-Stilling was aserious investigator of the paranormal, a Professor of Economics at burg, and afollower of the doctrines of Mesmer. He ought to have been a reliable authority.And the story he tells is in many ways a good case of what was later to becalled a ‘phantasm of the living’. In Philadelphia around the year 1740, saysJung-Stilling, a clairvoyant was approached by the wife of a sea captain, whowas anxious because she had not heard from her husband for a long time. Theclairvoyant asked her to excuse him, and went into another room. After a while,the woman became impatient, and went and peeped through a crack in the door; theclairvoyant was lying on a sofa, apparently asleep. When he came back, he toldher that her husband was alive and well, but had been unable to write to her forvarious reasons, which he explained. At this moment, he said, the captain was ina coffee house in London, and would soon be back home.In due course, the captain returned, and confirmed the reasons that theclairvoyant had given for failing to write. And when he was introduced to theclairvoyant, the husband recognised him as a man he had seen in a London coffeehouse on the eve of his departure for America. According to the captain, the manhad spoken to him, asked him why he had not written to his wife, and thenvanished into the crowd …The clairvoyant’s power of ‘projecting’ himself across the Atlantic brings tomind similar stories of Swedenborg bringing messages from the dead. Hisappearance in a London coffee house has dozens of parallels in Phantasms of theLiving, compiled in the 1880s by members of the Society for Psychical Research.What rings totally false here is the information that the captain spoke to himand explained why he had failed to write to his wife. There are hundreds ofrecorded cases of ‘projection’, but in very few (I can recall only one*) doesthe ‘phantasm’ actually talk to anybody. When we learn that these eventssupposedly took place in 1740 — the year Jung-Stilling was born — it becomesclear that, even if basically true, the story had probably been ‘improved’ inthe telling. Mrs Crowe had no way of knowing that the story failed to conform tothe general pattern of ‘phantasms of the living’ because in her day there hadnot been enough research for the pattern to emerge.In view of this difficulty, Mrs Crowe did remarkably well, and her book deservedits high reputation. Most of her conjectures would do credit to a moderninvestigator. For example, in the chapter on ‘The Poltergeist of the Germans’,she discusses a recent case of a French girl named Angelique Cottin who, in1846, had been weaving silk gloves when the loom began to move violently.Angelique — who was 14 — had apparently turned into a human magnet, and objectsheld close to her would fly through the air and stick to her. Oddly enough, shehad no attraction for metals; but this was clearly some form of electricity, forshe gave people electric shocks; it could only be prevented if she stood on apiece of thick cork. Mrs Crowe went on to make the sensible suggestion thatpoltergeist phenomena might be electrical in nature — a remarkably perceptiveinsight when most writers on the subject assumed that poltergeists weremalevolent spectres.In other ways, her ‘credulity’ was often far ahead of her time. She cites astory from another early researcher, Joseph Ennemoser:It appears that Van Helmont, having asserted that it was possible for a man toextinguish the life of an animal by the eye alone (oculis intentis), Rousseau,the naturalist, repeated the experiment when in the East, and in this mannerkilled several toads; but on a subsequent occasion, whilst trying the sameexperiment at Lyons, the animal, on finding it could not escape, fixed its eyesimmovably on him, so that he fell into a fainting fit, and was thought to bedead …This is the kind of tale that makes us smile sarcastically; we know that thesestories of the hypnotic power of snakes and other creatures are old wives’tales. Yet a modern investigator, Dr Ferenc Andras Volgyesi, devoted many yearsto studying hypnosis in men and animals, and arrived at some interestingconclusions. He observed — and photographed — dozens of cases in which snakes‘fascinated’ rabbits or rats and then ate them. He also observed many cases of‘battles of wills’ between the snake and its potential victims — his bookcontains photographs of a giant anaconda ‘fascinating’ a rat, and a pythonimmobilising a hare. But another shows a battle of wills between a bird, thecucullus senegalensis, and a rattlesnake. He states: ‘The battle, which beginswith a mutual fixing of the gaze, usually ends in victory for the bird.’ Anotherphotograph shows a toad winning a battle of wills with a cobra. Volgyesidescribes a battle between two lizards; they confronted one another for aboutten minutes, gazing intently at one another (as Mrs Crowe says, oculis intentis)then one slowly ate the other, which remained immobile.* Van Helmont’s taleabout killing animals with the gaze may be an exaggeration, but it is based onan observed reality.There is a great deal in the literature of hypnosis to support Mrs Crowe’s viewthat it involves the deliberate use of some mental force; in 1885, the Frenchpsychologist Pierre Janet observed the experiments of a doctor named Gibert, whocould induce hypnosis in a patient called Leonie by merely thinking about her,and summon her from the other side of Le Havre by the same means. In the 1890s,Dr Paul Joire caused blindfolded and hypnotised patients to obey his mentalcommands, and the same kind of experiments were repeated in the 1920s by theRussian scientist L. L. Vasiliev, who described them in a book calledExperiments in Distant Influence; it leaves no possible doubt that some kind ofmental force can be exercised at a distance.What fascinated Mrs Crowe was the clear implication that human powers are fargreater than we realise. If people can leave their bodies and witness thingsthat are going on elsewhere, if a hypnotised subject can describe things thatare happening in the street, if a girl can turn into a human magnet, if a mancan dream accurately about the future — then materialistic science must besomehow fundamentally mistaken about our human limitations. Mrs Crowe hadtranslated The Seeress of Prevorst, and it was perfectly clear to her thatunless Kerner was an out-and-out liar, then something very queer was going on.This was not the second-hand reporting of spooks and spectres, as inJung-Stilling’s Pneumatology; this was first-hand reporting by a man who had noreason to lie or deceive himself. Kerner described — and Mrs Crowe cites in TheNight Side of Nature — how Friederike had awakened one night crying ‘Oh, God!’,and how a doctor who was sitting near the corpse of her father, many miles away,clearly heard the exclamation, and rushed into the room to see if the corpse hadcome to life. This was not a question of spirits; it was some curious powerpossessed by Friederike herself. And while such powers seem to be beyond thecontrol of the individual who exercises them, Mrs Crowe could see that there isno earthly reason why this should always be so. That is why the hard-headedVictorians found her book so exciting. Their explorers were penetrating newcontinents, their railways were stretching to the ends of the earth, theirindustries were creating new wealth, their science was uncovering the secrets ofthe universe. And if Mrs Crowe was correct, a new science of the ‘supernatural’would demonstrate that man himself was a far more extraordinary creature then hehad ever suspected. Her book was not a morbid collection oftales-to-make-the-flesh-creep, but a work of buoyant optimism about humanpotentialities.Unfortunately, a Victorian lady novelist was hardly the person to persuadescientists that they were ignoring an important subject. The Victorians hadfought hard for their intellectual freedom. Witches were still being executed inthe 1690s; as late as the 1750s, the Church forced the great naturalist Buffonto withdraw his statement that the earth was a fragment of the sun, and thatfossils were the remains of primitive ancestors of present-day creatures. By1800, intellectuals were utterly sick of the authority the Church had beenexercising for centuries. They longed to see the downfall of theseecclesiastical bullies. So every time someone dared to challenge theintellectual authority of the Church, cheers echoed throughout Europe. In 1830,two years after The Night Side of Nature was published, the German theologianLudwig Feuerbach produced a book, Thoughts on Death and Immortality, in which hedismissed the idea of a personal God, and jeered at the desire for immortalityas selfish stupidity. Feuerbach was persecuted by the police and forced to giveup his post at the university. Ten years later, Feuerbach published a far moreradical book, The Essence of Christianity which landed like a bombshell andfrightened even the freethinkers; he declared that God and immortality weredangerous delusions, and that man has to learn to live in the present instead ofwasting his time dreaming about a nonexistent heaven. (The book had a deepinfluence on Karl Marx, who expressed its basic message in the phrase ‘Religionis the opium of the people’.) In his novel Green Heinrich, the Swiss poetGottfried Keller describes Feuerbach as ‘a magician in the shape of a bird whosang God out of the hearts of thousands’. And the same book has a portrait of aschoolteacher who has lost his job because he is an atheist, but who travelsaround Germany exclaiming: ‘Isn’t it a joy to be alive?’, and ‘forevermarvelling at the glory of being free from the encumbrance’ of God.This is why the scientists and philosophers were not willing to pay attention tothe evidence for the ‘supernatural’. They were too delighted to see the Churchgetting a black eye, and had no intention of letting religion sneak in again bythe back door. So when Catherine Crowe began her book by admitting that shewanted to prove the reality of man’s immortal soul, most of them read nofurther. Whether Mrs Crowe intended it or not, she was giving aid and comfort tothe enemy.In fact, in the year The Night Side of Nature was published, this particularenemy was preparing to mount a full-frontal assault …With the wisdom of hindsight, we can see that the most interesting andsignificant pages of The Night Side of Nature are those that concern thehaunting of a house owned by an industrialist named Joshua Proctor. Here MrsCrowe presents the kind of carefully documented account that would be the aim ofthe later investigators of the Society for Psychical Research. This is the truestuff of psychical research. She prefaces the account with a letter from JoshuaProctor to herself, vouching for the accuracy of the details of the report thatfollows.The haunted house was a millhouse; it had been built only forty years earlier,in 1800. The newly-built Newcastle and Shields railway passed overhead on aviaduct. In June 1840, news reached the outside world that the Proctor family —who were Quakers — had been disturbed by knocking noises, and had seen someunpleasant things. A surgeon named Edward Drury, who practised in Sunderland,heard about the haunting from a local farmer. Dr Drury was sceptical about suchmatters. Nevertheless, he had been fascinated by the account of a famouspoltergeist haunting at Epworth, in the rectory of the Rev. Samuel Wesley,grandfather of the founder of Methodism. This spook, known as Old Jeffrey, hadbanged and groaned around the rectory for two months in 1716. There were soundsof heavy breathing, breaking glass, footsteps, and various unidentifiablenoises. The Rev. Samuel noticed that the disturbances seemed in some wayconnected with his nineteen-year-old daughter Hetty, who trembled in her sleepbefore the sounds began. The scientist Joseph Priestley had investigated thecase, and decided it was a hoax. Dr Drury was inclined to agree with him; sowhen he heard of the ‘haunting’ of Willington Mill, he wrote to its owner,Joshua Proctor, offering to ‘unravel the mystery’ (that is, expose the hoaxer).Mr Proctor replied politely, saying that he and his family were going away on avisit on the date Mr Drury had suggested; one of his employees was going to actas caretaker while they were away. Nevertheless, if Drury wanted to come andstay overnight, he was welcome.Dr Drury decided take a friend along for moral support. He also took a brace ofpistols, intending to allow one of them to fall on the floor, as if by accident,to deter any practical joker. But when he arrived, he found that Joshua Proctorhad returned — alone — from his holiday, and Mr Proctor was so obviously anhonest man that Drury decided the ‘accident’ was unnecessary.What happened to Edward Drury that night convinced him completely of the realityof the supernatural. It also gave him such a fright that he went partially deafin one ear and suffered a temporary breakdown in health. He seems to have beentoo shattered to describe what he had seen immediately afterwards, but hepromised to write Mr Proctor a letter with a full account. This letter waswritten on 13 July 1840, ten days after his night in the haunted millhouse.He arrived with his friend, T. Hudson, and was made welcome by Mr Proctor, whoshowed him over the house. At eleven o’clock, Dr Drury and Mr Hudson settleddown on the third-story landing outside the ‘haunted room’. (Although he says he‘expected to account for any noises that he might hear in a philosophicalmanner’, he presumably decided that discretion was the better part of valour.)About an hour later, they heard pattering noises, ‘as if a number of people werepattering with their bare feet’. Then there was a knocking sound from thefloorboards at their feet, as if someone was rapping with his knuckles. Afterthis, they heard a ‘hollow cough’ from the haunted room, but seem to havedecided not to investigate. Then they heard a rustling noise, as if someone wascoming upstairs.At a quarter to one, feeling cold, Dr Drury said he thought he would retire tobed; Mr Hudson said he intended to stay up until dawn. Drury looked at hiswatch, and noted the time. As he looked up, he saw a closet door open, and ‘thefigure of a female, attired in greyish garments, with the head incliningdownwards, and one hand pressed upon the chest, as if in pain’ walking towardshim. Mr Hudson was fast asleep, but was awakened by Drury’s ‘awful yell’. Druryrushed at the figure, ‘but instead of grasping it, I fell upon my friend, and Irecollected nothing distinctly for nearly three hours afterwards. I have sincelearnt that I was carried down stairs in an agony of fear and terror.’Mrs Crowe not only publishes the full correspondence between Dr Drury and JoshuaProctor, but an account by a local historian, another by the owner of a localjournal, and descriptions by four other people who had seen the ghost. In fact,there seemed to be more than one; there was also a man in a surplice who glidedacross a second floor room at a distance of a few feet from the floor. The localhistorian adds to his account the information that Mr Proctor has recentlydiscovered an old book that states that similar hauntings had taken place in anolder house that had been built on the same spot two hundred years before. MrsCrowe ends her account by mentioning that Mr Proctor has now decided to leavethe house, and turn it into ‘small tenements’ for his workpeople.What makes this report so interesting is that the case resembles in so manyrespects the ‘haunting’ that would occur eight years later in Hydesville, NewYork, and that would launch the Spiritualism movement of the nineteenth century.In Willington, as in Hydesville, there was a mixture of ‘poltergeist’ phenomenaand the more conventional type of haunting. If Dr Drury had shown the same kindof courage and curiosity shown later by Mrs Margaret Fox at Hydesville, it seemshighly probable that the Spiritualist movement would have been launched tenyears earlier in England.The Hydesville affair began on 31 March 1848, in a wooden frame house inhabitedby a Methodist farmer named James D. Fox, his wife Margaret, and their twodaughters, Margaretta, age 14, and Kate, age 12. Hydesville is a small townshipnot far from Rochester, New York. James Fox had moved into the house in theprevious December. A previous tenant, Michael Weekman, had been disturbed byvarious loud knocks, for which he could find no cause.The Fox family was also kept awake by various banging noises in the last days ofMarch 1848; but since it was a windy month, they were not unduly disturbed. OnFriday 31 March, the family decided to retire early to make up for lost sleep.Mr Fox went round the house checking the shutters and sashes. The childrenobserved that when he shook the sashes, to see how loose they were, bangingnoises seemed to reply like an echo.The whole family slept in two beds in the same room. Just before the parentscame to bed, the rapping noises started again. Kate said cheekily: ‘MrSplitfoot, do as I do’, and began snapping her fingers. To the amazement of thegirls, the raps imitated her. Margaret interrupted: ‘Do as I do’, and began toclap. Again, the sounds imitated her. Remembering that the next day would beApril the first, the children decided that someone was playing a joke. In heraccount of what happened, Mrs Fox wrote:I then thought I could put a test that no one in the place could answer. I askedthe noise to rap my different children’s ages, successively. Instantly, each oneof my children’s ages was given correctly, pausing between them sufficientlylong to individualise them until the seventh [child], at which a longer pausewas made, and then three more emphatic little raps were given, corresponding tothe age of the little one that died …Now rather frightened — this was evidently no joke — Mrs Fox asked if it was ahuman being who was making the raps; there was no reply. ‘Is it a spirit?’ If itis, make two raps.’ Two thunderous bangs followed, so loud that the house shook.She asked if it was an ‘injured spirit’, and again the bangs shook the house.Further questioning revealed that the knocker was a man who died at the age of31, that he had been murdered in the house, and that he had a wife and fivechildren. Mrs Fox asked if the spirit had any objection to her calling in theneighbours; the raps replied: ‘No.’The Foxes summoned in about fourteen neighbours. One of these was a man calledWilliam Duesler, who assured his own wife that the whole thing was ridiculousand that there could be nothing mysterious about the noises. When he got there,some of the neighbours were too nervous to go into the bedroom, but Duesler wasnot worried. He went and sat on the bed, and was astonished when Mrs Fox’squestions were answered with a rapping noise that made the bed vibrate. (Laterwriters were to insist that the two children made all the noises by crackingtheir joints; but it is hard to see how the cracking of joints could make thehouse shake and cause a bed to vibrate.)Duesler took up the questioning of the ‘spirit’. By a code of knocks, heestablished that the entity was a man who had been murdered in the house, apedlar named Charles B. Rosma, who had been attacked for the $500 he carried.The murder had taken place five years earlier, and had been committed by the manwho was then the tenant of the house, a Mr Bell. A maid named Lucretia Pulverlater confirmed that a pedlar had spent the night in the house, and that she hadbeen sent home; when she returned the next day, the pedlar had gone.As news of these amazing occurrences spread throughout the community, hundredsof people came to the house. On Sunday 2 April, Duesler learned from themurdered man that his body had been buried in the cellar. This seemed to offer amethod of verification, and James Fox and his neighbours took shovels to thecellar — which had an earth floor — and proceeded to dig. At a depth of threefeet they encountered water, and abandoned the attempt. But in July, when thewater had gone down, they dug again, and at a depth of five feet found a plank;underneath this, in quicklime, there was some human hair and a few bones.Mr Bell, on being heard that he had been accused of murder by a ghost,indignantly denied it, and produced a testimonial to his good character from hisnew neighbours in Lyon, New York. The spirit had already prophesied that themurderer would never be brought to justice.In his account of the case in Modern Spiritualism, the sceptical Frank Podmorecomments: ‘No corroborative evidence of the supposed murder, or even of theexistence of the man supposed to have been murdered, was ever obtained.’ Thiswas written in 1902. Two years later, in November 1904, a wall in the cellar ofthe Fox house collapsed, revealing another wall behind it. Digging between thetwo walls uncovered a skeleton and a pedlar’s tin box. It looked as if someonehad dug up the body from its original grave and interred it next to the wall,then built another wall to confuse searchers.In those days immediately after the first manifestations, a committee was set upto collect the statements of witnesses. Not all the investigators were convincedthat the sounds had a supernatural origin; but no one suggested that the Foxfamily could be responsible. With the family all together in the same room, itwas obviously impossible that either the parents or the children could becausing the bangs.What everyone soon noticed was that nothing happened unless the children were inthe house — particularly Kate. A committee of sceptical Rochester citizens cameto the house to investigate; they agreed that Margaret was certainly notresponsible. A second, a third investigation produced the same result. Thechildren were stripped and searched to see if they had some mechanical devicefor producing the sounds; there was nothing. They were made to stand on pillowswith their ankles tied; still the raps occurred.The children were separated; Kate was sent to stay with her elder sister Leah inRochester, and Margaretta with her brother David in Auburn. The ‘spirits’followed them both. Rapping noises were heard, and people felt themselvestouched by invisible hands. In Leah’s house, a lodger called Calvin Brown took amildly satirical attitude towards the spirit, and it began to persecute him,throwing things at him. Mrs Fox’s cap was pulled off and the comb pulled out ofher hair. When members of the family knelt to pray, pins were jabbed into them.In brother David’s boarding house, similar things were happening. It was clearthat the murdered pedlar was not responsible for all this — he was back in theHydeville house, making terrifying gurgling noises and sounds like a body beingdragged across the floor. Mrs Fox’s hair turned white. One spirit whocommunicated with Kate claimed to be a dead relative named Jacob Smith. SisterLeah Fish discovered that she could also communicate with the spirits, and beganproducing messages. One sixteen-year-old girl named Harriet Bebee, who visitedthe house in Auburn and witnessed the rapping noises, returned to her hometwenty miles away and found that the noises had followed her.The Fox family moved to Rochester, but the manifestations continued. Sometimesthe bangs were so loud that they could be heard miles away. Poltergeists hadapparently taken over from the original ‘injured spirit’. One day, a visitornamed Isaac Post started asking the spirit questions, and was answered by athunderous barrage of knocks. Then, by means of an alphabetical code, the‘spirit’ spelled out a message: ‘Dear friends, you must proclaim this truth tothe world. This is the dawning of a new era; you must not try to conceal it anylonger. God will protect you and good spirits will watch over you.’ And nowbegan a series of manifestations that were to become typical of ‘Spiritualism’.*Tables moved and rapped with their legs; musical instruments were played byunseen fingers, objects moved round the room. The ‘spirits’ intimated that theywould prefer to manifest themselves in the dark — which confirmed the scepticsin their opinion. But other believers decided it was time to put the ‘spirit’ ’sinjunction into operation and ‘proclaim this truth to the world’. On 14 November1849, the first Spiritualist meeting took place in the Corinthian hall inRochester.In his account of the haunting of Willington Mill, the local historian, M. A.Richardson, had remarked:Were we to draw an inference from the number of cases of reported visitationsfrom the invisible world that have been made public of late, we might be led toimagine that the days of supernatural agency were about to recommence, and thatghosts and hobgoblins were about to resume their sway over the fears of mankind.For 1840, that was a remarkably perceptive observation. Whether it was merelydue to improved communications and the increase in the number of newspapers, itdoes seem clear that there was an apparent increase in ghostly manifestations atabout this period. In retrospect, it looks oddly as if the ‘spirits’ had decidedthat the time had come to make themselves noticed. Of course, there had beensuch manifestations for centuries — the Elizabethan astrologer Dr John Deedevoted a large book to an account of his communications with spirits throughthe agency of a ‘scryer’ (or, as they later came to be called, medium) calledEdward Kelley. Cases like the Epworth poltergeist, the Stockwell poltergeist(described by Mrs Crowe), the Cock Lane ghost and the phantom drummer ofTedworth* had aroused widespread excitement and been the subject of contemporarypamphlets. In 1847, a young American shoemaker named Andrew Jackson Davis wasplaced under hypnosis and wrote an extraordinary and erudite work called ThePrinciples of Nature which subsequently became a literary sensation. In thisremarkable book, Davis prophesies that ‘the truth about spirits will ‘ere longpresent itself in the form of a living demonstration, and the world will hailwith delight the ushering in of that era when the interiors of men will beopened’. Within four years of its publication, Spiritualism had spread acrossAmerica and was sweeping Europe.For whatever reason, the Fox sisters began a Spiritualist explosion. Peoplediscovered that all they had to do was to sit in a darkened room, preferablywith a ‘medium’ present — someone who had already established a communicationwith the spirits — and the manifestations would usually follow immediately. Noapparatus was required, except possibly a few musical instruments. In theRochester area, more than a hundred ‘mediums’ appeared in the year 1850. InBuffalo, New York, two brothers and a sister named Davenport attended a seanceat which the Fox sisters produced their manifestations, and decided to try itthemselves — in fact, inexplicable raps and bangs had sounded in their home inthe year 1846, two years before the Hydesville manifestations. When Ira, Williamand Elizabeth Davenport sat in a darkened room, with their hands on a tabletop,the table began to move, raps were heard all over the room, and when Ira pickedup a pencil his hand began to write automatically. A few nights later, withwitnesses present, all three children were seen to levitate into the air. Attheir fifth ‘seance’, Ira was instructed — by means of raps — to fire a pistolin the corner of the room. As it exploded, it was taken from his hand, and bythe light of the flash, a figure of a man was seen holding it. He vanished amoment later, and the pistol fell to the floor. The man introduced himself —through the code of raps — as John King; he was one of the first examples of a‘control’ (or master of ceremonies), who acted as intermediary between themedium and the ‘spirits’. ‘John King’ was soon taking over the brothers directlyand speaking through their mouths. The Davenport brothers went on to become evenmore famous than the Fox sisters.In Dover, Ohio, a well-to-do farmer named Jonathan Koons discovered his owntalents as a medium by sitting in a dark room and going into a trance. The‘spirits’ who spoke through him told him that all his eight children were giftedmediums. They instructed him to build a special house made of logs, sixteen feetby twelve, to be used exclusively for spiritualist activities. There were largenumbers of musical instruments — drums, triangles, tambourines, a banjo, anaccordion, a harp, a guitar, and so on. The room was dimly lighted by sheets ofwet paper smeared with phosphorus. When the mediums — usually Koons and hiseighteen-year-old son Nahum — were seated at a small table — with the audienceon benches — Koons would play the violin, and the spirits would soon join in,producing the effect of a full orchestra. Witnesses also speak of a heavenlychoir joining in. The racket was impressive, and could be heard a mile away. Avoice would then deliver a homily, using a speaking trumpet, which floated inthe air. A spirit hand floated round the room, touching people and shaking theirhands. People came from all over the county to witness these marvels, and thespirits impressed everyone by producing information about strangers that none ofthe audience could have known.This was, in fact, one of the most convincing things about the ‘spirits’; theyseemed to have access to all kinds of information. In Boston, the wife of anewspaper editor, Mrs W. R. Hayden, startled the wife of the Englishmathematician, Augustus de Morgan, by giving her detailed messages from deadfriends about whom she could not possibly have known. The result was that Mrs deMorgan invited her to England, where she held seances under ‘test conditions’ inthe de Morgans’ home. She was loudly ridiculed by the English newspapers, whowere convinced that this latest American craze must be based on fraud anddeception (which the British were too sensible to swallow), but she convincedmost of those who actually saw her. And respectable members of the Britishmiddle classes who tried ‘table-turning’ to while away the long evenings wereamazed to discover that it actually worked. One journalist wrote a few yearslater: ‘In those days you were invited to “Tea and Table Moving” as a newexcitement, and made to revolve with the family like mad round articles offurniture.’ Even Queen Victoria and Prince Albert tried it at Osborne, and thetable moved so convincingly that the queen had no doubt whatever that notrickery was involved — she decided that the answer must lie in some form ofelectricity or magnetism.The French were more than prepared to adopt this new form of entertainment, forhalf a century of controversy about Mesmer — who had taught that healing,clairvoyance and other such mysteries were due to a mysterious force called‘Animal Magnetism’ — had accustomed them to strange phenomena; by 1851,table-turning had become the latest craze. And the spirits soon made a highlyinfluential convert. He was a fifty-year-old educationalist namedDenizard-Hyppolyte-Leon Rivail, who was to become famous under the name AllanKardec. Rivail had been a pupil of the celebrated educator Pestalozzi, and hehad opened his own school at the age of twenty-four. He had written popularbooks on arithmetic, grammar, spelling, how to calculate in your head, andeducational reform, and given immensely successful courses of free lectures onastronomy, chemistry, physics and anatomy. He was also an enthusiastic studentof phrenology and Animal Magnetism.It was in May 1855 that Rivail attended a hypnotic session with a certain MadameRoger, who was placed in a trance by her ‘magnetiser’, M. Fortier, and was ableto read minds and perform other puzzling feats. There Rivail met a certainMadame Plainemaison, who told him that even stranger phenomena were taking placeregularly at her house in the rue Grange-Bateliere. Rivail agreed to go, and wasamazed by what he saw. The tables did more than merely ‘turn’; they also jumpedand ran about the room. The disciple of Mesmer felt that these phenomenachallenged the powers of reason to which he had devoted his life, and hedetermined to try to get to the bottom of it. At Madame Plainemaison’s, he met aman named Baudin, who told him that his two daughters practised automaticwriting. The young ladies seem to have discovered their powers accidentally, inthe course of entertaining their friends with table-turning; they were, says onecommentator, ‘of a worldly and frivolous disposition’. This did not deter theserious-minded Rivail, who proceeded to ask the table major philosophicalquestions. Asked if mankind would ever understand the first principles of theuniverse, it replied, ‘No. There are things that cannot be understood by man inthis world.’ When Rivail asked if matter had always existed, the table replied(perhaps a trifle wearily) ‘God only knows.’It was obvious to Rivail that the entities who were communicating were genuinespirits, not the unconscious minds of the young ladies. (Even in those days, theconcept of the unconscious was accepted.) In fact, the communicators identifiedthemselves as ‘spirits of genii’, and said that some of them (but not all) hadbeen the spirits of those who had been alive on earth.With excitement, Rivail realised that this material had an impressiveinner-consistency, and that the total pattern revealed a philosophical schemethat embraced the whole universe. Other friends who had been collecting‘automatic scripts’ — including the playwright Sardou — handed over their ownmaterial to Rivail — more than fifty notebooks. And Rivail was told to bring allthis material together into a book, which should be called The Spirits’ Book.The spirits even gave Rivail the pseudonym under which he should publish thework: Allan Kardec; both of these names — according to the spirits — were nameshe had borne in previous incarnations. When it appeared in 1856, The Spirits’Book achieved instant celebrity, and swiftly became a classic of Spiritualism(or Spiritism, as Kardec preferred to call it).The message of The Spirits’ Book is easily summarised. Man is a fourfold being,made up of body, ‘vital principle’ (aura), intelligent soul and spiritual soul —the divisions we have already encountered in the Seeress of Prevorst and inSteiner. Spirits are intelligent beings, who constitute the ‘population of theuniverse’. Man is a spirit enclosed in a physical body. The destiny of allspirits is to evolve towards perfection. There are three basic categories ofspirit: the ‘low spirits’, who are trapped in materiality, the ‘second degreespirits’, whose moral nature has evolved to the point where they experience onlya desire for good, and the ‘perfect spirits’, who have reached the peak of theirevolution. The ‘low spirits’ range from evil spirits who are activated by maliceto mere ‘boisterous spirits’ who enjoy getting into mischief. These latter arealso known as poltergeists. After death, a spirit spends some time in the spiritworld, and is then reincarnated on earth or some other world. The purpose ofearthly life is to enable the spirit to evolve. To some extent, the spirit isable to choose the trials it will undergo in its next life. (This means that itis pointless to bemoan our lot, since we have chosen it ourselves.)In all but one respect, Kardec’s ‘spirit teaching’ agreed basically with thoseof most other spiritualists since Swedenborg; but that one aspect,reincarnation, was to prove a source of severe contention within the Frenchspiritualist movement. The Spirits’ Book had already been anticipated by a workcalled Arcanes de la vie future dévoilée — Secrets of the Future Life Unveiled,by Alphonse Cahagnet, published in 1848 (and a second and third volume later).Cahagnet was a cabinet maker who had become fascinated by ‘somnambulism’(hypnotism) in his mid-thirties; he placed various subjects in a hypnotic trance— the most impressive being a woman called Adèle Maginot — and recorded whatthey told him of life after death. Adèle was so remarkable because her messagesfrom the dead — and sometimes from living people who had disappeared — were sofull of convincing evidence. Cahagnet started a journal called The SpiritualistMagnetiser, and this was later transformed into The Spiritualist Revue, editedby Z. Piérart. But Cahagnet, who was a follower of Swedenborg, did not believein reincarnation. And the French spiritualist movement was soon split by abitter war of words between the followers of Cahagnet and the followers ofKardec. Kardec was critical of trance mediums — like Adèle — because they hadnothing to say about reincarnation, and Cahagnet and his followers regardedautomatic writing with suspicion and disdain. But Kardec, who had heartproblems, died in 1869, only thirteen years after The Spirits’ Book waspublished, while Cahagnet lived and flourished until 1885, publishing many moreinfluential books. So it was Kardec’s version of spiritualism that graduallyfaded away as the movement became increasingly powerful. It was only in Brazil —a country whose witch doctors frequently called on the spirits for magical aid —that Kardec’s version of Spiritism took root, and where it still flourishestoday as one of the country’s major religions.It may be as well, at this point, to pause and ask the question: What does itall mean? There is something about ‘spiritualism’ that is peculiarly irritating.It is one thing to accept that some people, like Rosalind Heywood, possessstrange powers of clairvoyance, and quite another to swallow ‘spirit teachings’that sound like the ramblings of an uninspired Sunday school teacher. It is notthat the doctrines of Swedenborg or Kardec are in themselves unacceptable. Thenotion that man possesses a ‘vital body’, an astral body and an ego-body seemsreasonable enough; some may even learn, through self-observation, to distinguishbetween the promptings of the ‘low self and the detached observations of somehigher part of us that looks down ironically on our sufferings and humiliations.But when Kardec tells us that God created spirits, and then set them the task ofevolving towards perfection, it sounds boringly abstract. Why did God bother tocreate spirits in the first place? Why did he not create them perfect in thefirst place? And surely spirits ought to have something better to do than tocommunicate with their living relatives through ‘mediums’ and deliveranticlimactic messages about the joys of the afterlife and the trivial problemsof the living? If we compare the revelations of spiritualism with those ofscience or philosophy, or the visions of the great mystics, they seem oddlybanal …This explains why spiritualism aroused such instant hostility among scientistsand philosophers. Spiritualism was like a volcanic explosion of belief; thescientists replied with a blast of scepticism that was like cold water. And thecombination of boiling lava and cold water produced an enormous cloud of steamthat obscured everything. It was not that most scientists disbelieved theevidence: they refused even to look at it. T. H. Huxley expressed the generalfeeling when he remarked: ‘It may all be true, for anything that I know to thecontrary, but really I cannot get up interest in the subject.’Such an attitude can hardly be defended as scientific. For anyone who has anhour to spare, the evidence is seen to be overwhelming. There are hundreds —thousands — of descriptions of out-of-the-body experiences, of poltergeists, of‘apparitions of the dead’, of accurate glimpses of the future. Any reasonableperson ought to be prepared to come to terms with these, not to dismiss themwith the comment: ‘I really cannot get up any interest in the subject.’Can we come to terms with them without making any commitment to life-after-deathor the existence of ‘spirits’? Just about. Consider, for example, the hauntingof Willington Mill. One interesting point that emerged was that the maleapparition walked across the room several feet above the ground, at the level ofthe window sill. This suggests that it was walking on a floor that had now beendemolished. And we know that the millhouse was built on the site of an olderhouse. It looks as if Sir Oliver Lodge’s ‘tape recording’ theory can explainthis particular ghost. We also observe that the house was at the bottom of avalley, next to a stream, and therefore almost certainly damp. T. C. Lethbridgesuggested that ghosts are ‘recordings’ on the electrical field of water, and arefound most frequently in damp places …We may also note the comment of the local historian that although the mill wasbuilt around 1800, no haunting was recorded until the disturbances experiencedby Mr Proctor’s family — a family of young children. Later in the nineteenthcentury, investigators of poltergeist phenomena observed that children areusually present, and that one of them often seems to be the ‘focus’ of thedisturbance — indeed, we may recall that the Rev. Samuel Wesley noticed that hisdaughter Hetty trembled in her sleep before ‘Old Jeffrey’ began banging around.Split-brain physiology has taught us that we have two people inside our heads.Perhaps ‘Old Jeffrey’ was some kind of manifestation of Hetty Wesley’sunconscious mind or right brain?In fact, this plausible theory of psychic phenomena was put forward later in thenineteenth century by a brilliant newspaper editor, Thomson Jay Hudson, in abook called The Law of Psychic Phenomena (1893). Hudson was fascinated byhypnotism, and by the unusual powers that people can develop under hypnosis. Hebecame convinced that man has two ‘selves’, which he called the Objective Mindand the Subjective Mind. The objective mind is the part of us that deals witheveryday problems — the left brain. The subjective mind is turned inward; itcontrols our inner being, what goes on inside us. Normally, the subjective mindis impressed and overawed by the objective mind, so it hardly dares to expressitself. But when the objective mind is put to sleep by a hypnotist, thesubjective mind can reveal its hidden powers. In the late years of thenineteenth century, a hypnotist named Carl Hansen used to go around America, andhis favourite trick was to make someone so rigid that he could be placed acrosstwo chairs like a plank — his head on one and his heels on the other — while theheavy Hansen jumped up and down on his stomach. Such things as these, saidHudson, were the very least of the powers of the subjective mind (or, as wewould say, right brain). The subjective mind can perform miracles — in fact, themiracles of Jesus were probably merely the manifestation of his ‘subjectivemind’. It is the subjective mind, said Hudson, that is responsible for suchmysterious phenomena as telepathy and clairvoyance.He then turns his attention to ‘spiritism’. The phenomena, he admits, areundeniable. But they are not produced by the spirits of the dead. What producesthe phenomena is ‘essentially a human intelligence, and neither rises above norsinks below the ordinary intelligence of humanity’. And this is why spiritualismis so oddly boring and disappointing — because it is, as Nietzsche would say,‘human, all too human’. ‘… we have already seen what remarkable powers thesubjective mind possesses in certain lines of intellectual activity, and withwhat limitations it is hedged about; and we find that the intellectual feats ofmediums possess all the characteristics belonging to subjective intelligence —the same wonderful powers and the same limitations’.It is a convincing theory, and surprisingly ‘modern’; in all the years since TheLaw of Psychic Phenomena appeared, nothing more plausible or ‘scientific’ hasbeen advanced. But does it really cover all the facts? Hudson’s solution to theproblem of spirits is that ‘the subjective mind of the medium, being controlledby suggestion, believes itself to be the spirit of any deceased person whosename is suggested’. But this fails to explain cases — like Swedenborg’s case ofthe ‘secret drawer’ mentioned in Chapter One — where the medium was able toproduce information that was only known to the dead person. And how did SirAlexander Ogston, (as mentioned in Chapter Two), know that the R.A.M.C. surgeonhad died in another part of the hospital, unless his mind had, in some sense,left his body and wandered around the hospital? We might explain these cases —and many others like them — by some form of telepathy: perhaps Ogston’s mindpicked up the death-throes of the surgeon, perhaps Swedenborg contacted the mindof the carpenter who made the desk with the secret drawer … But the explanationsare becoming absurdly complicated, and they violate the principle known inphilosophy as Occam’s razor, which states that, in trying to solve a problem, itis best to look for the simplest and most economical explanation. It seems, onthe whole, more straightforward to accept the possibility of life after death —or the spirit’s independence of the body — as a working hypothesis.The other major objection to spiritualism — that it somehow ‘reduces’ thespiritual to the material — was expressed by Dean Inge when he wrote: ‘Themoment we are asked to accept scientific evidence for spiritual truth, thealleged spiritual truth becomes neither spiritual nor true. It is degraded intoan event in the phenomenal world.’* And, oddly enough, Rudolf Steiner agreedwith him, remarking: ‘The spiritualists are the greatest materialists of all.’This sounds baffling, in view of the fact that Steiner not only accepted thereality of life after death, but of reincarnation as well.The explanation is important, and accounts for the general feeling of hostilitythat is so often aroused by Spiritualism. One of Steiner’s basic doctrines wasthat ‘the supersensible world appears to us in such a way that it resembles ourperceptions of the sense world’.** So that he says of Swedenborg:He was a man who, in the time of dawning natural science, had become accustomedonly to recognise the sensible, the visible … Since he insisted on recognisingas true only what he could calculate and perceive with his senses … he drew downthe supersensible world into a lower sphere under the influence of his habits ofnatural science.***What Steiner is saying here is something that soon dawns on most readers ofaccounts of near-death experiences. Some find themselves walking towards acelestial city, some find themselves in flowery meadows, some find themselvesdrawn towards a heavenly gateway or a whirlpool of light. It looks as ifeveryone is interpreting the experience in terms of their own familiar concepts.Steiner is suggesting that visionaries like Swedenborg, who have caught aglimpse of the ‘supersensible world’, are bound to interpret it according totheir ingrained mental habits, and that this explains why the revelations ofspiritualism often seem slightly ludicrous.Oddly enough, Steiner thoroughly approved of Kardec, who obtained the materialfor his books from automatic writing. This clearly suggests that what Steinerdisliked so much about Spiritualism was its literal-mindedness — the trumpetsand accordions floating through the air, the tables dancing around the room, thespirits made of ectoplasm. His attitude could be compared to that of a Christianmystic who wishes to explain that heaven is not full of angels sitting around onclouds and playing harps.At the same time, there is bound to be an element of unfairness in such anattitude. Many mediums who started off by producing automatic writing laterbecame ‘voice mediums’, and some even ‘materialisation mediums’. It isimpossible to draw a sharp line between them. Steiner is not really criticisingSpiritualism; he is criticising spiritualists. Once we have grasped this, one ofthe major problems disappears — or at least, is revealed as a misunderstanding.It was a misunderstanding that caused a great deal of trouble and bitterness inthe early days of Spiritualism. It was useless for investigators like CatherineCrowe and Allan Kardec to demand a fair hearing for the ‘supernatural’;scientists and intellectuals felt they were being asked to swallow a farrago ofchildish nonsense. They pointed angrily at the Spiritualist churches that werespringing up all over America, and asked how anybody could be serious about areligion started by two silly girls. Their scepticism seemed to be justified inApril 1851, when a relative of the Fox family, a certain Mrs Norman Culver,announced in the New York Herald that Kate and Margaretta Fox had shown her howthey made the rapping noises with their knees and toes. This may or may not havebeen true. The girls — and their mother — had become celebrities, and spent agreat deal of time travelling around the East coast giving demonstrations. Fatehad promoted them from the boredom of small-town life in upper New York State tothe equivalent of stardom. If the spirits were occasionally uncooperative, itwould have been surprising if they had not been tempted to do a little cheating.What seems perfectly clear is that the original phenomena — bangs that werestrong enough to make the house vibrate — could not have been caused by crackingthe joints of the knees. Neither could Kate and Margaretta have answered all thequestions about the people in the room. The accusations of fraud were just onemore excuse for refusing to look dispassionately at the evidence.The real tragedy in all this was that the cloud of polemical steam obscured agreat deal of serious research into the paranormal. In the 1840s, a Germanscientist named Baron Karl von Reichenbach had rediscovered Mesmer’s recognitionthat human beings can be affected by magnets. Reichenbach found that sick peopleseemed to be more sensitive to magnetism than healthy ones, and his ‘sicksensitives’ could see different colours streaming out of the two poles of themagnet — red from the south pole, blue from the north. They could detect thesame emanations in crystals. And — most important — they could see it streamingfrom the finger-ends of human beings. Reichenbach called it ‘odyle’ or ‘the odicforce’, and the announcement of his discovery caused widespread excitement whenhe first made it in 1845. What Reichenbach had really discovered was the human‘life field’, investigated in the 1930s by Harold Burr and F. S. C. Northrop.But by 1850, the rise of spiritualism made scientists feel that any kind of‘unseen force’ was suspect; Reichenbach suddenly found himself as discreditedand ridiculed as Mesmer.Joseph Rodes Buchanan was a professor of medicine in Kentucky, who was intriguedwhen a bishop told him he could detect brass when he touched it — even in thedark — because it produced a bitter taste in his mouth. Buchanan tested hisstudents with various chemicals wrapped in brown paper packages, and found thatmany of them could distinguish them by touch. He concluded that we have a ‘nerveaura’ streaming from the ends of our fingers, and that this can ‘taste’ things,just like the tongue. Then he discovered that some of his best subjects couldhold an unopened letter in their hands, and ‘sense’ the mood of the writer — infact, some of them could describe the writer with remarkable accuracy.Now all this fits in perfectly with Sir Oliver Lodge’s ‘tape recording’ theoryabout ghosts — that strong emotions can ‘imprint’ themselves on theirsurroundings, and that this ‘recording’ can be detected by people who aresensitive to such things. Buchanan’s subjects were virtually human bloodhounds.Buchanan called this strange faculty ‘psychometry’, and his book about itaroused widespread interest in 1848. It caused a professor of geology namedWilliam Denton to try similar experiments on his students, using geologicalspecimens. The results were astounding.* Lumps of volcanic lava brought visionsof exploding mountains, mastodons’ teeth visions of primeval forests, meteoritesvisions of the depths of space. Denton believed that he had discovered a‘telescope into the past’, an unknown faculty through which man can travelbackwards in time. Regrettably, no one paid much attention to Denton’s book TheSoul of Things, nor to Buchanan’s Manual of Psychometry. Such things sounded toomuch like Spiritualism, and any scientist who took them seriously would havecondemned himself to ridicule.To some extent, spiritualists were themselves to blame for all this hostility.They were too gullible, too prone to accept any banal nonsense as a message from‘the other side’. Hundreds of fake mediums took advantage of their credulity topractise barefaced impositions, and whenever one of them was caught in the act,scientists shook their heads wearily and made comparisons with the mediaevalwitchcraft phenomenon. Most of them had become too blasé even to say ‘I told youso.’ Genuine mediums like the Davenport brothers did themselves no good byappearing in theatres and performing hair-raising feats of escapology that wouldhave done credit to Houdini. They allowed themselves to be tied so tight thatthe ropes cut into their flesh and caused bruises; but after a brief period in acabinet, they would step out with the ropes around their feet. ProfessorBenjamin Pierce, a member of an investigating committee, sat between them in thecabinet. As soon as the door was closed, a hand shot the bolt — both brotherswere trussed up like mummies — and briefly felt the professor’s face beforegoing on to untie the brothers. Professor Loomis of the Georgetown MedicalCollege admitted that the manifestations were produced by a force with which hewas unacquainted. But this kind of testimony meant nothing compared to the factthat the brothers appeared on the same bill with conjurors and acrobats.All this explains why so little was achieved by the most remarkable medium ofthe nineteenth century — perhaps of all time — Daniel Dunglas Home. Homeretained his powers for more than a quarter of a century, with the exception ofa period of one year when, as we shall see, the ‘spirits’ decided to punish him.He performed his astonishing feats in broad daylight. He caused heavy articlesof furniture to float up to the ceiling; he himself floated out of one windowand in at another; he washed his face in blazing coals; he could make himselfseveral inches taller at will. He was tested dozens of times by committees ofsceptics, and was never once caught out in anything that looked like fraud. Yetposterity remembers him chiefly as the man Dickens called ‘that scoundrel Home’,and about whom Robert Browning wrote a scurrilous poem called ‘Mr Sludge theMedium’.A typical Home seance is amusingly described by his biographer Jean Burton. Ittook place on an evening in January 1863, in the fashionable home of MadameJauvin d’Attainville, and the guests included Princess Metternich and herhusband, the Austrian ambassador. The guests — fifteen in all — sat at the tablein the magnificent second empire drawing room, while Home sat in an armchairthree or four yards away. When everyone was ready, he sat back in his chair,became paler, and went into a light trance. He asked ‘Bryan, are you there?’(Bryan being his spirit guide). Sharp raps came from the table, the chandeliersbegan to swing, and a chair moved of its own accord across the room and stoppedin front of the guests. At the same moment, Princess Metternich screamed, as shefelt a powerful but invisible hand grip hers. Others also felt hands lightlytouching them. (All this was in a room ‘blazing with light’.) The tapestrytablecloth now rose into the air, and underneath it, something seemed to bemoving, like a hand or a small animal, towards them. This was too much for themen, most of whom were sceptics; Prince Metternich dived under the cloth andtried to grab the ‘creature’; there was nothing. One of the men pulled the clothaway, while others dived under the table to find the source of the raps; again,they were disappointed. As they scrambled out again, a hailstorm of rapssounded, as if in derision. The angry Prince Metternich was now convinced thatthey were coming from under the table, and scrambled underneath again. Rapssounded, and Metternich yelled indignantly: ‘No jokes, please!’ The companyassured him that they were not responsible.Apparently in a trance, Home pointed to a corsage of violets on the piano andasked that it should be brought over to them. The violets glided across thepiano, floated unsteadily across the room, and fell into the princess’s lap.Prince Metternich bounded forward and grabbed them, then proceeded to search forthe thread that he was convinced must be attached; he found nothing.In a faint voice, Home now demanded an accordion, a popular instrument of theperiod. When it came, the princess was asked to stand alone in the middle of theroom with the instrument held high above her head. As she stood there, her armin the air, an expression of astonishment crossed her face. There was a tug onthe accordion, and it proceeded to play, moving in and out. What impressedeveryone was that it was a fine performance, the playing so soft and melodiousthat it brought tears to the eyes of some of the audience. After that, anythingwould have been an anticlimax, so the seance finished. But, typically, the menbegan to speculate how it had been done; no one seemed to doubt that it had beensome form of conjuring trick; others spoke of electro-biology and mass hypnosis.The princess had to admit that she had no sensation of being hypnotised …Daniel Dunglas Home (he pronounced it Hume) was born near Edinburgh in March1833 — his mother was a highlander and had a reputation as a ‘seer’. He wasprobably illegitimate — he liked to claim that his father was Lord Home. At theage of nine, he moved to America with an aunt, Mary Cook, and her husband. Hismother and ‘father’, and seven brothers and sisters, were already there. Danielsuffered from tuberculosis, and was subject to fainting fits — a typical ‘sicksensitive’. His closest friend was a boy called Edwin, and they went for longwalks in the woods of Connecticut. They made a boyish pact — that whoever diedfirst would show himself to the other. In 1846, when Daniel was thirteen, hetold his aunt and uncle that he had just seen Edwin standing at the foot of hisbed, and that the figure had made three circles in the air with his hand — whichDaniel took to mean that he had died three days ago. It proved to be true.There were no more supernatural experiences for another four years; then Homesaw a vision of his mother, and knew she was dead. Soon after that, he wasbrushing his hair when he saw, in the glass, a chair moving across the roomtowards him. He was terrified and rushed out of the house. In bed, he wasawakened by three loud bangs on the headboard. The next morning at breakfast,when his aunt was mildly teasing him about tiring himself out by attending toomany prayer meetings (Home was a religious young man), raps sounded from allover the table, and his alarmed aunt cried: ‘So you’ve brought the devil into myhouse, have you?’, and threw a chair at him. The Baptist minister was called into pray the devil away but had difficulty in making himself heard about the hailof knocks. Unaware that poltergeist phenomena are usually harmless, his auntrequested him to leave her house. So, at the age of seventeen, Home had to fendfor himself.But Home had such charm and gaiety that there were dozens of acquaintances whowere delighted to offer him hospitality. And the spirits gave him their fullsupport. He went easily into trance, and in that state talked fluently in Frenchand Italian — neither of them languages in which he had become proficient. Hecould not have chosen a better time to launch himself on the world, witheveryone in the United States talking about spirits. An evangelist named DrGeorge Bush — a professor of oriental languages — persuaded him that he ought tobecome a Swedenborgian and use his considerable preaching talent in the pulpit;Home agreed, then came back two days later to say that his dead mother hadexpressly forbidden it, telling him that he had a ‘more extended’ mission.Looked after by the ‘spirits’, and by kindly acquaintances, Home wandered aroundthrough New England, always a welcome guest in the homes of the well-off middleclasses; his pale good looks brought out the protectiveness in middle-agedladies. In Springfield, Mass., he stayed at the home of a wealthy citizen namedRufus Elmers, and agreed to be investigated by a delegation from Harvard,including the poet William Cullen Bryant. They, like many other ‘delegations’after them, had no doubt about the genuineness of the phenomena. The table notonly ‘rapped’ and floated off the floor, but stood on two legs like a circushorse while three members of the committee sat on it and tried to force it downagain. The floor vibrated to shocks that were as powerful as cannon fire. Allthis took place in broad daylight, and members of the committee held Home’shands and feet while most of the phenomena were taking place. Their report,entitled ‘The Modern Wonder’, concluded: ‘We know that we were not imposed uponnor deceived.’ Rufus Elmers was so impressed that he offered to adopt Home andmake him his heir; Home declined with thanks.In August 1852, sitting in a circle, Home floated up to the ceiling — a featthat became virtually his trademark. And his other phenomena continued to bealmost as astonishing. Grand pianos would float across the room, bells wouldring, cymbals clash, and there would be sounds of birdsong and assorted animalnoises. One day, a table with a candle on it tilted at an angle, and the candleflame went on burning at the same angle, as if it was still resting on ahorizontal surface. On another occasion, at the home of the Rev. S. B. Brittan,he went into a trance, and a voice announced: ‘Hannah Brittan here.’ Home beganto wring his hands, and for the next half hour, talked in a wild, distracted wayabout the torments of hell. The Rev. Brittan was staggered, for he was certainthat no one knew that the lady — a relative — had been a prey to religiousmania, and had died insane, obsessed by visions of eternal punishment. (On asubsequent appearance, Hannah Brittan told them that her present life was calm,peaceful and beautiful and that the torments of hell had been a delusion of herdistracted brain.)Most women adored Home, who was attentive and thoughtful — he loved sendingflowers on anniversaries. Men either liked him or loathed him. He had effeminatemanners, and many suspected he was homosexual. (For some odd reason, asurprising number of mediums are.) He was undoubtedly rather vain about his palegood looks and silky, auburn hair. He loved expensive clothes. He was anoutrageous snob, who took pleasure in being inaccessible. (He would onlycondescend to know people if introduced by a mutual acquaintance.) He would bemortally offended if anyone offered him money, and he resented being treated asa ‘performer’; as far as he was concerned, he was the social equal of anyone hemet, including kings. Yet he was becomingly modest about his achievement,insisting that he himself had nothing whatever to do with the phenomena. All hehad to do was to relax and put himself in the right mood (and ‘right’ isprobably here the operative word) and things simply happened.By 1855, Home’s consumptive cough had become so bad that his admirers decided heought to move to a healthier climate. For some unaccountable reason, he choseEngland. Admirers paid his passage, and with a crowd waving frantically, hesailed from Boston in March; he was just twenty-two.As usual, the spirits were looking after Home. In London, he moved into Cox’sHotel in Jermyn Street; the owner, William Cox, was a Spiritualist, and welcomedHome ‘as a father would a son’. So Home got free lodgings and an introduction tothe London society people who made regular use of the hotel. In no time at allhe was calling on marchionesses and baronesses. He went to visit the novelistLord Lytton, who made literary use of many of Home’s seance phenomena — aluminous form that dissolved into a globe, a disembodied hand, loud bangs, fierysparks — in his famous story ‘The Haunted and the Haunters’. But Lytton declinedto believe spirits were responsible; he thought the phenomena were due to Home’sunconscious mind. He became a friend of the socialist Robert Owen, who was aconvert to spiritualism, and who introduced him to his old friend Lord HenryBrougham, a Voltairean sceptic. Brougham and Sir David Brewster had a privatesession with Home at which the table rose into the air and a bell floated acrossthe room. Brewster described these things in his diary and told them to friends,but later insisted that the table had only ‘appeared’ to rise, and that Home hadprobably moved the bell with some hidden apparatus. The resulting controversybrought Home much publicity, and provided the spiritualists with some excellentammunition to use against scientific dogmatism, since Brewster’s diaries justifyHome.Elizabeth Barrett Browning called on Home, together with her husband Robert.Ghostly hands materialised, music sounded from the air, the table rapped loudlyand invisible spirits caressed them. Mrs Browning was totally convinced; herhusband — vigorous, sturdy, just over five feet tall — sat there scowling, andresolutely declined to accept the evidence of his eyes. Home became anunmentionable subject in the Browning household, and after his wife’s death,Browning wrote the flagrantly unfair ‘Mr Sludge the Medium’. He may have beenprejudiced by an episode that took place at another Home seance, when a detachedhand took up a garland of flowers and placed them on the poetess’s brow;Browning was jealous of his wife. Home made things worse by telling people thatBrowning had tried to place himself in the trajectory of the wreath so it wouldalight on his brow …By popular request of the English community, Home moved on to Florence. Therethe manifestations were stronger than ever. A grand piano floated up into theair and remained there while a countess played on it; a spirit conversed with aPolish princess in her own language; in a haunted convent, Home conversed withthe spirit of a monk — also a murderer — and caused his skinny, yellow hands tomaterialise. When the novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne came to Florence three yearslater, people were still talking about Home, and Hawthorne collected dozens ofwell-attested accounts of the phenomena. Hawthorne made the interesting andsignificant observation:These soberly attested incredibilities are so numerous that I forget nine tenthsof them … they are absolutely proved to be sober facts by evidence that wouldsatisfy us of any other alleged realities; and yet I cannot force my mind tointerest itself in them.This is perhaps one of the most important comments ever made about Home or aboutspiritualism in general.Unfortunately, Home’s success began to go to his head. He was not a particularlystrong character, and being treated as a messenger from the gods would have beenenough to unbalance a far more independent nature. When he went to stay at thevilla of a titled Englishwoman who was separated from her husband, formeradmirers were scandalised — English self-control produces a morbid fascinationwith sexual scandal — and he began to sense a new atmosphere of hostility. Hewas attacked on his way back to his hotel and slightly wounded — a sign that thespirits were becoming inefficient or lazy — and on 10 February 1856, the spiritstold him that his recent conduct was not worthy of a representative of the otherworld, and that his powers were about to leave him for a year. A Polish counthad invited him to Naples and Rome; Home felt obliged to admit to him that hispowers had deserted him. But his luck held; the count insisted that it made nodifference, and Home accompanied him to Naples. And in spite of the loss of hispowers, he remained a social lion. They came back, as the spirits hadprophesied, exactly one year to the day, on the stroke of midnight.By now Home was in Paris, and had taken the precaution of insuring himselfagainst the disapproval of the Church by becoming a Catholic. His fatherconfessor — recommended by the Pope himself — was less than enthusiastic aboutthe return of the spirits, whom he assumed to be demons — but there was littlehe could do about it. Neither would Home have wished it, for he was by now afavourite of the Emperor Napoleon III and the Empress Eugenie. His luck arousedwidespread envy and hostility, but after the year of desertion by the spirits,he no longer allowed it to go to his head.After a tour of northern Europe, he returned to Rome, where he met and wooed abeautiful seventeen-year-old Russian countess named Sacha; they went to StPetersburg (together with the novelist Dumas) and her relatives organised aspectacular wedding. Home was received by the Russian royal family as cordiallyas by Napoleon III. Unfortunately, Sacha caught his tuberculosis, and died notlong after the birth of a son. At least her death was not a separation; Home wasable to keep in constant touch with her.In 1862 his luck again seemed to desert him. The police ordered him to leaveRome, declaring that he was a sorcerer (the spirits made things worse by rappingon the desk of the police chief). For the next four years he again became awanderer. In 1866, he met an effusive and vulgar old lady with a working-classaccent, Mrs Jane Lyon, who told him she wanted to adopt him as her son, andpresented him with numerous large cheques. Home changed his name to Home-Lyon.But the two were far from soul mates, and the relationship soon began todeteriorate badly — he found her boringly affectionate and she found him cold.He had a breakdown, and fled to various watering places to take a cure. When hereturned to London, he found that Mrs Lyon had transferred her allegiance to afemale medium, and was brooding on how to recover her money. She wanted backabout thirty thousand pounds — only about half of what she had given him. Sheaccused him of extortion, and Home was arrested. At the trial in April 1868, shealleged that she had given him the money because he had brought her instructionsto that effect from her dead husband; Home’s case was that she had tried hard toseduce him after he became her ‘son’. Mrs Lyon was undoubtedly — as Homedeclared — vengeful and untruthful, and many of her lies were exposed in court.But a ‘spirit medium’ stood no chance of getting an unprejudiced trial; thejudge remarked that if everyone who gave money to a religious charity wasallowed to ask for it back, the result would be chaos; however, sincespiritualism was a fraud and a cheat he would make exception in the presentcase. Home was ordered to repay the money. The trial did Home immense damage,strengthening the impression already created by Browning’s ‘Mr Sludge’, that hewas a confidence trickster. But the notoriety had one advantage: a reading tourof England drew enormous audiences and helped to recoup his loss.During his ‘water cure’ in Malvern, Home had met a young aristocrat, Lord Adare,and during the next year or two he spent much time with him. In 1870, Adarepublished Experiences in Spiritualism with Mr D. D. Home, perhaps one of themost extraordinary and impressive books about a medium ever written. Adare wasan ordinary young Englishman, more interested in hunting, shooting and fishingthan ghosts. It was Adare who saw Home afloat out of one upper-storey window andin at another. He also saw the materialisation of various spirits — includingSacha and the American actress Ada Mencken — and all the other phenomena thatHome had been producing for the past twenty years. He saw Home stir up the fireuntil the coals were blazing, then pick them up in handfuls and rub his face inthem — neither his face nor his hair was burnt. He also witnessed Home standingagainst a wall, where his height was carefully taken (five feet ten inches),after which Home elongated himself to six foot four.In 1871, Home agreed to be investigated by the young scientist William (laterSir William) Crookes. The anti-spiritualists smiled with satisfaction; they hadno doubt whatever that Crookes would finally demolish the conjuror’s reputation.In the event, Crookes was totally convinced, and published a report to thateffect — to the disgust of his fellow scientists, who decided that he had beenduped. In the controversy that followed, Crookes exploded indignantly: ‘I didn’tsay it was possible — I said it was true.’In the following year, 1872, Home decided it was time to retire. A lawsuit abouthis wife’s estate was decided in his favour, so he was a Russian landowner. Helived on for another fourteen years, to the age of fifty-three, spending histime between Russia and the French Riviera. He was wasting away fromconsumption; but with a beautiful second wife, a comfortable income and hosts ofadmiring friends, his final years were far from unhappy.The article on Home in Encyclopedia Britannica calls Home an ‘unsolved enigma’.This is true, but not quite in the sense the writer intended. As far as Home wasconcerned, there was no enigma. He had simply inherited unusual psychic powersfrom his mother’s side of the family (and he passed these on to his son Grisha).So the spirits were able to operate through him.As we have seen, this answer failed to satisfy many people who witnessed hisfeats and accepted their genuineness. Lord Lytton thought that Home somehowcaused the phenomena himself. Most modern researchers would probably agree withhim, since most of them are unwilling to accept the spirit hypothesis. Yet onething that becomes very clear to anyone who reads the accounts of Home’sphenomena — as recorded by Lord Adare or Sir William Crookes — is that thespirits are not only the simplest explanation, but in many cases, the onlyexplanation. A large percentage of the phenomena can only be explained if weassume the existence of disembodied intelligences. And at this point, it isnecessary to acknowledge that, sooner or later, most investigators of theparanormal are finally driven to the conclusion that spirits almost certainlyexist. They do this with the utmost reluctance. It would be far more convenient,and far more logically satisfying, if we could explain all the phenomena interms of the unrecognised powers of the human mind. Total honesty forces theadmission that this is impossible. And this is nowhere more obvious than in thecase of Daniel Dunglas Home.*In Autobiography of a Yogi by Parahansa Yogananda, the author describes how avisiting Yogi had told him that a friend was on his way. When the friendarrived, he told of how the Yogi had approached him in the street, and mentionedthat Parahansa was waiting for him in his room. At the time this happened, theYogi had been with Parahansa. From the point of view of a psychicalinvestigator, the case is dubious because we have only the author’s word for it.*Ferenc Andras Volgyesi: Menschen und Tierhypnose, 1963, translated as Hypnosisof Man and Animals, London 1966.*When I speak of Spiritualism with a capital ‘S’, I refer to the ‘religion’ ofthat name; spiritualism with a small ‘s’ denotes simply the belief in spirits orlife after death.*For accounts of these cases see my book Poltergeist (1981).*Outspoken Essays, Vol. 1, p. 269, quoted by David Lorimer in Surival?, p. 160.**‘The History of Spiritism’, lecture delivered in Berlin, 30 May 1904.***Ibid.*For accounts of Reichenbach, Buchanan and Denton, see my book The PsychicDetectives: The Story of Psychometry (1984)."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURPSYCHICAL RESEARCH COMES OF AGELooking back over the history of spiritualism, it certainly looks as if the‘spirits’ made a tremendous and concerted effort to convince the Victorians oftheir reality. If that is the case, it seems equally clear that they made amiscalculation. The leaders of Victorian public opinion — politicians,intellectuals, churchmen — remained indifferent. And most scientists wereintensely hostile. In the decade after the ‘Hydesville rappings’, they made adetermined attempt to destroy spiritualism by ridicule.They were hardly to blame. If they had behaved in any other way, they would nothave been Victorians. It was their very best qualities — their sense ofexcitement about the future, about the tremendous scientific and technicaladvances, and the possibilities of humanitarian social reforms — that made themturn their backs on the ‘supernatural’. T. H. Huxley expressed this spirit in aburst of magnificent exasperation when someone tried to persuade him to attend aseance: ‘If anybody could endow me with the faculty of listening to the chatterof old women and curates in the nearest cathedral town, I should decline theprivilege, having better things to do.’But when the less waspish investigators could be persuaded to listen to the‘chatter of old women and curates’, they often found it unexpectedlyinteresting. When he started his career as a schoolmaster, Alfred Russel Wallacewas a sceptic and a disciple of Voltaire; but when he went to listen to alecture on mesmerism, he was sufficiently intrigued to try it out on hisstudents. One boy proved to be an unusually good subject. When placed in atrance, he seemed to ‘tune in’ to Wallace’s mind. When Wallace pricked himselfwith a pin, the boy cried out and put his hand on the same part of his own body;when Wallace sucked a lump of sugar, the boy also went through sucking motions.Fifteen years later, Wallace became famous as the man who had, together withCharles Darwin, discovered evolution by natural selection — and who, moreover,had allowed Darwin to take priority. In 1865, Wallace attended a seance at thehouse of a sceptical friend, and witnessed a heavy table moving and vibrating —in broad daylight — while raps resounded from around the room. That convincedhim. A year later, he met an enormous young lady named Agnes Nichols, andwatched with incredulity as the elephantine girl floated up into the air. Agnescould also produce ‘apports’ — objects that fell from the air — and when Wallaceasked if the spirits could produce a sunflower, a six-foot sunflower with a clodof earth round its roots fell on to the table. Agnes’s spirits never did thingsby halves; on another occasion when someone requested flowers, what looked likethe whole contents of a flower shop cascaded from the air. But their mostspectacular feat occurred in 1871, when Agnes herself (now married to a mancalled Guppy) became the ‘apport’. She was seated at the dining-room table doingher accounts when she vanished as if the ground had swallowed her. Four milesaway, some ardent spiritualists were seated at a table with their eyes closed,begging the spirits to vouchsafe some small manifestation. There was an almightycrash that caused screams, and when someone struck a match, the mountainous MrsGuppy was found lying on the table, still clutching her account book. But again,the spirits had miscalculated. The story of Mrs Guppy floating four milescertainly caused widespread hilarity, but it didn’t bring thousands flocking tothe Spiritualist churches.Wallace had no doubt that Mrs Guppy could convince the sceptics, so he invitedthree of the most hostile — Professor W. B. Carpenter, Professor John Tyndalland G. H. Lewes, the husband of novelist George Eliot. Carpenter came, satsilently through a cannonade of raps, then went away without comment; he nevercame back. Neither did Tyndall, whose only comment was ‘Show us something else.’Lewes simply refused to come, as did T. H. Huxley — this was the occasion whenHuxley remarked that he simply could not ‘get up an interest in the subject’.Yet in spite of the refusal of scientists to believe their own eyes and ears,psychic phenomena remained a thorn in the flesh of Victorian intellectuals.After all, it was the business of science to explain mysteries, not ignore them.Some scientists — such as William Crookes, discoverer of the element thallium —developed a bad conscience about it, and decided to conduct their owninvestigations. When Crookes saw a concertina in a cage playing music of its ownaccord, while Daniel Dunglas Home held it up by one handle, he knew that he wasdealing with unknown forces. His ‘credulity’ caused much headshaking among hiscolleagues. And later, when he decided that a young lady called Florence Cook —whose guide, Katie King, materialised and walked round the room — was genuine,some of them whispered that Florence had become Crookes’s mistress as the priceof his cooperation.The mathematician Charles Dodgson — who wrote Alice in Wonderland — was anotherwho felt that the phenomena ought to be explained, not dismissed. He wrote to afriend in 1882:That trickery will not do as a complete explanation of all the phenomena … I ammore than convinced. At the same time, I see no need as yet for believing thatdisembodied spirits have anything to do with it … All seems to point to theexistence of a natural force, allied to electricity and nerve force by whichbrain can act on brain. I think we are close to the day when this shall beclassified among the known natural forces …That was the ideal aim: to track down this unknown force and stick a label onit. This was the truly Victorian way of banishing this revival of witchcraft.The only problem was that the spirits often converted the sceptics who weretrying to disprove their existence. There was, for example, the embarrassingcase of the American Congressman Robert Dale Owen, son of the great socialreformer Robert Owen. The latter had been a lifelong freethinker — until heencountered the American medium Mrs Hayden. And then, at the age of 83, hedeclared himself a Spiritualist. His son, another freethinker and socialreformer, was furious, and decided that the old man was senile. He was, at thetime, American chargé d’affaires in Naples. In 1856, the Brazilian ambassadorpersuaded him to attend a seance in his apartment, and there Owen saw the tablemoving without human agency. It was, he decided, merely an‘electro-psychological phenomenon’. But he wanted to know how it worked. So hespent the next two years reading books on mesmerism and ‘animal magnetism’, andattending seances. He met Home, who had lost his powers at the time; but thestories of Home’s powers made him feel that he should at least consider thepossibility that spirits were responsible for the phenomena. As a result, hebecame convinced, and wrote a book called Footfalls on the Boundary of AnotherWorld that achieved the same popularity as Mrs Crowe’s Night Side of Nature.Footfalls deserved its popularity; it was an exhaustive, carefully argued book,full of the latest discoveries in modern science, and of some highly convincingcases of clairvoyance, precognitions, poltergeists and ‘phantasms of theliving’. But it is doubtful that it convinced a single scientist.What finally turned the tide in favour of spiritualism was not scientificevidence, but the deep Victorian craving for religious certainty. Nowadays thechief affliction of the intellectuals is angst, a kind of free-floating anxiety.In the Victorian age, it was Doubt with a capital ‘D’. One of the greatVictorian bestsellers was a novel called Robert Ellesmere by Mrs Humphry Ward,about a clergyman who experiences Doubts and feels obliged to resign his living.We find the idea slightly comic — Evelyn Waugh poked fun at it in Decline andFall — but that is because we take doubt for granted. We can scarcely imaginewhat it was like to be born into the blissful certainty of a respectableVictorian household — certainty about salvation, about the inspiration of theBible, about the truth of the Thirty-Nine Articles. Victorian children werebrought up to believe that Adam was created in precisely 4004 BC, and that anykind of doubt on religious matters was as disgraceful as being a drunkard or aprostitute. So when Sir Charles Lyell’s Principles of Geology (1830) argued thatthe earth was millions of years old, Victorians felt as shocked as if an activevolcano had appeared in Trafalgar Square. It was from that point that they beganto be undermined by Doubts.One of these unhappy questioners was Professor Henry Sidgwick, of TrinityCollege, Cambridge. Doubt tormented him like a nagging tooth all his life. In1869, at the age of thirty-one, he even felt obliged to resign his fellowship atTrinity because he could no longer subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles of theChurch of England. His fellow dons sympathised, and the moment the religioustests were dropped, reappointed him. He went on to write a celebrated book onethics that ended with the statement that all man’s attempts to find a rationalbasis for human behaviour are foredoomed to failure.Sidgwick’s pupils regarded him as a kind of Socrates. There were many brilliantyoung men among them, including Arthur Balfour, a future Prime Minister, EdmundGurney, heir to a Quaker fortune, and Frederick Myers, the son of a clergyman.Myers, another Fellow of Trinity, also felt obliged to resign because of Doubts.One evening in December 1869, Myers paid his old master a visit, and they wentfor a walk under the stars. It was the year in which Sidgwick had resigned hisfellowship, and inevitably, the subject of religion came up. Although neither ofthem could still call themselves Christians, neither of them could accept thatthe universe is a great machine and that human beings have been created by purechance. It was Myers who asked, with a certain desperation, whether, sincephilosophy had failed to solve the riddle of the universe, there might be just achance that the answer lay in the evidence for ghosts and spirits. Neither ofthem felt much optimism, but Sidgwick went on brooding about the idea —particularly when, in the following year, Crookes announced that he intended toinvestigate Daniel Dunglas Home. The attacks on Crookes outraged their sense offair play, and in 1873, they formed a loose association for the investigation ofspiritualism and the paranormal. Myers became a school inspector, which left himtime to attend seances. But at first he found it discouraging work; he began towonder whether there was something about him that made the spirits stay away.Then he had an experience that convinced him. He attended a seance with a mediumnamed Charles Williams — at one of whose seances Mrs Guppy had landed on thetable — and a hand materialised in the air. Myers held it in his own, and feltit grow smaller and smaller until it faded away, leaving nothing behind. Thatcould not be trickery. Myers now began seeking actively for more evidence.Together with Edmund Gurney, Arthur Balfour, Sidgwick and Lord Rayleigh — thescientist who discovered the element argon — Myers became a dedicated ‘psychicalresearcher’. They were joined by a remarkable clergyman, Stainton Moses, who wasalso an automatic writing medium. His obvious genuineness reinforced Myers’sconviction.A new impetus came from an Irish professor of physics, William Barrett, whotaught at the Royal College of Science in Dublin. Like Alfred Russel Wallace,Barrett had become interested in ‘mesmerism’, and when he was staying with afriend of County Westmeath, he persuaded some of the village children to subjectthemselves to hypnosis. Two proved to be excellent subjects, and with one ofthese, Barrett observed what Wallace had experienced with his schoolboy twodecades earlier, ‘community of sensation’. When his friend placed his own handover a lighted lamp, the girl snatched hers away as if afraid of burning. Whenhe tasted sugar, she smiled; when he tasted salt, she frowned. She also provedto be able to read Barrett’s mind. The sceptical Professor Carpenter hadexplained such phenomena by saying that people under hypnosis become abnormallysensitive, so they can recognise almost undetectable sounds or smells. But thatwould not explain how this girl could hold against her head a book containing aplaying card, and describe the card exactly.Barrett wrote a paper about the case, and sent it to the British Association inLondon. It would probably have been ignored, but it happened that Wallace waschairman of the committee that decided which papers to publish. He threw hisweight behind Barrett, and although the committee eventually overruled him,Wallace made sure that Myers saw the paper.By this time, Barrett had found another case that excited him — the family of aclergyman called Creery, who lived at Buxton, in Derbyshire. Creery’s daughterswere unusually good at playing a favourite party trick called the ‘willinggame’, in which a person went out of the room while the others decided what heought to do; when he came back, everyone had to try to ‘will’ him to do it. InBarrett’s presence, Creery’s four daughters demonstrated the ‘willing game’again and again, with hardly a single failure.Barrett met Myers and his fellow ‘psychical investigators’ in London, andsuggested that they ought to form a society for investigating these mysteries.Myers and Gurney were dubious; they felt they were already doing their best. ButBarrett’s enthusiasm prevailed, and the result was the formation of the Societyfor Psychical Research (SPR), which met for the first time in February 1882. Itsoriginal members were the ‘Cambridge group’ — Myers, Gurney, Sidgwick (and hiswife Eleanor), Balfour, Barrett, Rayleigh and Wallace. Soon They were joined bydistinguished Victorians such as Tennyson, Gladstone, J. J. Thomson (discovererof the electron), Mark Twain, William James, Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson),John Ruskin, Sir Oliver Lodge, and the painters Frederick Leighton and G. F.Watts.The Society had no objection whatever to sceptics, for its aim was to bring themethods of science to bear on the ‘psychic world’, and try to prove or disproveit once and for all. One result was that Myers and Gurney accepted with pleasurethe services of a sceptical post-office employee named Frank Podmore, whoseoriginal faith in spiritualism had been badly shaken in 1876 by the trial andsubsequent flight of a ‘slate-writing’ medium named Henry Slade. (Theanti-spiritualist Sir Ray Lankester had managed to grab the slate before the‘spirits’ had had a chance to get to work, and found a message already on it. Inspite of strong evidence in his favour, Slade was found guilty on the curiousgrounds that writing by spirits was a violation of the laws of nature, so he hadto be a fraud). The three-way collaboration produced the classic Phantasms ofthe Living (1886) which took four years to compile. The Society also produced avast Census of Hallucinations, which showed that one person in every ten hadexperienced some kind of hallucination.Now, at last, it should have been possible for the ‘spirits’ to win over thegreat majority of the British public. We have seen that mediums like Home, MrsHayden and Mrs Guppy had no problem convincing scientists once they were given afair chance. In fact, the Society did some very impressive work, establishingthe reality of apparitions, telepathy, clairvoyance and out-of-the-bodyexperiences beyond all reasonable doubt. This early work culminated in Myers’masterpiece, Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death, which will beexamined more fully in the next chapter.But, astonishingly, all this did little or nothing to influence public opinion.The vast audience that had bought The Night Side of Nature and Footfalls on theBoundary of Another World could not be bothered to read huge works full ofsigned statements and detailed examinations of the evidence. And sceptics suchas T. H. Huxley and Sir Ray Lankester felt there would be no point in readingthem anyway, since anyone who could believe in such nonsense must be a gullibleidiot.Regrettably, there was another factor that prevented the public taking the SPRseriously. In its first two decades, a whole series of ‘exposures’ provided thesceptics with all the ammunition they could wish for; the result was that, byabout 1902, the Society had become a kind of joke, rather like the Flat EarthSociety.One of the most damaging of the ‘exposures’ had taken place in 1880, two yearsbefore the Society was formed. The medium Florence Cook, with whom WilliamCrookes had worked, was caught cheating by Sir George Sitwell — father of Edith,Osbert and Sacheverell. Florence was a ‘materialisation medium’. She sat in acabinet with drawn curtains in a dimly lighted room, and after a few minutes, afigure in white would emerge from the cabinet and talk to people in theaudience. The ‘spirit’ called herself Marie, and claimed that she ‘materialised’herself with substances taken from the medium’s body. As she passed by Sitwell’schair, he grabbed her and held her tight until someone produced a light. Then itwas found that ‘Marie’ was Florence Cook in her corset and petticoat; Florence’sother clothes were found in the cabinet.That looked conclusive, although spiritualists accepted Florence’s explanation —that she was in a trance at the time and had no knowledge of what had happened.Sir William Crookes immediately came to her defence. He pointed out that in1873, a man called Volckman had suddenly grabbed the ‘spirit’ as it walkedaround the room — in those days, a woman who called herself Katie King. Oneperson present claimed that ‘Katie’s legs and feet had dissolved away and thatshe had escaped from Volckman’s clutch with an upward movement like a seal’. Theaudience rushed to the cabinet and found Florence still there, dressed in black,her knots and seals intact. No trace of the white gown in which ‘Katie’ had beendressed was found in the cabinet.Crookes also described how he had once been allowed to hold ‘Katie’ in his armsat a seance, and found her to be quite solid, like a normal woman. Naturallysuspicious, he asked her if he could see Florence in her cabinet. ‘Katie’agreed, and Crookes entered the cabinet and found Florence in a trance. As faras Crookes was concerned, that was conclusive. As far as the sceptics wereconcerned, it proved one of two things: either that Florence had an accomplice —perhaps her sister Katie, also a medium — or that Crookes was a liar.After the Sitwell exposure, an authoress named Florence Marryat sat withFlorence in the cabinet, tied to her with a rope; ‘Marie’ appeared as usual andwalked out amongst the audience. But Florence’s reputation had suffered badly,and she soon went into partial retirement.Crookes was undoubtedly deceived by a personable general’s daughter named RosinaShowers. He had no reason to suspect her, for she refused all payment for herseances, at which a figure dressed in white appeared. Crookes had devised asimple test to prevent Florence Cook from cheating; he had made her dip herhands in a coloured dye before the seance, then examined ‘Katie King’ ’s hands.‘Katie’ passed the test without difficulty. But Rosina’s ‘apparition’ had dyedhands. Crookes allowed himself to overlook this — after all, the ‘spirit’ drewits substance from the medium, and might have borrowed the dye too. But Rosinawas unable to keep her secret to herself, and told the American medium Annie Faythat she had cheated. Mrs Fay immediately passed this on to Crookes, whodemanded a private interview with Rosina. She confessed her deception, andpromised never to do it again. Crookes, in turn, promised not to expose her.This promise was to cause him some embarrassment. Rosina’s mother found outabout the secret meeting, and put the worst possible construction on it. Havingpromised Rosina to keep silence, Crookes had to endure stoically while MrsShowers spread scandal among her friends and accused him of being a Casanova whohabitually seduced his mediums. It was already general gossip that he had sleptwith Florence Cook when he was ‘investigating’ her in his own house. Crookesfinally decided that psychical research was more trouble than it was worth, andgave it up.In 1888, there was a double scandal. The four Creery girls, whose ‘will game’had so impressed Barrett — and caused him to found the SPR — were caughtcheating. They had been constantly tested ever since Barrett discovered them,and had become thoroughly bored with it all. They admitted that they had devisedvarious simple signals to aid their ‘card guessing’ games — an upward glance forhearts, down for diamonds, and so on. They insisted that they had only decidedto cheat fairly recently, and Myers and Gurney believed them, having made quitesure that the girls could not cheat in their own earlier tests. But no one elsebelieved them.Then, worst of all, the two Fox girls whose manifestations had launched theSpiritualist movement publicly confessed that they were cheats. By 1888, bothwere in their fifties, both were widows, and both were drinking too much. Peoplewere no longer interested in spirit rappings. Sister Leah, on the other hand,was still doing rather well; she and her sisters were barely on speaking terms.It was Leah, in fact, who had launched the fashion for ‘materialisations’ when,at a seance with Robert Dale Owen in 1860, a veiled white figure had walkedround the room. With a supporter like Owen, she could hardly fail. Her sisters,on the other hand, had been badly treated by life. Kate’s children had beentaken from her by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children as aresult of her drunkenness. Margaretta had managed to smuggle them to England, toa guardian, but had been sorely tempted to commit suicide by jumping overboardon the return journey. Her strongest desire was to get her own back on her eldersister Leah. So when she arrived back in America, she took the opportunity of aninterview with a reporter to declare that all the rappings had been a cheat. On21 October 1888, she and Kate appeared on a platform at the New York Academy ofMusic, and Margaretta confessed that she had made the raps by means of a doublejoint in her big toe. She went on to demonstrate with a series of muffled raps.They were not in the least like the thunderous knockings that had shaken thebedroom of the Hydesville house, but the audience was willing to be convinced,and Margaretta and Kate were able to share $1,500 between them. The reporterReuben Davenport, who had organised the confession, went on to write a bookcalled The Death Blow to Spiritualism. Much of the $1,500 was spent on alcohol.In due course Margaretta wrote a recantation of the confession, which she handedto a wealthy spiritualist, who allowed her to live in an apartment he owned. Heralcoholism made her an impossible tenant and he had to evict her. She died in1895 and was buried in a pauper’s grave, followed soon afterwards by Kate. Inretrospect, the most significant thing about her confession is that Kate satsilently beside her on stage. She neither confirmed the confession nor offeredto demonstrate how she had been deceiving the public with raps for the pastthirty years. The inference seems to be that she agreed to share the platformfor the sake of the $750, but refused to go further than that.Another embarrassment to organised psychical research was the remarkable Italianmedium Eusapia Palladino. She was an illiterate peasant, of large proportions(like so many mediums) who had been discovered in Naples in 1872, when she waseighteen. She was the most powerful medium since Daniel Dunglas Home. Chairsretreated or moved towards her when she frowned or beckoned them, and hungsuspended in the air. She herself could float up into the air and lie there asif on a couch. She had been investigated by the criminologist Cesare Lombroso,who had no doubt of her genuineness. But she was a highly unstable character,violent, impulsive and sly. When coming out of trances she would make openlysexual overtures to males who attracted her. And, what was worse, she cheated.The absurd thing was that her cheating was clumsy, and the least competentresearcher had no difficulty in catching her at it. Eusapia herself claimed thatthis cheating was done by hostile spirits, which may or may not have been true(since she was often wide awake when she did it). Yet her other phenomena wereso impressive that there could be no question of cheating. The French astronomerCamille Flammarion found a better explanation of her cheating when he observedher over a period. After seances at which obviously genuine phenomena hadoccurred — such as musical instruments floating round the room when Eusapia wastied to her chair — he observed that she was violently ill, sometimes for asmuch as two days, vomiting up any food she tried to take. If genuine phenomenaproduced this effect, it was no wonder she tried to get away withcheating … When Eusapia came to England in 1895, she was tested by the SPR atCambridge, with the conjuror Maskelyne present. Her English hosts were far lessindulgent towards her outrageous cheating than Lombroso had been, and issued athoroughly unfavourable report. This should have convinced sceptics that theSociety had no interest in protecting impostors. It only spread the impressionthat most mediums were such frauds that no sane person would waste time on them.In 1888, the Society suffered another serious blow — the death of one of itsmost brilliant investigators, Edmund Gurney. In June, he went off to Brighton onsome mysterious errand, and was found dead in his hotel bed the next morningwith a bottle of chloroform beside him, and a sponge bag over his face. Aninquest decided that he died accidentally when taking chloroform for atoothache, but there was gossip at the SPR that it was suicide. Gurney had beentesting various Brighton youths for telepathy, and had been impressed. One ofhis ‘telepaths’ had to leave hastily for South Africa as a result of a divorcescandal, and twenty years later, he published a confession, declaring that hehad cheated consistently. It has been suggested that Gurney found out that hehad been hoaxed for years, and that if he was honest about this, it would doeven more damage to psychical research.* Whatever the truth, his death was aserious loss to the Society.It was not the first time Gurney had been hoaxed. Just as he was putting thefinishing touches to the second volume of Phantasms of the Living in 1886, hereceived a letter from a Portsmouth naval cadet named Sparks, who described howhe had been hypnotising a fellow cadet named Cleave. One day when Cleavewondered what his girlfriend was doing in Wandsworth, Sparks hypnotised him andsuggested that he should go to see her. When he came out of the trance,according to Sparks, Cleave said that he had gone into the room where the girlwas sitting with her little brother; she had stared at him and looked pale as ifshe was going to faint … Two days later, Cleave received a letter from the girlasking whether anything had happened to him, because she had seen him in theroom.This case was too good to miss, so Gurney went to the trouble of gettingconfirmatory letters from Cleave (who was eighteen) and from the girlfriend, aswell as from two other cadets who claim to have been present. He printed a fullaccount in Phantasms of the Living. Ten years after his death, Myers and Podmorehad to publish a note in the SPR Proceedings admitting that Cleave had nowconfessed to hoaxing Gurney. It was a lesson in not paying too much attention to‘witnessed’ statements. Yet in another sense, the case vindicated the authors ofPhantasms. The hoaxers had all been teenagers. The majority of people quoted inPhantasms are respectable middle-aged citizens, many of them clergymen, and mostof them can have had no possible motive for hoaxing the SPR.In 1898, Myers himself was involved in a minor scandal that brought discredit onthe SPR. In the late 1880s, Myers had met an attractive girl named AdaGoodrich-Freer, who claimed to come from an upper-class Highland family and tobe clairvoyant. Myers had a keen eye for a pretty girl, and he and the girl weresoon convinced that they were soul mates. There is some evidence that they had alove affair. Myers persuaded her to try crystal gazing, and he felt the resultswere impressive — she claimed to have located a lost key and a medicalprescription, and obtained from the crystal an address she had accidentallydestroyed. Myers wrote a paper about it which came out in the Society’s journal(he called her simply ‘Miss X’). The Society had no reason for doubting such awell-born and refined young lady — after all, why should she lie? What Myers didnot know what that the upper-class Miss Goodrich-Freer was actually the daughterof an Uppingham vet, and her name was simply Freer. She was thirty when Myersmet her, not a teenager, as she claimed. And she was a pathological liar. Hermotivation has never been made clear, but it was probably simply a desire forattention.The Society sent Miss Goodrich-Freer to the Highlands to investigate the wholesubject of second sight; it emerged later that she simply borrowed a manuscriptfrom a folklore-collecting priest and printed his material as her own. Sent toinvestigate a haunting in Surrey, she told the owners of the house that she hadseen nothing, but told the SPR that she had seen a hooded female ghost as shedressed for dinner. That should have made them suspicious, but the attractiveand well-mannered Miss Goodrich-Freer seemed above suspicion.In 1897 she heard rumours that Ballechin House, in Scotland, was haunted, andpersuaded a member of the SPR to rent it for her, for ‘shooting and fishing’.Once there, she claimed to have witnessed all kinds of unearthly phenomena —thumps, bangs, ghostly screams, phantom footsteps, and elusive presences. Therewas a poltergeist that tore the clothes off the bed, and a ghostly nun, who wasspotted by Miss Goodrich-Freer in a nearby glen. Oddly enough, guests who cameto stay with Miss Goodrich-Freer never encountered the more terrifyingphenomena, but they heard ominous bangs and footsteps. Back in London, sheproceeded to write her Alleged Haunting of Ballechin House, but was incensedwhen one of her guests, a certain J. Callendar Ross, beat her past the post withan article in The Times entitled ‘On the Trail of a Ghost’; its tone wassceptical, not to say satirical. A furious correspondence ensued in the columnsof The Times, in the course of which it became clear that Miss Goodrich-Freerand the SPR had rented the house under false pretences. Its owner was naturallydispleased at the damage to his rental prospects of all this sensationalpublicity. Myers, who had been a visitor to Ballechin House, naturally feltobliged to support Miss Goodrich-Freer. But when the wife of the owner denouncedthe SPR in The Times, he hastened to declare that he had long ago decidedagainst publishing his own observations. Another guest who had been at Ballechinwith him immediately contradicted him, saying that Myers had definitelyexpressed his intention of writing about the haunting. Miss Goodrich-Freerherself was enraged by what she felt to be Myers’s unchivalrous desertion. AndMr Callendar Ross expressed the general feeling when he referred to ‘thesuspicion and disgust that close contact with the SPR tends to excite’. WhenMiss Goodrich-Freer published her book on Ballechin, there was still more badfeeling.The scandal may well have brought on the illness that was to kill Myers in 1901.Miss Goodrich-Freer herself experienced a sudden coldness on the part of otherSPR members, and in his review of her book on Ballechin, Frank Podmore came veryclose to calling her a liar. There is evidence* that she was caught cheating ata table-rapping seance in 1901, and decided to leave England for Jerusalem,where she married a man who was sixteen years her junior — convincing him thatshe was two years younger than he was … She died in 1931 at the age ofseventy-four but continued to lie to the end — her death certificate gives herage as fifty-six.These preposterous scandals — mediums in their underwear and ghosts withdouble-jointed big toes — had the unfortunate effect of suggesting that the SPRwas a collection of bumbling crackpots. In fact, looking back after more than acentury, we can see that its achievement during those first two decades wasmonumentally impressive. It had set out to answer the question: Can theparanormal be taken seriously, or is it a collection of old wives’ tales anddelusions? What undoubtedly surprised those pioneers was the sheer mass ofevidence for the paranormal. It must have seemed incredible that one person inten had experienced a hallucination, and that so many people had seenapparitions of dying relatives or had out-of-the-body experiences. Newspaperscandals about fake mediums may have impressed the public, but what impressedthe SPR was that so many mediums were obviously genuine, and that so muchevidence for life after death stood up to the strictest examination. WhenCallendar Ross spoke about the ‘suspicion and disgust’ excited by the SPR, hewas expressing the feeling of most healthy-minded people towards a ‘morbid’subject like psychical research. But morbid or not, it refused to go away. Andthe Society made it harder to ignore by accumulating a positive mountain ofevidence. Phantasms of the Living may be one of the most boring books everwritten, but its two thousand pages of cases finally batter the mind into therecognition that this is something that has to be faced.Since we have devoted so much space to scandals and exposures, it is only fairto look more closely at a cross-section of the kind of evidence that finallyconvinced those pioneers that they were dealing with reality.On 21 October 1893, Prince Victor Duleep Singh, a son of a maharajah, went tobed in a Berlin hotel, where he was staying together with Lord Carnarvon. Beforeswitching off the light, he looked across the room at a framed picture that hungon the opposite wall. To his surprise, he saw the face of his father, looking athim with an intent expression. Thinking that the picture might resemble hisfather, he got out of bed to see; in fact, it showed a girl holding a rose andleaning on a balcony. Prince Victor described the experience to Lord Carnarvonthe next morning. Later the same day, he received a telegram announcing that hisfather had died of a stroke the previous day. The prince had seen his father’sface at the time when the maharajah was lying unconscious after the stroke, afew hours before he died.On the night of 16 October 1902, the wife of a railway guard woke up about 3a.m. for a drink of water. She was alone in bed, because her husband was onnight duty, and the room was dimly lighted by a gas mantle. As she looked intothe water, she saw a clear image of goods wagons smashing into one another, andobserved which of them was most damaged. She was worried about her husband, incase he had had an accident. At nine the next morning he returned home, and shetold him what she had seen. He told her that there had been an accident on theline that night, and it had happened just as she had seen.The odd point about this case is that her husband had passed the scene of theaccident twice: once at the time his wife had seen her Vision’ in the glass ofwater, and again four hours later, when his train was on its way back. But whenhe passed it for the first time, it was dark and he could not see what washappening. At 7 a.m. it was light, and he had then been able to see the sceneclearly — as his wife had seen it in the water. Of course, her husband may haveseen far more subconsciously than he was aware of seeing. But if this wastelepathy, then he had managed to convey to his wife far more than he was awareof seeing.The next case is perhaps one of the most famous ever recorded by the SPR. On 9July 1904, the novelist Rider Haggard suffered such a bad nightmare that hiswife shock him awake. In his dream, he had seen his daughter’s black retrieverdog, Bob, lying on its side among the undergrowth beside some water. Its headwas at an unnatural angle, and it seemed to be trying to tell him that it wasdying.The next morning at breakfast Haggard told his daughter Angela about his dream.She was quite unworried because she had seen Bob the previous evening and he wassafe and well. It was only later in the day that they learned that Bob wasmissing. Four days later, the dog’s body was found floating in the nearby river.It had been struck by a train on the night Haggard had dreamed about it. He wasable to work out the precise time the accident had taken place — a few hoursbefore he had awakened from his nightmare.On 19 March 1917, Mrs Dorothy Spearman was in her room in a hotel in Calcutta,feeding her baby son. Her little daughter was also in the room. She felt therewas someone behind her, and looked round to see her half-brother, EldredBowyer-Bower, standing there; he was an officer in the Royal Flying Corps. Helooked perfectly normal, and Mrs Spearman assumed he had been posted to Indiaand come to see her. She told him that she would put the baby down, and thenthey could have a long talk. But when she had finished tucking in the baby, herhalf-brother had vanished. Her daughter did not appear to have seen anyone. Shelearned later that her half-brother had been shot down over the German lines atabout the time she had seen him.On 7 December 1918, Lieutenant J. J. Larkin, an RAF officer, was writing lettersin the billet when he heard someone walking up the passage outside. Then thedoor opened, and his friend Lieutenant David McConnel shouted ‘Hello boy!’Larkin turned and saw McConnel standing there, holding the doorknob in his hand.He said: ‘Hello, back already?’ and McConnel replied ‘Yes, had a good trip’. Hehad been ferrying a plane to a nearby aerodrome. Then McConnel closed the doorwith a bang and clattered off.When Larkin learned several hours later that McConnel had crashed thatafternoon, he assumed that it must have been after he had seen him. In fact,McConnel had been killed at roughly the same time that Larkin saw him at thedoor.The next case has also become famous, and is regarded as one of the strongestpieces of evidence for survival after death. In June 1925, James Chaffin ofDavie County, North Carolina, dreamed that his father stood by his bedside,wearing an old black overcoat, and told him: ‘You will find the will in myovercoat pocket.’ The father, James L. Chaffin, had died four years earlier,leaving his farm to his third son Marshall, and nothing to his wife or otherthree sons. The will had not been contested, since there seemed no reason to doso.The next morning, James Chaffin hurried to his mother and asked about hisfather’s old black overcoat; she told him it had been given to his brother John.He found the coat at John’s house and examined it carefully. Sewn into thelining of the inside pocket — which his father had indicated in the dream — hefound a roll of paper stating: ‘Read the 27th chapter of Genesis in my daddy’sold Bible.’Taking a neighbour as witness, James Chaffin went back to his mother’s house,and unearthed the old Bible. In the 27th chapter of Genesis there was anotherwill — made later than the one that left everything to Marshall — dividing theproperty between the wife and four sons. The first reaction of Marshall Chaffinwas to contest the will, assuming it to be a forgery. But once he examined it,he had to admit that it was obviously genuine. Ten witnesses testified that itwas in old Chaffin’s handwriting. So the property was divided according to thewishes of the second will.Like Marshall Chaffin, the reader’s first reaction is to suspect skulduggery.But the Canadian member of the SPR who heard of the case hired a lawyer toinvestigate it, and the genuineness of the will was established beyond alldoubt. The significance of the 27th chapter of Genesis is that it contains thestory of how Jacob deceived his blind father Isaac into granting him theinheritance of his brother Esau. This thought had apparently come to old Chaffinnot long before his death, and he made the new will. But instead of having itproperly witnessed, he inserted it in the Bible, no doubt expecting it to befound after his death — together with its implied criticism of his son Marshall.Unfortunately, the Bible was decrepit, and it may have been that the Chaffinfamily was simply not religiously inclined; so after four years, it seems theold farmer had to draw attention to his change of heart …Mrs Crowe’s Night Side of Nature has a whole chapter devoted to similar cases,in which important messages are delivered by dreams or appartions. She tells,for example, of a butcher who dreamed that he was going to be attacked andmurdered on his way to market by two men dressed in blue. He decided to go tomarket with a neighbour, and when he came to the place where the attack hadtaken place in his dream, saw the two men in blue waiting there … But all shetells us by way of detail is that the butcher’s name was Bone and that he livedin Holytown. This can hardly be regarded as ‘confirmatory detail’. The recordsof the SPR contain many equally melodramatic cases. But they took the trouble toget signed statements from all concerned, and the result is far more convincing.In a typical case of 1869, a couple identified as ‘Mr and Mrs P’, were lying inbed in a dimly lighted room when ‘Mrs P’ saw a man dressed as a naval officerstanding at the foot of the bed. Her husband was dozing, and she touched hisshoulder and said: ‘Willie, who is this?’ Her husband roared indignantly: ‘Whaton earth are you doing here, sir?’ The naval officer said reproachfully:‘Willie!’, and as ‘Mr P’ leapt out of bed, walked across the room, anddisappeared into the wall. ‘Mrs P’ said he looked like a solid human being, andthat as he passed a lamp on his way across the room, he threw a shadow.Realising that they had seen a ‘ghost’, ‘Mrs P’ began to wonder if it forebodedsome disaster to her brother, who was in the navy. When she mentioned this toher husband, he said: ‘No, it was my father.’ ‘P’ ’s father had been dead forsome years.After this visitation, ‘Mr P’ became seriously ill for several weeks. When herecovered, he told his wife that he had been in financial trouble for some time,and before seeing the apparition, he had decided to take the advice of a certainindividual which, he now realised, would have ruined him and probably landed himin jail. He was convinced that the ‘ghost’ had come to warn him not to do it.Intrinsically, this case is no more convincing that that of Mr Bone of Holytown.But the SPR obtained signed depositions from ‘Mr and Mrs P’, and from twofriends to whom ‘Mrs P’ had told the story immediately after it had happened. Itis still possible to dismiss it as a dream or a ‘collective hallucination’, orsimply as a downright lie. But the signed statements make this seem at leastunlikely.An interesting point about the experience is ‘Mrs P’ ’s comment that the figurelooked quite solid and normal — most ‘ghosts’ do — and that it cast a shadow.This obviously suggests that it was made of some kind of solid substance, likethe ‘materialisations’ that appeared in the seance room.A ‘warning’ of a different kind seems to have been involved in a case that cameto be known as the ‘red scratch’ case. It involved a commercial traveller(identified as ‘FG’) who was in his hotel room in St Joseph, Missouri, in 1876,when he became aware of someone sitting at the table. It was his sister Annie,who had died of cholera nine years earlier. She looked exactly as she had whenalive, except that she had a bright red scratch on her right cheek. As ‘FG’sprang to his feet, his sister vanished.He was so shaken that he took a train straight back to his parents’ home in StLouis. When he told them about the scratch, his mother fainted. When sherecovered, she told them that she had accidentally made the scratch on the faceof the corpse. She had covered it up with powder, and never mentioned it toanyone.A few weeks later, the mother died, ‘happy in the belief that she would rejoinher favourite daughter’. Her son obviously took the view that the purpose of theapparition was to prepare her mother for her own death. This is another themethat runs fairly constantly through reports of apparitions and ‘death-bedvisions’ collected by the SPR. Sir William Barrett was later to devote a book tothem, and its opening case is typical of the kind of thoroughness the SPRbrought to its investigations.Barrett’s wife was an obstetric surgeon in the Maternity Hospital at Clapton inNorth London. A woman she calls Mrs B was in labour and suffering from heartfailure. As Lady Barrett was holding her hands, she said: ‘It’s getting dark.’Her mother and husband were sent for. Then ‘Mrs B’ looked at another part of theroom and said: ‘Oh, lovely.’ ‘What is lovely?’ ‘Lovely brightness — wonderfulthings.’ Then she exclaimed: ‘Why, it’s father!’ Her baby was brought in for herto see, and she asked: ‘Do you think I ought to stay for baby’s sake?’ Shelooked towards her ‘father’, and said: ‘I can’t stay.’ When her husband hadarrived, she looked across the room and said: ‘Why, there’s Vida!’ Vida was heryounger sister, who had died two weeks earlier. But the death had been kept from‘Mrs B’, so as not to upset her. She died soon after. Lady Barrett, the matronand the husband and mother all vouched that she seemed to remain conscious ofthe dead relatives up to the time of her death. With his usual thoroughness,Barrett obtained a letter verifying all this from the mother. It is the first ofa number of cases cited by Barrett in which people on the point of death have‘seen’ relatives whom they did not know to be dead. Barrett points out thatthere is no known case of a dying person ‘seeing’ someone who is still alive.Sir Oliver Lodge, who was twice president of the SPR, was himself to supply oneof the most convincing cases of ‘communication with the dead’; it is recorded inhis book Raymond.On 8 August 1915, Sir Oliver Lodge received a message from a Boston medium,Leonore Piper, containing an obscure reference to a poem by the Roman poetHorace, about a tree being struck by lightning. Lodge interpreted this as awarning of some disaster. The message purported to come from Frederick Myers,who had been dead for fourteen years. A week later, Lodge heard that hisyoungest son Raymond had been killed in the Ypres campaign.After this, a number of mediums relayed messages that purported to come fromRaymond, but Lodge remained unconvinced — most of them were of the ‘Having alovely time’ variety. But in the following month, Lodge’s wife was taken by afriend to a seance by a remarkable medium, Mrs Osborne Leonard. Neither themedium nor Lady Lodge knew one another by sight, and they were not introduced.Nevertheless, Mrs Leonard announced that she had a message from ‘Raymond’, whostated that he had met many of his father’s friends since death; asked to nameone of them, Raymond replied ‘Myers’.Another ‘message’ from Raymond was relayed to Lady Lodge via a male mediumcalled Vout Peters; in it, ‘Raymond’ spoke about a photograph showing himself ina group of people, and referring to a walking stick. The Lodges knew nothingabout such a photograph. Two months later, the mother of one of Raymond’s fellowofficers wrote to say that she had a group photograph including Raymond, andoffering to send a copy. Before this arrived, Lodge himself visited Mrs Leonard,and when her ‘control’ ‘Feda’ announced Raymond’s presence, he took theopportunity to ask about the photograph. Raymond explained that it had beentaken outdoors, and mentioned that someone had wanted to lean on him. When thephotograph arrived a few days later, it showed a group of officers outside abillet. Raymond, sitting in the front row, has a cane resting on his leg, andthe officer sitting behind him is using Raymond’s shoulder as an arm rest.Lodge’s book gives many more examples of evidence of Raymond’s ‘survival’; but,as he points out, this one is particularly convincing because it involves twomediums, both of whom spoke of the photograph before Lodge knew of its existence— thus ruling out any possibility of telepathy.To conclude this chapter, here is a final example of a type of phenomenon sobeloved by Mrs Crowe and other early writers on the ‘supernatural’: thefull-scale haunting.In February 1932, the grandchildren of a chimneysweep named Samuel Bull refusedto go to sleep, insisting that there was someone outside the door of thecottage. (They were sleeping in a downstairs room, recovering from influenza.)Their mother, Mary Edwards, looked outside the door, but there was no one there.Soon afterwards, she and the children saw the figure of Samuel Bull — who hadbeen dead since the previous June — walk across the room, up the stairs, andthrough the door of the room in which he had died. (This was closed.) They allscreamed. This was the first of many appearances of the dead man at his cottagein Oxford Street, Ramsbury, Wiltshire. The ‘ghost’ was apparently aware of thepresence of his family, for he twice placed his hand on the brow of his invalidwife Jane, and once spoke her name. Samuel Bull — who had died of cancer —looked quite solid, and could be seen so clearly that the children noticed thewhiteness of his knuckles, which seemed to be protruding through the skin. Theyalso noticed that the expression on his face was sad. After the firstappearance, the family no longer felt alarmed — the children seemed ‘awed’rather than frightened. They assumed that the ghost was looking sad because ofthe miserable conditions they were living in — the cottage was damp and somerooms were unfit for habitation. On the last two occasions on which he appeared,Samuel Bull no longer looked sad, and Mrs Edwards assumed that this was becausethe family was to be re-housed in a council house.The family was already on the move when the two investigators from the SPRarrived, but the local vicar had already interviewed the family and recordedtheir accounts of what took place. The investigators were understandably upsetthat they had not been told about the case earlier, but their conversations withwitnesses, and the evidence of the vicar, left them in no doubt that thehaunting was genuine.This rag-bag of assorted visions and apparitions underlines the enormous varietyof cases investigated by the SPR in the first century of its existence. None ofthem are, in themselves, more impressive than cases cited by Jung-Stilling orCatherine Crowe or Robert Dale Owen. But they are more convincing because honestinvestigators have obviously done their best to confirm that they are genuine.And anyone who is willing to spend a few hours browsing through volumes of theProceedings of the SPR (or its American counterpart) is bound to end with afeeling that further scepticism is a waste of time. Even if half the casesproved to be fraudulent or misreported, the other half would still beoverwhelming by reason of sheer volume. It is easy to understand the irritationof Professor James Hyslop when he wrote in Life After Death:I regard the existence of discarnate spirits as scientifically proved and I nolonger refer to the sceptic as having any right to speak on the subject. Any manwho does not accept the existence of discarnate spirits and the proof of it iseither ignorant or a moral coward. I give him short shrift, and do not proposeto argue with him on the supposition that he knows nothing about the subject.Where sceptics are concerned, he certainly has a point. Sir John Bland Sutton, awell-known surgeon, remarked: ‘Death is the end of all. My experience is thatall of those who have studied the subject scientifically and deeply have come tothe same conclusion.’ Such a statement simply lacks the ring of truth. Therehave been many basically sceptical investigators — Hyslop himself wasnotoriously ‘tough-minded’, and much disliked by fellow members of the SPRbecause he seemed an incorrigible ‘doubting Thomas’ — but in every single casewhere a sceptic has persisted in studying the facts, he has ended upmore-or-less convinced of the reality of life after death. I say ‘more or less’because a few investigators, such as Dr Gardner Murphy and Mrs Louisa Rhine,feel that most of the ‘facts’ can also be explained by what might be called‘super ESP’ — mind-reading clairvoyance, and so on. Hyslop himself finallyabandoned the ‘super ESP’ hypothesis through an experience that has become knownas the ‘red pyjamas case’. He received a communication from a medium in Irelandto the effect that a ‘spirit’ calling itself William James had asked him to passon a message asking him if he remembered some red pyjamas. Now William James,who had died in 1910, had agreed with Hyslop that whichever of them died firstshould try to communicate with the other. But the message about red pyjamasmeant nothing to Hyslop. Then suddenly he remembered. When he and James wereyoung men, they went to Paris together, and discovered that their luggage hadnot yet arrived. Hyslop went out to buy some pyjamas, but could only find abright red pair. For days James teased Hyslop about his poor taste in pyjamas.But Hyslop had long forgotten the incident. As far as he could see, there was noway of explaining the red pyjamas message except on the hypothesis that it wasreally William James who had passed it on.Twenty-six years after Hyslop’s death, he was quoted by the psychologist CarlJung in a letter. Jung was discussing the question of the identity of ‘spirits’who communicate through mediums:I once discussed the proof of identity for a long time with a friend of WilliamJames, Professor Hyslop, in New York. He admitted that, all things considered,all these metapsychic phenomena could be explained better by the hypothesis ofspirits than by the qualities and peculiarities of the unconscious. And here, onthe basis of my own experience, I am bound to concede he is right. In eachindividual case I must of necessity be sceptical, but in the long run I have toadmit that the spirit hypothesis yields better results in practice than anyother.*Yet it is significant that Jung never made this admission in any of hispublished work, where he continued to insist that the facts about the paranormalcould be explained in terms of the powers of the unconscious mind.**As far as the present investigation is concerned, we shall proceed on Jung’sassumption that the ‘spirit hypothesis’ fits the facts better than any other.The question of whether it is ultimately true must, for the time being, be leftopen.*Trevor H. Hall, The Strange Case of Edmund Gurney, 1964.*John L. Campbell and Trevor Hall, Strange Things, 1968, p. 211.*Collected Letter, Vol. 1, p. 431.**This is discussed at length in my book on Jung, The Lord of the Underworld(1984)."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVEREDISCOVERING A MASTERPIECEIn the autumn of 1863, a woman named Sarah Hall had the interesting experienceof seeing her own ghost. She was sitting at the dining table, with her husbandand another couple, when all four of them saw another Mrs Hall standing at theend of the sideboard. The figure was wearing a spotted dress, quite unlike theone Mrs Hall had on. Her husband said: ‘Why, it’s Sarah!’, and as they allstared at it, it disappeared.The case is irritating because it has no sequel. Mrs Hall was still in goodhealth when she wrote and told Gurney about the case twenty years later, so itwas not some ominous portent. A few years later, Mrs Hall apparently owned aspotted dress like the one her ‘ghost’ was wearing, but that also seems to beneither here nor there. The only clue that makes any sense is Mrs Hall’s commentthat the house they were living in used to be a church. We have seen thatChristian churches were often built on pagan sites, as if the ground itself hadsome inherent ‘power’ or force that the ancients regarded as sacred. But thatstill takes us no nearer the explanation of how four people saw Mrs Hall’s‘double’.If the case were unique, we might dismiss it as a prevarication. But there arehundreds of reports of ‘doubles’ in the literature of psychical research. Noless a person than the poet Goethe recorded seeing his own ‘double’ (or‘doppelgänger’) riding towards him along a road in Alsace as he was taking leaveof his sweetheart. The figure was wearing a grey and gold suit. Eight yearslater, on his way to visit the same girl, he passed the spot and suddenlyrealised that he was now wearing the grey and gold suit. And Robert Dale Owenrecorded in detail the case of a schoolteacher named Emilie Sagée whose ‘double’frequently appeared standing beside her in the classroom. One of her pupilsnoticed that the ‘real’ Emilie looked pale and ill when her ‘double’ appeared,as if the material for the ‘double’ came from Emilie’s own body.Cases like this make it very clear that, while we have a few plausible theoriesabout ghosts, apparitions and such things, we lack any comprehensive theory thatwould explain them all. Even a belief in ‘spirits’ gets us no closer to anexplanation of Mrs Hall’s peculiar experience.Frederick Myers, the man who was most responsible for creating the Society forPsychical Research, was keenly aware of this deficiency. From the age oftwenty-six, when he took the famous ‘starlit walk’ with Henry Sidgwick, untilhis death thirty-two years later, he never ceased trying to fit all paranormalphenomena into a single pattern. The result of these efforts appeared two yearsafter his death, in a work called Human Personality and Its Survival of BodilyDeath. The book is a masterpiece, probably the most comprehensive work everwritten on the subject of the paranormal. Unfortunately, it is almost unknown tothe general reader, largely on account of its off-putting title, which makes itsound as if it is full of accounts of seance rooms and messages from the dead.Nothing could be further from the truth. It is an ambitious attempt to reviewthe strange powers of the human mind; the question of ‘life after death’ israised only towards the end.Because the book is so little known, and because its conclusions are soimportant, let us consider it in some detail. Myers begins by discussingclinical cases of what we would now call ‘multiple personality’. On 7 September1824, a German epileptic named Sörgel murdered an old woodcutter in the forest,and chopped off his head and feet with his own axe. After this, he drank theman’s blood. Back in town, he talked quite openly about what he had done,explaining that drinking blood is a cure for epilepsy. Sörgel was already knownas a ‘Jekyll-and-Hyde’ personality who developed criminal tendencies after hisfits. A week later, by the time he appeared in front of the magistrate, he hadreverted back to the Jekyll personality, quiet and polite, and without theslightest memory of the murder. He was found not guilty and sent to a lunaticasylum.Another case cited by Myers offers at least one interesting clue to this mysteryof multiple personality. Louis Vivé was ten years old when he was sent to achildren’s home in 1873, and was of a quiet, obedient disposition. Four yearslater, he had a terrifying encounter with a viper, which produced a state ofshock. After this, he began having epileptic fits, and developed hystericalparalysis of the legs. He was sent to an asylum at Bonneval for observation, andfor the next two months worked quietly at tailoring. Then he had a fit thatlasted for two days, with violent convulsions and moods of ecstasy. When he wokeup, the paralysis had vanished, and he was a changed person. He had no memory ofanything that had happened since the viper attack. And he was violent, dishonestand badly behaved. The former Louis had been a teetotaller; the new one not onlydrank, but stole the wine of the other patients.After serving in the marines, and spending some time in jail for theft, Vivé wassent to the Rochefort asylum, where three doctors became fascinated by his case.Vivé now suffered from paralysis of the right side of his body, and from aspeech defect that made him stutter badly. In spite of the speech defect he wasa non-stop talker, and was inclined to preach atheism and violent revolution.The 1880s saw a revival of interest in the doctrines of Mesmer, including hisbelief that the ‘vital powers’ can be moved around the human body by means ofmagnets. Vivé’s doctors were interested in a variation of this doctrine — thatvarious metals could get rid of paralysis. And when they tried stroking Vivé’supper right arm with steel, it had the astonishing effect of promptlytransferring the paralysis to the left side of his body. Immediately, the old,gentle Louis Vivé came back. He had no memory of the person he had become afterthe long epileptic attack.We have a clue that was unknown to Vivé’s doctors — that the left brain controlsthe right half of the body, and vice versa. So when the ‘criminal’ Vivé’s rightside was paralysed, his left brain was affected, and the personality thatexpressed itself was the ‘right-brain Vivé’. The left brain is the speechhemisphere — hence the stuttering. A rough outline of Vivé’s problem becomesdiscernible. His early childhood had been difficult, with a drunken and violentmother; he became a timid and repressed personality. The ‘social I’, as we haveseen, lives in the left brain. His right-brain self — the ‘intuitive’ Vivé — hadno chance to express its aggressions or frustrations. The shock of the encounterwith the viper caused the total withdrawal of the timid, left-brain self, andleft the ‘other Vivé’ free to express itself. From then on, Vivé turned into aclassic case of ‘multiple personality’.Myer’s account of the case (which gives the impression that he personallyinterviewed Louis Vivé) ends with an interesting footnote; he mentions that whena magnet was placed on Vivé’s head, he instantly became ‘normal’ again, exceptthat his memory stopped short of the day before the encounter with the viper. Itseems quite clear that ‘magnetism’ did work, and that modern science may beneglecting an interesting line of research.Myers goes on to discuss other examples of multiple personality. There was thecelebrated case of a man called Ansel Bourne, who was standing on a streetcorner in Providence, Rhode Island, when he lost his memory. The next thing heknew was waking up in a strange room in a strange bed. It was two months later,and he was in Norristown, Pennsylvania. During that time, Bourne had gone toNorristown, rented a confectionery shop, and carried on business under the nameof A. J. Brown. No one even suspected that he was a case of amnesia.Even stranger is the case of Clara Fowler, described by the psychiatrist MortonPrince, who called her Christine Beauchamp. When trying to cure Clara of severedepression, Prince placed her under hypnosis, and a completely new personalityemerged, a bright, mischievous child who called herself Sally. And ‘Sally’ could‘take over’ Clara when she felt inclined. She used to enjoy playing tricks, likegoing for a long walk in the country — ‘Sally’ was as strong as a mule — andthen ‘abandoning’ the body and leaving the exhausted Clara to walk home. On oneoccasion, ‘Sally’ ‘borrowed’ Clara’s body for weeks, went off to another townand got a job as a waitress, then finally abandoned it and left Clara to makeher own way back to Boston. Like Louis Vivé’s alter-ego, ‘Sally Beauchamp’stuttered badly.But the case of Clara Fowler was more complicated than this. Under hypnosis, athird personality emerged, who was more adult and balanced than either Clara or‘Sally’. So the ‘double brain’ explanation that seems to fit the case of LouisVivé or Ansel Bourne no longer applies here. In his chapter on hypnosis, Myersseeks a new explanation. He describes a series of experiments carried out byEdmund Gurney, and later by Mrs Sidgwick, which revealed that most people couldbe hypnotised to two different ‘depths’ or levels, and that one subject couldeven be hypnotised through nine different depths. The subject would be placedunder hypnosis and told some ‘fact’ — for example, that a local hotel had justbeen burnt down. Then he would be hypnotised more deeply, and told another‘fact’ — that there had been a railway accident. Then down to a third ‘depth’,and yet another ‘fact’ — that the Emperor of Germany had been forced to cutshort a state visit to Queen Victoria because a relative had died … Whensubsequently re-hypnotised, the subject would remember each ‘fact’ as he reachedthe correct level, but would have no memory of any of the others. Myers inferredthat this could be an explanation of multiple personality — that we all havemany layers or levels, and that a shock — like Louis Vivé’s viper — can producean effect like hypnosis and plunge the patient to another level of personality.This explanation may or may not be correct, but it shows Myers’ determination totry to find a key to the mysteries of the unconscious mind.This emerges most clearly in his chapter on genius. He says: ‘Genius … should beregarded as a power of utilising a wider range … of faculties in some degreeinnate in all.’ (My italics.) This is what fascinates Myers; that such powersare not some kind of freak, but probably exist in all of us. He goes on to citemany stories of extraordinary mental feats. A five-year-old boy, Benjamin Blyth,was out walking with his father, and asked him what time it was; his father saidit was half past seven. A few minutes later the child said: ‘In that case, Ihave been alive …’, and named the exact number of seconds since his birth. Whenthey got home, his father took a sheet of paper and worked it out. ‘You made amistake — you were wrong by 172,800 seconds.’ ‘No I wasn’t,’ said the child,‘you forgot the two leap years, 1820 and 1824.’ And Myers also speaks ofProfessor Truman Henry Safford who, at the age of ten, could performmultiplications in his head when the answer came to thirty-six figures, and thepeasant boy Vito Mangiamele, who took half a minute to extract the cube root of3,796,416.A modern case can illustrate more clearly what is at issue: the ‘calendarcalculating twins’ John and Michael, ‘idiot savants’ who have spent most oftheir lives in a state mental hospital in America. They have been described bythe psychiatrist Oliver Sacks.* Although the twins are mentally subnormal, withan IQ of only sixty, they can name the day of the week of any date in the pastor future forty thousand years. Asked, let us say, about 6 March 1877, theyshout almost instantly: ‘Tuesday.’ And they have no more difficulty about a datelong before the Great Pyramid was built. Yet, oddly enough, the twins have theutmost difficulty with ordinary addition and subtraction, and do not appear toeven understand multiplication and division. The opinion of most scientists whohave studied them is that they have some simple formula. But Dr Sacks reached aquite different conclusion. He was present one day when a box of matches fell onthe floor, and both twins said immediately: ‘A hundred and eleven.’ When Sackscounted the matches, there were, indeed, a hundred and eleven. The twins alsomurmured Thirty-seven’, and when Sacks asked them why, they explained that threethirty-sevens make a hundred and eleven. He asked them how they knew there werea hundred and eleven. ‘We saw it.’ So they had instantaneously counted thematches as they were falling. And they gave the same answer when Sacks asked howthey had worked out that thirty-seven is a third of one hundred and eleven. Itwas as if they had seen one hundred and eleven ‘splitting’ into three parts.On another occasion, Sacks walked up behind them when they were repeatingnumbers to one another. One would say a six-figure number, and the other wouldsavour it, then say another six-figure number. Sacks made a note of thesenumbers, and when he got home, studied them carefully. He discovered that theywere all prime numbers — numbers that cannot be divided exactly by any othernumber (for example, five, seven and eleven).Now there is an interesting thing about prime numbers: there is no short cut tofinding out whether some huge number is a prime, except by painstakinglydividing every other number into it. (Sacks used a book.)How were the twins doing it? They could not be calculating them — they hadvirtually no power of calculation. The next day, Sacks went to see them carryinghis book on prime numbers. They were still playing the number game, and Sacksjoined in, repeating an eight-figure prime. There was a half-minute pause whilethey looked at him in astonishment, then both broke into smiles, and beganswapping eight-figure primes. An hour later they were swappingtwenty-four-figure primes — although even an ‘electronic brain’ would take sometime to work out whether such a huge figure is a prime or not.Sacks concluded that, in some extraordinary way, the twins were seeing thesehuge numbers instantaneously, just as they ‘saw’ the number of matches in thebox. That is to say, they were somehow using the right side of the brain insteadof the left, as the rest of us do for calculation. Yet the fact that they arenot particularly intelligent seems to demonstrate that this is not someextraordinary form of genius. It is almost certainly a power which everyonepossesses — potentially — but which the rest of us have somehow ‘suppressed’through the development of ‘left-brain consciousness’.Myers knew nothing of the right and left hemispheres; he only knew that suchpowers spring from the unconscious mind — or, as he preferred to call it, the‘subliminal mind’. This is not the modern ‘Unconscious’, derived from Freud andJung. Myers’s ‘subliminal mind’ is not some kind of dustbin that containsrepressions, neuroses and incestuous guilt feelings. It is the source of theflashes of intuition that we call genius. It could therefore be regarded as akind of combination of the Unconscious mind of Freudian psychology and the ‘highself of the Kahunas, as described by Max Freedom Long. This view is conciselyexpressed by Aldous Huxley in a foreword he wrote for an American edition ofMyers’s book: ‘Is the house of the soul a mere bungalow with a cellar? Or doesit have an upstairs above the ground floor of consciousness as well as agarbage-littered basement beneath?’ Myers, he goes on to say, takes the viewthat the human soul has an attic above ordinary consciousness as well as abasement below it, and that Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Deathis ‘an immense store of information about the strange and often wonderfulgoings-on in the upper stories of man’s soul-house’. This is, in fact, preciselywhat makes Myers’s book so remarkable.What it all proves, according to Myers, is that our powers are far greater thanwe realise. If this argument sounds familiar, it is because we have alreadyencountered it in Catherine Crowe’s Night Side of Nature. The difference is thatwhile Mrs Crowe states her facts, and leaves the reader to take them or leavethem, Myers wants to make the reader concede that they are facts. Mrs Crowecites some vague experiment about a hypnotist engaging in a ‘battle of will’with an animal. Myers actually took the trouble to make the journey to Le Havre,and witness experiments in which a certain Dr Gibert hypnotised a patient calledLeonie from half a mile away, merely by willing her to fall into a trance. Infact, Leonie resisted; she told the psychologist Pierre Janet: ‘I know very wellthat M. Gibert tried to put me to sleep, but when I felt him I looked for somewater and put my hands in cold water. I don’t want people to put me to sleepthat way … it makes me look silly.’ And then he goes on to cite a successfulexperiment, in which — after Gibert had tried to put her to sleep at a distance— they all went and hid near Leonie’s house, and watched her walk out of thegarden gate with her eyes closed, and walk towards Gibert’s house.In her little book Spiritualism and the Age We Live In, published in 1859 (justbefore her mental breakdown), Mrs Crowe had remarked: … there is a department of knowledge which, as far as we know, is not reducibleto experimental science … I allude to the knowledge or science of ourselves. Ofour bodies … we have, within a comparatively short space of time, learnt a greatdeal; but of ourselves as composite beings we know absolutely nothing. We haveadded nothing to the knowledge of the ancients; perhaps we have rather lost whatthey knew or suspected. Metaphysics gives us words without any distinct ideas,and Psychology is a name without a science …But a mere twenty years later, this was no longer true; psychology was quicklybecoming a real science, and it was revealing some of those secrets about‘ourselves’ that Catherine Crowe regarded as the most important of all kinds ofknowledge. This explains the undercurrent of excitement and optimism that runsthrough Myers’s book. He was quite convinced — he says as much at the end — thatman was at some crucial turning point in his history, and that this new ‘scienceof ourselves’ would transform human existence as completely as the science ofGalileo and Newton had transformed it since the seventeenth century.What abnormal psychology teaches us, he argued, was that our minds are richerand stranger than we could imagine. Even Aldous Huxley’s image of a house withan upper storey fails to do justice to Myers’s vision of human personality. Itis more like a skyscraper, with dozens of storeys above ground, and anotherdozen or so below. His experiments with different ‘layers’ of consciousnessseemed to reveal that man has a whole series of ‘basements’ below his ‘everydayself’. And that in turn suggests that he also has a series of upper storeysabove his everyday consciousness. Moreover, if we think of a case like that ofLouis Vivé, we can see that his criminal alter-ego was a more primitive, violentperson than the polite, well-behaved Louis, and therefore a step in thedirection of the cave-man. Which also suggests that his undeveloped higherlevels are a step in the opposite direction — towards the god.For Myers, cases like the ones we discussed at the beginning of this chapter —the lady who saw her own ‘double’ standing by the sideboard and theschoolteacher who was continually standing ‘beside herself’ — were notpsychological freaks or anomalies; they were evidence of some peculiar power wedo not understand. He cites a typical case of a ‘phantasm of the living’ takenfrom the Society for Psychical Research’s ‘Census of Hallucinations’. On aSunday afternoon in August 1889, a girl identified as ‘Miss KE’ changed her mindabout going to church, and instead spent the afternoon in her uncle’s library,studying his genealogical chart. But her two sisters, who went to church, sawher walking up the aisle with a roll of paper (evidently the genealogical chart)under her arm. All three sisters wrote an account of this odd occurrence.The case is not as unusual as it sounds; there are well over a hundred like itin the ‘Census of Hallucinations’ and Phantasms of the Living. In most of them,it seems clear that the person who projected the ‘doppelgänger’ was thinkingabout the place where the ‘double’ was seen. In his autobiography Legends, thedramatist Strindberg describes how, when he was dangerously ill in Paris, heexperienced a powerful longing to be back in Germany with his wife’s family. Fora moment, he felt he was inside the house, and could see his mother-in-lawplaying the piano. Shortly afterwards, he received a letter from hismother-in-law asking ‘Are you all right? When I was playing the piano the otherday I looked up and saw you standing there.’ It is important to note thatStrindberg was seriously ill at the time, which suggests that the mechanisminvolved is much the same as in cases where people on the point of death havebeen seen by close relatives.In fact, there is evidence that ‘psychic projection’ can be performed at will.Although Edmund Gurney was undoubtedly hoaxed by the exuberant teenagers whoclaimed that one of them had ‘visited’ his girlfriend under hypnosis,* other‘experimental’ cases are well authenticated. In 1881, a student named S. H.Beard decided to try ‘projecting’ himself three miles, to the house of hisfiancée, Miss L. S. Verity. He made the attempt after going to bed on a Sundayevening. On the following Thursday, he went to see Miss Verity, and she told himthat she had been terrified to find him standing by her bedside the previousSunday. As the apparition moved towards her, she screamed, and woke up hereleven-year-old sister, who also saw it. In his own statement, Beard said:Besides exercising the power of volition very strongly, I put forth an effortwhich I cannot find words to describe. I was conscious of a mysterious influenceof some sort permeating my body, and had a distinct impression that I wasexercising some force with which I had been hitherto unacquainted, but which Ican now at certain times set in motion at will.After his studies in hypnosis, Myers found it easy enough to believe in such aforce. If Dr Gibert could hypnotise Leonie from half a mile away, then he was,in some sense, ‘projecting’ himself to her; under different circumstances, hemight have made her ‘see’ him. Myers, like Thomson Jay Hudson, was fascinated bythe extraordinary powers of the ‘subliminal’ mind. One hypnotist told a patientto make a cross at exactly 20,180 minutes after being awakened from the trance,and the patient did it. Yet the patient was not particularly good at arithmetic.‘Something’ inside her had carefully counted more than twenty thousand minutes(about fourteen days) then obeyed the order to make a cross. This is a variationon a power most of us possess — to decide that we must wake up at a certaintime, and to wake up at that precise moment as if by an alarm. If the‘subliminal mind’ has an alarm clock that can operate during sleep or count theminutes in fourteen days, then the power of ‘projecting’ an image of oneself tosome other place seems altogether less extraordinary. And in our own time, whentelevision transmitters can send images to the moon, it is a great deal easierto accept than in Myers’s day.Professor C. D. Broad, discussing the case of Sarah Hall* — who saw her own‘double’ by the sideboard — suggests that what she saw might have been her‘astral body’. But that seems highly unlikely. To begin with, most accounts ofthe astral body state that it cannot be seen by other people. Secondly, manycases of ‘doppelgängers’ include objects — like the genealogical chart held by‘Miss KE’ in church; there is no reason why a roll of paper should have anastral body. In another case cited by Myers, the ‘doppelgänger’ included a horseand carriage, as well as two people. The Rev. W. Mountford, of Boston, describedhow he was standing by the window, in the house of a friend, when he saw a horseand carriage arriving. He remarked to his host: ‘Here is your brother coming’,and his host also saw the carriage. It turned round the corner of the house, tothe front door. But no visitors arrived. Instead, the host’s niece, Mary, cameinto the room, looking worried. She had just walked from her parents’ home,leaving them sitting by the fire; but as she was on her way, their carriagepassed by her. They were looking straight ahead, and ignored her.Ten minutes later, Mountford heard the sound of a carriage, and said: ‘Look,they’re coming down the road again.’ This time, the carriage proved to be real.And its occupants were baffled when told that they had arrived a quarter of anhour earlier, and that they had passed their daughter on the road.The question Mountford should have asked was whether one of them had fallen intoa daydream while sitting in front of the fire, and imagined driving to thebrother’s house. The answer would almost certainly have been yes.The implication seems to be that the ‘subliminal mind’ possesses a kind oftelevision transmitter, as well as a receiver. Both Mountford and his host — andniece — all saw the carriage. Both of ‘Miss KE’ ’s sisters saw her walk intochurch clutching a roll of paper. In both cases, the image looked perfectly realand normal.Another interesting point about the Beard case mentioned above is that, afterhis first successful attempt, he felt he had learned the ‘trick’, and could thendo it at will. Gurney asked Beard to let him know next time he tried theexperiment. Beard did this on 22 March 1884. And Miss Verity signed a statementto the effect that, at about midnight, Beard had appeared in her room andstroked her hair. She passed on this information to her little sister, who alsoverified it.An American heart specialist, Dr Michael Sabom, became interested in near-deathexperiences of heart-attack patients, and wrote a book, Recollections of Death,in 1982. He noted that patients who had experienced out-of-the-body projectionswere often able to repeat them at will. One nineteen-year-old girl described howshe had been knocked down by a car on a pedestrian crossing, and how suddenlyshe was ‘above the whole scene, viewing the accident’. She watched as theambulance men arrived, and was critical of the way they lifted her on to thestretcher. After this, she woke up in hospital. When Sabom interviewed herthirteen years later, she told him: ‘I knew I had left my body because thisbecame something I could do almost at will. I realised I had learned to do thatat the time I had probably come close to dying.’ And she went on to describehow, lying alone in her trailer at night (her husband worked nights) she wouldleave her body and check that everything was safe in the trailer. One night, shenoticed that the rear door of the trailer had been left open. After ‘returning’to her body, she got up and closed it.The inference would seem to be that we all possess these powers potentially, butsimply never learn to make use of them. If Myers is correct, there is nothingmystical or metaphysical about this assertion; it is a plain statement of fact,based on scientific evidence.We have now arrived at a crucial — in fact, the crucial — point in Myers’sargument, and before we continue, it may be as well to look back over the stepsthat have brought us here.The basic objection to ‘personal’ survival is that personality is a kind ofartifact. It is ‘built-up’ little by little, from our experiences. So there isno more reason why my personality should survive my death than why my houseshould survive after it has been knocked down.Myers’s reply is to point to the mystery of multiple personality. Louis Vivé andClara Fowler were, to all appearances, more than one person. Yet there wasobviously some permanent substratum underneath these ‘personalities’, a beingfor whom the personalities were various masks. In his autobiography, AlfredRussel Wallace describes his experiments in hypnotism with his pupils. He saysof one of these:More curious still was the taking away of the memory so completely that he couldnot tell his own name, and would adopt any name that was suggested to him, andperhaps remark how stupid he was to have forgotten it; and this might berepeated several times with different names, all of which he would implicitlyaccept. Then, on saying to him, ‘Now you remember your own name again; what isit?’ an inimitable look of relief would pass over his countenance, and he wouldsay, ‘Why, P— of course’, in a way that carried complete conviction.The ‘real P—’ was there all the time, in spite of having forgotten his own name.The point is reinforced by some more recent cases of multiple personality. InSybil, Flora Rheta Schreiber describes a patient with fourteen differentpersonalities, some of them male. The rapist Billy Milligan proved to havetwenty-three sub-personalities, some of them far more talented and brilliantthan Billy himself.* And Christine Sizemore, the subject of the famous ThreeFaces of Eve, reached an unbelievable total of forty alter-egos. And the Evecase also suggests that the ‘personality’ may, in some ways, be independent ofthe body. Christine Sizemore was allergic to nylon, but the moment her alter-egotook over, the nylon rash disappeared. She was shortsighted; her alter-ego couldsee perfectly without glasses. On one occasion, when she was under anaesthetic,her alter-ego took over and was totally unaffected by the anaesthetic. If allthis is true, then our usual assumption that ‘personality’ is somehow dependenton the body may be a misunderstanding. The body may be an instrument thatresponds to the demands of the personality — in the same way that a car respondsto its driver, but to a far greater extent. This in turn suggests that physicalillness may depend on the personality, not on the body — that when a person isbent and decrepit and feeble, it is the personality that is bent and decrepit.If another personality could take it over — as the mischievous ‘Sally’ took overthe body of Clara Fowler — it might be instantly transformed.All this is implicit in Myers’s argument. He has also suggested that we maypossess powers that would once have been termed ‘magical’ — for example, thepower to transmit our thoughts to someone on the other side of the world, andeven to transmit a physical image of ourselves to the minds of other people. Thescientific answer to that claim is that all our ‘powers’ have been developed inthe course of millions of years of evolution, as a response to the challenges ofevolution. So why should we possess these powers suggested by Myers?His answer would be to point to the powers of men of genius: a Mozart able toplay a whole concerto accurately after having heard it only once, afive-year-old Benjamin Blyth able to calculate how many seconds he had beenalive. We have certainly never had need for any of these powers in the course ofour evolution. Myers also points out that in the case of some calculatingprodigies, like Professor Safford and Archbishop Whately, their unusual powersvanished at about the age of puberty, and they then became ‘like the rest ofus’. If Whately and Safford could become ‘like the rest of us’, it clearlyimplies that the rest of us could, if we made the effort, become calculatingprodigies like Whately and Safford, or could learn to leave our bodies at will,like Michael Sabom’s patient, to check that we have closed all the doors andwindows. (It is easy to see that such a faculty would have been extremely usefulto a cave-man, who could go and investigate a snuffling noise outside his cavewithout running the risk of being eaten.)In fact, the evolutionary argument can be used to support either side. There ismuch evidence that primitive people are more ‘psychic’ than we are. SomeAustralian aborigines are able to detect underground water without even the aidof a dowsing rod. Other examples are cited by Professor Hornell Hart.* AScottish sportsman, David Leslie, was curious about what had happened to hiseight Kaffirs, who were on a hunting expedition two hundred miles away; a Zuluwitch doctor was able to tell him exactly what was happening to them, and hisinformation later proved to be ‘correct in every particular’. And Commander R.Jukes Hughes, serving in the Transkei, received a running commentary from localnatives on a battle that was now taking place three hundred miles away — acommentary that again proved to be accurate.In any case, it seems obvious that, over millions of years of evolution,different powers and capacities are developed and then submerged again, as theycease to be necessary. But although they may be submerged, they remain encodedin the genes. When Darwin arrived on the Galapagos Islands, he discovered manytypes of finch that had been blown from the mainland of South America, and whichhad probably been there for centuries. In the early 1940s, some of these birdswere brought back to California, and instantly reacted with alarm to hawks,vultures and ravens — predators that do not exist on the Galapagos, and which noGalapagos finch had seen for hundreds of generations. Like a careful housewife,evolution never throws away anything that might one day be useful. For the pastthree thousand years, man has adapted himself to civilisation. But in the vastdepths of his being, there must be thousands of characteristics that hedeveloped in the great droughts and ice ages of the past three million years,and which he has packed away in the storage cupboard of the genes in case theyshould come in useful.And so, says Myers, we seem to have demonstrated that there is some ‘substratum’in man which is far more durable than his everyday personality, and that thisdeeper ‘self’ seems to possess some unusual powers that would startle theeveryday self. Allow this much, and we come to the really interesting part ofthe argument: that there is evidence that this ‘substratum’ survives death, andthat it is able to exercise some of these powers at will.He begins by citing one of the most interesting and frequently quoted cases ofnear-death experiences, that of Dr A. S. Wiltse, an American doctor who ‘died’in Skiddy, Kansas, in the summer of 1889, and revived a few hours later.Wiltse’s own account was published in St Louis Medical and Surgical Journal forFebruary 1890.Wiltse ‘died’ of typhoid fever, after taking leave of his family and friends.After losing consciousness, he woke up, apparently still ‘inside’ his body, butfeeling quite unconnected with it. He was able to lie there and observe the wayhis bodily organs interacted with ‘himself’ — his ‘soul’. ‘I learned that theepidermis [outer layer of skin] was the outside boundary of the ultimatetissues, so to speak, of the soul.’ Then he felt himself being gently rockedback and forth as he separated from his body. There was a feeling of ‘theinnumerable snapping of small cords’, and he felt as if ‘he’ was retreating fromhis body, starting at the feet, towards his head. Then he found himself ‘peepingout’ from his skull, and feeling as if he had the shape and colour of ajellyfish. ‘As I emerged from the head I floated up and down … like a soapbubble … until I at last broke loose from the body and fell lightly to thefloor, where I slowly rose and expanded into the full stature of a man.’ Therewere two ladies in the room and he was embarrassed about being naked, but by thetime he reached the door, found himself clothed. He turned round and his elbowcame into contact with another man in the room; to his surprise, his elbowpassed through the man.He began to see the humorous side of the situation — with his dead body lying onthe bed — and bowed playfully. Then he laughed aloud; no one heard him. Hewalked out of the door, and noticed a thin cord, ‘like a spider’s web’, runningfrom his shoulders back to his body lying on the bed.He walked along the road — which, he says, he could see perfectly clearly — andagain lost consciousness. When he woke up, he seemed to be propelled forward bya pair of invisible hands. Ahead of him he saw three ‘prodigious rocks’, whileoverhead a dark cloud gathered. A voice speaking direct into his head told himthat if he passed beyond the rocks he would enter the ‘eternal world’, but thatif he chose to, he could return to his body. He was strongly tempted to passthrough a low archway between the rocks, but as he tried to peer over the‘boundary line’, saw a small black cloud and ‘knew I was to be stopped’. Hesuddenly woke up, lying on the bed, and insisted on telling everyone presentwhat had happened, although they urged him to conserve his strength.It is, as Myers points out, easy to dismiss this experience as some kind ofdream. But the point to note is that Wiltse had ceased to breathe, and beenpronounced dead by the doctor. It is, of course, possible that he lostconsciousness for four hours, and then woke up again; but it seems strange thathe should have such a precise and detailed ‘dream’ about dying when his pulsehad stopped.Where ‘survival’ is concerned, the most interesting cases are obviously thosethat cannot be dismissed as dreams or hallucinations. Myers cites the ‘redscratch’ case (mentioned in the previous chapter), and follows it up withanother equally convincing case that was investigated by the Society forPsychical Research. A farmer named Michael Conley, of Ionia, Chicasaw County,was found dead in an outhouse of an old people’s home, and his body was sent tothe morgue in Dubuque, Iowa. Since the workclothes he was wearing were filthy,they were tossed outside the door of the morgue. When the farmer’s daughter wastold that her father was dead, she fainted. And when she woke up, she insistedthat her father had appeared to her, and told her that he had sewed a roll ofdollar bills in the lining of his grey shirt. She described precisely theclothes he was wearing — including slippers — and said that the money waswrapped in a piece of an old red dress that had belonged to herself.No one took her dream seriously, assuming she was upset by her father’s death.But the doctor advised them that it might set her mind at rest if they fetchedthe clothes. No one in the family had any idea of the clothes the farmer waswearing at the time of his death. But the coroner confirmed that they wereprecisely as the daughter had described. And in the lining of the grey shirt,which still lay outside in the yard, they found a roll of money wrapped in apiece of red cloth and sewed into the bosom.Myers himself investigated many such cases, taking signed statements from allthe witnesses, and it was obviously this close involvement that finallyconvinced him of the reality of ‘survival’. And it seems significant thateveryone in that highly sceptical ‘Cambridge group’ who studied the evidence forlife after death ended by being convinced. Myers himself started from the sameassumption as Thomson Jay Hudson — that all paranormal phenomena may be due tothe extraordinary powers of the ‘subjective mind’ (or subliminal mind, as Myerspreferred to call it). Hudson used the evidence of hypnosis — like the patientwho made a cross at the end of twenty thousand minutes — to argue that theunconscious mind has unlimited powers of observation and memory, as well aspowers of telepathy and clairvoyance. According to Hudson, ‘spirits of the dead’are actually the unconscious mind playing games. In most cases, this explanationcan be stretched to fit the facts. For example, in the ‘red scratch’ case,Hudson would say that although the mother had covered up the red scratch withmake-up, the brother of the dead girl noticed it subconsciously as she lay inher coffin. And his own unconscious knowledge that his mother was close to deathled his ‘subliminal mind’ to conjure up the vision of his sister’s ghost,complete with red scratch, in order to provide his mother with comfort in theface of death … (This kind of ‘unconscious observation’ theory is sometimesknown as ‘cryptomnesia’, meaning buried memory.) But it is altogether moredifficult to stretch the ‘unconscious observation’ theory to fit cases like thatof Michael Conley. The farmer was far away from his family when he died, andthey had no idea of what he was wearing. The only explanation that fits the‘subliminal’ theory is that the daughter used a form of clairvoyance or secondsight to find out what clothes her father was wearing and about the money sewedinto his shirt. But as an explanation, this one is no more ‘scientific’ — and itis slightly more far-fetched — than the assumption that Michael Conley’s spiritappeared to his daughter in a dream.Two close friends played a major part in convincing Myers that human beingssurvive the death of the body: the Rev. Stainton Moses, and William James. Oddlyenough, both of them were originally even more sceptical than Myers.William Stainton Moses was in many ways a typical ‘sick sensitive’; his healthwas always poor and he was to die at fifty-three. He had to resign a number oflivings because of breakdowns in health. His original reaction to spiritualismwas one of hostility, and he declared that Lord Adare’s book on Daniel DunglasHome was ‘the dreariest twaddle he ever came across’. Robert Dale Owen’s secondbook on the paranormal, The Debateable Land, impressed him rather more. A doctornamed Speers finally persuaded him to attend a seance in 1872, and he wasimpressed when he received an accurate description of a friend who had died inthe north of England. He began attending seances by Daniel Dunglas Home, and wasfinally convinced by Home’s incredible phenomena. Soon after this, he realisedthat he himself was a medium. Odd things began to happen. Raps resounded fromaround the room. The toilet articles in his bedroom floated on to the bed andformed a cross. ‘Apports’ — like perfume and pin-cushions — fell from the air.Then, to his alarm, Moses was himself lifted up into the air. The third timethis happened he was thrown on to a table, then on to the sofa. He began holdingseances, at which the table floated up into the air, musical instruments playedand all kinds of scents wafted through the room. His honestly and integrity wereso obvious that he did more to convince Myers of the reality of mediumship thananyone else.Since table rapping took so long, Moses decided to try automatic writing. Hewould write his question at the top of a page, then sit with a pencil in hishand until it began to write. The handwriting was small and neat, and quiteunlike Moses’s own. Finally, Moses accumulated twenty-four volumes of theseautomatic scripts. After his death, they were passed on to Myers, who madeselections from them for a volume called Spirit Teachings. Together with AllenKardec’s Spirits’ Book, it forms the most interesting body of automatic writingin spiritualist literature.Like Myers, Stainton Moses was inclined to believe that all this writing camefrom his own unconscious mind. On one occasion, he asked the ‘spirit’ — whoseemed to be literate and intelligent — to quote the first line of Virgil’sAeneid. The ‘spirit’ wrote the answer correctly. Moses was struck by the thoughtthat, although he himself did not know the line consciously, he might well haverecollected it from his schooldays. So he asked the ‘spirit’ if it would go tothe bookcase, select the last book but one on the second shelf, and read out thelast paragraph on page 94. The spirit apparently did this without removing thebook from the shelf. Moses himself had no idea of what the book was, but the‘spirit’ quoted the paragraph word for word.This could, of course, be explained by the ‘cryptomnesia’ theory — that Moseshad read the paragraph at some time, and that his ‘subliminal mind’ could recallit word for word. So by way of convincing him, the ‘spirit’ decided to selectits own book. It dictated a paragraph about the poet Pope, and then told Mosesthat he would find it on the same shelf, in a book called Poetry, Romance andRhetoric. When Moses took this off the shelf, it opened at the right page.Spirit Teachings is a fascinating book because it contradicts Stainton Moses’sown creed in many respects. For a Christian clergyman, who had been brought upto believe that Christ is God, it must have been disconcerting to be told thatJesus was simply a great teacher, like many others, and that he himself wouldhave disowned most of the absurd fictions that men have foisted on him. On theday after this startling communication, Moses argued long and bitterly,attacking the ‘spirit teachings’, and calling them ‘silly and frivolous, if notmischievous’. But the ‘teachers’ (there were apparently forty-nine of them)refused to budge an inch, and explained to Moses that all human history is a‘progressive revelation of one and the same God’ — in other words, that the ideaof Jesus as the unique son of God is a purely human notion.Like Kardec’s Spirits’ Book, Moses’s Spirit Teachings also insists that thereare a great many mischievous spirits around, most of them the ‘earth bound’spirits of human beings who are either unaware they are dead or have no wish tomove ‘elsewhere’. He makes the interesting observation that execution is a sillyway to deal with criminals, since it lets loose a vengeful and murderous spiritthat will do its best to exert a harmful influence on the living — like Kardec,the Spirit Teachings states that spirits can enter into our minds, and that weare often influenced by them without knowing it.Perhaps the most impressive thing about Spirit Teachings is that Moses himselffelt so ambivalent about them. He published extracts in Light, the journal ofthe College of Psychic Science, but deliberately left out some of the harsherexchanges — in fact, there is evidence that he destroyed one of the notebooksbecause the ‘spirits’ were so uncomplimentary about him. Moreover, he went toconsiderable trouble to conceal the identities of the ‘forty-nine’communicators, obviously feeling that to reveal them — they included half adozen Old Testament prophets, not to mention Plato and Aristotle — would simplylead most people to assume he was mad or that the spirits were leg-pullers. Thenames of the ‘communicators’ were finally revealed more than half a centuryafter Moses’s death by a researcher called A. W. Trethewy.William James, the other major influence on Frederick Myers, was the son of afollower of Swedenborg. In spite of this — or perhaps because of it — hisattitude towards Spiritualism was originally one of bored indifference. LikeAlfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin, James began his career as anaturalist, and went on an expedition to explore the upper Amazon. Ill healthdrove him back to Boston; he studied medicine in Germany, and became a doctor.As a thinker he had little patience with involved metaphysics, and he developedthe doctrine called ‘pragmatism’, a kind of predecessor of modern LogicalPositivism. Stated very crudely, this says: ‘It doesn’t matter what you believeso long as it works.’ (James expressed it: ‘We have the right to believe at ourown risk any hypothesis that is live enough to tempt our will’ — a doctrine thatvictims of Nazism might feel to be a little simplistic.) As a psychologist — hisPrinciples of Psychology brought him fame — he believed that our emotions arebasically merely physical sensations (a doctrine known as the James-Lange theoryof emotions).It can well be imagined that a pragmatist like James — he invented theexpression ‘tough-minded’ — would have little patience with the doctrines ofSpiritualism. Reviewing a book called Planchette when he was a medical student,James complained that ‘we fail to discover among all the facts [about psychicalphenomena] a single one possessing either aesthetic beauty, intellectualoriginality or material usefulness’.When he came to England in 1882, James met Myers, Gurney and Podmore, and wasimpressed by their integrity and sincerity. But where the paranormal wasconcerned, he remained a sceptic. Then, in 1885, his mother-in-law, ElizaGibbens, heard about a remarkable young medium called Leonore Piper, and went tosee her. Mrs Piper went into a trance, and then proceeded to tell Mrs Gibbensall kinds of facts about members of the family, identifying most of them bytheir Christian names. When Mrs Gibbens recounted all this to her daughter andson-in-law, James was naturally intrigued. His innate scepticism suggested thatMrs Piper had managed to make vague general statements that sounded true. Thealternative was that she had somehow read Mrs Gibben’s mind. The next day,James’s sister-in-law went to see Mrs Piper, taking with her a letter inItalian. Mrs Piper held the letter to her forehead, and described the writer indetail. James was now sufficiently interested to go to see Mrs Piper himself.Mrs Piper had discovered her own psychic powers when she went to consult aBoston healer named J. R. Cocke, and fell into a trance. On the next occasionshe went to see Cocke, other people were present, including a certain JudgeFrost. As soon as Cocke put his hand on her forehead, Mrs Piper went into atrance, then went to the table and wrote a message on a sheet of paper, whichshe handed to the judge. It was, apparently, a message from his dead son, and hedeclared it ‘the most remarkable he had ever received’. Mrs Piper suddenlybecame a local celebrity.James went to see her in a highly critical frame of mind, together with hispretty and intelligent wife Alice. The Jameses took care that Mrs Piper shouldnot know their identity, or that they were connected with the previous‘sitters’. Mrs Piper went into her trance, and was then taken over by her‘control’, a Frenchman called Phinuit. And to James’s surprise, ‘Phinuit’mentioned several of the members of the family he had already described to MrsGibbens, spoke of Alice’s father as ‘Giblin’, and spoke of a child the Jameseshad lost in the previous year. The child had been called Herman; ‘Phinuit’called him ‘Herrin’ — a fairly accurate approximation.James went away badly puzzled; either Mrs Piper knew his wife’s family by sight,and had learned ‘by some lucky coincidence’ all kinds of intimate details aboutthem, or she possessed some kind of supernormal powers. He continued to visitMrs Piper, and after observing her for a long time, decided that she wasundoubtedly genuine. But were the ‘spirits’ genuine? James felt that ‘it is hardto reconcile’ the theory of spirit control with ‘the extreme triviality of mostof the communications’. Besides, ‘Phinuit’ — who claimed to be a Frenchman — hadonly the most rudimentary knowledge of French. The likeliest theory, Jamesdecided, was that ‘Phinuit’ was some aspect of Mrs Piper’s own personality — inother words, that Mrs Piper was a ‘split personality’, like Louis Vivé. But eventhat failed to explain how ‘Phinuit’ could get hold of so much accurateinformation. James kept sending his friends to her — all under pseudonyms — andMrs Piper continued to produce accurate information about dead relatives.James allowed himself to be convinced. He said later: ‘If you wish to upset thelaw that all crows are black, you must not seek to show that no crows are; it isenough if you can prove one single crow to be white.’ It was one of the mostsensible remarks ever made about spiritualism; the ‘crow’ James had in mind wasLeonore Piper.In 1885, an American branch of the Society for Psychical Research had beenfounded in Philadelphia by Professor William Barrett. The London Society sentover one of its most promising young investigators, Richard Hodgson, athoroughly ‘tough-minded’ individual, who had been to India to investigateMadame Blavatsky and decided she was a fraud. Hodgson immediately called on MrsPiper, and was staggered when she spoke to him about a girl called Jessie, towhom he had been engaged in Australia. Jessie had died while Hodgson was abroad.What convinced Hodgson even more than ‘Phinuit’ ’s accurate description ofJessie, was his report of a conversation that no one but Hodgson knew about.Hodgson, who had so far been a sceptic about psychical phenomena, had no doubtthat Mrs Piper was genuine. He signed her up to devote her services to theSociety for Psychical Research — for £200 a year — and in 1889 she came toEngland. Hodgson even went to the length of having her shadowed by privatedetectives to see whether she had some private information network. Myers, Lodgeand the Sidgwicks tested her extensively, and decided that, whatever the natureof her powers, they were undoubtedly genuine. But then, they could have beenbased on telepathy.What finally convinced Hodgson was a case involving a young man named GeorgePellew, who had been killed in a fall in 1892. Hodgson — who had known Pellew —took another old friend of Pellew’s along to a sitting with Mrs Piper. ‘Phinuit’immediately recognised Pellew’s friend — or, rather, ‘Pellew’s spirit’recognised him, and called him by his correct name. The friend removed a stud hewas wearing and handed it to ‘Phinuit’. George Pellew immediately said (through‘Phinuit’) ‘That’s mine. Mother gave you that.’ The friend denied this, but helater turned out to be wrong. Pellew’s stepmother had removed the studs from thebody, and when the friend asked for some memento, it was she who suggestedsending them to him. Here was a fact that Mrs Piper could not have learned bytelepathy.‘Phinuit’ went on to talk about a couple named James and Mary Howard, with whomPellew had lived for a time in New York. The friend only knew the Howardsslightly, and Hodgson did not know them at all; but ‘Pellew’ went on to speak oftheir daughter Katherine, and sent her a message: ‘Tell her, she’ll know. I willsolve the problems, Katherine.’ This meant nothing to Hodgson or the friend. Butwhen James Howard was told about it the next day, he had no doubt that themessage came from Pellew, who used to have long discussions about Time, Spaceand Eternity with Katherine Howard, and had used the phrase ‘I will solve theproblems, Katherine’ while he was alive.Myers and Hodgson were finally convinced by Mrs Piper that the messages reallycame from spirits. But James continued to feel that Myers’s ‘subliminal mind’theory was as good as any. It was another fourteen years before he was willingto concede that the subliminal mind could not explain all the phenomena. InDecember 1905, Hodgson was playing handball at a club in Boston when hecollapsed and died. That night, Mrs Piper dreamed she was trying to enter a darktunnel, and that a bearded man like Hodgson was trying to prevent her; the nextmorning, she learned of his death. Eight days later, she was holding a pencilwhen her hand suddenly wrote the word ‘Hodgson’. And from then on, ‘Hodgson’began to communicate through Mrs Piper. William James and his son attended aseance, and James had to admit that this was the authentic Hodgson personality.Yet although he was willing to admit that much, he was still not prepared toconcede that Hodgson’s ‘spirit’ had somehow survived his death. He suggestedthat he was confronting some kind of ‘after-image’ of Hodgson, like a film orgramophone record. What James did not explain is how a film or gramophone recordcould answer questions about Hodgson’s life, and convince a number of peoplethat it was Hodgson speaking. James himself would die in 1910, and — as we haveseen in the last chapter — would convince Professor James Hyslop of his survivalof death by sending the cryptic message about red pyjamas via a medium who hadnever heard of either James or Hyslop …Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death concludes with the longaccount of Mrs Piper; she was, apparently, Myers’s ‘white crow’ as well asJames’s. Myers never lived to see his masterpiece in print; his health had begunto fail soon after the embarrassing business of Ada Goodrich-Freer. (MissGoodrich-Freer commented balefully that people who crossed her often came to abad end.) William James wrote a long review of the book when it finally cameout, two years after Myers’s death, and the tone of the review is far from totalenthusiasm: ‘The work, whatever weaknesses it may have, strikes me as at least amasterpiece of coordination and unification. The voluminous arsenal of‘cases’ … might make the most erudite naturalist or historian envy him …’ Inretrospect, James seems less than generous. It is true that the book has certainweaknesses which Myers would have undoubtedly removed if he had known aboutthem: for example, he cites Ada Goodrich-Freer’s experiments in crystal gazing,and we know enough about that lady to feel that most of her claims must beviewed with suspicion. Neither did Myers know that his secretary of many years,George Albert Smith — the hypnotist who demonstrated the nine different levelsof trance memory — would one day be accused of cheating in some of his earliestexperiments in Brighton with a young man named Douglas Blackburn. (It is truethat there was no earthly reason why Smith should have continued to cheat whenhe began to work for Myers, and his severest critics concede that he was agenuine hypnotist. But again, the least breath of this kind of suspicion makesevidence valueless for scientific purposes.) Having said which, it is necessaryto concede that Human Personality towers above all other books on psychicalresearch like a mountain above foothills.Where the ‘white crow’, Leonore Piper, is concerned, one intriguing questionremains. If ‘Phinuit’ was not a genuine Frenchman, who was he? Eleanor Sidgwickstudied the problem for twenty-three years before — in 1915 — she announced herown conclusion: that ‘Phinuit’ was a fragment of Mrs Piper’s personality — amultiple personality, like Clara Fowler’s alter-ego ‘Sally’. And later studiesconducted with other mediums — like Mrs Osborne Leonard and Eileen Garrett —make this practically a certainty. In 1935, the researcher Whately Caringtongave Mrs Leonard a word-association test — saying a word, and waiting for MrsLeonard to reply with a word she associated with it. He made the interestingdiscovery that Mrs Leonard and her ‘control’ ‘Feda’ were like mirror images asfar as words were concerned. When Mrs Leonard reacted slowly to a word, ‘Feda’reacted quickly, and vice versa. And the same was found of Mrs Garrett and her‘control’ ‘Uvani’. This could not be coincidence. Ever since the earlieststudies of multiple personality, researchers had noticed that the patient andhis — or her — alter-ego had diametrically opposite qualities. In 1811, a girlcalled Mary Reynolds, who lived in Pennsylvania, fell into a deep sleep fortwenty hours, and when she woke up, had become another person. The original Marywas a dull girl, hyper-cautious and subject to fits of depression; the new‘Mary’ was merry, irresponsible and flighty. For twenty years or so the Marysalternated, then they slowly blended, creating an altogether more satisfactorypersonality. It was almost as if Mary’s personality was made out of a child’sconstruction kit, and Mary 1 used up one set of attributes, while Mary 2 usedthe rest. Janet’s patient Leonie — the one who could be summoned from half amile away by the hypnotist — had the same kind of mirror-image alter-ego. Thisalter-ego flatly denied that she was ‘Leonie’, declaring that Leonie was astupid idiot. Lady Una Troubridge, who published a study of Mrs Leonard in 1922,noticed that Teda’ seemed to feel contemptuous of the medium.But if ‘Phinuit’, ‘Feda’, ‘Uvani’ and the rest are simply personality fragmentsof the medium, how is it possible to take them seriously? The clue may lie inthe case of Louis Vivé, whose alter-ego was also clearly his ‘right-brain self’.We have seen that the right brain is basically what Thomson Jay Hudson meant bythe ‘subjective mind’, and what Myers meant by the ‘subliminal mind’. If theyare correct, the right brain is the source of psychic powers, or at least a kindof receiver and amplifier. Under hypnosis, the left brain is put to sleep, andthe right is able to exercise these powers without the unnerving criticalscrutiny of the left. Wallace and Barrett became interested in the paranormalbecause they observed hypnotised subjects who could share their own sensations —that is, whose right brains could telepathically pick up their feelings. If thistheory is correct, then ‘Feda’ and the rest were pure right-brain entities whomay have been able to ‘pick up’ messages from ‘spirits’.This could also explain their failures. After ‘Phinuit’, Mrs Piper wascontrolled by a whole group of spirits who claimed to be the same ones who haddictated to Stainton Moses. But when asked about their names — which they hadsecretly communicated to Stainton Moses — they gave the wrong answers. Onepsychologist — Stanley Hall — invented a niece called Bessie Beals and asked MrsLeonard’s ‘control’ to get in touch with her. The ‘control’ obliged, and thefictitious Bessie Beals passed on all kinds of messages. The right brain — orsubjective mind — is enormously suggestible; it can conjure up a ‘spirit’ aseasily as a hypnotised person can conjure up an illusion that someone is sittingin an empty chair. The fact that ‘Phinuit’ was able to give so much accurateinformation about George Pellew, including facts unknown to the ‘sitters’,argues strongly that he was a real ‘spirit’, making use of Mrs Piper’s rightbrain as a telephone line.We have not yet finished with Myers. In fact, we might say that the part playedby Myers after his death — or by someone who called himself Myers — was moreimportant than the part he played during his life.Myers had often remarked that one of the few ways for ‘communicators’ to provebeyond all doubt that they were spirits of the dead would be to give separatebits of a message to several mediums, so they only made sense when fittedtogether. That would completely rule out telepathy, cryptomnesia or right-brainleg-pulling. If we are to believe the evidence of the celebrated series ofcommunications known as the Cross Correspondences, this is precisely whathappened.Myers died on 17 January 1901. A few years before his death, he had handedOliver Lodge a message in a sealed envelope; it was to be kept sealed until somespirit purporting to be Myers should claim to repeat the message.Two of Myers’s closest friends at Cambridge were Dr Arthur Verrall, a classicalscholar, and his wife Margaret, a lecturer in classics at Newnham College. AfterMyers’s death, Margaret Verrall decided to try automatic writing, to see if shecould establish contact with Myers. She was a rationalist and a sceptic, but shethought it worth a try. Her hand was soon scribbling its way across the page,but the messages seemed muddled and fragmentary. Then one day there came amessage in rather poor Latin, signed ‘Myers’. From then on, the messages flowedmore freely. And one of them contained the statement: ‘Myers’s sealed envelopeleft with Lodge … It has in it the words from the Symposium about love bridgingthe chasm.’ The message was hastily conveyed to Lodge, who opened the envelope.To his disappointment, it contained nothing about Plato. It said: ‘If I canrevisit any earthly scene, I should choose the Valley in the grounds ofHallsteads, Cumberland.’ Then someone recalled that Myers had referred to theSymposium — Plato’s dialogue about love — in a privately printed book calledFragments of an Inner Life. It had been written as a memorial to Annie Marshall,wife of Myers’s cousin Walter, with whom Myers had been in love. Annie hadcommitted suicide by drowning herself in Ullswater, and had lived in Hallsteads,Cumberland. So there was a connection between the sealed message and Plato’sSymposium.Soon after this, Richard Hodgson was holding a seance with Mrs Piper in Boston,and he suggested that Mrs Piper’s ‘control’ — now a spirit called Rector —should try to appear to Margaret Verrall’s daughter Helen, holding a spear.(Helen Verrall was also a gifted psychic.) ‘Rector’ misheard and asked: ‘Why asphere?’ Hodgson corrected him, and ‘Rector’ agreed to try the experiment forthe next week. Three days later, Margaret Verrall received a message thatincluded the Greek word ‘sphairos’ (sphere) and the Latin Volatile ferrum’(flying iron) Virgil’s description of a spear. Next time Hodgson sat with MrsPiper, ‘Rector’ said he had carried out the suggestion, and showed Mrs Verrall a‘sphear’.Before we go any further, it must be admitted that most of the ‘evidence’ of theCross Correspondences is just as infuriatingly vague and ambiguous as this. Ithas never been published complete, and if it was, it would occupy several largevolumes. It is undoubtedly the most convincing evidence of ‘survival’ everobtained by mediums, and also the most boring. A sceptic might well ask why, ifMyers wanted to prove he was still alive, he could not have told Mrs Verrallthat his sealed message referred to Hallsteads in Cumberland, instead of talkingmisleadingly about Plato’s Symposium, and why, if he wanted to establish aconnection between Mrs Piper and Margaret Varrall, he did not write in English:‘Hodgson asked me to show you a spear.’ One possible answer may lie in astatement made by ‘Myers’ in one of the scripts:The nearest simile I can find to express the difficulties of sending a message —is that I appear to be standing behind a sheet of frosted glass which blurssight and deadens sounds — dictating feebly to a reluctant and somewhat obtusesecretary.Stainton Moses had also been told that the spirits who wrote out messages were akind of secretary or amanuensis:The intelligences who are able to [practise] … direct writing … are few. Mostfrequently the actual writing is done by one who is accustomed to manifest inthat way, and who acts … as the amanuensis of the spirits who wish tocommunicate. In many cases several spirits are concerned …In a moment of exasperation, William James suggested another explanation for thevagaries of the ‘spirits’:I confess that at times I have been tempted to believe that the Creator haseternally intended this department of nature to remain baffling, to prompt ourcuriosities and hopes and suspicions all in equal measure, so that, althoughghosts and clairvoyances and raps and messages from spirits … can never be fullyexplained away, they can also never be susceptible of full corroboration.Or, to put it another way, it looks as if the ‘spirits’ have been ordered toprovide just enough evidence to convince those who are willing to be convinced,but never enough to win over the sceptics. This notion — which we might callJames’s Law — must have crossed the mind of everybody who has taken an interestin the paranormal. The evidence is abundant and plentiful, but it always leavesroom for doubt.Having said that, it must be admitted that some of the evidence of the CrossCorrespondences is very convincing indeed. At an early stage, Mrs Verrallreceived a sentence: ‘Record the bits, and when fitted together they will makethe whole.’ Soon after this, Rudyard Kipling’s sister, Alice Fleming (who livedin India), decided to try automatic writing, and quickly received a messagewhich read: ‘My Dear Mrs Verrall [it sounds as though Myers had got his‘secretaries’ mixed up] I am very anxious to speak to some of the old friends —Miss J — and to A W. This referred to Alice Johnson, Secretary of the Societyfor Psychical Research, and to Arthur W. Verrall, Mrs Verrall’s husband. Themessage then went on to give a description of Arthur Verrall, and ended themessage: ‘Send this to Mrs Verrall’s, 5, Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge.’ This wasMrs Verrall’s correct address, but Alice Fleming had no way of knowing this. Sheknew Mrs Verrall’s name — having read Myers’s Human Personality — but nothingelse; she had never been in Cambridge. Mrs Fleming duly contacted MargaretVerrall at 5 Selwyn Gardens, and became another in the group of mediums who tookdown the Cross Correspondences. (She called herself Mrs Holland, because herfamily disapproved of psychical research.) Most of Alice Fleming’s earlymessages were signed ‘F’ — a signature Myers frequently used.On another occasion, Alice Fleming received a detailed description of a room. Itwas later recognised as a very exact description of Margaret Verrall’s sittingroom. There was only one inaccuracy; the description said there was a bust inthe corner. When Mrs Verrall mentioned this to a friend, the friend said: ‘Butsurely you have got a bust in the corner of your room?’ Mrs Verrall had somekind of filter, which looked — in the dark corner — very much like a bust on apedestal.Later, other ‘communicators’ joined in the game, and claimed to be HenrySidgwick and Edmund Gurney. But the conundrums remained incredibly complicated.One of Mrs Piper’s ‘sitters’ asked ‘Myers’ if he would indicate attempts totransmit Cross Correspondences by drawing a triangle enclosed in a circle. Aweek later, Margaret Verrall received a message which ended with a triangleinside a circle, as well as a triangle in a semicircle. Two months later,‘Myers’ spoke through Mrs Piper and stated that he had given Mrs Verrall acircle and tried to draw a triangle, but ‘it did not appear’. Here we seem tohave the typical muddle caused by sheets of frosted glass and obtusesecretaries.Even this simple case has more complications. Just after the suggestion that‘Myers’ should use a triangle in a circle, Mrs Verrall produced a script thatbegan: ‘… an anagram would be better. Tell him that — rats, star, tars and soon … or again tears, stare.’ Five days later, Mrs Verrall’s script began with ananagram: Aster (Latin for star) and teras (Greek for wonder). It also talkedabout hope, and quoted Browning. Two weeks later, Mrs Piper’s script said: ‘Ireferred also to Browning again. I referred to Hope and Browning … I also saidstar.’ A week after this, Helen Verrall (the daughter) received a script thatbegan with a drawing of a star, and included a reference to Browning’s PiedPiper of Hamelin. But most readers might be forgiven for feeling that suchcomplicated puzzles defeat their own purpose.In 1908, another amateur medium joined the group. She was WinifredCoombe-Tennant, who was related to Myers by marriage (Myers’s wife was thesister of Mrs Coombe-Tennant’s husband). She began receiving messages signed byMyers and Gurney. Then, in 1909, the script explained that Myers and Gurney weretrying a new experiment — to make the words enter Mrs Coombe-Tennant’s mindspontaneously. Soon she was not only ‘picking up’ words that floated into hermind, but receiving clear impressions of the personalities who were sendingthem; she could sense whether it was Myers or Gurney immediately. Theconversations were telepathic; on the first occasion, Myers’s voice — inside herhead — asked ‘Can you hear what I am saying?’, and she replied mentally ‘Yes.’The written scripts continued, and often included words that she had ‘heard’.Later, ‘Myers’ asked her to bring Sir Oliver Lodge along to her automaticwriting sessions. Mrs Coombe-Tennant disliked the idea, but finally gave way.Then Gurney asked if G. W. Balfour could also come along — he had been a friendof Gurney’s, and knew a great deal about philosophy. The result was oftentiresome for Mrs Coombe-Tennant. She had to sit there, acting as ‘secretary’ inphilosophical discussions that she did not understand. After Balfour had given alecture at Cambridge, ‘Sidgwick’ started a discussion with him about themind-body relationship, epiphenomenalism and interactionism. Although MrsCoombe-Tennant (or, as she preferred to be known, Mrs Willett) was intelligent,she had no idea of what they were talking about, and at one point, as ‘Sidgwick’tried to put words into her mind, she lost her temper and exploded: ‘I can’tthink why people talk about such stupid things!’ Her irritation is far moreconvincing than any amount of ‘corroboration’.Taken as a whole, the Cross Correspondences and the Willett scripts are amongthe most convincing evidence that at present exists for ‘life after death’. Foranyone who is prepared to devote weeks to studying them, they prove beyond allreasonable doubt that Myers, Gurney and Sidgwick went on communicating afterdeath. The problem remains: why did they not adopt some straightforwardsuggestion — like the idea of using a triangle in a circle — that would makethem far more simple — and therefore more convincing to sceptics? The answer —if we can accept James’s Law — is that they were not out to make wholesaleconversions. Which is, of course, just the kind of answer that will make thesceptics shrug contemptuously …‘Myers’ was nothing if not persistent. In November 1924, an Irish medium,Geraldine Cummins, was invited to tea with a retired captain and his wife; herfriend Miss E. B. Gibbes was also invited along. Geraldine Cummins, daughter ofProfessor Ashley Cummins, had tried automatic writing for the first time a yearbefore, and found that she was a natural medium. The captain and his wife werehoping to contact friends through the ‘ouija board’*, a glass on a smoothsurface, surrounded by the letters of the alphabet; when fingers of the sittersare laid lightly on top of the glass, it may move from letter to letter,spelling out words. On this occasion, the board quickly spelled out the name‘Frederick Myers’ and asked: ‘Do you know my friends?’ Asked which friends, hereplied Barrett and Balfour. He then explained that he wanted to establish a‘cross correspondence’. The captain and his wife were rather disappointed tohave Myers communicating instead of their own friends, so the session came to anend. But ‘Myers’ continued to communicate, and a week later announced hispresence at another of Miss Cummins’s automatic writing sessions. Asked aboutthe problems of communication, he explained that their method was to ‘impress’the ‘inner mind’ of the medium with the message, and that the inner mind wouldthen send it on to the brain. ‘The brain is a mere merchanism. The inner mind islike soft wax, it receives our thoughts … but it must produce the words thatclothe it. That is what makes cross-correspondence so very difficult.’ Thiscertainly seems to explain why the Cross Correspondences often sound so muddled.Myers soon announced an interesting project — to try to communicate through MrsLeonard’s ‘control’ ‘Feda’ immediately after communicating through GeraldineCummins. He suggested that the subject of the message should be telepathy andthe views of his friend Lord Balfour. Miss Gibbes pointed out that this was nota good idea, because she had recently been at a public meeting at which Balfourhad spoken about telepathy, and it had been reported in the press. So it couldbe objected that the medium was already thinking about the subject. ‘Myers’agreed, and said that in that case, he would talk about the book he had intendedto write before his death — a book expressing his conviction that life afterdeath had been proved beyond all doubt.The next day, Miss Gibbes hurried along to see Mrs Osborne Leonard, making quitesure she dropped no hint about her purpose in coming. ‘Feda’, Mrs Leonard’s‘control’, said that there were several spirits hanging around waiting tocommunicate. Miss Gibbes said she had somebody special in mind — an importantman. At this, ‘Feda’ announced that an elderly man was present. Trying to ‘pickup’ his name, she could only get the impression of a capital M. The man, shesaid, was showing her poetry, which was one of his main interests — ‘he seems tohave been rather clever in understanding old poets — Virgil particularly’. Shethen added the important comment: ‘He is keeping an appointment with you.’ Soonafter this, she announced the man’s Christian name: ‘Fred — I keep gettingFred.’ (Myers was known to his friends as Fred.) And she added that Miss Gibbeshad been in touch with Fred on the previous day.The next time ‘Myers’ appeared at a session with Geraldine Cummins, heapologised for not coming over very clearly, and explained that he had hadproblems with ‘Feda’, who was too ‘lively’ (he obviously meant scatterbrained)and that there were too many other thoughts buzzing around the room at the time.When Miss Gibbes said she thought he had ‘come over’ very well, ‘Myers’ replied;‘Good, you surprise me.’ All the same, he said, he felt the session had been afailure. What he had wanted to get across was that he had intended to write abook declaring his total belief in life after death. But ‘Feda’ had simply notpicked up what he was trying to say. Miss Gibbes’s feeling was that in spite ofthis, the attempt to communicate through two mediums on two different days hadbeen extremely successful. It is difficult not to agree with her. These sessionsare also important because they give us a clear idea of the infuriating problemsapparently faced by ‘spirits’ in trying to make contact with the living — ratherlike someone trying to make himself heard over a very bad telephone line, withcontinual interruptions from ‘crossed lines’.The books that grew out of these communications — The Road to Immortality andBeyond Human Personality — will strike some readers as fascinating, and some asutterly tiresome rubbish. The following is a typical sentence:The purpose of existence may be summed up in a phrase — the evolution of mind inmatter that varies in degree and kind — so that the mind develops throughmanifestation, and in an ever-expanding universe ever increases in power andgains thereby the true conception of reality.It sounds the kind of meaningless waffle churned out by fake messiahs. But oncloser examination, it not only makes sense, but very good sense. This notionthat mind is attempting to ‘insert’ itself into matter is common to all forms ofevolutionary vitalism, from Hegel to Shaw. It goes on to state that mattervaries in degrees and kind — implying that it may be either solid or beyond therange of our senses. (Elsewhere, ‘Myers’ states that it is all a question ofrates of vibration — a view that has been made commonplace by modern physics.)The mind develops through this process of inserting itself into matter, andslowly develops power and a deeper sense of reality. When we look at it again,we can see that the original impression of vagueness is due to the lack ofpunctuation, which gives it an air of ambiguity. According to ‘Myers’, the‘spirit’ who communicates has to use the medium’s own intellectual apparatus(and, presumably, her vocabulary). And this, presumably, is why so much ‘spiritcommunication’ gives an impression of feeble-mindedness. (‘Myers’ is the firstto admit that many ‘spirits’ are feeble-minded.)This question of what is communicated must be left until later. For the moment,the question is whether it can be seriously accepted as a communication from the‘dead’. And, all things considered, the answer to this must be in theaffirmative. If Geraldine Cummins and E. B. Gibbes are telling the truth aboutthe circumstances in which the communications were received, then it iscertainly a reasonable assumption that the same ‘spirit’ tried to speak throughMiss Cummins and Mrs Leonard.The sense of genuineness is even stronger in a later book of the ‘scripts’ ofGeraldine Cummins, Swan on a Black Sea, which purports to be a series ofcommunications from ‘Mrs Willett’ — Winifred Coombe-Tennant, the automaticwriter who learned to ‘hear’ Myers and Gurney directly. She died in 1956, at theage of 81, keeping her ‘Willett’ identity secret to the end. A year later,William Salter, president of the Society for Psychical Research, asked GeraldineCummins if she would try to ‘contact’ the mother of a certain Major HenryCoombe-Tennant. Geraldine Cummins knew nothing whatever about MrsCoombe-Tennant. On 28 August 1957, ‘Astor’, Geraldine Cummin’s ‘control’,protested irritably about the difficult task she had been set — contacting themother of someone she had never heard of. But from Salter’s letter she picked upa feeling of ‘writing and secrets to be kept’. Then she declared she had beenapproached by a fragile old lady in her eighties. Asked for the old lady’s name,‘Astor’ said: ‘Win or Wyn.’ And from that point onward, Winifred Coombe-Tennanttook over, and produced an incredible body of personal reminiscences, full ofaccurate statements about Mrs Coombe-Tennant’s life. It is also one of the mostdirect and personal documents ever ‘dictated’ by a so-called spirit. Even ifGeraldine Cummins had been a fraud, it would have been impossible for her tohave found out so much intimate detail about the life of a woman she had nevermet. The only other reasonable hypothesis is that Geraldine Cummins and MrsCoombe-Tennant’s children collaborated to concoct the scripts, which seemsunlikely.But once again we encounter the central paradox of the ‘survival’ problem. Swanon a Black Sea is perhaps the most convincing proof of the reality of life afterdeath ever set down on paper. Yet it does not actually say anything in the leastimportant. For a message from the ‘other side’, the mysterious realm of theall-knowing dead, it seems curiously banal, like a conversation overheard at ajumble sale in the church hall. It will convert no sceptic to the doctrines ofSpiritualism because no sceptic would take the trouble to read it. And so onceagain we encounter James’s Law: that perplexing mandate that seems to assertthat the evidence for life after death shall always be strong enough to reassurethe converted, but never conclusive enough to have the slightest influence onthe unbelievers.*New York Review, 28 February 1985, p. 16.*See pp. 119–20.*Lectures on Psychical Research, p. 173.*Daniel Keyes, The Minds of Billy Milligan.*The Enigma of Survival, p. 15.*So called from the French ‘Oui’ and the German ‘ja’."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXDR STEINER AND THE PROBLEM OF REINCARNATIONOn the evening of 22 August 1900, a slim, mild-looking man presented himself atthe library of the Theosophical Society in the Kaiser Friedrich Strasse, Berlin,and introduced himself as Dr Rudolf Steiner. The Countess Brockdorff, who wassecretary of the Lodge, looked at him without any great curiosity. RudolfSteiner was almost forty years old, and his accent had a touch of thelower-Austrian peasant. The pince-nez glasses, attached by a cord, gave him thelook of an absent-minded schoolmaster. His smile was friendly but shy. Thecountess knew that he had written books about Goethe, and lectured about historyand politics to the Workers’ Educational Association. He was to lecture thatevening on Nietzsche — not entirely a suitable subject for Theosophists, whobelieved that most of the world’s deepest wisdom came from ancient India, forNietzsche, after all, was an atheist and an arch-rebel.When Dr Steiner began to lecture, the countess’s doubts seemed justified. Hisvoice was a little monotonous, and his sentences were sometimes abstract andinvolved. And his own attitude to Nietzsche seemed rather odd. Dr Steinerobviously believed in a spiritual reality underlying the universe, and Nietzscheundoubtedly did not. So what on earth was Dr Steiner doing lecturing about him?Yet when one grew used to the rather dull manner, there was something endearingabout Dr Steiner. His eyes twinkled with friendliness, and as he talked, heseemed to take the audience into his confidence. After the lecture, in answer toa question, Steiner described his visit to Nietzsche in Weimar. The philosopherwas already insane — he would die only three days after Steiner’s lecture — andSteiner told of his beautiful forehead and calm eyes, which gazed blankly intospace. Suddenly, said Steiner, he had a deep inner-perception of the realNietzsche, as if he could see his soul hovering over his head …As she was saying goodnight, the countess asked Steiner whether he meant he hadliterally seen Nietzsche’s soul hovering over his head. And to her surprise,Steiner answered: ‘What I saw with the eyes of the spirit was Nietzsche’s astralbody pressing against his physical body.’ ‘You saw it?’ He smiled at her. ‘Yes,but not with the physical eyes.’ Then he said goodnight. He was certainly anintriguing man. By general request, the countess asked him to come back againthe following week to talk to them about his own mystical interpretation ofGoethe’s puzzling story called Fairy Tale. And this time he spoke with suchquiet authority that no one had any doubt that he was speaking from innerexperience. Steiner was asked if he would consent to give a series of lecturesto the Theosophical Society, and when he suggested a series on the greatmystics, they accepted with enthusiasm.That winter, Steiner became the darling of the Berlin Theosophical Society. Itwas true that a few members had their reservations; what he was saying oftenseemed to contradict the ideas of its founder, Madame Blavatsky, and its presentleader, Annie Besant. When someone pointed this out to Steiner, he only smiledmildly and said: ‘Is that so?’ Yet it was obvious that he was not out tochallenge or shock. He was speaking from direct personal experience. And hiserudition was formidable; he seemed to have read every important writer of thepast three centuries. One rather beautiful young lady, Marie von Sivers — anactress who had been studying in Paris — made no secret of her total adoration,and Dr Steiner was obviously charmed and overwhelmed by her attitude ofdiscipleship; he seemed to blossom and become more confident. Some members shooktheir heads, knowing that he was married. The countess had never met his wife,but had been told that she was a peasant woman — at any rate, definitely not a‘lady’ — and that she was many years Steiner’s senior …And then — it seemed to happen overnight — Dr Steiner had become head of theBerlin Lodge of the Theosophical Society, and was being accepted by anincreasing number of people as a kind of messiah. Its membership increasedremarkably. Mrs Besant had met Steiner, and been impressed. She had seemed alittle concerned about the strange, mystical Christianity preached by Steiner —but then, Madame Blavatsky had taught that all religions are roads to the sametruth, so that was no cause for alarm. Steiner certainly seemed to accept MadameBlavatsky’s basic teaching — that the present human race is the fifth ‘rootrace’ (the fourth were the inhabitants of Atlantis) — and that we all go throughmany reincarnations. He also professed to be able to read the ‘Akasic records’ —those invisible records of history that have been stored up on the cosmic ether— and talked with staggering authority about the childhood of Christ and thevarious spiritual movements in Western history.Within ten years, Steiner had become one of the most famous men in Europe, andhis following was enormous. In due course, he broke with the TheosophicalSociety — when Mrs Besant tried to introduce a new ‘messiah’ called JidduKrishnamurti, a mere boy — but the German Theosophists regarded him with suchreverence that almost all of them preferred to follow him into his own neworganisation — which he called the Anthroposophical Society. By the year 1912,many of Steiner’s followers believed that he was an avatar — an incarnation ofthe God-principle, like Buddha and Christ, sent to earth to bring enlightenment— and that Anthroposophy would one day become the new world religion, replacingall those that had gone before … Steiner himself spoke of building a newmystical centre, a magnificent temple, perhaps in Munich.The hopes of a great new religious revival all came to nothing. Just as itseemed to be coming about, the Great War burst like a storm, and for the nextfour years, Europe had other things to think about besides Anthroposophy. Therewere even unpleasant rumours that Steiner had paved the way for Germany’s defeatby giving bad advice to General von Moltke, whose wife was a Steiner disciple.Steiner built his ‘temple’ — at Dornach, in Switzerland — but it never becamemore than a cult-centre. When the war ended, Steiner probably knew that it hadcost him his chance of becoming the founder of a new religion. He went onlecturing indefatigably, but a kind of weariness set in, and he died in March1925, not yet in his mid-sixties. His name remained well known largely becauseit was associated with a new type of school, and with ‘natural’ agriculturalmethods.And yet, in his way, Rudolf Steiner, the man who became a ‘messiah’ between hisfortieth and fiftieth years, was one of the most remarkable spiritual teachersof the twentieth century, the man who blended the Christianity of earlier epochswith the new ‘spiritualism’ that was trying to replace it.To understand why, we must first say a word about Madame Blavatsky. Born HelenaHahn in 1831 — thirty years before Steiner’s birth — the future founder ofTheosophy was the daughter of a female Russian novelist. She was a plump buthighly strung little girl. Sitting one day gazing into space, with a pencil inher hand, she was astonished when her hand began to write. The ‘communicator’announced herself as Tekla Lebendorff, an aunt of an officer in the regiment ofHelena’s father. Helena’s father became so fascinated by all the informationthat Aunt Tekla gave about herself that he used his position to check on her inthe government archives. To his amazement, everything she said about herselfproved to be true. It seemed that the dead could communicate. Then came a shock.One day, Helena met Aunt Tekla’s officer nephew, and learned that Aunt Tekla wasstill alive and well. And yet the information dictated by her was accurate. Howcould that be?Oddly enough, this curious anomaly might be regarded as one of the moreconvincing proofs that man can survive death. One of the major objections to‘survival’ is that sleep seems to contradict it. After all, our ‘astral body’ issupposed to separate from the physical body in sleep, just as in death. So whydo we not feel ourselves floating out of the physical body when we fall asleep,just as we are supposed to do in death? The answer of Spiritualism is that the‘astral body’ does wander off during sleep, but we experience total amnesiaabout its activities. A medium — or spirit-control — is said to be able toattract the spirit of a sleeping person just as easily as that of a dead one.This sounds highly unlikely, but that is what seems to have happened in the caseof Helena Blavatsky. It also happened in a well-authenticated case of thetwentieth century, when a ‘spirit’ called Gordon Davis communicated through amedium with Dr S. G. Soal. Davis gave an abundance of precise information aboutwhere his widow was living, and described the house — on a sea front — inconsiderable detail. When Soal finally located the house — in Southend-on-Sea —it was all as Davis had described it. But Davis was alive and well and sittingin front of the fire. Here, then, as in the case of Tekla Lebendorff, we seem tohave some kind of proof that the ‘astral body’ does separate from the physicalbody in sleep, just as it is supposed to in death.Helena Hàhn made an unhappy marriage to a man called Blavatsky, declined tosurrender her virginity, and ran away from home at the age of eighteen, in 1849,the year after the strange rappings began in the home of the Fox sisters. Whenshe arrived in New York in 1873, she herself had developed into a formidablemedium who could make raps resound from all over the room. A newspaper reporter— Henry Steel Olcott — sent to interview her became a disciple, and supportedher while her hand scribbled — at an incredible pace — a book called IsisUnveiled, that was to make her a celebrity. And, having achieved fame, Helenadecided that her spiritual home was in India, and took her newly foundedTheosophical Society to Bombay. Disaster came in 1884, when the Society forPsychical Research sent Richard Hodgson to investigate her claims, and ahousekeeper with a grudge managed to convince him that Madame Blavatsky’s spiritcommunications were all a fraud. Her reputation never recovered from hisdenunciation in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research. She diedof heart disease at the age of sixty, in 1891. But her new doctrine of‘Theosophy’ — a combination of Hinduism, Buddhism and Spiritualism — continuedto have a worldwide influence. We may say that Madame Blavatsky’s form ofspiritualism achieved a far greater success than the version promulgated by theFox sisters in Rochester in 1850, which never became more than a minority cult.Rudolf Steiner was the son of working-class Austrians; his father was atelegraph operator on the Austrian railway. In the material sense, his childhoodwas ‘deprived’; they were very poor. But he was brought up amid beautifulscenery — mountains and forests — and, being a naturally bright boy, he made themost of the books that were available.He was sitting in the station waiting room one day when a strange woman came in,a woman whose looks resembled those of the rest of the family. She went to themiddle of the room, made some curious gestures, and said: ‘Try to help me if youcan — now and later on.’ Then she walked to the big old stove and vanished intoit. The child had enough self-possession to decide not to tell his parents whathe had seen; they were good Catholics, and would have scolded him forsuperstition. But he noticed that his father became sad and thoughtful in thefollowing days. Later, he learned that a female relative he had never met hadcommitted suicide at the time he had seen the woman in the waiting room. And,since she had asked for help, it followed that she was, in some sense, stillalive …Telling this story later in one of his lectures, Steiner said:From that time onward a soul life began to develop in the boy which made himconscious of worlds from which not only external trees or external mountainsspeak to the human soul, but also the Beings that live behind them. From thattime onward, the boy lived together with the Spirits of Nature that can bespecially observed in such a region; he lived with the creative beings that arebehind the objects …It seems, then, that like Wordsworth, Steiner was able to sense ‘unknown modesof being’ in the nature around him. He was obviously — like Helena Hahn — anatural medium. But he differed from all the mediums of the late-nineteenthcentury in one important respect: he was possessed of an enormous intellectualcuriosity. A volume on geometry, lent to him by a schoolmaster, filled him withalmost ecstatic delight. And this was because he could ‘work out forms which areseen purely inwardly, independent of the outer senses … To be able to graspsomething purely spiritual brought me an inner joy. I know that through geometryI first experienced happiness.’To speak of geometry as ‘purely spiritual’ pulls us up sharp. Spiritual? Yetthis notion is the very essence of Steiner’s thought, and it gives him animportance that far transcends that of any other ‘spiritualist’ of thenineteenth — or indeed the twentieth — century. What Steiner was learning, fromnature as well as geometry, was to withdraw into himself. The Danish philosopherKierkegaard said: ‘Truth is subjectivity’, meaning that the experience of truth— as distinguished from merely ‘knowing’ that something is true — is a kind ofaccess to inner worlds. As Chesterton points out, if I say ‘The earth is round’,it is true, but I don’t mean it. In order to mean it, I would need to be anastronaut hovering up in space. And the same applies to most of our ‘truths’.But when I relax into a warm bath, and experience a deep sense of pleasure andrelief, I again experience a form of ‘truth’. The astronaut might experiencethis same inner certainty when he looks down for the first time and says: ‘MyGod, the earth is round!’According to Steiner, this sense of ‘inwardness’ is the starting point of‘spiritual life’. What we must learn to do is to anchor ourselves down there,and not allow the world to drag us into a region of doubt and compromise. This,in a sense, is what Shakespeare means by ‘To thine own self be true.’ But it ismore than that. It means learning to listen to inner voices, and learning theirlanguage. Listening to an inner voice is not merely a question of decidingeither to do or not to do something, according to its advice. It is likestudying some ancient wisdom written in an unknown language. It could become thestudy of a lifetime.Now most of us can understand how that ‘retreat into oneself can lead us todeeper appreciation of everything. To appreciate music, you close your eyes, orat least, concentrate wholly and completely on the music. When we are ‘in tune’with nature, it is because we are in that state of ‘inwardness’, and the paradoxis that the more ‘inward’ we are, the more deeply we appreciate what is‘outside’.But Steiner goes a step beyond this. He insists that when we are in this‘inward’ state, we also become aware of the world of the supernatural — both inthe sense of spiritual and in the sense of paranormal. This seems to have beenSteiner’s own experience. He claims that after the vision of his father’s cousinin the station waiting room, he became aware of Spirits of Nature — presumablyhe means the same kind of ‘elementals’ that Rosalind Heywood claims to haveencountered on Dartmoor — and of the spirits of the dead. (We may also recallRosalind Heywood’s comment, describing her telepathic encounter with her deadfriend Vivian: ‘I quickly became aware that I could not hold the absorbed statewhich contact with “Vivian” demanded …’ (my italics), suggesting that contactwith the ‘dead’ demands a certain inner-absorption.)In his Autobiography, Steiner claims two contacts with dead men, neither of whomhe knew. These were not ‘mediumistic’ experiences, but involved some kind ofinner communion. In Vienna in his early twenties, Steiner was introduced to acultured, middle-class family. He says: ‘One could sense the presence in thisfamily of someone unknown to us. It was the father. We [Steiner and otherfriends] never met him, yet one felt his presence.’ The father was an unusualman who avoided social contact and lived like a hermit. From things his familysaid about him, and from the man’s books, Steiner gradually came to feel that heknew him. Finally, the man died, and Steiner was asked to deliver his funeraladdress. He spoke of the father with such apparently intimate knowledge that thefamily told him that it sounded as if he knew him well.It sounds as though Steiner means that he learned to ‘know’ the father throughhints dropped by the family. But later in the Autobiography, it becomes quiteclear that he means far more than this. Ten years later, he had moved to Weimar,to work in the Goethe archive, editing Goethe’s scientific writings. He wasintroduced to a widow named Anna Eunicke, who was later to become his wife.Living in her house as a lodger, he once again became intensely aware of thepersonality of her dead husband. And in the Autobiography he states: ‘The powersof spiritual sight which I then possessed enabled me to enter into a closerelationship with these two souls after their earthly death.’ What Steinerclaims, in effect, is that he was able to ‘follow’ the progress of both dead menin the ‘spirit world’.And now it should begin to be clear why Steiner had so little patience withSpiritualism, and why he declared on one occasion: ‘The Spiritualists are thegreatest materialists of all.’ A medium going into a trance, or using a pencilto trace out the words of a ‘spirit’, knows nothing of the real nature of thedead, of their inner reality. Rosalind Heywood’s description of her encounterwith her friend Vivian Usborne after his death comes altogether closer to it.She says that she ‘ran slap into “Vivian” himself, most joyfully and mostvividly alive’. And ‘Vivian’ ‘conveyed in some fashion so intimate that the bestword seems to be communion’ what he had to tell her. Mrs Willett also spokeabout ‘sensing’ Myers and Gurney in the same direct fashion. This is whatSteiner means by contact with the dead, and he feels that Spiritualism hassubstituted a far more superficial and ‘materialistic’ contact, without theinwardness.According to Steiner, men in the remote past had a direct sense of contact withthe dead. There is, in fact, one interesting piece of archaeological evidencefor this claim. Modern human beings belong to a breed known as Cro-Magnon man,who appeared on earth about fifty thousand years ago, and who is believed tohave exterminated his predecessor, Neanderthal man. Neanderthal man was small,squat and ape-like, and his method of communication was probably confined togrunts. Yet his graves contain mysterious spherical stones, which are probablyimages of the sun, and other ritual objects that suggest that, like the ancientEgyptians, he possessed some kind of belief in life after death. It is hard tobelieve that creatures who were hardly superior to the ape should have evolvedthe idea of an afterlife. But if Steiner — like the modern psychologist StanGooch — is correct in believing that Neanderthal man was far more ‘psychic’ thanmodern man, then his belief in a life after death was not a matter of philosophyso much as of direct experience.And so, says Steiner:if we look back with spiritual vision even but a few centuries to earlier times,we come upon something which must greatly surprise anyone ignorant of thesethings. We find that the intercourse between the living and the dead is becomingincreasingly difficult, and that a comparatively short time ago there was a muchmore active intercourse between them.*According to Steiner, the dead need intercourse with the living to nourish theirbeing. In former times there was a direct link between the living and the dead,so that the living could follow the progress of dead relatives in the‘afterlife’. This clairvoyant faculty was gradually lost, but even then, therewas a kind of semi-conscious feeling of the presence of the dead. Now, he says,this has virtually disappeared. But insofar as men learn to gain ‘access toinner worlds’ through ‘spiritual science’, they will regain the ability tocommunicate with the dead.What happens to man after death is described by Steiner in one of his mostimportant early works, Theosophy (although it is necessary to add immediatelythat even as early as 1904, Steiner’s concept of Theosophy had evolved a longway beyond Madame Blavatsky’s). Like all ‘occultists’, Steiner accepts that manconsists of four ‘bodies’ — physical body, etheric body (or aura), astral bodyand ego. After death, the astral body and ego leave behind the physical body.The etheric body takes about three days to dissolve. During this time, the‘soul’ (astral body plus ego) sees the whole of its past life unfolding inreview. Then it enters a realm called ‘kamaloca’, which corresponds roughly tothe purgatory of Christian doctrine. The past life is relived and examined.Since the astral body is still capable of feeling, it will suffer from itsunsatisfied desires and lusts. When purified by suffering, it can finallydissolve. In kamaloca, the astral body also experiences all the sufferings ithas inflicted upon others from its own point of view.After this, the purified ego rises to the ‘spirit world’, in which it can chooseits own next life. It will choose the form in which it intends to be born, andthe circumstances. (Steiner emphasises that no one should bemoan his lot,because he has chosen it himself.) These are carefully chosen to affordopportunities for evolution (which explains why we do not all choose to befabulously successful). And, in due course, the soul will return to earth tolive another life. One of Steiner’s most fascinating books is an eight-volumework called Karmic Relationships, consisting of lectures delivered not longbefore his death, in which he claims to have used his power of ‘spirit vision’to trace the past incarnations of many famous men. Even for those who regard itas pure fantasy, it offers an interesting vision of Steiner’s sense of the wayreincarnation operates.One eminent member of the Society for Psychical Research, Whately Carington,*produced in 1920 a brilliantly suggestive work called A Theory of The Mechanismof Survival in which he offers the following criticism of Theosophy:In Theosophical literature … we are confronted with a scheme of things built upof such terms as ‘Astral plane’, ‘Etheric Double’, ‘Causal Body’, ‘Karma’ and soforth. With all due deference to my Theosophical friends I submit that this isnot scientific explanation and cannot be so unless its exponents are prepared totell us what is the relation between the astral plane and the physical world,between the etheric double and the body as known to physiologists.It is a valid point, but it applies less to Steiner than to Madame Blavatsky.Moreover, Steiner’s explanations have much in common with the theory Caringtonputs forward in his book. Carington begins from the concept of the fourthdimension, as discussed in the work of mathematicians such as Riemann andLobatchevsky, and goes on to argue that much of the evidence for ‘survival’suggests that the dead exist in a world that has one more dimension than ourshas. (And this receives support from the ‘near-death experience’ of Sir AucklandGeddes, described in Chapter Two, in which Geddes said that he was ‘now free ina time dimension of space, where in “now” was in some way equivalent to “here”in ordinary three dimensional space.’) In a lecture delivered in 1918 under thetitle ‘The Dead Are With Us’, Steiner explains that:in the spiritual sense, what is ‘past’ has not really vanished, but is stillthere. In physical life men have this conception in regard to space only. If youstand in front of a tree, then go away and look back … the tree has notdisappeared … In the spiritual world the same is true in regard to time. If youexperience something at one moment, it has passed away the next as far asphysical consciousness is concerned; spiritually conceived, it has not passedaway. You can look back on it just as you can look back at the tree. RichardWagner showed that he possessed knowledge of this with the remarkable words:‘Time here has become space.’In modern physics, time is regarded as the fourth dimension; what Steiner seemsto be saying is that the ‘spirit world’ has, in effect, yet another dimensionwhich means that time is, in some sense, ‘static’. (A modern investigator, T. C.Lethbridge, came to much the same conclusion on the basis of some curiousexperiments in dowsing, using a pendulum.*)While many people will feel inclined to dismiss Steiner’s account of life afterdeath as completely unverifiable, it cannot be denied that there is animpressive consistency about his views, and that this makes a strong appeal tothe intelligence. He writes:It must … be emphasised that this [spirit] world is woven out of the material ofwhich human thought consists. But thought, as it lives in man, is only a shadowpicture, a phantom of its true being. As the shadow of an object on the wall isrelated to the real object which throws this shadow, so is the thought thatsprings up in man related to the being in spiritland which corresponds to thisthought.This notion that the world of the mind is the spirit world is somehow far moreconvincing — certainly more thought-provoking — than accounts of life afterdeath that make the spirit world sound like a cross between fairyland and aholiday camp.According to Steiner (in the lecture ‘The Dead Are With Us’):We encounter the Dead at the moment of going to sleep, and again at the momentof waking …These moments of waking and going to sleep are of the utmost significance forintercourse with the so-called Dead — and with other spiritual beings of thehigher worlds.The moment of going to sleep is especially favourable for us to turn to theDead. Suppose we want to ask the Dead something. We can carry it in our soul,holding it until the moment of going to sleep, for that is the time to bring ourquestions to the Dead … On the other hand, the moment of waking is the mostfavourable for the Dead to communicate to us.For, says Steiner, there is no one who does not bring with him ‘countlesstidings of the dead’ on waking up. But there is, he explains, one rather oddproblem, When we speak to the dead, the relationship is somehow reversed, andwhen we put a question to the dead, the question comes from him: ‘He inspiresour soul with what we ask him.’ ‘And when he answers us, this comes out of ourown soul.’ ‘In order to establish intercourse with those who have died, we mustadapt ourselves to hear from them what we ourselves say, and to receive from ourown soul what they answer.’It is interesting that in his book on Swedenborg, Dr Wilson van Dusen — whom weencountered in the opening chapter — suggests that Swedenborg’s visions of the‘spirit world’ were obtained in what he calls a ‘controlled hypnogogic state’ —the hypnogogic state being that curious borderland between sleeping and waking.And Thomson Jay Hudson, in The Law of Psychic Phenomena, describes how heattempted to use the miraculous powers of the ‘subjective mind’ to cure arelative who had become a hopeless invalid through rheumatism. His method was toconcentrate on healing his relative — who lived in another city — just as he wason the point of sleep. He began the treatment in the middle of May 1890. A fewmonths later, a friend who knew about the proposed treatment met his relative,and found him so much improved that he was working again. The improvement hadstarted in mid-May. According to Hudson, the subjective mind works best on thepoint of sleep because it is then free of its usual domination by the ‘objectivemind’. We would say, of course, that on the point of sleep the right cerebralhemisphere is freed from its usual domination by the left-brain self.According to Steiner: ‘We should not seek for the Dead through externalities,but become conscious that they are always present.’ And ‘among the practicaltasks of Anthroposophy will be that of gradually building the bridge between theliving and the dead by means of spiritual science’. He is also convinced that ‘avast transformation will take place in human life when the ideas ofreincarnation and karma are no longer theories held by a few people’.We have seen that, in fact, the argument about reincarnation was to split theSpiritualist movement at a very early stage, and that Kardec’s Spiritism — whichtaught reincarnation — was virtually driven underground by the Spiritualistteaching that originated in America. Nowadays, the doctrines of reincarnationare not widely accepted by Spiritualists, although some accept it as apossibility. When I was writing The Occult in the early 1970s, I asked aSpiritualist friend, Professor Wilson Knight, if, next time he attended aseance, he could ask the ‘spirits’ for a straightforward yes or no on thisissue. In due course, he told me that the answer was neither yes nor no.Reincarnation, according to Professor Knight’s ‘communicators’, happensoccasionally, but should not be regarded as a general rule …‘Myers’, in his communications with Geraldine Cummins (published as The Road toImmortality), offers an unusual interpretation of the idea of reincarnation. Hespeaks of the concept of the ‘group soul’, ‘a number of souls all bound togetherby one spirit, depending for their nourishment on that spirit’. He himself, hesays, belonged to such a group soul while on earth. And if we sometimes appearto be paying for the sins of a previous existence, this is because ‘a soulbelonging to the group of which I am a part lived that previous life which builtup for me the framework of my earthly life, lived it before I passed through thegates of birth’.The real Frederick Myers — the author of Human Personality and Its Survival ofBodily Death — was fascinated by one of the most striking cases of reincarnationever collected by the Society for Psychical Research, the case of LurancyVennum, and he cites it at length in his chapter on ‘Disintegrations ofPersonality’.On 11 July 1877, a thirteen-year-old girl, Mary Lurancy Vennum, living inWatseka, Illinois, had a fit and was unconscious for five hours. The next day ithappened again, but then it became clear she was in a trance, for she declaredshe could see heaven and the angels, as well as a brother and sister who haddied. For the next six months, these trances recurred, and Lurancy Vennum wasapparently possessed by a number of disagreeable personalities, including an oldwoman called Katrina Hogan. Relatives advised her parents to send her to aninsane asylum. But neighbours called Roff, whose deceased daughter Mary had alsobeen subject to fits of ‘insanity’, persuaded the Vennums to see a doctor, W. W.Stevens, of Janesville, Wisconsin.When Stevens first saw Mary Lurancy Vennum, on 1 February 1878, the girl was‘possessed’ by ‘Katrina Hogan’, who sat hunched up in a chair staring sullenlyinto space. When Stevens tried to move closer, she told him sharply to keep hisdistance. Then she seemed to soften towards him, and talked about herself andher parents. (She called her father ‘Old Black Dick’.) Soon the personalitychanged; the newcomer described himself as a young man called Willie Canning.But he talked disconnectedly, and then had a fit. Stevens tried hypnosis, and itworked; Lurancy Vennum reappeared, and explained that she had been possessed byevil spirits. She was still in a state of trance, and told them that she wassurrounded by spirits, one of whom was called Mary Roff.Mrs Roff, who was in the room, said: ‘That is my daughter.’ And she advisedLurancy to accept ‘Mary’ as her ‘control’. After some discussion with the‘spirits’, Lurancy announced that she would allow Mary Roff to ‘possess’ her.Soon after, she woke up.The next morning, Mary Lurancy Vennum’s father called at the office of Asa Roff,and told him that Lurancy Vennum was now claiming to be Mary Roff, and that‘Mary’ was asking to go home.Mary’s case history resembled, in many ways, that of Lurancy Vennum — and evenmore that of the Seeress of Prevorst, Friederike Hauffe. Mary had also startedto suffer from fits, and in one of these she cut her arm with a knife —deliberately — and fainted. For the next five days, she was delirious; yet shecould read through a blindfold. After another period of fits, she had died inJuly 1865, twelve years before Mary Lurancy Vennum’s ‘possession’. Herclairvoyant powers had been attested by many prominent citizens in Watseka.Before Lurancy Vennum — or rather ‘Mary’ — could be taken to the Roffs’ home,Mrs Roff and her daughter Minerva came to call at the Vennum’s. ‘Mary’ waslooking out of the window as they came along the street, and said: ‘Why, therecomes ma and my sister Nervie!’ When they came in, she flung her arms roundtheir necks and burst into tears of joy.The Vennums were understandably reluctant to let their daughter go, but ‘Mary’became so homesick they finally agreed. On 11 February 1878, she was taken tothe Roffs’ home. On the way there, they passed the house in which the Roffs hadlived at the time Mary was alive. ‘Mary’ insisted this was her home, and had tobe persuaded that her family no longer lived there. When they arrived at the newhome, ‘Mary’ said: ‘Why, there’s our old piano, and the same old piano cover.’She greeted the crowd of relatives who were waiting there with plain signs ofrecognition. A Mrs Wagner, who (under the name of Mary Lord) had been MaryRoff’s Sunday school teacher, was greeted with the words ‘Oh Mary Lord, you’vechanged the least of anyone.’ She told them that ‘the angels’ would allow her tostay until some time in May — three months ahead.Her family were naturally anxious to test her, and asked her all kinds ofquestions. ‘Mary’ soon convinced them; she was able to describe hundreds ofincidents in the life of the former Mary Roff. She described in detail her stayat a water-cure place in Peoria. Asked if she remembered an incident when thestove pipe fell and burnt Frank, she was able to point out the exact place onthe arm where Frank was burnt. Asked about an old dog, she showed them the spotwhere it had died. When she talked about slashing her arm with the knife, shestarted to roll up her sleeve to show Dr Stevens the scar, then recollected thatthis was not the same body: ‘It’s not this arm — it’s the one in the ground.’After her death, her parents had tried to communicate with her by means of amedium; Mary was able to tell them the message she wrote out for them throughthe medium’s hand, giving the exact time and place.One of the most convincing incidents occurred when Mrs Roff found a old velvethead-dress that Mary had worn during her life time. Mary’s father suggestedleaving it out on the hall stand. ‘Mary’ came in from outside and immediatelysaid: ‘Why, there’s my old head-dress that I wore when my hair was short.’ Thisreminded her of a box of letters, and when her mother brought this, she foundone of her collars. ‘Look, here’s that old collar I tatted.’‘Mary’ told her family that she could stay with them until 21 May. On thatmorning, her mother wrote: ‘Mary is to leave the body of Rancy today, abouteleven o’clock.’ ‘Mary’ went around saying goodbye to neighbours, hugged andkissed her parents, and set out for Lurancy Vennum’s home. On the way, ‘Mary’vanished and Lurancy Vennum returned.Four years later, Mary Lurancy Vennum married a farmer, George Binning. Herparents discouraged her from using her mediumship in case it brought back the‘fits’, but Mary Roff often ‘dropped in’ when her own parents were there, andseemed quite unchanged from her previous visit. When Mary Lurancy Vennum had herfirst baby, ‘Mary’ even put her into a trance so she would not suffer the painsof childbirth.Richard Hodgson, the sceptical young Australian who ‘exposed’ Madame Blavatskyin 1885, and who went to America to investigate Mrs Piper in the following year,heard about the case, and instantly saw that, if genuine, it was a practicallywatertight proof of life after death. He interviewed all the principalcharacters except Lurancy Vennum herself, who had moved west with her husband.In spite of this disappointment, Hodgson ended totally convinced of the truth ofthe incidents as narrated by Dr Stevens and various family members and friends.He agreed that this could be a case of multiple personality, but felt, on thewhole, that all the evidence pointed to a genuine case of ‘possession’ ofLurancy Vennum by the deceased Mary Roff. Myers placed the case in his chapteron multiple personality, but added that ‘at a later stage, and when some otherwonders have become … more familiar … we may perhaps consider once more whatfurther lessons this singular narrative may have to teach us’. He died beforethese ‘further lessons’ could be discussed, but it is clear that he alsoregarded the Vennum case as a proof of the survival of personality after death.If Hodgson and Myers are correct, then it would support the picture that beganto emerge in the opening chapter of this book through the work of Adam Crabtreeand Wilson Van Dusen. We are inclined to think of death either as a dead end, oras a launching into a totally new kind of existence: some strange mystical statein which all the secrets of the universe will be known. All the evidence we haveconsidered indicates that this is a misconception. Life on the ‘next plane’ isapparently not fundamentally dissimilar from life on earth, although many of itsconditions seem to be different. According to various ‘communicators’, there areother planes that are inconceivable to us, but under the circumstances, theseare no concern of ours. But unless the evidence of psychical research is anenormous confidence trick, devised by the collective unconscious to satisfy ourcraving for ‘survival’, the individual survives death in a form not unlike hispresent mode of being.There are many ways in which the evidence of reincarnation is more convincingthan the evidence of life after death that comes through mediums. The CrossCorrespondences finally convinced the investigators that Myers and Gurney hadsurvived their deaths; but Mary Roffs’ parents must have been quite certain shewas still alive within hours of her moving back into their house.Another of the early classic cases — unfortunately never investigated by atrained researcher like Hodgson — has become known as the Alexandrina case.On 15 March 1910, a five-year-old girl named Alexandrina Samona died in Palermo,Sicily. Her mother, Adela — wife of Dr Carmelo Samona — was distraught withgrief. But three days after the death, she had a dream in which Alexandrina toldher not to mourn, because she was going to return. She showed her mother anembryo. Adela Samona dismissed the dream, knowing that an ovarian operation hadmade it almost impossible for her to have children.A few days later, when Adela was sadly recalling the child to her husband, threeloud knocks were heard. The parents began to attend seances, and two ‘spirits’spoke through the medium — one claiming to be the child, the other an aunt whohad died long ago. ‘Alexandrina’ told her mother that she would be reborn beforeChristmas, as one of two twins. In fact, twin girls were born to Adela Samona on22 November 1910, just over nine months after Alexandrina’s death. The two girlswere of totally different personalities, but one of them had two small birthmarks in the same place as the dead child; she was also, like Alexandrina,left-handed. The parents named her after the dead child. In personality, thissecond Alexandrina was very like the first: introverted, tidy, disposed to spendmuch of her time folding clothes and linen.What finally convinced the parents that the child was a reincarnation of thedead Alexandrina was an incident that happened when the twins were ten. Theywere told that they were going on an outing to the town of Monreale — neither ofthem had been there. But Alexandrina insisted that she had been there with hermother, in the company of a ‘lady with horns’. She also described the statue onthe roof of the church, and described some ‘red priests’ they had seen there. Infact, Adela Samona had taken her first daughter Alexandrina to Monreale not longbefore her death, in the company of a woman who had some unsightly cysts on herforehead. They had been to the church and seen some priests from Greece, whowore red robes. Dr Samona was so struck by this evidence of reincarnation thathe went to some trouble to put the case on record, together with the depositionsof various witnesses, and published it in the periodical Filosofia dellaScienza.From the point of view of the investigator, the problem here is that themother’s wishful thinking may have been responsible for the whole episode. Thedeath of Alexandrina produced suicidal depression; her unconscious may havereacted by sending her a dream in which the child promised to return. By thetime she had this dream, she may have already conceived the twins, and herunconscious mind may also have known this. So the second Alexandrina had theidentity of her dead sister foisted on her. Perhaps her mother described thetrip to Monreale to her, then forgot it. Or perhaps she overheard her motherspeaking about it to her father …This, of course, is always the problem with a case that took place long beforeanyone thought of subjecting it to scientific investigation. But this objectiondoes not apply to a very similar recent case that took place in England. It isdiscussed by Ian Wilson in a book called Mind Out of Time?, which takes asceptical view of reincarnation, dismissing most cases as a matter of‘cryptomnesia’ — unconscious memory.In May 1957, two sisters, Joanna and Jacqueline Pollock, aged eleven and six,were walking along a road in Hexham, Northumberland, when a car mounted thepavement and killed them both; a nine-year-old boy was also killed. The driverwas a woman who had taken an overdose of drugs and gone out with the intentionof committing suicide. Their father, John Pollock, was a Catholic, but he alsobelieved in reincarnation — a belief condemned by the Church; he felt that thedeath of the girls was a judgement on him for his interest in these unorthodoxmatters. In spite of this, he became obsessed by the idea that the girls weregoing to be reborn to his wife. And when, a year later, his wife Florenceannounced she was pregnant, he told her unhesitatingly that she would have twindaughters, and this was God’s way of returning Joanna and Jacqueline. When agynaecologist told her that she was definitely pregnant with only one child, shedecided that her husband’s obsession was getting the better of him. But in fact,twin daughters were born on 4 October 1958. And Jennifer, the twin who was bornsecond, had a thin white line across her forehead exactly where her dead sisterJacqueline had a scar — the result of falling off her bicycle. She also had abirthmark on her left hip, identical to one that Jacqueline had had in the sameplace. There was no similar mark on the ‘elder’ sister, Gillian — which seemedodd, since the twins were monozygotic (formed from the same egg).When the twins were four months old, the family moved to Whitley Bay. One daythree years later, John Pollock took them on a day trip to Hexham. And theybehaved as if they were quite familiar with the place. One suddenly said to theother: ‘The school’s round the corner.’ ‘That’s were we used to play in theplayground.’ ‘The swings and slides are over there.’ ‘We used to live in thathouse.’ This last comment was made as they passed their old house.The toys of the dead sisters had been packed in a box which was stored in theloft; when the twins were four, the parents decided to let them play with these.Jennifer said immediately: There’s Mary. And this is my Suzanne’ — correctlynaming the two dolls. ‘And there’s your wringer.’ Florence Pollock, whowitnessed this scene, can hardly be accused of wishful thinking, for (as a goodCatholic) she thoroughly disapproved of her husband’s obsession withreincarnation. She refused to let him say anything about it to the children, oreven to tell them anything about their dead sisters other than that they were‘in heaven’.When she heard the twins screaming one day, Florence Pollock rushed outside tofind them clinging to one another and shouting ‘The car! It’s coming at us.’ Acar had just started up further along the lane. On another occasion, she foundthem playing a curious game in which Gillian cradled Jennifer’s head, saying:‘The blood’s coming out of your eyes. That’s where the car hit you.’ FlorencePollock became increasingly disturbed by these incidents, and she was relievedwhen, at about the age of five, the twins seemed to lose all memory of theirdead sisters, and became perfectly normal children.Ian Wilson points out that the father’s belief in reincarnation weakens much ofthe evidence. Yet it is still impossible to see how John Pollock can have fakedthis evidence, unless he secretly coached the children in their roles when theirmother was not present. And the twins themselves have denied that anything ofthe sort took place. Wilson himself admits that the case of the Pollock twins isone of the few in his book where prima facie evidence seems to support the ideaof reincarnation.One of the most widely publicised modern cases of alleged reincarnation tookplace in India in the early 1930s, and was later studied by Professor HemendraBannerjee, director of the Department of Parapsychology at Rajasthan University(who, together with Professor Ian Stevenson, is the world’s leading scientificinvestigator of such cases). On 12 October 1926, a girl called Kumari ShantiDevi was born in Delhi, India, and when she was four years old, she began totalk about a previous life she had lived in the town of Muttra, a hundred milesfrom Delhi. She said she had been of the Choban caste, had lived in a yellowhouse, and that her husband had been a cloth merchant named Kedar Nath Chaubey.A retired school principal heard about the girl, and asked to meet her. Thechild told him the address she had lived at in Muttra, and the principal wrote aletter there. To his surprise, he received a letter back from Shanti Devi’s‘husband’ Kedar Nath. He confirmed various details about his life with hisformer wife, and requested that a relative of his in Delhi should be allowed totalk to the child. When the man arrived, Shanti Devi recognised him as her‘husband’ ’s cousin, Kanji Mal, and soon had him convinced of her genuineness.When he reported back to Kedar Nath, Shanti Devi’s ‘husband’ no longerhesitated. He rushed to Delhi, and the child flung herself into his arms. Shewas able to give convincing answers to all his questions about her previousexistence as his wife, and mentioned a box containing a hundred rupees that shehad buried in one of the rooms of their house.On 24 November 1935, the nine-year-old girl was finally taken to Muttra by herparents; they were accompanied by three respectable citizens — a newspaperman, apolitician and a lawyer — who went along to act as witnesses (and who laterwrote an account of the case). As the train approached the platform in Muttra,Shanti Devi recognised the elder brother of Kedar Nath, who was waiting there.They then took a carriage, and Shanti Devi was told to direct it anywhere shewanted. As they drove along, she pointed out buildings that had not been thereduring her own life in Muttra. She directed them to the first house in which sheand her husband had formerly lived — now rented to strangers. Asked by a localman where the ‘jai-zarur’ was situated — a word used in Muttra for a privy — shepointed to the outdoor lavatory. Then they went on to the house in which she haddied. There she recognised various relatives, and showed that she was intimatelyacquainted with the house. Finally, she led them to the room in which she hadburied the money. Digging uncovered an empty tin. Kedar Nath later admitted hehad removed the money. As they left the house, Shanti Devi recognised in thecrowd outside her ‘former’ father and mother …No such case can, of course, be regarded as watertight, simply because theauthors of the pamphlet failed to take the same precautions that had becomecommonplace in all Society for Psychical Research investigations — depositionsof witnesses, double-checking on the possibilities of cryptomnesia, and so on.But three decades later, another investigator applied these precautions to hisown investigations of cases of alleged reincarnation. And the striking thingabout so many of Ian Stevenson’s Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation,* andthe subsequent three volumes of Cases of the Reincarnation Type, * is how muchso many of them echo the case of Shanti Devi. Swarnlata, the daughter of a civilservant, was born in 1948, began to tell her brothers and sisters about a‘previous life’ in the city of Katni, where she had been called Biya, and hadbeen married to a man called Sri Chintamini Pandey. At the age of three and ahalf, her father took her with him on a school inspection trip, and as theypassed through Katni — about a hundred miles from their home — she asked thedriver to turn down a road to ‘my house’. Her father now learned that she hadbeen telling her family about her ‘previous life’ for some time. She performedfor her parents songs and dances that she claimed she had learned in herprevious life, and which she had certainly had no opportunity to learn in thepresent one. When she was ten, her family moved to Chhatarpur, and she there meta lady named Srimati Agnihotri, whom she claimed to recognise as someone she hadknown in her previous life. Her father was impressed when this lady confirmedmany of his daughter’s statements about Katni and her life there — for the firsttime he began to take her claims seriously. He began writing down herstatements. Professor Hemendra Bannerjee went to meet Swarnlata in 1959, thenwent straight on to Katni to see how her statements compared with those of her‘previous’ family in Katni. He had made a list of nine points about the familyhouse; all proved to be accurate; so did Swarnlata’s descriptions of her life asBiya, the deceased wife. Soon after this, Swarnlata and her family went toKatni; what followed was very similar to what had happened to Shanti Devi. OnProfessor Bannerjee’s instructions, Swarnlata’s family not only took care tooffer her no clues, but even tried to mislead her on various points — such astelling her that the family cowherd was dead, and then bringing him into herpresence; she immediately recognised him. Stevenson’s table of all the places,people and events described by Swarnlata goes on for eight pages, and makesimpressive reading. The result of all this was that the Katni family acceptedSwarnlata as the dead Biya, and she spent much time with them and built up closeties with her previous ‘brothers’ and ‘children’. Stevenson himself investigatedthis case in 1961, with the advantage of all the documentation already made byProfessor Bannerjee. So as a proof of reincarnation, the Swarnlata case seems tobe as ‘watertight’ as it could be.Another of Stevenson’s cases recalls Lurancy Vennum and Mary Roff. In 1954, athree-year-old boy named Jasbir Lal Jat died of smallpox. Before he could beburied the next day, the corpse stirred and revived. It was some weeks beforethe child could speak, but when he did, his parents were astonished that hispersonality had changed completely. Jasbir had been a rather dull, quiet littleboy; he had suddenly become more lively. He announced that he was the son of aBrahmin family (a higher caste than his present family) who lived in the villageof Vehedi, and he refused to eat food unless it was cooked by a Brahmin. He saidhe had been poisoned by doctored sweets, and had fallen off a cart and smashedhis skull, as a result of which he died. Jasbir’s family were understandablysceptical, assuming that his illness had affected his mind. But they began toreconsider in 1957, when a Brahmin lady from Vehedi came to Jasbir’s village,and he instantly recognised her as his aunt. Jasbir was taken back to Vehedi,and, like Shanti Devi and Swarnlata, he showed a detailed knowledge of hisformer residence, escorting a party on a tour. His name in the previousexistence had been Sobha Ram, and his detailed knowledge of his life convincedeveryone that Jasbir and Sobha Ram were the same person. The accusation aboutthe poisoned sweets was never satisfactorily cleared up — Sobha Ram was said tohave died of smallpox.The most fascinating point about this case, of course, is that Jasbir wasalready three when he ‘died’ and was ‘taken over’ by Sobha Ram, who died at thesame time. The implication is that Sobha Ram was able to slip into the bodybefore brain death had occurred and fight his way back to life.Without the kind of detailed investigation undertaken by Stevenson andBannerjee, no case of reincarnation can be regarded as proven; a case that lookssuperficially convincing may collapse the moment it is probed. In fact, there isevidence that Stevenson himself was deceived in such a case. Edward Ryall, wholived in Benfleet, Essex, was to claim that he was haunted by memories of a‘previous existence’ ever since childhood; in these memories, he was a Somersetfarmer named John Fletcher, who had been killed in 1685, when he was guiding thetroops of the Duke of Monmouth to attack the royalist forces at Sedgemoor.Slowly, these memories had become more and more detailed until he could rememberlarge sections of his ‘earlier life’. During the invasion of Italy in 1945,Ryall claimed to have heard a woman’s voice in his ear telling him to take care;studying the ground ahead he saw he was about to walk into a booby trap.In 1970, Ryall wrote a letter to the Daily Express about these experiences, andit aroused widespread interest. Ian Stevenson met Ryall, and decided he wasgenuine. It was Stevenson who persuaded Ryall to write a book about his‘previous existence’, and Second Time Round appeared in 1974, two years beforeRyall’s death. The woman who had warned Ryall not to walk into the trip wirewas, according to this book, John Fletcher’s wife in Weston Zoyland.In a BBC programme soon after publication, Ryall accompanied the interviewer tothe church in which he claimed to have been married, and to various other sitesin the life of John Fletcher, and the interviewer admitted to being totallyconvinced by Ryall’s story, and by his obvious involvement in his pastincarnation.But the parish records of the church were still in existence, and when IanWilson consulted these, he found no evidence whatsoever for the existence ofJohn Fletcher or his family. Ryall claimed that Fletcher’s father had beenkilled by a bull in 1660, and was buried by the Rev. Thomas Holt, the vicar ofWeston Zoyland; Thomas Holt was the vicar, but there was no record of the burialof Fletcher’s father. There is no record of Fletcher’s marriage, or of thebaptisms of his two sons, although he claimed they were baptised by a subsequentvicar, who kept a meticulous record of all baptisms (which is still in theCounty Records Office). Finally, Ryall showed himself to be extremely cautiousand unhelpful in his correspondence with a local historian who wanted to helphim trace John Fletcher’s farm — although Ryall had claimed to know preciselywhere it was situated. Under Ian Wilson’s analysis, a highly convincing storybegins to look like a historical fantasy.Wilson’s own explanation of most of these strange cases is basically the same asthat of Thomson Jay Hudson in The Law of Psychic Phenomena : the extraordinarypowers of the ‘subjective mind’. Hudson cites a particularly fascinating casefrom Coleridge’s Biographia Literaria about an illiterate peasant girl who fellinto ‘a nervous fever’ and began talking in Latin, Greek and Hebrew, It lookedlike some kind of ‘possession’, but a persistent young doctor managed to tracethe girl’s surviving uncle, and learned that her parents had died when she was achild, and that she had been taken into the house of an old pastor. Moreresearch revealed that the old man had a habit of walking up and down a passagereading aloud from books in Greek, Hebrew and Latin. Consciously, the girl couldnot remember a word of these languages; but her ‘subjective mind’ had recordedthem, and they emerged when she was in a nervous fever.In 1933, a neurologist named Wilder Penfield, who was engaged on work withepileptic patients, was performing an operation on a female patient’s brain whenhis electric probe touched a point in the temporal cortex. The patient (who waswide awake — the brain has no feelings, so anaesthetic is unnecessary) toldPenfield that as he touched her, she was suddenly in the kitchen listening toher little boy, who was playing outside in the yard. She was competely ‘there’ —aware, for example, of the sounds of passing cars. Another patient on whom heperformed the experiment found himself at a baseball game in a small townwatching a boy crawl under the fence; another was in a concert hall, hearingevery instrument of the orchestra clearly. Other patients ‘played back’ scenesfrom childhood in the most minute detail. It was as if Penfield had accidentallyswitched on some kind of video-recorder that had literally captured every waking(and probably sleeping) moment of the patient’s life.* The conclusion wasobvious. We all possess a library that contains everything that we have done orthought. Then why is it not accessible to us? Because we are too ‘busy’. Life isdifficult and complicated; we do not have the time to browse in the library. So,like those calculating prodigies who lost the ability at the age of fourteen, wehave simply abandoned this capability as an evolutionary luxury. Yet Pen-field’sexperiments show that we could recover it if we really wanted to. It is not evennecessary to use an electric probe. Psychiatrists who have developed a techniqueknown as ‘abreaction therapy’ have discovered that ordinary suggestion can makea patient re-live a traumatic experience in total physical detail; there is noreason why the same techniques should not be used to make us re-live some of ourmost delightful experiences.But Penfield’s discovery certainly provides grounds for scepticism about caseslike that of Edward Ryall. Ian Wilson justifies his own scepticism by describinga remarkable case investigated by the Society for Psychical Research in 1906.Under hypnosis, a woman (called Miss C) began to ‘recall’ details from the lifeof a woman called Blanche Poynings, who had lived in the time of Richard II, andbeen a close friend of Maud, the Countess of Salisbury; her knowledge of thecountess’s life certainly seemed remarkably accurate. As far as she knew, Miss Chad never read any historical novel that might have provided such detail. Oneday, when the SPR investigator was having tea with Miss C, they began talkingabout the planchette, an automatic-writing device, and Miss C agreed to try tocommunicate with Blanche Poynings with a planchette. ‘Blanche’ and Miss C weresoon holding an animated conversation, with ‘Blanche’ reproaching her for notcommunicating for so long. But when they asked her how they could check on herstory, she replied: ‘Ask E. Holt.’ E. Holt turned out to be Emily Holt, authorof a novel called Countess Maud. Miss C had read it as a child, and long agoforgotten it. But Countess Maud proved to contain every detail about theCountess of Salisbury that Miss C had given under hypnosis.That certainly sounds like game, set and match to the sceptics aboutreincarnation. But a case of the 1950s illustrates the dangers of being carriedaway by the passion for incredulity. Morey Bernstein, a businessman of Pueblo,Colorado, discovered he was naturally proficient in hypnosis, and persuaded thewife of an insurance salesman, Virginia Tighe, to allow him to try hypnoticregression on her. Virginia proved to be a deep hypnotic subject, and whenBernstein regressed her beyond her birth, she began to speak with an Irishbrogue, and identified herself as Bridey Murphy, who had been born near Cork,Ireland, in 1798. In six tape-recorded sessions, she gave a detailed account ofher life as Bridey, the wife of a barrister who taught at Queen’s University,Belfast. Bridey had died after a fall in 1864.Bernstein wrote a book about the case, The Search for Bridey Murphy, which wasserialised in the Chicago Daily News, to the chagrin of its Hearst rival, theChicago American. A Chicago Daily News reporter went to Belfast to try to trackdown Bridey Murphy, but found himself hampered by the fact that records ofbirths and deaths began in Ireland two years after Bridey’s death. But he founda number of other, confirmatory factors. Two Belfast grocers mentioned by MrsTighe were found listed in the Belfast Directory for 1865. A two-pence coinmentioned by Bridey as being in use during her lifetime had been minted shortlybefore her birth, and ceased to be used twelve years before her death. Brideyhad said that she was born in The Meadows’, near Belfast, and a map of Belfastdated 1801 showed an area called Mardike Meadows. Other details given by Bridey— such as a Dooley Road, Belfast, and a St Theresa’s Church — failed to check.This did not deter the enthusiasm of the American public, and The Search forBridey Murphy became the major bestseller of 1956.And at this point, the rival newspaper printed the results of its owninvestigations. It had uncovered Virginia Tighe’s identity (Bernstein had used apseudonym) and discovered that she had lived in Chicago. According to theChicago American, Mrs Tighe had an aunt who was ‘as Irish as the lakes ofKillarney’, and who had told her tales about Ireland in her childhood; she wascalled Mary Burns. Moreover, during her childhood Virginia had lived opposite anIrishwoman named Bridey Corkell, whose unmarried name was Murphy; her Irishbackground, according to the Chicago American, had fascinated the little girl.And Virginia had had a ‘crush’ on Mrs Corkell’s son John …The Bridey Murphy furore collapsed as suddenly as it had begun, and the bookdropped from bestseller lists. But a Denver feature writer who investigated this‘exposé’ discovered that most of it was simply untrue. Mrs Mary Burns — the auntwho was ‘as Irish as the lakes of Killarney’ — had been born in New York, andhad not met Virginia until the girl was eighteen; both she and Virginiaemphatically denied that there had been any Irish stories. Mrs Corkell proved tobe strangely elusive, declining to be interviewed, so the reporter was unable tofind out whether her unmarried name was Murphy. What he did discover was thather son John — on whom Virginia was supposed to have had a crush — was theeditor of the Sunday edition of the Chicago American, the newspaper that hadfailed to secure serial rights on Bernstein’s book. Virginia insisted that shehad never even spoken to Mrs Corkell, and had no interest in her son John, whowas eight years her senior and married.All this fails to prove that Virginia Tighe’s Bridey incarnation was any morereal than Miss C’s Blanche Poynings. But it does prove that it is easier todemolish a claim than to subject it to serious investigation. Most writers onthe case (for example, Martin Gardner in Fads and Fallacies in the Name ofScience) are content to quote the exposé without mentioning the Denver Post’sexposé of the exposé. The ‘passion for incredulity’ can produce as muchself-deception as the uncritical will to believe.The Bridey Murphy case had the effect of interesting other hypnotists in thesubject of ‘regression’. An English doctor, Arnall Bloxham, who lived nearCardiff, regressed a girl named Ann Ockendon, who recalled her life as a man ina land where people went naked and wore animals’ teeth — Bloxham concluded shewas speaking of prehistoric times. But obviously, there was no way of checkingon this particular incarnation. Later cases proved more fruitful. And atelevision producer, Jeffrey Iverson, became so fascinated by a programme hemade on Bloxham that he set out to investigate some of the cases, and publishedhis results in a book called More Lives Than One? A swimming instructor namedGraham Huxtable had ‘become’ an eighteenth-century sailor on a ship called HMSAggie; he enacted a battle scene with a French ship with total conviction, andfinally screamed horribly as he was wounded in the leg. Earl Mountbattencommissioned a modern historian, Oliver Warner, to try to investigate the taperecording made by Huxtable, and although he did not succeed in tracing the shipor the battle, Warner ended by being totally convinced of its authenticity —Huxtable’s sailor seemed to know far more about the ships of the period thancould be picked up from historical novels.But Iverson’s most convincing case is of a woman who prefers to be known as JaneEvans, and who recalled seven past lives; a Roman housewife living in Britain, aJewess murdered in a pogrom in York, a French courtesan, a maidservant to aFrench merchant, a sewing girl in the time of Queen Anne, a lady-in-waiting tothe Spanish Infanta, and an American nun from Des Moines, Iowa. The Roman wife,Livonia, showed a remarkable knowledge of the period, suggesting an expert onBritish and Roman history. ‘Mrs Evans’ insisted that her only knowledge ofhistory came from the usual elementary course at school. Iverson went to theLoire valley to investigate her incarnation as Alison, maidservant of JacquesCoeur, adviser to King Charles VII of France. ‘Jane Evans’ had never been to theLoire valley and knew nothing about French history; but Iverson’s investigationsamong French historians showed him just how much Alison knew about mediaevalFrance.But the most impressive ‘incarnation’ was as a Jewess, Rebecca, intwelfth-century York. Shortly before Richard the Lion Heart rode off to theThird Crusade, in 1189, there were anti-Jewish riots in London; the English hadworked themselves up into a frenzy about ‘infidels’, and the Jews seemed toqualify as much as the Muslims. In 1190, there were riots in York; Jews tookrefuge in the castle, and most of them killed their families, then themselves,to avoid the vengeance of the mob. Rebecca and her family escaped the massacre,and took refuge in the crypt of a Christian church, ‘just outside the biggates’. But the mob found them and killed them.Iverson decided to consult an expert on the massacre, Professor Barrie Dobson,of the University of York. Dobson was impressed by her reconstruction of themassacre — particularly since ‘Jane Evans’ professed to be totally ignorant ofany such thing. He decided that the church that answered her description was StMary’s, Castlegate. There was only one problem — this had no crypt. But sixmonths later, workmen renovating the church discovered the remains of ‘somethingthat seems to have been a crypt’ — a room with round stone arches and vaults,under the chancel.Ian Wilson, while admitting that this ‘regression’ is impressive, has a numberof criticisms. There were, he points out, forty churches in York; how canProfessor Dobson be sure that St Mary’s is the right one? Rebecca described themurder of an old Jew in ‘Coney Street’. But in twelfth-century York, ConeyStreet was still called Cuninga (King) Street. Rebecca refers to the ‘big coppergate of York’, when, in fact, the Coppergate was a street. These objections losemuch of their force when we discover that Professor Dobson had already raisedthem — and answered them. The street where the old Jew was murdered may havebeen Cuninga Street, but it is probable that it was actually pronounced ConeyStreet. The English have a habit of changing foreign pronunciations. (In my hometown, Leicester, Belvoir Street is pronounced Beaver Street.) The street calledCoppergate existed in York in 1190, and at the end of it was one of the gatesleading to the castle. No doubt most of the residents of York believed that‘Coppergate’ referred to this gate.All this also answers the third objection: how Professor Dobson could identifythe church when there were thirty-nine others; Rebecca describes it specificallyas being ‘just outside the big gates’. This makes sense, since she says they hadjust escaped from the castle …Ian Wilson’s criticisms make it clear that the case against reincarnation isfundamentally the same as the case against ‘spirit communication’ via mediums.Anything that can be explained in terms of cryptomnesia, telepathy or possiblefraud must be regarded as unproven. If we are to prove spirit communication,then we have to demonstrate that the ‘spirit’ has communicated something thatcould not have been known to the medium or to anyone else present. A number ofcases — such as the Cross Correspondences — have satisfied this criterion. If weare to ‘prove’ reincarnation, the same thing applies. It has to be demonstratedthat the ‘reincarnated’ person knows things that could only have been learned ina ‘previous existence’. So in the case of Graham Huxtable, it makes nodifference that a naval historian finds his account wholly convincing. We needto know beyond all possible doubt that Huxtable never saw a film or read a bookthat might have provided the material for the battle scene.But in the case of ‘Jane Evans’, it is almost impossible to see how this type ofexplanation could apply. If it is true that she is no great reader, and that heronly knowledge of history comes from elementary school, then there is apparentlyno way in which she would have learned about the life of a Roman matron inColchester or a Jewess in York. At the same time, her ‘incarnations’ lack oneimportant element: proof that Livonia and Rebecca and the rest actually existed.Without such proof, we can never be quite certain that they were not anotheramazing creation of the ‘subjective mind’.Another English hypnotist, Joe Keeton, who lives in the Wirral, has alsospecialised in regressions, and has formed a group whose aim is to try to finddocumentary evidence for ‘past lives’. Ironically, Keeton himself does notbelieve that he is dealing with cases of reincarnation. He prefers to believethat he may be dealing with some purely mental faculty, with some unknown formof access to the memory of the human race, something similar to Jung’s‘collective unconscious’.I met Joe Keeton for the first time in 1978, when he came to Westward Televisionin Plymouth. He had been ‘regressing’ a pretty nurse named Pauline McKay, whoalso came from the Wirral, and Pauline had ‘become’ a West Country servant girlcalled Kitty Jay, who said she had committed suicide near Chagford in thelate-eighteenth century. Joe had written to the head librarian in Exeter to askwhether he knew of a Kitty Jay, and was surprised to learn that ‘Jay’s Grave’lies on the edge of Dartmoor, and that she had hanged herself in Canna Farm. Asa suicide, she had not been allowed burial in a graveyard.In the television studio, Keeton hypnotised Pauline McKay, then took her back toher own past life, then finally to her life as Kitty Jay. ‘Kitty’ described howshe had gone to work at Ford Farm, Manaton, as a maid, and had allowed herselfto be seduced by a man named Rob, who worked at nearby Canna Farm. AlthoughPauline had never been to the West Country, she seemed to know the area, andcorrectly named a bridge where she and Rob stood on their walks. She told of howRob had deserted her, then described her suicide — at this point she becameobviously distressed, and gasped for breath. It was an impressive performance.Yet it was obviously open to the interpretation of cryptomnesia. Pauline mayhave read the story of Kitty Jay in some volume on ghosts, such as PeterUnderwood’s Gazetteer of British Ghosts.Since that meeting in 1978, Joe Keeton has kept me abreast of his latest cases,and some of these have been very impressive. Yet until 1983, none of them couldbe regarded as watertight cases of reincarnation — or racial memory. And then,finally, two of his investigators — Andrew and Marguerite Selby — were able toproduce documentary evidence for the existence of a ‘past incarnation’.The subject of the regression was a journalist, Ray Bryant, who works as afeatures writer for the Reading Evening Post. In 1980, he was asked to write aseries on hypnotic regression. As a result of this series, he became interestedin the subject, but found his own attempts at regression disappointing. However,he had become a member of a group, which met in London, and so he persevered.And during the twelfth hypnotic session, he heard himself describing an occasionwhen ‘he’ had fallen ill on a railway station. (Ray Bryant describes hissensations during these sessions as being like watching a television programmeand simultaneously taking part in it.) It slowly emerged that ‘he’ was a farmlabourer named Robert Sawyer, who had lived at Ongar, Essex, at the turn of thetwentieth century. (Ray was born in 1938.) And for the next three sessions hedescribed his life as a farm worker, questioned by all the other members of thegroup. Then Joe Keeton decided it was time to go further back. Ray Bryant wastaken beyond Robert Sawyer’s birth. This time he became a soldier called Reuben.When asked his second name, he could only get out the first letters: ‘St …’ Butit was clear that Reuben’s life had been rather more eventful than that ofRobert Sawyer. He had been a sergeant in the 47th Lancashire Regiment of Foot,had been wounded in the Crimean war — where he saw Florence Nightingale — andeventually died in London — probably a suicide — in 1879, at the age offifty-seven.Other details emerged. He had been wounded at the ‘Battle of the Quarries’ — ofwhich no one in the group had heard. But a check with a reference book showedthat this had actually taken place, in June 1855. (Even so, it is one of themore obscure battles of the war, which took place during the siege of Sevastopol— my own search through half a dozen books in my library has failed to find areference to it.) He had left the army after twenty-one years’ service, in 1865,and had returned for a time to live in his home town, Ormskirk, Lancashire. Hiswife Mary — whom he had married when he was a corporal — had died, and hedecided to follow his son — also called Reuben — to London. There he had workedas a boatman at Millwall Docks, but had been lonely and unhappy. His army careerhad been exceptionally happy; he loved being a soldier. Ending his life in astrange city, living alone in lodgings, depressed him — Ray Bryant said that thechange that came over his personality when he changed from soldier to Thamesboatman was pathetic. And he had died in 1865.The chances of learning anything about an ex-sergeant in the Crimean war seemedremote, but Andrew and Marguerite Selby, who lived in South Harrow, offered toundertake the task. Andrew Selby is a civil engineer who became interested inregression when he heard Joe Keeton broadcasting on LBC, asking for subjects whowould agree to be hypnotised. But where did one begin? A good starting pointseemed to be the Guildhall Library, in the City of London, and there they had anunbelievable stroke of luck. There was a book containing the casualty roll ofthe Crimean war, and looking under ‘St’ — the only letters of the surname Reubenhad been able to pronounce — they found a Sergeant Reuben Stafford who had beenwounded in the hand at the Battle of the Quarries. He had won medals, and hadbeen promoted; the record gave the dates. Now they had the means to find outwhether Reuben St … was Sergeant Reuben Stafford (later colour-sergeant). Atthis next regression, they asked Ray Bryant to go back to these dates and askedhim what had happened. He was right every time.This was not the end of the research. The Selbys checked the Public RecordOffice in Kew and the General Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages in whatused to be Somerset House (now St Catherine’s House). They found Reuben’s deathcertificate that showed that he died by drowning, and gave an address inGravesend. Reuben had been very poor when he died, and they discovered that hisgrave was a ‘communal’ one in the cemetery at East Ham. Ray Bryant has recordedhow deeply moved he felt as he stood on the spot where the records showedReuben’s grave had been. Reuben’s bones had vanished long ago — in thesecommunal burial plots, room was made for someone else after twenty years or so.In a case like this, the cryptomnesia theory is no longer tenable. Reuben‘checked out’ both ways: the dates he gave proved to be accurate; the dates inthe records produced the correct response from Reuben. It could be argued thatRay Bryant, under hypnosis, read the minds of his questioners and gave them theanswers they knew to be correct; but that fails to explain Ray Bryant’s accurateknowledge about a Reuben St … who was wounded in the hand at the Battle of theQuarries before Sevastopol. (When Reuben was regressed to dates after thiswound, be held his paralysed hand in a stiff and awkward manner; as soon as hewas regressed further back, the paralysis disappeared.) There seems to be no wayof explaining this case except to accept that Ray Bryant was Sergeant ReubenStafford of Ormskirk in a previous existence, or that he was in some way intouch with the mind of Reuben Stafford. Andrew Selby is inclined to the‘collective unconscious’ hypothesis; Ray Bryant, on the whole, prefers thesimpler explanation of reincarnation.If he is correct, the implications are interesting. To begin with, we must alsoassume that after dying in the Thames in 1865, Reuben was reincarnated as a farmlabourer named Robert Sawyer a few years later, and that he died before RayBryant was born in 1938. And if we can accept that Robert Sawyer and ReubenStafford were real people, then it seems highly likely that four other earlier‘incarnations’ who have appeared under hypnosis are also real: Wilfred Anderton,a coachman of the eighteenth century, a girl called Winifred, who died quiteyoung, a housemaid named Elizabeth who rose to become a governess in thelate-seventeenth century, and an unnamed character who does not appear tounderstand English, and who lived about a century earlier.This also raises in a new form the basic question of what, if anything, survivesdeath. Clearly, not sexual differentiation, since Ray Bryant was both male andfemale in past incarnations. Then what is the basic ‘substratum’ of personalitythat was common to all seven people? When I fired this question at him, RayBryant admitted that he had no idea. But he felt that all the previous sixincarnations had contributed something to what he is now. In Preston, where the47th had its barracks (and where Ray Bryant was able to examine the regimentalrecords), he had a strong feeling of déjà-vu. His knowledge of Reuben seemed tohim to explain his recurrent nightmare of falling out of a boat, and the senseof peace he has always experienced in or beside water — whether river, sea,stream or pond. It seems, then, that something can be carried over from one‘lifetime’ to another — and this, of course, seems to strengthen the possibilitythat something of the personality survives death. But it also implies that whatsurvives death — ‘Myers’, ‘Gurney’, and so on — is not in itself permanent, butthat it will in turn evolve to something else. This seems, in fact, to be one ofthe most consistent factors in all ‘spirit teachings’, from Kardec and StaintonMoses to Geraldine Cummins.Among Hindus and Buddhists, reincarnation is an article of religious faith. Theancient Celts believed in it; so did the Greeks. Various fathers of the Church —like St Jerome and Origen — regarded the doctrine with sympathy. But it wascondemned outright by the Second Council of Constantinople — convened by theEmperor Justinian — and from then on became a Christian heresy. In a pamphlet onreincarnation published by the Catholic Truth Society, Father J. H. Crehan, SJ,sums up: ‘… for a Catholic, it should be clear that our faith has no room fortheories of reincarnation’. (It may or may not be significant that Ian Wilson isa Catholic convert.)But it would probably be fair to say that the main reason reincarnation has madeso little headway in the West in our own time is that most people feel it to bea licence for fantasy. The force of the objection can be seen in a case I havediscussed at length elsewhere: that of Dr Arthur Guirdham.* Dr Guirdham, who wassenior consultant in psychiatry for the Bath medical area, had always beenfascinated by the thirteenth-century heretical sect called the Cathars — ‘pureones’. They believed that God is not all-powerful, that evil is an independentforce, perhaps as strong as good, and that the realm of matter belongs to thedevil. The Church persecuted them, and in 1244 most of them were massacred atMontségur, near Toulouse. In Toulouse and other places in the area, Guirdham hadpowerful feelings of déjà vu. He had also suffered most of his adult life from anightmare in which he was lying down when he was approached by a tall man; heoften woke up screaming.In 1962, Guirdham saw a patient whom he calls Mrs Smith, who had often had asimilar nightmare. Both their nightmares ceased after she became his patient.What she did not tell him immediately was that she had recognised him as aperson who had recurred in her dreams for many years. These dreams — about herexistence as a girl in thirteenth-century France — had started after a series ofpeculiar attacks of unconsciousness. And in her dreams, she saw a young Catharpriest called Roger de Grisolles, who had come to her parents’ cottage one nightduring a snowstorm, and with whom she had a love affair. When her parents threwher out, she went to live with Roger in his house. Her dream-memories of thishouse became increasingly detailed. The idyll came to an end with a murder. Shewas not sure who was murdered, but she knew that someone called Pierre deMazerolles was involved. Roger died in prison, and she herself was later burnedalive at Montségur. She recognised Guirdham as ‘Roger’.It took ‘Mrs Smith’ a year to work up the courage to tell Guirdham about herdreams. He was thunderstruck. ‘Mrs Smith’ knew absolutely nothing aboutCatharism. But he knew that the persecution and massacre of the Cathars hadstarted after a man called Pierre de Mazerolles had organised the murder ofinquisitors sent to Toulouse by the pope. Guirdham began to investigate thedetails ‘Mrs Smith’ remembered about the Cathars. Some of the details soundedunlikely: for example, that Cathar priests wore green or blue. She made a noteof this in 1944; in 1965 the French scholar Jean Duvernoy discovered that someCathar priests did dress in green or blue. She had dreamed of sugar sawed from aloaf and used as a medicinal remedy; in 1969, the scholar Rene Nelli discoveredthat sugar was imported from the Arab countries in ‘loaves’ and was regarded asa universal remedy. ‘Mrs Smith’ ’s detailed description of Cathar rituals andbeliefs were again confirmed by the scholars.So far, the story sounds plausible enough to anyone who has an open mind aboutreincarnation. ‘Mrs Smith’ ’s discovery that Dr Guirdham had been her lover in aprevious existence sounds like a typical example of Freud’s ‘transferencephenomenon’ (when the patient falls in love with the doctor), and thecoincidence of the two coming together again in the twentieth century is alittle hard to swallow. But the confirmation of the details about Catharism byscholars seems to clinch the story. If Hudson’s ‘subjective mind’ was reallyresponsible for all these phenomena, then its powers must be even wider thanHudson thought.I wrote about Guirdham in my book The Occult, and went to stay with him at hishome near Bath. This certainly dissipated my suspicion that he might haveinvented Mrs Smith, for although I did not meet her, it was quite plain thatGuirdham is a perfectly normal, honest, well-balanced individual, not a crank,and his wife Mary, who confirmed the details of his book, seemed the epitome ofcommonsense. He showed me his correspondence with various scholars, and itbecame clear that he had left an enormous amount of evidence out of his book,simply for fear of confusing the reader.But what worried me, even at that stage, were the later developments of hisCathar involvement. He showed me the manuscript of a book called We Are OneAnother, which begins with his meeting with a woman he calls Clare Mills, anattractive, bustling open-air girl, who asked him one day if the words Raymondand Albigensian meant anything to him — they kept ‘repeating in her head’.Albigenses was another name for Cathars, and Raymond was the name of the countsof Toulouse. All this was before he had written his book about ‘Mrs Smith’, TheCathars and Reincarnation, so she had no way of knowing about his interest inthe subject. ‘Clare Mills’ had also had dreams of being burned, and the namesinvolved made it clear that she was also dreaming about the Cathar persecution.She dreamed of being made to walk half naked towards a huge bonfire, and ofbeing struck on the back by a burning torch — she had a strange birthmark therewhich looked like a series of hard blisters. Guirdham concluded that she wasanother Cathar with whom he had been acquainted in a previous existence. Butthis was not all. The mother of a dead girl showed Guirdham a notebook herdaughter had kept at the age of seven; it was full of Cathar names andsketches … Guirdham came to believe that the mother and daughter had both beenCathars. Other acquaintances became involved in the strange story, so that therewas no alternative to the belief that Guirdham was studying a case of ‘groupreincarnation’ (a doctrine preached by ‘Myers’ to Geraldine Cummins, we mayrecall).More was to come. In The Lake and the Castle, Guirdham explains how he becameconvinced that this same group of people had been involved together in anearlier epoch, as members of the reincarnationist Celtic church; they had alsosuffered martyrdom … And, as if feeling that a reader who can swallow a gnat canswallow a camel, Guirdham goes on to tell how this same group had also beeninvolved together in Roman Britain in the fourth century and in the Napoleonicera.I have been a friend of Arthur Guirdham ever since those days in the early1970s, and have often stayed in his home. He is the godfather of my daughter. SoI believe I know him fairly well. I have taken ‘Clare Mills’ out to dinner (withthe Guirdhams) and she confirmed everything he said. I have no reason to believehe is a Svengali who can persuade his patients to cooperate in his fantasiesabout previous lives, or that his books are inventions written to gainnotoriety. Clearly, he believes every word in them. Moreover, he is far toointelligent to allow his fantasy to run away with him. Ian Wilson points outthat if Guirdham had stopped after recounting the ‘Mrs Smith’ case, and perhapswritten a psychiatric study of ‘Mrs Smith’, his claims would probably have metwith serious attention. He knows as well as anyone that this ‘groupreincarnation’, and all the previous lives as Celts and Romans (not to mentionGuirdham’s own life as an ancient Greek of the thirteenth century BC, describedin The Island), make his story totally unacceptable to most readers. Presumablyhe would protest, like Sir William Crookes: ‘I didn’t say it was possible — Isaid it was true.’Father Crehan’s view of the case is that Guirdham, ‘Mrs Smith’, ‘Clare Mills’and the rest were telepathic, and that they somehow ‘pooled’ their fantasies andthe results of their reading. Guirdham’s account of his relation with ‘MrsSmith’ makes this quite impossible — she had been making detailed notes aboutthe Cathars eighteen years before she met him. So we are left with only twopossible solutions: either that Guirdham is a self-deceiver on a heroic scale,or that the concept of ‘group reincarnation’ is basically true.Fortunately, it is of no immediate consequence to this argument whether it istrue or not. The picture that emerges from case histories of reincarnation seemsquite clear and consistent, and it fits the general pattern of arguments for‘survival’ without contradiction. We have noted, for example, that Mary Roffknew about her parents’ attempt to communicate with her through a medium, andwas able to quote the words she had written at the seance. Mediumship actuallyseems to be a form of temporary ‘possession’. Mary and Lurancy Vennum apparentlycame to an agreement about the possession of Lurancy Vennum’s body for a fewmonths. After it was all over, Mary still ‘dropped in’ periodically.The picture that emerges is of ‘disembodied’ entities who can, under the rightcircumstances, enter or leave a human body exactly as a driver can enter orleave a car. In the case of Jasbir Lal Jat, it looks as if Sobha Ram found theabandoned car while the engine was still warm, and slipped into the drivingseat. The idea seems an affront to commonsense, but the evidence is there tosupport it.On the whole, the ‘facts’, as they emerge from various cases, seem to supportSteiner’s view of reincarnation as an evolutionary experience, as set forth inthe eight volumes of Karmic Relationships. There is only one major point ofcontradiction; Steiner seemed to feel that the process of reincarnation takesanything from a hundred to a thousand years. But Steiner’s own views evolvedover the years; there are some major differences between Theosophy (1904) and AnOutline of Occult Science six years later. Steiner never claimed to beinfallible; like all mystics, he tried to describe his ‘glimpses’ as he receivedthem.Steiner’s importance lies in the impressive consistency of his teachings, and onhis insistence that it is a mistake to try to take ‘spiritualism’ too literally.‘The Spiritualists are the greatest materialists of all.’ He never ceased toemphasise that ‘the spirit world is woven out of the substance of which humanthought consists.’ What he seems to be saying is that man is somehow quitemistaken to assume that he is ‘imprisoned’ in a material world, and in allowingthis to induce a certain basic passivity towards his own life. He loves toemphasise the immense latent creative powers of the human mind. So although hisattitude towards Spiritualism often seems hostile, he is fundamentallyreaffirming what Myers says in Human Personality — and what Catherine Crowe hadsaid before him: that human beings possess enormous hidden powers they nevereven suspect. The point is underlined by a passage that expresses the essence ofSteiner’s thought:Your present surroundings are, in a sense, your creation, in that you arementally so unemancipated; your nerves and senses convey to you your ownperception of life. If you were capable of focusing your ego or dailyconsciousness within your deeper mind, if in short you trained yourself to passinto a thought compound from which form, as the senses convey it, were absent,the material world would vanish.In fact, these words are not by Rudolf Steiner; they are from the ‘script’written by ‘Myers’, and published by Geraldine Cummins as The Road toImmortality. It emphasises Steiner’s repeated assertion that it is a mistake totake the ‘facts’ too literally. To do so is to leave out of account a ‘fifthdimension’ that confers meaning on them.*‘Descriptive Sketches of the Spiritual World’, lectures given at Bergen on 10and 11 October 1913.*Under the name Whately Smith.*See my Mysteries, Part 1, Chapter 1.*American Society for Psychical Research, 1966.*University of Virginia Press, 1975–80.*Widler Penfield, Mysteries of the Mind, 1975, Chapter 6.*In Strange Powers, 1973."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENDECLINE AND REBIRTHThe sufferings of the First World War had the effect of making thousands ofconverts to spiritualism — and, paradoxically, of convincing more people thanever before that it was nonsense. The man who must bear a large part of theresponsibility for these contrary effects was Sir Oliver Lodge.In November 1916, Lodge’s Raymond, or Life and Death was published, and causedan immediate sensation — although not quite of the kind Lodge had hoped for.Ever since 1909, when Lodge had produced a book called The Survival of Man —admitting his belief in life after death — scientists had felt that he had ‘letdown the side’. But at least in that book he had discussed the experimentalevidence and maintained a rigorous scientific detachment. But to devote afour-hundred-page book to arguing that his son had come back from the deadlooked like emotional self-indulgence. Raymond made an easy target for hostilereviewers — particularly a passage in which Raymond explained that the ‘otherside’ is not all that different from our earth. Most people, he said, wore whiterobes, although many would have preferred to wear a suit. They could also eat ifthey wanted to, or even have a cigar or a whisky and soda. ‘There arelaboratories over here and they manufacture all sorts of things in them.’ Itsounded too silly for words. One psychologist called Charles Mercier was quickoff the mark with a thoroughly hostile book called Spiritualism and Sir OliverLodge. But most scientists felt simply that Lodge had become a little cracked,and that the kindest thing would be to ignore him.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle encountered the same hostility in 1918 when he confessedhis conversion to Spiritualism in a book called The New Revelation. During thewar, the Doyles had looked after an ailing young woman called LilyLoder-Symonds, who amused herself in her sickbed by practising automaticwriting. The Doyles were convinced that it was simply her subconscious mindspeaking. Then one day there came a message: ‘It is terrible. Terrible. And willhave a great influence on the war.’ On that day, a German submarine sank thepassenger liner Lusitania and over a thousand passengers were drowned, many ofthem American. The sinking prepared the way for America’s entry into the war.From then on, the Doyles took the automatic writing more seriously. In April1915, Conan Doyle’s brother-in-law Malcolm Leckie died at Mons. One day, asDoyle was sitting by Lily Loder-Symonds’s bedside, watching her produceautomatic writing, he was startled to recognise Malcolm Leckie’s handwriting.Doyle began to ask questions, and ‘Leckie’ replied. Doyle asked him aparticularly difficult question — about a private conversation they had hadbefore the war. The reply specified precisely what he and Leckie had discussed.Yet Doyle had mentioned it to no one else — not even his wife. From then on, hehad no doubt of the reality of life after death.His conversion caused even more embarrassment than that of Sir Oliver Lodge.Distinguished friends, such as Lloyd George, Winston Churchill and King GeorgeV, felt that he was displaying a childish credulity. Many people askedmockingly: ‘What would Sherlock Holmes have said?’ In fact, when the finalvolume of Sherlock Holmes stories — The Case Book — appeared in 1927, itreceived an unprecedentedly cold reception; the middle-class public felt thatits idol had revealed feet of clay. The last novel about the great ProfessorChallenger — The Land of Mist — in which Challenger is converted to Spiritualism— was received with widespread derision. Doyle’s biographer states that Doyle’ssupport of Spiritualism prevented him from receiving a peerage.*One of the saddest stories of anti-spiritualist prejudice concerns an architectcalled Frederick Bligh Bond. In 1907, the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey were boughtby the nation, and Bligh Bond was appointed to take charge of the excavations.Bond was a devotee of Catherine Crowe’s Night Side of Nature, and decided thathis task would be greatly simplified if he could contact some of the long-deadmonks of the abbey and ask them where to dig. A friend named John Allen Bartlettwas able to produce automatic writing. In November 1907, Bond and Bartlett saton either side of a table, with Bartlett holding a pencil and Bond’s handresting very lightly on top of it. Bond asked questions, and Bartlett’s handwrote out the answers. When Bond asked where a missing chapel had been situated,Bartlett’s hand drew a plan of the abbey with the chapel on it. The‘communicator’ called himself ‘Gulielmus Monachus’ — William the Monk. And whenBond’s team dug in the position indicated, they found the chapel. His employers— the Church of England — were delighted. They continued to be delighted as Bondmade find after find, including another chapel. Bond took care to tell no onethat most of his information came from William the Monk and various othercommunicators who called themselves ‘the Watchers’. Finally, in 1917, he decidedthat his success had justified itself, and told the whole story in a book calledGate of Remembrance. The Church was horrified, and Bond found himself out of ajob. He was not even allowed within the precincts of the abbey, and the abbeybook shop was ordered not to sell his guide book to Glastonbury.There is an ironical footnote to this story. In 1936, the Archbishop ofCanterbury, Cosmo Lang, decided that it was time for the Church of England tomake up its mind about Spiritualism. So he appointed a commission to look intoit, and to decide whether the doctrines of Spiritualism were consistent withChristianity. The commission took three years to report. Their conclusion wasthat not only was Spiritualism not opposed to Christianity — after all,Christians believe in a life after death — but that the evidence for ‘survival’was extremely powerful. The archbishop was apparently so embarrassed by theseconclusions that he dropped the report into a drawer, where it lay forgotten formore than thirty years; it was finally published in the mid-1970s.We have already observed this phenomenon: the feeling that there is somethingmorbid and degenerate about a preoccupation with life after death. It is aperfectly valid reaction. Healthy people feel naturally that we should turn ourattention to the fascinating problems of life and the physical universe ratherthan to death. Yet we can also see that such criticism is totally irrelevantwhere Lodge and Doyle were concerned. Doyle would have been an idiot not to beimpressed when the automatic writing told him something that was known to noother living person. Lodge would have been a very poor scientist if he hadfailed to recognise that the Raymond group photograph* constitued strong primafacie evidence that his son had survived death. It is important to remember thatLodge and Doyle had been members of the Society for Psychical Research for morethan two decades before they finally became convinced of ‘survival’; the sameapplied to James Hyslop and Sir William Barrett. Crookes himself only came toaccept ‘survival’ in 1917, after a seance at which he became convinced that hisdead wife was speaking to him. These men were convinced by evidence, not bywishful thinking.This in itself tells us why spiritualism failed to convince the masses. If ittook twenty years to overcome the doubts of men who were interested in theproblem, it would obviously take centuries to convince those who weren’t.It must also be admitted that Raymond Lodge’s remarks about cigars and whiskyand soda — not to mention white robes — probably did more harm to spiritualismthan the exposure of a dozen fake mediums. And, in various forms, the problemhas continued to be a bugbear ever since. There is a slight element of absurdityin the whole notion of life after death — a touch of the preposterous that wasexploited in H. G. Wells’s ‘Inexperienced Ghost’ and Noel Coward’s BlitheSpirit. And most of the books about life after death fail to avoid this touch ofabsurdity. In 1928, the Rev. Charles Drayton Thomas produced his book LifeBeyond Death With Evidence, an impressive account of his ‘contacts’ with hisdeceased father and sister through mediums. But when his father begins todescribe the world he lives in, there is an effect of bathos:We have roads, but the surface is unlike the stoned or macadamised roads ofEngland … The appearance is something like natural soil, but without mud oranything disagreeable …We have London, but it is not your London … There is some likeness in the parksand beautiful buildings, but with us they are all finer … I have seen no snakesor lions here … We have horses, dogs and cats but very few monkeys …After all this, it is difficult to feel the appropriate emotion when the fatherand sister describe an interview with Jesus, who, predictably, radiates ‘a greatmajesty, together with great sweetness and humility’.In the 1930s, a medium named Jane Sherwood began to practise automatic writing,and received lengthy Communications from a certain ‘G. F. Scott’ describing thelife beyond; these were published as The Psychic Bridge and The Country Beyond.‘Scott’ later revealed his true identity — as T. E. Lawrence — and dictatedanother book about his own personal experiences of life after death. A spiritcalled Mitchell, who had taken upon himself the role of Lawrence’s mentor, tellsLawrence that he has lived a monk-like existence, and that he ought to go andexperiment with all the experiences he has missed on earth. For example, women.‘Go on a proper spree.’ Lawrence is taken on a kind of brothel tour. ‘Thesegirls are not prostitutes … they are women who have missed sexual experiencesduring their earth life and need to work out this lack before they can progress…’ And Lawrence, who on earth had shown homosexual tendencies and a taste forbeing flogged, bursts into lyrical prose: ‘We two have wandered happily in anenchanted land exploring the delights of an intimate companionship crowned bythe magic of union …’*If it were obvious that Jane Sherwood and Drayton Thomas had been deceived —either by their own unconscious minds or by spirits with a penchant forleg-pulling — these passages would not be such an embarrassment. But JaneSherwood’s The Country Beyond has been described by Raynor C. Johnson — aleading authority on mysticism — as ‘one of the best attempts to convey to usvalid impressions of the conditions we shall all have to meet some day when wehave finished with our physical bodies’. And Drayton Thomas’s book is one of themost impressive arguments for ‘survival’ ever published; his ‘father’ was ableto accurately forecast items he would find in the newspapers the following day —items which (as enquiry revealed) had not even been set up in print at the time.It seems that these awkward paradoxes are inherent in the nature ofspiritualism. Students of the paranormal find them no more off-putting thanpoetry lovers find Wordsworth’s occasional descents into bathos. They are simplyanother aspect of ‘James’s Law’. But for many potential converts between thewars, they formed an insuperable barrier to belief. Laboratories and brothels inthe sky could simply not be taken seriously.There were several other causes for the decline of spiritualism in the 1920s and1930s. The days of the great mediums — such as Dunglas Home, Eusapia Palladino,Leonore Piper — seemed to be at an end. There were still many remarkable mediums— Mrs Leonard, the Schneider brothers, Helen Duncan — but their achievementswere not so spectacular. In the cynical and disillusioned frame of mindengendered by the Great War, exposures and denunciations received far morepublicity than successful experiments with mediums. The magician Harry Houdinimade a career from attacking spiritualism in the 1920s; his book A MagicianAmong the Spirits denounced mediums as ‘human vultures’. When investigating theAmerican medium Margery Crandon, there is evidence that Houdini cheated byhiding a ruler in a specially designed cabinet, so she could be accused of usingit to ring a bell. (Houdini’s assistant later admitted that he had hidden theruler in the cabinet on Houdini’s orders, and added: ‘There’s one thing you’vegot to remember about Mr ‘Oudini — for ‘im the truth was bloody well what hewanted it to be.’) In fact, even the serious investigators often seemed to be onthe side of the sceptics. After a series of experiments with the Austrian mediumRudi Schneider, Harry Price denounced him in a Sunday newspaper instead ofsimply making an unfavourable report to the Society for Psychical Research. (Itbecame clear later that his motive was pique because Schneider had agreed towork with some rival investigators.) And when Helen Duncan was charged withcheating and fined ten pounds, Price wrote a book attacking her. In due course,Price himself would be denounced for trickery in his most famous investigation —the haunting of Borley Rectory …In the Society for Psychical Research, the sceptics became known as the High ’nDries. In the Society’s early days, Frank Podmore had been its only High ’n Dry.By the late 1920s, some of the Society’s most influential members, including itsResearch Officer E. J. Dingwall and its librarian Theodore Besterman, were High’n Dries. The ‘wets’ — or even the faintly damps — hardly stood a chance.Dingwall went to America to investigate Margery Crandon, and was apparentlythoroughly satisfied with her genuineness — large quantities of ectoplasm wereextruded from somewhere between her thighs, and reached out to touch Dingwall inthe form of a hand — but when he came to write up his investigations six monthslater, he had changed his mind, and made it clear he thought she was a fraud.The result of such controversies was that the Society was split by internaldissensions, and ceased to perform the task it was founded to carry out. Oneresult was that when reports of an amazing Brazilian medium, Carlos Mirabelli,who floated up into the air, dematerialised and reappeared in another room, andcaused dead people to materialise in broad daylight, reached the Society in1927, it was in too much disarray to send a competent investigator, andMirabelli’s remarkable phenomena were never confirmed. The days when the Societycould despatch a man like Richard Hodgson to the other side of the world at afew weeks’ notice were long past.There was one major breakthrough in psychical research — or, as it now came tobe called, paranormal investigation — in the 1930s. A gambler walked into theoffice of Dr Joseph Banks Rhine at Duke University in 1934 and told Rhine he wasconvinced he could influence the fall of the dice. As the two crouched on thefloor, it dawned on Rhine that this might be a method for proving psychokinesis— ‘mind over matter’ — in the laboratory. Eighteen series of statistical testswere conducted over eight years, and they showed one fascinating result: thatwhen people were ‘fresh’, they could influence the fall of the die; as they wenton and became tired and bored, they got worse at it. Rhine’s methods may havebeen dull compared to the experiments of Crookes with Dunglas Home or Richetwith Eusapia Palladino, but he effectively proved the paranormal powers of thehuman mind in the laboratory.This was undoubtedly an enormous step forward; it demonstrated the correctnessof that central argument of Catherine Crowe and Frederick Myers: that the powersof the human mind are greater than we suppose. But it came no closer toanswering the question that the Society for Psychical Research was founded toinvestigate: is there life after death? Then, in the late 1930s, another seriesof statistical experiments brought this one stage nearer.Dr Samuel George Soal was a mathematician at the University of London, and hewas unimpressed by Rhine’s results. In 1936, a well-known photographer namedBasil Shackleton walked into Soal’s office and announced: ‘I haven’t come to betested, but to demonstrate telepathy.’ He could, he claimed, guess his waythrough a whole pack of playing cards and get most of them right. Soal testedhim, but was disappointed; Shackleton’s first score was ten out of twenty-five,but after that, he got steadily worse; on the seventh test he only got three outof twenty-five. Shackleton said he needed a drink to get his powers working; buteven after a drink, his score was still disappointingly low.In 1939, a conversation with another researcher, Whately Carington, gave Soal anew idea. Carington had been involved in a series of ‘picture guessing’experiments, and he had noticed a curious phenomenon: some of his subjects wereguessing the next picture. Soal went back and looked at some of his own results.First of all, he looked at the results produced by a London housewife namedGloria Stewart, and found that she had frequently guessed the next card. Soalwent on to look through results produced by other subjects, but found nothingvery interesting. Then, by chance, he came upon Basil Shackleton’s results. Herethe ‘displacement’ score was even more striking than in the case of GloriaStewart; again and again, Shackleton guessed either the previous card or thenext card, instead of the one Soal was asking him to concentrate on. Soal askedShackleton to take part in another series of experiments. They went on for twoyears, and demonstrated beyond all doubt that Shackleton was frequently able toguess the next card — a card that Soal himself had not yet seen. So this was nottelepathy; it was precognition: the faculty apparently demonstrated by DraytonThomas’s father when he was able to predict what would be in the newspapers thenext day.It is true, of course, that precognition does not ‘prove’ life after death. Butif it really exists, it proves there is something fundamentally wrong with ourcommonsense, materialistic view of the universe. We can find room for telepathyand psychokinesis in the scientific picture of reality. But the future has notyet taken place; consequently, there is no possible ‘scientific’ way in which itcan be known. To explain precognition, we need to take a leap into somecompletely new type of explanation: for example, some fourth or fifth dimension,of the kind suggested by Whately Carington in A Theory of the Mechanism ofSurvival. When Soal demonstrated precognition, he had taken the most importantstep towards ‘proving’ life after death since the foundation of the Society forPsychical Research.In 1942, an American researcher, Dr Gertrude Schmeidler, of Radcliffe College,produced a result that was almost as important. She was testing a group ofstudents for extra-sensory perception (ESP), and before the experiment, sheasked them which of them believed in the possibility of ESP and which didn’t.She labelled the ‘believers’ sheep and the ‘nonbelievers’ goats. When sheexamined the results of the card-guessing tests, she discovered that the sheephad scored significantly above chance. But what was even more interesting wasthat the goats had scored significantly below chance. They were unconsciously‘cheating’ to support their view that ESP does not exist. In doing so, they wererevealing as much extra-sensory perception as the sheep, but using itnegatively. For years, mediums and psychics had been explaining that theirpowers often failed to work in the presence of sceptics, and the sceptics hadjeered at this as a feeble excuse. Gertrude Schmeidler had demonstrated thatscepticism is not necessarily as scientific and detached as it pretends to be.These results were taken to heart by Dr Helmut Schmidt, a research scientist atthe Boeing Laboratory in Seattle. If people are more likely to showextra-sensory perception in a friendly, trusting atmosphere, then it would be agreat advantage if the scientist could devise an experiment in which cheating isquite impossible. Then he can relax and try to coax the subject into the rightmood for ESP. Schmidt met this challenge by devising a machine that useddecaying radioactive material to make various lamps go on and off. Nobody hasthe least idea when the next radioactive atom will ‘decay’ and shoot out ahigh-speed particle. Schmidt’s subjects had to guess which lamp would be thenext to light up, and press a button. Then the machine automatically registereda hit or miss.Schmidt soon discovered a number of subjects who scored well above chance. Manyof these were already psychic — one physicist admitted that he often dreamed ofthe future. Schmidt also produced a perfect demonstration of GertrudeSchmeidler’s ‘sheep and goats’ argument — one extrovert American girl whoproduced scores well above chance, and one introverted South American whosescores were equally far below chance, demonstrating as much psychic ability asthe extrovert, but used in a negative direction. These two subjects were alsoable to demonstrate psychokinesis — mind over matter — by willing lights toflash on and off in a particular direction. Helmut Schmidt was the firstscientist to demonstrate the reality of extra-sensory perception andpsychokinesis in the laboratory.These advances were impressive. But anyone who took an interest in psychicalresearch in the 1960s and early 1970s had to admit that it had all become ratherboring. Card-guessing games and random-number generators may producemarvellously convincing proofs of the reality of extra-sensory perception orprecognition, but it is hard for most people to work themselves into a state ofexcitement about it. This is not quite what Myers and Sidgwick had in mind onthat famous starlit walk.There was at least one researcher who was still working in the older tradition.Dr Karlis Osis, born in Riga, Latvia in 1917, had worked with Rhine at DukeUniversity on extra-sensory perception and precognition before he becameresearch director at the Parapsychology Foundation in New York. Osis wasfascinated by the kind of death-bed visions reported by Sir William Barrett —like the case of ‘Mrs B’,* who saw her father and sister in the room as she wasdying, although she had no idea that her sister was dead. He called them ‘Peakin Darien cases’, from the last line of Keats’s sonnet — a suggestion ofreverence and awe. He had the sensible idea of circulating a questionnaire todoctors and nurses, asking them what they had observed about dying patients. Sixhundred and forty questionnaires were returned, covering more than thirty-fivethousand cases. In 1961, Osis published his observations in DeathbedObservations by Physicians and Nurses.One of the first things Osis discovered was that fear is not the dominantemotion in most dying patients. Discomfort and pain were commoner; but what wassurprising was the large number of patients who were elated at the time ofdeath, even to the point of exaltation and seeing visions. These amounted toabout one in twenty. The visions were often of ‘heaven’ — of beautiful cities ora ‘promised land’. A six-year-old boy dying of polio saw beautiful flowers andheard birds singing. Most of these patients were fully awake and in clearconsciousness, with a normal temperature. Many patients who were brought backfrom the dead by medical attention were often unwilling to be revived andexpressed sentiments like ‘I want to go back.’ One doctor, recalling twopersonal experiences of near death hallucinations, suggested that this might bedue to oxygen starvation of the brain. He had been close to death by drowning,and also by oxygen starvation when his breathing equipment froze up in anaeroplane; on both occasions he experienced beautiful imagery and a feeling ofdeep happiness; he resented being revived from drowning. But other medicalexperts have disagreed, and Osis points out that such visions often occurred infully conscious patients long before the final slide into the death coma.In his summary of conclusions, Osis remains cautious. He notes that Barrett wasmistaken to believe that all death-bed visions of relatives involve those whoare dead. He found that 52 per cent were of dead relatives, 28 per cent ofliving relatives, and the remaining 20 per cent of religious figures. But theCensus of Hallucination taken by the Society for Psychical Research showed thatpeople in normal health saw twice as many living relatives as dead ones. So‘predominance of hallucinations of the dead seems to be a real characteristic ofterminal cases’. And in reply to the obvious criticism that dying patients maybe sedated or in states of fever, he points out that most of the visions of deadrelatives happened to patients who had not been sedated, who had no‘hallucinogenic pathology’, and who were fully awake and able to respondintelligently to questions. So in its general conclusions, Deathbed Observationsby Physicians and Nurses backs up the conclusions reached by Barrett in DeathBed Visions: that dying people usually feel no fear of dying, and that theyoften believe they are being met by dead relatives.Osis concludes his study by remarking that his observations need verifying,particularly by studies in other cultures. This hint was taken up by hiscolleague Erlendur Haraldsson, who conducted similar studies in India. It mighthave been reasonable to expect that, in a totally different culture —particularly one that places less emphasis on life after death — death-bedvisions would be of a different kind. Haraldsson discovered this was not so; thedeath-bed visions of Indians were much the same as those of Americans.Osis and Haraldsson approached the problem of death in the detached spirit of aSociety for Psychical Research investigation. The other major investigation ofthe 1960s was undertaken with altogether more emotional commitment. Dr ElizabethKübler-Ross had visited the extermination camp Maidanek at the end of the SecondWorld War, and established a camp for refugees on the Vista river in Poland. InAmerica in the early 1960s, now married to a professor of neurology andpathology in Chicago, she was struck by the American tendency to ignore deathand pretend that it does not exist. She often found that doctors would refuse toadmit the terminally ill to their wards. She gained nationwide notoriety whenshe invited a twenty-year-old girl who was dying of leukaemia to her classes atthe University of Chicago, and Life ran an article about the experiment. Thedeath of this girl in 1970 confirmed Dr Kübler-Ross’s feeling that our‘death-denying society’ needs to have its attitudes changed.To begin with, her attitude towards life after death was one of scepticism; shewas only concerned with the psychological problems involved in accepting death.Gradually, her study of the dying led her to the conviction that both ‘survival’and reincarnation are established facts. Her own observation of death-bedvisions of the dying confirmed that they often see dead relatives. She noted,for example, that while dying children hope to be with mummy and daddy, theyactually tend to see deceased grandparents on the point of death.Her conclusions, set out in books like Of Death and Dying and Questions andAnswers on Death and Dying, are not presented as systematically as those of Osisand Haraldsson, but their general outline is clear enough. She believes thateveryone knows the time of his own death, and that everyone who dies is met bydead relatives or other loved ones. She has also come to accept that dyingshould be regarded as a climax of living, and perhaps as its most beautifulexperience. She is convinced that all human beings have ‘guides’ who continuallywatch over them, and who can be seen in moments of psychic stress. As to the‘world beyond death’, she has accepted two major conclusions that are statedrepeatedly in the literature of spiritualism: that time in ‘the next world’ isquite unlike time as we know it, and that there is no ‘judgement’ of the dead;they judge — and punish — themselves.Elizabeth Kübler-Ross’s obvious emotional identification with her subject hasled to accusations that she has allowed her beliefs to dictate her findings.This may well be so. But it is also clear that these findings are based upon thestudy of hundreds of cases, and that they are basically consistent with those ofBarrett, Osis and Haraldsson.By the late 1960s, the subject of near-death experiences had begun to attract anincreasing number of serious investigators. Two of these, Russell Noyes and RayKletti, came upon some long-forgotten work on this subject by a professor ofgeology from Zurich, Albert Heim, whose own near-death experience had occurredwhen he was leading a climbing party in the Alps in 1871. A gust of wind blewhis hat off, and as he tried to grab it, he fell seventy feet to a snow-coveredledge. The fall only occupied a few seconds, yet he felt that time had expandedinto far more than that:Mental activity became enormous, rising to a hundred fold velocity … I saw mywhole past life take place in many images, as though on a stage at some distancefrom me … Everything was transfigured as though by a heavenly light, withoutanxiety and without pain. The memory of very tragic experiences I had had wasclear but not saddening. I felt no conflict or strife; conflict had beentransmuted into love. Elevated and harmonious thoughts dominated and unitedindividual images, and like magnificent music a divine calm swept through mysoul. I became ever more surrounded by a splendid blue heaven with delicate androsy and violet cloudlets. I swept into it painlessly and softly and I saw thatnow I was falling freely through the air and that under me a snow field laywaiting.Heim was knocked unconscious by his fall but survived. And the exquisitelypeaceful quality of the experience led him to begin collecting other people’sobservations on climbing accidents. He claimed that, over twenty years ofresearch, he had discovered that 95 per cent of the victims had experiencedsimilar feelings to his own. Heim’s conclusion was that people who had died fromfalls had experienced the same feeling of peace and reconciliation at the end.Noyes and Kletti published a translation of Heim’s observations, and added muchresearch of their own. Unlike Elizabeth Kübler-Ross, they were unable to acceptthe view that such experiences provide some kind of proof of survival. Their ownconclusion was that when man faces death, he experiences a ‘depersonalisation’which is basically a psychological defence against death. The result is a kindof ‘death trance’ whose purpose is to make death easy. The sensation of seeingthe whole of one’s past life also seems common to these experiences. LyallWatson quotes the case of a nineteen-year-old skydiver who fell from a height ofthree thousand feet.* ‘All my past life flashed before my eyes … I saw mymother’s face, all the houses I’ve lived in, the military academy I attended,the faces of friends, everything.’ In fact, he had a soft landing and broke onlyhis nose. These experiences of heightened memory have obviously a great deal incommon with the ‘flashback’ experience discovered by Wilder Penfield when hetouched the cerebral cortex with an electric probe during an operation on anepileptic and induced memories of childhood.In the mid-1960s, when Elizabeth Kübler-Ross was beginning her research into thedeath experience, a young philosophy student at the University of Virginia,Raymond Moody, was also starting to collect accounts of near-death experiences.One of the men who aroused his interest in the subject was a psychiatrist, DrGeorge Ritchie of Virginia, who, as a young soldier, had apparently ‘died’ andthen revived. In December 1943, Ritchie had been in hospital in Texas with arespiratory infection. He began to spit blood and lost consciousness; when hewoke up he saw his own body lying on the bed. Outside in the corridor a ward boywalked through him; a man he tapped on the shoulder ignored him. He tried to getback into his body but found it impossible. Then Ritchie experienced some kindof religious revelation. The room became ‘brighter than a thousand arc lights’and a figure he identified as Jesus appeared. After a tour of a great city inwhich he was shown the consequences of sin, Ritchie woke up in his body, quiteconvinced he had died. Like so many who have been through the near-deathexperience, Ritchie insisted that it was quite unlike a dream; it all seemedquite real.For the next eleven years, Moody went on collecting near-death experiences,quite unaware that anyone else was doing so — at this stage he had never heardof Elizabeth Kübler-Ross. Three years’ teaching philosophy convinced him hewould rather be a doctor, and he took a medical degree. Over the years, hecollected about a hundred and fifty near-death experiences, was struck by theirbasic similarities, and wrote a short book about them called Life After Life.When his publisher sent a proof to Elizabeth Kübler-Ross, she commented that shemight have written the same book herself. Life After Life appeared in 1977, andbecame a national bestseller.The similarities are certainly striking. There was, first of all, the sense ofpeace and happiness described by Heim, the Rev. Bertrand and so many others.There was another experience that appeared again and again: the impression ofmoving through a dark tunnel, usually with a light at the end. ‘I was movingthrough this — you’re going to think this is weird — through this long darkplace. It seemed like a sewer or something.’ ‘It was like being in a cylinder …’‘I entered head first into a narrow and very very dark passageway.’ ‘Suddenly Iwas in a very dark, very deep valley.’In case after case, the person emerges from the tunnel to find himself lookingat his own body. (There were, however, many cases in which the experience beganwith the out-of-the-body experience.) A youth who almost drowned saw his body‘in the water about three or four feet away, bobbing up and down. I viewed mybody from the back, and slightly to the right side.’ A woman who ‘died’ withheart trouble felt herself:sliding down between the mattress and the rail on the side of the bed — actuallyit seemed as if I went through the rail — on down to the floor. Then I startedrising upward, slowly. On my way up, I saw more nurses come running into theroom … then I stopped, floating right below the ceiling, looking down.Compare this with a case described by Kübler-Ross, in which a woman in intensivecare went into a critical condition, and the nurse rushed out of the room to gethelp:Meanwhile, this woman felt herself float out of her body. In fact, she said shecould look down and see how pale her face looked. Yet at the same time she feltabsolutely wonderful. She had a great sense of peace and relief.The same thing was described again and again by Moody’s subjects: theout-of-the-body experience, accompanied by a blissful sense of timelessness.Another recurrent feature was the perception of the ‘new body’ — shaped like thephysical body that had been left behind. Patients often became aware of this‘new body’ when they realised they were no longer in the old one — often bytrying to communicate with other people. ‘I tried talking to them but nobodycould hear me, nobody would listen to me.’ ‘… they would just walk through me’.The physical senses often seem to be heightened, so that seeing and hearing arefar more keen than in the physical body. But the ‘hearing’, when it concernsvoices, seems to be a form of telepathy or thought-transfer. (This again is afeature that can be found in records of near-death and after-‘death’ experiencessince the beginning of psychical research: communication becomes telepathic.)There is often a feeling of awful loneliness, but this is usually dispelled whenthe ‘dead’ person becomes aware of others like himself: sometimes other peoplewho have died — relatives or friends — and sometimes an entity or spirit hebelieves to be a guardian angel. One man was told by such a spirit that ‘I havehelped you through this stage of your existence, but now I am going to turn youover to others.’ One of the commonest experiences was of a bright light — likethe ‘thousand arc lights’ described by George Ritchie — which seems to radiate asense of love and warmth; Christians, understandably, are inclined to identifythis with Jesus. There is a sense of direct telepathic communication, withoutlanguage. ‘It was like talking to a person, but a person wasn’t there.’ The‘light’ may ask probing questions about what the person has done with his life.And this, Moody found, was often followed by ‘flashbacks’, a flood of memoriesin which the past life is seen in review.Very often there was a sense of some kind of border or limit — like the bigstones described by Wiltse. It may be a body of water, a distant shore, a greymist, or many other things. The ‘dead’ person experiences a conviction that ifhe passes this limit, then he is permanently ‘dead’. Until it is passed, thereis a choice of returning to the body. Since all Moody’s interviewees hadreturned from the near-death experience, he heard many different versions of howthe return to the body was accomplished. ‘I just fell right back down to mybody. The next thing I knew I was in my body again.’ ‘… it was just like aswoooosh and I felt like I was drawn through a limited area, a kind of funnel, Iguess’. But the majority of people simply woke up and found themselves ‘alive’again.In a subsequent book, based on further research (Reflections on Life AfterLife), Moody observed some other interesting aspects of the near-deathexperience. There were many glimpses of a ‘heavenly’ realm, and the phrase ‘cityof light’ occurred repeatedly. There was also an experience Moody calls ‘thevision of knowledge’, a flash of mystical insight into the nature of theuniverse:for a second I knew all the secrets of all the ages, all the meaning of theuniverse, the stars, the moon — of everything … This all-powerful knowledgeopened before me. It seemed that I was being told that I was going to remainsick for quite a while and that I would have several close calls. And I did haveseveral close calls after that. They said some of it would be to erase thisall-knowing knowledge that I had picked up … that I had been granted theuniversal secrets and that I would have to undergo time to forget thatknowledge. But I do have the memory of once knowing everything …Asked ‘In what form did this knowledge seem to be presented to you?’, Moodyreceived the reply: ‘It was in all forms of communication, sights, sounds,thoughts. It was as if there was nothing that wasn’t known. All knowledge wasthere, not just of one field but everything.’ Moody asked: ‘One thing I wonder.I’ve spent a lot of my life seeking knowledge, learning. If this happens, isn’tthat sort of thing rather pointless.’ The reply was:No! You still want to seek knowledge even after you come back here. I’m stillseeking knowledge … It’s silly to try to get the answers here. I sort of feltthat it was part of our purpose … but that it wasn’t just for one person, butthat it was to be used for all mankind. We’re always reaching out to help otherswith what we know.Moody was struck by this notion of ‘forgetting’ this universal knowledge beforereturning to life, and cites Plato’s story of a soldier called Er — from TheRepublic — who was allowed to return from death. Er describes how the souls whowere allowed to return to earth had to first drink of the waters of the River ofForgetfulness, and some of them ‘who were not saved by good sense’ drank far toomuch. Like many of Moody’s subjects, Er had no idea of how he returned to life;he simply woke up and found himself lying on his funeral pyre. It is plain thatwhat interests Moody about all this is the question of that barrier of‘forgetfulness’ that seems to interpose between ‘the other world’ and thepresent one — and, by implication, the question of why some people seem to haveescaped total forgetfulness.Another of Moody’s subjects described his ‘knowledge’ experience as being like aschool. ‘… it was real. It was like a school, and there was no one there, andyet there were a lot of people there … you would feel, sense the presence ofothers being around’. Moody compared this with the comment of another subjectwho, in a near-death experience, felt that he had been into what he called‘libraries’ and ‘institutions of higher learning’. His present subject agreedenthusiastically:this is a place where the place is knowledge … It’s like you focus mentally onone place in that school and — zoom — knowledge flows by you from that placeautomatically. It’s just like you’d had about a dozen speed reading courses.Another woman told him: ‘It was like I knew all things … I thought whatever Iwanted to know could be known.’All this is important because it seems to answer a fundamental objection to thewhole notion of ‘survival’ — the apparent triviality of the preoccupations ofthe ‘communicators’. If we are going to wake up in the next world to the samekind of consciousness we have to put up with here, it scarcely seems worth thetrouble of dying. Most of us are obscurely aware that there is something wrongwith the quality of everyday consciousness; it is always getting us involvedwith questions and problems that we know to be unimportant, yet which stick inour heads like some irritating tune. When we experience a sudden surge ofhappiness or vitality, these problems are whipped away like a leaf in a gale. Soif, as most spiritualists seem to agree, death is some kind of an evolution,then we have some kind of vague expectation that it will involve a higher levelof vitality, a ‘bird’s eye view’ of what life is all about, a greater freedom.The whole atmosphere of seances seems to be irritatingly banal, ‘human all toohuman’. Even when the communicators claim to be great musicians or writers — asin the case of the psychic Rosemary Brown — what they have to offer seemsdownright sub-standard, the kind of thing that would have ended in theirwaste-paper baskets on earth.Moody’s subjects who experienced ‘visions of knowledge’ seem to be making thepoint that life after death is not really a continuation of earth life on thesame level. Moody emphasises how often they say things like ‘It’s impossible toexplain’, or ‘the words I would use are different because there really are nowords …’ This may also be regarded as an answer to Rudolf Steiner’s objectionthat ‘the Spiritualists are the greatest materialists of all.’ The observationsof Kübler-Ross, Moody and others make us aware that when we study accounts oflife after death, we should continually remind ourselves of the ‘language gap’,the problem of trying to translate new perceptions into words that were evolvedwith a narrower purpose in mind. Our concepts of reality are closely bound upwith language, and most accounts of life after death seem to agree that languagehas become unnecessary.The effect of Moody’s book was to virtually create a new academic industry: thestudy of near-death experiences (quickly abbreviated to NDEs.) Kenneth Ring, aprofessor of psychology at the University of Connecticut, attempted a far moresystematic survey than Moody had aimed for. He noted that Moody made no claim topresent scientific evidence about the experience of dying, much less of lifeafter death; in 1977, the year Life After Life appeared, Ring set out to remedythis shortcoming by tracking down and interviewing scores of people who had comeclose to death, and studying the results statistically. In all importantrespects, Ring’s findings confirmed Moody’s. So did those of other researchers:Michael Sabom, Edith Fiore, Maurice Rawlings, Margot Grey. Edith Fiore (in YouHave Been Here Before) summarised accounts of more than a thousand near-deathexperiences. To read some of these books often gives the bewildering impressionof reading the same thing over and over again. But at least the sheer repetitiondrives home the fact that Moody’s cases were not a random sample, selectedbecause they satisfied his own emotional preferences. Again and again there arethe same descriptions of finding oneself in a state of ‘disembodiment’, ofpassing through some kind of tunnel with a light at the end, of a sense ofcommunication with some benevolent being or beings, of some kind of ‘review’, ofan experience of some border between life and death, and of a return to life.(Moody calls this ‘the core experience’.)It has been repeatedly pointed out that all this ‘proves’ nothing. James Alcockexpressed the basic objection in The Skeptical Enquirer:*I have no argument with people’s theology or philosophy. What is bothersome,however, is the necessity these people feel to try to provide ‘objective’evidence to support their beliefs, and their attempts to fool the layman withtheir claims of scientific rigour and exactitude. Survival research is based onbelief in search of data rather than observation in search of explanation. It isan expression of individual and collective anxiety about death.This is a perfectly fair objection, but it also seems to overlook the fact thatscience is based upon repeated observation. To ignore something that is repeatedby thousands of observers would be a contradiction of the scientific attitude.Kübler-Ross, Moody, Ring and others are the first to admit that theirobservations of NDEs prove absolutely nothing about life after death. And sincethese researchers are not concerned with other evidence of ‘survival’ — the kindof evidence we have been surveying in this book — they make no attempt to arguea logical case for life after death. But in the concluding chapter of his ownbook, Ring has the courage to ‘remove my white lab coat and describe my ownbeliefs — for what they may be worth’. And after emphasising that near-deathexperiences prove nothing about survival, he goes on:I do believe — but not just on the basis of my own or others’ data regardingnear-death experiences — that we continue to have a conscious existence afterour physical death and that the core experience does represent its beginning, aglimpse of things to come.He goes on:My own understanding of these near-death experiences leads me to regard them as‘teachings’. They are, it seems to me, revelatory experiences … Theseexperiences clearly imply that there is something more, something beyond thephysical world of the senses … Anyone who makes the effort to inform himself ofthe nature and consequences of genuine mystical or religious experiences willsoon become convinced that the core experience is itself a member of this largerfamily.Why do such experiences occur?… I have one speculative answer to offer, althoughI admit it may sound not only fanciful but downright playful. I have come tobelieve that the universe … has many ways of ‘getting its message across’. In asense, it wants us to ‘wake-up’, to become aware of the cosmic dimensions of thedrama of which we are all a part. Near-death experiences represent one of itsdevices for waking us up to this higher reality.Ring’s point may be underlined by quoting a passage from a book on recentresearch into the ‘mystical experience’, Nona Coxhead’s The Relevance of Bliss.She cites the case of a psychotherapist, Wendy Rose-Neill, whose experience tookplace when she was tending her garden on an autumn day:on this particular day I felt in a very contemplative frame of mind. I rememberthat I gradually became intensely aware of my surroundings — the sound of thebirds singing, the rustling of leaves, the breeze on my skin and the scent ofthe grass and flowers.I had a sudden impulse to lie face down on the grass and as I did so an energyseemed to flow through me as if I had become part of the earth underneath me.The boundary between my physical self and my surroundings seemed to dissolve andmy feeling of separation vanished. In a strange way I felt I blended into atotal unity with the earth, as if I were made of it and it of me. I was aware ofthe blades of grass between my fingers and touching my face, and I wasoverwhelmed by a force which seemed to penetrate every fibre of my being.I felt as if I had suddenly come alive for the first time — as if I wereawakened from a long deep sleep into a real world. I remember feeling that aveil had been lifted from my eyes and everything came into focus … I realisedthat I was surrounded by an incredible loving energy, and that everything, bothliving and non-living, is bound inextricably with a kind of consciousness whichI cannot describe in words.Although the experience could not have lasted for more than a few minutes, itseemed endless — as if I were in some kind of suspended eternal state ofunderstanding …Here phrase after phrase echoes what Ring has said of the near-death experience— the feeling of waking up for the first time, the sense of unity with the earthand the universe, the ‘loving energy’, the impression that time had beensuspended.We can see that what is being discussed is, to some extent, ‘right-brainexperience’. Our left-brain obsession with the present and with survival keepsus trapped in the world of trivial immediacy. It is as though we were surroundedby a thin wall of soundproof glass. As we relax ‘into the right brain’, theglass walls slide silently back, and we suddenly experience contact with thereal world. The everyday sense of urgency, of being in a hurry, suddenlydisappears; the clock stops ticking frantically, and there is a floatingsensation of timelessness.There is another important point to note. In ordinary consciousness, we areaware of ourselves as spectators of the world around us, as if watching it onfilm. In these right-brain experiences, there is still a ‘spectator’, but wecease to identify with him. There is a feeling that the ‘spectator’ is not‘you’. The ‘deeper you’ feels relaxed and totally alive. So there is an oddsense of being two people at once — or, as Ray Bryant said of his hypnoticregression experiences, of watching a television programme and taking part in itat the same time.But the central recognition in these experiences is that they are somehow more‘real’ than ordinary experience. We are, in fact, observing the world withsomething more like our ‘whole being’, instead of just a small part of it. So totry to dismiss mystical experience as somehow ‘one-sided’, as Bertrand Russelldoes in Mysticism and Logic, is scientifically inaccurate. Psychologicallyspeaking, right-brain experience is more ‘complete’ than left-brain experience,for it also involves the left. What the poet sees in his ‘moments of vision’ is,in the most precise and scientific sense, ‘truer’ than what he sees when he isrunning for a bus or having a shave — just as seeing with both eyes is ‘truer’than seeing with only one.But this involves the corollary that the insight of the ‘core experience’ isalso ‘truer’ — closer to reality — than the world of our ordinary perceptions.In criticising near-death studies, James Alcock implies that they are based onvague wishful thinking. The testimony of those who have experienced the NDEcontradicts this; they insist that the experience is nothing like a dream: thatit is more real than everyday experience. It is, of course, still possible toargue that NDEs are some kind of illusion or trick of the brain. But if they aretaken in conjunction with the other evidence for ‘survival’, it seems morelikely that they are genuine glimpses of a type of consciousness that isindependent of the body.Margot Grey, the founder of the International Association for Near-Death Studiesin Great Britain, makes a clear connection between near-death experiences andmystical insight in a passage she contributes to The Relevance of Bliss. Shedescribes how her own interest in near-death experiences began with a personalinsight in 1976. In India, she was struck down by a fever that lasted threeweeks, and she hovered on the brink of death.At some point during the process of passing in and out of consciousness I becameaware that if I somehow urged myself, I could rise up out of my body and remainin a state of levitation up against the ceiling in a corner of the room.At the time this seemed entirely natural and felt very pleasant and extremelyfreeing. I remember looking at my body lying on the bed and feeling completelyunperturbed by the fact that it seemed likely that I was going to die in astrange country … but thinking that it was totally unimportant where I left mybody, which I felt had served me well and like a favourite worn out coat had atlast outlived its usefulness and would now have to be discarded.She describes a sense of floating in total darkness, and a sense of being ‘atone’ with infinite space:Later on, I seemed to be travelling down an endless tunnel; I could see apin-point of light at the end of the tunnel towards which I seemed to bemoving … I remember knowing with absolute certainty that I would eventually bethrough the tunnel and would emerge into the light, which was like the light ofa very bright star, but much more brilliant. A sense of exaltation wasaccompanied by a feeling of being very close to the ‘source’ of life and love,which seemed to be one.The result of this experience was a ‘mental rebirth’. ‘My mental energies seemedextended and refined by a new consciousness and I determined to study thephenomena that I had experienced, in order to try to discover what other peopleexperienced when apparently on the threshold of death.’ The work of Ring andMoody was available to her, and she began her own research into the near-deathexperience in England. And when Ring read the typescript of her book Return fromDeath, he felt much as Elizabeth Kübler-Ross felt on reading Moody’s Life AfterLife: that, without realising it, they had been writing the same book.* And theyhad arrived independently at the same conclusion: that the real importance ofthe near-death experience is its after-effect on those who have been through it.And in her conclusion to her book, Margot Grey writes:A mystical vision of the nature of the universe ultimately seems to offer us thebest basis for an understanding of NDEs. However, it is generally accepted bythose who subscribe to this view that it will take a while before people beginto feel comfortable with an order of reality other than the world ofappearances. In the final analysis, science would seem to be converging with, orat least not conflicting with, what mystics have asserted for millennia whenthey have stated that access to spiritual reality only becomes possible whenconsciousness is freed from its dependence on the body. So long as one remainstied to the body and its sensory perceprions, spiritual reality can at bestnever be more than an intellectual construct. For it is only when one approachesthe realm beyond death that one can experience it directly.It would be a mistake to assume that what Margot Grey is saying is that we wouldall be better off dead. The last part of her book makes it clear that she feelsthe real importance of the NDE to be its effect on the lives of those who havebeen through it. Madame Blavatsky once said that although our earth-realism isthe ‘solidest’ and most difficult of all the worlds, it also offers us the mostopportunity. This again is a thread that runs throughout world mysticism: thenotion that physical life on earth is not some kind of purgatory, to bepatiently endured until we can escape to a higher realm, but some kind of uniqueopportunity. The main problem of human beings is that‘confinement-in-the-present’ keeps us in a state allied to sleep or hypnosis, inwhich we accomplish nothing whatever because we have no idea of what we ought tobe doing. The mystical experience and the ‘core experience’ both seem to bring aflash of insight into ‘what it is all about’. This is the insight that emergesclearly from all the writers on the near-death experience, and which Margot Greystates with more emphasis than most.It could be said, then, that the study of the near-death experience is the mostimportant breakthrough in psychical research since the foundation of the Societyfor Psychical Research more than a century ago. To the objection that the NDEhas nothing to do with psychical research, we can only reply that it seems tohave a great deal to do with it. The SPR originated in a starlit walk duringwhich Myers asked Sidgwick:whether he thought that when Tradition, Intuition, Metaphysic had failed tosolve the riddle of the Universe, there was still a chance that from anyobservable phenomena — ghosts, spirits, whatsoever there might be — some validknowledge might be drawn as to a World Unseen.With admirable perseverence, the SPR compiled dossiers on hallucinations,phantasms of the living, apparitions of the dead, out-of-the-body experiences,precognitions and seance phenomena. Sceptics such as Hyslop, Lodge, Barrett andConan Doyle slowly became converted to the belief in ‘survival’. Yet there wasnever a case that was so overwhelmingly convincing that it could be used toconfound the sceptics. The apparition of Samuel Bull* seems to be as wellattested as a case can be — except that it was all over just before the SPRarrived on the scene. The Cross Correspondences is a watertight case forsurvival — but is so long and complicated that no sceptic would waste his timeon it. Drayton Thomas’s Life Beyond Death will convince any unprejudiced readerthat his father and sister communicated with him after death; but thedescriptions of ‘the world beyond’ remain an embarrassing stumbling block. So asfar as solving ‘the riddle of the Universe’ was concerned, the SPR was afailure. It provided mountains of data, but no inspiration.The study of near-death experiences changed all that. From the scientific pointof view it may be irrelevant that Life after Life became a bestseller. Yet itmeant that one form of psychical research had made the kind of wide generalimpact the founders of the SPR had dreamed about. Moreover, NDEs are not ararity, like poltergeist phenomena, nor a specialised subject that can only bestudied under ‘test conditions’. Most people probably have half a dozenacquaintances who have had near-death experiences and can verify some aspect ofthe ‘core experience’. On the day I began writing this book, I bumped into thewife of a friend on my afternoon walk, and mentioned that I was writing aboutlife after death; she immediately told me about her own near-death experience,which might have come straight out of Moody. In the middle of the night, feelingvery ill with a serious internal complaint, she went downstairs and sat in anarmchair feeling sick and exhausted. Her temperature rose, and she feltconsciousness slipping away. Then she found herself being sucked into a longtunnel with a light at the end. She experienced a sense of total relaxation andpeace, and all her fear of death vanished. Totally reconciled to the idea ofdying, it suddenly struck her that her husband and son would find her body inthe chair the next morning; she made an effort to return to her body, and thenfound herself back in the chair, with her temperature normal again. Theexperience convinced her that she need never be afraid of death, and sheremarked that it had given her the courage to live as well as to die. Anotherlocal resident described how, after a serious heart attack, he had left hisbody, and found the room full of a blinding light. A voice asked him: ‘Do youwant to live?’, and when he replied yes, he opened his eyes to find his mother —convinced he was dead — by his bedside. Elsewhere,* I have described my ownmother’s near-death experience when in hospital suffering from peritonitis. Shealso entered a state of relaxation and happiness about the prospect of death,then thought that a man dressed in white ‘like a biblical character’ stood bythe side of her bed and read to her from a scroll. He ended by telling her thatshe could not die yet because she was ‘needed here’. (This proved to be correct;she had to nurse my father through years of cancer.) She insisted that theexperience was not at all dream-like.Does the evidence of the near-death experience provide that ‘valid knowledge ofthe World Unseen’ that Myers and Sidgwick hoped to uncover? Regrettably, no. Itis personally convincing; it brings the individual an overwhelming sense ofinsight into the riddle of the Universe. But as evidence of life after death itis worthless. It is true that thousands of people, of all nationalities and allreligious affiliations, have testified to the reality of the ‘core experience’.But it could still be some defence mechanism of the brain when confrontingdeath, perhaps the release of an enkephalin, one of the brain’s naturalanaesthetics …Now as we have noted, this also happens to be one of the most basic objectionsto the whole idea of survival. The sceptics have always insisted that it ismerely a defence against our fear of the unknown. This was fully recognised bythe original members of the SPR. When they could safely dismiss the idea offraud or faulty observation, they asked whether the phenomena could be explainedin terms of telepathy or clairvoyance or the activities of the ‘subliminalmind’. Thomson Jay Hudson explained practically all paranormal phenomena as theactivities of the subliminal mind. We have seen that, in fact, there have been anumber of cases — the Cross Correspondences, the Chaffin will case, the redscratch case, the red pyjamas case, the Drayton Thomas case, and perhaps a dozenothers — where most of these explanations can be ruled out. And these are backedby literally thousands of cases that, while not ‘watertight’, still stronglysuggest the persistence of the personality beyond death. Anyone who is willingto consider this evidence without bias — even if he finds it ‘logically’unacceptable — is bound to admit that it points towards the reality of‘survival’.If we can accept this kind of evidence, then there seems to be no sound reasonfor rejecting the evidence of the near-death experience, for the two seem topoint towards the same conclusion: that the physical body is inhabited byanother kind of body that can survive death. The near-death experience provesnothing in itself, but when backed up by the testimony of psychical research, itbecomes strong supportive evidence.It is important to make this distinction between primary and supportiveevidence; the failure to grasp it has led to much of the hostility to psychicalresearch. When Swedenborg gave the queen of Sweden a message from her deadbrother, or when he told the wife of the Dutch ambassador about the secretdrawer with the receipt, this was primary evidence — evidence that he was notmerely a religious crank suffering from delusions. Swedenborg would insist thathis writings on the scriptures are strong supportive evidence of his ‘spiritualinsight’, but the rest of us may not agree. We can reject his scriptualdiscourses without rejecting belief in his psychic powers. We may go furtherand, like Wilson Van Dusen, believe that his insight into the realm of ‘spirits’was valid. Or we may, like Steiner, feel that although he possessed genuinemediumistic powers, he somehow imposed his own rigid scientific outlook on his‘spiritual perceptions’ and falsified them by dragging them down to a materiallevel: a version of what Whitehead calls ‘the fallacy of misplacedconcreteness’. In short, we do not have to accept Swedenborg lock, stock andbarrel. The sensible thing is to accept the ‘primary evidence’, and then decidethrough commonsense how much of the supportive evidence is acceptable.Myers’s Human Personality is an attempt to present primary evidence for variousparanormal faculties. The Cross Correspondences provide some evidence that Myerssurvived death, but we may or may not feel that this supports the arguments ofHuman Personality. And if we decide that the Cross Correspondences are primaryevidence for survival, we may still feel that the ‘Myers’ of the GeraldineCummins scripts is an impostor, or a manifestation of her unconscious mind.Again, we decide how much supportive evidence we can accept. A convincedSpiritualist will be able to swallow it all, including Raymond Lodge’s heavenlylaboratories for making whisky and cigars. We are under no compulsion to do so.But if we are open minded, we shall agree that the sheer mass of primaryevidence makes it unlikely that this is all wishful thinking. This amounts tothe kind of evidence scientists demand when investigating the laws of nature.Like the evidence they try to gather in the laboratory or the observatory, ittends to form a basic pattern. The next task is to study that pattern, and thenlook carefully at the vast piles of supporting evidence, and decide how much ofit fits the jigsaw puzzle. This is a question of personal choice; you can acceptor reject as you feel inclined. But those who reject the primary evidence laythemselves open to a charge of wilful blindness or intellectual laziness.What are the basic elements of this overall pattern?The fundamental assumption is that the human being is not some kind of complexrobot or computer, who works entirely on impulses that flow from theenvironment. In The Selfish Gene, the biologist Richard Dawkins explains how hethinks life began. First, the action of sunlight on various gases created thebasic building blocks of life, the amino acids. The result was a ‘primevalsoup’. This soup was, of course, ‘dead’. Then, at a certain point, ordinarychemical — and physical — reactions produced a ‘particularly remarkablemolecule’, the replicator molecule, which could reproduce itself. He agrees thatthis is an unlikely accident to happen — as unlikely as a man winning the firstprize on the football pools. But if a man lived for millions of years, he wouldprobably win several first prizes. So says Dawkins, the replicator molecule cameinto existence. The world finally became full of identical copies. But thecopying process is not perfect; mistakes will happen. As a result, somereplicators become less stable than others, and less fecund. Some become morestable and more fecund …At which point, Dawkins asks: ‘Shall we call the original replicator molecules“living?” Who cares?…’ And here he seems to be attempting some sleight of hand.The hypothesis of replicator molecules being formed by accident seems dubiousenough — as likely as the works of Shakespeare being written by Eddington’smonkeys strumming aimlessly on a typewriter. But to then suggest that theseself-copiers would be somehow ‘alive’, and therefore capable of evolution, seemsan attempt to play fast and loose with language.My own deep and intuitive conviction is that there is a basic difference betweenliving and dead matter. So computer experts may try forever to convince me thatwe might one day build a computer so complex that it would be literally alive,and I shall remain a sceptic. They may as soon convince me that I am not reallyalive.What I might be willing to accept is that the basic building blocks of organicmatter were created by chance — by the action of sunlight or electricaldischarges on ammonia and carbons — and that, when half the work had been done,the force we call life took advantage of the situation to somehow ‘insert’itself into matter. This seems to agree with my own intuitions about the natureof life, which — in my own case — is a continual struggle of the ‘alive’ part ofme to widen the boundaries of the dead or mechanical part, which seemsdetermined to entrap me in the ‘here and now’.Now if this view is correct, and Dawkins is wrong to believe that life is a mereproduct of matter, it would also seem to follow that life has its ownindependent consciousness and sense of purpose. In the 1860s, a philosophernamed Edouard von Harmann wrote a vast work, The Philosophy of the Unconscious,largely devoted to examining the amazing manifestations of instinct in nature —all, apparently, so full of purpose, all totally unconscious. He reached thegloomy conclusion that life is full of blind striving towards nothing inparticular. But he might just as well have argued that all this blind strivingdoes not begin in a state of blindness. A man who has to walk a mile in the darkwithout a light is not necessarily lost and aimless. He may have consulted a mapbefore he set out, and know exactly how many yards will bring him to the nextcrossroads. The incredible complexity in nature, from the amoeba to giant squid,seems to suggest that although life is ‘blinded’ once it descends into matter,it may have had a very clear sense of direction before it set out for its walkin the dark.The same argument would apply to Darwin’s picture of evolution by naturalselection. Darwin, unlike Dawkins, admits that ‘life’ somehow exists apart frommatter, but he still sees life as a helpless and passive spectator of thechanges brought about by accident and the survival of the fittest. The primitivegiraffe may wish it had a longer neck, but it can do nothing about it; millenniawill have to pass before its descendente will acquire a longer neck by purechance. If Dawkins is wrong, the chances are that Darwin was also wrong. Lifemay not be able to initiate the changes (although even that is not certain), butit may be able to take instant advantage of every accidental change to achieveits own purposes, like a man selecting chunks of stone from a landslide to buildhis own house. But if he can select stones from a landslide, there seems nological reason why he should not also be able to make his own bricks. If thestudy of the paranormal has taught us anything, it is that human powers oftenseem to be able to defy the ‘laws of nature’. For example, in 1899, a NewZealand magistrate named Colonel Gudgeon went with a group of friends to watch aMaori tribe perform a fire-walking ceremony. They were embarrassed when a shamanheld out his hand and invited Gudgeon and his friends to join them. ‘I confer mymana on you.’ To his surprise, Gudgeon felt no burning heat — just a pleasant,tingling sensation — and none of them were even blistered. Clearly, it was someform of mind over matter — a form that should be impossible according to theDarwin-Dawkins view of evolution.The ‘paranormal’ view, then, presupposes that ‘life’ (whatever that means) canexist apart from matter, and possesses its own consciousness and sense ofpurpose. In that case, we may assume that when life separates from matter at‘death’, it returns to a different state of consciousness, involving a higherdegree of freedom. In that case, why did it descend into matter in the firstplace? Presumably to bring the realm of matter under its control — as it mayalready have brought other realms of ‘finer’ matter — matter whose rate ofvibration is higher than ours — under its control.This view — that ‘life’ is attempting to establish control over matter — isknown as ‘vitalism’, and its two leading exponents in the twentieth century havebeen the philosopher Henri Bergson and the biologist Hans Driesch. It issignificant that both Driesch and Bergson joined the Society for PsychicalResearch and became its presidents. In his presidential address in 1926, Drieschexpressed the basic idea of vitalism: that the development of organisms is‘directed by a unifying non-material mind-like Something … an ordering principlewhich does not add either energy or matter’ to what goes on. This principlemight exist outside time and space.* Driesch was violently attacked by hisscientific colleagues for his interest in psychical research — as though itdisplayed a foolish credulity. Yet it can be seen that, if the primary evidencefor ‘survival’ can be accepted, then it is a very short step from vitalism to‘spiritualism’. Their premises are identical.The problem for Driesch — and for every other psychical researcher in the pastcentury — is that even sound philosophical premises cannot make ‘the paranormal’respectable. They might succeed if paranormal research confined itself toinvestigating the unexplored regions of the human mind — clairvoyance,psychokinesis, telepathy, psychometry, and so on. But it is practicallyimpossible to do this. The moment the investigator raises the question ofwhether a medium is genuine, he is raising the question of whether thecommunications come from the ‘dead’. He may decide that mediumship is reallyanother name for multiple personality, and that the ‘communications’ are basedon telepathy or clairvoyance; but if he is honest he will admit that there arecases where neither of these hypotheses cover the facts. And to admit thepossibility of survival is also to admit the possibility of ‘spirits’. At thatpoint, most modern investigators dig in their heels; they feel as if they arebeing dragged back into the superstitions of the Dark Ages.This was the problem we encountered at the beginning of this book. Adam Crabtreeis a psychiatrist; his job is to cure people with psychological problems. Fromhis personal point of view, it makes no difference whatever whether the problemis due to Freudian repressions, multiple personality or ‘diabolical possession’.But from the point of view of his standing in the scientific community, it wouldcertainly be preferable to dismiss the last hypothesis and to think in terms oforthodox psychotherapy. This corresponded with his own inclination. He hasdescribed how, when he was a theology student in Minnesota, he came across apamphlet called Begone Satan by the Rev. Carl Vogel, describing a case thatoccurred in Wisconsin in the 1920s. A girl named Anna Ecklund began to beplagued with desires to commit ‘unspeakable sexual acts’ and to blaspheme. Whenshe began to show classic signs of ‘possession’, Father Theophilus Riesinger, aCapuchin from the community of St Anthony, decided on exorcism. Anna was laid ona bed, and the ceremony of exorcism began. Within moments, Anna’s body had flownoff the bed, and landed against the wall above the door, where she stuck. Shewas dragged down by main force and the exorcism continued. Her howls and screamswere so loud that people came from all over the town of Marathon to see what washappening. The exorcism continued the next day and for many days after. Voicesspeaking in many languages issued from Anna, although her lips remained tightlyclosed. Her head would expand ‘to the size of a water pitcher’ and her bodyswelled like a balloon. Her convulsions were so powerful that the iron bedsteadbent to the floor. Various entities who announced themselves as demons spoke tothe exorcists, and showed intimate knowledge of sins they had committed inchildhood. Finally, Anna’s deceased father was ‘summoned’, and admitted that hehad constantly tried to commit incest with her, and that because she hadresisted him, he had cursed her and invoked devils to possess her. The father’sex-mistress also appeared, and admitting to killing a number of her newly bornchildren. During all this time, Anna was deeply asleep, or in trance. Finally,Anna’s body shot up off the bed, so that only her heels were resting on it, andas the priest repeated the exorcism, there was the sound of a strange scream,that gradually faded into the distance. Then the girl’s eyes opened and shebegan to cry. The ‘possession’ was over.The monk who had translated the pamphlet from the German was in the samemonastery as Crabtree, and he verified the details of the story. Crabtree knewhim to be a level-headed, good-humoured man; yet he still found the monk’s storypreposterous.In due course, Crabtree decided that the monastic life was not for him, andentered psychotherapy in 1969:As a psychotherapist, I fairly quickly came to accept the reality of the lessspectacular paranormal phenomena, specifically telepathic and clairvoyantexperiences. These seemed to be undeniable from the extensive evidence myclients spontaneously provided from their intuitions and particularly from theirdreams. But in those early years I was extremely reluctant to go beyond thisminimal acceptance.*It was not until 1976 that a colleague spoke to him of a patient who seemed tobe ‘possessed’ by a spirit, and Crabtree was able to witness this phenomenon. Hestill declined to take it seriously. But in the following year, he began toencounter cases of the ‘possession type’ in his own practice — as described inthe first chapter of this book — and decided, from the purely pragmatic point ofview, to treat them as possession.Crabtree insists that, as a psychotherapist, he remains a phenomenologist: thatis to say, he does not say: This is possession, but: This patient shows all thesigns of ‘possession’, and treating it as possession will probably be thesimplest way to affect a cure. But he is a member of the Society for PsychicalResearch, and his book makes it clear that he is willing to give seriousconsideration to the ‘possession’ hypothesis.Another psychotherapist, Dr Ralph Allison, who practises in Santa Cruz,California, has written a book on multiple personality** which makes it clearthat he has come to accept the real possibility of ‘possession’. In 1972,Allison encountered a case of multiple personality. In her teens, Carrie hadbeen the victim of a gang rape, and it was after this that she began toexperience black-outs in which another personality took over. Also in her teens,Carrie had been involved in amateur witchcraft, and simply as a therapeuticmeasure, Allison tried ‘exorcism’ under hypnosis. It worked, but Allisonconsidered that this had simply been due to suggestion. But in subsequent years,Allison encountered cases of multiple personality in which he could not acceptthat the ‘other selves’ were genuine alter-egos. ‘An alter personality serves adefinite and practical purpose — it is a means of coping with an emotion or asituation that the patient cannot handle.’ But in some cases, this did notappear to be so. He placed a girl called Elise, who was suffering from multiplepersonality, under hypnosis, and a male alter-ego who called himself Dennisemerged. ‘Dennis’ seemed to serve no purpose. And he insisted that he was‘possessing’ Elise solely because he was sexually interested in another of herpersonalities, a girl called Shannon, who had ‘taken over’ after Elise had beenprostrated by the loss of a baby. When he asked ‘Dennis’ how he hoped to havesex with ‘Shannon’, ‘Dennis’ explained that he entered the bodies of men‘Shannon’ went to bed with, and so enjoyed making love to her. Allison foundthis an interesting concept: obviously, Elise’s body was the same as ‘Shannon’‘s; but ‘Dennis’ was not in the least interested in it when Elise was ‘in’ it.When Allison questioned ‘Shannon’, she confirmed all that ‘Dennis’ had said.Allison was baffled at the idea of an alter-ego entering someone else’s body(although if he had read Kardec or any other number of spiritualists he wouldhave found it familiar enough). But Elise’s other personalities also insistedthis was so. ‘Dennis’ himself claimed that he had once been a stockbroker, whowas killed during a robbery. He claimed that Elise was not the first person hehad ‘inhabited’. He also explained that if ‘Shannon’ would settle down with onelover, he would be glad to enter the man permanently. But she ‘moved around’ toomuch. Allison admits: ‘Despite all my efforts, I was unable to find a moreplausible explanation for his existence than the spirit theory.’Under hypnosis, another alter-ego emerged, a girl called Michelle who insistedthat, like ‘Dennis’, she was not a sub-personality but a spirit. She alsoclaimed there was a third ‘spirit’ involved. A few days later, after Elise hadexperienced some violent convulsions, one of the sub-personalities told Allisonthat the three ‘possessing spirits’ had now left. Allison was inclined to acceptthis. ‘Nothing in the psychological literature could account for what I hadseen.’ Some time later, another of the sub-personalities told Allison that‘Shannon’ was herself a ‘possessing spirit’ — the spirit of Elise’s dead baby.‘Shannon’ herself confirmed this, and told Allison she was willing to ‘leave’.Elise woke from the session with amnesia; but ‘Shannon’ never reappeared.Dealing with another case of multiple personality, a girl called Sophia, Allisonsucceeded in fusing most of her alter-egos under hypnosis. But twosub-personalities remained: two women called Mary and Maria. When Sophia wasunder hypnosis, Allison was told that Mary and Maria were her twin sisters. Thedoctor who had delivered the triplets was also her mother’s lover, and hesmothered the first two babies; however, a visit from a neighbour prevented himfrom killing Sophia. Sophia said that ‘spirits’ of all three babies had beenwaiting to enter them after each one was delivered. Concerned that the other twomight be lonely, Sophia had invited them to share her body with her. Eventually,Allison succeeded in persuading ‘Mary’ and ‘Maria’ to leave during a hypnoticsession. After this, his attempts to re-invoke them under hypnosis were afailure.Allison’s stories sound preposterous — yet to anyone who has read the rest ofthis book, they have the ring of authenticity. The underlying theme that has runthrough psychical investigation since the days of Jung-Stilling and CatherineCrowe has been the notion that human beings consist of bodies inhabited byspirits — personalities already formed, so to speak — and that these spiritssurvive death. In some cases in Chapter Six, we have encountered instances inwhich a spirit has apparently moved from one body to another, so Lurancy Vennumbecame Mary Roff, and Sobha Ram became Jasbir Lal Jat. We may decide that suchcases do not constitute proof of reincarnation and ‘possession’. But at least wehave to recognise the consistency of the underlying theme: that personality isnot a mere reflection of the body, a ‘summation of the different contributionsto behaviour from the various control units of the brain’, but an independententity which controls the body — and which might be capable of far greatercontrol if it was fully aware of its own status.This recognition encapsulates the aim of the present book. It is not my purposeto try to convince anyone of the reality of life after death: only to drawattention to the impressive inner consistency of the evidence, and to point outthat, in the light of that evidence, no one need feel ashamed of accepting thenotion that human personality survives bodily death.*Charles Higham: The Adventures of Conan Doyle, p. 261.*See p. 128.*Post Mortem Journal.*See p. 127.*The Romeo Error, p. 63.*Spring 1979.

D. Broad for acolour supplement article. Broad, a kindly and modest soul, was rather irritatedat the time because his college — Trinity — had just made him kitchen steward,at the age of eighty, and he was looking forward impatiently to completing hispresent duties and getting back to his beloved Scandinavia.After talking about his philosophical ideas and his views on the youngergeneration, we turned to psychical research; Broad had joined the Society forPsychical Research in 1920, and had twice been its president. He made theinteresting comment: ‘If these facts of psychical research are true, thenclearly they are of immense importance — they literally alter everything.’ Ireminded him that, in his autobiography,* he had remarked: ‘So far as I cantell, I have no desire to survive the death of my present body, and I should beconsiderably relieved if I could feel much surer than I do that no kind ofsurvival is possible.’ But Broad insisted there was no contradiction here:I’ve been terribly lucky in this life; everything has gone very well. I’veachieved all the success I could probably want — probably far more than Ideserve — so I don’t like the idea of taking a chance in another world. I’drather just come to an end.Broad was underlining a point that we have touched on repeatedly in this book.To know there was life after death would certainly ‘alter everything’. Yet inanother sense, it would alter nothing. A baby opens its eyes on a complex,baffling and rather frightening universe. But it soon develops the convictionthat the grown-ups know all the answers. It is rather disconcerting to achieveadulthood and realise that this is not true. Kierkegaard wrote:Where am I? Who am I? How did I come to be here? What is this thing called theworld?… How did I come into the world? Why was I not consulted?… And if I amcompelled to take part in it, where is the manager? I would like to see him.To say: ‘Don’t worry — there is life after death’ is no answer. It is true thatif death was the end of the individual, it would deepen that sense ofpointlessness and futility. But to be told that we shall go on living in anotherworld leaves us facing the same question. William James expressed it: Why isthere existence rather than non-existence? To answer that question, we wouldpresumably need to get ‘outside’ existence; and that seems clearly impossible.This explains why spiritualism has not made a greater impact on the modernworld. When it was launched in Rochester in 1850, its followers had no doubtthey were helping to found a new religion. But a religion is an attempt toexplain man’s place in the universe. Spiritualism was not based on some mysticalinsight about the relation of man to God; it was based on the assertion thatdead human beings are not really dead at all, but continue to live in a worldnot unlike the present one. And that leaves the question about man’s place inthe universe precisely where it was before. No wonder Roman Catholic theologiansjoined with agnostic scientists in denouncing it as boring, shallow andirrelevant.I was forcefully reminded of these objections a few months before I began towrite this book. A correspondent told me that he had just learned of theexistence of one of the most remarkable mediums of all time. I shall refer toher as Martha. She was, said my correspondent, a ‘materialisation medium’, andduring her seances, perfectly solid people would appear out of thin air and walkabout the room. They would behave exactly like normal people, replying toquestions, allowing themselves to be touched and sitting down at the side ofmembers of the audience. In short, there was no mystification; it was all asstraightforward as a tea party.I immediately wrote to Martha, explained that I was about to write a book onlife after death, and asked if I could come to one of her seances; I received afriendly reply saying that I was welcome at any time.Not long after, I happened to be in the provincial town where Martha lived, andI telephoned to ask if I could come to a meeting. She explained that this wasimpossible at the moment, because the friends in whose house the seances tookplace were away on holiday. But she invited me to go to have tea at her home.Martha proved to be a rather pretty woman in her thirties. I was introduced toher husband, Bill, and to her son and his girlfriend. What they told me soundedimpressive. Martha had been an actress, but since she had been married to Bill —an engineer — she had given up the stage. (Her son still worked in the theatreas a lighting engineer.) They had discovered her powers accidentally one daywhen she had become exasperated with a friend with whom she was having anargument. She touched a small table, and it shot across the room. When sheplaced her hands on it, it rocked from side to side. The table answeredquestions by means of the usual code. They all became fascinated by it, andbegan spending their evenings asking questions. (Martha emphasised that she hadpreviously had no interest whatever in such matters — in fact, she was aCatholic.) One day, she fell into a trance, and a ‘spirit’ spoke through hermouth. When she woke up, she apologised for falling asleep, having no memory ofwhat had happened. At later seances, spirits ‘materialised’.A woman with a strong Scots accent, who identified herself as the medium HelenDuncan, soon became Martha’s ‘control’. And one day, a small boy appeared — letus call him Jeremy — and described how he had died a few years before after anaccident. He gave his name and address, and told them that at this very moment,his father was sitting at home alone, because his mother was away for the night.On the ceiling above him, said ‘Jeremy’, there was a red admiral butterfly …It was late at night, but they decided to test ‘Jeremy’ ’s story. They found thetelephone number, and a man’s voice answered. Bill said: ‘Look, I’m going to askyou a silly question — is there a red admiral butterfly on the ceiling in thatroom?’ The man answered with astonishment: ‘My God, so there is! But how did youknow?’ ‘Because your son just told us …’ The father confirmed all that ‘Jeremy’had said about his death. And the next day, both parents arrived, and there weretears of joy as they hugged and kissed their son …It was an impressive story. In fact, I found Martha and Bill altogetherconvincing. They seemed a charming couple, completely natural and down-to-earth,and if their story could be confirmed, then there seemed no doubt whatever thatMartha was the most remarkable medium since Daniel Dunglas Home. I had littledoubt that it would be confirmed, for they assured me that I would not only beable to talk to ‘Jeremy’ and ‘Helen Duncan’, but touch them as well.At the first opportunity, I hurried back to the suburb where Bill and Marthalived. It was still impossible, for some reason, to hold a seance at the home oftheir friends; but they offered to do it in their own sitting room. I wasinvited early for tea — in fact, a large meal with hot sausage rolls and allkinds of cakes and scones — and I was told a great deal more about theircontacts with the ‘other world’. It seemed that Martha was having problems withvarious bloody-minded sceptics, and one of these had accused her of fraud in awell-known spiritualist journal … I found all this surprising; if Martha’sphenomena were half as convincing as they sounded, it was hard to understand whyanyone should want to denounce her.After about two hours, the seance began. Rather to my surprise, Bill and Donald(their son) began covering the windows with sheets of thick black plastic. Theyexplained that even the slightest ray of light could cause harm to the medium.Martha sat in an armchair; I sat on the settee with Donald and his girlfriend;Bill sat opposite Martha. A tape recorder with popular classical music wasswitched on, and the lights were turned off, leaving us all in total darkness.The music, they explained, helped to create the right atmosphere. Soon therewere several loud raps on the table, which, Bill explained, meant there werethirteen spirits present. Then a small boy’s voice sounded, and ‘Jeremy’ wasthere. I was introduced to him, and I asked if he would mind if I recorded hisvoice. He gave permission, and I switched on the recorder I had brought. Then weall went on talking — it was very casual, very normal, like a fireside chat.‘Jeremy’ had a rather high-pitched voice, with something oddly muffled about it,as if he was speaking with some object in his mouth. After a few minutes,‘Jeremy’ asked: ‘Can you hear Laura?’ The music had been switched on again —Placido Domingo singing ‘I wouldn’t be without you’ — so I couldn’t detect thenewcomer. But Bill greeted her, and again I was introduced. ‘Laura’ took my handin both of hers — she felt like a perfectly normal human being. ‘Laura’ alsosang along with the music; she had a pleasant voice, but again with somethingodd about it — I can only describe it as a ‘slight wobble’. At this point, atorch was produced, but it had a red sock over the end, so that it showedpractically nothing, even in that total darkness. But it was held close to‘Laura’s’ bare feet, and I could see them dimly against the rug.Suddenly a voice with a Scottish accent said: ‘Hello there! It’s lovely t’ seeyou all tonight …’, and Bill greeted her: ‘Hello Helen.’ ‘I expect, Colin, thatyou’re gettin’ a bit of a shock?’ She asked Bill to turn down the music, andexplained: ‘We need the music because Martha’s afraid o’ the dark. There’s justenough so her unconscious mind can hear the music.’ She went on to introduceherself to me and welcome me ‘from the bottom o’ my heart’. She’d heard I was aman of many words, and she was a woman of many words …After a few more minutes of this, Bill decided it was time for a break. Themusic was played; then the lights were switched on. There was Martha, sitting inher armchair in her track suit, gradually waking up and asking: ‘Did anythinghappen?’ We assured her it had.After a break of five or ten minutes, the seance began again. There was a greatdeal more chatter from ‘Jeremy’, then ‘Helen’ offered to do an ‘experiment’.This amounted to taking the torch and showing me her feet, then her knees. Onceagain, it was practically impossible to see anything but the faint glow of fleshin the dim red light.‘Helen’ was, as she had said, a woman of many words; she talked a great deal. Iinterrupted her at one point to ask if she recalled a friend of mine, LeonardBoucher, who had attended one of her seances during her lifetime. She said shedid, and asked me what had happened to ‘Len’. I said he was now in Zimbabwe. ‘Ishe?’ said ‘Helen’ with surprise, ‘I thought he was in Rhodesia.’ We had toexplain that they were the same place. She asked me to remind Leonard aboutPortsmouth …After more talk, I asked her if she could tell me anything about the nature ofpoltergeists. ‘I will explain’ said ‘Helen’ magisterially. But she did notexplain. Instead, she told us that poltergeists had never harmed anyone, andthat there was no need to be afraid of them. ‘The living can do you far moreharm than the dead …’ And for the next quarter of an hour or so, she rambled on,saying nothing in particular — certainly nothing about the nature ofpoltergeists. It became clear that she either knew nothing about poltergeists,or preferred to keep it to herself. I was not sorry when Bill announced it wastime for another break. By this time, my tape had run out.Bill had told me that Sir Oliver Lodge’s son Raymond usually appeared at theirseances, so I asked whether I might meet him. In fact, I had already listened toa recording of an earlier seance with ‘Raymond’. Eventually, after moreconversation, ‘Raymond’ arrived, and introduced himself to me. It was at thispoint that my vague doubts began to become insistent. This ‘Raymond’ soundednothing like the voice I had heard on tape. He spoke in rather a slow voice,with an upper-class accent, and a slightly feminine intonation, like EllaShields as ‘Burlington Bertie’.I asked him if it was true that spirits could see in the dark, and he confirmedthis — in fact, told me that when a friend of mine from the Society forPsychical Research had attended one of Martha’s seances, he had astonished himby telling him how many fingers he was holding up. He added that the room hadbeen full of wires at the time, and that the spirits had proved their ability tosee in the dark by avoiding them.This seemed an invitation, so I asked ‘Raymond’ whether he could tell me whatexpression I was wearing on my face at the moment. I pulled a horribly distortedface and thrust out my lips. ‘Raymond’ asked hesitantly: ‘You mean if you’ve gotyour mouth open, or something?’ And quite suddenly, I knew beyond allpossibility of doubt that ‘Raymond’ could not see in the dark. I said yes, thatwas what I meant. ‘Raymond’ replied promptly that ‘he didn’t do that any more’.Why not? I asked, and he explained that it convinced no one. ‘But it wouldconvince me’, I told him. ‘For example, if you could tell me how many fingers Iam now holding up.’ I held up two fingers. ‘We don’t do that any more’, said‘Raymond’ irritably. ‘Why not? Wouldn’t you like to convince me?’ ‘Raymond’explained that if I left the house, and stated in print that ‘Raymond’ had beenable to count my fingers, no one would accept this as proof. They would accuseMartha of using infra-red light or something of the sort. I explained again thatit was not a question of convincing other people, but of convincing me. If hecould tell me how many fingers I was holding up, I would accept that he was aspirit. If not, I wouldn’t.At this, ‘Raymond’ became very waspish. They had already given me all theevidence I should need, he said. They had allowed me to touch the spirits, andto see them by the light of the torch. I pointed out that the torch showednothing that could be regarded as evidence — not even whether Martha was stillsitting in her armchair. And while it was true that someone had taken my handand allowed me to touch her arm, I could certainly not swear that it was notMartha herself …It became very clear that seventy years in the spirit world had not eliminated‘Raymond’ ’s ordinary human characteristics; it was obvious that he was findingit hard to control his temper. They had given me proof, he insisted. That shouldbe enough. And I insisted that he only had to tell me how many fingers I washolding up to remove all my doubts. ‘We don’t do that kind of thing any more …’I noticed that as he became angry, the voice seemed to become more feminine.It seemed pointless to continue, and I said so. The music was played, and thelights turned on. It was a very awkward moment. I was as certain as I couldreasonably be that ‘Raymond’ was a fraud, and it seemed to follow that the wholeseance had been a fake. Martha woke up sleepily and asked what had happened;Bill explained that ‘Raymond’ and I had a disagreement. I thanked them and tookmy leave quickly, anxious to avoid further embarrassment.As soon as I arrived home, I wrote to Leonard Boucher in Zimbabwe, and asked himwhether Helen Duncan had known him as ‘Len’, and whether he had seen her inPortsmouth. His reply, when it came, was much as I expected. They had been onformal terms — no first names. (In any case, I had never heard anyone call himLen; it was always Leonard.) And he had not seen her in Portsmouth but inScotland …The correspondent who had first told me about Martha was furious when I sent himmy report on the seance. He had no doubt whatever that she was genuine, and if Idisagreed, then it must be because I had joined the ranks of the wilfully blind.I explained that I was not certain that Martha was a fraud, but that I was ahundred per cent certain that ‘Raymond’ was. This failed to mollify him. Nothingwould convince him that I had not gone over to the ‘enemy’.The whole episode only served to underline what I had known all along: that‘communications’ with alleged spirits can teach us nothing about the nature ofreality. And the basic task of human beings is to learn about the nature ofreality. Even if ‘Raymond’ had been able to count my fingers and read theexpression on my face — even if he had been able to read my mind — it would havemade no real difference. It would merely have confirmed what I already believeto be true: that such things are possible. But when I listen to the taperecording of that seance, I am seized by an uncontrollable desire to yawn, andby the conviction that ‘spirits’ have nothing to add to the sum total of humanthought: even genuine ones.What, then, do I believe can be learned from the evidence of psychical research?I would suggest that one of its most important insights concerns thepersonality. We all take personality for granted. I am I, and that is all thereis to it. Cases of multiple personality reveal that the truth is infinitely morecomplex. If I allow myself to become completely defeated by life, I may developa subsidiary personality that can cope with its problems. ‘Christine Beauchamp’(Clara Fowler) was timid and fearful, so the cheerful and mischievous ‘Sally’took over. Louis Vivé was passive and apathetic, so a more aggressive andassertive Louis took over. Billy Milligan was about to commit suicide by jumpingoff the school roof when a sub-personality displaced him and took over. Theobvious deduction is that we already contain many potential personalities, all,so to speak, waiting in the wings and ready to be activated. But in normal,healthy people, they blend with the basic personality without disrupting it. Wemeet someone we haven’t seen for two years, and realise that he had become‘another person’, more confident and efficient. We do not feel that he had been‘taken over’ by a stronger personality; only that he has become more himself.Elsewhere* I have even suggested that every human being contains a whole ladderor hierarchy of ‘selves’. At the bottom rung there is the baby who opens hiseyes on a strange world, then the child who begins to develop a mind of his ownat about the age of three, then the first ‘completed’ personality at the age ofseven, then the adolescent who develops new sexual and emotional potentials,then the young adult who integrates all the previous levels. But this is not theend of development. In ‘great men’ we can easily trace the development of newlevels — so that, for example, we speak of the various ‘periods’ of aShakespeare or Beethoven. But we can also see plainly that even the Shakespearesand Beethovens were incomplete human beings; if they had lived longer andcontinued to struggle they might have developed to still higher levels.This explains why we reject the notion that ‘personality’ survives bodily death.We can see that personality grows and develops, like the body, which argues thatit dies, like the body. Yet in cases of multiple personality we can also seethat there is a ‘basic self’ that forms the foundation of the personality.Mystical ecstasy seems to dissolve the personality; some mystics have evencompared this sense of escaping their individuality to a spirit rising out of arotting corpse; yet they still remain fully alive and conscious. If anythingsurvives death, it is this basic substratum of the personality. And, ifreincarnation is a reality, this is also what re-enters the newly born child.Perhaps ‘substratum’ is here the wrong word. In Mysteries I have suggested thatthe ‘ladder’ of selves is not a normal ladder with parallel sides, but somethingmore like an inverted ‘V. The higher we move, the shorter the rungs become, andthe more effort of ‘compression’ we have to make if we are to move up from alower level. (On the other hand, it is easy to fall down a rung, as in nervousbreakdown.) Perhaps the ‘ultimate self’ lies at the top of the latter …I began this book by discussing Adam Crabtree because some of his cases seem toillustrate that this ‘development’ mechanism also seems to leave room for whatused to be called ‘possession’. According to Kardec, ‘spirits’ can wander in andout of us as they feel inclined (and Ralph Allison’s ‘Dennis’ case seems toprovide support for this view). They can, to some extent, influence ourthoughts. But they cannot, under normal circumstances, ‘take control’, or evenexert any real influence on our actions. This sounds, of course, like thegrossest kind of mediaeval superstition. But the evidence of psychical researchsuggests that we should at least accept it as a working hypothesis.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of psychical research is the recognitionthat we seem to possess all kinds of powers of which we are consciously unaware— from telepathy and psychokinesis to astral projection and precognition of thefuture. Yet I believe these powers are less important than we might assume. Allthe major religions have recognised them as a by-product of ‘spiritualdevelopment’. The Hindus say that a yogi who takes the trouble to walk on wateris still in an early stage of development.But the alternative — the striving towards God or Ultimate Reality — strikesmost of us as uninviting or unreal. This may be simply because we are attachingthe wrong meaning to the words. The French psychologist Pierre Janet insistedthat the measure of mental health is a faculty he called ‘the reality function’.He was not speaking about some mystical reality — only about the everydayreality that surrounds us all. Repressions, miseries, guilts — above all,preposterous fears and doubts — prevent us from responding directly andhealthily to this reality. Human beings are the only creatures who spend 90 percent of their time in a dream world inside their own heads. We are toosubjective. Our basic problem is to learn objectivity — to achieve what might becalled ‘objective consciousness’.In fact, objective consciousness is less rare than it sounds. We only have towalk outdoors on a sunny morning to experience a sudden sense that life isdelightful and boundlessly interesting. If we could maintain that sense all thetime the world would become a kind of paradise — no more war, no more crime, nomore meanness and pettiness and resentment. Our problem is that we lose thisinsight so easily. Fatigue lowers our sharpness of perception, and the pettyfears and anxieties come swarming back into our minds like rats from the sewers.Everyone must have noticed that when they subject themselves to physical stress,there comes a point at which the level of misery and anxiety suddenly increasessteeply. (An easy way to test this is to go jogging, or try digging the gardenmuch harder than usual.) All our slightly repressed mistrust of life suddenlycomes welling up from the subconscious. (Not the unconscious: the subconscious —that realm just below the threshold of ordinary consciousness.) The only way tochange this is to deliberately set out to drive the rats from the sewers — tosubject the fears and anxieties to the scrutiny of the conscious mind and thelight of reason. We can ‘re-programme’ the subconscious, so it is no longer ahealth hazard.We are, in fact, approaching the problem of vitalism — discussed in the lastchapter — from a different angle. Vitalism, as we have seen, is the belief that‘life’ is engaged in a struggle to conquer matter by ‘inserting more freedom’into it. So — as T. E. Hulme expressed it — the amoeba could be regarded as atiny ‘leak’ of freedom, fishes are bigger leaks, animals bigger leaks still, andman the biggest leak so far (at least on this planet). Our task, according tovitalism, is to make a deliberate, conscious effort to enlarge the leak.Whether or not we happen to be vitalists, we can all recognise the kernel oftruth in this view. When a man is driving a car at ninety miles an hour, hefeels ‘more alive’. When he gets excited as he watches a football match, hefeels more alive. But these are fairly crude methods of feeling more alive. Whena reader becomes totally absorbed in the fictional world of a novel, when amusic lover is ‘swept away’ by a symphony, they experience a certain internalwidening of consciousness that seems quite different in kind from mere physicalexcitement. The football fan knows that his excitement depends on the game; butthe person who is carried away by imaginative excitement feels that thisexperience is somehow within his own control — that he could conjure it up againby an act of imagination. It seems quite clear to those who have a capacity forintellectual or imaginative excitement that this is the key to the deliberate‘enlargement of the leak’ of freedom.Schopenhauer was one of the first philosophers to think in terms of a ‘lifeforce’; he was followed by Edouard von Hartman, and later by Shaw, Bergson andDriesch. They all thought of ‘life’ as a blind, instinctive force, clumsilygroping its way towards self-expression. But, as we have seen, Bergson andDriesch later changed their minds. This was for two reasons. First: that if suchpowers as telepathy and clairvoyance exist, then the forces of life must havefar greater control over matter than we suppose. This control seems to belimited by our inability to ‘tune in’ to these powers — or our tendency toactually resist them. (Rosalind Heywood’s ‘Orders’ often struck her as absurd,yet obeying them usually turned out well.) Still, the ‘unseen forces’ seem tobehave as if they possessed an intelligent purpose, or as if they were ‘above’ordinary consciousness. Second: if life after death is a reality, then the‘other world’ seems to exist on an altogether less ‘solid’ plane of matter thanour own — perhaps a plane where matter exists at some far higher rate ofvibration. This suggests that ‘life’ has already conquered this plane, and isusing it as a base to make forays into our more difficult and inhospitableterritory. Gurdjieff once said our earth is the cosmic equivalent of OuterSiberia; a better comparison might be a Wild West or Darkest Africa, stillawaiting colonisation and conquest.But, as we have seen, the great problem seems to be that when ‘life’ descendsinto solid matter, it loses its memory. It could be compared to a child who hasbeen sent out on an errand, but who has forgotten his instructions halfway. Forhuman beings, this ‘forgetfulness’ leads to the feeling of being trapped in adreary world of matter, and to Sartre’s conviction that ‘it is meaningless thatwe live and meaningless that we die’.Under the circumstances, it seems quite plain that the basic problem for the‘life force’ is how to prevent us from forgetting our instructions, andwandering back home with nothing accomplished — or, as in the case of a Hitleror Jack the Ripper, leaving the world a great deal worse than we found it.Let us consider this problem as though we were Higher Intelligences — or Angels— sitting up in heaven, looking down on human beings, and wondering how we canfind a permanent solution to this problem of ‘forgetfulness’.The one thing on which we all agree is that the purpose of life is to increaseits power over matter, to ‘enlarge the leak’ of freedom. So the last thing wewant is a race of creatures who feel that life is pointless and futile, and thatthe sooner they can escape from ‘this dim vast vale of tears’, the better.Ideally, we want creatures who feel that life is immensely interesting andexciting, and that no problem need remain permanently insoluble. We wantcreatures with an enormous ‘appetite for reality’.And the trouble with these human beings is that they all start out full of thefeeling that life is going to be marvellous, and that the world is ‘apparelledin celestial light’, and end up bored, disillusioned and defeated. What makes itmore annoying is that they are now so close to achieving their objective. Forhundreds of thousands of years, they have fought grimly against cold andstarvation and predators. Again and again, they have missed extinction only bythe skin of their teeth. Then they began to use their intelligence to makeweapons to hunt their food, and to build weather-proof shelters, and from thenon, life began to improve steadily. They created civilisation, and although thisinvolved two undesirable by-products — war and crime — they refused to bedeterred, and gradually learned to make life more and more worth living. Thenthey took one of their greatest steps forward, and created art and literature —the first steps towards the conquest of the world of the mind. At last, it beganto look as though they were close to achieving their basic purpose — animpregnable bridgehead in the world of matter.Then a new and unexpected problem arose. They began to grow bored with thecivilisation their ancestors had built with so much labour. The trouble, ofcourse, was that it had all happened too quickly. They had spent millions ofyears struggling for survival, and then achieved the security of civilisationovernight. It left them bewildered and confused. Instead of struggling for moreconsciousness, they began to choose the road of least resistance, and to wastetheir lives looking for immediate satisfactions.Now in the remote past, the ‘Higher Intelligences’ had kept in touch with thehuman race through certain individuals who were highly sensitive ‘receivingsets’. These people — called prophets and messiahs — could be shown the purposeof life through mystical revelations, and then they used their enormous powersof persuasion to induce everyone to live as if the purpose of life was to earn apassport to heaven. For thousands of years, this method of preventing humanbeings from ‘forgetting their instructions’ was immensely successful, and thegreat religions kept man working at the central aim of increasing human optimismand intelligence (for that, in the last analysis, is what it amounts to). Butthe development of his intelligence caused man to outgrow his religions. And thecomplexity of civilisation created more and more ‘drop-outs’, people who took itfor granted that life is totally meaningless — a brief sojourn in prison,followed by oblivion. There actually came a point, in the nineteenth century,when the steady increase in human knowledge led man to the conclusion thatmatter is the only reality …It was at this point that a sub-committee of Angels decided to try out the ideaof a more direct form of communication, to convince men that there was a lifeafter death. This experiment started in the 1840s, and in the form of areligious movement known as Spiritualism, it spread across the world.Unfortunately, it tended to attract the wrong type of person — feeble-mindedsentimentalists — and the scientists and philosophers remained aloof. Later,another committee of Angels suggested the increasing use of the near-deathexperience as a ‘teaching method’, and this also achieved some success — but onfar too small a scale to do much good. Moreover, the whole Spiritualist projectwas undermined by the constant interference of mischievous ‘earth-bound spirits’— the criminals, layabouts and juvenile delinquents of the ‘other world’ — whosucceeded in creating widespread confusion. On the whole, the Spiritualistexperiment is not regarded by the Higher Intelligences as one of their moreoutstanding successes.Which, of course, leaves us with the original question: how can human beings beprevented from ‘forgetting their instructions’ and wasting their lives? This, werecognise instinctively, is the central question of human existence, the LifeQuestion. It is this instinctive recognition that explains why the evidence ofspiritualism has made such a surprisingly small impact on the human race. Youwould expect it to be a matter of passionate interest to every human being.Dostoevsky wrote in The Diary of a Writer: ‘There is only a single supreme ideaon earth: the concept of the immortality of the human soul; all other profoundideas by which men live are only an extension of it.’ Yet in the century and ahalf of its existence, spiritualism has made no real progress: it has merelymarked time. This is because we all feel, deep down, that the Death Question isof far less importance than the Life Question.One thing is clear: that this matter of the Life Question is no longer a problemthat concerns only the ‘Higher Intelligences’. For more than a century now,human beings have also been applying their own intelligence to its solution. (Aswe have seen, the Society for Psychical Research began when two philosophersasked whether the evidence for the paranormal might help to solve the ‘riddle ofthe Universe’.) Kierkegaard, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Nietszche, Shaw, Jaspers,Camus and many others have made the Life Question — the ‘Lebensfrage’ — thecentral issue of their work. (Even I have succeeded in making a smallcontribution.)The outline of an answer is slowly beginning to emerge. It is this. Human beingshave no problem maintaining a high degree of purpose when faced with emergenciesor difficulties that threaten their existence. And when this happens, we becomeaware of the actual mechanism of ‘enlarging the leak’ of freedom. Whenever I amfaced with some sudden challenge or danger, its first effect is to undermine myvitality. Adrenalin rushes into my bloodstream, and my confidence drops severalpoints. Then I ‘steel myself’ to meet the problem; I summon energy, anddiscipline myself to face the challenge. And in the moment I overcome thechallenge, I experience a deep satisfaction, and a delightful sense of freedom.I have, in fact, ‘enlarged the leak’. And if I could spend my life facinginteresting challenges, my self-control and my freedom would steadily increase.And, as far as the Higher Intelligences are concerned, I would have done athoroughly satisfactory job of widening the bridgehead.In A Criminal History of Mankind, I speak of that initial response to achallenge — the rush of adrenalin — as ‘Force T’, the ‘T’ standing for tension.The response to that challenge I call Force C — the ‘C’ standing for control.This is the central issue of human existence, the essence of the Life Question —increasing Force C to overcome Force T. That is how we ‘enlarge the leak’. Andthat explains, of course, why our most fundamental human impulse is to seekchallenges. When we lived in caves, or on the great African savannas, theproblem never arose, for we had more than enough challenge to keep us up to themark: this is why man has become the most successful creature on earth. But whenhe began to build cities, he already experienced the problem that was to becomethe greatest obstacle to his progress: ‘challenge-starvation’. He responded toit by inventing war, which made his blood tingle and his heart beat faster. Inthe succeeding six or seven thousand years, man has become the most aggressiveand murderous creature the earth has ever seen — even in comparison with theflesh-eating dinosaurs and the sabre-toothed tiger. He has also developed manyless harmful ways of responding to challenge-starvation: climbing mountains,exploring the unknown, conquering nature. But his enterprise has had preciselythe effect he was trying to avoid: to make life less challenging. And when lifeloses its challenge, it also loses its savour, and we begin to feel suffocatedand bored. The instinctive response — in adults as much as children — is to lookaround for some mischief to get into. Boredom releases the destructive urge.This is why one of the chief problems of Western civilisation in the lastquarter of the twentieth century is the apparently ‘motiveless’ crime, rangingfrom vandalism and football hooliganism to mass murder.Yet when we apply intelligence to this problem, the answer is plain enough. Itis mere force of habit that makes us crave a physical stimulus. Think whathappens when I face some interesting challenge. I concentrate and set out toarouse my sleeping energies; then I set out to discipline these forces. Butthere is, in fact, nothing to stop me from ‘arousing’ Force T by the same effortof concentration and will, and then setting out to control it. In fact, saintsand ascetics have always known this trick. They have created their ownchallenges — fasting, meditating, tormenting the body — in order to strengthenthe will. Such exercises seem wilfully perverse until we recognise their purpose— to arouse Force T and subject it to Force C, thereby increasing the sense offreedom and widening the range of consciousness.The methods of the saint strike most of us as disagreeably crude and painful.And this is partly because we sense that they are unnecessarily strenuous. Thepast two or three centuries have seen the development of a power with which ourancestors were barely acquainted: imagination. Modern man takes it for grantedbecause he has been exercising it since he was a baby: reading comic books,going to the cinema, watching television. It is almost impossible for us torealise what life was like for a man of the fifteenth century. From the momenthe opened his eyes in the morning, his mind was fixed on the purely practicalworld; by comparison with modern man, his power of imagination was as feeble asa baby’s hand compared with that of a grown man. He had almost no ‘mental life’.In this respect, man has increased his freedom enormously in the course of a fewcenturies. (The invention of the novel in the eighteenth century was one of themost influential events in human history.) Nowadays, almost every child isfamiliar with the experience of becoming so totally absorbed in a story that hefeels as if he is living in the Africa of King Solomon’s Mines or the France ofThe Three Musketeers. And whenever we experience that same absorption, we knowthat this is the basic solution of the Life Question. Imagination, properlydirected and controlled, is a far more efficient means of arousing Force T andForce C than the self-flagellation of the saint, or the self-chosen discomfortsof the round-the-world yachtsman.Most people will feel doubtful about this statement. This is because we tend tothink of imagination as another name for daydreaming or fantasy — in otherwords, telling yourself lies. This is an error. Imagination is, in fact,basically the power of escaping the present moment. This may sound an equallydubious activity, until we give it a little thought. The central problem ofhuman beings is that they are trapped in the present moment; their horizon islimited by ‘close-upness’. When a child is utterly bored, he feels that thepresent moment is somehow unchangeable, that it will go on forever. And althoughthey ought to know better, adults are also subject to the same curious delusion.Experience should have taught them that they are stronger than the matter thatsurrounds them — that, as Wells says, ‘if you don’t like your life, you canchange it’. Yet the moment they become bored, they become subject to thatfamiliar sense of being trapped, like a fly stuck on flypaper. They know thatthis is absurd, that the future will bring all kinds of changes. Yet they stillallow themselves to be bullied and discouraged into a state of passivity by thesheet ‘immediacy’ of the present moment, like a six-foot teenager giving way toa bully half his size because it has become a habit.In fact, we are always catching glimpses of our real power over the present. Imay be involved in some boring task when a fragment of music creeps into myhead, and induces the ‘absurd good news’ feeling. A smell encountered as I walkdown an unfamiliar street — of newly baked bread or roasting coffee beans — mayevoke my childhood and induce a surge of sheer joy. These moments — Proustdevoted a twelve-volume novel to them — are difficult to explain until we cangrasp how far we are normally entrapped in the present moment. It squeezes usand suffocates us, and we have become so used to the feeling that we take it forgranted as part of the ‘human condition’. What the fragment of music or theunexpected smell does is to remind us that the past seemed just as oppressivelyreal as the present — yet it is long gone. These moments tell us: You are freerand stronger than you think. Hence the surge of pure delight.When we think about it, we can see that what we call happiness is nothing morethan this sense of not being trapped in the present moment. That is why we enjoyholidays and excitement and romance, just as the early balloonists enjoyedsoaring up above the ground, and seeing the world from a ‘bird’s eye view’.Excitement gives us a bird’s eye view of life itself, and seems to neutralisethat strange force of gravity that keeps us stuck in the present.Now this, in fact, is the real purpose of imagination: not to create fantasies,but to make us aware of other times and other places. When it actually happens,we realise that ‘imagination’ is a totally inadequate word for this faculty thatcan lift us like a rocket out of the present moment, and make us aware that weare, in some curious sense, citizens of eternity. That is why I have elsewherecoined the term ‘Faculty X’ for the ability to suddenly grasp the reality ofother times and places.*At the moment, it refuses to work to order; it operates fitfully, when it feelsinclined. Yet when it does work, it does so easily and instantaneously, likeswitching on a light. Quite suddenly, some moment of the past has become totallyreal, as real as the present: and we realise that it is as real as the present —or rather, that the present does not have some special status of super-reality,just because it happens to be here and now. We were intended to be the mastersof time, not its slaves.The ease with which this faculty operates suggests that it is somehow encoded inour genes, like our power to walk upright, or the bird’s power of flight. Thisis why ‘Faculty X’ brings the feeling of ‘absurd good news’. It makes us realisethat we already have it.And at this point, we may recollect the main thesis of Human Personality and ItsSurvival of Bodily Death: that there is extremely powerful evidence that humanbeings possess all kinds of unusual faculties of which most of us are unaware,from the extraordinary powers of calculating prodigies and mnemonists (peoplewho can glance at a page of a book and then recite it word for word) totelepathy, clairvoyance and astral projection. And these powers may, in fact, beclosely related to ‘Faculty X’ — for example, the erratic power of ‘projecting’one’s ‘doppelgänger’, so it can be seen by other people in distant places. (Inthe case of the Rev. Mountford,** we have seen that this included the ability to‘project’ a horse and cart as well.) Myers’s book is a plea for a new form ofpsychology to investigate these unknown powers. When Professor Heim saw hiswhole life flash before his eyes as he fell down the crevasse, he wasdiscovering something about his brain that he had never even suspected. The sameapplies to the Rev. Bertrand as he lay frozen on a ledge and followed theprogress of his students to the top of the mountain. And when Sarah Hall saw herown ‘double’ standing by the sideboard, and when Rosalind Heywood split into‘Pink Me’ and ‘White Me’, they were encountering an aspect of human personalitythat is at present unknown to science. When Joseph Rodes Buchanan discoveredthat certain people can ‘read’ the history of an object by holding it in theirhands, he was demonstrating that the unconscious mind has access to ‘hidden’information. When Alfred Russel Wallace placed a schoolboy under hypnosis, thenmade him ‘taste’ things by putting them into his own mouth, he was proving thatthe unconscious has access to other minds.But perhaps the most interesting discovery of psychical research is that we candevelop these powers simply by wanting to. The psychologist Abraham Maslow madea similar discovery about the ‘peak experience’, the moment of suddenoverwhelming happiness. He discovered that when he talked to his students aboutthe peak experience, they not only recalled many half-forgotten peakexperiences, but also began having peak experiences far more frequently.Thinking and talking about the peak experience had ‘reprogrammed thesubconscious mind’, and the subconscious mind did the rest.Which suggests that the chief problem confronted by the human race is not someappalling form of original sin, some deep and justified anxiety about our placein the universe, or recognition of our fundamental weakness and helplessness. Itis simply the problem of a badly programmed subconscious. Most of us haveallowed the subconscious to become messy and untidy, like a disused playroomthat has become a repository for old junk. It smells rather unpleasant becausethere are a few ancient fishpaste sandwiches and half-eaten apples lurking underthe one-eyed teddy bears and mildewed copies of nursery classics. Every time wecatch a glimpse of the mess through the half-open door, we shudder and hurrypast. Yet it would only take half an hour with a broom and mop to make it one ofthe nicest rooms in the house.The whole history of psychical research has been a series of demonstrations ofthe apparently ‘absurd’ powers of the human mind. For the scientist, this hasalways been at best an embarrassment, at worst a scandal. But it now begins tolook as though this may be because he is the slave of his old-fashioned idea ofthe nature of science. More than three centuries ago, René Descartes establishedthe method of modern science and philosophy; he called it ‘radical doubt’. Thephilosopher, says Descartes, should sit in his armchair and contemplate theuniverse around him. He should then proceed to doubt everything that can bedoubted. Does the sun really go around the earth, as it seems to do? If wequestion it, we may arrive at the truth. As to the question: ‘How do you proveyour own existence?’, Descartes replied: ‘I think, therefore I am.’ And havingestablished this apparently unshakeable foundation, he felt able to relax in hisarmchair and turn his telescope on the universe outside his window.The investigator of the paranormal has no doubt that ‘I think, therefore I am’,but he is inclined to add the disconcerting question: ‘You are what?’ For thisis clearly the question that Descartes overlooked: Who precisely am I? Heassumed, naturally enough, that he was René Descartes; that is what it said onhis birth certificate. But every mystic has had the curious experience ofrealising that he is not who he thinks he is. In moments of visionary intensity,his identity dissolves, and he becomes aware that it is no more than a mask.Instead, he is looking into the depths of an inner universe that bears a strangeresemblance to the external universe. And the question: ‘Who am I?’ can only beanswered by pointing his telescope inside himself.In that moment, he realises that the apparent limitation of his powers is due tothe limitation of his picture of himself. In order to expand those powers, hehas to expand his knowledge of himself. He merely has to turn the telescope theother way.*The Philosophy of CD.
